[22:34] this evening to be gathered into your

[22:41] this moment and this would be a Time
[22:43] Lord that you ordained that you would
[22:45] speak your word into the hearts of your
[22:48] believing children and knowing that
[22:50] there's some here who are afflicted and

[23:03] known who it's really been that's been
[23:05] calling to

[1:15:44] gave his life for
[1:15:46] you that a sacrifice that's so strong
[1:15:51] that you had no sin greater than his
[1:15:54] forgiveness
[1:15:55] foress no mistake Beyond his
[1:15:59] ability he's everything and we call
[1:16:03] these young people meetings uh uh but
[1:16:08] the the trouble is is that you're
[1:16:10] growing older and I'm getting
[1:16:13] younger amen I have an appointment with
[1:16:16] a new
[1:16:18] body and you're going to see a miracle
[1:16:21] you're going to see hair come on his
[1:16:23] head am amen
[1:16:27] amen the these wrinkles are going to go
[1:16:32] away and I'm going to get the nose I
[1:16:34] always wanted to
[1:16:36] have amen isn't he good he's he's so
[1:16:41] good and and uh you know there's nothing
[1:16:43] that pleases the Lord more than the
[1:16:46] Saints gathering together in
[1:16:49] unity and there's only one thing that
[1:16:52] really brings us in unity and it's not
[1:16:54] our thing
[1:16:55] thinking it it's not our ideas but it's
[1:16:59] the word of
[1:17:01] [Applause]
[1:17:02] God that's the thing that we have in
[1:17:05] common you know uh we are driving down
[1:17:09] the road and you see all kinds of
[1:17:11] different
[1:17:13] cars you know they they tricked all the
[1:17:15] people you know they took a
[1:17:17] Camry and put a l on the front of it and
[1:17:21] charg
[1:17:22] $20,000 more for the same car you know
[1:17:27] and people buy status you know what I
[1:17:30] mean and everything and and all that but
[1:17:33] just think tonight we've all been
[1:17:34] purchased for the same
[1:17:36] price there's nobody here worth any more
[1:17:40] than anybody
[1:17:41] else you know what I mean we all got
[1:17:44] purchased from the same pawn shop of sin
[1:17:48] and we all got paid for for the same
[1:17:50] price so we're certainly all equal here
[1:17:53] tonight and
[1:17:55] and uh you know we we're here we have
[1:17:57] these meetings we call them young people
[1:17:59] meetings or youth meetings or get
[1:18:02] together whatever it it's it all it is
[1:18:05] is a chance for us old people to try to
[1:18:08] pretend that we're young again so thank
[1:18:11] you for inviting us to your your meeting
[1:18:14] and all those things I I was reading a a
[1:18:18] scripture and it it struck me uh
[1:18:23] tremendously and it's it's out of a a
[1:18:26] ecclesiastics you know and ecclesiastic
[1:18:29] is not a book that we often read but the
[1:18:33] books of you know Proverbs and
[1:18:36] ecclesiastics they're great books of
[1:18:38] wisdom and and the great author wrote
[1:18:41] this he says when I applied my heart to
[1:18:47] know
[1:18:49] wisdom and to see the business that is
[1:18:53] done upon the
[1:18:56] Earth for also there is that neither day
[1:19:01] nor night seeth sleep with his
[1:19:06] eyes I thought could you that's quite
[1:19:08] the same is it none of you have seen
[1:19:10] sleep with your
[1:19:12] eyes you know it's just the the way man
[1:19:16] can block himself out of the thinking of
[1:19:18] God he says then I beheld all the work
[1:19:23] of God that a man cannot find out the
[1:19:27] work that is done under the sun because
[1:19:32] though a man labor to seek it out yet he
[1:19:37] shall not find it yay further though A
[1:19:42] wise man think to know it yet shall he
[1:19:46] not be able to find it for all this I
[1:19:51] considered in my heart even to declare
[1:19:56] all this that the righteous and the wise
[1:20:01] and their works are in the hand of
[1:20:06] God no man knoweth either love Or Hate
[1:20:12] by all that is before
[1:20:15] them amen I thought you can seek after
[1:20:20] everything you can wear yourself out but
[1:20:23] when it comes down to it you can't even
[1:20:25] know love Or Hate by the things that are
[1:20:29] before you for all things are in the
[1:20:32] hands of God and I believe that's our
[1:20:35] heart's desire that why we have meetings
[1:20:38] why we have these things is we want you
[1:20:42] that are starting your lives and uh
[1:20:45] going to make decisions about jobs and
[1:20:47] careers and and and who you're going to
[1:20:50] spend your days with and and trying to
[1:20:53] get all the battle of your mind together
[1:20:56] all we want you to have come to the
[1:20:59] understanding is is that your life is in
[1:21:01] the hand of
[1:21:02] God Amen and no matter
[1:21:06] how hard things get he promised he'd be
[1:21:10] with you even in you till the end so I
[1:21:15] trust tonight through worship and
[1:21:17] through the preaching of the word that
[1:21:20] you will feel his Spirit come close to
[1:21:24] you
[1:21:25] and draw you closer to him and that if
[1:21:30] there's conviction that comes with it
[1:21:33] praise God for
[1:21:35] conviction amen if there's embarrassment
[1:21:38] that comes with it praise God for
[1:21:41] embarrassment I've sat in many a service
[1:21:43] and sat under the preaching of the word
[1:21:46] and thought every eye in the building
[1:21:48] was on me everybody knew he was talking
[1:21:51] about me it felt like all the angels and
[1:21:55] all the peoples of the earth were
[1:21:57] staring at me and I was exposed and no
[1:22:03] chastisement is Peaceable at the time
[1:22:06] but afterwards
[1:22:08] hallelujah hallelujah the freedom that
[1:22:12] you have is wonderful so Lord bless you
[1:22:16] tonight as we prepare after service we
[1:22:19] have food in the other uh room over

[1:22:56] right and and if buts and wise are all

[1:28:03] will change but the hair will amen amen
[1:28:07] and so there's some things about us that
[1:28:08] God just doesn't change amen amen I know

[1:28:16] different amen he made some that they
[1:28:18] like mountains some they like the the
[1:28:20] the sea some they like flat land
[1:28:22] everybody's different but he made it
[1:28:24] that way because of you amen and God is
[1:28:26] a god of variety I'm glad he is if we
[1:28:28] was all the same it would be really hard
[1:28:31] but we're all different and and and
[1:28:33] brother Bram said you know Peter was a
[1:28:36] Brash man somebody was just real on fire
[1:28:38] but then Andrew was real quiet and a
[1:28:40] prayer Warrior he said try to judge try
[1:28:43] to judge Peter by Andrew and you know we
[1:28:46] can fall into that too judge one another
[1:28:47] by someone else we're not supposed to do
[1:28:49] that we just let the Lord be the Lord
[1:28:52] amen and I believe he's revealing
[1:28:53] himself self in the formation of his
[1:28:55] bride amen and how many believe you're
[1:28:57] his bride amen then God will use you to
[1:29:00] show himself to someone else and I I'm
[1:29:02] glad that he does so God bless you if we
[1:29:04] just bow our heads for a word of
[1:29:07] prayer amen father it's a privilege to
[1:29:10] be here this evening Lord we know that
[1:29:13] in our own self we can do nothing father
[1:29:15] and we know that if we just bring our
[1:29:17] own words it's not enough father but if
[1:29:20] we can come Lord in your spirit Lord and
[1:29:23] bring your words it be life Lord to our
[1:29:25] hearts and to to those that have come to
[1:29:28] this meeting Lord It's a youth meeting
[1:29:30] father but Lord we know that you're not
[1:29:33] uh Bound by age father you can speak to
[1:29:35] every heart I pray you'd have your way
[1:29:37] in this service Lord and speak to the
[1:29:40] needs and minister to those Lord and
[1:29:42] anoint my lips anoint the ears of the
[1:29:44] hearer May most of all you have the
[1:29:46] preeminence father heal the sick among
[1:29:48] us Lord the needy Lord You're the same
[1:29:51] yesterday today and forever we thank you
[1:29:54] Lord for your grace and your mercy and
[1:29:56] we ask your blessings upon this service
[1:29:58] now in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:01] amen amen God bless you if you're
[1:30:04] turning your Bibles to the Book of
[1:30:06] Numbers the 22nd chapter amen and we
[1:30:10] know this is a youth
[1:30:11] meeting and we want
[1:30:13] to encourage you amen we want
[1:30:18] to
[1:30:19] um uh we want the word to be established
[1:30:23] in your heart
[1:30:24] and we want you to know how to
[1:30:27] fighten CU we must know how to fight
[1:30:30] must not be carried about by every wind
[1:30:33] or every doctrine that would move around
[1:30:35] and things that would blow but we want
[1:30:37] to be established because the when the
[1:30:40] winds come in and the waves come in they
[1:30:41] come in real hard but if you're built
[1:30:43] upon the rock amen the waves can beat
[1:30:45] against it but it'll never tear it down
[1:30:48] amen and so we thank the Lord amen for
[1:30:50] his word this evening amen Numbers 22
[1:30:54] I want to start at verse 9 and we'll
[1:30:56] just read down to the 12th chap uh 12th
[1:30:59] verse and I also will skip over to the
[1:31:04] 31st and just read one verse that that
[1:31:07] verse and God came unto Baum and said
[1:31:12] what men are these with thee and balum
[1:31:16] said unto God bik the son of zapor King
[1:31:20] of Moab has sent to me saying behold
[1:31:24] there is a people come up out of Egypt
[1:31:28] which cover the face of the
[1:31:30] Earth come now curse me them per ADV
[1:31:35] Venture I shall be able to overcome them
[1:31:39] and drive them out and God said unto
[1:31:42] balum Thou shalt not go with them Thou
[1:31:46] shalt not curse the
[1:31:48] people for they are
[1:31:52] blessed praise the Lord
[1:31:55] the 31st
[1:31:59] verse then the Lord opened the eyes of
[1:32:03] balum and he saw the angel of the Lord
[1:32:07] standing in the
[1:32:08] way and his sword drawn in his hand and
[1:32:12] he bowed down his head and he fell flat
[1:32:16] on his face you can be
[1:32:20] seated may God bless his word
[1:32:28] this is
[1:32:29] a
[1:32:31] remarkable
[1:32:32] setting that I've just read to you and
[1:32:35] it holds a truth
[1:32:38] that uh the prophet of God said needs to
[1:32:41] be taught and he would take this setting
[1:32:45] and he would preach the message does God
[1:32:47] change his mind about his word and I I
[1:32:52] think that's uh something that God wants
[1:32:54] to seek into your hearts does God change
[1:32:57] his mind because if he changes his
[1:33:00] thought we we can't base uh who we are
[1:33:05] amen um and know who we are if he's a
[1:33:08] changeable God if he was a God that it
[1:33:12] would move at the whim of of of our
[1:33:15] failures and if we fail and he would
[1:33:17] change his mind and amen and if he had
[1:33:20] thought about you and then you're here
[1:33:21] and it's not like he would think that
[1:33:24] you should have been amen you have
[1:33:26] nothing to base base it upon and but yet
[1:33:29] this is a scripture where as the prophet
[1:33:31] of God would teach it it looks like God
[1:33:34] changed his
[1:33:37] mind and uh I want to title this tonight
[1:33:41] and and I want to put it in the first
[1:33:44] person make it personal to you as
[1:33:47] well how God sees
[1:33:51] me how God sees me I find that we get in
[1:33:57] such a
[1:33:59] rush many times that we don't stop and
[1:34:03] take the time to to consider what is
[1:34:08] happening or why things are are going
[1:34:12] the way they're
[1:34:13] going and and many times you may not uh
[1:34:17] correctly discern situations that are
[1:34:21] happening in the body of Christ and then
[1:34:23] then then you can be taken by surprise
[1:34:26] you know Satan he loves to speed us
[1:34:29] up he loves to get us in a rush when the
[1:34:32] as we said before when the enemy comes
[1:34:34] in like a flood and he he's trying to
[1:34:37] get you in a panic he's trying to get
[1:34:40] you in a fear then he wants you to make
[1:34:43] decisions while you're feeling that way
[1:34:45] this is how he works amen but God want
[1:34:48] you to stand
[1:34:50] still realize he is God so when we look
[1:34:54] at this
[1:34:55] setting uh uh it shows the power of of a
[1:35:01] heart
[1:35:02] desire in a man and it also gives us
[1:35:07] certain uh understandings of of actions
[1:35:11] and
[1:35:12] manifestations especially in this day
[1:35:15] and age and and it also is detailing a
[1:35:18] trap that has been set for for God's
[1:35:21] people it's coming this is the scripture
[1:35:24] that I've read to you is coming at the
[1:35:26] time that Israel is on the Move amen and
[1:35:31] and the Israel at this time is facing
[1:35:34] many
[1:35:35] changes miam and Aaron have have died
[1:35:40] Israel has been discontented with
[1:35:43] Moses and their souls become discouraged
[1:35:47] because of the way Moses himself is
[1:35:49] under pressure from the congregation I
[1:35:53] mean you know there's times a
[1:35:54] congregation can become dissatisfied
[1:35:57] with their
[1:35:58] leaders amen and the Bible says they
[1:36:01] ched with Moses which means they
[1:36:04] disputed with him in other words they
[1:36:06] didn't see the way he was doing things
[1:36:09] to be the right way amen so the Bible
[1:36:12] says they strove with him which means
[1:36:14] they they begin to accuse Moses listen
[1:36:17] if they will accuse a prophet of God
[1:36:20] they're accuse a pastor they're accuse a
[1:36:22] deacon they're ACC use the leaders amen
[1:36:25] if a prophet is not going to be good
[1:36:27] enough neither is a pastor going to be
[1:36:28] good enough amen but God allows these
[1:36:31] strains to come amongst us because he
[1:36:34] wants you to learn how to stay with the
[1:36:37] word isise the name of the Lord we're
[1:36:40] we're not to be tossed around and and
[1:36:42] just because something gets hard we
[1:36:45] begin to give up and say well I wish I
[1:36:47] was back there or it's better over here
[1:36:50] but God wants you to stay with the
[1:36:52] vision
[1:36:53] because he has a
[1:36:55] vision Hallelujah he's made a promise
[1:36:58] he's not going to change
[1:37:00] it praise the
[1:37:02] Lord amen the the Bible says that the
[1:37:06] the people wish amen that they would
[1:37:08] have
[1:37:09] died just like their
[1:37:13] brothers they pretend that their
[1:37:16] brothers Dayan and cor would come to
[1:37:18] them in a moment had had died a natural
[1:37:21] death but they forgot their brothers
[1:37:24] died under judgment because of
[1:37:28] unbelief by their wrong view of the what
[1:37:30] was happening amongst them they they
[1:37:32] forgot to be
[1:37:34] thankful that they themselves had been
[1:37:39] spared
[1:37:41] amen amen and so as Moses was leading
[1:37:45] the children of Israel another thing
[1:37:47] they
[1:37:47] forgot that Moses was not making his
[1:37:51] decisions based on what he thought was
[1:37:53] right
[1:37:54] but the prophet of God said that Moses
[1:37:57] is getting his information from the
[1:38:00] logos am mean they were led by the
[1:38:02] pillar of fire the church is being led
[1:38:05] by the pillar of fire and it led them
[1:38:08] into a place they amen that they begin
[1:38:10] to get angry and they begin to be
[1:38:12] dissatisfied and and they begin to be
[1:38:14] thirsty and they begin to look at
[1:38:16] everything around them and complain have
[1:38:19] you ever found yourself like
[1:38:22] that and I think if you're
[1:38:24] honest everybody
[1:38:29] has amen but
[1:38:31] remember it's the pillar of
[1:38:34] fire that is leading God's
[1:38:37] people this message is not amen Moses's
[1:38:45] message I don't care how how any man
[1:38:48] would come and try to redefine it and
[1:38:50] take leadership or ownership over it it
[1:38:53] is not their message and you do not have
[1:38:56] a right to change
[1:38:59] it it wasn't even Moses's
[1:39:03] message it was God's
[1:39:05] message if it had been up to Moses Moses
[1:39:08] would have quit a long time ago he had
[1:39:11] forgot the vision he had forgot he was
[1:39:14] to be the leader but God said I have
[1:39:18] remembered I've got some young people
[1:39:22] down here in down
[1:39:24] wherever you're from I've remembered and
[1:39:27] I have come down I'm sending
[1:39:32] you now don't get uncomfortable on me
[1:39:35] older folks don't get uncomfortable if
[1:39:37] anybody should be established it ought
[1:39:39] to be
[1:39:40] you amen don't get
[1:39:43] uncomfortable but as our brother said if
[1:39:45] if conviction comes upon you that's the
[1:39:47] time right there to grab a hold of and
[1:39:49] say God I'm sorry was me now
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:55] we move so quick when circumstances dry
[1:39:58] up and we get we get afraid and and
[1:40:01] because we can't feel him we wonder if
[1:40:02] he's with
[1:40:03] us but God was leading them that
[1:40:07] way and then it begins to reveal to us
[1:40:10] there's conversations going on around us
[1:40:13] that we don't even know about but God is
[1:40:15] all
[1:40:18] aware what I've read to you amen Moses
[1:40:22] might not even known it was happening
[1:40:25] until God showed
[1:40:28] him so Moses is getting his information
[1:40:31] through the pillar of fire amen which is
[1:40:34] the Angel of the Covenant which is
[1:40:36] Christ the anointed one and he's getting
[1:40:38] his message through that and he's giving
[1:40:41] it to the people on on the road to a
[1:40:43] Promised Land but
[1:40:46] amen but this man was all settled down
[1:40:49] Moab and he had his kingdom and he had
[1:40:52] his church churches and he had
[1:40:54] everything in
[1:40:55] order and he looks and he sees this
[1:40:58] people coming among him and he said
[1:41:00] they're going to take over and I need
[1:41:02] somebody to curse the
[1:41:04] people and I notice you imagine that one
[1:41:07] Prophet one man of God seen the works of
[1:41:10] God with another man and try to
[1:41:12] challenge that work he ought to have
[1:41:16] know
[1:41:17] better right Amen brother bam said in
[1:41:21] the revelations book of symbols says he
[1:41:24] said follow the instructions not the
[1:41:27] emotions follow the instructions now
[1:41:29] when he's talking about the instructions
[1:41:30] what does he talking about he said
[1:41:31] follow the
[1:41:33] word if Moses would had followed the
[1:41:36] emotions of the people they' have been
[1:41:38] running all over the mountains and
[1:41:40] screaming amen when they was at the Red
[1:41:42] Sea amen why have you brought us here
[1:41:44] we're going to die they'd all go
[1:41:46] screaming everywhere and he just run
[1:41:48] after him come back come back I'm sorry
[1:41:50] I didn't mean to bring you here God let
[1:41:52] him there
[1:41:54] right and God will bring you into real
[1:41:57] uncomfortable situations because if
[1:42:00] you're going to be a Son of God and if
[1:42:02] you're going to act like a Son of God
[1:42:04] and if you're going to talk like a Son
[1:42:05] of God it's not when when you feel like
[1:42:08] one and it's not going to be when you
[1:42:11] think you're
[1:42:16] one am I yelling too loud for
[1:42:20] you
[1:42:22] amen but God said stand
[1:42:24] still and see the glory of God for this
[1:42:28] day God will fight for you and you'll
[1:42:31] stand still and so they just walked
[1:42:32] across the
[1:42:33] sea so before the people enter into
[1:42:38] Canaan God shows in this dialogue
[1:42:41] between BAC and balum that we read to
[1:42:44] you something of which Israel is unaware
[1:42:47] at the
[1:42:48] moment and it's an attack on God's
[1:42:51] people in a form that we had not seen
[1:42:55] before and we are made partakers of this
[1:42:58] Con conversation just like we're made
[1:43:01] partakers of the conversation between
[1:43:03] Satan and God when they begin to discuss
[1:43:07] job and as it is the case of job Satan's
[1:43:10] attack on God's people is actually used
[1:43:13] by God to bless his
[1:43:18] people
[1:43:19] Moab who who's making this request of
[1:43:22] this Prophet balum Moab is one of
[1:43:25] Israel's habitual
[1:43:27] enemies and the Hallmark of Moab
[1:43:30] according to the
[1:43:31] scripture is it is a very proud
[1:43:36] people Isaiah 16:6 says we have heard of
[1:43:40] the pride of Moab he's very proud even
[1:43:43] of his haughtiness and his pride and his
[1:43:45] wrath but his lies shall not be so
[1:43:48] Jeremiah 48:29 we have heard of the
[1:43:50] pride of Moab he is exceeding proud
[1:43:55] his loftiness and his arrogancy and his
[1:43:57] pride and the haughtiness of his
[1:44:00] heart you see the spirit of
[1:44:04] Pride always try to
[1:44:08] dominate God's
[1:44:12] people you understand we're not talking
[1:44:14] against now in this realm we're not
[1:44:17] talking about a people against a
[1:44:19] people we're talking about a spiritual
[1:44:22] warfare
[1:44:23] PR that is trying to anoint you against
[1:44:27] the leadership of the word and it is
[1:44:31] pride to think amen I can stop this from
[1:44:36] happening we're
[1:44:38] familiar amen with this
[1:44:42] nation this nation of Israel is a great
[1:44:45] danger to the people or excuse me this
[1:44:47] nation of Moab is a a danger to the
[1:44:50] people of God and Converse ly Bayo
[1:44:53] seesing God's people in enormous danger
[1:44:56] to his own
[1:44:59] existence he feels
[1:45:01] threatened by their
[1:45:04] approach amen because amen they're
[1:45:07] they're are Supernatural people there
[1:45:10] are people who God has
[1:45:12] LED and there are a he he feels
[1:45:15] threatened by by by their
[1:45:19] stand amen but yet in reality there's no
[1:45:22] reason fear because God had forbidden
[1:45:24] them don't don't mess with them just
[1:45:26] pass on through don't go to war with
[1:45:28] them pass on through if you use anything
[1:45:31] in the land pay them for it but go on
[1:45:34] through oh if the devil would only know
[1:45:36] we're just passing
[1:45:40] through we don't want nothing of
[1:45:44] his I said we don't want nothing of his
[1:45:47] we're just passing on
[1:45:49] through amen but we're familiar with the
[1:45:52] story and I know you are at the king of
[1:45:55] Moab and the princes and The Messengers
[1:45:57] of Moab are Desiring the services of
[1:46:00] balum because of the advance of of
[1:46:04] Israel so you just want to be aware in
[1:46:07] this lesson young people anytime you
[1:46:09] begin to move with God and move in step
[1:46:11] with what he's doing Satan is going to
[1:46:13] try to block
[1:46:15] you he's going to do something Monday
[1:46:18] you can be sure he's going to do
[1:46:19] something
[1:46:20] Monday amen when we when we try to have
[1:46:23] services or ministers trying to prepare
[1:46:25] Satan is going to do something to try to
[1:46:27] disrupt your mind and and get in your
[1:46:30] emotions because he knows if he can get
[1:46:32] you amen distracted the word will not
[1:46:35] have the effect like if you sit here
[1:46:38] tonight and you begin to fall asleep or
[1:46:40] you think about this or you think about
[1:46:42] that the word can just pass you right
[1:46:47] by man and so Moab has seen what Israel
[1:46:51] has done to the amorites
[1:46:53] in destroying them and they're afraid in
[1:46:56] fact the exact phrase that the scripture
[1:46:59] uses is they are sore
[1:47:03] afraid which it means they were in a
[1:47:06] panic when Israel is
[1:47:09] approaching and so they go into talk
[1:47:12] with the talks with the Elders of Midian
[1:47:14] and they they come up with a plan to
[1:47:17] overcome and and and drive out the
[1:47:20] Israelites and I and I want to dwell on
[1:47:22] on that because we know that Israel in
[1:47:25] the natural is a type of the church
[1:47:28] spiritual
[1:47:30] amen so now amen because the enemy has
[1:47:36] seen how Israel has defeated some great
[1:47:39] warriors like Sion and OG these two
[1:47:42] great Kings he realizes a military
[1:47:46] confrontation is not going to
[1:47:49] work so he has to come up with another
[1:47:52] way
[1:47:54] to defeat God's
[1:47:56] people amen because a full-on battle
[1:47:59] amen where we draw our swords and we
[1:48:01] draw our battle lines he knows he's
[1:48:03] going to
[1:48:04] lose but I got to do another
[1:48:08] thing so what he wants to try to do is
[1:48:11] his tactic is he wants to try to drive a
[1:48:15] wedge between God and his
[1:48:18] people and he's doing it at a very
[1:48:22] extreme
[1:48:23] tactical moment it's at the end of the
[1:48:27] of the Wilderness journey and all the
[1:48:30] unfaithfulness of the people he has 40
[1:48:34] years to work
[1:48:37] with 40 Years of
[1:48:40] failures 40 Years of unbelief and
[1:48:45] uprisings imagine if in my church if I
[1:48:49] took all the years of the negative
[1:48:51] things that have happened in my church
[1:48:52] church and and said now I'm going to
[1:48:54] make a story about that or maybe even
[1:48:56] put it on the internet and make a
[1:48:58] book you're like you go to what
[1:49:03] church do you know what they do there
[1:49:07] you see because he wants to drive a
[1:49:11] wedge amen and
[1:49:14] so Bic
[1:49:18] shows I hope you're listening hope
[1:49:20] you're not too tired
[1:49:23] Bao shows in this conversation he knows
[1:49:27] nothing about the God of
[1:49:32] Israel he only sees him as a holy
[1:49:36] God a God who destroys his enemies God
[1:49:41] who judges in
[1:49:44] [Applause]
[1:49:45] Anger a God who opens up the Earth and
[1:49:48] swallows up those unbelieving Israelites
[1:49:50] and those rebellious people a god
[1:49:53] God he knows nothing about the
[1:49:58] [Applause]
[1:50:00] grace he knows nothing about a
[1:50:06] hand he know he doesn't even know that
[1:50:08] this very message started in
[1:50:12] Grace it was a message that said Moses
[1:50:15] no one can take your place I don't care
[1:50:18] if they're a better speaker they'll
[1:50:20] never take your
[1:50:21] place you see what happens is when God
[1:50:24] starts a work and he uses a certain man
[1:50:27] and then as the church begins to grow
[1:50:29] other men perhaps more talented perhaps
[1:50:32] better speakers perhaps they have they
[1:50:34] seem to ooze confidence you're like I'll
[1:50:36] follow that man but then the man that
[1:50:38] God uses he's just makes mistakes and he
[1:50:41] seems to stumble around and he can't
[1:50:43] even speak things right and you're like
[1:50:45] oh why would I follow a man like that
[1:50:48] give me the man that can stand out there
[1:50:49] and use a sword and boldness and knows
[1:50:52] I'm the the
[1:50:54] one Moses was such a
[1:50:58] man Moses was a man who
[1:51:01] stuttered would you have followed
[1:51:05] him I want
[1:51:07] to tell you you're like this service is
[1:51:11] going to take all
[1:51:14] night you would have got impatient with
[1:51:16] him you'd have looked at his
[1:51:19] weaknesses You' have judged him for his
[1:51:21] wrong decision
[1:51:24] oh if you'd have been there when he in
[1:51:25] anger I ain't going to follow an angry
[1:51:28] prophet and he struck the rock
[1:51:30] twice get me the man that does
[1:51:33] everything right and you'll never find
[1:51:37] him you see our problem is we judge one
[1:51:39] another by one
[1:51:41] another and I want you to know the
[1:51:43] prophet said there's no big eyes or
[1:51:44] little use this message is a message of
[1:51:48] power this word is a word of power and
[1:51:51] if it was a man's word it would die but
[1:51:54] this word this message is not a dying
[1:51:57] word this message is Christ I want you
[1:52:01] to know this message cannot
[1:52:03] die this message is the power come on
[1:52:07] you old us folks you ought to be behind
[1:52:09] me showing your life the power of
[1:52:12] Resurrection you should have died you
[1:52:15] should have quit but God the grace of
[1:52:20] God all right you're not good amen
[1:52:22] that's it's okay I'll take
[1:52:29] it God help
[1:52:31] us forget how it
[1:52:34] started and God is the starter and he's
[1:52:37] the
[1:52:39] finisher there's a reason he took a
[1:52:41] prophet off the
[1:52:42] scene and there's a reason he took Moses
[1:52:45] off the
[1:52:50] scene cuz if you can't following Moses
[1:52:53] you're certainly not follow the Holy
[1:52:58] Ghost
[1:53:00] amen so this plan I want you to
[1:53:03] understand young people it's all about
[1:53:05] you there's a plan taking place on a
[1:53:08] mountain
[1:53:09] somewhere we have to stop them stop this
[1:53:14] generation I've got the majority of this
[1:53:16] generation confused of what they even
[1:53:19] are they don't know they get up in the
[1:53:21] morning and a man man looks in the in
[1:53:23] the mirror and he goes you know what I'm
[1:53:25] a
[1:53:28] girl and what I just said is considered
[1:53:32] bigotry in hate
[1:53:34] speech you understand it's a
[1:53:37] reality where a girl would like go you
[1:53:40] know I I I want to be a man and they
[1:53:43] were never meant to be that way they
[1:53:45] were meant you know it's not hard to
[1:53:47] understand who you are it's what God
[1:53:49] made you at the
[1:53:51] beginning amen if you try to change that
[1:53:53] you're not you're changing what God had
[1:53:55] already
[1:53:56] started and he has come in like a flood
[1:53:59] and he's tried to confuse the identity
[1:54:01] of the people confuse the identity of
[1:54:03] churches churches are confused people
[1:54:06] are confused nobody knows hardly where
[1:54:09] to stand anymore but there is a sure
[1:54:11] word of
[1:54:14] Prophecy that already says who I am
[1:54:17] where I came from you know there was a
[1:54:20] man one time was confused about where he
[1:54:22] came from I'm tell you the kind of God

[1:54:32] are laying there crying and nobody loves
[1:54:34] me and and nobody cares for me nobody

[1:55:09] bad to worse because not only now is his
[1:55:12] Natural Life attacked his spiritual life
[1:55:14] is in doubt everything is being attacked
[1:55:16] and God is silent God isn't saying a
[1:55:19] word
[1:55:22] only connection he has with God he
[1:55:24] doesn't have a
[1:55:25] Bible he doesn't have 1,200 Services of
[1:55:28] a prophet to listen to he doesn't have a
[1:55:31] wealth of commentaries from the past
[1:55:34] ages he doesn't have a church age book
[1:55:38] he only has what God speaks to him and
[1:55:41] God takes it away and he shuts it
[1:55:44] off yeah he said God where are you where
[1:55:48] are you will you speak to me

[1:55:55] stop why don't you just curse God and
[1:55:57] die it's all that's left for curse God
[1:55:58] and die he had enough sense to say he
[1:56:01] didn't say she's a foolish woman enough
[1:56:03] sense about that learn young
[1:56:07] people the older folks back in the back
[1:56:10] don't even have strength to
[1:56:12] say come on he looked at her and says
[1:56:14] you know you talk like
[1:56:20] like like a foolish
[1:56:25] one though God slay

[1:56:43] Satan would attack you this hard and and
[1:56:45] you know I I I kind of got to let you
[1:56:47] know that I I did give him permission
[1:56:49] but I I did tell him you know don't take
[1:56:50] your life I I didn't realize you lose
[1:56:52] everything no you know what God told him
[1:56:54] to do it's always amazed me I love this
[1:56:56] I love
[1:56:58] this he had every right to be depressed
[1:57:01] and maybe miss a Wednesday
[1:57:04] night you had every right to
[1:57:07] pout you know what God told him stand
[1:57:12] up and be a
[1:57:15] man what do you mean I've lost
[1:57:17] everything be a
[1:57:19] man I'm going to tell you something you
[1:57:21] never knew
[1:57:24] I want to ask you a question all you've
[1:57:27] done is ask me questions why is this
[1:57:29] happened why has that happened I want to
[1:57:32] ask you a
[1:57:34] question where were
[1:57:38] you because you may not have the answer
[1:57:42] but I have the answer to where you
[1:57:48] were I want you to know this message has
[1:57:51] the answer
[1:57:52] Amen to your life to who you was before
[1:57:55] the foundation of the world when a
[1:57:58] prophet would stand behind the pulpit
[1:57:59] and said I'm going to talk to you about
[1:58:02] what he had in his mind before the world
[1:58:05] was ever
[1:58:06] formed we have a message that tells us
[1:58:10] where we came from tells us our purpose
[1:58:13] in life and tells us where we're
[1:58:19] going how can you not think God for
[1:58:24] that Satan says if I can drive a
[1:58:27] wedge between them these people's
[1:58:30] understanding of their
[1:58:36] God so you know what they
[1:58:39] did they went out and got another true
[1:58:48] Prophet somebody who could be another
[1:58:50] voice
[1:58:53] amen other than brother
[1:58:56] brandham other than Moses this was not a
[1:59:00] false prophet he was a real
[1:59:04] Prophet but the difference
[1:59:08] was amen he could
[1:59:11] sell his
[1:59:19] gift he was not a hit and mprofit
[1:59:25] say something
[1:59:26] true and then say something
[1:59:29] wrong he was a true
[1:59:31] Prophet but the Bible calls him a
[1:59:36] hiring because Satan knows the way I can
[1:59:40] get between you and God is with another
[1:59:46] word another
[1:59:48] word and I know what cursing means and I
[1:59:51] know what blessing in means and I know
[1:59:53] what things said over you
[1:59:56] mean now I don't want to depress you but
[1:59:58] I'm going to take as long as I can
[2:00:01] tonight because we want the we want the
[2:00:04] enemy amen that speaks to your mind and
[2:00:07] tries to put these things in you and
[2:00:09] keep you in a place of loneliness and
[2:00:10] depression he wants you to think God
[2:00:13] doesn't know you or God doesn't care for
[2:00:15] you or it's not for you he wants you to
[2:00:17] think that but I want you to be able at
[2:00:19] the end of the service stand up and say
[2:00:20] I know how God sees me
[2:00:25] I know how God sees me and nobody can
[2:00:27] change
[2:00:30] it
[2:00:38] nobody so when The Messengers come to
[2:00:40] Bam they said we know we
[2:00:42] know that what you curse is cursed and
[2:00:46] we know that what you bless is
[2:00:50] blessed and 22:6 it says come now
[2:00:53] therefore I pray thee curse me this
[2:00:55] people for they're too Mighty for me I
[2:00:59] cannot meet them in face to-face
[2:01:10] battle hi brother
[2:01:13] David amen hey fella you with the
[2:01:16] glasses right there you see me come here
[2:01:26] if you can't see him you can see his
[2:01:30] shoes I want you understand the power of
[2:01:33] this
[2:01:35] message that if this young fellow
[2:01:38] here begins to believe God has touched
[2:01:42] his
[2:01:43] heart Satan knows he cannot stop him
[2:01:49] right you understand that you believe
[2:01:51] that I'm like
[2:01:53] you put your hand up
[2:02:03] yeah
[2:02:05] Satan Satan
[2:02:08] knows the
[2:02:10] power let me just say something just a
[2:02:12] minute amen he's taking your picture you
[2:02:15] smile at him I'll preach amen I want to
[2:02:18] say something a minute when the maniac
[2:02:20] of gadera was bound with over 2,000
[2:02:24] demons and Jesus walked down there to
[2:02:27] him those demons recognized what was in
[2:02:32] that little body of Jesus
[2:02:35] Christ and brother brandham said they
[2:02:38] cried out what are you doing in that
[2:02:41] little bitty body cuz they know the
[2:02:44] spirit that was in him
[2:02:53] the spirit that was in him is the one
[2:02:57] who swept his hand out and there go the
[2:03:00] Stars he's the one that spoke the world
[2:03:03] into existence they know why is it
[2:03:06] contained in a little body hallelujah
[2:03:10] hallelujah they know in face to-face
[2:03:13] Warfare they're defeated and the only
[2:03:15] thing they can do is ask do I have
[2:03:17] permission to go over here all right and
[2:03:20] here you think you cannot overcome a
[2:03:23] demon of lust or you cannot overcome the
[2:03:26] God of this
[2:03:27] age and if you amen take inside of you
[2:03:31] that spirit amen that created the
[2:03:33] heavens and the Earth they will ask
[2:03:37] [Applause]
[2:03:41] permission brother bam said a man can
[2:03:44] live so close to God that the devil
[2:03:47] don't know what to do with
[2:03:49] him I believe you know what is your name
[2:03:53] W huh Weston yeah I got a nephew by the
[2:03:56] name of Weston and you know them demons
[2:03:58] will say well here comes that kid with
[2:03:59] him wearing shoes
[2:04:02] again and you may not think much of it
[2:04:05] and you may judge it by how small he is
[2:04:09] but I'm tell you God knows how to get in
[2:04:11] real small
[2:04:14] places he knows how to get in real tight
[2:04:20] Corners he knows know how Amen to get
[2:04:23] into a fiery
[2:04:26] furnace that's my
[2:04:29] God I said that's my God he is not
[2:04:33] hindered by how small you
[2:04:38] are he can be in a big body he can be in
[2:04:42] a small body that doesn't stop
[2:04:47] God
[2:04:49] so so let's find us
[2:04:55] Prophet let's find us a
[2:04:59] prophet whose word has
[2:05:02] power and they found
[2:05:05] one I want to say
[2:05:07] this no matter how gifted you
[2:05:10] are your gift is subject to the word of
[2:05:14] the
[2:05:17] age
[2:05:19] true Paul said it himself s if I or even
[2:05:23] an angel from heaven come and say
[2:05:25] something different than what I've
[2:05:26] already preached to
[2:05:27] you then let him be a curse and I'll say
[2:05:30] it
[2:05:33] again and when we have left off standing
[2:05:37] for the
[2:05:38] word amen then Satan knows he is being
[2:05:44] successful and driving a wedge between
[2:05:47] you and the Vindicated word of the hour
[2:05:51] if you got to wait on me to say a word
[2:05:54] over you or or to tell you you're going
[2:05:56] to make it you're going to wait a long
[2:05:59] time cuz it isn't up to me to tell
[2:06:04] you I cannot save you I cannot amen do
[2:06:08] any of those things I did not die for
[2:06:10] you the only salvation I can give you is
[2:06:13] one that's already been
[2:06:18] presented more of you should be saying
[2:06:20] Amen to that
[2:06:22] come
[2:06:22] on I want you say it like this when a
[2:06:26] person is more precious to you than the
[2:06:28] word you're not
[2:06:33] worthy Jesus said unless you forsake
[2:06:37] your father and
[2:06:38] mother that's
[2:06:41] right
[2:06:42] amen and follow
[2:06:45] me come
[2:06:47] on oh don't get offended on
[2:06:50] me stand with me somebody help
[2:06:54] me don't let it just be the young men
[2:06:56] let it be those that have all these
[2:06:57] miles on your body and you've come
[2:06:58] through all kinds of ups and downs and
[2:07:00] failures and don't let that Devil stay
[2:07:02] on top of you and say you can't make it
[2:07:04] or say you're not a child of God because
[2:07:06] you failed before you might have fallen
[2:07:09] you might have done wrong amen but Satan
[2:07:12] is only trying to present to you the
[2:07:14] Holiness of God but he doesn't want you
[2:07:16] to know the grace
[2:07:18] [Applause]
[2:07:23] Grace does not
[2:07:25] excuse Grace does not excuse Grace says
[2:07:29] neither do I condemn
[2:07:31] Thee thank you Lord that's all the world
[2:07:34] wants to stop at they would say see he
[2:07:35] wouldn't condemn so how can you condemn
[2:07:37] but that's not what the Bible says
[2:07:38] neither do I condemn thee go and sin no
[2:07:42] more if he can have power to forgive he
[2:07:45] can have power to
[2:07:47] cllean power to walk a holy life
[2:07:56] so Moab is unusual Moab is trying to
[2:08:01] weaken
[2:08:02] Israel by another
[2:08:08] word amen and that word will
[2:08:12] war against the revealed
[2:08:16] word of Moses
[2:08:21] at least that's what Bic hopes as a
[2:08:27] case if I can get them to listen to me
[2:08:30] instead of
[2:08:32] Moses if I can get to listen to my
[2:08:35] Prophet instead of
[2:08:39] Moses I want you people to do me a favor
[2:08:42] get out of your mind I'm speaking
[2:08:43] against
[2:08:46] people talk about the spirit
[2:08:54] so balam is a prophet he's a true
[2:08:57] Prophet but he's not a true word
[2:09:04] Prophet because if he was he would have
[2:09:07] submitted himself to the revealed
[2:09:12] word in fact balum is available to the
[2:09:17] highest
[2:09:19] bidder y you need a
[2:09:23] word I can say it I'll say whatever it
[2:09:27] needs you know if it's to make you feel
[2:09:30] bad I can say it if I can make you feel
[2:09:31] good I'll say
[2:09:33] it just make the pay
[2:09:38] good now balum balam when he's presented
[2:09:41] with this here's these people coming
[2:09:47] up it came at a crucial time because
[2:09:50] Israel would have fresh in their mind
[2:09:51] that their Prophet had just made a huge
[2:09:55] mistake he'd struck the rock
[2:09:58] twice in
[2:10:01] Anger isn't that the right time to leave
[2:10:06] him is that the right time you know how
[2:10:08] a man say one time he said you know if a
[2:10:10] man's a true Prophet he'll never make a
[2:10:16] mistake he said because Moses said
[2:10:24] I'm like well I don't know what Bible
[2:10:25] you
[2:10:27] read but the Bible I
[2:10:29] read it said Moses made such a mistake
[2:10:33] that amen the last day Prophet would
[2:10:35] come along and said he broke every
[2:10:37] commandment there was by striking the
[2:10:39] rock twice amen he used a pre a gift
[2:10:43] that had worked
[2:10:45] before now he was afraid to speak
[2:10:48] it anger made him do that
[2:10:52] you see if Satan can get you stirred up
[2:10:54] in your passions against one another
[2:10:56] you'll say things that will carry a
[2:11:00] mark you see we live in the days of
[2:11:03] labels if I can label you I don't have
[2:11:06] to really know
[2:11:07] [Music]
[2:11:09] you hey hey I I I got a pantry just like
[2:11:12] you got a pantry I go in there and I
[2:11:14] have a can and I like tomato soup and it
[2:11:16] says tomato soup on the label I don't
[2:11:18] open up to see if it is tomato soup I
[2:11:21] know it's tomato soup I do not have to
[2:11:24] investigate and if somebody will label
[2:11:27] you and say ah you don't believe in God
[2:11:29] or you don't you're a liar or you're
[2:11:31] this or you have this problem there's a
[2:11:33] label on you well I don't have to look
[2:11:35] at who you really are come on now on now
[2:11:38] because words carry cursing and blessing
[2:11:41] and we can fall into that trap so easy
[2:11:43] even in the message even preacher
[2:11:45] against
[2:11:46] preacher amen run somebody down and you
[2:11:49] won't listen to them
[2:11:52] come on church you've been guilty of it
[2:11:54] you know you've been guilty of speaking
[2:11:55] against maybe even your wife or your
[2:11:57] husband you know what it's a good thing
[2:11:58] to do is you ought to know how to
[2:12:02] repent you may not be able to get those
[2:12:04] words back but you can say you're
[2:12:08] sorry I know that's not popular I'm
[2:12:12] [Music]
[2:12:16] sorry come on Church
[2:12:21] the very event young
[2:12:24] people the very event of the nation of
[2:12:26] Moab being
[2:12:28] afraid of the children of Israel is
[2:12:31] fulfilling
[2:12:33] prophecy the very Act of you coming and
[2:12:37] the Enemy being afraid begins to fulfill
[2:12:39] what a prophet already said Moses had
[2:12:42] set it at the Red Sea you and your mercy
[2:12:44] have led forth the people which you have
[2:12:45] redeemed you've guided them in thy
[2:12:46] strength into thy holy habitation the
[2:12:48] people shall here be afraid sorrow shall
[2:12:50] take hold on the inhabitants of
[2:12:52] Palestine then the Dukes of Edom shall
[2:12:53] be amazed the Mighty Men of Moab
[2:12:55] trembling shall take hold of them is
[2:12:58] already said already happened and now
[2:13:00] here they are stepping into
[2:13:04] that amen you shall bring them and you
[2:13:06] shall plant them in the
[2:13:08] mountain so the Bible speaks about
[2:13:11] balum you can read about it in the New
[2:13:15] Testament it C says three things about
[2:13:18] him it says the way of balam in second
[2:13:20] Peter 2
[2:13:21] in judges one it talks about the error
[2:13:24] of balum Amen in Revelations 2 it talks
[2:13:27] about the
[2:13:28] teaching of
[2:13:32] balum
[2:13:34] somehow after thousands of years balum
[2:13:37] is still
[2:13:42] [Music]
[2:13:43] alive will
[2:13:45] Satan after his failures to kill people
[2:13:49] in
[2:13:50] battle will he succeed in his efforts to
[2:13:54] destroy the
[2:13:56] people for the attempts of the enemy
[2:13:58] make it
[2:13:59] clear God will always maintain his
[2:14:02] relationship with his
[2:14:05] people no matter
[2:14:07] what so we have a situation I try to
[2:14:10] hurry a little bit we have a situation
[2:14:11] that bam did talk to God and he asked
[2:14:13] permission to go and God says no you
[2:14:15] don't go and the reason you don't go I
[2:14:17] have blessed these
[2:14:19] people so bam goes back he's determined
[2:14:22] he says listen I'm not going God told me
[2:14:24] not to go and I believe his first
[2:14:27] word they're like Hey listen you don't
[2:14:29] know these people I don't care what
[2:14:30] they've done I don't care God told me
[2:14:32] not to go so they went back and
[2:14:34] reconvened and they talked about it
[2:14:35] again they said let's offer him more
[2:14:39] money let's see if we can persuade him a
[2:14:41] second time you know Satan can try
[2:14:44] something on you the first time and it
[2:14:45] won't
[2:14:46] work but that don't mean he's going to
[2:14:48] stop that's right come on young people
[2:14:51] he's going to try
[2:14:52] again give you a better opportunity you

[2:18:05] policeman so I'll be a polican so he
[2:18:07] went over and became a
[2:18:08] policeman and tell you where he's at
[2:18:10] today he divorced his wife both of them
[2:18:14] left the
[2:18:15] message married other people children
[2:18:19] are scattered why why because the will
[2:18:22] of
[2:18:23] God gave him an
[2:18:25] opportunity a new
[2:18:30] offer I want you to know something the
[2:18:32] God I serve yes sir knows how to give
[2:18:35] you
[2:18:36] opportunity and I found out my God knows
[2:18:40] how to pay a bill when I don't have
[2:18:45] money and I found out if I would be
[2:18:48] faithful to the word
[2:18:51] said I have never seen the righteous
[2:18:53] somebody here help me I have never seen
[2:18:56] the righteous
[2:18:58] forsaken I've never seen his seed Bing
[2:19:02] bread don't you give up on a God that
[2:19:05] when things begin to dry up our dreams
[2:19:08] Loom large my God can take care of you
[2:19:12] you remain faithful to his
[2:19:16] word oh help me Lord I got a long ways
[2:19:18] to
[2:19:19] go you sung a a long
[2:19:22] time so we have this situation he's
[2:19:26] offered
[2:19:27] more so he comes back and he says okay
[2:19:30] I'll do it but I only say what God puts
[2:19:32] in my mouth and here here's a prophet of
[2:19:34] our age would look at that and he says
[2:19:36] now look like God changed his
[2:19:39] mind he said but really what it was it
[2:19:42] was the heart
[2:19:45] desire God knows how to expose what's in
[2:19:48] your heart
[2:19:52] and he said that God will give you his
[2:19:54] original word which is his perfect
[2:19:58] will and if you don't want it he allow
[2:20:03] you to go your own way but it'll be his
[2:20:06] permissive will you go on but I will
[2:20:11] still get the
[2:20:14] glory bam you go doing the permissive
[2:20:17] will you may lose your life but I can
[2:20:21] still save those children
[2:20:24] amen who suffered under your permissive
[2:20:28] will because you wanted that
[2:20:32] more than his perfect
[2:20:35] will there's a heart bride there's a
[2:20:37] bride after God's Own Heart that want
[2:20:39] his
[2:20:41] word oh
[2:20:43] my so we see that what I'm speaking of
[2:20:46] here is is something that and I want to
[2:20:49] remind you of this that we're taught in
[2:20:50] the church age period that these same
[2:20:52] Spirits are working against the true
[2:20:56] church brother bam said working
[2:20:58] mysteriously against the true church and
[2:21:01] God will expose those spirits in the
[2:21:04] Book of Revelation by their old
[2:21:06] testament names and brother brandom in
[2:21:09] the seals he will call them the
[2:21:12] actors in the ages because it's the same
[2:21:16] Spirit just changing his mask that's
[2:21:19] right so when you have the Deeds or the
[2:21:21] doctrine of the nickan and then you have
[2:21:23] amen the teaching of balam and the amen
[2:21:26] and then that Prophet prophetess Jezebel
[2:21:29] seducing the people with her Doctrine he
[2:21:31] said it's not different people it's the
[2:21:34] same Spirit moving from Death to death
[2:21:38] to death and God pulls the picture back
[2:21:41] and he shows this is Satan trying to get
[2:21:45] you to believe a hybrid
[2:21:48] word against the original
[2:21:52] word so at the same time that these
[2:21:55] enemies are being
[2:21:57] exposed Christ is also revealing
[2:22:01] himself and this is the
[2:22:04] war because when Christ is revealing
[2:22:06] himself it's the
[2:22:08] Revelation and Satan is against the
[2:22:10] revelation of the word because the
[2:22:12] revelation of the word is the reality of
[2:22:13] the
[2:22:15] word speaking from Revelations 5 brother
[2:22:17] bam is showing the work of the lamb and
[2:22:19] his intercessory work work which is his
[2:22:22] present
[2:22:23] office brother bandam would say in the
[2:22:25] first seal that lamb in the time of his
[2:22:28] intercessory back here he knew there
[2:22:29] were names that were in there that was
[2:22:32] put in there from the foundation of the
[2:22:34] world you think about it I'm speaking to
[2:22:38] names that was in that Lamb's Book of
[2:22:41] Life from before the foundation of the
[2:22:44] world you cannot contain it
[2:22:47] here and as long as those names have
[2:22:51] never been manifested on Earth yet he
[2:22:54] had to stay there as an
[2:22:56] intercessor do you get it it's
[2:22:58] predestination all right he had to stay
[2:23:01] there
[2:23:03] because he had to stay there because he
[2:23:06] came to die for those that God has
[2:23:08] ordained to eternal life by his for
[2:23:11] knowledge he saw them not by his own
[2:23:13] will his will that none should perish
[2:23:16] but by his forn knowledge he knew who he
[2:23:19] knew who would and who would not
[2:23:22] therefore as long as there was one
[2:23:24] name one name that had not been declared
[2:23:28] in Earth Christ had to stay there as an
[2:23:31] intercessor to take
[2:23:36] care I wonder maybe tonight there's one
[2:23:39] name who hasn't been manifested yet
[2:23:41] that's maybe even said in here in this
[2:23:43] room and he said I take care of that we
[2:23:46] sung the song Amen as we come to the
[2:23:48] pulpit there is a blood
[2:23:51] I have to take care of that
[2:23:54] name oh praise the Lord Brother bandham
[2:23:57] said here's a woman laying here
[2:23:58] stretched on a
[2:24:00] stretcher and this morning she's in a
[2:24:02] serious condition well if God doesn't
[2:24:04] touch her she'll die she's aged she's an
[2:24:07] old mother gray hair wearing glasses
[2:24:09] very Godly looking person amen now she's
[2:24:12] laying her perhaps her doctor has done
[2:24:14] all he knows to do but he can't do no
[2:24:16] more she's Fallen her ankles or ribs and
[2:24:18] the complication of things she told me
[2:24:20] what is wrong with her and things that
[2:24:22] she didn't know also but There She lays
[2:24:24] in that kind of state well being in that
[2:24:27] kind of condition and tore up like that
[2:24:29] now what can we do for
[2:24:30] her it is to bring her in the Blessed
[2:24:35] presence of the all-sufficient
[2:24:37] refreshening Holy Ghost that can take
[2:24:40] away the staleness from herl as the
[2:24:44] doctor though good as he could be trying
[2:24:46] to tell her that maybe there is nothing
[2:24:47] more I can do but we lift
[2:24:52] her into that
[2:24:55] place oh how God Amen is Desiring to
[2:24:59] lift
[2:25:00] you into that place where you realize
[2:25:03] he's the alls sufficient one you don't
[2:25:05] have to walk by your own power you can
[2:25:08] walk in his power praise the name of the
[2:25:11] Lord and so God God ask asked balam this
[2:25:17] question who are these men with you
[2:25:21] now God knows all things he knows who
[2:25:23] those men are but he's saying I want to
[2:25:25] I want to I want to get a explanation
[2:25:28] from you so he begins to tell them these
[2:25:30] men are coming and they're want me to do
[2:25:33] something about these people and God
[2:25:37] says where are you getting your
[2:25:40] information yeah now I got to be honest
[2:25:42] I'm getting it from these men's
[2:25:43] perspective that's where I'm getting
[2:25:46] it so when God told him not to go then
[2:25:48] he gets a better offer and he comes back
[2:25:49] and he goes again and God says go but
[2:25:52] I'm going to tell
[2:25:54] you what to
[2:25:56] say so bam
[2:25:59] went you know so here God can be really
[2:26:01] strange and you may not understand the
[2:26:03] ways of God but as he
[2:26:04] goes his his his his donkey begins to
[2:26:16] malfunction amen and and he falls down
[2:26:21] so balum he he gets all animated you
[2:26:23] know he begins to try to get him up and
[2:26:25] he's not getting up and he tries to get
[2:26:26] him up again and he and and and he fell
[2:26:29] he fell on him in such a place that he
[2:26:31] he pinned balum against the wall Bam's
[2:26:33] there and he's and he's and he's
[2:26:34] striking his donkey trying to get him up
[2:26:36] because he's never done this
[2:26:38] before and what he doesn't realize is is
[2:26:41] the Beast he's riding has eyes to see an
[2:26:46] angel that the animal is seeing what
[2:26:49] amen a Prophet cannot
[2:26:51] see the prophet cannot see this Angel of
[2:26:55] the Lord standing there with a drawn
[2:26:57] sword why is that angel standing there
[2:27:00] for you he has to take care of
[2:27:04] you God was so careful I'm going to
[2:27:06] remind you I'm going to remind you by
[2:27:08] your vehicle Breaking Down Bam and
[2:27:10] you're going to get so mad you're going
[2:27:11] to find yourself amen cursing your
[2:27:13] vehicle I hope none of you did
[2:27:17] that I hope none of you have a temper
[2:27:19] like that where you beat the wheel of
[2:27:21] your car and talk to
[2:27:26] it I don't know why none of you stand up
[2:27:29] when I say that Hallelujah brother you
[2:27:32] know that guy in front of you or what
[2:27:33] you know how it is okay anyway he can
[2:27:36] you imagine if balum lived in
[2:27:41] Dallas he he'd have been committed a
[2:27:43] long time ago amen and so amen so here
[2:27:48] he finds himself a prophet having a
[2:27:50] conversation with a
[2:27:53] beast yeah haven't I been a good
[2:27:56] donkey yes you've been a good donkey
[2:27:58] you'd have thought somewhere along the
[2:28:00] line he' stopped and say what am I doing
[2:28:02] right right but he held a a a he held a
[2:28:06] reasonable conversation with an
[2:28:09] animal and then God opened his eyes you
[2:28:11] know your animal has been more spiritual
[2:28:13] than
[2:28:15] you and he saved your life now so this
[2:28:18] is a strange part of the scripture he
[2:28:20] saved your life I stopped you cuz you're
[2:28:23] going against the people that I had
[2:28:25] blessed but now go ahead and
[2:28:27] go it's so strange he stopped him he's
[2:28:30] going to remind
[2:28:31] him these are my young people I know
[2:28:33] they're getting a little tired and I
[2:28:34] know the service is getting long but you
[2:28:36] know what they're going to learn to like
[2:28:43] church if your phones could tell
[2:28:47] you how long you've looked at it on
[2:28:50] average every day I wonder what it say
[2:28:52] about how long well anyway
[2:28:57] [Music]
[2:28:59] anyway your phone said you have prayed
[2:29:02] for 20 hours this
[2:29:06] week you have listened to five
[2:29:10] messages wow you're quiet wow wow we are
[2:29:14] right on target drop the bomb amen
[2:29:21] but on average your phone amen has told
[2:29:23] you amen you have read me today 8 hours
[2:29:25] and 36 minutes and 20
[2:29:30] seconds I know none of you do
[2:29:35] that so he goes
[2:29:38] up Amen to to find amen because of the
[2:29:43] new offer he's going to go up and do
[2:29:46] what the bidding of this nation is and
[2:29:49] that is to
[2:29:50] curse of people who God has
[2:29:54] blessed now folks all in the room I want
[2:29:56] you to look
[2:29:57] around and I want you to see who set in
[2:30:00] here even those you got ought
[2:30:04] against if God has said he's blessed
[2:30:09] them and the first blessing is he
[2:30:12] brought you under the sound of the
[2:30:15] Gospel no man can come except my father
[2:30:18] draws him
[2:30:21] you better be very careful how you speak
[2:30:23] about one
[2:30:25] another whom God has blessed because I
[2:30:29] read in my Bible he is the same
[2:30:30] yesterday today and forever and he
[2:30:32] doesn't change and if he under the blood
[2:30:34] of bulls and goats would stand up for a
[2:30:36] people and say I know what they have
[2:30:39] done but I'm going to
[2:30:45] choose oh you forgot the god that is
[2:30:48] alive this message is not just quotes
[2:30:51] and a powerful preacher the God I know
[2:30:56] yes now you're going to go up there and

[2:31:14] show you exactly what you can find out
[2:31:16] about this church that you can curse

[2:32:52] upon a
[2:32:53] people and that Spirit isn't dead it's
[2:32:55] not dead right now that spirit's in this
[2:32:58] church his spirits in every message
[2:33:00] church it's against the people of God it
[2:33:02] wants to find the weak place and then
[2:33:05] begin to talk about the weak
[2:33:08] place as if the word has no power and
[2:33:11] these people will not change it and they
[2:33:13] don't do nothing from the pulpit about
[2:33:15] it and they allow them to sit there and
[2:33:17] that kind of come on people
[2:33:20] looking at me like
[2:33:27] that so bam get b balum gets up there

[2:34:18] in adultery and this one over here he he
[2:34:20] did this and and this one over here he
[2:34:21] said something against the pastor and
[2:34:23] this one over here left the church and
[2:34:24] tried to pull others out of the church
[2:34:25] and this one over here ah I got a lot of
[2:34:29] ammunition you look just like the
[2:34:32] children of
[2:34:33] Israel you're in the same
[2:34:36] body subject to
[2:34:41] senses he you're
[2:34:46] quiet and he looked and the ERS were
[2:34:49] prepared and the Bible says the Lord put
[2:34:51] a word in balam's mouth and said return
[2:34:54] unto Bao and thus shall you speak and he
[2:34:57] returned and he stood by the the burnt
[2:34:59] sacrifice and there stood all the
[2:35:02] princes of Egypt beside him get ready
[2:35:05] get
[2:35:06] ready and he looked and he
[2:35:12] said Bao said come curse me Jacob and
[2:35:17] defy Israel and here bam says Bao has
[2:35:21] told me to curse you but

[2:35:59] and tell
[2:36:05] them how can I
[2:36:09] curse whom God hath blessed
[2:36:15] hallelu it don't make no sense to me
[2:36:17] brother Danny
[2:36:21] cuz I see a people who should be
[2:36:23] destroyed and God says I'm going to
[2:36:26] bless
[2:36:27] him how can I defy whom the Lord has not
[2:36:31] defied trying to help you young people
[2:36:34] God has seen everywhere you have been
[2:36:36] that's
[2:36:39] right but if he shall speak to you again
[2:36:42] yes Hallelujah yes you stand up and you
[2:36:48] answer that voice
[2:36:51] he knows you've tried to
[2:36:54] quit God knows your
[2:36:58] heart how shall I
[2:37:00] curse whom God has
[2:37:06] blessed for from the top of the Rocks I
[2:37:09] see
[2:37:10] them and from the hills I Behold Him Lo
[2:37:14] the people shall dwell alone and shall
[2:37:17] not be reckoned among the
[2:37:20] Nations you know bic is starting to have
[2:37:23] a panic attack he says that's not what I
[2:37:25] want you to tell that
[2:37:27] church I want you to get up and tell
[2:37:29] them well you know this Minister has
[2:37:30] left and that Minister has left and this
[2:37:33] congregation these friends are leaving
[2:37:34] and you know this message is not true I
[2:37:36] want you to tell them that and you're
[2:37:39] not doing it you're not bringing out all
[2:37:40] the faults of the message instead you're
[2:37:42] saying God has blessed this
[2:37:47] people and I don't understand
[2:37:50] it go back and say another word surely
[2:37:53] you message you're you got a deeper
[2:37:55] Ministry than that so he comes back he
[2:37:58] said I know more about them and he takes
[2:38:01] them to another place if if if if your
[2:38:05] life was unruled before everybody in
[2:38:07] here and every thought that you've ever
[2:38:10] had and every failing that you ever had
[2:38:13] you would hang your head and you would
[2:38:15] walk on
[2:38:16] out amen but here God says he a man that
[2:38:20] he should not lie neither the son of man
[2:38:23] that he should repent hath he said and
[2:38:25] shall he not do it or hath he spoken and
[2:38:26] shall he not make it good behold I have
[2:38:29] received commandment to bless and he has
[2:38:31] blessed and I
[2:38:34] cannot
[2:38:36] that's even if I wanted to amen I cannot
[2:38:41] reverse
[2:38:42] it hallah amen he has not beheld
[2:38:47] iniquity
[2:38:50] heyy I'm want to tell you something
[2:38:51] about the king I serve I'm going to tell
[2:38:53] you about something about the shadow of
[2:38:54] the king that's in this Camp I'm going
[2:38:56] to tell you something about there's a
[2:38:57] prophet in the camp there is a king in
[2:38:59] the camp the shout of the king is in the
[2:39:03] camp amen the shout of the king is in
[2:39:06] the camp the brass serpent amen Divine
[2:39:09] Healing it's all here this evening it's
[2:39:13] already in the
[2:39:14] camp and I want to tell you about the
[2:39:17] king I serve I seen all that you have
[2:39:21] told me but I choose not to look at them
[2:39:25] that
[2:39:28] way I want to say it again it's not
[2:39:32] because you didn't do it I just don't
[2:39:35] see
[2:39:37] it you're not getting it I'm going to
[2:39:39] tell you again John would say amen he
[2:39:43] that says he has no sin he's a lion but
[2:39:46] he writes in the same book he that says
[2:39:49] he sins he's a
[2:39:51] liar no he didn't say it that way I
[2:39:53] quoted it
[2:39:54] wrong he that hath the seed of God in
[2:39:57] him cannot
[2:39:58] sin and the same John Roose said you
[2:40:01] don't sin you
[2:40:03] lie so what kind of God is that it's a
[2:40:06] God that
[2:40:07] chose to look at you one specific way
[2:40:11] and that was through the blood of Jesus
[2:40:12] Christ brother Jackson if I look at you
[2:40:15] through the blood I can't even see you
[2:40:18] amen if if I look at you through the
[2:40:20] blood I can't even see
[2:40:24] you I just want to tell you something
[2:40:27] more even more
[2:40:29] great God
[2:40:32] said here's what a God said through a
[2:40:35] prophet God said through a prophet he
[2:40:38] says you can't even
[2:40:41] fall before
[2:40:43] God he said but before men you can fall
[2:40:48] and so here's stands balum and he's
[2:40:50] looking before men and men are showing
[2:40:53] him you've done this and you have done
[2:40:55] this and you have done this and you have
[2:40:57] done this and you have done this amen
[2:40:59] and God says now look at it through my
[2:41:02] eyes oh the challenge young people
[2:41:04] tonight is to look at it God's way I
[2:41:08] want to show you how God sees me I speak

[2:41:59] this
[2:41:59] before ah then you knew he was that all
[2:42:02] the
[2:42:03] time and then what is he going to do
[2:42:05] when a greater power walks in the room
[2:42:07] and he just looks at that old Ling
[2:42:09] spirit and he goes like
[2:42:13] this

[2:42:20] tell you one more
[2:42:22] thing I want to tell you one more thing

[2:42:28] to the devil hallu once my soul was
[2:42:33] astray from the Heavenly way I started
[2:42:39] too high
[2:42:42] amen and then what did he do when he
[2:42:45] reached yes down his
[2:42:49] he didn't have to say a word he came
[2:42:51] down and did
[2:42:53] it so I want to tell the devil tonight
[2:42:57] how can you curse whom God has
[2:43:00] blessed how can you say these young
[2:43:03] people won't make it when God said I've

[2:43:13] I've already seen you over there
[2:43:19] I sent you a prophet I sent you a
[2:43:22] prophet who went beyond the curtain of
[2:43:25] time and he came
[2:43:27] back and he said I saw you
[2:43:37] there oh let me say one thing
[2:43:40] else I know we get so loud sometimes we
[2:43:43] don't hear what's being
[2:43:44] preached I want to say one thing else if
[2:43:47] God before us
[2:43:53] yes hey if God is for you what's going
[2:43:58] to stop
[2:44:00] you huh Here Comes The
[2:44:04] Devil not you
[2:44:06] me hey buddy you'd make a good running
[2:44:09] back for the Dallas
[2:44:15] Cowboys and God
[2:44:18] says you'd make a better witness for
[2:44:21] me than you could do with a contract of
[2:44:24] $200 million and break every record in
[2:44:26] the NFL book I won't remember them come
[2:44:29] on but if you stand for me amen I'll
[2:44:33] stand for
[2:44:37] you I got a
[2:44:40] God I got a God said you stand for me
[2:44:43] I'll stand for you here's the devil
[2:44:46] looking at you Eli and he said I see
[2:44:48] things in your life I can curse you over
[2:44:50] and then God
[2:44:51] says but I chose to bless
[2:44:59] him how did he bless me he put a deep
[2:45:02] calling to the deep in my heart how did
[2:45:04] he bless me he sent a word that answered
[2:45:06] that deep the only word that could not a
[2:45:08] Baptist word not a Lutheran word not a
[2:45:11] Pentecostal word amen but the word of
[2:45:15] God then he sent his spirit in there to
[2:45:18] confirm it
[2:45:22] he chose to bless
[2:45:24] me when I could have easily been
[2:45:26] cursed he chose to bless
[2:45:30] me so if God be for me who can be
[2:45:34] against me I want to speak about one
[2:45:35] more condition and I'll
[2:45:38] close there was a little
[2:45:40] woman who fell into spiritual
[2:45:43] Amnesia she got to a place in her
[2:45:46] life she didn't even think she had the
[2:45:48] Holy Ghost
[2:45:49] and if she looked in her life she didn't
[2:45:51] know that she even had an
[2:45:54] experience so she wanted to have a
[2:45:55] private interview with brother
[2:45:59] Brown and that interview is not
[2:46:03] long she began to talk to brother brand
[2:46:05] said there's no place in my life I can
[2:46:08] put a foot
[2:46:09] on to say that I've got
[2:46:13] it will you bear with me just a
[2:46:15] minute I begin to look at that
[2:46:19] so it just seemed like I was impressed
[2:46:21] to my heart just go look that woman
[2:46:25] up go look her up because all we know is
[2:46:29] pretty much is the private interview of
[2:46:30] sister Bruce sister Georgia
[2:46:33] Bruce so I went Brother David and I
[2:46:35] looked it
[2:46:36] up you know five years before that and
[2:46:39] then then many times the name the time
[2:46:42] that her name is mentioned God had
[2:46:43] healed her of cancer years before but
[2:46:46] the times her name is mentioned it's
[2:46:48] always she's given a prayer request for
[2:46:49] someone
[2:46:51] else has a need and she's standing for
[2:46:56] him and five years before this
[2:47:00] interview in the message images of
[2:47:03] Christ brother Brandon begins to speak
[2:47:05] he said here's a woman sitting here
[2:47:09] praying she's a
[2:47:13] warrior and I know her but I can't help
[2:47:16] because that light is hanging over her
[2:47:20] that's Mrs
[2:47:24] Bruce five years later Sister Georgia
[2:47:28] Bruce says brother
[2:47:30] brandom most of all I want the
[2:47:33] experience that I've been
[2:47:35] sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will
[2:47:39] reveal it to your heart what has
[2:47:41] happened to Sister
[2:47:43] Bruce you see the spirit of
[2:47:46] balum still trying to drive a wedge
[2:47:51] between God's
[2:47:52] people and the Vindicated
[2:47:55] word and trying to cause you to doubt
[2:47:57] that he'll stand for
[2:48:00] you and that he'll carry out what he
[2:48:03] said he would do Weston don't you ever
[2:48:07] forget God will never fail
[2:48:10] you I want to tell you something I tell
[2:48:13] you something we sing a song wrong never
[2:48:16] fail me yet what do you mean yet
[2:48:20] when you say yet it means he
[2:48:23] can I just want to sing another song
[2:48:26] Jesus never
[2:48:31] fails
[2:48:35] never when he says no to me it's as good
[2:48:39] as my yes as his
[2:48:41] yeses Jesus knows
[2:48:45] best you know I've had people say I just
[2:48:48] want to I just want to be comfortable in
[2:48:49] life I just want to be comfortable I
[2:48:51] just want to be comfortable and God says
[2:48:52] I don't want you to be
[2:48:56] comfortable why do you want to be
[2:48:59] comfortable what's wrong with
[2:49:02] uncomfortable nobody saying
[2:49:06] amen you know if you asked God and God
[2:49:08] answered your prayer right away and you
[2:49:10] asked him again he answered your prayer
[2:49:11] right away and you asked him again he
[2:49:13] answered your prayer right you go around
[2:49:15] oh boy I got
[2:49:16] faith then you pray
[2:49:19] and then you pray then you pray and then
[2:49:22] maybe a preacher come along and say well
[2:49:23] the reason it's not happen because you
[2:49:24] don't have any faith well I'm just sorry
[2:49:27] I disagree with
[2:49:29] that cuz his nose is just as good as his
[2:49:34] yeses but real faith is not having every
[2:49:37] prayer answered real faith is standing
[2:49:40] when everything is gone wrong real
[2:49:44] Faith sister stat Cliff asked brother
[2:49:46] brandom after holding up her dead baby
[2:49:48] for days over there in that hospital in
[2:49:50] Germany brother Brandon the reason you
[2:49:52] didn't raise it from the dead raise it
[2:49:53] from the dead because wasn't my lack of
[2:49:56] faith brother bam says no you had real
[2:50:00] Faith anybody can have faith when
[2:50:03] everything's going the one
[2:50:05] way but when everything's going wrong
[2:50:08] and you still
[2:50:10] believe when you still stand upon the
[2:50:13] word and you you go back down
[2:50:19] that's my
[2:50:21] [Applause]
[2:50:25] God I just want to know that I've been
[2:50:27] sealed with the Holy Ghost here saying
[2:50:29] such a Vindicated Prophet I believe
[2:50:31] sister Bruce that Bruce with all my
[2:50:33] heart I believe with all my heart that
[2:50:34] you're a real Born Again believer sister
[2:50:36] Bruce how could that Spirit just
[2:50:42] leave now she feels she doesn't have it
[2:50:49] and I'm not trying to tell people who
[2:50:51] don't have it you have
[2:50:52] it but I'm talking about a woman a real
[2:50:55] Warrior
[2:50:57] yeah who now is fallen in
[2:51:00] battle she's got these mind battles and
[2:51:04] Satan is pointing out her
[2:51:06] failures I can't find a place I'm
[2:51:09] sealed and he says how could the spirit
[2:51:12] just leave when you get
[2:51:15] sick you get weary and you're nervous
[2:51:18] type person sister Bruce says yes and
[2:51:20] you get things on your mind little bitty
[2:51:23] things how about you little bitty things
[2:51:27] and it just keeps building up and both
[2:51:29] ways you got somebody in your heart you
[2:51:30] want to pray for them and you you get up
[2:51:32] and pray for it you can't rest till you
[2:51:33] get that person prayed for that's you
[2:51:36] then take the other side Satan might
[2:51:38] present something another out this way
[2:51:41] see and then God you have your your
[2:51:42] nature and God works and Satan works and
[2:51:45] then when Satan tries to make you
[2:51:46] believe that you are not
[2:51:50] see that
[2:51:51] war there's many a find people that look
[2:51:55] the part but set in bondage because
[2:51:59] Satan has done this to
[2:52:03] them I got to ask you a question why are
[2:52:06] you
[2:52:11] here why didn't you just give up why
[2:52:14] didn't you just throw in the towel
[2:52:22] well I don't feel
[2:52:23] him that don't mean he's not
[2:52:29] there Satan's trying to make you believe
[2:52:31] that you're not and you keep building
[2:52:33] this up and maybe and don't look at
[2:52:36] yourself sister
[2:52:40] Bruce oh Satan does everything he can to
[2:52:43] make you look at yourself when you look
[2:52:46] at yourself you say I can't overcome
[2:52:49] uhhuh and you're just like your phone I
[2:52:52] fell eight hours
[2:52:57] today maybe some of you fell on Monday
[2:52:59] Tuesday Wednesday and
[2:53:01] Thursday that was a tabulation of
[2:53:04] it my wife why are you
[2:53:07] here is there
[2:53:11] hope you see there's a phone going off
[2:53:22] I'm fixing to pray for you and I'm not
[2:53:25] worthy of
[2:53:27] that and I think what would I do if
[2:53:30] Jesus Christ was sitting here right now
[2:53:33] what would he do if he was here he'd lay
[2:53:34] his hands upon you with his great faith
[2:53:36] you'd get well and I'd think and I think
[2:53:39] well I'm a sinner and I'm not him but I
[2:53:41] come to represent
[2:53:44] him and I'm just doing the same thing
[2:53:47] tonight amen I come to represent
[2:53:50] him but remember me being a sinner and
[2:53:54] before God me being a sinner and before
[2:53:59] God I'm not a
[2:54:03] sinner neither are
[2:54:05] you cause we have a blood sacrifice
[2:54:08] laying there and God doesn't even see
[2:54:13] [Applause]
[2:54:15] us he hears our voice
[2:54:19] but he sees the blood of
[2:54:24] Christ he sees the blood of his own son
[2:54:27] it's our voice Christ's blood then it's
[2:54:31] Christ that's talking through us to God
[2:54:36] so therefore we're not Sinners no
[2:54:39] more we are
[2:54:42] [Applause]
[2:54:46] Christian sister Bruce says but I've
[2:54:48] made so many
[2:54:50] mistakes and I fail so many times you
[2:54:55] know what we get wrong is when we try to
[2:54:58] present a super duper
[2:55:03] Christianity brother Braham said if you
[2:55:05] see super duper and everybody somebody
[2:55:07] has all the answers and is always right
[2:55:09] he says you get away from that
[2:55:12] person that's
[2:55:14] right amen she said I make so many
[2:55:17] mistakes I fail so many times that's why
[2:55:19] Christ had to die so that you with your
[2:55:22] mistakes wouldn't be allotted to
[2:55:26] you so he took your mistakes your desire
[2:55:30] in your heart is to serve him sister
[2:55:32] Bruce says
[2:55:34] yes that's why he died so you could
[2:55:37] serve him your mistakes are not allotted
[2:55:41] to
[2:55:44] you see he is your perpetuation he is
[2:55:48] your sin offering your sins are not
[2:55:53] known
[2:55:54] Hallelujah hey this is a youth meeting
[2:55:57] but you other Elder ones should amen you
[2:55:59] should reply to that as well your sins
[2:56:01] are not
[2:56:03] known then why in the world would I
[2:56:06] bring yours
[2:56:10] up that's as if they could not be
[2:56:13] forgiven
[2:56:19] Christ took your sins and became you
[2:56:21] because your desire is to serve him
[2:56:23] sister Bruce says' but I've never had an
[2:56:25] experience that I've been filled with
[2:56:26] the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot
[2:56:28] on all right notice this ordinarily a
[2:56:30] human being is born in sin shaped in
[2:56:32] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[2:56:34] that's the nature of a human being
[2:56:36] Sister Bruce says yes that was your
[2:56:38] nature it changed once what changed it
[2:56:43] she goes Christ you see how God's
[2:56:45] leading her he's leading her to say what
[2:56:48] he he he has done I don't I don't have
[2:56:51] an experience I I can put my foot upon
[2:56:54] all right you was a nature once and now
[2:56:55] you're nature changed who did that she
[2:56:57] says Christ well wait a minute you just
[2:57:00] said isn't it amazing that God is
[2:57:03] getting her to look at herself the way
[2:57:07] he sees
[2:57:09] her and if I can accomplish one thing

[3:11:04] this it's all I
[3:11:06] knew then I did the greatest thing that
[3:11:11] I've ever done in my
[3:11:12] life and this is the
[3:11:15] reason that so many of you you young
[3:11:17] people don't keep the
[3:11:21] Victory and I'm going to tell you this
[3:11:23] from years of
[3:11:26] experience whether you feel I'm wise or
[3:11:29] not it don't matter but I'll tell you
[3:11:31] the reason you lose your experiences you
[3:11:35] don't read your
[3:11:42] Bibles you get told Who You Are
[3:11:47] you believe it you're glad that it's
[3:11:51] away from you your past gets washed from
[3:11:55] you and you jump up and you have a great
[3:12:00] joy but you don't know how to keep going
[3:12:05] on and you have to
[3:12:07] feed to go
[3:12:11] on you're old enough to learn algebra
[3:12:14] you're old enough to learn geography
[3:12:16] they start teaching you foreign
[3:12:18] languages when you're in third grade
[3:12:20] you're old enough to read your Bible and
[3:12:23] you're old enough to listen to
[3:12:29] tapes it'll change
[3:12:33] you you know what changed
[3:12:37] me someone told me why don't you just
[3:12:39] read the Bible if you're so
[3:12:45] miserable I went and I open my bible to
[3:12:49] Romans chapter
[3:12:52] 1 and I started reading my life
[3:12:57] story right in front of my
[3:13:00] eyes I I begin to read what it said here
[3:13:05] it said and it says for this cause God
[3:13:09] gave them up to vile affections for even
[3:13:12] their women did change the natural use
[3:13:15] unto the use against nature and likewise
[3:13:18] also the men leaving the natural use of
[3:13:21] the woman burned in their lust one
[3:13:23] towards another man with man working
[3:13:26] that which is unseemingly and received
[3:13:29] into thems a recompense of their Heir
[3:13:32] which was man and even as they did not
[3:13:36] like to retain God in their
[3:13:40] knowledge God gave them over to a
[3:13:42] reprobate mind to do those things which
[3:13:45] are not convenient
[3:13:47] and being filled with all
[3:13:50] unrighteousness
[3:13:51] fornication wickedness covetousness
[3:13:55] malice full of Envy murder debate
[3:14:00] deceit malignity and whisperings
[3:14:03] backbiters haters of God despisers proud
[3:14:07] boasters invention of evil things
[3:14:10] disobedient to Parents Without
[3:14:14] understanding Covenant Breakers without
[3:14:17] natural affections in
[3:14:21] inflexible
[3:14:23] unmerciful who knowing that the Judgment
[3:14:25] of God that they which commit such
[3:14:28] things are worthy of death not only
[3:14:31] doing the same but having pleasure in
[3:14:34] them that do them there I
[3:14:39] was that's who I was sitting
[3:14:43] with that's what I was surrounded with
[3:14:47] and then I went and ra read another
[3:14:52] verse and it was such a beautiful
[3:14:55] verse as I just kept reading down and it
[3:15:03] says it says oh despises thou The Riches
[3:15:08] of his
[3:15:09] goodness and his
[3:15:12] forebearance and
[3:15:14] longsuffering not knowing that the

[3:15:59] God that led me to
[3:16:02] repentance it was

[3:39:52] you to give your
[3:39:55] life to
[3:39:58] him and once you give your life to
