daughter of god bless the remaining of the service lord even for the needs that were brought before you lord i i pray for the co-worker brother robert lord in the situation that was unspoken request for sister rebecca lord lord you're the discerner of the heart and you know all things from the beginning and we know that everything that you allow to happen is for a purpose and for it's for a reason and the only reason is for you to develop the character that we need to have to overcome to to get to the other side lord so i prayed that you just go by and your word could deliver and your

administer to us again we ask it in your precious and wonderful name we pray amen and amen hallelujah we've asked our brother we don't get him here very often so i asked him to preach again tonight and uh so i i enjoy it you know i was thinking brother dan i was thinking on the way to church i saw for you know a sold sign and you know that's why we build those houses is to get them sold and when that sold signs there it means it's not available anymore and i thought you know i want to wear a sold sign right i i i so i just got a big sign on me that says sold because somebody purchased me somebody bought me somebody's the new owner somebody now has possession of this place it's no longer available it's no longer for sale it's no longer for occupancy nobody else can come here somebody's claimed it aren't you glad he bought you hey man amen i got to even thinking a little bit more well you know sometimes you buy something and it's got some bugs and termites and things in it and needs fixing but the owner takes care of that he gets all the bugs out he gets all the termites out he fixes all the bad places and he gets it just the way that he wants it amen we may not be what we want to be we may not be what we ought to be but we sure ain't what we used to be amen you believe that so let's just invite our brother back again this evening to minister the word to us and let's uh sing that uh of course amazing grace once again as we invite our brother to come amen [Music] [Music] me [Music] run down [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's a privilege for us once again to be here tonight i'd like to recommend every children into your hands rather we didn't look at the tiredness of the day foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] ourselves [Music] in the name of jesus christ let's read acts chapter 2 verse 37. school now when they had heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto peter and to the rest of the apostle men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost [Music] for the promises unto you and unto your children and and to all of all that are far off and even as many as our lord god shall call could you be like may the lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats i would like to just uh brush off a subject that's very important for our believers and the reason why i'm touching this subject that's great and important in the scriptures because you couldn't receive the holy ghost of the pastor if you don't know what it is and you wouldn't receive it if you if you don't know it which it was given to you and it's for you even and you cannot receive them unless you know what result he will the holy ghost will produce if you can understand these three things correctly you will contend yourself or you will be happy with a substitute or with an imitation when this gospel will be preaching the whole world as to be a testimony of me then the end will come when when the gospel will be preached in all the world what does that mean it doesn't mean to spread out literatures alire to send missionaries to send missionaries here and there to teach people how to read and how to write and to try to distribute some thoughts about the bible and to bring people to an understanding that is in existence of a god if that's all that you need in order to spread the gospel i love jesus and then that means jesus already come and the end has already come back to life because all the literatures all the the teachings and all the things that's been sent in all the world already but paul says that the gospel didn't come by words only with power and demonstration of the holy ghost then when jesus said that go and to show who god is and what he's capable of doing glory be to our lord to demonstrate the power of god the power of the gospel to take the word montreal that's how people can follow the word as something of a match substance no one has the right to preach the gospel unless he is first sanctified of the worries and the things of the world people go in all the world legends they themselves full of all the worries of the world and all kinds of things in the self person defense they don't know how to take care of them but they stand before people so they can preach them the good news that themselves need contrast that's the contrast of the paradox that's the paradox and that kind of uh uh gospel napoleoni will not bring anything and see in focus and those people have to come to a place where those things are taken off of them so they can bring a living gospel to the people and if you have people like that in your point there are no there is no unbelievers in your point of psychology there won't be any uh psychology justification there is no justification yeah there there are no scholars in the world that can stop that kind of gospel that person was there by experience when that happened he knows what happened and he knows what he's talking about satan's not remember that's how our prophet could be justified and to have a uh somewhat of an understanding of every individual who's born again says and i believe he says i believe now that the blessings will follow the believers are you a believer then blessings have to follow you in all the moments of life in the highest and the lows you are a woman or a man or a woman who's blessed regardless of the fights regardless of the things that comes uh uh uh against me malchet constance regardless of all the circumstances around me that i never been sorry to be a christian and i believe it's the same with every single one of you jesus oh the chimes have ringed in my heart since jesus came and entered into my heart genesis i never been able to express it it's it's a grace it's a it's a it's a joy that can never be expressed and full of glory guarding us being a reality you're not going to be today at the mountaintop and tomorrow down in the valley and defeated you will always be happy regardless of what happened happy because everything all things work together for the good of them they love him you will always hold to the right regardless of what happens you will always hold to the right the apostle paul says it can never be defeated you believe that parliament speaking of the holy ghost is to touch on the one of the most significant and important subject for every believer then there's also a difference andre and critical professing to be a believer a christian he makes a lot of noise that are centered upon himself he's uh he's pretentious he doesn't have the fear of god you can observe that a christian who believes is something and he's able to do a lot of things he talks a lot nepal can't do he doesn't have the fear of god explicit he knows how to explain everything and he wants to be listened by everybody that's not the christianity no prophet a prophet a prophet one time distributed glenn this is a leader he was talking i was uh debating or uh discussing with his uh friend brother levi believe he don't initial the sentence about the initial evidence of the holy ghost they found that the the most evident uh evidence of the holy ghost sila move was love see [Music] it's not a ministry with a specialized or determined calling judas judas had a specialized and defined calling yeah seymour so i can't follow him he knew the day and she looked doctor and that when the holy ghost will come upon you he will remind you the things that i have taught you and it will tell you of things that are to come and that's what the true evidence of the holy ghost it's to be able to believe the word and to receive it to have a heart that's constantly burning for the word fatigue not to be tired and to stay home this morning the church was full there was no space mr swan but tonight the room is almost empty leave those dissented the evidence of the holy ghost to the world and something [Music] loyal and they can come and ask themselves a question the ones that can come in to even doubt about themselves she's sick in some unreality in what they are in reality just to pretend the cornell sentence not to come to uh some type of uh guessing that you have the holy ghost but you you you you come to the understanding by looking at the word the word in regards to the life that you are leaving yourself first second circle because everyone we know you you know yourself okay if we can come to that questioning we can receive the holy ghost in very little time just like in pentecost they didn't have a series of meetings just one meeting down you know tens of minutes in about 15 minutes and everyone was baptized with the holy ghost it not think about it english you know like the world warnings in a note no it's not you're having all your tears and all everything coming out that's good i saw that in the line in the prayer line people were crying it's yellow they were removing the snow basket because they wanted something you understand that and the true birth it's always a mess it's always a mess right lupus the you cannot bring someone to see the word of god unless his nature is changed the seculity are and the holy ghost gets in him when he sees the word if he sees the words and this battle now is for him to bring his life in line with the word vascular sentence because the holy ghost is the author of the word he will tie you to the word you don't make any efforts regardless of your weaknesses you'll find out that regardless of that you have to leave what the word says yes the anointing that they feel during the preaching atmosphere when they see an atmosphere boiling atmosphere when people are screaming what they see when they see signs and wonders following their ministry zone shows they think they have the thing they will not understand this message because this message it's god himself to message this message cecilia's sentence your prophet says totally manifestation of the benediction all the manifestation of the blessings it's not the uh it's not the evidence of the holy ghost no no no it's not you don't have to vent yourself or to lift yourself up for those manifestations because you that's his career because judas is carrying it honestly he had oh he had also those manifestations regardless of what he has to do that people may may be with him or not he will stand with the bible you have to remember that the bible is the truth and the truth or will set you free that's exactly what jesus said i cannot necessarily tell you that the prophet says this in this book but i'm preaching to you what he said what branham says it was also the answer to matthew uh chapter 7 verse 21 to 23. those that will say lord lord no they will not enter into the kingdom of god but only those that will do the will of my father who's in the heaven and the will of the father is his word many will say unto me that day lord lord prophet have we not prophesy by your name in your name not in the name of burnham no but in your name openly jesus didn't deny that they did the wonderful signs and things that only people can do that are led by that [Music] um [Music] producing miracles by the power of the holy ghost and they were lifting themselves up with them what comes with you oh when i come let me rock the mirror you will see what god is going to do have you ever seen jesus do that uh sicilian and that's why manifestation we cannot pretend that the manifestation is the proof that you are born of the spirit wrong plea the spirit fulfilled with the spirit no miss you no no no mister zurich manifestation i recognize that the true manifestation ella proved the sentence completely is the proof that the holy ghost can do powerful works messenger land dvd but it's not to prove that the individual esprit is filled with a spirit meme dvds even if that individual who said the manifestation on abundance uh here's the manifestation in abundance because [Music] he let his rain fall on the just and the angels he's god in this sovereignty the evidence that we have the holy ghost is to be able they're always uh nourishing or feeding the white dogs regardless of what the person done don't have negative thinking about that person pray for the person it's the it's the the the right or the duty that we have come for the video when when you have a wrong thinking you will produce wrong answers think right s your duty for god if as you say used to and act right it's your duty to yourself and when you think right good thinking [Music] come if someone victor say something bad about you say something good if you cannot do say something good about them don't say anything you will keep yourself pure [Music] you will be connected with god listen to that just let things go by if you have nothing good to say about it i'll sit and then let's go let's sell and when you are by yourself pre opposite person pray for that person if there's something in my life that helped me understood that the holy ghost came unto me that day it was that flaming um i was i was on fire i was uh impulsive i was impulsive if something happened i'll try to react right away i was uh irish of two parents it was almost impossible for me to eat karma because my mouth was full of wounds bitten by somebody explosion i would explode if i was not able to do it sansa reeves it comes to us most times men don't live for you even in the house next blue zipper don't explode [Music] [Music] i have some teeth that are taken out and some that have been screwed in parallel i spoke where i was supposed i was not supposed to supposed to speak to you designers i always had problems continues when he's thinking about these things it was sufficient and to see his life changed he could realize with assurance that he had the holy ghost the sentence maybe it's your case with explosive can i really become a christian she will provide a new creation yes you can become a christian used to cross section of jesus just to believe what's been said here to accept it we become what we eat and everything is going to change i was saying i can never be a christian but let me tell you who are you on the ohio avenue avenue when the holy ghost came to me it answered the question about being mad and we know that being mad that is of the devil we know that that uh getting mad is of the devil is that true and often time we get madonna in accepting what's being spoken here because it's the holy ghost speaking i was saying i said it's something i was born with even if your father was getting mad all the time even if your mother had temper you know you you it's not something you inherit it's gonna go god knew you before the foundation of the world individual and it's an individual affair and today do you ever met referee god will remove the temple i was saying oh me my father was was was impulsive he kept she has enough uh temper to fight the buzzing saw and whoever will attack me will have more than what he wants he's looking for and i said if i have to go on the ladder to get to them i will do that no but now but when we let christ come into us and it's going to be him living in us him he doesn't have a temper they they crashed they they they threw a a spit on him he didn't react [Music] is that something may happen tonight to every one of us it is certified presence it says this old power service and that gives me compassion for my enemies enemies but here we pray for our name is to be punished no no people could do it pray that god may open their eyes that they may see what kind of road you were walking on okay a christian doesn't have enemies people will treat us like enemies i'm not praying that something bad may happen to them i pray in their favor you see why we need the holy ghost it's to do the things that we cannot do a unifor absolute sentence and we have to have the holy ghost illusion speech and the holy ghost sid you it's god and god is the word the sentence be the holy ghost is what goes out of my mouth the word of god listen to speech the holy ghost is it paul plain confirming it it's the word vindicated sentence the holy ghost is what brings this promised life uh word to life listen now unifor a cesare and it was it was it was it was it was there ruling over a hundred uh a court italian court unconfirmed this man was in conference with god and on the other side of chopra simon pierre simon peter he was staying at the at the at the at the place of simon the the courier in whom house was next to the the sea s and simon peter went on to the roof so he could speak to god now cornelius was in conference with god and the other side peter was also in conference with god and then god came and visited with uh cornelius he asked him to go and find peter to bring good news to his house in the other side remember the same god i pre-appeared he came and he spoke to peter by a vision [Music] to not look at anybody as impure or or or um unclean you know those scriptures i'm just trying to brush the story the holy ghost came to bring to life the word in in whom the word of god came and abided whereas or heard the word of god being preached the feminism and the message of william it's a supernatural it's a message that god that god himself is bringing through this vessel and our desire and when we stand up here is to bring every uh every man and every woman to be a face or a a channel parlo que lucentes pries by which the holy ghost and it's you that god is waiting on so he could use so the church could be blessed and now let me tell you something that brother branham said you are you christians are here don't ever stop even one second because of the devil the devil is there looking for us the devil is there all over trying to talk to us he's there uh moving and going around us but the prophet said you christians that are here you know you just have to believe god over here you see but all i know is to believe them because he said them and i have seen him confirm a lot of things that no man can do and she just said then i know that the word the message is true in particular regardless of what people do with the message the message remains pure we cannot uh now i'm finishing difference don't let the indifference don't let the the reasoning or the critical spirit become your state yeah the young kid even in different with people becoming different they always have something to criticize it becomes their state of being when you meet him when he opens his mouth it's not edifying to you don't listen to that just believe what god said because it's the truth the the holy ghost will lead you onto all righteousness unexamined in examining your as a christian you know where it's not okay i don't know the pastor in the light of the world he don't let those evil spirit come upon you and and uh to bring you into a state where you become mad don't don't have uh uh bitterness in your heart the african universe so he can lack his holy spirit and to come in there's your crown and i believe the sentence that the holy ghost is here in his power is the husband who's able is this marvelous man is here [Music] god is able that we may place ourselves under the blood of the lord jesus christ this message of the hour and believe because it says that under the message of the hour all our sins are purified i believe i i invite our pastor right now may the hand of the lord be with you as you have your hand lifted up the pastor will pray for you you love the lord you know have you ever had that sense that somebody's watching you and or you can feel that somebody's near the holy spirit's a person he's got a nature he's got a spirit we don't go by feelings but you can feel his presence you can know when he's near and he comes near then you need to invite him in closer and and and and let that let him let him in don't be afraid to worship don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone don't don't be afraid to invite him because he wants to be there he said i'll not leave you nor forsake you but i personal pronoun will be with you even in you till the end and i'd i i can't agree more with my brother in just simply saying that it's something you can make contact with you know you it's like you have it but you can still contact it it's a it's it's a wonderful thing the spirit of god and it's what it's what we need so don't become uh don't don't hold back you know when you feel him near invite him in ask him to fill you ask him to be good in your life would you help me sing a song billy just worship just well just take a moment to worship him and you take a moment to and invite him in to have them come closer to you and and just open your heart up and we you don't need a sensation but you know it's not you [Music] sing it like [Music] my [Music] take a drink from the fountain [Music] come into my heart in my life [Music] soul lord i love your spirit on me fill my cup again me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] on me [Music] [Music] don't you invite him to pressure [Music] yes [Music] my [Music] is oh [Music] i want to be [Music] i'm surrendered i'll take you over [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he works in unexpected ways unexpected times but there's something about the presence of the lord when he comes that's when you surrender you stop and you acknowledge him you say lord i i know you're near me and he's come near because he loves you he comes near because he wants to do something for you he comes near because he harbors no malice towards you he harbors no anger you're his he paid for you he wants to put the soul sign on you and he wants to take your life and he wants to live in it now it doesn't matter what that liar is telling you because there's no truth in him but in your heart if you say lord i really want your presence i want your spirit i heard the word and i believe it i can look in the mirror and i can see a lot of shortcomings i can see a lot of failures like a lot of things i know better but you can't overcome without them so you might as well just stop and say lord i'm going to stop right here and i'm just gonna wait on you [Music] i'm gonna surrender my heart to you and i'm gonna ask you that you come in to me and you come into my mind and you come into my life [Music] and if you invite him in he promised in no wise while i cast you away he comes where he's invited [Music] and if you just take that moment he knows all about it he's not here to fuss about your past he's here to give you a better future he's here to make a difference and take the burdens away and the ugliness away and the the sorrow away he's a good god and he loves us zade tries to eat all the our time up and all our minutes up but if we can just rest [Music] and take him in his word i will not leave you comfortless [Music] i will not leave you in a place of uncomfort and misery and sorrow but i will come to you that's an individual promise to every hearer he said i will not leave you in your sorrow i will not leave you in your heartache i will not leave you in your desperation i will not leave you in your failure but i will come by your life i will come to you [Music] i will not leave you comfortable but i will come and i'll be with you i'll be with you in your time of heartache i'll be with you in the darkness of your sin i'll be with you and not only will i be with you but i will come into you that's the christian life that's the birth that everybody that's ever came to the lord the lord meant you where you were he never asked you to be where he was he meets you in your lowest place and when you sense his being and you sense his call and you sense his touch and you sense his conviction [Music] you say lord i'm guilty
