[23:23] my heart

[23:28] oh and so far away
[23:34] [Music]
[24:20] [Music]
[24:26] [Music]
[24:38] Oh
[24:44] [Music]
[25:59] Oh
[26:02] [Music]
[26:07] [Music]
[26:23] [Music]
[27:05] [Music]
[27:48] I don't know how to do both I guess I'll
[27:52] just figure it out but I certainly
[27:55] enjoyed that statement that brother
[27:58] branham made so much that I wanted to
[28:00] read it again but it was what he said
[28:03] about Stonewall Jackson and he he said
[28:08] he said it was the greatest general
[28:11] Stonewall Jackson who has been my
[28:15] favorite general since Joshua Stonewall
[28:18] Jackson was asked one time how can you
[28:22] stand with just a handful of men when
[28:26] the opposition is so great that's how he
[28:31] got his name Stonewall he would not
[28:35] budge he knowed no retreat
[28:38] what could we accredit a man like that
[28:43] to a man when the Yankees come down by
[28:48] the thousands and stood there he stood
[28:51] there in the minority but they were
[28:54] never moved him he stood like a stone
[28:58] wall and all the rest of the rebel army
[29:01] had retreated back lines come on said
[29:05] what's the matter with Jackson why isn't
[29:09] he going I've heard that statement a lot
[29:11] what's the matter with Jackson so that
[29:15] really meant a lot to me what's the
[29:17] matter with Jackson why isn't he going
[29:20] and he said he stands like a stone wall
[29:24] that's where he got his title and the
[29:27] other generals asked him said mr.
[29:29] Jackson a little bitty fella
[29:32] black-headed blue-eyed only about 5 feet
[29:36] 2 inches tall very modest speaking
[29:39] little fella who said mr. Jackson how
[29:43] can you stand in such opposition and he
[29:46] said bash
[29:47] like you know so you can just picture
[29:49] him he's you know bashful like he said
[29:52] he kicks his foot against the wall
[29:54] ground his heads down
[29:56] he says kibosh Vil like he kicked his
[30:00] boot on the ground and he said I never
[30:03] take a drink of water unless I thank God
[30:07] for it first that's where it is there's
[30:11] no retreat in God speak and go forward
[30:16] that's right
[30:17] that's God's commission to his church we
[30:24] we have no time to slack
[30:27] they say the revival is over it isn't
[30:32] over go forward it it's time that Kent
[30:37] Pentecost played out it isn't it's time
[30:42] for Pentecost to rise in the name of
[30:45] Jesus Christ and go forward there's no
[30:49] retreat
[30:50] there's no stain on the same ground
[30:53] let's move with the spirit or the spirit
[30:57] we'll move on to someone else and leave
[31:00] you standing you follow it don't don't
[31:04] all that's in do all that's in your
[31:08] heart for God is with you and and and
[31:12] that meant a lot to me and man as you
[31:16] know it's just been in my heart to
[31:19] provide a better sanctuary for us I know
[31:24] this evening we're not crowded we're
[31:26] never very crowded on communion night
[31:29] but my heart's desires one day that
[31:31] everybody will come out to communion
[31:33] that they'll get the revelation of how
[31:36] important it is and but that we'd have
[31:39] more space and more room and that we
[31:42] could have better bathrooms just many
[31:44] things that would make our church life
[31:47] easier for the people and and that any
[31:52] Shepherd that had a stall and and that
[31:57] was so packed and the sheep are so
[31:59] crowded in
[32:00] that his heart would hope that God would
[32:02] build a bigger stall that his sheep
[32:04] would have more room to sleep more room
[32:06] to eat it I think that's just a natural
[32:09] thing but we did hit a milestone here
[32:11] this week in our hearts desire and we
[32:16] finally hit the 300 thousand dollar mark
[32:19] in our building fund and so our goal is
[32:24] to reach four hundred thousand but just
[32:28] think that we've made 75 percent of our
[32:31] goal so I really think that's a
[32:34] wonderful thing so I'm grateful for that
[32:35] and and we hope that in the next few
[32:38] months that we'll be able to secure our
[32:41] building permit and and get with all
[32:44] their brethren and plan exactly how that
[32:47] we want to go forward so we're certainly
[32:49] a grateful for that and also we want to
[32:54] really encourage all the men that can
[32:57] come out I wanted to say this this
[33:00] morning that I slipped my mind
[33:03] but look for the men's breakfast next
[33:07] Saturday morning at 9 o'clock here at
[33:10] the church we have a men's breakfast and
[33:13] and we going to provide a nice breakfast
[33:16] we're going to have now sisters don't
[33:20] get mad at me now
[33:21] but this is for the brothers because we
[33:23] want to get them to go to work ok and do
[33:26] things so we're going to have some nice
[33:29] Denver scramble yeah it's ham and onions
[33:32] and cheese all scrambled up but a nice
[33:35] we're gonna have bacon and sausage and
[33:37] hash browns and biscuits and gravy and
[33:42] coffee and orange juice he said you know
[33:46] that some people only come out for the
[33:48] loaves and fishes you know what I mean
[33:51] so we have to make that available to you
[33:53] know whatever whatever it takes that get
[33:56] them all out together right and you know
[34:01] that's just what it takes and so we're
[34:05] looking forward to that but I wanted to
[34:07] thank you all for your support and and
[34:10] that your continuing effort to
[34:13] keep the house of the Lord open and so I
[34:17] just really was pleased to see that that
[34:21] we've reached that so we're gonna try to
[34:23] get a a new I guess we call a
[34:28] thermometer or our goal chart and put
[34:32] the top and start at the bottom and see
[34:35] if we can fill the rest of it in so lord
[34:37] richly bless you let's stand again and
[34:40] sing another song and I'll get this
[34:43] weird Billy go if this does somebody I
[34:57] got a comment somebody said that we I
[34:59] should wipe this down before I hand it
[35:02] to you but I've been tested negative

[38:13] to come and feast at your table precious

[38:33] ourselves can or do nothing that would
[38:37] benefit the people Lord but if you'll

[38:44] with us Lord we would be edified Lord
[38:46] our hearts would be encouraged
[38:49] Lord this little thought that you've
[38:52] placed upon my heart I pray to God that
[38:54] you'd help me to get out of the way Lord
[38:57] that Lord be a blessing to your people
[39:00] Lord we're just during this little time

[39:17] hearts I just commit commit everything
[39:20] to you now in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[39:24] amen certainly appreciate the songs
[39:28] specials what a wonderful day I was
[39:32] meditating on some things brother David
[39:35] said this morning and I just it's just
[39:38] inspiring to know that God can take you
[39:43] know something like Rahab you know that
[39:49] story just it really affected me you
[39:52] know her and her in that condition and I
[39:56] identify with Rahab the harlot because I
[40:00] - one day you know I was I was groping
[40:04] in darkness and and all of a sudden you
[40:10] know that that voice just something
[40:13] spoke to my heart and that what was said
[40:19] I just was compelled to be obedient to
[40:22] it and God came by and confirmed what he
[40:28] spoke and I just believe that's the
[40:30] communion that we have today just like
[40:33] we have of God that will speak that we
[40:37] can speak to and he'll speak back amen
[40:40] that's that's a just a wonderful delight
[40:43] as children of God that we have I'm just
[40:48] really thankful for that and and I trust
[40:51] that tonight that as we go through the
[40:54] the communion service and through the
[40:56] word that God will do that very same
[40:58] thing in first Corinthians we're gonna
[41:04] take a little thought out of chapter 12
[41:08] first Corinthians chapter 12 and while
[41:16] you're turning there as another thing I
[41:19] said one of my little children's books
[41:21] that was laying on the ground during the
[41:25] morning service it had little people you
[41:31] know with little flashlights and the
[41:33] night it was nighttime and they were
[41:34] walking around with
[41:35] flashlights and you know it just it just
[41:40] struck me how that ye are the light of
[41:42] the world and the the the our that we're
[41:46] living in it's in the evening time it is
[41:48] the night time and so that's what we're
[41:53] gonna kind of try to focus in on a
[41:55] little bit tonight
[41:56] now concerning spiritual Griffes
[41:58] brethren I would have you not I would
[42:02] have you not ignorant you know that you
[42:05] were Gentiles carried away and to these
[42:08] dumb idols even as you were led
[42:12] wherefore I have given unto you
[42:15] understanding that no man speaketh by
[42:18] the Spirit of God call it Jesus occurs
[42:20] and that no man can say that jesus is
[42:24] the lord but by the holy ghost a man we
[42:28] trust the Lord will add a blessing to
[42:30] the reading of his word you may have
[42:31] your seats yeah it's it's
[42:45] we're familiar with the the scripture
[42:48] when brother bran says all that God was
[42:51] he poured into Christ and all that
[42:54] Christ was he poured into the church and
[42:57] you know we're living in a time where
[43:00] there's darkness and gross darkness on
[43:03] the people and God had an intention and
[43:07] a purpose a hidden motive a mystery that
[43:10] was going to be open to us and now here
[43:14] we are in the evening time and goddess
[43:16] he has brought this evening time light
[43:19] and now we can understand that that were
[43:23] a part of him and whatever he is that's
[43:27] what we are and you know I just got to
[43:30] thinking about how you know even even in
[43:35] the midst of situations that I had
[43:39] experienced even not even being
[43:41] consecrated to the work of the Lord and
[43:44] God he he just would would ask me you
[43:48] know there there's somebody that I cared
[43:50] for that was in a condition and because
[43:54] I heard that you know God he was he was
[44:01] a God that still had the power to
[44:03] resurrect the dead and so when I heard
[44:07] that something in me started kind of
[44:10] churning and bubbling and I mean I had
[44:14] heard it on tape but then when I
[44:16] actually met somebody who actually began
[44:18] to point to a person that a girl when
[44:22] she was 10 years old she was dead and
[44:24] some brothers went over there and prayed
[44:26] for her that God raised her up and that
[44:29] just really did something for me I it's
[44:31] hard to explain some things but you know
[44:33] when God touches you by testimony how it
[44:36] affects you and so it wasn't very much
[44:41] longer after that that now I was put
[44:44] into a position where you know I got a
[44:50] knock at the door and my wife my wife
[44:55] answered it and she you know said that
[44:59] the neighbor person was wanting some
[45:01] help and it's kind of a long testimony
[45:03] but because of what I had previously
[45:06] heard it put what was in my heart to
[45:09] action not I it was actually an
[45:11] opportunity where I stopped looking at
[45:14] my own self it was like I wasn't
[45:16] thinking about Who I am in my mind or
[45:19] what I was thinking in the moment there
[45:21] was something in me that acted and I
[45:24] just believe that God gives us
[45:26] experiences and situations where when
[45:30] we've received the word and we've
[45:32] there's something that's been quickened
[45:34] now we're gonna be thrusted into a
[45:36] little situation where now God can use
[45:39] you and he wants to do something he
[45:40] wants to declare that he's the same
[45:43] yesterday today and forever and that
[45:44] isn't that the way it works you you read
[45:47] you know your different life experiences
[45:49] and you heard how God did it for
[45:52] somebody else and that sets a little
[45:54] something in your heart now then you
[45:57] come to a place where you're like I'm in
[46:01] the same position I'm in the same
[46:02] situation and and then it's almost like
[46:05] the situation forces the what's in you
[46:08] to come out and you know it's just it's
[46:14] just a glorious thing how that were made
[46:20] to partake in the Word of God we are the
[46:24] word and we're made to protect in the
[46:27] the very resurrection power and if we
[46:31] could just read a little bit further in
[46:34] our scripture in verse 11 it says but
[46:38] all these work worketh that one and self
[46:42] same spirit dividing to the very man
[46:45] every man severally as he will for as
[46:49] the body is one and hath many members
[46:51] and all the members of the that one body
[46:55] being many are one body so also is
[47:01] Christ for by one spirit are we all
[47:03] baptized into one body whether we be
[47:06] Jews or Gentiles whether we
[47:09] be bond or free we have we and have been
[47:15] all made to drink into one spirit and
[47:18] that's really that that last little
[47:20] phrase is if if I was going to drive and
[47:23] focus down on something is is you've
[47:25] been made to drink into one spirit and
[47:29] and see we know that by the teaching of
[47:32] the Prophet that only the predestinated
[47:35] can be born again and so you know what
[47:37] it's like to come into this world with
[47:38] the fallen nature and the spirit that
[47:41] you were born with and so you know it
[47:44] doesn't say that all we're made to drink
[47:46] of those two spirits well there is one
[47:49] spirit of the Living God that can come
[47:52] and give the predestinated seed the new
[47:55] birth and and you've been made to
[47:57] partake in that and and it's great it's
[48:00] a wonderful thing to be able to
[48:02] experience God in salvation or or in
[48:05] wisdom or in healing and now I just you
[48:10] know as as you're made for it now let's
[48:14] let the channel flow let's let the
[48:17] waters of life flow and so you know I
[48:21] just I tell you it's it's such a
[48:23] blessing whenever you can experience the
[48:25] grace of God and and then you can
[48:28] partake in this one spirit it's it's so
[48:32] wonderful and so you know I just talking
[48:35] with the brother yesterday and he had
[48:37] kind of a distressful situation and he
[48:40] had to take his wife to the emergency
[48:42] room and he got to testifying to me and
[48:46] he said you know he was like you know I
[48:49] feel like and and this is kind of like
[48:52] Moses you know Moses came to a place
[48:54] where he said you know he knew he had
[48:57] been commissioned he knew he had been
[48:58] called he knew he had the seed and he
[49:01] was born a proper child and he knew was
[49:03] going to be the deliverer but then when
[49:05] he tried to go out on what his ability
[49:07] and education all that he took a
[49:09] headlong topple and he failed and that's
[49:11] the way it is I believe with us as
[49:12] believers where we can conceptualize
[49:15] what God has called us to and so well
[49:19] you know he's like yeah
[49:22] I've went through this situation with my
[49:23] vehicle and he had to do the same
[49:25] replacement of a part like three or four
[49:27] times well he's just like he's not a
[49:30] handyman or a mechanic or anything like
[49:32] that but he's YouTube in videos and
[49:34] doing things so he's getting to where
[49:35] he's like I can actually do this now
[49:38] that you know I'm going back for the
[49:40] same part I can do this and he goes I'll
[49:43] do this in 30 minutes and and you know
[49:47] it took him like 11 hours or eight hours
[49:52] or something like that
[49:53] and and we just got the fellowship and
[49:56] he just started telling me he goes you
[49:58] know the Lord really spoke to me and
[49:59] taught me that you know what you know I
[50:02] was I was I was saying I was gonna do
[50:04] this and I was gonna do that you know
[50:06] and sometimes that's what we get with
[50:08] with our experience and things like that
[50:10] it's almost like I've had enough where I
[50:12] got this you know but really the
[50:14] relationship is a love affair and we
[50:16] want to commune with Christ and we want
[50:18] to know that we're drinking of this
[50:20] fountain and it's us together and we
[50:23] don't want to ever get to where we're
[50:25] self-sufficient like I've experienced
[50:27] the word I know you know no it's not
[50:29] about that and so what are we coming to
[50:32] and so as you know I can identify and I
[50:38] chuckled with and because I've
[50:40] experienced that I failed so many times
[50:42] thinking I was gonna get out starting
[50:45] doing something and Wow you know it
[50:49] finally kind of where it well maybe I
[50:52] should have prayed first you know amen
[50:55] so you know can we be honest you know
[50:59] that's that's that's what I'm doing is
[51:00] just I want to be honest you know
[51:02] there's times where we go out and we do
[51:04] things and we kind of leave the Lord out
[51:06] of it but tonight I want to commune with
[51:08] God and just say you know let's let the
[51:11] mercies of God flow you know what has
[51:14] overflowed to me
[51:16] I wanted to overflow to others and and I
[51:19] got to thinking about how you know
[51:21] brother branham made statement about one
[51:28] of the greatest successes that he had
[51:32] with when in terms of his is
[51:35] brain for the sick and you know we're
[51:37] commissioned and called to pray for the
[51:39] sick to preach the gospel and and people
[51:42] can actually see the power of the
[51:45] Resurrection when you testify and then
[51:48] they see the results of the testimony
[51:51] that God is not dead in a matter of fact
[51:53] he's here doing the same that he's
[51:54] always done and so he said red-brown
[51:59] made the statement he says you know he
[52:00] if he can get to like the man in Mexico
[52:04] when he he lifted his shoulders to see
[52:07] if he can give him his coat you know and
[52:09] then he put his foot up to his his shoe
[52:12] up to the the blind man's a foot to see
[52:16] if maybe he can give him his shoes and I
[52:19] just think that that's the Spirit of
[52:21] Christ is to look unto the needs of
[52:23] others and to to you know and and
[52:26] sometimes we endure things like the
[52:27] scripture says in Philippians and thinks
[52:30] the third chapter he says that we might
[52:32] be that we might know him in the power
[52:35] of his resurrection and the Fellowship
[52:38] of his suffering to be made conformable
[52:40] unto his death and so you know there are
[52:43] certain things that we don't necessarily
[52:45] we didn't we wouldn't want to sign up
[52:47] for it like who wants to sign up for
[52:50] heart murmur who wants to sign up for
[52:52] some kind of disability or something but
[52:55] you know when you become a partaker of
[52:57] the the grace of God and the witness of
[53:01] God now now you can have fellowship with
[53:04] someone else's suffering and then your
[53:06] your offer of mercy can be extended and
[53:10] it be effectual you know we want that
[53:13] whatever you're going through it's not
[53:15] in vain God is allowing it for a purpose
[53:18] that because what you are now he wants
[53:21] to express it to those who are groping
[53:23] in darkness amen
[53:26] what a special calling not everybody
[53:29] they can take it in their mind but they
[53:31] can't perform it because they don't have
[53:33] that same spirit amen amen
[53:40] I just just I'm just so thankful that
[53:45] you know
[53:48] God hasn't left us without a witness you
[53:51] know and God he he's he's he's placed
[53:55] his word and and the way that you know
[53:59] God has dealt with me and he just does
[54:01] it as a son of God just the same with
[54:04] you son or daughter of God he'll give a
[54:06] promise and then you accept it you
[54:09] received the promise and then God has a
[54:11] way of confirming the promise and see we
[54:17] have it potentially until until God
[54:20] backs it up and and you know when you
[54:22] four take to that mercy like say then
[54:26] it's real easy because you know the
[54:27] fruit of it you've realized the the full
[54:30] the full aspect of it and so you know
[54:35] why I wouldn't want to be we don't want
[54:38] to be the ones that wear the blessings
[54:40] of God stops at you know we want to be
[54:44] that conduit that channel that it can
[54:46] flow amen well I I won't be long I just
[54:55] kind of just wanted to share a little
[54:57] thought that was on my heart and you
[55:00] know as I was reading this morning in
[55:03] church something that kind of stood out
[55:06] to me is in Isaiah 30 but it seemed
[55:10] fitting for where we're at in time and
[55:13] where I'm at individually I just trusted
[55:15] to be a blessing so in Isaiah Terry says
[55:17] woe unto their rebellious children saith
[55:19] the Lord that taketh counsel but not of
[55:23] me you see you know our our nation we've
[55:28] we've walked away from all that's called
[55:31] God and and now they have all of these
[55:34] things you know that that claimed this
[55:36] and claimed that but the scripture
[55:39] saying and that cover with covering but
[55:45] not of my spirit you see it's plainly
[55:48] stating that God has a cover
[55:50] God has what he wants for his children
[55:54] in the form of his spirit and and that
[55:58] they
[56:00] may add sin to sin they they walked to
[56:04] go down to Egypt and have not asked at
[56:07] my mouth to strengthen themselves in the
[56:11] strength of Pharaoh and to trust in the
[56:13] shadow of Egypt therefore shall the
[56:18] strength of Pharaoh be your shame and
[56:21] the trust in the shadow of Egypt your
[56:24] confusion
[56:25] yeah just think about that those who
[56:27] don't counsel the Word of God you see
[56:30] how Egypt is a type of sin in the world
[56:33] and you know they're looking for the
[56:36] government to be a fortification and a
[56:39] strength but that's not our strength
[56:41] that's not our hope and we're communing
[56:43] with the word knowing that there's no
[56:46] trial there's no struggle that we're
[56:49] going through that our God by his Spirit
[56:51] is not going to bring about the
[56:52] deliverance bring about the restoration
[56:55] and the healing and just maybe we'll
[57:01] skip over to verse 17 he says 1000 shall
[57:06] flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke
[57:10] of five shall ye flee till ye be as a
[57:14] beacon upon the top of a mountain and as
[57:18] an ensign on a heel you know and that's
[57:21] what that's what we are like believing
[57:24] brother David preached about those and
[57:25] those vessels of Mercy you know when
[57:29] you've received this message you've
[57:31] received mercy you know it tells you
[57:35] about who you are in him and oh my I
[57:40] mean to think that you're a part of him
[57:43] and you're to do to declare his very
[57:45] righteousness to declare his very work
[57:49] at the end time this is like the climax
[57:52] of all what he had in his heart my and
[57:58] therefore with the Lord therefore will
[58:02] the Lord wait that he may be gracious
[58:07] unto you and therefore will he be
[58:10] exalted you know I just think about how
[58:13] it took me so long to finally come to
[58:17] the place of surrender you know and and
[58:20] I you know it's it's just amazing like
[58:24] the scripture says it's the it's the
[58:27] goodness or the mercies of God that
[58:30] bringeth the man to repentance and he
[58:34] waits there so long and waits
[58:38] but now that's his gonna be as
[58:41] exaltation you know because you know
[58:44] once he come to the final realization
[58:46] and his full surrender then like the
[58:50] songs that were sung you can really bust
[58:53] it out from the depths of your heart
[58:55] oh my therefore will the Lord wait that
[59:02] he may be gracious unto you and
[59:04] therefore will he be exalted that he may
[59:07] have mercy upon you for the Lord is the
[59:11] god of judgment blessed are they that
[59:13] wait for him for the people shall dwell
[59:17] in Zion at Jerusalem thou shalt weep no
[59:22] more thou shall be very gracious at the
[59:26] at the voice of thy cry when he shall
[59:31] hear it he will answer thee yeah I just
[59:35] think that the scripture was just right
[59:38] in line with what I was on our pastor's
[59:40] heart you know God wants us to to speak
[59:43] and then go forward if it's been
[59:44] promised you you know that he'll never
[59:48] forsake the righteous or seen his seed
[59:52] begging bread you know if it's if it's
[59:55] biased stripes we are healed if it's
[59:57] I'll never forsake you whatever it is
[1:00:01] speak it and go forward he will answer
[1:00:06] thee and though the Lord give the bread
[1:00:09] of adversity in the water of affliction
[1:00:13] yet shall not die teachers be removed
[1:00:17] into the corners anymore but dyin eyes
[1:00:20] shall see thy teachers in thine ears
[1:00:23] shall hear the word behind these saying
[1:00:25] this is the way
[1:00:27] walkie in it when ye turned to the right
[1:00:31] hand and you turn to the left
[1:00:34] hey man so I just I just want to
[1:00:37] encourage you as as we're going through
[1:00:39] the different trials that were going
[1:00:41] through God he you've been you've been
[1:00:46] made to be partakers of one spirit and
[1:00:49] when you receive that spirit now let's
[1:00:52] let the blessings flow god bless you
[1:01:58] I get me a mic I I just sat here this
[1:02:09] morning banging my arm against the side
[1:02:11] of the ball pit they're like really
[1:02:13] suffering but if you can't hear me I
[1:02:16] just just what to me what Andrew said is
[1:02:20] really what would solve all the problems
[1:02:23] in our nature it's just the love of God
[1:02:26] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[1:02:29] Spirit
[1:02:30] like he said let just be in a conduit to
[1:02:34] let the goodness of God go out
[1:02:37] everywhere you are and you can share
[1:02:39] that goodness everywhere respect every
[1:02:42] human being you come with wish good
[1:02:44] thoughts towards everybody you come to
[1:02:47] say a nice thing and everybody that you
[1:02:50] meet create an atmosphere around you
[1:02:53] that they know there's no bitterness or
[1:02:55] no eight redeem your heart Joe respect
[1:02:58] to all men and even the lost and and
[1:03:03] it's just something about someone that's
[1:03:07] got the love of God in their heart it
[1:03:10] breaks down barriers like nothing you
[1:03:14] know it just have that that hand of the
[1:03:19] Lord on you remember I went to preach
[1:03:21] one time and I didn't have no money so I
[1:03:27] took the bus and I went through Memphis
[1:03:32] in the that was in the Memphis bus
[1:03:34] station and and that's you know the bus
[1:03:38] stations are there were little rougher
[1:03:41] places in the part of town so I remember
[1:03:45] I I went to get a buy something and I
[1:03:49] pulled the money out of my pocket and
[1:03:51] went through it and paid that the guy
[1:03:55] and put it back in my pocket and all of
[1:03:57] a sudden I felt this hand on my shoulder
[1:04:00] and I looked up and this fella had his
[1:04:03] hand on me
[1:04:04] he look at me he says son don't you ever
[1:04:07] pull out your poke in the middle of the
[1:04:10] a crowd and you know I just thought that
[1:04:14] guy cared about me that's right you know
[1:04:18] what I mean he knew if you go flashing
[1:04:20] your money you're not gonna have him
[1:04:22] very long you know what I mean I was
[1:04:24] young young guy and and and he come out
[1:04:28] looking after me you know he just gave
[1:04:31] me it I actually felt his care in his
[1:04:35] love and I'll guarantee you the guy was
[1:04:37] a street person that you'd ever meet in
[1:04:39] your life but he knows and he cared and
[1:04:43] I appreciated that and that went a long
[1:04:45] way with me I felt the hand of the Lord
[1:04:48] and I felt the Lord use that fella and I
[1:04:51] asked God to bless him and we can do so
[1:04:53] much to create the right atmosphere and
[1:04:58] I think especially in this hour we're
[1:05:00] living in everybody's looking for a
[1:05:02] reason to do whatever they want to do
[1:05:05] you know isn't it funny we had everybody
[1:05:08] was locked up for months and months and
[1:05:10] everybody's avoiding everybody and you
[1:05:13] look on the news and thousands and
[1:05:15] thousands of people are all all together
[1:05:18] and walking around and I think that's
[1:05:22] great
[1:05:22] I'm all for it and then this one guy
[1:05:25] that was the guy that tried to tell
[1:05:28] everybody they should be social
[1:05:30] distancing he's sending out messages
[1:05:32] over again the start to virus all over
[1:05:35] again we're gonna start the virus all
[1:05:37] over again you want to know something we
[1:05:39] need the love of God that's the thing
[1:05:41] that will kill that virus every time I
[1:05:45] don't care the love of God will do
[1:05:48] exceedingly and abundantly above what we
[1:05:50] can ask for thing a good spiritual
[1:05:53] atmosphere I think if you get so filled
[1:05:55] with the Holy Ghost that that little
[1:05:57] mamita wherever it is you won't even
[1:06:00] want to be a part of me that's right so
[1:06:04] let's just really let the atmosphere of
[1:06:08] sharing what we have on the inside be
[1:06:12] placed out there for everybody let's
[1:06:15] stand and read our scriptures as
[1:06:22] in this turn in our Bibles to Luke and
[1:06:36] let me see here
[1:06:38] it's found in I just had it here lost my
[1:06:46] place in my Bible found in Luke the 22nd
[1:06:53] chapter then the fifteenth verse now
[1:07:01] then these are this is going to be our
[1:07:03] our communion of reading and and that
[1:07:10] the brothers would go get ready at this
[1:07:12] time it said and he said in the
[1:07:16] fourteenth verse and when the hour was
[1:07:19] come he sat down and the Twelve Apostles
[1:07:23] with him and he said unto them with
[1:07:27] desire I have desired to eat this
[1:07:31] Passover with you before I suffer for I
[1:07:36] say unto you I will not anymore eat
[1:07:41] thereof until it be fulfilled in the
[1:07:45] kingdom of God
[1:07:46] and when he took the cup he gave thanks
[1:07:49] and said take this and divided amongst
[1:07:54] yourselves for I say and you I will not
[1:07:57] drink of the fruit of this vine tell the
[1:08:01] kingdom of God shall come and he took
[1:08:04] bread and gave thanks and brake it and
[1:08:06] gave it unto them saying this is my body
[1:08:09] which is given for you this do in
[1:08:14] remembrance of me and likewise also the
[1:08:19] cup after supper saying this cup is the
[1:08:23] New Testament in my blood which is shed
[1:08:27] for you but behold the hand of him that
[1:08:32] betrayeth me is with me
[1:08:34] the table and truly the Son of Man goeth
[1:08:39] as it was determined but woe unto that
[1:08:43] man by whom he is betrayed and they
[1:08:47] begin to enquire among themselves which
[1:08:51] of them was it that should do this thing
[1:08:55] and there also was a strife amongst them
[1:08:59] which of them should be accounted the
[1:09:04] greatest amen god bless you may be
[1:09:07] seated
[1:09:08] you know the reason I read these
[1:09:11] scriptures care for communion is because
[1:09:16] after they were wandering and inquiring
[1:09:19] which amongst them to be the greatest
[1:09:22] Jesus took off his garment and washed
[1:09:25] their feet and said I have given you
[1:09:28] example he was the greatest among you
[1:09:32] shall be a servant of all and so that's
[1:09:36] why we put communion in foot washing
[1:09:38] together because after that he gave an
[1:09:42] example of how that we should be but we
[1:09:46] take communion of with the Lord so he
[1:09:50] can be our guide in being little
[1:09:55] messiahs he can be our guide in meeting
[1:09:58] that's in guiding us in all
[1:09:59] righteousness we wash feet so we can
[1:10:02] always have the remembrance in our lives
[1:10:05] that there's no big guys and there's no
[1:10:08] little use we're all the purchased
[1:10:11] possession of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:13] rather
[1:10:22] our gracious Heavenly Father the force
[1:10:26] here lies bread Lord but this bread
[1:10:33] represents your body word the sacrifice
[1:10:38] of you giving yourself to the church nor
[1:10:42] did we take this in remembrance of you
[1:10:44] of the example that you gave us the life
[1:10:48] you live afford us the truth that you
[1:10:51] revealed unto us for when we saw you we
[1:10:55] saw the father for all that the father
[1:10:58] was he poured into you and now we're
[1:11:01] obedient Lord to your command that when
[1:11:06] we eat this bread and we drink this cup
[1:11:08] we do it in remembrance of you and
[1:11:11] father we ask you to bless this bread as
