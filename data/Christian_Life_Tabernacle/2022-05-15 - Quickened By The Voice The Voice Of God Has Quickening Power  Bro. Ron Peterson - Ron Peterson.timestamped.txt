[7:37] his way this morning
[7:39] we trust that he's here among us father
[7:41] we love you and
[7:42] we thank you father for this opportunity
[7:44] once again to be gathered together unto
[7:46] your name

[8:26] might be pleasing to you that this would
[8:29] not be
[8:30] lord something that would bring glory to
[8:31] man but that you would be glorified in
[8:33] all things
[8:34] and lord we take control of any spirit
[8:37] that's in this place that would hinder

[8:41] ghost and your word would rule in all
[8:43] things we pray that every need would be
[8:45] met and lord that everyone would hear
[8:47] from you as we committed to you in jesus
[8:49] name
[8:50] amen
[8:52] well good morning we're
[8:55] gonna go ahead and read our psalm for
[8:57] the day
[8:59] welcome to all of our visitors i see a
[9:01] lot of
[9:03] new faces here this morning
[9:05] we uh
[9:07] we've been really reading little
[9:08] portions of psalm 119 together and
[9:12] you know just sharing some of the things
[9:13] that
[9:15] you know
[9:16] stick out to us in the scriptures as we
[9:18] do that we're going to go ahead and turn
[9:19] to psalm 119 and
[9:21] read that portion that begins in verse
[9:23] 49 and
[9:25] you know as i was reading this there's
[9:26] an interesting
[9:28] the the section begins with an
[9:30] interesting statement which kind of
[9:31] caught my attention you know how it is
[9:32] you'll read a passage of scripture and
[9:34] just kind of casually read it for years
[9:36] and all of a sudden it'll catch your
[9:38] attention when you read it and that's
[9:40] what happened to me with verse 49 it
[9:42] says this it says remember
[9:44] the word
[9:46] unto thy servant
[9:48] and the thought occurred to me as i was
[9:49] reading that did
[9:51] did the lord forget
[9:54] what are we asking
[9:56] for him
[9:58] to remember his word
[10:01] you know as you go through the
[10:02] scriptures there are times when
[10:05] you know people call on the lord for the
[10:07] lord to remember something
[10:10] and that would be an interesting study
[10:11] to do one time is the things that the
[10:13] lord remembers
[10:15] and the things that the lord remembers
[10:17] not
[10:18] but there are times when people will
[10:20] call on the lord to remember me
[10:23] or to remember someone else or to
[10:25] remember not my sin and my iniquity
[10:28] remember your tender mercies but there's
[10:31] just a few times in the scriptures where
[10:33] someone calls out to the lord and asks
[10:35] for him
[10:36] to remember
[10:38] his own word
[10:39] and there are times in the scriptures
[10:41] where the lord speaks up and says that
[10:43] he did something and he remembered his
[10:45] word
[10:46] concerning something
[10:48] and
[10:49] you know as i was thinking about that
[10:51] you know there were times when people
[10:53] called out to the lord just a handful of
[10:54] times where remember your word moses did
[10:57] that he called out on the lord for the
[10:59] children of israel and said remember
[11:01] your word your covenant concerning this
[11:04] people and it stayed the plague
[11:06] to stay the judgment
[11:08] there was a time when nehemiah he called
[11:10] out to the lord and said remember your
[11:12] word concerning this people and after 70
[11:15] years of bondage the lord moved on
[11:17] hearts of kings and caused them to enter
[11:19] back into their land
[11:21] but as i was thinking about that there
[11:24] was a portion of scripture that stuck
[11:25] out to me in exodus chapter 2
[11:27] and it was in the time of the exodus
[11:29] where it says that the lord remembered
[11:30] his own word
[11:31] and the question is this did he forget
[11:34] did he need a reminder of what his word
[11:37] had said
[11:38] and it's in exodus 2 verse 24 it's
[11:41] speaking of the children of israel that
[11:42] were in captivity in egypt
[11:45] and it said and god heard their groaning
[11:48] and god remembered
[11:50] his covenant
[11:51] with abraham with isaac
[11:54] and with jacob and then we begin to see
[11:56] the hand of the lord move on their
[11:58] behalf and he said this of himself in
[11:59] exodus 6 5
[12:01] the same thing but the question is daddy
[12:03] forgotten
[12:04] had he been off doing something else
[12:07] and all of a sudden he heard of people
[12:08] pray it's like oh yeah i remember about
[12:11] those people i need to go see what
[12:12] they're up to
[12:14] you know it's uh did he need a reminder
[12:19] you know there are
[12:21] you'll find no there are many times in
[12:23] the scripture where the where he says
[12:25] lord where it says lord remember me or
[12:28] forget not but at no point in the
[12:30] scripture does it say that he actually
[12:32] forgot
[12:33] his own word
[12:35] so if he never actually forgot his word
[12:39] what actually are we asking for him to
[12:42] remember
[12:45] you know it's interesting if you read
[12:46] this section in exodus 2 it's
[12:50] you know the children of israel had been
[12:51] in bondage for 390 years
[12:55] but it wasn't until after moses had been
[12:58] born
[13:00] raised
[13:01] fled egypt and gone into midian that
[13:03] they began to call on the name of the
[13:05] lord
[13:06] so for
[13:07] 390 years
[13:10] they dwelt in this condition
[13:13] and they were just trying to stay
[13:15] comfortable
[13:17] coping
[13:19] living with the bondage
[13:21] compromising
[13:24] but then it wasn't until 390 years
[13:28] that their voice began to change
[13:30] that that fourth generation rose up and
[13:33] began to cry out with a cry of
[13:36] affliction when previously it had been a
[13:38] cry of coping
[13:40] of compromise there was a different
[13:43] sound
[13:44] coming out of the people
[13:46] it says in exodus 2 25 that they all the
[13:49] sudden god looked upon the children of
[13:51] israel and god had respect unto them
[13:54] this isn't a situation where all of a
[13:56] sudden he remembered a people that he
[13:58] forgot
[13:59] but it was a situation where now he was
[14:01] hearing something from a people that
[14:03] reminded him of his own word
[14:05] the sound
[14:07] the reflection from the people
[14:09] changed
[14:10] it's kind of like when you look at
[14:11] somebody that you know might walk on the
[14:13] round in the crowd and say boy that
[14:15] person reminds me of someone
[14:18] remembering someone that you know in the
[14:20] image that you see in someone else
[14:23] you know when when david is calling out
[14:25] to the lord asking for him to remember
[14:29] the word concerning
[14:30] his servant
[14:32] this isn't about him asking the lords to
[14:34] remember a long forgotten word
[14:36] concerning him
[14:38] but the prayer
[14:39] my prayer would be lord when you look at
[14:41] me
[14:43] may i remind you of your own word
[14:47] may you remember your own word because
[14:49] of what you see coming from me
[14:52] and when i think about us
[14:54] when i think about it this is we read
[14:56] this this morning in psalm 119 i pray
[14:58] that that would be our prayer that lord
[15:00] this is not about you remembering some
[15:02] long forgotten word it's so often we get
[15:04] an affliction
[15:06] we have a burden we have a need we have
[15:08] a trial we all do it lord have you
[15:11] forgotten me
[15:12] lord remember your word he hasn't
[15:14] forgotten his word
[15:16] he's waiting to see his word reflected
[15:19] because when the word that he spoke
[15:21] matches the word that he sees
[15:24] now you can ask anything in my name
[15:27] you know what it says in verse 50 is
[15:29] we're going to read this in psalm 119
[15:30] this is my comfort and my affliction for
[15:32] thy word has quickened me
[15:36] you know when his word goes forth
[15:37] concerning anything it's a quickener and
[15:40] it begins a work in the one for whom the
[15:43] word is intended so that it begins to
[15:45] reflect the image that is going to be
[15:47] fulfilled
[15:48] so as we read psalm 119 this morning
[15:51] this passage
[15:52] let's just
[15:53] may that be our prayer lord
[15:56] may your word be reflected
[15:58] in me may you see a reminder of your own
[16:01] word
[16:02] in me
[16:03] so let's read that this morning psalm
[16:05] 119 verse 49 to 56 we'll read that
[16:08] together
[16:09] remember the word unto thy servant upon
[16:13] which thou hast caused me to hold
[16:15] this is my comfort in my affliction for
[16:18] thy word hath quickened me the proud
[16:21] have had me greatly in derision yet have
[16:23] i not declined from thy law
[16:26] i remembered thy judgments of old o lord
[16:28] and have comforted myself
[16:31] horror would have taken hold upon me
[16:33] because of the wicked that forsake thy
[16:35] law thy statutes have been my songs in
[16:37] the house of my pilgrimage i have
[16:40] remembered thy name o lord in the night
[16:42] and have kept thy lord this i had
[16:45] because i kept thy precept
[16:51] amen god bless you and have your seats
[16:55] i mean i'd sing at calvary this morning
[16:58] amen

[43:04] said many times we're not a religion
[43:06] we're a people
[43:08] we're an elected people that come from a
[43:13] father
[43:14] and so we're we're not different in any
[43:17] way we're all the same purchased with
[43:19] the same blood and
[43:20] it's just wonderful to have that unity
[43:23] and and to know that the gospel is
[43:26] certainly the same
[43:27] amen it's nice to be here with brother
[43:30] ron today is
[43:32] you know brother when i came out of my
[43:34] egypt brother ron came out of my egypt
[43:36] with me

[44:44] understand that
[44:46] we're not getting farther apart we're
[44:48] getting closer together
[44:51] i think there's a desire amongst the
[44:53] bride now to
[44:54] to get everything that's in between us
[44:57] out of the way
[44:59] to have our heart and our focus on one
[45:02] thing only and that's him
[45:05] to be totally brought into remembrance
[45:08] of the love that he expressed for us
[45:11] when he laid that life down at calvary
[45:15] and he gave us a place that we can meet
[45:17] him
[45:18] and that we can all be equal
[45:21] and so the word is simply applied to all
[45:24] of our hearts this morning i'm glad to
[45:26] come to church this morning
[45:28] i'm glad to sit under the word of god
[45:31] this morning

[53:30] deuteronomy
[53:34] deuteronomy chapter 4
[53:37] verses 33 through 36.
[53:44] hallelujah
[53:51] deuteronomy 4
[53:54] verses 33
[53:57] and 37 through 36.
[54:01] did ever
[54:02] people hear the voice of god speaking
[54:04] out of the midst of the fire
[54:07] as thou has heard and live
[54:11] or hath god assad to go and take him a
[54:14] nation from the midst of
[54:16] another nation
[54:17] by temptations and by signs
[54:20] and by wonders and by war and by a
[54:24] mighty hand and by a
[54:26] stretched out arm
[54:28] by the great tears according
[54:31] to all the lord your god did for you in
[54:34] egypt before your eyes
[54:37] unto thee it was showed
[54:40] that that thou mightest know that the
[54:43] lord he is god
[54:46] and there is none else beside him
[54:50] out of heaven
[54:52] he made thee to hear his voice
[54:58] no deposit
[55:01] no return
[55:04] unless you got to see to god inside of
[55:06] you
[55:07] no man can come except my father drawing
[55:14] out of heaven he made
[55:16] thee to hear his voice
[55:18] that he might instruct thee and upon
[55:21] earth he showed thee his great fire
[55:25] and thou heardest his words
[55:28] out of the midst of fire
[55:30] heavenly father now that we have read
[55:32] thy word o god
[55:34] i would ask a special anointing upon
[55:37] this
[55:38] our service today quicken us lord
[55:41] by your word and by your holy spirit
[55:43] lord
[55:44] i pray in jesus christ's name
[55:47] amen
[55:48] god bless you you all may be seated
[55:51] in the presence of the lord
[55:59] the bible says that our god is a
[56:01] consuming fire
[56:05] and he baptizes with fire
[56:09] his ministers are as flames of fire
[56:16] and this message was vindicated
[56:19] by a pillar of fire
[56:23] the bible says that we ought to fear god
[56:25] and give him reverence for our god is a
[56:28] consuming fire
[56:32] i would like to title my sermon this
[56:34] morning
[56:36] quickened by the voice
[56:41] i'd like to take a subject of the voice
[56:43] of god
[56:45] has quickening power
[56:49] turn with me to one other portion of
[56:51] scripture so that we could just
[56:54] complete our reading of the word here
[56:58] together john chapter 5
[57:01] verses 24 through 29
[57:04] john 5
[57:08] 24.
[57:11] verily verily i say unto you
[57:17] he that heareth my word
[57:20] and believeth on him that hath sent me
[57:25] hath everlasting life
[57:28] and shall not come into condemnation but
[57:30] is past
[57:32] from death unto life verily verily i say
[57:34] unto you the hour is coming and now is
[57:38] when the dead shall hear
[57:40] the voice of the son of god and them
[57:43] that hear shall live
[57:46] for as the father has life in himself
[57:50] so he hath given to the son to have life
[57:53] in himself
[57:55] and have given him authority to execute
[57:58] judgment also because he is the son of
[58:01] man
[58:03] marvel not at this for the hour is
[58:05] coming in which all that are in the
[58:06] grave shall hear his voice
[58:09] and shall come forth and they that have
[58:11] done good under the resurrection of life
[58:14] and they that have done evil unto the
[58:16] resurrection
[58:17] of damnation
[58:20] may god bless his word today
[58:24] the bible says that let him that hath an
[58:27] ear
[58:28] let him hear
[58:30] what the spirit
[58:31] is saying unto the church
[58:35] we realize that god has got a voice
[58:39] and that it is in due season
[58:43] you've got to recognize the word of god
[58:46] for your day in your hour
[58:48] that's what's brought us all together
[58:53] god sent a voice by the way of a
[58:56] vindicated prophet in this last day and
[58:58] that is what has gathered you i want you
[59:00] to understand that no man did this it
[59:02] was god that did it
[59:05] it didn't matter if you were in africa
[59:07] or in india or down in mexico or here in
[59:10] america
[59:12] he that hath an ear is going to hear
[59:14] what god says in this day
[59:19] and when that
[59:20] voice of god speaks
[59:23] it will quicken and energize the seed
[59:28] amen amen
[59:31] brother brenham says in the fourth seal
[59:33] when the real true sincere
[59:35] predestinated believer somebody say
[59:38] that's me
[59:39] yeah that's you
[59:42] when that light strikes upon that seed
[59:45] something burst forth
[59:47] to a new life
[59:51] little did
[59:52] david mcgary and i understand
[59:55] that when we came across or should i say
[59:58] the message came across our path

[1:03:36] amen i've got
[1:03:38] aunts uncles and cousins and nephews and

[1:04:03] never been to the he never seen the
[1:04:05] pacific ocean
[1:04:08] and so we were dropping down into san
[1:04:10] bernardino
[1:04:12] going across that that fault
[1:04:14] san andreas fault
[1:04:16] and i told him i said hey see that fault
[1:04:18] line over there and there's people that
[1:04:20] take
[1:04:20] cans of spray paint
[1:04:22] and they they paint a line down like you
[1:04:25] go come back a year or two later and
[1:04:27] it's already moved
[1:04:29] that shows the land was shifting anyway

[1:04:34] but down there he'd never seen the
[1:04:35] pacific ocean he's never seen waves come
[1:04:37] up
[1:04:38] and waves go back and anybody that's
[1:04:40] never done that of course the wave uh
[1:04:43] come up and he
[1:04:44] oh yeah
[1:04:45] oh that's nice so he's wanting to touch
[1:04:48] it so now it's starting to reseed back
[1:04:50] out
[1:04:51] so he follows it out about 50 feet and
[1:04:54] all of a sudden it comes back in and and
[1:04:56] so anyway here he is in his cowboy boots
[1:04:58] and everything and he
[1:05:00] he's going oh wow this is so wow
[1:05:04] and if any of you know
[1:05:06] and you stand in the ocean what what do
[1:05:09] you feel when the water recedes back out
[1:05:12] do you feel like you're sinking
[1:05:15] well all of a sudden he's he's there
[1:05:18] enjoying the
[1:05:19] like this all of a sudden he goes
[1:05:21] it's sinking
[1:05:25] he runs out of the water here's hundreds
[1:05:27] of people on the beach

[1:05:40] soon
[1:05:44] brother branham said there is a
[1:05:45] quickening power to the word of god
[1:05:50] when you hear his voice the light
[1:05:51] penetrates the darkness
[1:05:54] and and all the doubt and unbelief goes
[1:05:56] away it'll quicken to life that
[1:05:58] predestinated seed
[1:06:01] amen
[1:06:03] but you have to recognize your day and
[1:06:06] its message
[1:06:08] we are not worshiping the messenger we
[1:06:10] love him
[1:06:11] and we certainly give him preeminence
[1:06:15] but i tell you we do not
[1:06:17] worship the messenger we worship jesus
[1:06:20] christ
[1:06:22] this message
[1:06:25] caused me to fall in love with jesus
[1:06:27] christ
[1:06:31] this message
[1:06:33] is christ
[1:06:35] just as the angel refused john to
[1:06:37] worship him
[1:06:39] neither would the messenger of today
[1:06:41] take any credit
[1:06:43] for even the message he was delivering
[1:06:47] in the anointed ones at the end time
[1:06:49] you that listen to this tape you might
[1:06:51] have thought today i was trying to say
[1:06:53] that about myself being i was packing
[1:06:56] this message
[1:06:58] i have no more to do with it than
[1:06:59] nothing
[1:07:00] no more than just a voice and my voice
[1:07:04] even against my better judgment i wanted
[1:07:06] to be a trapper
[1:07:08] but it's the will of the father that i
[1:07:10] declare
[1:07:11] to do and determined to do i wasn't the
[1:07:15] one that appeared down on the river
[1:07:17] i was only standing there when he
[1:07:20] appeared
[1:07:22] i'm not the one that performs these
[1:07:24] things and foretells these sayings and
[1:07:27] happens as perfect as they are i'm only
[1:07:30] one that's near when he does it
[1:07:33] i was only a voice he used to say it
[1:07:36] it wasn't what i knew it wasn't
[1:07:39] it was i just surrendered myself to him
[1:07:43] and he spoke through
[1:07:45] it isn't me
[1:07:47] it isn't the seventh angel oh no
[1:07:50] it's a manifestation
[1:07:52] of the son of man
[1:07:55] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[1:07:58] the mystery that god unfolded
[1:08:00] it's not a man it's god
[1:08:04] the angel was not the son of man he was
[1:08:06] a messenger from the son of man the son
[1:08:09] of man is christ and he's the only one
[1:08:12] that you're feeding on
[1:08:14] you're not feeding on a man
[1:08:16] somebody say hallelujah
[1:08:18] you are not feeding on a man his his
[1:08:20] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:08:23] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:08:26] man
[1:08:27] hallelujah
[1:08:29] amen brother david and i we started this
[1:08:32] message together early as young men
[1:08:36] and we were talking yesterday in
[1:08:37] fellowshipping
[1:08:39] and really brother david what has kept
[1:08:41] us together on this message
[1:08:44] is we began to see something that others
[1:08:46] didn't
[1:08:48] something greater something more than
[1:08:50] church order
[1:08:54] we began to see the
[1:08:56] unfolding and revealing of the son of
[1:08:58] man
[1:09:01] hallelujah
[1:09:03] prophets are always
[1:09:06] representatives of the mouthpiece of god
[1:09:10] god uses them to speak to his people god
[1:09:12] speaks through a prophet
[1:09:15] in revelations 10 a very familiar
[1:09:18] portion of scripture verse 7 through 11
[1:09:21] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:09:23] seventh angel didn't say in the days of
[1:09:25] his life
[1:09:27] said in the days of his voice
[1:09:30] brother ram said not when he began to
[1:09:32] speak
[1:09:33] but when he began to unfold the word
[1:09:39] and when he shall begin to sound the
[1:09:41] mystery of god should be finished
[1:09:44] as he hath declared to his servants the
[1:09:46] prophets and the voice which i heard
[1:09:48] from heaven spake unto me again
[1:09:51] and said take the little book which is
[1:09:53] open in the hand of the angel
[1:09:55] which standeth upon the scene upon the
[1:09:57] earth
[1:09:59] and i went under the angel said unto him
[1:10:01] give me the little book
[1:10:04] and he said unto me take it
[1:10:06] and eat it up
[1:10:08] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[1:10:10] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[1:10:13] and i took the little book out of the
[1:10:15] angel's hand
[1:10:17] and ate it up
[1:10:18] and it was in my mouth sweetest honey
[1:10:21] and as soon as i had eaten it
[1:10:24] my belly was bitter
[1:10:26] and he said unto me
[1:10:28] thou must prophesy again
[1:10:30] for many peoples and nations and tongues
[1:10:34] and kings
[1:10:36] i want you to notice that it was after
[1:10:38] the angel messenger had finished his
[1:10:40] message
[1:10:41] it was after the mystery of god was
[1:10:44] finished
[1:10:45] that the voice spoke to john john who is
[1:10:47] a type of the bride
[1:10:50] take the book take that revealed word
[1:10:52] and need it what good are tapes and
[1:10:54] books if you don't
[1:10:57] take them into you
[1:10:59] what is
[1:11:00] what is horrible is to have someone die
[1:11:05] in a grocery store
[1:11:09] die of hunger
[1:11:11] why wouldn't they take the food off the
[1:11:12] shelf and eat it
[1:11:14] why do people just collect the tapes and
[1:11:17] books and don't read them
[1:11:21] take them down
[1:11:23] take that book and eat it
[1:11:28] john was obedient took it and ate it up
[1:11:33] he didn't just say collect tapes and
[1:11:35] books
[1:11:36] or just distribute tapes and books
[1:11:40] or to just agree with it
[1:11:43] but to take it
[1:11:45] you need it
[1:11:47] you know when you take something and you
[1:11:48] eat it you assimilate it into yourself
[1:11:50] and whatever you were eating you become
[1:11:54] thou must prophesy
[1:11:56] see not the angel on the earth thou must
[1:11:59] prophesy
[1:12:01] revelations 10 1 the mighty angel
[1:12:04] anointed revelations 10 7.
[1:12:07] and revelations 10 7 anointed
[1:12:09] revelations 10 8 take the book and eat
[1:12:12] it
[1:12:12] do you see the order of the
[1:12:14] condescending of god
[1:12:17] you're a part of this my brother and
[1:12:19] sister
[1:12:22] thou must prophesy
[1:12:24] so now the voice of god is in the bride
[1:12:28] she is the final voice to the final age
[1:12:37] in the laodicean church age brother
[1:12:39] branham says page 340
[1:12:42] a momentary consideration of church
[1:12:45] history
[1:12:46] will prove how accurate this thought is
[1:12:50] in the dark ages the word was almost
[1:12:52] entirely lost to the people
[1:12:55] but god sent luther with the word
[1:12:58] the lutheran spoke for god at that time
[1:13:02] but they organized and again a pure word
[1:13:04] was lost for organization
[1:13:07] tends towards
[1:13:08] dogma and creeds
[1:13:10] and not the simple word
[1:13:12] they could no longer speak for god for
[1:13:15] when god sent wesley
[1:13:17] he was the voice with the word in his
[1:13:19] day and the people who took his
[1:13:21] revelation
[1:13:22] from god became the living epistles
[1:13:26] read and known of all men for their
[1:13:27] generation
[1:13:29] and when the method is failed god raised
[1:13:31] up by
[1:13:32] others
[1:13:33] and so it has gone on down through the
[1:13:36] years until this last day
[1:13:39] there is again another people in the
[1:13:41] land
[1:13:42] hallelujah
[1:13:45] who under their messenger
[1:13:48] will be the final voice
[1:13:51] to the final age
[1:13:56] when god speaks
[1:13:58] things happen
[1:14:02] i want you to just think that everything
[1:14:04] that god has ever done
[1:14:07] he quickened
[1:14:09] with his voice
[1:14:11] brother branham said he could have
[1:14:12] thought about things
[1:14:15] for eons of time but until his mouth
[1:14:18] spoke it
[1:14:20] because the spoken word
[1:14:23] is the original seed
[1:14:26] and so the thought now came down from
[1:14:29] the womb of his mind
[1:14:32] and then god spoken and he said let
[1:14:34] there be light
[1:14:36] see there could not be light until he
[1:14:38] spoke it he quickened the sun
[1:14:41] with his very creative words let there
[1:14:44] be light and there was light
[1:14:46] everything that god did he has quickened
[1:14:49] with his voice
[1:14:51] is it any different today that if god
[1:14:54] were to send a voice a messenger that he
[1:14:57] would quicken you you weren't quickened
[1:15:00] by william branham you weren't quickened
[1:15:02] by your pastors you weren't quickened by
[1:15:05] people around you you're quickened by
[1:15:07] god himself
[1:15:10] hallelujah
[1:15:14] everything that god does
[1:15:18] he quickens with his voice
[1:15:24] everything
[1:15:26] john 15 16 and you have not chosen me
[1:15:30] i've chosen you
[1:15:32] and ordained you
[1:15:34] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[1:15:37] and that your fruit should remain and
[1:15:39] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[1:15:42] in my name he may give it to you
[1:15:45] god's will only quickens
[1:15:49] that which is ordained to life
[1:15:52] the prophet of god says watch i can show
[1:15:54] you many times through the scriptures
[1:15:57] he says that if there is an elect seed
[1:16:01] he said the spirit of god will be
[1:16:02] directed to that elect seed and the
[1:16:04] others won't catch it
[1:16:07] he said the woman at the well for
[1:16:08] example there she was shrouded with
[1:16:11] doubts and unbelief and false teachings
[1:16:16] give me to drink
[1:16:19] it's not customary
[1:16:21] that you should ask of me to give you a
[1:16:24] drink
[1:16:26] and he says if you knew who it was
[1:16:30] you would ask him to give you
[1:16:33] living water
[1:16:36] it wasn't until she asked
[1:16:40] finally she said give me this water
[1:16:43] and the very reason she went to the well
[1:16:45] she left her water pot and ran into the
[1:16:48] city
[1:16:50] that's why your whole life changes
[1:16:53] i tell you coming across the god of this
[1:16:55] message is a life-changing
[1:16:58] experience
[1:17:00] hallelujah
[1:17:04] acts chapter 13 verse 48 when the
[1:17:06] gentiles heard this they were glad
[1:17:09] glorified the word of the lord for as
[1:17:11] many as were ordained somebody say
[1:17:13] ordained
[1:17:14] as many as we're ordained
[1:17:17] to eternal life
[1:17:19] believed
[1:17:23] you don't persuade anybody into this
[1:17:26] you don't talk them into it
[1:17:33] if they're like seed
[1:17:35] you just preach truth
[1:17:39] where did you get this
[1:17:42] huh
[1:17:43] wow i've never heard anyone speak
[1:17:46] where'd you get this knowledge
[1:17:48] hallelujah
[1:17:51] you were ordained to hear the voice of
[1:17:53] god
[1:17:58] brother branham preaches 14 sermons
[1:18:02] by taking the
[1:18:03] the scripture of exodus chapter 23
[1:18:07] verses 20 through 24.
[1:18:10] behold i send an angel before thee
[1:18:13] to keep thee in the way and to bring
[1:18:15] thee into the place
[1:18:17] which i have prepared beware of him
[1:18:20] and obey his voice provoke him not
[1:18:23] for he will not pardon your
[1:18:25] transgressions for my name
[1:18:28] is in him
[1:18:30] but if thou shall indeed obey his voice
[1:18:33] and do all that i speak then will i be
[1:18:35] an enemy to under thine enemies
[1:18:38] and an adversary into thine enemy
[1:18:41] adversaries
[1:18:42] for mine angels shall go before thee and
[1:18:45] bring thee
[1:18:46] unto the amorites and the hittites and
[1:18:49] the parasites and
[1:18:51] the canaanites and the hivites and the
[1:18:53] jebusites
[1:18:55] and all of the other parasites
[1:18:57] and i will cut them off
[1:19:01] thou shall not bow down to their gods
[1:19:03] nor serve them nor do after their works
[1:19:05] but thou shalt utterly
[1:19:07] overthrow them and quite break down
[1:19:09] their images
[1:19:11] brother branham uses this sermon this
[1:19:14] scripture excuse me in over 14 sermons
[1:19:18] every time he is emphasizing that god
[1:19:20] sending a messenger
[1:19:22] and says to emphasize to obey his voice
[1:19:25] listen carefully when god sends a
[1:19:27] prophet among you
[1:19:30] when it speaks it's the same as god
[1:19:33] speaking
[1:19:36] there is always a voice representation
[1:19:40] on the earth since eden
[1:19:42] god's always had a believer somewhere
[1:19:46] that he could use as his voice
[1:19:49] and when the prophet left the scene
[1:19:52] god was already raising up other ones
[1:19:55] it wasn't just a singular
[1:19:58] but a many-membered body
[1:20:02] just as john was commanded to take the
[1:20:04] book
[1:20:05] of redemption and eat it up and after he
[1:20:08] partake of the message
[1:20:09] or that revealed word of the hour it was
[1:20:11] his turn to speak
[1:20:17] revelations 22 verse 17 says
[1:20:20] the spirit and the bride
[1:20:24] so notice what the spirit is saying the
[1:20:27] bride will be saying the same thing the
[1:20:29] spirit and the bride say come
[1:20:32] let him that heareth say come and let
[1:20:34] him that a thirst come and whosoever
[1:20:36] will let him take you the water of life
[1:20:38] freely
[1:20:40] give you a personal testimony
[1:20:43] i had a friend of mine he was hunting
[1:20:44] with brother branham
[1:20:46] they were up in colorado
[1:20:49] they were sitting around the campfire
[1:20:52] just a few of the brothers and he says
[1:20:54] you know the bible says
[1:20:56] let whosoever will
[1:20:58] let him come he said but it's not
[1:21:04] they all raised their eyebrows
[1:21:06] but he said
[1:21:08] that's what the word says
[1:21:11] he says no man can come except the
[1:21:13] father calls him first
[1:21:16] do you see
[1:21:18] we've got to have a full balance on the
[1:21:20] word of god i thank god that this
[1:21:22] message has given us a balance
[1:21:25] huh hallelujah
[1:21:32] brother branham says in the true easter
[1:21:34] seal
[1:21:35] notice as soon as the voice of abel was
[1:21:37] silent and death
[1:21:39] god raised up seth to take his place
[1:21:42] god kept his voice alive with the
[1:21:44] prophets
[1:21:46] they spoke the word of god and they
[1:21:47] stoned them and as soon as the they
[1:21:49] would stone one and put him away god had
[1:21:51] raised up another one
[1:21:53] and down through the ages he kept his
[1:21:55] voice alive before the people all the
[1:21:57] way from eden
[1:22:00] brother brennan preached a sermon called
[1:22:02] the voice of god in phoenix
[1:22:05] he says when you hear my voice harden
[1:22:08] not your heart
[1:22:09] as in the days of provocation now is the
[1:22:12] time
[1:22:13] and this is the acceptable time that if
[1:22:15] any man will hear my voice
[1:22:18] that goes to show that his voice would
[1:22:20] still be there in the midst of all the
[1:22:22] chaos he's still got a voice why
[1:22:26] his voice will
[1:22:27] ever remain
[1:22:30] here it is heavens and earth will pass
[1:22:32] away but my voice
[1:22:34] shall not pass away his word
[1:22:38] amen
[1:22:40] ezekiel says
[1:22:43] 43 verse 2 and behold the glory of
[1:22:46] the god of israel came in the way of the
[1:22:48] east and his voice was like the
[1:22:51] noise of many waters
[1:22:56] sound
[1:22:58] of many waters
[1:23:00] i was in
[1:23:02] kinshasa congo
[1:23:04] any of you know where that place is at
[1:23:08] we were there and there was thousands i
[1:23:10] don't know how many thousands we had
[1:23:14] there
[1:23:15] and he said let's just all pray
[1:23:18] as a congregation
[1:23:20] and as they began to pray in the whole
[1:23:22] congregate thousands of voices raised up
[1:23:27] and i have a video of it and it sounds
[1:23:31] like the cataract of a waterfall the
[1:23:33] sound
[1:23:35] of many waters
[1:23:38] do you understand that when you
[1:23:40] raise your voice
[1:23:42] and you speak your voice and that voice
[1:23:45] joins this voice and this voice and this
[1:23:48] voice pretty soon it's the sound
[1:23:51] of many waters
[1:23:53] thank you lord thou hast many waters
[1:23:57] all over the world in every country
[1:24:06] amen
[1:24:07] voices of many waters patmos vision
[1:24:10] brother bram said what does waters
[1:24:11] represent
[1:24:13] what is his voice it's a judgment the
[1:24:15] voice of the ministers
[1:24:17] through the holy spirit that cried out
[1:24:19] to the people in every age standing
[1:24:21] there
[1:24:22] the voice of many waters cried out
[1:24:24] thickness and multitudes
[1:24:26] the voice of those seven stars in his
[1:24:28] hand to every church age
[1:24:30] preaching the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:33] the baptism in jesus name speaking in
[1:24:36] tongues the power of god the
[1:24:37] resurrection of christ
[1:24:39] the second coming divine judgment
[1:24:42] the voice of many waters coming forth
[1:24:45] from this one that looked like the son
[1:24:47] of man
[1:24:48] many waters
[1:24:49] you see it it is a
[1:24:51] antichrist spirit that wants to silence
[1:24:54] the voice of god
[1:25:03] do you know that the false church has a
[1:25:05] voice also
[1:25:09] the voice of politics voices of
[1:25:13] voting in and voting out
[1:25:16] the voice of religion and denomination
[1:25:20] that is the voice of education the voice
[1:25:23] of church theology
[1:25:29] we picked that up in the book of acts
[1:25:31] chapter 12.
[1:25:36] i'm trying to work my computer here
[1:25:39] and i'm not good at this so let me see
[1:25:41] here hold on oh okay
[1:25:45] it's not i don't use one at the pulpit
[1:25:47] normally i print it out but i didn't
[1:25:49] have time to print it out
[1:25:51] in acts chapter 12 verses 21 and 24
[1:25:55] and upon a set day herod a roid arrayed
[1:25:59] in royal apparel sat upon his throne and
[1:26:01] made an oration unto them
[1:26:04] and he gave the
[1:26:06] and the people gave a shout saying
[1:26:08] it is the voice of a god
[1:26:12] and not of man
[1:26:15] and immediately the angel of the lord
[1:26:17] smote him
[1:26:19] because he gave not god the glory and he
[1:26:21] was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost
[1:26:25] but the word of god grew and multiplied
[1:26:28] notice it said it was the voice of a god
[1:26:31] not the voice
[1:26:32] of god
[1:26:34] how many people make a godlike man
[1:26:38] their image
[1:26:40] false prophets
[1:26:42] movie stars idols
[1:26:45] all of these athletes
[1:26:48] so much are called the voice of god
[1:26:50] today that it cause
[1:26:52] causes confusion
[1:26:57] in the sermon voice of god
[1:27:00] 1963 god has promised to meet the need
[1:27:03] of the hour
[1:27:04] he always does it
[1:27:06] we
[1:27:07] need the voice of god today to meet the
[1:27:09] need of the hour
[1:27:11] to meet the time we're living in
[1:27:14] and after he promised it we can rest
[1:27:16] assured he'll keep his promise
[1:27:19] and today one reason that the church is
[1:27:21] in the condition that it's in
[1:27:23] is because there's so many voices
[1:27:27] so many other voices to attract the
[1:27:29] church from the voice of god
[1:27:32] until it's very doubtful that many would
[1:27:33] hear the voice of god though it spoke
[1:27:36] right
[1:27:37] in their midst there's perhaps
[1:27:40] they perhaps
[1:27:42] wouldn't even understand it because it's
[1:27:44] a foreign thing to them
[1:27:47] they have
[1:27:48] got themselves so many centered around
[1:27:50] the voices
[1:27:52] of the day
[1:27:54] the voice of god became foreign to them
[1:27:58] why because there were so many other
[1:28:00] voices
[1:28:02] and then if god promised he would give
[1:28:04] us that and if other voices are contrary
[1:28:06] to the voice of god
[1:28:08] then it must be the voice of the enemy
[1:28:10] to try to confuse us
[1:28:14] we must
[1:28:15] not understand
[1:28:21] that we excuse me that we
[1:28:23] would not
[1:28:25] understand the voice of god when it was
[1:28:26] spoke so many voices in the earth today
[1:28:30] absolutely hard thing because it deadens
[1:28:33] the voice of god of the supernatural
[1:28:36] so many intellectual voices
[1:28:39] you know it's amazing how people can try
[1:28:41] to think they're so spiritual because
[1:28:43] they got something so intellectual
[1:28:45] i remember
[1:28:47] at a meeting one time hundreds of
[1:28:49] people's there
[1:28:51] there was a brother preaching
[1:28:54] and i'll tell you what you know i'm not
[1:28:56] the most spiritual guy in the world
[1:28:59] but when he got done it was still a
[1:29:01] mystery
[1:29:04] he preached this mystery in that mystery
[1:29:06] and it still was a mystery
[1:29:08] now when you hear the prophet speak
[1:29:11] it never
[1:29:12] remains a mystery
[1:29:14] no you catch the you catch something you
[1:29:17] see something hallelujah god questions
[1:29:20] it to you but what's amazing how many
[1:29:22] people get one another spirit and if
[1:29:26] if you know like he did this now watch
[1:29:28] this i want all of you be real spiritual
[1:29:30] now i want you to catch this all the
[1:29:32] people sitting there like this oh
[1:29:34] now if you're spiritual you catches
[1:29:40] no no no
[1:29:41] you didn't get it
[1:29:43] are you spiritual listen
[1:29:45] watch
[1:29:52] they didn't get it either
[1:29:55] but when i was there somebody went
[1:29:57] hallelujah another one oh glory to god
[1:30:02] and i went to him after
[1:30:04] what
[1:30:06] what does this mean
[1:30:09] you see sometimes you can try to get so
[1:30:12] spiritual
[1:30:14] talk above the people
[1:30:17] i don't believe you ever have the gospel
[1:30:19] it should ever be above the people it
[1:30:21] should be down where they live
[1:30:23] the bible said even a wafering man would
[1:30:25] understand it
[1:30:26] not some intellectual something about
[1:30:29] you know some big thing in the sky and
[1:30:31] over here and this mystery that mystery
[1:30:33] and it's still a mystery and people go
[1:30:35] well praise god wasn't that a good
[1:30:37] service it was so deep i never even got
[1:30:40] it
[1:30:42] you gotta be kidding me
[1:30:49] just stay simple
[1:30:53] brother branham said in the unchangeable
[1:30:55] god how many of you believe that he's
[1:30:57] the same
[1:30:58] yesterday today and forever god don't
[1:31:01] change now watch his prophet say this
[1:31:05] well now he has no hands on earth but
[1:31:08] mine and yours
[1:31:11] his voice
[1:31:12] on earth is ours
[1:31:16] our voice is given to him
[1:31:19] that's why we preach the gospel we
[1:31:21] believe it's not us
[1:31:24] we're inspired to preach those things
[1:31:25] but the holy spirit
[1:31:27] is speaking through us
[1:31:30] amen
[1:31:35] god always has a way of making his voice
[1:31:37] known to the people
[1:31:40] he sends prophets he gives them signs
[1:31:43] takes his voice and that's been spoken
[1:31:45] on
[1:31:46] before
[1:31:48] on his word and vindicates it by this
[1:31:50] man and they know
[1:31:52] that it's his voice because it's a
[1:31:54] promised word of the day
[1:31:57] amen
[1:32:00] all of you
[1:32:01] my brother and sister
[1:32:03] that are here
[1:32:05] i trust if your predestinated seed
[1:32:08] you have been quickened
[1:32:10] energized activated manifested
[1:32:14] in this hour
[1:32:16] if you say that you believe the message
[1:32:18] of the hour let me see it in your life
[1:32:24] your revelation must give manifestation
[1:32:29] amen
[1:32:32] tell me that you believe this message
[1:32:34] and still cut your hair
[1:32:38] brother brown said that that one
[1:32:41] pastor introduced his wife to brother
[1:32:43] branham said she's a real saint and he
[1:32:45] says i looked at her and said she looks
[1:32:47] more like a hain
[1:32:49] because she ain't got it
[1:32:52] you remember that one lady up there
[1:32:54] where that highfalutin lady put her hand
[1:32:56] up there gave it to brother brown well
[1:32:58] how do you do brother abraham said bring
[1:33:00] it on down here if you want me to shake
[1:33:02] it
[1:33:04] i love
[1:33:05] that this message is real
[1:33:09] it's not above us it's right here where
[1:33:11] we live
[1:33:15] amen
[1:33:18] you have been quickened by the voice of
[1:33:20] god
[1:33:22] it's caused you to raise up and it's had
[1:33:24] an effect upon you
[1:33:29] brother david
[1:33:32] would you have ever thought
[1:33:35] that what we came across would change
[1:33:38] our lives
[1:33:40] and make us leave california
[1:33:43] and leave everything behind us
[1:33:47] who would have ever thought
[1:33:51] just a bunch of young kids
[1:33:54] but when we got a hold of this
[1:33:58] there's something about seeing
[1:34:01] others that you've met before
[1:34:03] but there's nothing like old friends
[1:34:07] amen
[1:34:09] and nothing like old friends
[1:34:13] brother david and i we hug next
[1:34:26] just before i came out
[1:34:28] he said i love you brother ron
[1:34:30] i said i love you brother david
[1:34:38] all of a sudden i was transported back
[1:34:40] man
[1:34:43] to a young man that heard this message
[1:34:48] see nobody convinced us
[1:34:52] nobody talked us into it
[1:34:55] oh i'll tell you what we'd come we'd
[1:34:57] come to meetings
[1:34:59] we're just playing tapes we don't know
[1:35:00] nothing about going to church or
[1:35:02] preachers or anything
[1:35:05] we just come and we play a tape and when
[1:35:09] we hear what he said we just believed it
[1:35:13] he said long hair on a man
[1:35:15] uh you know as wrong as perverted
[1:35:18] and those of us that sat there with our
[1:35:20] long hair wow
[1:35:25] i remember going and i had
[1:35:28] hair
[1:35:29] long hair and
[1:35:31] nobody no no nobody none of the
[1:35:33] believers told me cut my hair
[1:35:36] so one day i walk in by the mirror and i
[1:35:38] see my long hair and i thought
[1:35:40] i need to i need to
[1:35:43] cut my hair so anyway i got my hair cut
[1:35:45] went to the meeting
[1:35:47] later that day and guess what i went in
[1:35:49] and shook everybody's hand
[1:35:50] i walked by everybody
[1:35:55] nobody said nothing
[1:35:57] nobody and so i turned it i had audacity
[1:36:00] enough i turned the tape off i said
[1:36:02] isn't anyone
[1:36:04] going to congratulate me that i cut my
[1:36:07] hair
[1:36:09] no we expected now shut up and turn the
[1:36:12] tape back on
[1:36:17] you don't listen
[1:36:19] if you take everything away from
[1:36:22] everybody they'll resent you but if they
[1:36:24] give it to god
[1:36:26] it's a different story
[1:36:29] god has called you to this message
[1:36:32] not to just listen to it
[1:36:35] but to obey it
[1:36:37] to believe it to assimilate it into your
[1:36:40] life that the word of god
[1:36:43] did not just stay
[1:36:45] on a tape but that tape was assimilated
[1:36:48] into a
[1:36:49] multi-membered body
[1:36:51] called the mystical body of jesus christ
[1:36:55] and here we are
[1:36:56] look at you you are sermons
[1:37:00] in living epistles
[1:37:03] the world looks at you
[1:37:06] and they can't understand you why
[1:37:07] because god is a mystery
[1:37:12] so lying within each one of you
[1:37:15] is a part of the mystery of god that
[1:37:17] must make itself manifest
[1:37:20] amen
[1:37:22] wow
[1:37:26] i'm done
[1:37:30] i have something on my heart for you
[1:37:32] tonight
[1:37:34] that i'd like to share with you but i
[1:37:39] i didn't feel good last night
[1:37:44] i've been very very sick
[1:37:47] if i'd have been home i'd have gone to
[1:37:48] the hospital
[1:37:51] so i wrestled
[1:37:53] oh god
[1:37:55] sandy woke me up
[1:37:58] she said are you are you gonna preach i
[1:38:00] said yep
[1:38:05] so
[1:38:08] any of you know what diverticulitis is
[1:38:12] i had a real real bad bout of it last
[1:38:15] night
[1:38:16] and i i tell you i just tossed and
[1:38:18] turned and moaned and groaned all night
[1:38:22] and i couldn't do it to my friend
[1:38:24] david and tell him that hey i i can't
[1:38:27] preach this morning
[1:38:30] and so
[1:38:33] i daresome eat anything everything is
[1:38:36] any of you know anything about it so
[1:38:39] i'm sorry brother david i've kind of cut
[1:38:41] it a little bit short this morning
[1:38:45] but god knows
[1:38:48] and i'm sweating inside of my coat right
[1:38:50] now
[1:38:52] beads of sweat just going down my back
[1:38:55] because i've had
[1:38:57] chills and different things
[1:39:00] and
[1:39:01] so i apologize for that
[1:39:04] i would have loved to have preached a
[1:39:06] couple of like your like your past he
[1:39:08] probably two three hours he just
[1:39:18] no
[1:39:19] anyway
[1:39:21] i do love god and i love this message
[1:39:25] i've been a fool for christ ever since i
[1:39:27] came into this message
[1:39:30] amen
[1:39:31] i have been
[1:39:33] even the brothers have brought me to the
[1:39:35] message
[1:39:36] and i remember and i'm just gonna close
[1:39:38] with a couple little testimonies here
[1:39:41] i remember
[1:39:43] some of the brothers that brought me to
[1:39:44] the message they told me brother ron you
[1:39:46] know the beatles are in the bible
[1:39:49] the beatles
[1:39:51] in the bible
[1:39:53] yeah they are you know what's another
[1:39:55] word for beetle
[1:39:56] locust
[1:39:59] oh in the book of revelation locust and
[1:40:01] they got breastplates of iron that's
[1:40:04] their guitar
[1:40:05] they sound like roaring lions yeah
[1:40:08] yeah yeah right
[1:40:10] and they got stinging their tail and the
[1:40:12] sound of thundering chariot
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:16] i'm going wow
[1:40:19] that's the most fire the beatles
[1:40:22] are in the bible
[1:40:24] but then when i found out when brother
[1:40:30] i found out what brother brenham said
[1:40:32] about
[1:40:33] the locust and he never said the beatles
[1:40:35] are in the butt
[1:40:38] so i went to the brothers i said
[1:40:40] that ain't in the bible
[1:40:42] well it's not even in the message
[1:40:45] yeah well it's far out man
[1:40:48] and
[1:40:50] and i said what
[1:40:52] yeah it just blows people's mind and i
[1:40:54] tell them stuff like and i said well
[1:40:56] we're not here to blow people's mind
[1:40:58] excuse me that's our old
[1:41:01] drug terminology
[1:41:03] you know hey no no we preached from
[1:41:06] truth
[1:41:08] so guess what they did
[1:41:10] the next morning the two elders said
[1:41:13] god told us
[1:41:15] to not say another word to you these are
[1:41:17] people who brought me the message
[1:41:20] not to share anything spiritual with any
[1:41:22] you anymore
[1:41:25] and i was absolutely
[1:41:28] struck
[1:41:30] where do i go
[1:41:33] there's nobody else i know in the world
[1:41:35] nobody in the world david we didn't know
[1:41:37] of all these people around the world
[1:41:39] that believe this messi
[1:41:44] where do i go
[1:41:49] to have people that bring you to the
[1:41:51] message
[1:41:52] and then excommunicate you
[1:41:55] but i found out god did it for a purpose
[1:41:59] i stood for god's word in the very
[1:42:01] beginning
[1:42:02] and god spared me from all of the false
[1:42:05] doctrine
[1:42:07] and all of the nonsense
[1:42:10] and where are those people today
[1:42:14] they all hit the ditch somewhere
[1:42:17] and then look at a couple
[1:42:19] young kids
[1:42:21] that stayed with the word
[1:42:23] and you know what we ain't the biggest
[1:42:25] church
[1:42:26] we need to shout in this church
[1:42:29] we need the most intellectual pastors
[1:42:31] ain't that right david
[1:42:36] he was thinking on that one let me see
[1:42:40] but we're still here
[1:42:42] [Music]
[1:42:44] how many have hit the ditch and gone
[1:42:46] here and there and gone off into some
[1:42:48] false doctrine
[1:42:50] but god by his grace rich in mercy
[1:42:53] has kept us
[1:42:55] i am not kept
[1:42:57] by myself i am kept by the power of god
[1:43:01] do you love him this morning
[1:43:03] somebody say praise god
[1:43:05] amen i love you thank you for coming
[1:43:08] here this morning i'm going to turn it
[1:43:09] over to brother david i do have
[1:43:11] something for you tonight and if i if
[1:43:14] i'll get some strength in my body and
[1:43:16] i'll be able to to rise to the
[1:43:18] inspiration maybe the lord will help me
[1:43:20] to give it to you i love you thank you
[1:43:22] brother david i'm going to turn it over
[1:43:23] [Applause]
[1:43:33] you know it
[1:43:34] it's
[1:43:36] the same voice that took two people down
[1:43:38] two different paths
[1:43:40] and have them end up in the same spot
[1:43:44] you know when we left uh
[1:43:46] california
[1:43:48] brother ron
[1:43:50] went up the west coast into oregon and
[1:43:53] washington
[1:43:54] with a group of brothers and then the
[1:43:56] group that i had
[1:43:58] we went up
[1:43:59] in to montana
[1:44:02] and uh
[1:44:03] and
[1:44:04] the stories would go on
[1:44:07] forever
[1:44:09] of the things that we've seen
[1:44:11] god do and
[1:44:13] and
[1:44:14] and then
[1:44:15] i moved from montana and he moved from
[1:44:17] oregon
[1:44:19] and we both moved into flagstaff
[1:44:22] together
[1:44:23] and
[1:44:24] those
[1:44:25] three years that i spent in flagstaff
[1:44:28] with ron and sandy and
[1:44:30] uh
[1:44:31] where
[1:44:34] some of the best years of my life
[1:44:38] you know when we went through things
[1:44:40] back then we went through things
[1:44:41] together there wasn't i don't know if
[1:44:43] there's this many people
[1:44:45] in the country that believed the message
[1:44:49] when we first come in the books weren't
[1:44:52] printed the tapes weren't out
[1:44:54] you know we didn't have everything but
[1:44:56] we had that one thing that
[1:44:58] brother ron spoke to us this morning
[1:45:01] and that's that something in your heart
[1:45:04] that receives the word of god
[1:45:07] and and with young people even with
[1:45:10] people when they get older we always
[1:45:12] talk about young people you know but
[1:45:15] older people or middle-aged people
[1:45:18] are all drawn away
[1:45:21] by voices
[1:45:23] and by opportunities
[1:45:25] and and by things that are presented to
[1:45:28] them but when you have that still small
[1:45:32] voice on the inside
[1:45:34] and you can
[1:45:35] finally let that lead and guide you
[1:45:40] that's where all the unity lies and
[1:45:42] that's where all the victory lies
[1:45:44] is god he doesn't work from the outside
[1:45:47] in he works from the inside out
[1:45:50] he speaks to your heart i like how
[1:45:52] brother ron said he spoke to his heart
[1:45:54] and when we left california
[1:45:58] like brother ron went up there up the
[1:46:01] west coast i went up into montana
[1:46:04] we didn't leave knowing everything we
[1:46:07] all had long hair
[1:46:09] you know what i mean we didn't hear that
[1:46:11] yet
[1:46:12] we didn't need to hear that yet because
[1:46:15] we settled in our heart what the voice
[1:46:17] was
[1:46:19] what it was saying
[1:46:21] and we understood the absoluteness of it
[1:46:24] and it became our absolute
[1:46:26] we settled that early on that this is
[1:46:29] the voice of god
[1:46:32] amen this was the thing that stirred us
[1:46:35] this was the thing that woke us this is
[1:46:37] the thing that
[1:46:38] led us and this is what we're going to
[1:46:41] let lead us
[1:46:42] and any real
[1:46:45] servant of god will never insert himself
[1:46:48] in between that relationship
[1:46:51] amen
[1:46:52] he'll tell you like our brother did eat
[1:46:54] the book
[1:46:57] listen to the tapes
[1:46:59] know it for yourself
[1:47:01] let that voice speak to the inside of
[1:47:03] your heart
[1:47:05] because it'll all put us in unity it'll
[1:47:08] all put us in one accord just as we
[1:47:11] shared here and and you know
[1:47:13] when we come back
[1:47:16] we needed one another to survive
[1:47:20] we did we couldn't do it without one
[1:47:24] another
[1:47:25] i i didn't have work and
[1:47:28] i had to go cut timber
[1:47:30] uh
[1:47:31] what we call fence post a lodgepole pine
[1:47:34] you cut it into fence post and
[1:47:36] brother ron would go out with me and i'd
[1:47:39] cut the post down and he'd stack them
[1:47:41] that wasn't very fair
[1:47:45] but that's all you could do
[1:47:48] and i couldn't do it without him and
[1:47:49] we'd stack these posts up and and
[1:47:52] everything and we'd talk about the word
[1:47:55] of the lord we're driving down the road
[1:47:57] one day and
[1:47:58] and we just get excited about the word
[1:48:01] of god we're talking about
[1:48:02] predestination we're just thinking
[1:48:05] there about how we came out of
[1:48:06] california
[1:48:08] and how we met there at that church and
[1:48:11] and i heard the message
[1:48:13] i had a fella come to me and
[1:48:16] i had to come up commune many of you
[1:48:19] heard our testimony i had a
[1:48:22] a hippie commune which was popular back
[1:48:25] then and we'd kind of come to the lord
[1:48:27] and
[1:48:28] had this hippie commune and
[1:48:31] we're going to this church as a
[1:48:33] charismatic church remember we'd all sit
[1:48:36] around and sing they will know we are
[1:48:39] christians
[1:48:41] by our love they will know that we are
[1:48:45] christians by our love
[1:48:48] you know we'd all sing those songs and
[1:48:50] we'd all sway you know but
[1:48:53] and me and ron would be arm and arm just
[1:48:56] just playing together you know
[1:48:59] and
[1:49:02] and some man came and started telling me
[1:49:05] things
[1:49:06] and
[1:49:08] they struck my heart
[1:49:10] he said you know women shouldn't wear
[1:49:12] pants
[1:49:14] yeah i know
[1:49:16] why would that strike my heart
[1:49:19] we had pants but all our pants were
[1:49:21] what nowadays would be moz we didn't
[1:49:24] know and
[1:49:25] and he'd just say these things
[1:49:28] and
[1:49:29] never knew
[1:49:30] never tell us where he got him
[1:49:32] so i went and broke into his house
[1:49:39] and i found a book
[1:49:43] and i and that was a spoken word book
[1:49:47] and i read it
[1:49:48] and uh
[1:49:50] and so you know i sent for some tapes
[1:49:52] and brother ron sent for some tapes and
[1:49:55] out of those groups of tapes we got we
[1:49:58] both picked
[1:50:00] choosing of a bride
[1:50:05] and so we're driving down the road
[1:50:07] thinking about that time that we
[1:50:10] had together and how we came out of
[1:50:13] california and how we ended up here in
[1:50:15] flagstaff and here we are together and
[1:50:17] we got talking about predestination
[1:50:20] and our names being
[1:50:23] uh
[1:50:24] written on the lamb's book of life
[1:50:26] and we started shouting and we started
[1:50:29] having we couldn't even stay in the car
[1:50:31] it wasn't big enough for us we pulled
[1:50:33] that little volkswagen beetle on the
[1:50:36] side of the road and parked it and we
[1:50:38] ran around that car for about 30 minutes
[1:50:40] shouting and praising god i'm surprised
[1:50:42] someone didn't think that i was trying
[1:50:44] to kill him or he's trying to kill me
[1:50:46] because
[1:50:48] he'd pass me up and then i'd get to run
[1:50:51] round and around we went shouting the
[1:50:53] glory of god
[1:50:55] and we're still shouting
[1:50:58] the yes sir the glory of god and so i
[1:51:02] went to that church that night and
[1:51:05] and i finally heard when the prophet of
[1:51:08] god
[1:51:09] preached a little sermon
[1:51:11] and in that sermon he said that the
[1:51:14] bride
[1:51:15] wouldn't go through the tribulation
[1:51:18] so we're in a transitional period so i
[1:51:21] go to that uh that church that where uh
[1:51:24] me and brother ron used to kumbaya
[1:51:27] together
[1:51:30] and uh
[1:51:31] and uh you know and we we'd sing those
[1:51:34] songs you know i
[1:51:36] i got to love that baffles buddha
[1:51:39] down in my heart you know and
[1:51:41] and
[1:51:42] we love the lord
[1:51:44] it's one thing i always knew about ron
[1:51:46] is he loved the lord you know he loved
[1:51:48] the lord he loved the same lord that i
[1:51:49] did and
[1:51:51] um so we're sitting in that meeting and
[1:51:54] this
[1:51:55] guy started preaching the bride's gonna
[1:51:57] go into the tribulation so
[1:51:59] we gotta get ready we're going into the
[1:52:01] tribulation we're going in the
[1:52:03] tribulation and
[1:52:06] you know in the gentleman that i was at
[1:52:08] that time i couldn't take it no more so
[1:52:10] i i stood up and said
[1:52:13] god sent a prophet and he said we
[1:52:15] weren't going through the tribulation
[1:52:16] you know
[1:52:18] and remember ron they went crazy and he
[1:52:21] said william brown and you said
[1:52:23] thus saith the lord you're a false
[1:52:25] prophet
[1:52:30] that was true
[1:52:32] they blew up man
[1:52:34] and so they're blowing up all over the
[1:52:36] place they couldn't they're they're
[1:52:38] fighting they're fighting over the mic
[1:52:40] to rebuke us
[1:52:42] and everything and uh
[1:52:45] and then they said we'll take any
[1:52:46] doctrine and love another brother that
[1:52:48] was with me he said i i bring you the
[1:52:51] the doctrine of william branham and love
[1:52:53] and
[1:52:54] you know and uh
[1:52:56] ron's
[1:52:57] sitting there and
[1:52:59] this guy looks over at iran and says
[1:53:00] who's william brannon ron says i don't
[1:53:03] know but i'm going to find out
[1:53:06] now that's the difference
[1:53:08] when there's something in you
[1:53:10] you know be be true to the voice
[1:53:15] that's in you
[1:53:18] be true to that voice
[1:53:20] that's why the battle's in the mind
[1:53:23] because the voice comes to the inside do
[1:53:25] you hear what our brother said today he
[1:53:26] said there's so many voices out there
[1:53:29] that are trying to take you astray
[1:53:32] there's so many voices that are trying
[1:53:34] to keep you from the one
[1:53:37] true void
[1:53:39] and the biggest lie that satan tells us
[1:53:42] is that this voice of the message will
[1:53:45] not get us through this hour
[1:53:49] but faith in this voice will supply
[1:53:52] every need that you ever had
[1:53:55] you'll never see the righteous big bread
[1:54:01] you'll you'll never have to compare
[1:54:03] yourself
[1:54:04] to the world or the things of the world
[1:54:08] because you've got to remember you are
[1:54:11] not
[1:54:12] of
[1:54:13] this
[1:54:14] world
[1:54:16] you're in this world
[1:54:18] so when i
[1:54:20] finally met brother ron i meant another
[1:54:22] alien
[1:54:24] and it was fine beautiful to find
[1:54:27] somebody in life that was just as crazy
[1:54:29] as i was
[1:54:31] that loved the lord right
[1:54:34] and
[1:54:35] by by following this voice and listen
[1:54:37] this voice though our path
[1:54:40] go different things god had different
[1:54:41] ministries for us different places for
[1:54:44] us to go
[1:54:45] but there has been one governing factor
[1:54:49] through it all
[1:54:50] and that's thus saith the lord
[1:54:54] and
[1:54:55] and i just shared with my church this
[1:54:58] last wednesday this
[1:55:00] church
[1:55:02] bride all of us
[1:55:04] even though we're from different places
[1:55:06] around this country and
[1:55:09] sit under different ministries and
[1:55:10] different places we are
[1:55:13] not going to go any farther
[1:55:16] until we all settle on an absolute
[1:55:21] until we're convinced in our heart
[1:55:23] that this word
[1:55:25] this message is the absolute
[1:55:28] is the final amen
[1:55:30] and
[1:55:31] that's what he sent
[1:55:34] and when he preached leadership
[1:55:36] he said we have to have someone to lead
[1:55:38] us into the steps
[1:55:40] that lie before us
[1:55:43] and and i believe with all my heart that
[1:55:46] that's
[1:55:48] even as he spoke today he spoke what's
[1:55:50] brought us here
[1:55:52] is a voice
[1:55:53] because we've heard a voice
[1:55:55] my sheep hear my voice
[1:55:58] and another they won't follow
[1:56:00] and he said i'll not forsake you but
[1:56:03] i'll be with you even in you till the
[1:56:05] end and i'll lead you
[1:56:08] and guide you into all truth
[1:56:11] and righteousness
[1:56:12] and
[1:56:13] you know
[1:56:14] we will never
[1:56:16] go forward if we come to the
[1:56:20] place that the message
[1:56:22] has been
[1:56:25] it has been preached it has been spoken
[1:56:30] it has been recorded it has been printed
[1:56:34] this is not a has-been message
[1:56:39] it happened it hasn't even all been
[1:56:42] unfolded
[1:56:46] it's true
[1:56:48] there's there's
[1:56:49] there's
[1:56:51] food
[1:56:52] there for us
[1:56:54] and it's still vindicated
[1:56:57] and it's still true
[1:56:59] and when we all come together with that
[1:57:02] with one heart whether you're in phoenix
[1:57:04] and lose the end no matter where you
[1:57:06] are from
[1:57:07] but if we would feed together in peace
[1:57:10] together
[1:57:11] if we would incline our ear to his voice
[1:57:15] my sheep hear my voice
[1:57:17] then i believe we'll rise up
[1:57:20] in the unity and the loved one for
[1:57:22] another in the power of the resurrection
[1:57:25] that's been granted
[1:57:26] to us and we will write a book of acts
[1:57:30] after this church and i believe we're
[1:57:32] starting to write it now
[1:57:34] i believe that we're separating
[1:57:36] ourselves from the world
[1:57:38] we're dedicating our hearts to this
[1:57:40] gospel
[1:57:41] and we're trusting above all things
[1:57:44] that jesus christ is the same
[1:57:47] yesterday today and forever
[1:57:50] so we we know that brother ron has the
[1:57:53] word of the lord for us tonight
[1:57:56] so i'm sure we'll all be back
[1:58:00] but do you love him this morning
[1:58:03] amen i'm so glad for
[1:58:06] the experiences and the love and the
[1:58:08] friendship i'm have
[1:58:10] in the past but i'm looking forward for
[1:58:12] what god's got for us
[1:58:14] amen don't you don't you baby's got
[1:58:16] something for you amen he chose you
[1:58:21] to manifest himself
[1:58:23] to the world
[1:58:25] be the salt of the earth will you god
[1:58:27] bless you let's stand this morning
[1:58:30] we'll ask brother billy to come and lead
[1:58:33] us in a few songs of
[1:58:35] worship before dismissal close our
[1:58:37] service in prayer service at five
[1:58:40] o'clock tonight god bless you
[1:58:42] we'll go pray for ron and get some
[1:58:44] strength in them and
[1:58:46] and
[1:58:47] i think the only reason he went ahead
[1:58:49] and preached because he knew i wouldn't
[1:58:50] let him say no
[1:58:53] i would have stood behind him and held
[1:58:54] them up
[1:58:56] but i enjoyed the word this morning
[1:58:58] thank you lord
