ask you to bless us in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you let's uh open our bibles and to the gospel of the acts the book of acts the fourth uh chapter of the book of acts and uh we'll read this and i'll read the question that we're gonna answer and uh it's a good question uh and uh uh so just listen to the question don't read anything into it just listen to it it's a good question if if malakai is so great and holy why don't we baptize in his name amen father we ask you to bless this question to us as we answer it now in in jesus name we pray so let's go to uh this scripture in acts that we're going to read in in acts 12. now why was uh you know malachi is so great and holy well first of all you've got to understand who malachi was the whole message is malachi is god he's emorphy he just changed from an invisible to something visible so he could have fellowship it's that simple it's the same person it's not a different person god became a person melchio melchizedek and it says in this message it's in that form that he dwelt so he stayed in the form of malchezadat he meant abraham and then and we'll we'll preach that after we answer this question but why don't we baptize in the name of melchizedek well melchizedek turned into jesus okay but here's why we don't if the word told us to baptize in the name of melchizedek everybody in that water i'd baptize them in the name of melchizedek you you know what i'm saying but here's why we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ so in the in uh uh so it's it's a great uh story here in the scriptures and uh uh we're we know that the disciples and everything were preaching the gospel and they've been put in jail they've went all these things and now we'll start in the in the fifth verse and it says and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes and i anonymized the high priest and caput and and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this well they just made the poor man walk you know and a few little terrible things like that you know what i mean he needed a blind eye and people were put out in their shadows and gets well isn't it amazing that that if people don't believe or like what you do they don't even want to see any blessings go off on anybody else you know uh but anyway so he's saying by what name by what authority or what power name have you done this and peter lifted filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel so he's not angry at him for asking the question you know what i mean it's a great opportunity and so he says yeah he says in elijah if we this day be examined of the good deed done to this impotent man by what means he is made whole but it be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him that this man stand here before you whole it is the stone which was set at not of you builders which has become the head of the corner for neither there is salvation in any other and there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved god bless you you may be seated and and yeah if i would have had the opportunity to have this question earlier i would have looked up more scriptures but also he says all things that you do do in the name of the lord and so it it's it's beautiful in in the in in the context that that melchizedek's not a separate person from god melchizedek is god amorphy or god changing in to a person and a form so he can be brought out contact and fellowship okay but so that that is who that he is so if it's not the question that if if malak the mel keys deck is so great and holy well he was only great and holy because he was god now however great and holy you want to make god that's up to you but that's what he was and and i didn't say that the prophet of god simply said malachi is god he's gaudy more faith he changed his state and uh so uh if it in that it's it's about that simple uh uh uh is a few other places that he makes this statement so let me just read a couple of those statements again to so we can understand this it okay says and this is uh from who is this mal kisada and he says now the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning so he's talking what's the difference between malach malki's attack in you right so he says he was at the beginning and another statement he says is why that jesus knew all things is because he was at the beginning and so he says now that's a difference between him and you as a son he and that also means daughters he he was at the beginning the word amorphy body he came and and lived in that in the person of malchezadec then later we never heard no more of maltese adapt because he became jesus christ okay so that's that's what uh he is so it's it's not there wasn't a difference between malchezadec and jesus except for the body the life was the same life but they had different purposes and different manifestation and so and then he says uh and he then another place we could read just to kind of say the same thing he says now the true revelation of malchezadec comes into view what he was god the word so if we just broke the thing it says if matt if melchizedek is so great and holy so what makes him so great and holy is simply the fact that he's god now other people might refer to him as other things but all it was was the transformation of god becoming a person and when he showed up till now to visit abraham abraham recognized him as like a high priest well there wasn't even the high priest yet i mean levi hadn't even been born and that's a whole nother bible as a study in itself but yet uh so that that's what he was so the reason that god is categorizing these and i'm trying to find a segue into what i want to say in identifying all these different offices so we can see the condensing of god god changing his veil but he talks in this message changing his tent so first of all he comes and he's a person and then he creates adam and we know the fall so we can have his attributes then he comes to abraham and gives abraham the promise of redemption and and and we are children of abraham because we're the children of faith in revelation and so paul taught that it wasn't the natural seed of abraham what made what made abraham uh have favor with god and be a friend of god was he believed that god was able to perform that which he promised so it wasn't the natural seed of abraham that brought salvation it was the faith seed of abraham so if abraham would have rejected it which i don't believe he could have but if we can talk about uh i forget what they they call those hypotheticals right which don't really amount to nothing i i just believe we'd have a different name than abraham because god was going to carry forth his plan but he knew abraham he knew what he was he knew what was in him and so he he brought that to uh to pass and so we don't baptize in we don't baptize in the name of melchizedek we don't baptize in in the name of brother branham because the lord put salvation in the name of jesus so it it was the name of something also in com encompasses all the attributes and all uh the nature of something it it's in his name you come in somebody's name you're coming with his authority so when if i if billy came in my name and he said brother david is asking you to do such and such or maybe one of the deacons would go out there and say brother david asked me to have you move your car or or something like that well if they come in my name what they're coming is it is in my office as a pastor in in the authority that's been given and so when you come in somebody's name you if you come in in with the power and authority that is delegated and with the power that he has we talk about the policeman right he throws up his hand to say stop and and a a car well 500 horsepower comes screeching to a halt well don't think that he did that by the power of raising his hand he did it because he came in the name of the city in the authority of the city to arrest you and and impound your car and to make you pay for an unwise act and so that's where his power and authority well jesus said all power and authority has been given to me i have the power to take my life to lay down my life and take it up again so we see that that that's the reason that name is that there's no other name under heaven where by a man could be saved outside the name of the lord jesus christ well that means outside the name and be of power and his authority nobody else can grant eternal life but him now remember jesus just isn't the man though he was that man that was born in nazareth but what the life that was in him was the word so he was the word remember so before he was jesus he was the word and when he appeared to abraham he had a a body but it wasn't a body that came by sin okay like our bodies did so he didn't appear to abraham and if i use this terminology and i don't like to use it but he didn't he didn't come by a sexual body by the in in embedding through marriage that produces this body that that that whole act was a result of unbelief it's and that's where it is and god made it a holy act by placing the uh matrimony and and the coming together and being married and therefore it's just not a wild act that goes on between anybody who wants to but it becomes a sacred thing by which god has them multiply and replenish the earth and so when we see that he showed up in that great uh body that he was in in abraham then then uh we get the uh a beautiful picture and so if we would go over to paragraph uh 111 and it says who is this melchizedek but god so if if you look at melchizedek as anything other than god and then you look at jesus just as the flesh man it wasn't just think of what god did jesus was the lamb of god he actually created a body he did in the womb of mary so that life would take the same journey that every one of us took the molecules the cells the the miracle of life he was born the same way we were born he was born in a major through birth pains through everything else he came in the world world he was wrapped in swaddling clothes nobody knew who he was nobody would believe at all that this was the son of god that this was a virgin that conceived but who was it it was melchizedek god the word becoming flesh and then he said oh lord if it's possible let this cup go from me and then he says but it's for this cause that i have come into the world he sent his son to pay the price for our sins and our unbelief that all the chastisement of our sins was upon him all the correction all the punishment that should be due us and everything he took it all and paid it all can there's no other sacrifice for sin you can go out here and kill bunnies and burn whatever you want to burn there's only one place that god meets the believer that's under the shed blood of the lord jesus christ there's only one thing that cleanses you from unrighteousness it's the blood of the lord jesus christ that's what does it that's what made the atonement and made and brought us to peace with god don't try to ever go before the throne of god amen with your own merits you know we don't bring anything but to the throne but jesus said his blood has given me the path to come before your throne and make my request known and how many types is there the type of esther and and how it was death to go before the king and but he went there and made great intercession and and so many things that we'd be daresome to uh even try to go before the lord on our with our own righteousness i think the story of daniel curry i believe it is who had the dream and and he can he got closer and closer to the light and he said the closer he got he said every little sin he did got bigger and bigger and bigger and pretty soon he was he was sitting there and he said all of a sudden every little lie he told every little scheme and deal he made everything that he he withheld you know every place he didn't have full disclosure you know every little thing like that just got brighter and bigger and bigger and when he finally stepped into that presence he said i'm lost he said i was only waiting for one thing you know but he started up there i'm daniel curry i've done this and i've done that and i've preached here and and boy he said he said every step he took the light got brighter and then he realized he was in trouble and he got there and there he was he was in trouble and all the gracious things he done he said the only thing that was on his heart and his mind was everything that he never done right and he was just waiting for the voice to say condemned you know in the chute to be pulled out from under his feet and him here screaming and says yeah and here's everybody the way he and he said all of a sudden he heard the sweetest voice he ever heard father he stood for me i'm here to stand for him i i paid the price for him enter into my rest and and so those were the the great things so so who is this melchizedek but god now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in journey so why are we seeing the secrets of our life in journey in this revelation of melchizedek because it it is god in stages can we read that statement earlier god in this stage in this form so he was when he came to uh abraham that was god in a stage of his plan okay he had a plan he had everything was gonna bomb everything was pre-planned we'll read that and so he he's in that stage and then from that stage he came to the stage of the lord jesus in that stage and so let's just do you have that yes this paragraph uh 112. he says now we see here plainly the complete secret of lies and journey and death and where we go after we die also predestination is in plain view here now listen as we teach this closely the stages of the eternal purpose the stages of his eternal purpose he had in his secret has now been revealed the stages of his eternal purpose has now been revealed notice there is three stages to perfection just like he redeems the world same way he redeems his church he redeems the people in three stages now look first is justification like luther preached second sanctification like wesley beast third baptism of the holy ghost that's right it comes then comes the rapture but now he's going to go on and i'm not going to go into all the reading of this but there was three stages to god's perfection and three stages of his eternal purpose and the first one was to abraham the purpose of redemption so he gave abraham the promise of the son so he appeared to abraham he took on a form so cable kim could look at that form look at that person and that's why we talked answered the question about the census so they looked at that and abraham saw a man there that knew all things knew why sarah laughed in the tent knew all this thing gave him a promise and all the hopes and he was in a form not a form like we come not a body that got old got sick died got wrinkled lost his hair can't eat steak anymore he's not he's not paying that he's not in that uh that's not the form he's in because why would abraham have to look forward to that abraham already couldn't have children he was already a hundred years old or 80 and sarah and he gets a promise of a son now abraham by seeing that man and seeing that work and that sign believe that what that man promised was going to come to pass that this guy is able to perform that who he promised he recognized him by divine revelation that that was lord my lord that's what he saw and he received the word and he believed it that was god in the form of melchizedek we don't see god in that body form okay that first stage was the great eternal one okay the second stage was he became flesh so there was malchezadec again another word for melchizedek is the word in the beginning melchizedek it's just that the reason the question was there is because paul spoke of melchizedek and people wondered who was this melchizedek and they said oh it's the order of the ministry it's the order the order of melchizedek means the order of the priests before was they had to be born of a levite that was the order you didn't become a high priest unless you were born in the order or the fashion of the priesthood but this priesthood was born of the word of god he was the high priest he was the king of peace the king of salem the king of righteousness he was a high priest after the order of melchizedek and what order was melchizedek melchizedek came from the thoughts of god from the word of god from the mind of god he was the word of god he was god so what made melchizedek what he was was god expressing himself so our order of priesthood that's what we are we are priests sons and daughters and priests after the order of melchizedek because we came from the mind of god that's the order of melchizedek melchizedek wasn't made from anything he was god imorphy he was god changing forms god becoming a person now we know he took that form because when a when moses wanted to see him he passed by and he saw the back of a what a man that was god formed into a person when the prophet of god saw him he saw him he walked by he saw the back of a man and so queen know that it was god but it was god's stage you understand the stage the and not like a not like a platform stage but the the three manifestations the three processes the the three great uh you know what we call a staging area is you stop here and then you do that and then you move to the next thing so it was the first manifestation of the eternal purpose the first manifestation of the eternal purpose was god taking on form and talking to abraham because he had to start the plan of redemption the second stage of the eternal purpose so in melchizedek he gave the promise and anything that god speaks has to come to pass so the minute he spoke it to abraham it was on his way coming to pass first stage you know it's like in a trial the first stage is you've got to make a plea you know you say they can't try you until you admit whether you're guilty or not if you say you're guilty then that's obviously you're not going to be able to to prove that you're not guilty if you confess that you're guilty you know so i can't tell you all the stuff that goes behind the scenes you know a good attorney says it's gonna cost the county 150 thousand dollars to try this guy well will he accept five years instead of 20 you know save us some money and we get a conviction you know so the justice the cis system isn't as just as you think it is you know it's so corrupt that people that could prove their innocence would rather take a lesser consequences than take the chance and it's maybe sometimes it's the better valor and the wisdom of that now you've got this second stage because he left melchizedek and now he became jesus so he left a spiritual body and worked him way to flesh now he's in the form of flesh but not sinful flesh not flesh that was born by the act between a man and a woman so therefore there was still no sin in him right so now that's the second step and what's he do he pays the redemption price he wipes our slate clean and now he says if you believe in me the works that i do shall you do also so can now and he's saying if you go wait in and and carry i will fill you i will come again and i'll be with you even in you so that was the second stage the third stage was him appearing in the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 and revelations 10 7. that was the last stage of his eternal purpose was to manifest right there he says notice there's still three stages of perfection so that was that was the three stages of perfection now and we're gonna jump ahead i don't know if you've got this but go to paragraph 142. so now he he he we're talking about this third stage of perfection you are you all with me okay i got a little nervous this morning because it was father's day and you know the deeper it got the more people are falling asleep and and you know and i get such a uh insecurity complex anyway you know what i mean but it ca anyway so you you you see what he promised the works that i shall you shall do also ask anything in my father's name now watch this statement here okay now the bible said that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever right jesus said the works that i do shall he that believeth on me do also that's right notice that was the real melchizedek now how beautiful is that okay i mean it can it get any more uh beautiful and that that's the real malkiesa deck now this is the final stage of my perfection this is the final stage of my purpose god above us giving the promise god with us fulfilling the promise god putting him that fulfilled promise in his predestinated election now don't ever let satan beat you down if if you've been battling something and trying to overcome i don't care if it's years it he showed in abraham that it took years and years for that promise to be fulfilled but he still built cribs he still can added on a nursery at his house they thought that man was a loon i've been up on the lakes of canada and you hear the looney birds you know squawking all night long you wonder what's wrong with those crazy birds call them loons looney birds what do you think they thought of abraham i'm gonna have a son why by promise you know what we what we should be saying i'm going in a rapture why by promise the same one that told abraham that he was going to have a son and that son showed up the same one that said i'm coming again that you may be where i am also that's the same one and that's here's peter the same one you guys crucified the cornerstone that you rejected is the one that did this work it's by his name that this has happened it's the one that was there that you saw preaching and going around and doing good works and telling them about a kingdom that was to come you rejected that but that is now the cornerstone of what the church is built on gets the church restored back because it went into the ground right he sends the ministry melchizedek himself coming back to restore the what the faith and the revelation to the children so they would have the faith to take a rapture hallelujah canary elsie the third stage the three comings of melchizedek to abraham in jesus to the world and now in the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 veiled in a prophet to call out the elect for the rapture the great three stages and again why we baptize in the stage because we baptized in the stage of our redemption so we you know so i want to go just for a couple moments here um to the message things that are to be and brother branham reads this text out of john 1 and 4 we we read some of that text so let's just turn in our bibles real quick over to john hmm okay john 14 and 1. now i read i believe from the seventh first down brother bram is here is reading through the seventh verse let not your hearts be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go to prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also whither i go ye know and the way you know thomas said unto him lord know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if ye had known me ye would have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him oh my what an explanation so melchizedek brother branham just took the time to explain that malkizadak was the form that god took to deliver to abraham his redemptive eternal purpose jesus came to fill that purpose and the malachi came in this age to restore back that purpose to us now he said okay and so brother brown makes the statement here we are tonight trying to put forth our effort to try to cause men to see the great things that god has done and you know there's something greater just beyond many would look tonight and look tonight father as we turn in your word and read we can read it father but let the holy spirit reveal to us through the revelation we ask it in jesus name so he he reads this text and he goes over here and he says now saying this was a funeral text you see you know many people said he said when you see my life ending now jesus speaking when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose i'm going away to prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also jesus therefore is telling his disciples that this life is not ended in death okay so a lot of people would think it's a funeral text but now he is telling them that after death there is life because i go to prepare a place for you that is to receive them shows that there that he was speaking to them that there was a life after this life has ended now what a consolation that ought to give to all of us to know that after this life is over there is a life we go into and as you get older and become more of a reality to you as you begin to see the days of your life drawing close then it begins to to you to be to to pack up closer and get ready for that a great event it's now it's a continuation of the same life in another world place a change so what why did he come back in his eternal purpose was to make real to us the reality of the change and what we needed to do to get ready for it it's a beautiful thing if we know the word of god we know where we're living we know the hour that we're living in and we know what lays ahead we see what we've passed and the book of god is the revelation of jesus christ his works through the ages that was up to the book of revelation and then he promised that it is to come so all of his promises are true god cannot speak any word without it being confirmed every word that he says has to come to pass before the foundation of the world oh my goodness when i begin to think of it so how did god always deliver his word his word came through a what through a prophet he say well what about jesus jesus was on this earth in the ministry of a prophet i will raise up a prophet unto you liken unto moses that's what he was he was called rabbi young prophet came in he ministered oh son of man that meant profit so jesus didn't come down and and manifest himself as the son of god he did tell one lady though which represented a redeemed bride you're speaking to him you know thou art the son of god she said philip thou art the son of god when he was revealed in that form they recognized that that was god he says now so we we understand now so now here's the messenger telling us of the things that are to be so the messenger shows up the eternal purpose and he calls out the bride that's supposed to go into the rapture now he's telling her things that are to be what's transpo transpiring what god's doing how the first stage has come how the second stage come and is telling them you're in the third stage in other words you're close it's launch time ten nine you know they roll that big missile out and they get there and and it's all ready to go and and now comes the countdown did he tell us we're at the countdown it's harvest time you know it's the third exodus so what is this great ministry uh telling us he's here doing the same signs and wonders but he's also telling us things that are to be because he told abraham things that are to be that he was going to have a son and abraham believed him and it was counted to him for righteousness that what god promised is going to come to pass let me ask you do you believe there's a rapture do you believe what god says coming to pass that's what's counted to you for your righteousness because you believe what god spoke through his prophets is going to come to pass hallelujah we get hung up on our own righteousness as long as you've got this flash you're going to war against the spirit they're contrary to the one that's that first husband that's that that thing that's got to die is all the nagging torture that comes from a fleshly body borne in sin sorry about that person but anyway it's just it's a tough thing so now god everything god promises god to come to pass so now here's melchizedek back again the word coming to the prophet doing the signs that identified him first sign that identified and what he called sarah out behind the back right the second sign that identified him the dead were raised the blind received their sight the death heard and now he comes back and identifies himself again every time he gave a promise first exodus second exodus third exodus three stages three stages of mel piece of that i will come again and receive you that where i am you may also be and then he says this is melchizedek the works that i do you shall do also okay i wonder when our faith is going to come to the place that we believe the promises of god we believe that there's no nothing in this life that we have to preserve that the life that is there waiting for us is just a continuation of this life but corruption won't inherit the kingdom of god only in corruption that's why he's telling you you've got a body that'll carry you over into the other life don't worry about this body because he's going to give you one that's been prepared for you to carry you over oh it gets me feeling better i don't care i might come up here if a crane on a cane if you let me but when i start preaching like this i'm going to click my heel he says he said now over in the book of hebrews i believe about the seventh chapter paul here is writing i believe it was and was speaking on the great events that taken place with abraham and he paid tithes to melchizedek when he was returning from the slaughter of the kings that's things that are to be paragraph 30. when he was returning from the slaughter of the kings now he said that levi was in the loins of abraham when he meant melchizedek coming from the slaughter of the kings and then he reckoned to it levi paid tithes also when he was in the loins of abraham in his great great grandfather and he visits the sins of the people upon their children from generation to generation that won't keep his word you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight did you know that my he said over here in paragraph 36 it says you see the whole program the whole church is built upon divine revelation jesus said in saint matthew the 16th chapter flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed to you what was it a revelation of who he was upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it the revelation of jesus christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was now the bible expresses it's growing into the bride to a full statue therefore if the corn of wheat christ had not fallen in the ground so did the bride have to fall in the ground through the dark ages any grain that goes into the ground must die or it can't produce itself reproduce itself and the great church that was established on the day of pentecost by the sending of the holy ghost had to suffer mortardom and go into the dirt unto the earth in the dark ages to bring forth the age of luther and coming on out to the full stature of the bride of jesus christ in this last day there's no way there's no other way so we see it why do you think you're here why did you respond to the eagle cry what was it that let all of us from different walks of life different cultures different economic and educational backgrounds can everything come together as a people with no big eyes no little use nobody ragging on one another or talking about one another realizing we all have equal chance there's no disparity in christ because i believe where there's any there's plenty i'm not going to let any of you if i have the ability to go hungry if i know it i just won't do it i'll respond if i know i don't know all things but if the lord put it on my heart or something but if someone come and told me brother says sister and such don't have groceries well i'm not gonna let that happen now if i got ten dollars i'll buy ten dollars worth of groceries because we're family we're the children birthed by the word of god that's why we pray and we pray one for another that's why if one of us suffers we all suffer together it's it's the great thing in into the full statute so the corner wheat goes ground he sends the holy ghost had to suffer and go through the dirt of the earth in the dark ages to bring forth again luther and out into the full statue of the bride of christ for the last day there's no way therefore the bride in the rapture will come forth and it is all pre-planned by god all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who would set all about it it's all pre-planned god knew it would be here and he and he and he made it that way so that when we get there he's going to prepare a place for us and when we get there it's all prepared just like even this night is prepared this hour's prepared his great foreknowledge tells him all those things by foreknowledge he's omnipresent because he's omnipotent omnipotent because he's omnipresent therefore by his foreign knowledge now he can't be just like the wind over the earth because he's a being right he's just isn't a myth he's a being he dwells he even dwells in a house he dwells in a place called heaven and therefore he's omnipotent all present omnipotent knowing all things then he's omnipresent because he knows all things you now grew from your birth when you were born present into this world god knew that you were going to be here on this earth and you'd grow from birth to maturity things that seemed to too strange to you in your youth womanhood young boys as children now seem very real you couldn't understand it when you was a child but now you become an adult you begin to understand and find out that everything is just set just right and you it really means something to you now so it is in your spiritual birth you do things that you don't understand when you're a little babe come to the altar you give your life to christ you do such strange things you wonder why you why you did it but after a while when you mature as a mature christian then you understand it see there's something picking up you see why you had to do it your spiritual birth your natural birth types your spiritual birth how it fitted you in this life as you grew everything fitted right in because you were made for that wasn't it strange thing the night that you staggered into the mission the tent or the little church somewhere on the corner and some preacher preached on a certain subject and you just fell right at the altar isn't that strange see god knew that before the foundation of the world it seems strange to you why you did it then but now you understand you know what happened so you didn't understand it when you were brought under conviction but now you've grown up you mature you're not talking about going from sin to from drinking to not drinking now you're talking about going to being a real true son of god you're talking about not not just living a right life but a transformation of your body into another kingdom because we see the fulfillment of the word and we realize the hours at hand look at what your conversation is look at what you matured when as a child i did childless things i spoke of a child but now that i'm strong and i'm adult i speak of adult spiritual things so it's time that the church starts talking speaking and thinking in the supernatural because the greatest supernatural event that's ever going to happen is right at our doorstep the transformation of your body into your theophany body to go meet him in the air you didn't understand you knew what happened it's so fitting this life and we'll also in the life that that is to come this world and its life seems too advanced as you mature everything seems to go right with you so as you grow everything grows i see my grandson running around with his mommy's cell phone well i don't know if he knows how to use it but my granddaughters do because they've got as they grew things went along with them you didn't know how to drive as you grew you started driving everything came with you as you matured up everything's been coming with you all the time all these promises have been coming with you i don't believe that a person just happened to be here by chance now just think when you come to the world everything had to be for for prepared for you or prepared for you rather for you i don't hardly understand how that we could think that a god could prepare all those good things for us would not and we could not put trust in him that if he brought us in this chaos that we're in now and prepared the good things of life for us here how much more we trust him to prepare the things that is to come see the eternal things it seems very strange to me and and i'm just going to if i could say just stop there because this message isn't just about looking back on the ministry of brother branham and seeing what it was okay it's seeing what he was doing he was preparing a people for a rapture and he was telling them the timetable of it what you needed to get to what level of faith you would have to have because the rapturing with faith was revealed in the opening of the seals we talk a lot about taking our position in christ and and coming to the things so many times we always relate that to works but accepting your position is accepting the promise that he gave to you i will come again i'll be with you i will not leave you i prepared everything the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord the time of your conversions ordered by the lord i mean i mean my kids got saved now that's a big miracle you know a lot of people come to me and said you need to quit preaching your kids are not doing this and not doing that though wait a minute that's not the promise i got he said to me if i preach the gospel that my house would be saved if i applied the token my house would be saved i i didn't hear that thing i heard the promise and if you hear the promise and you believe the promise you look for it and the last things john says it says even so come quickly lord jesus he says look up your redemption draws nigh so there is such a transformation that is now taking place in the church and we're driven there you understand by the shock pulling away and rejecting you and this rejection is going to get worse they're going to reject your stand on morality they're going to reject your stand on education they're they're going to make that their teaching should smile things in school that you can hardly uh uh feel like you can send your children there it's going to get ugly because they rejected anything that has to do with god they're trying to create a godless world and the prophet of god promised us that in the last day this world would go into total apostasy that means you're going to try to live life outside the laws of god i mean it's not even logical defund the police okay i'm a criminal that's like the millennium for me they don't let you they don't let you they don't arrest you they don't put you in jail no bail well i'm a liar i'm a thief i'm having the time my life i just go tell the judge promise him oh i'll come okay i trust you the judge is up there where's my wallet i didn't even see that pickpocket well don't arrest them why do you think crime's so crazy why do you think the murder rate's just gone up all of a sudden it becomes completely uh worthless but remember there is a consequence for not accepting the gospel there is a consequence even if you're a teenager and all you view this thing here is mommy and daddy's religion and this is where we go to church and we're just like any other teenager that's in any other church you still know right and wrong and and if you make the wrong decisions you will reap what you sow i'm not talking about salvation and all that i mean i'd hate to have to be run over by five trucks to get across the street and crawl up on the other side all wounded and run over tire tracks all over me said i made it and then i started singing the song made it you know just two buses and three semis later when god provided a crosswalk he provided a spirit to lead you across to the other side oh you will get there you know but he told paul it's hard to kick against the prick ball you've taken a tough way to try to eliminate my influence on this earth in fact basically you think who you are okay i'll smite you blind i'll send a prophet to pray for you i'll put you on the desert for 12 years or so until you really figure out what's going on here then paul comes back i'm the chiefest of all sinners but let me tell you he's real and not only that i'm going to go to the gentiles and i'm going to tell him the deep riches of christ shows up on mars hill he says oh i see you've got an altar to the unknown god he didn't walk up there you bunch of pagans he said oh you men you know you're very curious you greek seek after wisdom he says i noticed you great smart men you've got an altar over here to the unknown god i want to talk talk to you about this unknown god i want to reveal to you who he is and what he does and what kind of power he has what are we what are we showing to the world the light that we have what that he's what that he's placed us to be and and and and what is it that that were that were showing forth if we know the word we know where we're at we know the life that we're living so what that word testifying to is that the things that have been prophesied are actually coming to pass that's what we'd be uh able to should have eyes at for the things that are to be the things that our messenger spoke are now happening so he told us we're at the end time we're at the end time well that's just the voice you know and at the end time's coming in fact we already say that from even this virus life has changed as we've as we know it it's just changed things that we never thought were happening limit limits on activities people have changed businesses has closed down people are ordering things online people are going with houses they they say that it's going to take years for things to return back to normal i don't want normal i want to leave i want to go home okay and he's here trying to put in us the faith so we start looking for it we start believing it that this is our promise and this is what we live by we make our choices and our decisions in our life based on what is absolutely the best for me to make the resurrection i don't want i don't want well if i'm going then i can be anywhere no i think if my life's planned i want to get in that plan and if you get out of that plan what does he do he takes your life and he works it around to get you back where he wants you he takes the permissive will of god and works it back to the perfect will of god but let me tell you what he added to that you'll save yourself and god a lot of trouble and believe me your troubles greater than god's trouble so you know i i i'm just saying it's marvelous but just back to our little question good question why because god chose that name he chose that place to put his name ken brother brown preaches that and god's provided place of worship and there's several other places that he teaches us and i hope that you caught this this morning when we read out of corinthians those people have the same questions back then that we have now what kind of body how's he gonna come how's he gonna appear aren't you glad the seals are open aren't you glad that we had somebody that was a prepared created vessel did you know that the billy graham said that that messenger that he's created with just the personality just the way he speaks his words just his nature the way he brings things out the way he says it is all designed for the sheep that will hear them it's wonderful so i want to encourage you to think supernaturally don't let the devil beat you down with a body you're not going to have anyway you know if he wants the thing he can have it it's just going to turn into dust you say how come jesus didn't see corruption because he was the word before he was flesh why does your body see corruption because you were flesh before you're the word and paul addressed that why didn't the natural spiritual come first but we understand all that now don't we because of the attributes but anyway i hope you enjoy the word of god i don't know where we're going to go this message things that are beat to be is wonderful but i think the next message in our series from where we picked up i think is easter seal isn't that correct so yeah and that's a longer study than who is this melchizedek the seal of the resurrection in us oh my mom wouldn't you love to have the absolute absolute confidence that nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand that your name's written on the land book of life before the foundation war and nothing can take it off if there's not a place i would have told you i go to prepare a place you know how you have that confidence believe his word believe his word if you lack faith ask him for faith lord help my unbelief make it real to me make me understand it make me grow in you father i want it to be real i want you to be real in my life i want to have a personal relationship i want to feel that presence i want to feel you close i want to sense your holy spirit when it's leading me i want to get into relationship with you i'm tired of always fighting the flesh i want to step up a little higher i want to mature a little more and i want to start thinking supernaturally and i want to start displaying and showing the life i i had a wonderful quote about that in things that are to be but for some reason my ability to mark things has really left me but it's just such a wonderful thing about our life and the light that we're showing and what we're shining forth to this world our life is shining forth this world the soon resurrection of the church you are very very very very very very important you may be the difference in somebody's life you may be the one that finds the last seed i think i was telling the church in missouri it's like the person that they're building a puzzle you know this happens happened a lot in my family well one of them would take the puzzle piece and put it in their pocket so they could be the last one to finish the puzzle the only trouble was is we had five siblings so the puzzle would get all done and there'd be five pieces missing and everybody would get up and walk away trying to wait out who's gonna put the puzzle in first you know and you know so anyway all the pieces are coming together so you might be the piece of the puzzle in somebody's else life so let's not be ashamed of this gospel and and this was this coming of melchizedek in our day was the third stage of the eternal purpose of god so if we've got anything tonight i hope that's there so god bless you pray for us this week pray that god will do exceedingly and abundantly above what we can ask or think pray for our plan if it's possible that the lord would make a way for us in this hour that the city of bedford can build three liquor stores but it takes them two years to approve our church i guess we don't give them enough money but i think we can try to explain to them that we eat at their restaurants we buy their gas you know what i mean we bring a lot of economy to the bedford so pray for them over there that uh the lord will light a fire on them i i was to the point where i was going to pray that god struck him with lightning but i'm trying i'm trying to soften my spirit and you know agree with my adversaries quickly but uh i i i i am closing but i will testify we we had we had trouble with somebody tim i told our the civil engineer i said that guy's gone and he said what do you mean i go and say he's not going to be there next night right he's gone sure enough next month he was gone and then we had this other guy and i don't know the situation around that guy but i'd turn in an application and he'd write me a letter we don't receive this application i said what do you mean you don't receive the application we we count it as not being filed i said you can't do that i filed it i paid the money you took the money you know and and so i i wrote a letter and you know we put all the trustees and deacons names on it we sent it to the city manager and we said it to the city attorney you know what i mean and we sent it to the guy that approved our our letter and next week he was gone you know i don't know whether to go over there and tell them if you guys want to keep their job you better help get to get this church bill you know what i mean or what we'll do is we'll have our members run for city council and we'll just put people from our church on the city council you know but anyway we're praying we've done everything they've asked us to do so we're right at the very last stages as you notice we have raised 470 000 dollars in our building fund we're getting close to our goal to where how much money we had to have if we were able to make the payments at the same offering level that we are now so i i don't know we have somewhere to be between uh 280 and 340 members covets kept some of them out we haven't seen for a long time and if you notice some of those people call them let them know you're praying for them they're faithful they're still giving but there's been a lot that have been out because of it but and out of those all those people we have probably about 120 givers which you know is adults we don't expect our young children to give we can tell when a child gives because uh the dollar bills come in looking like this you know what i mean and we don't believe any adult if in his right mind would take a dollar bill look at you might be embarrassed it's a dollar bill but we're glad to have it but it cost us five dollars to unfill you know and then we gotta iron it and start shed so it looks like it's not fake currency so i'm gonna maybe get boxes instead of bags and you can just take it out and lay it in there flat or if you're embarrassed how much it is just put it in the envelope but if you don't write your name on it we have no way of giving you record for it record it for your uh your tech statement which we do supply if you need one but anyway we're getting close and it's a good thing if we can raise money praise the lord for the first time lumber has come down it dropped a thousand dollars which is huge so if we can just uh get lumber cheaper that's going to help us and if supplies start coming off so i believe everything's pre-planned you know what i mean and so i i just think we're right on the edge of doing it and it would be nice for us to have room and be able to do a few things and and i presume that in the future there'll be more weddings and we can have a nice church to have weddings in and have a nice place for afterwards for those that want it so let's pray and have nice nurseries two nurseries one for nursing mothers one for the dads that are going to look after the kids well the mothers look after the babies so we're trying to do something that's nice for us so we keep us in prayer which we're right we're right at the verge of crossing over and being able to do something and and uh we're praying for those that some people have have on their heart to come and join our fellowship and put their shoulder to the wheel and so we want to pray that god offers them but most of all i'd like to see converts amen and we had some visitors today i believe brother john or brother craig brought him from granberry to me that's marvelous and of course i know i didn't preach a message that seemed like it was for somebody that's new but you never know what word will strike that seed you know and i've i've met many a believer who came to this message by listening to serpency amen you know what i mean so i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ it doesn't have to be modified it don't have to be sugar coated if there's a deep in there and that deep calls to that deep that deep will respond so just have faith let's pray that uh our wednesday nights have been growing in attendance i think that's wonderful i trust our today's father's day i understand but i trust that our our sunday evenings will get stronger and don't forget prayer service the first tuesday of every month they're really growing in strength and the presence of god is there and you give that hour of prayer you'll see the change and the power of god in your life you believe he's the same yesterday today wherever you believe he loves you do you believe he's gone to prepare a place for you then let your deep start calling for it the last cry of the church is even so come quickly lord jesus god bless you brother billy well that's how it stands alive amen amenities and god wonderful amen oh there's never been a day like this thing to me oh there's never [Music] this [Music] this day to me oh when is been a day like this day i see oh when there's never been alive [Music] this glorious day oh and for christ

made live now lord and it shows us who we are lord it shows us how you progress through different stages in time where we're at lord and we're ready now for that next stage lord which is that rapturing the changing of our body lord that we look at the circumstance around the world and we look at the situations that are come upon us lord but we know that we have a promise or we know that

vessel to speak to that last one as brother david said those puzzle pieces or as they come together we know you're putting them into place or right where the time is at hand we love you lord and we
