Description:
Romania Mission Report
Sunday Evening Service: October 31, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[Applause] [Music] father we love you we love the fellowship that we have in your word [Music] father we appreciate the revelation of the guide that is to bring us through this dark perilous hour father we've come to fellowship tonight and we just ask that you bless our evening may it be a wonderful time may our hearts be lifted we ask these things in jesus name we pray amen man god bless you may be seated we're been at uh have a little special evening to night and i'm glad that you've come out and we're going to have a report on the missionary trip or the trip to romania we refer to them as missionaries there are believers there but about our effort here as our congregation trying to help the brothers and sisters in romania spread the gospel and so matthew and cosman are going to share with us their trip and then because you all came out tonight you'll get a sample of some romanian food and we call it a snap sample there's some egg not egg rolls cabbage rolls a wrong country we're not sponsoring any egg roll people at this time but cabbage rolls some romanian meatballs and some soup and bread and that'll be served to you right here in the back after service so i think that's a little extra thing you know sometimes we talk about the spiritual food and the spiritual food types the natural food but once you taste this food everybody's gonna want to be a missionary to romania so uh i i was a little weary this morning but i was in invited over for a fantastic dinner this afternoon and that just refreshed me and and after eating two and a half pounds of brisket i i feel really good so we're grateful for that but one thing that we'd probably recommend is if you're kind of farther back when we make the switch in the service maybe you might want to come up and fill in some of these empty spots and so you might want to be able to see better so that's just a recommendation that if you want to see it just kind of move up closer you know that is our commission is to go into all the world and preach the gospel and you never know when the word of god is going to move and touch somebody's heart you noticed in the tape today the prophet of god talked about the them refusing to go over into the promised land but he made a statement he said but lord they had the opportunity and you can never force people to choose the only thing you can do is present to them the opportunity and one day it may be their last opportunity but we don't know that so we continue to present the opportunity to as many people as we can to hear the word of god and to support anybody that goes out and of course cosmin being able to speak romanian it made us a great asset and it also gives us a wonderful opportunity to go to that country and and have some real fruit so uh i'm going to invite uh cosmic matthew this time so if you'd like to move up a little closer you just do that if you're so comfortable in your seat okay maybe when you start seeing it you'll want to move up closer but don't be ashamed to move up closer and and be able to see it so uh then after right after the the presentation this evening uh we'll come up and bless the food and then we'd like to let all the adults go first so we kind of keep the children this might not be exactly the kind of food the children think so natalie you can go first since it's your birthday amen natalie why don't you stand up so we can i'll tell you uh you know she is a little miracle so it's it's so wonderful and she's just been such a little shining light and and everything i really appreciate her and it just tells you what god can do i don't think she was any bigger in this tissue box was she she probably this could have been your bed all we had to do is cut the top of this out and we could have put you on those soft uh soft kleenex in there and you'd have been comfortable but god's mercy and grace shied down upon us and we want to keep a brother mike and sister liz in prayer because now she's a teenager and uh teenagers uh are a little wiser at that age and they uh they have so much to offer that we've just got to learn to accept their advice as we as we go through life so we're we're grateful for that and it's it's kind of sad in one way for me because this would have been her last year in our sunday school now she's moving up to our young peoples but yet we haven't been able to have sunday school and things so we don't have anybody now that helps us with sunday school so we need to pray that somebody can puts that burden on their heart to help with our young people and our sunday school and and especially our kids from four to twelve and maybe by the grace of god by this time next year we'll be pretty much into our facility so we just trust god for everything so let's just have a wonderful evening and uh if if is there any way if that somebody has a question that they could raise their hand and you could handle it sure sure if you have a question about something and uh and you just just raise your hand you know what i mean and it'll be good but anyway so god bless you tonight enjoy this time of fellowship in the service and i would tell you where our romanian food came from but i'm afraid you'd be over there every day so we just have to measure this just right so god bless you tonight god's good brother matthew husband we thank you for your trip and share with us your experience i praise the lord let's just stand we'll just have a it's always good to read the word and just to just have a little fellowship tonight uh just enjoy yourselves just relax in his presence as we just go through some of the things that god is doing we just want to read out of the book of mark and we'll just read the great commission here found in chapter 16 and verse 15 we're all familiar with it and it's very fitting for the message that we heard this morning and for the trip that we are on it reads and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these shines shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen you can go ahead and be seated i would like to read a quote out of one in a million and this is um the portion right out of the portion our pastor uh played for us um it reads like this it's brother branham is here at the end of the sermon he's praying he says oh eternal father send the gospel light across this city through this coming week of convention if there be any seed somehow by your own great wise providence like trying to illustrate in the sperm of the male and the female may they roll into the convention may the holy spirit give them light we realize that the time is perhaps later than we think it is we pray god that as we come here just believing that maybe there is something here that could be done that would help the people or catch that last sheep i believe that's our heart's desire no matter where we go whether we're sent overseas or whether we're right here in our community we're wanting to shine the gospel light that we can catch that last sheep we know when the sheepfold is full then the shepherd will close the door as it was like in the days of noah when the last member of the family was brought in god closed the door and they beat and pounded but it was too late dear god they had the opportunity you said i am the door to the sheephold and how striking the song from the poet are not 90 and nine enough for thee but no there was one more he might be a little black sheep or he might be a little nobody might be the little her or he we don't know where they are but that last one must come in and then the door will be closed oh god who knows all things search our lives this morning and send us wherever that we could go and that really just stuck out to me as god makes opportunity and the provisions to go he says and send us wherever that we could go that we might find that last one that the door would be closed and the shepherd inside with the sheep granite lord if there be that one here today if that one that is supposed to come in all the father has given me will come to me and can come except my cannot come except the father has drawn him amen you believe that so we're just thankful that we have the opportunity um kind of the way uh it transpired i had uh caused uh called brother cosman and we've just in our hearts we've uh wanted to do certain things for the believers or just facilitate a certain opportunity and i called him up and we were just uh talking about uh just praying and doing something for the lord and so when we we called him and just wanted to even look outside of the box if you will if there was something god could do overseas and as we got to talking and and cosmo went to prayer um he always had a a desire on his heart to go back to romania and so as we were in touch about that and just um started to put that before us uh brother cosman went to prayer and i'll just have brother cosman come now and and give the testimony of of how things transpired because we were um we had selected uh we we just looked at the calendar and it was like well it's only this week you know that weekend and it was on our heart to go and so we picked a weekend we bought our tickets we were going there by faith uh no one there to receive us we we knew uh cosmon grew up there somewhere we were going to go into the highways and byways and we were going to witness and testify we just wanted to do something for god and then in that in that process of us going uh the lord just opened some doors and i'd like brother cosman to come and then we'll just uh it's just gonna be a relaxed evening me and him we'll we'll do our best just to to walk together through the slides and and try to give you a picture and bring you on that journey as the lord brought us through romania so brother cosman if you'll come at this time if if they can make this mic hot that would be good for the cosmon amen god bless you um it was it was a privilege to just be able to uh just go back home and and just to see you know the believers there but just like matthew was saying the testimony and how uh things unfolded so um i would say about six to eight months ago the lord put a burden on my heart and the burden was to go in romania and uh you know spread this gospel to my own family we still have family in romania that are unbelievable i'm you know believers they're in the pentecostal church and so um when you realize the grace and what this message does to an individual all you want to do is go share the same life and not a life that you try to teach um not a life that you try to explain you know not a life that you could try to go and say hey this is how you do things this is how you do things but you just go like like paul said you go in power and demonstration and and you go and you try to shed this life this love this divine love so you know um as a lot of us have family here and our hearts you know burned for him to come to this message that was my heart and i said lord you've done it for me you put you pulled us out of the pentecostal uh church you're able to show me this grace i said what if i'm the only contact that they would ever have to this eternity and so you know that burden just become real heavy on my heart and i just went i went for prayer and that's when brother matthew had called and you know was feeling the burden himself so i said well you know let's just pray about it we're going to just walk by faith i don't know no believers in romania if i knew anybody you know my dad used to be a missionary so i was going to ask him hey can you speak to some people and get into some pentecostal churches we were going to bring the gospel one way or another it was on the corner of the street it was going to be in my family's house it was going to be in the church whatever it was going to be we were going to do it so you know what's amazing about just walking in faith and just taking the time to listen to that still my small voice is that he leads you and he guides you and sometimes we over overlook things like that you know we think that it's our own conscience you think that it's our own way of thinking but when you follow it and you believe it then it manifests it and the more you do it the more mature you become in that word so i followed that step of just you know going with that still small voice so we put it before the prayer so then one day i just called matthew and i said man i found tickets i said these are the two dates it's at this price or this price and he said well this date doesn't work good for me and so then let's do this date so i ended up buying them that night so i just i just told them i said you know let's just continue to keep it in prayer i don't really know how god's gonna manifest it i don't really know what's gonna happen um we're just gonna walk by faith and you know i had a plan and it was my natural plan it was the way that i was thinking that things were going to unfold and so you know i continued to kind of pray about it brother matthew was busy at that time traveling so you know i wasn't able to keep up and tell them some of these things but i just kept telling them i said continue to pray god's doing something supernatural so then he he wasn't at the end i ended up telling him but um so one day i was just around just looking online and so i figured i said you know if we're going to be in around this area i would like to go sit in at a message church and so um i ended up call i ended up finding this brother preaching online for a clip of about two minutes and um you know i i i try to i'm i'm a little good at research so then when i've noticed that after two hours i'm not finding his information i said well something's wrong i mean i typed his name i looked up his website to get on his website you got to put a password in so no information online i said okay lord so i was sitting on the couch and i was really like into researching and all of a sudden my wife looks and he's like honey what are you doing for three hours like you're just sitting there just said honey i'm doing something it's like i'm almost there i'm almost there so i believe after half an hour after she said that all of a sudden i found a flyer of this brother that preached a service in germany in 19 either 1999 or 2001 and he had his email he had his phone number there and i said well that's kind of old i i don't really know if that's going to work but you know i'm just going to take a picture of it and i'm going to see if i could contact that number so as this time was going forth i kept praying about it for the next two three days that really couldn't have the uh um you know the the guts to just make the phone call i was just kind of nervous so after like three days of praying and just having the comfort to just call the brother i ended up calling the brother and and this is the first i i've talked to brother gabriel so we were on the form for 45 minutes and you know when you know that someone's got the same spirit you have you don't have to me because it was the word that united us in our conversation i didn't ask him about his past i didn't ask him about what he was doing but as soon as we opened up the conversation we were talking about the lord we were talking about the prophet we were talking what the lord was doing today and the conversation just kept progressing so after 45 minutes i said you know brother gabriel i said uh me and brother matthew are planning to come to romania around this date and um so uh this is this is the dates we're coming um we're just gonna want to come sitting on a sit sit in on your one of your services he's like okay good and so um i ended up finishing the conversation with him now he at the same time as we were having that confirmation he said you know just make sure you realize that there's going to be some restrictions taking place in romania the next few months vaccine closing borders this new variant that just came out was really taken in effect at that time so i said okay we'll we'll continue to pray pray about it this was in i would say june so we kept praying about it i kept praying about it and i believe in at the beginning of august i um he ended up texting me and he said you know brother cosman are you guys still coming and i said yeah he said okay so tell me the dates again and i said okay told him the dates and he said okay well i'll tell you what um we're going to go ahead and and on those dates we're going to schedule you to come preach sunday morning over here press preach sunday evening over here we're going to have a service on wednesday we're going to have a service on thursday we're going to have a service on friday we're going to have a service of saturday saturday and we're going to have two services on on sunday and i said brother and she's like yeah we're going to go he said he said we're going to go have a revival i said praise the lord i said okay so so he said he said don't worry about a thing he said i'll organize everything i will schedule all our places to go to and i will meet you at the airport and we will take you now brother gabriel has been serving and he's been at domestic since 1989. so brother gabriel's got you know he's got a good influence upon the believers there as a believer and and holding to the message and and just knowing that he's he's a pillar so um you know as as this was unfolding um you know there was a few things that we had to do before we ended up going and one of those things was basically get vaccinated so we walked by faith and doing that and then you know as the time got closer but they gave up brother gable confirmed and and basically just said hey all is well we're going to take you guys over here this is what's going to happen we've already made all these arrangements these people are going to come at this church then that night we're going to go here and it just unfolded so well that you know we could ask for more and realistically we didn't have to be there speak or do anything other than just fellowship with the believers because you you realize that the same word that produces sons and daughters here in america it's the same word that produces sons and daughters anywhere else and it's not the man that does the work but it's god through his messenger to the word i came for that produced that and it was a blessing because you know um i've never had you know fellowship with my own people you know i i was born and raised there and uh you know it was it was a privilege because you realize the love and and you know just talking about the prophet in my language and just this thing that united us you know i didn't have to speak english i already knew what they were meaning you know and just it was it was just beautiful i was so blessed and you know they're already expecting our pastor you know they're they're wanting to do a meeting for him next year so you know the lord's gonna maybe take him over there and we'll go over there and he'll preach the gospel to him but you know they know uh because it's the love that we have one for another that determines the spirit that we carry and brother brahm talks about the divine love that we carry so it was it was a privilege and uh you know it's a testimony and and i want you know as as we're going through if you can if you can get something out of the presentation of what we're doing is this could be you this could be you but not you going and having a just just being you listening to him just you listening to that still my voice and acting upon the word of god in you and be now you become one with the word and now you can do the same works that jesus did and i want this to be an encouragement for you guys i want you guys to just be encouraged and know that you know you can go to a school and testify to somebody you know you can go on the streets and testify like we've seen this morning just what the words doing you know there was nothing that we've done we just played the prophet and the prophet's word attracted and it was one i mean it was it was it was her reaction to the word so just have faith and so we're going to get started so as kosman said there's this big itinerary plan that i know nothing about and i i maybe found out about it about a week to departure and um we were brother gabriel knew that uh cosmon had a burden on his heart and wanted to go and just witness or testify in any way he could about the word and what it done for his life and so i was able to talk to brother gabriel and he had about nine services um planned and he said well we'll we'll have you take six of them and we'll have brother cosman speak at three of them give his testimony however he feels led and so i had a week and i'm like well praise god we'll we'll just look forward to what the lord has and so um this would be uh the beginning but i do want to say this as as i found that out our initial like cosmic said we just thought maybe we'd go into the area go in the highways and byways but then as i as i talked to brother gabriel and realized that really if if you were wanting to do missionary work you'd want a guy like that in boots on the ground and so i realized well lord what's your bigger picture here because uh this brother's taking us to some places that have have have a knowledge of the message and they're believers so we started to search in our heart what our part was now it was almost like a pivot that that now if we're not the ones going in the highways and byways let's come in and speak to these believers and these certain ones and and preach a word that can encourage them and empower them now to go out in the highways and the byways because they'll be a lot more effective than i could ever be and so we'll just continue uh right now into the slide show here so romania mission trip and we arrived in bucharest on saturday which was september the 25th and uh brother gabriel and brother billy were there at the airport they were there to welcome us this is a picture of myself and and uh brother billy uh who has been a believing this message uh for for many years and has done a lot of traveling so many people in europe know him my uncle uh uncle dennis knows him and also knows brother gabriel so we were welcome and to receive there on that saturday night and uh we would end up staying in bucharest saturday night and then we would be traveling uh the following morning to the to the sunday services go ahead brother so as we were traveling in the morning we stayed in bucharest saturday night we woke up in the morning ate breakfast and went straight to church and as we were getting into the area where the church was we realized that it was just a neighborhood you know there was no church it was just somebody's front yard and and so um straight straight to church was an hour and a half drive right also so so yeah we woke up in bucharest and straight to church was an hour and a half drive and just to hop in there as cosmo was saying we start to drive into this neighborhood and we're just turning down like little neighborhood roads and all of a sudden you see these people in a suit and dressed and someone that looks like it so they're just walking down the road we start driving by him and we we go a little bit further and there's a few more and we turn down and we see believers just walking down the street down the down down the the neighborhood road and then they start filtering in through in those neighborhoods they they have like a gate that keeps you know they run all the way where you can't even see into their yards and they'll have big metal gates that are maybe chained together or something you got to open them up and they all they open up this gate and they're they're starting to go in through this gate and we come to find out the believers are just starting to congregate in this at this home in in the front yard and usually the believers in that area would just have a house meeting inside but other believers were coming from around so there wasn't enough room inside the house and as you can see here they just they just all started to congregate in the yard and this would be our our first service in the city of colorado and we have a we have a little i'm not going to say that yeah i guess i'll go ahead i'll get him i can say i can say a few words in romania but some of these cities get me so yeah we uh we went ahead and yeah we traveled over to cuddle colorado on sunday morning so this was this was part of their morning um service we're going to play a small little video service [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yeah no ac no instruments um just just solo so we had we had great service that morning and um after brother matthew had preached uh there was a prayer line i believe we were um praying for about an hour hour and a half for the believers coming through there was a lot of them that came through and just asked for a change in their heart um some of them decided to follow the lord and you know one thing about areas like this where you're able to do a church service in somebody's front yard is that when things get amplified everybody gets curious so you had people just neighbors from off the street just coming in and just wanting to partake of that well you know the americans are coming that's that's the thing there you know the americans are coming they're coming with the gospel and they were expecting something from the lord and we've had people that you know were not even in the message just coming through the prayer line just asking i want to serve the lord and so it was it was great it was a great experience and and you know it it it produced a produce where some of them wanted to get baptized or here's a video of the location that's the river um it's a popular river that goes through there [Music] and this were the three souls that decided to get baptized brother matthew on the left by the billy on the right brother billy is kind of overseeing this area these two these two little areas here so there's uh there was a little sister to the right i believe she was either 11 or 12 and then the sister in the middle she was about 16 and then that was i believe a cousin and he was about 21 or 22. this is a little still frame of the video you just watched and i i wanted to point out this sister here because after we were done with the baptisms uh this sister just in her good sunday clothes there as we were we were about to start coming out of the water she just felt the lord move upon her heart and she said i want to get baptized too and so she just came walking out in the water and so this is a picture of us baptizing her there as she was baptized in in christian baptism and in the name of the lord jesus christ so we were just real honored for that and this next slide is just a picture of us and the brothers here if brother cosman if he'll just go ahead and start to explain the testimony we found out the brother next to him had a need he's kind of he's not a pastor uh per se but he's really uh feels uh to do his part to just get the believers together hearing the word and um we had an opportunity that brother gabriel mentioned that we were able to help him yeah so just like matthew was saying this brother here kind of isn't overlooking the the the believers there and you know he was even telling me sometimes if if they don't have a minister come through they'll just gather in a house and they'll just play a tape and just kind of listen to the prophet and just you know go forward how they can and how they're able to but continue believing so brother gabriel said hey you know this brother here is a very good brother he is the he's the brother that keeps things together here and the lord's really using them and he's got a car it's about to break down and um he would be good if somehow we can we can try to help him so um you know his name the brothers the brother's name is nelu so we the church helped them with a few dollars to be able to put towards replacing the new car and he was going to try to sell the one he's got because he was breaking down and try to put a little extra of what he had plus what the church gave him and he was able to use that and and gather the paper people you know a lot of people walk there you know a lot of people just they don't you can't have the funds to purchase a car and drive because it's expensive so sometimes you know uh you know picking picking uh pick and pick people up or you know just taking them the message books or whatever he can do to support the ministry there i i thought that was a really good um really good donation so we even noticed that the the vehicle you it was in was a very older vehicle and you had a bunch of people piled into there and so uh just know that that y'all were a part of that uh the church uh and and what y'all give y'all were a part in providing a brother there in southern romania transportation to continue to get the word to the bride and to keep them in fellowship so we that y'all are a part of that that is something you did um and so we want you to know that and so after uh going out there in the danube river as uh we picked a location there was nothing but shells on the bottom and yeah so the i'm i'm sitting to the left well to my left uh brother nello is right next to me i'm i'm putting my arm around him the brother in the middle right next to matthew and brother nello that's brother billy then you got brother matthew and then the one with the blue shirt that's brother gabriel so he's the brother that we traveled with amen and so after after going into the new river there and feeling like i was standing on razor blades for for a while i would have worn my shoes in there but i didn't have any change of clothes really where we got another hour and a half two hours to our next service and so um just as you see coming right out of the water right into the car right to the next service another hour drive to church on on the back on on the back sides of the roads of romania you know romania's is um it's not known for having good roads you know you have to avoid you have to avoid a lot of holes and potholes and cows and cows so so we we traveled we came we came to the evening service and this was uh our fellowship here on on that same evening service this is now sunday evening september 26th the first sunday we were there [Music] [Music] we were there praying for people for about an hour so he kept leading songs for an hour and he almost lost his voice that night yeah brother um brother cosman had an opportunity to testify and just give his a testimony what the word's done for him and how he wanted to be a witness and there was many people that come up for prayer that that were wanting to have that same type of of of a move in their life to where they would start to take this message and really live it out into the community so we had a good response to that and were able to pray with many so it was a it was a a fruitful fruitful evening as well as in the morning so one thing that you guys will see uh going forward from this first and second services that we fellowshipped around food a lot romanians like to eat let me just say that and so when you fellowship around food all the time then you just start it just wears you out so here's here's the beginning of it and and and i'll say this these you know they're they're precious brothers and sisters just just like our own and they they would receive us and it it was like special meetings for them amen and having that it was almost back-to-back nights it just there was there was food and more food so um some of the brothers here the brother that you guys see with the with the sweater he actually just called me a few a few days ago his name is uh i forgot it'll come back it'll come back but you know so yeah we we we fellowship with some of these uh some of these people so this is sunday evening and so we uh we're going the next day uh we're going to break up about 11 hours worth of driving for our service and by amare so we're going to take monday and tuesday to travel and this next slide is um monday morning after we went and did a little sightseeing at the in the at the port there in uh how do you say that costanza costanza um we we after we saw the port there and cosman really enjoyed it because he didn't ever see the port there in romania where all the shipping comes in and these believers invited us over their house and as they were always putting this food down in front of me i really didn't know that i was fulfilling scripture because luke 10 verse 8 says and into whatsoever city he enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you and that i did but you know i never even thought um i never even thought about it twice because these are my brothers and sisters in christ this is their labor of love and so um i'm thankful that they have good taste and um we but we enjoyed it it was good and so now uh this next this next frame is going to just show our journey now over the next uh a couple days a total of about 11 hours and so we were able to break it up into two days and and do a little sight scene on the way we were able to stop at this salt line and and just look at some of the countryside but this this next slide is is going to be as we're arriving into bayamari and um so this now is wednesday uh probably about five uh in the afternoon maybe four in the afternoon um so we we took uh uh monday uh tuesday doing some traveling and then um now we're we're we're coming into bayamari and i just thought it would be good to to um to show this to you because as we came into bayamari we come into this restaurant and i noticed that we're the only people there and you know i i didn't realize until a little bit later i started to to talk to brother cosman about it but actually this restaurant was owned by the pastor brother florin in by amare his family members owned this restaurant and because brother gabriel and sister mary had not been vaccinated they actually just closed down the restaurant so we could eat there and so we were able to have some good fellowship there and because they weren't vaccinated they they didn't want to have the restaurant open and that's when we started to realize that the romania was starting to um enforce restrictions and what they would say is that the the the town has now turned red and we found out that every time we'd come into a city it was almost like clockwork when we would leave that same night that the town would be turned red which means now curfew is in place you couldn't be out after eight o'clock and you couldn't go out into public if you didn't have a cur didn't have a vaccination which would have eliminated believers being able to come to the services and we realized that we'd come in and then right as we were leaving they'd like our they're actually at a uh 11 p.m tonight that uh we're turning red and so it was really it was really a blessing to see how the lord was allowed to get us in there before the curfews were in place and then we'd get out just in time so this is uh this is our lunch in that same restaurant you got brother paul sitting to the left he's actually out of spain and he um he's got an amazing testimony but he actually works for a lot of people that um might know you know soccer fame but he actually works for the owner of real madrid so you know he he does some sort of sales and he was in romania and he's been in romania working this project for about 10 years so he was able he's a believer so he was able to come fellowship with us you got brother gabriel right behind him and you got brother matthew all the way in the back brother billy and and myself and as you can tell you might not be able to see back where matthew's eating but he this is the first time he tried the tribe soup um good and uh i was i was surprised i i really didn't know that he would he would he would he would do i think all the believers there were surprised that i i uh i took it all on and i ate everything that was put in front of me gladly gladly so this is a picture right here that we sent over to our pastor brother david and he took one look at it and he said you know what cosmon you look tired matthew you look tired you look like zombies you need to get some rest and so after this meal we went to check into our hotel to get ready for the evening service and i was i was talking to brother cosmo and i was like you know what uh uh the pastor uh brother david feels like we're tired and we need to get some rest so we we need to just let them know send back a report that we're doing okay and so we just took a picture and we sent back and said hey we're here we're encouraged the lord is with us how we're doing good we're not tired we're not tired we're good we're good we're not tired we might look tired but we're not tired we're good so that was a little uh a photo we sent back and so then off into the car again a service is going to be only about a 10 or 15 minute drive from the hotel where we were staying in bayamari and we would pull up to brother florence church here if you'll notice this would be what would appear to be a picture of just a regular home but in the picture um that the door that's closest to you and the vantage point of that picture would be the entrance into his house um if you can zoom in towards the uh if it's possible to zoom in towards the entrance of the um the sanctuary and you can tell that uh to um the right there where he's pointing that is actually the entrance to the sanctuary and you'll find that most of the services that we are in they were either in a home they were in a rented office space and so brother florin uh was able to build a home in the sanctuary on the back side of it and so you'll notice in the next few clips this will be the service taking place just in the adjoining sanctuary on his home so this was wednesday evening this was um [Music] they didn't have the street like matthew caldwell down there [Music] all right so that was the song service and brother matthew uh preached a service here [Music] [Music] so the sister here um she's got an awesome testimony and we're going to play a few a few seconds of her of her song that she wrote but she was sitting one day in the kitchen and the present of the lord come down and she wrote this song in five minutes and it was melody and the words and so it was just you know she was testifying that she was writing it was just flowing through and you can tell that there was a inspiration from the lord there but um i'll try to translate as she's singing it so that way you could understand what she's saying um [Music] i didn't know anything [Music] for your grace [Music] i now understand what you did for me [Music] with your love you created me [Music] you gave me the word you gave me the prophet so i can understand who i am [Music] so she's got three verses um it's it's absolutely an amazing song and you know it just it just shows you that when we have the word then we speak the word and it could even be in a song like that i mean that's just it's just marvelous this is some more food yes you know we've you know the romanian culture is it's so awesome that you know they just pour everything they have and you know the the way they can try to blush you in any way is just to feed you and so um you know it takes work it takes a lot of effort i'm sure the sisters know and we were blessed by every bit of it the brother to the right has got an awesome testimony his name is brother viorel so right before matthew spoke at the service uh brother gabriel said hey why don't you go ahead and greet the people and just sing a song and so we were able to sing a few songs and and and just testify a little bit to the people and so i told the people you know we're from dallas and this is this is what um how the lord brought us to the message and just testifying a little bit so after the service he come to me and he said you live in dallas so i said yeah he's like um you know i have a brother that lives in dallas i said okay he said what's his name so he said his name is george i said okay i said what church did he go to he's like well he goes to a pentecostal church there in dallas i said okay well what church is like i don't really know i said okay well what's his last name so he said george zimbru well you know the amazing part about it is that i used to go to church with that brother at the pentecostal church here off of 30 and forest or you what is it um ferguson so we were involved there for two three years i know the brother i know his sons we used to serve together and i thought that was pretty neat that you know he was in the message and he said that he's told his brother about the message but i told him that i'm going to get his information and when i come back we were going to get in contact with him and we were going to try to see if we could testify you never know you know you never know he could be the last one so you know it was it was you know you just realize how how united we are with one another and sometimes we think this is a coincidence but it might be the plan of god so you never want to question or put away or put aside any things like this so i'm looking forward to it maybe he might be in our midst maybe you might see him amen i do want to testify that um you know it's it's the word that makes the difference and as we would come in and share the burden on our heart um just some of the testimonies that would come forth and you know that especially in this service one of the brothers said just the way that the word would come and discern the condition of our church and where we are and what we need and you just you just heard that uh multiple times and so that's what we expect in our own services that's what you expect over there is that the word of god is sharper than any two-edged sword and still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so we might be kind of going through this in order and geographically and might not have as much time maybe to spend but but on the all the testimonies and and all of the words that that were given back of what god had done and how god had spoke to him how god had touched their heart but in every one of these meetings it was supernatural people would come testifying they were touched they were prayed for there was a sister that was really touched um in um this uh service here and and she she gave testimony of it and then also um brother paul as you'll see here in a couple slides later he said that he knew these brothers were coming from america and uh this and he he just wanted to um uh he needed to hear something from lord there was a a situation in the family um that they they were needing an answer and certain things to get processed and get done and approved and this is brother paul there the closest in the picture and he testified that i came to the service expecting to hear he said what was spoken was was directly to my heart directly to the need and he said the very next day he got reports back from from home that uh the things had already been processed and already been approved and he had got the answer and god had taken care of everything and i believe that's just if when you come expecting when you come believe in you you come and have a need and and that's how it always should be i believe in the local assembly many times um you know it's where we become common one to another but if we can look past the veil and whenever our pastor gets up to speak we know that's god speaking and if we can approach the office approach the word that same way and say god you you know my heart the man does it and i believe that by faith god will speak to your need every time amen this was a little uh mountain area right next to bayamar the brother gabriel just kind of took a smaller detour and brought us through here um so in this picture here uh you got brother florin on the left where me and matthew are taking individual pictures that's the pastor there and uh he's also right there in the in the big picture and this this is his home that we showed you the front door that just right behind us there you'd come in and this is where we're having the fellowship and then of course the sanctuary was just adjacent there in the home so i believe it was that that same day after we got done with visiting this place here we immediately got on the road and did more driving so thursday so we had service wednesday now it's thursday and now we're on our way to cluj we're on our way to cluj about a two hours and 20 minute drive and we get to a hotel i believe um really late because we weren't expecting traffic so now we're getting in trying to uh trying to change real quick and then try to make service so we're gonna be with brother marius bunya there's a small little church there there are about 40 saints in that church and he's kind of he's the pastor over there and uh you know it's just amazing to see how the lord just united us just with the word and how our fellowship always been it's always been around the world and the testimonies and and how things just done for us and as we were driving to the church um we pulled up into this area and so matthew did a good job at recording uh the location we parked and we're following the brothers to church and also i'm looking around like all right this is the way to church so i was like i better get this get this to show the saints because this is what they have to walk through to go to church right here and i thought i would give some good perspective so we've just walked through this supermarket and um this is the way we're walking to the church so we parked on the other side of this building and now we've just walked through this marketplace and so now we're heading into this building so then we would go up about four or five flights of stairs to i don't know to the third or fourth floor and that's where they had rented a little office space and that's where the thursday evening service would be their inclusion september the 30th so this was a little bit of their song service that evening you notice the believers they they're singing those familiar songs so it's always good when you go over there and and you see the statue of a perfect man you see the pillar of fire they're singing the same familiar songs you you know you're in the right place [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know a lot of a lot of the churches like we were saying earlier you know they're not buildings they're just a gathering there's just an area where you might not even expect it but it doesn't matter you know they just want to be together they just want to be around the world and and that's that's that's what united is that that's what united them together so that's uh that's something that was always on my heart is just just to be aware of or just how the lord would deal with deal with me is is it's one thing to have a knowledge that god sent a prophet but there's such a depth to what god has done and his doing and so we're just always wanting to be mindful to encourage the people to go further in the message to go further on with god and that god was using them he was there was more for them and because you you find if we're not careful a lot of people will set up camp they'll set up shop they'll think they've arrived and just because we sing the songs and we got the you know the statue of a perfect man uh doesn't mean we've arrived but yet we need to keep on going with the message and follow that pillar of fire as it's leading us amen so this was a service thursday night [Music] [Music] it was it was uh just a little tough for me to try to preach in romanian i know before i left but the david said you know you need to preach in your language so i i uh i uh matthew told me the same thing so i did it but you know if you look in the in the video at the end you see brother gabriel sitting right in the front he was like my coach so if i didn't know a word in romanian i would look at him i would say it real fast and he would help me translate but you know but but just a few times he only needed it yeah by the by the grace of god he was because he speaks romanian yeah so this was uh we were traveling uh that day more traveling this is brother gabriel now we uh we just stopped at a fruit stand just on the side of the road and we found some jelly and some apples eating eating hey brother gabriel that'll just hear some fruit we'd pull over here so brother gabe we are so stuffed from last night we can't eat another thing but but he was gracious but beautiful countryside romania absolutely gorgeous we just put a few pictures in here just to show the countryside and this next slide that we'll come to is a salt mine called selena turda assault mine and uh it was you can't even really even know what's going on here but that's way down in the bottom there is uh people are actually down there there's water surrounding those little constructions and people are little paddle boats and that's that whole wall is a big cavern of salt that's thousands of feet deep i believe and and it's just an amazing thing so at some point we'll be able to uh maybe just in fellowship show some more pictures of that but that that going into here gave me some inspiration because now we're we're on our way to um service in honodora and um i just uh i got some inspiration out of this because when you pull up to this salt mine it's just on a little hill and there's just this little entrance and i just thought you know that's so true when you when you when you come up to something you don't just stop at the entrance but if you'll go in and you'll go down the little hallway and you'll keep going a little further and all of a sudden you go all the way down into the deep depths of it you look up and around it's just like oh my and i just use that as some inspiration to encourage the people to keep going further in the message because there's so much more that god has for you and this is a little clip here we they would pop up out of the middle of nowhere but has anybody ever heard of gypsies well i know a few and it's amazing though that they they they will uh they will just take these homes and they'll put all this gold and metal and put it all over but they'll just you'll be just driving and also to pop out of nowhere and and since on this trip we were following brother gabriel and brother billy uh we we followed close behind him i don't know for 12 days straight and so that's all we did is we stayed right behind him so we couldn't pull over and take pictures that are only so we drive by and so fortunately i caught a little clip here and i just wanted to to share that with you that you so you could see these these uh gypsy homes that they would i'd they would just put a so much stuff on there and all of their fences would they would they would coat them with i doubt real gold but they'd make it look that way for sure so that was a really neat uh just kind of seeing those uh pop up as we'd be driving through and also out of nowhere you see this big colorful house with with all these uh real bright and all this metal and things all over it so that was on our way to juanadora so now it is friday evening we have service at six pm and we've traveled now how far how many hours was that um that was uh about two and a half hours so this was the service as we were kind of traveling through um you know we we ran into some traffic as well we're uh running 4 30 4 45 we still have some time and now we're having to drive straight to church we can't get changed matthew just kind of improvises and and changes in the car and we get to the service we're already 15 minutes late and so um brother matthew we job of the matthew offer brother gabriel and so you know parking's not like we have here at our church it's like going to a downtown area so you have to go look and you have to park and you sometimes you if it's illegal you just do it you just pay the ticket you know you just move forward so um that's that's just the mentality of a romanian you know it's just what it is whenever they talked about it was in romanian so i didn't know what they were doing so we we ended up parking so me and brother billy we ended up walking a few minutes late brother matthew was just getting ready for service sitting in the pew in the chair pulling up his notes so then i walk up and so we're walking in the into the service um we're walking into the service around 6 15. i just got in i put my bag down and brother gabriel just looks at me and he said go say something and go sing a few songs literally he just walk i mean parks the car walks in doesn't even have a chance to move in to the chair he sets it down and looks at brother gabriel and he points so he goes up and uh he leads a song and and maybe we'll have a chance sometime to sing the song together but we got a little clip of some singing here that uh the romanian star was leading us in worship here it was wonderful [Music] [Applause] [Music] i was excited [Music] the saints were an expectation here they come believing and you could feel uh the atmosphere was charged and they were really looking for god to do something so it was neat to just be able to walk into those services and see those believers already singing and creating an atmosphere and expectation for the word and this word this song talks about the word having power and um and here they reply yes it does they're just responding to the song but you know right before we uh ended up singing the song [Music] i wanted i wanted them to understand that you know [Music] when we sing these songs they have a meaning you know and sometimes you know you grab some of these songs that come from different writers or from you know just bringing it from an old pentecostal church that written you know but you know just like that song was saying the word has the power well you know you're trying to identify and explain you're the word so if the word has the power sing the song like you have the power because the word is in you so you bring it back to what the prophet had said you know even though it was written maybe it was song the different way in the pentecostal church because some people came from pentecost well look the prophet says this so when you sing the song identify what the prophet says and if the word has power you're the word you have power and it just it just brought an enlightenment to their to their way of how they sing and how they worship the lord and you know in in our language but so this is uh the service that friday night and there's more food more food they ordered some pizza so we ate some pizza that night whether matthew was just excited you know it's pizza it's american stuff he felt comfortable eating that so that's the friday evening service and now we're going to be traveling over towards um a rod where brother gabriel's hometown is so after the friday evening service we're going to drive about two hours two and a half hours to arrive where we're going to stay at brother gabriel's home now and we'll be staying there friday night saturday night and sunday night and this is a picture of myself and brother cosman and brother gabriel's son whose name is my brother reuben brother reuben that's right and so now we're gonna just that's gonna be our home base for uh a couple days we're gonna have um um so that's friday night we're gonna have service saturday night and so uh we got about um i would say it's about almost a two hour drive over to our for our saturday service and this was uh really neat because um once again i need help with these names brother langella brother lingell my uncle dennis uh brother dennis mcgeary ministered at this brother's church 30 years ago and i was just i thought it was really neat just the same exact building and so i'm coming 30 years later just to to minister in the same place and i thought that was really neat so they were one brother billy was even showing pictures if i would have thought better i would have included that slide in in here that brother billy sent a picture of of himself and uh uncle dennis when he was there 30 years ago and so that that was really neat and so we have a couple slides at this service here this was a service at 4pm once again familiar songs amen [Music] [Music] i have i had fun building this thing i really did i really had a good time it was it was awesome so this is more food so once again um you know in a lot of the homes there if you're familiar with what i would call like zero lot lines when i there's some communities around town where it's like the the home adjacent to you is like built right on the property line so it's like their wall of their house is is the end of the property and then your yard would start there and so this uh where they're having service was in a home um and right behind us is a wall to another building but there's a little courtyard there and they set up this table with all this food and just right above us was this arbor of grapes that was just growing and so you'd see the believers stand up on a chair and just grab a cluster of grapes and they would eat the grapes and i just thought you know it was really neat because we had a wonderful service and then they come out and they had a table spread full of food and and there under this uh grapevine we sat there and and feasted with the saints there and so that was just a really neat experience there at that service and this was saturday evening so sunday morning and sunday evening we had services here at uh arad um october 3rd this is the sunday before we're heading out so brother gabriel how to reserve both services for his uh sanctuary and that's his brother gabriel in his office you know you see all the all these pictures of the prophet and the lord jesus and the statue of the perfect man and a picture of israel and the flag and just the love of the word and he's such a wonderful brother and we have such a good time you know it just it just it just shows you the love of this message and how it they cling to it just as much as we do here you know and and that was that was a testimony so here's a few clips of the services there this is their youth group just singing [Music] no david i don't know if you can pause that so we can move over to the next video but um this is about two minutes [Music] and this these are songs that i grew up with you know i remember i remember the songs when i was a little kid five six seven year old and we were singing these these songs in church you know [Music] so here's here's the song that i usually do at a church and let's see if it's going to play okay now that was that was cosmin on the squeeze box yeah so this was a sunday morning service um [Music] anointed to just translate you know he was just in the spirit with matthew and you know they were united and it was just um the word really came forth it was it was uh it was really a good time this is our fellowship after church and no that's not brother darian he did not come to romania and fellowship with us for one service that's brother chris his name is brother chris christie in romanian wonderful brother he's my brother and so we um you know we fellowship around the word and you know the picture to the left is me and brother billy and his two sons and brother gabriel and brother matthew at the at the edge but yeah there was it was more food and more fellowship and it was good this is the sunday evening service that night [Music] so as we were traveling the next monday after the services were done we started uh leaving our out we're heading to our service on tuesday evening to cebu so we had monday as a travel day and we were just traveling through some romanian country and we've come upon some of these um areas where you really have true shepherds and that is a shepherd's coat not a true shepherd by shepard's coat well yeah because that's cosman and myself and those we we put those on but they were you stop by certain places and they they have some of the you know the traditional um romanian garb or whatnot you could put on and take a picture so we're on our way um i guess ultimately we're going to say bu yeah we're going for tuesday and we did some sightseeing there we're able to uh pull over some of the mountain views and here we got a little picture of uh uh brother gabriel and sister mary and just a little if you could just see those mountains behind you we're about maybe seven thousand eight thousand feet and we had a really neat experience as we were just kind of driving through the mountains uh we were just looking down this expansive mountain range and then we kind of looked off to the left and then just coming around the mountainside you saw there's these little speckles on the side and then you you gotta you could tell they were moving and all sudden you realized it was just uh hundreds of sheep that were coming around the the side there and so we just kept driving down and we pulled over to get pictures and we just felt me and cosmin both just without really even talking like we just wanted to go we just felt attracted to to go up there and there was a oh i believe over a thousand sheep that was just coming over the ridge and so we just started to run up the the mountain side and taking pictures and video and then then we saw off behind this there's the shepherd there and he come up on a little knoll there and we heard him uh uh screaming towards the uh uh the sheep he was he was hollering to the sheep and so we we have a little uh uh a clip here uh because cosmon understood of course what he was saying because he speaks romanian and so so john john 10 1 says john 10 1 says i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep so as we come up there cosmon had heard what he was saying and he was uh we started to talk to him and cause them started to ask him what you were saying and we were able to actually use what his occupation was as a tool to testify to them about the good shepherd and then he went to confirm with him and start to ask him what was it that you were saying to those sheep and we actually were able to get uh get that on film of what uh what was happening [Music] instead of saying something else to her he said you call her a wanderer and then she'll get back in line wow that's exactly with the vision yeah get back in step yeah get back in step absolutely so even we even put the uh the just that quote up there brother bran i'm saying and ashamed he says one of them got out of step and i was getting her back in step two of them it was and that's what i was supposed to do keep that bride and step and so it was just neat to see a natural shepherd standing there and and he said i don't have to say anything else i just have to let them know they're getting out of step hey and and the actual word he was using he'd go you're wandering and when the sheep heard that they were wandering they would just he just say you're wandering and they would get right back in and close with the fold and i thought how beautiful that is that we've received a message and that when we just listen to the prophet and listen to the message and and and if if you start getting off the path is get back in step just just you'll be the final voice to the final age under your messenger and so we just want to stay under that voice and that's the message that we were sharing with the believers in romania that that we've received a great message and stay with that word and so now we arrived in cebu so this was a as we we draw to a close on our our uh report um this was actually an extra service that we did not plan for originally because our flights uh for we were originally going to fly out on tuesday but it was canceled and there wasn't no flight on a monday tuesday and wednesday the airline was not offering any return flights so the only thing that was available was to come to extend our trip to 15 days and come back on thursday and so this was the service uh that was an extra service that was added and so i started to consider you know well lord if if um what what would you what would your mind be for this service because um you know the flights were canceled we wouldn't be meeting with the believers they usually uh met on thursday and they agreed to meet on tuesday uh to be able to receive us and so we we come into the uh the service there we're like well lord what would you have and the pastor greeted me there at the very beginning and he said i've listened to you i was able to go on and i've listened to you preach and we're happy to have you but we want to let you know that we have a curfew and so we we nee we need to be done by seven o'clock and you can't you can't uh you can't be too noisy so i said well praise the lord we're happy to be here amen you know we'll we'll we'll do our best but but that's how um they were because actually um they they were afraid of some of the complaints and that night actually i believe it was that day that that town had just turned red um as it was turning red that evening and so they were going to be enforcing that's why they had to be uh curfew by seven i believe so the believers could be home by eight so as we came into that city they had turned it turned red but uh we had service at five and so uh by god's grace though we we about the first 30 minutes you know um we were we were doing uh you know just uh some more uh perspiration then maybe uh you know we were plowing away but then the spirit really broke and the people really received the word and and we felt lord what this was the extra service what would you have for them we just wanted to let them know to to keep going on with the message and uh we were able to tie in and and uh uh uh use that little experience we had about um there on the mountainside with all those sheep and be able to uh uh tell them about how this message and how god is as leading his sheep so so this is a picture with the pastor there uh brother nick who is that right and i believe this would conclude that the services that we had uh that was tuesday night so now um we're going to be traveling um start to travel back towards bucharest but we're going to that evening we actually cosmon wanted to stop into his hometown there and be able to meet with some family so go ahead so as brother matthew was saying i i really wanted to go by and still uh see them you know the family that i was talking to you guys about earlier about bringing the message and that day um as we were traveling wednesday we were able to stop and just go by and just see them and and just talk to them and you know what was beautiful is that out of the four hours that we were able to spend together three of them were about the lord and so we were sitting in his house and you know he just started pouring his heart out and so i had both of my cousins there and their kids and so as we were just bringing the prophet into the image and as we were bringing the lord into the image now and as we were just talking to him to them about the lord they recognized that the things are that they're it's happened they're not getting any better and so they they they realize how and and they have the influence of a pentecostal church there but it's dead it doesn't produce anything you know there's barely anyone come in the church anymore so they um they really responded to the lord and you know my cousin in the back on the left uh she's in her 50s her name is nicolina she that night she wanted when we prayed she wanted to give her heart to the lord so i mean he went up beyond what we could even ask you know and and and you see the desire and the burden that the lord put upon my heart and upon brother matthew's heart and he orchestrated in such a way that everything that he had in plan was accomplished by just walking and stepping in faith amen if enough i could say that it would the lord really showed us favor because um with all of the restrictions and the traveling i mean going through customs going through security going into the countries and and just traveling around um it the lord really granted us favor um and we were able to freely move throughout the city um and through customs and on our travel and like i said we'll we just in time we'll be able to share more with testimonies and certain uh things that god did there but this just kind of gives an outline of of our journey and how we traveled and so this is just a little map to show that we we went all over romania i traveled a little over 2 000 miles but about 30 over 30 hours of driving or more and we ended up traveling in about 10 different cities uh we ministered at nine different churches um and be able to meet with a number of believers and so it's just uh it was such a grand opportunity we really thank you for sending us for supporting us with your prayers it made a big difference this work is uh what you're a part of and i i had to step back and realize that you know what we thought maybe we were going to do is going in the highways and byways and witness but god allowed us to to get contacts all over romania now and so we actually we know the believers throughout romania so we it's on our heart to go again and now we we know we can go into these areas and be received and then that can be a place to launch from in the communities and also just encourage the believers to continue to take this message out into the highways and byways and we want the believers in romania doing what we're doing here we want to be going out in the highways and byways because we're looking for that last sheep amen praise the lord so as brother matthew was saying fellowshipped over 500 believers um you know the church was able to help a few families and as we were telling you about the brother with the car but you know the most important thing that that we were able to see was the fellowship of the believers you know even though they didn't have much whatever they had they put on the table they wanted to be a blessing and you know just know that there's the same group of people maybe with a different culture maybe with the different tradition but they're fellowshipping around the same word expecting the same thing and so it was just a privilege to be able to just have fellowship with them so um right at the end as we were leaving cbu um we ended up just taking a video of brother gabriel just bringing his salutation to the church and to our pastor and so i had this video of him just recording a a salutation to the church so um this is this is brother gabriel and as we're playing it brother this will conclude our our um our missionary reports we'll just ask our pastor to come at this time and this will be brother gabriel just greeting you and just giving his salutations to the church so god bless you [Applause] brothers and sisters from christian life tabernacle for this occasion i wanted to thank you in the wonderful name precious name of our lord jesus christ thank you for the for the we thank to the lord and also to you for supporting the ministry of of brother matthew and also brother cosmi they have been a great great blessings everywhere where we have been visiting churches many souls was very much blessed and for the glory of the lord and for the benefit of the kingdom of the lord jesus christ we want to wish you all the blessings and may the the lord richly reward you and if the lord there is we will like we will be very much blessed to be beneficial for of the ministries that you have in your churches also if the brothers can come over to encourage us and to be a great blessing for us we pray for you please pray for us and we are looking for the day when our lord jesus will call us home we love you appreciate you and may the lord richie the lord jesus continue to bless you and be with you till we meet shalom [Applause] amen did you enjoy that i think matthew and cosmic represented us well don't you good ambassadors for the lord and and we're looking for other opportunities to go and maybe hold some meetings but so now there's a special treat so you can further experience what these brothers suffered didn't look like they went through too much suffering didn't they but we do have some sister deborah made some uh cabbage rolls some meatballs some soup for us so uh matthew and cosmo will be serving it just to give you an opportunity to taste some romanian food so after they serve everybody if there's any left and you still want to have another snack talk to them about it so anyway what we'll do is we'll we'll let the uh thing that we stand for we'll let the elders go first and then you can kind of fall in line after that whatever pecking order that you think you're in but there's there's enough for everybody to have a sample so let's stand together let's keep let's keep the uh this work on our heart and we're going to put some of our effort uh and our finances towards the work in romania it it it's a work that's suited for us having romanian uh ministers with us and brother stephen i i'm working with him to have a service for us and he's shy and running but i've always i've already met the best runner from the ministry i ever met and that's brother billy so nobody can run from the ministry like brother billy ran from the ministry so but we wrestle them in and it's been a blessing to us hasn't it so we're looking very soon for for our brother and he can preach in romanian and we'll hear the interpretation and we'll get a good feel for watson but i think god's got some work for us to do there so amen let's bow our heads together our heavenly father lord to see the gospel come alive lord to see that little lady and i know how precious her sunday clothing was to her the others had baptistal gowns on but yet lord your spirit moved upon her and without hesitation she took her sunday best and went into the water to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus father that kind of inspiration inspires us also to see that you're the same yesterday today and forever and that you're gathering your bride all over the world father and it's been freely given so we freely give father we thank you this evening for the little snack and partaking of the sample of romanian food father that we can just have this taste and join our hearts with our brother and sisters there we're thankful for the hands that prepared it father we're thankful for the wonderful grace that we have father the presence that we felt tonight and the encouragement to see you move supernaturally father we ask you to continually to work in our behalf in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen god bless you if you are dismissed and to make your way to the back and enjoy a sample of romanian food god bless you you
