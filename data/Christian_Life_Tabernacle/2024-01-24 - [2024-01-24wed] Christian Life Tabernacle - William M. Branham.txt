Description:
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 24, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

we just ask you to bless us and be with us in your precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen Lord bless you tonight uh we're going to listen tonight to 40 minutes of the uh sermon I believe it's uh God's power to transform all right and uh so we're going to start where he reads the scripture and U oh thank you musicians and so much enjoyed that special tonight and the opening prayer and all that is just wonderful but I still can't see real good so uh just keep me in your prayer uh I I know I'm getting better um but uh we'll just do it and and uh it's kind of a a little hard time in my life right now uh with my mom and uh you know she's getting older but she's still doing really well I guess she's getting older she'll be 102 so uh uh we're grateful to have her and she's still in good spirits and still happy and of course you know that uh we're going through CR time uh with my sister and and uh dealing with the her alcoholism and we're trying to get her into rehab and that's a burden on my mom but I'm glad God's got an answer for it all and that answers his word and you know nothing can be done unless God speaks it yes amen everything came into the world before there ever was a star or everything God in his great mind he had it in his mind but he had to say Let There Be Amen Let There Be and along those lines he spoke your name and he put you in that Lamb's Book of Life and he sealed you there and nothing can put your name on there and nothing can take it off and and if we could anchor our faith and the reason I want to play this little uh portion of God's power to transform because many times we get discouraged with ourselves but if we can understand that God's got the power to transform and when that seed is planted into the ground that little corn seed that little wheat seed it and it it it rots away and then that little blade start starts up its desire is to become a a a wheat again but all in between that is the power of transformation God transforming it and bringing it to what that he had in his mind and that's what we have to have faith in tonight so uh we're just going to go right into it we're going to listen to 40 minutes and then uh if you'd like to uh there's two great messages uh God's power of to transform and the power of God's transformation and we're on Sunday morning we'll be speaking from uh the these two uh sources and so tonight's just kind of a Prelude and I I I'm I'm looking forward to God's word and the excitement of it and really what he wants us to Anchor our faith in and uh remember we can't do anything without him but with him we can do all all things amen and and boy if we could just get to that and there's a little remarkable place in this tape where brother brandom talks about a sister in a wheelchair I want you to play pay special attention to that so let us go ahead and start uh I believe they're going to start around paragraph uh 37 and brother bram's going to uh turn over and begin to read in the Book of Romans so uh soon as he's done reading the scripture go ahead and take your seat and just listen intently it won't be long and then uh we'll just finish up our service this evening so keep me in your prayers and uh I I I know that I'm in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck me out and I you rejoice in the good times right and we rejoice in the bad times and if we're going to reain with them we have to suffer with them and uh uh what I'm going through is not nearly uh what I've seen a lot of people go through so uh I'm just I'm grateful for God for all his goodness and Grace to me you know I can see good enough to drive uh but uh it's the small things that I can't see but uh I know I'll be all right I know that I know that for a fact amen and not only that I'm going to get a new body and and I'm going to have hair and uh uh and I'm going to be able to see and hear and and it's going to be wonderful amen amen so I've had a lot of good years on life and and uh whenever he chooses to take me I I want to be ready to go and I want to be glad to go and I want to be able to say like Paul said I fought a good fight I've ran the race now I'm waiting for the crown so God bless you tonight as we enjoy our Prophet m messenger also I'd like to thank all the brothers that ministered uh David Jr and the wonderful job he did uh Billy and Paul and brother Andrew and Matthew and brother Beno I just thought it was just outstanding so Lord's richly blessed us let us enjoy our messenger tonight amen so God bless you tonight let's pray father bless this word to us this evening we pray in Jesus's wonderful name amen a very familiar chapter I want to take a a few verses here and about first two or three verses two verses I think it is and read and in this uh try to explain it the best that I know how by the help of the Holy Spirit Romans the 12th chapter I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service I thought that was so beautiful for this group this morning what you do now and and is a conjunction as I understand and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God that's what we all want to do is be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be trans form from the Natural Things of Life uh and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word now my subject is the power of transformation I may leave my Bible here I used to be years ago when I was a young man like these men I I didn't have to set down my scriptures and and things when I was studying but now since I have uh getting old I I carry me a little book and I and when I get something my jot it down have to put it on the scripture used to I just had that line of scriptures right in my mind I just come right down but dear friends I'm not young like you all this morning but I'm old and I've been through many hard battles see and by going through those hard battles brings you where you are this morning you see so I'm sure you understand that God has put me through it that my life might open up a to say this is it see then you all run over that road but before me there was someone opened up the way for me to go see and we open up the road one far the other and as you see sometime an old veteran getting old and his uh marks all over him as Paul said one time I bear in my body the marks of Jesus Christ you see how Timothy looked upon those marks I guess with reverence as he committed to Young Timothy now um transforming used to work for a Public Service Company where we had Transformers and to transform now the word is the word means in itself uh something uh like uh to transform means something has been changed something has changed from one thing to another and as I want to speak for the next 45 minutes or an hour on on the transforming I would like to to use uh this text and I I may say some things in you it seems very strange and as brother Le always just said take it this study over a little while see just think of it part a little bit to be transformed is to be changed to made something different like a a tadpole is transformed from a tadpole to a frog see once he's a looks like a catfish he swims around he's got a head and his tail and everything looks just like a a catfish then after while he begins to lose he loses the tail and he's he's transformed from one species to another I think that's what Paul must have had in mind when he said be transformed by the by the renewing see let me get that right and be not conformed you know what conformed is be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind renewing of your mind the things that you once thought upon to be precious lay that aside and be trans form to something else to what you was one time to what you are now see by the renewing of your mind that you might prove that good and acceptable and perfect will of God oh that's what we all want to know how to do it see we're here we love him he saved us now we want to know what to do and we were trying to take a little step this morning to raise up this a little bit higher sometimes we have to hit things that just hold on for a few till we we see what it comes out to be now in Genesis the first chapter the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters we realize that the water the Bible said in the beginning uh back there that this the world was without farm and was void there was nothing but just a darkness of chaos and uh and what a horrible shape it must have been in nothing but way into the darkness Yonder without light or anything and the churning of the water that wandering star um twisted around and around the orbits out there somewhere it must have been a a terrific mass of of something lost like it was couldn't find its way and that's what we become when we become wandering Stars away from God just without hope without god without just turning around out in darkness not knowing when we're where we're going and God took that great chaos of darkness and transformed it into a Garden of Eden see by his word that's how we're transformed by God's word when God said let there be light and that mass of creation out there come over in around the Sun and begin to revolve around the Sun and became a Garden of Eden because it obeyed the word of God it done the perfect will of God for it was transform from chaos into a Garden of Eden by the word of God now that's what we are here for that's my message has been all along is the word of God we must hold to that regardless of what other things take place always stay with that word always uh uh check out your motives and objectives if it is according to the word of God if it isn't leave it alone but if it's with the word of God and lines up with the word of God then that you hold to that now God sometimes just like your little group here this morning he lets it not happen just overnight he lets God we're the one that gets in a hurry God's never in a hurry he just says it it's going to be for when he says anything it's got to be it's just going to be he lets it take its time he let the Hebrew children and famous characters of the scripture that was standing on God's word to be true they said our God is able to Deliver Us from this fire furnish nevertheless we won't bow to the image because it's against the word see although if he slays us he'll raise us up again you see but see and they he let them walk right up to the age of this great furnace and drop into it before seemed like he even paid any attention like he wasn't even watching but he's always watching he's always watching for this now God said let there be light and 6,000 years that took this Eden to come into existence and we're taught in the scripture for one day of upon the Earth is is a thousand years with god well Thousand Years upon the Earth is one day with God so it took 6,000 years to make this Earth and to bring it into an Eden but you see it was God the Great Master of all intelligence and he he had in his mind what he wanted to do just like when the man that built this trailer when the man that uh when your brethren here that designed this park how you'd make it it was in your mind you kept working that Vision out that's way God did about the world he worked is in his mind and if you notice it come like by Evolution like he was learning more all the time making something greater and greater but see he was above it all and just let it evolute up to that to see everything he be to bring up on the Earth from botney life and fish and so forth that come on into Birds and animals then something in his own image a man and stopped there because it was up to his Perfection of what he wanted that's why you start like this trailer you might lay the frame down and you say what are you doing like you when you all move the first rocks away from this corner here what are you doing see it look like it be like it is now it looks like a little eeden because it was in your mind what to do you just kept working up now we want to be transformed ourselves by the renewing of our mind see not what we have on this Earth what we are going to look for on this Earth but what we are coming to in the world that is to come transformed by renewing of our mind now 6,000 years uh God taken to make this and we see in Genesis 1 now we see that in this God had a had a objective that he wanted to bring to pass and um so many people in teaching on Genesis back here in the first chapter and the second chapter and third chapter especially it looks like a god repeats himself or he says he went ahead and said all these things that he did oh let there be light let there be this and let there come forth and there wasn't even one thing yet wasn't nothing wasn't the light that that old world was still floating out there in that Darkness covered with water but see he had spoke his word and then that's when he was speaking now we notice here in Genesis 1 uh he said and he formed man in his own image and his own likeness in the image of God made he he made him male and female see he was making man he just spoke the word then we find out after his many days of that pass maybe hundreds and hundreds of years there was still no man to tell the sorrow nobody to K the sorrow so then God formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth see he had spoke the word and then the word had to take place now we he said let there be light maybe it might have been hundreds of years maybe 800 years before there ever was a light but it come to pass because God said so and God's going to have a church I don't care how many Dark Ages we go through and whatever more he's going to have a church without spot or ankle whether we're part of it or not because he's already said it was going to happen it's going to be there and and he commanded to to transform it into the plant life and all every life that he put forth he said these words like let there be a palm tree let there be an oak tree let there be a fur look down the desert where we live down here in Tucson out on there there's Cactus jumping cactus all kinds of cactuses just 30 minutes in there there Sherman Pine up on top of the mountain now this Cactus will not grow up there and neither will that Sherman Pine grow down here now where was the intelligence that planted the seed they had to come from somewhere it was God's word let there be and it was now we find out all this actually had made it transforming it into the its kindness life and is all put in by the word of God the Creator it all we find out this all headed up in a headquarters called The Garden of Eden and God put his son and his son's bride over it all this great creation see had a reason for it he made everything so pretty he made the flowers and the life and the birds and there's no death no sin no sorrow no sickness and then and all this great thing headed up into one big headquarters which was the Garden of Eden and there he put his son Adam and Adam's bride wife now you might say it was his wife potentially it was his wife but he had never never really been his wife yet like in the scripture we find out where he said Joseph thou son of David fear not to take un thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is all the Holy Ghost see now it was his wife when he made a promise to marry her or to have her but yet it wasn't his wife yet because he had never knew her as a wife so that's the way it was here reason I said God's son and his bride Adam had never knew his wife as a wife but yet it was his wife potentially just like the church now and Christ now then all could rest because all of God's good word seeds that he had spoke had brought forth of its kind that Earth come over there was light there was sunshine when he let the sunshine now why did he make the sunshine he had in his mind see that if the sun don't shine the flower won't grow that is speaking to existence he makes everything to meet its purpose whatever it is like a tree it Bears a certain Acron or it Bears the apple he makes the fruit of the garden and so forth it's all for his purpose and everything had come to pass and he had spoken now the only thing he had to do after spoken it he speaking it rather he could go to rest because he had spok spoken and it was all has to come to pass because he had spoken I don't know how much you had to go through before it come to pass how many Rejects and whatever more but it had to come to pass because he said it would come to pass he had spoken the same thing it is about having a church here in the last days he's going to have a bride he's able to these stones to rise children to Abraham if we don't follow him he'll get somebody else that will follow him see he's going to have it because he's already spoken whatever he says it has to be that way it cannot change it must come forth that way because he said it would and all this great thing that he know would come to pass after he he had spoke it he could take a rest everything under control his seed was his word and his word is a seed Jesus said it was and everything would be all right because he had set forth to bring forth of his kind transforming only to its kind the his word had to be of its kind if he said a palm tree he didn't mean a palm and Oak mixed together he meant a palm tree here and an oak tree here everything positionally in its place oh if we could only learn that at what part of the word we are we must take our place no matter what is think of a little sister here in the wheelchair sometime how many faithful prayers has been made then we don't understand so we committed to God and with she's a flower here among you with her pleasantness and everything see that we can get up and go around how she would long to do that but yes she's Pleasant just the way she said so I always get inspired to watch the little lady see because she we all believe in healing we've seen God do Miracles far beyond that see and she knows that too but she willing to take her place see whatever it is that's what we want I believe it's David said I'd rather be a doormat at the house of the Lord than to dwell in tents with the wicked you see no matter what it is take my place sometimes you have to separate from everything is dear on Earth you to take your POS position that God has called you to I'm sure you can read between the lines what I'm saying see sometimes a very darest personal ear you have to shake hands with it to take your position in Christ to where God has called you see but what's God doing transforming you from what you was maybe a daughter son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else because it's his way of doing it see by the renewing of your mind to obey the word of God regardless of what the price is these things don't come it didn't call our Redemption wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of God had to die for us see it isn't things of value come of great pricee to bring this message it wasn't easy no it isn't I had forsake everything was dear to me even my own people everybody but you see the value of it is you see is to do the will of God and to do that which knowing there's something in me when they used to say well this go to put me away you thought I lost my mind baptizing in the name of Jesus Christ contrary to the church and all these things that said he crazy but you see no matter what they said there's something has to be done and God just takes a person sticks him in his hands and say do this and you do it how a price it might have been St Paul taught under Gia the greatest teacher of the day and to come down in the very thing that he considered heresy the things that he thought that was the worst things that could have happened to the church he comes right around and becomes a partaker of it a strange thing and how God works in wondrous ways and strange odd ways his wonders to perform when God had spoke it he know his word was a seed and it could it would bring forth of its kind that was commanded to bring forth only of its kind and it'll always do that if man don't tamper with it and so would God's church and everything else bring forth of the kind like it was at the first if theologians didn't tamper with that word trying to put it somewhere else or something else God has spoke it and no matter how much they can they try to contaminate and tampered and so forth it's going to bring forth of its kind there's just nothing to stop it I hope I don't sound like I'm yelling at you is that too loud see now we find everything in order God spoken he said let there be let there be and let there be a Eden let there be beautiful flowers let there be my son in my own image stand over there in the Garden of Eden and let his bride stand by his side oh how beautiful what that was and the father he was a father you see so there come his own children coming forth and he made a paradise for them God loves to do things for his children don't you remember how you mothers and how no matter how you had to lounce the table if Junior need a good pair of shoes that he liked you do it see whatever it was to do something for your children Dad how you'd work a little harder to get something for the children see well that just shows that we're way down here a parent he's the extreme parent see how much more no wonder the Apostle said eye is not seen or ear is not heard it has the enter the heart of man what God has for them in story that love him we just can't conceive in our mind we our mind isn't eligible of thinking the right right direction what God has for store in us that love him see we I can imagine what it would be I can think what it would be but I my mind's not not not capable of thinking how great it is it's beyond that could you imagine what heaven to be when we all be there and young and no sin and no oh what a beautiful place but see it's beyond that see we can't even enter the heart of man what God has for them in store he spoke it and it's going to be sold now after all this beautiful layout that he had there of his I don't mean to sit in that word layout but kind of uh like the uh don't the mother before the coming child don't they call that L they get the all the little uh booties and everything ready you know just for the arriving of this uh a little uh portion of love that God has sent him getting there that's what God did for Adam and Eve he created this Garden of Eden he spoke it it was in his mind and when he says it then it has to happen bear that on mind now what he says it must happen see he can't nothing can can hinder it nothing can keep it from happening there's nothing can keep it from happening God said so and settles it God said it it's going to happen I had all this in mind he said let there be that's Genesis 1 you see Let There be this let there be that let there be he's sewing seed let it be there let it be here let it be here and he knew it was going to be that way because he cannot change now that gives us Faith then and what he said here it's going to be so let's let that seed fall into our hearts and we might be the beding grounds of that see into our hearts and let us act out this place that he's placed Us in in the last days let the seed fall in our hearts Lord let Thy word fall in my heart let there not be any unbelief like Abraham when he's an old man look like impossible how did he go to do that how does he go to be this way he never considered that he just received the word of God and went on believing it and God brought it to pass now uh God had said all these things so he knew it would be and it did he brought for of its kind now that he had transformed then all the seed into the living creature and creation that it was supposed to be it came up just as he said it would or he said Let It Be maybe hundreds and hundreds of years past but here we find it a beautiful Eden and the big birds of flying now Birds didn't have to die and the wolf and the lamb were feeding together and a lion a leopard and oxk and there's no no killing no death no sorrow and there was Adam and Eve Walking In the Garden of Eden every seed bringing for it never could do nothing else it never could do nothing else because God said let it be that way it had to be that way oh how I'd like to stop here just a minute to say see there's where we're facing yet the completion of that word now God said let there be and here it come up first perfectly just exactly now this tree can only bring forth that tree this tree can only bring forth this tree and Adam a Son of God can only bring forth a Son of God see you know what I mean it's everything after its kind so God could say well I'll just rest now did you notice it was very few words that God ever spoke actually from that time on he committed After the Fall To His prophets and they bring forth the word I see God rested he didn't have no more to do they just go to his headquarters knock on the door and say father what is it he sends it word down by he has a system and the way of doing those things let it be just and that's the way it was everything of his seed bringing forth of his kind now when everything looks so pretty and everything coming to pass just the what God had said now here comes that slimy dirty deceiver now that's what I'm trying to warn you all here about when you see God seed begin to take hold to grow watch out for that fellow coming in is as slick as he can be quote scripture just who wouldn't have it see watch him cuz he is a deceiver I'm going to call it instead of a a conformer being conformed he's a deformer deforming the things that's been conformed he's a deformer and he a deformer or a perverter or a corruptor of the original seed and the original program I see here like in your group here this morning you got a program you got a A Vision uh watch for that corruptor oh he'll be slly slick as he can be see but keep your vision keep holding to that now also we find out that when he come in he deformed that seed and he corrupted that seed by getting into the bedding grounds which is Eve and corrupting that seed with a corruptible seed before it could get there to corrupt that beautiful Garden of Eden where where Heaven only thing that that is is just the restoration where we are now we're on our road back to that original beginning of the creation of God back to the Garden of Eden again husband and wife without without any any sin or anything to live eternally but the the TR the not now he wants us to transform our minds by the renewing of transform be transformed by the renewing of our W Minds now Satan comes in and puts in a deforming to the word making it say something that it isn't that's what he did in the beginning and now notice this going to sound awful strange this morning to to people if I don't wait and base too much thought here before I get to my regular thought that I wanted to to get to you is this that the deformer came in and as God had tooked 6,000 years with the original word to bring forth every word of its kind and everything that he made would be God's Own word bringing forth of his kind now the deformer has took 6,000 years and to deform that word of God and what has he done he's brought himself to a new type of Eden Satan's Eden that's where we're living today how did he do that how could it happen the Striking part is how he did it that's where we have to what I'm here for to lay this down before you so that you can study of it now with the brothers here and so forth in the weeks to come that you can see how Satan did this and watch how cunning he is how Sly he is now he deformed these seeds now he could not destroy him he just deformed him now we realize that sin is righteousness perverted it says a a lie is a truth misrepresented see anything an adultery is a right act that God ordained just tuck in the wrong way see anything and death is a perversion of Life Death just takes see deforms life now he had 6,000 years to do it with his poison spray and how did he do it now this is the Striking part listen close now he did it by civilization that sounds strange but that's why I'm going to make a statement here that'll keep you guessing maybe for a few minutes I hope not but did you realize this I'm not trying to support ignorance but did you know that Civilization Science Education and the things that we cherish so great today is the very instrument of Satan even civilization civilization never come by God civilization come by Satan I'll prove that to you by the word just civilization is not of God for let me show you in this civilization the more civilized we get as we work through science we are always killing ourselves see and this civilization is built up to his Pinnacle now and we got death in this civilization we got sin in this civilization we got sickness in this civilization that can't be of God so God in the his great own great uh Kingdom it is to come we'll have a civilization but it will not be anything like this it won't be by science it'll be a faith civilization ation by the word see this scientific civilization we have is exactly Satan's trap and that's what he's killed the people with that's what he's killing us every day with that's how as we eat each day instead of living we die they have so perverted everything to even take so much of this and mix it with this and hybrid this and that that till it's a dying it's a dying race there no matter what you try to do you die you seen that picture last night of those Africans you know why they never had penicillin them people live longer than we do they don't even know they germs don't bother them see why German threw up his hand and surrender at see because he see he don't they don't why they haven't all been see we'll take science to figure out like a pen of cylinder something the place in us to to take this disease out and it tears down something else and makes a bedding ground for something else now he don't do that see now any many of you people come from farms anyone knows that a good healthy plant never needs to be sprayed it's it's got a repellent on it itself of life and a germ won't even get on it on a real on a real healthy plant it's this hot bed plant it's this hybrid plant you have to baby for instance some of you fellows here are westerners here look back to the time of the old Longhorn cow today you say you got a better beef with your with your her have you you haven't that old long hard cow not taken up for the old girl but she could she' win her here like a deer oh she was skinny and everything but she was Twi this Herford you pull a hay on him take his picture up to his tummy early to show his beef to the hawk and what is it you turn him loose out there he'd die he couldn't win it if he had to you have to feed him and everything else to take care of his baby him around he's a hybrid but a real Janu wine old Longhorn is turn him loose that's the way today with our Christians we got some many we have to soft soap to beg them put them make them a Deon in the church Pat him on the shoulder make him some great position in the church or if you don't he he won't he won't come in if you don't let this one do this and this one do that it's babying could you imagine genuine Christians being that they were rugged they were Burly could you imagine St Paul being that type of a Christian could you imagine St Peter being if you don't make me gentle overseer I don't know I might go join so and so they were rugged Man they were a man of Faith they live with God they walked with God as a man of few words they serve God day and night constantly you didn't have to spray them and baby them and offer them this that or the other they were man rugged they were genuine seeds not high breed in denominations a few of the methodists don't treat me right I with the Baptist the Baptist don't treat me right I go to the Pentecostals they don't treat me right I'll go back to the Catholics or whatever more see they it's a hybrid have to keep them sprayed yes doctor Reverend brother so and so that ain't Christian Christianity Christianity act ask no titles it asks no favors it only knows God it's Original Seed it loves God loves one another there's no spraying on them and babing them and patting them around and saying yes well this sister well I believe it's all right for her to have short hair this and not and and uh there's no such stuff as that let him get by with this it's it's rugged it's a gospel lay it out there let it fall where it will Christians love it must I be carried home to heaven on a flower bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas must I be patted on the back and this that and the other and baby I expect my place out you with the rugged I expect not come up there with no trophy scars at all I must fight if I must reain increase my courage Lord see let me stand like a Christian not to be a a hybrid plan had to be baby and petted and brought into something you're not brought in the Christian you're borned in it you become a new creature you're a seed of God that comes into the earth now now we find out that he sprayed this poison uh spray and that spray was a spray of modern understanding education science and civilization the very things that we cherish so much did you ever stop to think that our great enemy in the Natural Life Today among the Nations is communism what is a god of communism civilization and education sence that's right isn't it that's what they live on and thrive on is science scientific science is a god of science now if you just and with the POR and spray of this modern civilization science and education now let me prove to you that education and civilization come from the devil now let us turn back here just if you want you to Genesis 4th chapter all right now let's begin with the 16th verse of Genesis 44 here or Genesis um 4 Pardon Me Now notice Satan you people follow these tapes with our our brother here now you've heard me preach on the Serpent's Seed and that cannot be denied that was opened up in one of those Seven Seals it was hid now if children has come up under that kind see under that kind of teaching that's what their parents was they have the nature of the parents their denominations so forth they have to believe that they believe that because they're born of that parent but today we're not born under that parent our parent is a word and a word but say I was born under God too for that age but this is a climax age this is the age Beyond those denominations there had to come forth must come forth God ordained it so that there must come forth them Seven Seals must be open it was supposed to be done in this lady of CNA and I think Beyond any Shadow of Doubt not as we brag we have no brag only on Jesus Christ none of us we only brag on Jesus Christ but we are thankful with the for the privilege of knowing but any Beyond any Shadow of Doubt God has chos Us in this last days and has proven it by the signs in the heavens and in the earth and every one of them coming right straight back to the word to prove that it's so this age that we live in the message and how it is we're not a cult we're not a bunch of fanatics we are Servants of God that's been called by the Holy Ghost you'll have all kinds of names taged to you but that don't mean it so now remember Satan son was Cain I think you all been through all the tapes which I see your libraries out your now remember that Eve become pregnant by Satan and in the same day we got a case of at Tucson now that a woman if she becomes uh she lives with two men she can have have two different type of children we know that I know it in breeding dogs and things and so forth if it's right away so Satan that morning perhaps met this evil one which was the serpent not a reptile but a beast most subtle cunning smart of all of the Beast just under man and man is Beast himself and we're we're a mammal warm blooded animal and and Satan was the next link here this um serpent was the next thing to a man from a Jane stand between and and a japany now science is looking for that Missing Link and it's so hid by taking him down and even not a bll in him looks like a man see making him a reptile now we find now that this fell found Eve in the Garden of Eden this young woman that know no sin know not what her nakedness was and he knew he smart subtle wife and he told her that the seed but the the the fruit was pleasant and it was Desir and when he lived with her that morning then see then the afternoon she persuaded Adam to do the same thing telling him what it was and then Adam deliberately knowing he ought not have done it walked out with his wife and did this act which finally he would have come to it anyhow but see it had to be that way the wisdom of God because this then that displays his attribute to be a savior father healer you've heard me preach on that seat now if that hadn't been done he just let him out there on free moral agency to let him act he couldn't make them do it and then still be just but he could put them equal with him in free moral agency and then let them do it themselves and he knew they would do it and so then you see then when Adam Liv with she brought forth Twins and one of them was of Satan and one of them was of Adam which was of God Cain and Abel and that happens we got a case to on now that that a white woman lived with her husband one morning and that afternoon she lived with a negro and one of the the little boys the two little boys is born one of them is a little kinky headed negro and the other one is a a blond-headed kid real pretty and the the thing now she's trying to make the white father take care of both children and he said I'll take care of my own but not his that the Negro man take care of his own child so see it's true there's always twins that's the reason don't forget this little flock the church in the last days is going to be twins so close deceive the elected Matthew 24:24 see the church is going it's a Pentecostal move it's so much like the real thing till it would deceive the very elected if it was possible a little later on if I get the chance I want to explain what how that election comes see it go to deceive them because it's almost like the same thing see just two fathers that's all same mother same church same movement same thing the betting ground is the same for the word Falls but one of them like here is perverted you understand say Amen if you do see one of them is a perversion because it's a wrong Father which I will prove someday if God will let me that denomination is the mark of the beast see it's a wrong father it's stirring people to an organization instead of to the word see it's a wrong F it's a cane move when I go home this time I'm preaching on the subject the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end and Trail him right through the Bible and show how he heads up then and you all get that on the telephone to see if the Lord permits us to do it and now just watch how cunning that fell is how he's just exactly just what they're just like Judas and Jesus there both brothers in the tribe just like Esau and Jacob and and like the The Crow and the dove sitting on the same root and everything is a twin and uh and this uh great uh Warfare that we're in the enemy uses deception like he did to Eve oh God has said surely but but surely see see trying to reason it Beyond what God Said originally Thou shalt die he said yes God said that but surely see that's spray over but what God says God keeps he don't need any help from Satan he keeps it so don't ever be deceived by that now we notice then that it brought forth of its kind now in Genesis here we find out after the spring of this poison of knowledge now science is knowledge and all we hear is science signs signs signs great subject in school signs today a better automobile a better this a better home a better house a better this a better that what are we doing dying all the time create automobile we quit walking quit walking we return to blubber well we don't have man anymore we have jellyfish that's right and the woman all she does throw the clothes in it press the button there it is when your man you used to walk through the spring and pack water and chop wood and Bor over a k somewhere and fix your clothes like that and we're so soft if it do to kill us but we can't help it this is the age we're living in even science says now that little girls are coming into menopause young women between 20 and 25 years old I meet them right in the line that young man go through the middle age between 20 and 25 years old my mother my wife went through about 35 to 40 my mother went through from 45 to 50 see how the degenerating in this last days because why we're working more on S 150 years ago the only travel man had was by horse or by foot and now he goes by jet almost by thought see science has done it and that's of the devil now you say that right brother Brandon yes sir let's take Genesis now four and camee went out from the presence of the Lord now watch the first thing he done you tell me when you think we got enough here cuz IOP stop on this anywhere he went out from the presence of the Lord there he made his mistake and there's where you make that's what he did right he went up from the presence of the Lord and you say well Brother David there's a lot in that you know what I mean but the the picture that we want to to draw is is that God he he elected you and he chose you is is that what he said yeah and that he spoke it so it's got to transform into its kind right and and we then he said that all this civilization and and all this organizations and and all this world system of Science and education and and civilization he says it's all of the devil to deform us that's right in other words we get so caught up in it so worried about it so frustrated by it that that we get frustrated at the very PR process of our transformation you know that but you've you've got to go through that process of being changed and and he and and he changes Us by his word so you can't escape you can't escape the process of growing you can't escape the process of the deformer trying to discourage you and and and making life hard on you and and and trying to uh uh get the uh uh uh put a burden on you and make you carry a cross and I thought you know when when I lost that sight in my eye and you know the first thing you know Satan wanted to make it say oh you're being punished for your sins well you know all the things you looked on that you shouldn't have looked on you know all these things like you know and and and so and and I just stopped I says wait a minute the word said if I can do one thing for my salvation he died in vain my righteousness is his filthy rags I'm not going to be transformed by my works I'm not going to be transformed by my uh my my failures the only thing that's going to transform me is because he spoke it and if he spoke it it's got to come to pass and did you hear the prophet of God said oh if we could only see that and put our faith in that and not let the trans the transformation process discourage us and beat us down we we it's it's going to happen he's going to have a bride he's going to have an elected and that's what he wants to do is he doesn't want our results in there words we don't see our results in the civilization around us or the world around us we we don't see we can't say we can't try to measure ourselves our Christianity of how it appears in our in in our life in our civilization in our education so it's it's like trying to look on the outside to determine what's on the inside I'm getting on my Sunday message but I can't help it you understand we're not measured by the world around us we're measured by what's in in us that's why when he said pray he said pray to him who's in you within you so okay we don't look out we don't look out we look in we look into what's in our heart we look into what's in what what what's in what's our heart's desire to want more of God we don't look at out and say oh I mean there's there's all this perversion in this world and I see it and it bugs me and can you can you're going to spend your whole day saying oh I'm going to be a Christian when none of this world bothers me you I'm going to be a Christian when when you know I'm not drawn after this and I'm not drawn after that I'm going to be a Christian you can't measure Yourself by Al there you can only measure Yourself by one thing and that's your faith in what he said and you could look at yourself and you could look yourself in your mirror and you could see nothing but a failure you can see all kinds of discouraging aspects about your life but there's one thing you've got to know is that he said and I believe what he said there therefore what he said is going to come to pass now I may be in the process of transformation of change and I might be going through this and going through that and going through this mind battle and going through that mind battle I might be going through this physical battle and that physical battle I might be going through this financial battle and that Financial battle everything might be in dis array my world my being falling apart my bank accounts dwindling I don't don't have any job looking for you you want to know something that's not a measure of nothing the only thing that God measures You by is what he spoke of you in the beginning because that has got to come to pass thank you Jesus I like it when he said that man said he says I'm not what I I want to be and I'm not what I ought to be but I'm not what I used to be either he was in the process of transforming and and so what what happens is is we get locked in to trying to measure ourselves measure our Christianity measure oursel by our five senses emotionalism is good I like being emotional I want you to raise your hands I want you to praise God if you want to run run shout that that's all wonderful but it it let it be what it is but you are what you are because he said you was what you are Hallelujah so he said I'm going to have a bride amen well he didn't say one day snap she's perfect no what's the perfect part about it what is the perfect part of you the seed word that's in you that's right that's the perfect part of you what he said is the perfect part of you the word is the perfect part of you so you here we are living in a whole world that totally perverted now I'm going to measure Myself by a perverted World by perverted judgment by perverted standards by perverted morality and that's what he's trying to that's what he's saying the deform we go into keep listening the message God's got the power to transform you you don't have the power to transform you you don't have the power power to change he put the power in you in seed form and now he's going to guide you amen by preaching to you by giving you Revelation like I said it's wonderful to shout but he didn't build his church on that right that's right he built his church on opening the word of God to you not letting you look outside but letting you look inside right I there's something in me that amends the word of God now that makes me shout that makes me happy Revelation his life so he didn't build his church he didn't build his church he says I'm going to now build my church when they can look outside and look at their life and see works and and see this and see that the scribes and Pharisees had Greater Works than all of them the only difference that they had is they said Lord where else can we go you alone have the words of eternal life and then you begin to see just like he said in this tape you're not of this world you're living in it but you're not of it you're called to a complete completely different existence we can't start measuring ourselves by the church world we can't measure ourselves by by the different moves of the spirit of the rain falling on the unjust and and and the just right there's only one way that you can ever look inside of yourself and say is there something in me that amens every word of God and if that's there I am going to be transformed no matter how dark I am no matter how many troubles I have no matter how many struggles I have no matter how many failures I have that word will not failu that's what's perfect about me what's perfect about me is what that he spoke about me and he will transform me into that no matter what I have to come go through cuz he's got the power to transform and if we could just get our eyes off of this craziness that's all around us and and just just stop letting it have an effect on you you know you can't even comprehend where people are I don't need to it's all of the devil I've got the one thing I've got the word of God I've got the seals opened up I've had the son of man Ministry in our day we saw the very God of our Heaven come down and Veil himself in flesh and stand in this generation calling out to that bride and they heard his voice and my sheep have heard my voice and another they won't follow and and that's what you're attracted to that's what you Feast on that's what you follow it it's the word because you know that that word is going to transform you because he placed the power of transformation within you and and that's just such a press in my heart for us to learn to quit looking at the world around us there's no way you can judge yourself by the world you can't do it you're not even of this world you you can't even that's what he said renew your mind with the washing of the word of God okay re don't be conformed to this world but be transformed and that's what our desire is you say well brother M you don't know how much how how all the dumb things I've done don't matter don't matter dumb don't stop God unbelief don't stop God failure don't stop God because he said so he said so before you got here he said so he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life life he said I'll be with you even in you till the end of the world I will not leave you I will not forsake you but I will transform you if I started a work in you I'll perfect it till the end all the father hath given me will come and when did he start that work he started that work in the before there ever was a star in the sky and and he's trying to get us to to quit looking around and focus on what is spiritually transforming right now right now within us do you have a revelation of the transforming power of God that's going to transform you from whatever you are into what that he said you are going to be you say I don't know what it is that's the beauty of Revelation that's the beauty of Revelation something that's not known that's previously been hid and now is made known to you amen that's your life that's what the church is built on not the not the temporary Judgment of your Yourself by this perverted world that we live in but by your re interman response to the revelation of God's word and everyone's different and I thought that's why that was so beautiful about the girl in the wheelchair he said look at this sister everybody's prayed for her everybody's prayed for her she says she knows God's A Healer she believes that in other words he he was trying to say don't don't measure oh if she was a Believer or we have to have her healed or or or if if she doesn't raise up we don't have faith and he comes back and she says she's just serving her purpose yeah see we're we're we're blown away with thinking we've got to produce something we're blowed away with thinking if if I don't have a sign or I don't have a wonder if I don't have a move of the power you know where the move of the power was the move of the power is when he said let there be and even though it took thousands of years years it was can he said let there be about you can it might take 40 years it may take 50 years it might take hours in struggling it may take your deathbed but let me tell you one thing God's word does not return void and that's why we played this tape tonight CU I know that all those things that he said in there will not return void if you cast The Bread upon the waters it will bring forth life and we can have confidence in that but what we got to do is we got to shake ourselves away from the deformer because this world is trying to deform our thinking and we need to come back to the washing of the water of the word and the renewing of our mind I am elected I am chosen I am a part of this bride I am not of the world I am not part of this bride because I spoke in tongues I am not part of the Bride because I laid my hands on the sick and they'll do all these things we shall do if God permits but I'm not going to lay down those foundations again but I'm going to move on to Perfection can the Perfection is that God loved me he put my name on The Book of Life he will not fail me and he's revealed that to me can I'm hanging on to that and that'll get me through every dark hour that I ever go through why cuz he said so and I I I I just don't care you know Prophet God says Satan casted his vote against me God casted his vote for me now who am I going to believe who are you going to believe let me tell you don't believe your flesh believe the word because the word has the power to transform you into an overcomer and and so anyway maybe I'll come up with a different sermon Sunday but I I just saw the parallel between God's word and this world Amen there just two different things right we're not even of it so don't let our minds be of it the carnal mind is emanated with God but the spiritual mind don't don't let your flesh give you a carnal mind you have a weakness he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world Amen so don't get discouraged Church don't get down don't don't don't uh don't slack off press harder than you ever had to the things that you know you're right because if God before you who can be against you amen God bless you any brothers that want to uh come out this weekend and work there's lots of little things to do anyway you're welcome to go over and see the progress we've made and and you notice we have a door in in the side there well one day you'll be able to go through it amen there's another door I'm looking to go through amen the world calls it death I call it life amen amen and I told somebody he said you know if I don't go on the Rapture I'm going to go on the resurrection but one way or the other I'm going and you say and prophet of God said what difference does it make that's right that's right what difference does it make amen you say well why are you going cuz he said so is it because you repented no no well I was yet a sinner he died for me but what did he give me he gave me a revelation and just like Peter Lord where can we go th alone has the words of eternal life where else can we go but this message amen I I don't ever want to leave the voice of this messenger it'll get us through church it will get us through love the word love the tapes love this message love what God's done in this day he called you out by it he'll get you through by it
