[23:49] your hand
[23:51] and you've been faithful to
[23:54] finish the work
[23:55] father and we rejoice in that this
[23:58] evening we ask you to bless our
[24:00] communion service tonight
[24:02] in jesus precious name we pray
[24:05] amen
[24:07] amen if you have your bibles let's open
[24:09] just for a quick
[24:10] uh
[24:11] a reading
[24:12] of a scripture
[24:15] in the gospel of saint john
[24:17] and the very first chapter
[24:20] of john and we're just going to play
[24:22] like i said just 10 minutes of a tape
[24:24] tonight so
[24:26] we want to have some word
[24:28] with our
[24:29] evening service so
[24:31] in the gospel of saint john the first
[24:34] chapter
[24:35] it says in the beginning was the word
[24:38] and the word was with god
[24:41] and the word was god
[24:44] the same was in the beginning
[24:46] with god
[24:47] and all
[24:48] things were made by him
[24:51] and without him
[24:52] was not anything made that was made
[24:56] and in him was life
[24:58] and that life was the light of men
[25:02] and the light shineth in darkness
[25:05] and the darkness comprehended it
[25:08] not
[25:09] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[25:11] word to us in jesus precious name we
[25:14] pray
[25:15] amen god bless you
[25:17] you may be seated
[25:22] we're going to play just a little
[25:24] portion of the message tonight
[25:27] as we
[25:28] reviewed a little bit
[25:31] this morning
[25:32] as we
[25:33] uh
[25:34] have come down
[25:36] and
[25:39] brother and makes this statement and i
[25:41] want to point it out before we listen to
[25:44] it
[25:44] because he's going to talk about the
[25:46] abstract
[25:48] and
[25:49] there's a difference he's explaining
[25:51] between
[25:53] just a title d
[25:55] in an abstract deed which brings it all
[25:58] the way back
[25:59] to the original
[26:00] so it's kind of like in a way when you
[26:03] get saved you get the title deed
[26:05] of your
[26:07] salvation
[26:08] but
[26:09] when
[26:10] that quickening power comes
[26:13] that's the abstract to that title d
[26:16] so it's been taken back to the beginning
[26:19] so
[26:20] if you just put up there on the board
[26:22] brothers if you would
[26:26] a
[26:27] paragraph of 240
[26:30] and we just read this and then we will
[26:35] just point out how beautiful
[26:37] he explains
[26:38] he says
[26:40] now notice this quickening power
[26:43] zoe
[26:45] and uh we know that
[26:47] uh
[26:50] he i gave them eternal life eternal life
[26:53] comes from the word zoe
[26:55] which moves it through you
[26:58] and then quickens their even their minds
[27:02] so this quickening power zoe is god
[27:07] and it proves new he says
[27:10] the power of zoe
[27:12] bringing the word
[27:13] the mind that was in christ
[27:17] was in you
[27:19] then
[27:20] so just think that the mind that was in
[27:23] christ was in you then
[27:27] i'm trying to show you
[27:30] that
[27:31] you
[27:31] when you raised up so he's trying to
[27:35] show us when we raised up
[27:38] so we always are looking forward to a
[27:41] resurrection right
[27:43] but i mean this is such so beautiful he
[27:45] says but i'm going to show you when you
[27:48] raised up
[27:50] that's what i'm trying to show you
[27:52] you know because
[27:54] we're in this religious struggle but
[27:57] he's trying to take it beyond that and
[27:58] he says i want to show you something i
[28:00] want to show you when you got raised up
[28:03] when were you raised up
[28:06] now
[28:06] here we come how many years after the
[28:09] lord i guess
[28:13] 2020 years or something
[28:16] i guess if our calendars are right
[28:19] but he's going to say we raised up way
[28:21] before we got here
[28:24] beautiful
[28:27] okay and this is what he says i'm trying
[28:29] to show you that
[28:32] because i'm trying to show you that when
[28:34] you raised i'm trying to show you when
[28:37] you raised up
[28:38] when god raised jesus from the dead
[28:42] he raised up you
[28:45] also
[28:49] when god raised jesus from the dead he
[28:52] raised up you also
[28:55] and also quickened to life with him
[28:59] you are now quickened to life
[29:02] he said although
[29:04] then you were but an attribute in his
[29:07] thoughts but god saw
[29:10] all in him
[29:12] at the finish see
[29:15] when god looked down upon the body
[29:19] so what god saw
[29:22] what was in his mind the attribute he
[29:26] saw the finish of it
[29:28] so
[29:29] we don't see the finish of it
[29:32] you know we see the rough thing
[29:34] and the clay but god sees the finish
[29:38] remember michelangelo he had a vision in
[29:41] his mind and he worked towards that
[29:43] vision until it was
[29:45] perfected and then when it was so
[29:48] perfectly matched the image
[29:51] that he had he said speak
[29:54] he was so inspired and and that's what
[29:58] god is doing he knows what he's bringing
[30:01] forth
[30:02] and remember he's got the power to
[30:04] transform it
[30:06] so
[30:06] even though in our spirits we're still
[30:09] calling for it
[30:11] the reason we're calling for it it's a
[30:13] deep calling to a deed and so he will
[30:17] provide
[30:19] he will
[30:20] perform he will not fail
[30:24] he will not lose a one
[30:26] nothing can pluck you out of the palm of
[30:29] my hand and just listen to how beautiful
[30:32] this goes and then he'll make a
[30:34] statement in here that that jesus
[30:38] how he died as a man so let's just
[30:40] listen to this 10 minutes
[30:42] and then the brothers right towards the
[30:44] end of it they can prepare the communion
[30:46] we'll have communion and foot washing
[30:48] but just
[30:50] look
[30:51] here
[30:52] at how that he sees you
[30:55] and not how you see yourself
[30:58] and then you'll take courage god bless
[31:00] you as we listen to our messenger
[31:13] this quickening power is zoey
[31:16] bringing the word the mind that was in
[31:18] christ
[31:19] within you then
[31:21] i'm trying to show you
[31:23] that you when you
[31:25] um
[31:26] raised when god raised jesus from the
[31:28] dead he raised up you also
[31:31] and also quickens your life with him you
[31:35] are now quick in the life although ben
[31:37] you were but an attribute in his
[31:39] thoughts
[31:40] but god has saw all in him at the finish
[31:45] see when god looked down upon the body
[31:47] the spirit left him in the garden to get
[31:48] something he had to die a man remember
[31:51] friends he didn't have to do that
[31:54] that was god
[31:56] god anointed that flesh which is human
[31:58] pledge and he didn't if peter went up
[32:01] there as god he never died that kind of
[32:03] death didn't kill god
[32:05] but he didn't have to do it but remember
[32:08] he
[32:09] went there
[32:10] with you in him
[32:13] see
[32:15] god had never separated the bride
[32:18] from the groom yet
[32:20] so when god looked down upon the body of
[32:23] christ he saw both male and female
[32:26] it was all redeemed that one body
[32:30] see
[32:31] they are one
[32:33] same same word
[32:35] the same word spoke of the groove speaks
[32:37] to the bride
[32:38] well how can the bride come and fail to
[32:41] manifest everything was promised of him
[32:43] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[32:44] the bride
[32:46] but when he did everything even to prove
[32:47] it by raising himself up from the dead
[32:50] afterwards
[32:51] then don't the bride have to do the same
[32:53] thing has to be exactly what the word
[32:55] said should be in these last days
[32:58] don't you have to return to the military
[32:59] don't you have to be manifested like
[33:01] wasn't the days of sodom don't the world
[33:03] have to be just exactly like it is
[33:05] isn't these things a perfect
[33:06] identification of the word of god made
[33:09] known to us
[33:10] my friends
[33:11] i know i'm keeping a long time 15
[33:13] minutes just for dinner but maybe i'll
[33:14] get sued by them but notice looking here
[33:17] what a perfect thing it is i don't know
[33:19] when to see he can't see look notice
[33:21] this but god foresaw
[33:24] the bride
[33:26] in the groom
[33:29] hallelujah
[33:31] see to save his wife like adam
[33:34] he had to go with her
[33:36] i didn't know what he was doing eve
[33:38] didn't know what she was doing
[33:40] but adam walked out with his wife
[33:42] see and jesus took his wife's place
[33:47] and became sin for her remember he
[33:50] became you he stood your punishment
[33:53] that you might stand in his place he
[33:56] stood in your place
[33:57] that you might stand in his place
[34:00] what a love
[34:02] what a fellowship how can we do not how
[34:04] can we do anything but love him friends
[34:06] uh to stay on our hours but let's move
[34:08] on with it
[34:10] like
[34:11] uh the pentecostal experience today and
[34:14] the coming of the holy ghost in this
[34:16] last days as promised is like the
[34:19] abstract to a title these days
[34:22] see
[34:23] now you can get a title
[34:25] sure
[34:26] you can get a title to a place but
[34:28] that's still gonna say it's yours
[34:30] no sir somebody way back energy come in
[34:33] and put a claim on it
[34:34] but when you get an abstract
[34:38] that shows that everything is ever
[34:40] against it is struck off
[34:43] coming back from the foundation is that
[34:44] right
[34:45] and when a man
[34:47] has said that he believes the word
[34:50] and then when the holy spirit comes it
[34:53] is the abstract to the title
[34:56] and that gives you permission when you
[34:58] have that abstract that every bit of
[35:00] that belongs to you and everything's on
[35:02] it belongs to you
[35:04] amen
[35:07] and that gives us the abstract when the
[35:10] holy ghost comes upon this title knee
[35:13] that god saw back on her for the
[35:16] foundation of the world and put a name
[35:17] on the book of life but was born to a
[35:19] man and woman and subject to sin and
[35:21] guilty of sin
[35:23] but when i believed on it i received the
[35:26] deed but when the holy ghost come it was
[35:29] the abstract
[35:31] that everything against me whether my
[35:33] mother done it my father done it my
[35:35] grandmother done it like a little
[35:37] epileptic childhood praying for a few
[35:38] minutes ago to come to you from the
[35:40] grandparents therefore if she fell down
[35:43] and upon the time i said but when the
[35:45] abstract has come
[35:47] it struck off omitted everything
[35:51] i'm uh
[35:52] abstract
[35:56] foreign and as sure as the spirit that

[36:58] oh an abstract deed do you realize what
[37:01] that means
[37:03] you realize what that means
[37:13] coming here he says you realize that
[37:15] what that means there is nothing can
[37:17] take it away from you
[37:20] i i didn't i'm sorry brothers i didn't
[37:22] mean to
[37:23] shut you off amen i am a holder amen
[37:27] what a deed
[37:28] i have now
[37:30] cashed in on my beneficiary of his death
[37:33] burial and resurrection
[37:35] he became me that i might become him
[37:38] now he became a sinner that i might
[37:40] become a son amen and hold the abstract
[37:44] deed for these signs shall follow them
[37:47] that believe see the abstract deed but
[37:51] you know over here in paragraph of the
[37:54] brothers go
[37:55] prepare for communion
[37:57] he said over here in paragraph
[38:01] 243 i believe and when a man has said
[38:06] that he believes the word
[38:08] and then when the holy spirit comes
[38:11] it's the abstract to the title
[38:15] and that gives you permission
[38:17] when you have the abstract that every
[38:20] bit that
[38:22] every bit of that belongs to you
[38:25] and everything on it belongs to you amen
[38:29] and gives us the abstract
[38:32] when the holy ghost comes
[38:35] upon this title deed now when did god
[38:39] see that title deed
[38:41] to this title deed that god saw back
[38:44] yonder before the foundations of the
[38:48] world and put its name on the book of
[38:52] life
[38:54] he said though you come through your
[38:56] parents or whatever
[38:57] okay if it's it's and that's what we're
[39:00] communing with tonight
[39:03] we're communing
[39:04] with
[39:05] the understanding i just i just feel
[39:09] kind of so bad for people that are out
[39:11] in
[39:12] in the nominal church world because
[39:16] they they so miss
[39:18] uh
[39:19] the the gospel from the standpoint
[39:22] they they feel that i've got to believe
[39:24] and i've got to do this and i've got to
[39:27] do that and then he said but nobody can
[39:29] come unto me unless the father draws
[39:32] them
[39:33] and he says i've come to redeem my own
[39:36] my sheep know our voice what we've done
[39:39] is we've found ourselves in a world that
[39:42] we don't belong in
[39:45] and that's why we have so much trouble
[39:48] we're in the world
[39:50] but we're not
[39:51] of the world
[39:53] and now he's bringing us back through
[39:56] the spark of the revelation
[39:59] through the sheep offering he's bringing
[40:02] us back all the way back to the
[40:04] beginning of our inheritance
[40:08] and our existence and
[40:10] what we really had title to
[40:13] in the beginning
[40:15] so we're going back i loved how brother
[40:17] branham says it he says we're going back
[40:20] to eden
[40:21] back to eden
[40:23] exactly that's what it is and so if it's
[40:26] just beautiful understanding that
[40:29] along with
[40:32] this
[40:33] great message
[40:35] along with this great move of the spirit
[40:39] of god
[40:40] is him
[40:43] bringing to you
[40:45] the understanding
[40:47] of how secure
[40:49] you are in him from the beginning
[40:53] and that's just so beautiful
[40:56] i know we worry sometimes because we
[40:58] look at ourselves and
[41:00] and we hear
[41:01] it
[41:02] the
[41:03] talk about the holy spirit and we
[41:05] question ourselves whether we have the
[41:08] holy spirit or not but if you're
[41:10] entitled to that deed if he gave you the
[41:14] deed he will give you the abstract
[41:17] and he makes the statement he says you
[41:20] just go ahead and be baptized and he
[41:23] said watch the spirit of god come down
[41:25] and pick you up
[41:26] and put you where you belong so so you
[41:30] know fear not little flock
[41:32] it's the father's good pleasure
[41:35] to give you the kingdom and all things
[41:38] that he does
[41:39] he does well so as we have communion
[41:43] now we'll uh oh let's stand and open our
[41:46] bibles
[41:56] and i thought communion falls such in
[41:59] line with the scriptures
[42:01] because the scripture says that first he
[42:03] took the bread
[42:05] which is the word
[42:07] and then he took the wine which was the
[42:10] stimulation of revelation so like one
[42:14] represents the word and the other
[42:16] represents the quickening power
[42:18] and those two coming together puts you
[42:21] in communion with the lord for i have
[42:24] received of the lord that which i also
[42:27] delivered unto you
[42:29] that the lord jesus the same night in
[42:31] which he was betrayed took bread
[42:34] and when he had given thanks he break it
[42:36] and said take heat
[42:38] this is my body which is broken for you
[42:42] this do in remembrance of me
[42:45] and after the same manner also he took
[42:47] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[42:50] cup is the new testament
[42:53] in my blood this do ye as often as you
[42:56] drink it in remembrance of me
[42:59] for as often as you eat this bread and
[43:01] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[43:03] death till he come
[43:06] wherefore whosoever shall eateth this
[43:08] bread and drinketh this cup of the lord
[43:10] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[43:14] and blood of the lord but let a man
[43:17] examine himself and so let him eat of
[43:19] that bread and drink of that cup
[43:22] for he that eateth and drinketh
[43:24] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[43:27] to himself
[43:28] not discerning the lord's body
[43:31] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[43:34] among you and many sleep
[43:36] for if we would judge ourselves we
[43:39] should not be judged
[43:40] but when we are judged we are chastened
[43:43] of the lord
[43:44] that we should not be condemned with the
[43:47] world
[43:48] wherefore my brethren when you come
[43:49] together to eat carry one for another if
[43:53] any man hunger let him eat at home that
[43:56] you come not together unto condemnation
[43:59] and the rest will i set in order when i
[44:02] come
[44:03] amen
[44:12] let us all pray together
[44:14] our gracious heavenly father
[44:16] lord we have the bread
[44:19] unleavened bread that represents being
[44:22] not mixed with anything
[44:25] for a little 11 leaveneth the whole lung
[44:28] and father we realize that this is
[44:32] life
[44:33] and that you you are the word and the
[44:36] word is meat indeed
[44:38] father it makes us grow into the statue
[44:40] of a perfect man
[44:42] and we take this communion knowing
[44:45] and remembered of the great price that
[44:47] you died
[44:48] father
[44:49] our messenger just told us you died the
[44:52] man
[44:53] you didn't have to do it
[44:55] but you did it for us
[44:57] and we fellowship with this father
[44:59] knowing that your great purpose is to
[45:01] bring us back to what we were supposed
[45:03] to be
[45:04] in the very beginning when our hearts
[45:07] are thrilled
[45:08] that our names are on that great hook
[45:11] and a father of this
[45:13] wine this cup line
[45:16] that represents your
[45:18] blood father the life
[45:22] that was in the body
[45:24] return back upon the believer
[45:26] father annoying that word and bring it
[45:29] to a resurrected
[45:32] christian
[45:33] a new creation
[45:36] in christ jesus

[45:42] work that you're doing the great
[45:45] deliverance nature performing in us the
[45:48] great coming forth father of who that we
