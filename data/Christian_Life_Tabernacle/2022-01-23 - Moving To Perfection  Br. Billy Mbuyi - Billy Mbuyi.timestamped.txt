[13:51] amen we're going to invite brother mike
[13:52] would come
[13:53] with our psalm reading this morning i
[13:55] just want to welcome you in the house of
[13:57] the lord and
[13:58] excited to hear from the lord today and
[14:00] give them praise and worship and
[14:02] just give them all the adoration we can
[14:04] together as a body amen
[14:18] good morning
[14:21] you know probably without question the
[14:24] most familiar
[14:26] psalm if not the most familiar chapter
[14:30] in the book of the bible is the 23rd
[14:32] psalm
[14:34] you know it
[14:35] used to be that you could ask any random
[14:38] person on the street
[14:40] what the 23rd psalm was and they could
[14:43] seem quoted from memory from their days
[14:45] in
[14:46] sunday school or whatever might be the
[14:48] case maybe not so much anymore
[14:51] but you know it's still
[14:52] arguably probably the most well-known
[14:56] scripture in the entire bible in pop
[14:58] culture and
[14:59] denomination probably there's hundreds
[15:01] of churches that stand up every morning
[15:03] and read the psalm the 23rd psalm
[15:06] together
[15:08] you know certainly
[15:10] any of us could probably quote that from
[15:12] memory
[15:13] but you know as believers i wonder if we
[15:16] recognize the significance of the
[15:18] statement that's being made
[15:20] in psalm 23.
[15:23] you know the very first verse
[15:26] begins with the phrase the lord is my
[15:28] shepherd
[15:30] and the whole rest of the chapter
[15:34] lists the effects
[15:37] the benefits
[15:38] of him being your shepherd
[15:42] you know but the thing is is that though
[15:44] it's quoted by everyone
[15:47] this chapter isn't for everyone
[15:52] you know all the benefits all the
[15:53] comforting statements everything that
[15:55] might be offered as a a prayer of
[15:58] comfort or words of encouragement or
[16:01] assurance
[16:02] if you don't first
[16:05] know the shepherd
[16:07] none of the other verses
[16:10] apply
[16:13] you know and if you're not experiencing
[16:17] the things that psalm 23 describes
[16:21] you could ask then
[16:23] who is your shepherd
[16:25] because if he's your shepherd these are
[16:27] the things
[16:29] that are attributes of his
[16:32] work
[16:34] but you can't benefit from the
[16:36] attributes of his work unless he's your
[16:38] shepherd
[16:41] you know isaiah 53 6
[16:44] describes the human race
[16:47] as a group of wandering sheep
[16:50] it says all we like sheep have gone
[16:52] astray
[16:54] we have turned everyone to his own way
[16:59] and outside the presence
[17:01] of a shepherd
[17:04] and entrusting ourselves to that
[17:06] shepherd
[17:08] we're just wandering through life
[17:11] trying to find our way
[17:15] especially in a very confusing age
[17:18] in matthew 9 36
[17:20] when jesus was here
[17:24] you know he looked out at
[17:25] the multitudes and it says in matthew 9
[17:28] 36 it says and when he saw the
[17:30] multitudes
[17:32] he was moved with compassion on them
[17:35] because they fainted
[17:37] and were scattered abroad
[17:39] as sheep
[17:40] having no shepherd
[17:42] so they were faint they were weary they
[17:44] were scattering they were wandering
[17:46] because they did not have
[17:49] the shepherd
[17:52] you know john 10 that entire chapter
[17:54] speaks of a shepherd
[17:57] it says in verse 14 i am the good
[18:00] shepherd
[18:02] and know my
[18:04] sheep
[18:05] and am known of mine
[18:09] as the father knoweth me even so
[18:12] know i the father and i lay down my life
[18:14] for the sheep
[18:16] you know not everyone who's a sheep has
[18:18] him
[18:19] for their shepherd
[18:20] there are those that are his
[18:23] sheep
[18:24] and that's who the 23rd psalm
[18:26] speaks of
[18:29] you know i wonder if we read psalm 23
[18:32] this morning
[18:34] if you just look at that through the
[18:35] lens of
[18:37] he is my shepherd
[18:40] and i pray that he is
[18:42] otherwise you're just a wandering sheep
[18:45] you know the good
[18:47] shepherd says in john 14 16 i will pray
[18:51] the father
[18:52] and he shall give you another comforter
[18:54] that he may abide with you forever
[18:58] even the spirit of truth
[19:00] and then down in verse 26 6 it says but
[19:02] the comforter
[19:04] which is the holy ghost
[19:06] whom the father will send in my name
[19:10] he shall teach you
[19:12] all things
[19:14] and bring all things to your remembrance
[19:16] whatsoever i have said unto you do you
[19:18] see the shepherd
[19:20] notice he said comforter
[19:22] as we'll read in psalm 23 thy rod and
[19:24] thy staff they comfort
[19:27] me
[19:31] you know you look even at verse 1
[19:33] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[19:35] you know there's
[19:36] scriptures that speak about what that
[19:38] means psalm 84 11 no good thing will he
[19:42] withhold from them that walk uprightly
[19:46] psalm 34 10 they that seek the lord
[19:48] shall not want
[19:50] any good thing
[19:52] see that it's not with this shepherd
[19:54] it's not like all of a sudden you're
[19:55] showered with things
[19:57] and you no longer have want
[20:00] but he changes what you want
[20:03] and you're
[20:04] satisfied your want changes
[20:08] you look in psalm verse 2 he maketh me
[20:11] to lie down in green pastures he leadeth
[20:13] me beside the still waters not just any
[20:16] pasture
[20:18] you know it says in psalm 95 7 for he is
[20:21] our god and we are the people of
[20:24] his pasture
[20:26] and the sheep of his hand
[20:29] it says in psalm 103 know ye that the
[20:31] lord he is god it is he that hath made
[20:34] us and not we ourselves
[20:36] we are his people and the sheep of
[20:39] his pasture
[20:41] you know a shepherd
[20:43] is known by the pasture his sheep are in
[20:47] oh that pasture belongs to so and so so
[20:50] that's
[20:52] his sheep
[20:53] and the sheep are known by the pasture
[20:56] they're feeding it
[20:58] you see psalm 23 is only four
[21:01] a specific kind of sheep
[21:03] who have him
[21:05] as their shepherd
[21:06] you know we could go on and on and
[21:08] looking through that but you know i
[21:09] think the important thing is is to make
[21:12] sure
[21:13] that he is your shepherd and even
[21:17] it happens to all of us you go about
[21:19] your daily life and you find yourself
[21:20] struggling with a decision or a
[21:23] circumstance or whatnot if psalm 23
[21:27] isn't applying to your circumstance you
[21:29] might check and see if you are allowing
[21:31] the shepherd
[21:33] to be your guide
[21:36] you know as we
[21:39] read psalm 23 this morning just
[21:42] be mindful of john 10 it says and when
[21:44] he putteth forth his own sheep on
[21:46] someone else's
[21:48] he goeth before them
[21:50] he prepared the table before them
[21:54] and the sheep follow him
[21:56] for they know his voice
[21:58] and a stranger will they not follow
[22:01] but will flee from him
[22:03] for they know not the voice of strangers
[22:06] i don't know about you but i am grateful
[22:08] that there's a shepherd in this day and
[22:10] age
[22:11] i don't know how you could find your way
[22:14] through all the voices and all the chaos
[22:16] and all the influences if there wasn't
[22:18] some superseding shepherd voice
[22:21] that a certain type of sheep
[22:24] could follow
[22:26] so i hope as we read this to this
[22:28] morning you know psalm 23 will have a
[22:30] little bit of significance the lord is
[22:33] my shepherd
[22:34] amen let's read that together starting
[22:37] in verse 1. the lord is my shepherd i
[22:40] shall not want he maketh me to lie down
[22:44] in green pastures he leadeth me beside
[22:47] the still waters he restoreth my soul he
[22:50] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[22:53] for his name's sake yea though i walk
[22:56] through the valley of the shadow of
[22:57] death i will fear no evil for thou art
[23:00] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[23:03] comfort me thou preparest the table
[23:05] before me in the presence of mine
[23:07] enemies thou anoinest my head with oil
[23:10] my cup runeth over
[23:12] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[23:15] me all the days of my life and i will
[23:17] dwell in the house of the lord forever
[23:27] may god bless you you have your seats

[58:41] again everyone in the house of god all
[58:43] our visitors amen greetings from our
[58:45] pastor brother david i spoke with them
[58:47] last night
[58:48] he's doing well and it's doing some work
[58:50] around the
[58:53] house the mom's house and trying to get
[58:56] all the things taken care of him and
[58:58] amen let's open our bibles in matthew
[59:01] chapter five
[59:15] matthew chapter 5 let's go to verse
[59:18] 40.
[59:23] it says
[59:25] and the if any man will sue thee
[59:28] at the law
[59:30] and take away that court
[59:32] let him have that clock also
[59:36] and whosoever shall compel thee to go a
[59:38] mile
[59:39] go with him twin
[59:42] it says
[59:44] give to him that asked thee
[59:46] and
[59:48] from him
[59:49] that would borrow
[59:50] of thee turn out it says turn not
[59:54] thou away
[59:57] as he have heard
[59:59] that it has been said
[1:00:01] thou shall love thy neighbor and hate
[1:00:03] thine enemy but i say unto you love your
[1:00:06] enemies
[1:00:08] bless them that curse you
[1:00:10] do good to them that hate you and pray
[1:00:12] for them that despitefully use you
[1:00:15] and persecut and despitefully use you
[1:00:18] and persecute you that ye may be the
[1:00:20] children of your father which is in
[1:00:23] heaven
[1:00:24] for he maketh
[1:00:26] his son to rise
[1:00:28] on the evil and on the good and sendeth
[1:00:31] rain on the just and the unjust
[1:00:35] for if you love them which love you what
[1:00:38] reward have ye
[1:00:39] i want you to think about
[1:00:42] the the
[1:00:43] the the shift or the change
[1:00:47] that is bringing its disciple to
[1:00:50] of what way they've known and where they
[1:00:52] going
[1:00:53] and and and it says uh for ye love them
[1:00:57] which love you what what reward have ye
[1:01:00] do not even the publican
[1:01:02] uh do the
[1:01:04] the same
[1:01:05] and if you salute your brethren only
[1:01:08] what what do ye more than others
[1:01:12] do not even republican so
[1:01:14] be therefore perfect
[1:01:17] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:01:20] is perfect
[1:01:21] let's also turn in first corinthians 13
[1:01:26] verse 9.
[1:01:36] it says for we know in part and we
[1:01:40] prophesy in part
[1:01:43] but when now which is perfect is come
[1:01:46] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:01:49] away with
[1:01:50] in fact
[1:01:51] this is
[1:01:52] the interpretation of the scripture we
[1:01:54] just read above
[1:01:56] they did it in part that's what they
[1:01:58] were taught
[1:01:59] but but when christ came
[1:02:02] he showed him a better way to do it he
[1:02:05] showed him a more excellent way for them
[1:02:07] to approach it
[1:02:08] he says when us when i was a child i
[1:02:11] speak as a child i understood as a child
[1:02:14] i thought as a child but when i became a
[1:02:17] man i put away childish things for now
[1:02:20] we see through a glass darkly but then
[1:02:24] face to face now i know in part but then
[1:02:27] shall i know even as i am known
[1:02:30] i am also
[1:02:31] i am known
[1:02:32] and now abideth faith hope and charity
[1:02:36] these it says these three but the
[1:02:39] greatest of these is charity you may
[1:02:42] have your seats man let's also turn one
[1:02:44] more scripture before you close your
[1:02:46] bible
[1:02:48] actually two more
[1:02:50] hebrews chapter 6
[1:02:52] we're going to start from verse 1. it
[1:02:54] says
[1:02:56] therefore it says
[1:03:00] it says therefore leaving the principle
[1:03:02] of the doctrine of christ
[1:03:04] let us go unto perfection
[1:03:07] not laying again the foundation
[1:03:09] of of repentance from dead works
[1:03:13] and of faith towards god
[1:03:15] of the doctrine of baptism
[1:03:18] or of laying on our hands and of the
[1:03:20] resurrection of the dead and eternal
[1:03:22] judgment
[1:03:23] this will this will
[1:03:26] this will
[1:03:28] we do if god permits
[1:03:30] in matthew 11 and chap
[1:03:34] chapter 11 and verse 2 he writes it says
[1:03:38] now when john had heard in the prison
[1:03:41] the works of christ he sent the two of
[1:03:44] his disciples
[1:03:45] and said unto him it says although and
[1:03:48] i'll pastor read the scripture a couple
[1:03:50] of weeks ago and we just want to
[1:03:52] reference it again it says they said
[1:03:54] unto him
[1:03:55] thou he that should come
[1:03:58] or do we look to another
[1:04:00] jesus answered and said unto him
[1:04:03] go and show john again those things
[1:04:06] which ye have heard and seen
[1:04:09] and and he kind of
[1:04:12] brings into light the things which i
[1:04:14] have heard in sin it says the blind
[1:04:15] received the sight the lame walk
[1:04:18] the lepers are cleansed
[1:04:20] the death the death here
[1:04:23] the dead are raised up and the poor
[1:04:26] have the gospel preached to them
[1:04:28] in other words what what jesus was doing
[1:04:31] here he was basically
[1:04:33] instead of answering john and saying go
[1:04:36] tell him yes that's it no he took the
[1:04:38] manifestation of the word
[1:04:40] and he brought it back to john which was
[1:04:43] the interpretation of the scripture that
[1:04:44] was given
[1:04:46] he took the manifestation the things
[1:04:48] which have seen
[1:04:49] the things which have heard what are you
[1:04:51] seeing now what are you hearing now he
[1:04:54] told them to go and tell john about
[1:04:56] those things because he knew that was
[1:04:58] the confirmation of the things of the
[1:05:00] promise that they were waiting for
[1:05:03] this morning just for a few minutes i
[1:05:05] want to speak on moving to perfection
[1:05:08] moving to perfection
[1:05:11] as we just read
[1:05:14] there are many things that we come
[1:05:16] across in the bible
[1:05:18] and and the things even in our natural
[1:05:21] realm
[1:05:23] it's it's hard to
[1:05:25] the things of god are not to be
[1:05:27] interpreted by men's mind we understand
[1:05:30] that
[1:05:31] we
[1:05:32] in fact the scripture tells us that
[1:05:35] that the things of god are foolish to
[1:05:36] men and the things of man are foolish to
[1:05:38] god
[1:05:40] god's thinking and men's thinking are
[1:05:41] not made to walk together
[1:05:44] in the scripture tells us that carnal
[1:05:45] mind is enmity against god
[1:05:48] why because of the way we've been
[1:05:50] trained to think the way we've been
[1:05:52] brought up everything about us you know
[1:05:55] i was thinking
[1:05:57] we we think about fairness you say
[1:06:00] you have to be fair and and yet you go
[1:06:03] in the scripture and the scripture says
[1:06:05] that uh jacob if i love an eso if i hate
[1:06:08] it
[1:06:09] and one will hear such a thing and said
[1:06:12] uh before the children have we even done
[1:06:14] any good or uh or evil but the purpose
[1:06:17] for election of god may be fulfilled one
[1:06:20] will look and say how can he he didn't
[1:06:22] even do anything
[1:06:24] in fact if you were to put the two
[1:06:26] together you will put jacob and you will
[1:06:28] put esau it seems like israel was the
[1:06:31] more acceptable son
[1:06:33] it seems like esau was the more
[1:06:35] a son who wanted to do good who took
[1:06:37] care and issa who was a cheister
[1:06:40] jacob as a chaisto was the one that god
[1:06:43] chose and we find the premises of god
[1:06:46] choosing was the fact that that that
[1:06:48] jacob regarded the birthright as the
[1:06:51] most important thing and god looked at
[1:06:53] it as righteousness to him so we see
[1:06:56] what we call justice or what we call a
[1:06:59] fairness within the saints of a human
[1:07:02] mind sometimes running contradiction
[1:07:04] with what the scripture tells us about
[1:07:06] those things and we think fairness it
[1:07:09] means fair to all and everybody
[1:07:11] receiving equal everybody being at the
[1:07:14] same then that's fairness but we fail to
[1:07:16] realize when we come to god god is not
[1:07:19] to be compared with our carnal mind
[1:07:22] when we say god is just it doesn't mean
[1:07:25] we have some form of understanding of
[1:07:28] justice somewhere where we put god on
[1:07:30] one scale and our understanding of
[1:07:32] justice on the other scale and way god
[1:07:35] to say whether god is just or not no
[1:07:38] when we say god justice is god himself
[1:07:42] righteousness is god himself truth is
[1:07:46] god himself is not to be compared with
[1:07:49] another but he himself is those things
[1:07:52] he himself is the very reflection of
[1:07:55] those things so when we say the truth
[1:07:59] we don't take it and compare well truth
[1:08:01] means it has to be equal to this it has
[1:08:04] to match with this it has to match with
[1:08:06] that then that's true no if he came out
[1:08:08] of the mouth of god that's truth
[1:08:12] if he came out of god it's righteous
[1:08:15] whatever he says is right and whatever
[1:08:18] he thinks is true oh i tell you whatever
[1:08:22] he thinks he brings it to pass how many
[1:08:24] times we have vain thoughts within our
[1:08:26] mind we'll think about this and and then
[1:08:29] jump on and think about the other and
[1:08:31] turn our minds and think about in other
[1:08:33] things and everything but we realize
[1:08:35] that the mind of god the moment he's
[1:08:37] become a mind and spoken that which he
[1:08:40] has spoken will come to pass so
[1:08:42] therefore we we when we come to the
[1:08:44] bible it's important that we come to the
[1:08:47] understanding that when we read these
[1:08:49] things that he has said about us when we
[1:08:52] read these things that he has said in
[1:08:53] the scripture that's the righteousness
[1:08:56] of god and there's nothing that can
[1:08:58] change it
[1:08:59] anything that's built outside of this
[1:09:01] foundation of god will fail anything
[1:09:04] that's built up on this understanding
[1:09:07] that god is establishing will not stand
[1:09:10] so if we come here we say oh he looked
[1:09:13] at the scripture says when lucifer's sin
[1:09:15] when iniquity was found within his heart
[1:09:18] god cast him from heaven down
[1:09:20] the scripture tells us but yet when adam
[1:09:23] sinned
[1:09:24] the scripture says god didn't apply the
[1:09:26] same thing
[1:09:27] he come and he in fact he provided a
[1:09:30] lamb and he provided a sacrifice to
[1:09:32] redeem this one one can look and say
[1:09:34] that's not fairness
[1:09:38] that's the carnal mind but to god that's
[1:09:40] fairness that is fairness why because
[1:09:43] what he does is true what he does he
[1:09:46] cannot be compared with some
[1:09:48] understandings of man with what we see
[1:09:51] out there where everyone has his own
[1:09:53] definition about what's supposed to be
[1:09:55] right what's supposed to be just and
[1:09:57] everything and that's why the whole
[1:09:59] world is collapsing why because it's
[1:10:01] built upon the understanding of man that
[1:10:04] changes every minute
[1:10:07] now as we read the scripture here
[1:10:10] in matthew chapter 5
[1:10:12] it says be imperfect even as your father
[1:10:15] which is in heaven is perfect now he he
[1:10:18] he just told them what they should do
[1:10:21] and he just
[1:10:22] uh uh i told them in matthew
[1:10:24] uh uh uh
[1:10:26] in matthew and here he was and he was
[1:10:28] telling them i'm sorry matthew 40 here
[1:10:32] is telling them what they should do he
[1:10:33] said don't just don't just love the one
[1:10:36] that love you don't just do good to the
[1:10:38] one that loves you don't just do this
[1:10:40] because that's what the public can also
[1:10:42] are doing he's trying to establish the
[1:10:45] difference between the children of the
[1:10:47] kingdom and the children of the world
[1:10:50] he's trying to bring apart and bring
[1:10:52] them to a place to an understanding
[1:10:54] where they need to know that they were
[1:10:56] not made to be like the others that were
[1:10:59] made to be different that they were made
[1:11:01] to be an extension of what god's
[1:11:04] thinking was they were meant to be an
[1:11:06] extension of god's love for the people
[1:11:08] that were made to be exactly like their
[1:11:11] father was and i want to say this here
[1:11:13] it says be perfect isn't as your father
[1:11:16] in heaven is perfect i want to say this
[1:11:19] there could never be a call to
[1:11:20] perfection unless there was something
[1:11:23] that was provided in order for you to be
[1:11:25] perfect
[1:11:26] you in other words you can ask the dog
[1:11:29] to lay an egg because it's not within
[1:11:31] the nature of a dog it's a mammal that
[1:11:33] can't produce that but you can ask that
[1:11:36] to a chicken or you can ask that to a
[1:11:38] bird but therefore when god comes and he
[1:11:41] says be perfect it's because you the
[1:11:44] scripture says that you were once the
[1:11:46] children of unrighteousness you were
[1:11:48] somewhat the same as the world you as he
[1:11:51] quickened he's taken you out of the
[1:11:53] world and he's bringing you and he
[1:11:55] brought you and he give you the new
[1:11:57] birth so you can become the son of
[1:12:00] righteousness and therefore when he says
[1:12:02] be imperfect it's because he knows
[1:12:04] within you he has put the potential for
[1:12:07] perfection
[1:12:11] and and i want to say this this morning
[1:12:13] because it's very important when the
[1:12:15] scripture says be perfect as your father
[1:12:18] in heaven is perfect is directly
[1:12:21] connecting you to god
[1:12:23] it's a direct link from you your birth
[1:12:26] you i want to say this your birth is not
[1:12:28] the the birth that your parents brought
[1:12:31] you here on earth and who your parents
[1:12:33] were naturally that's not the birth that
[1:12:36] i'm talking about every one of us had
[1:12:38] that kind of birth but this breath that
[1:12:40] i'm talking about is the birth that he
[1:12:42] the lord himself has come and has
[1:12:45] changed you from what you were he's
[1:12:47] giving you the new birth and taking away
[1:12:50] your old nature it's taken away the
[1:12:53] desires of the world he's brought you
[1:12:55] from the kingdom of darkness in the
[1:12:57] kingdom of light and is looking at you
[1:12:59] this morning and you say be imperfect
[1:13:04] and i don't want you looking at me this
[1:13:06] morning saying oh i can't i can't i
[1:13:09] can't do this i can't overcome this i'm
[1:13:11] struggling with it because if you say
[1:13:13] that then the scripture is not true but
[1:13:16] what i'm telling you this morning is
[1:13:17] he's calling you to win because within
[1:13:20] you there's a potential to be that
[1:13:24] so therefore stop saying i can't and
[1:13:27] begin to say i can
[1:13:29] why can i because he told me that i can
[1:13:32] because his word is calling me to
[1:13:34] perfection therefore i don't have to act
[1:13:36] like the world i don't have to think
[1:13:38] like the world the first thing i need to
[1:13:41] change is my thinking took away my
[1:13:43] thinking my inability the things that i
[1:13:46] cannot do and rely on his word and what
[1:13:49] he says in order for me to achieve it
[1:13:53] so he's made you a new creation
[1:13:57] a new creature
[1:13:58] you have been born by the spirit of god
[1:14:02] he is your father your heavenly father
[1:14:04] and is perfect so therefore when he says
[1:14:07] be imperfect is only asking you to be
[1:14:10] like your dad
[1:14:12] the one who's birthed you
[1:14:14] the one who brought you here the one who
[1:14:17] changed your life from the sin that you
[1:14:19] were in into the kingdom of
[1:14:21] righteousness therefore i want to say
[1:14:23] this righteousness is your portion this
[1:14:26] morning
[1:14:27] holiness is your portion this morning
[1:14:30] godliness is your portion this morning
[1:14:32] the holy ghost is your portion this
[1:14:34] morning
[1:14:35] let us get out of the thinking of man
[1:14:38] where you coming you're like oh god oh
[1:14:40] god i need this i need this he's telling
[1:14:42] you this morning come up higher
[1:14:45] i have made you perfect i created you by
[1:14:48] my own seed and my seed in you will
[1:14:51] bring you to perfection
[1:14:59] so
[1:15:00] the scripture began to say
[1:15:04] he began to say
[1:15:06] he says again in matthew 13
[1:15:09] if you can turn there this is the
[1:15:11] parable of the sower
[1:15:14] it says
[1:15:16] and it says another parable
[1:15:18] he put forth and
[1:15:20] unto them saying the kingdom of heaven
[1:15:24] his lack and unto man which soweth good
[1:15:26] seed
[1:15:28] matthew 13 and 24
[1:15:30] it says good seed in this field
[1:15:33] and it says but
[1:15:35] while the man slept
[1:15:37] his enemy came and saw terror among the
[1:15:40] wheats
[1:15:42] and went his way
[1:15:44] but when the blade was sprung up
[1:15:47] and brought forth fruits
[1:15:50] then appears to tear also
[1:15:53] so he
[1:15:54] so the servants of the household came
[1:15:57] and said unto him sir
[1:16:00] i said did i not they did not that i saw
[1:16:02] the good seed in the field from whence
[1:16:05] then had the tear its tares
[1:16:08] it says
[1:16:09] he said unto them
[1:16:11] an enemy had done this
[1:16:14] the servant said unto him
[1:16:16] well will thou send will thou then will
[1:16:20] that then that we do
[1:16:22] and gather them up but he said nay
[1:16:25] lest while ye gather up the tares
[1:16:29] ye root up also the weed with him
[1:16:33] but he said but let them both grow until
[1:16:36] the harvest
[1:16:38] and in the time of the harvest i will
[1:16:41] say unto the rapper i will say to the
[1:16:44] reapers
[1:16:45] gather ye
[1:16:46] together first the tear and bind them in
[1:16:50] in bundles to be burned them to bed to
[1:16:53] burn them but gather the wheat into my
[1:16:57] barns now i want you to realize here the
[1:17:00] air is jesus telling his disciples
[1:17:02] about the end time and the things that's
[1:17:05] supposed to take place now he's he's
[1:17:07] specifically speaking about a duel
[1:17:10] happening at the end time that we're
[1:17:12] going to see
[1:17:13] he he's saying that okay the first thing
[1:17:16] that's going to happen is
[1:17:18] let them grow we know that we know
[1:17:22] the parable we know that jesus explained
[1:17:24] it how that the good seed were the
[1:17:26] children of the kingdom the one who so
[1:17:28] was the son of man so the seed the one
[1:17:30] who saw the tare was the enemy
[1:17:32] was the devil and the the harvest time
[1:17:35] is the end time and we know all those
[1:17:37] things so now he's telling them but i
[1:17:39] want you to realize now he's talking
[1:17:41] about two things that's happening at the
[1:17:43] end time one of them is the fact that
[1:17:45] one seed was so another was so in the
[1:17:48] beginning but at the end time there's
[1:17:50] going to be two things that will happen
[1:17:52] the first one was to gather up all the
[1:17:55] tears together
[1:17:57] now remember he told them not to do it
[1:18:00] while the seed was young because in
[1:18:02] doing so it will hurt the seed but he's
[1:18:04] speaking about a certain maturity or a
[1:18:07] certain perfection that will be within
[1:18:09] the seed that when the time of the
[1:18:11] harvest will come that it will give them
[1:18:14] the ability to come and gather up all
[1:18:16] the tares without hurting the seed so it
[1:18:18] will tell in them about the time that
[1:18:20] will come where all the tears will be
[1:18:23] gathered together in other words is
[1:18:25] talking about the end time when the
[1:18:27] manifestation will come it says talk
[1:18:29] about the end time where we can see all
[1:18:32] the tares gathered together where the
[1:18:34] churches uh the the the the churches
[1:18:37] will come together where the
[1:18:38] confederation of churches will happen
[1:18:40] where darkness will be upon the earth
[1:18:42] where all these things will happen it
[1:18:44] says when that happens it says then we
[1:18:47] can come and gather up the seed why
[1:18:50] because the maturity or the perfection
[1:18:52] of a seed is when the seed that was
[1:18:55] planted into the ground come into the
[1:18:58] very maturity of what went into the
[1:19:00] ground is when you can come the maturity
[1:19:03] of a plant or the perfection of a plant
[1:19:06] is when a mango went into the ground and
[1:19:09] you're able to see a mango come to back
[1:19:11] forth it's not just when we can bring up
[1:19:13] leaf it's not just when the tree is
[1:19:15] growing but it's when you can see the
[1:19:17] fruits of something and and equate it to
[1:19:20] what was planted is when the
[1:19:23] manifestation of something becomes the
[1:19:26] very fruit of it is when you look at the
[1:19:29] fruits and it gives you the
[1:19:30] identification of what went into the
[1:19:32] ground that's when the perfectionist
[1:19:34] comes he says they will come to the
[1:19:36] church the church will grow up the
[1:19:38] church started just as a little at
[1:19:41] pentecostal church it came on the day of
[1:19:43] pentecost god came and he saw his seed
[1:19:46] he started his church and and yet he
[1:19:48] went to sanctification and justification
[1:19:51] and sanctification to the baptism of the
[1:19:53] holy ghost that and he was moving
[1:19:56] forward and every forward but then he
[1:19:58] comes to a place where that church
[1:20:00] becomes the manifestation of what really
[1:20:02] actually went into the ground becomes
[1:20:05] into the manifestation of jesus christ
[1:20:07] himself and he says when it comes to
[1:20:09] that time it will be the perfect
[1:20:12] identification where you will not come
[1:20:14] to the field and confuse the terror with
[1:20:17] the seed it's not going to be a time
[1:20:19] where you look and say is this the tail
[1:20:21] or is this the seed or or can i take
[1:20:24] this or can i take that it will be so
[1:20:26] clear
[1:20:28] that's why the prophet tells us it says
[1:20:30] in the air
[1:20:32] it says when it's still very low or when
[1:20:35] it's at the beginning it's hard to tell
[1:20:36] the difference
[1:20:39] the air when it's just here it's still
[1:20:42] very hard to tell apart but it says let
[1:20:45] it go
[1:20:46] as he began to progress as he began to
[1:20:49] come forth and everything and it's as
[1:20:51] it's coming into its perfection it
[1:20:54] becomes more and more clear which is the
[1:20:56] seed and which is not the seed and here
[1:20:59] is telling them it says that that in the
[1:21:01] evening time i will come it says the
[1:21:04] manifestation will be so real that
[1:21:07] you'll be able to tell them both apart
[1:21:11] now i want to say this he's saying that
[1:21:15] because we as the church of god
[1:21:18] have been called to come into the
[1:21:20] maturity of the seed that went into the
[1:21:23] ground
[1:21:24] we have been called into such a
[1:21:26] manifestation where the scripture says
[1:21:29] that
[1:21:30] in fact i'll read it in a moment here
[1:21:31] but one of them says that she the bride
[1:21:35] will become will it will be her instead
[1:21:38] of christ she will be the representation
[1:21:41] of christ in other words she will be
[1:21:44] there at the place where you'll be
[1:21:46] looking for christ she will be there
[1:21:48] because she will be just like he is
[1:21:55] now that's very important to us
[1:21:57] because the the the end time
[1:22:00] manifestation
[1:22:02] it is not a time for babies
[1:22:05] it's not the time for uh for for for
[1:22:08] children's behavior
[1:22:10] it's not a time for confusion
[1:22:13] you know i want to say this because
[1:22:16] but when i preach a message uh uh uh
[1:22:20] satan's eden
[1:22:22] or god of this evil age
[1:22:24] how that the devil
[1:22:26] what he wants us to do is to miss the
[1:22:29] mark
[1:22:30] what he wants us to do
[1:22:32] is to fail to realize the promise for
[1:22:35] the day
[1:22:36] and to be caught up in everything except
[1:22:38] what has been promised to us to be
[1:22:41] caught up in all kinds of things to be
[1:22:44] displaying all kinds of things of the
[1:22:46] world except what we have been called
[1:22:48] for then we worshipping him because
[1:22:51] remember
[1:22:52] worship for the devil all it takes is
[1:22:55] just the same way that eve doubt one
[1:22:57] word that's all it takes for you to
[1:22:59] worship the devil
[1:23:02] the the devil's worship is not uh uh uh
[1:23:06] uh one like uh like who would say with
[1:23:09] the horns and and now presents himself
[1:23:11] and say i am the devil i am the devil no
[1:23:14] the devil's worship is when the word has
[1:23:17] been put aside is when the word has not
[1:23:20] been taken into totality
[1:23:23] is when the manifestation or the
[1:23:25] understanding of the promise is what has
[1:23:28] been for the edge to pass is when the
[1:23:31] devil or something has been misplaced
[1:23:34] and the world is not matching anymore
[1:23:36] that's the devil worship
[1:23:38] it will do anything to cause you to
[1:23:41] disbelieve the word to misinterpret the
[1:23:44] word to put the word for another age to
[1:23:47] set aside what has been given to you so
[1:23:49] you can worship him
[1:23:52] now i i want to say this
[1:23:54] um
[1:23:56] the promised word for our age the
[1:23:58] barbarian will will tell us it says the
[1:24:00] promise is that the church that started
[1:24:04] at pentecost it progressed through faith
[1:24:06] and through knowledge and temperance and
[1:24:08] godliness and brotherly kindness and all
[1:24:10] these things will come and be joined by
[1:24:13] the head
[1:24:15] christ himself which is the head of the
[1:24:17] church in other words is to for us to
[1:24:20] come into the stature of the perfect man
[1:24:24] is to us to be brought up back into the
[1:24:26] stature of the perfect man now prabhanam
[1:24:29] says in question and answer he says this
[1:24:32] he says
[1:24:34] this is in 64. a question and answer he
[1:24:37] says
[1:24:38] first corinthians 13 says
[1:24:40] when that that when not which is in part
[1:24:43] has come
[1:24:45] when that when that which is perfect has
[1:24:47] come that which is in part shall be done
[1:24:50] away with
[1:24:52] i want you to think about this
[1:24:54] when that which is in part in
[1:24:58] when that which is perfect has come
[1:25:01] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:25:03] with he says so
[1:25:05] all these little things of shouting
[1:25:08] of jumping
[1:25:10] all the little things of jumping up and
[1:25:13] down like like a kid trying to talk in
[1:25:16] tongue and all those things when that
[1:25:19] which is perfect
[1:25:22] so now he he is showing the
[1:25:25] the
[1:25:26] the current circumstance
[1:25:28] what's happening right now there's the
[1:25:31] jumping there's the trying to speak in
[1:25:33] tongues there's all those uh kids
[1:25:35] behavior that's been put on display but
[1:25:38] it says when that which is perfect
[1:25:40] it says then
[1:25:42] what do we have today
[1:25:44] so trying to speak in tongue and all the
[1:25:47] other things that which when that which
[1:25:49] is prophetic has come it says and
[1:25:52] and and we do have today
[1:25:56] by god's help the perfect interpretation
[1:25:59] of the word with the fine vindication
[1:26:04] then that which is in part is done away
[1:26:07] with
[1:26:08] now i really want to press this within
[1:26:10] our heart because it's very important
[1:26:13] when that is which is perfect uh and
[1:26:16] i'll read the definition perhaps later
[1:26:18] it doesn't mean perfection when we say
[1:26:22] that which is important not which is
[1:26:24] perfect
[1:26:25] there's no such thing as casting away
[1:26:28] the word of god because we understand
[1:26:30] it's all the word
[1:26:32] but but we are progressing and going
[1:26:34] somewhere so what that which is in part
[1:26:38] he says when we have what we have in
[1:26:40] part we speak in part we prophesy
[1:26:42] important we do all of this but when the
[1:26:45] perfect come it's the swallowing up
[1:26:47] together of all the things that has been
[1:26:50] going on it's the moving on forward to
[1:26:53] the more excellent way is the moving
[1:26:56] forward to a more perfect way it's the
[1:26:58] moving on together to the manifestation
[1:27:01] of the hour
[1:27:04] are you with me to the manifestation of
[1:27:07] the hour because oh my brother my sister
[1:27:11] if we are at the end time this is the
[1:27:14] time where what luther remember the
[1:27:16] prophet of this age was to tie all the
[1:27:18] loose hands of what has been left left
[1:27:21] by luther and by by by all the other
[1:27:24] messengers and all the others was to
[1:27:26] bring him all together why to bring up
[1:27:28] the perfection of god on display we can
[1:27:32] sit here today and say we have seen the
[1:27:35] perfect one come
[1:27:38] and i want to say this this is not
[1:27:40] perfection in the sense when we say when
[1:27:43] that is perfect will come meaning we
[1:27:46] have today as it says well the the word
[1:27:49] the interpretation of the word with
[1:27:52] divine foundation this is not some
[1:27:55] knowledge pass on where i sit here and
[1:27:57] say well you know i'll show you by the
[1:27:59] bible this is what it means this is what
[1:28:02] it means it's not an exchange of
[1:28:04] knowledge it says we have the divine we
[1:28:07] have the perfect interpretation and we
[1:28:10] have been told that god interprets his
[1:28:13] word by bringing it to pass in other
[1:28:15] words we live in the time where we can
[1:28:17] look at the bible and say that i have
[1:28:20] seen god's interpretation with my own
[1:28:22] eyes
[1:28:27] we can talk about luke 17 30 and say
[1:28:30] that i have seen the perfect
[1:28:32] interpretation with divine fornication
[1:28:36] we can talk about the manifestation of
[1:28:38] sons and say i have seen the
[1:28:40] manifestation with my own eyes
[1:28:44] because if this is just some knowledge
[1:28:46] transfer where we can sit here and say
[1:28:48] oh this is this and this is that
[1:28:51] that could be argued upon that could be
[1:28:53] debated based on who you talk to but
[1:28:56] when you have you yourself
[1:28:58] god has revealed it to you
[1:29:00] to where you can see the end time you
[1:29:03] can see what's happening out there where
[1:29:05] we can take the
[1:29:06] the message of the hour and be able to
[1:29:09] look at the world and see everything
[1:29:11] that's happening out there in the
[1:29:12] message
[1:29:13] that is the interpretation
[1:29:19] and that's what we are being moved into
[1:29:21] and i want to say this if we are moving
[1:29:24] into this interpretation into the
[1:29:27] perfection of god let's not settle for
[1:29:30] anything less
[1:29:33] and i'm not talking about just the
[1:29:34] message as being the body i'm talking
[1:29:37] about the promises of god for our own
[1:29:39] life i want to see holiness within my
[1:29:42] life i want to see the righteousness of
[1:29:44] god within my own life i want to see the
[1:29:46] healing of god within the body i want to
[1:29:49] see the salvation of god why because
[1:29:52] it's the perfect interpretation
[1:29:58] he says
[1:30:01] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:30:03] with divine vindication
[1:30:06] when that which is perfect
[1:30:08] when where that which is in part is done
[1:30:11] away with
[1:30:12] it says when i was a child i speak as a
[1:30:14] child
[1:30:15] i understood as a child
[1:30:18] but when i became a man i put away
[1:30:20] childish things amen
[1:30:22] he says
[1:30:23] i go
[1:30:25] it says i go to preaching
[1:30:27] and they don't get these things
[1:30:30] when we see the interpretation
[1:30:34] there's no argument
[1:30:38] when we see we come face to face with
[1:30:40] interpretation
[1:30:42] there's nothing new arguing
[1:30:45] but all if we have his words and and and
[1:30:48] and ways to view things
[1:30:51] we all that can be debated and argued
[1:30:53] upon
[1:30:54] that's why this message
[1:30:56] it has to become a life to each and
[1:30:59] every one of us
[1:31:00] and i'm not talking about a one-time
[1:31:02] life it has to be a continual life
[1:31:06] life source within your body that keeps
[1:31:09] you walking that keeps you talking that
[1:31:12] that fills your mind in your thinking
[1:31:14] and everything it has to be something
[1:31:17] that continually you walk by
[1:31:19] it's not
[1:31:20] and i want to just jump ahead and say
[1:31:22] this because mainly when we look at the
[1:31:25] church world and the things that man is
[1:31:28] trying to do
[1:31:29] the word of god has become like a source
[1:31:32] of knowledge where people can go and
[1:31:34] gain knowledge and know how to speak and
[1:31:37] and now how to
[1:31:38] communicate with people and how to tell
[1:31:41] them about the goodness of god but i
[1:31:43] want to say this that's not enough god
[1:31:46] in this end time the perfection that
[1:31:49] he's bringing is he's bringing us right
[1:31:51] back into what was in the beginning
[1:31:55] and what was in the beginning in the
[1:31:57] beginning there was a man who was
[1:31:59] married in the image of god a man who
[1:32:01] walked like god walked who talked like
[1:32:04] god talked who thought like god was
[1:32:06] thinking and that man he was there with
[1:32:09] the mind of god being translated
[1:32:11] directly to him in other words what that
[1:32:14] man desire was directly connected to
[1:32:16] god's desire what that man was thinking
[1:32:19] was directly connected to god's desire
[1:32:22] and therefore we have to be brought into
[1:32:24] that same state
[1:32:29] we can't walk around
[1:32:31] with all the business of life and all
[1:32:35] the things and and the devil trying to
[1:32:37] choke the life out of you and and we
[1:32:39] feel like we're barely making it oh god
[1:32:42] if you can get me out of this oh god if
[1:32:44] you could get me out of this oh god it's
[1:32:46] telling you this morning be imperfect
[1:32:50] as your father in heaven is perfect in
[1:32:53] other words he's telling you within you
[1:32:55] i have equipped you with the power to
[1:32:57] overcome those things i have given you
[1:33:00] the power to walk in my righteousness i
[1:33:02] have given you the power to walk in my
[1:33:04] holiness i have given you the power for
[1:33:07] you to claim your family to claim your
[1:33:09] children to be to claim your healing to
[1:33:12] claim everything that you have need off
[1:33:19] we have to twist it out of the enemy's
[1:33:21] hand we we cannot let our minds be
[1:33:24] filled with the burdens of life and come
[1:33:27] to church and and just barely oh if i
[1:33:30] could just get something to lift me up
[1:33:34] that's not the life that god has called
[1:33:36] us to live he wants us to be overcomers
[1:33:39] he wants us to be his children he wants
[1:33:42] us to be his representative in fact he's
[1:33:45] put you here so when he desires to do
[1:33:48] something he can contact you he can come
[1:33:50] through you and get it done
[1:33:57] now let me read this as we continue on
[1:34:00] the scripture
[1:34:02] when we talk about uh perfection by
[1:34:05] definition
[1:34:06] and there's a lot of definition attached
[1:34:08] to it i just uh took few and uh and i
[1:34:12] hope you will help us just illustrate
[1:34:13] what we're trying to say this morning
[1:34:15] it's the process of achieving a
[1:34:18] spiritual maturity or perfection so
[1:34:21] perfect is without needing of anything
[1:34:24] perfection is the process
[1:34:27] of walking into perfection
[1:34:30] perfection is the prophet is a process
[1:34:33] of walking into what's perfect
[1:34:38] it's the process of a choosing of
[1:34:41] achieving maturity or perfection
[1:34:46] it says also apply to people it refers
[1:34:48] to the completeness of parts
[1:34:51] of perfection where no part is defected
[1:34:54] is defective or wanting
[1:34:57] it's being entirely without fault or
[1:35:01] defect
[1:35:02] the action or the process of improving
[1:35:05] something until it becomes thoughtless
[1:35:12] now when the church came into the
[1:35:14] ephesus the first church age
[1:35:16] when they were there
[1:35:18] all they knew was justification
[1:35:22] now for that time that was perfection
[1:35:25] to them
[1:35:27] that was all that was required it was
[1:35:30] the word that was provided them
[1:35:32] give them perfection for them to walk in
[1:35:36] but as far as god is concerned that's
[1:35:39] not the perfection it was trying to
[1:35:41] achieve that that was not the ending for
[1:35:44] excuse the word that was tree was trying
[1:35:46] to achieve then when they moved from
[1:35:48] justification into sanctification the
[1:35:50] church was moving up but as far as they
[1:35:53] were concerned they were at the end time
[1:35:56] and they were achieving what the word
[1:35:57] was promised for them to achieve
[1:36:01] but that was not god's goal he continued
[1:36:03] to move them all because he knew that
[1:36:06] his intention was that at the end time
[1:36:09] he will have a church that will be
[1:36:11] without sin without spot without wrinkle
[1:36:14] into his own image
[1:36:19] and barbara talks about
[1:36:21] the process of a gold purifying it says
[1:36:25] it will take gold and they will beat it
[1:36:27] and it will beat it when until the
[1:36:29] reflection of the beater is reflected
[1:36:32] directly into the gold
[1:36:34] that's when they knew that this is now
[1:36:36] perfect
[1:36:38] that's when they knew that the impurity
[1:36:40] was out of the goal oh my brother my
[1:36:42] sister god has been beating his church
[1:36:45] and and taking out the worldliness and
[1:36:48] all the things when until he can get his
[1:36:51] own reflection
[1:36:53] into his church
[1:36:54] and i want to say this this morning we
[1:36:57] desire each one i know but adam says
[1:36:59] that it says i know even as we sit here
[1:37:02] this morning that each one we desire a
[1:37:04] greater measure of god than what we have
[1:37:06] today
[1:37:09] we desire to see his manifestation and
[1:37:12] then i want to say this morning then let
[1:37:14] us move into perfection let us continue
[1:37:17] to walk let us if if we arrive then we
[1:37:20] shouldn't be here but if we're still
[1:37:22] here it means there's a perfection to be
[1:37:25] obtained
[1:37:31] but if adam talks about that sister the
[1:37:34] college sister who came in
[1:37:36] he said i would like to give a testimony
[1:37:38] for branham
[1:37:40] he says i'll say this
[1:37:42] i know
[1:37:43] i'm not what i ought to be
[1:37:49] i'm not what i want to be when i look at
[1:37:52] myself
[1:37:53] this is not the perfection why because
[1:37:56] i'm looking at myself through the word
[1:37:58] of god i'm seeing these things lacking
[1:38:01] i'm seeing the impurity upon me i see
[1:38:04] there are things that i'm i want to see
[1:38:06] out and i want to see things change and
[1:38:08] all of that but it says i'm not what i
[1:38:11] used to be
[1:38:12] one thing i know for sure is i'm not
[1:38:14] what i used to be why because i'm in the
[1:38:17] process of perfection i'm being in fact
[1:38:21] one of them says one place it says
[1:38:22] you're going somewhere
[1:38:24] you are headed somewhere and i want to
[1:38:26] say this this morning to each one
[1:38:29] sitting in this building and each one
[1:38:30] listening to this message you have to be
[1:38:33] for sure knowing that you're going
[1:38:35] somewhere
[1:38:37] whether you want it or not whether you
[1:38:39] know it or not you are going somewhere
[1:38:44] but it's upon us to find out this
[1:38:46] morning am i actually moving in the
[1:38:49] right way of perfection am i actually
[1:38:52] moving in the
[1:38:53] provided way the word and the message
[1:38:56] that's been provided to me am i actually
[1:38:59] being purified to walk into the
[1:39:01] righteousness of god
[1:39:05] it says here
[1:39:07] it says
[1:39:08] now this is when i'm speaking now he uh
[1:39:10] he he's uh when he's preaching the
[1:39:14] message that satchel of the perfect man
[1:39:15] he says in pr i believe in paragraph
[1:39:18] seven it says and this morning
[1:39:20] we want to speak to you on a subject or
[1:39:23] teach rather if we can
[1:39:25] if we can
[1:39:27] listen to how we called it
[1:39:29] building the living tabernacle
[1:39:32] building the living tabernacle of the
[1:39:35] living god dwelling
[1:39:38] places building
[1:39:41] the living tabernacle
[1:39:44] of the living god dwelling place
[1:39:48] the perfect man
[1:39:52] now
[1:39:53] how can god dwell in us
[1:39:56] when we are caught up in all kinds of
[1:39:58] worldliness every day
[1:40:01] how can god dwell in us when our minds
[1:40:04] all that we're thinking on is this so
[1:40:07] that and and never having to come back
[1:40:09] and say that i have been born by the sea
[1:40:13] the reason why he's asking me to move to
[1:40:15] perfection is because of the seed that
[1:40:18] he placed within me
[1:40:20] because i want to say this i i so enjoy
[1:40:23] what matthew preached wednesday and and
[1:40:25] i hope we can just build it upon this
[1:40:28] and and so you can come to the
[1:40:29] realization now remember
[1:40:32] he says he talked about april ministers
[1:40:34] my brother my sister we have been made
[1:40:37] be made able ministers of righteousness
[1:40:40] we have been made able ministers of the
[1:40:42] holiness of god why because the perfect
[1:40:44] sacrifice was given for us
[1:40:49] he he came to you he took all of your
[1:40:51] sin i i'm talking about past present and
[1:40:54] future
[1:40:56] i'm talking about anything you can think
[1:40:58] of i'm talking about things that you
[1:41:00] can't even think of
[1:41:02] i'm talking about things that cannot
[1:41:03] even enter your mind he took all of that
[1:41:06] upon himself
[1:41:08] he the perfect sacrifice so you can take
[1:41:11] his place and he took your place
[1:41:14] what a righteousness this morning and he
[1:41:17] did that so we can gather up this
[1:41:19] morning and not having to think about
[1:41:21] our sins and concentrate ourselves on
[1:41:23] them but yet we come back every morning
[1:41:26] our minds is full of our sins
[1:41:29] oh i did this oh i did that
[1:41:31] what else would you take
[1:41:33] what else do you need
[1:41:35] he's provided the sacrifice for you he's
[1:41:37] made
[1:41:38] made us able ministers in other words we
[1:41:40] were not able
[1:41:42] we felt short we came short of the
[1:41:44] kingdom of god the scripture says that
[1:41:47] he that was a children of disobedient
[1:41:50] you were children of of the world and
[1:41:52] you did all those things you you
[1:41:54] disobeyed the word of god but oh god
[1:41:58] reaching mercy he came to you he
[1:42:01] provided the sacrifice so you can be
[1:42:04] sitting here this morning my body my
[1:42:06] sister it's not it's not by america
[1:42:10] we're sitting here this morning and do
[1:42:12] not take it for granted
[1:42:16] don't ever think you are good enough to
[1:42:18] sit here this morning
[1:42:22] let me just just came to my mind and
[1:42:24] i'll say it i thought it was so
[1:42:25] wonderful
[1:42:27] i heard a man i believe he was on the
[1:42:28] radio you know i was listening to a
[1:42:30] radio
[1:42:31] going to work and i heard him saying i
[1:42:33] thought it was so wonderful
[1:42:35] you know he spoke he's speaking about
[1:42:36] humility he said
[1:42:37] you know in the church they decided
[1:42:40] you know the
[1:42:41] to vote for the most humble people and
[1:42:44] and so
[1:42:45] they they when they voted the vote went
[1:42:48] to went to the the
[1:42:51] the deacon so you know but jackson but
[1:42:53] gary and everything
[1:42:55] also they give them medals you know for
[1:42:57] being so humble in the work that they do
[1:43:00] and they appreciated them in everything
[1:43:02] so what happened is next sunday all the
[1:43:05] deacons decided to show up with the
[1:43:07] medals on
[1:43:08] and then when they showed up they took
[1:43:09] it all because they thought they were
[1:43:11] not humble
[1:43:15] they were not humble enough
[1:43:20] you did you catch it so in other words
[1:43:23] it's never us coming to a place where i
[1:43:26] think i deserve this i deserve that i
[1:43:28] did good enough and i must have added
[1:43:30] something that's why god chose me no
[1:43:33] it's you always constantly the moment
[1:43:35] you compare what is done with your life
[1:43:38] you look at yourself you can't even
[1:43:40] believe it you got to delete it and say
[1:43:42] it cannot be me it cannot be me i cannot
[1:43:46] deserve this there's no way i can
[1:43:48] deserve this but he looks at you and
[1:43:50] says i have chosen you
[1:43:53] and i want to say this that's the
[1:43:55] righteousness of god and i would rather
[1:43:58] walk by that righteousness than anything
[1:44:00] man can give me i would rather believe
[1:44:02] that righteousness why when you believe
[1:44:05] that righteousness it lifts you up it
[1:44:07] cleans your sins it took you out of the
[1:44:10] the drug house and out of wherever you
[1:44:12] were out of the world and he dressed
[1:44:15] your right it caused you to talk right
[1:44:21] it's not us it's him
[1:44:23] the perfect sacrifice and i want to say
[1:44:26] this you can never attain to perfection
[1:44:29] without the new birth
[1:44:32] you might as well forget it but one of
[1:44:34] them says this now when you talk about
[1:44:36] the statue of a perfect man or growing
[1:44:39] forth it's not uh a cell of a dog added
[1:44:43] with a cell of a cat and added another
[1:44:46] cell it can mix
[1:44:49] so perfection comes by him
[1:44:51] therefore the beginning cell is his self
[1:44:55] therefore the beginning of it is the new
[1:44:57] birth it's god himself coming and
[1:44:59] changing your heart and taking away your
[1:45:02] desires
[1:45:05] and when you've done that when he's done
[1:45:08] that
[1:45:08] then you can add to it
[1:45:11] then from faith
[1:45:13] virtue could be added then from virtue
[1:45:18] temperance
[1:45:19] godliness
[1:45:21] all of those other things could be added
[1:45:23] to it
[1:45:24] but it has to start with the new birth
[1:45:26] therefore the most important thing we
[1:45:28] can talk about this morning is you've
[1:45:30] got to be born again
[1:45:34] and i want to say this when you when
[1:45:37] you're born again you have to
[1:45:39] continually stay within the mind of god
[1:45:43] because the devil will try to catch you
[1:45:46] at every corner
[1:45:51] he's trying to build a tabernacle a
[1:45:53] living place for god
[1:45:55] and the only way it could be built is
[1:45:57] through him is the prefecture he's the
[1:46:00] the scripture says he's the beginning of
[1:46:02] the creation and prabhupada interpreters
[1:46:05] is the author the beginner the one who
[1:46:08] starts it
[1:46:11] now in in second peter chapter one i'm
[1:46:14] racing against times you've just
[1:46:16] forgiven me this morning peter says it
[1:46:18] says simon peter servant an apostle of
[1:46:21] jesus christ
[1:46:23] it says to them that obtain
[1:46:25] like precious faith with us through the
[1:46:28] righteousness of god
[1:46:30] and and with the righteousness of god
[1:46:32] and our savior jesus he's letting you
[1:46:34] know where you obtain your righteousness
[1:46:37] not through yourself that have obtained
[1:46:40] righteousness that have obtained like
[1:46:42] precious faith through the righteousness
[1:46:45] of god in other words god deciding you
[1:46:49] you're going to receive my perfect faith
[1:46:51] you will receive my faith
[1:46:53] my precious faith and the savior jesus
[1:46:56] christ grace and peace be multiplied
[1:46:58] unto you through the knowledge of god
[1:47:01] and jesus christ our lord according as
[1:47:04] his divine power as given and it's been
[1:47:07] has given unto us all things that
[1:47:09] pertain unto life and godliness
[1:47:12] all things that we have need of to life
[1:47:15] and godliness it's in him
[1:47:18] it's not in our self it's divine power
[1:47:21] has given us those things through the
[1:47:23] knowledge of him
[1:47:25] through the knowledge of him that has
[1:47:26] called us
[1:47:28] to glory and virtue whereby our given
[1:47:31] are given unto us an exceeding great and
[1:47:34] precious promise by this that ye might
[1:47:37] be partakers of divine nature having
[1:47:40] escaped the corruption which is in the
[1:47:42] world through lust how many have escaped
[1:47:44] this morning oh i tell you it's not an
[1:47:47] escape where oh i saw it and then no he
[1:47:50] came he revealed himself to you he took
[1:47:53] you out and you look in the floor and
[1:47:55] says i can't believe the corruption
[1:47:57] that's in it why because he took he took
[1:48:00] you out of it
[1:48:03] and it says and beside this giving all
[1:48:06] due diligence that you may have
[1:48:08] that you add to your faith virtue
[1:48:11] knowledge virtue and knowledge
[1:48:14] and the knowledge of and not to
[1:48:16] knowledge tempers and temper spacious
[1:48:18] and precious godliness
[1:48:20] and this
[1:48:21] it says and to godliness broadly
[1:48:23] kindness
[1:48:24] and bodily kindness charity
[1:48:28] and then he says
[1:48:30] and if these things are in you and
[1:48:31] abound
[1:48:33] they make you
[1:48:35] they make you
[1:48:36] that ye shall neither be barren or nor
[1:48:39] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[1:48:40] jesus
[1:48:42] i want to say this
[1:48:44] we need to understand what road we are
[1:48:46] on this morning
[1:48:48] we need to be very very well aware
[1:48:51] of the direction and the road that we
[1:48:53] are in
[1:48:55] because
[1:48:56] it's very important that we come to a
[1:48:58] place where we are striving for the
[1:49:01] masteries like paul says
[1:49:03] where we are pressing into a direction
[1:49:05] it says
[1:49:06] one thing i do is i forget all things
[1:49:08] that are behind and i press towards the
[1:49:10] mark and i want to ask you what is your
[1:49:12] mark this morning
[1:49:16] what is your mark this morning
[1:49:19] is your mark so you can become more
[1:49:22] knowledgeable and get big
[1:49:24] great businesses and make more money and
[1:49:26] build more houses and do this and and
[1:49:29] then not needing to work anymore
[1:49:34] what is your mark this morning it's so
[1:49:36] that i can be the well-dressed person
[1:49:38] and i can look always good and i can do
[1:49:41] this and because you're pressing for
[1:49:43] something
[1:49:46] you know god of this evil age
[1:49:48] is one that is so disguised my brother
[1:49:51] my sister that will hide in anything in
[1:49:54] other words if it's 99 the word of god
[1:49:57] and one percent not the devil is in it
[1:50:05] and i want to say this it's very
[1:50:06] important we understand the the new
[1:50:09] birth has been given to me so it's an
[1:50:12] opportunity for me to walk towards
[1:50:14] perfection it's an opportunity for me to
[1:50:17] leave behind all the things that are
[1:50:19] bothering me all the things of the world
[1:50:21] that hang on me it's the things it's not
[1:50:24] the only thing that has been given to me
[1:50:26] for me to press forward
[1:50:32] and i want to say this
[1:50:36] prabhupada in a statue of a perfect man
[1:50:39] it says
[1:50:44] it says that's how we've passed from
[1:50:46] death
[1:50:49] unto life
[1:50:52] we look back to the pits where we were
[1:50:55] where we was
[1:50:56] hewing from
[1:50:58] it says we are not
[1:51:01] what we want to be we are not even what
[1:51:03] we ought to be
[1:51:05] but one thing we are thankful for
[1:51:07] we are not what we used to be
[1:51:12] if if you don't have the answer to that
[1:51:14] question
[1:51:16] you need to seek the lord
[1:51:19] if you don't know if you are better off
[1:51:22] today
[1:51:23] compared to what you used to be
[1:51:25] you are at a very dangerous place
[1:51:29] if you cannot answer
[1:51:31] whether you the version of that you are
[1:51:34] today
[1:51:35] compared to the version that you were uh
[1:51:38] five ten years ago even a year ago even
[1:51:41] a month ago
[1:51:43] you need to look in what direction you
[1:51:45] are progressing
[1:51:46] because one thing that we know is we we
[1:51:49] are bombarded with a busyness of life
[1:51:52] and and the things that you know i i you
[1:51:54] know
[1:51:55] oftentimes you've heard me say this
[1:51:57] you get to a place you feel like the
[1:51:59] days are like the days of creation you
[1:52:02] know you have children you walk out you
[1:52:03] got to get them ready for school and
[1:52:05] everything you drop them to school you
[1:52:07] come home you start working or you go to
[1:52:08] work and your alarm goes off oh it's
[1:52:10] time to go pick them up and then you go
[1:52:12] you pick them up you come you eat and
[1:52:14] then you go to sleep and then your alarm
[1:52:16] goes off it's the time to do the same
[1:52:17] cycle again
[1:52:19] so it's like morning and then it's night
[1:52:21] and then it's the next day
[1:52:24] life becomes so occupied so busy and and
[1:52:29] before you know you you try to pray in
[1:52:31] five minutes you're heading not and you
[1:52:33] know you you it's time because your body
[1:52:35] is so tired and i want to say this god
[1:52:38] didn't place us our priority for being
[1:52:40] here on earth it's just not so we can
[1:52:43] have families so we can buy cars and buy
[1:52:46] houses we are here for the purpose of of
[1:52:50] worshiping the living god
[1:52:54] that's the primary reason why we are
[1:52:56] here so when we take care of our
[1:52:58] children we worship god when we go to
[1:53:01] our work we worship god we want to
[1:53:03] worship god in every circumstances in
[1:53:06] any place that we are in whether good or
[1:53:09] bad whatever is happening to you whether
[1:53:11] you lost everything that you had whether
[1:53:13] you got more than what you did before
[1:53:16] the purpose is i need to be worshipping
[1:53:18] god
[1:53:22] these hands were not just made so you
[1:53:24] can work and make money they were meant
[1:53:26] to be clapped for god
[1:53:28] so you can say thank you god and lift
[1:53:30] them up but one of them says when you
[1:53:32] lift them up you defy gravity
[1:53:34] this fate were given to you so you can
[1:53:37] spread good news not so you can go and
[1:53:39] talk about people and and go to places
[1:53:42] you shouldn't go but oh if you think
[1:53:44] about your feet and say god you have
[1:53:47] given me this so i can preach the good
[1:53:49] news so wherever i go i can represent
[1:53:52] you
[1:53:55] the math was given so we can proclaim
[1:53:57] the goodness of god to people not so we
[1:54:00] can spew up nonsense and tell people how
[1:54:03] much we know and how much they don't
[1:54:05] know
[1:54:08] your body is given to you to be the
[1:54:11] temple of god
[1:54:17] we let our natural human
[1:54:20] desire overcome the very expression that
[1:54:23] we have been given
[1:54:25] and i say this this morning it says
[1:54:28] be perfect
[1:54:30] be perfect
[1:54:32] follow the example of your father
[1:54:35] follow in that
[1:54:37] and then he says you escape the
[1:54:38] corruption
[1:54:41] which is in the world
[1:54:43] the lust the corruption which is in the
[1:54:45] world
[1:54:46] you are above that
[1:54:47] it says that's the type of the person we
[1:54:50] are talking to
[1:54:51] the person that escaped these things the
[1:54:53] corruption which is in the world it says
[1:54:55] and besides this
[1:54:57] leaving all diligent unto you
[1:55:00] unto your faith it says add unto your
[1:55:02] faith virtue knowledge
[1:55:04] and knowledge temperance temperance
[1:55:06] patience patience godliness
[1:55:08] it speaks about all these things too
[1:55:11] now
[1:55:13] listen to what branham says now i
[1:55:15] thought this
[1:55:16] really pricked my heart when i read it
[1:55:19] last night
[1:55:21] he says this it says remember
[1:55:23] god revealed himself in three in three
[1:55:26] ways first
[1:55:28] the first time he revealed himself as
[1:55:30] the pillar of fire
[1:55:31] and he called fatherhood
[1:55:34] then he came down the same god man
[1:55:36] manifested in jesus christ
[1:55:38] which is
[1:55:41] he says
[1:55:43] which he built the body he made his body
[1:55:46] he says thirdly
[1:55:48] through the death of that body
[1:55:51] he sanctified the church that he can
[1:55:53] dwell in it
[1:55:58] god the father
[1:56:00] comes
[1:56:02] and makes himself a body called jesus
[1:56:04] christ
[1:56:06] a sanctified body a holy body
[1:56:09] and he takes the body and he gives it to
[1:56:11] sacrifice
[1:56:13] so he can move into the third stage
[1:56:16] of him dwelling himself
[1:56:20] so he can dwell
[1:56:22] he's sanctified so he can dwell in it
[1:56:25] it was god above us god with us
[1:56:29] god in us the same god
[1:56:31] that's the reason he was called father
[1:56:35] son
[1:56:36] holy ghost
[1:56:38] you think about the godhead
[1:56:39] you think about the definition
[1:56:42] he says not three gods not by not three
[1:56:46] gods but three offices of one god
[1:56:48] it says they've had they've had only
[1:56:51] thoughts of the uh if they felt if they
[1:56:54] only thought about that didn't announce
[1:56:55] in council we wouldn't have been with
[1:56:57] all the mess with all the mess up it
[1:57:00] says would we that's right not three god
[1:57:03] the people couldn't understand how jesus
[1:57:06] talked to the father and the father and
[1:57:09] the
[1:57:09] to the father and he
[1:57:11] and the father are one well the whole
[1:57:14] thing is sure
[1:57:16] just unfold unfolds it certainly it's
[1:57:19] not three god it's three offices now he
[1:57:22] says it continues on it says what is it
[1:57:25] god condensating
[1:57:27] condescending to his creation
[1:57:30] god wants to be
[1:57:33] worshipped
[1:57:35] oh my brother my sister
[1:57:37] if if your life and my life this morning
[1:57:40] if all that we can achieve if all that
[1:57:43] we can do if all of that could only come
[1:57:45] to a place where we can worship god
[1:57:48] we've done what we need to do if all our
[1:57:51] lives everything that we do everything
[1:57:53] that we involve ourselves in if all of
[1:57:55] that could be combined and say that i'm
[1:57:57] worshiping god that's what we need to be
[1:58:00] doing he said god wants to be worshiped
[1:58:03] the word the word god means object of
[1:58:05] worship and god
[1:58:08] trying to co to condition to condition
[1:58:11] his people so he can get them from what
[1:58:14] uh to get them from what he created them
[1:58:18] for he never met he never made you to be
[1:58:21] something else besides a son and a
[1:58:23] daughter of god
[1:58:25] if you
[1:58:26] if you have missed that
[1:58:29] if you have missed that of being a son
[1:58:31] or daughter you've missed the mark
[1:58:38] if you cannot look at yourself and say
[1:58:40] i'm a son i'm a daughter you've missed
[1:58:43] the mark
[1:58:44] if you can look at yourself this morning
[1:58:46] and and say that i can be perfect
[1:58:49] because he made me perfect i i could do
[1:58:52] better because he told me i could do
[1:58:54] better i could do that because he placed
[1:58:57] that within me if you cannot this
[1:58:59] morning link tattoo you need to go back
[1:59:02] to him why because that's the purpose of
[1:59:05] our gathering here is because we realize
[1:59:07] that we are more than what the world was
[1:59:09] telling us we are we are more than our
[1:59:11] own thinking we are here because someone
[1:59:14] told us that we were better than what we
[1:59:16] were and he proved it to us
[1:59:20] oh i say this morning
[1:59:22] let us move on to perfection
[1:59:25] let us move on to perfection
[1:59:27] now listen to this as i'm coming to the
[1:59:30] end now it says he speaks now in acts
[1:59:33] chapter 4
[1:59:34] 7 and 44 it says our father
[1:59:37] it says our father had a tabernacle of
[1:59:40] witness
[1:59:41] in the wilderness and he had appointed
[1:59:44] speaking unto them moses it says to
[1:59:47] moses that he should that sh that he
[1:59:49] should make according
[1:59:51] to
[1:59:52] uh
[1:59:53] to the fashion
[1:59:56] that he has seen
[1:59:58] which also our father had
[2:00:01] a father that came
[2:00:03] in from
[2:00:04] and brought in jesus said unto
[2:00:07] unto the
[2:00:08] the the possession of the gentile who
[2:00:11] were drawn who were drawn out before the
[2:00:13] face of our father unto the day of david
[2:00:16] found out the favor before god and
[2:00:19] desired to find the tabernacle of god
[2:00:22] of god of jacob but solomon built him a
[2:00:24] house now but i'm says this and i know
[2:00:28] for the sake of time i'm not going to go
[2:00:29] through all of it i'm just going to try
[2:00:31] to summarize
[2:00:32] summarize it i i and i think this is
[2:00:35] very critical
[2:00:37] now david had within his heart to desire
[2:00:40] to build god a house
[2:00:43] he said that i dwell in the palace but
[2:00:45] yet the the the ark of god is over there
[2:00:48] in the tent but now i want you to
[2:00:50] remember that the the design of the tent
[2:00:53] that he saw that the the the the ark was
[2:00:57] in
[2:00:58] it didn't come from themselves trying to
[2:01:00] do god a favor but it came from a model
[2:01:02] that god showed moses
[2:01:04] when he looked it says that i want you
[2:01:06] to
[2:01:07] to design or to build the tabernacle
[2:01:09] based upon the model that i have shown
[2:01:11] you in heaven so there's a tabernacle in
[2:01:14] heaven that was to be displayed on earth
[2:01:17] and and we know by the message that that
[2:01:20] tabernacle were made of skins
[2:01:26] they said body prepared for you
[2:01:29] the tabernacle was made of skin but now
[2:01:32] david looks and says how can it be my
[2:01:35] house looks so nice and building blocks
[2:01:37] and knits all of this i want to build
[2:01:39] god a house like mine
[2:01:41] a bigger house and things like that and
[2:01:43] the prophet looks at him and says do all
[2:01:45] that's in your heart to do and so david
[2:01:48] went on but then the prophet came back
[2:01:50] and he says well you know
[2:01:52] you are a bloody man god came and told
[2:01:54] him it says you can't build me a
[2:01:55] tabernacle but your son will build me a
[2:01:58] tabernacle so solomon comes and he
[2:02:00] builds the tabernacle and
[2:02:03] with all the material that david
[2:02:05] gathered all of it in fact the scripture
[2:02:07] says that everything fits so perfectly
[2:02:10] together
[2:02:12] because every machine everything all
[2:02:14] those stones were already so cut out
[2:02:17] perfectly to fit in the building and but
[2:02:19] then he says god is building a lively
[2:02:21] church not building of stones but a body
[2:02:24] has not prepared me it says so here it
[2:02:27] comes and it comes and i want to say
[2:02:29] this this morning because i feel like
[2:02:31] this is the human nature when you you
[2:02:34] read through the bible
[2:02:36] man has always want to get into some
[2:02:38] kind of a relationship with god where we
[2:02:41] have built this house for god and we
[2:02:44] call this the temple of god
[2:02:46] so they want to be at the place where oh
[2:02:49] this is where god dwells i can come in
[2:02:51] and fellowship with god and once i have
[2:02:54] enough i go back and i do my own thing
[2:02:56] and i go to places i want him and if i
[2:02:59] need to come and find god i go back to
[2:03:01] the building
[2:03:03] i go back to the building then i worship
[2:03:05] him again then i praise him but then i i
[2:03:08] want to create a distance i don't want
[2:03:11] too much contact i don't want to be
[2:03:13] constantly but when i have a need when i
[2:03:16] need healing i want to come to him when
[2:03:18] i need deliverance i want to reach out
[2:03:20] to him but i don't want too much contact
[2:03:23] i just i want to be a space between us
[2:03:26] oh the scripture says that job desires
[2:03:29] to have a go between someone who can put
[2:03:32] the hands on the holy god and a sinful
[2:03:35] man so he can reconcile them together
[2:03:37] someone who understood who god was and
[2:03:40] someone who understood who man was so he
[2:03:42] can breach the gap that existed but man
[2:03:45] wants to remain in that kind of
[2:03:47] relationship where i can dress wherever
[2:03:49] i want i can do whatever i want but when
[2:03:52] i'm convicted i have to come and fix it
[2:03:54] up again and then god looks at them and
[2:03:56] says that's not the tabernacle i desire
[2:04:02] that's not the table accolade desire
[2:04:04] this morning god wants a tabernacle that
[2:04:07] he he can dwell in it
[2:04:09] remain in it every day talk to you every
[2:04:12] day counsel you every day show you the
[2:04:15] way every day he can be there and it's
[2:04:18] his dwelling place
[2:04:21] not some kind of a far-off experience
[2:04:23] where you kind of have it at home you
[2:04:26] know i'll get closer when i need to but
[2:04:28] i'll go back that was the tabernacle in
[2:04:31] the wilderness
[2:04:32] that was remember when god came upon the
[2:04:35] mountain
[2:04:36] they had to step afore
[2:04:39] because touching the mountain will kill
[2:04:40] you
[2:04:42] but all through jesus christ the perfect
[2:04:44] sacrifice god came and he showed he
[2:04:48] ripped the veil of the temple to show
[2:04:50] that that's not what he desired anymore
[2:04:52] that was the falsity of man he came in
[2:04:55] the same time to show that he can dwell
[2:04:58] within a man
[2:05:02] just like he did in jesus christ
[2:05:06] i say let us move to perfection
[2:05:09] what is perfection
[2:05:11] god
[2:05:13] dwelling in your flesh
[2:05:15] what abandonment says luke 17 30 was one
[2:05:18] of the greatest
[2:05:21] promise
[2:05:24] think about it
[2:05:25] you're like oh i thought
[2:05:27] you know revelation 10 7 god
[2:05:30] no luke 17 30.
[2:05:33] what was it
[2:05:35] abraham came we went through who's this
[2:05:37] melchizedek
[2:05:39] what was abraham looking at
[2:05:42] he looked at there
[2:05:44] he saw god
[2:05:46] he saw the very mind of god
[2:05:49] revealed to him and he might not look at
[2:05:51] him and said is there anything
[2:05:53] impossible to god
[2:05:58] god in human
[2:06:00] flesh is the conclusion of the matter
[2:06:04] if you can miss it all the understanding
[2:06:07] of everything don't miss that it's god
[2:06:11] in the human flesh
[2:06:13] fulfilling the word for this hour
[2:06:21] it says
[2:06:24] know how that god
[2:06:27] is in his church
[2:06:28] the church now
[2:06:30] supposed to be taking
[2:06:32] the place of christ
[2:06:39] carrying on his ministry
[2:06:45] sometimes i feel like we are divided in
[2:06:49] observers and participants like our
[2:06:52] pastor preached the other day
[2:06:55] you know there are those that are just
[2:06:57] an arm length you know
[2:06:59] i like what's happening no i don't like
[2:07:01] this
[2:07:03] you know they're just
[2:07:05] picking and choosing what they like what
[2:07:07] they don't like
[2:07:11] this is his body
[2:07:15] he's calling you to be part of it
[2:07:21] who knows you being added to it and
[2:07:23] committing to it will actually bring us
[2:07:25] into perfection
[2:07:30] one thing we need to die on is our own
[2:07:33] ideas even as our prophet told us
[2:07:35] we need to die off our own ideas and
[2:07:37] take his ideas
[2:07:44] and i begin to think about this
[2:07:48] and i'll just skip for
[2:07:52] let me just read this
[2:07:54] excuse me we're going to get out of here
[2:07:56] shortly
[2:07:57] it says now it says
[2:08:00] believe me god works it says carrying on
[2:08:02] his ministry he that believeth on me the
[2:08:05] works that i do shall we do also yet a
[2:08:06] little while the world will see me no
[2:08:08] more yet you shall see me for i am with
[2:08:11] you i am
[2:08:12] with you even in you until the end time
[2:08:14] there it is carrying on his work
[2:08:18] now god
[2:08:20] or the bible says
[2:08:22] stephen spoke to solomon building the
[2:08:25] temple and the most high goddamn
[2:08:27] dwelling temple made of hands the
[2:08:30] heavens is my throne and the earth is my
[2:08:32] footstool where is the place of my rest
[2:08:35] but a body as thou prepare me
[2:08:39] which body is that
[2:08:42] you have to say it's my body
[2:08:44] it's not good enough to just say it was
[2:08:46] the prophet's body
[2:08:48] it's not good he said to say it so it's
[2:08:49] the pastor's body or the minister's body
[2:08:52] it's your body
[2:08:54] your body you put your name in it you
[2:08:56] claim it it's your body
[2:09:03] he says our body is that prepare me god
[2:09:05] dwells in a stature
[2:09:08] of
[2:09:08] a man
[2:09:11] not in buildings
[2:09:14] the god is here because you brought him
[2:09:16] here
[2:09:20] when we go out of here god is not here
[2:09:26] man wants to go home and love god in the
[2:09:28] building
[2:09:30] i'm serious
[2:09:32] they they have places where they know
[2:09:34] they can find god if i go to church if i
[2:09:37] go in my closet if i go inside if i go
[2:09:39] to the pastor's house then i'll meet god
[2:09:42] no that's not the kind of relationship
[2:09:44] he's looking for he wants to meet you in
[2:09:47] your body where you are wherever you are
[2:09:50] oh that's why you know when when david
[2:09:52] speaks and swami says if i lay my body
[2:09:55] in hell be lo behold they were there why
[2:09:58] is god there because my body is there
[2:10:01] if i go to the extreme part of the fbo
[2:10:04] why because my body is there everywhere
[2:10:06] my body finds itself god is there
[2:10:16] it says
[2:10:17] a man reflecting himself into his being
[2:10:21] perfect worship
[2:10:23] god reflection through the being is the
[2:10:25] perfect worship
[2:10:27] he says god in us
[2:10:29] being the tabernacle
[2:10:32] god manifesting oh
[2:10:34] how much we could stay on this till you
[2:10:37] you would almost suffocate in here oh i
[2:10:40] tell you it's so wonderful there's so
[2:10:42] many angles there's so many things you
[2:10:44] look at it it's always god in its people
[2:10:47] it's always i'll tell you that you can
[2:10:49] read i can try to read the message
[2:10:51] i can undo it i cannot see it every time
[2:10:54] everywhere i look it's always god
[2:10:56] calling i want to dwell in you i want to
[2:10:59] do more in you i want to get you out of
[2:11:01] the things that you are in i want to
[2:11:03] move you further i want i just see i
[2:11:05] cannot see it that's all i see
[2:11:08] and then we gather here if you see
[2:11:10] people that are walking and you asking
[2:11:13] are you seeing what i'm seeing
[2:11:20] god has always all time reflected
[2:11:23] himself
[2:11:25] in man
[2:11:28] but random talks about oh robert now i'm
[2:11:30] going over time now just
[2:11:32] you know i think people like over them
[2:11:36] he said he would pray and he would tell
[2:11:38] people
[2:11:40] wherever you are i want you to touch the
[2:11:42] tv
[2:11:44] and have faith and this touch if you
[2:11:45] have faith that's such a tv
[2:11:48] it says then it will transmit from
[2:11:51] the electricity and
[2:11:53] and come to you
[2:11:56] one of them says i hope you don't have
[2:11:57] to touch nothing
[2:11:59] you don't have to touch nothing
[2:12:02] you have to touch him
[2:12:04] pray to him who's within you
[2:12:08] the only thing you need you don't need
[2:12:09] to touch you don't need the hands of
[2:12:11] somebody upon you if that will help you
[2:12:13] come forth
[2:12:14] right but what you need is to touch him
[2:12:17] is to say i heard your word
[2:12:19] and i believe it with all my heart and
[2:12:22] come and touch my life change my life if
[2:12:25] you need prayer prayer will help you but
[2:12:27] it's he that believes the word
[2:12:30] regardless of how you believe it it's
[2:12:31] the faith in the word that produces it
[2:12:35] he says god's journey in reflection in
[2:12:37] reflection in his people in his people
[2:12:41] so now he says yeah they were talking
[2:12:43] about the building
[2:12:45] building him a temple a house of him to
[2:12:47] dwell but failing to oh this is me that
[2:12:49] wrote by failing to understand that god
[2:12:52] was not interested in some building
[2:12:54] place
[2:12:56] a place where we can come and meet and
[2:12:58] go home and leave him until we come back
[2:13:00] again
[2:13:05] now i want you to see this
[2:13:09] it says here in paragraph 84 it says and
[2:13:11] since that time
[2:13:12] he reflected himself in his church
[2:13:15] this side of calvary so you see we are
[2:13:17] trying to get to this dwelling place the
[2:13:20] tabernacle of living god
[2:13:23] now
[2:13:24] there is some yeah it says now and then
[2:13:26] he continues on to something else
[2:13:29] now i want to say this i thought this
[2:13:32] came through my heart as i was thinking
[2:13:33] about this
[2:13:36] the the scripture speaks in the air we
[2:13:39] are
[2:13:42] the people that were given the word of
[2:13:44] god
[2:13:45] and i want you for a moment to think
[2:13:47] about
[2:13:48] their approach to what was given them
[2:13:52] their approach to the word of god that
[2:13:54] was given
[2:13:55] and the understanding of what was
[2:13:57] supposed to happen
[2:13:59] and
[2:14:00] and for the sake of time it's isaiah 58
[2:14:04] let's start from verse 4.
[2:14:06] and this is god calling for a fast for
[2:14:08] the children of israel telling them that
[2:14:11] you shall fast and things like that now
[2:14:13] i want you to see what the understanding
[2:14:15] of men was versus the understanding of
[2:14:17] god
[2:14:19] in verse 4 it says
[2:14:21] behold ye fast for strife
[2:14:24] and debate and smite with feast of
[2:14:27] wickedness
[2:14:28] ye shall not ye shall not fast as ye do
[2:14:32] this day to make your voice to be heard
[2:14:35] on high
[2:14:37] i want you to think about the reason
[2:14:39] what the understanding of the reason why
[2:14:41] they should be you should be doing it
[2:14:44] it says in five it says
[2:14:46] is this such a fast that i have chosen
[2:14:50] a day where a man will afflict his soul
[2:14:55] it is that the bow down his head
[2:14:58] as a bulrush and to
[2:15:01] to spread sock cloth and ashes
[2:15:04] unto under him
[2:15:06] will thou call this a fast and an
[2:15:08] acceptable day of the lord
[2:15:11] he's asking them a question
[2:15:14] yeah they were they were given a word
[2:15:15] and the word was you should abstain from
[2:15:18] this and do this and
[2:15:20] and do this and
[2:15:21] in fact i can bring it down to us yet we
[2:15:23] are we have been given the message and
[2:15:26] within the body of the message we learn
[2:15:28] everything that is about conduct about
[2:15:31] uh leadership about how we should treat
[2:15:33] one another about the things that we
[2:15:35] should do and everything and here is the
[2:15:37] attitude god has given us a tabernacle
[2:15:39] to worship him a place where we can come
[2:15:42] he's called us so we can come to church
[2:15:44] and and everything and and i want you to
[2:15:47] think this as our attitude when we come
[2:15:49] to church
[2:15:52] when we come to god
[2:15:54] he's asking and says is this the reason
[2:15:56] why you're doing it
[2:15:58] so you can come in such a fast i have
[2:16:00] chosen a day where a man will afflict
[2:16:03] his soul so you come on you're like oh
[2:16:05] it's time to go to church again you know
[2:16:07] you know
[2:16:08] i don't have an option you know if i
[2:16:10] don't show up very jackson will know i'm
[2:16:11] not there you know the pastor will find
[2:16:14] charlie will call me asking me where i
[2:16:15] am you know let's just go you know oh
[2:16:18] you come and you're watching the
[2:16:19] minister and your mind is in everything
[2:16:22] else except what's being said
[2:16:24] oh right now everybody's thinking about
[2:16:26] how the food is going to burn you know
[2:16:28] in all kinds
[2:16:29] it's everything except what's happening
[2:16:35] it's asking them that question but now
[2:16:37] listen to what it says to them in verse
[2:16:39] six it says is it not the fast that i
[2:16:42] have chosen
[2:16:43] to lose the bends of the wicked to undo
[2:16:46] the heavy hearts to let the possess go
[2:16:49] free and naive break every yoke
[2:16:53] are we not coming here to see those that
[2:16:55] are lost restored those that are
[2:16:59] healed those that are healed made right
[2:17:01] and those that have uh have trouble that
[2:17:03] he may come to the lord is this what we
[2:17:06] gathered here for
[2:17:08] what is the message being given to us
[2:17:10] for is it so we can talk about how much
[2:17:12] we know and others don't know is it so
[2:17:14] we can brag about what we know and how
[2:17:16] we can explain the things of god no he's
[2:17:19] saying that focus on the right thing
[2:17:24] it's for a reason
[2:17:26] it's so that those that are lost when
[2:17:28] they come into our midst they can sense
[2:17:31] the presence of the living god they can
[2:17:33] come to a blessing says that i have met
[2:17:35] god i heard that men speak i heard the
[2:17:38] scripture being read i listened to those
[2:17:40] songs and i believe god is in there and
[2:17:42] i want to touch that god
[2:17:44] is it someone is that sick and and
[2:17:47] you're walking on me and said i don't
[2:17:48] care what kind of sicknesses we serve a
[2:17:51] god who's able to heal all that diseases
[2:17:58] let's move to perfection
[2:18:00] and perfection is going back to what was
[2:18:03] in the beginning what was the church of
[2:18:06] pentecost they came and they sold
[2:18:08] everything that they were they came to a
[2:18:10] place where they believed that they were
[2:18:12] gathered there in the name of the lord
[2:18:14] and there's nothing that can stand
[2:18:16] against them
[2:18:20] now our expectation of
[2:18:23] yeah
[2:18:26] i know he can
[2:18:27] but even if he doesn't
[2:18:30] that's not faith
[2:18:32] that's not faith
[2:18:34] that's a weathering faith
[2:18:38] that's not faith that's that's hope so
[2:18:43] but when we come before the living god
[2:18:45] we burn all our bridges
[2:18:47] lord i don't have a way back it's either
[2:18:50] you or it's nothing
[2:18:52] it's either you do it or die
[2:18:55] it's either i go with you or i don't go
[2:18:57] anywhere like moses the lord tell me oh
[2:19:00] go ahead i want you to go forth and do
[2:19:02] this and he says if you're not coming
[2:19:04] with us we're not going
[2:19:08] god said well i'll do this it says i
[2:19:10] want to see your face i want to see you
[2:19:14] it says moses you know you can't see me
[2:19:16] no man has ever seen god and live
[2:19:18] it says i will show me your glory
[2:19:22] my brother my sister it's the heart cry
[2:19:25] of a believer that brings god on the
[2:19:27] scene
[2:19:29] when we come here we have to have an
[2:19:31] expectation that whatever you need is
[2:19:33] this morning whether it be a need for
[2:19:35] you to be more like a christian to you
[2:19:38] to come into but the desire has to be
[2:19:40] there you bring it to god and god will
[2:19:43] perfect it
[2:19:45] he's the beginner
[2:19:47] and he who started the good works
[2:19:50] will finish it
[2:19:52] now remember finishing is perfection
[2:19:57] when moses built us
[2:19:59] when when
[2:20:00] michelangelo puts a scripture
[2:20:03] he brought it to a perfection
[2:20:05] and the perfection was what he saw
[2:20:09] so much
[2:20:10] of what was in his mind
[2:20:13] until he broke it
[2:20:15] he says speak
[2:20:17] and barbara called it the masterpiece
[2:20:23] oh i want to say this morning
[2:20:25] i begin to think about this i said
[2:20:28] he says what kind of house would you
[2:20:30] build me
[2:20:32] i said lord i want to build you one
[2:20:34] i want to build you this morning a house
[2:20:36] full of praises
[2:20:38] i want this house when a man looks at it
[2:20:41] all they can see is the glory of god
[2:20:43] whether i'm going to a good time or a
[2:20:45] bad time i want to lift my hands and
[2:20:47] worship god at all time i want my mouth
[2:20:50] to speak his praises continually i want
[2:20:53] to lift my voice i want to do every bit
[2:20:56] of pray or power every bit of ounce of
[2:20:59] life that i have within this body to
[2:21:01] praise god i want to wake up in the
[2:21:03] morning and say thank you lord jesus i
[2:21:05] want to go and when i meet my neighbor
[2:21:07] tell him about the lord jesus i want
[2:21:09] when i go to work and i see a situation
[2:21:12] that people don't know what to do i want
[2:21:14] to jump in there and say that i know
[2:21:16] someone i want to praise the lord with
[2:21:18] everything that i have in the way that i
[2:21:21] dress in the way that i talk in the way
[2:21:23] that i conduct myself innovative
[2:21:25] everything that i do i want this house
[2:21:27] to be the house of praise of the living
[2:21:30] god let's all stand this morning that's
[2:21:32] the hot desire of a believer it's not to
[2:21:35] be caught up in all kinds of things it's
[2:21:37] not our mind to be filled with oh what i
[2:21:40] should do how am i going to get my bread
[2:21:42] tomorrow yes we go through all of that
[2:21:44] but when all of that is finished
[2:21:46] i want the lord to come and say
[2:21:49] yes i'm pleased with this building
[2:21:52] this is my dwelling place
[2:21:55] that i can come and dwell this morning
[2:21:58] he didn't build you but when it says
[2:22:01] i could just go on and on
[2:22:03] he says
[2:22:05] when you when a person builds a house is
[2:22:08] so they can dwell on it
[2:22:12] you don't build the house to leave it
[2:22:14] empty
[2:22:15] in fact the scripture speaks in the
[2:22:16] gospels how that when an evil spirit is
[2:22:19] cast out you have to fill the house
[2:22:23] fill the house quickly otherwise if you
[2:22:26] leave it empty the enemy that you cast
[2:22:28] down the evil that you cast down he's
[2:22:30] going to go find devils more stronger
[2:22:32] than him to come back
[2:22:35] we've been the demons have been cast out
[2:22:38] of us
[2:22:39] we know that the devil the the lord has
[2:22:41] delivered us of all the things that we
[2:22:43] were in in the world
[2:22:45] and i say
[2:22:46] let's fill this building with this
[2:22:48] goodness
[2:22:49] let's fill every fiber of our body with
[2:22:51] him
[2:22:52] so he can come and dwell in us
[2:22:55] let's just buy a heads
[2:22:57] our gracious father we're so thankful
[2:22:59] this morning
[2:22:59] [Music]
[2:23:03] god's dwelling place
[2:23:06] you said you don't dwell in building
[2:23:08] builds of men
[2:23:11] but a body as i prepare me
[2:23:14] the scripture says know ye not that your
[2:23:16] body is the temple of the lord
[2:23:19] [Music]
[2:23:21] father this morning we've used that
[2:23:23] temple for all kinds of things except
[2:23:25] you lord
[2:23:27] we ask you to forgive us father
[2:23:30] we asked this morning that you renew us
[2:23:32] oh god
[2:23:34] that we may cast out everything that's
[2:23:36] in the building and and bring you back
[2:23:38] in
[2:23:41] that everything else that we've used it
[2:23:43] for that you may put it aside oh god
[2:23:46] that you may come and dwell in it lord
[2:23:48] we commit what we are into your hands
[2:23:50] we're so thankful to be your children
[2:23:54] lord if you've called us to be perfect
[2:23:56] it's because you have made us perfect
[2:23:59] the scripture says when you look at us
[2:24:01] the prophet told us when you look at us
[2:24:04] through the blood of your son jesus we
[2:24:06] look perfect
[2:24:08] be with us leaders and guide us this
[2:24:10] morning bless the sick and afflicted
[2:24:12] touch him and heal lord if there be any
[2:24:13] need represented this morning
