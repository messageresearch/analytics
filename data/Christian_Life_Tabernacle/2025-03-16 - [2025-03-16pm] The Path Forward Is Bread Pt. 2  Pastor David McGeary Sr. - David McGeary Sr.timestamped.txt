[37:03] let's open our Bibles again to just that
[37:05] little verse in Matthew 4 and4 and and
[37:10] just to
[37:12] uh reset and just move a little forward
[37:16] in the good things of the
[37:21] Lord and it says in Matthew 4 and4 but
[37:24] he answered and said it is written man
[37:27] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[37:31] every word that proceedeth out of the
[37:34] mouth of God Amen living by every word
[37:39] God bless you you may be
[37:41] seated
[37:43] amen oh this looks like about an ice
[37:45] cream crowd tonight doesn't it to me
[37:49] well I guess we put the ultimatum out
[37:51] didn't we like who wants to
[37:54] follow well you know what so you know
[37:58] that that's okay can you can you you
[38:01] know we know it's not going to be many
[38:03] anyway right so I mean just pick
[38:06] somebody that's not here and put them
[38:09] out of the
[38:10] boat no we draw a bigger Circle don't we
[38:14] so anyway we're happy to be here in the
[38:16] house of the Lord because we love God's
[38:19] word and and I there there's a uh um
[38:25] just a just to continue with a little
[38:28] thought uh something that so blessed me
[38:32] out of this message and I just wanted to
[38:34] read the statement again but I I'd like
[38:38] just to uh uh just take uh uh another uh
[38:45] scripture here that reads and Jesus said
[38:48] now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when
[38:53] its branches yet tender and put it forth
[38:56] leaves you know that summer is nigh so
[39:01] likewise when ye shall see all these
[39:04] things know ye it's near even at the
[39:09] door verily verily I say unto you this
[39:14] generation shall not pass till all these
[39:18] things shall be fulfilled Heaven and
[39:21] Earth shall pass away but my words shall
[39:25] not pass away way and and you know I I
[39:30] truly believe that every word of God
[39:33] every promise he made is
[39:36] true that we can count on it um and you
[39:41] know uh uh you know like healing and so
[39:47] many things it it's for believers
[39:50] healing is for believers and and we we
[39:54] know that that all men don't have faith
[39:57] we understand that uh Salvation though
[40:00] it's for all men it's in one way in
[40:04] another way it's not for all people uh
[40:08] they just can't find it within them to
[40:11] accept it but you know faith is Peter
[40:16] says it's by these great and precious
[40:19] promises that we're partakers of divine
[40:24] nature and faith is what pleases God in
[40:27] the believer that to have faith you you
[40:31] must have faith that believes God and I
[40:34] I I just like to read this statement out
[40:37] of the message the unfailing words of
[40:41] Promise his unfailing words of Promise
[40:44] because we know if God said it it's got
[40:47] to happen it's true that's one thing uh
[40:51] that God can't do you know you don't
[40:54] hear very many statements that God can't
[40:56] do this and God can't do that but uh uh
[41:00] uh one of the great writers was so moved
[41:03] it said that God cannot lie and so he
[41:06] swore he swore by
[41:09] himself that he can't lie so he can't
[41:12] make a promise that won't come to
[41:17] pass and and that's what that that's
[41:21] what our our resting place is so faith
[41:24] has got to have a resting place so it's
[41:28] it it it seeks Faith seeks for something
[41:33] that it can hold on to uh something that
[41:36] it trust it's it's built upon something
[41:40] and we know that Faith cometh by hearing
[41:44] and hearing by the word of God and the
[41:47] prophet of God puts it this way he says
[41:51] faith is by hearing the
[41:55] word Okay so uh and so faith is by
[41:59] hearing the word but then he adds this
[42:01] little portion to it which I think is a
[42:05] exciting he says the Word of
[42:08] Promise so Faith cometh by hearing the
[42:12] word The Word of Promise well you can
[42:15] read in the scripture uh many scriptures
[42:19] a historical uh Chronicles and events of
[42:23] the king and and those things are true
[42:26] facts it would be like reading a history
[42:28] book you know George Washington crossed
[42:31] the Delaware well my heart doesn't swell
[42:35] up with faith when I hear that George
[42:39] Washington crossed the Delaware that
[42:42] that's a a a fact if I could say that
[42:46] well our faith isn't rested on the fact
[42:50] but it's rested in a promise so that's
[42:54] where that's where faith has to Anchor
[42:57] it's got to have something that anchor
[42:59] to it's got to have something that it
[43:02] knows is going to respond to it and and
[43:07] and that's what God's promise is it it's
[43:10] the response to you hearing his promise
[43:15] and and accepting that promise and
[43:17] believing that promise and now this is a
[43:20] a
[43:21] tremendous uh statement here if we could
[43:24] just take a moment before we all go have
[43:27] have ice cream it said if you don't have
[43:30] a promise then you're venturing out upon
[43:35] your own
[43:37] faith now now just think of that if if
[43:40] you don't have a promise you're you're
[43:43] you're trying to make it on your own and
[43:46] a lot of people they want things they
[43:49] want things to happen they want things
[43:51] to change they want things to transpire
[43:54] they want things to be different and and
[43:57] then it becomes a hope they they Venture
[44:00] after it without a promise they don't
[44:03] have a promise for the result they don't
[44:06] have something that they can hold on to
[44:09] that knows that the result's coming the
[44:12] result isn't coming by hearing the word
[44:17] the word brings faith in the promised
[44:21] word that he said
[44:23] so that's what your faith is rested it's
[44:26] rest ing in what he said what he
[44:29] promised he promised if you confess your
[44:32] sins that he'd be faithful and just to
[44:35] forgive
[44:36] them that's a
[44:39] promise now can you imagine confessing
[44:42] your sins and not knowing whether he
[44:43] forgives them or
[44:46] not but if you believe
[44:50] that if you believe that promise that he
[44:53] said if you confess your sins that he
[44:57] he'll be faithful and just to forgive
[44:59] him then when you confess your sins you
[45:02] know that they're
[45:05] forgiven it's it's not a hope so it's
[45:08] not a wondering it you know and and he
[45:12] goes on to say this and he
[45:16] says he says but if you can take a
[45:19] promise of God that's God's promise to
[45:24] you
[45:27] so what are what's your faith in my
[45:29] faith is in the word of God my faith is
[45:32] in the promise that he made to me that
[45:37] he made this promise and and if he made
[45:41] this promise then I can uh what what are
[45:45] what's your confidence in what what what
[45:47] are you resting in I'm resting in the
[45:50] fact that God can't promise it and then
[45:53] not perform it
[45:57] now I can reject the
[45:59] promise or I can say the promise is not
[46:03] for
[46:04] me or that promis is for somebody else
[46:08] but once I take possession of that
[46:11] promise now I've got faith because my
[46:14] faith has a resting place and that
[46:17] resting place is the promise of God I
[46:19] said I believe that God promised
[46:22] me he promised me he wouldn't leave me
[46:27] nor forsake me but he'd be with me even
[46:31] in me till the end that's a promise now
[46:35] I don't have I I can't undo that
[46:41] promise unbelief doesn't stop
[46:45] God if you believe God and you take God
[46:48] at this ear he will perform that promise
[46:51] I've seen God give people the very
[46:54] things they prayed for and asked for and
[46:57] they turned it
[47:01] down they didn't stick with it they
[47:04] didn't hold to it they weren't
[47:06] persevering but I want to go a little
[47:08] someplace with this just real
[47:11] quick
[47:13] because there there's we are we are up
[47:17] to up up against such a great challenge
[47:20] in this hour that it that it would cause
[47:23] us to shrink back but we've got to know
[47:26] that that we have a promise and so he
[47:29] says now he said look listen to this he
[47:32] says the woman that touched His Garment
[47:35] had no promise of
[47:38] that there was no promise in the Bible
[47:41] that said If You Touch the Hem of His
[47:42] Garment you shall be
[47:45] healed now we have a
[47:47] promise we have a promise if we Touch
[47:50] the Hem of His Garment that we be healed
[47:53] why because if he does it for one he'll
[47:56] do it for for
[47:57] everyone so we have that word so now we
[48:01] have that promised word it's precept
[48:04] upon precept line upon line promise upon
[48:08] promise so now we know that if You Reach
[48:11] Out And Touch the Hem of His Garment
[48:13] he'll heal
[48:14] you so you say well how do I know that
[48:17] because we we have the promise if he
[48:20] ever does one thing one time he'll do it
[48:23] the same if a man meets God on the same
[48:26] condition God will provide the same
[48:28] answer every time because he's an
[48:31] unchangeable God I am God and I change
[48:36] not so that that's what a Believer does
[48:40] he starts taking the building stones of
[48:43] God's word and he lays for himself a
[48:46] Cornerstone and Jesus Christ being that
[48:48] Chief Cornerstone he builds upon it let
[48:51] every man watch how he
[48:55] builds so we could we can start
[48:59] walking by
[49:01] promise that's what God desires his
[49:04] church to do is to walk by promise so
[49:07] she didn't even have a promise of
[49:09] that she said he said but her faith
[49:14] without a promise got her
[49:17] healed now if she could get her healing
[49:21] by her faith without a promise in what
[49:25] she was doing how much more ought we to
[49:29] get our healing by faith in a promise
[49:33] that God is manifesting and vindicating
[49:37] before
[49:38] us and has brought it to us by his word
[49:46] come around and confirm his
[49:50] word now is God a respector of
[49:53] persons certainly not
[49:56] if he heals one he'll heal the
[50:04] other oh that's a
[50:08] promise he said there's only one thing
[50:11] you have to do is appropriate that faith
[50:16] and that faith is something that you
[50:18] know not something you Ponder or guess
[50:22] at you know it something happens now
[50:25] Through the Ages people have rested upon
[50:29] this now so I'm not approaching this
[50:33] from Divine
[50:35] Healing and because we know God's A
[50:38] Healer we have a lot of evidence that
[50:42] God's A
[50:43] Healer I'm approaching it from the
[50:46] promise that God said that he'd have a
[50:48] church without spot or without
[50:54] wrinkle now that's a promise
[50:59] and when I look in the
[51:00] mirror I see
[51:03] spots and I see
[51:06] wrinkles now what am I going to look
[51:10] at it's what I'm going what am I going
[51:12] to focus on what what am what am I want
[51:17] to be I want to be different so if I
[51:20] could say it this way I want to be well
[51:23] I want to be spiritually well I I want
[51:27] to live according to the promises of
[51:30] God's word I want to be victorious
[51:33] everything that he's talking and
[51:36] describing his church that she will be
[51:40] is a
[51:41] promise that's right he said she will be
[51:45] this way she will be one with him she'll
[51:49] be one with the word she she she won't
[51:54] compromise she won't do all these things
[51:57] now I could take all those things and
[52:00] and allow those things con to condemn
[52:04] me or I could look at those things and
[52:07] said this is a promise to
[52:12] me and if God promised it he'll fulfill
[52:16] it and he'll fulfill it in me I believe
[52:21] that I appropriate the faith that he
[52:25] speaking
[52:27] of
[52:28] me and now if if he promised to do that
[52:32] so we understand that that it the same
[52:36] things that we use so many times for
[52:40] healing of the
[52:42] flesh are the same
[52:45] basis by which we heal our
[52:48] Spirits we heal our lives we
[52:53] overcome if there's something in your
[52:55] life you know is contrary to the word
[52:58] and you're paddling in it and you don't
[53:00] want it to be there how how are you
[53:03] going to to uh deliver it and have
[53:08] deliverance from it without a
[53:12] promise you're venturing out on your own
[53:15] faith but if you know you have a
[53:19] promise that the bride wouldn't have
[53:22] this in your
[53:23] life then you know that that promise is
[53:27] given to you you can look forward to
[53:31] that Deliverance you can speak that
[53:34] Deliverance you can claim that
[53:36] Deliverance because God has the power to
[53:42] transform that's what we're
[53:45] trusting you say well I don't I don't
[53:49] have it I have it by
[53:53] promise if you have it by promise it's
[53:56] just just as good as being in your
[53:58] pocket it's like someone gave you two
[54:01] quars for a loaf of bread you can walk
[54:04] down the road grab those two quarters
[54:06] and say see my loaf of
[54:08] bread cuz you know by
[54:11] promise that those two quarters are
[54:14] going to be transformed into a loaf of
[54:16] bread that's what they were given for
[54:19] that's what they're going to perform
[54:22] that's what they're going to
[54:24] do and the believer can can look at that
[54:28] and and he can realize that and so God
[54:32] makes all kinds of uh uh his whole book
[54:36] is is his Covenant with man it's his
[54:40] promises to
[54:42] man both good and
[54:45] bad I promise you if you do this and you
[54:48] do this and you do this you won't this
[54:50] won't happen but I also promise you if
[54:54] you do this and you do this and you do
[54:56] this this will happen everything with
[54:58] God is based on his
[55:01] word but not just his word as we look at
[55:06] it as the Bible but the words of Promise
[55:11] his his his his words of Promise they're
[55:15] unfailing words of Promise they will not
[55:19] fail and then when we read because
[55:23] because I I believe that the the the
[55:26] signs of his coming are are are
[55:29] so uh just so
[55:33] evident around
[55:35] us the condition of man the condition of
[55:38] the world the the uh the the the hatred
[55:44] that they have we were talking with some
[55:47] brothers and they were telling
[55:50] me uh and they were telling me about a
[55:54] couple that was taking their way wedding
[55:57] vows that they had been married for or
[56:00] not married but what do you call it
[56:02] courting um engaged for two
[56:07] years and and they came to the Altar and
[56:11] and and uh uh the the they were going to
[56:15] take their vows and they came to the
[56:17] lady and they said uh will you do this
[56:21] and she saidou know she said I can't
[56:26] and he he looked back he said you know
[56:31] and
[56:32] and I don't know what it was it was
[56:35] maybe his stance on a certain social
[56:39] issue of the day you know uh you know
[56:43] the way that you feel about a certain
[56:46] political
[56:48] view and I thought two and a half
[56:53] years you've been courting and all of a
[56:56] sudden you decide you can't marry this
[56:59] person because of a political view like
[57:03] saying I can't marry you because you're
[57:05] a Republican and I'm a
[57:10] Democrat one
[57:12] thing they they've lost
[57:15] it it's it it
[57:19] it's since when did that ever have
[57:23] anything to do with anything
[57:28] you know how if you vote you you notice
[57:32] you can't go into that voting booth with
[57:35] anybody but
[57:37] yourself I didn't tell the lady at the
[57:40] voting booth I'm going to go in with my
[57:42] wife to make sure she votes the way that
[57:44] I vote else we're getting a
[57:50] divorce I mean it the things have have
[57:54] got so ins
[57:57] significant and and and and so
[58:02] deceptive and like I told you before I
[58:06] remember boy when the election was on
[58:08] and all of a sudden KLA Harris is
[58:10] running for president and and the polls
[58:13] were saying that she was leading all the
[58:16] Believers are going oh woman president
[58:18] that's exactly what brother Brandon
[58:20] promised oh oh say he prophesied and oh
[58:23] now we're we're we're at the end time
[58:25] now and and boy I better get right with
[58:28] God and then and then November 7th come
[58:31] along and and uh everybody
[58:35] goes the world's not going to end yes it
[58:40] is nothing's
[58:43] changed the devil just put on a
[58:45] different
[58:49] face what are they what's what are they
[58:51] saying now peace and safety I'll have
[58:54] peace I'll have problem Prosperity I'll
[58:57] have this yay peace prosperity and and
[59:01] what's the promise then sudden
[59:06] destruction you think that we got a new
[59:09] savior in
[59:12] town he ain't saving
[59:16] nothing a prophet told me this country
[59:19] was
[59:20] gone he told me it was morally bankrupt
[59:24] he told me there was no turning
[59:31] back you think oh well we got four
[59:35] years so where are we at
[59:38] now one guy does four years the next guy
[59:41] undoes
[59:42] it and then what's going to
[59:46] happen in the next four
[59:49] years I'll tell you I'd anchor in Jesus
[59:53] Christ I would anchor in a promise
[59:57] I would find a promise what did he
[1:00:01] promise
[1:00:02] me and so I I thought of this statement
[1:00:05] that we heard this morning and if you
[1:00:08] would turn with me because I just want
[1:00:10] to read uh the scriptures found in St
[1:00:15] John the 17th chapter and and our
[1:00:18] messenger put it to us this way this
[1:00:21] morning he said Jesus said that they may
[1:00:26] be one father as you and I are
[1:00:32] one not for some man to be over
[1:00:35] something it never will
[1:00:39] work it'll never
[1:00:42] work if you're in a fellowship you're in
[1:00:45] a church you're in something where uh uh
[1:00:48] in Christian Life where one man's over
[1:00:51] another man you know by God's word it's
[1:00:54] not going to work we are put here on
[1:00:57] free moral agency we are put here to
[1:01:00] choose and there's something in you that
[1:01:03] chooses God's
[1:01:06] word nobody can fear you in to living
[1:01:10] for
[1:01:13] God all fear does is cause you to do it
[1:01:17] in
[1:01:19] secret but if you have the Holy Spirit
[1:01:22] convicting you in your heart he'll
[1:01:25] separate sear at you from the things
[1:01:28] that aren't of him he will do that for
[1:01:32] you well listen what he said I thought
[1:01:35] it was
[1:01:38] fantastic he said it'll never
[1:01:42] work one denomination wants to take over
[1:01:45] the other and one man over another
[1:01:50] one but that you might be one with God
[1:01:55] like like Christ and God was one that's
[1:02:00] what the prayer
[1:02:03] is that's what the prayer
[1:02:07] is he said that was the word and Jesus
[1:02:14] prayed that we might be the word
[1:02:19] reflecting
[1:02:21] him that's what he prayed for that's his
[1:02:25] prayer PR to be
[1:02:29] answered now when I read that I thought
[1:02:33] wait a
[1:02:35] minute that was his
[1:02:38] prayer that I and the father might be
[1:02:42] one that was his prayer for
[1:02:46] me not only
[1:02:49] one but one as he was one with the
[1:02:54] father that there's a
[1:02:57] union an invisible Union between the
[1:03:01] Earthly uh uh bride in the Heavenly
[1:03:06] bridegroom that there's a Oneness that
[1:03:09] there's something that's promised to me
[1:03:12] it doesn't matter my
[1:03:16] condition if I have the promise the
[1:03:20] promise prevails over my condition
[1:03:29] and it's not a
[1:03:32] fact I could take John Beal here I could
[1:03:35] say John Beal's worth 10 million he's
[1:03:39] worth millions and millions that's a
[1:03:43] fact but if I said John Beal promised me
[1:03:47] any time I needed a million I would have
[1:03:50] it that's
[1:03:54] different ain't that right John now I
[1:03:57] ain't bankrupt
[1:04:00] now I got a million sitting right
[1:04:04] there I also have ocean front property
[1:04:07] to sell in
[1:04:12] Arizona that's closer to the
[1:04:19] promise you see what I'm trying to say
[1:04:22] see it's it's the promise that makes all
[1:04:25] the
[1:04:26] difference it isn't the fact in other
[1:04:30] words to say God Is A
[1:04:33] Healer that's the same as me saying John
[1:04:36] has 10
[1:04:39] million but when I can say
[1:04:42] God has promised me my
[1:04:47] healing then I'm not basing it on the
[1:04:50] fact that God can
[1:04:53] heal I'm not basing it on the fact that
[1:04:56] he's a
[1:04:57] Healer my my faith isn't in the fact
[1:05:00] that God's A Healer my faith is not in
[1:05:03] the fact that God's capable of doing all
[1:05:06] things my faith isn't in the fact that
[1:05:08] history has said that he's a Healer my
[1:05:12] faith is in the fact that he promised me
[1:05:15] my healing it's my promise he promised
[1:05:20] me now my faith is in the promise not in
[1:05:24] the fact
[1:05:26] because the promise is the
[1:05:31] power he'll do
[1:05:33] it because he said though he said he'd
[1:05:36] heal my
[1:05:37] kids he would save my
[1:05:40] children but he Satan put that one to
[1:05:43] the
[1:05:46] test Dave's not here so I'll just tell
[1:05:50] on
[1:05:51] them and there's not very many of you
[1:05:53] here so you probably won't remember
[1:05:55] anyway you know but he he got in trouble
[1:06:00] you know
[1:06:01] so they took him to the city
[1:06:05] clink and uh so he's sitting in the city
[1:06:08] clink and he decides to he decided to
[1:06:12] let him
[1:06:13] go so they release
[1:06:16] him well he still got his City
[1:06:20] clink uniform
[1:06:22] on so off the school he goes
[1:06:29] right in this class uless
[1:06:32] jail how long do you think that
[1:06:37] lasted you say boy that kid's
[1:06:39] doomed
[1:06:41] uh-uh I had a
[1:06:46] promise I had a
[1:06:49] promise and one day he got
[1:06:52] converted and one day we're sitting
[1:06:55] there in a grandstand and one of his
[1:06:58] teachers leans over and says are you
[1:07:01] David
[1:07:03] McGary and he says yes he said I saw the
[1:07:07] difference in you when you gave your
[1:07:10] life to the Lord and it was an
[1:07:12] inspiration to
[1:07:16] me what
[1:07:18] prevailed the promise it didn't care
[1:07:21] what Satan did it didn't care what
[1:07:23] Matthew did or Aaron did or any of them
[1:07:26] did that wasn't what I was basing it on
[1:07:29] it wasn't they they could have written a
[1:07:32] Litany of
[1:07:35] things but they all preach the gospel
[1:07:39] today
[1:07:42] why cuz I did something no cuz I raised
[1:07:47] them right no because I had a
[1:07:52] promise now was God a savior
[1:07:56] it's always been a
[1:08:00] savior is he a Healer he's always been a
[1:08:04] Healer is he a deliverer he's always
[1:08:06] been a
[1:08:07] deliverer but as long as they remain
[1:08:12] facts they sit on the
[1:08:15] Shelf but when you take them off the
[1:08:17] shelf as a
[1:08:20] promise then it's the promise that
[1:08:24] empowers
[1:08:25] the word it's the promise behind the
[1:08:29] word that gives it its Eternal
[1:08:35] result you know I have someone that
[1:08:37] every time they do something they say
[1:08:39] I'm
[1:08:40] sorry I said well you were supposed to
[1:08:42] be here I'm
[1:08:44] sorry and I said you know did you do
[1:08:46] this no I'm sorry and finally one day I
[1:08:50] asked him I said wait a minute is that a
[1:08:52] statement of fact or a statement of
[1:08:54] contrition
[1:08:57] are you telling me you're
[1:09:01] sorry you understand what I mean when I
[1:09:04] say
[1:09:05] that it got to the point where all he's
[1:09:09] saying is I'm a sorry
[1:09:13] person I'm
[1:09:15] sorry I'm sorry I'm no good I'm sorry
[1:09:18] but obviously it wasn't a state of
[1:09:21] Contrition because if you repent of
[1:09:24] something then there should be change
[1:09:28] following but if you just keep saying
[1:09:30] I'm sorry I'm sorry with no mink for
[1:09:33] repentance no nothing changes nothing
[1:09:37] does there's no effort put forth I'm
[1:09:39] sorry just becomes a statement of fact
[1:09:42] you might as well just put a sign on
[1:09:43] your back says I'm a sorry
[1:09:45] person I am
[1:09:48] sorry not
[1:09:50] apologetic just plain sorry because
[1:09:53] there's no apology in it
[1:09:56] if you're sorry you try to change you
[1:10:00] try to put something
[1:10:01] forth now we have a
[1:10:05] promise and the prophet of God placed it
[1:10:09] like this he said St John 17 was Jesus's
[1:10:14] prayer to be
[1:10:18] answered now all of a sudden this prayer
[1:10:22] becomes a
[1:10:23] promise to me
[1:10:26] and it it this this is marvelous you
[1:10:31] know many times when we we read the
[1:10:34] scripture and we'll take it and where
[1:10:37] Jesus says they said teach us to pray he
[1:10:40] said pray like this our father but you
[1:10:42] know another way to learn to pray is go
[1:10:46] to the
[1:10:47] example of him
[1:10:52] praying and let's just read these
[1:10:54] prayers and close
[1:10:58] these
[1:10:59] words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes
[1:11:04] to heaven and
[1:11:07] said father the hour is come glorify thy
[1:11:14] son that thy son Also may
[1:11:19] glorify thee
[1:11:25] as thou hath given him Power Over All
[1:11:30] Flesh that he should give eternal life
[1:11:34] to as many as thou Hast given
[1:11:37] him and this is life
[1:11:42] eternal that they might Know Thee the
[1:11:46] only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou
[1:11:51] Hast sent I have glorified thee on Earth
[1:11:56] I have finished the work which thou
[1:12:00] givest me to do and now oh
[1:12:04] Father glorify thou me with thy own
[1:12:09] self with the glory which I had with
[1:12:13] thee before the world
[1:12:16] was I have manifested thy name unto the
[1:12:21] men which thou givest me out of the
[1:12:26] world thine they were and thou givest
[1:12:30] them me and they have kept my
[1:12:35] word now they have known that all things
[1:12:40] whatsoever thou hath given
[1:12:42] me are of thee that's right for I have
[1:12:46] given unto them thy Words which thou
[1:12:50] givest me and they have received them
[1:12:54] and have known surely that I came out
[1:12:58] from thee and they have believed that
[1:13:02] thou did send me I pray for them I pray
[1:13:07] not for the world but for them which
[1:13:11] thou Hast given me for they are thine
[1:13:16] all mine are thine and all thine are
[1:13:20] mine and I am glorified in them and now
[1:13:25] now I'm going and now I am no more in
[1:13:29] the world but these are in the world and
[1:13:34] I come to thee Holy
[1:13:37] Father keep through thine own name Those
[1:13:42] whom thou haast given me that they may
[1:13:46] be one as we are one keep me father that
[1:13:54] now becomes a promised to
[1:13:56] me keep me
[1:13:59] Father keep
[1:14:03] me I want to be
[1:14:08] kept while I was with them in the world
[1:14:12] I kept them in thy name those that thou
[1:14:17] given me I have kept and none of them is
[1:14:20] lost but the son of predition that the
[1:14:24] scriptures might be fulfilled and now
[1:14:28] come I to thee and these things I speak
[1:14:33] in the world that they might have my joy
[1:14:37] fulfilled in themselves these are things
[1:14:40] that he's praying for okay so now I look
[1:14:43] at this now I've got a promise Jesus is
[1:14:46] praying for
[1:14:47] me he's asking the father that I can be
[1:14:52] one now you say here I I said I'm a
[1:14:59] sorry individual with all kinds of
[1:15:02] shortcomings temper anger fly off the

[1:15:28] answered oh something's getting out of
[1:15:31] my hands you understand God's doing

[1:18:33] that'll overcome for
[1:18:37] me he gave the promise to bring my
[1:18:44] victory he didn't command me to get the
[1:18:47] victory he command in me to believe his
[1:18:51] promises these great and precious
[1:18:55] promises allow us to be partakers of
[1:18:59] divine nature of the attributes of God
[1:19:02] let's just finish quickly it
[1:19:06] said that they may be one as we are
[1:19:11] one and now I come to thee and these
[1:19:14] things I speak in the world that they
[1:19:17] might have my joy fulfilled in
[1:19:21] themselves I have given them Thy Word
[1:19:26] and the world hath hated them because
[1:19:29] they are not of the world even as I am
[1:19:35] not of the world and I pray not that
[1:19:39] thou should us take them out of the
[1:19:41] world but that thou should us keep them
[1:19:46] from the
[1:19:48] evil oh God you prayed for me that you
[1:19:52] would keep me from the evil Lord Lord I
[1:19:55] I know you'll get me through this I know
[1:19:58] I can overcome this I know you'll keep
[1:20:01] me from the evil Jesus prayed for
[1:20:05] me they are not of the world even as I
[1:20:09] am not of the world sanctify them
[1:20:13] through thy truth Thy word is truth
[1:20:18] another promise as thou Hast sent me
[1:20:21] into the world even so have I also sent
[1:20:25] them into the world and for their sake I
[1:20:28] Sanctified myself that they also might
[1:20:31] be Sanctified through the truth neither
[1:20:35] pray I for these alone but for them also
[1:20:40] which Shall Believe on me through their
[1:20:47] word Oh my he just made it all personal
[1:20:52] didn't he it's all personal now now
[1:20:54] these become unfailing words of promise
[1:20:58] to
[1:21:00] me you say I got a bad habit I got a
[1:21:04] promise for that
[1:21:06] habit I've got some real weaknesses I I
[1:21:10] I've been going to church a long time
[1:21:12] and I have just a lot of things that
[1:21:14] just ain't right I got a
[1:21:17] promise that he can transform me he can
[1:21:21] change me he can make me right he can
[1:21:24] give me the victory he promised because
[1:21:28] he promised he would have a
[1:21:32] bride he promised that she would be
[1:21:35] there she promised and he
[1:21:39] promised that this elect lady would come
[1:21:43] on the scene and because he promised it
[1:21:47] it'll come to pass it doesn't come to
[1:21:50] pass because of the promise or because
[1:21:54] they believe the promise they believe
[1:21:56] the promise because he already brought
[1:21:58] it to pass I don't know if I can express
[1:22:02] that to you the way that I want to
[1:22:04] express it but God's Word of Promise is
[1:22:09] unfailing it's
[1:22:11] unfailing and what he asks for is
[1:22:13] unfailing so he's going to
[1:22:16] Calvary and he's saying father I'm going
[1:22:18] to go lay my life down I'm going to
[1:22:21] fulfill the work here are the things
[1:22:23] that I'm asking asking you to do this is
[1:22:27] what I'm laying my life down for that
[1:22:31] you keep those that were thine they're
[1:22:34] mine that you keep them from the world
[1:22:38] that you put the joy in them that we
[1:22:41] have that they become one that was what
[1:22:44] his whole promise to the church is
[1:22:48] that's where God's path is taking us is
[1:22:51] into this fellowship with the father
[1:22:54] this is a promise to us and man's still
[1:22:58] trying to do
[1:23:00] it through the law and keeping
[1:23:05] rules and trying to think that oh if if
[1:23:10] I I got if I if I miss one offering or I
[1:23:14] miss a service or I do this or I do oh
[1:23:17] I'm
[1:23:18] out or you're
[1:23:22] out that's not what I heard heard I
[1:23:26] heard all the father hath given me had
[1:23:28] come and if your name's on the Lamb's
[1:23:31] Book of Life nothing can put it on and
[1:23:34] nothing can take it off that's a promise
[1:23:37] I am not going to ever be able to hold
[1:23:42] the law in my heart through
[1:23:47] fear but I can live the law Naturally by
[1:23:51] love
[1:23:55] I can do it
[1:23:57] naturally with the love of the Lord for
[1:24:00] all that he done for me it just becomes
[1:24:03] our reasonable service and I I just love
[1:24:08] that so much he says neither I pray for
[1:24:11] these alone but for them which also
[1:24:14] Shall Believe on me through the word
[1:24:17] that they all may be one as thou father
[1:24:22] art in me and I in thee that they also
[1:24:28] may be one in us that the world may
[1:24:33] believe that thou hath sent me and the
[1:24:37] glory which
[1:24:41] thou gavest me I have given them that
[1:24:46] they may be one even as we are one i in
[1:24:52] them thou in me that they may be made
[1:24:57] perfect in one and that the world may
[1:25:01] know that thou haast sent me and hath
[1:25:05] loved them as thou ha loved me father I
[1:25:09] will that they also whom thou givest me
[1:25:14] be with me where I am that they may
[1:25:18] behold my glory which thou haast given
[1:25:21] me for thou ha lovest me before the
[1:25:25] foundation of the world oh righteous
[1:25:28] father the world hath not known thee but
[1:25:32] I have known thee and these have known
[1:25:36] that thou has sent me and I have
[1:25:38] declared unto them thy name and will
[1:25:42] declare it that the love wherein thou
[1:25:46] Hast loved me may be in them and
[1:25:52] I in them
[1:25:55] he ends this prayer with the
[1:25:59] Capstone if you want a
[1:26:02] vision of your the path forward it's
[1:26:06] promised to
[1:26:09] us it's believing the unfailing Word of
[1:26:14] Promise believing what he promised
[1:26:17] knowing that he promised to have this
[1:26:20] elect lady that he was going to have
[1:26:23] this bride word that she was going to be
[1:26:25] one and that the love that they have was
[1:26:29] going to bind together he said that they
[1:26:31] all may be
[1:26:34] one can you imagine we've got lots of
[1:26:37] different churches in
[1:26:40] town do we really want everybody in town
[1:26:44] to come
[1:26:46] here I
[1:26:52] don't but they're all my brothers
[1:26:55] they're all my
[1:26:57] sisters I'll Fellowship them where we
[1:27:03] agree I'll Fellowship him with the blood
[1:27:06] I'll Fellowship him in the baptism of
[1:27:08] the Holy Spirit I'll Fellowship him in
[1:27:10] works I'll Fellowship them with un
[1:27:13] sanctification wherever they want to
[1:27:15] Fellowship I'm willing to
[1:27:17] Fellowship I just want to be
[1:27:19] one I want the love that the father have
[1:27:24] the way that he loved them and laid his
[1:27:28] life down for them even though they
[1:27:30] don't have the Revelation I didn't come
[1:27:33] upon the revelations God gave me the
[1:27:37] Revelation I never figured out that God
[1:27:40] sent a prophet I never opened my Bible
[1:27:43] one day and read Malachi 4:5 and said
[1:27:45] that's William Mariam random I'll prove
[1:27:47] it to you
[1:27:49] uh-uh he had to bring it my way he had
[1:27:52] to open my eyes to it he had to let me
[1:27:55] see it I sat right with people that sat
[1:27:58] and listened to the same tape I listened
[1:28:00] to some got up and walked away in
[1:28:03] another state as true to it as could
[1:28:05] be it's
[1:28:09] election he chose
[1:28:11] me you have not chosen me I have chosen
[1:28:15] you and all the father hath given me
[1:28:19] will
[1:28:19] come I'm not the
[1:28:22] divider of the sheeps and
[1:28:26] goats right right I don't I don't have
[1:28:29] to know who's a goat and who's a
[1:28:32] sheep me being a Christian is in
[1:28:39] me if God doesn't have any respect to
[1:28:42] persons and I'm supposed to be one like
[1:28:44] him then I shouldn't have a respector a
[1:28:48] person I'll call Sin Sin and I'll call
[1:28:52] the devil the devil
[1:28:55] but as far as people you know I never
[1:28:58] heard brother brand come up and somebody
[1:29:00] come up in the Prine say are you a
[1:29:02] Methodist are you a Baptist are you a
[1:29:05] Pentecostal what are
[1:29:08] you he'd ask me if they
[1:29:11] believed do you believe that I'm God's
[1:29:13] servant do you believe that I'm God's
[1:29:17] Prophet you believe if the spirit tells
[1:29:20] you what's wrong with you would you
[1:29:22] believe that it's him
[1:29:25] look at what he was trying to get him to
[1:29:28] see and here
[1:29:30] tonight we have a
[1:29:33] promise that God is going to call out a
[1:29:37] bride that he has a prayer that he
[1:29:41] prayed in the garden that we would be
[1:29:44] one with him that the love where in he
[1:29:48] loved him would be in us and that we
[1:29:53] we'd be one and the joy that we had
[1:29:56] would be one and he prayed that prayer
[1:29:59] and the prophet of God says that prayer
[1:30:02] has to be answered it's the prayer to be
[1:30:08] answered and I lift my hand and I say
[1:30:11] I'm
[1:30:12] sorry and I am
[1:30:15] sorry but I've got a
[1:30:19] promise and that promise is going to
[1:30:22] transform me from Death un life from a
[1:30:26] liar to a truth speaker from a luster to
[1:30:30] loving from from doing what's right from
[1:30:33] being nervous to being full of Faith to
[1:30:37] being suspicious to having confidence
[1:30:40] whatever parallel you come it doesn't
[1:30:43] matter where you are the
[1:30:45] promise is what we rest in because the
[1:30:49] promise is what changes
[1:30:55] without a
[1:30:57] promise you're on your own faith but
[1:31:01] with a promise you know it's God is
[1:31:05] going to do it and I I just hope that
[1:31:07] encourages you because I when I read
[1:31:10] that I just I I just thought my
[1:31:14] my not one of the that prayer is going
[1:31:18] to go
[1:31:21] unanswered CU he said ask anything in my
[1:31:25] father's name and he will grant
[1:31:29] it he said if
[1:31:32] you're if you're offended 70 time 70 in

[1:32:57] welcome to to come to that and and you
[1:33:01] say well and I know that it was easy for
[1:33:05] the 40 and over group because we didn't
[1:33:08] have too many
[1:33:10] children and I know a lot of the younger
[1:33:12] ones have children but we had over 30
[1:33:16] couples that were over 40 so you might
[1:33:19] talk to some of them about
[1:33:21] babysitting so uh maybe you can get a
[1:33:24] few babysitters together and be able to
[1:33:27] come out to that so uh we'll we'll have
[1:33:30] all the plans at what we're going to do
[1:33:33] and uh either we'll cater it or or maybe
[1:33:37] do a potluck but we don't want you to
[1:33:39] have to be doing all your family and and
[1:33:42] then cooking too so we'll have something
[1:33:44] nice so that's coming up and then the
[1:33:48] Sunday April 13th it'll be our oneyear
[1:33:52] anniversary from being in the building
[1:33:56] so it's going to be our first year
[1:33:59] anniversary and it's going to be the
[1:34:02] dedication of the Pavilion so when we
[1:34:05] dedicated the church we preached right
[1:34:09] we're going to dedicate the Pavilion
[1:34:11] we're going to
[1:34:13] cook right you need to dedicate it for
[1:34:16] what it's used for so we'll get out our
[1:34:18] big grill and we'll have hamburgers and
[1:34:20] hot dogs and and if you bring a dish uh
[1:34:24] you can put cold dishes in the
[1:34:27] refrigerator over there frozen in the
[1:34:30] freezer and and you can wrap your stuff
[1:34:33] up and put it in the kitchen then after
[1:34:35] service we'll go out and we'll have uh a
[1:34:39] nice uh lunch and cook some things and
[1:34:44] and just have a time of fellowship and
[1:34:46] then after that's over at 5:00 everybody
[1:34:50] who wants to will just come back in here
[1:34:52] and have a singing and just sing and
[1:34:55] have a time of fellowship and everything
[1:34:57] so that's our plans for the future so
[1:35:00] this coming weekend brother Bill Ivy I
[1:35:03] you'll enjoy brother Bill a
[1:35:06] longtime believer in this message and
[1:35:09] and and just uh
[1:35:12] uh just really um has been faithful and
[1:35:17] has a lovely group of people that are
[1:35:20] solid so I'm real uh happy to be able to
[1:35:24] have the opportunity now to invite uh
[1:35:27] brother Bill down to preach us so if
[1:35:31] you'll do that and then also if uh uh I
[1:35:35] I'll go up to uh the custard place up
[1:35:40] here and I'll be there and if you want
[1:35:43] to order Custer at least it's not 30
[1:35:47] degrees outside you know what I mean so
[1:35:50] and you want to come up and get an ice
[1:35:52] cream cone I notice I say ice cream
[1:35:55] cones and then people bump it up to
[1:35:57] Sundays and and what do they call that a
[1:36:00] crush or a uh what concrete see they're
[1:36:05] already wanting to order concrete so I
[1:36:08] if you want concrete get concrete I I I
[1:36:12] don't care but I I do appreciate you
[1:36:14] coming out to the house of the Lord and
[1:36:17] uh uh you know it's kind of sad though
[1:36:21] because if people came for the ice cream
[1:36:24] then there'd be too many of them to go
[1:36:27] so it's only the people that come for
[1:36:29] the word that get ice cream people that
[1:36:32] come to for the ice cream don't get
[1:36:36] anything fair that's fair we try to be
[1:36:41] fair in all things now I'm sure there's
[1:36:42] going to be someone that's going to see
[1:36:45] if there's any
[1:36:47] Scripture uh for this but alls I can say
[1:36:50] is that they found bread and fish upon
[1:36:53] the fire you know so uh uh we don't have
[1:36:58] bread and fish so we're going to have
[1:36:59] ice cream and that's about as quick as a
[1:37:03] spiritual comparison I can make right on
[1:37:06] a short notice but uh I love Fellowship
[1:37:09] don't you I love the church I love one
[1:37:12] another so Lord richly bless you let's
[1:37:15] stand together and and uh musicians will
[1:37:18] come we'll sing a song and and if you
[1:37:21] would like uh ice cream if you come up
[1:37:24] I'll I I'll take you up there and I'll
[1:37:27] I'll I'll buy you a a a
[1:37:31] custard uh and uh if you see me trying
[1:37:35] to eat custard please uh remind me that
[1:37:38] I don't eat
[1:37:39] custard okay so I'll let you eat custard
[1:37:43] but you don't let me eat custard and
[1:37:46] that'll be good so I I just think the
[1:37:48] lord loves his children so let's just
[1:37:51] pray and and and in our hearts let's
[1:37:54] just thank them Heavenly Father we love
[1:37:57] one
[1:37:58] another and you said in your word that
[1:38:02] you would rather that we love one
[1:38:04] another than even love
[1:38:08] you and father we love you because you
[1:38:12] first loved
[1:38:14] us and Lord we love the work that you
[1:38:18] do and the mercy and Grace that you shed
[1:38:23] and my brothers and sisters around me
[1:38:26] are the attributes of your grace and
[1:38:30] mercy there are men and women from all
[1:38:33] walks of
[1:38:34] life from all
[1:38:37] backgrounds from
[1:38:39] all trials and
[1:38:43] situations that you
[1:38:46] called and you said that they were
[1:38:50] yours and that they were a part of you
[1:38:52] and a part part of your
[1:38:54] word and Lord if I'm a part of you and a
[1:38:58] part of your word and they're a part of
[1:39:00] you and a part of your word then I'm a
[1:39:03] part of
[1:39:05] them and that's what Jesus prayed that
[1:39:07] we would all be
[1:39:09] one and that we would love one
[1:39:12] another and that we would be in you
[1:39:15] together father I believe with all my
[1:39:18] heart that's the path
[1:39:21] forward and father as we go through your
[1:39:24] word and we go to the storehouse and we
[1:39:28] take the tapes that you have left us and
[1:39:32] we play them and we listen to them
[1:39:36] together father may it be for that great
[1:39:39] one purpose that we become one with your
[1:39:43] word and one with you father and one
[1:39:47] with our Lord and
[1:39:50] Savior and Lord may that be our goal
[1:39:54] and if one comes into our midst and they
[1:39:57] don't know
[1:39:59] you father May the love that they feel
[1:40:03] Reach Out And Touch their
[1:40:06] heart that they'd become thirsty and
[1:40:09] inquire what is the hope that you
[1:40:12] have what is the joy that is expressed
[1:40:17] in your
[1:40:18] heart why is there a smile on your face
[1:40:24] and we can tell them because we're going
[1:40:26] to a land beyond the
[1:40:29] river we're going to where the streets
[1:40:31] are gold we're going to a mansion on the
[1:40:36] hilltop we're going to get a new body to
[1:40:40] the land where we never grow
[1:40:42] old and God have purchased that for us
[1:40:46] at
[1:40:47] Calvary that we can be free from sin
[1:40:51] free from hatred free from malice and
[1:40:54] strife and
[1:40:56] envy that we can be full of joy and
[1:40:59] peace and patience and longsuffering and
[1:41:02] godliness and goodness and faith and
[1:41:05] virtue when we can be capped off with
[1:41:08] the great
[1:41:10] Capstone father though
[1:41:15] simple yet so true and so
[1:41:20] real and father I pray that that would
[1:41:23] be ever and those that couldn't make it
[1:41:27] back to the house of the Lord father
[1:41:29] make a special way that next
[1:41:33] weekend that we'd all come out and hear
[1:41:36] your servant brother Bill and that he
[1:41:40] could enter into our fellowship with us
[1:41:42] and he could praise God With Us and he
[1:41:46] could Minister the words of life to us
[1:41:50] and re rejoice in the things that we
[1:41:53] here that we receive correction and
[1:41:57] am amation father and
[1:42:02] and we be stirred
[1:42:04] up that's it we long anoint Him Father

[1:42:10] behalf and father once again may this
[1:42:14] week coming may we find victory in our
[1:42:18] midst father may we withstand the Satan
