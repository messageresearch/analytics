Description:
November 16, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

with us tonight we pray in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight before we invite brother Jim to come I'd like you to keep us in prayer right now as you know my mother she had her 100th birthday and my sister has been living with her but as much of my family over the years uh they battle with alcoholism it's just something that runs in families and in culture and my sisters had a pretty bad relapse and and so now my mom's taking it pretty hard so Leslie's out there also at this time Leslie's sister had well they gave her about six months to live and and they felt that if she would do chemo they might stretch it to a year and of course we do everything we can to live but our real source of life is prayer amen so anyway it's a hard time for us so Leslie's out with our mom and and we're just trusting God will give us a solution of course I'd love to bring my mom home here with me but she's still pretty good shape so we just trust that the Lord will take care of it you know we just had a great Revival didn't we at great time in the Lord and I was kind of feeling uh I was kind of feeling I don't know what do you call it after you have a great meeting you just kind of feel that little lull spot afterwards you know and I thought oh man I I can't preach I just don't know what I'd say and everything and the whole God sends me an angel amen so he's going to keep the revival going and we all love brother Jim but I'd like to read this little statement it's been read in this church many a Time uh before brother Jim comes it's uh in paragraph 166 out of the superson it says brothers and sisters we are living in the days of supermarkets super jets super highways super races super everything else and there is a super sign we've had the sign of religion we've had the sign of Revival we've had the sign of getting together we've had the sign of speaking in tongues we've had the sign of Healing The Sick we've had all these signs but yet we find in the Bible that the last sign before the promised Sun arrives it was a super sign Jesus says As as it was then before the promised son arrived that super sign would come on Earth again I declare to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ it's on the earth now not only that but it's right here among us tonight the Holy Ghost God's super sign the resurrected Jesus Christ it cannot fail it's an eternal sign it can never be changed Heaven and Earth will pass away but that will never change it's an eternal Everlasting sign God manifested in human flesh God made himself known in human flesh do you believe that's true with all your heart do you believe it don't shut yourself up like a turtle in a shell if there is any turtle in you take the shell out let the Holy Spirit come in don't close yourself to some Creed or denomination but brother sister the hour has arrived I believe that God has done as much as he's going to do the next thing is action of the church or either we're going to be lost I just that strikes me and that's where my heart is Lord what would my action be what's the action of the church amen is going to return back to the Great Commission and go out and preach this gospel doing signs and wonders following the believer amen I believe there's a lot of exciting things and I think that brother Jim's here tonight that he can break just that Word of Life to encourage us to get into action amen so let's sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound as our brother comes the next thing is the action of the church that's all of you the Holy Spirit in human flesh doing the same signs and wonders amen that's a glorious Grace and hope in it let's sing as our brother comes amen Grace [Music] alive [Music] I was was lost [Music] Grace Grace [Music] [Music] hey baby [Music] [Music] shall we sing the last verse praise God praise God they start praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God shall we all together um answer by the Davis request for his family pray for the family before we go any further my mother was about 120 years old before she passed and uh [Music] I know what it is to be in that kind of condition Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you rose again from the dead and open the door for mankind to have hope we thank you Lord that you've given us hope beyond the grave we can draw from your resurrection power O Lord Jesus Christ Glee from your blessings that which you have ordained for us we bring our brother and his family before you are thrown of Grace and of Mercy Lord sometimes we lack wisdom and we don't know just what to do next but we thank you that we can count on your wisdom we can count on your Victory we can draw from calvary's blessings therefore we bring this family before you are throne of grace and mercy may you undertake for them and do the same for those who have gathered here and those who be listening to us from afaring here we commit them all to you and ourselves as well I commit myself and I commit the congregation into your hands Lord let your will be done tonight in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen the Lord bless you and thank you for praying for our brother uh we are going to take the gospel um Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ The Gospel of Matthew Brown Matthew is behind me somewhere a gospel of Matthew and chapter 13 in Matthew 13 the Lord Jesus Christ gave seven Parables that we're taking the very first one and I came over again because a young lady Susie my daughter's friend was 34 years and she had had four cesarean sections and the last one after the delivery of the baby um she had she had a situation where she had to be on life support for 21 days and unfortunately she passed and she had been with us lived with us for most of it life and so I had to come back to Virginia for a funeral so sad she left for little kids the last one is just three months old so remember um Solace family parents are really really devastated and the husband as well if in this world only we had hope in Christ indeed we have all men most miserable but we thank God that we have hope because Christ rose from the dead amen so keep praying for that family and I often remember widows and widowers and these days a lot of God's servants have lost their Partners it's so strange you know so many people in my countries about I can count on about seven ministers that have lost their wives I don't know why this is going on but God has I don't know but why tonight I want to be sharing with you a thought that struck me I've been wondering why will people come so far and leave the message and turn around and be fighting it why would they do that and as I meditated on that this scripture that we're going to be sharing tonight this series of scriptures brought my mind to what the cause could be so Matthew 13 I read from verse 1. the same day when Jesus out of the house and sat by the seaside a reading from verse 1. and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a shape and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he spoke many things unto them in Parable saying behold the sower went forth to sow and when he saw some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up files came and devoured them up some fell upon Stony places where they had not much much Earth and forthwith they sprang up because they had no deepness of Earth when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no roots they withered away no root they waited away and some fail among thongs and the Thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some 100 full some 64 Psalm 34. if you read the gospel of Mark the power out scriptures to what we are reading you found that where Matthew started with the highest the lowest Mark starts with the lowest to the highest is the same thing it's no contradiction amen but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit Psalm 100 4 Psalm 64 psalm 34. but who have ears here let him hear and the disciples came and said unto him white speakers thou unto them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but to them it's not given Amen to some is giving to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to Psalm is not given Hallelujah does that save the Lord the word of God is thou saved the Lord there's no way they can catch the mysteries of the Kingdom if it is not given to them that's where God's love is he tells you because he loved you whosoever have to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever have not from him shall be taken away even that he have and that's going on therefore speak out to them in Parables because they see see not herein they hear not neither do they understand now underline the word understand I'm going to be exhorting on the spirit of understanding so underline the word understand because they see in sinat and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiahs which Saved By Hearing Isha here and shall not understand second time and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax grows their ears are dull of hearing their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and here with their ears and shoot again understand third time with their heart and should be converted and I shall heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for the year for very I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which year and have not had them here he therefore the parable of the sower when anyone Hearth the word of the Kingdom and shall we all read the rest so if anybody here at the message of the Kingdom and that's not what understand then cometh the wicked one and catches a way that which was sown in his heart this is he which receives seed by the wayside they do not understand Spirit that's why the prophet of God preached God being misunderstood yet verse 20 but he that received the seed into Stony places the same you see that here are the word and anong with joy receiveth it yet have he not rooting himself but endurance for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by his offended he also that receives seed among the Thorns you see the hearer of the word the message of our day and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becameth I'm fruitful but he that receiveth seed into the good ground you see the hear of the word and what I understand that thing which also better fruit and bringeth forth some and hundredfolds some 60s some 30. the Lord bless his word as you take your seat amen so one of the biggest problems we are finding in the end time message and the reason why people will come so far and fall off according to our savior is because of the lack of understanding lack of Revelation amen so we can go back to the Old Testament and look at so many scriptures but because of time we might not be able to go through it all but I'll give you those scriptures if I know we have had enough and then you can go home and continue to study the subject Spirit of understanding in first case back into the Old Testament first case chapter 3 is a very familiar scripture which we know how many enjoy reading the Bible the reason I know William Branham is God's true Prophet is because he was the most scriptural person that I ever had amen every word of God mattered to the prophet some people will pick and choose what they want but the prophet of God stayed with every word Hallelujah so in First Kings chapter 3 we find a story of King Solomon he had built a tabernacle or a temple for Jehovah God and this is how First Kings chapter 3 begins and Solomon made Affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt and two Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the Lord and the war of Jerusalem and uh on the wall of Jerusalem roundabout and only Solomon only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no house built onto the name of the Lord until those days God's house is in construction and David has made the materials ready and Solomon loved the Lord amen hallelujah walking in the statues of David his father only he sacrificed and burned incense in high places and the King went to gibien to sacrifice there for that was the gray eye place a thousand burnt offerings the Solomon offer upon that altar in gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night and God said ask what I shall give thee my what a privilege Jehovah asking you what will you that I gave you you remember brother Mark's sister hit you right what do you ask whatever you want and the Lord shall give it to you Solomon said thou has showed unto thy servant David my father great Mercy according as he walked before the in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee that was kept for him this great kindness that has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day think of the mercy of God Solomon was the son of Bathsheba the son of an adulterous relationship Solomon had a David had wives that were not in that kind of category but why would Jehovah bypass them and choose the son of an adulterous relationship to build a temple for him talk about God reaching Mercy he has so forgiving David so his Mercy extended to Solomon and now oh Lord my God that's made that servant King instead of David my father and now I'm about a little child I know not how to go out or coming and that servant is in the midst of that people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant what and understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to Jack these are so greater people give me an understanding of and they speak please the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing God said unto him because that has asked this thing and has not asked for thyself long life neither as us riches for thyself nor has asked the life of thy enemies Beth has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold I have done according to thy words Lord I have given thee a wise arm and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee amen and I've also given thee that which thou has not asked both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the Kings like unto thee all thy days if thou walk in my ways to keep my statues and my Commandments as thy father David did work then I will lengthen thy days and Solomon awoke and behold it was a dream he came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and no federal bent our friends and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servants Solomon had asked for an understanding heart now let's turn to Proverbs chapter 2. and see how he valued this Spirit of understanding Proverbs go back in your Bible Proverbs chapter 2. my son if thou will receive my words and hide my Commandments with thee so that thou incline thy ear unto wisdom and apply thy heart to understanding yeah if thou Christ after knowledge and lifted up thy voice for understanding if that's sick of her are silver and searches for her as for Hidden Treasures they shall not understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he left up some wisdom for the righteous the Lord he is a bachelor to them that walk uprightly he keepeth the powers of of judgment and preserve the way of his sins then Shada understand righteousness and judgment and Equity yay every good path when wisdom entireth into thy heart and knowledge is person unto thy Soul this crashing shall preserve Thee the understanding shall keep thee to deliver thee from the way of the evil man from the man that speaker forward things and I looked at the word forward and it says person that is uncontrollable person that is uncontrollable who leave the house of uprightness to walk in the ways of Darkness if you leave light you have no alternative but walk in darkness people are living evening lights they're walking in darkness who Rejoice to do evil and Delight in the forwardness of the wicked whose ways are crooked and if and they forward in their paths to lead to deliver them from the strange woman even from the stranger which flattereth with their words which forsake of the guide of a youth and forget the Covenant of a God for a house in cleneth unto death and they pass unto the Dead none that go unto her return again neither take the hold of the powers of life the thou mayest walk in the way of good men and keep the powers of righteous for the upright shall dwell in the land and the prophet shall remain in it but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it amen Solomon giving great wisdom underlined the importance of the spirit of understanding that's why in Jeremiah 3 and verse 15 we find Jehovah God knowing the needs of his children has said this Jeremiah 3 and verse 15 save the Lord listen closely I will give you pastors according to my heart we shall feed you with knowledge and understanding I Jehovah God will give you pastors according to my heart we shall feed you with knowledge and understanding you find a five-fold Ministry working together the strong arm of the Lord submit yourselves unto the hand of the Lord and he shall live there so Jehovah gave in his children pastors according to my heart they will feed you with knowledge and understanding praise the Lord all right so that's the promise of Jehovah to give unto his children pastors that will feed them with knowledge and understanding blessed be the name of the Lord I will find Jehovah doing this in efficiency for of course verses 11 all the way Apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists five-fold Ministry that will bring the Church of the Living God they will feed on the message of their day and these people are ordained by Jehovah God to simplify the message of the hour break it down in a way that the children of God will get understanding and knowledge a typical casing is in Nehemiah chapter eight let's go back again to the Old Testament and the book of Nehemiah chapter 8 are we going to see an example of how fivefold Ministry o priests to help God's children this was during the Reconstruction of the Broken Walls of Jerusalem nehema Ezra and many others were engaged in that business and all the people guided themselves together as one man into the street that was before the Watergate they spoke unto Ezra The Scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded to Israel and Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men are women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month he read them he and he read the ring before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all the people attentive unto the book of the law and Ezra described stood upon the pulpit of wood which they had made for their purpose and beside him stood on his right hand and on his left hand pediah and Marshall and milk ya and his home and hash badana Zechariah ameshulam Sam all right some on the left and Ezra opened the book in the side of all the people when brother pranam says when we read in the Bible to stand up people think that it's unscriptural now let's look at it right here Ezra opened a book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people like I'm above you all and when he opened it all the people stood up Hallelujah so you see that our Prophet was scripture brother Branham to me was a very scriptural Prophet let the world say what they want and Ezra blessed the Lord the great God and all the people and said how did they answer they were not sitting down quietly they were responding to the word that was coming to them and the people said and that's right so that's why you should be doing so they were saying amen and amen with what lifting up their hands hallelujah amen and they bought their hairs and Worship the Lord with their faces to the ground that's why they're Muslims they say see the Old Testament Believers were Muslims look at them also Joshua Ben and I and shared by a German [Music] deliveries listen here deliveries cause the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place so you see the duty of the ministry past us after my own heart who feed you with what knowledge and understanding amen so they'll cause them to understand the reading God has sent a message such a precious message but the problem is people do not understand we can press play all we want to and we should but that doesn't necessarily guarantee that people are going to understand that's where the faithful Ministry comes in they catch the thoughts that God is presenting through his prophet and they present it to God's children the freedom with what knowledge and understanding otherwise watch the use of having ministers Eva there's a balance we Press Play I press play all my life I've been pressing play but you know what if I press play my church 99 of the people who sleep you know why they can't understand one word in in the in English very few so you see there must be a balance everybody is not an American and Ezra the priest the Scribe and the Levites that taught the people said unto all the people this is the holy this day is Holy unto the Lord your God more not nor weep for all the people wept when they had the words of the Lord then he said unto them go your way eat the fat drink the sweet send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy unto the Lord neither be you sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength so the lever is still all the people say hold your peace for the days holy neither be ye grieved and all the people went their way to eat drink and to drink and to some push and to make great meth because they had what understood the West that were declared unto them and on the second day they gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people the priests that Levites unto the unto Israel they prescribed even to understand the words of the law and they found written in the law which the law had commanded by Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in Bulls in the Feast of the seventh month of the sermon they should publish and Proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem saying go forth unto the man fetch only branches Pine branches metal branches palm branches and branches of fig trees to Maples as is written the people are to understand before they acted the court was saying the church is now to act but we've got to act with understanding how do you go into action if you did not understand the command or I'm going to give you a command sorry Dylan sorry he didn't understand so how would he go into action see how valuable it is that by God's grace we should have an understanding and revelation of the word that we are hearing do you understand Jesus will turn around I remember that Billy Paul was giving a testimony Ibraham at pre-future home and said Billy did you understand he looked at he said yes Dad he said did you understand then he shook his hands and no no without Revelation you cannot go into action you see the Lord Jesus after the resurrection in in Luke Chapter 24. let's turn to it in the New Testament and watch this very interesting thing he had spoken to cleopas me that's why I got my middle name from cleopas means the full Glory I want a serving course meal I don't want any part parts I want the full course meal yes sir so in Luke chapter 24 this is talking about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and he has spent the whole day preaching the gospel to these guys they were so confused about the message they were confused by the death of the Lord Jesus they never thought you could die they were so confused they were not even listening to why he had been telling them about him going to die and so on and so they got up there and they they walking in the street going back to where they used to be going back to their old jobs one Jesus the the let me read it over here I'm trying to jump quickly but let me slow down a little bit so two of them verse 14 they talk together of all these things which had happened and he came to pass that while they commune together a reason Jesus himself Drew now and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him he said unto them what man of communications are this that you have one to another as you walk and I said one of them whose name was cleopas and she said on team are the only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which have come to pass there in these days he said unto them what is they served him concerning Jesus they were talking to the man and they didn't even know who he was their eyes were holding their eyes of understanding were closed the God of this evil age can close the eyes of people till they come and see truth their eyes of understanding must get open or you talk all day all night and throughout your life and you'll be wasting your breath he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet they were preaching back to Jesus you know which was a prophet Mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and he said oh that's how they saw me and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him we trusted that it had been he we should have redeemed Israel and beside all these two days the third day since these things were done yeah and certainly women also of our company made us astonished which were earlier the Sepulcher when they found out his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive certain of them which were with us went to the circle can find it even so as the women have said by him they saw not then he said unto them oh fools fools who is a fool Wahoo doesn't understand things it's a fool you fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken people today are slow of heart to understand Bible prophecies ought not Christ who has suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses that's Genesis the Torah five books of the Bible and all the prophets the image Jesus is taking them through the Bible to identify himself by the scriptures all the way from Genesis to Malachi beginning of Moses and all the prophets he expanded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself but did they catch the revelation they drew now onto the village without they went and he made us though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us he's toward the evening the day is fast pain he went into tarry with them he came to pass as he sat at meet with them he took bread blessed it broke it gave it to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their side and they said one to another they know that happened within us why he thought with us by the way and why open to us the scriptures they rose up the same hour returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and have appeared to Simon they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in Breaking of bread and as they expect this Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified they're frightened and suppose that they have seen a spirit he said unto them why are you trouble and why do thoughts arise in your house behold my hands and my feet it is I myself handle me see for a spirit of no Flesh and Bones as you see me have when he had outspoken he showed them his hands and his feet and while they were here believe not for joy what they yet believe not for joy and one day he said unto them have he here and you meet any food they gave him a piece of broiled fish how many enjoy broiled fish and of her honeycomb they say you shouldn't eaten if you have diabetes the Bible says eat honey so I think I will I obey the Bible but he says eat it moderately so he took it and he did it before the man he said unto them these are the words which I speak unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law Moses in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me so the whole Bible was concerning him then look at this then oh Behavior understanding that they might understand the scriptures unto Jesus does the same operation on you you can hear the prophet all the days of your life if he does not open your eyes and of understanding you you will not be able to go into action so open day then open heal their understanding that they might understand their scriptures and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem ye are witnesses of these things and behold I send a promise of my father upon you carrying the city of Jerusalem montevian to repower from on high he read about as far as to Bethany I lifted up his hands bless them and he came to pass while he blessed them he was spotted from them carried up into heaven they worshiped him and return to Jerusalem with great joy and where continually in the temple praising and blessing God but he he opened their eyes of understanding you will now see why Paul when he wrote to the Ephesian believers turn with me to Ephesians chapter 1. Paul had said so many things about how God has blessed her with all the spiritual blessings in Heavenly places read adoption and blah blah I'm gives a list of the blessings that God has spought upon his bride blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according us he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in their beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abandoned towards her I said no wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of Israel God's will for your life is a mystery and you must seek his ways for the unfolding of that will seek his face excuse me you we must seek his face for him to unfold the mystery of his will concerning our lives for he says the mystery of his will his will about you for you is a mystery and seek his face for the unfolding of that mystery to you personally okay then jump over to verse 15 because of time wherefore I also that's Paul after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you make a mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him I cease not to pray unto God to give unto you the spirit of wisdom what is wisdom wisdom is knowing how to apply knowledge amen you might be giving knowledge but if you do not know the right way to apply it to a fool it takes Divine wisdom to take the revealed word apply it the right way to know how to apply the work to meet your need amen that's wisdom so he Paul is praying for them that the Lord might give them the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your word understanding being enlightened amen that you may know one what is the hope of his calling what is the hope of his calling what is God's hope of calling you to be his son or daughter that you must share the divine nature and have a body change and be raptured to be with him in glory that's why he said before us the promise of this change this church the promise of the end time bride is to share his throne is the rapture is a body change that so he says that I cease not to pray for you that your eyes of understanding will be enlightened so that you will know the hope of his calling if you miss the hope of his calling you are serving God in there you are just following daddy you are following mommy you are following a friend you are following somebody but you have no personal revelation of what you are following if you have a personal revelation of this message you will not toy with it you will not allow somebody to talk you out of it amen you have a real revelation of what this message means to you you don't you're not traded for nothing amen the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling one what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the sins God's children are rich in faith amen and and and then what is the exceeding greatness of his power to as what we believe he's prayed for them that their eyes of understanding will be opened one that they might know the hope of their calling and two that they might know the the riches of the glory of his inheritance among these things God has got spiritual riches for his sins but until our eyes of understanding are open to know them we will be walking uh like the Indian the brother brothers are like the the the old lady that brother Brown and speaks of whose son had gone to be in India and she was sending her checks upon checks every month with a big elephant on their checks so my son has been sending me these pictures from India and she hid them in her Bible a whole bunch of them I was living in poverty with so much stored up in a Bible but she did not know what they were till something happened I said did you say you have a son overseas a doctor I said yes I have a son hasn't he been sending you any help he said no always he's been sending me at this elephant pictures I packed them in my Bible the guy looked at them and there were Church there are millions of dollars but she had no understanding of what they were so is it that God's Bible is full of riches for his children Hallelujah but until your eyes have understanding are they are revealed to you by the Holy Ghost minister to your heart you remain in spiritual poverty sitting on Plenty like this woman amen so he prayed for them that their eyes of understanding will be opened that they will know the hope of his calling how many know the hope of his calling yes sir and that they will know the exceeding greatness of his riches in their sins and thirdly that they might also know the exceeding great power that Jehovah displayed when he raised Christ from the dead that the same power that raised the Lord Jesus from the dead dead and set him on this heavily Throne is the power that is working for the Saints oh Hallelujah the power that is working that is behind you the power of his resurrection that's why Paul said you know in Philippians chapter 3 he said I count all what I knew has done for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ he says and I have a forgetting what lays behind I press towards the price of the mark of the High Calling of God that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and befriending him not having my own righteousness but the righteousness which is of Christ by faith oh Hallelujah and if Paul was not complacent at any time I was pressing for more of God how can we sit down there and allow this little decent anointing of need of nothing to come upon us there's so much more that God has stood up for his bride that we must press unto and and pray unto and reach forth until amen we should not be afraid to let go of our faith it may take a while but don't lose sight of the fact that the Lord is God and and that he does what he wants to do in his time and not in my time or your time but he is in his time he makes all things beautiful in his time amen he the power that he brought the mighty power which he wrought in Christ amen when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places far above all Hallelujah He Who Came From Above is above all above all our problems above Allah was difficult it's above all our confusion our God is a dissolver of doubts amen he raised him far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come he has put all things under his feet and give it and gave him to be the head over all things to the church head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that feeleth all in all bless that be the name of the Lord hallelujah God Opening Our Eyes of understanding then when we understand the message of our day we are not confused ways of doctrines that are blowing from east west north and south can never blow us off our feet now we established with the spirit of understanding you know one time Mary that had been betrothed to Joseph was found with a child and that was contrary to Jewish betrothal laws Jewish you can study that if you wish to Jewish be Truth House what you call engagement we're not some wishy-washy kneeling down somewhere and giving a rose flower will you marry me yes I will that was no it was a pre-arranged well-planned a rabbi was present and they are witnesses to that so to break that was the same as a divorce so Mary was found with a child and she told Joseph how it all happened said Joseph to Mary Mary you know what I've trusted you up till now you know I hate to betray you to be stoned to death you just tell me the truth and I'll be sure not to betray you Joseph what truth an angel Gabriel came to me and to me and said thou have found favor in the eyes of the Lord what other truth do you want besides this and that's all I know how could Mary what kind of how could Mary convince Joseph that she was telling the truth [Music] that's your thing why do don't talk with my life you know you are breaking my heart okay this is what I plan to do I will leave you privately I will not let you restore but you tell me the truth what's the name of the man Mary said the Holy Ghost say look Mary you can't pull the wool over my eyes have you ever heard anybody impregnated by a spirit well there was no way Mary could convince Joseph that she was telling the truth so but Joseph was very sincere he went before the Lord said Lord I'm confused I don't know what to do my my beloved fiancee has betrayed me made mockery of me and people be laughing at me Lord please won't you do something to help me give you an understanding of the situation she prayed and what did Jehovah do the Lord sent an angel to Joseph and in the night take unto thee marry their wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and if you want to know 10 to Isaiah 7 and verse 14 haven't I said in my word a virgin shall conceive and give birth to a son and thou shall call his name Emmanuel didn't Moses say that the seed of the woman who breathes the head of the serpent has a woman got a seed this is the super seed Hallelujah is talking about the Virgin conception maybe maybe Isaiah was plagiarizing Isaiah said a virgin will concede and it was based on Genesis 3 15. so Isaiah was plagiarized nobody has Monopoly on the Holy Ghost right brother Branham said God sent him to tighten up the Loose Ends so he's admitting that there have been Revelations down the road but they've got loose eyes so he brings them together and tightens them up by the word of God and presents it to the blood of Jesus Christ oh that's no plagiarizing that Moses was everybody was plagiarizing when they started quoting Old Testament amen Jesus in Matthew 4 4 he quoted Deuteronomy 8 3 he was plagiarizing men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God he said is it not written in the it is written in the word he did not even mention Moses's name plagiarism is when you use somebody's material without reference to the person Jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone he did not say Moses said it so he did not make reference to the original author of that word through whom the Lord first said it amen so here we have come preference there are many things in this world by the way do you realize that brother pronounce Ministry was he says I preach what Paul preached and you know what Peter said about what Paul priest turned to second period chapter 3 how many like reading the Bible listen everything this Prophet brought was here here we should begin to say the word of God says confirmed by God's Prophet this is the your soup this is the authority and the prophet of God through the light on the written word of the Living God revealing the Hidden Mysteries here to make this book live so that we the bride can act on it without fear right now we should not fear to apply the word why it's been proven proving his word it's been proven from Genesis to revelation we don't need to prove it again it's already been proven to be true and efficacious is powerful it will not fail so we should hold on to it dearly and stand by the authority of the word of the Living God and move on jealously you know why sometimes we are not able to exercise faith is pride what if I pray and it doesn't work then I will be put to shame so he said ego Factor brother Abraham said if I pray for 500 and they all die I'll be praying for the next 500. he is not a Healer he is called to pray he's not a savior he's going to preach salvation but we have once healer and we have one savior who never fails amen praise be to God Hallelujah so in conclusion I see the reason why people are leaving this message when they don't even have a better substitute and they can have a better substitute they lack Revelation they lack understanding of what God has given to us and if you are in the same category you'll get to a point you throw it away so pray for revelation pray to understand God's purpose for sending us a prophet pray that Lord let me understand give me a personal conviction and revelation of this word of Truth and establish me in the present truth so that the ways of Doctrine blowing left right up and down will still be standing solid and fair that's why Jesus said in Luke chapter 6 46-49 a wise man who builds his house upon the rock the flowers will come turbulence will come tsunamis who come earthquakes who come but because it's founded on the rock rock of Revelation personal revelation of the word to your heart you still stand Fame blessed be the name of the Lord I would say God's Not Dead he's alive my God's Not Dead he is alive God's Not Dead it's alive feeling in my heart feeling in my feet feeling over me one more time God's not dead yes [Music] alive I feel him in my head I'm feeling in my feet I feel him in my heart I feel it all over me is that right with you tonight oh God his eyes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] if God answered Solomon's Prayer to be endued with a spirit of understanding and the Lord not only answered that prayer I hear that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think if he went beyond his request and even added more that he God knew he needed can't we also come before the unchanging God where you are stuck up and you have doubts and confusion in your mind concerning something the prophet said don't don't fight it bring it before the Lord said Lord please help my understanding that I might be able to take the right action that's what we ought to be doing don't fight it brother brother must not one given to Showmanship and vain Glory seeking no he said only what God ordained him to say Amen amen sometimes he may not even understand what he said by being a prophet he had to say it because he was cause mouthpiece now believing that the holy spirit will give to God's children Spirit of understanding then we go into action for the kingdom of God sorry about our heads open down my eyes oh Lord that I may behold one draws things out of thy law that's what David prayed won't you ask the lord lord Jesus may you anoint my eyes of understanding that I might understand the word that you have spoken to me in these last days Lord that I might not fight the Holy Ghost without my jewels to you that you might give me understanding Joseph prayed and you gave him understanding of the situation he took unto him Mary his wife I was willing to Bear reproach on account of your way because he understood it Lord I pray for your children those here and those who will be hearing this message anyway I pray that when they take these messages or they listen to the voice of God in these last days that you grant unto them Grace to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of God for you have said in your word that unto you it is given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of God so may we stand on the authority of your word and claim the understanding then we can go into action believing that the Lord has given us Revelation even as Daniel Prayed to understand the time that he was living in and you sent Gabriel he had been fasting and praying and seeking your face and you sent April Gabriel you sent since the day you started seeking to understand I have sent my angel to bring you understanding of the times that you are living in all it is on our knees that God Reveals His Hidden Mysteries it's on our knees that God will bring to us the spirit of understanding our eyes to be open to hear our ears to be opened to hear our eyes should be opened to see Paul said I Has Not Seen Nor Ear hurt nor the heart of man conceived what God has kept in store for us he says but his Spirit has revealed them to us in these last days we are very grateful we are thankful to the Living God who has come to our age and in these days of spiritual blindness [Music] spiritual blindness has hit the people they are naked and wretched and blind and don't even know it they are spiritual Amnesia but God has anointed our eyes if I serve that we may see and behold wondrous things out of the message of our day oh Lord we thank you Lord we bless you Lord we adore you strengthen us to stay pure and clean and hold faithful unto the end regardless of what we face we know that we shall not be disappointed your promises are here and amen in Christ Jesus I pray Heavenly Father you are the dissolver of doubts if there be any doubt any question marks in anybody's heart I pray tonight that in the name of Jesus Christ the same Angel of the Lord that helped Joseph out of his confusion Lord May the same Angel be visit your people and give us understanding Lord Jesus of the things that you have made known unto us then we can go into our shape with our two ways we can go into our sin we thank you Father we bless you continue to bless your people everywhere as many as are determined to stay true to this word give them Grace and courage and Revelation upon revelation we thank you Father in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord amen and the church said amen amen God bless you [Applause] [Music] God bless hey [Music] amen amen is there words to that amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know what amen means don't you means [Music] I don't think we ought to go there you know I I enjoyed that tonight didn't you I enjoyed the word just coming out in season and in place you know that's a difference between a revelated Spirit-filled believer he don't he don't look back studying the word backwards you know what I mean he looks this way letting the word lead him he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I'll come again I'll be with you even in you I'll lead you and guide you in all spiritual knowledge and all truth amen and that's that's what a Believer is how many believe that God's got more for you just so much more to show you so much more to open your eyes to I believe he's got more power for you amen just to think that you can be due with power power to overcome power to help other people to overcome the church has been given power to bind Satan yes sir Amen to forgive sins and to lose so there's there's so much more that he has he has for us if a man has come up with all kinds of counterfeits all kinds of bogus dollar bills all kinds of programs all kinds of measuring of this and evidences and everything but we've got a pure word of God that's here to give us pure leadership into the things that God has for us hey man it's just when we all get hungry and say Lord I know there's more for me yes I know there's more for me you know our sister that got baptized during the meetings uh you know I I to me it was one of the greatest lines in the whole meeting she said I never believed it could feel as beautiful as this I never could imagine that it was this warm and this good yes all right you know if and you know we kind of lose that sometimes we got to go on Old experiences and and old knowledge and we just have our old knowledge kind of let let what we already know you know just go on it's like an old guy like me I I I technology you know what I mean I I come across a tool the other day at the store and and I was over there looking at this little little piece of wood that's got a little hook on it and you put the wire under the steel and then you put the hook in this and the hook in this and you twist it around and the guy come over here and he says let me show you this he says take this they just he said just press it on the steel and I pressed it on this deal and automatically wrapped it up wow I thought wow I didn't even know there was something [Music] like this you could do 10 times the work I thought I was just gonna buy me one and just go out there and put all the other guys down well that's what it is what happened something came along right if you want to say we call it what technology or advancement well what do we call it we call it Enlightenment and understanding and Revelation something that God can show you and give you to make your life more victorious in him so God I believe God's got a lot of spiritual technology don't you don't you believe he's got a lot of hidden manna that in the framework of God's word that he he just wants to feed us even the scripture Paul writing I believe it was to Timothy says study to show yourself for proof that you might have an answer for all men amen amen I I dislike when our brother brought especially after our meetings I think it has really in season he's telling his his sheep come come unto me all ye that are heavy laden I'll give you rest come in I'll feed you I'll give you what you have need of I got a whole Storehouse here amen but you gotta come brother Rand preached a message called thirst he said if you don't thirst for it if you don't hunger for it if you don't call out for why we just get to the place we think we know the message I don't think I know the message I don't think I've even scratched the surface of it oh I wanted to open up to me don't you want it to open up to you you want more of it to open up how do you how does it come Faith cometh by what hear it and hearing by the word of God so bless the but Faith cometh by blessed is he that heareth

anyway don't you love them amen I think if each of us individually would go in and get fortified then we'd fortify one another and every member would would grow and be fitted and join together and then we would really become what we want to become caring loving and Invincible Army ministering to one another and ministering to those that don't have the Lord Jesus amen Lord richly bless you I'm
