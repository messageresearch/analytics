discouraged there's no need to talk defeat god will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will [Music] for the past three months i was having lower abdominal pain and i was just praying hoping that i would just pray it away and then my daughter finally said mom you need to go to the doctor so i went to the doctor and the doctor said we need to do blood work first so the blood we came the the results and he said that the blood count is good and my metabolism also he said it was good so for like three four days i was feeling good i didn't have abnormal pain and i was so happy that it has gone away and then on a saturday early morning i started feeling the pain again so the pain wasn't gone so i went back to the doctor and then the doctor said we need to do further tests now so he said i must go for a ct scan and a call on a screening colonoscopy so i was drop so i went to google i dropped my symptoms and i began to feel so nervous i got so confused and and also i was wondering why i'm going for colon screening so now um i went for a ct scan and then a few days later i started preparing for the colonoscopy that was on wednesday and then thursday to take time off so that i could go for the screening so [Music] i went in there and they prepped me and the nurse was asking me she was so nice and she was asking me if there's anything i need i said they need prayer just pray for me that's all i need right now so when i went into the theater okay when i came back they called me to a private room and i was so nervous about it because i didn't know what to expect so the doctor said he found a polyp in my colon two millimeters and then he said but he didn't find any cancer so i'm so thankful about that i want to sing this song when i look back on history see the mighty god unveiled proving over and over that is what can never fail but i can't keep on dwelling on some past memory he's the same god who's living in me [Music] the same god who spoke to the woman the same god does wonders too many to tell the same god who parted the raging red sea [Music] he's the same god who's living in me the same god who created all the heavens and all thy earth who came back living in jesus there was power in his word but now in this last days i'm beginning to see he's the same god who's living in me the same god we spoke to [Music] too many to tell the same god who parted the raging red sea [Music] he's the same god who's living in me amen why don't we just sing that cross the same god [Music] is [Music] the woman and [Music] god [Music] who's leaving in me hallelujah [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] man [Music] is [Music] hallelujah [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] let's approach him this morning like he does reign our heavenly father your king of kings your lord of lords your your all that we have need of your the reason that we live this morning we ask that you would draw closer to us that you would help us in our journey along life's way that we could be fruitful that we wouldn't be barren but that we would be able to produce much fruit for the glory and the kingdom of god we ask you to touch each heart this morning showing mercy and kindness instruction father we just believe and trust that you can do all these things on our behalf because we ask it in your name in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen and god bless you this morning if you have your bibles let's turn over to the book of ephesians and read in the first chapter of the book of ephesians mike can i can i get a little more monitor here for me this morning thank you so let's read here in ephesians and we just want to have a little uh sunday school lesson this morning and everything this morning amen we got up close this morning huh you gotta that's what i call a firsthand seat right there right that's that's what you call get in the front row amen let's read together do you love the lord i thought this morning as we came i i thought of that song they come from the east and west you know and kind of we come from the east and west we come from the streets and parking lots so far amen making our way to the house of the lord it'll get better soon paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated i have a little something on my heart this morning and i'm going to maybe kind of take up a long way around to get there but the purpose of it is that to to make us a aware of something and and the great things that uh god has for us and i kind of like to talk a little bit this morning if i could about our our position in christ now we we kind of think of that word position a lot of times like a job you know what's our our job or or what's our ranking but i want to take it more from this aspect if i could is where that he has placed us in himself and and how he did it and why he did it and and so by taking that pathway to get to what it is that we want to say to uh stir us up this morning if if we could uh we could do it that way and so as as uh christians the first thing we realize is that uh god has great and marvelous promises do you understand that so he's given us great and precious promises so so we talk about where he positioned us he positioned us to be recipients of his promises his great and exceedingly great and precious promises that by these promises that we could become partakers of divine nature so if i promise you something and and you believe that promise and you call upon that promise and that promise comes to pass in in your life and you now realize that god is a god that keeps his word then you are our partaker of that promise uh as i think as dylan sitting here when he became very very sick none of us really could understand how sick that he was we knew that he was in the hospitals but when he came to the doors of death it you remember his testimony how that he called out upon the lord and the lord heard his cry and and then when when the lord came down and touched him and healed him and delivered him and restored him back he now uh stood up and he testified how that he partook of that that the greatness of god's healing that he had a a drink from that fountain and so god's given us many great and marvelous promises and so they're just unfailing promises there are even there are even more unfailings than heavens and earth because the scripture says heavens and earth will pass away but god's word will never pass away so he's given us something that's so solid and so strong and so precious to lay a hold of his word do you know that we could live by the word of god alone amen that's right everything that we have need of is in the word of god the word of god said that a righteous person wouldn't beg bread you could live by that promise that he said that he'd supply your every need i i i don't know why that we're so easily shaken to fear when of all people we've to be the least fearful because the word of god tells us if god before us who could be against us maybe the only question would rise in our heart is whether that god was for us or not but if we could understand what he done for us and where he placed us and how he positioned us and all that he's done for us and all that he has for him this morning if you're lacking in any form we are definitely not here to condemn you for the condition that we're in you're in but we're here to give you the good news that he is here more and abundantly able to do that above which you can even ask her thing no matter how dark the clouds have rolled in or how difficult he makes it or or the amount of failures that you have piled up against yourself he's greater than the record that the enemy has against you so we can rest on those uh promises this morning that he will do what he said he would do you got to realize that he'll always do what he said he's do now you might miss it and you might walk away from it or you might not look for it but he's there he's always on time he's always where he said he would be he has never failed amen amen i know he's never failed me i wish i could say it the same but he's a good god and um and so and so he said that so we know that these unfailing things so we have an unfailing word you understand that we have unfailing promises and and this little sermon came on my heart it's it was preached in 1955 it's called the believer's position in christ and there's some things in here that i thought were very good that would be very needful for myself and and then i would like to share them with you but so we have these great these all this word of god if i could say that i can i i it it's it's so marvelous and it's so far-reaching and there's no place in our life that it won't reach there's there's no situation that it doesn't have the answer to there's no family problem no a relationship problem no financial problem no health problem or everything that means this word searches all in all and so we can surely find that but so when you look at all this word that we have and we have volumes of it in our age revealed to us that we are in a blessed age in a blessed people because god has placed us in the time of the revealing of his word the things that were hid the the pieces of the puzzle that couldn't fit together how people couldn't understand what the evidence of the spirit of the indwelling spirit was what the power of forgiveness of sins was what grace was what the evidence of the spirit was how all the great things of the book of life and of predestination all these things that that man had been groping at and been trying to place together and fit within their heart god in this last day by his infinite wisdom spoke in the scriptures that he would send forth a prophet to the gentile age and he would be in the same spirit of the spirit of elijah that came in times before and that he would come to the gentiles and once again before the gentile church if i could use the word impersonate or or bring to the gentile church the same ministry of the son of man in the same manner in the same works in the same signs and wonders so the gentile church wouldn't be without witness so just as jesus stood in his day as a man when you looked at jesus you saw a man there was no beauty in him to be desired there was nothing about him that set him apart from anybody else until he spoke and then when he spoke they said no man speaketh like this man no in fact they marveled the scripture says that they came to him and they said how how does this man know no letters being unlearned well how why do you think he knew those letters he's the author hey amen and so he stood on this earth and he did the signs he did the works he discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart he meant the woman at the well he raised it all those signs and wonders that were done in the form of flesh in the form of a prophet so when you looked at jesus you saw a prophet without divine revelation you wouldn't have known that he was the son of god that was what god was going to reveal and build his church on but when they looked at him they saw a man and so in seeing this man they they they knew that god was with them rabbi no man could do these works lest god be with them okay and so that was his ministry well the gentile church was without that ministry a witness of that ministry so in the last days the lord jesus christ raised up a prophet he was born a prophet he was gifted a prophet he had his consciences so close together he could step in those realms god could speak to him lift the ear he was a man but yet god veiled himself in that man and did the same works amongst us that the lord jesus christ did so that we could know and understand and that he could break to us truths and revelations that was hid that's the privileged people that you are so that's where he has placed you in him amen in time he chose you to place you to be here to hear this word this message that he could share with you truths and revelations and and things that were hid from people of all other ages marvelous it's called the election amen as if we would read the next verse in script in ephesians it says according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundations of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love chosen what a beautiful place so in looking at this word of god we'd like to say this this morning excuse me my i get to thinking about election and it causes me to tear up a little bit because i can't believe he picked me there's so many reasons he he shouldn't have you know what i mean and and and and the number of times that i've turned my back on him and walked away is innumerable but yet he never let me go amen he kept reaching his arm out kept reaching his arm out kept reaching his arm out and he said he says i'll not leave you i'll not forsake you i'll be with you even in you till the end nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand if i've started a work in you i'll finish it till the end amen that's where he placed us in him he said but the main thing is if we can find where god's word belongs in our life now the responsibility is beginning to shift to us because he wants fellowship with us he just didn't lay something out there to believe like a catechism or or doctrines or or a history book he's always wanted to be personal he always wanted to be a relationship he he didn't want just a church of people that all believe the same we're not here believing all the same our revelations differ our understandings of god's differ our experience differ that's not what he was looking for he was looking for us each to take on the mind of him that the love of god would be shed abroad in our heart by his spirit and so we find out that we want to we want to find out where the word of god belongs in our life that's personal it's there it's on books it's on tapes it's in the scriptures it's recorded it's everywhere but now you've got to ask the question where does this belong in my life because there's there's there's there's things that are yours and let me read on a little bit if i could if you would allow me he says god sets times and time limits and and then it works all to that time just think of that god sets times times he's going to do things time limits time that things are going to end so he he he said that god god you know it's kind of to where i'm going but uh the lack of god's not irresponsible if i could say that he practices what he preaches so he set a time for this and a time for that so he has a time he has a season he has time limits he he knew certain things were going to go for so long and and so he sets those things in and he's got a time and he says uh many of them before the coming of the lord there was many false teachings and said this is the messiah and false things taken place according to the scriptures just before the coming of the lord so there was a sense that something was fixing to happen you under understand that and and and therefore but god had a time for it he had a time limit in other words he has a time when dispensations come to an end he has the time that things end and a time that things began and so he he has a time now because let me say this he's got a time in your life also he's got a time that things are going to transpire in your life so just stay with me just a moment if if you could he says he says but and people try to do it within themselves they try to make god's word fit their program now this is a little tremendous section here but the purpose of it is is to bring us back into contact that we just can't be drifting we can't just let the days roll by and time go by and and not understand that god's program is still at work so we've got to find out where does that fit in our lives where does the word of god fit in me what is the word of god trying to transform me into he said so he says so people try to do it uh and they try to make the word of god fit into their program we're gonna go on that just for a little bit he says but that you got it vice versa you've got to fit in god's program we find that's true now we take moses as an example of god's time now moses he knew and he came to the realization that there was a calling in his life that's right he looked out there he saw the children of israel and all of a sudden something come on his heart he didn't look at him as mob daubers he looked at him as the elect of god my how would you like to change your vision hey man how about if we could just get a whole different look at what's going on around us because he didn't she just there's some trent something transpired in his heart and he said and moses when he had known that god had made a promise that he was going to deliver the children of israel why moses knew that he was called for that purpose now listen to this because this is again bringing it back to you and the responsibility that you have of coming in contact with god now when you have a call from god that doesn't altogether mean that you jump right out and you're doing the will of god you have to find the will of god and the time of god to do it you know that takes something that a lot of us and myself in particular preaching to myself this morning find it hard to do is wait on the lord now listen what he's saying moses saw he had a call he he saw it was he saw that there was the need there was the situation he had to call but it didn't mean that you just jump out and do it that you just jump in there and go about it your own way and and do it there there's there's a time element involved remember god will always equip his man to do the job he'll always do that so so you know moses what did he do he just he just he just jumped out there and he went and got a sword and he was going to do it in himself and he'd do it and it's the same thing that a a a lot of us do he he says he says he says he says that's the reason moses had forgot about freedom god's promise that he would free them but god hadn't forgot his promise moses tried in himself and failed that's what the church has done many times we've tried in ourselves to do things and when we and we fail to find god's element of time now that now that that places you in a position that you're going to have to pray about it you've got a loved one you've got something you've got something that you want you know our tendency is i'm going to make a program and i'm going to get this to work but the scripture says they that wait upon the lord that they shall renew their strength he says many times he says uh he says and that we find ourselves dude and god has a time god has times for seasons he has seasons for his word he has times the scripture here where he said and the presence of the lord was there to heal the sick that's when jesus was ministering too at the presence of the lord was there to heal the sick maybe at other times the presence of the lord wasn't there to heal the sick whoa and we find out that god works everything seasonally and now when moses when he had failed to find what was the time limit of god moses acted before the time but look there's a there's a i mean these are things that we should be able to start understanding that you know we think that there's a time that the presence of the lord comes to heal if not we we're going to try to run and try to heal this person try to heal that person to try to do this to to try to do this we're going to make it come to pass no you're not god's got a season he's got a time he had a time that it was going to rain 40 years later he had a time that aaron abraham was going to bring forth the child you know how many years later you know he's got a time he's got a season he's got a a place that's going to talk about so we're talking about our position and our place in him and and where he put us now he put us in this in in this economy of god is that correct so we know that we know that we're in his economy we know that we're a part of them and god had a time so we had a time for moses but there had to be something that transpired first and let's see how beautiful this statement is because it sums it up for me he says he said then when god revealed himself to him in the burning bush he found out then that the very thing that he that was in the burning bush was the thing that he lacked moses had the call he was trying to jump into it you know we do the same thing we read a scripture you know what i mean and we read that scripture and now we're just going to jump in and take that scripture no god's got a time for things he's got a season for things he's got a way that he does it you know that's why we've got to make a trip to the burning bush because it's in the burning bush is got what it was that moses lacked and and and and i think that's the whole lot with us today that many times we try to do the program ourselves and failed to get what was in the burning bush the direct revelation of the will and time of god now watch how we're operating we get out here and we start operating by our own faith we start operating by our own will we read a scripture and we see the scripture and now we say i believe that scripture now we're going to jump out here and try to bring that scripture to pass we're going to jump out here and try to make that work we're going to jump out here we're going to judge by it and when all that the scripture is saying is that's a promise to us it's an invite to us to make it to the burning bush that we can get a direct revelation from god about the time yeah what did he say about about the will and the time of god oh does that start to sound like our lives are being brought a little bit under subjection nobody wants to be in her subjection this is lady oseah this is i do what i want to do when i want to do it if i read the bible and the scripture says this then i'm just going to take this scripture and i'm going to take it and i'm going to start hewing a hole in my life i'm going to start doing things i'm going to start doing things according to this scripture this scripture has empowered me to do everything but remember god still got a time for that scripture he's got a season for that scripture he's got a will for that scripture he has a spirit that goes along with that scripture there's things that he has got to provide from the burning bush that you can have the revelation a direct revelation and the direct will of god it isn't just i'm going to take this book and i'm going to wield it anyway that i want to we're talking about maturing to a place and i want to move along so i can get to what i want to say this morning just for a moment but he said he says now us full gospel people i think have many mistakes by looking at the word of god and saying god said this and we fail to find the direct revelation of our life to fit in that program when we find that then it's got to happen and i think there's where it has been failed what did he say he says i think this is many mistake by looking at the word and saying god said this god said it but we failed to find the direct revelation and the direct will and revelation to our life to fit into the program you know a lot of times you want to pray for somebody god's a healer you want to do the prayer side well then your side's got to get fixed up many of you that know the message know how many times brother branham had to go get this right he had to go make that right he had to go get this he had to wait and not because there was a time everything had to fall in its order everything that had to fall in its place now what i'm trying to say is i want you to understand i don't care if whether you're in high school i don't care if you're eight years old my goodness they're teaching stuff nowadays technology and everything why can't we teach the gospel you know why do we always think that everybody's ignorant young kids can get the holy ghost god can deal with yet three o'clock in the morning beginning sure he can but to find out where it fits in our life so i want to take a good look at ourselves there's a whole aspect of the word of god that that gets left out i mean i'm just preaching this morning because it's my responsibility to preach for to you the truth and i know when i when i went through this i didn't want to preach it because normally i find myself to be the most guilty the chiefest of all sinners but there's a whole part of our responsibility a whole part of our christian life a whole part of things we go around talking about the word but that word still's got a personal place in our life a revelation of the will and the time of it and that something that you've got to to seek and and i'll get to this in a moment but if you're not doing that you will find yourself in a condition and because that's what we do so and so and and then if not then we end up comparing ourselves one to another we end up looking around comparing ourselves to this person comparing ourselves to that you know we end up comparing impersonating and copying and god's not interested in the group it's not a group revelation it's not a group action god will have things for you to do that are you alone and you've got to have the courage and the faith to stand on that exactly what god's dealing with your heart especially those of you that are under peer pressure you know one girl starts gabbing or talking i remember we had a lot of this little click stuff going on you know this idea well girls this age hang together i understand girls certain age hands together but that don't mean you're mean to the younger ones you're kind you're gentle you're good you give them a moment of time they don't understand all the parts of your life where you are what you're going through the things that you deal with sure they're younger but they look up to you they had admiration for you they they they care for you they respect you you've got you can't be a snob i know what god does with snobs he gets them out they'll poison you love everyone no need to have clicks go out of your way foot washing don't wash feet with the same person you already know you got dirty feet go find somebody else's foot you've never washed before you know broaden your horizons be gentle be kind be good and don't prove nothing to run somebody else down amen you know what i mean so teacher you know teach it's good we're not mean to nobody you know and i don't expect you to sit down and play blocks you know with somebody all the time but yeah i've seen kids sit down they play blocks with a kid that's playing blocks it's not your whole life but you give them a season you give them a time you're kind you're gentle they don't hurt you none you know don't don't be like that understand the individualness of it and let me just move right along here he says so he said so we can't come here so there you are so we can't do that we have got to do what god revealed to us to do amen billy graham is going to do that god has revealed to him a worldwide revival he's making good a show of it too i appreciate that i'm trying to do my best by the revelation that god has given me to minister to the sick people what god told me to do so it's important that we find our position and know that it's god's word that has promised it no where has he placed you this morning just for a few moments where has he placed you in him you understand what what did he do where did he place you first of all he purchased you with his blood that's what he did you were vile you were lost you you were there but you were in him before the foundation of the world he had chosen you and so you you had a place in him you you had a position in him it's where you were in him and and so what what was he going to do with that uh position so the first thing he did was is where has he placed you in himself look he he he he placed you in heavenly places let's just read again in ephesians paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus to the faithful in christ jesus grace be induced now who's this too it isn't to the unbeliever it's to the saints it's to the elect it's to the chosen it's to them that are in christ now you know this morning whether you're in christ or not if you're outside get in get out of the world get in get under the blood get under the holiness don't dress like these women out here in the world don't run around half naked don't don't strip down in this modern ladies striptease you might think you're only you're only committing adultery with every lustful spirit around you don't want to be a part of that which the end thereof is to burn that's not where he put you put you in him he placed you in him so this is the believers grace and peace from god the father blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places so he didn't put you in the world he puts you in heavenly places what do you think all this music is i know music's a tough one because it attaches to your senses it attaches to your emotion it's a very physical carnal thing the old riff of the guitar you know just a demon you know what i mean or you go down the street and someone's over there you know what i mean and you leave the stop sign and they take off and you're sitting there why it's spirits it's the world he didn't position us there he didn't place us there he didn't place us in the world he took us out of the world and he put us in another dimension another realm heavenly places that's where he has us this morning you can be there [Music] you can be in heavenly places i heard a statement a while ago that a lady was talking and they were two talking and uh she was talking about how long it took her to put on her makeup i thought man that's gotta be about two minute deal no she's got cover-up and foundation and epoxy and putty and drywall after you know and paint i mean it's like it's like a 45 minute deal you know and then she got these little you know what i'm saying what what is she trying out for the wicked witch of the north you know where's that at who deceived a woman in the thinking by putting all this junk on her face that makes her look like an old woman in a few years is is is pretty that's carnal that's deception that's looking in the mirror painting a different picture of yourself in the mirror and then telling yourself that's what you look like well don't ever take a shower because you're going to end up with the really person that god made you which is a whole lot better looking than any max factor deal it's the truth don't be deceived into that don't be deceived in all this eyelid shadow stuff up there somebody ought to preach against it because they sure don't look good to a son of god you know what i mean we don't need that stuff we're not sitting there we're not sitting there we don't care what the world looks like we don't care oh i got my own few little soap boxes i'd get on about apartment stores they ought to put all the private stuff in the middle of the store instead of all the private stuff at the door when you come in shows you where the world's at don't get caught up in the world the wages of sin is death the wages of unbelief is death you see all those counters and those ladies sitting there in this and they're sitting there pain that's death the death that's the death angel come here let me paint death on you that's right i'm gonna put the mark of death on you i'm going to give you the spirit of jezebel that's what it is it's the truth it's the gospel i can't change this god's got something else for his church it's called the holy spirit he's got something else for him it's called his life his spirit he's got something else it's not max factor it's not makeup it's not tight clothes and and sisters and a lot of you sisters that that that come you're my children i if i have improved my love for you despite your color your country your rates your creed but let me tell you something sometimes our african sisters wear their dresses way too tight sure it's culture i don't know where that gets beautiful we don't measure beauty by the outside we measure beauty by the spirit we measure beauty by the soul we don't have to dress like that we don't have to have tight tops on a scissors should never excuse the expression i i don't know any other word for it but i think they call it cleavage you should never show none of that just to be honest issue we used to feel that the collar bone should be from from there up could just cover it from the collar bone up you'll be safe i don't have no law for that i don't know i have no rule for that but i've looked at the godly women that i've known over the time that the scripture told me that they were examples your dress should always cover your knees standing in or sitting if you've got to do a 10-minute shift adjustment to sit down you need a shift in the soul first that's right i'm talking well i'll just tell you what i was going to preach about so you can just get to where i'm going i'm talking going to preach this morning about the church being lukewarm just think of it we don't we're not sitting there that's not where he's placed us he's placed us in heavenly places in christ jesus that's where he's pointless that's where he's positioned us another so that's where he plays with he says he where did he place us in himself he placed us in heavenly places in him that we can be full participants of all the benefits and blessings that he has how did he do it he did it by the blood he did it by going to calvary suffering a cruel death of humiliation scourging being nailed uh to a cross being speared in the sight hanging there and and and giving up his spirit that's how he got you here by by the blood there's no place we have no place to worship him outside the blood he he paid for you he died for you and then you can take that same price he paid for you and that's what he paid for your children your loved ones you're sitting in heavenly places in him and in the any so how did you get there that's how he did it they paid for it he suffered for you not to be part of the world yeah you might have to bear a little reproach you think the reproach of this present world is worthy to compare with the joy and the glory that we're going to have in him just think about it we're getting to the place we're just cruising along we're living every day i don't even know if i'll even get to my sermon i don't know how long i've been i've been way too long i should quit i think it's 11 30 right well what what's nine minutes like we got like it's just going to happen so and why did he do it let's just finish reading this he says according to he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love we need to get the scrub brushes out in our lives young people i know it's hard but these video games they're they're time consumers they eat you up what have you accomplished after an hour and a half of playing combat so you blew up 500 imaginary tanks of some guy in albuquerque write that on your resume dear lord today i blew up 500 imaginary tanks from some guy in albuquerque that i was playing mortal kombat with really really i hear girls play video games now too i can't imagine can you imagine a man and wife sitting in bed boom boom boom boom boom kill the other guy no this is going on this is going on this is accepted behavior it's poison flowing through the veins of the church keeping the church from climbing to the places that they belong we're out of position that's not where he positioned you say how am i going to give up this video game praise god that's why he gave us his spirit we can do all things through christ jesus who strengthen us he's got a spirit to do that he's got the power to do that he's got a grace to do that he can deliver you from pornography he can deliver you from music he can deliver you from games he can deliver you from fashion he wants to positionally place us in himself it's hard i'm not saying it's not hard but this isn't for this isn't for weaklings christianity is rugged it's real it can and you've got to come to the place that you've got to understand what the price he paid for you and what he's offering you and where he wants to place you in him why he did it and how he did it he did it with his own life he's he's here to stand with you a hundred percent why did he do it because he wants to have fellowship with you he don't want you to burn with the rest of the world he don't want you to live short he don't want you to suffer he don't want you to be bound with mental heart aches and mental headaches and mental trials and and fears and doubts it's not the kind of god he is why do we accept this garbage from this devil that brings all this trash each of you've got a responsibility to get the trash out of your life for the rest of the brothers and sisters that are sitting around you me too how long are we going to stay below the position that he placed us in he placed us to be sons and daughters the works that i do shall you do also that goes for i don't care how young you are if you can hear me say it it goes for you i've had many a young little child come up to me and ask me to pray for their mother or their father and see god answer their prayer god's for us he's not against us but we're just getting lukewarm that's the curse of our age the first thing he says in revelations because that's what he cries out and that's what he he speaks against him he said unto the angel the church of ladies write these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works i know what you're doing your life is not invisible to me i know what you're thinking i know what you're doing i i see you're you're laid right before me i know thy words thou thou are neither cold nor hot you just lukewarm we're all see i'm not condemning us i'm saying if this fight this morning this is what we've got to fight we've got to fight off the lukewarm spirit we've got to fight it off we've got to know he's got a will for our lives that we're foreordained unto good works in christ jesus that we should walk in we need to seek those works look at what god's will is in our life we just can't live our life day by day going on and leaving god on the sideline thinking that well i believe show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith by my works what does he say i would that that were neither cold nor hot i would that thou were cold or hot so because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spill thee out of my mouth what do you think the whole enemy wants to do to us is make us lukewarm let us pat one another on the back let us tell us we're the elected we're the bride we're the chosen lady we're the greatest ones we're the we're so good in other words really we don't need the blood anymore you know what i mean that that's already been paid no he'd been paying it for you for a long time he was paying it for you the first cookie you stole everything sin you've done along the way he's been there paying for it isn't it about time that we stop and fall back in love with our first love the prophet of god said he said you don't understand it he said because you haven't laid your hands on his head and felt the suffering that he suffered to pay for your sins that would sure change our attitude do you understand he's become a secondhand robe he's become a wallflower he's become jesus with dirty feet he he's he he our careers our jobs our social life there's so much stuff that's that's out in front of them anymore that that we've almost forgot i'm talking to myself that i've almost forgot that there's that god has he he wants to lead me and guide me into all truth and righteousness that that he's got a plan for my life things that he wants me to do that i should be seeking his face seeking his will what would you have me to do okay if if i if if this scripture be true and i believe it's true he says for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before foreordained that we should walk in them do you understand if you're not seeking what those works are i guess they didn't put it up go ahead and put that up ephesians 2 and 10. if you can find that just look at that you're his workmanship i'm ashamed of that if i really want to look in the mirror and say okay this is what he's done he positioned myself in him but he didn't position me where i wouldn't seek the revelation of his will where i wouldn't get go to the burning bush and get what it is that i have need to make the scriptures come to pass in my life it's a relationship church it's going to the bush it's going the spirit it's having that spirit move in and out of us cleansing us leading us it's getting into his presence because it's going to be his presence i can do all things through christ jesus who strengthens me you can't live day in and day out having a mental faith of this message and never get into his presence never come unto his holy spirit never get there and let the let the world pass away from you and just be caught up in worship and praise and let them give the timing of his word in your heart we can't go on day by day just letting the days drag on we've got to get back engaged i'll close he's done all those things for us he's placed this in himself he he and and he makes this great statement he says now for a moment if we could find our positionally what we are in christ what are you in him let's just finish reading our scripture hath predestinated us unto adoption of the children by jesus christ to himself according to his good pleasure you know what adopted means it means he's giving you everything that he was he's made you equal to him we know the whole story of adoption right the father would teach his children by tutor when the boy learned all the trade and all the business and everything the tutor would bring him to the father and the tutor would say your son now he's always a son but he say now your son is ready to take over the business your son's ready to do what you do and then the father would say son you go take this field you go take these cattle you go do this it's yours you do it you run it it's yours you're a part of me and that's what that's what he's that's why he's placed us in him so everything that he was we could be men to the men the things that men do women to women the things that women do the ministry our sisters have the ministry our brothers have the ministry our teenagers the young people have the ministry that our sunday school children have it's all him he wants to place himself he wants to adopt us in others he wants to transfer his authority to us that's what adoption meant the transfer of authority all of you that are sitting here he wants you to give you the same authority that he had all he's asking in return is some form of dedication some form of sanctification some form of acknowledgement some form of sitting in counseling and seeking his will his revelation and his timing otherwise we're like any other denomination he's he he's got something for each of us if we could just find that beautiful place by faith now that he who's addressed it to believers positioned in christ and christ will only meet the believer the believer can only worship christ as he's positionally placed in christ and then i'd like just to close with this statement so you can understand now i am closing now into his church you that's positionally is setting in heavenly places in christ jesus be humble brethren someday the holy spirit will speak to you call you out to one side somewhere in a little cabin or on a hillside or in the washroom somewhere and there will anoint you for a certain service or a certain thing to do believers positioned in christ one day he's going to call you aside in a maybe in a car maybe in a washroom and he's going to give you something certain to do it won't be it won't be the laying on of the hands of the presbyters or elders it'll be the laying on of hands of god almighty to put a new ministry in you a new robe on you and to get you out as an example and all the demons out of torment will never upset you god granted my brethren that each will receive this blessing just think of that it's so wonderful and so we have a place in christ this morning and we all know let's let's face the facts where we're sitting we're sitting in the most evil time that has ever been on the earth men with women women with women men becoming women women becoming men we're teaching our children not even to be a boy or a girl when god said that he made them male and female when god commissioned them to go forth and multiply where a woman's saved in in in in child bearing and and and so much of the scripture teaches us but the bible tells us that the time would come when god would sneer sheer their conscience with a hot iron and they would no longer want to retain god in their knowledge think of it because that's the way it was in old times the same way it is now the wickedness of our age i mean i don't even see how the cup of iniquity is not filled yet there's no there's no telling i mean look what they've just done that for years they shut down our businesses they put masks on our face we all fell into obedience to the government under some sort of fear and now they come right back and they say oh we're sorry the vaccines don't work does not that shake you to let you realize how unstable we are how unstable the leadership is how insane the thinking of man is but you'll understand we become numb the prophet of god called it amnesia but i want you to notice this even in the scripture before the wickeder the hour gets the more easily amnesia sets in the worse it gets the easier it is to forget what a high standard we live by now understand that the atmosphere the recognizing the day in your message recognizing everything that's going on the worse it gets out there the uglier it gets the more ungodly it gets burning down our cities burning down our courtrooms hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of good american citizens sleeping on the street the worse it gets the easier it is for you to forget it's hard to fight it's hard to stand up it's hard to shake yourself it's hard to seek the will of the lord it's hard to get into the spirit it's hard to crawl call out unto the spirit it's hard to get in front of the burning bush and say what do i lack because this is lady osea proud blind miserable naked and don't know it thinking that they what have need of nothing the worse it gets the easier it is for you to think you're okay we can't get sucked in church we can't get lukewarm i'm crying out to you this morning i know that it's it's hard right now we're suffering with parking but it's hard to come out the church it's hard to sit in your car but don't get lukewarm don't fall off now don't let up now don't think you're okay now find your way into his presence let him deal with your heart say what you have need of don't drift away and not closing with this statement because he made us to be a certain way and if we're not living the way he made us then we're living below our privilege and if we're living below our privilege then we're lukewarm and lukewarm is the danger of our age listen what he says this is in spiritual amnesia page 7 paragraph 50. so has god's people in these last days has forgotten what the testimony of being a christian means they forgot what the test ask yourself do you have a definition for your own life what it means to be a christian i got a lot of them it means that i'm not going to race that guy that's trying to get in front of me you know it means that i'm not gonna honk my horn at the person that sits there for two and a half milliseconds to respond to the light the world don't have to run at the pace that i run maybe god's trying to slow me down and i think the world needs to speed up maybe i need a trip to the bush to find out what does it lack lord what do i lack to have the love of god shed abroad in my heart what do i lack to have patience what do i lack to have long suffering what do i lack to have temperance i've got to the place that i think i'm going to cover it all with the revelation of the seven seals and the mysteries and the book of life and the lamb's book of life and predestination and and all the mysteries and all those if i you know all the mysteries and i have not charity i am nothing where where have we got to think that because we believe the message we don't have to be christians i got a a a good baptist lumber salesman i want to talk about lumber he wants to talk about jesus he never met nobody wants to talk like about jesus like i do he's just preaching away to me i says how much is two by fours oh you know when it amazing that nowadays god's just trying to do these things yeah brother thank god i thought i finally said praise god they're free they might be i don't know because you get out of contact with them you get out of fellowship with them you're lukewarm and you don't know it we don't even know what it's like to be close to the fire to be burned up on the inside lord let's get us back he says what it means it's again this amnesia has become upon the people now this is the definition of lukewarm to me they can't identify themselves can you identify yourself in christ this morning don't condemn yourself if you don't if you don't lift your hand and say father give me an identification moses went 40 years moses failed and tried but one day he met you and he found out that the bush had what he was lacking and i i i see my i can't identify myself i really don't know where i'm going i don't know what i'm doing i don't know what you'd want me to do i believe we're not talking about belief we're talking about rising above being stale and stepping into a greater move of the spirit of god we're not comparing ourselves with the rest of the message we want to be what the prophet of god said our church should be by the example he gave that our spirits would be right our love would be right our care would be right or nature would be right our fellowship with him would be right but he's got a time and a place in our day they forgot all about it they had forgotten his holiness they had forgotten his law the women were living like the rest of the women god's church and his people has always been a separated people a called out people a peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to god the fruits of their lips giving praise to his name god called this church and separated it from the world for that very purpose there's our identification a called out people a peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifice to god the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name hallelujah our identification our life we're not lukewarm we're on fire he gave us the law he must be holy he said i am holy you must be holy and without holiness no man shall see the lord i just try to take you on a path this morning to present to you that you have a responsibility to your life in christ you have a responsibility to not let the lukewarmness of this world and again in closing the worse it gets the harder it is the easier it is to become lukewarm because we compare ourselves with the rest of the world we're going to have a baptism [Music] this morning and i don't want to go too much into the testimony i don't know but miles is going to be baptized this morning and all i know is is that i got a phone call which i don't know what time you called matt but it felt early but i guess miles woke him up at three o'clock in the morning i've had a lot of calls at three o'clock in the morning most of mine weren't always that pleasant your son's down here at the place you need to come bail him out you know but i'm glad that they made it their way to the pool and the lord's dealt with miles's heart for several weeks and i like when it comes to that time when you can't do it no more amen maybe this morning god's moved on your heart that you want to make your life right that you're kind of borderlining that you're just playing the fence you haven't went to your home and you haven't applied the token you hadn't got rid of the things of the world you haven't kicked out the tv you haven't kicked out the dvr you haven't kicked out the games you haven't went in there and you haven't left the mark of the burning bush on your house in your life and you'd like the mark of the burning bush the holy spirit to place its mark on your life this morning maybe you'd like to do that this morning maybe you've never been baptized the pool's open and we'll baptize miles because god's dealt with his heart if god's dealing with your heart the pool's open let us stand this morning brother matt if you would go to get ready and one of the deacons will go help you but you want to ask yourself this morning i'm not seeing your lukewarm but i am going to say the world's trying to make you lukewarm and you'd like to lift your hand this morning to the lord and you like to say father i don't want to slip backwards today i don't want to backslide maybe you'll be even a little deeper honest and you'll say lord i i am kind of backslid [Music] a lot of mornings i get up and i don't read my bible i'm off to work a lot of my nights i'm just thinking of the problems of the job [Music] lord i'm i'm getting lukewarm and i i don't even realize it [Music] i'm cooling off [Music] and i never understood it's the very wickedness of the world around me that's cooling me off it's the atmosphere of the world is trying to infect my life in my mind and my spirit and i want to stop this morning and i want to say lord i don't want to go backwards [Music] i don't want to miss it i don't want to pretend [Music] i want to i want the real spirit of god living in me i want to be in fellowship with him i want to be in the place that he's placed me in him i want to sit in those heavenly places i want to i want the spirit of adoption to be upon me i want to overcome [Music] it's given to the overcomer lord you know i've got my hands up this morning and i'm saying lord don't pass me by this morning moses did all that he could do in himself and it failed but one day he found your perfect revelation of your will and lord i watch what i want i want to know where the word of god fits in my life i want to have a revelation of your will and your time in my life and i'm presenting myself to you this morning don't sit there cold this morning church don't be afraid to lift your hand to him say lord i need you [Music] i think when jesus asks those he says you who is without sin cast the first stone and the scripture says one by one by reason of their conscience lord and we're living in a day where consciences are [Music] beings branded and sheared with a hot iron where consciousness having no effect anymore don't let it be me this morning when i look at my life this morning let me be honest with myself [Music] if you need them this morning don't be afraid to slip your hand up and say lord i'm not ready to meet you i believe but i want to be better off than i am this morning heavenly father you know the hearts you know the hands [Music] lord i pray that you would deal with us as children father i've spoke what you've given me to speak [Music] and if i'm the only recipient this morning father i have my hand raised lead me to the bush lead me to that pillar of fire where i can receive what i have need of not my will but thy will be done not by power not by might but by thy spirit o lord let it be in me bless myles this morning as he you've dealt with his heart and lord you moved upon him i pray that you'd move upon all of us to the place that you would have us to be i ask these things in jesus name we pray amen as we sing this song i know maybe some of you have to go to work i know brother paul has been called back to brazzerville for a couple weeks for some uh i don't know how serious it is but he's been called back there so we want to keep him in prayer yes and

water i don't know if a digital light can shock you or not i'm not gonna be the one to find out you love the lord this morning you know he loves you he wants the best for you so that's gonna happen at this time the mouse go ahead step up speak out loud tell the people on your heart um i just wanted to say like um if god um really once is telling you to do something just do it right away it's worth it and that's all amen did you hear that if god tells you to do something do it right away it's worth it amen what great words of testimony this morning let us open our bibles if we would this morning to the second chapter of the book of acts and we'll start reading in the 36th verse the day of pentecost the spirit of god has fallen the disciples have come out under the street people are gathered in jerusalem from every nation every tongue and these men come out on the street the street they're anointed with the spirit of god some are thinking that they must be intoxicated others possibly thought they were mad but peter says no this is they're not mad this is what was promised that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and so we picked up the great story he says therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart who said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and your children and to all that are far off even miles and even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this up towards generation amen amen miles with the testimony that the lord has spoken to your heart and like the apostles of old your heart was pricked and you wanted to know what to do and the lord said be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and according to your confession according to the instructions of the word of god for our day we baptize you in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost by divine revelation we know that those titles were represented in one name the name of the lord jesus christ we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] amelia oh [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] from the castle of my heart [Applause] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
