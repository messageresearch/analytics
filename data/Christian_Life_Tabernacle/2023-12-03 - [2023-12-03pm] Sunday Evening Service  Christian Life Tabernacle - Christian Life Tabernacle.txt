effort to discredit the word of God to give us some alternative or some other way to draw a picture that is the one that he wants us to see but by your grace and your Spirit we see you standing in your word all powerful and true never failing always there on our behalf we're so grateful for that this evening father we've come to have communion and foot washing this evening to Fellowship one with another bear one another's burdens to serve one another and encourage us along the way father we ask that you be with us tonight as we partake in this time of Fellowship together we ask you to forgive us our trespasses Lord forgive us the sins that so easily beset us father forgive us our unbelief father and all that you've showed us yet so many times we're hesitant and we're filled with doubt father we ask that you not lay it to our charge tonight father but look on our hearts that we here this evening father to worship and praise you we ask you to bless us this evening in this great time of Fellowship in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen and amen hallelujah Lord richly bless you you may be seated for a moment this evening uh we're going to go uh right into communion here uh pretty quick uh uh uh it it never seems to um uh fail that every time that we quote that statement or uh we listen to it on tape where the prophet of God says you can have the Holy Spirit every day of your life and still go to hell that it doesn't raise a lot of questions so I I was going to talk a little bit about it this evening but I thought maybe that I would address it um maybe a little more in detail but uh um but you know it's also when you begin to think of it that God died for all the sins of the world everybody sins are forgiven but not everybody accepts it and you know when you just realize you see people all through life they'll take a portion of God's word and they'll believe that portion and the blessings that are with that portion of the word will be upon them because the word of God carries an anointing and so people that believe a portion of the word they reap that portion 40 6080 100% and uh but yet um we don't compare ourselves to the world or the rest of the world we understand that we're called for a special purpose amen we're called for the full manifestation of the Bride word in this day to to line up to it all by his grace and by his spirit so uh we do that you know communion is a special time too because it it uh gives us a chance to identify with Calvary and and what that he did and the fact that his word is is food for our soul and his blood has life and it and that blood was shed for us that that life that was in that blood could return back upon us we before the blood of go bulls and goats they would just act as a covering that's right but actually the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ takes that completely off our record amen not to not be remembered anymore and sometimes we remember it but he doesn't amen amen and and that's why he died but we were yet sinners amen he died for us so it that's the Great Fellowship that we have tonight in him is that that uh even though we still carry a lot of our human uh uh traits that he's covered all of it amen and that's what he says and if we are faithful and just to confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive them and and the prophet of God put it this way he said if you put red through red there's nothing nothing remains there's nothing that comes through that so uh this evening you could maybe think of all the reasons um why we shouldn't take communion why we shouldn't have foot watching you know I can list a a a ton of reasons why I'm unworthy to go to heaven I'm not worthy to go to heaven but I didn't earn my way to heaven I'm not presenting every anything to him saying Lord I did this let me in no I I'm it's by his Mercy Lord I'm here you called me you tugged on my heart you've uh you've let me see it I was ordained to see it I I I looked at it I saw it it was there I couldn't I couldn't deny what I've seen something inside of my heart believes it I didn't come to that conclusion you put it there you know if you wanted to go for reasoning nobody in their right mind would believe that God sent Elijah the prophet in this day I mean they read the scripture many will come and do this and that and they they write it off no it's not logical to believe in Divine Healing it's not logical to believe that that God would choose you but he did and and we're based on faith we're not based on reasoning I I read quite a little article about evidence there's there's in the legal field there's two types of evidence there's factual evidence and then there's uh uh spoken evidence in other words if someone gives a testimony and then and they say well I saw this I saw that that that's a form of evidence that's not factual evidence but if someone would present some factual evidence that but maybe I said you know I saw brother Tommy uh Rob that 7-Eleven the other day you know what I mean I know it was him and I I saw him well and I'm presenting that as evidence well that's evidence well you know somebody would have to come up with factual evidence to prove that wasn't true you know what I mean and then a couple of the brothers stand up and say no Brother D baby you didn't see Tommy uh we were out camping with Tommy and he freezing cold out there and raining and miserable and we are all out camping with him well now you got facts right to disprove the other evidence they're both presented as evidence but one's not factual evidence so you've got to disprove evidence that's not factual with the facts with factual evidence it's you it is what it is well for us the gospel is factual evidence amen it's not here say it's fact amen and we believe it just the way it is and we've seen it come to pass we've seen it do it how many knows God's A Healer all right so so many of you believe that God's A Healer how many know it by experience hallelujah amen now who can take that away from you amen how many knows what it's like to have the burden of sin lifted off your life amen now a lot of people believe it but they they don't possess it right the evidence of it and and so it's it's just like to me someone I I I don't care whether they believe that God sent a prophet or not I know he did I mean I've seen it I I put a quote up there where he actually talks about men wanting to be women 1964 and now we look around it and see that black cloud and we see they're helpless they can't help themselves they make statements that are absolutely idiotic it comes out of their mouth and you think what are you what are you doing how can you say such a thing as that you know what I mean and can you look at them and you realize they can't help themselves because the word was spoken and the one thing about the word of God is it will never come back void you can count on it Hallelujah you can count on it no matter how Satan tries to draw a different picture no matter how he tries to rob it from you you can anchor in that word that's how it is going to be it might not be that way tomorrow but we know it'll be that way and it's because God said so and that settles it and that's what the church is built on it's built on the word of God and by experience and the more that you go along in life the more you find out you save yourself a lot of trouble if you just stay with the Simplicity of God's word you don't have to understand it all but I'll tell you it really counts to believe it all so I I just trust that you love the the Lord tonight uh we're just going to go right into our communion service tonight and ask the Lord to bless us so if you have your Bibles let us stand together if the brothers would go uh prepare the communion and we'll take our communion service at this time you know this is a good time that that you can purpose in your your heart to make something right if something comes on your mind or on your heart as you come up maybe something that you remember the scripture teaches us that you that you you purpose it in your heart and then that you're going to take care of that thing he said then let them come eat of of that table if you've offended somebody and and uh uh then you just purpose in your heart I'm going to go make that right I'm going to ask that person to forgive me and and you go ahead and and and do that but it's a good time to communion is a good time and foot washing is is a good time of rededication of your life to the Lord I'm going to going to dedicate my life I'm going to get back on track I'm I'm going to apply the token I'm going to get rid of some of the things I'm doing I'm going to do better foot washing is a good time to purpose in your heart to expand the Realms of your fellowship maybe somebody that you haven't spent any time with say I'm going to call that person I'm going to go I'm going to spend some time with them I'm going to try to get to know them better uh you know it maybe a opportunity you to wash somebody else's feet that you've never wash before you know not just get somebody that already knows what your feet look like you know what I mean but uh somebody that you don't mind showing your ugly feet too and uh uh have them washed so anyway well let let us just let us just read here now as we read in of 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter starting at the 203d verse he said for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup so that's what you want to do you want to examine yourself you want to purpose in your heart to make things right you want a purpose in your heart to do better sincerely in your heart and then come into communion and and eat for he that eateth and drinketh um unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world therefore my breth when you come together to eat terries one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together un come the nation and the rest and the rest will I set in order when I come amen amen let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we have the bread here that represents your body father Lord not only the body that suffered at Calvary bore the our iniquity father took the stripes father that we might be healed but Lord also the body of your Believers father those that are part of you that your spirit dwells in that's fitted and joined together one with another that each part might Supply the need to the other father that we take care of one another love one another pray one for another we share one another's burdens father we Rejoice together we're a body Lord we're not a religion we're a people we're an elect people that have been called out by a voice in this day and we've heard that voice and father we're here this evening obedient to your commandment and to the example that you left us through your Prophet Messenger as Paul said to his flock be ye followers of me as I am of Christ father we can say the same thing in our day because we've heard the same gospel that Paul preached Lord so we ask you to bless this bread and this communion to the takers this evening Heavenly Father this wine Lord is the remembrance of the blood that was shed for us at Calvary father in the life of that blood the spirit that was in our savior that you made a way for that Spirit to return back onto the believer that that same Spirit would Quicken our mortal bodies father when the time for that quickening has come father so now father until then we remember remember your death your burial and your Resurrection we have communion father we rededicate our lives we purpose in our hearts to do better we purpose to apply the token and separate oursel from the world and the things of the world and we ask that you give us this grace and this Mercy father again we ask for forgiveness of our many failures and shortcomings knowing and believing that father you are faithful and just to forgive us we ask you to bless this to us now in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you
