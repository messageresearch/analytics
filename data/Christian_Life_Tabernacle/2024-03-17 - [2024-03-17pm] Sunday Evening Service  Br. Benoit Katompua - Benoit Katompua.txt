put myself aside Lord that you might speak to the individual Lord Jesus tell them something that may be a help to them Lord Jesus that's my prayer father anoint my lips Lord I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you musicians let's open our Bibles to Matthew 16 verse 24 before I forget uh brother Manas told me to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it reads verse 24 of Matthew 16 then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul let's turn again quickly to Romans chapter 8 starting in verse one there is there therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity with God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God I want I want us to really pay attention to that verse so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you he that raiseth Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live gracious Heavenly Father we ask a blessing on the reading of your word amen you may be seated so uh a a while back ago a thought had entered into my mind listening to brother Brandon preaching teaching on Moses and it's it's it's it's amazing how it ties into what Brother David was preaching on this morning about that seed coming to that maturity of you being known as you were known right and it's it's really important to realize something something Brother David said this morning that really sank in you know God's a god of variety right he's made you one way he's made me one way we're all different we may we may some may come from Africa some may come from here and so forth but in essence each individual person is is not like somebody else so God wants to see his life in you in the manner in which he's made you right not mimicking who's to the right or to the left of you but being Christ in your life in the walk he's given you yes sir right so we we find out in this day and age at times that the thought that came to mind was save it lose it lose it save it because brother Brandon would describe a situation he'd get into the well I guess you could say drama of of what happened in the time of Moses right when you read your Bible there's not much detail in the beginnings of the life of Moses but brother Brandon would say he he used examples from a brother he knew and then his historian books and so forth to kind of paint a picture to help the the the people that were listening brother B would describe it as such he'd say that Moses was a Moses was a while he was a baby and was born amram was coming in and he was weary from work like oh man Yosh you don't understand what's going on at work that man got I'm hearing this I'm hearing that they're whipping kids they're putting ropes around their neck they're choking the life out of them and man it's it's it's terrible and he's coming home and he feels defeated and he's like man like we've been crying and sighing and praying but is is God going to help us out of this situation right and Y better said no Abraham You' just got to pray you just got to keep praying because that's how we were made we just put get on our knees and we pray and the Lord comes to our Aid so he went and he prayed but would dramatized that he would get up there and he would pray and pray time and time and time again till the angel met him and said amram I'm here to give you a message there will be a deliverer born amongst you right and in this time the Pharaoh he was having a problem there was too much Israelites in that day and in his mind he was thinking if they unite under one Authority they'll be able to overpower us right there was more with them than there was that were putting them in bondage yet they didn't realize I how much they were in number to do anything about the situation that they were in right often times sometimes that's us right we we think because we live in this world there's everywhere you look to the left and to the right of you there's chaos everywhere you think you're surrounded you think you're the minority when in reality greater is he that is with you than he that's in the world there's more with you than there is against you right so it's just looking at the right lens of things in this day and age that we live in we have a lot of people that try their best effort to work out their own salvation right you you hear that there's this I would like I would say uh immature mindset I I had it myself where it's like you know this Christian Life is Like an egg you give to a child and you say keep it for a week right you imagine giving a precious egg to a 2-year-old and saying don't crack it don't drop it don't let no harm come to it and bring it back to me after a week now who has the kid that's going to keep that egg if you if you thrw a kids like I was I'm throwing it as far as I can throw it there's no point of keeping it it's to a kid he can't quite comprehend what it's like to hold something precious like that that's like you in your life why would God trust you with your own salvation you you couldn't keep it right you couldn't protect it you couldn't help it you couldn't redeem your own life so he had to put it in the hands of somebody that could so he put in the hands of the one that made you brother Brandon would would speak as I've been listening to the series of the book of the book of Hebrews brother Brandon is really taking his time to try to get the people to an understanding of something and he man if you ever get the chance to dive into that series because it's really been a blessing to me brother Brandon would would describe the situation that men find themselves in at times he would say in Hebrews chapter 6 number two uh paragraph 366 so with the spirit in there which is promised I give unto him everlasting life and they shall never perish did he lie or did he tell the truth he told the truth so you see how this interprets the impossibility is for a man to fall after he's once in Grace he can't he can fall sure but not back to repentance right and we sometimes have this idea right we brother brother David has been preaching about the law of the seed right but we we really have to understand in order for us to get to that place of maturity that that's been the picture's been painted perfectly for us in order to get there we have to deal with this side of us that constantly questions God the side of us that constantly questions if we've made it that constantly questions our Salvation that constantly questions how perfect we are you can't work on these things as long as you're in this question side brother Brandon would say in the Ser of Hebrews he would speak and talk about Paul writing the letters to the churches and so forth and he said he had his greatest trouble with the Pentecostal church right he said because they always had to feel something they always had to see something they always had they needed some type of sensation he couldn't preach to them predestination and for and for know an election he couldn't preach to them those things right and I I wonder for us sometimes if if we've got the if what we're looking for is trying to feel like a Christian like you know you know I go to church I get I get excited when I'm in church because I've done this cuz I've done that well that means I'm a Christian it's beyond that it's a it's a revelation that regardless of how you feel there's an assurance that something took place in my heart something took place in my life the desire is not the same I've changed when once you get that well now you've started something but if it's just a sensation if it's just an emotion if it's just something that will fade but you need something real and and brother benam would take his time into that and he said all I can give them is is milk because that's where they're at I can't give them this this hard food I can't give them this mature food so I wonder sometimes for us if we get in that trap sometimes we we may not necessarily be looking for a sensation you're not looking for a dance for a shout and so forth but I wonder if every time you fall or a mistake happens you get back and you question what it is God's done in your life and you say well was the blood enough did it did it really cover everything that it's it's not that the blood covered everything and you'd never make no wrong again it's that the blood covered everything even the ones you would make regardless of how bad you think they are the blood's sufficient you denying what Christ did at Calvary it's hard for you to go anywhere further in Christ's economy so long as you keep denying the power in which he bestowed upon you through his blood right and I I I I I begin to I begin to think about this and and I realize a lot of times that's that's that's young people you know some of some of you older ones not that you're that old but you might be but some of you older ones may maybe going to the same thing and you're not spared from this idea that man I I I thought I was saved and then you know I I done wrong and now I got to restart I got to go back to beginning and and I got to re-baptize and I got to redo this I got to redo that and so forth that's that's not the kind of mature life Christ is looking for he doesn't he doesn't want kids that aren't firm on anything that they're constantly shaking constantly moving you need to know where you stand according to the word brother Brandon would say is it's the way you you you see yourself through the word that's who you are it's not what you see through your flesh see we read in the scriptures here that there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus so if you're in Christ Jesus then you're you're out of the desires of this flesh you're you're no longer a part of the things that goes that this flesh wants to do you don't have that desire you don't you don't want to do those things right you're in Christ but I I wonder if sometimes we try to find our Perfection through the flesh which is why every time something happens you go back and say oh woe is me look what I've done I've done this I've done that get past that Christ did a finished work there's there's there's there's no repeat Hees doesn't have to go and die again for you no when he died the first time that was enough that was it he completely redeemed you so all the complexes and ideas that you might have of of of your trials of of where you see yourself of your shortcomings how where you fall put those aside they're they're not attributed to you in fact when Christ looks at you all he sees is his blood so it doesn't matter if you if you sinned 10 minutes ago if that blood was there for you if your name was there before the foundation of the world what you just did 10 minutes ago has got nothing to do with that blood it doesn't even exist right all he's asking for you to do is when you've done wrong recognize the wrong ask for forgiveness and continue on don't dwell there there's there there's this idea sometimes that we get that oh if if we sin you the devil gets in your ear and says well you know what don't pray cuz you know God's not going to hear you you've done wrong well you know oh I've I've I've made a mistake and there's no point of reading your Bible what are you going to read it for oh don't put on the table and do it for but I I'm sorry Christ died for Sinners he died for bad people that weren't good if there was righteousness found in you there'd be no need for him to die but you were nothing you were filthy you needed him in every facet of your life we were hungering for life so Christ come now and he's given you that life right and now he's asking you to walk in the Life brother brand brother Brandon would say it's goingon to go to go through some some quotes here that really really hit home for me in the it's going to we're going to be in this series of Hebrews let's go to give me one second brother Brandon would say so in paragraph one second here yes he says paragraph 444 and that's the way in Hebrews chapter 6 number two and that's the way this doesn't say that it's impossible for a man to ever get back then when he backslide it doesn't say that it doesn't say that it says it's impossible for a man to ever come back to renew himself after he's once been there he cannot do it the Bible said he that's born of God does not commit sin for he I die when death has been paid for how can I die when I got eternal life how can I do it you can't do it how can I have a written permit from the mayor for this city to run 60 M an hour through this city and any officer arresting me for any for running 60 M an hour how can can you do it I've got a permit from the mayor that says I can do it he can arrest me his arrest he would blow the whistle and everything else and I could just ignore it don't mean a thing I've got a permit and how can I then as after Christ has died for me and I become his righteousness become of his grace and love to me how can I sin when there is something laying there between me in God a sacrifice I can't sin can't do it God never sees me he sees Christ he stands in my place and when I do anything wrong Christ takes my place I made my confession I'm wrong he's right Lord you know my heart you know whether I mean it or not and I'm wrong forgive me God never sees it the blood of Jesus got me covered all the time then how can God ever see me how can sin be counted to me when he can't do it just as soon as I do it it's forgiven that's right just like taking a little droper like this eye dropper and take a full black ink and hold it up over a tub of bleach and just drop it in there and then try to find it again it just turns to the bleach the ink becomes bleach and that's what you confess sins if you're in Christ between you and God is a whole tub of bleach and your sin becomes righteous because a righteous sacrifice is waiting there for you how can you stumble either like brother B was said in the earlier quote either he Li lied or he told the truth where where do we now have the disconnect at where are we having the trouble at do we believe what he said or do we not believe what he said God called me to be a believer I don't have to understand it I promise you I don't understand it but I believe it wholeheartedly and it's because I believe it he brings that belief into manifestation into a life you seen the life is only proof of the belief if I I didn't believe it you there' be no life for you to see he would said when I come to the river at the ending of day and the last winds of Sorrow have blown there is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad I won't have to Cross Jordan Alone that's one good thing that's one good thing I won't have to cross it one of these days we coming down to the end of the road the sun will refuse to shine then God will call Adam will reach over and Shake Eve and say honey here it is it's time to wake up eveil reach over and get a hold of Abel say come forth darling it's time to wake up Abel will get a hold of Seth and Seth will get a hold of Noah Noah will get a hold on down to Abraham and down as they come there will be a great shaking and Awakening when the Son of God comes will stand in his likeness at that day now if you commit sin here you're going to pay for it and brother bam goes into a story here of a man that a man that was sealed he he had the Holy Ghost he was a genuine believer but he went away it didn't it didn't do away with what God had done for him because he was genuinely called God called him home said I can't let you mess this up see I I want you to understand just how rigged this case is for you you can't mess it up with your best effort you couldn't do it you could be knocking at the doors of hell open up Satan I'm here for a room you can't stay wherever you go as long as his name's with you you can't never mess this up see our problem is we here's this little life you know Ben Ben's been trying to live right since 2019 and so forth and Ben's Fallen oh I got to get another egg Ben's been living right since 201901 oh fall I got get another one and you it's not a cycle it's not a repetition of you continuing to fold and restarting and restarting and restarting no you come into that place where one of these days you'll drop it and you'll realize hold on this isn't in my hands you say Lord I don't want to pick that up you're the one that's in control of it not me let me just surrender it all and say Lord you take it you're in charge of taking the seed from this destination to the other destination it's got nothing to do with me right and and this this this thought had came into my mind and of this race called life everyone starting at a different point some some in a believing household some not in believing household but regardless of where you started the race began right but this is the only race that first place doesn't matter this is the race where finishing matters it's not about how when you get there how long it took you and so no getting there is what matters right and it's it's amazing because you're not in charge of doing it see you you realize that you started this race you said you know what how do I finish this race fast you know what I let me I know what to do let me go where the fire is at I'll get where the fire's at and then I'll get excited like everybody that's got the fire and then that'll mean that I've made it and you realize no that's that's that's not it that's not oh no no no maybe that's wrong let me go where the good singing is at I'm going to find those singers the ones that can really hit those keys and then I'm going to sing with them and learn to sing and then oh now I've made it no it's got nothing to do with that everything to do with do you have the Revelation that what Christ has done for you is a finished work if you receive that revelation then you have him in you and if he's in you how can you fail it's impossible to fail it doesn't matter where you're at a lot of the a lot of the young people especially you you you get this this idea this it's it's I don't want to say I'm trying to find the right word for it but you you get this idea that you're in charge of your salvation that it's it's something that you do that's going to Grant you eternal life something that you Merit because of your work or your deeds and so forth it's got nothing to do with you I sometimes I say man if Ben could just die enough that when I wake up in the morning I don't even think my name but I think Christ nothing else but him if if I could just get there to that place that I keep him on my lips at every moment in everything that I do that it's him that's seen it's him him that's speaking I would be content with that my problem is I'm in this flesh you're in this flesh but we have to learn to go in this flesh get out of the Flesh and in the spirit dwell in the spirit you can't perfect yourself in your Works brother bam would describe in the series of of Hebrews he was talk about laying on of hands praying for the sick doing this and doing that he said it's all dead works it's something you're doing you go and you lay on hands you baptize you do this all those things you you're supposed to do them great if you do great if you don't what's important is you receiving Christ you can't enter into a rest until you've received Christ brother brandham would say let me find it real quick says it depends on in paragraph Hebrews chapter 6 number two paragraph 355 let's start in 354 what does the Perfection do it's the wheat the wheat is God's word he uses it as his word it's his seed it brings forth it depends on what seed is sown in your heart if you come to church just because you're afraid of hell if you join church because you don't want to go to hell you're still a Cocker if you join church just to be popular you're still a Cocker if you done all these formal things that's to be done and that's all you got you're still a Cocker birg notice he said and that's all you got see there's nothing wrong with it so long as there's more if that's where you're resting you haven't made it yet he says excuse me but a real genuine Christian presses towards Perfection until the world is dead and you become a new creature in Christ Jesus then it's possible for that man then it's impossible for that man to ever fail what the Bible said see how he Compares with the rest of the scripture see how it lays right there in its place how can it say here a man that's once saved can never be lost and come over here and say but if you are lost or blasphemed it's impossible sure if you're a blasphemer you're not a Christian no man speaking by the spirit of God call it the cursed St John 4 or 1 John 4 no man speaking by the spirit of Christ calls Jesus a cursed every spirit of God that's in Christian Church agrees with with everything God said we read here and say he was wounded for our transgressions with this trap we're healed the old Cardinal mind say days of Miracles has passed I'm Dr Jones see there's no such thing as Divine Healing no such thing as heartfelt religion you're just a bunch of work up your emotional seed that's all there is to it there's nothing to it we are Presbyterians we're lutherans or whatever it is we know where we're standing but what does the spirit of God say Jesus Christ the same here amen says the spirit of God it agrees quickly with the word yes sir it's right there see what I mean these carnal forms Works death said Paul but where life is come this Perfection he that heareth my words believeth on him that sent me hey has everlasting life and shall never come to condemnation but is passed from Death unto life I'll give him everlasting life raise him up the last days all the father have given me will come unto me none of them is lost can't be see as we reading you're seeing this is Christ describing what he's doing I'm not seeing your part in this I don't see where no you you got to be the one to you you choose a church you write your name on the letter of the church and say I belong to this church I belong to that and so forth no it's dwelling in Christ finding your rest there in the scripture we read it says for they are after after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh how how can we say we're of the spirit but we still mind the things of the flesh it's it's real hard A House Divided can't stand you can't serve two masters you got to pick one so either you're going to believe and and dwell in the flesh or you'll dwell in The Spirit Well if you dwell in the spirit that means you have to deny the flesh deny yourself deny your thoughts deny anything that's contrary to the word of God put it aside and accept only those things which are of Christ that's where God's trying to take us but it's real hard for us to walk in our maturity for us to walk in Perfection so long as every small mistake that happens every small hiccup that takes place in life we we feel the need that we've got to now re restart again do Penance again and so forth and whatnot this this we're not babies we are mature people right a a baby when he's born and he falls and he cries you got to shake him arm and say no get up it's okay it's okay to fall get up try again but you as an adult when you fall you laugh you get up and you keep going that's how it should be in our spiritual life when we fall you said that that's not me I I'm not this sin I I'm I'm not this person that I'm seeing in the mirror this this isn't me the me that I know is perfection in Christ that's the me that I I know not not not this me that makes mistakes not this me that falls no Christ you said that I would be perfect sinless spotless without wrinkle if that's what he said Do you believe it or do you not did he tell the truth or did he lie right work work it out only after you've done that that you can now say you know I'm walking towards Perfection and brother Brandon would say I think towards the end of this sermon he would speak and talk about now we're entering into Perfection and he would say that the Perfection we're entering into if the doctor said oh you've got this sickness and so forth you pay him no mind and you keep going you keep going oh the Devil comes in your ear and says hey man you you you fell yesterday it's under the blood you keep going whatever happens to it's under the blood you keep going but so long as you keep dwelling on the mistaken it it's funny you you'll spend weeks on weeks on weeks dwelling on a mistake you made and Christ is like I want to bring you up higher than this I want to get you past this and and you dwell on it for so long it eats away at you like you have to feel remorse for it's it's funny how the mind works because you make a mistake you got to feel remorse for a long time for it to count as you really being sorry for it no what does the word say say what the word says and move on you don't have to dwell there for two weeks and say okay two weeks is a long time to dwell on this sin I think God forgave me now no that's not how that works the blood covered it the blood took care of it so we're moving on to a Perfection but we we can't get there if we're still back here we need to get into Christ and when you're in Christ it's not you living it's Christ doing the living for you but how can he live for you if you don't feed on his word because Christ is his word brother Brandon would say he's given he gives an example of 371 look at Elvis Presley in 1947 version of judias SC scariot joins Assemblies of God Pentecostal speaking in tongues for the Holy Ghost and set more souls to torment than all the bootleg joints there's been in the last 50 years perverted the mind of little teenage children all over the world till little girls would grab off their underclothes and throw it on the platform and him to autograph so vulgar that they won't show him in television from his waist down the way his body the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues for evidence oh brother if the Holy Ghost was there it wouldn't act like that you know better than that certainly not God loves cleanness and Purity and holy I don't act clean and pure and holy to make myself a Christian but Christ in me lives that in me and I love him and if I do anything wrong it condemns me right there I'll say God forgive me every day I got to ask for forgiveness every day and you do too certainly you do but now if if you're carnal you just wait on back and say oh well that's all right I belong to church see then when you blaspheme is when you don't have the faith that was that was once delivered to the Saints then you make fun of that and call it an evil spirit so that's a bunch of holy roles then you separate yourself between grace and judgment then you're finished forever Jesus said one word against it will never be forgiven in this world or the world to come and the Christian born of the spirit can't say evil about that because it can't it agrees with it that's right that's the reason people try to tell me that Pillar of Fire there that appears with us they try to say that was the devil that it was just fiction all this but the camera proved that it wasn't and The Works lay right exactly on the Bible same Pillar of Fire that met Paul has wrote to Damascus all these things that he done back there is doing it just exactly the same way by the Bible it's Christ the son of God and when we are born again we have everlasting life and and cannot perish it would be impossible for man to fall that's what the Bible said time and time again you brother brandom in this sermon is speaking of how impossible it is for somebody who's been saved to fall back fall off from Grace it's imp he's speaking to you not not those that that receive God in the mind no but you that's received them in your heart he wants you to get past you so long as you're here you always have you to deal with but get past you he wants you to focus on him you keep your eyes stayed on him and when something comes that doesn't match up with him you put it aside Lord forgive me and you keep going and you keep pressing we we can't save this life this life is too precious you we didn't choose to be here we didn't choose to be born in this world we were just here so why are we dwelling on the things that are here this is not the life God wanted for us though he knew we had to come this way but this is not the life he wanted where life is death can't be we saw that in the life of Jesus Christ he was life and everywhere he went if death was there it had to leave so now he's put that life in you now how can where life is the things of this world which are death be present we we something's something's changed something's different we need to get back to what was given to us that pure word that said a Son of God a child of God there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so continue to press towards the spirit continue to press in that direction sooner than later the pull this flesh has gets weaker and we weaker it no longer has the pull it once had and you'll realize one day you'll be somewhere and you'll say hold on this thing used to affect me it doesn't affect me no more you didn't do that God did that you take you somewhere else man I thought this thing man I thought I was I thought this thing really was a bother to me man I I I fought this for three years now I could care less about it that's God Christ does that but H how does that happen how do you see that manifested in your life you dwell on the word you stay in the word and over time you watch he takes those things out of your life himself they don't really have a hold on you you're the one holding on to them the moment you decide you know what I've had enough then something can happen but if you keep holding on to these things because you enjoy it and so forth you you you might feel sorry when you're in service but then when you get home that's the first thing you're doing well you don't really feel sorry about it get out the spirit of of church and and and take what church is supposed to be cuz you are the church bring that back with you home and say you know you know I I don't like this sin I don't I I despise this thing it keeps battling me it makes me feel bad I don't like the the where it puts my mind at you got to get sick and tired of being sick and tired then God does something for you but so long as it's just when I'm in church I feel sorry about it when I get home it's h it's too strong I can't get past it I don't know I don't have the strength to stop it's not your strength that does does it it's his strength that does it your strength is made perfect when you're weak because then you really can't do anything and Christ says okay that's a man I can use see and and that's the situation that happened with Moses just getting down I jumped around working towards a close cuz I'm here now but that's where my inspiration came from because you look at the life of Moses right Moses with brother bam would say when uh when they put the baby in the water and he was going on Miriam was watching it and so forth then it got to Pharaoh's house and his and his daughter took the baby and said and Miriam said would you like me to find a Hebrew mother to take care of the baby and she went and got her mother the mother of the child M josed knew Miriam knew as well who Moses was and what he would be so imagine Moses is in his Egypt surrounded by the things of this world surrounded by the trial surrounded by just he what could he have had he probably could have been been the Pharaoh General strong Mighty and so forth knowledge intelligence wealth everything's around him and you you you want him to identify with the slaves the ones that are beaten that are stricken that are despised you want him to identify there reject his lavish lifestyle to accept these people but that's who he was and since his birth his mother was telling him Moses Moses Moses you're the deliverer Moses Moses you're you're promised son Moses Moses it wasn't until and Moses was hearing all this stuff then finally he came to a moment where he saw a Hebrew man getting beat by a Taskmaster and he took it into his own hand and said you know what I think it's the time now I've listened to 300 tapes I've read all the chapters in the Bible you know I pray 50 times a day I I think I'm strong enough now to go and take to handle this I I can live God you can relax I got this I I I'll take care of this battle granted Moses was nurtured in this knowing this and he was genuinely called for this purpose but God called them so God could do it through him not so Moses could do it and it wasn't until Moses realized my strength is nothing and he failed and he got old and tired and weary cuz he couldn't save it on his own then God said now I can use you he said no but I don't I don't have strength I don't have he said don't worry about that I'm in control I'm the one doing it cuz the promise said the promise was that I will deliver you God spoke of he said I will deliver you he never said he would send a man to deliver he said I would deliver you yet he used a man and here you are you're supposed to be the continuation of the book of Acts you're supposed to be the one to finish this this race take the message that was given and go and live it now God's not sending you out without coming with you he's sending you out and saying I'm coming with you can't do this on your own you can't make this stand by yourself you cannot live this life by yourself you need to give it over to me let me be the one that leads let me be the one that lives the life let me be the one not you me Paul would show us I Die daily so that Christ might live less of me more of him we need to get the me out of you and put Christ in you and more of him brother bam would say the more you empty the more God fills so empty the you that's in there that gets in the way the you that wants to have something to do with it right it's hard you terminology in sports where I hated participation trophies personally I don't want to be rewarded because I participated I want to be rewarded because I won so I I I wonder sometimes if that's us where it's like oh you get this what they call impostor impostor syndrome where you feel like you don't belong where God's called you to this standard he's called you to be this person and he wants nothing to do with you in doing it he wants to be the one that does it and it's like no God I want to help you let's let's do it together God's like ah I tried with Adam it didn't work I I need to do this this has to be my work in order for it to be perfect I've got to be the one that watches over it and the only part you'll have in it is your lips shall be mine your hands shall be mine your feet shall be mine your thoughts shall be mine he's using every member of your body in order to live out the life that's a testimony that I want that regardless of the Mind battles and things that I get into that I can look and say you know what Christ you use me in this scenario you used me here you keep using me here and then surrender to a point that it's not me no more and I can I Ben's done Ben's done the best he can he's ran the race to his best he can't finish this race Lord You Take Control you lead you get there and you won't stop somewhere you'll keep going you'll keep pressing if Christ is in you he'll keep pressing until he achieves the goal the end goal whereas me and you will stop at something that excites us we'll stop where we're happy we're stop where we feel good but the Christian walk is not a Feelgood walk I I I really wish it was but the trials they're a part of it it you've got to be he's he's got to get the character out of you how he does it he never told you how he do it but he said he do it so in the trial Praise Him in the hard times Praise Him in the good times continue to praise him because he's working all those things to get the perfect character out of you desired for you so that you can finally be when you've completely surrendered and he's gotten that character in you knowing you as you were known and be that Perfect Image that he had in mind brother bam would say Satan raised his bride out of God's Eden in this day God's raising his bride out of Satan's Eden let's be a part of that bride musicians you can come let us stand bow our heads gracious heavenly father I I thank you Lord for helping me Lord because I I didn't I didn't feel good Lord Jesus but the moment I got on

perfect if it's us the name that was given to us was attached to this flesh so that anytime somebody saw this flesh they would mention it by name but father the name you gave us man can't see by the flesh they have to see it by a life that was the original life that the disciples had after people saw how they lived they called them Christians because of the life they lived they no longer had the memory of who they were in the flesh but they said no this this Behavior this character that they've now have it matches that of that man called Christ Lord let that be our testimony father that we so

believer of the true son and the more we eat it the more we unfold in that Perfect Image it's not by comparing you look I'm not that no it's by eating of what it says when he says you're supposed to be this way you eat that and you become I like what brother said he said when when you believe it's because the faith that came is what produced what you are today you didn't come as an unbeliever and all of the sudden you were changed no something within your heart believed the word that you heard something within your heart was led up it came to life when you believed it it brought you to what
