precious name we pray amen amen I love that song that's one of my favorite songs in it I just can't help but tell the testimony when I was a younger man I moved from California to Montana because I heard the message called choosing of a bride and when I heard brother Branham prophesy about the destruction of California that there would be a time that would come that it would go under the sea well I didn't know where when that time was so I didn't want to be there and so we packed up and we moved to Montana now this was a California hippie moving up to one of the coldest places in the world and I had never seen snow but we went there because it was the least populated state in the whole Union and we wanted to just get away from it all you know I was in my early 20s and and so we went up there and I got a job in a lumber mill stacking lumber and so the lumber would come and it would go through a saw and it would be cut into eight foot lengths in ten foot lengths and twelve foot lengths and 16 foot links and we used to call it the the chain and that so that the lumber would come out and it would be marked and then it we cut into lengths and then there would be men standing in a line and they would take the lumber off by hand and stacked it in a pile so one guy he would be charge of all the boards that were maybe two by twelves by 16 and and another day and he would have two piles of boards and another guy would have two piles of boards and so there'd be about six eight guys on this great big line putting the lumber in their piles and when they got done forming one of those stacks of lumber like you see in the lumber yard then the jaw forklift driver would come and take it and haul it away well I was working at the very last end I was the last guy out of eight guys and I begin to sing this song what a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face all and I just remembered I just got this stack in that lumber and singing that song and I stacked my lumber then I went up and before I knew it I was stacking the lumber of the guy in front of me and I'd stacked his lumber and then I walked back and stacked my lumber and then I went up and I started a stacked in lumber and before it was over everybody was looking at me I was stacking lumber for six guys what we're going up and down that chain with tears in my eyes thinking oh what a day it's going to be a glorious day when I shall see Jesus and we stacked lumber and I stack number and pretty soon there was no more lumber coming and I I guess I could say I finally came to and everybody was staring at me like what are you doing you know I'm sure some of the guys thought he wants my job no I didn't want that didn't want to be there you know but it was just such a miraculous thing I I'll never forget the feeling and the experience of what that was to me to be caught up in this and I'll tell you what you can do if you ever get caught up in the spirit is wonderful amen let's turn in our Bibles we don't want to be long but this morning I mean this evening but we do just want to bring a small thought or if I could say it this way something to our attention that we we should be aware of you you know and I I think that's always a good thing to Peter said it you know that what we need to stir up our minds and make us aware of what's going on you know a person that's aware of things do you ever get these I picked these I guess they're kind of emails and stuff you know or or scam alerts or whatever you call it that they want to make you aware that if somebody ever calls up and tells you that they're the IRS the IRS doesn't send you emails you know what I mean they don't send you they don't deal with you that way and and or they prey on old people a lot of times and so you know it's a good to be aware of what's going on so we want to talk a little bit about that that just a few moments this evening maybe we be out of here in 20 15 minutes but just to kind of make us aware of the place that we are and the things that are going on so let's turn in our Bibles to the Gospel of st. John and the tenth chapter and this into this great teaching the Lord Jesus said you can just read this all the way through and it would be wonderful but we just wanted to talk just take the first five verses this is very verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber my Amen there's one provided way and that's the shed blood anybody that tries to enter into the sheepfold some other way besides coming through Calvary's a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is the Shepherd of the Sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and the stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers Amen father bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen amen may be seated we notice in the scripture it certainly told us that that my sheep they hear my voice and I just wanted to just read very few statements this evening and and talk to us a little bit and to talk about that we have we have reached the condition and if I could say it this way and a time in our country and in this world and and the situation that were in they've we're kind of in a place that that nobody really knows what's going on now I would like to advise the world that there is somebody that knows what's going on Amen but if I could say it right that that we're in the age or the condition is right or I might say it this way the time is right for a lot of voices I mean I've never seen a time I I like to sometimes listen to Rick the radio on and I can't listen to people and talk Shore or listen to somebody and I've never heard a time of being so many voices now I don't know about next Sunday I've been told that April 30th it's all lifted and that we can all come back I've been told I've got a phone call and someone said okay you know I hope you have wisdom because you're gonna have to pick 50 people and and then someone else told me says no it's going to be half of what your church can hold and and then somebody else said no it's going to be extended and then somebody else said no as long as you're six feet apart and somebody said you're gonna have to have a temperature machine out front I think maybe we're older old ordering temperature machines so we can take your temperature before you to church why wouldn't it be wonderful if we could be able to discern who had the Holy Ghost amen you'd say well who would get in the church then the people that don't have it they would be the first amen Ezra just remember if the sick that needs a physician but then I can't just invite certain people because then people would say well he thinks I'm sick and need the Holy Ghost you know what I mean but probably if you think that way you do but when I'm saying have you ever heard a time that there's so many voices the seasons right for voices if it's a the time has been set up that there's going to be so many voices so many solutions so many ideas and and and you know what a time it is it what voices do is voices pull people apart amen I heard this I heard that I heard this I heard that and it's just a time that we've come and we found ourselves in a place of total chaos you know I heard I heard someone say that well brother such and such as preaching that the bride won't get the virus well I a man I don't believe that Bridal getting the virus I believe this whole sinful body can get the virus amen milk this body is not what the bride is anyway the bride is that word seed that has come to life that just it has taken over this body but we don't judge things by that what a voice what kind of voice is that you know the soul I've never seen a time so I just wanted to notice that Jesus spoke here that there would be a time that there'd be a lot of voices of a lot of stranger that and the sheep they know the voice of their master he says the master goes before them amen think of that the master goes before his sheep and they know his voice and another they will not follow now brother man preached this message in 1963 called the voice of God in the last days and when I begin to listen to it it never struck me so much as it it did in this present circumstance have you ever realized that when maybe a certain thought comes on your mind or the Lord quicken to something to you or you see something and you start to go back and you read in the Word of God and you start listening to messages it seems like brother branham's talking about it all the time it just seemed like all he's talking about his voice is always talking about his confusion always talking about this end time and yet it was there all the time but all of a sudden things changed and our focus changes um and when your focus changes you begin to look in certain directions you begin to listen for certain things you're trying to find something to set your bearings by I've been out on the dark ocean and I've seen it when you there's it's dark out there and there's not a star the clouds have set in can you just hear it laughing and there's no place that grab your bearing but the minute those clouds try to break there's one star there came in the morning star the know or star and it doesn't matter where you are there's a little triangle in the the sky of three stars that comes together and at point and a man couldn't me in the woods one day yep he was my guy he said if we get separated and we get lost just remember you see that triangle that triangle always points east that's East so it doesn't matter how you feel it doesn't matter where you think you are okay it doesn't matter what you suppose that was set by God and that always points the same way and that has not changed since it was put there in the beginning in other words you can count on that you can't count on your senses you can't count on what you feel you can't count on what you hear but you know that ceased and then he laid out the math and he says okay we're here if that star points east you go in that direction you will hit this road and when you hit this road you turn right and you walk till I find you it's all they had to do right no questions I had an absolute I had an absolute and when you've got an absolute then you have something that you go by something that that determines you know he told us that there would be a lot of voices a lot of voices and have you ever seen a time I've never seen a time of so many voices there's so many opinions okay so many thinking what is this what it isn't what it is what it will do what it won't do amen are you Aysen they called asymptomatic or something like that in other words you could be somebody that doesn't have it but you're a sprinter so I'm going to I'm going to put on my gloves and my mask and just in case you're a spreader if some people are going to die and some people aren't going to die and some are going to be sick and some aren't going to be sick and the whole world is going to do this and the whole world is going to do that then there's a whole another great big voice out there that oh we've overreacted who we shouldn't have done this and we shouldn't have done that we shouldn't have shut down the economy and there's another wall if we didn't we'd all be this and it's germ warfare and you know the Communists gave us this disease in another place no it came from a bat and you know what I mean and my goodness someone sent me a little thing that showed up bat in a bat sandwich okay I mean what-what a time you understand it but yet here God in His infinite wisdom in knowing the beginning from the end tells us he says and he sends us a message called the voice of God in the last days in other words there will be a voice in the last day there there will be an absolute there will be something to direct this and guide us so I think it's important that we see that the that the time is right now I don't know if you've had the opportunity yet to go but I thought I would just turn over in and read this I believe it's in it's from Psalms 37 I don't know if I have the the exact the verse but it's on the our song of the week and anyway it says if you go back and read it it talks about how that the Lord that the Lord will be our portion that if and I think the link is Christian life Psalms dot blog spot.com I don't know what a blogspot is but anyway I think that you can go there and press on that and it talks about bread and brother Mike's talking in this he's talking about how people have started making bread like they've never made bread before they've rediscovered making bread you notice something that I've noticed even around my neighborhood family sitting together outside kids playing in the street riding their bicycles things that used to be be common and can now we're coming into a time that that we understand that the Word of God tells us that the righteous will not bake bread but the Lord will supply our need so we don't have to beg a voice you understand when I say when I beg 'voice we don't have to find somebody to listen to somebody we can put our confidence in somebody who will take care of us he's still Jehovah Jireh Amen the Lord our God will supply us as a sacrifice he's still our provider he's still the one I think it's so amazing that what a a preview you know we never recognize how things come to pass but this is a plague a pandemic which is a plague you know you don't want a say plague because it becomes a biblical proportions well we're in a biblical proportion spiritual Kancil but you just it shows you when a plague comes it's not anything like we have imagined in our mind here goes man and man it's gonna look the voices start coming out and what are they going to do they're just going to throw money at it and throw money at it throw billions of dollars the first hundred billion don't work we'll send another hundred billion and there's all these people on the news saying go get the money from the government go get the money from the government from yourself run from your children people they don't know how a way to go it's the condition is ripe for voices if man is set up to where they were looking to hear something they're there they're listening to what they want to hear amen but we know that there's been a voice provided something that we can stay tuned I just want to read a few little statements because I thought this scripture was was just so wonderful in in the the scriptures found there that it's just very averse into you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is the Shepherd of the sheep and the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out amen can help that the sheep know his voice now listen to what brother Branham said here is we just read this what American needs is a voice of the prophet of God who could stand up and condemn Hollywood and condemn these things in the name of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost Church will take over too much confusion see too many voices of contrasts against it too much confusion too many voices so we ought to be aware we are now at a time that there are going to be a lot of voices a lot of voices the church its voice each one wants more members the Baptist wants it all the Methodist wants it all the Presbyterians we all have these and the Catholic looks like it's going to take it all and they will that's exactly the voice of God out of this Bible they will rule but the Most High God shall finally rule the Saint shall take over one day the Bible said so they will take over amen that's because that's what the voice tells me how about it friends buy your way out do whatever you want out that's exactly if - like when the Lord sat there and Satan offered them all this stuff to get them out of their trouble I'm going to get you out of your small business trouble I'm going to get you out of your wages trouble I'm going to get you out you know many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth them out of them all amen we will take over one day we're gonna rule this it's going to be designed and remodeled just the way we wanted he said I go to prepare a place for you amen he said I didn't go prepare a place for myself he said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also if it wasn't true I wouldn't tell you but if it's true I will come again and receive you that you may be where I am also what a what a beautiful promise what a voice to have comfort you what a voice to be able to trust in what a voice to have assurance in what a voice you can trust not economic disaster because the song told us the righteous they won't make bread the Lord will supply all our needs now which voice are you gonna listen to I like that little song we sing is what you believe is what you'll be amen this is we just read such an awful lot of voices then there are the voices of false prophets that's a terrible voice amen who calls himself a prophet a prophet of course is a preacher the modern word prophet absolutely means a man that preaches under inspiration he said now that's an awful voice that's an awful voice a man that preaches under the inspiration okay and I know I've shared it with you this is just for our church but how many times have you heard me say in my heart don't get caught up in the inspiration listen to what's being said listen to be what we not how it's being said but what is being said many times I've expressed this somebody will read quote out of a message and they'll read it with such inspiration they'll place it in a certain situation in a certain context and and they'll say it with like such an anointing and such powerful of expressions and everybody will scream and shout and wave their hands and start running around and everything but you sit down in a building and play that same exact tape where brother branham makes the same statement that they read and nobody budges not even at hand his went up because they heard a voice the voice of inspiration that's an awful voice I just read it now there's a prophet people that's preached under inspiration that's an awful voice because the inspiration he says the modern where prophet means a man that preaches under inspiration and there's a man who stands and calls himself a prophet and denies the Word of God and denies the truth of God there are so many voices you know that's why God gave us the voice of God in the last day he gave us an absolute he gave us something that we can find our hope in and not be moved a man just a moment ago anyway he says so many so many confused things what so many confused things the people get up and they don't know the word and they say things and maybe it sounds very reasonable I mean ISM is a very reasonable thing everybody the same there's no more capitalists they're all coming this did you ever stop to think that's a false revival a false revival we are at such a place where there's so many voices that somebody's going to offer a false revival what a what a condition what a time we're in see we don't want to walk into what's coming up in front of us blind we don't want to be listening to a voice that catches our attention we don't want to be tickled by some form of inspiration we want to be steadfast that we know there's a voice of God my sheep know my voice another they will not follow the Shepherd goes out before he sheep and he knows them by name and they know his voice what a fellowship but that we're in what a beautiful thing he says communism is it's a false revival and where did he and where did he pattern it all after Jesus says the two spirits would be so close it would deceive the very elect 'add if possible and everything the devil's got is a perversion of what God created sin is righteousness perverted a lie is the truth misrepresented the truth miss represented a person can tell you the truth and it be a lie Wow boy that tells me I need a voice I don't just need any voice I need the voice of God in the last days I need something that's really secure he said he says a lie is the truth memory adultery is an act that God ordained us to perverted all unbelief is the perversion of belief do you have to deny the truth in order to take the perversion see straighten out these voices know this to the messenger talking does so he's telling us something straightened out these voices did these voices straight in your life recognize them understand that their voices straighten out these voices because you can't let these voices start influencing your thinking you can't let them create fear in your heart about the economy you can't let them create fear in your heart about life they can't create fear in your heart what you're gonna do tomorrow you know what the bride's going to do tomorrow exactly what God's foreordained them to do because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord what's what we're going to do we're going to follow after him we're going to stay in the truth well we're not going to be moved so he's telling us we need to straighten out these voices in our lives don't let people start putting fear in your heart don't let people start trying to describe to you what the future is going to be they don't know what the future is going to be they say it's going to recover I don't care if it recovers or not somebody's got hold of me I'm in the palms of someone's that I can't be plucked out of a myth III don't fear though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil thy rod and thy staff they comfort me ok the Shepherd goes before us he promised he would he says and he knows us by name and they hear my voice and the voice of a stranger they will not follow it can yet he warns us that this is the time the conditions right it's rising up we see it everywhere voice after voice after voice after voice and nobody in agreement if I'm not mistaken that's what confusion is straighten out these voices test them by the word and see if it's true oh how we could go on and on on these voices of today but our time has passed but so many voices that people don't know what to do so many voices the people don't know what to do we know what to do pray and read our Bible every day those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength it came in like I said this morning amen we're fellowshipping in place not sheltering in place we're not hiding we're not hiding in our homes we're hiding in the cleft of the rock hey man it so he says so many voices so many voices the people don't know what to do the Methodists look will finally hear a Baptist preacher and they'll go over there and they'll say they're a while and then they'll go to the Lutheran and the Pentecostals they have a different group and one will run to one and one to the other and back and forth it shows you you're not stable hear his voice here it is wrote on paper the voice the voice will be confirmed if it's the truth Amen what a what a beautiful thing another word when these voices are moving your emotions they're moving your thoughts they're creating confusion they're creating suspicions they're creating wonderment I don't know if I'll have a job I don't know if I'll be able to pay my rent what David gets that bad will turn these pews together and we'll make beds we'll get a barbecue and we'll take care of one another we'll feed one another we'll do what we can hey man but we will survive because if God be for us who can be against us it shows when these voices and this is I'm telling you this is the age the seasons ripe it's a time through voice after voice after voice to start pouring in well I'm sure that everybody out there's got the answer can I tell you nobody out there's got the answer Jesus says I am the way the truth the life no man comes unto the father but by me so it shows you're not a stable and so how do you get stable here his boys you know what they here means that doesn't mean just dip the tape in your ear go about doing everything so it's just like background music it means sit down like we talked about this morning take this opportunity that he's placed us in put on the Word of God because this is the voice of God to us in this generation the voice of Malachi 4:5 that's been promised the voice that's got the message to turn our hearts back sit back and listen and hear the voice another one's here means to understand here means to receive revelation here means to have somebody speak to you and reestablish the leadership of the Holy Spirit in your life not go on what you think is leadership what you think is emotion or hope or stimulation but have a steadfast revelation and understanding this is the voice of God in the last days you have got to come to a place either brother brems of false prophet or he is the prophet because he said I am the voice of God to you I know you resent that but I am the voice of God to you that's either false or it's true and the question is you will not be able to halt between two opinions very long it will manifest when you no longer are sure it's the voice of God if if someone could get you to doubt and create a confusion then you've left that voice for another voice all on that voice will sound good to you for a while but pretty soon you'll find that you've drifted farther far they're from the truth and it won't be long that you'll be leaning on your own understanding providing your own protection providing your own future providing your own plan for survival why do I want to take my plan for survival when God's got a plan of survival for me if I could get in union with this Holy Spirit if I think it under the power because the scripture says you can say to this mountain didn't be moved you can say to this plant be plucked up can you imagine if I had the faith not a faith but the faith restored in me and my heart turned on God that the works that I do he said you shall do also what greater thing do I need in my life other than him but you gotta straighten out the voices you've got to become stable a stranger they will not follow they're not going to follow a stranger they know they're stable they're stable sheep okay he's a it's his hear his voice and he goes on he says you know many people I thought this was thing he says the church world don't know what to do the political world is in chaos you know I know the church world don't know what to do they don't know what to do with this idea of everything's being shut down you know we're just still having church you know what I mean the congregation is shrunk but hope we got a promise wherever two or three are gathered there I'll be there so we know he's here and we know you out there are listening and you know some people think well it's not the same online you can pull online if that's what God forbade it too you can sit right there this evening sitting there watching this old bald-headed great bearded man redo you what the prophet of God said and the Holy Spirit came quicken and give revelation because if the Holy Spirit doesn't sit between the ear of the hear and the mouth of the speaker quickening the word and making it a life we're dead and there's if it's here then its atmosphere you're feeding on and not word but the words the truth no matter where you are it's true in a prison cell it's true at a funeral it's true at a wedding it's true in the hospital it's true no matter where heavens and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away he said they don't know everything seems to be in chaos would anybody agree with me that this is one of the most chaotic times it's the most chaotic time ever seen my life okay and I was around in the 60s when the civil rights movement was going on I was around in the Vietnam War time when the Vietnam War was going on I've never seen any one thing affect so many people and put so many people into chaos as the chaos were in now everything seems to be in chaos fellows running from here someone else rising up some jacket some coat when I was in Rome they got 19 different vindicated nails that was drove in Jesus hands 19 indicated yes and there's only three but yet they've got the record that 19 different nails now what difference does it make who has the nail Christ never left us nails to worship Him he left us the Holy Spirit by his words these signs shall follow them that believe they will have I love this Jesus Christ never left us nails to worship Him he left us the Holy Spirit by his words these signs shall follow them that believe they'll have the original nail hey man who's got the nail you know who's got the result of Calvary who's got the that what the nails really were they're working or the Holy Spirit on the believer amen these signs show that's the original nail these signs shall follow them that believe they'll belong to a denomination I started he started none see how the voice is contrary oh my I'm telling it he gave us a voice he gave us a voice four times like these that's a song that that I think the first time I ever heard it was by George Beverly Shea in times like these we need a Savior in times like these we need the voice of God 19 different nails amen but these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils there's the word they shall speak with new tongues take up serpents that would not harm them if they drink deadly things it would not bother them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and you watch these things plus all the rest of the scriptures put together now this is what we ought to be contending for that kind of faith that kind of assurance now that only will confirm it not at all there there's where we Pentecostals get on the wrong road did Jesus say many will come to me in that day and say Lord have I not done mighty things in your name have I not prophesied in your name have I not done all these things in your name and Jesus said depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you do you see my brothers and sisters my brothers why I'm so condemning and indicted this generation you might speak with tongues like men and angels you might dance in the spirit all around the church that has nothing to do with it I've seen mohammedans dance around like that I've heard the doctors witch doctors camps in seeing witches stand up and speak in tongues and interpret it and tell exactly what's going to happen and it happened that way I've seen pencils rise up and write in unknown tongues and only one there could read it and was the devil you can't base your eternal destination upon some sensation Satan can impersonate any of those sensations if to know Christ something's changes in your life watch your life and pattern it with the word see see where you're at take inventory certainly and that what we're talking about taking inventory yeah am I in tune with the voice do I understand that there's a voice that's been sent no man is never the same you may hear in your ears a voice speaking but when you hear in your heart the voice speaking see then you're hearing you do not see with your eyes you look with your eyes and you see with your heart you see something I just don't see it you mean you don't understand it you do not hear it with your ears you hear it with your heart many times your ears here's the true voice of God and it falls off of you like water off the duck's back but when you really hear you hear with your heart and that's the beautiful thing that the voice of God does it comes and it turns the heart so when we're talking about penny something straight find the voice that speaks to your heart oh wonderful programs all the unemployment that's going to be paid that's good all the subsidies that's wonderful but it's going to run out it's going to be spent I remember when my rent was $60 a month nice little two room place living room bathroom nice kitchen single car garage nice beautiful place $60 a month I remember my rent got raised to $80 a month $80 a month I laid on the floor praying to God where where am I going to get $80 a month and then the mill shut down and I was unemployed and I didn't know what I was doing there and pray Oh God one day a guy come knocking on my door he was the local garbage man everybody in the city despised the guy he was the town drunk well when that town drunk knocked on my door and offered me work he looked like an angel to me and God provided because always will provide you always will we have a bread of life I am the bread of life that cometh down from heaven you'll live by me amen and he's provided us a voice so give this last hour in this age we're going to hear more voices more ideas more solutions we're gonna hear more fear we're going to hear more threats
