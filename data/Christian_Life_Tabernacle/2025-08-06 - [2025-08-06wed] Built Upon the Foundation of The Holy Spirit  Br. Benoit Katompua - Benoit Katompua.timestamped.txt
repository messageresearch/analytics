[23:11] He's certainly been good to me. And as
[23:13] we go to him in prayer for these needs,
[23:17] just remember how good he's been to you.
[23:19] And he's been so faithful. If we'll bind
[23:22] our hearts together in faith, believing,
[23:24] God will do the impossible. Amen. Let's
[23:27] pray. Heavenly Father,
[23:30] Lord, we
[23:32] count it a privilege, Lord, to
[23:35] be able to go to your throne of grace
[23:38] and realize that
[23:41] there was a way made for us, Lord, when
[23:45] Lord, we didn't have no way back to you,
[23:48] Lord. There was one that expressed a
[23:51] love that won our heart. And Lord, you
[23:55] desired fellowship, Lord. And when we
[23:58] look back in our lives and see, Lord,
[24:00] when lost loved ones went away, you were
[24:03] there to comfort. And Lord, when we
[24:07] needed a healing touch, Lord, you
[24:09] provided it, Lord. And so we believe,
[24:13] God, that if you did it for us, Lord,
[24:15] that Lord, you'll do it again, Lord,
[24:18] because you're the same God. And father
[24:20] surely
[24:22] the loss of a loved one for brother Cus
[24:26] Lord and the family Lord you're the only
[24:29] one that can bring peace that can touch
[24:31] a heart Lord to settle Lord the inside.
[24:36] And so we prayed that you would go and
[24:38] that your spirit Lord would bring about
[24:41] the comfort and the change, Lord. And
[24:43] pray you'd give them revelation, Lord,
[24:46] beyond the circumstance, Lord. And
[24:49] surely if, oh God, the stripes that you
[24:52] bore, Lord, you didn't do it in vain.
[24:54] And so as believers here binding
[24:57] together, Lord, for those that are sick
[24:59] in our midst and those that have been,
[25:02] Lord, pleading for loved ones, Lord, we
[25:04] pray that those stripes would affect
[25:06] effectually work for those that it can
[25:08] bring you honor and that it can bring
[25:11] testimonies, Lord, to the house of God
[25:13] and that it would encourage our faith,
[25:15] Lord, to ask more, Lord, because that's
[25:17] what you desire through these
[25:20] difficulties and trials, Father. And so
[25:23] as we commit them to you, Lord, we just
[25:25] ask that Lord, as we're remembering the
[25:27] work of our pastor and the burden that
[25:30] you placed upon him, Lord, we pray that
[25:32] your mercy and grace would be his
[25:34] portion, Lord. And I pray that you'd
[25:37] God, strengthen him where he's weak. And
[25:40] Lord, give him excitement, encouragement
[25:43] that he's doing your will, Lord. That's
[25:45] what our prophet taught us, Lord, about
[25:48] overseas work. So we just pray that you
[25:51] bless Sister Leslie and help them, Lord.
[25:54] May they have good success. And Father,
[25:56] as the tithes and offerings will be
[25:58] collected here, Lord, pray that you'd
[26:00] multiply it that it can be used for your
[26:02] kingdom, Father. Ultimately, our desire
[26:05] and prayer today, Lord, is that you
[26:07] would quicken life to us, Lord. That
[26:09] you'd give us revelation by your word.
[26:12] So use the man of God, Lord, and may we
[26:14] hear, lift to ear from you today, and
[26:16] that it might change us, Lord. We're so
[26:19] desirous of it. So, we're committing
[26:21] ourselves to you, Lord, under
[26:23] expectation in Jesus Christ's name.
[26:26] Amen.
[26:32] I have a source
[26:36] [Music]
[26:38] of strength when I am weak.
[26:47] God thinks me through.
[26:52] When life
[26:54] is prayer, sing me.
[27:01] I have a source
[27:07] of power
[27:10] from above.
[27:13] Hallelujah.

[35:48] all that this world could give you.
[35:51] Satan scratching at you, fighting at
[35:53] you. But one dip in that water,
[35:58] it'll change you forever, Lord Jesus.
[36:01] Father, what we need more in this hour,
[36:03] Lord Jesus, get back to the fountain,
[36:06] Lord Jesus.
[36:08] Oh, Father, if you hadn't shed your
[36:09] blood at Calvary, Lord, where would we
[36:12] be, Father? Some of us working our way
[36:15] to hell, Lord Jesus, fighting to tanel.
[36:19] But because of that blood, Lord Jesus,
[36:22] it reached down where we were, Father,
[36:24] and it pulled us out of that condition,
[36:26] Lord Jesus. We can be thankful, Lord
[36:28] Jesus, for that blood, Lord Jesus.
[36:32] It doesn't miss, Father. It's not happen
[36:34] chance. It's not a mistake, but it's all
[36:37] for the elected, Lord Jesus.
[36:40] Oh, we thank you to be gathered amongst
[36:42] the elect, Lord Jesus, that have been
[36:45] purchased by your blood, Lord Jesus.
[36:48] Your prophet said, "If you have your day
[36:50] at Calvary, God will have his way with
[36:52] you." We just want to come before you
[36:54] now, Lord Jesus.
[36:57] Put me aside, Father. Speak something to
[37:00] your people, Lord Jesus. Minister to the
[37:03] hearts, Father. If it's just one soul,
[37:06] Father, it was worth the trip, Lord
[37:08] Jesus.
[37:10] But father, your spirit knows what every
[37:12] single one of your children has need of
[37:14] in this house. Lord, you can say
[37:16] something to them, Lord. Maybe if it's
[37:19] encouraging, Lord Jesus, something to
[37:21] bless that they can go back and say, "It
[37:24] was good to be in the house of the Lord.
[37:27] Calm my nerves, Lord Jesus. Have your
[37:30] way in the service, Father.
[37:33] Be with our pastor, Lord Jesus, and
[37:34] Sister Leslie. want to continue to
[37:37] remember and pray for them, Lord Jesus.
[37:40] Give them strength, Lord Jesus, and
[37:42] bring them both back to us safely.
[37:44] Father, we ask this in the precious name
[37:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[37:52] God bless you, saints.
[37:56] Let's just turn as we're standing to
[37:59] Romans chapter 6. Thank you, musicians.
[38:05] You know, I was going to say I'm going
[38:07] to I'm going to try not to be long.
[38:10] I really don't know what's going to
[38:12] happen.
[38:14] But I have my timer. So once it hits 45,
[38:18] I'm going to do what Billy does best and
[38:21] just walk that way.
[38:26] Let's read Romans uh chapter 8 verse 6
[38:29] to10. It reads, "For to be carnally
[38:32] minded," let's jump up to five.
[38:36] And this this is titled conflict of the
[38:38] spirit with the flesh, right? And before
[38:42] we read this, I want to point out
[38:43] something here. It's not talking about
[38:46] your first nature. This is conflict with
[38:48] the spirit and the flesh. We know that
[38:52] you had to have a new birth. It wasn't
[38:54] that the flesh was reborn, but something
[38:56] on the inside had to be reborn. So as we
[39:00] read this, let's keep that in mind.
[39:02] There's a conflict between the spirit,
[39:04] what is the spirit? For they that are of
[39:06] the flesh do mind the things of the
[39:08] flesh, but they that are after the
[39:10] spirit the things of the spirit. For to
[39:13] be carnally minded is death, but to be
[39:16] spiritually minded is life and peace.
[39:20] Because the carnal mind is at enmity
[39:22] against God. For it is not subject to
[39:25] the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[39:29] We could close the Bible there and close
[39:31] service.
[39:33] Your flesh cannot and will never be
[39:37] minding the things of God. It's
[39:40] impossible for your flesh to do so. But
[39:44] that spirit on the inside was called for
[39:47] this.
[39:49] He says, "So then they that are in the
[39:52] flesh cannot please God."
[39:56] And then we'll turn one more to 1
[39:59] Corinthians chapter 3.
[40:06] We'll read in verse 10- 16.
[40:13] This is uh Paul speaking, "A carnal
[40:15] state prevents spiritual growth."
[40:18] This is when he's speaking to the church
[40:19] of the of Corinthians talking about I've
[40:21] given you milk and all these different
[40:22] things and because you're carnally
[40:23] minded you're not able to grow. And he
[40:26] makes this statement in verse 10.
[40:29] According to the grace of God which is
[40:30] given unto me as a wise master builder,
[40:34] I have laid the foundation and another
[40:37] buildeth there on. But let every man
[40:40] take heed how he buildth thereupon. For
[40:44] other foundations can man lay,
[40:48] for other foundations can no man lay
[40:52] than that that is laid, which is Jesus
[40:55] Christ. Now if any man build upon this
[40:58] foundation, gold, silver, precious
[41:01] stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's
[41:04] work shall be made manifest. For the day
[41:07] shall declare it, because it shall be
[41:10] revealed
[41:11] by fire, and the fire shall try every
[41:14] man's work of what sort it is. If any
[41:18] man work abide with which he had built
[41:21] thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If
[41:24] any man's work shall be burned, he shall
[41:27] suffer loss. But he himself shall be
[41:30] saved, yet so as by fire. Know ye not
[41:34] that ye are the temple of God and that
[41:37] the spirit of God dwelleth in you. A
[41:40] gracious heavenly father, we want to ask
[41:42] a blessing on the reading of your word.
[41:44] You may be seated.
[41:52] I've been uh
[41:55] pondering a thought. All all all you can
[41:57] really do as a human is look inward.
[42:03] because if you look outward, you won't
[42:04] find nothing you like.
[42:08] So, you got to look on the inside.
[42:12] And the thought came to my mind, I
[42:15] guess, it's a title, but
[42:18] I don't know the the way the Lord was
[42:20] was was was dealing with me, it's like I
[42:22] was pulled in a lot of different
[42:24] directions, but I'm going to just try to
[42:27] stay in the channel I feel in my heart.
[42:29] If I were to give this a title, it'd be
[42:32] built upon the foundation of the Holy
[42:34] Spirit. And for a subtitle, I'd call it
[42:37] the indwelling spirit. Now, we we know
[42:40] the prophet of God speaks about an
[42:43] indwelling spirit. Speaks about having
[42:45] the person of Jesus Christ living on the
[42:46] inside.
[42:48] It's it's different from feeling the
[42:50] effects of the spirit. This is something
[42:52] that happens on the inside. It's a
[42:54] change, right? Brother Brandham says
[42:57] just to to lay a foundation before the
[42:59] foundation. He says an expectation. Now
[43:02] then we're going to use the expectation.
[43:04] Usually you get what you expect to come
[43:08] to church tonight just saying I'm going
[43:10] over there. I'm going over there to find
[43:11] something that I know that's wrong.
[43:14] Don't worry. The devil will show you
[43:16] plenty of it.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. You usually get what you
[43:20] expect. If you come expecting to get a
[43:22] blessing from God, God will see that you
[43:25] get it.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; What you expect, you say, "Well, I don't
[43:28] expect it to be." Well, that's the
[43:30] reason it isn't.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; You've got to believe it.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; And you believe it to be right. Look at
[43:36] the right things. Examine it right.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; This is a prophet's advice to us sons
[43:43] and daughters of God, that we have to
[43:45] come into the house of the Lord
[43:46] expecting something,
[43:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:49] We don't just come because it's a
[43:50] Wednesday. We don't just come because
[43:52] it's a Sunday, but there's something
[43:54] that he's doing here. And I I I begin to
[43:57] look within myself and I'm like, man,
[43:59] you know, you you start counting all the
[44:01] services you probably attend since you
[44:03] were born. And you start tracking and
[44:05] saying, man, I've been to over 200 some
[44:08] services. You you wouldn't be able to
[44:10] fathom how many services you've been to.
[44:12] You know what remains common? No matter
[44:14] how seasoned you've been in this
[44:15] message, no matter how long you've been,
[44:17] it doesn't matter. What remains common
[44:19] is this flesh is still your enemy.
[44:22] Nothing changes. From the first from the
[44:24] person that just came to Christ to the
[44:26] one that's been here years,
[44:28] don't don't get it misconred or
[44:31] misunderstood. Everybody still fights.
[44:34] Everybody still struggles. Your flesh is
[44:37] still a problem. It doesn't matter who
[44:39] you are, what office you hold. Our
[44:42] prophet was inspired from struggles. He
[44:44] was inspired from what you would call
[44:47] falling or fails. And he showed it to
[44:50] you. So it got it got me thinking. I was
[44:54] like, man,
[44:56] let me just look at my life. We live in
[44:59] the comm in I guess you'd call the
[45:00] message community or message society
[45:03] where
[45:05] the biggest thing is identifying the
[45:10] spirit in you in spite of your failures,
[45:15] in spite of everything else. Trying to
[45:18] see how is it could God be in me?
[45:23] and and and you you every time you fall,
[45:25] you you question, man, is God really
[45:28] living on the inside. Is has he really
[45:30] done a work in me? Am I really saved
[45:33] like I say I'm saved? You know, I have
[45:35] this desire in my heart. I want these
[45:37] things, but I I I can't seem to live up
[45:40] to the desire that I have on my heart.
[45:43] And you start to have this struggle,
[45:45] right? And it it it struck me when as
[45:47] brother Matthew was preaching and
[45:49] brother Billy was preaching, a statement
[45:51] both of them alluded to is God didn't
[45:54] save you one day so then you could be
[45:56] unsaved the next day. It's it's as long
[46:00] as you're questioning what's inside you,
[46:03] you can't do the greater works. It's
[46:06] physically impossible because how can
[46:08] you tell somebody of the greater work
[46:10] which is the salvation of Christ if you
[46:12] yourself doubt every moment of the day
[46:15] the salvation he gave you? See, and the
[46:18] problem that happens is we start to
[46:19] misidentify what salvation is. But as we
[46:23] read here, I don't know if you if you
[46:25] read it the way that I read it, my Bible
[46:27] told me that I couldn't please him in
[46:29] the flesh.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; It's impossible. Yet what I found within
[46:34] myself is my greatest deception to
[46:37] myself is my own efforts.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; What I'm able to do, what I'm able to
[46:43] comprehend, what I'm able to muster up
[46:45] my program of salvation,
[46:48] &gt;&gt; it it doesn't matter. Oh, but you know,
[46:49] I'm I'm Holy Ghost fil that. You still
[46:52] have this flesh
[46:54] &gt;&gt; that every time you fall, it's like, you
[46:56] know, I'm going to wallow in my sin for
[46:57] a little bit and then I'm going to do
[46:59] works of penance. You said, but I'm not
[47:01] Catholic. But you still act like it. I'm
[47:03] going to do works of penance so that I
[47:04] can feel that I've done enough. Now the
[47:06] Lord's forgiven my sin because I've
[47:07] worked. I've done this. But David said
[47:09] he needed help at the church. Real men.
[47:11] I was there. Therefore, I'm good. Just
[47:14] trying to muster up something to
[47:16] identify yourself as having covered the
[47:20] sin by works.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; But if there was anything you could do
[47:23] for your salvation, Christ died in vain.
[47:26] We've all heard him. We've heard him say
[47:28] that. I got I got to look and all you
[47:31] can really do is look at yourself. I was
[47:34] born in the message. Being born in the
[47:36] message is very different from coming
[47:39] from the world. If you come from the
[47:41] world, you have almost a line that you
[47:44] could look at and say, "All my
[47:46] affections and everything that I knew
[47:48] was of the world." And then all of a
[47:50] sudden something happened and now all my
[47:53] affections, everything that I desire is
[47:55] of the Lord. But if you're born in the
[47:58] message, I want to be careful with how I
[48:00] say this. It's it's a different kind of
[48:03] struggle. For you to see that line takes
[48:06] a little bit more effort
[48:10] because you believe the message
[48:11] legalistically.
[48:13] See, I knew the message was real. I was
[48:16] born in it. There was never a moment in
[48:18] my life or time where I doubted the
[48:21] message at all. I knew it was the truth.
[48:25] And there were certain things that I
[48:26] didn't do because I knew mom and dad
[48:28] said the message is this. This is the
[48:30] message. I knew what the message said.
[48:32] So I didn't partake in certain things.
[48:34] But that's not salvation.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; That's my own righteousness. That's me
[48:38] looking at the law and saying because
[48:41] this brother Brandon would say that the
[48:44] greatest mistake Israel made I believe
[48:47] was Exodus chapter uh was that 19 I
[48:50] believe 19 when they said when the law
[48:53] was given to them and they spoke back
[48:55] and said all these things that you said
[48:57] we will do.
[48:59] How foolish. All these things we will
[49:02] do. With what strength?
[49:04] &gt;&gt; With what ability? This man longs for
[49:08] nothing but the things of this world.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; It doesn't get satisfied by the things
[49:12] of God. The sensations you feel in this
[49:14] flesh because of the world far outweighs
[49:17] anything you'd feel in this flesh by the
[49:19] spirit.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; But the thing on the inside that God
[49:22] placed in each and every single one of
[49:24] you speaks so much more louder than
[49:28] anything this flesh can attach to.
[49:31] I got to just got to thinking with
[49:32] myself, man. You know, born in the
[49:35] message. Here I am. I know the law. I
[49:38] know what because if you're if you're
[49:40] born in the message, you haven't gone to
[49:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[49:43] Everything is just legalism.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; I don't wear skirts because mom says no.
[49:49] I don't wear shorts because dad says no.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; I don't do this. I don't do that. It's
[49:54] just a bunch of dos and don'ts. So then
[49:57] you get this feeling that you're you're
[50:01] bound like, man, I'm not free. I got
[50:05] laws and things against me. I'm shackled
[50:07] by what I can and cannot do. But I want
[50:09] to do this. I Why can't I do that? Well,
[50:13] you know, mom and dad said the message
[50:15] says you can't do that. No, but I want
[50:17] You don't understand. I want to do this.
[50:20] That nature hasn't changed.
[50:23] You're still attached to that first
[50:24] husband and he's got to die. But I you
[50:27] look within yourself and you and then
[50:29] finally what happened was I went to my
[50:32] first youth camp. I was a freshman. I
[50:35] went there in that atmosphere and I said
[50:38] whatever this is I need this feeling.
[50:43] You know if you if you ever been to your
[50:44] first youth camp it's almost like time
[50:46] stands still. Nothing else exists.
[50:50] Nothing matters.
[50:52] Time just it's like wow this is heaven.
[50:57] Everybody's enjoying the Lord.
[50:59] Everybody's praising. Everybody's
[51:02] shouting. This is such a time. Why would
[51:04] I leave this place? Goodness me. And
[51:07] then the moment you get in the van to
[51:09] drive back, it's like the split decision
[51:12] from I don't want to leave this place is
[51:14] like now that feeling just disappears.
[51:18] It's like back to the world.
[51:20] And then you got to be honest with
[51:22] yourself. You might say, "Oh, but I
[51:24] really didn't want to go." But then the
[51:25] moment you left the grounds, your heart
[51:27] started to change back to what it's
[51:30] first attached to because nothing's in
[51:32] there to stop it from going back. So it
[51:34] still wants to come back. Come back this
[51:37] way because your heart hasn't changed
[51:38] yet. And I I saw within myself this
[51:41] thing happened time and time again. I
[51:44] was like, "Here I'm going. I'm enjoying
[51:47] the time. You don't understand. I'm
[51:49] amening. I'm praising the Lord. My hands
[51:51] are up. I believe I'm giving of myself
[51:54] to him.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm doing everything that I'm
[51:58] being told to do. I'm coming to an
[52:00] altar, but I'm not allowing him to come
[52:03] into my altar. So, I just stop here.
[52:06] Well, this altar does nothing for you if
[52:08] this is all as far as you go. You've got
[52:11] to go a little bit further than just
[52:13] this altar. See, it's not the prayer
[52:15] line. That's the problem. I believe in a
[52:18] prayer line. Our prophet had prayer
[52:19] lines. But what did our prophet say? He
[52:22] said, "It's God in the prayer line." You
[52:25] got to put your faith on the right
[52:27] thing. You know, you would go and you
[52:29] would see all these emotions. This
[52:32] person's screaming, this person's
[52:34] dancing, this person's shouting, and I'm
[52:36] sitting there like, I don't feel what
[52:38] they feel.
[52:40] What's happening? I want a taste of
[52:42] that. I'm wanting to feel what I'm
[52:45] seeing because I've now identified that
[52:49] the actual move of God is based off of
[52:51] an outside evidence,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; something that I could see and I could
[52:56] point to and say, "That's Christ." So
[52:59] now I'm chasing and looking after this
[53:01] evidence and this effect to be made
[53:03] manifest in my life. when in fact I was
[53:07] categorically fulfilling where brother
[53:09] Brandham said seek the giver
[53:12] &gt;&gt; not the gift
[53:14] &gt;&gt; but here I was seeking the gift
[53:16] &gt;&gt; to then say well the he is the giver of
[53:20] the gift so therefore if I have the gift
[53:23] I've got the giver no
[53:26] prophet said everybody comes to church
[53:28] there's three kinds of believers I
[53:29] believe everybody in here is a believer
[53:32] that is my stand and I'm sticking to it
[53:35] if you don't believe. So, today's the
[53:37] day you will find out you are a believer
[53:39] because there's something the word of
[53:40] God does. It's got power. You find me
[53:43] the person who said they've sinned so
[53:45] much, they've done too much that they
[53:47] can't be redeemed. And I'll find you a
[53:50] God that says that's all.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Wait, what? No, you don't understand.
[53:55] I've sinned my entire life. I denied
[53:56] you. I renounced this message. I cursed
[53:59] everybody that believed this message.
[54:01] That's all we just sang about. There's a
[54:04] fountain. There's a blood. Does that
[54:06] blood have a limit? I don't think so.
[54:09] That blood reaches as far as it needs
[54:11] to.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; It can save whoever. It doesn't matter
[54:15] how far you think you've gone. That
[54:18] blood still has reach.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. Because if it wasn't
[54:22] for that, some of us, I know if it was
[54:25] just by what we've done, there's no way
[54:29] we would find a way back to him. But I'm
[54:31] so glad before we ever committed the
[54:33] sin, he said, "I'm going to put this
[54:35] person's name on this list. I'm going to
[54:37] put this person's name on this list." He
[54:39] settled it before I could mess it up
[54:42] because according to me, I've already
[54:43] messed it up. My first birth messed it
[54:46] up. Before I could even sin, I messed it
[54:49] up because I was born in sin, shaped in
[54:52] iniquity, came into this world speaking
[54:54] lies. Well, this is rigged.
[54:57] I didn't even do nothing yet.
[55:00] Yet they say you can't baptize a baby
[55:04] because a baby knows no wrong.
[55:09] But yet as a baby I was a sinner.
[55:13] H this is interesting.
[55:17] What's the truth of the matter?
[55:20] They're both true.
[55:22] As a baby I'm a sinner. But also as a
[55:25] baby I can't I can't repent of nothing.
[55:28] I've done nothing. My conception was the
[55:31] sin. It wasn't me. I just appeared.
[55:36] Right? So, you're given a deck of cards
[55:40] that's given to lose from your first
[55:43] birth. You're attached to death. Every
[55:47] one of us, that first birth says death.
[55:50] You have to be born again.
[55:54] If you are not born again, the
[55:56] destination, no matter how righteous of
[55:58] a life you live, remains the same.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; I've given all the money you don't
[56:03] understand. I've built so many churches.
[56:06] Have you been born again?
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Except a man be born again, he shall not
[56:11] see the kingdom of God. It's not the
[56:14] works. It's not what you've done. It's
[56:17] what he's done.
[56:20] Can I stand back and say, "Lord, this is
[56:23] your plan. This is your work." You said,
[56:27] "Speak and go forward."
[56:30] &gt;&gt; What am I supposed to speak, not my own
[56:33] thoughts?
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "This bride's
[56:36] been given, thus sayeth the Lord."
[56:38] &gt;&gt; She's been given.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; It's not something she mustered up,
[56:43] something she created. She's been given
[56:46] thus sayeth the Lord. She's got the
[56:49] word.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Brother said God rigged it so much he
[56:53] put his word in her
[56:54] &gt;&gt; so she couldn't be lost.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. So now that changes things a bit
[56:59] &gt;&gt; because now I'm looking at myself as
[57:01] this I'm going I'm going through life.
[57:03] I'm going through meetings and
[57:04] everything. I'm looking at myself as
[57:06] this guy that he knows the truth. He's
[57:08] trying to do right. And I I I I really
[57:11] want to paint this picture.
[57:13] the amount of efforts you could go
[57:16] through as a human being to be right
[57:20] just to find out it was all for not.
[57:24] I did everything I thought to be right
[57:27] from listening to tapes every day,
[57:30] reading my Bible, praying. I did
[57:32] everything. But it was only for a season
[57:35] and then I went right back into the
[57:36] cycle
[57:38] &gt;&gt; because it was only as long as the
[57:40] conviction lasted. See, some of us go
[57:42] places. We travel places. We sit in
[57:45] church. We hear the word of God hit. And
[57:47] I say some of us, but I'm speaking about
[57:49] myself here. We sit in churches. We hear
[57:52] the word. It hits our heart. It sinks
[57:55] down on the inside. Yet, for some
[57:57] reason,
[57:59] it only lasts for so long.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; But you answer this for me. Either what
[58:05] you felt was real or it wasn't.
[58:11] Either
[58:12] you were in church and you felt the
[58:15] presence of God come down on the scene
[58:17] call you by name or it didn't. But if it
[58:22] did and conviction set in and said,
[58:25] "Man, I I ought to change my life. I got
[58:28] to start living for Christ. I know this
[58:29] is the truth. Brother Ben, you don't
[58:31] understand. I just don't know how to get
[58:33] my flesh to be able to live it.
[58:36] I don't know how to I I'm got to be
[58:40] honest. I still want to do wrong.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your honesty.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; I appreciate your honesty. The reason
[58:47] you still want to do wrong is because
[58:50] you have not esteem the gifts of God
[58:53] greater than the things you desire.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; When you really recognize what God has
[58:57] in store for you, what he's done for
[58:59] you, you realize there's nothing this
[59:00] world has to offer that can compare to
[59:03] that thing.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; But you don't know. So I'll give you
[59:06] grace. But oh, taste and see that the
[59:09] Lord is good. When you've tasted, see,
[59:12] it was one thing for Caleb and Joshua to
[59:14] say, "There is a land that flowth with
[59:16] milk and honey." That was one thing. But
[59:19] when that those people that doubted,
[59:21] when you finally got a taste of it,
[59:24] &gt;&gt; the reality changed.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; It was, oh, they were telling the truth,
[59:28] there is a land that flows with milk and
[59:30] honey,
[59:31] but there's giants there.
[59:35] scarecrows.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; They're they're nothing.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; He's given you the land.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; What are you scared of?
[59:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know a god that gives the land
[59:45] and then doesn't give the power to
[59:48] control the land, possess the land. No,
[59:51] he doesn't do a halfway job. He does a
[59:53] complete job.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Our problem is we want a part to play in
[59:58] it.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Let me find that small devil that I can
[1:00:02] take on my own. I don't need God for
[1:00:04] that one. Where is he at? Have you ever
[1:00:06] This is funny. Um the the Dave Matthew
[1:00:10] probably know this. Or you know, anybody
[1:00:11] that was a knucklehead as a kid probably
[1:00:13] knows this, but have you ever picked on
[1:00:16] somebody that was little and then they
[1:00:19] had somebody bigger that they wanted to
[1:00:22] show you after you picked on them?
[1:00:24] Like, man, I didn't know things could
[1:00:27] get any bigger. But yeah, I was one of
[1:00:30] those kids.
[1:00:32] Picked on somebody, the wrong person,
[1:00:34] and he had somebody bigger than I.
[1:00:37] Reality struck real fast.
[1:00:40] Don't look at the person you're trying
[1:00:41] to pick at. You don't know what's behind
[1:00:43] him. You don't know who's defending him.
[1:00:47] You don't know who's willing to die for
[1:00:49] him. So, when the devil comes at you and
[1:00:52] he picks at you because he thinks you're
[1:00:54] just this little guy, you're not going
[1:00:56] to fight back. You've got nothing to
[1:00:58] give him. and he's just going at you,
[1:01:00] attacking you, saying all the things
[1:01:01] you've done, and you just feel little
[1:01:03] and little and little and little. That's
[1:01:06] good. Praise the Lord right there.
[1:01:07] Because my prophet told me, "His
[1:01:10] strength is made perfect in my
[1:01:11] weakness." So when I feel little, I can
[1:01:13] say, "Listen, but I do serve a really
[1:01:15] big God
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; and he comes to my defense. anytime I
[1:01:20] feel attacked.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; So
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; you get Well, you know, Brother Ben,
[1:01:28] I I I I know what I felt in that meeting
[1:01:31] was real. I I I know that the atmosphere
[1:01:35] there, something in my heart, deep down
[1:01:37] inside,
[1:01:39] I want it. I really do. I really And
[1:01:43] it's so easy to feel that want when
[1:01:46] you're in the atmosphere,
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; that desire. I really wanted you have
[1:01:51] you couldn't have told me after that
[1:01:53] first camp during that camp that I'd go
[1:01:55] back and be the same person. I always
[1:01:57] said you're crazy.
[1:01:59] I was after what I just tasted. You're
[1:02:00] sick.
[1:02:02] I'm going to live what I just felt here
[1:02:05] for the rest of my life. That would have
[1:02:07] been my attitude because I believed it
[1:02:10] that much in the atmosphere.
[1:02:13] But it does no good for the atmosphere
[1:02:15] to be location-wise where it only stays
[1:02:17] in one location that I feel that
[1:02:19] atmosphere. No, I should feel that
[1:02:22] atmosphere everywhere that I'm at. At
[1:02:24] home, at work, at school, that
[1:02:26] atmosphere is a reality. It's not bound
[1:02:30] by a zip code.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; It's not bound by your favorite
[1:02:33] minister.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; It's bound by the word. Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Every time the word is spoken, there's a
[1:02:43] seed on the inside of the believer that
[1:02:46] says, "I want this.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; This is life to me.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; This is food for the journey."
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; But you get in this atmosphere.
[1:02:56] You start, man, I I really I I really
[1:02:59] thought I gave myself. You come back,
[1:03:02] you learn. You got to be anchored in the
[1:03:04] word. Nothing moves the word. Stay with
[1:03:08] the word. rest. Faith find a resting
[1:03:11] place is in the word. Stay with the
[1:03:13] word. See, if you're not careful, the
[1:03:15] devil will take because I I want to be
[1:03:17] careful. What I'm not telling you is
[1:03:19] what you felt wasn't real.
[1:03:22] No, it was real. You just didn't know
[1:03:25] how to make it permanent.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; But it was real. The atmosphere you
[1:03:29] felt, the joy you felt, the excitement
[1:03:31] you felt, that was real. Because when
[1:03:34] God, you have to understand what it
[1:03:35] means to be lost, bound in sin with no
[1:03:38] freedom, and then God shows you a taste
[1:03:40] of what freedom looks like.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; You ain't going back.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; But I had to get an experience.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; But I'm I'm not speaking of an because
[1:03:50] when we say experience, automatically in
[1:03:52] our minds, we come up with an image of
[1:03:55] what experience looks like, a picture of
[1:03:58] what experience looks like.
[1:04:01] I want to read this quote for you if I
[1:04:03] could find it.
[1:04:08] Brother Brandham says in
[1:04:11] Melzdc the great prince and king, what a
[1:04:14] marvelous promise, two immutable things.
[1:04:17] God cannot lie and be God. Now if God
[1:04:21] paragraph 74 Now if God has made a
[1:04:23] promise in his Bible here, we believe
[1:04:25] the Bible to be the infalluable word of
[1:04:28] God. And if God has made a promise in
[1:04:31] the Bible, we have this consolation and
[1:04:34] know that it's impossible for God to
[1:04:37] lie. Therefore, when we see he promised
[1:04:41] it in the Bible, we believe it soul,
[1:04:44] body, and spirit. It is impossible for
[1:04:47] him to lie. Now, if there's any fault,
[1:04:50] this is very key. It's on us,
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; not in God. God is obligated to his
[1:04:59] word.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; You know in this hour you are his word.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; He's obligated to you.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; For he has sworn by his word. Wait, he
[1:05:11] sworn on me? Yes. Because you are in
[1:05:14] him. You and him are one.
[1:05:17] My I'm sure when we get to seeing it in
[1:05:20] that way, in that light, things begin to
[1:05:22] shape up and heap up different than what
[1:05:25] they used to be. Healing of the body
[1:05:28] doesn't become fiction. It becomes a
[1:05:30] reality. The baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:33] doesn't come doesn't become an emotional
[1:05:35] worked substance. It becomes a reality
[1:05:38] of the inddwelling presence of the Lord
[1:05:41] Jesus Christ
[1:05:43] to change the life.
[1:05:46] That's the key.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; The life has to change
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; when you've got the person of Jesus
[1:05:53] Christ on the inside. See, I looked
[1:05:54] within myself and I figured out what it
[1:05:56] was here. Before I had the experience
[1:06:00] where I knew the indwelling spirit was
[1:06:02] in me. I was trying to obey the word
[1:06:05] because I didn't want to go to hell.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; That's a slippery slope because then you
[1:06:13] start weighing things on gravity.
[1:06:16] Why would God send me to hell for a
[1:06:17] little white lie?
[1:06:20] Why would God send me to hell? I had a
[1:06:22] cookie.
[1:06:24] I wasn't supposed to. Why would he send
[1:06:25] me to hell for that? You start weighing
[1:06:28] sins now because you just don't want to
[1:06:30] go to hell. You think the grave stuff
[1:06:31] will send you to hell. But brother Bam
[1:06:34] said God had a right to slay you for the
[1:06:36] littlest lie. But thank God for his
[1:06:39] mercies
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; and his grace that he could look beyond
[1:06:43] our faults and see the need that we had.
[1:06:46] We needed him
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; and it struck me to change the life. I
[1:06:53] said okay
[1:06:55] when that experience happened what I
[1:06:57] began to see was now my desires was no
[1:07:00] longer how do I live for Christ so I
[1:07:01] could that I could avoid hell but now
[1:07:03] it's I want to live for Christ because I
[1:07:05] love him.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; I don't I I don't want to hurt him. It
[1:07:10] It killed me when I made a mistake. It
[1:07:13] It hurt me. Beforehand, it was just, oh
[1:07:15] well, got to start again. But now some
[1:07:20] something was crying, make it right.
[1:07:22] Make it right. Make it right. But in
[1:07:24] order for that voice to cry, make it
[1:07:26] right, I had to be right.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; But without the indwelling spirit, it's
[1:07:31] just man trying to make man better.
[1:07:36] That's a that's a failing formula. It'll
[1:07:39] never work. And if if we're not careful
[1:07:42] what we start doing after we know we've
[1:07:44] had experience with Christ, we know we
[1:07:46] have the inddwelling spirit in us. The
[1:07:49] Bible also describes him as an
[1:07:50] indwelling intercessor.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; So, he intercesses for you, for me.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; He stands in the gap for you and me.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, we get on our
[1:08:00] high horse where I know I've got the
[1:08:02] spirit on the inside. And we start, we
[1:08:04] have a measuring stick. Well, I saw you
[1:08:07] sin. Well, you ain't got it. Well, I saw
[1:08:09] you sin. Well, you ain't got it. I Well,
[1:08:11] you ain't got it. We just start
[1:08:12] measuring everybody based off of our
[1:08:14] standard. I just want to know whose
[1:08:16] standard is it? Is it God or yours?
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; What would you have told Abraham
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; if you were there with Abraham and you
[1:08:24] seen him lie about Sarah?
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; And then he tells the king, "Go to my
[1:08:30] servant and have him pray for you." You
[1:08:33] would have said, "Why would you serve
[1:08:35] it?" He just lied.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; We got to Brother Bam says, "If you want
[1:08:41] to know what kind of person you would
[1:08:42] have been when Jesus was here, look at
[1:08:45] the kind of person you are now."
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; It doesn't change. We have this fantasy
[1:08:49] in our mind that I'll be a better
[1:08:50] Christian if Jesus was here and he was
[1:08:52] present. No, you'd be the same person
[1:08:54] you are.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Only difference is you knew he knew what
[1:08:57] you were doing
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; because you could see him. You knew he
[1:09:00] knows. He knows. But if you really enter
[1:09:03] into his reality, even when you don't
[1:09:06] see him, you know he knows. He's always
[1:09:08] there. He's always present.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; We have this it's almost like a crutch
[1:09:16] that man, if Jesus was I've spoken to so
[1:09:19] many atheists and different kinds of
[1:09:21] people and you you tell them about the
[1:09:22] word, you tell them about God, then they
[1:09:24] say, "Well, you know how I believe it?
[1:09:27] If Jesus comes down right now and tells
[1:09:30] me what you said is true, I'll believe
[1:09:32] it.
[1:09:34] Well, let's get out of the way for a
[1:09:37] moment.
[1:09:38] If Brother Brandham was here and
[1:09:41] somebody spoke in that manner, I would
[1:09:44] imagine he'd probably say something like
[1:09:45] this. A greater than Solomon is here.
[1:09:49] A greater than all of them is here. They
[1:09:51] would just see a man,
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; but they wouldn't know what he was
[1:09:54] talking about. He turned his back. He
[1:09:58] described who you were, where you came
[1:10:00] from. All you would see is a man. But if
[1:10:03] you go go beyond the veil, God shows up
[1:10:06] today in you. In you, in you. You are
[1:10:10] Christ on earth.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Your feet are his feet. Your hands are
[1:10:13] his hands. So when they say, "If Christ
[1:10:15] was here before me, who do you think
[1:10:17] they're standing in front of? She is
[1:10:19] him. You are one with him. It's not a
[1:10:22] separate being." No, you are one.
[1:10:25] That's what we've come to in this hour.
[1:10:27] A complete oneness.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; So when they stand before you and make
[1:10:32] statements like that, you ought to be
[1:10:34] careful to not say something to cause
[1:10:36] them to blaspheme against the Lord.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Have mercy upon them.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, you know, I I'm sorry, but
[1:10:44] just walk away." Not every circumstance
[1:10:47] you have to engage.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Not every circumstance you got to
[1:10:49] debate. Not every circumstance you'll do
[1:10:51] more hurt for that person than you will
[1:10:53] do good.
[1:10:55] God didn't call you to judge. He called
[1:10:57] you to be the life.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; He lived the life and walked the life.
[1:11:02] And Pilate said, "This is a man that's
[1:11:04] done no wrong.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; What would you have me do with him?"
[1:11:08] They spoke what they wanted for him. He
[1:11:12] didn't say nothing.
[1:11:14] He was the King of Kings, Lord of Lords.
[1:11:17] here on earth.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; The very people reading the scriptures,
[1:11:20] reading the the scrolls, had no idea who
[1:11:23] was standing before them.
[1:11:25] And in this hour, we had one who came
[1:11:27] into that manifestation.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; The first fruit
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; and he stood and they didn't know who
[1:11:32] was before him.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Think it not strange they don't know
[1:11:35] who's before them when you stand there.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; The theme has to continue.
[1:11:43] I I I got you know I just w walking
[1:11:46] within myself and I said man you know
[1:11:48] what what happens is because you don't
[1:11:50] know how to identify the indwelling
[1:11:52] spirit in your life
[1:11:56] ministers I I include myself in this we
[1:11:59] do a disservice because we'll beat down
[1:12:02] on something and then you've got the
[1:12:05] inddwelling spirit and you start
[1:12:08] questioning because your flesh is being
[1:12:10] reminded of its faults. So you then
[1:12:13] start doubting what he done for you.
[1:12:16] But he's already saved you.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; He's not trying to hurt you.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; He's trying to iron things out. He's
[1:12:24] trying to perfect you. He's not trying
[1:12:26] to diminish you, make you feel like
[1:12:28] you're lacking in something. No, he
[1:12:30] doesn't seal you today and unseal you
[1:12:32] tomorrow. You're sealed. If that was the
[1:12:35] case, why would the scripture say,
[1:12:37] "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[1:12:40] whereby you are sealed till the day of
[1:12:42] your redemption." That means if anybody
[1:12:44] gives you an image that I have the Holy
[1:12:48] Ghost on the inside and I'm faultless,
[1:12:52] you have to really be careful because in
[1:12:54] one sense it's true, on the other sense
[1:12:55] it's not.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; You're faultless because Christ is in
[1:12:58] you, therefore you're perfect. But if
[1:13:00] you're attributing your righteousness of
[1:13:01] what you can do, of what you've done,
[1:13:04] well, now you're standing on the wrong
[1:13:05] side of the story.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Because then what you're showing to the
[1:13:08] people is that you can obtain a
[1:13:11] perfection in your flesh. My flesh won't
[1:13:13] tempt me. My flesh won't bother me. That
[1:13:16] old nature won't come up. No, it comes
[1:13:18] up. And you see it in the life of our
[1:13:20] prophet that devil always tried to come
[1:13:22] up. I I think I I think I saw this
[1:13:25] somewhere and and if it's wrong, forgive
[1:13:27] me, but I believe it said brother
[1:13:28] Brandham tried to commit suicide over
[1:13:30] five times.
[1:13:32] This is our prophet.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; What pressure,
[1:13:38] what feeling must he have been under?
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; What could it have been?
[1:13:44] He describes, I believe, I believe it's
[1:13:46] in the same sermon, expectations, he he
[1:13:48] describes a story of what it feels like
[1:13:50] to be under that inspiration. Somebody
[1:13:52] came to him and questioned him and said,
[1:13:53] "Well, Brother Brandham, why do you only
[1:13:55] pray for one person and all these other
[1:13:57] people pray for multiple people?" He
[1:13:59] said, "You don't know what it's like to
[1:14:00] be under that atmosphere."
[1:14:02] He said, "Man, there's nothing that
[1:14:04] whoops me more than a vision."
[1:14:07] He said, "Daniel had one vision and was
[1:14:08] tormented for a long time." Then brother
[1:14:11] Ram starts describing about this old
[1:14:13] singers that wrote these songs that were
[1:14:15] so inspired. And he said when they came
[1:14:17] down from that inspiration, one by the
[1:14:20] other committed suicide.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; The man who wrote there is a fountain
[1:14:24] filled with blood.
[1:14:26] That same person
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; after coming down that inspiration
[1:14:30] wanted to go to the bridge and jump off.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; He couldn't contain
[1:14:35] that knowing. Listen,
[1:14:38] if you only knew what it meant for your
[1:14:40] sin to be forgiven,
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; how much of a cost it was for him,
[1:14:46] beaten, bruised, he did nothing wrong,
[1:14:50] but he had me in mind. He had you in
[1:14:54] mind. He didn't want to lose you. He
[1:14:57] couldn't lose you. And he took that for
[1:14:59] us.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says coming down from
[1:15:02] that, he it it messed him up for a
[1:15:05] while.
[1:15:10] You're still human.
[1:15:12] You're still a man.
[1:15:16] Only thing that changes,
[1:15:20] there's a voice on the inside,
[1:15:22] starts to speak at you. Hey, we got a
[1:15:26] greater work we got to do. We got
[1:15:28] something we got to do. You can't sit
[1:15:29] around and wallow in the fault you made
[1:15:31] yesterday. Make it right. Let's
[1:15:32] continue. I got things to do. it it it's
[1:15:35] not going to sit there and baby you.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Somebody has got to manifest the word.
[1:15:41] Somebody has got to walk in all the
[1:15:43] blessings of the word. Somebody has to
[1:15:45] save the souls. Somebody has to lay
[1:15:48] hands on the sick so they shall recover.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; But you can't just sit at home.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Wallowing in your sin.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Wallowing in your disappointment of
[1:15:57] yourself. How could I have done that? I
[1:15:58] knew better. How could I have done that?
[1:16:01] You don't think our prophet knew better
[1:16:02] when he told me to tell them I'm not
[1:16:04] here?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; You don't think he knew better?
[1:16:08] He did. But you know what he did? He
[1:16:11] went right. He had to go pray for
[1:16:12] somebody. And because he had that
[1:16:14] inddwelling spirit on the inside, it
[1:16:16] said, "Hypocrite.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Go and make it right."
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; He had to go back.
[1:16:24] I'm sorry. What humility,
[1:16:27] humbleness to lower yourself that much.
[1:16:29] He didn't have to make that right. But
[1:16:32] that inddwelling spirit that only spews
[1:16:34] the things of God said, "Go make that
[1:16:37] right."
[1:16:38] He went, made it right, came back, and
[1:16:41] he prayed.
[1:16:43] Walk the life.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; We have to stop questioning what he's
[1:16:47] done for us.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; It's a perfect work.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; He's finished it.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; We need to now be walking in what he
[1:16:54] said this bride must be walking in. But
[1:16:57] we can't do that if we're constantly
[1:16:59] questioning what he's done for us.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; You will never get an answer satisfying
[1:17:05] enough to the flesh
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; that God saved you
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; because the flesh always remembers where
[1:17:12] you were
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; the first time you committed the sin
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; the last time you committed the sin. It
[1:17:17] will always remind you. It follows you.
[1:17:21] But I got something on the inside that's
[1:17:24] crying for the real me somewhere above.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; It's not the things you did that were
[1:17:29] here that make you who you are. Your
[1:17:31] true existence is who you were in the
[1:17:33] beginning. What he said of you in the
[1:17:35] beginning when he had a thought of you
[1:17:36] in the beginning, that's who you were.
[1:17:39] You just stopped here for a moment. This
[1:17:41] is nothing but a a layover. I'm just
[1:17:45] stopping for a moment. I can't get
[1:17:46] accustomed here.
[1:17:48] I'm I can't get too comfortable here. I
[1:17:51] might get irritated at the flight
[1:17:52] attendant. I might get irritated at the
[1:17:54] person at the desk. I might not like the
[1:17:55] person sitting next to me. But I'm only
[1:17:57] here for a moment.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Then I got to take that other flight.
[1:18:01] And this flight takes me somewhere where
[1:18:03] there's no sin, no sorrow, no pain, no
[1:18:06] death. So I I I can't make my Really
[1:18:10] think about it. You're being told you're
[1:18:12] going on the greatest vacation ever.
[1:18:14] Your destination, where you're headed,
[1:18:16] anything you desire appears. Amen.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; You could not imagine the beauty of it
[1:18:22] all.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; You like oceans, your destination will
[1:18:25] have oceans.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; You like mountains, your destination
[1:18:28] will have mountains. You like this, you
[1:18:30] like that. Whatever you like is being
[1:18:33] given to you.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; It's the perfect condition. Nobody's
[1:18:37] calling you to bail him out.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Nobody's calling you to help him out.
[1:18:40] Nobody's calling you to pray for him
[1:18:42] because it's a perfect condition.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; This is what's in the balance here.
[1:18:46] either we're striving and walking
[1:18:48] towards that
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; because we got to get the practice
[1:18:51] somewhere
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; because my my prophet told me that I I
[1:18:54] have authority now not just then but I
[1:18:57] have authority now
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; so if I speak the word of God he said my
[1:19:02] lips speaking it is deity speaking
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; I can't do that and at the same time
[1:19:11] I got to save myself again
[1:19:15] Man, I've been doing so good. I I seen
[1:19:17] God in my life. I brought Man, I was I
[1:19:20] was ministering to this person. I just
[1:19:21] felt my soul enter in with him and we're
[1:19:23] having such good fellowship and man,
[1:19:25] such a good time. But then that driver
[1:19:27] cut me off,
[1:19:30] man. And I said the wrong thing. And now
[1:19:32] I feel like I got to
[1:19:35] woe is me. How could I have sinned? And
[1:19:39] you stay there for a while rather than
[1:19:41] just making it right and move on. You
[1:19:42] stay there for a while. It takes you a
[1:19:44] week there, then finally you move out of
[1:19:46] it, then you're back again. Then, oh,
[1:19:48] you make a mistake. Oh, I got to wallow
[1:19:50] in this again. That's not the life we
[1:19:52] were supposed to live. As things come to
[1:19:55] you, you get the victory. Walk, talk,
[1:19:59] act, be who he made you to be. And if
[1:20:03] you happen to fall, get up,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; dust yourself off, and keep pressing on.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; But this is what's in the balance.
[1:20:11] and you make this flight. You got a
[1:20:13] layover for an hour
[1:20:16] and then you get distracted.
[1:20:19] Let me let me make it better. You have a
[1:20:20] layover for 30 seconds. Not an hour. An
[1:20:23] hour is too long. You have a layover for
[1:20:25] 30 seconds. It's getting off. Going
[1:20:28] right back to another plane. Rather than
[1:20:30] that, you you know where you're headed
[1:20:32] has anything your heart desires. If you
[1:20:35] were hungry, oh my god. just to draw an
[1:20:38] example.
[1:20:40] But you stop and you say, "Oo,
[1:20:42] McDonald's.
[1:20:44] Water burger. Wow, Shake Shack. What's
[1:20:49] that got to do with a nice 16 Wagu
[1:20:52] ribeye?
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want that. I got the real thing.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; You give me a bunch of mixed hybrid
[1:20:59] stuff all together, put in a patty so I
[1:21:01] can eat it when I can get the real
[1:21:02] thing." But that's what we do. We don't
[1:21:05] value or esteem the things of God better
[1:21:09] than the things of this world. And
[1:21:11] that's the problem because we don't
[1:21:14] know. But unless you get in the word,
[1:21:16] you got when you hear and see, I kid you
[1:21:19] not, I was brother Adrian and we were
[1:21:22] talking about uh a future home. I told
[1:21:25] him, I said, "Man, you I could explain
[1:21:27] it to you. I could tell it to you, but
[1:21:29] you got to just rate it and and just
[1:21:31] listen to what God says about that
[1:21:33] home." And I came back here the next
[1:21:35] day. He's like, "Oh, brother brother
[1:21:37] Brand was, "Oh, I can't wait. How could
[1:21:38] we miss any?" And it's if you don't
[1:21:42] know, you don't you don't see the value
[1:21:44] in it.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; But you had you have to be in the word,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; but even after reading it and and
[1:21:52] thinking you understand it, the Bible
[1:21:54] still says, "Eyes have not seen,
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; ears have not heard
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; all that God has in store for them." So,
[1:22:04] you're only getting a mental taste in
[1:22:06] your mind that's limited, but you can't
[1:22:09] comprehend what's weighing in the
[1:22:12] balance.
[1:22:14] Eternal life,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; temporary life. You got to wake up early
[1:22:20] in the morning. You got to go to work.
[1:22:22] All the money you make goes to bills.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; If you have children, it goes to bills
[1:22:26] and children. If you have a wife, it
[1:22:29] goes to wife, children, bills.
[1:22:34] All the efforts you make here, doesn't
[1:22:36] matter how much money you make,
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; you'll want to spend it
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; over there. I got no need of money.
[1:22:44] I'm sitting
[1:22:47] with him.
[1:22:49] I look out, I see the streets of gold. I
[1:22:53] see brother Billy out there strolling.
[1:22:57] I see David crawling on all fours
[1:23:00] just for the fun of it. Oh, what a time.
[1:23:04] Time is no more. This This is what's
[1:23:08] awaiting us. I could I can't even
[1:23:10] describe it to you. All the
[1:23:14] everything God has in store for you, the
[1:23:16] little that I know, I could not describe
[1:23:20] it to you. But I promise you, its weight
[1:23:25] should far outweigh your temporary
[1:23:27] pleasure to do what you want to do.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; In fact, I'll just I'll just uh I want
[1:23:35] to say ruin, but I'll give you the
[1:23:37] reality of the statement, do what you
[1:23:39] want to do.
[1:23:41] Brother says there's only two spirits in
[1:23:43] this world.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; That of God and that of Satan. There is
[1:23:48] no middle ground.
[1:23:50] Oh, I don't worship Satan. I don't want
[1:23:52] to believe, you know, Lord either. I
[1:23:55] just want to do what I want to do. Like,
[1:23:56] you know what? I know God exists. I know
[1:23:58] the message is real, but I just want to
[1:24:00] do me right now. I want to do what I
[1:24:03] want to do. Please me, satisfy myself,
[1:24:07] but I'm not I don't believe devil,
[1:24:10] but I also don't want to like all the
[1:24:12] way believe God,
[1:24:14] but I promise I'm not a sinner.
[1:24:17] I I hope I make it to heaven. I don't
[1:24:20] want a hope. I want a certainty.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And that seal of God, that indwelling
[1:24:27] spirit settles it.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; You can't mess it up.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; And and and here we are. This middle
[1:24:33] ground, I want to do what I want to do.
[1:24:34] No. In fact, what you want to do is what
[1:24:35] the devil wants you to do.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; He wants you to think it's your idea.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; I came up with this. Hey, you you know,
[1:24:43] brother Billy, nobody knew. I didn't
[1:24:46] have to please the devil. I didn't have
[1:24:47] to please God. I can just do what I want
[1:24:48] to do. No,
[1:24:51] it's one or the other.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; There's no gray dog. It's black and the
[1:24:55] white dog. Whichever you feed is the one
[1:24:57] that wins
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; if you have the call. Thank God for a
[1:25:01] prophet.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; So, I forgot to to hit my timer. Um,
[1:25:10] let's just pretend I had hit it.
[1:25:13] I just started it. I'm kidding. But I'm
[1:25:15] I'm I'm there's so much here. I'm I'm
[1:25:18] I'm working to to close in. But
[1:25:22] who put in your mind who lied to you
[1:25:26] that you had a thought coming?
[1:25:29] There's only And Chad GPT responded as
[1:25:32] if it was the devil. He said, "If you
[1:25:34] were Satan, how would you get me to
[1:25:36] serve and worship you?" And the answer
[1:25:39] Chad GPT gave, oh my goodness, to this
[1:25:42] day,
[1:25:44] I'm like, what? You would have thought
[1:25:46] you were talking to the devil himself.
[1:25:49] He said, why would I flat out tell you
[1:25:52] that you're serving me? That's
[1:25:54] pointless. Instead, I would get you to
[1:25:57] think that your ambitions, your goals,
[1:26:01] God's not for. Why would God not want
[1:26:04] you to do what he want what you want to
[1:26:05] do? That doesn't make sense. And if I
[1:26:08] could get you to question your ambitions
[1:26:11] versus what God wants
[1:26:14] at that point, you'd be serving me and
[1:26:15] you wouldn't know it.
[1:26:18] This is what the answer it gave. Is that
[1:26:20] not the biblical attitude the devil has?
[1:26:24] He doesn't come to you with horns. He
[1:26:26] comes to you with your dreams,
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; with your goals, with your ambitions,
[1:26:31] but right behind it there's a knife or
[1:26:34] there's a gun behind it. You think
[1:26:36] you're going to take this and just, oh,
[1:26:38] this is everything that I wanted. I
[1:26:40] wanted cake. The moment you bite into
[1:26:42] it,
[1:26:44] he's got you. He He only gives you if
[1:26:47] he's a good devil, because he's got
[1:26:49] 2,000 years of experience. That's a
[1:26:51] funny statement, good devil. But 2,000
[1:26:54] years of experience, if he's a really
[1:26:56] good, stout, devout devil,
[1:27:00] he would only give you what you want.
[1:27:04] If he was a bad devil, he'd give you
[1:27:07] what you don't want. Well, that's easy.
[1:27:10] I don't want that.
[1:27:12] Funny story. Brother Burley said
[1:27:14] something told a joke one time. He said,
[1:27:16] "Well, I had this I had this young man
[1:27:17] come up to me and say, "Brother Burley,
[1:27:19] I've been delivered from the spirit of
[1:27:20] lust. I've been delivered." Brother
[1:27:22] Brley says, "You haven't you've been
[1:27:23] delivered?" He goes, "Yeah, I've been
[1:27:25] delivered." He said, "Let me ask you a
[1:27:27] question." He said, "What?" He said,
[1:27:29] "Was she ugly?" He said, "Yeah." He
[1:27:31] said, "You ain't been delivered.
[1:27:35] Why would the devil tempt you with
[1:27:37] something that isn't a temptation?
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; It's got to be pleasing to your eyes, to
[1:27:43] the natural senses. You laugh cuz it's
[1:27:46] funny. But in reality, we do this all
[1:27:49] the time.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; We think we've overcome something when
[1:27:52] it's something that didn't really bother
[1:27:54] us to begin with.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; But the thing that we like to do, we
[1:27:57] like to indulge in that we don't want no
[1:28:00] one to know the sin that's hidden. It's
[1:28:02] like, well, don't touch my pet sin.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Touch everything else, but not my pet
[1:28:07] sin. I love a good reality show.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; I love a good movie.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; I love a good show. I love a good laugh.
[1:28:17] Let me watch a comedic movie.
[1:28:20] There's nothing wrong with an action
[1:28:21] movie.
[1:28:23] There's nothing wrong with this. Oh, you
[1:28:26] you you may go for a while. You may go
[1:28:28] for a while, but sooner or later you'll
[1:28:30] find yourself right back. Oh, how did I
[1:28:33] get here again?
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; The formula is wrong.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, but brother, you know, I I
[1:28:40] had an experience with God. I know I did
[1:28:43] because I I I feel the conviction every
[1:28:45] time I do something wrong. I feel the
[1:28:48] conviction in my heart. Why do I keep
[1:28:50] going this way?"
[1:28:53] Simply put, if you feel a conviction
[1:28:56] that it's wrong, do something different.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; You can't keep doing the same thing and
[1:29:03] expect something to change. I believe I
[1:29:06] heard brother Brandham say in the
[1:29:07] sermon, I think the harvest, he said,
[1:29:09] "Be careful with the habits you build
[1:29:11] because when something's happened,
[1:29:12] you'll begin to reach for the wrong
[1:29:14] thing
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; because you this is so habitual to you.
[1:29:18] You've always when you're sad and
[1:29:19] depressed just I I just had to watch
[1:29:22] something funny to cheer me up. This is
[1:29:23] what I always do. The devil lied to
[1:29:26] children of God and told them that if
[1:29:28] you were bored, the word wouldn't be
[1:29:30] good enough. He told them that if you
[1:29:31] needed excitement, the word wouldn't be
[1:29:33] good enough. That if you needed joy, the
[1:29:35] word wouldn't be good enough. That if
[1:29:36] you needed fellowship, the word wouldn't
[1:29:37] be good enough. Well, here's the
[1:29:39] reality. The word is good for all
[1:29:41] things. If you want to have a good time,
[1:29:43] find you that one brother that you can
[1:29:45] fellowship about with the word and you
[1:29:46] can dig in and you're just enjoying the
[1:29:48] things of God. You know what? God's
[1:29:50] doing this in my life. He's showing me
[1:29:52] this. This brother says, "Man, you don't
[1:29:53] know what God's been showing me?" It's
[1:29:55] like, "Oh my goodness, I just want to
[1:29:56] explode.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; This is awesome.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; The things of God, awesome,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; great. They're fun. They're exciting.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Get lost in the word." See, the reason
[1:30:08] you can't get lost in the word because
[1:30:10] you're still doing it legalistically. I
[1:30:12] have to fulfill this duty of listening.
[1:30:14] I have to read my B my Bible to to fill
[1:30:16] this duty. It's got nothing to do with
[1:30:19] the duty of it.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; It's your job to feed on the word, to
[1:30:23] remain in the word. That's what you're
[1:30:25] called to do.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; But the joy from the word
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; that comes from within and comes out.
[1:30:32] Something's had to have changed on the
[1:30:34] inside that nothing else quenches you.
[1:30:37] Nothing else satisfies you like the
[1:30:39] word. No substitute will ever do it for
[1:30:42] you. It's got to be the word.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; But says, "It seems as if we're no
[1:30:50] longer significantly impressed
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; by the word."
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I felt so little because I know what
[1:30:57] it's like, man. I listen to tape today.
[1:31:00] I've read my Bible. I've prayed.
[1:31:04] Now I want something fun to do.
[1:31:08] And you start looking at the things you
[1:31:10] used to do for fun.
[1:31:13] You say, "Oh, well, you know, it's not
[1:31:15] that bad. I was just watching a ball
[1:31:16] game. Nothing crazy." And then an ad
[1:31:19] came up and then you saw the ad and then
[1:31:23] your mind raced somewhere
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; and now you're Oh Lord, how could I have
[1:31:28] father man?
[1:31:30] We still got a taste for the things of
[1:31:32] the world. We The indwelling spirit is
[1:31:35] there to pull that out of us.
[1:31:40] I I don't want to be much I got a lot a
[1:31:42] a lot more, but
[1:31:46] I'll read a couple quotes and I'll
[1:31:47] close.
[1:31:49] Brother Brandon makes this statement.
[1:32:02] Uh in Melkazedc the great prince and
[1:32:04] king paragraph 38.
[1:32:07] And God swore by an oath and anyone
[1:32:09] swearing by an oath swears by someone
[1:32:11] greater than they are. So God had no one
[1:32:14] greater than him himself to swear by. So
[1:32:18] he swore by himself that he would keep
[1:32:20] his covenant with Abraham. Then how firm
[1:32:23] a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, if
[1:32:25] we'll approach this subject today real
[1:32:28] sensibly, calmly. Never be excited.
[1:32:31] Faith never gets excited. Faith never
[1:32:35] rushes itself. Now I don't want you to
[1:32:38] take this where you don't have to take
[1:32:40] it. Faith never gets excited. He didn't
[1:32:43] talk about you as a person. Faith, the
[1:32:47] gift of God is assurance.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; It doesn't need an emotion.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. It's the amen. It's the
[1:32:55] this is it. It doesn't get excited.
[1:32:58] Faith never rushes itself. Faith knows
[1:33:01] what it's talking about.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; You never seen our master excited about
[1:33:06] anything. Standing by the grave of a
[1:33:08] dead man. He was just as calm as he was
[1:33:11] when he sit on the mount and looked over
[1:33:14] Jerusalem. standing on a trouble on a
[1:33:16] ship in the troubled seas and the waves
[1:33:19] tossed about. He was so completely
[1:33:22] rested in God until it never even paid
[1:33:26] any attention to it enough to wake up.
[1:33:30] Always undisturbed.
[1:33:32] Faith is
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; see when you're disturbed,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; get a little faith. It'll get you
[1:33:40] undisturbed. Then you recognize who's in
[1:33:42] control.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; It ain't me. This isn't my show, it's
[1:33:45] his.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; He says
[1:33:49] paragraph 47 man was a comedian. He
[1:33:52] said, "Could you imagine Jesus saying,
[1:33:53] "Now, let me check my faith and see if
[1:33:55] I've got enough faith to do this."
[1:33:58] See, if I'll have if I'll have to fast a
[1:34:01] while to see if I'll have enough faith
[1:34:03] to do this, he was perfectly unconscious
[1:34:07] of the faith that he had.
[1:34:10] He just spoke it and knew it would be
[1:34:13] so.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Now, these words got to leave the pages,
[1:34:16] leave the screens, and it's got to
[1:34:18] become a reality in you because you've
[1:34:21] been given the same ability to speak and
[1:34:25] it be according to your word, your
[1:34:28] confession, just like you are come from
[1:34:30] home today. You probably want to return
[1:34:32] to your homes, told your wife or your
[1:34:34] loved ones, I'll be back sometime right
[1:34:36] afternoon. How do you know you are? You
[1:34:39] don't try to wonder, "Have I got faith
[1:34:42] enough to go home? Have I got faith
[1:34:44] enough to drive my car?" You just
[1:34:46] unconsciously turn your key on, drive on
[1:34:50] away, and go home. See, it's the
[1:34:52] unconscious faith that does it.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; See, you don't have to reason when
[1:34:56] you're going home. You don't have to
[1:34:58] reason if you're going to come back. But
[1:35:00] if we can just get the reasoning out of
[1:35:02] all the other decisions, we would have
[1:35:04] unconscious faith in all realms. That's
[1:35:07] my heart's desire to get Ben's reasoning
[1:35:09] out the way so that God could have full
[1:35:12] reign in control that whatever I speak I
[1:35:15] don't question because I know it's a
[1:35:17] finished work because he said so. So it
[1:35:19] didn't I don't want to because then you
[1:35:22] go somewhere else. We'll just continue
[1:35:24] here. Now God could have paragraph 56.
[1:35:27] Now God could have placed and oh Lord
[1:35:30] forgive me. This is me. Now God could
[1:35:33] have placed little Samuel right in
[1:35:34] Hannah's arms. All of us knows that he
[1:35:36] is a creator of all things. Just speaks
[1:35:39] it into exist existence. He could have
[1:35:41] put it right in Hannah's arms. But
[1:35:43] instead of doing that, it was the
[1:35:46] regular procedure of nine months.
[1:35:50] Before the little baby come along, he
[1:35:52] could have done it instantly,
[1:35:54] but he didn't do it instantly. Some of
[1:35:57] us want I got dwelling spirit. I'll
[1:36:00] never sin again.
[1:36:04] This is our attitude. I had this
[1:36:07] attitude.
[1:36:09] And because I had that attitude, every
[1:36:10] time you make a mistake, you remove what
[1:36:13] God's done for you in your life and you
[1:36:15] try to go seek it again.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; He says
[1:36:23] he could have done it instantly, but he
[1:36:24] didn't do it instantly. He just give her
[1:36:27] the promise and she inherited the
[1:36:30] promise. When God told Moses when he
[1:36:33] started out to go into the promised
[1:36:34] land, all that promise, he said, "I give
[1:36:36] Abraham years ago, it's all walled up
[1:36:39] with Philistines and all kinds of great
[1:36:41] people over there, warriors." He said,
[1:36:43] "Now it's all yours." There was the
[1:36:46] Amorites, the Hivites, and the
[1:36:47] Perizzites and all those over there, the
[1:36:49] Hivites, the Jebunites, the Philistines,
[1:36:51] everything in Palestine. Now God said,
[1:36:54] "I have given it to you. It's yours. Now
[1:36:57] go and possess it." Oh, I hope you see
[1:37:00] it, people. It's something that I want
[1:37:02] to get to you to put your faith where it
[1:37:06] belongs. Many people as I find they've
[1:37:09] got faith if they only know how to put
[1:37:12] it to work.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Father help us. And he he's speaking
[1:37:18] about Benjamin Franklin here. When he
[1:37:19] found electricity, he said, "I got it."
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; But he didn't know what he had.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; And come Thomas Edison, he said, "I'll
[1:37:26] work for us. It'll work for us."
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; And he didn't care how long it took. He
[1:37:30] tried 10,000 wires, but yet he found a
[1:37:34] wire that would finally carry the
[1:37:36] electronic or the electricity into the
[1:37:38] wire. He knowed it was the power and
[1:37:41] that power would work in our benefit.
[1:37:43] Oh, what that did to me? Because then
[1:37:46] you realize there was a word that had to
[1:37:48] be spoken that only an elected bunch
[1:37:50] would be able to manifest. Only an
[1:37:53] elected bunch would be able to transmit
[1:37:55] that electricity straight from the
[1:37:57] source. It was you and I. Yes, sir.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; He throughout the churches as you see it
[1:38:02] was dark and all. And in this time,
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; he said this bride, this wire, she can
[1:38:09] hold that electricity.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; And now we found salvation that will
[1:38:14] save us from sin. That will make the
[1:38:16] vilest woman or man, drunker,
[1:38:18] prostitute, and make them a child of
[1:38:20] God. Well, that same faith, that same
[1:38:23] power that will lift up a fallen man or
[1:38:24] woman of that, it'll work for us in many
[1:38:27] different ways. It'll heal our bodies if
[1:38:30] you if you can't just find the right if
[1:38:32] you can just find the right approach.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; You've got to find how to do it.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; See, we know the matter works.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; The word stays the same. That's the
[1:38:43] matter.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Keep the matter the matter. Now, we have
[1:38:46] to find the manner how to make it
[1:38:49] happen. We know what the goal is.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; How? You heard it on Sunday. Speak and
[1:38:56] go forward.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; That's the manner. Speak and go forward.
[1:39:00] You can't doubt. Speak and go forward.
[1:39:03] What do you want? Speak and go forward.
[1:39:06] Don't question. Remember, he told Moses,
[1:39:08] "You would bring these people to this
[1:39:11] mountain."
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Yet he for some reason he got dazed
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; and forgot.
[1:39:19] But what the Lord told them had to be
[1:39:21] fulfilled
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; at that point. All no matter how much
[1:39:25] trouble came, no matter how much
[1:39:27] Egyptians there were, there could have
[1:39:28] been tens of millions of them. God told
[1:39:31] Moses, "This mountain,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; you will bring them to."
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Every single one of those Egyptians
[1:39:37] would have been dead.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Nothing stands in the way of a promise
[1:39:41] for a son of God.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; He said,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; and that's the same thing the Holy
[1:39:47] Spirit is. is and God's promise. Oh,
[1:39:49] this is beautiful. If we'll just let it
[1:39:52] run its way and not us get in the way,
[1:39:57] not us throw our doubts there cuz this
[1:39:59] didn't and that didn't. Just let God's
[1:40:02] Holy Spirit working and you rest upon
[1:40:06] the promise. It'll do just exactly what
[1:40:08] God said it would. Abraham was an old
[1:40:11] man, a hundred years old. When God
[1:40:13] appeared to him in the name of Almighty
[1:40:15] God, the Almighty there comes from the
[1:40:18] Hebrew word of El Shadi, which means the
[1:40:20] bosom or breast of a woman. Now, he was
[1:40:23] old. His strength was gone. But El Shadi
[1:40:26] is the almighty, the strength giver. And
[1:40:29] all Abraham had to do to obtain this
[1:40:32] promise. Put your name there because we
[1:40:34] just read earlier that Abraham's
[1:40:35] covenant, he would carry it to the seed
[1:40:37] that come after Abraham, which is you
[1:40:38] and I. He said, "And all Abraham had to
[1:40:41] do, all Benwis had to do is to to obtain
[1:40:44] this promise was lay right on that
[1:40:47] promise." Other words, like the baby to
[1:40:49] its mother and nurse from the mother,
[1:40:51] strength for the baby. And we do the
[1:40:54] same thing when we come to God and see
[1:40:56] his promise. We just lay right to him
[1:40:59] and draw from his word the strength of
[1:41:01] God given in its course, not taking our
[1:41:05] own mind, just believing it. Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; After he had endured,
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; there's an endurance.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; He obtained the promise. Oh, I just love
[1:41:16] that. You have to hear the prophet say
[1:41:18] that. Oh, I just love that. Now, the
[1:41:20] same thing works for salvation.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Same doesn't work for divine healing.
[1:41:24] How God in his great love and infinite
[1:41:26] mercy give it to us. Now, musicians,
[1:41:29] please come because if not, I don't know
[1:41:31] what's going to happen to us. Saying,
[1:41:33] surely I will bless thee
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; and will multiply thee. And so after he
[1:41:38] had patiently endured, he endured the
[1:41:40] promise. 16th verse, for men verilely
[1:41:43] swear by a greater, and the oath is
[1:41:45] confirmation, confirmed. Is it to them
[1:41:48] an end of all strife? In other words, if
[1:41:51] the oath is sworn, then that's the end
[1:41:54] of all things. If you come and say,
[1:41:56] "Brother Brandham, I as a Christian put
[1:41:58] my hand upon the Bible and so many swear
[1:42:00] that I'll do a certain thing. If God let
[1:42:03] me live to do it, I'll do it." All
[1:42:04] right. Then to me that's the end of all
[1:42:06] doubting.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; You have swore to me that you would do
[1:42:11] it. And God swore to Abraham that he
[1:42:14] would keep his covenant with him and of
[1:42:17] his seed forever.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; God swore by himself he would do it.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's all stand.
[1:42:34] This this I'll finish with this quote
[1:42:36] cuz this
[1:42:38] man this this struck me. You got to know
[1:42:41] where you stand. You got to know you've
[1:42:44] got him on the inside. Don't don't wait
[1:42:46] for somebody to confirm what you got.
[1:42:48] You got to know it's you and God and you
[1:42:51] and him alone. He's done something for
[1:42:53] me. I know he has. It doesn't matter
[1:42:55] what somebody else tells you. You know
[1:42:58] what he's done for you. No one knows
[1:43:00] like you know. No one knows where you've
[1:43:02] been. the sins you've done when no one
[1:43:03] was watching. Nobody knows, but he
[1:43:06] knows.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; And he knows he's changed you.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; You're no longer those sins. He doesn't
[1:43:12] count them towards you. Paragraph 81, he
[1:43:15] says, "Whether it's popularity, whether
[1:43:16] it's our church, whether it's our
[1:43:18] friends, our associates, whoever it may
[1:43:20] be, whether it's our doctor, whether
[1:43:22] it's our priest, whether it's our
[1:43:23] preacher, all of the grounds is sinking
[1:43:25] sands. Christ alone and every man that's
[1:43:28] ever amounted to anything in this great
[1:43:31] battlefield of strife has been men and
[1:43:33] women who stood alone on them
[1:43:35] convictions. When everything else failed
[1:43:37] and fell around them, they still stood.
[1:43:40] Abraham Lincoln of old was convinced
[1:43:42] that he was right. He stood alone on his
[1:43:44] convent convictions, but he proved it
[1:43:47] and sealed his testimony with his own
[1:43:50] blood. Jesus Christ stood alone in his
[1:43:52] day as an example that every man upon
[1:43:55] the convictions of God eternal truth
[1:43:57] that will take his stand positionally
[1:44:00] and stand will stand alone but not alone
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; with God. The invisible companion who
[1:44:08] follows us through life's journey. Amen.
[1:44:11] Down through the shadows of the valley
[1:44:12] of the shadow of death and into
[1:44:14] eternity. He'll still go with us and be
[1:44:18] God. Then what is our hope built on this
[1:44:21] morning? Because God swore that he would
[1:44:23] do it to Abraham swore not only to
[1:44:26] Abraham but every one of his seed. Who
[1:44:28] is the seed? You who have the invitation
[1:44:31] to come to the Lord Jesus Christ, the
[1:44:34] seed of Abraham. Certainly there is
[1:44:36] people who isn't called. But to every
[1:44:39] one of you here this morning that's had
[1:44:41] the call. Notice how brother Brennon
[1:44:44] breaks this down. Why are you here at
[1:44:46] church this morning? Yeah.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Or we can say, "Why are you here at
[1:44:49] church this night? Something told you to
[1:44:52] come."
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; You know, it wasn't the enemy to try to
[1:44:55] get you to do wrong. Try to get you to
[1:44:57] do wrong to come to church. You couldn't
[1:44:59] do that. When you come to church, you're
[1:45:01] doing right.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I pray this church is
[1:45:05] filled next Wednesday cuz my prophet
[1:45:07] said, "When you come to church, you do
[1:45:09] right."
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said in his own words that no
[1:45:13] man can come to me.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Anchor yourself in this. This is what
[1:45:16] he's talking about you. I don't care all
[1:45:18] the sins you've done. I don't care the
[1:45:20] sins you're still committing. That's got
[1:45:22] nothing to do with me. This is all that
[1:45:25] matters. No man come to me except my
[1:45:27] father draws him. Is there a draw?
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Then it's him that's doing the drawing.
[1:45:32] You're not too far gone. He says him
[1:45:35] that does the drawing and all that comes
[1:45:37] I'll give them everlasting life and
[1:45:40] raise him up at the last days. Think of
[1:45:42] it. Every person that comes on the
[1:45:45] invitation of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:45:47] promised eternal life and the
[1:45:49] resurrection in the last days by the
[1:45:52] Jehovah God who swore by an oath that he
[1:45:55] would do it and send his son and
[1:45:58] confirmed the word he swore it he would
[1:46:02] do it give it in type to Abraham
[1:46:04] fulfilled it in Jesus Christ raised them
[1:46:06] up. Oh, I learn says this. Living he
[1:46:08] loved me. Dying he saved me. Buried he
[1:46:11] carried my sins far away. Rising he
[1:46:13] justified. Frilly forever. Someday he's
[1:46:16] coming.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Oh glorious day.
[1:46:22] Let's bow our head saints.
[1:46:26] Gracious heavenly father,
[1:46:30] we're so thankful, Lord Jesus,
[1:46:33] that your word is so simple. Lord,
[1:46:38] you spoke you'd be with us and even in
[1:46:39] us till the end. Lord Jesus, we ought to
[1:46:42] rest in what you said. Father, not worry
[1:46:45] about the naysayers,
[1:46:47] the doubters, our own flesh that is
[1:46:49] against us. Not worry about these
[1:46:52] things, but only trust in you, Father.
[1:46:55] We know what that indwelling spirit is.
[1:46:57] It's none other than you yourself,
[1:46:58] Father. The intercessor leading and
[1:47:01] guiding us into all truth and
[1:47:03] righteousness. The teacher, the
[1:47:05] revelator on the inside that gives
[1:47:08] discernment. Father, teach us not to
[1:47:11] grieve that spirit. Lord, that we could
[1:47:13] walk faithfully according to what the
[1:47:15] spirit says and we would live a more
[1:47:17] overcoming life. Father, the problem
[1:47:19] isn't the spirit that you placed in us.
[1:47:20] The problem is our obedience to the
[1:47:22] spirit. Lord, teach us to die out more.
[1:47:26] When the death old nature tries to rise
[1:47:28] up, kill it. Cast it down. Paul said, "I
[1:47:32] die daily so that Christ might live." He
[1:47:35] says, "No longer I, but Christ that
[1:47:37] liveth in me." Paul was so honest with
[1:47:40] us. He spoke and said, "That which I
[1:47:42] want to do, I don't do, but that which I
[1:47:46] don't want to do, that I do. Behold, I f
[1:47:49] I find a law within me." He realized you
[1:47:52] can't serve God in your flesh. It's got
[1:47:55] to be the spirit. This flesh can't be
[1:47:58] redeemed. Thank God that you placed the
[1:48:01] seed on the inside of us. Father, that
[1:48:03] settled it and sealed it forever. Lord
[1:48:05] Jesus, help your children that have come
[1:48:08] into your house tonight. Father, my soul
[1:48:11] goes out, Lord Jesus. I know what it's
[1:48:13] like to try to be righteous, to try to
[1:48:15] walk in your own efforts. Lord, I make
[1:48:17] that error every day. Lord, trying to be
[1:48:19] right, trying to do right. Father, teach
[1:48:22] me to surrender. Let that indwelling
[1:48:24] spirit do what it does best and lead me,
[1:48:26] Father. Oh, your prophet spoke when he
[1:48:29] gave the testimony of Daniel Curry. He
[1:48:31] says, "Shear me, Lord, whatever it
[1:48:33] takes. Shear me, Father. Let me be with
[1:48:35] nothing, Lord Jesus, that you might lead
[1:48:38] me. That I could just follow, Lord
[1:48:40] Jesus." He could see, Lord, that the
[1:48:42] goat nature just tries to come up
[1:48:44] sometimes.
[1:48:45] Let it make us into lambs, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:48] Oh father, we invite that dove back into
[1:48:52] our hearts, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:54] Have its way, have its preeminence, Lord
[1:48:56] Jesus, bless your people. If there's a
[1:48:59] soul that's in here that's crying out
[1:49:04] that identifies not with what I said,
[1:49:06] but what your word said, Lord Jesus,
[1:49:09] that says, "I know this is true.
[1:49:13] I want this.
[1:49:15] But, Brother Ben, you're right.
[1:49:18] I don't know how to do it. I don't have
[1:49:20] the strength to do it.
[1:49:24] Father, I sympathize with that heart. I
[1:49:26] I was once there. Lord Jesus,
[1:49:30] touch the soul. Lord,
[1:49:34] with everybody's eyes closed,
[1:49:37] if you feel a tug on your heart,
[1:49:41] lift your hands to him. Don't worry
[1:49:43] about who's next to you. Don't look to
[1:49:46] see if somebody else raised their hand
[1:49:48] so you could raise yours and feel
[1:49:49] better.
[1:49:51] This is serious.
[1:49:53] We may not get more moments like these,
[1:49:55] Lord Jesus.
[1:49:57] We must act today, Lord. Stop putting
[1:50:01] things off for tomorrow, Lord Jesus.
[1:50:04] And for those that have the desire to
[1:50:07] hear that unwilling spirit's voice a bit
[1:50:09] louder, they've quieted it by the
[1:50:11] busyiness of life,
[1:50:13] but they want to hear it more.
[1:50:16] Raise your hands as well, Father.
[1:50:19] Lord, my hands are up.
[1:50:22] The busyiness of life, the struggles,
[1:50:24] the faults and errors.
[1:50:28] try to get me to doubt, Lord Jesus, to
[1:50:31] question what I know you've done. Lord,
[1:50:34] my heart, my soul, my body, my entire
[1:50:37] being is to serve you, Lord Jesus.
[1:50:41] Whatever you got to do, Lord Jesus,
[1:50:44] mold me and make me. That's my prayer,
[1:50:46] Lord Jesus. I don't see the hands that
[1:50:48] have been lifted. I don't care to see
[1:50:50] the hands that have been lifted, but you
[1:50:52] see, Lord Jesus, there's honest hearts
[1:50:55] in this building. Lord, let your spirit
[1:50:58] sweep by each one. Lord Jesus, get a
[1:51:01] hold of them, Lord Jesus. Give them a
[1:51:03] vision. Give them a taste, Lord, of what
[1:51:06] it means to have that presence following
[1:51:08] you all the days of your life, Father,
[1:51:10] that they might know there is victory.
[1:51:13] There is complete, total victory from
[1:51:15] the things of this world. We don't
[1:51:17] believe in a partial victory.
[1:51:20] We thank you, Lord. We surrender
[1:51:22] ourselves into your hands, Father. We
[1:51:25] love you. We ask this in Jesus name.
[1:51:28] Amen.
[1:51:34] Let's just sing this song as we invite
[1:51:35] brother Billy.
[1:51:40] And this is my
[1:51:43] desire
[1:51:47] to honor
[1:51:51] you.
[1:51:54] And Lord with allship
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:52:08] and all I have within me
[1:52:15] I give
[1:52:17] you
[1:52:19] praise.
[1:52:23] All that I I
[1:52:26] know
[1:52:28] is in you.
[1:52:32] [Music]
[1:52:34] Just sing it as I pray tonight. Oh, and
[1:52:38] Lord, I give you my heart
[1:52:42] and I give you my soul.
[1:52:47] I live for you, oh Lord.
[1:52:52] Every breath that I take,
[1:52:56] every moment I'm awake,
[1:53:01] Lord, have your way in me. Oh Lord, I
[1:53:07] give you my heart.
[1:53:11] Give you my soul.
[1:53:16] I live for you, oh Lord.
[1:53:21] Every breath that I take,
[1:53:25] every moment I'm away,
[1:53:30] Lord, have your way in me.
[1:53:35] Sing it again. Oh, and this is mine.
[1:53:41] Hallelujah. To worship you alone, Lord.
[1:53:45] Honor
[1:53:48] you,
[1:53:50] Lord.
[1:53:51] And Lord, with all my heart
[1:53:57] I worship you.
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:06] All I have within me,
[1:54:11] oh Lord, I give
[1:54:14] you
[1:54:16] praise
[1:54:19] and all that I
[1:54:22] adore
[1:54:25] is in you.
[1:54:34] Oh Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:54:38] I give you my soul.
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:44] I live for you. Just look for him
[1:54:48] tonight.
[1:54:50] Hallelujah.
[1:54:52] Oh, every moment on my way,
[1:54:57] Lord, have your way.
[1:55:01] Oh, and Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:55:06] I give you my soul.
[1:55:11] Oh, I live for you, oh Lord.
[1:55:16] Every breath that I take,
[1:55:20] every moment I'm away,
[1:55:25] Lord, have your way in me.
[1:55:33] The more I seek you.
[1:55:39] [Music]
[1:55:40] Oh, and the more I find you.
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:48] Oh, and the more I find you.
[1:55:55] Oh, and the more I love you.
[1:56:03] I want to sit at your feet, drink from
[1:56:07] the cup in your hand, lay back against
[1:56:12] you, and breathe. Fill your heart deep.
[1:56:18] Oh, and this love is so deep.
[1:56:22] is more than I can stand. Oh, and I rest
[1:56:27] in your peace. It's overwhelm
[1:56:31] me.
[1:56:36] Oh, and the more I seek you.
[1:56:43] Oh, and the more I find.
[1:56:47] Seek and you shall find. Oh,
[1:56:51] and the more I find you. Hallelujah.
[1:56:57] Oh Lord, and the more I love.
[1:57:03] Oh, and I want to sit at your feet.
[1:57:09] Drink from the cup in your hand. Lay
[1:57:13] back against you and breathe.
[1:57:17] Feel your heartbeat.
[1:57:20] Oh, and his love is so deep.
[1:57:24] It's more than I can stand. Oh, and I
[1:57:28] melt in your peace. It's overwhelming.
[1:57:33] Oh, and I want to sit at your feet.
[1:57:37] Drink from the cup in your hands. Lay
[1:57:41] back against you and breathe.
[1:57:47] Oh, and his love is so deep. Oh, it's
[1:57:53] more than I can stand.
[1:57:56] I'm melting your peace. It's
[1:57:59] overwhelming.
[1:58:04] Hallelujah.
[1:58:06] I tell you, there's nothing more
[1:58:08] important than to fell in love with him.
[1:58:10] Man, what we desire is the change of
[1:58:13] heart. You know when the heart is
[1:58:16] changed everything else will come easy.
[1:58:18] But if the heart is still hardened
[1:58:20] everything else is a fight. Once he
[1:58:23] changes your heart everything else will
[1:58:25] follow. What we desire is that are in
[1:58:28] our heart within the seed of our very
[1:58:30] heart may be for him and nothing else.
[1:58:33] And once we give him that first place,
[1:58:36] everything else will walk out according
[1:58:38] to his he's going to take care of all of
[1:58:40] it and you will fall and you will do
[1:58:42] wrong and everything. But you know deep
[1:58:44] inside of your heart, you want to live
[1:58:47] for him every day of your life and
[1:58:49] you're going to walk by in his presence.
[1:58:52] You're going to do everything. In fact,
[1:58:54] your works don't even unless those works
[1:58:56] are really originated from that very
[1:58:59] work that he did. Otherwise, it's just
[1:59:01] human righteousness. You know, I I even
[1:59:04] think, you know, the prophet comes and
[1:59:06] the devil comes to him and said, "Look
[1:59:08] at you after you've done all of this."
[1:59:12] Oh, yeah. He the devil will use the
[1:59:14] works. You You've given your life and
[1:59:17] you've done and and this is what he's
[1:59:19] going to do to you. Well, if that seed
[1:59:22] was not in there, then those works were
[1:59:24] going to glorify themselves and say,
[1:59:26] "That's true. That's so true." But there
[1:59:29] was a seed inside. I knew the Lord
[1:59:32] giveth, the Lord takes away. Blessed be
[1:59:34] the name of the Lord. That's what we're
[1:59:36] And if your heart can only be changed,
[1:59:39] that's what we desire as believers. Only
[1:59:41] if it could just change my heart. All my
[1:59:44] desires will change. The things where I
[1:59:47] want to go will change. But if you don't
[1:59:49] get that change, everything else is a
[1:59:52] covering. Is religion. Is you trying to
[1:59:56] portray something that you're not. But I
[1:59:59] know that he's here tonight to change
[2:00:01] you. I love what Alberto said. If Jesus
[2:00:03] was here, Jesus is here.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; He's here because his word says he's
[2:00:08] here.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; It's not here within that physical form
[2:00:12] of the robe of the man of Galilee. But
[2:00:14] his word is himself presently in his
[2:00:18] believers.
[2:00:19] That's what we desire and that's what
[2:00:21] our heart desire is. Amen. But Emanuel,
[2:00:24] if you could just come and dismiss us
[2:00:25] tonight. Amen.
[2:00:28] Amen. And if you need prayer, you may
[2:00:30] just come to the altar. After the
[2:00:32] prayer, we'll pray for you. Amen. God
[2:00:33] bless you.
[2:00:37] Let's bow our heads.
[2:00:40] Dear God,
[2:00:43] your word is truly the the word that we
[2:00:47] need in this hour. Lord,
[2:00:50] where else can we go, Lord? But to you,
[2:00:53] the God who loves us before the
[2:00:55] foundation of the world. Lord,
[2:00:58] thank you for giving us this faith.
[2:01:01] Lord, thank you for lifting us our faith
[2:01:04] to believe more than ever to you, Lord.
[2:01:09] Thank you for the salvation you've given
[2:01:12] to us and the forgiveness of our sin,
[2:01:15] Lord, because of your blood through your
[2:01:17] son, Lord Jesus.
[2:01:20] May you keep us safe, Lord, in the
[2:01:23] coming days. I know Lord there will be a
[2:01:26] struggles Lord but with you in us we
[2:01:30] will we will have the victory Lord.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord God help us in every way.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Give us the strength Lord wherever we
[2:01:42] are.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; This is hard time Lord.
[2:01:50] May you remember also those
[2:01:53] our loved ones Lord are dearest to our
[2:01:56] hearts.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Wherever they are Lord may you keep them
[2:02:03] safe Lord.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; May you not let them go Lord.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; I know you love them too. Yes.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; And always remember our pastor wherever
[2:02:22] he is, Lord. And may you give him the
[2:02:25] grace and mercy and strength.
[2:02:28] May he be a light, Lord, to those people
[2:02:31] where he is, Lord. I pray
[2:02:37] give back the strength to our brother
[2:02:38] who preached tonight. Lord truly it's a
[2:02:42] bless such a blessing Lord I pray
[2:02:47] we give you all the grace and mercy all
[2:02:50] the blessing Lord and the honor Jesus
[2:02:54] Christ's name we pray amen
