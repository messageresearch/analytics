[11:23] amen good
[11:25] morning it's a wonderful day and and we
[11:30] thank the Lord and I I hope you enjoyed
[11:33] your new parking
[11:35] spot this morning and and we trust the
[11:39] Lord will just continue to bless
[11:42] us uh we have a special little
[11:46] presentation from our Sunday
[11:48] School uh class this morning and they've
[11:51] worked hard on it and I know you're
[11:53] going to be excited to enjoy in this uh
[11:58] wonderful time of Fellowship as we want
[12:02] to teach a child in the way it should go
[12:06] there's a lot of voices out there today
[12:09] um many of the parents that have
[12:11] children in school are facing all the
[12:15] new ideas and new thinking and so many
[12:20] things that they're trying to direct our
[12:23] children too and our Sunday school
[12:26] teachers and our Sunday school helpers
[12:28] and
[12:29] everyone involved want to point our
[12:32] children to the truth which is God's
[12:36] word and God's gospel and his son our
[12:39] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so this is
[12:44] a great effort to get them involved and
[12:46] for them to realize that they have
[12:49] Fellowship one with another and that's a
[12:52] great sign of what Christianity is they
[12:56] will know that you are my disciples by
[12:58] your loveed one for another and when the
[13:01] kids can love one another and work
[13:03] together I think it all builds to what
[13:05] that we're building for is just to have
[13:08] a a real Christian attitude and spirit
[13:12] of love and forgiveness not looking back
[13:16] but always looking forward so let's at
[13:19] this time let us just stand together
[13:22] and and uh we're going to ask the Lord
[13:25] to bless us and then uh we'll start
[13:29] start our our little uh program this
[13:32] morning let's pray together our gracious
[13:34] Heavenly

[13:40] us that he laid down his life for
[13:44] us and today Lord we come

[17:12] to meet some friends inside for dinner
[17:14] I'm already late I'm sorry ma'am you
[17:16] can't come and dress like that
[17:18] regardless of who your friends are
[17:19] what's wrong with the way I'm dressed
[17:21] this is the red side Fellowship you need
[17:23] a red tie to come in that's ridiculous
[17:27] it's the rule nobody get to the red tie
[17:29] Fellowship without a red tie I don't
[17:31] have time for this I'll miss my
[17:38] meeting here this ought to help you look
[17:41] the other way while I slip
[17:43] in you can't buy your way in ma'am I
[17:45] work for the richest man in town bribes
[17:48] mean nothing to me do you know who I am
[17:51] you just said you were Bailey blocks
[17:53] have you forgotten who you are no I mean
[17:56] you don't know who you're dealing with
[17:58] I'm friends with the mayor and all the
[17:59] city councilmen know my name so let me
[18:02] in before I have to tell them you
[18:03] disrespected me ma'am the owner is
[18:06] richer than all of them and it's no
[18:07] respector of persons no amount of
[18:10] contacts can get you in without a red
[18:11] tie nobody gets in the red tie
[18:13] Fellowship without a red tie look I can
[18:16] get a red tie later but I need to get it
[18:18] right now my friends are probably
[18:20] waiting at the table for me right now go
[18:22] ask them they'll vouch for me it won't
[18:24] do you any good ma'am no one inside has
[18:26] any influence on who gets in
[18:31] I don't believe this I really need to
[18:32] meet with these people my financial
[18:35] future could depend on getting this
[18:36] contract won't you give me a break hey I
[18:39] donate to Charities all the time I'll
[18:41] donate to one in the fellowship's
[18:43] name that's very committable ma'am but
[18:46] it doesn't get you in look I'm just as
[18:49] good as any of the people already in
[18:51] there better than some even it's not
[18:52] fair if you let others in and keep
[18:54] others out on the contrary our Ru is the
[18:57] only fair way to let anyone in it makes
[18:59] everybody the same since they only get
[19:01] in by virtue of wearing the red tie just
[19:04] get out of my way report me once I'm in
[19:06] trying to force R in his feet out ma'am
[19:08] I'm much stronger than you just try to
[19:10] stop me please don't do that ma'am
[19:12] you'll only hurt yourself no one has
[19:14] ever gotten through me around me or past
[19:17] me no kidding you're like running to a

[23:29] rules yes and I'm going stick by them
[23:31] nobody gets in the red tie fellowship

[23:52] if you can't loan me one and I can't buy
[23:54] one from you or anyone else then what do
[23:57] I do you must simply
[24:01] ask ask that's all that's
[24:06] it these are wait a minute
[24:09] the wait a minute it can't be that easy
[24:12] not after all that these red ties are
[24:15] too costly just to be free true they are
[24:18] not free but a high price was paid for
[24:20] them but I am paying it and giving it to
[24:22] those that ask as a gift it's too easy
[24:25] there must be a catch I don't believe it
[24:28] well you must believe it if you are to
[24:30] ask and receive it otherwise you'll
[24:32] never
[24:34] ask if getting a tie so easy why didn't
[24:37] D here just offer me one he could have
[24:40] gotten me in right away D has no ties to
[24:43] give all he can do is tell you that you
[24:45] need one so ask and you shall receive
[24:49] don't you want to check my background
[24:51] see if I'm worthy or
[24:52] something your background doesn't matter
[24:54] to me it's forgotten helping you build a
[24:57] bright future is my place

[26:14] the cloud of

[26:29] he God has a way a provided way there's
[26:34] two ways a man can go and that's his way

[26:45] wrong way and God's way is the right way
[26:48] and you can't be in your own way and in

[57:25] we just need you and we ask you to just
[57:28] take us
[57:29] from out of the way

[57:35] stand before
[57:36] us by its own
[57:39] Merit by its own
[57:42] Vindication we ask that with all of our
[57:45] hearts this morning in Jesus precious
[57:48] name we pray
[57:50] amen amen uh God bless you may be seated
[57:54] for a moment this morning certainly
[57:58] um thank the musicians and everybody
[58:01] that so labored and
[58:03] um um you know for all our musicians
[58:07] Sunday school teachers deacons and
[58:10] trustees and our sound booth people and
[58:15] our uh interpreters and everything we
[58:18] have a little something for you after
[58:19] service if you would try to get with us
[58:22] uh that would uh would be wonderful uh
[58:26] we all we want to remember Matthew and
[58:28] Andrew in prayer because they're fixing
[58:30] to head off to Roma Romania this evening
[58:35] and we trust that that would be a a
[58:37] great blessing uh for you but I was
[58:40] asked this morning and and I'd like to
[58:42] do this uh we have a new family that's
[58:46] come to be with us uh they were from
[58:49] moved south from Oklahoma but originally
[58:52] I believe they're from
[58:54] Brazil and uh it's uh brother Thiago and
[58:59] sister
[59:01] talene and uh um uh pedosa I believe if
[59:07] I got their name right uh where are you
[59:10] if you are you here would you stand up
[59:11] so and their children go ahead and stand
[59:13] up brother and sister God bless
[59:19] you thank you so much amen they said
[59:22] brother we want to be introduced to the
[59:25] congregation we're this is our church
[59:28] amen well that's your brother and sister
[59:31] so now uh now you're obligated to take
[59:34] care of them I'll preach the gospel you
[59:37] take care of them amen is that the way
[59:40] that it should work it if it's wonderful
[59:43] so uh we're really grateful uh for
[59:46] everything that God's done I I'm not
[59:48] used to being behind such a small Podium
[59:51] I I take shelter and being surrounded
[59:54] but uh uh we're going to try to go
[59:58] forward in the word this morning uh on
[1:00:03] the subject line that we've talked about
[1:00:06] and uh uh brother BR makes a statement
[1:00:10] he says uh you know I have a lot of
[1:00:13] things to say and some of them are very
[1:00:16] flat he said so he he asked the sisters
[1:00:19] he said please take this with
[1:00:21] understanding well I think that's what
[1:00:23] we all want is our understanding
[1:00:26] uh increased and and to grow so uh we're
[1:00:31] going to go through the word of God sort
[1:00:33] of as a Sunday school lesson
[1:00:37] uh maybe try to put a little evangelism
[1:00:40] in there and a little preaching in there
[1:00:43] and just trust that when it's all said
[1:00:46] and done the Lord is present with us and
[1:00:50] that we wouldn't do anything to keep him
[1:00:54] you know the scripture said he didn't
[1:00:56] come with enticing words but Empower and
[1:00:59] demonstration of the Holy
[1:01:02] Spirit I would rather see lives
[1:01:06] changed and people
[1:01:08] delivered and their hearts set a flame
[1:01:11] than anything else there's none of us
[1:01:14] perfect in fact the scripture says that
[1:01:17] our righteousness is as filthy rags and
[1:01:20] all of us come short of the glory of God
[1:01:24] but as we saw in our skit today day
[1:01:26] because of that Crimson
[1:01:29] thread that tie that binds us is the
[1:01:33] blood of Jesus Christ we all have hope
[1:01:37] and this is given to an age of the
[1:01:42] Overcomer and if we didn't have
[1:01:45] something to
[1:01:47] overcome then we couldn't be
[1:01:50] Overcomers and it's given to the
[1:01:52] Overcomer to sit with him in his throne
[1:01:57] so we have to realize that there's a
[1:01:59] great struggle set before us and that
[1:02:03] there's something that we have to
[1:02:06] overcome it's when we fail to realize
[1:02:09] that we're in a battle and that life's a
[1:02:13] constant Warfare when we begin to take
[1:02:16] things for granted and we don't realize
[1:02:19] the importance of what is taking place
[1:02:24] that's when that we become
[1:02:26] lukewarm and we begin to shrink back but
[1:02:30] the scripture says leave those things
[1:02:32] which are behind behind and press for a
[1:02:36] higher calling and there's a great High
[1:02:39] Calling that lies before us all this
[1:02:42] morning and that great High Calling is
[1:02:45] the rapture the Rapture is the most
[1:02:49] important thing on our agenda you do not
[1:02:54] want to miss the
[1:02:56] Rapture the Rapture is in important
[1:03:00] would uh you give me a little bottle of
[1:03:02] water please the the Rapture is
[1:03:05] important so uh is it
[1:03:08] underneath oh they hid it from
[1:03:12] me okay thank
[1:03:17] you the Rapture is
[1:03:20] important in other words you don't want
[1:03:23] to be here for what's going to take
[1:03:25] place after the
[1:03:28] Rapture but you don't want to take for
[1:03:31] granted that you're just going to be
[1:03:35] there you understand amen you you you
[1:03:40] want to you want to make
[1:03:42] sure you want to make sure you're in the
[1:03:45] spirit you want to make sure that you've
[1:03:49] been borned again Jesus's First Gospel
[1:03:53] that he ever taught was you must be born
[1:03:56] again and we're going to go through that
[1:03:59] this morning why that we must be born
[1:04:03] again what is it mean to be born to
[1:04:05] again what is the battle that we're
[1:04:08] facing and I'll tell you okay it's bad
[1:04:11] when you don't when you're in a battle
[1:04:14] and you don't know
[1:04:15] it amen but we want to fight for our
[1:04:18] lives we want to possess the gates of
[1:04:21] the enemy we we want to put on the whole
[1:04:24] armor of God
[1:04:26] we want to fight a good fight we want to
[1:04:29] run the race that's set before us that's
[1:04:32] what that's what our our heart's desire
[1:04:34] there's no big eyes there's no little
[1:04:36] use We're In It Together there's nobody
[1:04:39] that's been paid for more we've all been
[1:04:42] purchased if I could say or Redeemed by
[1:04:45] the same price and we want to make full
[1:04:49] uh take full possession of our
[1:04:52] Redemption this morning so as we go
[1:04:55] forward forward we just ask that you
[1:04:56] could be attentive we're going to listen
[1:04:59] to 15 minutes of a a sermon this morning
[1:05:02] we're going to speak on it we'll try to
[1:05:05] move along so it's not too long this
[1:05:07] morning because of of the the play but
[1:05:11] let's stand together and let's turn over
[1:05:13] in our
[1:05:14] Bibles to one
[1:05:17] scripture and I think this is a a
[1:05:20] glorious scripture for our day that
[1:05:23] we're living in and it it's it's found
[1:05:26] in
[1:05:27] Matthew uh the 13th
[1:05:31] chapter and the the 35th
[1:05:45] verse the 34th verse reads like
[1:05:53] this and these things spake Jesus unto
[1:05:57] the multitude in Parables and without a
[1:06:02] parable spoke he not unto
[1:06:06] them now you see the importance of
[1:06:10] Revelation that it might be fulfilled
[1:06:13] which was spoken by the prophet saying I
[1:06:16] will open my mouth in Parables I will
[1:06:20] utter things which have been kept secret
[1:06:25] from the foundations of the world
[1:06:29] Hallelujah Heavenly Father we ask you to
[1:06:32] bless your word to us in your precious
[1:06:35] name we pray amen God bless you this
[1:06:39] morning you may be
[1:06:48] seated we talked a little
[1:06:51] bit uh last Wednesday night on the
[1:06:55] import of the word of God the word of
[1:06:58] God is the most important thing in our
[1:07:01] life it's the only thing that's
[1:07:05] truth my word is truth let every word of
[1:07:09] man be a lie but my word is true there
[1:07:14] there's no other truth but God's
[1:07:18] word and uh without the word of God we
[1:07:22] have no way of knowing the
[1:07:26] truth Jesus said I am the way the truth
[1:07:30] the life no man cometh under the father
[1:07:34] but by me there there's only one way and
[1:07:38] there's only one way that we know him is
[1:07:42] that through his word you you know him
[1:07:45] by the things that he spoke and I'd like
[1:07:48] to read this statement to you so you can
[1:07:52] understand
[1:07:53] that that the word of God either you're
[1:07:57] judged now or you'll be judged
[1:08:02] someday but the scripture simply says
[1:08:05] these things and I'd like to read this
[1:08:06] out of the message uh the spoken word is
[1:08:09] the Original Seed he says now the word
[1:08:13] of God continually goes
[1:08:17] on so ever since it was
[1:08:20] spoken it continually goes on it doesn't
[1:08:25] stop it doesn't change it remains ever
[1:08:30] the same and it continually goes on the
[1:08:34] word of God is going on going on we read
[1:08:37] the same Bible this morning that the uh
[1:08:41] uh that they read for hundreds of years
[1:08:44] the same scriptures and yet every time
[1:08:47] that we read it it becomes fresh to us
[1:08:50] it becomes new to us because it's living
[1:08:53] word amen man changes but the word of
[1:08:57] God doesn't and because God's word's
[1:08:59] Eternal he could speak it in a way that
[1:09:03] it would meet the challenge of any hour
[1:09:06] any time any place that word of God is
[1:09:10] good uh we talked about and many of you
[1:09:13] have done the same thing how that we've
[1:09:15] read our Bible over the years and we'd
[1:09:17] Mark scriptures and write scriptures
[1:09:19] down and then you find yourself in a
[1:09:22] different time of life a different
[1:09:24] situation in life and you might come
[1:09:26] across a scripture that you read in the
[1:09:28] past and yet now that scripture takes on
[1:09:31] new life for you because the word of God
[1:09:34] is Not history the word of God is the
[1:09:37] revelation of a living
[1:09:40] being it's the way that he continually
[1:09:43] reveals himself like any relationship
[1:09:47] you you seem to grow and and you seem to
[1:09:51] know one another and think one another
[1:09:54] and you grow together and and and your
[1:09:57] relationship grows you just don't meet
[1:09:59] somebody and you know everything about
[1:10:02] them and that's the end of the
[1:10:06] story
[1:10:08] no it it's a wonderful in fact the word
[1:10:11] of God tells us it'll take Eternity for
[1:10:14] him to reveal
[1:10:15] himself so the the word of God is is
[1:10:20] what that we have to Anchor in in fact
[1:10:23] we know that faith has to have a resting
[1:10:26] place it has to have some place that it
[1:10:29] can anchor to some place that it can
[1:10:32] hold to not a feeling not an emotion not
[1:10:35] an excitement but it's got to be a
[1:10:38] promise and every word of God is a
[1:10:41] promise because there's one thing that
[1:10:43] God can't do and is God can't lie so if
[1:10:47] he says it it's
[1:10:50] true if he says it that's the way it's
[1:10:53] going to be
[1:10:56] that that's that's what we we realize
[1:10:59] that that's why the word of God is so
[1:11:03] important that's why we emphasize the
[1:11:06] word of God we don't emphasize emotion
[1:11:09] we don't emphasize
[1:11:12] anointing we don't emphasize rain
[1:11:15] because the rain falls on the just and
[1:11:18] the unjust but we emphasize the
[1:11:23] maturity of the Believers
[1:11:26] Faith to Anchor in what he
[1:11:30] said and and to believe that regardless
[1:11:34] of the
[1:11:35] circumstances and the surrounding things
[1:11:38] and and whatever happens in history and
[1:11:41] whatever happens in time what God Said
[1:11:45] will
[1:11:47] remain so we don't want to turn from the
[1:11:50] left we don't want to turn from the
[1:11:52] right we want to know for sure
[1:11:56] what it is and I don't want to follow
[1:12:00] man's interpretation of the word I want
[1:12:03] to follow his
[1:12:05] word because he is the word in the
[1:12:10] beginning was the
[1:12:12] word not in the beginning was a an
[1:12:16] emotion not in the beginning was an
[1:12:20] anointing you know great artist in the
[1:12:23] world great uh
[1:12:26] rock stars and writers and actresses and
[1:12:31] all those things they come under the
[1:12:33] anointing of the
[1:12:35] part they get if we could quote unquote
[1:12:39] they get in the spirit of the
[1:12:43] role he didn't want us ever to get
[1:12:46] caught up in
[1:12:47] that he want us to know one thing it is
[1:12:52] going to be the way that he spoke
[1:12:56] it Hallelujah if you have to wait on
[1:12:59] it you wait on
[1:13:02] it yes if you have to battle ideas and
[1:13:06] mental battles and everything you battle
[1:13:09] it but what he
[1:13:11] said is the truth now listening to how
[1:13:15] important the word of God is so we just
[1:13:18] read this one little paragraph here the
[1:13:21] word of God continues
[1:13:24] on I'm told that if we could pick up an
[1:13:28] instrument that could catch it that a
[1:13:32] man's voice my voice that I speak today
[1:13:36] 10,000 years from now could still be
[1:13:40] picked up in the air it's like dropping
[1:13:44] a pebble in the middle of a
[1:13:49] pond and and the tiny little waves after
[1:13:54] they fail to be seen by the eye continue
[1:14:00] on till it hits the
[1:14:03] bank and the airwaves of our voice
[1:14:07] continually travels around and around
[1:14:11] the
[1:14:12] world therefore then our voice what we
[1:14:16] say will be our
[1:14:23] judgment now we're going to hold
[1:14:26] that cuz remember he spoke to us in
[1:14:28] Parables that the things which forid the
[1:14:32] secrets from the world are now made
[1:14:36] known he says then our then our voice
[1:14:39] what we say will be our judgment Our
[1:14:42] Testimony will rise up against us our
[1:14:46] own voice will be echoed in our own ears
[1:14:50] at the Judgment bar of God when his
[1:14:54] great instrument catches every voice
[1:14:58] that's been spoke every word that's been
[1:15:04] muttered kind of makes you think of that
[1:15:07] scripture the tongue is an unruly member
[1:15:10] and can bitter or sweet come forth from
[1:15:13] the same
[1:15:15] Fountain now there's only one way to
[1:15:19] stop that voice that's
[1:15:22] wrong that's repent amen
[1:15:29] there's a lot of voices in your life a
[1:15:31] lot of Temptations things that keep
[1:15:34] coming back to you that you find
[1:15:37] yourself repeating and repeating and and
[1:15:41] you try to make things right and you try
[1:15:43] to do things different but that Voice
[1:15:46] keeps tempting you it keeps calling you
[1:15:50] it keeps leading you into a Temptation
[1:15:53] it keeps leading you into into a failure
[1:15:56] and and and and you you purpose within
[1:15:59] your heart I'm never going to do that
[1:16:00] again I'm never going to go there again
[1:16:03] I'm never going to look at that again
[1:16:05] I'm never going to do this again but
[1:16:07] you'll never stop that voice until you
[1:16:15] repent that's the
[1:16:18] way that what must we
[1:16:21] do to enter the kingdom of God repent
[1:16:25] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:16:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:16:32] remission of your
[1:16:35] sin for the remitting what does that
[1:16:38] mean the taking away when you've
[1:16:40] remitted a bill that bill no longer on
[1:16:43] your charge it's paid
[1:16:46] for but you can't bypass
[1:16:50] repentance doesn't have to be a public
[1:16:53] show but get some where with God and say
[1:16:56] God I'm sorry and if you've offended
[1:17:02] somebody don't be
[1:17:05] ashamed to say I'm sorry I was
[1:17:11] wrong I got a little feisty with the uh
[1:17:16] with a uh somebody on the phone the
[1:17:20] other day concerning an
[1:17:22] account and and and I mean I wasn't
[1:17:26] unchristian but you know I could have
[1:17:28] been a lot
[1:17:31] sweeter whole lot
[1:17:35] sweeter and so I went back over there
[1:17:38] and and uh you know I I I thought they
[1:17:41] done me wrong and you know they charged
[1:17:45] something in my card that I wanted to
[1:17:47] pay with a check and and I didn't tell
[1:17:49] them to charge my card and they were
[1:17:52] going to charge me 3% and and and on you
[1:17:55] know let's just just a little background
[1:17:57] so I went over to pay
[1:17:59] it and I I walked in the door and I
[1:18:02] thought you
[1:18:04] know I'm going to go tell that person
[1:18:06] I'm
[1:18:09] sorry so I went in and I said you know
[1:18:12] I'm I'm sorry I got a little feisty oh
[1:18:14] you know you oh don't worry about it I
[1:18:17] totally understand we appreciate your
[1:18:20] business you're you're really one of our
[1:18:22] best customers you know wow
[1:18:26] that's the fruit of
[1:18:30] repentance don't let things go that you
[1:18:32] can repent of I say that to you as a
[1:18:35] friend I say that you as a pastor keep
[1:18:39] things right make things
[1:18:41] right the scripture says the scripture
[1:18:45] the word the secret Mysteries says don't
[1:18:50] let the sun go down upon your wrath if
[1:18:53] you offended your brother go before you
[1:18:56] bring your sacrifice and make that
[1:18:59] right make those things right repent of
[1:19:03] those things keep your slate
[1:19:05] clean because what happens if you repent
[1:19:08] it goes before you right and he's
[1:19:11] faithful and just to forgive you to
[1:19:15] throw it in the sea of God's
[1:19:17] forgetfulness not to be remembered
[1:19:19] anymore that's the kind of God we serve
[1:19:22] that's the kind of love we serve but he
[1:19:24] wants to see something from you that
[1:19:27] makes it appear that you believe in what
[1:19:29] he
[1:19:31] said
[1:19:32] amen your actions speak louder than your
[1:19:39] words but yet your very words will judge
[1:19:42] you let us
[1:19:45] continue and now there's only one way to
[1:19:48] stop that voice that's wrong that's
[1:19:50] repent God Alone can stop it
[1:19:56] if it doesn't it goes on to meet up with
[1:20:00] you in
[1:20:04] eternity now just think of all those
[1:20:07] things you
[1:20:09] said if you don't repent what's going to
[1:20:12] happen it's going to go on and meet you
[1:20:14] in eternity but if you repent what does
[1:20:17] God do he stops
[1:20:20] it you don't have to carry the
[1:20:23] past
[1:20:25] God Alone can stop it if it doesn't it
[1:20:28] goes on to meet you up with you in
[1:20:32] eternity therefore
[1:20:35] God therefore God being perfect and his
[1:20:40] voice
[1:20:42] Eternal his own voice will have to catch
[1:20:46] up with it therefore he must be perfect
[1:20:50] in every decision for when he once said
[1:20:54] says something it has to go all the way
[1:20:59] and come back
[1:21:01] to the Judgment let's just look at a
[1:21:05] couple scriptures real quick Matthew 12
[1:21:08] and
[1:21:19] 36 what are we talking about the word
[1:21:23] the importance of the word word how the
[1:21:26] word Works in our life what the word of
[1:21:29] God does for us he says but I say unto
[1:21:32] you that Every Idle Word that man shall
[1:21:37] speak they shall give account therefore
[1:21:41] in the day of
[1:21:45] judgment there's word for
[1:21:49] word for by thy words thou shal be
[1:21:53] justified
[1:21:55] and by thy words Thou shalt be
[1:22:01] condemned let us turn over to Matthew
[1:22:15] 24-35 Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[1:22:19] but my words shall not pass away so now
[1:22:23] we just read this this paragraph right
[1:22:26] and we're coming back with scripture
[1:22:28] after scripture you will always find
[1:22:31] that the way of a true Prophet is the
[1:22:33] word of God now we don't know always how
[1:22:37] what the interpretation of the word of
[1:22:39] God is but when a prophet interprets the
[1:22:42] word of God he brings us back to the
[1:22:44] word of God that we see that it says
[1:22:47] exactly what it says Now isn't that
[1:22:51] exactly what we read let's read St John
[1:22:54] the 12th chapter John
[1:22:58] 1247 and
[1:23:01] 48 we're talking of the importance of
[1:23:04] the word because we're going to go look
[1:23:06] at what does the word do for us why do
[1:23:10] we have to have the
[1:23:12] word not a sensation not an emotion not
[1:23:16] a running not a shouting all which is
[1:23:20] fine but none of that does anything for
[1:23:23] you comes and it goes the spirit is like
[1:23:27] the wind right it lists here for a while
[1:23:31] and it goes over here for a while and
[1:23:32] you don't know where it went you don't
[1:23:34] know but what's the one constant that
[1:23:37] should remain in every believer's life
[1:23:40] that's God's
[1:23:42] word because the word is him if he is in
[1:23:46] you the word is in
[1:23:52] you amen is that simple
[1:23:55] it's so
[1:23:57] simple but we got an
[1:24:00] adversary who is the father of all
[1:24:04] lies and there's what no truth in him
[1:24:09] Thy word is
[1:24:13] truth so what does the one thing our
[1:24:17] adversary
[1:24:19] lacks the
[1:24:22] word not knowledge
[1:24:26] not
[1:24:28] stimulation not
[1:24:33] explanation but the word the pure
[1:24:38] true
[1:24:40] unadulterated word of
[1:24:44] God we're trying to establish in our
[1:24:47] hearts this morning the
[1:24:51] importance of God's word amen
[1:24:56] yes it's the word the word back to the
[1:25:01] word how many
[1:25:03] times did the voice of this generation
[1:25:07] cry out to us back to the
[1:25:12] word the only
[1:25:15] thing that's going to do the
[1:25:19] job that's right if any man hear my
[1:25:23] words
[1:25:24] and believe
[1:25:27] not I judge him
[1:25:30] not for I came not to judge the world
[1:25:35] but to save the
[1:25:36] world he that rejecteth
[1:25:40] me and receiveth not my
[1:25:44] words hath one that judge
[1:25:48] him the word that I have spoken the same
[1:25:53] shall judge him in the last
[1:25:57] day so he said I'll judge no man but my
[1:26:02] word will judge him in the last days so
[1:26:05] you understand what judgment you're
[1:26:08] heading for you're not heading for the
[1:26:11] Judgment of your good
[1:26:16] works you're not heading for the
[1:26:19] Judgment of the evil that you've
[1:26:23] done
[1:26:26] you know it's you can't go through life
[1:26:28] think you're going to weigh out your
[1:26:30] good with your bad and and my bad
[1:26:32] counsels this out and and all this you
[1:26:35] know I like in our little play right
[1:26:38] they tried to buy the red
[1:26:40] tie what could I do to get it no there's
[1:26:43] only one thing that's going to meet you
[1:26:46] there's only one thing you're going to
[1:26:48] be judged by and that's by the
[1:26:53] word and we all are going to come into
[1:26:55] the
[1:26:57] Judgment so wouldn't it behoove
[1:27:01] us with common
[1:27:05] sense that if you know what you're going
[1:27:07] to be judged
[1:27:08] by then that's what you want to line up
[1:27:13] to you can't present nothing
[1:27:18] else because if you try to present
[1:27:21] something else you've altered the word
[1:27:24] of God the word of God
[1:27:27] said we've read three
[1:27:32] scriptures that what we're going to meet
[1:27:34] is what the
[1:27:37] word his
[1:27:39] teaching his
[1:27:41] judgments because the scripture says
[1:27:44] that my judgments are
[1:27:49] true so we we want to settle that
[1:27:55] as we move forward this morning that
[1:27:59] what that we're wanting to set in place
[1:28:02] here is the word the importance of the
[1:28:05] word and why that we need the
[1:28:09] word and and so as as we look at I'll
[1:28:14] make a few comments we'll listen to a
[1:28:16] few minutes of tape and then we'll
[1:28:18] finish as we try to set up the tape so
[1:28:23] we understand understand
[1:28:26] that the the importance of the word of
[1:28:30] God because we've got to have something
[1:28:35] that meets the condition of the
[1:28:39] hour
[1:28:42] right we know that the scripture tells
[1:28:45] us in the last days perilous times shall
[1:28:48] come men shall be lovers of pleasure
[1:28:51] more than lovers of God they'll be
[1:28:54] deceivers their conscience will be
[1:28:57] snared with a hot
[1:29:00] iron you wonder how can people commit
[1:29:03] the crimes that they commit today how
[1:29:06] can the evil roam because they've
[1:29:09] rejected the word of God and their
[1:29:12] conscience has been sneered with the hot
[1:29:15] iron in other words their conscience has
[1:29:18] been sealed up in them so no longer
[1:29:21] there they have no consciousness of what
[1:29:27] sin God help
[1:29:30] us that we we come to a place that we
[1:29:34] don't have any consciousness of sin the
[1:29:37] only thing that gives you the
[1:29:39] consciousness of sin which is unbelief
[1:29:42] is the word of
[1:29:44] God
[1:29:47] Amen not an eye for an
[1:29:50] eye and a tooth for a tooth but if
[1:29:53] someone Smite the on the left cheek
[1:29:55] turned to him also the
[1:29:57] right if a brother compels you to go a
[1:30:00] mile go Twain if he ask of thee land not
[1:30:04] seeking to borrow again oh I tell you
[1:30:07] what we need we need the love of God we
[1:30:09] need Christianity we need to be born
[1:30:12] again we need to be led by the spirit of
[1:30:19] God we're getting away with way too
[1:30:22] much
[1:30:24] come
[1:30:25] on I would talk about weak pulpits but
[1:30:28] I'd put myself under
[1:30:35] condemnation it can't meet the condition
[1:30:37] of the
[1:30:38] hour it can't meet the
[1:30:41] challenge of the
[1:30:44] hour we're in a challenge right
[1:30:47] now Satan's challenging
[1:30:51] you he don't believe your bride
[1:30:55] he don't believe you're married he don't
[1:30:58] believe you have an invisible
[1:31:03] Union if Satan made job prove
[1:31:07] it what makes you think you're getting
[1:31:09] away SC
[1:31:11] free he said if he didn't judge this
[1:31:14] generation for their sins he'd have to
[1:31:17] raise Sodom gamor up
[1:31:22] again
[1:31:24] ain't no
[1:31:26] Cakewalk it's a
[1:31:30] battle it's a
[1:31:34] war Satan goes about like a roaring lion
[1:31:37] seeking you may devour that's right what
[1:31:40] are you GNA do think he's some kitty
[1:31:42] cat kitty kitty kitty kitty oh nice
[1:31:47] kitty you know what he said about that
[1:31:50] Pentecostal kitty cat oh you can p One
[1:31:54] Way long as you're petting it the right
[1:31:56] way well you run that hand back up
[1:31:59] against that word you run that
[1:32:06] word be bad if we started getting in
[1:32:08] that condition right where we couldn't
[1:32:11] take correction anymore we couldn't take
[1:32:13] instruction
[1:32:17] anymore we're too ashamed to admit that
[1:32:20] we're
[1:32:22] wrong I'll tell you you're not ashamed
[1:32:25] to admit what's wrong if you know what's
[1:32:27] at
[1:32:28] stake why hang on to a Teddy a petty
[1:32:35] Pride why hang on to
[1:32:39] something that's going to
[1:32:42] destroy and and take away your
[1:32:47] reward let every man build on but let
[1:32:50] let every man watch how he builds
[1:32:52] righten
[1:32:55] that his Works aren't
[1:32:58] destroyed I don't want to be saved by
[1:33:00] fire I want to be saved by love I want
[1:33:03] to be saved by his spirit I want to be
[1:33:06] saved by his word I don't want to come
[1:33:08] into the
[1:33:15] Judgment it won't meet the challenge of
[1:33:19] the hour in other words they're not
[1:33:22] prepared for the
[1:33:25] deception
[1:33:26] Satan uh appears to
[1:33:30] have they're not prepared for the
[1:33:34] deception because Satan appears as an
[1:33:40] angel of
[1:33:44] Light oh all these good works you think
[1:33:47] he shows up with a little Pitchfork
[1:33:49] little forked things and a little tongue
[1:33:51] oh no he's a sweet
[1:33:56] talker all he's after is to get you to
[1:34:01] reason all he's trying to get you to do
[1:34:04] is second guess all he's trying to do is
[1:34:07] get you to think
[1:34:11] twice let me explain to you what he
[1:34:15] meant he meant what he
[1:34:20] said did he ask you did you feel it
[1:34:26] did he ask you if he understood it he
[1:34:29] asked you one thing do you believe it if
[1:34:33] you believe it plant it in your heart
[1:34:37] it'll grow it'll produce life so they're
[1:34:40] not ready for the
[1:34:42] deception that Satan has to
[1:34:46] offer the deception of Satan is H
[1:34:51] breeding right amen
[1:34:55] that's what his deception is to hybrid
[1:34:59] something what does hybrid mean it means
[1:35:02] the
[1:35:04] mixing of two different
[1:35:07] elements or
[1:35:10] species to produce something
[1:35:16] different it's the mixing of two
[1:35:20] different things what did Satan in the
[1:35:23] garden mix he mixed the tree of
[1:35:26] knowledge of Good and Evil the mixture
[1:35:29] of Science Education civilization trying
[1:35:34] to mix it with the word of
[1:35:37] God the word of God does not
[1:35:43] mix the deception of the
[1:35:48] hour is hiting
[1:35:51] mixing what is the process that Satan
[1:35:55] uses to mix things
[1:36:02] reasoning people don't like a clearcut
[1:36:08] line they always want
[1:36:13] compromise well let's take a little of
[1:36:15] this and let's take a little of that if
[1:36:18] you compromise the recipe you don't get
[1:36:21] the product you get some something
[1:36:24] different it might taste
[1:36:28] good it might
[1:36:30] satisfy it might be sufficient but what
[1:36:34] is it not it's not the original that's
[1:36:37] right that's right and the only person
[1:36:40] that can tell it's not the original is
[1:36:43] the person that created the recipe in
[1:36:46] the first
[1:36:50] place and when they look at it said this
[1:36:52] don't have the Tex texture I design this
[1:36:55] don't have the moisture I design this
[1:36:58] don't have the flavor I design this
[1:37:00] don't have the look I design this is a
[1:37:03] hybrid something else has been mixed in
[1:37:06] here Satan's deception is
[1:37:10] hybriding and let me say this this
[1:37:13] morning I hope I don't sound angry but
[1:37:17] I've got to press myself uh to to say
[1:37:21] what's the
[1:37:22] truth
[1:37:24] you can hybrid by taking
[1:37:29] away sure you
[1:37:32] can it doesn't it you leave something
[1:37:36] else you leave something
[1:37:39] out the original product has been
[1:37:44] hybrid it's going to produce something
[1:37:47] different you're mixing so many of the
[1:37:51] ingredients but you're not fixing all
[1:37:54] the ingredients therefore to take the
[1:37:56] word of God you've got to take what all
[1:38:00] of the word of God not part of the word
[1:38:03] not the part you like that's what's
[1:38:05] wrong with the church the Baptist
[1:38:07] they've taken the part they
[1:38:09] like the Pentecostals have taken the
[1:38:12] part they
[1:38:17] like but if it's not all of
[1:38:22] it
[1:38:24] me say it again if it's not all of it
[1:38:27] it's not what
[1:38:34] original know people say no I believe I
[1:38:37] I I believe everything prophet of God
[1:38:39] said I'm not hybrid let me tell you
[1:38:41] something you leave out
[1:38:44] communion you're
[1:38:48] hybrid you've perverted the recipe all
[1:38:51] you people that are on this tape and in
[1:38:54] this church this church ought to be this
[1:38:57] fied on communion night you know why
[1:38:59] it's not you're hybrid and you don't
[1:39:02] know
[1:39:04] it you're not living the word of God and
[1:39:08] you don't know it you've come up with
[1:39:11] reasoning you've come up with excuses
[1:39:13] maybe you don't want to face communion
[1:39:16] and the Judgment that comes with
[1:39:17] communion but if you're not taking
[1:39:20] communion you will not God be
[1:39:27] there have your own hybrid
[1:39:33] religion try to get in on your own
[1:39:37] formula try to get in on your own
[1:39:40] reasoning and your own righteousness I
[1:39:43] have given you example that you do as I
[1:39:48] have
[1:39:49] done come up with your
[1:39:52] excuses
[1:39:54] I to call you on the
[1:39:56] phone on communion night instead of this
[1:39:59] is a pastor calling I just want you to
[1:40:01] know you're on your way to
[1:40:06] hell you can't say that I didn't say it
[1:40:10] Jesus said I will not judge you that's
[1:40:14] where everybody's at today oh Jesus
[1:40:16] won't judge you're right he come to save
[1:40:19] you but by rejecting his word youve
[1:40:23] rejected his
[1:40:26] salvation and he said he who Rejects My
[1:40:32] word will face
[1:40:38] judgment no foot washing
[1:40:46] hbd no Malachi
[1:40:50] 4:5 no Luke 17:30
[1:40:53] no Revelations
[1:40:56] 10:7 no Reverend Milt William Mariam
[1:40:59] Bram the seventh angel to the seventh
[1:41:01] Church age the prophet of Malachi
[1:41:06] 4:5
[1:41:09] hybrid you're not preaching the word of
[1:41:11] God for the hour you're not preaching
[1:41:14] the gospel for the day that it's in
[1:41:16] you're not preach the gospel for the
[1:41:18] season that it is you're preaching
[1:41:22] history
[1:41:24] and not the Living Word of God the
[1:41:27] Gospel of Jesus Christ who is the word
[1:41:32] amen so we
[1:41:35] hbrd by taking
[1:41:41] away now I'm obligate I'm not I'm just
[1:41:44] as guilty as
[1:41:45] anybody I'm not up here on AA
[1:41:50] horse I've already read that the words
[1:41:53] that I
[1:41:54] speak are going to meet me at the
[1:41:57] Judgment Day how many times did I st
[1:42:00] hear the prophet of God stand before
[1:42:01] with this Bible before me which will
[1:42:04] meet me on the Judgment Day the words
[1:42:07] that I tell you will meet me on the
[1:42:09] Judgment
[1:42:11] Day there I've always asked the Lord
[1:42:13] Lord I'm going to be judged for a lot of
[1:42:15] things but I don't want to be judged for
[1:42:18] not speaking the
[1:42:22] truth
[1:42:23] thank you so we don't want to we don't
[1:42:27] want
[1:42:28] to hybrid it mix
[1:42:33] it that's what we've got to get out of
[1:42:35] our
[1:42:36] Lives the mixing of Politics the mixing
[1:42:40] of the world the word of God will
[1:42:44] substain the
[1:42:46] elect I've never seen the righteous beg
[1:42:50] bread
[1:42:52] that's
[1:42:54] the word of
[1:42:56] God Will Supply every
[1:43:01] need to his elect
[1:43:04] lady we don't have to
[1:43:08] compromise to hi you can hybrid by
[1:43:11] taking away but what do we want to do we
[1:43:15] want to get back to what will take us
[1:43:21] back that's what we're trying to do
[1:43:23] we're trying to get back to what will
[1:43:26] take us back the only thing that will
[1:43:29] take us back
[1:43:32] is the word of
[1:43:36] God the word of God the
[1:43:39] importance of the word of God so there's
[1:43:44] got to
[1:43:45] be a
[1:43:48] solution because all of
[1:43:51] us are born
[1:43:55] hybrid did you know that I can prove it
[1:44:00] I'll pick somebody I don't always pick
[1:44:01] on I always pick on Beno no I might as
[1:44:03] well pick on Beno he's used to it you're
[1:44:08] hybrid you came into the world speaking
[1:44:13] lies you were born in sin shaped in
[1:44:19] iniquity how are you going to get out of
[1:44:21] that condition
[1:44:28] can you get yourself out of that
[1:44:30] condition no sir
[1:44:34] no CU there's no truth in you that's
[1:44:37] right you've got to be borned
[1:44:40] again something
[1:44:43] has to give you the birth may I say
[1:44:49] this and I'm sure everything I'm saying
[1:44:53] some intellectual will challenge me but
[1:44:55] you won't challenge what's in
[1:45:00] here you have to be born again for the
[1:45:03] age that you're born in that's
[1:45:09] right Noah's message won't
[1:45:14] work John the Baptist message won't work
[1:45:19] Moses's message won't work you've got to
[1:45:24] receive the birth that meets the
[1:45:27] challenge of the hour you've got to
[1:45:30] meets the birth of this age the birth of
[1:45:35] this age is the word of God for this age
[1:45:39] not another age not an age gone by but
[1:45:42] it's got to be the
[1:45:46] word for the
[1:45:50] age and it's got to be a spoken
[1:45:55] word an original
[1:45:58] word in that message that we read the
[1:46:01] meanest man I know he said Jesus
[1:46:04] preaching he might have said something
[1:46:06] like this he might have said see really
[1:46:09] your lives are
[1:46:11] hybrid the father said don't touch the
[1:46:14] tree but Satan said it won't hurt
[1:46:21] you
[1:46:24] don't touch the
[1:46:29] tree it won't hurt you you can fix it
[1:46:34] later you're
[1:46:36] predestinated your name's written on the
[1:46:38] Lamb's Book of
[1:46:42] Life you got to prove your name's
[1:46:44] written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:46:48] Life I can go down the street all I want
[1:46:51] say I'm 71 and I play for the LA
[1:46:57] Lakers you're going to look at me and
[1:47:00] say you're 5'6 and you're not
[1:47:02] coordinated enough to play for
[1:47:05] anybody my actions are speaking what
[1:47:09] louder than my words I can make the
[1:47:13] Declaration we got everybody making
[1:47:16] declarations we're the bride of Christ
[1:47:18] well if you're the bride of Christ
[1:47:20] you're married to them you're in a Union
[1:47:23] with them you're in a fellowship with
[1:47:25] them and you're producing his seed his
[1:47:29] right his his children are his
[1:47:34] attributes Christ Living in you Christ
[1:47:38] in
[1:47:39] you the hope of glory if the Same Spirit
[1:47:43] be in you that was in Christ Jesus it
[1:47:47] shall Quicken your mortal bodies your
[1:47:49] doctrine's not going to Quicken you your
[1:47:51] associations not going to Quicken you
[1:47:54] your your your voice isn't going to
[1:47:58] Quicken
[1:47:59] you it's the Born Again life is the only
[1:48:05] thing that can Quicken you you must be
[1:48:07] born again and you must be
[1:48:11] born by the word of God after seven
[1:48:17] ages of
[1:48:20] deception and four horse riders
[1:48:25] God finally has a
[1:48:29] voice that can birth the
[1:48:32] church and this is what he said Jesus
[1:48:35] might have said now in order to get back
[1:48:38] to the original God has to speak again
[1:48:45] that's what he
[1:48:46] does when he gives you New Birth what
[1:48:53] does God have to do before you can get
[1:48:56] new birth is not bring you to a
[1:48:59] remembrance of what took place on
[1:49:02] Pentecost but in order to get a new
[1:49:05] birth he has to speak again that's what
[1:49:09] he does when he gives you the new
[1:49:12] birth your old life is gone and you're
[1:49:16] back to the original word of the Lord
[1:49:20] the only thing that can k give you
[1:49:23] what's original is what's original right
[1:49:28] cuz anything that mixed what dies that's
[1:49:34] right is that right can't breed itself
[1:49:37] again let's just read this before we
[1:49:39] play our our
[1:49:41] message and then you'll see I could have
[1:49:43] just played the message and not spoke
[1:49:45] but I spoke for
[1:49:47] myself he says you're back to the
[1:49:50] original word if you're not not your
[1:49:54] hybrid into Church's
[1:49:57] denomination but when God
[1:50:00] speaks his
[1:50:02] peace and the Holy Spirit then you're
[1:50:06] back in the original family of God again
[1:50:09] when God does what
[1:50:13] speaks let me tell you there's a great
[1:50:16] deception in the land
[1:50:19] today and it's a new birth with out the
[1:50:27] voice I don't care how spiritual they
[1:50:29] are to say I'll Stand Here on God's word
[1:50:32] you cannot be born again in this day
[1:50:36] because Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:50:38] hearing by the word of God and every
[1:50:41] other voice except for the voice of
[1:50:43] Malachi 45 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7
[1:50:48] under the anointing of the prophet of
[1:50:51] Malachi 4:5 William Mary and brandom is
[1:50:56] hybrid and it produces death now if
[1:51:00] that's too big of a reproach for
[1:51:05] you many are
[1:51:08] called and few are
[1:51:10] chosen every Revival produces twins it's
[1:51:15] always cut in half it always has been
[1:51:19] and it always will
[1:51:21] be isn't that
[1:51:24] right
[1:51:26] two Adam and
[1:51:29] Eve Eve was the first
[1:51:33] hybrid it mixed their first and from
[1:51:37] that mixture you're all born in sin
[1:51:39] shape and iniquity come into the world
[1:51:41] speaking lies and you all
[1:51:44] die the only thing that cannot separate
[1:51:48] you from death is a spoken
[1:51:51] word that's I am the resurrection the
[1:51:54] life the truth no man cometh unto the
[1:51:57] father but by me Adam and Eve Abel and
[1:52:03] Cain Joshua and E Jacob and Esau Moses
[1:52:07] daythan and cor David and Saul John the
[1:52:10] Baptist Herod Jesus and Judas five
[1:52:15] wise five
[1:52:19] foolish you must have
[1:52:23] that he said but when God speaks his
[1:52:28] peace and His holy spirit he speaks his
[1:52:32] holy spirit into you by the word that's
[1:52:37] right you say well how did they get the
[1:52:39] thing in the upper
[1:52:42] room they did what he
[1:52:45] said go there and carry
[1:52:51] amen
[1:52:53] until you receive power from un
[1:52:56] High I will not leave you comfortless
[1:52:59] but I personal pronoun the word will
[1:53:03] come to
[1:53:04] you and be with
[1:53:07] you and in
[1:53:10] you and lead and guide you into all
[1:53:14] truth and righteousness for this Spirit
[1:53:17] shall not speak of himself but he shall
[1:53:20] bring you into remembrance of everything
[1:53:24] that I
[1:53:27] said
[1:53:29] Hallelujah aren't you glad you don't
[1:53:31] have to rely on your flesh aren't you
[1:53:34] glad you don't have to Rite any emotion
[1:53:36] aren't you glad you can take him at his
[1:53:38] word and it settles
[1:53:41] it
[1:53:44] amen he said and you're back in the
[1:53:46] original family of God again you don't
[1:53:49] have to be baby
[1:53:51] then
[1:53:55] you're a rugged
[1:53:56] Christian who can stand it you know
[1:54:00] sometimes we have to stand our own
[1:54:03] failures our own
[1:54:05] angers our own
[1:54:09] weaknesses I've stumbled at things in my
[1:54:12] life for years and years and
[1:54:18] years but where else could I
[1:54:21] go th alone has the words of eternal
[1:54:24] life I wanted to give up but I
[1:54:27] couldn't I couldn't
[1:54:29] overcome and I couldn't give
[1:54:32] up all they could do is just sit there
[1:54:35] and cry and plead and
[1:54:39] ask one
[1:54:41] day he
[1:54:46] spoke and I accepted
[1:54:49] it and I could walk away not by power
[1:54:53] not by might but my by my spirit sayith
[1:54:57] the
[1:54:58] Lord whatever it may be because the word
[1:55:02] of the Living God is burning in your
[1:55:05] heart and soul what's burning in your
[1:55:08] heart and soul an
[1:55:10] anointing a
[1:55:12] rain what's burning in your heart the
[1:55:15] word of the Living
[1:55:19] God that's what leads you
[1:55:23] there is no such thing as the leadership
[1:55:25] of the Holy Spirit outside of the word
[1:55:29] of
[1:55:34] God no such
[1:55:36] thing it is the Holy Spirit the holy
[1:55:40] spirit will not deny his
[1:55:43] word burning in your heart and all can
[1:55:48] backslide and can turn against you and
[1:55:51] everything else
[1:55:53] but that won't stop one thing that
[1:55:56] rugged word of God stays right there
[1:56:01] when he spoke that original voice into
[1:56:07] your heart you are
[1:56:14] mine let's go now for 14
[1:56:20] minutes and I wanted to lay enough
[1:56:24] background so you won't
[1:56:26] miss this next 14
[1:56:30] minutes the original is the only thing
[1:56:34] that will produce the original we've got
[1:56:37] to get back to what will get us
[1:56:43] back let's just listen I I think you'll
[1:56:47] be blessed he goes very slow and that if
[1:56:51] if we went this far in this book
[1:56:56] today we we would oh I wanted to read
[1:57:00] this's sorry I I skipped this but I'm
[1:57:02] going to read this once again about
[1:57:04] meeting the challenge of the hour if the
[1:57:07] brothers would get
[1:57:19] ready oh oh man here we are blessed be
[1:57:24] the Lord now we come to the body to be
[1:57:28] the bride of Christ and now to be his
[1:57:32] flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[1:57:35] bone right that's what we've all want to
[1:57:38] do we want to go in the Rapture he is
[1:57:41] the resurrection we about to be a part
[1:57:43] of him to be flesh of his flesh and bone
[1:57:46] of his
[1:57:47] bone and now we'll hurry up now flesh of
[1:57:50] his flesh and bone of his bone why
[1:57:53] didn't ask you a question why didn't all
[1:57:57] your reins back Yonder bring the bride
[1:58:01] to
[1:58:05] Christ I want you to answer
[1:58:10] that if it's outcoming and it's overdue
[1:58:14] we believe it like it was in the days of
[1:58:17] Noah
[1:58:19] longsuffering he's getting his bride re
[1:58:21] ready
[1:58:23] why didn't these rains why didn't you
[1:58:26] Pentecostals back Yonder a few years ago
[1:58:30] when you started 40 or 50 years ago why
[1:58:33] didn't you bring Christ the bridegroom
[1:58:38] to the
[1:58:43] bride I'm going to let that soak in a
[1:58:46] minute why because you pregnated
[1:58:49] yourselves with your denomination
[1:58:53] that's exactly what you've done he won't
[1:58:56] marry a he'll marry a virgin it's
[1:59:00] flat but that's the truth you know it in
[1:59:04] a flat way you don't have to wonder I
[1:59:08] don't stumble around about it I tell you
[1:59:11] the truth why didn't you bring her why
[1:59:16] didn't you bring
[1:59:20] Christ Christ bring Christ to her
[1:59:23] because she's not
[1:59:27] fit he found her in
[1:59:30] adultery exactly the reason children
[1:59:33] don't live
[1:59:34] forever when they're born Adam found his
[1:59:38] wife
[1:59:39] pregnated that's the reason Jehovah had
[1:59:43] to take a gentile Brown bride found her
[1:59:46] pregnated that's exactly the way Christ
[1:59:51] has to get him a bride now he found this
[1:59:55] so-called group pregnated he's going to
[1:59:58] seow his seed somebody's going to get it
[2:00:02] because they're predestinated to be a
[2:00:05] church on the end time Road what does he
[2:00:09] have to do he's got to sew his seed may
[2:00:15] you enjoy the next 14 minutes God bless
[2:00:20] you now that's why we believe it and it
[2:00:24] is the word of God therefore
[2:00:28] God's spoken
[2:00:31] word is
[2:00:35] original and everything that God
[2:00:39] created spoke into existence is
[2:00:43] original and you can hbed some of his
[2:00:46] creation secondarily that's the reason
[2:00:49] Eve could do what she did
[2:00:53] with her own
[2:00:55] seed because she wasn't in the original
[2:01:00] creation amen she's a
[2:01:03] byproduct of the man not in the creation
[2:01:06] of God God created a whole things and
[2:01:08] then he took a part of his creation and
[2:01:10] made a
[2:01:11] helpmate that's the reason you can H bre
[2:01:14] a donkey and a
[2:01:16] horse but it won't
[2:01:19] last it's
[2:01:20] death but the original has got life it
[2:01:24] comes back again I hope you can see it
[2:01:28] now the original has a
[2:01:31] life so that's the reason I think it
[2:01:33] Cults and denominations and
[2:01:35] organizations
[2:01:37] die history proves are everyone dead and
[2:01:40] never did rise no more and never
[2:01:43] will they can't breed themselves back
[2:01:46] got nothing to breed with they're
[2:01:50] sterile that's why e children
[2:01:56] dies I'm taking my time so the tapes
[2:02:00] give people time to
[2:02:03] study I don't want to be in any hurry
[2:02:05] amen amen I want to just take my
[2:02:09] time I don't know what'll happen from
[2:02:11] here
[2:02:13] on but I I want this to the people that
[2:02:17] even though someday God take me from the
[2:02:20] world if I don't live to see is coming
[2:02:24] the message will still live
[2:02:26] on
[2:02:29] Tru stay with the word now remember
[2:02:33] every spoken word of God is the Original
[2:02:38] Seed God planted everything in the Earth
[2:02:42] by his
[2:02:43] word and as long as you stay with the
[2:02:46] Original Seed it will breed itself right
[2:02:49] back and and reproduce itself again
[2:02:52] hybrid it it
[2:02:54] dies and Eve the woman was the first
[2:02:58] hybrid thing that ever
[2:03:01] was I I hope you don't turn tapes off
[2:03:04] till we get out and prove that after a
[2:03:06] while see show you just
[2:03:08] why she was a h
[2:03:11] breeder a
[2:03:14] bride
[2:03:16] notice through that brought death
[2:03:19] through trying to take the word of God
[2:03:22] and mix some wisdom with
[2:03:25] it you're not supposed to do that
[2:03:28] whether you believe got wisdom to
[2:03:30] explain it just say God said it and that
[2:03:33] setts it and God said so and that's all
[2:03:36] there is to it if you can't explain it
[2:03:37] leave it alone but just say it's so
[2:03:40] because God said so that's God said it
[2:03:43] now notice now it will not mix it must
[2:03:49] not be tampered with God will punish the
[2:03:51] one that do it and it will not HB to
[2:03:54] nothing else it's God's word alone God
[2:03:56] don't need your word with his we're not
[2:03:59] supposed to speak our own word we're
[2:04:02] supposed to preach his
[2:04:07] word God's
[2:04:10] word now therefore true life can only
[2:04:15] come or reproduce
[2:04:20] itself by its original
[2:04:25] breeding see life I keep now study that
[2:04:28] now when you're studying the tapes and
[2:04:30] study it now
[2:04:32] life l i f can only be reproduced by its
[2:04:38] original
[2:04:41] breeding the way it started at the
[2:04:45] beginning then it reproduces
[2:04:48] itself it doesn't it's a hybrid it runs
[2:04:51] out
[2:04:52] some of them run out in the first
[2:04:54] generation see it's gone right then
[2:04:56] it'll soon find itself
[2:04:58] back it can't bring correct life because
[2:05:01] it's hybrid Genesis 1:1 the Bible said
[2:05:07] Jes God said let every seed bring forth
[2:05:10] of its
[2:05:12] kind now when God said that that settles
[2:05:16] it it's always settled let every seed
[2:05:19] bring forth of its kind to mix it brings
[2:05:23] a super
[2:05:25] crop it's a super crop of
[2:05:28] what listen
[2:05:31] now that's
[2:05:33] Coast to mix
[2:05:35] it I'm trying to hold and such text I
[2:05:38] could preach on it but I'm trying to
[2:05:41] keep from doing
[2:05:42] that to mix
[2:05:44] it will bring forth a super crop as is
[2:05:48] proven but what kind of a crop a crop of
[2:05:54] falsehood
[2:05:58] death H breed your corn it brings forth
[2:06:01] a big crop better crop better looking
[2:06:05] but it's
[2:06:06] dead PL it back can't reproduce itself
[2:06:08] again it's done it's
[2:06:12] finished like
[2:06:14] Eve see she brought forth a hybrid
[2:06:19] crop look at us today and you can look
[2:06:21] look around and see that's
[2:06:23] true sure did it wasn't God's
[2:06:26] purpose no sir just have to hold back
[2:06:29] for something I'm thinking right now see
[2:06:31] to mix it brings forth a hybrid
[2:06:34] crop and a hybrid crop is a dead
[2:06:38] crop forse
[2:06:40] rebreeding it won't rebreed itself it
[2:06:43] can because God said so it has to bring
[2:06:46] forth of its kind and you've mixed it
[2:06:48] now you can see the church right there
[2:06:50] where we're we're wind up
[2:06:53] it dies there for it cannot bring forth
[2:06:56] of its
[2:06:58] kind why it's
[2:07:02] mixed you can't do nothing with it it's
[2:07:04] dead it's finished all right that's why
[2:07:08] each generation has its own
[2:07:13] Revival a chance at the
[2:07:18] word so The Sovereign God Amen amen
[2:07:22] that's the
[2:07:24] Judgment John Wesley's group are raise
[2:07:28] up and these starw methodists of the
[2:07:31] day will answer
[2:07:34] for Luther will raise
[2:07:37] up the Catholics will raise
[2:07:40] up from back behind
[2:07:43] irenius Martin
[2:07:46] polycarp and
[2:07:48] those I don't have to stand the J
[2:07:51] judgement for Hing the word of God to
[2:07:55] dogmas this group of Lutheran that
[2:07:58] followed Lutheran's Revival will answer
[2:08:00] the same thing the group of Baptists the
[2:08:03] follow John Smith's Revival will do the
[2:08:06] same thing Alexander Campbell will do
[2:08:08] the same thing and the Pentecostals will
[2:08:11] do the same
[2:08:12] thing that original Revival when the
[2:08:15] Holy Ghost fell called out a people and
[2:08:18] God trying to get his word to it and
[2:08:20] they organized instead of over here and
[2:08:22] denominated and died right
[2:08:26] there you say but look what they're
[2:08:28] doing we'll get to that little later on
[2:08:29] today we're coming right down to all the
[2:08:32] I'm just putting the seed in now now
[2:08:33] we're going to show after a while what
[2:08:36] happened now that's why each Revival has
[2:08:41] its own Revival each
[2:08:43] generation has its Revival God raises
[2:08:47] him up a man sets him with his word and
[2:08:49] starts him out for the message for that
[2:08:51] that age and as soon as that man's taken
[2:08:54] off the scene somebody else catches it
[2:08:55] and H breeds it it all falls back to a
[2:08:59] perfect everything may I can stop here
[2:09:02] for a minute we ain't no hurry no see go
[2:09:05] back that's exactly what it started away
[2:09:07] in the beginning in Genesis God set
[2:09:10] forth his crop of human
[2:09:13] race and Eve hybred it see what
[2:09:17] happened so there's a judgment for Eve
[2:09:21] Luther set forth all the rest Christ set
[2:09:24] forth the apostles set forth the
[2:09:28] prophets set forth didn't Jesus say
[2:09:30] which one of you has not your fathers
[2:09:33] persecuted the
[2:09:35] prophets God saying didn't he teach that
[2:09:38] a king one time sent a servant and then
[2:09:40] sent another servant and sent another
[2:09:41] servant and so forth then finally sent
[2:09:43] his
[2:09:44] son see each generation receiving C it's
[2:09:48] repeating right back to e e Adam and Eve
[2:09:50] again the first
[2:09:52] the Garden of Eden half of them lost
[2:09:54] wise virgin sleeping virgin half of one
[2:09:56] kept the word other hyb it right back
[2:09:59] and forth just as hard as it can go
[2:10:01] right like it's been right down through
[2:10:02] the age we'll prove it by God's word and
[2:10:04] by the history here that's right High
[2:10:07] breeding High breeding first started in
[2:10:11] Eden started in Genesis it's a beginning
[2:10:14] that's where it ends up over here in
[2:10:16] Revelations that's the second coming of
[2:10:19] Christ I remember correctly that's why
[2:10:22] each generation has its own Revival it
[2:10:25] gets a chance at the word then they hre
[2:10:29] instead of taking on they door somewhere
[2:10:31] else my
[2:10:34] mission and I believe that God has
[2:10:36] called me far I I have to say some
[2:10:39] personal things today because that's
[2:10:41] what I told you I do
[2:10:44] Amen to tell the
[2:10:46] world my mission I believe to the Earth
[2:10:50] is what
[2:10:51] is to forerun the coming
[2:10:56] word the coming word which is
[2:11:00] Christ and Christ in him has a
[2:11:02] millennium and has everything right
[2:11:04] there because he is the
[2:11:06] word all right Jesus said in John
[2:11:12] 3:5 now if you want to mark that down
[2:11:15] John 3:5 we all know it or either I'll
[2:11:17] turn and maybe somebody on the tapes
[2:11:20] would might not be able to turn just at
[2:11:22] that time and I'll read here uh in St
[2:11:25] John the 3r chapter and the fifth
[2:11:33] verse and we'll see what Jesus
[2:11:36] said we might start off just a little
[2:11:39] before that third Jesus answered and
[2:11:42] said unto him verely verely I say unto
[2:11:45] thee except the man be born
[2:11:48] again he cannot see the kingdom of God
[2:11:52] gone Nicodemus said unto him how can a
[2:11:55] man be born when he is old can he enter
[2:11:58] the second time into his mother's womb
[2:12:00] and be born Jesus answered verily I say
[2:12:03] unto you and to thee except a man be
[2:12:07] born of water and of spirit he cannot
[2:12:11] enter into the kingdom of God is that a
[2:12:15] seed every spoken word of God is a seed
[2:12:19] that's right I'm going to prove that
[2:12:20] just minut where Jesus said so every
[2:12:23] spoken word of God is a seed then except
[2:12:25] a man be born again why must he be born
[2:12:28] again he's dead with the fashion he's in
[2:12:31] he's a
[2:12:33] h he's got to be born again why he was
[2:12:36] born in Sin from Eve sin shaped in
[2:12:40] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[2:12:42] he's a liar to begin with no matter how
[2:12:45] smart educated what more he is he's a
[2:12:47] liar the Bible says he is how holy his
[2:12:50] parents was or anything about he's a
[2:12:52] liar to begin with and the only way he
[2:12:55] can tell truth is say what truth is to
[2:12:57] his own lips that's the only way truth
[2:12:58] can come anything contrary to that word
[2:13:01] he's a liar
[2:13:04] yet that's pretty flat but that's what
[2:13:07] God
[2:13:08] Said let every man's word be a lie and
[2:13:11] mine be true amen see anything that
[2:13:13] comes from his lips contrary to deny
[2:13:16] this word or put it in some other race
[2:13:18] or some other generation or whatever it
[2:13:20] is he he's a
[2:13:22] liar it's exactly he's got to be born
[2:13:25] again then he sees every word the only
[2:13:27] way he can be born again is that life of
[2:13:29] God in to produce
[2:13:45] that it's the tape is 6 hours from 45
[2:13:48] minutes long and now was just 14 minutes
[2:13:53] you see the
[2:13:55] importance that hybrid started and
[2:13:58] what's it still trying to do and Satan
[2:14:02] appears as an angel of what light mixing
[2:14:07] mixing mixing
[2:14:09] mixing but God raised up an angel with
[2:14:13] the true word of God and
[2:14:16] every
[2:14:18] generation gets a chance to hear the
[2:14:21] word of
[2:14:23] God don't miss your
[2:14:27] chance the only thing that can breed you
[2:14:33] back is the
[2:14:36] original the original doesn't mix God
[2:14:40] doesn't need anything but his word amen
[2:14:45] so we we we we we now I
[2:14:50] believe
[2:14:52] have a a greater understanding of the
[2:14:57] battle that we're
[2:14:59] in we have the whole world preaching
[2:15:03] their
[2:15:04] righteousness their idea their system
[2:15:09] their way of doing things what they
[2:15:12] think is
[2:15:14] important and yet there's one little
[2:15:17] small true
[2:15:19] voice in a little
[2:15:23] man of no seemingly reputation of no
[2:15:27] background not born of a system not born
[2:15:31] of an organization but called by God
[2:15:35] meant by an Angel of the lord caught up
[2:15:39] into the third
[2:15:40] heaven to receive the
[2:15:43] Mysteries and things that have been kept
[2:15:47] secret for all
[2:15:49] generations and break The Word of Life
[2:15:52] to you this
[2:15:54] morning let's not let this word become
[2:15:58] common it's our
[2:16:01] life it's our life this morning live by

[2:16:22] so you have some place to Anchor your
[2:16:26] faith and I we could stay on these
[2:16:30] things for a long time but what's our
[2:16:33] strength this morning the word of God

[2:16:58] heart uh Peter said let me stir up your
[2:17:02] pure Minds by way of remembrance that
[2:17:05] you might add these great virtues to
[2:17:09] your life that you might stand in the
[2:17:11] Statue of a perfect man we don't want to
[2:17:14] miss the Rapture the Rapture is
[2:17:16] everything to us this morning let's bow
[2:17:19] our heads in prayer
[2:17:25] maybe we'd ask you this
[2:17:27] morning I ask
[2:17:31] myself Brother David is
[2:17:34] there things in your life that are mixed
[2:17:37] in
[2:17:40] there even worse are there things that
[2:17:44] I've been calling the word of
[2:17:46] God which aren't the word of
[2:17:49] God
[2:17:54] Lord I I we all need uh
[2:17:59] purification the scripture says to
[2:18:01] purify Our Hearts by the washing of the
[2:18:06] water of the
[2:18:08] word father and I just pray that we
[2:18:11] would all understand here this
[2:18:16] morning that you said my sheep hear my
[2:18:19] voice and another they won't
[2:18:24] follow Lord we're confident in
[2:18:28] that and we are asking this morning that
[2:18:32] the deception of this
[2:18:34] hour is the
[2:18:37] mixing of civilization education and
[2:18:42] science trying to mix it with the pure
[2:18:45] word of God and produce something
[2:18:47] that'll make a
[2:18:49] Rapture and Lord we know it
[2:18:52] won't only the
[2:18:55] original can breed life back
[2:18:59] again and father you've given us a
[2:19:02] chance to hear that
[2:19:05] voice to be born
[2:19:09] again to take this isav of your
[2:19:14] word to take gold tried in Fire and
[2:19:17] white

[2:19:22] ready for the wedding
[2:19:25] supper Lord I just pray that each of us
[2:19:28] in our own hearts and in our own minds
[2:19:31] and in our own
[2:19:32] lives will'll do a
[2:19:39] self-examination will we ask
[2:19:42] ourselves Am I Living For That
[2:19:46] Rapture am I trying to
[2:19:49] make
[2:19:51] full proof of my
[2:19:55] salvation or am I just kind of in the
[2:19:58] middle of the road am I just kind of
[2:20:03] lukewarm Lord you told us that if we're
[2:20:05] lukewarm you'll spill us out of your
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:11] mouth Lord we want to turn our
[2:20:15] hearts to sincere
[2:20:18] dedication we're not ashamed of the
[2:20:21] gospel of this
[2:20:22] hour because it's life and Liberty and
[2:20:26] salvation in Christ
[2:20:28] Jesus and it'll do everything that it
[2:20:31] said it would
[2:20:34] do father if there's one needy of your
[2:20:37] spirit this
[2:20:39] morning they' like to lift their hands
[2:20:42] as my hand is lifted and my head is
[2:20:46] Bow and say Lord I need your
[2:20:49] word to come Purify Me I need your word
[2:20:54] to separate things out of my life that I
[2:20:57] know are were not Rapture
[2:21:02] worthy Lord we don't need a emotional
[2:21:06] outpouring in this
[2:21:09] building or we don't need to have it
[2:21:12] happen here for it to be
[2:21:14] real we want it to happen in the Realms
[2:21:18] of our life
[2:21:21] we want to see it Blossom forth in the
[2:21:24] life that we're
[2:21:25] living resurrection and truth and true
[2:21:29] word living out of us Lord we preached
[2:21:33] the gospel this morning we've backed up
[2:21:36] every word we've said with the words of
[2:21:39] the messengers in the scriptures father
[2:21:42] it's been established in the mouth of
[2:21:44] two or three witnesses that Satan's
[2:21:47] deception is hybriding and the only
[2:21:50] that'll bring us back to the original is
[2:21:53] the
[2:21:54] original the only thing that can breed
[2:21:57] life is the original
[2:21:59] word and in this day the Revival of this
[2:22:04] day and the voice of this day is the
[2:22:07] message of the hour to bring Rapture to
[2:22:11] his
[2:22:12] bride May that burn in our heart may we
[2:22:16] believe it may we trust it may we hear
