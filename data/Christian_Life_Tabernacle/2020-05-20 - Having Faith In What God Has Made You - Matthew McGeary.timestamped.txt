[38:36] that his Holy Spirit would be our
[38:39] portion this evening amen amen it's just
[38:44] good to be in his presence I mean let's
[38:48] just go before him in prayer Heavenly
[38:50] Father how we love you Lord and we just
[38:57] approach you at this portion of the
[38:59] service we're thanking you for your
[39:02] grace and your mercy that you have shown
[39:04] unto us Lord knowing if it wasn't for
[39:07] that many of us wouldn't be here but
[39:10] we'd be maybe just a number or statistic
[39:14] maybe be incarcerated or just out in
[39:17] some denominational some worldly
[39:19] situation but Lord your great love we're
[39:24] in we you loved us Lord you've called
[39:27] out to us Lord and you've drawn us out
[39:30] from the things of the world Lord and
[39:31] you've shown us your wonderful truth and
[39:35] you've transformed our lives Lord and
[39:37] you've given us quickening power or that
[39:40] we could live an overcoming life Lord
[39:42] and it's been the greatest joy that I
[39:43] believe we could all testify is knowing
[39:46] you Lord truly Lord there's nothing that
[39:50] this world could ever offer that could
[39:52] even come close to the joy of knowing
[39:54] you we just pray that this little
[39:57] service now that you would just receive
[39:59] the glory or it may you bless the
[40:02] reading of your word bless the word as
[40:04] it would go forth Lord and we ask that
[40:06] you would break the bread of life as
[40:08] only you can do we just surrender
[40:10] ourselves to you now
[40:11] your precious name the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:13] we pray a man
[40:15] praise the Lord if you have your Bibles
[40:18] will be reading maybe we'll just read
[40:23] Zechariah 4 7
[40:49] the scripture just came on my heart as I
[40:51] was on the way to service and so I I
[40:55] just feel to read it I'm not sure we'll
[40:57] get to maybe the the types and the
[41:02] prophecy in this scripture but zechariah
[41:04] 4 7 through 10
[41:05] it reads who art Thou O great mountain
[41:09] before zerubabbel thou shalt become a
[41:12] plane and he shall bring forth the
[41:15] headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[41:18] grace grace unto it moreover the word of
[41:22] the Lord came unto me saying the hands
[41:25] of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation
[41:27] of this house his hands to also finish
[41:30] it and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[41:32] Hosts hath sent me unto you for who hath
[41:36] despised the day of small things for
[41:40] they shall rejoice and shall see the
[41:42] plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with
[41:44] those seven they are the eyes of the
[41:47] Lord which run to and fro through the
[41:50] whole earth a man you may be seated and
[41:53] just what struck me just as I was
[41:57] thinking of the scripture that came on
[41:59] my heart as it says that and he shall
[42:04] bring forth the headstone thereof with
[42:06] shoutings crying grace grace unto it and
[42:10] we have received a message of grace we
[42:14] believe we have received our headship
[42:16] Christ the word has come to the bride
[42:18] and this last days and it cried grace
[42:21] grace it's not something that we have
[42:24] done it is it is a message of grace that
[42:28] men have trampled it underfoot as the
[42:32] Prophet would say and have made it a
[42:33] disgrace it's not by your works it's not
[42:36] by anything that you can do but it is
[42:39] truly a message of grace it's something
[42:42] that he has done and as we maybe just
[42:44] move forward in this message tonight
[42:46] that's really maybe an underlining
[42:49] thought it's something that God is doing
[42:51] in you it's something that God is doing
[42:53] through you it's something that God has
[42:55] spoken of you and really our place or
[42:58] our position in the whole process is
[43:01] believing what he said
[43:02] that that's what we do we're believers
[43:05] and so maybe tonight we just want to
[43:08] encourage you because you know the
[43:10] scripture says there it says who has
[43:12] despised the days of small things of the
[43:15] Prophet would pick that up in the breech
[43:17] and he would say simple things and he
[43:19] would say who has despised the day of
[43:21] simple things as he has opened up of
[43:23] this series of sermons preached in the
[43:26] seven seals he opens it up with
[43:27] preaching God hidden in simplicity and
[43:30] revealing in the same and he takes the
[43:32] rouble for it says the this day of small
[43:35] things is the day of simple things and I
[43:38] just want maybe for us to really focus
[43:40] on our personal lives and and on our
[43:43] congregation in our church and what God
[43:46] is doing in our assembly in our lives in
[43:49] our family what we might call simple it
[43:53] might be the day of simple things but
[43:55] this is this is where the whole
[43:57] climactic accomplishment that God wanted
[44:01] to accomplish down through time is in
[44:03] your life right now look the Prophet is
[44:06] common in and has brought us the message
[44:09] and he has introduced us to Jesus Christ
[44:11] and now we are in a union with Christ
[44:14] and we're in this journey and so now
[44:17] it's it's our part to play we have a
[44:20] part to do now and I think it's so easy
[44:22] for us to to in this lady you'll see an
[44:25] age just to get caught up in life you
[44:28] know and and we start to if we're not
[44:30] careful we start to despise the day of
[44:33] small things and the day of simple
[44:35] things as we go through the our daily
[44:38] routine and everything so as we would
[44:40] just bring the word forth we we want to
[44:43] just apply that personally to our life
[44:46] we'll be reading out of Mark 917 now and
[44:53] we're thankful that our pastor had a
[44:55] successful procedure we're certainly
[45:00] anxious for a quick quick return
[45:15] mark 9 17 through 24 says in one of the
[45:22] multitude answered and said master I
[45:24] have brought unto thee my son which hath
[45:28] a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh
[45:31] him he tarath him any FOMA 'the and
[45:34] nash's with his teeth and pine it away
[45:36] and i spake with the disciples that they
[45:39] should cast him out and they could not
[45:41] he answered him and saith a faithless
[45:45] generation how long shall I be with you
[45:48] how long shall I suffer you bring him
[45:51] unto me and they brought him unto him
[45:54] and when he saw him straightway the
[45:57] spirit tear him and he fell on the
[46:00] ground and wallowed foaming and he asked
[46:03] his father and he asked his father how
[46:05] long is it ago since this came unto Him
[46:09] and he said of a child and often times
[46:13] that have cast him into the fire and
[46:14] into the waters to destroy him but if
[46:17] thou canst do anything have compassion
[46:20] on us and help us and Jesus said unto
[46:25] Him now notice he's he's he's put he's
[46:29] putting something back on this man if
[46:32] thou canst believe all things are
[46:36] possible to him that believeth and
[46:40] straightway the father of the child
[46:43] cried out and said with tears lord I
[46:47] believe help thou my unbelief and the
[46:52] Prophet says in perfect faith he says
[46:55] the disciples had power Jesus gave them
[46:57] power to heal all manner of sickness to
[46:59] cast out devils to cleanse the lepers to
[47:02] raise the dead he gave them power but
[47:05] they didn't have faith to operate the
[47:06] power that they had and then they
[47:10] questioned Jesus and said well now why
[47:13] couldn't we do it now remember they had
[47:18] the word and the word was flesh then and
[47:20] the word told them I give you power amen
[47:23] give you power and they had the power
[47:26] but they didn't have faith to operate
[47:29] the word that was in them my say brother
[47:33] Matthew this isn't sounding encouraging
[47:35] so far we'll just stay with it see what
[47:40] I mean but Jesus had it he was the word
[47:44] and he had faith that what he said would
[47:48] happen he said oh bring him here how
[47:52] long will I suffer you he had faith with
[47:55] his power how did he he said I can do
[47:58] nothing in myself why he relied upon
[48:00] what he was he relied on knowing what he
[48:05] was the word and he had faith in God who
[48:08] made him the word he was God the word
[48:11] and it was in him and that give him
[48:14] faith because he understood his position
[48:17] he knowed what he was because the
[48:20] Scriptures had said he was this and here
[48:24] every scripture tied in to prove that he
[48:26] was exactly what the scripture said he
[48:29] would be and he knew what he was
[48:31] therefore he relied upon what God had
[48:34] made him and if he did that then can't
[48:39] we rely upon what God made us as
[48:43] believers is there anybody in here that
[48:47] can testify that God has made you a
[48:49] believer many times we come to
[48:52] situations and we come to things in her
[48:54] life and there's only one thing we know
[48:56] to do and that's belief we don't we
[48:59] can't figure it out we can't add it all
[49:02] up we can't try to offset this scripture
[49:06] or balance it all out the roles we could
[49:07] say Lord is I believe your word I
[49:09] believe Lord you said we're believers he
[49:12] said these signs shall follow them that
[49:14] believe he had faith in what he was and
[49:17] if you are a believer you have faith in
[49:21] what you are you are a believer and if
[49:26] you've got faith in God the Bible says
[49:28] over here if our hearts condemn us then
[49:31] we can't have faith but if our hearts
[49:34] don't condemn us then we have faith
[49:37] we have confidence towards God but as
[49:40] long as you're doing things that's wrong
[49:42] you can't have confidence towards God
[49:45] so you'll automatically know that you're
[49:50] wrong you automatically put yourself
[49:52] back there a sinner by knowing that
[49:56] you're wrong but when your heart don't
[49:58] condemn you and you know you are a
[50:01] believer and there's nothing between you
[50:04] and God and you can ask what you will
[50:08] and know it'll be given because it's the
[50:10] word that's given to you just like to
[50:14] those disciples now the only thing you
[50:17] have to do then is have faith in what
[50:20] you are have faith in what the word says
[50:27] you are and I just pray that as the word
[50:31] would go forth tonight that maybe as
[50:34] believers we can just set our wings to
[50:36] the winds of faith and that as the word
[50:39] would go forth that we could just start
[50:40] to rise into the heavenlies and we can
[50:43] start to soar in heavenly places in
[50:46] Christ Jesus because you are a believer
[50:48] you are an eagle and that's what you
[50:51] were born for you are predestinated to
[50:54] soar in the realms where all things are
[50:57] possible to them that believe and so we
[51:00] just want to start believing in what God
[51:02] has told us we want to believe in what
[51:05] we are we are believers and I know that
[51:08] we've been immodest and maybe we have
[51:10] heard for year upon year upon year of
[51:12] love that we're the bride of Jesus
[51:14] Christ and and we're without spot and
[51:16] without wrinkle but I think maybe that
[51:19] if that needs to be mixed with a little
[51:21] faith tonight that we actually start
[51:23] believing what he said about us that we
[51:26] are that 90 army that we are that bride
[51:28] and we start to believe in who we are
[51:30] that we can do the greater works that
[51:32] you can lay hands on the sick and they
[51:34] shall recover that you can stand upon
[51:37] the promises of God that if you see
[51:39] somebody that's been bound by a spirit
[51:41] that you have a right according to the
[51:43] Word of God to take God at His Word that
[51:46] to say to this mountain be plucked up
[51:48] and go over here that's that's what
[51:50] you've been called to that's who you are
[51:52] this is the office that goddess chose to
[51:55] manifest himself in in this day is you
[51:57] the bride he only has hands as you yield
[52:00] your hands he only has a mouth as you
[52:02] yield your mouth oh you're the final
[52:05] voice in this generation and and now by
[52:07] the word we want to start having faith
[52:09] in what God has made us but I believe
[52:12] many times we feel like I like this
[52:14] father did oh Lord I believe but help my
[52:18] unbelief and so we just want to maybe
[52:21] look at how many times in our journey in
[52:25] our walk we could find maybe ourselves a
[52:27] two-sided we could find ourselves a lord
[52:31] I believe but help my unbelief but I
[52:33] just maybe want to encourage us to look
[52:36] at the part that believes because
[52:39] there's always something that's going to
[52:41] discourage you there's always something
[52:42] that's gonna go ahead and pop up there's
[52:44] always gonna be something that the devil
[52:46] can take and bring to your attention
[52:48] where all of a sudden you start to
[52:50] question if you believe so I want to say
[52:53] that if we believe let's no question
[52:56] that we believe let's go say Lord I
[52:58] believe your word but but either
[53:00] something in me I don't understand what
[53:02] it is look if there's something between
[53:04] you and God tonight let's make it right
[53:07] let's get down to business I say that
[53:09] many times men Oh Oh bye we don't want
[53:12] to miss an opportunity with God we don't
[53:16] want to miss the opportunity of the Holy
[53:17] Spirit I'm passing by your way tonight
[53:19] you don't have to live another night in
[53:22] bondage no you do not have to you can
[53:26] take God at as word you repent of your
[53:28] sins repent of the things that are wrong
[53:30] in your life have you done something
[53:32] wrong to a brother you don't something
[53:34] wrong to a sister if he said something
[53:35] that wasn't right look let's just don't
[53:38] carry these things around we want to
[53:41] have the right attitude towards the Word
[53:43] of God we want to come into this place
[53:45] expecting God to do mighty things I
[53:48] often think of what kind of expectation
[53:51] we would have and no doubt rightfully so
[53:54] that if the prophet or William Branham
[53:56] was standing
[53:57] behind the pulpit and I believe that God
[54:00] has raised up a bride with a faith in
[54:02] his word that will still accomplish the
[54:05] same exact thing because he said so
[54:09] prophet me would time anytime say if
[54:11] Jesus Christ was standing on this
[54:13] platform wearing a suit I often chuckle
[54:16] at that because he pretty much was that
[54:18] many times God was there availing
[54:21] himself in a man and saying if Jesus
[54:24] Christ was up here wearing a suit right
[54:25] now he could no more heal you tonight
[54:27] because He healed you 2,000 years ago
[54:30] can't we stand in the same place tonight
[54:33] upon that divine promise knowing that by
[54:36] its stripes we are healed just believe
[54:38] believe what he said don't look at the
[54:41] circumstances don't look at the
[54:43] obstacles don't look at your family
[54:45] situation I know it looks like it's a
[54:47] wreck and it looks like it's not gonna
[54:49] be able to be mended but I just want you
[54:51] to place all your trust place all your
[54:53] hope and the Word of God knowing that he
[54:55] has it all under control
[54:56] just trust in him the scripture says in
[55:03] 2nd Corinthians 4:18 it says while we
[55:05] look at the things which are seen while
[55:08] we look not at the things which are seen
[55:10] but at the things which are not seen for
[55:14] the things which are seen are temporal
[55:17] but the things which are not seen are
[55:19] eternal you know we can't help being the
[55:23] these vessels that we are trapped in
[55:26] these little pest houses that we have
[55:29] these five senses that contact our
[55:31] earthly home here and so everything
[55:33] really that we we come in contact is
[55:36] really temporary and and it's easy you
[55:39] know to to look at the things around us
[55:41] and maybe put confidence in them or or
[55:43] be swayed by the situation's around us
[55:46] but you know all of these things are
[55:47] temporary the government's temporary
[55:50] your jobs temporary look your health is
[55:52] temporary if the Lord continue or
[55:55] Terry's if the Lord tarries this this
[56:00] tabernacle we will go by the way of the
[56:03] grave but the inner man Paul said I
[56:06] delight in the inner man because
[56:09] Oh My look at he found a law that ward
[56:11] within em you know what the things I
[56:13] want to do I don't do and the things I
[56:15] don't want to do I find myself doing he
[56:17] said all who delivered me from this vile
[56:19] wretched man that I am but he said I
[56:21] find that I delight in the inner man and
[56:23] that's what we as believers want to
[56:26] delight and we want to delight in that
[56:27] holy spirit and the believer that you
[56:30] are and feed on the things of God not
[56:34] looking to the things that are temporal
[56:35] but looking to the things that are
[56:39] eternal and those are the things that
[56:41] are unseen which we could just plainly
[56:44] state that that's God's Word we look to
[56:48] God's Word maybe you can't see it but by
[56:54] faith you believe it and by that sixth
[56:57] sense it's a substance it means more to
[57:00] you than these five senses could ever my
[57:03] because how many of us have done I made
[57:05] a decision because faith in the sixth
[57:07] sense as anchored in the word and it's
[57:10] contrary to the other five senses it's
[57:13] like you are crazy why would you ever do
[57:15] that why would you move why would you
[57:16] quit your job why would you make this
[57:18] kind of decision because you're living
[57:20] by the unseen you're not living by the
[57:22] temporary things around you you're not
[57:25] basing your journey upon the flesh and
[57:27] upon your job and all of those things
[57:30] around you but you're basing it upon the
[57:32] Word of God and what he said as a
[57:34] believer we know the scripture familiar
[57:38] says heavens and earth will pass away
[57:40] but my word shall never pass away and I
[57:43] just ask you tonight maybe what are we
[57:45] trusting in what are you believing in
[57:49] what type of investments are you making
[57:52] with your time and what things are you
[57:55] applying yourself to and you find many
[57:57] times that we're giving in to the things
[58:00] that are temporary the things that are
[58:02] not going to accomplish anything for any
[58:05] eternal value and so we just want to do
[58:08] to just surrender ourselves in such a
[58:11] way where we're so died out that we're
[58:16] so in tune to the Holy Spirit that we're
[58:20] being led
[58:22] maybe I would ask the question how many
[58:23] when's the last time that you you can
[58:26] say in your heart that you felt the
[58:28] leadership of the Holy Ghost in your
[58:30] life that you truly felt a divine nature
[58:35] come upon you and influence you in such
[58:38] a way that you knew it was God moving
[58:42] upon you to make a decision that's not
[58:46] to bring any condemnation it's to let
[58:48] you know that we are led by the Spirit
[58:51] of God and I would say we should hunger
[58:54] and thirst for righteousness knowing
[58:57] that we would be filled in his Holy
[58:59] Spirit is here to be a guide and to lead
[59:01] you in all truth in all righteousness
[59:04] that's what I desire I desire to be led
[59:10] you know it's easy to get in a routine
[59:14] we're all guilty of it I mean we got our
[59:17] routine and we got our even even you
[59:21] know even even serving the Lord
[59:23] construction right this is when we go to
[59:26] church this is when we pray this is when
[59:28] we do devotions I got God in a nice
[59:30] little box I got my work in a nice
[59:32] little box I got all my little bills in
[59:34] a box and you're just over there
[59:36] delegating and everything just set up
[59:37] and you're just running a good little
[59:39] show yeah well I don't know if you've
[59:43] ever been there but I have but I think
[59:46] we need a step back sometimes and really
[59:50] get shut away from the things of the
[59:53] world and I believe you'll start to find
[59:55] out that we have needs in our
[59:57] congregation that you don't even know
[59:59] exist and that you can start entering
[1:00:02] into a prayer and you can start entering
[1:00:04] into an interceding and God can start
[1:00:08] dealing with your heart in such a way
[1:00:09] that also a brother or sister will come
[1:00:11] on your heart so strong you don't even
[1:00:14] know why and you find out they're living
[1:00:16] in sin you find out they're not living
[1:00:18] right come on church what where is God
[1:00:22] at he's not some somewhere way off in
[1:00:26] the sky if God is going to lay his hands
[1:00:28] on somebody he's going to use your
[1:00:30] if God is going to speak alert of life
[1:00:33] to him he's going to use your mouth to
[1:00:35] do it some people are in a place where
[1:00:38] where they're having such a hard time
[1:00:39] opening the Bible or turning on a tank
[1:00:41] now that we need somebody to stand in
[1:00:44] the gap that will be in prayer that can
[1:00:46] intercede for them on their behalf that
[1:00:48] God could direct you on the footsteps of
[1:00:50] the righteous are ordered by the Lord
[1:00:52] and you can go on down the way you speak
[1:00:54] just the right word to bring deliver
[1:00:56] it's doing oh we're a living Church
[1:00:59] where a body when you start looking
[1:01:02] around I want to say don't despise the
[1:01:04] day of simple things let's don't take it
[1:01:08] for granted something that just struck
[1:01:10] my heart we we know that our church has
[1:01:13] such a great love for one another but I
[1:01:16] just thought mine could could we all of
[1:01:19] a sudden take it for granted where
[1:01:22] people are slipping through the cracks
[1:01:24] and people that we love and hold dear
[1:01:27] maybe we've kind of just chunked up
[1:01:30] there there are routine chopped up their
[1:01:33] behavior and maybe the way they're going
[1:01:35] about things just to just to the way it
[1:01:37] is not realizing that something in their
[1:01:39] life is trying out for help and we could
[1:01:42] help be the solution we're a family and
[1:01:46] that's how Satan works he tries to carve
[1:01:49] us out from the from the family he tries
[1:01:52] to put in a little wedge and something
[1:01:55] be said and maybe something be said just
[1:01:57] a certain way we're all of a sudden an
[1:01:59] individual feels that offended they feel
[1:02:03] hurt and all of a sudden they find the
[1:02:05] joy of going to church is it there
[1:02:07] anymore and all of a sudden they're in a
[1:02:09] struggle when it comes time to go to
[1:02:11] church or maybe they packed themselves
[1:02:12] along a few times but then maybe when
[1:02:15] they would fight through some of the
[1:02:17] difficulties to find themselves in the
[1:02:19] house of Lord that the one day that
[1:02:20] difficulties they're just that little
[1:02:22] extra knife that's jabbing into their
[1:02:27] side where they were hurt maybe by
[1:02:29] something sad or something was
[1:02:30] misunderstood they just feel like you
[1:02:32] know I I can't do it today and what we
[1:02:36] want to do as a family is not get
[1:02:38] self-righteous and lifted up I can't
[1:02:40] believe them look at them I mean my good
[1:02:43] and we don't want to just use church
[1:02:45] attendance as I mean look as a family of
[1:02:50] God we want to have fellowship outside
[1:02:52] of these four walls we need to be in
[1:02:54] touch with our family than just just the
[1:02:57] two times during the week I don't know
[1:03:00] about you but we need fellowship we need
[1:03:02] to strengthen one another we need to
[1:03:04] fellowship around the word this
[1:03:06] shouldn't be the only time we fellowship
[1:03:08] around the word it's when the words
[1:03:10] going over this pulpit know about that
[1:03:13] the word should be constantly upon our
[1:03:15] lips we should be reaching out one to
[1:03:17] another we should be fellowship in other
[1:03:19] things we should be we should be talking
[1:03:21] one with another like I brother what do
[1:03:23] you think about this scripture it's good
[1:03:26] to come together and speak about these
[1:03:28] things because it's in times like that
[1:03:30] that God is ministering to the body we
[1:03:34] know the scripture says for he that
[1:03:37] soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh
[1:03:41] reap corruption but he that soweth to
[1:03:44] the spirit shall of the Spirit reap life
[1:03:46] everlasting that's Galatians 6:8
[1:03:58] pretty straightforward scripture if you
[1:04:03] so do the things of the flesh you're
[1:04:04] going to reap it so we want to be sowing
[1:04:08] to the spirit we want to be about our
[1:04:11] father's business we want to be looking
[1:04:14] to the word what does the word say about
[1:04:18] it look we believe in a rapture we
[1:04:22] believe in the changing of our bodies we
[1:04:25] believe in divine healing but you know
[1:04:29] we stagger at that many times we find
[1:04:32] ourselves right back in that place as
[1:04:33] this father going Lord I believe but
[1:04:36] help my unbelief and I just pray that by
[1:04:40] the word going forth tonight that you
[1:04:43] will take faith in what God made you God
[1:04:47] made you an overcomer he made you an
[1:04:50] eagle he made you to take the pressure
[1:04:54] of this age whatever situation that
[1:04:56] you're going through right now you were
[1:04:58] born for it he made you for it it's not
[1:05:02] too big you're not gonna break under the
[1:05:06] pressure because somebody else is
[1:05:08] handling the pressure for you he got you
[1:05:11] in the palm of his hand he's not gonna
[1:05:12] let you go I want to encourage you that
[1:05:15] what are you spoken of you he's going to
[1:05:18] see that he makes it through he's not a
[1:05:22] just didn't call you and pick you up and
[1:05:24] bring you on this journey and then when
[1:05:25] everything just got so tough where you
[1:05:28] just might I just can't take it anymore
[1:05:29] that Jesus I was a year on your own I I
[1:05:32] just I just thought you would react
[1:05:34] different no he saw the end from the
[1:05:36] beginning and he brings us through these
[1:05:38] times of testings because what is it
[1:05:41] doing it's molding you and it's making
[1:05:43] you and it's shaping you bringing out
[1:05:45] that character that that dross is being
[1:05:47] beat out in your life and and and you're
[1:05:49] being molded and we know that everything
[1:05:52] is for a purpose but truly many times as
[1:05:56] believers we feel like lord I believe
[1:05:59] but I shop so I'm struggling right now
[1:06:01] I'm struggling right now I want to
[1:06:04] encourage you tonight the scripture says
[1:06:07] in Romans 6:14 for sin shall not have
[1:06:11] dominion
[1:06:11] and over you for sin shall not have
[1:06:15] dominion over you what is sin
[1:06:19] unbelief unbelief will not have dominion
[1:06:23] over you for sin shall not have dominion
[1:06:26] over you for you are not under the law
[1:06:29] but under grace unbelief is not going to
[1:06:35] have dominion over you so as the word is
[1:06:38] going for it I want you to start looking
[1:06:41] at who you are and to realize that this
[1:06:44] little thing that pops up over here that
[1:06:47] says you know what all of your faults
[1:06:50] and all your failures you know you just
[1:06:51] don't believe you heard what he just
[1:06:53] said even the disciples were given power
[1:06:55] and all this things they look you don't
[1:06:56] even believe that's why that's why you
[1:07:00] haven't been healed that's why your
[1:07:01] family situation hasn't been fixed that
[1:07:03] say you believe but you got all this
[1:07:05] unbelief over your unbelief will not
[1:07:08] have dominion over you the word of the
[1:07:11] Lord is coming to you tonight to tell
[1:07:13] you that unbelief is not going to have
[1:07:16] dominion over you it's not going to
[1:07:19] define you it's not going to define your
[1:07:21] life it's not going to define the
[1:07:23] situation that you're going through
[1:07:24] because you are a believer and you
[1:07:27] believe God's Word and you're standing
[1:07:30] upon that word no matter what the devil
[1:07:32] says no matter how he how he throws all
[1:07:35] the trash in your face and he tries to
[1:07:37] call to remembrance all the things that
[1:07:39] you went through and he's trying to show
[1:07:41] you see oh you believe but there's this
[1:07:43] unbelief there's this other side and
[1:07:45] that's exactly what the devil's wanting
[1:07:47] you to do he's wanting you to get your
[1:07:49] eyes off Calvary he's want you to get
[1:07:51] your eyes off the Lord he's wanting you
[1:07:53] to look over this way at the flesh to
[1:07:55] look at the things that are temporary
[1:07:57] but the word is coming for telling you
[1:07:59] sin will not have dominion over you you
[1:08:03] keep looking at the word have faith in
[1:08:05] what I made you I made you the bride I
[1:08:08] made you without spot without wrinkle
[1:08:11] and keep your eyes
[1:08:12] on the promise and everything will come
[1:08:14] to pass oh he says for sin shall not
[1:08:21] have dominion over you for you are not
[1:08:23] under the law but under grace you
[1:08:28] imagine living under the law that's a
[1:08:33] terrible way to live you think of how
[1:08:36] helpless that would feel and I haven't
[1:08:39] taken the time to go through it all I
[1:08:42] mean it's almost intimidating there's a
[1:08:45] lot of laws there's a lot of things to
[1:08:48] keep there's a lot of food they can't
[1:08:50] either they got to dress a certain way
[1:08:51] and and my I tell you what brothers or
[1:08:54] sisters if you feel like being a
[1:08:56] believers taxing well for for one you
[1:08:59] just just get the Holy Spirit and it
[1:09:00] won't be but you want to talk about
[1:09:03] taxing living under the law there was so
[1:09:06] many things that they had to adhere to
[1:09:08] and they had no power to perform it and
[1:09:12] so all they could look forward to at the
[1:09:14] end of the year was to go uh-uh take the
[1:09:17] sacrifice and that would just be a
[1:09:20] substitute wouldn't be a finished work
[1:09:23] but it would be a substitute a covering
[1:09:26] which we know it was a type of Christ to
[1:09:30] come but could you imagine living under
[1:09:33] that kind of bondage but you know what's
[1:09:35] sad there's many people that are living
[1:09:38] a Christian life or who are believing
[1:09:41] this message that are in that exact
[1:09:43] situation look I want to tell you that
[1:09:48] if this message is a burden to you
[1:09:50] you're in bondage if it's hard for you
[1:09:54] now now don't misinterpret a struggle if
[1:09:58] you're if you're fighting praise God you
[1:10:01] keep fighting you keep believing I know
[1:10:04] how it is if if you find yourself moving
[1:10:07] towards of the things that are right but
[1:10:09] then you find yourself going back you
[1:10:10] just keep pressing and you keep
[1:10:12] believing that's wonderful if you're in
[1:10:15] a place uh-uh-uh-uh-uh where you're
[1:10:17] believing and God has placed it on your
[1:10:20] heart and you believe them and now
[1:10:21] you're in a place of sanctification
[1:10:23] where you're not living
[1:10:24] like and you're in a struggle praise God
[1:10:26] that's okay you keep fighting you keep
[1:10:29] believing and you keep taking taking God
[1:10:32] at His Word and he'll bring you all the
[1:10:33] way through but if you've just been
[1:10:36] going through the motions for so many
[1:10:38] years and so you're just trying to walk
[1:10:40] the line just how short can I make my
[1:10:42] dress and how high can I let the split
[1:10:44] go and how can I do my hair and all
[1:10:47] these things all my I've heard at all
[1:10:49] you know we're not supposed to cut our
[1:10:51] hair so we'll burn our hair we won't
[1:10:52] burn our hair we'll break our hair and
[1:10:55] that's a real struggle we shouldn't
[1:10:57] belittle it either because I don't know
[1:10:59] what it's like
[1:11:00] god bless our sisters that have a
[1:11:03] revelation to know what the word says
[1:11:05] and that it's pleasing to our Lord god
[1:11:07] bless you for that I won't belittle the
[1:11:10] struggle because I don't know what a
[1:11:11] slide I don't know what it's like for
[1:11:12] them spirits and those things to move
[1:11:14] upon you and the pressure of the age for
[1:11:17] the women to present themselves so I
[1:11:19] don't belittle that at all but I want to
[1:11:21] tell you you can come to a place where
[1:11:23] it's not a burden
[1:11:24] he said come unto me all your heavy
[1:11:27] laden and I will give you rest
[1:11:29] oh when you come to know him in the
[1:11:31] power of his resurrection this word in
[1:11:34] this appearance such a Liberty you say
[1:11:36] Lord whatever I can do to serve you
[1:11:38] whatever I can do and I'll lay down my
[1:11:40] life if you want me to wear dresses down
[1:11:42] to the floor I live down the floor if
[1:11:44] you want me to grow my hair long I'll
[1:11:46] grow my hair long Lord if you want me to
[1:11:48] clean up my life and you want me to stop
[1:11:50] going over to this place if you want me
[1:11:52] to stop fellowship with these people
[1:11:53] Lord whatever your will is for my life
[1:11:55] Lord I surrender it all to you whatever
[1:11:59] you have for me and then now you know
[1:12:01] the scripture says where the Spirit of
[1:12:03] the Lord is there is Liberty oh my never
[1:12:07] experienced such Liberty and all my life
[1:12:10] is serving my Lord Jesus Christ oh I've
[1:12:13] been in bondage to the test master of
[1:12:15] the world and he's a hard taskmaster sin
[1:12:18] will take you farther than you ever want
[1:12:20] to go oh that's bondage but oh if you
[1:12:25] could just give your life over into the
[1:12:27] hands of those nail-scarred hands those
[1:12:30] sweet tender loving hands of Jesus he'll
[1:12:34] pull her to his bosom and you start to
[1:12:37] take all the sea
[1:12:38] and all the strife and all the scars and
[1:12:41] all the hurt and you pull you close to
[1:12:43] you to us Muslim you say it's okay I
[1:12:45] know I know what you're going through
[1:12:48] and you'll feel that burden you'll feel
[1:12:51] that despair and you feel those things
[1:12:52] just will start to lift off your life
[1:12:54] and you'll find such a sweet Liberty in
[1:12:56] serving a life to Jesus Christ why but
[1:13:04] you find people serving this message you
[1:13:09] know and say well brother I got a right
[1:13:13] to dress how I want to I got a right to
[1:13:17] choose when I come to church I got a
[1:13:18] right to do these things I've got a
[1:13:21] god-given right to dress the way that I
[1:13:24] feel I should dress no you don't know
[1:13:28] you know the Prophet says you
[1:13:30] surrendered your rights you're a land
[1:13:34] your to bear rule your to believe that's
[1:13:39] what the work that's what the Prophet
[1:13:40] said so then when somebody offends you
[1:13:43] you don't have a right to hold a grudge
[1:13:46] when you see something that you don't
[1:13:49] think is just meaning that you don't
[1:13:50] have a right to catch judgment on that
[1:13:53] situation and hold yourself and some
[1:13:56] self righteous in the nation you don't
[1:13:58] have a right look love covers a
[1:14:00] multitude of sin you don't have a right
[1:14:02] to hold up in your heart if something is
[1:14:06] keeping you out of the house of God I
[1:14:08] believe that you're a believer I believe
[1:14:10] in what God told you what you are make
[1:14:12] it right don't live like that any longer
[1:14:15] Oh Satan will deceive you into thinking
[1:14:18] that you have a right to act the way
[1:14:20] that you're acting our only right is to
[1:14:23] surrender to him and whatever his will
[1:14:25] for our life is be it unto me according
[1:14:27] to thy word oh praise the Lord when that
[1:14:34] Holy Ghost comes my there's nothing like
[1:14:38] it there's somebody anyhow that's been
[1:14:40] born again whoo that gets me excited
[1:14:44] because I know what it's like not to be
[1:14:46] born again and I thought I was living
[1:14:50] man I just thought
[1:14:51] was alright but you know there was
[1:14:53] something inside of me that couldn't get
[1:14:55] satisfied there's something just kind of
[1:14:57] eating there and so you feed it with all
[1:14:59] the things of the world and you find out
[1:15:00] that nothing in the world will ever
[1:15:01] satisfy it look you're a peculiar person
[1:15:04] you're an oddball you find out why some
[1:15:07] people are successful and they can just
[1:15:09] carry on and live the way they are maybe
[1:15:12] a halfway christian profess the name of
[1:15:14] the lord and they get all the blessings
[1:15:15] like what's wrong with me look you're
[1:15:18] just an oddball your inheritance isn't
[1:15:19] over here your inheritance is glory but
[1:15:24] Satan's always wanting to bring you back
[1:15:26] under the law he's always wanting to
[1:15:29] point out your faults in your failures
[1:15:31] but I love how Paul says in Romans 8:1
[1:15:35] he says there is therefore now no
[1:15:37] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:15:39] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:15:42] after the spirit
[1:15:43] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:15:45] Christ Jesus have made us free from the
[1:15:48] law of sin and death for what the law
[1:15:51] could not do in that it was weak through
[1:15:53] the flesh God sending his own son and
[1:15:56] the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:15:59] condemned sin in the flesh look I don't
[1:16:03] care how far you've gone there's power
[1:16:06] in the blood
[1:16:07] well there's power in the blood since
[1:16:11] things are lost in its life-giving flow
[1:16:15] would you be free from your burden and
[1:16:17] pride
[1:16:17] oh there's power in the blood oh my I
[1:16:22] know this sounds simple sense but it's
[1:16:26] the most powerful thing that you could
[1:16:28] ever come in contact with oh the pillars
[1:16:30] power in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:16:33] brother branham says out of Christ the
[1:16:35] mystery of God revealed he said that's
[1:16:37] God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to
[1:16:39] express himself to take his own laws and
[1:16:42] live by his laws and fulfill his law by
[1:16:45] death Christ God died in flesh in order
[1:16:49] to condemn sin in the flesh that he
[1:16:51] might bring to himself a glorious bride
[1:16:54] redeemed back that will believe only in
[1:16:58] the Word of God and not swap it like Eve
[1:17:02] did for intellectual conceptions of men
[1:17:05] we're back to believing what the word
[1:17:07] says look we we I don't know if we'll
[1:17:11] get to it but it's easy for us to look
[1:17:13] into the word and recognize the prophets
[1:17:16] position recognize the disciples
[1:17:20] position to recognize the messengers
[1:17:22] position but when it comes to us we
[1:17:26] stumble at it when it comes to our
[1:17:29] position in the word and what God has
[1:17:32] made us and that's what we open the
[1:17:35] service with is having faith in who you
[1:17:37] are and it's having that type of
[1:17:40] confidence and faith in what the word
[1:17:43] has made you that we're talking about
[1:17:45] believe only that word don't swap it out
[1:17:48] don't don't let this other thing come up
[1:17:50] here and start to to attack you and you
[1:17:53] start looking away and feeling a little
[1:17:54] less of yourself no you just stay right
[1:17:56] with that word for proverbs 3:5 says
[1:17:58] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[1:18:00] and lean not to thine own understanding
[1:18:03] and all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[1:18:07] shall direct thy path not part of the
[1:18:10] ways in all thy ways
[1:18:12] I just want to maybe look at this you
[1:18:15] know a lot of times we go in circles and
[1:18:19] our Christian walk
[1:18:20] maybe you've been going in a circle with
[1:18:23] battling something or you've been going
[1:18:25] through a cycle of where it's maybe
[1:18:27] every six months you find yourself
[1:18:28] coming up against this same temptation
[1:18:30] maybe it's a couple weeks or maybe it's
[1:18:35] every five years I want you to know that
[1:18:39] God is allowing you to come up against
[1:18:42] that obstacle again because you are an
[1:18:44] overcomer and you are going to overcome
[1:18:48] that because sin will not have dominion
[1:18:51] over you and God by His grace I early in
[1:18:58] my Christian walk I found that many
[1:19:00] times when I might stumble to something
[1:19:03] or fall I realized that I was not given
[1:19:06] my time do the things unseen to the
[1:19:09] eternal things but I was giving too much
[1:19:10] time to the temporal things and all of a
[1:19:13] sudden I might find that I wasn't
[1:19:14] guarding myself or I find I was given
[1:19:17] too much of my time too
[1:19:18] something and then I realized well what
[1:19:20] did you expect you let down the bar and
[1:19:23] I want to tell you that if if there's
[1:19:25] something I believe the Lord speaking to
[1:19:27] you now if there's something you keep
[1:19:29] coming against and it keeps discourage
[1:19:32] you in heaping condemnation on you it by
[1:19:35] the word there is no condemnation to
[1:19:37] them that are in Christ Jesus and that
[1:19:40] sin is not going to have dominion over
[1:19:42] you so now take the faith that God has
[1:19:45] given you rest in the promises of his
[1:19:48] word and next time that devil shows us
[1:19:50] how'd you take it off and when you take
[1:19:53] it off do like David did you you testify
[1:19:58] of the victory we're a victorious Church
[1:20:02] and we don't want to act like we're so
[1:20:05] high and lifted up that none of us are
[1:20:06] going through any battles or any childs
[1:20:08] we're living in lady I'll see the
[1:20:10] darkest age there ever was we got young
[1:20:13] people who are trying to live sanctified
[1:20:15] lives of the most wicked age there's
[1:20:16] ever been I don't want the young people
[1:20:18] to know I'm proud of you I'm so proud
[1:20:21] that you would come and you'd sit on the
[1:20:22] front rows and you would give your heart
[1:20:24] to God you serve them and this wicked
[1:20:26] age I'm proud of you I want you to keep
[1:20:28] pressing the battle we need you we need
[1:20:31] your testimony we need your strength in
[1:20:33] the church I'm proud of you you keep it
[1:20:35] up oh it's such a testimony to our
[1:20:39] church don't let the devil beat you down
[1:20:43] just because the word goes forward that
[1:20:45] maybe your struggles with some praise
[1:20:46] God your struggle with it overcome it
[1:20:49] keep fighting keep believing until you
[1:20:51] put that down below under your foot for
[1:20:53] the last time Oh hallelujah one of these
[1:20:55] glorious days we're gonna put death
[1:20:58] under a foot we're gonna go in a body
[1:20:59] change oh I can't wait for that day but
[1:21:02] it's coming hallelujah but I was just
[1:21:06] thinking about going through these
[1:21:07] cycles and as our pastor he mentioned
[1:21:10] not too long ago about uh uh the
[1:21:13] scripture you know we've never passed
[1:21:15] this way before and there as Joshua was
[1:21:18] getting ready to cross over the Jordan
[1:21:20] uh Joshua took the ark which represents
[1:21:24] the Word of God and you put it out in
[1:21:26] front of the people and said now follow
[1:21:28] the ark it's gonna take
[1:21:30] it's gonna take you across
[1:21:32] Jordan this is what you have to do and
[1:21:34] that's as believers what do we do we
[1:21:36] follow the word we believe the word and
[1:21:39] if you've never passed this way before
[1:21:41] if you've never been baptized and filled
[1:21:43] with the Holy Spirit you have a divine
[1:21:45] promise essentially picked up your sins
[1:21:47] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:21:49] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[1:21:51] gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:53] you put that word you put that Ark out
[1:21:55] right in front of you and you keep
[1:21:56] taking footsteps footsteps are
[1:21:59] possessing you stay right behind that
[1:22:00] word and you watch God confirm his word
[1:22:03] and come back that up with the power of
[1:22:05] the Holy Ghost in your life oh that's
[1:22:07] what he does he promised it just keep
[1:22:10] believing it
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:29] we stumble at it though God hide in
[1:22:33] himself in simplicity we stumble at it
[1:22:38] to think that God is veiling himself in
[1:22:41] your skin and you're the one that has to
[1:22:44] get up with the guy every morning and
[1:22:46] you're like really
[1:22:47] Lord I believe but help my unbelief you
[1:22:51] know sometimes you feel like God where
[1:22:53] are you at I feel like I'm all on my own
[1:22:56] but praise God for that sixth sense
[1:22:58] called faith that in the face of all the
[1:23:02] doubt in the face of all the confusion
[1:23:04] there's an anchor there there's
[1:23:06] something that says Lord I believe your
[1:23:10] word Lord and though all of these things
[1:23:14] are coming against me and I just seem
[1:23:16] like I'm barely holding on lord I know
[1:23:18] it's you that's keeping me I know you're
[1:23:21] the one that's holding me Lord if it was
[1:23:23] up to me on my own strength look where
[1:23:24] would we be if it was up to us and then
[1:23:27] we start to realize it's His grace it's
[1:23:29] that message of grace that's come and
[1:23:31] that's called you and that's keeping you
[1:23:34] the prophet of God says and in the
[1:23:37] invisible union of the Bride of Christ
[1:23:38] she says now maybe this is just a part
[1:23:43] that we're familiar with but let's have
[1:23:47] faith and who you are we're going to
[1:23:50] read this and this is speaking of you
[1:23:53] brother Branham in the invisible union
[1:23:56] of the Bride of Christ 1965 this is
[1:23:59] November 25th one of his last messages
[1:24:03] he says this is my message to the church
[1:24:06] now as we go off the air in just a
[1:24:09] minute
[1:24:09] you are standing if you're standing on
[1:24:12] God's Word and with God's Word every
[1:24:15] Amen every jot every tittle where are
[1:24:18] you standing I am trying to tell you
[1:24:22] pull away from them shucks and get out
[1:24:25] here in the wheat where you can get
[1:24:27] right before the Sun I hear the coming
[1:24:32] of the combine you're standing complete
[1:24:36] justified like you never did it in the
[1:24:40] first place hallelujah talk about a
[1:24:43] thanks kid
[1:24:43] I feel real good I am more thankful for
[1:24:47] that than anything I know of you are the
[1:24:50] pure virtuous sinless bride of the Son
[1:24:54] of the Living God and every man and
[1:24:57] woman that is born of the Spirit of God
[1:24:59] and washes has washed in the blood of
[1:25:02] Jesus Christ and believes every word of
[1:25:05] God stands as though you never sinned at
[1:25:08] the first place you are perfect you are
[1:25:16] perfect you are perfect oh my brother
[1:25:22] Matthew that's only a terminology that's
[1:25:24] that's reserved for Jesus Christ where
[1:25:27] do you think you came from
[1:25:30] she is him you are perfect you are the
[1:25:37] perfect word being made flesh in the end
[1:25:41] time you are perfect half faith in what
[1:25:46] God made you
[1:25:48] oh it's not just words to make you feel
[1:25:51] good about yourself
[1:25:52] all right the scripture says do do we
[1:25:55] sin because grace abound god forbid but
[1:25:59] it's time that the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:26:01] has faith and what God has made you you
[1:26:05] are perfectly dialed that bring somebody
[1:26:06] deliverance because if I had the enemy
[1:26:10] I'm fine eats all kind of condemnation
[1:26:12] on me he heaves all kinds of faults and
[1:26:14] failures on me he's always wanting to
[1:26:17] point out the weaknesses oh but when you
[1:26:19] look to Jesus Christ when you come to
[1:26:21] your headship Christ your mate he looks
[1:26:24] right at you through that sin for that
[1:26:26] blood of Jesus Christ he says
[1:26:28] you are perfect oh you talk about a
[1:26:32] revelation that's been brought you're
[1:26:34] talking about the catch don't come and
[1:26:35] saying grace grace look the brother
[1:26:38] branham shows so plainly what it means
[1:26:40] you're not just forgiven he shows so
[1:26:45] glad I was if somebody if you are
[1:26:47] carrying around some baggage but you
[1:26:50] made some decisions in your life and you
[1:26:54] feel that you've been scarred
[1:26:57] and you feel such condemnation like you
[1:27:00] can never be repaired or something has
[1:27:02] just been the devil's just been jabbing
[1:27:04] that into you and it feels like it's
[1:27:06] been holding you down the Prophet said
[1:27:09] now look if if if if I stole $20 from
[1:27:13] Cosman I'll pay you back later and he
[1:27:18] came and forgave me for it well I would
[1:27:21] be forgiven but I wouldn't be justified
[1:27:23] right is that is that is that how he
[1:27:25] said it but if he came to me and said
[1:27:28] look brother Matthew I forgive you for
[1:27:30] taking for stealing that 20 R's like
[1:27:32] what are you talking about I never stole
[1:27:34] $20 he's like okay but I forgive you oh
[1:27:38] do you realize do you realize what the
[1:27:41] shed blood of Jesus Christ has done for
[1:27:43] you when you are lost by the blood of
[1:27:46] Jesus Christ you never sinned in the
[1:27:49] first place he said he goes back in it
[1:27:51] spin back on the devil you never did
[1:27:54] that the devil did it you never did it
[1:27:57] in the first place you are forgiven not
[1:28:00] only forgiven you are justified that's
[1:28:03] what the Prophet could stand there said
[1:28:05] you are perfect because you never sinned
[1:28:08] in the first place oh my when you catch
[1:28:12] that revelation then you can start
[1:28:14] walking in the truth of what God is
[1:28:17] wanting to manifest in this last day you
[1:28:20] can start having faith in who you are
[1:28:23] when you realize what the power of the
[1:28:26] blood has really done for you you're not
[1:28:29] just forgiven you're justified you never
[1:28:32] did it in the first place oh here comes
[1:28:35] the headship the capstone coming crying
[1:28:38] grace grace grace you never send in the
[1:28:43] you are the pure sinless virtuous bride
[1:28:47] of Jesus Christ you are perfect Oh
[1:28:50] hallelujah doesn't that make you feel
[1:28:52] good thank you Lord Jesus
[1:28:56] Oh glory to God praise His name amen
[1:29:05] we'll just find a place to close oh
[1:29:12] thank you Lord for his blood
[1:29:17] you're not just forgiven I just pray you
[1:29:21] can catch the revelation you don't have
[1:29:25] to hold that burden any longer Church
[1:29:28] you don't have to hold that condemnation
[1:29:30] any longer you didn't do it is that not
[1:29:35] what he said
[1:29:36] I want to ask you who said that I wasn't
[1:29:40] a man william branham that was the
[1:29:42] creator of heaven and earth who
[1:29:44] descended to reveal himself to arrive
[1:29:46] they said you are perfect although we
[1:29:50] stumble a simplicity that's exactly what
[1:29:53] the whole church world did they stumbled
[1:29:56] at the simplicity of the Lord being made
[1:29:58] to manifest before him just like when
[1:30:01] Jesus Christ came all brother Brent says
[1:30:03] that hid their polish too hard he come
[1:30:05] down and he bypassed all of their
[1:30:07] religious seminaries he bypassed the
[1:30:10] Sadducees he bypassed other Pharisees I
[1:30:12] what he did he bypassed all the way down
[1:30:14] to just a simple humble little version
[1:30:17] who said be it unto me according to thy
[1:30:19] word by past all the educated bypassed
[1:30:23] all the scholar Lee's and then we see
[1:30:27] these Wars Lane in the scripture that
[1:30:29] says oh as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:30:33] shall it be in the days of the revealing
[1:30:35] of the son of man
[1:30:37] all men had probed at it for years and
[1:30:39] for years and for years and they probed
[1:30:41] at the revealing of the seven seals and
[1:30:43] wondered oh my how could this be and
[1:30:46] people had it on the other side of the
[1:30:47] tribulation and maybe some had a little
[1:30:50] truth here and some had a little truth
[1:30:51] here but there was something laying in
[1:30:53] the scripture that said at the sounding
[1:30:55] of the seven angels message when he
[1:30:57] begins the sound all the mysteries in
[1:31:00] the Bible shall be finished all the
[1:31:02] middle did the world know there in 1933
[1:31:05] in a little place called Jeffersonville
[1:31:08] there was a little mud pit out in the
[1:31:10] middle of the field and there was a
[1:31:11] little young man who was about to be
[1:31:13] went to his first life over there and he
[1:31:15] was caught up in a vision in 1933 and he
[1:31:20] come out of that vision and the Lord
[1:31:24] says read 2nd Timothy 4 maybe we ought
[1:31:29] to read it this has been burning me up
[1:31:32] for a long time think of it now God
[1:31:37] hiding himself in simplicity here this
[1:31:45] written would a brother man who preaches
[1:31:47] God hiding himself and simplicity he
[1:31:51] talks about how God came to a simple
[1:31:53] farmer like Noah starts going all the
[1:31:58] way down through hell God's always
[1:32:00] hiding himself in simplicity the church
[1:32:03] world and everybody else stumbles at it
[1:32:05] but God is hidden and simplicity and I
[1:32:08] just by God's grace if we don't run out
[1:32:10] of time I want you to understand that
[1:32:12] God is making himself known in your
[1:32:15] simplicity don't despise the days of
[1:32:18] small things you are maybe a simple
[1:32:20] little group though but you're the very
[1:32:23] apple of his eye you're everything that
[1:32:25] he would take Calvary and die for you
[1:32:27] are his achievement that is achieved in
[1:32:30] this last days you are perfect and here
[1:32:33] the Prophet comes out of a vision in
[1:32:35] 1933 2nd Timothy 4 brother Branham it's
[1:32:41] about 6 o'clock in the morning here he's
[1:32:42] not to lay the cornerstone at the
[1:32:44] tabernacle I don't know what was just a
[1:32:47] little my bed
[1:32:50] and he's he's going to lay the
[1:32:52] cornerstone and he's it's about six
[1:32:57] o'clock in the morning he's caught up in
[1:32:58] a vision and only he's sensing you as he
[1:33:01] tells us in present stage of my ministry
[1:33:04] in September I believe it is in 1962
[1:33:06] he's talking about oh and I was caught
[1:33:08] up in a vision kind of the tabernacle
[1:33:10] looked like it was just no actually it
[1:33:11] starts out by the by the Jordan River
[1:33:13] where John was baptizing but we won't
[1:33:15] break all this down because it's just
[1:33:17] wonderful
[1:33:18] but he's at the tavern he goes oh I'm so
[1:33:20] thankful for my Tabernacle with the
[1:33:22] angel or says this is not your
[1:33:23] tabernacle and he takes him down and
[1:33:25] sets him down before the the great blue
[1:33:27] sky and this vision unfolds to him and
[1:33:29] he comes out of the vision it says read
[1:33:31] 2nd Timothy 4 and he comes out of the
[1:33:35] vision he grabs it and the prophecy as I
[1:33:37] read I charge thee therefore before God
[1:33:39] and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[1:33:41] judge the quick and the dead at his
[1:33:43] appearing and his kingdom hallelujah
[1:33:46] preach the word be instant in season out
[1:33:48] of season reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:33:51] long-suffering and doctrine for the time
[1:33:53] shall come when they will not endure
[1:33:55] sound doctrine but after their own lusts
[1:33:57] shall keep to themselves teachers having
[1:33:59] itching ears and they shall turn away
[1:34:02] their ears from the truth and shall be
[1:34:04] turned unto fables but watch thou in all
[1:34:07] things endure afflictions do the work of
[1:34:09] evangelist make full proof of thy
[1:34:11] ministry here the Prophet is standing
[1:34:14] there in September of 1962 and he says
[1:34:16] this this scripture has been fulfilled
[1:34:18] he said but it wasn't here until last
[1:34:21] May in Southern Pines that I actually
[1:34:23] read the rest of the scripture he said
[1:34:25] just like Jesus when he picked up the
[1:34:27] scrolls and he only ran it to a certain
[1:34:29] point because the other pertained to a
[1:34:32] second coming and he's now pointing out
[1:34:34] that the rest of 2nd Timothy 4 is
[1:34:37] pertaining to the crowning of brother
[1:34:39] branham's ministry and he goes on any
[1:34:41] preacher serves as this the end time and
[1:34:43] why is he preaching the service because
[1:34:46] all of the prophets life there's been
[1:34:48] something calling him to the west oh now
[1:34:52] I don't you to miss God hiding himself
[1:34:54] in simplicity here comes a little boy
[1:34:56] from a moonshine family packing
[1:34:59] - took - to help produce liquor and
[1:35:03] alcohol a world little catches up on
[1:35:06] when he's seven years old and speaks to
[1:35:08] him and gives them a Nazarite vow says
[1:35:10] you shall never drink or to file your
[1:35:12] body in any way for you have a work to
[1:35:14] do when you get older God hiding himself
[1:35:17] and simplicity didn't come to the big
[1:35:19] denominations didn't come to the big
[1:35:21] seminaries and here this boy goes along
[1:35:25] and now he has a call of God on his life
[1:35:27] and and everything's calling him out
[1:35:29] west and he's standing here saying it
[1:35:31] serves is this a time
[1:35:33] look I had a vision in 1958 that when I
[1:35:37] saw a peg drove down to my road that I
[1:35:39] was supposed to be obedient to a vision
[1:35:41] and go west and he said that's been
[1:35:44] happening now I'm being obedient to the
[1:35:46] vision and he starts to explain how just
[1:35:48] eight days earlier on December 22nd 1962
[1:35:51] that he was caught he was caught up in a
[1:35:53] vision and in this vision y'all bear
[1:35:56] with me i but you I apologize if this is
[1:35:58] just for me
[1:35:59] blurry but on December 22nd he's he's
[1:36:04] he's this is a really instrumental time
[1:36:09] December 22nd because there's been six
[1:36:13] dreams that have been brought to brother
[1:36:14] Branham about him going west and so
[1:36:18] brother random knows the time is coming
[1:36:19] is drawing nigh and then now he his
[1:36:23] vision of 1958 has been fulfilled in he
[1:36:25] knows he's going west and he's now he on
[1:36:27] December 22nd he's caught up in this
[1:36:28] constellation of angels but first he saw
[1:36:32] like these two little Bert these little
[1:36:34] birds coming he's a little veterans
[1:36:36] little birds come and they sat down on
[1:36:38] the bush and they kind of made a
[1:36:39] constellation like a little pyramid and
[1:36:42] he says then another they flew off and
[1:36:44] another group came and they're a little
[1:36:46] bit bigger and he said then all of a
[1:36:48] sudden like out from eternity must have
[1:36:51] been five no more but seven just there's
[1:36:53] like not even a bad of an ayah but at
[1:36:55] weekly and all sudden they were there
[1:36:57] and I was caught up and there's a big
[1:36:58] blast and what does this mean he's like
[1:37:00] Oh could this be those seven thunders
[1:37:02] and he's preaching this message with an
[1:37:05] honest heart saying could this be is
[1:37:07] this where we're at could this mean that
[1:37:10] the revealing of these seven thunders
[1:37:12] that men have broke that all down
[1:37:14] through the scripture
[1:37:15] could this be where can you imagine the
[1:37:18] church world hearing some uneducated man
[1:37:21] who grew up in Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:37:24] and turned some mud bed into a little
[1:37:26] Tabernacle standing there Sam is gone
[1:37:29] calling me for this great monumental
[1:37:32] revealing of the seven seals all the
[1:37:35] church world couldn't stand it God
[1:37:39] hiding in simplicity and there he goes
[1:37:43] out
[1:37:45] according to being obedient to a vision
[1:37:48] he moved there in about the first week
[1:37:51] of 1963 to Tucson Arizona and he climbed
[1:37:54] up there in the mountains of Sabino
[1:37:57] Canyon and why he was praying there and
[1:37:58] Street searching the heard something
[1:38:00] came down in his hand
[1:38:02] something struck his hand and he says Oh
[1:38:04] like it could have been a dream why I
[1:38:06] can't say but as I know there was a soul
[1:38:08] and I thought a king sorry said no the
[1:38:11] King's sword and that the Lord spoke to
[1:38:15] him and said this is this this is the
[1:38:19] revelation of those thunders those seals
[1:38:21] this is the vindication of your ministry
[1:38:24] go back and preach those seven seals now
[1:38:29] here comes a man a little humble man
[1:38:33] comes back to this little Tabernacle in
[1:38:36] Jeffersonville Indiana and is standing
[1:38:39] there preaching God hiding himself in
[1:38:41] simplicity and there he's standing
[1:38:43] preaching the breech and saying I'm at
[1:38:45] his mercy you know you know I'm if he
[1:38:50] don't come I'm waiting on him who was it
[1:38:54] that came and broke themselves who was
[1:38:59] it that took that book out of my hand I
[1:39:01] sat there in the throne all they looked
[1:39:04] in the scripture brother and says it's
[1:39:06] the most sublime thing ever in scripture
[1:39:09] that here the title Dean was sitting in
[1:39:12] the hand of the one that sat upon the
[1:39:13] throne and
[1:39:14] now Jesus Christ the Son of God that
[1:39:17] said as the mediator for seven church
[1:39:19] ages now is coming forth to claim his
[1:39:23] rights to claim when he died for to
[1:39:25] claim what he bought to claim his
[1:39:28] perfect bride and he comes and takes the
[1:39:31] book he takes the book and he descends
[1:39:35] with an open book in hand
[1:39:37] what are you telling me I'm telling you
[1:39:40] that was fulfilled on a little mutt bed
[1:39:43] in Jeffersonville Indiana for your sake
[1:39:46] Christ had come and not only redeemed
[1:39:49] you but he's taken you all the way back
[1:39:52] to what Adam and Eve lost now you can
[1:39:56] say to this mountain be thou removed God
[1:40:01] hiding himself in simplicity if the
[1:40:03] musicians would come but it doesn't stop
[1:40:11] their church behold I send you Elijah

[1:40:31] things Christ is being veiled in your
[1:40:35] flesh the Prophet was the first one to
[1:40:38] maturity he was a sheath wave he was one
[1:40:42] that came to maturity showing what
[1:40:44] Christ had accomplished and now there's
[1:40:48] a whole wheat field coming up right
[1:40:50] behind it saying glory to God I believe
[1:40:54] in what you made me I'm going to set my
[1:40:57] wings to the winds of faith maybe you
[1:40:59] could play that oh my
[1:41:05] the prophet of God would say there and
[1:41:10] God hidden in simplicity he would say
[1:41:13] that if Moses it loves us under the shed
[1:41:19] blood of bulls and goats can be put into
[1:41:22] position to call for the plagues and
[1:41:24] call for the Flies he said why would you
[1:41:27] stumble why would you stumble at the
[1:41:30] bleach blood of Jesus Christ that could
[1:41:34] sweet squirrels into existence why would
[1:41:37] you stumble at a church why would you

[1:42:45] your way
[1:42:48] [Music]
[1:42:59] I just want to read this real quick
[1:43:19] mother random preaching present stage of
[1:43:21] my ministry he reads the rest of this
[1:43:27] second Timothy four
[1:43:29] [Music]
[1:43:33] he's labored to show that there's a
[1:43:35] transition that's taking place in his
[1:43:37] Minister if you follow it through
[1:43:38] there's this climax there's this third
[1:43:40] pool there's was something that's that's
[1:43:42] coming he says now this is this is the
[1:43:47] time was when men are forsaken Paul said
[1:43:51] demas has forsaken me
[1:43:53] he shows how people are even saying
[1:43:55] brother man is all washed up do you
[1:43:59] think about this in 1962 when he's
[1:44:01] preaching presses take to my ministry
[1:44:03] he's been preaching this gospel for 30
[1:44:06] years
[1:44:08] no aina comprehend the toll now they
[1:44:12] have comprehend the tens of thousands of
[1:44:14] visions no way to even come close to
[1:44:16] having an idea what it's like and now
[1:44:19] for 30 years he's been preaching it and
[1:44:25] all of a sudden he's coming to a
[1:44:26] transition in his ministry which is
[1:44:29] going to be the crowning of his ministry
[1:44:31] it's going to be those seven seals it's
[1:44:36] going to be those mysterious thunders
[1:44:38] and now he reads this he says in verse 7
[1:44:43] verse 6 he says for I am now ready to be
[1:44:48] offered and the time of my departure is
[1:44:51] at hand I fought a good fight I finished
[1:44:54] my course I've kept the faith
[1:44:56] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:44:58] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[1:45:00] the righteous judge shall give me at
[1:45:02] that day and not to me only but unto all
[1:45:06] them also that love his appearing all
[1:45:11] I'm thankful what did the prophet of God
[1:45:14] point out II I believe it's an anointed
[1:45:16] ones at the end time he said who was it
[1:45:19] that appeared down there on the Ohio
[1:45:20] River
[1:45:21] who was it that appeared there in the
[1:45:23] Houston Coliseum in 1950 that wasn't me
[1:45:27] that was at the southern angel
[1:45:30] that was the son of man that was Christ
[1:45:32] oh we're living in the glorious time so
[1:45:36] simple but when you go through these
[1:45:38] revelations now when you go through the
[1:45:40] word only believe all things are
[1:45:43] possible
[1:45:44] does it have to be something big
[1:45:46] mysterious but maybe in saying this just
[1:45:52] to conclude half faith and who you are

[1:52:28] world even God will choose the people
[1:52:30] like us I don't know about you but I
[1:52:33] could say about myself tonight I could
[1:52:36] just look back and and see all this
[1:52:38] wonderful revelation all this wonderful
[1:52:42] mystery and this great things that
[1:52:44] people have gone to school to study and
[1:52:47] become theologians and and people just
[1:52:50] like in the Old Testament and in the
[1:52:52] time of Jesus they've dedicated their
[1:52:54] lives to robbing and and and born in the
[1:52:58] word and born in the churches and home
[1:53:00] of that but yet it will choose just such
[1:53:03] a a people from no word that it would
[1:53:06] reveal himself
[1:53:08] what is simplicity just it just makes me
[1:53:11] my heart just to sink in and just say Oh
[1:53:13] God
[1:53:14] I don't even know why me but I believe
[1:53:15] like our brother said I believe they
[1:53:18] said there's so much against us but all
[1:53:20] faith is for us tonight there's so much
[1:53:23] in the world you could look and try to
[1:53:25] add it all up and say it's absolutely no
[1:53:28] way but he chose you but I said it's you
[1:53:31] that I want you to understand this in
[1:53:33] all this mystery is me coming down and
[1:53:36] the sword and the revealing of the seven
[1:53:39] seals and and all the stings and all
[1:53:41] that not despising of the day all of
[1:53:43] those things is just for you let's just
[1:53:46] bar heads tonight our gracious father we
[1:53:49] shall dine for Lord
[1:53:56] to just come to a place or garden do you
[1:54:01] just hear what we heard tonight no
[1:54:03] garden how do you would call a messenger
[1:54:08] out of nowhere in how they you would
[1:54:12] choose him to come in to bring such a
[1:54:14] powerful message and be rejected by all
[1:54:18] the churches and that you had a
[1:54:22] predestinated group of people that you
[1:54:25] knew they would believe it
[1:54:27] but we feel like our life don't even
[1:54:31] come into the light of what you've given
[1:54:33] us but we believed in I
[1:54:38] but we believe Oh God and we pray Lord
[1:54:41] that the word will produce what you call
[1:54:46] that slaughter but we are sinless
[1:54:48] because you said we are sentence we are
[1:54:51] perfect because you said we are perfect
[1:54:54] whatever you said is what we hang on to
[1:54:56] is where we put our lives into Lord
[1:54:59] because we realize the insignificant
[1:55:01] that we are but we understand that it's
[1:55:07] the Creator who spoke the word and will
[1:55:10] believe it bless us tonight bless better
[1:55:12] Matthew as he brought forth the worded
[1:55:14] note for all of those that have heard it
