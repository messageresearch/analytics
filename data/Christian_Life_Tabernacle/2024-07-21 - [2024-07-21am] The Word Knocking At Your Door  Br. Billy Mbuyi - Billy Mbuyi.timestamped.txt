[54:49] amen amen let's open our Bibles this
[54:52] morning uh
[55:05] let's open our Bibles we'll read in uh
[55:08] Matthew chapter 8
[55:32] let's start from the fifth verse it says
[55:36] and when Jesus entered into
[55:38] kerum uh they came unto him a centurion
[55:41] besting him and saying lo my servant
[55:44] lith at home sick and of uh sick of the
[55:48] py and uh gely tormented and Jesus said
[55:52] unto him I will come and heal him the
[55:56] Centon answer and said
[55:58] Lord I'm not worthy that that should
[56:01] have come unto my roof man what a
[56:04] humility what a a place to be to of just
[56:08] an understanding even of our Humanity
[56:11] how that it's not supposed to be
[56:13] compatible with deity and and then he
[56:16] says but speak the speak the word only
[56:20] and my servant shall be healed for I am
[56:23] a man under Authority having soldiers
[56:25] under me
[56:27] and I say to this man go and he goeth
[56:29] and to another come and he cometh and to
[56:33] my servant do this and he do with it he
[56:36] said when Jesus heard it he marveled and
[56:39] he said to he said to them that followed
[56:42] verily I say unto you I have not found
[56:45] so so great faith no not in Israel and I
[56:49] say unto you that many shall
[56:52] come from east and west and shall sit
[56:56] down down with Abraham and Isaac and
[56:57] Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the
[57:00] children of the Kingdom shall be cast
[57:02] out uh out into the altar darkness and
[57:05] there shall be weeping and graning of
[57:08] teeth and it said and Jesus said unto
[57:10] the Centurion go thy way and as thou has
[57:14] believed so be it be done unto thee and
[57:18] his servant was healed in the selfsame
[57:21] houren let's also uh scroll or turn to
[57:26] uh Romans chapter
[57:29] 828 just some very familiar scripture
[57:33] reading it said and we know that all
[57:37] things work together for the good of
[57:40] them that love God man you love God this
[57:43] morning then all things has to work for
[57:46] the good to them that are they called
[57:49] according to his purpose for who he did
[57:53] for for new he also did predestinate to
[57:57] be conformed to the image of his son
[58:00] that he might be the firstborn among
[58:02] many Breen moreover whom he did
[58:04] predestinate them he also called and
[58:06] whom he called them he also Justified
[58:09] and whom he justified them he also
[58:11] glorified so he's doing the work little
[58:15] by little moving you from one stage to
[58:17] another bringing you into the Perfection
[58:20] again God's work not your work but God's
[58:23] word bringing into Perfection it says
[58:25] who said it says if God be for us who
[58:28] could be against us he that spareth not
[58:32] his own son but delivered him up for us
[58:36] all it says how shall how shall he not
[58:39] with him also freely give us all things
[58:43] it says who shall lay anything through
[58:46] the charge of God's elect it is God that
[58:50] justify who is he that condemned it is
[58:53] Christ that died yeah rather that is
[58:56] risen again who is even at the right
[59:00] hand of God who also maketh in
[59:03] intercession for us who shall separate
[59:06] us from the love of God shall
[59:10] tribulation or distress or persecution
[59:13] or famine or nakedness or Peril or or
[59:16] sword it says at as it is written for
[59:21] thy sake we are killed all day long we
[59:23] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[59:26] nay in all the things we are more than
[59:30] conqueror through him that loveth
[59:33] us father we ask that you bless your
[59:35] word through Us in the name of Jesus
[59:36] Christ we pray amen you may have your
[59:39] seats and as you are seated also turn
[59:41] your Bibles to Revelation chapter 3 uh
[59:45] we're going to read uh uh start from
[59:47] verse 14 it
[59:49] says and unto the angel of the Church of
[59:52] the aysia writes these things sayith the
[59:55] amen
[59:56] the faithful and the true witness the
[59:59] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[1:00:02] Thy
[1:00:03] works that thou are neither cold nor
[1:00:06] heart I would that thou would be cold or
[1:00:10] heart so then because thou are look warm
[1:00:14] and neither cold nor heart I will spew
[1:00:16] the out of my
[1:00:18] mouth because thou sayth I am rich and
[1:00:21] increased with good and have need of
[1:00:23] nothing and knoweth not that thou are
[1:00:25] rightous and miserable and poor and
[1:00:27] blind and naked I counsel Thee I counsel
[1:00:32] thee to buy of me gold tried in fire
[1:00:35] that thou mayest be rich white r r rment
[1:00:40] that thou mayest be closed and that the
[1:00:43] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:00:46] anoint thine eyes with thyself that thou
[1:00:49] mayest see as many as I love I rebuke I
[1:00:53] chasen be zealous therefore and repent
[1:00:57] behold I stand at the door and knock and
[1:01:00] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:01:03] door I will come in and will s with him
[1:01:07] and him with
[1:01:10] me uh so for just a a a short while here
[1:01:18] I I want to speak
[1:01:20] on the word knocking knocking at your
[1:01:23] door and and for a theme uh I just want
[1:01:27] to uh uh a reoccurring them that I'll be
[1:01:30] touching on is the
[1:01:33] authority of his word the
[1:01:36] authority of his word so as we read you
[1:01:41] I want to say this we as Believers we
[1:01:44] recognize that the word of God is the
[1:01:47] supreme authority the word of God is the
[1:01:50] absolute for the believer so when the
[1:01:53] word speaks we know that that's the end
[1:01:55] of the matter matter there are no
[1:01:56] questions to be asked and we spoke about
[1:01:59] this last time and we even as the the
[1:02:02] Bible will say in John chapter one that
[1:02:04] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:02:06] was with God the Word was God and all
[1:02:09] things that were created were created by
[1:02:12] the word of God and we understand that
[1:02:14] it starts with the word of God it ends
[1:02:16] with the word of God and anything in
[1:02:19] between will pass away if it if it
[1:02:21] wasn't the word in the beginning it will
[1:02:23] not last if it wasn't the word it will
[1:02:26] not come to an end and and the prophet
[1:02:28] will tell us that the word is the
[1:02:31] expression of God thoughts that he had
[1:02:33] in the beginning and today we are seeing
[1:02:36] that expression being manifested so as
[1:02:39] we we we look at the word of God we see
[1:02:42] foram will say that the spoken word is
[1:02:45] the Original Seed so the the the the the
[1:02:48] the very word of God is the seed of God
[1:02:51] that was so in the beginning that we see
[1:02:53] today so if it's not part of the The
[1:02:56] Original Seed it's not going to last and
[1:02:58] Satan we know throughout the ages or
[1:03:01] throughout Main's history what he's
[1:03:03] always tried to do is to inject uh uh uh
[1:03:06] things in the word of God and make it of
[1:03:08] non effect is to inject tradition to
[1:03:11] inject man's thinking to inject
[1:03:13] something that will cause the word not
[1:03:16] to produce what God wants it to produce
[1:03:18] but we understand that if you have the
[1:03:20] original word you would have the
[1:03:22] original results if you have the
[1:03:24] original word you will have the original
[1:03:27] intent of God manifested in your life so
[1:03:31] as we read about this servant we just
[1:03:33] read he I want you to just realize his
[1:03:36] approached to the word of God so he came
[1:03:39] and this Roman Centurion he came and and
[1:03:42] as we read he came he had one of his
[1:03:44] servant that was sick and no doubt that
[1:03:46] he loved the servant he was one that was
[1:03:48] dear to him and he wanted to see him
[1:03:50] healed that he would not send another
[1:03:53] servant to call call Upon Jesus but he
[1:03:55] was take time to go himself because this
[1:03:58] was a beloved servant of him he will
[1:04:00] stand up and he will go and he will come
[1:04:03] to Jesus and as he show as he comes he
[1:04:06] he and when he begins to speak there's a
[1:04:08] way you you you look at it and you see
[1:04:11] that he recognizes that Jesus had the
[1:04:14] power in his words amen he now he when
[1:04:18] he comes to Jesus he recognized that
[1:04:20] this man has the power in what he's
[1:04:23] saying in other word when this man
[1:04:25] speaks something happened this man is
[1:04:28] not just speaking Fain words he just not
[1:04:31] uh uh H H uh speaking wisdom to man is
[1:04:34] not not just speaking some intellectual
[1:04:37] ideas or another way of thinking but in
[1:04:40] his words when he speaks something
[1:04:43] happened and and no doubt they had a
[1:04:45] testimony that perhaps he heard about
[1:04:48] those that were healed they heard about
[1:04:49] those that were raised from the dead and
[1:04:52] and he knew that if Jesus would speak a
[1:04:54] word that Jesus had the power to cast
[1:04:57] out demons that Jesus had the power to
[1:05:00] change circumstances that Jesus words
[1:05:04] has the power had the power of creation
[1:05:07] and therefore he humbled himself before
[1:05:10] the word and said that I know that the
[1:05:12] power that you hold me being a man under
[1:05:15] Authority me uh having the understanding
[1:05:18] of what the structure of authority is
[1:05:21] that I have servants if I will say go
[1:05:23] here they will go I have one that is uh
[1:05:26] uh uh uh under me that I'll tell him go
[1:05:29] do this they'll go do that I have an
[1:05:32] understanding by what I see from you
[1:05:34] that if you will just say one word it
[1:05:37] will come to pass and I want to say this
[1:05:40] if this man could come and believe that
[1:05:42] the word of God the word spoken by Jesus
[1:05:45] can help him how much more as the sons
[1:05:48] and the daughters of God how much more
[1:05:50] we come through the house of the Living
[1:05:52] God we hear the word of God day in and
[1:05:55] day out and I want to say this this
[1:05:57] Faith was manifested in the Bible calls
[1:06:00] it the faith of the Gentile because when
[1:06:03] Jesus turned around they looked at him
[1:06:05] and said I have not seen such Faith No
[1:06:08] not in Israel so this Faith was
[1:06:10] characterized as the faith of the
[1:06:12] Gentile and if you go read the prophet
[1:06:15] will speak and he said the Jews had the
[1:06:17] custom that they they were custom to the
[1:06:20] laying of the hands and they believe
[1:06:22] that things will happen even just if you
[1:06:24] were to touch and one will be healed if
[1:06:26] you were to lay hands on them and pray
[1:06:28] for them but yet the Gentile they
[1:06:31] exhibited a certain type of faith that
[1:06:33] was really not found in Israel so as
[1:06:36] this man came he had came and he
[1:06:39] believed that if he could come and Jesus
[1:06:41] will speak the word that his servant
[1:06:44] will be healed so he believed that if
[1:06:46] Jesus word had the power then there had
[1:06:49] to be something that if the believer
[1:06:51] will believe it if he would speak and I
[1:06:53] will believe it something will come to
[1:06:55] pass and remember as we read the
[1:06:57] scripture he said that this same Faith
[1:07:00] was to be manifested he says there will
[1:07:03] be those that will come from the East
[1:07:05] and there will be those that will come
[1:07:06] from the West that will be seated at the
[1:07:08] feet of Abraham they would manifest the
[1:07:11] same exact faith and I want to say to us
[1:07:14] this morning we are called to believe
[1:07:16] the word of God that it would help us in
[1:07:19] our times of need we are called to
[1:07:21] believe and when the word is spoken when
[1:07:24] Jesus speaks and when we come to the
[1:07:26] house of God we hear the word of God we
[1:07:29] are those that are called to believe
[1:07:31] that what we are hearing will help us in
[1:07:33] the situation that we are going through
[1:07:36] amen let me say this if Jesus words has
[1:07:39] power that when the Centurion came and
[1:07:42] this Roman Centurion will come and Jesus
[1:07:45] will speak and the servant will be well
[1:07:47] how much more this morning because we
[1:07:49] know that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:07:51] yesterday today and forever his words
[1:07:54] have not changed
[1:07:56] his power is not changed if that same
[1:07:58] Jesus spoke we are sitting here this
[1:08:01] morning reading the same word of that
[1:08:03] same Jesus reading the same word the
[1:08:06] same Jesus spoke and if he spoke the
[1:08:08] Centurion servant felt well how much
[1:08:11] more this morning we ought to believe
[1:08:12] that that same power is in the house of
[1:08:16] God don't we we we we have to be careful
[1:08:20] because often time people feel like oh I
[1:08:23] need the word of God I hear the word of
[1:08:26] God but I need something more than the
[1:08:27] word of God let me say there's nothing
[1:08:30] more than the word of God the word of
[1:08:32] God is the final say the word of God is
[1:08:35] what brings the result you say you
[1:08:37] preach about the word every time there's
[1:08:39] nothing else to preach about except the
[1:08:41] word of God oh if we would get the word
[1:08:45] of God and by Revelation really believe
[1:08:47] it it would bring about the change that
[1:08:49] God has
[1:08:51] promised butam will say in the message
[1:08:54] life is the Healer
[1:08:56] uh preaching 57 he will say the idea is
[1:08:59] not to touch is it isn't to touch me now
[1:09:03] speaking about himself but it's to touch
[1:09:06] him he says now America it's very hard
[1:09:10] to get into them it says they are used
[1:09:13] to people laying their hands on them and
[1:09:15] that's right but that was the old Jew
[1:09:18] custom but the gentle custom was I'm not
[1:09:22] worthy that for you to come under my
[1:09:25] roof so he's saying now the Gentile we
[1:09:28] that are sitting here this morning that
[1:09:30] have been identified by the word of God
[1:09:32] as the G Gentile butam is saying that
[1:09:36] you have to have an approach you and and
[1:09:39] in you was manifested an approach that
[1:09:42] was never manifested to the Jew in you
[1:09:45] there was an approach that you were not
[1:09:47] born when the prophet was here you you
[1:09:49] only heard the Ts for you to hear you
[1:09:52] didn't see brother Bram with your own
[1:09:53] eyes you didn't touch brother R them
[1:09:55] with your own eyes but yet within you
[1:09:58] God has placed an attribute of faith
[1:10:00] that you will hear the word of God this
[1:10:02] morning and you will believe
[1:10:05] it let me not never forget that that's
[1:10:08] the very Foundation of what you are
[1:10:10] built upon people go into great meetings
[1:10:13] and they go to great places they think
[1:10:15] that it's the preacher that packs the
[1:10:17] healing it's the preacher that packs the
[1:10:18] Deliverance but what says that healing
[1:10:21] is already in you healing is already in
[1:10:24] The Believer the delance is already in
[1:10:26] The Believer all the attributes of God
[1:10:29] if you are a son of God are already in
[1:10:32] you what we are looking for is for God
[1:10:34] to Quicken the faith for us to believe
[1:10:37] that the work is already done let me say
[1:10:40] this this morning when God gives his
[1:10:42] word it's a finished work it's not a
[1:10:45] work that needs for you to add anything
[1:10:46] to it what we are called upon is to
[1:10:49] believe upon the finished work of
[1:10:51] Calvary and know that he who spoke the
[1:10:53] word is here to bring the word
[1:10:56] reality the Gentile Faith so he comes in
[1:11:01] and he says that's not what the Jews or
[1:11:04] what that's not what the Gentile the
[1:11:06] that says I'm not worthy that you should
[1:11:08] come under my roof just speak the word
[1:11:11] and my servant will leave listen to this
[1:11:13] he knew that the authority of the word
[1:11:17] cuz he knew the authority of the word
[1:11:20] cuz he had because he said he was a man
[1:11:24] under Authority let me say this today if
[1:11:28] you have children if you have those and
[1:11:30] young ones and whatever you understand
[1:11:32] that when you say something they would
[1:11:34] have to obey you understand that if you
[1:11:38] work in a company if you are told
[1:11:39] something to do you would have to obey
[1:11:42] you understand that there's a structure
[1:11:44] to Authority for those that are in the
[1:11:46] military they understand it perfectly
[1:11:48] you are told to obey and not even to ask
[1:11:51] questions God is wanting us the children
[1:11:54] of God to be trained that's why he said
[1:11:57] we are not in the picnic we are in the
[1:11:59] army of God so in the army of God is
[1:12:01] training is believing children not to
[1:12:04] have doubts on their mind not to be the
[1:12:06] one that have questions not to question
[1:12:09] the word of God to come under such
[1:12:11] Authority and understanding of the
[1:12:14] structure of authority that when the
[1:12:16] word speaks it's done it doesn't matter
[1:12:19] how many symptoms I have it doesn't
[1:12:21] matter whether I understand what the
[1:12:23] word says or don't understand but when
[1:12:25] the word speaks it's all and done so the
[1:12:29] approach is is is never changed it's the
[1:12:32] same yesterday today and forever it's
[1:12:34] not that you come and and God has a
[1:12:37] different approach God is the same
[1:12:39] yesterday today and forever it's the
[1:12:41] devil that tries to confuse you that
[1:12:44] this is not going to work you need to
[1:12:45] change your approach no we approach God
[1:12:48] by one thing and one thing alone and
[1:12:50] that is by faith faith is the only
[1:12:52] instrument that's given to the believer
[1:12:55] to touch God and it says those that come
[1:12:58] must believe that is the rewarder of
[1:13:00] them that diligently seek upon him and
[1:13:03] the scripture says that without faith we
[1:13:05] cannot please God that's right amen so
[1:13:08] if we have a need this morning we look
[1:13:11] for the answer in the word of God we
[1:13:14] stand upon the word of God and the word
[1:13:17] the spoken word will produce the
[1:13:20] result so the word has spoken and as far
[1:13:24] as a Believer is Con concern it's done I
[1:13:26] have no questions about it the symptoms
[1:13:29] may be there I may not see it in the
[1:13:31] flesh as it spoke Wednesday it's the
[1:13:34] matter of a heart what I'm looking for
[1:13:36] is God to work within my heart is God to
[1:13:39] place within my heart a peace that
[1:13:41] surpasses understanding is for God to
[1:13:44] come and change my heart therefore I
[1:13:46] don't care what happened in the natural
[1:13:48] I know that he as long as my heart
[1:13:51] believe him he will bring it to come to
[1:13:53] place in my flesh amen
[1:13:57] amen oh this morning let me say this if
[1:14:02] we can only believe the authority of the
[1:14:06] word of God or if we can only believe
[1:14:11] the authority of the word of God the
[1:14:13] word of God is what brought everything
[1:14:16] into existence and it's the word of God
[1:14:19] that will bring you into the image of
[1:14:21] God the word of God when we are
[1:14:24] challenged when things are not going
[1:14:26] well what we do is we begin to confess
[1:14:30] what the word said we will be when
[1:14:32] things are not working when you feel
[1:14:34] like you're falling down you feel like
[1:14:36] you're not making it what you need to do
[1:14:38] is to begin to confess the word of God
[1:14:41] because the word of God is what has the
[1:14:44] power to change whatever circumstance is
[1:14:47] to bring it into the word of God so if
[1:14:49] we are believers then we have to believe
[1:14:52] the authority of what the word of God
[1:14:54] say said the word of God said we are
[1:14:57] seated in Heavenly places right now not
[1:15:01] tomorrow not yesterday but right now we
[1:15:05] are seated in Heavenly places now I
[1:15:07] don't care if you feel like you're
[1:15:09] sitting on the Pew I don't care if your
[1:15:12] sight tells you you're sitting on the
[1:15:13] Pew but if the word of God said you are
[1:15:15] seated in Heavenly places I believe the
[1:15:18] word of God more than what my eyes see I
[1:15:21] believe the word of God more than my my
[1:15:24] own feeling
[1:15:25] and in fact says you got to come to a
[1:15:28] place where you doubt your own doubt
[1:15:31] where you take your own doubt and say I
[1:15:33] don't believe this I believe what the
[1:15:35] word says if God said I'm Healed
[1:15:37] therefore I'm
[1:15:40] Healed thank and let me say this only
[1:15:45] the word of God is true and every man's
[1:15:48] word is Al
[1:15:51] liive what a privileged people we are
[1:15:54] this morning
[1:15:55] that's why the prophet will say we live
[1:15:57] so much under our under the priv under
[1:16:00] our privileges because what we need is
[1:16:02] to elevate the word of God in the lives
[1:16:05] what we need is to believe more of his
[1:16:07] word so we can see more of his
[1:16:09] manifestation the enemy is trying for
[1:16:12] you to take the word and mix it with
[1:16:14] with feelings and with understanding and
[1:16:17] with with the with intellect and all of
[1:16:19] that and that's why it's not producing
[1:16:21] the result but what God is looking for
[1:16:24] is a people that will believe that if I
[1:16:26] stand upon the word of God it will
[1:16:28] produce what God called it to produce
[1:16:32] amen so now he continues on he says so
[1:16:36] now that's why we are that's why we are
[1:16:39] giv that's why we give out prayer cards
[1:16:43] but says the same quote
[1:16:47] everyone can everyone that can have
[1:16:50] everyone can have one each night as the
[1:16:53] boys give them out
[1:16:56] it says and
[1:16:58] now now the main thing if you could put
[1:17:01] it up the same quote I was reading the
[1:17:04] main thing is to
[1:17:07] sit open with an open heart and
[1:17:10] say Lord Jesus I believe
[1:17:15] you and I have challenged your faith and
[1:17:17] I challenge your faith but whatam says
[1:17:21] you see what happens if you will do that
[1:17:24] from the deps of your soul not from your
[1:17:27] intellect from the depths of your soul
[1:17:30] just take everything away from you say
[1:17:33] Lord I
[1:17:35] believe now I have no way at all of
[1:17:39] knowing who's who and what is what is's
[1:17:42] going to say but he does it himself it's
[1:17:47] the sovereignty it says it's it that's a
[1:17:50] sovereignty I can't make it work so
[1:17:53] that's that that would be telepathy it
[1:17:56] isn't that I make it work it makes it
[1:18:00] works me amen I don't work it so I just
[1:18:04] look live and believe oh if we can come
[1:18:08] this morning and say I just I just look
[1:18:12] I just look I live and I believe he says
[1:18:16] it I go I put it in practice he says it
[1:18:19] I walk by it I believe it I do
[1:18:21] everything that I know as long as I'm
[1:18:23] obeying and walking by the word of God I
[1:18:26] know he's going to take care of it so he
[1:18:28] says we have seen and I want to say this
[1:18:31] in the generation that we are living in
[1:18:33] we can truly say that we have seen a son
[1:18:36] under Authority I I was thinking about
[1:18:39] this and yes Jesus exhibiting the
[1:18:42] authority of God's word and he will
[1:18:44] stand there we know that Jesus was the
[1:18:47] word and he will stand there and he will
[1:18:49] speak and it will come to pass and the
[1:18:51] same God when he when it came time for
[1:18:53] the manifestation of the son of man we
[1:18:56] can say that we have seen one who was
[1:18:58] surrendered completely into the hands of
[1:19:01] God one who was a member of the Bride
[1:19:04] because I think that's important often
[1:19:07] time as people we tend to take Bon him
[1:19:10] and put him in the in the prophet
[1:19:12] bracket that is true but we also have to
[1:19:15] understand that him being a prophet was
[1:19:17] also member of the Bride because it was
[1:19:20] the she wave offering as we we've been
[1:19:22] told that what happened and the things
[1:19:25] that he did as as the Church of the
[1:19:27] Living God he was one of the first to
[1:19:30] come forth in maturity that we have
[1:19:33] something to look forward to that if we
[1:19:35] come under the same Authority if we will
[1:19:38] surrender the same way the same word God
[1:19:41] can work with us let me say this God
[1:19:43] didn't call us to just be Beggars and
[1:19:46] and those that will continually just oh
[1:19:48] God help me oh God no God is looking for
[1:19:51] people to come to maturity those that
[1:19:54] will take the word of God and bring it
[1:19:57] to pass in their life those that will
[1:19:59] take the word and know that I have been
[1:20:01] made for this moment I have been made
[1:20:03] for this circumstances not one that will
[1:20:06] say oh let me call the pastor let me
[1:20:08] call this no but one who can stand and
[1:20:10] say that I have been put under Authority
[1:20:14] I have been given the authority of the
[1:20:16] word of God to speak the word and know
[1:20:19] that God will back me up amen thank you
[1:20:22] Jes thank that's where we moving to so
[1:20:26] we we as the children of God we have to
[1:20:28] understand God wants us to be completely
[1:20:31] reliant on him and so if we saw one that
[1:20:34] came and he spake the word and he said
[1:20:37] oh I take every spirit in this room
[1:20:39] under my control let me say there no man
[1:20:42] has ever spoken like that except the
[1:20:44] Lord Jesus one that can speak with
[1:20:46] authority and know that when I speak it
[1:20:49] has to be the spirit of Jesus Christ and
[1:20:52] let me say this the same Spirit of Jesus
[1:20:54] Jesus Christ is in the bride today it's
[1:20:57] in the bride today that we can say I
[1:20:59] don't care what's happening I'm taking
[1:21:01] control of my own body I'm taking
[1:21:04] control of my own circumstances and the
[1:21:07] same God will come to my assistance we
[1:21:10] have seen one spoke squirrel into
[1:21:12] existence we have seen one speak to
[1:21:14] Nature and nature
[1:21:17] obey and you think he cannot make it so
[1:21:21] you can come to church yeah when you
[1:21:24] want to
[1:21:25] go you think he cannot make a way for
[1:21:28] you to have food on your table when you
[1:21:30] need it you think he cannot come and and
[1:21:34] and put clothes on your back and put
[1:21:36] food on your table and provide for your
[1:21:38] daily need now remember when bam raised
[1:21:42] the little fish bam told us that God
[1:21:44] said it and he spoke to him when he did
[1:21:47] it is he saw that he can show his people
[1:21:49] and his children that God cares even
[1:21:52] about the small things he cares even
[1:21:54] about the little thing he's the god
[1:21:56] overall so if he cares about the fish if
[1:21:59] he feeds the birds and and all the the
[1:22:02] animal kingdom he looked at job and he
[1:22:05] says how does the lion get his food when
[1:22:08] he cries out for his food who give him
[1:22:10] food now if you can do all of that how
[1:22:13] much more we that are created In His
[1:22:15] Image in his likeness how that we we we
[1:22:18] have needs and the God is not going to
[1:22:20] answer to our needs yes sir oh brother
[1:22:23] sister we have we have to come under the
[1:22:25] authority of the word we have to
[1:22:28] surrender all and say God I'll take your
[1:22:30] word despise few I'll take if I go
[1:22:33] hungry taking your word I'll go hungry
[1:22:36] believing your word the reason is we're
[1:22:39] not we're not willing to go all the way
[1:22:42] we are scared that if we do we're going
[1:22:43] to fall no if you fall it's going to
[1:22:46] catch
[1:22:47] you it's just on the other side waiting
[1:22:50] for you the problem is we don't want to
[1:22:52] take the liap of faith we don't want to
[1:22:54] launch out we're scared if we do
[1:22:57] something is going to happen let me say
[1:22:59] this that's why I read the scripture all
[1:23:01] is things work together for the good of
[1:23:03] them that
[1:23:04] love we have to come with an
[1:23:07] understanding with a belief that if I
[1:23:09] take him at his word he will make my
[1:23:11] life come to pass according to his will
[1:23:15] amen the prophet will say in the message
[1:23:18] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:23:21] and forever preaching 63
[1:23:25] and and now he's
[1:23:28] comparing the the story of uh gyus
[1:23:31] daughter with with this
[1:23:34] Centurion and paragraph
[1:23:37] 254 he says this he says gyus said come
[1:23:42] lay hands on my daughter and she will
[1:23:45] live but the Roman the Gentile said I'm
[1:23:49] not I'm not worthy that you should come
[1:23:51] under my roof I I tell you every time
[1:23:54] time you come closer to the word of God
[1:23:56] that's the feeling it's like Lord the
[1:23:58] flesh feels is not worthy but let me say
[1:24:01] this you're not coming by yourself it's
[1:24:03] his invitation to you he's telling you
[1:24:05] come unto me ye that are heavy laden he
[1:24:08] that wants to change your circumstance
[1:24:11] he that wants to worship me he that
[1:24:13] wants to live come unto me and I will
[1:24:15] give you rest so he says but the Roman
[1:24:19] the Gentile said I'm not worthy that you
[1:24:22] should come under my roof he says just
[1:24:24] speak the word he says is just speak the
[1:24:28] word is that right it says the the it is
[1:24:31] the spoken
[1:24:33] word it is the word spoken the gentille
[1:24:36] see we should carry out that if the
[1:24:40] Roman if the Roman it says if the Roman
[1:24:44] could think of that and the he and the
[1:24:47] Heathen think about that and the Heathen
[1:24:51] that had just seen him cuz he know know
[1:24:55] that Jesus words he said a man under
[1:25:00] Authority I say to this man goeth and he
[1:25:04] goeth and to that one come and and and
[1:25:07] and and come he that he has two cuz he
[1:25:11] is under me it says what what what was
[1:25:14] his ident his identifying that every
[1:25:17] sickness and every disease was under the
[1:25:20] Commandment of Jesus Christ yes sir he
[1:25:24] had the authority so it's the
[1:25:27] application and understanding that Jesus
[1:25:30] was have the authority to make the
[1:25:32] change is that as believing children and
[1:25:35] Son of God this was a heathen he didn't
[1:25:38] come as a son and the daughter of God he
[1:25:40] was one who just understood the
[1:25:42] structure of authority and he received
[1:25:45] the benefit of it and here me say that
[1:25:48] how about us children of God yeah we are
[1:25:50] Sons and Daughters God creating how can
[1:25:53] we not understand the same structure
[1:25:55] that exists in the kingdom of God that
[1:25:58] Jesus Christ let me say this the devil
[1:26:00] is not greater than God your challenges
[1:26:03] are not greater than God your trials are
[1:26:06] not greater than God God is the creator
[1:26:09] of it all in fact but when says that God
[1:26:12] harnesses trouble and puts it bits in
[1:26:15] his mouth to come after you but the same
[1:26:17] God can come and say you Satan I cast
[1:26:20] you forth get out of here remember the
[1:26:23] Satan could not touch job unless God
[1:26:26] allowed him he was specifically told
[1:26:29] what he could do and what he could not
[1:26:30] do and that's your father that we're
[1:26:32] talking about this
[1:26:36] morning Blind by marus preaching 57 he
[1:26:40] says the Romans said I'm not worthy that
[1:26:43] you'd come under my roof but I'm a man
[1:26:46] with authority when I say to this
[1:26:49] Soldier go go through that he goeth
[1:26:52] because he is under my authority
[1:26:57] and I say to this
[1:26:59] one you do
[1:27:01] this you go do this and he does
[1:27:08] it because he has to obey me he's under
[1:27:11] me it says what was the Roman doing he
[1:27:16] was
[1:27:17] recognizing the Supreme deity of Jesus
[1:27:21] Christ
[1:27:24] he was
[1:27:25] recognizing that this man has deity
[1:27:29] abiding in him oh I tell you when they
[1:27:32] spoke about brother Bram they had
[1:27:34] questions about everything that he
[1:27:36] preached oh that that's crazy what
[1:27:38] you're preaching over here that's crazy
[1:27:39] we don't understand they said how could
[1:27:41] you say this how could you but one thing
[1:27:43] they couldn't question was that when he
[1:27:45] stood there and he spoke when he said
[1:27:48] God came and backed it
[1:27:51] up one thing they couldn't question was
[1:27:54] that this man when he spoke it came to
[1:27:56] happen they didn't understand his
[1:27:58] Doctrine in fact they told him that you
[1:28:00] just don't know your Bible and he looks
[1:28:02] at them and says I may not know my Bible
[1:28:04] but I know the Creator real well oh I
[1:28:07] want to say this morning there has to be
[1:28:09] a people if he was the chief wave
[1:28:12] offering we may not know all the Bible
[1:28:14] but we know the author real
[1:28:17] well the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ
[1:28:21] and the prophet tells us that deity is
[1:28:24] is in you
[1:28:25] tonight let me say this it's either this
[1:28:28] message is the word of God or it's not
[1:28:30] the word of God it cannot be anything
[1:28:32] between and if he says that you are
[1:28:35] deity is in you then by the authority of
[1:28:38] the word that deity real is in
[1:28:41] you oh let let's go let's stop about the
[1:28:45] questioning of our flesh and our
[1:28:46] thinking and all of that that's never
[1:28:48] going to take you anywhere it's only
[1:28:50] going to bring doubt upon doubt upon
[1:28:52] doubt what God is looking for from his
[1:28:55] children is you have heard the word of
[1:28:57] God if the word calls you son you claim
[1:29:00] and say I am a son if the word says that
[1:29:03] deity is in you I don't care I don't
[1:29:06] care if I don't see it I just know if
[1:29:08] the word said it the word will put it
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:14] there and he says
[1:29:18] see he said you just speak the word and
[1:29:23] my servant will live
[1:29:27] what did Jesus said now I've never seen
[1:29:30] Faith like this in
[1:29:32] Israel it says that's what I'm trying to
[1:29:36] get you
[1:29:37] people Christ is here so believe
[1:29:41] it it's that simple Christ is here how
[1:29:45] many believe Christ is here in this
[1:29:47] building he's here because you brought
[1:29:49] him here it's not because of the empty
[1:29:51] building the seed of God remains in the
[1:29:54] sons of God the seed you have to believe
[1:29:57] that as you came here Christ is in you
[1:30:00] he's doing the good works that he
[1:30:01] promise he's here to work everything out
[1:30:04] for your good he's here to work in you
[1:30:07] so he can bring you in the image that he
[1:30:08] wants you to do he's here to bring his
[1:30:11] word a reality to you he he's not in
[1:30:14] heaven just sitting up there looking
[1:30:15] down at you no the scripture said that
[1:30:18] all that was in Christ he poured it into
[1:30:20] his church and we have to come here and
[1:30:22] know that every single one of us packs a
[1:30:26] a part of Christ and as together we come
[1:30:29] we bring forth his
[1:30:32] fullness
[1:30:35] thank so we understand when we preach
[1:30:38] this morning the purpose is to try to
[1:30:42] bring us into this reality of the Living
[1:30:44] God because only by the promises that
[1:30:47] God made we can understand where we are
[1:30:51] what what what what we are called to be
[1:30:53] and coming to the place where we
[1:30:55] understand that God he he he's not just
[1:30:59] doing things half-hazard that we are
[1:31:01] even in this building this morning
[1:31:03] sitting here for a purpose the prophet
[1:31:05] will speak and he will say that it's
[1:31:08] truly as as Believers we have to
[1:31:11] understand that we we we we're not
[1:31:13] gathered
[1:31:14] here to fulfill some men's idea we've
[1:31:18] gathered here and and this is the thing
[1:31:21] that I always find and and and I I think
[1:31:25] it's always important even as we move
[1:31:27] along for us to every time consider the
[1:31:31] things that God is doing we you couldn't
[1:31:33] have the diversity we have in this
[1:31:36] building this morning outside of the
[1:31:39] word of
[1:31:41] God if don't ever forget that because
[1:31:45] those are the very uh things that that
[1:31:48] will help you understand that it's God
[1:31:51] who's putting this together the very
[1:31:53] diversity we we have different taste we
[1:31:56] have different Hobbies we have different
[1:31:59] uh uh uh uh uh uh need we have all kind
[1:32:02] the the only person who could place this
[1:32:05] together this morning is
[1:32:07] God we there there's not a million
[1:32:10] chance that we could be gathered in the
[1:32:12] same room the the only reason the the
[1:32:15] single reason we are gathered together
[1:32:18] this morning from all the countries from
[1:32:20] everywhere is because God wants us to be
[1:32:23] here this morning now if you can
[1:32:26] understand that then it will help you to
[1:32:28] understand that if the authority of God
[1:32:30] made that happen the authority of God is
[1:32:33] here to impart to you what you have need
[1:32:35] of this
[1:32:37] morning it's his authority it's his
[1:32:40] doing it's his promise it's his
[1:32:43] Gathering it's him doing the
[1:32:45] [Applause]
[1:32:46] work the the challenge is that's why we
[1:32:49] read the other time said the hardest
[1:32:52] thing for men to do is to believe in out
[1:32:54] of man and let me see even say this I'm
[1:32:56] not adding to the word but the hardest
[1:32:58] thing for man is even to believe
[1:33:01] himself that's right to believe that I
[1:33:04] have been called oh I tell you I look at
[1:33:07] myself in the mirror every day I go
[1:33:09] there's no way I could be called but
[1:33:11] it's not my thinking it's not what I
[1:33:14] want or don't want it's God's purpose
[1:33:17] it's the authority of the word bringing
[1:33:20] forth what God wants to bring forth
[1:33:22] hallelujah thank you he called Moses
[1:33:25] Moses had a lot of excuses I can't speak
[1:33:28] I can't do this I can't after he's done
[1:33:31] all of that God said that's exactly what
[1:33:34] I was looking
[1:33:36] for I wasn't looking for your abilities
[1:33:39] I wasn't looking for your understanding
[1:33:41] I just needed a man and I say oh I just
[1:33:44] want to be a man this morning I just
[1:33:46] want to be a vessel this morning that
[1:33:48] will receive the word of God so there
[1:33:50] has to be if we believe the authority of
[1:33:53] God this morning the authority of the
[1:33:55] word then a True Believer has to
[1:33:58] understand that life the life that we
[1:34:00] have within our flesh was given to us by
[1:34:03] God how many believe that Eve said I
[1:34:06] have received a man of the Lord so we
[1:34:09] answer the very natural life we can
[1:34:11] certainly say without an excuse that it
[1:34:14] came from God and and God gave us the
[1:34:18] natural life for a purpose and we
[1:34:21] understand if by the same token that
[1:34:23] that this this natural life when this
[1:34:25] natural life is over that's not the end
[1:34:27] of the believer that's right you still
[1:34:30] with me don't don't get lost now so if
[1:34:34] we I'm speaking about the authority of
[1:34:36] the word so if we understand this
[1:34:38] natural life was given to us then we
[1:34:41] understand when this natural life is
[1:34:43] over it's not the end of us there's
[1:34:45] another life waiting now that but the
[1:34:48] only way to obtain to that Idol life
[1:34:50] when we go don't don't forget this we we
[1:34:53] going to give an account for the natural
[1:34:55] life that was given to
[1:34:57] us every minute of it every second of it
[1:35:02] what did we spend it on what did we do
[1:35:04] with it but makes a statement somewhere
[1:35:06] says if God gave us this natural life
[1:35:09] then we need to ask ourselves why did he
[1:35:12] give me this natural life and if I put
[1:35:14] it to the use that he wanted me to put
[1:35:17] it because if we're not careful then we
[1:35:20] run into circumstance where everything
[1:35:23] that we do we do for this flesh let me
[1:35:25] say this we are made to be more than
[1:35:28] just the flesh we are made to live for
[1:35:31] God we are made that we may live for him
[1:35:35] this life that was given to you was made
[1:35:38] so you can live it for the life to come
[1:35:40] not so you can squander it just for the
[1:35:43] natural things and this is the authority
[1:35:45] of that same word is telling you this
[1:35:47] morning do not focus the natural life to
[1:35:50] the Natural things but take the natural
[1:35:53] life and focus it on the Heavenly things
[1:35:56] because that's the purpose the life was
[1:35:58] given for so we understand that this
[1:36:01] natural life is over we are going to
[1:36:04] give an account for it so so we don't we
[1:36:07] we we don't believe that we'll be
[1:36:09] partakers or or or we'll be partakers of
[1:36:13] the death as the world will be partakers
[1:36:15] of the death but we
[1:36:17] believe excuse me
[1:36:25] but we believe that when this life is
[1:36:27] over we will have the eternal life so
[1:36:31] let me ask you this question then I
[1:36:34] don't know how many of us will be
[1:36:35] comfortable when we're give an account
[1:36:38] for this life to talk about how many
[1:36:40] jobs we had oh God you know there on
[1:36:43] Earth I had five jobs you know I bought
[1:36:46] 20
[1:36:47] houses oh you know I bought I bought the
[1:36:50] biggest car or I now even you yourself
[1:36:54] saying that sounds like that's really
[1:36:57] not the use for this life your your own
[1:37:00] Spirit within you right now will testify
[1:37:03] to yourself that that's not what this
[1:37:05] life was given to
[1:37:07] you no I'm not talking just you yourself
[1:37:11] if you are honest with yourself you will
[1:37:14] account this morning that am I really is
[1:37:17] this life really given to me so I can do
[1:37:20] those things now I that's why I said
[1:37:23] this morning it's important we realize
[1:37:25] that God knows that we need bread God
[1:37:27] knows that we need clothing he knows we
[1:37:30] need those things but we shouldn't take
[1:37:32] ourselves and put ourselves outside of
[1:37:35] the word of God in order to fulfill the
[1:37:37] natural need what he's wanting us to do
[1:37:39] is to take his word for every challenge
[1:37:42] that we have if you need bread God will
[1:37:45] provide bread you need clothing God will
[1:37:47] provide clothing whatever you need God
[1:37:50] will provide as long as you live this
[1:37:53] life for the life to
[1:37:55] come than
[1:37:58] thank we we cannot be toast side and and
[1:38:03] and and and and be moved by every
[1:38:06] opportunity that comes around the corner
[1:38:08] oh you're going to make few more dollars
[1:38:11] you run for the
[1:38:13] dollars oh if you leave that job after a
[1:38:17] year or two you're going to get more
[1:38:18] money over the side you run over here
[1:38:22] but you are forg getting the very main
[1:38:25] thing that the life was given to you
[1:38:29] for the scripture has an example about
[1:38:31] the rich man who built bonds and and he
[1:38:35] is is he his bones grew and he had more
[1:38:38] well more good and and he went and built
[1:38:40] bigger bars and the scripture says and
[1:38:43] and he said oh I have so much I'll just
[1:38:45] go lay down and rest and now I have to
[1:38:47] work anymore the scripture says that
[1:38:49] same night God spoke to him and says
[1:38:52] fools your soul what if your soul is
[1:38:54] required of you
[1:38:55] tonight so you understand by taking our
[1:38:59] lives and and just running around with
[1:39:02] it in trying to achieve the things of
[1:39:04] the world it's not God knows we know we
[1:39:08] need an education he knows we need those
[1:39:10] things but what we need to do as
[1:39:12] children of God is that every decision
[1:39:15] we make we make it by the word of
[1:39:18] God the scripture says that if you
[1:39:21] cannot do it in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:39:23] do not do it are you doing what you're
[1:39:27] doing in the name of Jesus Christ I'm
[1:39:29] going to work in the name of Jesus
[1:39:31] Christ if you get to a place where it
[1:39:33] cannot be done in the name of Jesus
[1:39:35] Christ then you live it out and let me
[1:39:38] say this you think you'll be missing
[1:39:40] there's nothing you're missing out there
[1:39:43] that's right
[1:39:44] amen right but when I'm speaks about the
[1:39:48] rumor of Sera and he says this in the
[1:39:52] message
[1:39:54] Elijah and the meal offering paragraph
[1:39:58] 99 he
[1:40:01] says what do we what it says what do you
[1:40:05] get there he said what do we do what do
[1:40:07] we get there it says seek ye first the
[1:40:12] kingdom of God and his
[1:40:15] righteousness and all things will be
[1:40:19] added all things will be added so the
[1:40:24] priority is under the authority of the
[1:40:27] word of God I am seeking first his
[1:40:30] kingdom and all things we re added he
[1:40:33] says how do I know brother brandham he
[1:40:35] says how do you know only thing I know
[1:40:39] put God first and move
[1:40:44] all that's all I know what how is it
[1:40:47] going to work I don't know how it's
[1:40:48] going to work out all I know is I'm
[1:40:51] putting God first s sacrifice mix the
[1:40:55] oil mix word and spirit together lay
[1:41:00] yourself upon the cross and say Here I
[1:41:04] Am Lord put God first in everything for
[1:41:09] thou sayith the Lord the Cru will not
[1:41:12] run dry neither will the barrel go empty
[1:41:15] until the Lord the day that the Lord God
[1:41:18] sent rain upon the Earth she knew then
[1:41:22] that that was the prophet of God
[1:41:24] speaking to her I want to ask you this
[1:41:27] morning do you know that this message is
[1:41:30] the prophet of God speaking to you and
[1:41:33] if you obey the same instruction God
[1:41:36] that provided for this woman will
[1:41:39] provide for you this morning she knew
[1:41:42] then that she was hearing from the
[1:41:43] prophet I ask you this morning she knew
[1:41:46] that the prophet has the authority of
[1:41:48] the word of God that what the prophet
[1:41:50] spoke will come to pass do you know that
[1:41:53] you have the authority of God by the
[1:41:55] word that the prophet has spoken in this
[1:41:58] same time generation that if you hear
[1:42:00] the same word the same Prophet speaking
[1:42:03] God will come and back it
[1:42:07] up the same God every time the same
[1:42:12] yesterday today and forever the
[1:42:15] authority of the same word not another
[1:42:18] word not a different word Jesus Christ
[1:42:21] the same yesterday forever if Jesus was
[1:42:24] yesterday what he did yesterday in fact
[1:42:27] bam says the very attribute the very
[1:42:30] Cornerstone of the whole Bible is that
[1:42:32] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday what
[1:42:35] he did yesterday a Believer can take and
[1:42:38] stand upon it and know that I am
[1:42:40] standing upon the word and he will do
[1:42:43] today what he did
[1:42:45] yesterday what a place we can stand this
[1:42:48] morning oh
[1:42:51] my oh
[1:42:54] how her heart must have jumped she ran
[1:42:58] in and made the little cake and brought
[1:43:02] it out to him and water
[1:43:04] trembling Trembling Hands over that old
[1:43:08] sunken she uh cheeks and she knew that
[1:43:12] God had come to the
[1:43:15] rescue oh my brother my sister over the
[1:43:19] little piece of bread she knew that God
[1:43:22] has come to the rest
[1:43:23] God will come to the rescue when you
[1:43:26] apply his word God will come to the
[1:43:28] rescue when we take him at his word when
[1:43:31] we believe that I am under the authority
[1:43:34] of the spoken
[1:43:40] word let me say
[1:43:45] this I want to say
[1:43:47] this our number one purpose here on
[1:43:51] Earth is to live for
[1:43:56] him I I I could go quote after quote but
[1:43:59] I
[1:44:02] think we we we we know the message this
[1:44:05] is the entire message we live for
[1:44:09] him we we everything we do we do for him
[1:44:13] we do what pleases
[1:44:15] him in the message the hand the
[1:44:19] handwritings on the wall paragraph 33
[1:44:22] and skip just some for the sake of
[1:44:26] time the purpose of the earth is to live
[1:44:28] for him butam says I said that's very
[1:44:32] nice and he's talking about a man that
[1:44:34] he met in
[1:44:36] Idaho who was Raising Hogs and and he
[1:44:41] was telling brother him he said that I
[1:44:43] raised Hogs and he said my grandfather
[1:44:45] has read uh had uh this heard and he
[1:44:48] educated us children and and some became
[1:44:53] uh uh and and and some at the same at
[1:44:56] the same her and he said I've educated
[1:44:59] my children and my children come up and
[1:45:01] educated their children with the same
[1:45:03] herd and and the same uh raising Hogs
[1:45:07] but when I answered him and he said
[1:45:09] now I said that's very nice sir that's
[1:45:14] that's a legitimate job it says is to
[1:45:16] raise the stock but I said did you know
[1:45:20] that God put you on Earth here on Earth
[1:45:23] put you here for some other purpose
[1:45:25] beside raising
[1:45:26] Hogs to educate your CH to raising Hogs
[1:45:30] to educate your children God put you
[1:45:33] here to be a son and a daughter of God
[1:45:36] and if you fail to get that you fail to
[1:45:40] receive the very purpose God placed you
[1:45:43] here on Earth that's
[1:45:46] right now that's the prophet
[1:45:50] speaking so he's saying telling this man
[1:45:54] if you fail to understand by the
[1:45:56] authority of God of the spoken word that
[1:46:00] God plac you here to be a son and a
[1:46:02] daughter of God and you have you have
[1:46:05] your Hogs and you have this uh uh
[1:46:07] precise structure that seemed to work
[1:46:10] over and over you done all of this and
[1:46:12] you did good and and that's wonderful
[1:46:14] you helped your family for generations
[1:46:16] to come and you set up a chain that can
[1:46:19] unlimited wealth per se that's wonderful
[1:46:22] but if if you fail to be a son and a
[1:46:24] daughter of God you fail to it he says
[1:46:29] no matter how honest now think about
[1:46:31] this now he he's really drilling down to
[1:46:36] to to make us understand this he says no
[1:46:38] matter how honest how decent how moral
[1:46:41] you might be how good you might be What
[1:46:44] a fine sociable fellow you might be you
[1:46:47] you it says you still miss the calling
[1:46:50] unless you serve the Lord and become son
[1:46:53] and the daughter of God no matter how
[1:46:55] good a neighbor you might be how good of
[1:46:58] anything you might be he says that's all
[1:47:01] good we appreciate that but brother
[1:47:04] until you become a Son of God you fail
[1:47:07] to answer the purpose that God put you
[1:47:10] on Earth that's
[1:47:14] right now that's the word of God
[1:47:17] speaking that's the prophet speaking so
[1:47:20] if we can come this morning we say I
[1:47:22] have been place here on Earth to be a
[1:47:24] son and a daughter of God he he wants me
[1:47:27] to bring forth the seed of
[1:47:29] predestination that was in the beginning
[1:47:31] and every single one of us that's here
[1:47:34] says that you play a role in the kingdom
[1:47:37] of God and he told you that nobody can
[1:47:39] take your place you are here for a
[1:47:41] purpose you are here to touch a people
[1:47:44] that nobody else can touch you are here
[1:47:46] to do a work that nobody else can do you
[1:47:49] in your particular way of being God
[1:47:52] created your for a purpose that's the
[1:47:54] authority of God word speaking to you
[1:47:57] and it says I don't want it says and if
[1:48:00] God done that I want to say this I don't
[1:48:02] want to fail the mission that God placed
[1:48:04] me here on Earth
[1:48:05] for
[1:48:08] amen I know my redeemer liveth butam
[1:48:11] says paragraph 12 584 and 6 he says no
[1:48:16] matter how little you are how big you
[1:48:19] are how important you are how
[1:48:21] unimportant you are
[1:48:23] I love this it's like he covers all the
[1:48:26] circles so you don't have a way of
[1:48:28] Escape he he locks you in I love that
[1:48:32] you know we have we have this mind that
[1:48:34] likes to find an Escape right that
[1:48:37] someone will be speaking you looking for
[1:48:39] an escape no when the prophet says
[1:48:41] Encompass you you know you lock in you
[1:48:44] know you are done so he speaks and says
[1:48:47] how important how an important you are

[1:51:05] serve its purpose it says it was God's
[1:51:09] divine plan to do so now keep this in
[1:51:13] mind now that's why I'm saying the
[1:51:15] authority of the word he's telling you
[1:51:17] this is a divine plan it says and if we
[1:51:21] were put here for a purpose then there's
[1:51:24] nothing that can destroy
[1:51:27] us until God's purpose is fulfilled
[1:51:31] nothing can harm us until the purpose
[1:51:34] that God put us on on Earth has been
[1:51:36] made manifest no matter how much trouble
[1:51:40] hallelujah oh we we you know it's like
[1:51:43] some of us you know trouble loves you
[1:51:46] you

[1:51:50] a life free of trouble it's like
[1:51:52] everywhere you turn there's trouble you
[1:51:55] know the enemy is just stirring up
[1:51:57] trouble you know you come over here
[1:51:59] there's trouble you step over here they
[1:52:01] TR you can't put out enough fires so
[1:52:04] here's the prophet here to encourage you
[1:52:06] this morning he says no matter how much
[1:52:08] trouble we have how much heartaches we
[1:52:11] have how much sorrow that we go through
[1:52:14] he says all these are reasons and
[1:52:17] there's a reason for it so we have to
[1:52:20] know that I have been placed here for a
[1:52:22] purpose I don't care how much trouble I
[1:52:24] go through I don't care what trouble the
[1:52:27] devil raises I'm here by the authority
[1:52:30] of God word to serve a purpose and I'm
[1:52:33] going to do it
[1:52:35] anyhow than paragraph 19 it says oh God
[1:52:41] he says oh and and and he says how that
[1:52:45] coincide this morning with
[1:52:49] faith I think it's the same message let
[1:52:51] me just check
[1:52:57] sorry I just crawled a little bit too
[1:53:06] fast yes I know my redeemer liveth uh
[1:53:11] 5846 he says oh how th coincide this
[1:53:14] morning with with uh uh with the faith
[1:53:17] the Living Faith of the Living God is in
[1:53:20] his church amen
[1:53:23] not out there in his church there is
[1:53:27] something in our heart that speaks that
[1:53:29] there's a land beyond the river I cannot
[1:53:32] put my finger on that on that land and
[1:53:35] Nether Nether any any nether can any man
[1:53:39] it says but there is something within us
[1:53:42] that tells us that the that the grave is
[1:53:45] not it's not its goal it says dust are
[1:53:49] thust are thou thust return was not not
[1:53:52] spoken to the soul that's right so you
[1:53:55] understand he that the purpose is you
[1:53:58] understand that this this flesh is dust
[1:54:01] it will go unto death but beyond outside
[1:54:04] of this dust there's a soul that's
[1:54:06] called to go back to where it came from
[1:54:09] and that that that Soul didn't come from
[1:54:11] dust it came from God therefore he goes
[1:54:13] back to God and he continues on it says
[1:54:16] there's something within us a fire
[1:54:19] that's burning a light that's been L by
[1:54:22] God no Breeze can blow it out there's no
[1:54:25] cold spell in the
[1:54:27] church there's no uh indifference among
[1:54:30] the people no uh persecution of the
[1:54:34] world that can blow us the that can blow
[1:54:36] out a flame that God has as has led for
[1:54:40] it says for it's God's purpose that his
[1:54:43] torch of Freedom will burn until the
[1:54:46] coming of the Lord right God will have a
[1:54:49] weakness on Earth it's his purpose that
[1:54:52] the flame will continue to blow is the
[1:54:55] election is he's choosing that the flame
[1:54:58] will continue on it says and no power
[1:55:01] can blow it up they will only make it
[1:55:04] burn brighter as they blue as they
[1:55:08] blow thank you
[1:55:12] Lorden it has been
[1:55:15] proven Through the
[1:55:18] Ages that
[1:55:20] persecution strengthens the
[1:55:26] church and I want to ask this
[1:55:29] morning can we really claim not to be
[1:55:32] true that when persecution come you know
[1:55:35] butom talks about the the the the wind
[1:55:38] blowing it says what it does to the tree
[1:55:41] it says when the wind blows it says the
[1:55:44] tree will move it will move but in the
[1:55:47] movement what it's going to do is it's
[1:55:50] trying to insert its root right back
[1:55:52] into the ground so it can get a stronger
[1:55:55] firm so it can stand up and be more
[1:55:59] stronger than he was before it's all
[1:56:01] it's doing its positioning to know that
[1:56:04] I have been placed here to remain the
[1:56:06] wind is not going to blow me off the
[1:56:08] devil with all his attack is not going
[1:56:10] to ble off I'm placed here to serve the
[1:56:13] purpose of God and whatever happens I'm
[1:56:15] standing upon the rock
[1:56:21] am oh oh
[1:56:26] my the word of God to the
[1:56:30] believer is the medicine that Health all
[1:56:44] things the word of God is the medicine
[1:56:48] that we need this
[1:56:49] morning I don't know perhaps what we go
[1:56:54] through on a daily
[1:56:56] basis but often time regardless of the
[1:56:59] challenges all you need to do is take
[1:57:02] your word and the Bible and begin to
[1:57:04] read and listen it starts to provide
[1:57:07] Comfort to your heart that's right God
[1:57:10] began to answer your problems and he
[1:57:13] began to reassure you that I'm with you
[1:57:15] I'm walking with you when we have when
[1:57:18] if we feel sick this morning whether it
[1:57:20] be natural or spiritual sickness what we
[1:57:23] need is to take the remedy of God's word
[1:57:26] and apply it to our sickness what talks
[1:57:29] about the Limestone it says what they
[1:57:31] did is they took the the the sheep and
[1:57:33] they will take all of them and they will
[1:57:34] bring them and then they will sprinkle
[1:57:37] honey on the rocks and it will come on
[1:57:39] the Limestone and said when it came and
[1:57:41] they knew that there was medicine in
[1:57:43] there all they needed to do was begin to
[1:57:45] leak the honey and in doing it they were
[1:57:48] collecting the limes that were there to
[1:57:50] heal them if you don't eat the word of
[1:57:53] God you shall really be sick if you
[1:57:55] don't take the word of God you shall
[1:57:57] surely sick but if you are sick this
[1:58:00] morning you take the word is the pro is
[1:58:02] the provision for healing for you it's
[1:58:05] given to you to heal you both naturally
[1:58:07] and spiritually is given for the healing
[1:58:10] to the
[1:58:11] church now let me I was thinking but
[1:58:15] what I'm talks
[1:58:17] about here he he says this and and I
[1:58:20] just hope I can come even uh uh to to
[1:58:24] some place where I can get to to the end
[1:58:27] he says this in God's gifts always find
[1:58:30] a
[1:58:31] place he
[1:58:34] says
[1:58:35] 63122 paragraph 41 he
[1:58:38] says what does it teach us here before
[1:58:42] we hit our next test it says here's what
[1:58:44] it teaches us that God can use every
[1:58:49] faculty of our being if it's
[1:58:53] committed surrendered to him he can use
[1:58:57] our minds our dreams our subc conscience
[1:59:02] our first conscience our tongue Our Song
[1:59:05] Our Eyes
[1:59:07] our everything that we have can be used
[1:59:12] of God if it's committed to
[1:59:15] God am amen so we we just spoke about
[1:59:19] the authority of God's word
[1:59:23] now he inserting an
[1:59:25] element of commitment that is
[1:59:29] required an element of surrender that is
[1:59:32] required for the authority to be
[1:59:36] manifested and it it continues on it
[1:59:38] says everything that you are committed
[1:59:42] to God he will use every Outlet every
[1:59:46] part of you he will use it no matter
[1:59:49] what it is he will use it
[1:59:52] if it's sacrificed to the purpose and
[1:59:57] the calling now listen to this the word
[2:00:00] committed or to commit means to promise
[2:00:05] to give to to promise or give your your
[2:00:09] loyalty time or money to a particular
[2:00:13] principle person or plan of
[2:00:16] action let me read it again when you say
[2:00:19] you are committed to something when you
[2:00:22] say I'm committed to this what you're
[2:00:25] saying is I promise to give my loyalty
[2:00:29] my time my money to a particular
[2:00:33] principle person or plan of action to
[2:00:37] pledge or bind to a certain course or
[2:00:47] policy amen is that really what we're
[2:00:49] doing to surrender is saying here it's
[2:00:53] given it here is saying that to
[2:00:56] surrender means to agree to stop
[2:01:01] fighting now this is Dr Google you know
[2:01:03] I've been using Professor Google lately
[2:01:05] you know I and I and I I I tell people
[2:01:10] if I get a job and there's no access to
[2:01:12] Google I won't be able to do my
[2:01:18] job to surrender is to you agree to stop
[2:01:24] fighting hiding resisting Etc because
[2:01:29] you know that you will not win or
[2:01:35] succeed now I I I I'm hoping by reading
[2:01:38] this it helps us understand what kind of
[2:01:41] contract what kind of relationship is
[2:01:44] expected of us by the Lord is to agree
[2:01:47] to stop fighting hiding or resisting
[2:01:51] because you know that you will not win
[2:01:54] or succeed so when you surrender you
[2:01:57] know I've given up there's no way for me
[2:02:00] to win Paul it's again it's hard to kick
[2:02:02] against the pre I you could try all you
[2:02:05] want you're never going to win
[2:02:09] this because the purpose of God will
[2:02:11] stand no matter what as we said it so
[2:02:14] now we're saying that we have to come
[2:02:17] for this uh uh uh contract to work for
[2:02:21] this relation relationship to work of
[2:02:23] the authority of God in your life you
[2:02:26] have to the the more you surrender or
[2:02:29] the quicker you surrender the more the
[2:02:31] commitment will work the more you will
[2:02:34] give in the more you will commit to it
[2:02:36] God will come and bring it to pass he's
[2:02:39] looking for people that will completely
[2:02:42] buy into the plan that he has for
[2:02:46] them he looking for people that can come
[2:02:49] and say God has a plan for us amen we no
[2:02:52] matter what we have need of this morning
[2:02:54] and let me say this not not just need as
[2:02:57] far as our Natural Body because most of
[2:03:00] the time when we talk we think about our
[2:03:02] natural need I'll say there both natural
[2:03:04] and spiritual he knows about it and he's
[2:03:06] taking care of it so what we need uh to
[2:03:10] come in is to say I have been told that
[2:03:12] in the end time God will come and bring
[2:03:15] people that will be even like him he
[2:03:18] will bring us into immaturity so
[2:03:20] therefore I have to me to the plan that
[2:03:23] he has in store for us so I can come
[2:03:25] into that maturity maturity is not going
[2:03:28] to come by me kicking against the prick
[2:03:32] the maturity is not going to come by me
[2:03:35] opposing the
[2:03:38] plan the easier I give in the more
[2:03:41] quicker I get to the
[2:03:44] plan how many times we've heard the
[2:03:46] prophet say oh forgive your foolish
[2:03:49] servant oh forgive your you know because
[2:03:52] he he he came to a place where sometimes
[2:03:55] God will tell him to do something he
[2:03:57] will miss completely the picture of what
[2:03:59] God was trying to do then he happens and
[2:04:02] then God will rearrange and then he
[2:04:03] realize oh that's what he was trying to
[2:04:05] get me to do
[2:04:07] this and we as Believers we have to be
[2:04:11] in tune with the plan of God we have to
[2:04:14] be in tune with the achievement that God
[2:04:16] is trying to do because the only way for
[2:04:18] us to obtain as quick as we want to the
[2:04:21] plan to get to where God wants us to do
[2:04:24] is by surrender and
[2:04:27] commitment we we said Wednesday we live
[2:04:30] in a time where nobody wants to commit
[2:04:32] to anything right Christianity is I will
[2:04:35] go to church when I please when my body
[2:04:38] wants to come to church I will do this
[2:04:41] when I want to do it I'm a Maverick I
[2:04:43] operate by my own self I don't want any
[2:04:46] leadership over every I don't want
[2:04:48] anybody to be over me
[2:04:54] the holy spirit is given to be over you
[2:04:57] not a man I'm not talking about a man
[2:04:59] over you I'm talking about under the
[2:05:02] authority of the word of
[2:05:06] God we we live in a time where you ask
[2:05:09] now it doesn't happen you run away you
[2:05:12] you do this and and it doesn't it
[2:05:15] doesn't quickly happen oh it's taking
[2:05:18] too long we God is looking for soul
[2:05:22] we said we talked about perseverance one
[2:05:25] who heard the word of God and he knows
[2:05:27] in his heart that if God spoke it God
[2:05:29] will bring it to pass if his heart H the
[2:05:32] word of God they will continue marching
[2:05:35] until it comes to
[2:05:38] pass perseverance is not when you have
[2:05:40] seen it perseverance is to know that he
[2:05:44] who told me it's going to happen will
[2:05:45] bring it to
[2:05:47] pass thankes let me say this persevering
[2:05:51] is the process of weeding out the
[2:05:55] quitters those that don't see it because
[2:05:59] they will walk but if they continue not
[2:06:02] to see it they'll get discouraged oh it
[2:06:04] doesn't
[2:06:06] exist right but to the Believers they
[2:06:10] know that every step of the way they'll
[2:06:12] be like Shadrach mishak and Abad go it
[2:06:15] said that we will not bow our God is
[2:06:18] able to deliver us and even if he
[2:06:20] doesn't
[2:06:22] even if it doesn't we're still going to
[2:06:24] go whether God shows me he doesn't show
[2:06:27] me I'll still keep going if God shows me
[2:06:30] wonderful if he doesn't show me as long
[2:06:33] as it is in his word I'll stand by it
[2:06:36] and I'll believe it until the end
[2:06:38] because when I fall he will touch
[2:06:44] me
[2:06:45] perseverance is the total opposite of
[2:06:49] the self-preservation
[2:06:54] we like to
[2:06:57] self-preserving it for me how is this
[2:07:00] going to benefit me how is this really
[2:07:03] going to advance my cause how is this me
[2:07:06] me me me isn't that the thing about Lysa
[2:07:10] we just read it said that people's right
[2:07:13] people's age where they stand it's about
[2:07:15] personal right but he said well a lamb
[2:07:17] is one who has surrendered his right one
[2:07:20] who's completely Comm committed to the
[2:07:22] cause of Christ one who's taken his own
[2:07:24] rights and give it it says not my will
[2:07:26] but your will remember he says the same
[2:07:29] relationship that existed between God
[2:07:31] and Christ it will have to exist between
[2:07:34] Christ and the bride
[2:07:37] amen amen if the musician could come
[2:07:51] and I want to say this what one I'm said
[2:07:55] in question and
[2:07:58] answers it
[2:08:02] says question and answer preaching
[2:08:05] 59223 paragraph 1 123
[2:08:12] 123 it
[2:08:15] says before the world before there was a
[2:08:20] world you were in God's
[2:08:23] Tau to give you the Holy
[2:08:26] Ghost I love
[2:08:30] that I love that I wish that every
[2:08:34] believer every time you feel like you
[2:08:36] don't have the Holy Ghost you go read
[2:08:39] this it would help you amen am before
[2:08:45] there was a world you were in God's
[2:08:48] thought to give you the Holy Ghost
[2:08:52] because he knew that you'll be wanting
[2:08:56] it and he chose you himself because you
[2:09:01] desired he chose you in Christ before
[2:09:05] you or Jesus or any of you or any of you
[2:09:10] was on Earth and He sent Jesus to die to
[2:09:14] prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost
[2:09:17] to bring you to himself
[2:09:21] thank you Jesus now I don't understand
[2:09:23] that plan that's just way way past so
[2:09:28] even before Jesus Is manifested God it
[2:09:31] himself is knowing that this person is
[2:09:34] going to need the Holy Ghost but for him
[2:09:36] to get the Holy Ghost I'll need my son
[2:09:39] to die and if my son to die then I'll
[2:09:41] make a way for him to come oh goodness
[2:09:45] that is so
[2:09:47] wonderful that is a mathematical
[2:09:49] equation we cannot understand 10 that's
[2:09:52] just one thing we need to believe that
[2:09:54] God has it under
[2:09:56] control thank you Jes he's worked it out
[2:09:58] for your
[2:10:03] good he
[2:10:05] says oh I know it says I I I know I may
[2:10:10] this says this is the church it says so
[2:10:14] I'm at home now it says this is so reach
[2:10:17] to me I think it's what I wanted it says
[2:10:20] it was wasn't my desire it wasn't my
[2:10:23] will it wasn't my choosing I had not one
[2:10:26] thing to do with it but before the world
[2:10:29] ever started God saw us and put our
[2:10:32] names on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[2:10:35] there was even a world talk about talk
[2:10:37] about God you it says and let me say
[2:10:41] this that's why it's important when we
[2:10:43] come to the house of
[2:10:45] God we we are here to fulfill the
[2:10:48] purpose that God plac us here
[2:10:51] and if God plac us here that means he
[2:10:54] had everything line up everything
[2:10:57] predestinated everything line up for us
[2:11:00] to receive this end time message he he
[2:11:03] says in the natural he put this together
[2:11:06] that together so you could become so now
[2:11:08] he's telling you in the spiritual that
[2:11:11] the purpose that I was making even the
[2:11:13] holy spirit in existence was so that
[2:11:16] when you come he knew that you would
[2:11:18] need it and you would receive it let me
[2:11:20] say this the end time commission and our
[2:11:23] responsibility is for us to spread the
[2:11:26] good news of what Jesus has done for
[2:11:30] us God wants you this precious message
[2:11:35] this precious gospel that we have
[2:11:37] received God don't want it to just be
[2:11:39] ourselves he want us to spread it into
[2:11:42] the whole world to those that have not
[2:11:44] heard it before to those that are
[2:11:46] struggling in sin and things and to
[2:11:49] those that don't know that there's a God
[2:11:50] who can do this to those that don't
[2:11:53] understand that there was a
[2:11:54] predestination where God in the
[2:11:56] beginning was working out everything for
[2:11:58] your good for those that are out there
[2:12:00] of the seed of God that have not come in
[2:12:03] contact with him God wants your life to
[2:12:06] Manifest this gospel so therefore we
[2:12:08] have not received it so we can just say
[2:12:11] we thank God for the message we have
[2:12:13] received it the purpose for it is so we
[2:12:16] can become the message so we can spread
[2:12:19] the message
[2:12:23] amen but one them says oh what God is
[2:12:27] looking for is lived voices if
[2:12:31] Jeffersonville could only have lived
[2:12:33] voices in other words those that have
[2:12:36] received the message and they have
[2:12:38] become the very message those that can
[2:12:40] go and spread it into all the world and
[2:12:43] they will tell it to their neighbors
[2:12:44] they will go to work and everywhere
[2:12:47] families and wherever they are where the
[2:12:49] lies become the very reflection of what
[2:12:52] Jesus is doing let me say that that's
[2:12:56] your purpose for existence and I'm
[2:12:59] saying that under the authority of the
[2:13:02] word of
[2:13:03] God thank you Lord don't never forget
[2:13:06] that what says the scripture will say
[2:13:09] the word will say you will go and people
[2:13:11] will ask you what is it that makes you
[2:13:14] happy why aren't you sad and the economy
[2:13:16] is failing and inflation is going up and
[2:13:20] and the buying power is going down and
[2:13:22] all of that now if you are complaining
[2:13:25] with the world how are you going to
[2:13:26] spread the good
[2:13:28] news if you are there at the gas station
[2:13:31] complaining just like the next guy man I
[2:13:34] can't believe we can't afford this
[2:13:35] anymore and I can't believe the
[2:13:37] groceries is going up and I can't
[2:13:39] believe how is it you're spreading the
[2:13:41] good
[2:13:42] news I think we have to be mindful of
[2:13:45] what we are put here but one of them
[2:13:47] says you go to a place it says when
[2:13:49] someone will say oh oh you know I have a
[2:13:52] person he says it's sick and the doctors
[2:13:54] have given this and they've given a bad
[2:13:56] report and you turn around and say I
[2:13:58] know a God who can heal
[2:14:00] them that's how you worship him that's
[2:14:03] the spreading of the good news you are
[2:14:05] at work and somebody is just losing it I
[2:14:08] can't believe this job oh I can't
[2:14:10] believe this world and everything say
[2:14:12] well you know I know of another kingdom
[2:14:14] that is to come when this one is over
[2:14:17] there's another one to come if you want
[2:14:19] to come through it I invite you to
[2:14:21] believe my God he's able to do for you
[2:14:23] how are you going to do it if you are
[2:14:25] complaining with a
[2:14:27] [Music]
[2:14:30] complainer have we not understood that
[2:14:33] we have a God who promised to take care
[2:14:35] of our need have we not understood that
[2:14:37] we have a God who before you came he
[2:14:41] predestinated everything he promised to
[2:14:43] take care of all your needs don't we
[2:14:46] understand that we have a message to
[2:14:48] give to the world and our message is
[2:14:50] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2:14:53] today and forever and whatever need is
[2:14:56] out there you bring it into the house of
[2:14:59] God there's a God here who's able to
[2:15:02] make himself a reality to those that are
[2:15:05] looking for
[2:15:07] him don't be afraid let me say this it's
[2:15:11] not for you to prove him to prove him
[2:15:14] it's for him to prove his word to be
[2:15:18] true you met a sinner
[2:15:21] you meet one who's going through
[2:15:23] difficulties but but I'm said you
[2:15:25] worship
[2:15:26] Him by looking and them
[2:15:30] say you know you don't have to live that
[2:15:33] way that's right you know you don't have
[2:15:35] to continue in sin you know you don't
[2:15:38] have to be bound by alcohol or drug or
[2:15:40] whatever it is that you are you know
[2:15:42] there's a living
[2:15:44] garden and perhaps you is one that
[2:15:47] perhaps in the same situation that you
[2:15:49] were in and you can look and say you
[2:15:52] know I was a drug addict too oh I was a
[2:15:56] drunker too but I meant to Living God I
[2:16:00] meant the Living God I didn't meet just
[2:16:03] the God but I me the god of the Bible
[2:16:06] the one who wrote his word and he came
[2:16:09] and he changed my life and I'm here to
[2:16:11] testify to you that if you will believe
[2:16:14] that same God he will do for you the
[2:16:16] same that he did for me that's the
[2:16:19] testimony of the believer that's what
[2:16:21] you were place here on Earth for is to
[2:16:23] continue the Gospel of Jesus Christ is
[2:16:26] to spread good news is to live for him
[2:16:30] is so that your life can become his
[2:16:32] reflection

[2:17:03] something or where a person looked at a
[2:17:06] a whale and said oh look at this whale
[2:17:08] and they say that swallowed Jonah and if
[2:17:12] you measure here and you measure there

[2:17:41] about a living
[2:17:44] God he said sir pardon me but that's not
[2:17:50] the same thing fish the Bible says it
[2:17:53] was a special prepared fish that
[2:17:55] swallowed Jonah oh it's the same no that
[2:17:58] one was specifically made for one
[2:18:02] Mission and one Mission alone that one
[2:18:05] could swallow a man no other whale could
[2:18:08] swallow a man except this
