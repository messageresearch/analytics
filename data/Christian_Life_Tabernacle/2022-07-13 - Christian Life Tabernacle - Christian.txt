========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] god bless you everybody i'm talking to an invisible audience uh this evening but i trust you're there so let's just take a moment and bow our heads in prayer and ask the lord to bless us our gracious heavenly father we've just taken a moment this evening to fellowship with the people to give a little building report a little financial update lord and just have a time to use this time to just draw us closer father inspire us and let us all feel connected we ask that you bless us and those that have taken the opportunity to tune in may their hearts be lifted may they keep us in prayer and we just ask for your grace to be our portion this evening in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen as we get started tonight i'd like to read a scripture found over in philippians and i'd like to read the first 13 verses of the book of philippians and first philippians 2 1-13 and the scripture reads like this i hope you have your bible or you pull it up on whatever instrument that you have but it says if there therefore be any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any vows and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord and of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind letting each esteem the other better than themselves not look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind being you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men i like that he took on the form of a servant and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also have highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father wherefore my beloved as ye all as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure amen we just asked the lord to bless his word i thought i'd take just a moment to share with you if i could say my vision and my hope for the church and to share with you the direction that i feel led to go in and i believe that starts with my feeling towards the word of god and the message of the hour and i believe that the message that's been given that we've been able to capture in the form of tapes and in the form of booklets and other means is the revealed word of god for our hour and i believe that through a messenger that god in his infinite wisdom had a device created that could or invented could i say it that way that captured that voice that uh that it wouldn't be secondhand that we could hear that voice ourselves directly ourselves and by hearing that voice each of us individually we could work out our own salvation with fear and trembling it caused us to have a great uniqueness to have something that's individual because we're all hearing the gospel that's preached but the spirit of god is breaking it to each of us and feeding it to each of us as we have need of i don't believe that this message should be placed in the form of doctrines or creeds or have periods put on it or have it explained or interpreted or to have it become something that has now has to have the authority of men ruling over it between the people and the voice itself i believe that every believer has direct access to the voice of the prophet of god and that the holy spirit from that voice can get each individual revelation and uh the scripture here that we spoke said let this mind be in you that was in the lord jesus and we know that a word is a thought expressed so when someone speaks something you've heard the expression i'm going to speak what's on my mind well we find out that what jesus spoke was the mind of god what god had on his mind is what the lord spoke and so by the word of god we know what god thinks and our desire is that through the preaching of the gospel and the sharing of the message of now the hour that this mind would now come in us that we would have the mind of the lord and act and for that great ministry that has come there had to be an absolute voice somewhere someone that was the true voice of the word of god the divine interpreter of god's word so without question we could identify it as being the thoughts of god not many men have different doctrines and different ideas but we have been built on something that's been totally vindicated and totally true and totally proven not to waver so my approach to the message is that there's still life in the message and still stored up food and still revelations that are hid and and there to be brought out by his spirit in season and each time these revelations are brought out whether to you individually in your own prayer life through the ministry of the local church through your prayer life through whichever way that god would choose to speak you the revelations of god's mind brings you more into his image and that's what that our goal is in all of our goal is and the love of god was summed up in this manner that as he was in this world as he is so are we in this world and so the word of god this great message of the hour that we have has been brought to show us what that he is so as we have a revelation of what he is then we know what we can become and he said let this mind be in you that he thought it not robbery to be equal with god and we shouldn't think that robbery to feel that we can become obedient to the word of god and that jesus christ can express himself out through us i know there's many different approaches to the message of the hour i know there's some that believe that the message we've got the message now we understand the teachings in the message that that we know what brother branham taught and now we're waiting for a spiritual outpouring or a spiritual movement to move the church and that manifestation is manifested in in the expression of uh worship or the expression of of great joy and a jubilance and and of great works being done in our midst and and i believe that i believe every believer should have that not just in the church building it's like the little brook they came up and asked the little brook why are you so bubbly why are you so full of joy and and they asked the book he said is it because the deer come drink from you because there's blessings and signs and and wonders and flowers and butterflies and all those things and all the things around him he said no really why i'm so happy because there's something on the inside of me bubbling and pushing up and that's our goal is to is to come such in love with this message and such in love with the word of god having such confidence that it's the truth that it becomes a living fountain bubbling up in us and it brings us closer into the image of god and closer into the mind of god and the way that god thinks and so i i'd like to read this statement that what it comes from just a few paragraphs out of uh convinced and concerned and uh and i hope i i have it right and he's he's he's talking about what he's preached and he says he says there's something wrong somewhere still doing the same thing still the same gospel i've never changed a bit since i started i just started with the naked bear word of god and i stayed right on it ever since 32 years i've been behind the pulpit and never taking it never taken anything back or changed any thing stated it's just the way i started i can't take it back it's god's word and if this is convinced and concerned uh paragraph 70 uh preached in uh on june 10th in 1962 he says he he says he says but and i can't take it back it's god's word and if i stay say it just like it's said here the next time i have to say the same thing because here is the way it's wrote here see so just can't do anything else about it it's the holy spirit is still doing the same thing so what's the holy spirit doing it's saying the same thing this word does and it can't be back it can't be changed it's the same because it's the word of god and so as we just finish up on this it says so but it looks like there's not enough concern now i'm wondering why why isn't there a concern like there used to be it's i believe the reason that if there's not so much concern as there used to be they're not as convinced as they used to be you have to be convinced before you're concerned and and i think that's an important thing that we don't fade away from being totally convinced that this message is god's provided way for his bride to escape this world i would hate to feel that that people aren't as convinced anymore that there's truths in this message and there's revelation in this message and there's leadership in this message and there's things there that god can still speak to us that we that we would lose confidence in the message or feel that the message has had its day it's had its time uh that that that god's now wanting us to forge forward without it that he's wanting us to go in the realms in places that we haven't been before and i believe there's places that we haven't been before but i believe it's the word of god that's going to lead us into those places because i believe that god's got a creative will and and that we don't have to produce it that if we follow the word of god and we become have our revelation increased from the revealed word of god as our revelations increases and as the word of god increases in our knowledge of the word of god and our knowledge and understanding of what that he is that that produces something in you that is actually his nature and he did the works that he did because of his nature because he what he was and so we're looking for a great uh desire in our heart to have his mind and that's what this message of the hour does it puts the mind of god in you because his mind is his word they're one and the same thing what is a word it's a thought expressed what is the word of god it's the thoughts expressed what is the message of the hour it's god's thoughts expressed to us that we can take on the mind of christ and then when you take on the mind of christ it changes the way that you see things it changes the way that you look at things it changes it the way that you perceive things how would you like when you could become such to a place that you looked out at the people and they say they look like sheep without a shepherd oh how i would long to gather you up how i would long to brood over you okay such such a love and and in such a concern of for the lost in the dying the prophet god said that you can't even be spiritual until you have a real design desire for the sick for for the needy for the lost he says he says you have to be convinced convinced before you can be concerned not concerned you take the time now instead of evangelizing and trying to do something everybody wants a great big school or a great big something that they can teach or make ministers or have better pulpit manners and so forth you know what i believe i believe that the people is not convinced that jesus is coming soon i don't believe that they're convinced that he's coming in this age and i believe that's the reason that they're not concerned because they're not fully convinced right they're not convinced that he's with them if they were they would come back to the word that's right and now many people not people might misunderstand it but and and i thought that if if they're convinced they said they would come back to the word back to the word back to what's going to transform them but they're not convinced the word's going to transform them they're not so they've developed they feel that that that there's a spirit that's been a transformer but the holy spirit never came to speak of itself and the holy spirit is not it is not a different anointing the holy spirit is the word anointing the holy spirit is the revelation of the word of god the holy spirit is what quickens that word to you and makes that word real to you and alive to you that you can see it that's the holy spirit it didn't come to speed of itself it didn't come it didn't come to to have a ministry of its own the ministry of the spirit of god lies within the word because the spirit only testifies to the word the spirit only bears witness to the word now there's anointing it falls on the just and the unjust that the the the believer the true believer is convinced that the word message that's been given us the peering of the pillar of fire the opening of the seals that within that framework is the revelation that's going to cause the rapture and that's where we want to feed from and we want to be convinced that we don't feel it's robbery to bring this word to a lost and dying generation so i i believe there's so many things and as the word is revealed to us and as we we are more convinced and more concerned what we will find out is that and i'll maybe speak on this sunday morning we will start seeing him appear in our lives we'll see him manifesting himself through us in situation after situation we will actually see him uniting himself with his word believers performing wonders through their ministries each of our lives is a ministry we'll see him people will testify of him being on the scene in so many circumstances so many places that it it it's phenomenal i i'm eating today i met with brother manjit singh and his wife sister and over in uh pf chang's way over in in dallas and i i come out the door and i open the door and i bump into a real tall strong handsome gentleman and to have to grab him to hold my balance and it's brother troy hallelujah you know what i mean i mean that's the kind of stuff i love to see you know okay let you know i'm glad i didn't say get out of my way oh brother troy i didn't know it was you forgive me no how much more in my absence yes you know i mean can you that's what we want the people to be we don't want her to be bumps on the uh uh pews we we don't want to just sit back and absorb knowledge and absorb sermons and absorb revelations we want them to be able to go out into the world in their lives and take a stand on god's word and see jesus actually appear on the scene doing what they can't do and that's what his appearance proves that he can do what man can't do oh i'm excited for what's coming and so i just wanted to share with you that that's my my heart's desire is that each believer will know that the presence of the lord is with them and they'll be testifying of his appearing in their lives performing this word in every situation and circumstance and that my heart's desire is to move for that and so i just wanted to share that with you tonight now in our process of reaching this goal and wanting to go forward and and share the gospel uh we found out that we're gonna have to provide some facilities and we our desire is to provide some facilities for our our children our sunday school our young people and in order to do that we felt that we would need to have a sanctuary at least big enough to hold our congregation and right now our services are running between 320 to 340 people and that includes some people sitting in their cars it doesn't include the people sitting in their cars nor the people that are at home streaming so we're not really sure we don't spend a lot of time counting the people that attend here but on and off we usually run 320 to 340 people with different people gone every time sometimes 20 to 15 or more people so i would imagine if we gathered everybody together we'd probably be somewhere in the range of uh 300 and maybe 80 70 to 380 people so we're trying to build a church that will seat comfortably very comfortably of 420 people and that would include a spacing of about three feet between pews so that means the end of the pew would be here and the next few would start here so you'd have to this much space to the back of the pew from your knees right here about three feet you can walk without fitting up so that's our goal if we outgrow the 420 we'll just start squeezing and you know how much we can squeeze and then we'll have nice wide aisles and so i'll we'll show you some photos of that but let's just talk for a moment about this building what's going to happen to this building well what's going to happen to this building to about the center of the can you follow me with the camera caleb okay so what's going to happen is the baptistry is going to go and there's going to be a hallway here now and from this hallway you'll be able to go in a little hall and go into a bathroom that used to be my bathroom it'll now become a little bathroom for the sunday school teachers and for the children that they can that they can uh use a restroom there without going far am i okay pardon oh you want me to hold the mic okay i don't didn't know if you heard all that but um anyway it's about what we're doing back here okay all righty so we're gonna so my office is gonna become now a sunday school teacher work room where they can have a copy machine all their sunday school supplies and a little place to get together some tables to prepare a message their sunday school lesson and then from right about where this little spot is here just a little bit on the other side now this will become a classroom so there will be two large classrooms on this side of the church and then on this side of the church there will be three not as large but large classrooms and that would allow us to have five sunday school classrooms and then the rest of the of the sanctuary which will no longer be a sanctuary going all the way back these the interpretation walls will be taken out the walls where the sound booth will be taken out the sunday little sunday school room will be done away with and all this will become one open hallway after the sunday school rooms as a fellowship area and there will still be the two bathrooms back there so if they were to follow me down here i could just give you a general idea of what's going on so right right about here somewhere would be the end of the sunday school area right here the last two classrooms there will be a hall right down the middle and then this will all be classroom and that'll all be classroom the last two classrooms will have an accordion wall on it so they can be opened up and that classroom space can be used for more seating if we had a vin event the ceiling now will come straight across from the corners there it'll be a flat ceiling above it'll be storage sprinkler lines air conditioning and everything the rest of this will all be an open fellowship hall and we'll convert our kitchen into a full kitchen that's phase two of our building right here in this space between these two windows right here yeah i i hope they're following me and you can hear me this right here will become the hallway do you have me there bill all right tell me when i when they got me again i'm in right okay right here is where the hallway is going to connect this building with the other building so our children don't have to go outside they'll go into a hall when people come in if our bathrooms got too crowded they would have overflow access to these things so that's the plan for this building after we move over into the other building we will convert this building into excuse me for turning my back to everybody so that's our plans uh for this building and then um and then so now we want to talk about um where we are on our existing building and so we have a little some little video clips and some pictures and some um things like that we'll show you just to give you a little background on the whole history here is that um we're in our church and and you know we little thoughts begin to sprinkle into our mind about maybe building something bigger or having something else and i don't know maybe it was about seven years maybe ago that the property next door came up for sale was that that long ago okay i don't know how long ago i purchased it so anyway in about 2011 the property next door came for sale there was a great big sign put on it that the city of euless was selling the property now that's a 2.75 acres right in the middle of bedford i don't know if you've been looked around but every nook and cranny in this town is getting a little housing development put on it it stayed there for about four or five months and nobody said anything about it so the mayor told the city worker i know of the city manager to go put the card in my mailbox and ask me if i would be interested in purchasing that property so it just so happened at that time there was a little bit of internal fighting going on between the city of euless and the city of medford and the city of ulis owned that property so i contacted the gentleman and and he said well what would you give us for that property i said about fifty thousand dollars he said fine perfect and we bought that property next door for fifty thousand dollars at that time there was a great big water tower on the prop property and many many metal buildings well so we hired we took down the metal buildings and sold all the scrap metal we took down the power the water tower and sold all that and everything that we sold came up to about a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars for the scrap metal it cost us about fifty five thousand dollars to take it down so we ended up with that property basically paid for and a few years ago at that time the church couldn't afford to buy the property so i personally financed it and after it was paid for i donated it back to the church so that's how we got to where we had we had this property so we decided that we would build on it so our next project was to plant the property and make it all one property so um that's the that has all been done except for the the final city stamp took of approval and we have to have the fire lanes in and the fire hydrants and all those things in that's where we are now we're at the stage now if you've been by the church you've seen when you look outside it looks like a popsicle stick farm with all the popsicle sticks coming out of the ground that's because we're getting ready to start the work on the parking lots so i don't know ben maybe if we could just show a few clips of some photographs some clips that's where we are now we're putting in the water main water line is coming in for all the fire hydrants and we're getting ready to clear all those things can they see that photograph that i see all right that's the piles of dirt that we had trucks bring in and so this is what the land been looking like we've brought lots of dirt in and now uh you can see the dirt everywhere and now we've leveled all that dirt out okay so these are just different photographs of the different projects that's the construction entrance that's the piles of dirt again that we have to all flatten out and we've been flattening out so this is what our project looks like from the air and a little video going over yeah orlando uh brother orlando took these videos with his little uh drone so um and though we've had all this uh going on and so we've changed quite a bit of this now but uh that's where we're at and now you notice that that parking lot that he just flew over most of that's taken up now and um so let's just go to some just play everything you have and and just photographs of different aspects of the construction that's our new roof i guess we put a new roof on the church building there i am probably trying to figure out what in the world i'm doing all right this happens to be a photograph of a phone line that is outside of the easement that we have to get the phone company to move so with david junior's help we've contacted att and they're in the process of getting that cable move for us we don't even know if it's alive and so this is just an overview of now you can see that all the piles of the dirt are now flattened out and we're getting ready to do the final grade and start building the parking lot and so they you can see those all there and and that's kind of a good video of where we are and then good video of the corner over there so um now this is uh the street up that they've shut down the lanes of the street now it's only two lanes out there and uh this is a video of the uh guys fixing to make the tap on the water line so that water lines about seven feet below the surface now this is our utility crew and that's the main 20-inch main water line and we're tapping it i believe with a 8 inch or 10 inch so so you can see the street there the construction in the street the hole in the street and just two lanes of uh traffic and we hope that they'll be done by sunday with the street so and then again just different photographs of the work that's going on today so is that um okay the other pictures that you took of the um we just okay um i don't know how many have seen it but this is a a drawing of what the new church is uh going to look like you can see the other church next door to it which is a 5 000 square foot church our new church is uh 10 000 square feet it's twice the size of the church that we have now and so that's how they'll look connected together just to give you an idea i don't know how many of you have seen this maybe for the first time but i i just hope it gets you involved in what we feel the lord's doing we're not just building this church for us we're building it for the people that we're going to share this message with amen so i'll show the other next one um okay that now this is um i don't know if that can be zoomed in on or brought any bigger or not but i hope you can see it yes this is the uh the floor plan of the new church and what those arrows that you see are that's the the egress plan or in other words that's how you you exit the building that shows you all the different ways to exit you can see the three offices at the bottom of the screen the platform you can see that we have four aisles uh four aisles or rows of seating the center rows are 13 feet apiece the same size we have now on each outside is a nine foot row and then we have aisles in between them i believe a five foot center aisle of four foot side aisles and three foot outside aisles and then you can notice we have a larger fourier with three doors to exit and then you can see the hallway connecting to the new church so that kind of gives you a a little idea of where that we are and what that we have going on so where are we right now we're finishing up the grade we're putting in the utilities we're building the storm drain detention pond and we're building the sidewalk so our goal is in three weeks time to have obtained our building permit we're doing our work now under our public works permit and we hope to be getting our building permit in about three to weeks time i hope to start pouring the parking lot so if we can get the parking lot poured by the middle of august or the end of august then we'll be able to park on our new parking lot take up the parking lot that we're parking on now and start putting the building foundation in so that's where we are there now just a little uh kind of understanding of how that our our finances are are going this isn't any way an official financial report uh tawanda hasn't uh would you get me a bottle of water darium towanda our church uh the treasurer and our church finance officer has not put his seal of approval on this financial report neither have the trustees so any heirs that are in this financial report are theirs no they're mine so um i we can get a much better um uh and i will have them prepare for you a much better financial report but just to let you know where we stand we have what we do with our offering is we have two offering accounts one is what we call our operation account and that takes our our ongoing expenses our lights our bills and all that we keep money set aside in an account to pay our bills their excess money that we have that we don't use goes into a building fund and along with the people that have written checks specifically for the building fund and in that building fund now we have a little probably a little over 580 000 that is in our building fund all the work that you see going on now all the grading all the concrete removal all this sewer and a water work that is all being taken out of money that i set aside from our tithing my tithing account and set it aside that was a little over about four hundred thousand dollars so we're using the four hundred thousand dollars that's been set aside on all the site work and that and as soon as we get done with the site work and that's done then we'll move over to the building fund and start using our building fund money and also the money that we've received from a loan that we're getting so the church is borrowing a million three hundred thousand dollars with anticipation we're only going to use 600 000 of it and when we're all said and done we will only have a 600 000 mortgage so that's uh what's going on so as far as our offerings are go we know that there's a lot of inflation going on prices are higher than there ever have been gas is higher food is higher i guess inflation's almost up to nine percent well that's just about the difference in percentage between what our offering was last year at this time and this year at this time so right now um uh we've we've collected just around sixty thousand dollars uh um worth of uh offering last year we were right around 73 000 but we're still in good shape so we're not hurting we're not where we were last year but our economy is not where was last year expenses are where they were last year so the difference in the two is just about what inflation is so we know it's been hard on everybody the job market the inflation market gasoline expenses utilities travel food everything but we've done a good job absorbing that and the church is doing well so um you know so that's kind of where we are if you want to call me personally and get some more information i'm not real good with numbers we'll give you a more updated uh access to the building fund but so we just wanted to share that with you so you could have an understanding so during the construction process this week they're going to close the two accesses that we have for parking and we're only going to be down to one way to get into our property and that's the street access right here where the mailbox is so brother chris is going to come and just take a couple moments and give everybody an outlook on the parking uh for the next couple weeks and give us some ideas of where to park how to park and what to look for so lord bless you for those of you that are watching the one or two of you it's nice and that you've got it you can share your information brother chris go ahead and share with everybody god bless you just quick quick update as brother david said we're going to have one entrance in therefore we're going to have one exit so as he mentioned we're going to have the main entrance that's the original entrance of the building so as you come in there'll be somebody standing there to guide you through the parking lot you'll come all the way through the parking lot back to where brother david parks there's a thorough way back there you'll swing around and then we'll have people in the overflow parking lot that will help assist line the cars out and park them with that being said one entrance we have one exit so if we could get your help parents with children and really everybody if we could just be alert because we're going to have a lot of traffic coming through and exiting at the same time so let's all just kind of work together to help keep an eye on everybody same thing in exiting we're going to have people stationed out there to really kind of flag us on our way out so that way we can be on the lookout other than that okay that's it thank you that's the parking so uh my architect looked at me and he said brother david you're in the ugly phase of your project well we're going to go forward so things are going good god's moving on us and providing for us working on our behalf and he just seems to be appearing on the scene every day and so we're going to have great progress so remember the purpose that we're going is not for our own personal comfort but to find that last one to share this message everybody should have a right and when you're convinced it's the truth and you're convinced that this message will produce the character of christ in you and when the character of christ is in you you'll do the works that he did when his spirit is in you you'll have the concerns that he have you'll have the desire that he had that all men would be saved and that's what he is and and um i'm i'm anxious to get the building project behind us that we've take like i've said we've used four hundred thousand dollars of the tithing for the building for the get the ministry established to get the outreach established and then i'm anxious to start having that money freed up for the ministry and the missions the local ministry the outreach ministry and just to have us grow in the unity of love so um that's uh just a little update uh maybe it could have been put together but um better but we what we realized was that uh we realized with the construction it was not a good idea to have service tonight so someone said why don't you just give a report let everybody know well i'm not good at technology or reports but kayla bill did what he could thank you for chris and um on all six of seven eight of us that are here tonight this reminds me of the old covid days god got us through that god will get us through this night so god bless everybody we love you and we just trust that this little bit of information would help you and let you know where we're headed and we'll try to put together a little more sophisticated reports in the near future so god bless you so much let's bow our heads in prayer as we're going to sign off tonight and if you have a special prayer request or need tonight if the lord
