[40:17] amen amen the great one that sets us
[40:20] free thank you
[40:23] Lord to Be Free as a wonderful
[40:30] thing they said the slaves when the hour
[40:34] come that they could go free
[40:37] after being tore from their country
[40:42] and brought into the evils of man's
[40:46] greediness
[40:49] and to be treated like they weren't even
[40:52] human
[40:54] beings but one day there was a
[40:58] proclamation that they could go
[41:01] free and at the Sunrise of that great
[41:05] day not everybody could make it to the
[41:08] top of the
[41:11] hill but the one at the top when he saw
[41:14] that
[41:15] sun break from that behind Earth's
[41:19] turning
[41:21] Shadow and he saw that first glimpse of
[41:24] light he said I'm free
[41:27] amen he didn't run off but he passed the
[41:31] ne message down I'm free and the next
[41:36] one said I'm free and I'm free Lord and
[41:39] it's come down all the way to our
[41:42] age father that we're free we thank you
[41:46] for it we ask you to bless us this
[41:48] evening in Jesus precious name we pray
[41:53] amen amen God bless you let's open our
[41:56] Bibles too to uh the book of Romans and
[42:00] you know I I really don't like to come
[42:02] to church without a tie but I just
[42:05] couldn't figure out what color to wear
[42:07] with this shirt
[42:08] so and so I decided not to wear one so I
[42:13] was going to put one on but then I can
[42:15] just see lesie saying oh my goodness
[42:17] that don't match you know and then I
[42:21] thought well uh I I thought if I wore a
[42:26] tie that didn't match
[42:28] that wouldn't be forgotten as easy as if
[42:31] I didn't wear a tie at all so that's why
[42:35] we did it we just want to fellowship
[42:37] tonight seems like a this looks like an
[42:39] ice cream crowd to
[42:41] me so
[42:43] um anybody that wants to go get ice
[42:46] cream after service it's a my treat so
[42:50] uh and all you that don't start running
[42:52] to church now all you that are staying
[42:54] home so you can get a free ice cream you
[42:57] love God's word amen just a just a night
[43:01] of fellowship and everything that uh we
[43:05] kind of got uh called out the last night
[43:09] uh for a
[43:11] um kind of the work of the Lord so we
[43:15] went to wakeo last night about 10:00 I
[43:18] guess or so and got in early this
[43:20] morning and uh and uh we were glad we
[43:24] did because God's a good God amen so
[43:28] let's turn to Romans
[43:30] the the 12th chapter and and uh and know
[43:36] want to kind of go down the same lines
[43:39] that we were talking about and and
[43:44] uh
[43:46] um you know it it's it's hard not to get
[43:51] discouraged listening to the
[43:53] news you know what I mean so sometimes
[43:57] you just got to say I'm just not turning
[43:59] it on CU what I don't care what's going
[44:02] on in the world God's got something
[44:05] going
[44:06] on and I know that to be the truth so we
[44:09] just got to stick with but listen this
[44:11] says this I beseech you therefore
[44:13] Brethren by the mercies of God that ye
[44:17] present your bodies a Living
[44:21] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[44:25] is your reasonable service and be not
[44:29] conformed to this world but be
[44:34] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[44:39] that ye
[44:40] may prove what is the good and
[44:44] acceptable and perfect will of God
[44:48] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your
[44:50] word amen you may be
[44:53] seated isn't that uh
[44:57] uh a great thing you know to to prove
[45:01] something or is to put it to the test if
[45:06] you could say that that it meets um it
[45:11] it meets its
[45:13] testimony so okay if maybe I that's not
[45:17] the best word I could use but it if
[45:20] someone claim something and then you
[45:24] test it to see if it you prove prove it
[45:27] to see if it is what it says it is and
[45:31] and that's what God wants he wants us to
[45:34] to be
[45:35] transformed that we might uh that we
[45:39] might know what the will of God is for
[45:43] our lives and I got this to thinking on
[45:46] that thought and and uh and this little
[45:50] thought come to me just in fellowship
[45:52] tonight but you know I begin to ask
[45:55] myself how did I get
[45:58] here you know how how did I get here in
[46:02] other words uh uh to transform means to
[46:07] be changed from one thing to another so
[46:14] to get from where that I was to where
[46:18] that I am I had to go through
[46:22] changes to there there's a a a lot of
[46:26] changes a lot of things transpired uh
[46:30] things that I I didn't know would happen
[46:33] and things that caught me by surprise
[46:36] things that were unexpected not only did
[46:39] I go through changes by experiences but
[46:42] I went through through changes just by
[46:45] simply growing and and and having the
[46:49] life that was in
[46:51] me the natural life that was in me begin
[46:57] to transform me you know I mean if I
[47:01] could have chosen uh probably somewhere
[47:05] along the way that I would uh have
[47:08] stopped my progress you know I I have
[47:11] some really fond memories when I was 10
[47:15] and 11 years old and I started fishing
[47:18] ocean fishing and being out in those
[47:21] boats and catching those fish I mean I
[47:24] just thought that was great and maybe
[47:27] through those few years and then into
[47:29] high school a little bit uh those were
[47:31] great times but I I wasn't able to stay
[47:36] there you I wanted to stay there and if
[47:39] it was given me you you know what I mean
[47:43] uh uh probably even from the natural
[47:47] side you know when I was on the water
[47:50] and my hair was a little longer than it
[47:53] is now and a little more of it and you
[47:56] know and I I was baked by the sun I just
[48:00] thought that was something you know just
[48:03] uh uh that was before the sun caused
[48:07] skin cancer you know what I mean uh and
[48:10] everybody wanted you to be Lily white
[48:13] you know the Browner we could get the
[48:15] better you know and uh and
[48:19] so but I couldn't stop
[48:23] it you understand the very natural light
[48:28] that was in me was
[48:31] created to
[48:33] change created to take me from one place
[48:37] to another and that's what transform
[48:41] means to change from one thing to
[48:44] something else so just when I begin to
[48:47] sit back I begin to look at it in a lot
[48:50] of different ways how did I get to be
[48:52] almost 75 years old you know I mean
[48:56] there had to be a lot of Grace along the
[48:59] way you know a lot of my friends never
[49:01] made it I come up around the Vietnam War
[49:04] and a lot of my senior class I went to
[49:07] war and at we can go to my high school
[49:11] and there's a walk down the high school
[49:13] and there's the people that lost their
[49:15] lives in in the war and of course I I
[49:19] knew those fellas and that that played a
[49:22] big part in my life that war did but I
[49:26] begin to think that something there had
[49:28] to be something I went through
[49:31] changes and so we know the natural types
[49:35] the spiritual we can we can rest assure
[49:38] of that can't we that the natural types
[49:42] that uh the the
[49:44] spiritual and though I may have not
[49:47] liked a lot of things and and and I even
[49:51] you know I tried to alter a few things
[49:53] you know I I wanted to be taller so I
[49:56] used to hang on the bar you know with
[49:58] weights on my feet and uh could do that
[50:02] and I wanted to be bigger here you know
[50:05] what I mean I lifted weights I I wanted
[50:07] to be pumped you know I mean but but I
[50:11] transformed and it it it fell from here
[50:14] to
[50:15] here and and that that
[50:20] happened with with I could say this
[50:23] without my consent
[50:30] you know I mean uh I don't like that
[50:34] that now that number in my closet is
[50:37] half of 80 you know I mean something's
[50:40] wrong with that picture you you know so
[50:43] now I'm trying to do everything I can
[50:45] and it's hard to reverse those processes
[50:49] you know I went and bought the stuff you
[50:51] put on your head you know what I mean
[50:53] that supposed to make it grow and then
[50:55] they you know
[50:57] and at $90 a bottle if it didn't do it
[51:00] the first time budy I wouldn't getting
[51:02] it no more you know so that's that's
[51:06] just uh the process but what what my
[51:09] point of view is is that transformation
[51:14] is a law of
[51:18] God and it it's not something as hard as
[51:22] man tries to do it it's not something
[51:25] that can be reversed
[51:27] first and and it it's it's sort of
[51:30] something that we've almost got to come
[51:34] to the realization of to have
[51:38] understanding to come to the place that
[51:41] you can understand that the footsteps of
[51:43] the righteous are ordered by the Lord
[51:46] that there's many things that are
[51:48] transpiring all around you and things
[51:51] are changing all around you the world's
[51:54] changing
[51:56] kids it's it it it's falling apart and
[52:00] you know and I you know I'm going
[52:02] through this uh quite the time in my
[52:04] life with my mom but my mom the other
[52:07] day woke up in the night and called
[52:09] lesie in and lesie come in and my mom
[52:12] looked at her and she says the world's
[52:14] falling
[52:16] apart he thought that's the
[52:20] truth you know it's the truth it is it's
[52:23] falling apart you know uh obviously
[52:26] she's going back to those reflective
[52:28] times and things like that so I begin to
[52:31] kind of ask how how did I get here how
[52:34] what brought me here this
[52:37] evening to be standing in in at this
[52:42] desk um without a matching tie speaking
[52:46] to those of you who decided to come out
[52:49] here
[52:53] tonight it happened and somebody was in
[52:56] control of it and and it had a purpose
[53:00] you know and so you know I kind of look
[53:02] at this great well even the process of
[53:06] transformation in my life you know from
[53:09] me being just a a a Catholic a a a a
[53:15] school boy I I my parents were catholic
[53:18] I was born into a Catholic home and my
[53:21] mom was a devout Catholic and my dad was
[53:24] non-religious you know he didn't stop my
[53:27] mom from doing everything but my dad
[53:29] didn't go to church he didn't go to mass
[53:32] he worked and when I had concerned about
[53:36] it my mom told me she says well your dad
[53:38] offers his work up to God and and uh I
[53:43] didn't pursue to uh probe that any
[53:48] further you know I just accepted that
[53:51] that things were that way they were and
[53:53] I went about about my life and and so I
[53:56] was raised a Catholic and I was uh I
[53:59] went to Catholic school and you know I
[54:03] was a an an altar boy and and as we
[54:07] talked a little bit uh last Sunday
[54:10] morning that that whole experience was
[54:13] built on fear you know just a a a fear
[54:17] that uh uh uh you know I might go to the
[54:22] bad place you know and and I I I tried
[54:25] to do everything I could because I I was
[54:28] I I wasn't a angel when I grew up I I
[54:32] had a lot of disorders and I had
[54:34] attention deficit disorder and facial
[54:37] recognition disorder and and I was
[54:41] stubborn and I didn't want to learn and
[54:44] I'd rather be someplace else and school
[54:47] and discipline didn't fit my
[54:49] nature you know the problem is
[54:52] discipline is a part of
[54:54] Christianity and that's why we need a
[54:56] nature
[54:58] change uh but you know so you know I
[55:01] tried to do everything I could to to uh
[55:05] make it to Heaven you know I said
[55:07] prayers I became an altar boy I went to
[55:10] mass I said the rosary I called out on
[55:13] the name of the Lord every time I saw
[55:15] the priest I'd tell them all my sins you
[55:18] know I I I just had this a a fear that
[55:24] was on me that whatever happened and I I
[55:27] I had to go to heaven in fact I I even
[55:31] would dream at night and and consider it
[55:35] that that maybe I could be a martyr you
[55:38] know that I could give my life for the
[55:41] uh my physical Natural Life uh to the
[55:45] for the Catholic church that then I'd be
[55:48] a martyr you know because Martyrs made
[55:51] it to Heaven
[55:53] regardless you know I never knew there
[55:55] was a life given for
[55:57] me you know what I'm saying but but
[56:01] that's the what how I grew up and that's
[56:03] what I came through it and I went to
[56:06] Catholic grade school and then I from
[56:08] Catholic grade school I went to Catholic
[56:10] High School and and then towards the end
[56:12] of my Catholic High School year you know
[56:14] the Vietnam War popped
[56:16] up and you know there was a big you know
[56:20] uh uh we were in California and and
[56:24] there was protest if we' sit down in the
[56:27] evening and and there was protest all
[56:30] over the uh television and so many
[56:34] people died today so many people died
[56:37] today and and and people were dying and
[56:39] nobody knew why and we'd see this all
[56:42] and then there was all this and they had
[56:44] a big of the convention in
[56:47] 1968 uh there was a great big riots and
[56:50] everything and everything was
[56:52] anti-war and everything and my people
[56:55] were getting getting drafted you know
[56:57] what I mean my friends were getting
[56:58] drafted and and and then I got a number
[57:02] to get
[57:04] drafted and that was
[57:06] scary and so I figured right then I'm
[57:09] I'm out of here you know and it just
[57:13] this I I decided that I I would become a
[57:18] hippie you know I so I
[57:21] changed you know almost
[57:24] like you know just the opposite just
[57:27] that I went through a change you know
[57:31] what I'm saying I I dropped out of high
[57:33] school none of this stuff I'm proud of
[57:36] you know I I dropped out of society the
[57:38] best I could I I thought that I would
[57:41] make a living uh making moccasins and
[57:44] sandals and selling little beads on the
[57:46] street corner you know what I mean and
[57:49] and walking around peace and love and
[57:52] you know people would come out tourists
[57:54] would come out of town and they asked me
[57:56] if they could take their picture with me
[58:00] cuz they wanted a picture of a real
[58:02] genuine uh hippie you know cuz uh that
[58:06] was kind of people were looking at a
[58:08] hippie and I say yeah you know and they
[58:10] give me a few dollars you know what I
[58:12] mean so I just kind of work my way
[58:14] around to where tourists are you know
[58:16] what I mean see if they want to get the
[58:19] a hippie
[58:21] picture and but I I I was I went through
[58:25] that time of my life I went through that
[58:28] the the mindsets that I was in right but
[58:31] something had to renew my
[58:35] mind you know I mean like something that
[58:38] took my mind from school uh you know
[58:42] this might be a scary brother James but
[58:45] when they did my aptitude test they said
[58:48] that uh I would make a good
[58:52] pilot I don't think he'd want to be in
[58:54] the cockpit with me
[58:56] you know what I mean but you know so I I
[58:59] had all these things and things that
[59:02] something was changing
[59:05] me you understand that I didn't have
[59:09] control out
[59:11] of I just think of that I'm coming
[59:14] through life my my my physical State's
[59:18] changing my mental State's changing I'm
[59:21] going through changes I'm going through
[59:24] transformation
[59:26] I'm going through things that I like the
[59:29] things that I I don't like you know I
[59:31] eat things today that I would never have
[59:33] eaten as a
[59:35] teenager you you know what I mean just
[59:39] and so you come through this trans you
[59:42] come through this
[59:43] transformation and and you know can then
[59:46] you you know like when I I went through
[59:48] my my hippie stage you know what I mean
[59:51] so then I was into the Zodiac you know
[59:55] what I mean and then I was into
[59:57] numerology and
[59:59] spiritualism and toggo cards and and all
[1:00:03] these things and every one of those
[1:00:06] steps was really I was trying to renew
[1:00:08] my mind renew my mind get a new mindset
[1:00:12] on life get a new mindset on on the
[1:00:16] situation I couldn't go for forward with
[1:00:19] the mindset that I was in with the
[1:00:23] thought process that I was in could with
[1:00:26] the with the way that I perceive things
[1:00:29] and so along with my physical
[1:00:31] transformation had to come a mental
[1:00:35] transformation you know and and all of
[1:00:37] us that have have teenagers you know
[1:00:39] there's just that magical age you come
[1:00:41] from that stage where you know
[1:00:44] everything you know and uh I
[1:00:48] remember calling my dad one time my dad
[1:00:51] called me and and lesie answered the
[1:00:53] phone and my dad said uh where David he
[1:00:56] says well he's he's got the toilet off
[1:01:00] of in the bathroom getting a hairbrush
[1:01:02] out of it that one of the kids flushed
[1:01:05] down and I could just hear him
[1:01:09] laughing you know now I'm was going
[1:01:11] through what he went through you know
[1:01:16] the the things that transpired so we
[1:01:18] went through those things and I remember
[1:01:20] I can remember to this day that when I
[1:01:24] started uh uh you know I went I was in
[1:01:27] the drug culture and and you know and I
[1:01:30] had contacts for drugs and and I part of
[1:01:34] the way I survived was selling a little
[1:01:36] bit of drugs and and I think I'm past
[1:01:38] the statue of limitations I hope but
[1:01:42] uh um that's just how it was and uh and
[1:01:47] so we we went through that and I got I
[1:01:50] got hanging with these guys and and and
[1:01:53] I remember that night so much in my life
[1:01:56] you know we had some of the motorcycle
[1:01:58] gangs in the my house there and and
[1:02:02] different people from different things
[1:02:04] and rock musicians and everything and
[1:02:06] had this party going on and all of a
[1:02:10] sudden out of the middle of nowhere I
[1:02:14] became totally
[1:02:17] overwhelmed and I looked around and I
[1:02:20] mean it was nothing but pure
[1:02:23] evil I couldn't believe what I was
[1:02:25] seeing
[1:02:26] you know I mean you know I read Romans I
[1:02:30] didn't read it at that day later on I
[1:02:33] saw what I in Romans what I read men
[1:02:36] with wi doing things with unseemingly
[1:02:39] just just and I remember just I for out
[1:02:42] of the middle of
[1:02:44] nowhere I went down I fell on my knees
[1:02:48] and I said God help
[1:02:50] me I don't know what I am but I'm not
[1:02:55] this
[1:02:58] that's all they
[1:03:00] knew I didn't realize what that was I'd
[1:03:03] called my folks and said you know I
[1:03:06] think I'm just going to go ahead and end
[1:03:08] it all you know or and you know you have
[1:03:12] thoughts suicidal thoughts and and and
[1:03:15] you know I don't know nowadays it's kind
[1:03:18] of popular to have them but don't
[1:03:20] entertain that kind of stuff because
[1:03:22] there's Spirits out there that are
[1:03:24] trying to latch on do it you you know
[1:03:27] what I mean uh uh when I first come to
[1:03:32] the message we'd never roll a pair of
[1:03:35] dice you know what I mean we never I
[1:03:37] never play a board game with dice
[1:03:39] because it just there a spirit that goes
[1:03:41] with it you know what I
[1:03:43] mean and you know we went to the little
[1:03:45] spinning wheel or something so we didn't
[1:03:49] we didn't have to roll them dice you
[1:03:51] know we had we had all kinds of of of
[1:03:54] Standards you know that we wanted to
[1:03:56] hold to because uh we knew the world was
[1:03:59] coming after us and when we first came
[1:04:02] to the message you knew the world was
[1:04:04] coming after you nowadays it doesn't
[1:04:07] seem like anybody thinks the world's
[1:04:08] coming after him they think like Satan's
[1:04:12] uh taking a vacation but he hasn't taken
[1:04:16] a vacation he's actually changed his
[1:04:18] form into where he appears as an angel
[1:04:21] of Light and thinks that he's doing
[1:04:24] everybody thinks he's doing doing so
[1:04:26] well and he's destroying M
[1:04:30] mankind where where people won't even
[1:04:32] know what it means to get back to family
[1:04:35] decency he's destroying the
[1:04:38] family he's he's he's destroying
[1:04:42] everything that that's Godly if the
[1:04:46] whole country hardly wants to retain God
[1:04:49] in its knowledge anymore you can't you
[1:04:52] can't talk about God they they they they
[1:04:55] mock it openly I guess like they did at
[1:04:58] this mocking this last supper uh thing
[1:05:02] that I I you know I'm almost afraid to
[1:05:06] watch
[1:05:08] it but you go through those you know you
[1:05:12] go through those Transformations so I
[1:05:16] come from all the way to this place to
[1:05:19] you know I cried out for God to help me
[1:05:22] and then I
[1:05:24] heard a t
[1:05:29] okay
[1:05:31] now you
[1:05:32] know why did I
[1:05:36] believe you know wh why did what I heard
[1:05:40] touch
[1:05:45] me I had no connection with it you
[1:05:49] understand no upbringing in it no reason
[1:05:53] to uh I didn't know who the man was I
[1:05:57] didn't know what he stood for I didn't
[1:06:00] know anything uh uh about his background
[1:06:04] his upbringing his ministry or
[1:06:07] anything I didn't know he prayed for the
[1:06:10] sick I I didn't know that he fulfilled
[1:06:14] Malachi 4:5 I didn't know he had a place
[1:06:17] in the scripture I didn't know
[1:06:21] anything alls I know was is that I meant
[1:06:24] the Lord I read Romans chapter 1 I saw
[1:06:27] it was real and the scriptures just
[1:06:30] spoke out to me and when I heard that
[1:06:33] tape and I heard that voice that two
[1:06:35] voices were similar the effect it had on
[1:06:38] me was the same effect that it had on me
[1:06:41] when I read the scripture there was a
[1:06:42] total
[1:06:43] dovetail a total Unity but that that and
[1:06:49] and it it spoke to
[1:06:52] me I didn't I didn't need it
[1:06:57] explained I didn't need to know what was
[1:07:01] happening just like I didn't realize as
[1:07:05] I grew up that I was
[1:07:08] transforming it was a transforming
[1:07:12] event something that was going to cause
[1:07:15] a change now was going to
[1:07:19] transform because God's a
[1:07:24] Transformer he transforms You by
[1:07:27] Renewing Your Mind by the renewing of
[1:07:30] your mind I begin to replace fears with
[1:07:34] the word I begin to place my replace my
[1:07:38] ambitions with what I thought his will
[1:07:42] was the best I could so there was a
[1:07:44] there's a a transformation that takes
[1:07:47] place there's a law of transformation in
[1:07:50] God's word a law of
[1:07:53] change he never brought me to any spot
[1:07:57] along the road and quit changing
[1:08:04] me that's why I'm still getting
[1:08:07] older I don't care how much stuff they
[1:08:10] have on the Shelf you can eat all of
[1:08:12] them relief Factor you know what I mean
[1:08:17] uh you know this stress bug and this and
[1:08:19] this and that and you can eat them all
[1:08:22] you
[1:08:22] know and you're not going to stop
[1:08:26] it it's a law of
[1:08:29] God if you live long enough you'll just
[1:08:33] keep adding time but you'll change
[1:08:37] you'll change you'll change you'll
[1:08:40] always
[1:08:43] change and so we and that's what I
[1:08:49] just
[1:08:51] uh God just is is so on my heart is the
[1:08:57] for us to come to the understanding that
[1:09:01] we haven't
[1:09:06] arrived and that's what happened to
[1:09:08] every denomination and every religion if
[1:09:13] they got to the place they had their
[1:09:15] doctrines they had their way of dress
[1:09:18] they had their
[1:09:19] teachings and they set up
[1:09:23] camp they said this is what we believe
[1:09:26] we've arrived now we're going to
[1:09:28] continue in our lifestyle for what we do
[1:09:32] every day we're we're just going to hang
[1:09:35] on to what we've got and and there
[1:09:38] there's there's there there's nothing
[1:09:44] more and you can try to change you can
[1:09:48] try to stop the
[1:09:51] transformation
[1:09:53] process but if you're genuine seed of
[1:09:57] God you
[1:10:00] can't you can't you can't stop
[1:10:03] it it it's it's alive and it's real and
[1:10:08] and and just as much as we change so you
[1:10:12] could take your spiritual condition
[1:10:15] right now I could look at what I am
[1:10:18] right now for whatever understandings I
[1:10:22] have Revelations I have and look back 30
[1:10:27] years to right when I first became a
[1:10:31] Christian and I could I could if I had a
[1:10:34] way if I had some tool that measured
[1:10:38] that I should have the understanding in
[1:10:40] my heart that I should be the same
[1:10:43] distance from where I am now down the
[1:10:48] road in Greater understanding great
[1:10:51] greater spiritual St greater discernment
[1:10:55] greater control of the
[1:10:57] circumstances a greater understanding
[1:11:00] what the will of God is for my life but
[1:11:04] I I'll never do that without the
[1:11:06] renewing of my mind and if I let my mind
[1:11:10] become
[1:11:14] stagnant and then what what it why did
[1:11:17] he say pray for
[1:11:20] Revelation Revelation comes to your
[1:11:22] thinking first and then it drops into
[1:11:26] your heart and becomes faith it comes to
[1:11:29] as an understanding and then it drops
[1:11:31] into your heart can you realizes that
[1:11:34] it's real and you let it change you you
[1:11:38] let it pull you you let it transform you
[1:11:42] and the the hardest thing for us is that
[1:11:45] is that God wants us to get to the place
[1:11:49] uh that we could have uh a confidence
[1:11:56] and and and that he wants to that he
[1:11:58] wants to make us to understand that he's
[1:12:03] transforming us to
[1:12:07] something he wants us to come to the
[1:12:10] place and sit back and say I'm not I'm
[1:12:12] not
[1:12:14] finished he's not
[1:12:17] finished can I I just when I look at the
[1:12:20] sheath offering I look at where brother
[1:12:23] renam was how he handled situation
[1:12:25] the things he saw the things he spoke
[1:12:28] the understanding he spoke and he spoke
[1:12:30] those things that we too might come to
[1:12:33] that
[1:12:34] maturity that we too might come to that
[1:12:37] love that we too might come to that
[1:12:40] fearlessness of standing with God's word
[1:12:44] and not being
[1:12:47] afraid but if we if we get to the place
[1:12:51] where we're afraid to change
[1:12:56] and nobody likes to
[1:13:00] change the older you get the less change
[1:13:03] you want that's
[1:13:06] right you know you got places for this
[1:13:09] and places for that you know what I mean
[1:13:12] and you get grumpy and you say who Moved
[1:13:14] My
[1:13:17] Ruler or I put my stuff I hate it when
[1:13:21] somebody comes and cleans my
[1:13:24] desk what happened to my
[1:13:28] papers I put that paper on top of that
[1:13:30] dresser for a reason if I can remember
[1:13:33] why I'll I'll come get it but don't move
[1:13:35] it don't move this don't move that it's
[1:13:38] here it's up here for a reason it's over
[1:13:40] here for a reason it's under this stack
[1:13:43] for a reason I know it's there
[1:13:45] somewhere you just don't want any
[1:13:48] change you don't want you you want to
[1:13:52] stop the process you hit a spot that
[1:13:56] you're
[1:13:57] comfortable you hit a spot that you
[1:14:00] finally feel good about yourself you
[1:14:03] finally you finally feel
[1:14:05] great and I would have stopped it at
[1:14:08] like I said between 10 and 21 I would
[1:14:11] have if I that's I felt great I would
[1:14:13] have stopped it but you can't stop
[1:14:17] it I've got to come to the realization
[1:14:20] that there's a transformation taken in
[1:14:23] me not only is it taking place in me
[1:14:26] naturally but there's also a
[1:14:28] transformation and a growth that has got
[1:14:31] to be taking place within us
[1:14:37] spiritually our Natures have got to
[1:14:40] mature our workload our spiritual
[1:14:45] workload needs to
[1:14:49] increase lay for yourself a pattern of
[1:14:51] good works
[1:14:55] it's got to
[1:14:56] increase it's got to I I I'll just use
[1:14:59] the word expand your Gates have got to
[1:15:02] expand the the the the footsteps of your
[1:15:06] possession has got to
[1:15:09] grow a revelation has got to
[1:15:14] increase he's got it there for
[1:15:17] us and that's why Satan tries to wrap Us
[1:15:22] in
[1:15:23] fear that where we're we're afraid to
[1:15:26] step out we're afraid to go into the
[1:15:28] unknown we're afraid to have anything
[1:15:31] transpire in our thinking or in our
[1:15:33] nature where we'll be in a place that
[1:15:35] we've never experienced
[1:15:40] before we we don't we we we almost get
[1:15:45] timid but if we can come to the
[1:15:47] realization praise God this is a part of
[1:15:50] what that he's doing in his word the
[1:15:52] seed that he put in me was put in me to
[1:15:56] transform into what that he wanted it to
[1:15:59] be and to produce the fruits that he
[1:16:01] wanted it to be it never was put there
[1:16:04] to grab a hold of a Theology and a
[1:16:08] belief it was put there to produce
[1:16:14] fruit Absol
[1:16:17] substance of Life
[1:16:19] character and divine attributes
[1:16:25] now it's tough when you look in the
[1:16:27] mirror to think that you could be
[1:16:30] transformed into the possession of
[1:16:33] divine
[1:16:37] attributes our sinful
[1:16:40] background are
[1:16:42] flesh Wars against the spirit and the
[1:16:46] spirit against the Flesh and these two
[1:16:48] are contrary to another the carnal mind
[1:16:51] is an enity with God
[1:16:55] right but we got to say wait a minute
[1:16:57] this carnal mind is not what binds
[1:17:01] me it's the seed the power of
[1:17:06] transformation that's in the seed that's
[1:17:09] in
[1:17:12] me I just got to let it move am I got to
[1:17:16] let it
[1:17:20] work I can't I can't count myself out
[1:17:27] right if I look back in my past all the
[1:17:30] things I said all the things I do Satan
[1:17:33] would Rob the victory I have right
[1:17:37] now you don't belong in the Pulpit you
[1:17:40] don't have no good you're you're grumpy
[1:17:42] you're old you're withered you got no
[1:17:45] strength you know come my goodness he's
[1:17:47] an accuser of the Brethren he'll write a
[1:17:50] list on you that if you believe it it
[1:17:53] it'll stop you in your track I don't
[1:17:55] care what you've done what mistakes you
[1:17:57] made if your name was written on that
[1:17:59] Lamb's Book of Life He's Got The Power
[1:18:01] of transformation in you to overcome
[1:18:04] every
[1:18:05] obstacle and your history should not
[1:18:08] stop you from being what God wants you
[1:18:11] to be and what you can be in Christ
[1:18:17] Jesus no wonder he said leave those
[1:18:19] things which are behind and press for
[1:18:21] the mark of the higher calling
[1:18:26] amen be ready to
[1:18:29] change be ready to be made
[1:18:33] different so many churches and places
[1:18:38] that that they get the people and they
[1:18:40] they get a certain form of conduct and
[1:18:43] they want to just hold everybody into
[1:18:46] that line of
[1:18:49] conduct nobody can leave their spot
[1:18:52] nobody can leave their place everybody's
[1:18:55] got their position everybody's got their
[1:18:58] seat in the church and everybody sings
[1:19:01] What songs they sing and everything I'll
[1:19:04] never forget one time somebody come out
[1:19:06] I was in a meeting and a sister come out
[1:19:08] and she said that sister sang my
[1:19:11] song I said I didn't know you wrote that
[1:19:15] song you should be glad that somebody
[1:19:19] sung
[1:19:20] it can you imagine me going up on they
[1:19:22] sang Amazing Grace that's what my song
[1:19:30] can you understand what I'm saying if
[1:19:32] our
[1:19:33] minds aren't
[1:19:35] renewed by the stimulation of God's word
[1:19:39] that we are in a
[1:19:42] transformation process we're not done
[1:19:45] transforming we're not done
[1:19:48] changing he can change
[1:19:51] us he can make us difference you're not
[1:19:53] children some of of you are young and
[1:19:56] you're growing day by day it's marvelous
[1:19:59] it's marvelous that we can see life in
[1:20:02] you it lets all of us know that there's
[1:20:05] youth still there to be
[1:20:09] had what would you do if Society no more
[1:20:12] life
[1:20:15] came right we would know that it was on
[1:20:18] its
[1:20:19] path to
[1:20:22] ending there would be no life
[1:20:25] no hope no
[1:20:29] continuation it would be
[1:20:31] over but now we sit back and we look
[1:20:35] around us and we say the world's
[1:20:37] transforming why because everything's a
[1:20:39] shadow everything's a type there's
[1:20:42] transformation taking place in us and I
[1:20:44] just want to close with this is
[1:20:48] that we can't stop
[1:20:52] changing okay we're going to we're we're
[1:20:55] going to go into places we've never been
[1:20:59] you can't be afraid to step out in
[1:21:02] faith you can't be afraid to to to to to
[1:21:08] make a an adjustment if I could use that
[1:21:11] word in your life or or do something in
[1:21:14] your life that brings you closer to the
[1:21:16] kingdom of God you've got to know that
[1:21:19] it's that it's him that's creating this
[1:21:22] desire in your heart to be
[1:21:26] different to change and he can change
[1:21:30] you you're not
[1:21:34] stuck you're not stuck with a
[1:21:37] habit you're not stuck with a
[1:21:40] weakness you're not stuck with
[1:21:44] bitterness you're not stuck with with
[1:21:47] frustration or
[1:21:50] complexes he's a transforming God he can
[1:21:53] change you from all all those
[1:21:56] things he just wants a people that that
[1:21:59] says Lord I know you can change me I
[1:22:02] know that we're we're changing I know
[1:22:04] you want to make me different life's
[1:22:07] different I want to rise above where I'm
[1:22:09] at I want to be more like you I I know
[1:22:13] that's a possibility for me because
[1:22:16] there's something in me I've watched you
[1:22:18] take me from the first tape that I've
[1:22:22] had I've watched all that you've done in
[1:22:24] my life
[1:22:26] life and I don't want to sit and build a
[1:22:31] camp and write a history
[1:22:36] book I don't want to write a book on
[1:22:38] what
[1:22:40] was but I want to have a desire in my
[1:22:43] heart for what's going to be yes how are
[1:22:46] you going to use me
[1:22:49] Lord what door are you open for me who
[1:22:52] you going to have me pray for who you
[1:22:54] going to have me witness
[1:22:59] to I I'm I'm I I'm not going to stay
[1:23:02] where I'm at I'm moving I'm moving in my
[1:23:05] soul I'm moving in my
[1:23:08] spirit and and that's what God does he
[1:23:11] makes us
[1:23:13] different that's what transferring to
[1:23:15] make different than it
[1:23:17] was to be made different than it was it
[1:23:20] doesn't mean that what it was was bad
[1:23:24] why do every time we just think that we
[1:23:26] got we're transformed from bad to good
[1:23:30] from bad to
[1:23:31] good how about from good to
[1:23:34] better from better to even more
[1:23:39] better to most
[1:23:41] better than triple
[1:23:44] better whatever you know why not good
[1:23:47] from good to
[1:23:50] good why why not
[1:23:53] from doesn't have to be from bitter to
[1:23:56] sweet but how about from sweet to more
[1:23:59] loving more caring more
[1:24:02] giving more awareness of other people's
[1:24:05] needs less
[1:24:12] selfishness he's going to take care of
[1:24:16] you
[1:24:20] right and and I'm going to read the
[1:24:22] quote in closing the musicians can
[1:24:28] come and this is what brother bandam
[1:24:31] says and it it just really struck me in
[1:24:33] a special way it says but I'm so glad
[1:24:37] that God is mindful of us
[1:24:43] again now now think about it I thought
[1:24:47] you know that's almost like we've got
[1:24:50] the prophet warned about us we we feel
[1:24:52] the message has been given
[1:24:54] it's all on
[1:24:56] tape he's he he just listen to it and do
[1:25:00] what he says and he's just kind of
[1:25:03] standing
[1:25:05] back he's got nothing for us to
[1:25:08] do he's got no more Works he's got no
[1:25:12] more testifying no more souls to
[1:25:15] win alls we're doing is camping
[1:25:20] out but he's mindful of us
[1:25:23] again he's mindful of the condition he's
[1:25:26] mindful of the hour you don't think
[1:25:29] God's mindful of what's going on in our
[1:25:34] country you don't think he's mindful of
[1:25:38] the of the persecution and destruction
[1:25:41] and and mockery and hypocrisy that we're
[1:25:45] going to be facing every
[1:25:47] day he's mindful amen amen but what's he
[1:25:52] going to provide for you to
[1:25:55] you to get you through it he's going to
[1:25:58] provide change change of your heart
[1:26:01] change of your mind change of your
[1:26:07] attitude things that used to gripe you
[1:26:09] you'll be able just to say
[1:26:14] okay I was eing the other day and I
[1:26:17] ordered something and it didn't come out
[1:26:19] right and they took it back and and and
[1:26:22] and you know they take 35 5 minutes I
[1:26:24] just sat there said I am not going to
[1:26:27] let this burn
[1:26:31] me I'm not going to say anything to her
[1:26:34] when it gets here thank you I'll eat
[1:26:38] it and I'm not going to do
[1:26:44] it I thought why I'm changing because I
[1:26:48] felt like going back there and letting
[1:26:49] the cook know and let them know how to
[1:26:52] run that restaurant
[1:26:57] you know they they needed
[1:27:00] me forget it here get
[1:27:04] it turn off the
[1:27:06] radio use your paper for
[1:27:09] firewood God's got something for his
[1:27:12] children you don't have to be afraid of
[1:27:15] the preacher you don't have to be afraid
[1:27:17] of the church you don't have to be
[1:27:19] afraid fear not little flock fear not
[1:27:22] little flock it's the father good
[1:27:24] pleasure to give you the
[1:27:27] kingdom and and and he so he says he
[1:27:31] says he's still he said God for mindful
[1:27:36] us of us
[1:27:39] again that he can still move upon the
[1:27:45] face of the
[1:27:52] condition these words are so prophetic
[1:27:57] so orchestrated by the holy spirit so
[1:28:02] constructed by the word of God to renew
[1:28:05] our mind he's mindful of us to move on
[1:28:08] the condition well when he moves on the
[1:28:12] condition what is the move going to do
[1:28:16] change the condition no it's going to
[1:28:18] transform
[1:28:21] you the change is taking place in you
[1:28:25] we're not going to be left here and the
[1:28:27] world raptures
[1:28:30] away right we're going it'll stay the
[1:28:35] same they'll still go to church they'll
[1:28:37] still be getting saved they'll still be
[1:28:39] singing songs and the elect will be gone
[1:28:42] they'll be transformed they'll be
[1:28:44] changed so he can still
[1:28:47] move but we we we got to say where's
[1:28:49] this move at it's in the transforming
[1:28:52] power that's in the seed to transform it
[1:28:56] into being what God wanted it to
[1:29:00] be it's
[1:29:03] moving it's so
[1:29:05] great and you didn't have one thing to
[1:29:08] do about it he put it in you and you
[1:29:10] can't even stop it from
[1:29:14] moving Paul didn't believe it he thought
[1:29:16] he'd persecute the whole
[1:29:19] church and all of a sudden someone said
[1:29:22] hey
[1:29:26] Why persec th
[1:29:29] me Bo you talk about
[1:29:33] transformation and he said you know what
[1:29:35] Paul you're going to know how much you
[1:29:37] got to suffer for my name's sake and he
[1:29:40] suffered when it came all down to it he
[1:29:42] said I fought a good fight I've run a
[1:29:44] good race now I have one more
[1:29:47] change I'm going to go receive the crown
[1:29:51] that's been set for
[1:29:53] me and then he goes on he
[1:29:55] says he face the condition he promised
[1:29:59] he would do it and call a little flock
[1:30:03] which would be his bride notice here
[1:30:07] again now how perfectly these Church
[1:30:09] ages typed these two Edens what was the
[1:30:13] whole church age it was the
[1:30:15] transformation of the seed to the image
[1:30:19] of Christ in the sheath wave offering
[1:30:22] the god through a seed of his word and
[1:30:27] there's only one thing that can Quicken
[1:30:30] the word and that is the
[1:30:35] spirit for it is the
[1:30:39] lifegiver to the word it's the
[1:30:42] transforming power that brings life to
[1:30:45] the word and when the life in the word
[1:30:50] meets the life of the spirit is produces
[1:30:55] whatever the seed
[1:30:59] is the that transformation is taking
[1:31:02] place it don't matter I mean how old a
[1:31:05] difference between me and you about 30

[1:33:21] really I I appreciate that
[1:33:25] but brother Bram preached so many a
[1:33:27] sermon he never got one hand clap
[1:33:32] for he spewed out life and they would be
[1:33:36] banging their Forks against the glasses
[1:33:38] and the women would be sneering and
[1:33:41] mocking and he'd have all those Bob
[1:33:43] haired women out there at those Full
[1:33:45] Gospel businessmen pouring his heart to
[1:33:48] him and they just pick on he never got
[1:33:50] an applaud one
[1:33:53] when I tell you we meet him in the
[1:33:56] air that's when the applaud is going to
[1:34:00] be you know and and I I hope that even
