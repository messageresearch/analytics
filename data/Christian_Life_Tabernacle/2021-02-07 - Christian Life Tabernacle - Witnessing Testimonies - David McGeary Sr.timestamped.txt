[21:09] how he long for
[21:12] me to understand
[21:16] that i could
[21:18] [Music]
[21:22] sew through the valley
[21:27] he led me
[21:31] afraid as i
[21:34] could be then i felt his loving arms
[21:42] embrace me
[21:44] [Music]
[21:49] how could i ever trout
[21:53] this great god whose hands hold
[22:02] how could i ever
[22:06] question his ability
[22:12] [Music]
[22:15] there's no place that
[22:18] i can go that my god
[22:23] doesn't know all the things
[22:26] that trouble me
[22:30] he's always aware
[22:36] and what i need
[22:44] i've been through enough
[22:47] to know he'll be enough for
[22:52] me

[23:01] that puts my mind
[23:10] i'll stake my very life he's gonna take
[23:16] care of me
[23:23] cause i've been through enough to know
[23:29] [Music]
[23:34] him
[23:36] i believe him now
[23:39] after all these years he's been so
[23:43] faithful his promises are
[23:47] true nevermore
[23:51] will i doubt our question
[23:54] why cause i've seen him work before
[23:59] and i know what god
[24:02] can
[24:09] i've been through enough to know he'll
[24:14] be enough for me
[24:22] he's come through too many times
[24:26] that puts my mind at ease
[24:32] [Music]
[24:36] i'll stake my very life he's gonna
[24:41] take care of me
[24:48] because i've been through enough
[24:51] to know he'll be enough
[24:54] for me

[25:07] care of me
[25:14] cause i've been through enough to know
[25:17] he'll
[25:19] be enough for me

[25:47] god bless you
[25:53] why should i feel
[25:56] [Music]
[25:59] discouraged and
[26:02] why should the shadows come
[26:10] why should my heart
[26:14] be lonely
[26:18] and long for heaven

[27:56] for his tender word i hear
[28:06] and resting on
[28:09] his goodness
[28:13] i lose my doubts
[28:17] and my fears
[28:21] though by the path
[28:25] he lead
[28:29] but one step i

[36:00] and that you've given us eternal life
[36:04] that death has no sting that we just

[36:57] give us a few words of testimony of the
[37:00] things that
[37:01] they've had on their heart and the
[37:03] things that they're going
[37:05] and how everything's kind of falling
[37:07] together and
[37:09] and uh i just think it's a wonderful
[37:12] burden that they have and so cousin if
[37:15] you could come and share that
[37:17] with us tonight and for a few moments
[37:20] and then
[37:21] we'll read a few scriptures and we'll go

[37:29] enjoyed those songs tonight and it's
[37:32] wonderful
[37:34] amen
[37:50] god bless you
[37:54] i'm a little nervous
[38:00] amen i wanted to read the scripture
[38:03] before we get started and that's going
[38:04] to be
[38:04] in romans chapter 6.
[38:16] verse 22 22 and 23 of romans chapter 6.
[38:29] and it says but now being made free from
[38:31] sin
[38:33] and became servants to god
[38:36] ye have your fruit unto holiness
[38:40] and the end everlasting life
[38:44] for the wages of sin is death but the
[38:47] gift of god
[38:48] is eternal life through jesus christ
[38:53] our lord
[38:58] as brother david said it's just it's
[39:00] been a testimony recently where
[39:03] the lord has just been doing a lot of
[39:05] work and
[39:06] in my life personally and
[39:10] you know if i was to sit here and talk
[39:11] about it it would probably take hours
[39:13] because there's just a lot of detail but
[39:16] you know just summarizing it as much as
[39:17] i can
[39:21] you know the ending of 2020 for me was
[39:25] with the desire in my heart and that was
[39:28] to be able to
[39:30] manifest more the spirit of christ in my
[39:31] life
[39:33] and you know i caught myself
[39:36] in this direction where i didn't know
[39:38] where to go now that then
[39:40] i it was just one of those things where
[39:42] i got comfortable
[39:44] i was going to work i was coming home
[39:48] i was coming to wednesday night service
[39:50] i was going home
[39:52] i was coming to church i was going home
[39:55] and it just became a routine
[39:59] so as the as the year was ending i
[40:02] really just had in my heart i said lord
[40:04] if this is
[40:05] christianity i'm this is boring
[40:08] i said i want more i i don't want to
[40:10] just go to work and come home and come
[40:12] to wednesday night and hear the word and
[40:14] go home and i said what's this i said
[40:17] this is this is boring
[40:18] i want more i want to contact
[40:23] other people and testify of this gift
[40:27] eternal life
[40:30] so you know as the year was passing it's
[40:33] not like something happened at that time
[40:34] i
[40:34] it was just a desire in my heart and as
[40:38] the time was passing
[40:39] um you know there were certain messages
[40:42] that were preached and
[40:43] you know i was listening to some some of
[40:45] the sermons from brother branham and
[40:46] they were just
[40:47] you know direct speaking to my desire my
[40:50] my heart's desire and you know
[40:53] as the time was coming i believe about
[40:55] almost a month ago
[40:58] there was one month or one night where
[41:01] the lord really dealt with me
[41:03] and you know i
[41:08] i was reading this message and i want to
[41:09] read this quote because this is
[41:11] this is where my heart start up
[41:15] and and and it's about being a witness
[41:20] and when i read this quote
[41:24] something really just manifested in my
[41:26] life that i can't explain i can't
[41:30] i could sit here and try to explain to
[41:31] you what happened but i i it's just
[41:33] supernatural so
[41:35] you know there's just no words to try to
[41:37] put it in in words
[41:39] to explain to you what happened but it's
[41:42] called it's out of
[41:43] 1958 the oneness of unity
[41:49] it says this it says here's brother
[41:51] brand i'm just describing
[41:54] you know the upper room and it's talking
[41:57] about the apostles
[41:59] and and he said he he says in here
[42:01] paragraph
[42:02] i believe i didn't write it on here but
[42:05] i believe it's 60 or something like that
[42:07] it says
[42:08] watch what he said he said it is not
[42:11] for you to know that hour
[42:15] but go up to the city of jerusalem
[42:18] and you shall be endued with power from
[42:21] on high
[42:22] before you can be a witness
[42:25] a witness has to know something
[42:29] a witness has to have an experience
[42:32] and you cannot be a witness of christ
[42:35] until the holy ghost has baptized you
[42:38] it says jesus would not permit his
[42:40] disciples to preach the gospel until
[42:43] they received the holy ghost
[42:45] yet they have been honored to walk with
[42:48] them for
[42:48] three and a half years though they were
[42:51] holy men
[42:53] accepted in his sight but he would not
[42:56] let them go preach
[42:57] until they waited up there and got
[43:01] all their differences out of them and
[43:04] then the holy spirit came
[43:07] what the world needs today is that same
[43:09] feeling
[43:10] when the dumping outcomes it needs a
[43:13] feeling
[43:15] what does that feeling do when it comes
[43:17] in
[43:18] where you have doubt it brings faith
[43:21] where you have indifference it brings
[43:23] love where you have
[43:24] hatred it brings fellowship
[43:28] and then when the church of the living
[43:31] god
[43:32] someday will be united under
[43:35] one great head and that will be the head
[43:38] of god
[43:42] into the unity of the body of christ
[43:44] will be the governor
[43:46] and the king of the lord over the entire
[43:49] church under his control
[43:52] then she will be received up
[43:56] so when i read this there was something
[43:58] in my heart that just
[43:59] said text us to brother joseph and this
[44:02] was like almost 10 o'clock at night
[44:05] i'm like well maybe he's sleeping i
[44:06] shouldn't do it so i did it anyways
[44:09] i try not to reason
[44:13] and i believe i'll kind of let him
[44:16] share the testimony on that but i i
[44:18] really believe that
[44:19] when i sent that something happened in
[44:21] their life but
[44:22] you know that night when i went to sleep
[44:24] i tried to go to sleep around 11
[44:26] i woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning
[44:29] and i couldn't go to sleep
[44:31] so now i'm thinking i'm like well lord
[44:32] do you need to talk to me
[44:34] should i get on my knees what should i
[44:36] do i was just
[44:38] i was just waiting to hear from the lord
[44:39] so i went back to the sermon and i read
[44:42] it
[44:43] and i was really interested at
[44:47] three in the morning just reading the
[44:49] service because it was really really
[44:52] touching the burden that i had on my
[44:54] heart
[44:56] so you know a couple of days later the
[45:00] testimony with
[45:01] my daughter comes with lily and
[45:05] you know i i believe i came to brother
[45:06] david and i was kind of telling them
[45:09] what happened within my heart
[45:10] and and i'm i'm just trying to
[45:13] understand this new identity i'm trying
[45:16] to understand what taking place
[45:19] i and and now there was a burden on my
[45:22] heart
[45:23] and i've never felt that before and uh
[45:27] you know i told about the david i said
[45:29] brother david i i
[45:31] i don't know what's in my heart but i
[45:32] just i just want to go and and do
[45:35] something for the poor people i want to
[45:36] go grill out and just share the gospel i
[45:39] i don't know i just feel like i need to
[45:40] reach out to them
[45:42] and um you know
[45:47] that was that was that and uh you know
[45:49] went back to just being
[45:50] and working and all of that and i
[45:52] believe a couple of weeks ago or might
[45:53] have been last week or a couple of weeks
[45:55] ago
[45:56] i was talking about the joseph and i was
[45:57] sharing my desire with him
[46:00] and you know he said i'll come with you
[46:03] and and i said okay so um
[46:07] you know we got behind the scene and we
[46:10] kind of orchestrated a day where we
[46:11] would
[46:12] work for both of us together with our
[46:14] schedule to
[46:16] just go and find a spot i mean where do
[46:19] you find homeless at you know like you
[46:21] might find one here you might find one
[46:22] here
[46:23] so what how i don't have a bus to grab
[46:25] them all and take them to one place
[46:27] so um thursday come along
[46:31] and you know me and brother joseph were
[46:34] praying
[46:34] about this opportunity and just
[46:37] listening to the word and just trying to
[46:39] find some sort of guidance
[46:41] and there was none
[46:44] i mean you just you walk by faith and
[46:46] now i understand what what it means to
[46:48] walk by faith
[46:50] so we we we uh we meet at my office on
[46:53] thursday and it was about noon
[46:56] and uh brother joe says like where we're
[46:59] going i'm like well
[47:00] i don't know um i just
[47:03] i just know of this one spa and i don't
[47:06] know
[47:07] if they're still there all i know is
[47:08] that when i used to live in forney and i
[47:10] was driving to church
[47:11] every sunday when you pass over this
[47:14] direction there was just
[47:15] camp and i don't know where it's at i
[47:18] have no idea the street
[47:20] i have no idea anything so let's just go
[47:22] to dallas
[47:23] okay so we're getting on 183 we're going
[47:26] towards dallas
[47:27] we're getting down to 35 and um
[47:32] we pulled over it's just something just
[47:34] pulled over at 35 and continental
[47:37] and we pull up at the intersection
[47:40] and all of a sudden we see two guys were
[47:44] sitting on the left side
[47:46] and then a couple of more there so you
[47:48] know we made a left
[47:49] thinking that there was the garage and
[47:51] kind of looking and nothing happened so
[47:53] we turned around and
[47:55] parked the vehicle and we just started
[47:57] walking
[47:58] so the first people that we get
[48:00] encountered with is
[48:03] brother david and brother stephen and
[48:06] they're amazing amazing characters i
[48:08] we got to spend some time with them that
[48:10] day and
[48:11] but the stephen um has an amazing
[48:15] testimony
[48:16] he's only been on the streets for about
[48:18] three years brother dave has been on the
[48:20] streets for 37 years
[48:22] and now i'm getting to know somebody
[48:26] and and this is a shock for them because
[48:28] nobody ever
[48:29] likes to find interest in them so
[48:31] they're just like get out of here or you
[48:34] know trying to give him a dollar and
[48:35] leave and this was different
[48:38] so we go and talk to him and you know uh
[48:41] steven has a cast on so me and brother
[48:45] joseph
[48:45] you know offer prayers so we end the
[48:48] street
[48:50] literally just prayed for him and laid
[48:52] our hands
[48:54] and and and as we were talking i was
[48:56] asking
[48:57] for direction i said hey i'm looking for
[49:00] this camp i don't know where it's at i
[49:02] know what's underneath the bridge
[49:04] i know there's a bunch of homeless
[49:05] people that have tents
[49:07] and i'm trying to get to them and i
[49:09] don't know where i'm going they're like
[49:10] man i'm sorry i don't know i
[49:12] well you know we're here to i don't know
[49:14] i don't know where to tell you to go
[49:16] so we had about 10 15 minute
[49:18] conversation with them just sharing the
[49:19] gospel at the same time
[49:22] and
[49:25] then we crossed the street and we meet
[49:28] jonathan it was jonathan and delilah
[49:32] and they were begging they had a sign in
[49:34] their hand and
[49:36] you know but jonathan's sick he's got a
[49:38] lung disease
[49:40] and i asked brother jonathan the same
[49:43] exact question and i said
[49:45] um do you know this place i'm looking
[49:48] for this place
[49:51] this whole this whole thing it's it's
[49:52] all about that destination so i'm asking
[49:54] strangers about where to go
[49:57] and you know he's like well you know i
[50:00] don't really know i just know that
[50:02] i just know that there if you go over
[50:04] here maybe you make a ride and you go
[50:06] all the way down there might be a train
[50:08] there and by the train there's a parking
[50:10] spot
[50:11] and i think there's some people there
[50:12] underneath the brick i don't really know
[50:14] but
[50:14] try that and and i said okay okay so
[50:17] so after that i said brother jonathan i
[50:20] wanted to kind of explain to you what's
[50:21] been on our hearts
[50:23] and and me and brother joseph just felt
[50:25] the call to come out here
[50:26] and just to explain or talk to the
[50:30] people about
[50:31] the lord jesus christ and it's on our
[50:34] hearts desire to find this place
[50:36] we just can't find it and we
[50:39] told them that you know we had a
[50:41] commission and the bible said that to go
[50:43] preach the gospel and we want to cling
[50:44] to that and preach the gospel to these
[50:46] people
[50:47] and he stops for a second
[50:52] and uh i told brother david this in the
[50:54] office but
[50:55] it's just this guy all of a sudden just
[50:58] changed
[50:59] that the best way i could i could tell
[51:01] is like moses entered his body and all
[51:03] of a sudden he just started speaking
[51:04] something
[51:05] different and uh
[51:09] he uh he said you know i used to go to
[51:11] church once
[51:13] and he started testifying and i was
[51:16] shocked i
[51:17] i didn't know what to expect and he's
[51:19] like you know i i really want to pray
[51:22] for you
[51:24] because what you're about to do
[51:27] [Music]
[51:28] is going to be a phenomenal work and i
[51:30] don't know
[51:34] it's an honor to meet you guys and i
[51:36] want to bless you i want to pray for you
[51:39] and he said he said this he said he
[51:42] started crying and he just said
[51:44] you know he said i wish i could be in
[51:47] your spot i wish i could do what you're
[51:49] doing i wish i could go with you
[51:52] and he just started tearing in his eyes
[51:53] because i love my lord jesus and i
[51:55] really want to do the same work
[51:58] and i told by the jonathan i said you
[52:00] know
[52:01] i i said just keep that keep that in
[52:03] your heart keep believing because one
[52:05] day you will
[52:07] and i'm going to find you and i'm going
[52:09] to bring you with me and we're going to
[52:10] go share the gospel together
[52:13] and so we follow his directions
[52:16] go over here i don't even remember the
[52:19] streets i honestly didn't remember
[52:20] because it said turn right on top of the
[52:21] hill and i did that's what i did
[52:23] and i went all the way down and that's
[52:24] what i did so i didn't pay attention to
[52:26] no streets so we finally get up
[52:31] and we go over the bridge and
[52:35] we kind of missed it and we come turn
[52:37] around and
[52:40] a little bit joseph kind of shared a
[52:41] testimony on the side but we find
[52:43] brother jay and you know brother jay is
[52:46] just
[52:47] an awesome guy and he all of a sudden
[52:50] he i asked him to say question and i
[52:53] said
[52:53] um hey do you know about this camp do
[52:56] you know about this tents do you know
[52:58] about it's like yeah
[53:00] it's like it's right here it's like i
[53:02] actually know the people there they're

[53:05] huh i said okay
[53:08] do you want to come in my truck and show
[53:09] us where it's at he's like yeah
[53:11] okay so we put him in the
[53:14] truck first we want he said he was
[53:17] hungry so we got him some food
[53:20] and then after that we he kind of showed
[53:22] us to the camp so
[53:24] as we're walking out um
[53:28] and this is all happening thursday as
[53:30] we're walking out
[53:33] he's like hey i want to i want to go

[53:44] meeting us and he's just like man you
[53:46] guys are awesome there's something
[53:48] different about you
[53:48] and just all excited and happy and he
[53:52] literally went before this camp
[53:54] and i believe there is about uh now that
[53:56] we've met the people probably about 12
[53:58] to 15 there
[54:00] and he goes there and he talks to him i
[54:02] don't know for about 13 15 seconds just
[54:04] real quick and
[54:04] me but joseph kept walking and kept
[54:06] walking and you know the first couple of
[54:08] people we came in contact with
[54:10] were were george and and glinda so
[54:13] we got to the destination now what i
[54:16] mean okay
[54:17] so we're talking to these people and
[54:19] we're like hey

[54:59] that quickly but
[55:01] um so now they were excited for saturday
[55:07] george actually had a cell phone it
[55:08] wasn't charged because they don't have

[55:22] for 15 people and there's like 100 you
[55:24] know
[55:24] so he's like okay so
[55:28] we leave and you know me and brother
[55:30] joseph are just kind of
[55:32] just thrilled of what the lord just did
[55:33] you know we're just like oh my goodness

[56:40] we started we started cooking and on
[56:43] friday night
[56:45] actually glinda texted us
[56:48] off of brother
[56:52] george's phone and said hey there's
[56:53] going to be about 25 people here

[56:59] about 25
[57:00] 30 people so we go and buy all the stuff
[57:03] and we go saturday and and we
[57:05] we we cook out and you know um
[57:08] a lot of people are coming and uh
[57:12] you know we we i didn't want it to sound
[57:15] like we were kind of
[57:16] using it as a bait but you know a lot of
[57:18] people when they're hungry they come to
[57:19] food so i'm like well
[57:20] if we're gonna give you natural food we
[57:21] might as well just give us a spiritual
[57:23] at the same time
[57:24] not too two birds with one stone
[57:27] that's what we were here to do so as as
[57:30] people are coming eating we're just kind
[57:32] of spending a one-on-one time and
[57:33] testifying to some of these people and
[57:35] and i'll say this
[57:36] you know there was just the love in my
[57:39] heart for these people that i got to
[57:40] meet because they really have a
[57:42] character they
[57:43] really have a story and really i mean if
[57:46] you just sit there to listen you're just
[57:47] mesmerized you're just like wow and
[57:50] you know some of them say that they have
[57:52] an experience with the lord and and they
[57:54] do some of them
[57:56] don't want to hear about the lord but
[57:58] you know a lot of a lot of what they
[57:59] were doing is just like man there's just
[58:01] something they were recognizing
[58:02] something they're like
[58:04] they're just something different about
[58:05] you guys there's just something
[58:06] different about what you guys are doing
[58:09] you know there's a lot of people here
[58:10] trying to give us food but never where
[58:12] they're doing this
[58:13] personal touch and their personal way of
[58:15] sharing the gospel this is different
[58:17] it's just you know they're just they
[58:19] were just shocked so
[58:20] you know i told a bunch of the people
[58:22] there um
[58:25] i said you know um this is not going to
[58:28] be the first time we'll be here
[58:30] uh we're probably going to be here quite
[58:32] a bit um
[58:33] so i want to get to know you i want you
[58:36] to get to know me
[58:37] as individuals but the main important
[58:39] thing is i want to share the gospel with
[58:41] you and i want the same life
[58:43] and the same message that changed my
[58:45] life i want to share the same gospel
[58:48] with you because i know what
[58:50] it took me out of and i know we could
[58:52] take you out of that too
[58:54] and they were just happy they were just
[58:56] you know
[58:57] i've met homeless in the past or i
[58:59] didn't you know they're just kind of
[59:03] you know some of them could be grouchy
[59:04] some of them could just be you know
[59:06] stress of life or but i'm telling you
[59:08] the people that we've met they're just
[59:10] absolutely amazing they're just so warm
[59:13] so welcoming
[59:14] and and and they want to hear the gospel
[59:18] and by having that heart of receiving
[59:21] the gospel i
[59:22] really believe that the lord's going to
[59:23] do something and you know i don't know
[59:26] if you guys noticed but this morning we
[59:28] brought
[59:28] brother trevor with us in our church
[59:30] well he was part of that testimony
[59:32] and and he came and just sat down in
[59:35] eight
[59:36] and uh he was kind of telling us his
[59:37] life story
[59:39] and uh you know we offered i said hey do
[59:41] you want to come to church with us
[59:42] tomorrow he's like
[59:43] yeah man i'm like okay um
[59:47] at first we were gonna try to pick him
[59:48] up in the morning and all of a sudden
[59:50] you know the lord transpired where we're
[59:51] like we're just gonna bring him with us
[59:53] we'll put him over here into a room and
[59:55] in the morning he'll just come to church
[59:56] so you know he came to church and he was
[59:59] really
[1:00:00] excited that the lord was able to speak
[1:00:02] to him and and he was able to
[1:00:04] to be fed and uh you know
[1:00:08] just like i read in romans 6 it's
[1:00:11] it's a gift this gift is eternal life
[1:00:13] and and i want to share this gift
[1:00:15] because if he was
[1:00:16] if it changed my life and he gave me
[1:00:18] this how much more can he give it to his
[1:00:19] lost children that are still out there
[1:00:21] and and you know it's just it's just a
[1:00:23] testimony for me because
[1:00:25] you know i i never asked for this you
[1:00:28] know i i it was just something that the
[1:00:29] lord
[1:00:30] just provided and um you know
[1:00:33] i don't know where this work is gonna
[1:00:35] where it's gonna go what it's gonna do
[1:00:36] but just keep us in your prayer
[1:00:38] um we want the lord to bring people like
[1:00:41] that into our church and be
[1:00:42] fed you know and just be a testament be
[1:00:45] a light
[1:00:45] just be able to uh to share that gospel
[1:00:48] because
[1:00:49] what else are we going to talk about you
[1:00:51] know
[1:00:52] i don't want to talk about science i
[1:00:54] don't want to talk about math i don't
[1:00:55] want to talk about anything else with
[1:00:57] anybody else but i want to talk about
[1:00:58] the lord
[1:00:59] and if there's a seed there it'll
[1:01:01] receive
[1:01:02] and i know you know all we could do is
[1:01:04] just trust in the lord
[1:01:06] but yeah it's it's it's amazing
[1:01:10] and we're really looking forward to what
[1:01:11] the lord's doing so i'm gonna invite
[1:01:13] brother joseph he's gonna
[1:01:14] tie up some ants for me and share part
[1:01:16] of his testimony because
[1:01:18] you know it um it's been on both of our
[1:01:22] hearts to do this and i'm just thankful
[1:01:24] that
[1:01:25] that god's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:27] forever i'll tell you it's a privilege
[1:01:29] for me to just be
[1:01:30] able to do that and you know
[1:01:34] i'll say this you know not that but when
[1:01:37] you go there
[1:01:38] and and and you see the way these people
[1:01:40] live
[1:01:41] and you see the way these people have
[1:01:44] their life
[1:01:44] i'm just so great for that that
[1:01:47] god gave me and i have what i have and
[1:01:51] the fact that we were able to sit down
[1:01:53] and eat with them and share the gospel
[1:01:55] and
[1:01:55] and give them a hug and shake their hand
[1:01:57] and not worry about
[1:01:59] what they smelled like or what they
[1:02:00] looked like to who they were and who
[1:02:02] they weren't
[1:02:03] you know that showed that love and and
[1:02:05] that's what they recognized and they
[1:02:07] said there's something different about
[1:02:08] you guys because nobody does that
[1:02:10] everybody comes and drops off the food
[1:02:12] and they leave
[1:02:13] because that's all they're worried about
[1:02:15] is performing that good deed
[1:02:17] but there's just something different
[1:02:18] about you and there's just something
[1:02:19] different about
[1:02:20] what you guys are telling us i don't
[1:02:22] know what it is and i want i want to
[1:02:24] know more
[1:02:25] so they already know we're coming next
[1:02:27] saturday we're going next saturday
[1:02:29] and we're just going to keep going and
[1:02:31] you know
[1:02:32] i just i i just want to say this if you
[1:02:35] guys see one of them as they're coming
[1:02:36] to church we're supposed to bring
[1:02:37] brother jonathan the church is coming up
[1:02:39] wednesday he said he wants to come to
[1:02:40] church
[1:02:41] just shake their hand and just just just
[1:02:43] share that love
[1:02:45] because you know this is just something
[1:02:48] that we were able to do
[1:02:50] and i want him to feel the same exact
[1:02:52] love from from the people here because
[1:02:54] we're the same
[1:02:55] we're the same we obtain the same exact
[1:02:56] spirit and that's the spirit of the lord
[1:02:58] jesus christ in us
[1:02:59] god bless you
[1:03:01] [Applause]
[1:03:11] god bless you i definitely agree with
[1:03:13] that sentiment of feeling a little
[1:03:15] nervous looking upon so many faces but
[1:03:18] here we go
[1:03:19] so where to get started i would like to
[1:03:20] start with john 10 16
[1:03:23] and it says and other sheep i have which
[1:03:26] are not of this fold
[1:03:29] them also i must bring and they shall
[1:03:31] hear my voice
[1:03:32] and there shall be one fold and one
[1:03:34] shepherd
[1:03:36] then in luke 14
[1:03:39] verse 23 and the lord said unto the
[1:03:42] servant
[1:03:43] go out into the highways and hedges and
[1:03:45] compel them to come in
[1:03:47] that my house may be filled so
[1:03:50] when this work commenced uh these were
[1:03:52] two scriptures i actually uh told
[1:03:53] brother cosman i said uh john 10 16
[1:03:56] of the lord speaking of of their
[1:03:59] of there being other sheep not in the
[1:04:01] fold and that they must come in there be
[1:04:03] a one fold i said this this kind of
[1:04:04] feels like a theme
[1:04:06] thing with the work of going finding
[1:04:08] those sheep bringing them in
[1:04:10] and then also another theme too that
[1:04:12] brought in is that you know uh
[1:04:14] of going into the highways and hedges
[1:04:16] because in a sense
[1:04:17] that was literally what we're doing is
[1:04:19] literally going into the highways
[1:04:21] compelling them and if you look into
[1:04:22] compel there that means
[1:04:24] you know you're with an earnest state of
[1:04:25] mind you you're you're persuading them
[1:04:28] right trying to compel them to persuade
[1:04:29] them coming you know come to
[1:04:31] come to the lord come to the gospel come
[1:04:33] come to this uh
[1:04:34] come eat what i have to offer of you but
[1:04:37] before i get into a little bit of
[1:04:39] the details of what the lord did i have
[1:04:41] to back up a little bit
[1:04:42] of of what happened to me
[1:04:45] because as similar to a brother cosmic
[1:04:47] of the lord jesus coming
[1:04:48] and making a change in his life i too
[1:04:51] actually had a similar change
[1:04:52] and it was in 2020 end of uh november to
[1:04:55] be exact
[1:04:56] so we here i have brother david for the
[1:04:58] spirit of the lord laying in all these
[1:05:00] uh messages of
[1:05:01] the central theme being about the
[1:05:03] father's business and that really has
[1:05:05] had a profound effect on me to where
[1:05:07] even even
[1:05:08] even before this change even took uh it
[1:05:11] was even taking message books and
[1:05:12] putting them you know a few places here
[1:05:14] and here just just trying to
[1:05:15] satisfy that burden of to be about the
[1:05:18] father's business
[1:05:19] well that that worked a little bit but
[1:05:21] you know it doesn't quite hit the spot
[1:05:22] you know that that's good
[1:05:24] but that's not all that there is to do
[1:05:28] so it finally wound up towards uh the
[1:05:30] end of 2020
[1:05:32] i remember uh spiritually feeling um the
[1:05:34] only way i can describe it as a
[1:05:36] spiritually sick
[1:05:37] i'm not feeling too well so asking the
[1:05:39] lord just i just spiritually i don't
[1:05:41] feel too good
[1:05:42] like i i need to get better like please
[1:05:45] make me whole
[1:05:46] so i remember a list of sermons that
[1:05:48] came to mind i think actually
[1:05:50] uh um i figured exact sources but i
[1:05:52] remember one in particular
[1:05:53] it was actually a sermon brother david
[1:05:55] was speaking of and he made i think a
[1:05:56] quotation of taking sides with jesus
[1:05:59] and he said he recommended and said um
[1:06:02] i recommend you go read it so you know
[1:06:04] what i took up the recommendation
[1:06:05] i finished reading the book that i was
[1:06:07] reading
[1:06:08] and uh then i popped on down and started
[1:06:11] reading that one
[1:06:11] it was a wonderful book cleared me up on
[1:06:14] a few things and somehow from that book
[1:06:16] i ended up on the messaging from that
[1:06:18] time i won't go into the exact details
[1:06:20] of what
[1:06:21] moved me in that but there was a call of
[1:06:24] god to my life
[1:06:25] from that message i was actually sitting
[1:06:28] my dining room
[1:06:29] at the head of my table where i normally
[1:06:31] normally sit almost
[1:06:32] all the time when i sit at that table
[1:06:34] and there was a call god made out
[1:06:37] to to to to the cold and different
[1:06:39] church member
[1:06:41] and i felt compelled to respond to that
[1:06:43] and i did i stood up on my feet and i
[1:06:45] responded to that
[1:06:46] i won't go into what he said afterwards
[1:06:48] but there was two words he a
[1:06:49] sentence he said after to me and it was
[1:06:52] so profound to me
[1:06:53] that it went from being just hearing the
[1:06:56] words on a tape
[1:06:57] but it was almost as literally those
[1:06:59] words were
[1:07:01] being spoken directly to me the best way
[1:07:03] i can i can
[1:07:04] say it is it's not it's not hearing it
[1:07:07] and being identified with it
[1:07:09] it's literally wow
[1:07:13] that that is that that that that is that
[1:07:15] is me who is talking about
[1:07:17] and when he said the last thing there
[1:07:18] was such a profound change that came
[1:07:20] over me
[1:07:21] um indifference went out
[1:07:25] lack of caring for people went out my
[1:07:28] whole motive and desire
[1:07:29] life changed how i conducted my life
[1:07:32] change
[1:07:33] i didn't ask for it the call that god
[1:07:36] put in
[1:07:36] i don't ever actually remember asking
[1:07:38] specifically what was said for me i was
[1:07:40] thinking of something else
[1:07:42] but the lord came in and and chose me
[1:07:44] and put me into his service to do his
[1:07:46] work
[1:07:47] and and and and i just inspect the fruit
[1:07:50] of that it could be like oh you just got
[1:07:52] excited but no
[1:07:53] it's just the fruit of that i noticed
[1:07:54] what happened in my life
[1:07:56] i used to i just in my mind you know i
[1:07:59] would feel uh
[1:08:01] sympathize with people and say sure you
[1:08:03] know we should be you know
[1:08:04] preaching the gospel giving the gospel
[1:08:06] to people and whatnot but now
[1:08:09] it goes from being in the mind to now
[1:08:11] being in the heart
[1:08:12] to where now from speaking from the mind
[1:08:14] is now speak from inside
[1:08:16] what was once done maybe mentally
[1:08:19] through what you think is right and now
[1:08:20] it's done by nature
[1:08:22] so it was such a profound change i
[1:08:24] noticed in my life i i probably went uh
[1:08:26] two or three weeks without telling
[1:08:27] anyone
[1:08:28] i'm just what do i do with this like i'm
[1:08:31] i'm changed i'm different
[1:08:33] uh and those are changes in my life you
[1:08:35] know an increased consecration
[1:08:37] a relationship between the bible and the
[1:08:39] message changed it was
[1:08:41] always an interest there but now it has
[1:08:43] gone gone to another level
[1:08:45] and now there's a few things that
[1:08:46] happened
[1:08:48] between now and with the work that
[1:08:51] the lord started with me and brother
[1:08:52] cosman but i'll just skip over those
[1:08:58] and leading up
[1:09:01] to what the lord has started the work
[1:09:05] with these with these
[1:09:06] uh homeless people i think about a week
[1:09:08] or two before
[1:09:09] i was i was in prayer and one of the
[1:09:10] things i prayed actually i don't
[1:09:12] remember the time frame there
[1:09:14] but sometime before brother cosman
[1:09:16] reached out to me i'd actually prayed is
[1:09:18] that lord i i want to
[1:09:20] i want to come in contact with more
[1:09:22] people
[1:09:23] because in my day-to-day life with what
[1:09:25] i do for a living
[1:09:26] you know to earn money to pay the bills
[1:09:28] and take care of things
[1:09:30] i'm at home i work at home especially
[1:09:32] with coronavirus just 100
[1:09:34] home i don't contact a lot of people in
[1:09:36] that
[1:09:37] in living life like that so a cry of my
[1:09:39] heart was that lord i want to make
[1:09:40] contact with more people
[1:09:42] because how can you share the gospel
[1:09:43] with someone you know unless you
[1:09:45] see their face right you actually have
[1:09:48] to see them you have to talk to them you
[1:09:49] have to express
[1:09:50] interest in them you have to wait you
[1:09:52] know for the lord to open the door and
[1:09:54] you actually speak to them
[1:09:55] it's kind of hard to do unless you
[1:09:57] actually go and be there in front of
[1:09:58] people
[1:10:00] so that was the prayer lord i want to
[1:10:02] make contact with more people
[1:10:03] and i left it at that now there also was
[1:10:06] another desire and cry in my heart of
[1:10:08] the lord i i i
[1:10:09] want to win souls for your kingdom
[1:10:11] because as part of that transformation
[1:10:13] was the feeling or thought inside of me
[1:10:16] is that
[1:10:17] you know i've worked for my kingdom long
[1:10:19] enough my personal kingdom joseph
[1:10:20] gordon this flesh man right here it's
[1:10:22] time
[1:10:24] it's uh it's time to work for his so
[1:10:26] that was part of that transformation was
[1:10:27] that
[1:10:28] realization right there and actually
[1:10:30] part of that realization
[1:10:31] is that ambitions in life changed it
[1:10:34] went from being career oriented
[1:10:36] to actually now wanting to go
[1:10:40] save the lost to go bring the message to
[1:10:42] them to go look after their souls and
[1:10:45] bring them in and do and do all that
[1:10:47] could be done for them
[1:10:49] so there's that prayers that lord i want
[1:10:51] to make contact with more people
[1:10:53] so on the day that uh brother carson
[1:10:56] caused
[1:10:57] called me it was the sunday it was the
[1:10:59] saturday right before lily's baptism
[1:11:02] and the the contact right there was
[1:11:06] actually supernatural in and of itself
[1:11:09] because normally what i do with my cell
[1:11:11] phone since
[1:11:12] uh what i do day to day for a living i i
[1:11:15] don't need to be on the phone
[1:11:16] it's mainly there for my convenience i
[1:11:17] normally have
[1:11:19] uh all the ringers turned off everything
[1:11:21] off is just it's just silent
[1:11:22] like like if it's important i'll leave a
[1:11:24] voicemail and i'll get back to it
[1:11:26] otherwise it's not important
[1:11:27] that's normally how i've treated my
[1:11:29] phone so
[1:11:30] i was getting my coffee maker ready and
[1:11:32] my phone
[1:11:34] was sitting right next to my coffee
[1:11:35] maker and i'm getting it ready and
[1:11:37] saturday night then i
[1:11:38] see brother costume no i'm
[1:11:41] i'm glad i'm right here you know
[1:11:43] otherwise i would have missed it
[1:11:45] so i picked it up and said hello and
[1:11:46] started talking to him
[1:11:48] he tells me the just the the wonderful
[1:11:51] testimony of
[1:11:52] about lilly's uh her wanting to be
[1:11:55] baptized
[1:11:56] but it doesn't stop there then we stay
[1:11:59] on the phone
[1:12:00] he continues talking and he he talks
[1:12:02] about
[1:12:04] uh brother joseph you know the lord's
[1:12:06] put a desire in my heart to uh to go
[1:12:08] uh to go like a feed the like like the
[1:12:10] homeless or go do something for them
[1:12:13] that really struck me it quick into my
[1:12:16] mind it came to my mind real quick what
[1:12:18] i prayed
[1:12:18] lord i want to be in contact with more
[1:12:20] people and without hesitation i'm like
[1:12:23] i'm going with you why it came to me
[1:12:27] that was the door a door open i had
[1:12:29] prayed
[1:12:30] the door open that was the answer right
[1:12:32] there
[1:12:35] all right so we really really we put a
[1:12:38] very minimal amount of pre-planning in
[1:12:40] it
[1:12:40] why because we don't want to be light of
[1:12:43] our own minds
[1:12:44] so we end up i end up telling we say you
[1:12:46] know what i'll take off thursday will
[1:12:48] thursday work for you
[1:12:49] thursday worked for him and we left
[1:12:50] thursday
[1:12:52] thursday afternoon and we headed over we
[1:12:56] headed over there to dallas
[1:13:00] don't want to reiterate too many and
[1:13:02] sake of time we reiterate too many of
[1:13:03] the things uh things that he said but
[1:13:05] yeah you know the first people who
[1:13:06] we met was uh dave and and and stephen
[1:13:10] not really nice friendly guys we go over
[1:13:11] jonathan it was it was a it was really
[1:13:14] really wonderful talk talking to him we
[1:13:16] get off to the right place
[1:13:18] and actually the road that is is
[1:13:20] actually i think houston avenue
[1:13:22] if anybody familiar with it this place
[1:13:24] is is this bridge i think it's houston
[1:13:25] avenue
[1:13:26] under the head of the bridges let's go
[1:13:28] into the trinity river
[1:13:30] and uh we missed the parking lot it's a
[1:13:32] really big public parking lot right
[1:13:34] there i think it's for
[1:13:35] people to go see there's a few museums
[1:13:37] up up there there's a little
[1:13:39] train station there so we miss the turn
[1:13:42] for the parking lot and we go up and we
[1:13:44] have to turn around and as we're coming
[1:13:46] back into downtown right there
[1:13:49] uh broadcasting is like oh we gotta we
[1:13:50] gotta turn i said well we can't
[1:13:52] can't hear that's that's a one way um
[1:13:54] yeah yeah one way this way so you gotta
[1:13:56] go up there you need to get in that lane
[1:13:58] and actually as he's going some reason
[1:14:01] i'm moving my hand i
[1:14:03] sometimes move my hands a lot when i
[1:14:04] talk and i was moving my hand
[1:14:06] and i saw this guy walking down the
[1:14:08] street this way and ultimately he waves
[1:14:11] i was thinking he saw me in the vehicle
[1:14:13] and he thought i was waving at him
[1:14:15] and then i'll suddenly just i just said
[1:14:17] pastor we got to stop and talk to him
[1:14:19] we gotta stop we gotta we gotta talk to
[1:14:21] him and i actually i think i
[1:14:22] actually gesturing we gotta talk to him
[1:14:24] so he quickly pulls up
[1:14:26] backs up and this guy is already there
[1:14:28] and we're rolling down the window
[1:14:29] of course um this man jay his name is
[1:14:32] jay he's not actually homeless he has a
[1:14:34] little trailer he lives in but
[1:14:35] he has been homeless and the lifestyle
[1:14:37] he lives is one of the homeless person
[1:14:40] but so he sees this so he of course
[1:14:43] quickly picks up like oh
[1:14:44] wow they're going to give me something
[1:14:46] and we did
[1:14:47] probably more than what he actually uh
[1:14:49] thought he was going to get too
[1:14:52] so we actually get up and uh
[1:14:55] we make contact with them actually we
[1:14:57] actually have little care bags
[1:14:59] um they have a few things they need and
[1:15:00] a message book inside we actually hand
[1:15:02] one to him i said oh man that's great
[1:15:04] thank you
[1:15:04] really appreciate it but of course we
[1:15:06] don't stop there we actually get out and
[1:15:08] we're making contact with this fellow
[1:15:11] i think we asked him about the lord he
[1:15:12] said he's a christian and
[1:15:14] he said but you know you know i have a
[1:15:16] problem with cussing
[1:15:18] and you know we prayed for him i asked
[1:15:21] him can i put my arm around you i did
[1:15:23] because you know what in doing this work
[1:15:25] yeah no
[1:15:26] they they don't smell the best they're
[1:15:28] they're they're they're they're there
[1:15:30] there is there is that barrier there to
[1:15:31] where
[1:15:32] you could let that be an impediment your
[1:15:34] contact with him but i tell you what
[1:15:36] when you have the love of god in your
[1:15:37] heart you view them as your
[1:15:39] as an equal human being because the
[1:15:41] blood of the lord jesus christ
[1:15:42] was shed for all of us right as human
[1:15:45] beings were equal
[1:15:46] so just with that love in my heart
[1:15:48] there's no apprehension in making that
[1:15:50] kind of contact with them
[1:15:51] so put the arm around his shoulder
[1:15:53] prayed for him the lord would just
[1:15:54] deliver himself
[1:15:56] take that out of his life then brother
[1:15:58] cosman asked him
[1:16:00] do you know do you know where this place
[1:16:03] is
[1:16:04] and he says he does and the next thing
[1:16:06] that's done really blows the man away
[1:16:08] because brother carson opens the door
[1:16:09] says get in we're going to take you to
[1:16:12] where you live and eventually take him
[1:16:13] to
[1:16:14] uh to get him some food and whatnot and
[1:16:15] just really just just just you know we
[1:16:17] already
[1:16:18] made gave him something we got out and
[1:16:20] actually
[1:16:21] hugged him prayed for him we're
[1:16:23] interacting with him
[1:16:25] and now we ask him to get in the vehicle
[1:16:27] it's just it just blows this man's
[1:16:29] uh mind away that we're just like oh
[1:16:31] just one and done and gone
[1:16:33] so he actually takes us to the camp and
[1:16:35] and uh he makes makes the introduction
[1:16:37] for us
[1:16:39] so brother cosby told you a lot of
[1:16:40] details right there but uh
[1:16:42] one special thing that really really
[1:16:44] stuck out to me there
[1:16:45] was that the lord moved on a lady's
[1:16:47] behalf glinda
[1:16:48] now the thing that's really remarkable
[1:16:52] to me about that
[1:16:54] is that glenda that's actually the name
[1:16:55] of my mom
[1:16:57] i didn't know that when i actually when
[1:16:59] this thing about to tell you happened i
[1:17:00] didn't know it at the time
[1:17:02] but actually as we're standing there
[1:17:03] talking i think wrapping up
[1:17:05] uh making an introduction to them and
[1:17:06] we're about to leave
[1:17:09] i just i just felt a pull in my heart to
[1:17:11] pray for him
[1:17:12] i just did you know it's just one of
[1:17:14] those things you can't explain you just
[1:17:16] just feel like i need to pray for this
[1:17:19] person
[1:17:20] i did i took her by the hand and and you
[1:17:22] really felt the spirit of the lord there
[1:17:24] just coming to minister to something in
[1:17:26] in her heart
[1:17:28] and before we get started praying i
[1:17:30] asked her name she says glinda
[1:17:32] and that really really helped me to
[1:17:34] really just
[1:17:35] enter in and the lord really really just
[1:17:38] move it and touch her again i don't know
[1:17:40] what it was but it just
[1:17:41] the results afterwards you just felt
[1:17:43] that the lord touched something very
[1:17:44] specific in her heart
[1:17:47] so that contact was established and then
[1:17:49] we left
[1:17:51] we come back on saturday they're all
[1:17:53] excited to see us
[1:17:57] the lord really really really really
[1:17:59] moved before us and
[1:18:00] really did tremendous things with these
[1:18:02] people um we actually went through to
[1:18:04] try to pick up jonathan but he actually
[1:18:06] uh he actually was sleeping and the lady
[1:18:09] who is his wife
[1:18:10] she said no we'll take a rain check
[1:18:11] today uh we'll we'll just we'll just
[1:18:13] skip it so
[1:18:14] you know we didn't know him well enough
[1:18:16] to feel comfortable of waking waking him
[1:18:18] up
[1:18:18] because where it where it is is that you
[1:18:20] have some homeless over here this is
[1:18:22] their sidewalk then jonathan delilah
[1:18:23] they have their sidewalk over here where
[1:18:25] they're staying so at the time we didn't
[1:18:26] feel comfortable enough
[1:18:27] while waking up so we we went and left
[1:18:30] so we went to the camp we set up fed the
[1:18:33] people
[1:18:34] talked to the people and then actually
[1:18:36] the lord really
[1:18:37] moved on the behalf of glendale's
[1:18:38] husband uh george
[1:18:40] uh he has something wrong with his eyes
[1:18:43] and
[1:18:43] and just standing there talking with him
[1:18:46] just being friendly
[1:18:47] then finally a door opens up and then
[1:18:50] the lord moves in
[1:18:52] and and and and and and the lord just
[1:18:54] speaks and just tells him
[1:18:56] you know george you know he can see
[1:18:58] right now but the the fear is that he's
[1:19:00] going to go blind i told him
[1:19:02] you don't have to be you that doesn't
[1:19:04] have to be the end
[1:19:05] you don't have to be blind you know do
[1:19:08] you know the lord
[1:19:09] jesus that there's a gift of healing
[1:19:12] he looked at me strange not stranger
[1:19:13] like oh that's weird but like
[1:19:15] really that really that that really
[1:19:18] really got me i
[1:19:19] said has anyone ever told you this
[1:19:21] before and it really struck you really
[1:19:23] stuck in that man's heart while what was
[1:19:25] spoken to him so the lord provided that
[1:19:27] entry there
[1:19:29] to be able to pray pray for him and ask
[1:19:32] the lord to
[1:19:33] to provide healing for his eyes so that
[1:19:35] was that was really special right there
[1:19:38] and you know it was just a beautiful
[1:19:41] thing and how
[1:19:42] all the brothers worked together and how
[1:19:44] we individually were
[1:19:45] speaking to each one of them and the
[1:19:46] lord just ministering to the needs of
[1:19:48] these people's lives
[1:19:49] you know some of them you know the doors
[1:19:51] were completely shut like
[1:19:52] you know there's there's just no
[1:19:53] entrance right there to speak of them
[1:19:55] the lord brought other ones
[1:19:56] you know the doors wide open like oh yes
[1:19:58] i want to hear other ones you know you'd
[1:20:00] have to warm up
[1:20:01] warm them up a little bit talk to them
[1:20:03] and uh winding up here uh the young man
[1:20:05] trevor who came with us he was actually
[1:20:07] he's actually there pretty early uh one
[1:20:09] of
[1:20:10] one of the first ones he came there
[1:20:13] pretty soon actually after he started
[1:20:14] because you know his food right
[1:20:16] that news kind of travels kind of fast
[1:20:17] food go down to that
[1:20:19] place under the bridge they're feeding
[1:20:21] people down there
[1:20:22] but here's actually one thing you know
[1:20:24] people like free food
[1:20:26] and especially if you can't afford it
[1:20:28] but interestingly we we did not run out
[1:20:30] of food in fact we had enough food we
[1:20:31] actually had to give it away
[1:20:33] right we bought actually we actually
[1:20:35] bought too much
[1:20:37] so actually trevor comes comes down and
[1:20:39] the interesting thing there is that you
[1:20:41] felt
[1:20:42] almost an instant connection with him
[1:20:44] you know kind of like
[1:20:45] door open door closed it almost like he
[1:20:47] came and the door was
[1:20:49] well oiled hinges just just just waiting
[1:20:52] just
[1:20:53] almost a little breath and just swinging
[1:20:54] the doors right open
[1:20:56] and and and and just really speaking to
[1:20:59] him
[1:20:59] i told him brother trevor you know what
[1:21:02] the reason why we are here
[1:21:04] is that there is someone hungering for
[1:21:05] the lord we don't know who it
[1:21:07] is but all but the lord does not waste
[1:21:10] his time
[1:21:11] you know he doesn't waste his money he
[1:21:13] doesn't waste his time he doesn't do his
[1:21:15] business sloppy
[1:21:16] the reason why we're over here because
[1:21:18] there is at least one
[1:21:19] and brother cosmo and i were actually
[1:21:21] fellowshipping on this before we even
[1:21:22] got there
[1:21:23] he said there's at least one person here
[1:21:25] we don't know who it is
[1:21:27] trevor it might be you it might be you
[1:21:29] that
[1:21:30] that's the reason why this is done and
[1:21:32] we just really just
[1:21:34] just what were we doing we're doing that
[1:21:36] compelling
[1:21:37] doing that persuading come come come we
[1:21:40] got something for you come with us
[1:21:42] and of course the lord just wonderfully
[1:21:43] worked it out for him
[1:21:45] to come with us and and make it to this
[1:21:47] service
[1:21:49] and just the final comment here is uh is
[1:21:52] i'm just blown away with what's happened
[1:21:55] uh just like brother cosby he said
[1:21:57] you know i never asked for this i never
[1:21:58] asked to do this i am right there with
[1:22:01] them
[1:22:01] with the work that the lord is doing
[1:22:03] it's never anything that i recall asking
[1:22:05] for in my life
[1:22:06] the lord choosing putting a person on
[1:22:09] the path to do his work
[1:22:11] and i'm just so happy that i i'm able to
[1:22:13] share in this burden with my brother
[1:22:15] cosmic to go out
[1:22:16] to preach to these people to pull them
[1:22:18] in to do everything we can
[1:22:20] to bring eternal life to them bring this
[1:22:22] message to them
[1:22:23] to to to to get them well grounded in
[1:22:25] the word if they are believers if
[1:22:26] they're sinners
[1:22:27] bring get them to eternal life if
[1:22:29] they're sick you know pray for them put
[1:22:31] our arms around hug them tell them that
[1:22:32] we love them it's the lord jesus christ
[1:22:34] that loves them
[1:22:36] and i i'm just i'm just so happy to be a
[1:22:39] part of that and especially
[1:22:41] not just for myself but i'm so happy to
[1:22:43] be about the father's business and to be
[1:22:45] able to share in this business
[1:22:46] with my with my brothers and sisters in
[1:22:48] christ god bless you
[1:22:58] amen isn't that inspirational and and
[1:23:03] wonderful i'd just like to read a couple
[1:23:05] scriptures
[1:23:06] before we get into our communion of foot
[1:23:10] washing
[1:23:11] to kind of fortify
[1:23:16] and stand behind what the brothers have
[1:23:18] just said
[1:23:20] in romans 8
[1:23:23] he says there is therefore now no
[1:23:26] condemnation to them which are in christ
[1:23:28] jesus
[1:23:29] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:23:32] the spirit
[1:23:34] so you've got to have a spiritual mind
[1:23:38] you understand the carnal mind finds
[1:23:40] every reason but we'll just keep reading
[1:23:43] and it said uh for the law of the spirit
[1:23:46] of life
[1:23:48] in christ jesus had made me free
[1:23:51] from the law of sin and death
[1:23:54] for what the law could not do in that it
[1:23:58] is weak
[1:23:58] through the fresh flesh god sending his
[1:24:02] own son
[1:24:04] in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:24:08] and for sin condemned sin
[1:24:12] in the flesh that in righteousness of
[1:24:15] the
[1:24:16] law might be fulfilled in us who walk
[1:24:19] not after the flesh
[1:24:21] but after the spirit for they
[1:24:24] that are after the flesh do mind
[1:24:27] the things of the flesh but they that
[1:24:30] are after the spirit the things of the
[1:24:34] spirit
[1:24:35] for to be carnal minded
[1:24:40] is death but to be spiritual minded
[1:24:43] is life and peace
[1:24:47] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:24:49] against god
[1:24:51] for that it is not subject to the law of
[1:24:54] god
[1:24:56] neither indeed can be
[1:24:59] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:25:02] cannot please god but ye
[1:25:05] are not in the flesh but in the spirit
[1:25:10] and if so that the spirit of god
[1:25:13] dwelleth in you
[1:25:14] if any man have not the spirit of christ
[1:25:18] he is none of his
[1:25:20] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[1:25:23] because of sin but the spirit is
[1:25:26] life because of righteousness but if the
[1:25:30] spirit of him that raised up christ
[1:25:33] from the dead dwelling you he hath
[1:25:36] raised up christ from the dead shall
[1:25:38] also quicken
[1:25:39] your mortal bodies by his spirit
[1:25:43] that dwelleth in you amen to see
[1:25:47] young men and to see
[1:25:50] the spirit of god come
[1:25:54] in and
[1:25:57] move and to see that they have a calling
[1:26:01] in their life
[1:26:03] and then to to follow that calling
[1:26:06] despite any carnal-minded obstacles
[1:26:10] that might be up there and and
[1:26:14] and uh it just thrills my heart
[1:26:19] and then if i would turn over if you
[1:26:20] would turn over with me
[1:26:22] and do corinthians the first corinthians
[1:26:26] the first
[1:26:26] chapter and the 17th
[1:26:29] verse
[1:26:34] and paul's speaking and he says
[1:26:38] for christ sent me not to baptize but to
[1:26:42] preach the gospel
[1:26:44] not with the wisdom of words lest the
[1:26:47] cross of jesus christ should be made of
[1:26:49] none effect
[1:26:52] for the preaching of the cross
[1:26:55] is to them that perish foolishness
[1:26:58] but unto us which are saved it is the
[1:27:01] power of
[1:27:02] god for it is written
[1:27:05] i will destroy the wisdom of the wise
[1:27:08] and bring to nought the understanding of
[1:27:12] the prudent
[1:27:13] where is the wise and where is the
[1:27:16] scribe where is the disputer of this
[1:27:20] world
[1:27:21] hath not god made foolishness the wisdom
[1:27:24] of this world
[1:27:26] and after that in the wisdom of god
[1:27:30] the world by wisdom knew not god
[1:27:33] it pleased god by the foolishness of
[1:27:36] preaching
[1:27:37] to save them that believe
[1:27:42] for the jew requires a sign
[1:27:45] and the greeks seek after wisdom
[1:27:49] but we preach christ crucified unto the
[1:27:52] jewish stumbling block
[1:27:54] and unto the greek foolishness
[1:27:57] but unto them which are called
[1:28:01] both jewish jew and greek
[1:28:04] christ is the power of god
[1:28:07] in the wisdom of god because the
[1:28:10] foolishness of god is wiser than men
[1:28:14] and the weakness of god is stronger than
[1:28:17] men
[1:28:18] for ye see your calling brethren
[1:28:23] how that not many wise men
[1:28:26] after the flesh not many
[1:28:29] mighty not many noble
[1:28:32] are called but god hath chosen the
[1:28:36] foolish things of this world to confound
[1:28:38] the wise
[1:28:40] and god hath chosen the weak things of
[1:28:43] the world to
[1:28:44] confound the things which are mighty
[1:28:47] and the base things of the world and the
[1:28:50] things which are despised
[1:28:53] hath god chosen ye the things which are
[1:28:56] not
[1:28:57] to bring to not the things that are
[1:29:01] that no flesh is glory in his presence
[1:29:04] but of him are ye in christ
[1:29:08] jesus and of god is made unto
[1:29:12] us wisdom and righteousness
[1:29:15] and sanctification and redemption
[1:29:19] that according to is it written he that
[1:29:22] glorious
[1:29:23] let them glory in the lord
[1:29:26] and i i just think it's wonderful
[1:29:30] and and i i just think it's the lord
[1:29:35] showing that he moves on a couple men's
[1:29:37] hearts and
[1:29:38] and brother jackson felt compelled to go
[1:29:41] and
[1:29:42] and brother orlando and
[1:29:46] and just to see the burden and
[1:29:49] to see the transformation that is taking
[1:29:52] so
[1:29:53] if i could say it you know
[1:29:58] god's got something for you to do
[1:30:01] and i i think it's wonderful when you
[1:30:04] see
[1:30:05] young men they begin to seek a calling
[1:30:08] and this calling
[1:30:09] presents a burden and they go out
[1:30:12] without anything but the love of god in
[1:30:16] their heart
[1:30:19] you know they're not they're not ashamed
[1:30:22] of
[1:30:22] who they're talking to they're in the
[1:30:25] highways and the byways
[1:30:27] and they're sharing the gospel and
[1:30:30] we've got so carnal minded and so church
[1:30:33] religion we think everything has to be
[1:30:35] done in church
[1:30:38] it's done by faith the faith revelation
[1:30:41] to revelation
[1:30:43] the love of god should have brought in
[1:30:45] your heart
[1:30:46] to many so i i just want to just really
[1:30:49] uh thrilled for the brethren uh um
[1:30:52] i i just hope that it it
[1:30:56] this calling in their lives never dies
[1:30:59] and that many more will feel a need
[1:31:03] in their life to fulfill something that
[1:31:06] might be missing
[1:31:08] and calling so they have all of my
[1:31:12] support
[1:31:12] i'm not the institutor of it i didn't
[1:31:15] plan the program that they did it
[1:31:18] and i'm glad they did and i'm behind
[1:31:20] them a hundred percent
[1:31:22] and i want to give them my support in
[1:31:25] prayer
[1:31:25] and in finance and who knows know what
[1:31:30] we're all waiting for don't you
[1:31:32] we're waiting for that last one to come
[1:31:35] in
[1:31:36] and and if they're on a mission to find
[1:31:39] them
[1:31:40] then praise god amen
[1:31:43] the lord richly bless you i hope you
[1:31:45] enjoyed that this evening
[1:31:47] uh at this time let us uh
[1:31:50] the brethren will go prepare for
[1:31:52] communion and
[1:31:54] get ready for communion we will
[1:31:59] let us stand since these scriptures are
[1:32:01] our
[1:32:02] scripture reading tonight
[1:32:18] and let us just read our communion
[1:32:21] scriptures but let's start with the 17th
[1:32:23] verse and
[1:32:25] see the wisdom of paul
[1:32:28] handling something that began to come
[1:32:31] into the church
[1:32:33] it says in the 17th verse now in this
[1:32:37] that i declared unto you
[1:32:41] i praise you not
[1:32:44] that you come together not for the
[1:32:47] better
[1:32:49] but for the worse for first of all when
[1:32:54] you come
[1:32:56] together in the church i hear
[1:33:00] that there be division among you
[1:33:03] and i partly believe it
[1:33:06] for there must be also heresies among
[1:33:09] you
[1:33:11] that they which are approved
[1:33:15] may be made manifest among you
[1:33:18] when you come together therefore unto
[1:33:21] one place
[1:33:23] is it not to eat the lord's supper
[1:33:28] for in eating everyone taketh before the
[1:33:31] other
[1:33:32] his own supper and one is hungry and
[1:33:36] another is drunken
[1:33:38] what have he not houses to eat
[1:33:42] and to drink in or despise ye the church
[1:33:45] of god
[1:33:47] and shame them that have not
[1:33:50] what shall i say unto you shall i praise
[1:33:53] you
[1:33:54] in this i praise you not
[1:33:58] for i have received of the lord that
[1:34:01] which
[1:34:01] also i delivered unto you
[1:34:04] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:34:07] which he was betrayed took
[1:34:09] bread and when he had given thanks
[1:34:12] he break it and said take eat
[1:34:15] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:34:19] this do in remembrance of me and after
[1:34:22] the same manner also took ye the cup
[1:34:25] when he had some sane this cup
[1:34:29] is the new testament in my blood
[1:34:33] this dewey as often as ye drink it
[1:34:38] in remembrance of me for as
[1:34:41] often as ye eat this bread and drink
[1:34:43] this cup you do show the lord's death
[1:34:46] till he come
[1:34:47] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:34:50] and drink
[1:34:51] this cup of the lord unworthily shall be
[1:34:53] guilty of the body and blood of the lord
[1:34:56] and let a man examine himself and so let
[1:34:59] him eat
[1:35:00] that bread and drink of that cup
[1:35:04] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:35:06] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:35:08] to himself
[1:35:09] not discerning the lord's body for this
[1:35:12] cause
[1:35:13] many are weak and sickly among you many
[1:35:16] sleep
[1:35:17] for if you would judge our your
[1:35:20] ourselves
[1:35:21] we should not be judged but when we are
[1:35:24] judged we are chastened of the lord that
[1:35:27] we should not be
[1:35:28] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:35:30] brother when you come together to eat
[1:35:32] tarry one for another
[1:35:34] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:35:38] home
[1:35:39] that you come not together unto
[1:35:41] condemnation
[1:35:42] and the rest will i set in order when i
[1:35:46] come
[1:35:46] amen god bless you brethren

[1:35:59] lies this
[1:36:01] great communion table

[1:36:08] feast in a personal communion with you
