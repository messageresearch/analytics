[32:02] just two minutes there's a little
[32:04] testimony to uh um to my special
[32:09] uh uh I don't know where to start from
[32:12] uh but first of all I want to like to
[32:14] thank the church uh for your messages
[32:16] the condolences for my father-in-law
[32:18] that passed couple weeks ago U got us
[32:23] into a place where we've never
[32:24] experienced that before I stay had my
[32:26] parents my wife stay had a parents at
[32:28] that time so it's the first time that
[32:29] something got so closed like that uh and
[32:33] while we were still grieving and still
[32:35] finding a way to say how do we how do we
[32:37] take ourself down home and you know uh
[32:40] it's a lot uh the devil decided to pick
[32:43] up extra shift uh and just kind of
[32:46] Torment us and just uh bring pain and
[32:50] you know compounding the old old e and
[32:54] um and I'll start with this just two
[32:55] part to it uh last week um I usually
[33:00] wake up very early in the morning for
[33:02] the past couple months just so I can get
[33:04] on the road and just run um been doing
[33:07] that since I was in the military and I
[33:08] wanted to get back to it for health
[33:10] reasons and so I wake up in the morning
[33:12] very early I get on the road and run and
[33:14] you know I would always keep the right
[33:16] lane like they would say keep face your
[33:18] coming vehicle I think I've been hearing
[33:20] that since I was a little kid and so
[33:22] I'll face my coming vehicle and just
[33:24] take some lap uh couple times in a week
[33:26] five miles sometimes times and then but
[33:29] this particular day I was like well I've
[33:31] been telling my wife I wanted to make
[33:32] sure it's 10 miles so I went and I did
[33:35] 10 miles and when I'm coming home I
[33:37] usually pick up the pace and I will stay
[33:39] on my right hand side until I get
[33:42] home but then on this particular day I
[33:44] think it was a Friday I kept on staying
[33:47] on my right hand side I mean left hand
[33:49] side rather facing the coming vehicle
[33:51] and then I made a switch I was couple
[33:54] blocks away from home and I made it
[33:57] which it was weird because I had to
[33:58] cross the roads to get on the other side
[34:00] of the road and I've never done that
[34:02] before I've always kept on my left and
[34:05] so suddenly I just crossed I was so
[34:08] tired that the cars that were even
[34:10] trying to exit the neighborhood were
[34:12] looking at me like if you still going
[34:14] that way why do you have to cross right
[34:16] in front of me to make that exit but I
[34:18] just kept on going and then all of a
[34:21] sudden um I just looked back and I heard
[34:24] this noise you know when the car is kind
[34:26] of like skied on the road and I just
[34:28] heard this sound and it just veered to
[34:31] the left which if I was on the other
[34:34] side of the road I would be exactly on
[34:37] that spot and this car knocked the whole
[34:40] you know the mailbox this concrete
[34:42] mailbox it knocked it off knocked some
[34:45] pose and then went on top of a car and
[34:47] just stood on top of a truck um and you
[34:50] know the neighbors just came outside and
[34:52] I just stood there and I was just
[34:54] looking I was just laughing I was like
[34:56] God you're so good cuz you made me just
[34:58] cross that place just not long ago and I
[35:01] was so exhausted I was just like thank
[35:07] God and um for if I say fortunately
[35:10] unfortunately the lady was a nurse just
[35:12] got out the car I was like you okay she
[35:14] said she's fine I think she had some
[35:16] problems with her wrist and you know I
[35:18] was just praying I was just like God you
[35:20] know my wife is a nurse as well she's
[35:21] probably coming back from work and I
[35:23] just kept on praying and um they came
[35:25] and they fixed it I just went home and I
[35:27] just sprayed um and I was like okay
[35:30] that's good um but all of a sudden my
[35:33] wife was coming back from work not that
[35:35] day couple days after that my wife was
[35:37] driving down from walk as well coming
[35:39] home and all of a sudden I just heard a
[35:42] call from my sister-in-law and say hey
[35:44] call your wife I was like what's the
[35:46] problem call my wife like and I picked
[35:48] up the phone called her she wouldn't
[35:50] pick up I was scared I quickly look on
[35:52] the app I saw where the car is actually
[35:54] located she was like I think she got
[35:56] into a wreck and because I could locate
[35:58] where the car was which wasn't far from
[36:01] here I drove all the way down from home
[36:03] and got there and um the car was
[36:07] completely wrecked and um and my wife
[36:10] came out of the car and scratched um and
[36:13] I was just so thankful to God to say Oh
[36:16] Lord You're so grateful um the car you
[36:20] would say the this person came out of
[36:22] this car and scratch if you actually
[36:24] look at the car uh the head back nothing
[36:26] deployed and I went home and me and my
[36:29] wife you know we started talking about
[36:30] okay the car is gone okay the car is
[36:32] gone I was like well we have life thank
[36:34] God the car is gone and then I was like
[36:36] why didn't the hairbag deployed you know
[36:39] I started pondering so much like the
[36:41] hair nothing deployed cuz the inside was
[36:44] intact but the whole outside is gone and
[36:46] something just told me and then I
[36:48] started doing my research I I know you
[36:50] know the force of what the airbag could
[36:52] be as well even if it deployed and
[36:55] something was like well I don't think
[36:56] your wife could take hairbag if it
[36:58] deployed because it's also it could also
[37:00] be very damaging and I just thank God I
[37:03] woke up a couple days after that I just
[37:05] started crying to say God if I haven't
[37:07] been thankful enough I'm just thankful
[37:10] I'm just grateful and I wanted to use
[37:11] this opportunity to come here not for
[37:13] anything but to say I'm grateful to God
[37:17] that uh when the enemy you know comes
[37:19] like a flood of many Waters the Bible
[37:22] says that you know God will always raise
[37:24] a standard and I think that's a standard
[37:26] that God has raised for all in my family
[37:28] so I'm really really grateful and I just
[37:30] have this short song it says uh thy
[37:33] loveing kindness is better than life
[37:36] uh thy loveing
[37:40] kindness is better than

[1:21:33] to you this morning let's turn our
[1:21:35] Bibles to Ephesians chapter
[1:21:38] 1 uh let's start
[1:21:40] from verse one
[1:21:57] says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[1:22:00] the will of
[1:22:02] God to the saints that are in Ephesus
[1:22:05] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:22:09] Grace be unto you and peace from God our
[1:22:11] Father and from L the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:14] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:22:16] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[1:22:19] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:22:21] places in Christ amen aren't you glad to
[1:22:24] be blessed this
[1:22:26] morning it says according as he has
[1:22:28] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:22:31] of the world it says that we should be
[1:22:33] holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:22:37] love it says having
[1:22:40] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:22:43] children by Christ Jes by Jesus Christ
[1:22:45] to him according to the good pleasure of
[1:22:48] his will I want to just point out to you
[1:22:51] so on forth it says according to his
[1:22:53] chosen us he has chosen us so the
[1:22:55] choosing is his choosing to begin with
[1:22:58] chosen Us in
[1:23:00] him before the foundation of the world
[1:23:03] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:23:05] before him in love chosen for a purpose
[1:23:09] so he's chosen us why does he choose us
[1:23:13] why am I chosen why did God call me what
[1:23:15] is the purpose of him calling that we
[1:23:18] should be holy and Without Blame before
[1:23:20] him in love having predestinated us to
[1:23:24] what just so we can say we are Christian
[1:23:27] no just so we can claim oh praise God
[1:23:29] I'm saved no predestinated as unto the
[1:23:33] adoption of children by Christ Jesus uh
[1:23:36] by by Jesus Christ to him according to
[1:23:39] the good pleasure of his will to the
[1:23:41] praises to the praise of his glory to
[1:23:45] the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:23:47] wherein he had made us accepted in the
[1:23:50] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[1:23:53] through his blood and the forgiveness of
[1:23:55] sin according to the riches of his grace
[1:23:58] wherein he had abound abounded toward us
[1:24:02] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[1:24:05] un known unto us the Mysteries the
[1:24:08] mystery of his will according to his
[1:24:11] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[1:24:14] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:24:17] fullness of time that he may gather
[1:24:21] together in one all things in Christ
[1:24:24] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:24:27] on earth even in him in whom also we
[1:24:32] have obtained The Inheritance being
[1:24:34] predestinated according to the person
[1:24:37] purpose of him who had who had worked
[1:24:40] all things after the councel of his own
[1:24:42] will that we should be to the Praises of
[1:24:47] his glory uh who first trusted in Christ
[1:24:51] in whom he also trusted after that he
[1:24:55] had heard the word of Truth The Gospel
[1:24:58] of your salvation in whom also after ye
[1:25:02] believed ye were sealed with the Holy
[1:25:05] Spirit of Promise let's just bow our
[1:25:08] heads our gracious father we ask that
[1:25:09] you bless your word to us this morning
[1:25:11] we're commit it to you in the name of
[1:25:13] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have
[1:25:16] your seats and as you are seated you can
[1:25:17] turn your Bibles
[1:25:19] also in 1 Peter chapter 1 we're going to
[1:25:22] read verse 10
[1:25:26] we're going to read uh let's read from
[1:25:28] let's start from verse 9 it says that
[1:25:31] receiving the end of your faith even the
[1:25:34] salvation of your soul of which
[1:25:37] salvation the prophet have inquired and
[1:25:39] search diligently who prophesied of the
[1:25:42] grace that should come unto you
[1:25:45] searching what or what manner of time
[1:25:49] the spirit of Christ which was in them
[1:25:53] did signify when he testify beforehand
[1:25:56] the suffering of Christ and the glory
[1:25:59] that should follow it says unto whom it
[1:26:03] was revealed that that unto them
[1:26:06] themselves but unto us did they Minister
[1:26:10] the things which which are now reported
[1:26:13] unto you by them that were preached the
[1:26:16] gospel unto you that the Holy Ghost sent
[1:26:19] down from heaven which things the angel
[1:26:22] desired to look to look into wherefore G
[1:26:26] up the loins of your mind be sober and
[1:26:30] hope to the end of the grace that is to
[1:26:33] be brought unto you at the revelation of
[1:26:37] Jesus Christ Ephesians chapter 2 I'll
[1:26:40] just read verse four it says but God who
[1:26:44] rich in
[1:26:45] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:26:48] loved us even when we were dead in sin
[1:26:52] had quickened us together in Christ by
[1:26:55] Grace ye are saved and has raised it up
[1:26:59] rais us up together and made it seat in
[1:27:02] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[1:27:06] the ages to come that he might show the
[1:27:08] exceeding reach of his grace reaches of
[1:27:12] his grace in his kindness towards us
[1:27:15] through Christ Jesus but for by Grace ye
[1:27:20] are saved through faith not of
[1:27:22] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[1:27:25] your Works lest any many should let less
[1:27:28] any man should boast for we are his
[1:27:30] workmanship created in in Christ Jesus
[1:27:34] unto good works which God had before
[1:27:38] ordained that we should walk in them I
[1:27:41] just want to uh take a few moment this
[1:27:44] morning and I want to speak on saved by
[1:27:47] grace through faith Sav by grace through
[1:27:51] faith so as we just read the scriptures
[1:27:54] this morning we we can certainly within
[1:27:57] our own selves and within our lives we
[1:27:59] can understand we we are so thankful to
[1:28:03] be gathered here this morning and we
[1:28:05] understand it can only be possible by
[1:28:07] the grace of God we we understand that
[1:28:10] if we we we breathe if we are alive if
[1:28:13] we are in good health if anything good
[1:28:16] ever happens to us if we are to be
[1:28:19] Christians this morning if we are able
[1:28:22] to see the word the revealed word of our
[1:28:25] time if we are able to see anything at
[1:28:29] all it's by the grace of God because the
[1:28:32] scripture tells us that any good and
[1:28:34] perfect things come from the father
[1:28:36] above we understand it's the grace of
[1:28:38] God that called you out of sin it's the
[1:28:41] grace of God that made you see this
[1:28:43] message that we believe it's the grace
[1:28:46] of God that made a way for you to be
[1:28:48] called a son and the daughter of God
[1:28:50] it's the grace of God that makes us what
[1:28:53] we are it's not not our effort it's not
[1:28:55] our ability it's not one cannot stand
[1:28:57] and say oh I'm strong enough to have
[1:29:00] believed this I I study this enough
[1:29:02] that's why I see it we understand that
[1:29:04] it's by the grace of God so as we read
[1:29:07] the scripture here this morning in
[1:29:08] Ephesians 2 it will say that uh that he
[1:29:12] had he and you had he quickened who were
[1:29:15] dead in sin and trespass in trespassing
[1:29:19] sin so we can understand this morning by
[1:29:22] the word of by the word of God that one
[1:29:24] time we were called the children of
[1:29:26] disobedient we were in sin walking after
[1:29:30] the last of our flesh and doing the
[1:29:32] things the same way the world will do we
[1:29:35] were in bars we were in clubs and we
[1:29:38] were on the church pew we were
[1:29:41] everywhere we were we were the children
[1:29:43] of this we were with the children of
[1:29:45] disobedient but God who's rich in Mercy
[1:29:49] he came by his great love and he spoke
[1:29:51] to us and he spoke to us what what made
[1:29:54] the change was God grace was extended
[1:29:58] unto us it wasn't because we were the
[1:30:00] brightest it wasn't because we were the
[1:30:03] best that there was in fact I want to
[1:30:05] say this this morning between us that
[1:30:08] are sit here in this church and the
[1:30:10] person outside the only difference is
[1:30:12] the grace of God it's not because we
[1:30:15] were somehow constructed differently
[1:30:17] than they were or we somehow have more
[1:30:19] knowledge that the were that they are so
[1:30:21] we can believe the message or the word
[1:30:23] of God no if if the grace of God has
[1:30:26] ever been taken out of us we are exactly
[1:30:29] the same as the person outside there the
[1:30:32] only difference is God opened our eyes
[1:30:35] for us to see this message the only
[1:30:37] difference is the grace of God was
[1:30:39] extended to you so you could be called
[1:30:42] out of sin so you don't have to live the
[1:30:44] life of a drunker so you don't have to
[1:30:46] be a prostitute so you you don't have to
[1:30:49] be caught in sin and darkness the grace
[1:30:51] of God extended to you is what makes the
[1:30:54] difference and I want to say this
[1:30:56] morning that's why as Christians what we
[1:30:58] desire is for that same Grace to be
[1:31:00] extended to others we don't want to just
[1:31:03] SK it for ourselves when you see a
[1:31:05] person walking out there with purple
[1:31:07] hair with all kinds of stuff tattoos and
[1:31:10] everything you don't look at them and
[1:31:11] trash them and say they are a sinner
[1:31:14] what you're praying for is oh if the
[1:31:16] same Grace that have come across if the
[1:31:19] same Grace that changed me can come to
[1:31:21] them I tell you Grace can make the
[1:31:23] difference
[1:31:25] Grace will bring things that cannot be
[1:31:27] brought into existence and Grace will
[1:31:29] change the situation Grace will come and
[1:31:32] it will come and it will bring the will
[1:31:34] of God into existence so the scripture
[1:31:36] will say wherein in time pass you walk
[1:31:39] after the course according to the course
[1:31:42] of this world and according to the
[1:31:44] princes and the power of the air it says
[1:31:46] the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:31:48] children of Disobedience among whom you
[1:31:51] also had our conversation in time pass
[1:31:55] it says in the lust of your flesh the
[1:31:57] the the the the the the the fullness of
[1:32:00] the desire of the Flesh and and your
[1:32:03] mind it will say even the fullness In
[1:32:05] the Flesh and the mind the LLY flesh of
[1:32:07] the mind and were by Nature the children
[1:32:10] of Wrath even as others so we we can't
[1:32:15] stand here and boast and and that's why
[1:32:18] when you meet somebody you try to show
[1:32:20] him the word or you try to show him the
[1:32:22] scripture they may not understand it
[1:32:24] they may not see it then you look and
[1:32:26] they said how can they not see it it's
[1:32:28] so simple it's so open and oh it's just
[1:32:31] the scripture you just read why can't
[1:32:32] you see you you have to have a mind to
[1:32:36] understand that the only reason you see
[1:32:37] it is because God opened your eyes to
[1:32:39] see it the only reason you understand it
[1:32:42] is because God made it so you can
[1:32:44] understand it and if God made you
[1:32:46] understand it you have to pray that as
[1:32:49] you're showing them that the same God
[1:32:51] who made it you to see it that the same
[1:32:53] God can do for them the same way but God
[1:32:56] who's rich in Mercy for his great love
[1:32:59] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:33:02] dead in sin and trespass had he Quicken
[1:33:05] us together with Christ he said by Grace
[1:33:09] ye are sav not of yourself but the grace
[1:33:12] of God he had raised us up together and
[1:33:15] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[1:33:18] in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[1:33:21] that he might show that he might show
[1:33:23] his exceeding reaches of his grace and
[1:33:26] his kindness towards us through Christ
[1:33:28] Jesus Christ let me say this in the
[1:33:31] dispensation we live in the dispensation
[1:33:33] of the fullness of Christ we live in the
[1:33:36] time so if you take him from Adam and
[1:33:38] you run it all the way to the end what
[1:33:41] you see all across the the Bible is the
[1:33:44] grace of God how it was extended from
[1:33:46] ages to ages and it says now that in the
[1:33:50] dispensation of fullness of time oh I
[1:33:52] even think when we gather around the
[1:33:54] table and we sit there on our great
[1:33:56] supper when we begin to tell the
[1:33:58] testimony of one another it's not going
[1:34:00] to be how strong you were or how the
[1:34:03] ability you had to do things or how that
[1:34:06] you saw things that others didn't see
[1:34:08] it's going to be the story about the
[1:34:10] grace of God when we go across and you
[1:34:13] begin to ask each one how did you make
[1:34:15] it and you'll talk like we heard this
[1:34:17] morning oh I was in a place and there
[1:34:20] was a situation where I could have died
[1:34:22] and I was caught in the car accident and
[1:34:25] and this happened and and somehow
[1:34:27] something happened and Grace came by my
[1:34:29] way when we begin to go around and talk
[1:34:32] and said oh I was in the drunkest house
[1:34:35] and something happened to me oh I was in
[1:34:37] the church buau I listened to the word
[1:34:39] day in and day out but one day grace
[1:34:41] strick my heart and then it changed me
[1:34:44] it was going to be the S I thought about
[1:34:47] the the thief at the cross here he was
[1:34:49] there was no time for him he was there
[1:34:52] he already squandered everything that he
[1:34:54] had and he the time that he had he
[1:34:56] squandered everything and here is it
[1:34:59] perhaps taking his last breath and close
[1:35:01] to dying and somehow he looks across him
[1:35:05] Grace was across him and he looks at him
[1:35:07] and says as we deserve what's happening
[1:35:09] to us but this man he doesn't deserve
[1:35:12] what's happening to him he says oh the
[1:35:14] Lord that you may remember me that day
[1:35:16] in the kingdom and Grace looked at him
[1:35:18] and says this night not another day this
[1:35:22] night you shall be with me in Paradise
[1:35:24] that's what Grace did for you that's
[1:35:27] what Grace can do this morning this
[1:35:29] morning not another day not tomorrow not
[1:35:32] another time this morning Grace can
[1:35:35] change the
[1:35:39] circumstance that in the dispensation to
[1:35:41] come when you take it from Genesis all
[1:35:45] the way to Revelation that in every
[1:35:48] dispensation it's the story of the
[1:35:50] abounding grace of God the Grace that
[1:35:54] started right the beginning but whatam
[1:35:56] says one PR it says Grace is old oh I
[1:36:00] like that when Grace was part of the
[1:36:02] plan Grace was what God made sure that
[1:36:05] you could get there Grace the grace of
[1:36:08] God is the only thing from Des from
[1:36:11] source to destination Grace is the thing
[1:36:14] that said that no matter what you're
[1:36:16] going to make it no matter what happens
[1:36:18] you're going to make it Grace is the
[1:36:20] thing that knows I know that's going to
[1:36:22] be difficult ities along the way I know
[1:36:25] there's going to be challenges across
[1:36:26] the road I know there's going to be all
[1:36:28] kinds of stuff happen in between but I'm
[1:36:31] here to guarantee you that from start to
[1:36:34] finish you're going to be making it at
[1:36:36] the end of
[1:36:37] it oh the grace of God so that's why
[1:36:41] it's important when we come as
[1:36:43] Christians it's important we understand
[1:36:46] that the only reason why we gather here
[1:36:48] this morning is because of the grace of
[1:36:51] God and and we and because it started by
[1:36:55] Grace it will end by
[1:36:58] Grace it's not Grace and then law steps
[1:37:01] in between man does that but God doesn't
[1:37:04] do that so if he started off with Grace
[1:37:07] we are dependent on his grace every
[1:37:10] morning when we wake up in the morning
[1:37:13] our ability to put One Foot In Front Of
[1:37:15] Another is by his grace our ability to
[1:37:18] go in prayer and pray for him to do
[1:37:20] things we dependent on the grace and
[1:37:23] when we we open our Bibles when we read
[1:37:25] it's all by his grace so without him we
[1:37:28] can do
[1:37:29] nothing without his grace extended
[1:37:32] without him we are lost as lost could be
[1:37:35] men always tries to feel like they they
[1:37:39] they they have done something to Merit
[1:37:41] the grace of God it's a human nature now
[1:37:45] even after we have received Grace man
[1:37:47] tries to pile up work so he can balance
[1:37:51] out the grace so he can and said well
[1:37:54] yeah I know God saved me but here I am
[1:37:57] I've done now so much that I could feel
[1:37:59] like I deserve that Grace you don't
[1:38:01] deserve it let me say you don't deserve
[1:38:04] it that if you can add one Cube to your
[1:38:07] stature the scripture say then Jesus
[1:38:09] Christ died in vain so what God wants us
[1:38:11] to do is to operate and be Reliant
[1:38:15] solely on his grace when we approach him
[1:38:18] is by Grace when we receive something is
[1:38:21] by Grace whatever happens he want want
[1:38:23] us to be reminded that it's by the grace
[1:38:26] of God and and and because remember it's
[1:38:29] Satan who tempts Us by by The
[1:38:32] Works he he will try and and you know
[1:38:35] you're like well you know I go to church
[1:38:37] every day so this can happen to
[1:38:40] me you say he will do that yeah he did
[1:38:43] it with the
[1:38:45] Prophet The Prophet is there and losing
[1:38:48] his son and his daughter and and his
[1:38:51] wife and the Devil comes next to him he
[1:38:53] says you know look at you you've given
[1:38:57] all your life for this look at you you
[1:39:00] youve preached and you've done all of
[1:39:02] this and now you asking him to save your
[1:39:05] your your wife and your your daughter he
[1:39:07] wouldn't even do it why he was taking
[1:39:10] and measuring trying to balance out the
[1:39:12] grace not understanding that if you ever
[1:39:16] can do anything it's by the grace of God
[1:39:19] it's never by men's ability and brother
[1:39:21] I'm looks at it said they looked at and
[1:39:24] all of the sudden something took hold
[1:39:26] within his heart and he knew that
[1:39:28] everything that he was it was only by
[1:39:30] the grace of God and he made the great
[1:39:32] statement he says the lord giveth the
[1:39:34] Lord takes away blessed be the name of
[1:39:37] the Lord let me say this morning that's
[1:39:39] what a Christian is whether it be death
[1:39:41] that strike sickness that strike
[1:39:43] whatever strike let me say this I come
[1:39:46] from God I go back to God whatever
[1:39:49] happens blessed be his name I'm here to
[1:39:52] glorify the purpose of the Living God
[1:39:54] I'm not going to give a devil an inch of
[1:39:56] my life whatever happens I'm there
[1:39:59] glorifying God oh it's for the glory of
[1:40:02] your kingdom it's for the grace the the
[1:40:05] purpose of Grace being glorified
[1:40:07] remember it's in the dispensation to
[1:40:09] come all that's going to be is the glory
[1:40:12] of that Grace that came to
[1:40:16] us so as we read as we just saw the
[1:40:21] scripture will talk to us and say it's
[1:40:23] according to his grace and all those
[1:40:26] things and by the the scripture uh oh I
[1:40:31] just I'll just read this for the second
[1:40:33] time so so we don't have to go through
[1:40:36] everything now when you speak about
[1:40:38] Grace by definition Grace and and and
[1:40:43] we'll see more as we go by is the unmar
[1:40:47] favor of
[1:40:50] God it's the free and unmerited favor of
[1:40:55] Mighty God you can't work for it you
[1:40:59] cannot do enough to Merit it you can do
[1:41:02] enough works to say that you've got it
[1:41:04] there's nothing that could but says it
[1:41:07] can't be sold it can't be
[1:41:09] bought it it's the grace of the Mighty
[1:41:12] God is God himself Grace it's not
[1:41:15] fairness it's not oh I have done this
[1:41:18] therefore I deserve Grace no that's not
[1:41:21] Grace Grace is the UNM merited favor of
[1:41:25] God
[1:41:26] himself Grace is when you you you have
[1:41:29] done wrong and when you have done all
[1:41:32] that you done and and and the the
[1:41:35] natural course of life is that now you
[1:41:38] deserve the pishman when Adam had done
[1:41:41] wrong the natural cause was if you eat
[1:41:44] this you shall die when you done wrong
[1:41:47] when you committed sin and when you came
[1:41:49] and and you knew that the natural
[1:41:52] progression of things things say now I
[1:41:54] should die Grace is the god stepping in
[1:41:58] and say not
[1:42:01] today when when when the course has been
[1:42:04] run and when you come and you know you
[1:42:06] have broken the word of God and when
[1:42:08] you've come you know you've done wrong
[1:42:10] and you are convinced that whatever is
[1:42:13] about to come I deserve it when you know
[1:42:15] that there's no Escape my hands have
[1:42:18] done it I have done wrong and have
[1:42:20] walked away I'm a sinner I don't deserve
[1:42:23] the
[1:42:23] I deserve to die right now Grace is God
[1:42:27] stepping in and saying I'm changing the
[1:42:30] course of your
[1:42:32] life I I remember and I thought about
[1:42:35] this Brother David gave this definition
[1:42:36] that just stayed with me Grace is
[1:42:39] decision from the Throne of God that
[1:42:42] changes the course of what's awaiting
[1:42:44] for
[1:42:45] you what you know that the the the the
[1:42:49] the scripture says that the wages of sin
[1:42:51] is death and and we know that's why we
[1:42:54] go through our lives and something will
[1:42:56] happen and and we know oh this is
[1:42:59] perhaps because what I did over here you
[1:43:01] know the course and the progression of
[1:43:03] life and what's way for you but Grace is
[1:43:06] the grace of God and God himself not
[1:43:09] another person not an angel God himself
[1:43:12] stepping in and saying that I know this
[1:43:15] is what you deserve but I'm deciding to
[1:43:17] change it I know this is what you're
[1:43:20] supposed to get but I'm here to change
[1:43:22] the course of your your life now listen
[1:43:25] to this brother B says and and for the
[1:43:27] sake of time I'll just read it I I won't
[1:43:30] have time to just uh walk through every
[1:43:32] single one of it and this is this is our
[1:43:35] qut so you may take it and go search for
[1:43:38] every qut then and find it but says this
[1:43:41] grace is
[1:43:43] love Grace is love Grace is what God
[1:43:48] does for you works is what we do for God
[1:43:52] to show up appreciation of what God did
[1:43:55] for you Grace but by Grace ye are saved
[1:43:59] it says for it's by Grace we are saved
[1:44:02] not by what not by what we can do or or
[1:44:06] or what we can whatever we do is not
[1:44:09] accountant to us Grace is what saves us
[1:44:13] Grace he says by Grace you are saved
[1:44:15] through faith Grace is so far above law
[1:44:20] law is not even in the picture amen oh I
[1:44:23] love that Grace is so far above the law
[1:44:27] that when we talk about Grace is is oh I
[1:44:31] tell you in the human nature we we judge
[1:44:34] what's fair and what's not fair yeah he
[1:44:36] is you can look at somebody and they've
[1:44:38] done wrong and they've committed a crime
[1:44:40] and and everybody calls for their
[1:44:42] punishment or they deserve to die they
[1:44:45] deserve to die and then the judge come
[1:44:47] on the bench and he looks at them and
[1:44:48] says no this person is going to go free
[1:44:51] everybody's going to rise up and say no
[1:44:53] this is not fair that's not what they
[1:44:55] deserve that's what Grace does when you
[1:44:57] deserve death When Death was knocking at
[1:45:00] your door when death was there claiming
[1:45:03] the works that you're done and and you
[1:45:05] were surely to die Grace of sin and says
[1:45:08] today is not the
[1:45:10] day grace is so far above the law the
[1:45:14] law is not even in the picture Grace is
[1:45:17] the only thing that takes us through it
[1:45:21] says never the law never law Grace is a
[1:45:24] way provided for each individual to
[1:45:27] return us to the rightful
[1:45:32] inheritance Grace and this is all the
[1:45:34] quotes for Prophet saying grace is Grace
[1:45:38] is the way provided for each individual
[1:45:41] to return us to the rightful inheritance
[1:45:44] Grace is still in
[1:45:47] existence his love and grace is the same
[1:45:51] tonight
[1:45:53] says this in another place Grace is old
[1:45:56] Grace is as old as the world is Grace
[1:46:00] was first shown to the human race when
[1:46:03] he when when we had in the beginning of
[1:46:05] the human race and then he says and his
[1:46:08] grace is from Everlasting unto
[1:46:12] Everlasting Hallelujah this morning all
[1:46:15] what we need this morning is to
[1:46:17] understand that the only way we can make
[1:46:19] progress is by the grace of God the only
[1:46:22] way we can go forward is by the grace of
[1:46:24] God that's why you don't look at the
[1:46:26] person next to you and we often time you
[1:46:29] know do it in our mind even without
[1:46:31] realizing you look at them and say look
[1:46:33] at the way the dress or look at them and
[1:46:35] all of the sudden we come up with a
[1:46:37] judgment of what they need oh what they
[1:46:39] need is this and what they need is that
[1:46:41] let me tell you what we need all of us
[1:46:44] is the grace of
[1:46:46] God what we all need is the grace of God
[1:46:50] let me tell you your words are not going
[1:46:52] to save any body your your your critics
[1:46:54] are not going to help anybody what you
[1:46:57] need is the Heart full of grace when you
[1:47:00] can go on your knees and pray for
[1:47:02] somebody and then when you speak Grace
[1:47:05] will come out and Grace will make a
[1:47:10] difference the scripture will speak
[1:47:13] about
[1:47:14] Adam yeah are oh I wish I just could
[1:47:18] explain this this morning butam said
[1:47:21] yeah they are they had sin in the Garden
[1:47:24] of Eden and here they are the natural
[1:47:28] cause of a human bam says what they did
[1:47:31] they ran and they asked they they ran
[1:47:33] away to get a
[1:47:36] covering what they did because they had
[1:47:39] sin what did Sin cause them to do they
[1:47:42] feel they were unworthy so therefore
[1:47:45] they looked for something to cover
[1:47:47] themselves they went after their sin
[1:47:50] what they were looking for was not to go
[1:47:52] before God they ran away because they
[1:47:55] knew what they' done was wrong and guess
[1:47:57] what religion is is a covering let me
[1:48:00] say this what we're looking for this
[1:48:02] morning is not covering we're not here
[1:48:04] to cover our sins or to cover our wrong
[1:48:07] what we need is to expose it before God
[1:48:10] so Grace could be
[1:48:13] extended say God I'm wrong this morning
[1:48:16] I done wrong I broke your word I broke
[1:48:19] your commandment what I need is your
[1:48:21] grace to be extended to me I I I I don't
[1:48:24] even have the very definition or know
[1:48:27] how to do right unless your grace is
[1:48:30] extended unto me so yeah they are and
[1:48:33] and and and God knew there was a law
[1:48:36] that says the day you shall eat you
[1:48:37] shall die so God comes down in the
[1:48:40] garden and he looks at them and says all
[1:48:43] of a sudden Grace came on the scene now
[1:48:46] he takes and Grace provided a skin a
[1:48:49] lamb skin for them to be uh to wear that
[1:48:52] that morning or that evening he came in
[1:48:54] he provided away he took away the
[1:48:56] religion and provided him his skin and
[1:48:59] then he says he looked to them and and
[1:49:02] by by the word and by the Commandment he
[1:49:04] had to drive them out of the Garden of
[1:49:06] Eden but it says gra didn't sto there
[1:49:09] after they wor those bloody skins and
[1:49:11] they walking and the skin is beating and
[1:49:14] the blood is the grace stood up and said
[1:49:17] I'll make a way this is not the end of
[1:49:19] it I'll come back and I'll make sure you
[1:49:22] come back in in the garden let me say
[1:49:24] this grace is the only thing that makes
[1:49:26] sure that you can come back into the
[1:49:28] kingdom of God grace made away it wasn't
[1:49:33] because they were good and they done
[1:49:35] good and all of that in fact yes the
[1:49:37] prophet saying in the messageer
[1:49:40] hymn uh preached on December 15 uh 1956
[1:49:45] paragraph
[1:49:46] 12 butam
[1:49:49] says oh I love this it says
[1:49:53] salvation isn't doing a lot of good
[1:49:59] works oh
[1:50:02] my I tell you if you preach that to the
[1:50:05] Pentecostals Baptist and all of that
[1:50:08] they're going to kick you right
[1:50:10] out because the whole religious world is
[1:50:13] built upon how much good works you can
[1:50:15] pile up for
[1:50:17] yourself it it's always about a balance
[1:50:21] oh if I could put more no good works
[1:50:24] that means when I get to heaven I'll
[1:50:25] show the list of my good works and they
[1:50:28] will look at me and say oh son you've
[1:50:30] done so much good get
[1:50:33] in the they they go right across the
[1:50:36] scripture that says that depart from me
[1:50:38] doers of iniquity I never even knew
[1:50:44] you so Grace he says so
[1:50:48] salvation isn't doing a lot of good
[1:50:50] works Grace is what brings God to us God
[1:50:55] Saves Us by grace and no man has never
[1:50:58] sought God never no man never saw God at
[1:51:01] any time the Bible says he didn't you
[1:51:05] say well I S God all night I love this
[1:51:08] you know we go we do something and all
[1:51:10] of a sudden inspiration goes up and we
[1:51:13] feel like oh now I deserve to say you
[1:51:15] don't deserve
[1:51:17] nothing and he says it says you you I
[1:51:21] saw God all night and he said the Bible
[1:51:23] says he didn't you say I sought God all
[1:51:26] night no you never God sought you man's
[1:51:32] very nature in the Garden of Eden proves
[1:51:35] it instead of her Adam running up and
[1:51:37] down the garden saying oh Father where
[1:51:40] are th it was God hunting down Adam and
[1:51:45] saying Adam where at
[1:51:47] down the very nature that desire that
[1:51:50] relies in the Mortal body is we run away
[1:51:54] and find a covering but the nature of
[1:51:56] God is always to run after man he says
[1:51:59] see we turn the we turn the picture
[1:52:02] around here it says this will settle it
[1:52:05] if you if if if if for it will settle it
[1:52:08] for you if there's a question in your
[1:52:10] mind Jesus say no man can come to me
[1:52:13] except my father draws him first it says
[1:52:16] that settles it he says it all right so
[1:52:19] it's by the the the the the
[1:52:22] understanding that within us the nature
[1:52:24] of man we are not built to look for God
[1:52:28] to search for God to to to we not build
[1:52:31] for us to to try to please God by our
[1:52:34] own nature but it's the nature of God to
[1:52:37] always come after us it's in the nature
[1:52:40] of God to always provide a way it's in
[1:52:43] the nature of God to always provide a
[1:52:45] way of escape and it's not even when we
[1:52:48] are asking for it it's when we run away
[1:52:51] we're running away from
[1:53:02] it's when we are running away from
[1:53:06] it butam says in the message of Grace
[1:53:09] paragraph 82 it
[1:53:12] says the grace of God was promised in
[1:53:15] the Garden of Eden and Grace came Grace
[1:53:19] came to Adam and Eve it says nowhere to
[1:53:22] go
[1:53:22] no no know which way to turn and yet
[1:53:26] Grace made a way let me say this it says
[1:53:30] my sinner friend you may be here this
[1:53:33] morning a prostitute you may be here
[1:53:37] this morning a woman Chester you may be
[1:53:40] here you may be here a drunker or a
[1:53:44] gambler or a murderer you might be here
[1:53:48] as an impure husband or an impure wife
[1:53:51] you may be
[1:53:53] you may be you may be the vience of
[1:53:55] Sinners you say I am past the stage of
[1:53:59] redemption no you are
[1:54:03] not it says and you wouldn't be here at
[1:54:06] the church this morning it says Grace
[1:54:10] will make a way for you in the dark hour
[1:54:14] if you will just accept it Adam had to
[1:54:18] be willing to accept it and so do you
[1:54:21] accept
[1:54:23] oh my brother my sister what we need is
[1:54:25] the understanding that it's Grace that's
[1:54:28] going to get us to the Finish Line Grace
[1:54:31] is the part of God that's determined
[1:54:33] that you're going to make it Grace is
[1:54:35] Jesus Christ himself Grace is the God
[1:54:39] himself making himself known unto his
[1:54:41] people saying that today I'm going to
[1:54:44] make sure that you make it Grace is when
[1:54:46] you have Oh I thought about brother I'm
[1:54:48] talking about uh in I I don't know what
[1:54:51] message is he talks about this lady
[1:54:53] called uh the lady uh uh makabe of
[1:54:57] Oklahoma he speaks about her there they
[1:54:59] is and there's all the religions of the
[1:55:01] world they gather together and and it
[1:55:04] talks about I believe the name of the
[1:55:06] man is Dr Ian or something they come and
[1:55:09] they gather together and there's this
[1:55:11] woman with a record that nobody even
[1:55:13] could even ever heard of uh she's
[1:55:15] drinking smoking and all kind done all
[1:55:18] kinds of things and they're looking at
[1:55:20] her and each religion began to come by
[1:55:23] and everything they look at her and they
[1:55:25] look at her they had no hope no answer
[1:55:27] for her why because every religion is
[1:55:30] based upon what you can do what you can
[1:55:32] offer to your God and then so this man
[1:55:35] comes across and he looks and there she
[1:55:37] is he says I'm thankful for the blood of
[1:55:40] Jesus Christ but what says he jumps and
[1:55:42] he clicks his heel and says I'm thankful
[1:55:45] for the blood of Jesus Christ it can
[1:55:47] only not clean her outside but it will
[1:55:49] also clean her heart let me say this the
[1:55:51] god that we serve he comes he himself he
[1:55:55] comes and He makes himself your
[1:55:59] righteousness thank you it's the only
[1:56:02] religion that will make a change all the
[1:56:04] others is how much you can pray and what
[1:56:07] you can offer and how you can do how
[1:56:09] many pendants you can do what you can
[1:56:11] offer the only religion that promise
[1:56:14] that the God himself will come and he
[1:56:17] will make himself one with you he will
[1:56:19] take away your desire of sin he will
[1:56:21] take away your desire for the things of
[1:56:23] the world he will wash you a clean he
[1:56:26] will take his spirit and put it in
[1:56:30] you don't ever forget
[1:56:40] that and the scripture will
[1:56:44] say in Mark
[1:56:47] 4 it
[1:56:50] says and he said unto them
[1:56:54] he that has an ear let him
[1:56:58] hear and when he has he was
[1:57:01] alone the scripture
[1:57:03] says they that were about him and the 12
[1:57:08] ask of him the
[1:57:11] parable and he said unto them unto you
[1:57:16] it is given to them the mystery of the
[1:57:18] kingdom of
[1:57:20] God but unto
[1:57:23] that are without all these things are
[1:57:26] done in
[1:57:28] Parable that seeing listen to this that
[1:57:34] seeing they may see and not
[1:57:39] perceive so seeing is not really
[1:57:41] perceiving there's a seeing where you
[1:57:43] can see but you're not perceiving in
[1:57:45] fact the scripture says the kingdom of
[1:57:47] God it says that it's not unless you are
[1:57:49] born again it's not given for you to see
[1:57:51] the kingdom of God not with the eyes but
[1:57:53] the understanding heart to understand
[1:57:55] what God is saying and hearing they may
[1:57:58] not hear and not understand lest at any
[1:58:02] time that they should be converted in
[1:58:04] their sin and should be
[1:58:06] forgiven them so God purposely does it
[1:58:12] that others receive the grace to see and
[1:58:15] understand and others don't God
[1:58:19] purposely does it that when he's
[1:58:21] rewarded is preached and when the word
[1:58:23] is going forth that others have the
[1:58:25] capability of understanding and seeing
[1:58:27] and others don't and I want to say this
[1:58:29] morning I'm not here to condemn
[1:58:31] everybody I'm just thankful that I can
[1:58:33] see it I'm just thankful that my eyes
[1:58:36] have been open you know we we we hear
[1:58:39] yeah we we have this message and we go
[1:58:41] through it and we talk about it and
[1:58:43] people Rejoice let let never take it for
[1:58:45] granted never just look at it and say
[1:58:48] well I understand what the prophet say I
[1:58:50] understand this no that's not the right
[1:58:52] you should be thankful about it and you
[1:58:54] should be praying for the person next to
[1:58:56] you so God can do the same thing it's by
[1:59:00] the grace of God it's not of your effort
[1:59:03] it's not because you worked hard at
[1:59:05] understanding it it's because God by his
[1:59:08] grace he made a way so you can see
[1:59:12] it the scripture says in Psalm it says
[1:59:16] Psalm 23 says oh I'll just Skip and read
[1:59:20] verse uh four it says yeah though I walk
[1:59:23] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:59:24] death I will not fear for thou are with
[1:59:27] me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:59:30] it says Thou preparest a table before me
[1:59:33] in the presence of my enemy and thou
[1:59:35] anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:59:38] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[1:59:43] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:59:46] and I will dwell in the house of God of
[1:59:48] the Lord forever so surely it's not by
[1:59:52] my strength but surely the Lord has made
[1:59:55] it so that his goodness and mercy is
[1:59:57] following me I didn't do anything to
[1:59:59] deserve it I couldn't earn it whatever I
[2:00:02] do is only in Thanksgiving for what he
[2:00:05] already done so Grace is given for a
[2:00:08] purpose for for a purpose of redemption
[2:00:11] it's given for the purpose for God to
[2:00:14] achieve what he wants to achieve out of
[2:00:16] you Grace is God coming himself and
[2:00:19] providing Redemption so you can be
[2:00:22] brought back to the original state that
[2:00:24] you need to be
[2:00:27] in oh my I just want to receive his
[2:00:31] grace this morning I I I think it's
[2:00:35] always important that you you view
[2:00:37] things through the eyes of Grace because
[2:00:39] it's going to help you balance out a lot
[2:00:41] of things that you understand it's going
[2:00:44] to remove Grace doesn't puffed up itself
[2:00:47] Grace hasn't come through a situation
[2:00:49] where it feels like I've made it or I
[2:00:51] understand it more than anybody Grace
[2:00:53] will Grace will keep you
[2:00:55] humble Grace will make you always
[2:00:58] understand that if I can do this it's
[2:01:00] because God allowed me to do that if I
[2:01:03] can live right it's by the grace of God
[2:01:05] that I'm living
[2:01:11] right I love
[2:01:14] this yes the prophet speaking
[2:01:18] about Abraham
[2:01:20] and and it will come in and we
[2:01:24] understand when God made the first
[2:01:25] Covenant with Adam is the adamic
[2:01:29] Covenant it was made by what men can do
[2:01:31] he said that the day you eat you shall
[2:01:33] die and you they that they had to stay
[2:01:36] away from the Tree of knowledge and we
[2:01:39] understand that they broke that and then
[2:01:42] God comes and in the The Covenant that
[2:01:45] he makes with Abraham now he saying that
[2:01:48] it's not what you do it's all based on
[2:01:51] what I have done he he's wanting now now
[2:01:54] to know that there's nothing restricted
[2:01:57] there's nothing here that you are
[2:02:00] expected to do except to believe I have
[2:02:03] taken everything under myself if you
[2:02:06] accept what I'm giving you you shall be
[2:02:09] saved the whole Covenant from beginning
[2:02:11] to end the Fulfillment of it is based on
[2:02:15] what I have to offer God is sending the
[2:02:18] Covenant and but what I'm call it it's
[2:02:20] Abraham Grace Covenant God changing the
[2:02:24] Covenant to say that this morning if any
[2:02:27] of us desire anything if you desire to
[2:02:30] be saved if you desire for your life to
[2:02:32] be right it's not based upon you it's
[2:02:35] based upon you believing on what God has
[2:02:37] already done and if you can receive it
[2:02:40] this morning God is obligated by his
[2:02:43] Covenant to change
[2:02:45] you oh what a covenant this morning oh
[2:02:48] what that that if I have a need this
[2:02:51] morning I don't have to rely on my own
[2:02:53] ability or my own ability of discernment
[2:02:56] or strength or anything in fact it looks
[2:02:59] at his word he tells Paul and says in
[2:03:01] fact let me let you know he says that
[2:03:04] it's in your weakness that I'm made
[2:03:05] perfect it's in your weakness that my
[2:03:08] strength is made perfect so I'm taking
[2:03:11] your weakness and it's strength to me so
[2:03:13] if you want to be strong bring your
[2:03:15] weaknesses to me and I will give you
[2:03:18] strength
[2:03:22] he says this in Abraham Grace Covenant
[2:03:25] par uh preaching old 3117 paragraph 24
[2:03:28] it says now he made he made it to
[2:03:32] Abraham it says not not Abraham not
[2:03:36] Abraham if you do this a certain thing
[2:03:40] it says I'll make you great nation of
[2:03:43] you and make you father of all Nations
[2:03:47] listen to this now he said
[2:03:51] I have done it now I I love this because
[2:03:57] he's not saying I will do
[2:04:00] it I I want you to cat this he's not
[2:04:04] saying I'm going to do it no he's saying
[2:04:08] it's already
[2:04:10] completed I Abraham I'm giving you a
[2:04:14] finished work I am giving you a way
[2:04:19] that's already completed I'm giving you
[2:04:22] a Grace that's been extended that if you
[2:04:25] would accept the extended Grace you're
[2:04:27] going to make it through the grace
[2:04:29] you're going to make it to my profession
[2:04:32] so he says I have done it remember the
[2:04:35] promise is altogether Grace he says not
[2:04:39] mix not La mixed in it at all not not
[2:04:43] any it says ifs or at all it's
[2:04:47] absolutely God choosing of
[2:04:50] Abraham Abraham didn't do enough works
[2:04:53] to deserve this he he his Works were
[2:04:56] never included into this now in fact
[2:04:58] listen to this butam says he says not
[2:05:01] even if he says now even if you don't
[2:05:04] agree with some of the some of it it
[2:05:07] says let's just give it a prayerful
[2:05:10] consideration now you see it says it
[2:05:12] isn't what you do what you done but what
[2:05:15] our desire it says it wasn't Abraham
[2:05:18] desire he he was a hidden and he come
[2:05:21] down from the Tower of Babel down to the
[2:05:24] valley of Shar and and and in the land
[2:05:27] of calans in the city of her he says he
[2:05:30] was just an ordinary man it says nothing
[2:05:33] Abraham had done not even his
[2:05:36] [Applause]
[2:05:37] desire your desire to worship God comes
[2:05:40] from God
[2:05:43] [Applause]
[2:05:45] himself your desire to be holy comes
[2:05:48] from God himself you didn't create that
[2:05:50] desire there was was nothing in you to
[2:05:53] generate that desire so if you really
[2:05:56] understand what God is saying here it's
[2:05:57] all together Grace from start to the
[2:06:02] end it's God fulfilling his word on both
[2:06:05] side he comes over here he places the
[2:06:08] desire he runs over here says come onto
[2:06:11] me and I will make you clean come onto
[2:06:14] me and I will save you come unto me and
[2:06:17] I'll provide healing it's all together
[2:06:20] God from start to finish now listen to
[2:06:23] this nothing Abraham done not even his
[2:06:27] desire but God he says by Grace by grace
[2:06:32] and election he says choose Abraham
[2:06:35] that's the way he chooses you nothing
[2:06:37] you have done he done it now remember
[2:06:40] Abraham and is
[2:06:44] seed not only Abraham but Abraham and
[2:06:48] the Sea am I speaking to Abraham see the
[2:06:52] morning so let me say I love this about
[2:06:55] God so God is intending to do something
[2:06:58] at the end time but before he can do it
[2:07:01] at the end time he has to have a type of
[2:07:03] which he can point to so he comes to
[2:07:06] Abraham and in is speak to it's not just
[2:07:09] Abraham he has a whole generation of
[2:07:11] people coming at the end time but before
[2:07:13] he can do it to them he has to have a
[2:07:16] place where he can show them in the
[2:07:17] scripture that this is what I'm
[2:07:19] promising you so he comes to Abraham he
[2:07:22] says nothing you have done you don't
[2:07:24] even deserve this I'm laying all of this
[2:07:27] down on me because he knew that in the
[2:07:30] end time there'll be a people show up
[2:07:32] that's going to need this so he comes
[2:07:34] and he does with
[2:07:36] Abraham and it doesn't end there it says
[2:07:39] Abraham end is see what is he doing
[2:07:45] giving you a way in so you can stand
[2:07:48] there and say I'm in that scripture I'm
[2:07:51] in that scripture that scripture
[2:07:53] belonged to me now I I was thinking
[2:07:56] about even what brother Andrew preached
[2:07:58] Wednesday we know we talk about Abraham
[2:08:00] Journey of Faith one way the Journey of
[2:08:03] Faith there's going to be doubt
[2:08:05] manifested somewhere because we have
[2:08:08] this flesh and as long as we have this
[2:08:10] flesh we're going to endure battles
[2:08:13] right so Abraham is told and and I'll
[2:08:16] just read it for a moment here don't go
[2:08:18] here don't do this he still does that
[2:08:20] did I cancel the grace of God no he
[2:08:26] didn't did God come and says well we got
[2:08:28] to clean up the board and come up with
[2:08:30] another plan no the plan was made he
[2:08:34] included every mistake you'll made
[2:08:36] everything that will happen the plan is
[2:08:39] what God Said God will do
[2:08:45] it the your your wondering is not the
[2:08:48] plan the plan is he who started the work
[2:08:51] will finish
[2:08:53] it the plan is I am God and I change not
[2:08:58] the plan is what I have spoken it's
[2:09:00] going to
[2:09:02] happen anything in between it doesn't
[2:09:06] matter whether you come this close to
[2:09:08] death in fact even if you die what did
[2:09:11] Abraham says he knew God told him to go
[2:09:14] offer Isaac now Abraham had this one
[2:09:16] thing he knew I couldn't produce Isaac I
[2:09:20] had gotten him from the dead my whole
[2:09:23] body was dead so God gave me Isaac from
[2:09:26] the dead so if God asked me to kill
[2:09:28] Isaac I believe that the same way I got
[2:09:31] I got Isaac from the dead God is able to
[2:09:34] raise him up
[2:09:41] again
[2:09:44] oh what whatam says this in the message
[2:09:48] of Grace paragraph 84
[2:09:52] oh I like
[2:09:58] this it
[2:10:00] says I'll call paragraph 85 I'm sorry
[2:10:05] I'll call another character let me just
[2:10:08] skip for The Taste sake of
[2:10:10] time it says oh brother Bram it says how
[2:10:14] Abraham tested God's
[2:10:18] patience is that sound familiar
[2:10:22] you know some of us would test each
[2:10:23] other's patience to the
[2:10:26] Limit you know I'm just
[2:10:31] saying oh how Abraham tested God's
[2:10:36] patience told them said Abraham stay
[2:10:40] here in the land don't you go out but as
[2:10:43] soon as famine came Abraham
[2:10:47] ran is that sound fam me
[2:10:53] God
[2:10:54] said I'll give you a job and I want you
[2:10:56] to come to church and I want you to come
[2:10:58] and do this and do this and as soon as
[2:11:02] the money is not enough another job is
[2:11:06] calling we start
[2:11:10] considering as soon as something happen
[2:11:13] we jump right out listen to this it says
[2:11:16] at paragraph 86 it says Abraham spoke of
[2:11:19] us God took Abraham by grace and saved
[2:11:23] him and that's how he takes you by Grace
[2:11:26] he says and how we test his
[2:11:30] patience today we are wrapped up today
[2:11:35] we are up tomorrow we are down one day

[2:11:56] it it says but yet in the midst of all
[2:12:00] of that God wants us to stay
[2:12:05] put all God is asking and says Don't Run
[2:12:08] Away don't don't I don't want you to
[2:12:10] think I'm not seeing what's happening I
[2:12:13] I I see I'm I'm the creator of Heaven
[2:12:15] and Earth he says he knows how many how

[2:12:50] of God will all be
[2:12:53] done sure God Saves Us by his grace
[2:12:57] Abraham was supposed to stay in the land
[2:13:00] but went down into the into the calans
[2:13:03] or or in the Philistine went down and
[2:13:05] and sojourned and got out and got out of
[2:13:09] the famine thing and his the things was
[2:13:11] a little hard up in this country and he
[2:13:14] went down there and so turned down uh
[2:13:16] with him done exactly what God told him
[2:13:19] not to do but yet the grace the the
[2:13:21] grace of God appeared to him and kept
[2:13:24] Pharaoh or the king from taking his wife
[2:13:27] Grace it says it says when God said uh
[2:13:30] when when Abraham said it's my sister
[2:13:32] lied about it and yet the grace of God
[2:13:35] held
[2:13:36] him because he repented and he was
[2:13:39] willing to repent but mam says this and
[2:13:42] anybody that's willing to repent the
[2:13:46] grace of God still goes on to you the
[2:13:50] grace of God is searching for you so
[2:13:53] that so that goes with you backslider
[2:13:56] this morning the grace of God is still
[2:13:59] looking for you if you just repent God's
[2:14:02] grace is
[2:14:05] sufficient Grace God is not run out of
[2:14:08] Grace oh my brother my sister we look at
[2:14:11] situation God is not like a man you know
[2:14:14] I can come to brother say give me $1,000
[2:14:17] give me give me another thousand he'll
[2:14:19] come to a time and say brother I I I
[2:14:21] only have so much you know I I can only
[2:14:23] help you so much but the grace of God is
[2:14:26] not so God who Infinite in Mercy his
[2:14:30] Mercy never runs out why because his
[2:14:33] Mercy is for a purpose so if the mercy
[2:14:37] cannot fulfill the purpose then what is
[2:14:39] the mercy for the mercy is so that no
[2:14:42] matter what you're going to make
[2:14:45] it no matter what happened the objective
[2:14:50] is going to happen
[2:14:52] happen aren't you thankful for his Mercy
[2:14:54] this
[2:14:55] morning oh I I I'm just let me just skip
[2:15:00] to the end now but when I'm talks about
[2:15:02] the mercy that is to be revealed in the
[2:15:05] end time oh my brother my sister and and
[2:15:08] he reads the scripture if you ever go
[2:15:10] listen to the message message of Grace
[2:15:13] he reads the scripture in Zachariah 4
[2:15:16] and I'll just read a couple of verses
[2:15:18] for the sake of time um Zechariah 4
[2:15:21] verse six it says and and this is the
[2:15:24] word of the Lord unto zerubabel and I've
[2:15:27] spoken on it a little bit but I'll just
[2:15:30] summarize it for the sake of time
[2:15:32] perhaps another day we'll just focus on
[2:15:33] this scripture it's a very wonderful
[2:15:36] scripture so we understand this was the
[2:15:38] time of the building of the temple we
[2:15:41] understand that Nehemiah had built the
[2:15:42] walls but it was it was zerubabel who
[2:15:45] was supposed to build the temple and Bam
[2:15:48] talks about how it was zerubabel who lay
[2:15:50] this was I believe the story the history
[2:15:53] says that the temple that zerubabel
[2:15:55] built was a different one because the
[2:15:57] one that Solomon had build was taken
[2:15:59] down so he laid the foundation and they
[2:16:02] said this Temple was a little bit uh
[2:16:04] smaller than the original so he comes
[2:16:07] and he lay the foundation and and if you
[2:16:09] know the story of Jeremiah you know that
[2:16:11] there was opposition from left and right
[2:16:14] there was opposition from all the
[2:16:15] neighbors because they didn't want them
[2:16:17] to build to build either the walls or
[2:16:19] the restoration of the temple so now the
[2:16:23] word of God is coming and and and and
[2:16:26] the purpose of that word to come was so
[2:16:28] he can Comfort them to tell them that
[2:16:31] I'm with you you continue to build you
[2:16:33] continue to do this because I'm with you
[2:16:35] you're doing my work and I'm going to
[2:16:37] protect you so it says that and and then
[2:16:39] he answered and spoke unto me say this
[2:16:42] is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel
[2:16:44] so God is sending his word and his
[2:16:47] message of Grace andto zabel uh trying
[2:16:50] to confront him in the season that he
[2:16:52] was going in to tell him that you you
[2:16:55] this work is going to be completed by
[2:16:57] your hands is wanting him to know that
[2:17:00] no I I know there's opposition there's
[2:17:03] all kinds of things happening but the
[2:17:06] the hands of zerubabel that started the
[2:17:08] foundation the hands of zerubabel will
[2:17:11] lay forth the the the The Headstone but
[2:17:15] says it wasn't the the the Capstone but
[2:17:17] it was The Headstone so he says he will
[2:17:19] come and he will lay the the the the the
[2:17:22] the the headstone he says the same hands
[2:17:24] that did it so now this is the word of
[2:17:27] of the Lord unto zorobabel saying this
[2:17:30] is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel
[2:17:32] it says not by might nor by power but by
[2:17:35] the spirit of the Lord of H he says who
[2:17:38] are thou oh great Mountain before zerel
[2:17:42] that shall be that shall become a plane
[2:17:45] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[2:17:47] it says therefore shouting with a shout
[2:17:50] crying Grace Grace unto you the word of
[2:17:54] God in the end time that will lay forth
[2:17:56] the Cornerstone that will lay for The
[2:17:59] Headstone it's not going to be by Mighty
[2:18:01] tunders or by Mighty works it's going to
[2:18:04] be a tiny man of Kentucky a man that
[2:18:07] looks like no one a man that couldn't
[2:18:09] even speak and is not going to be a man
[2:18:12] with some great honor or whatever it's
[2:18:14] going to be with such Grace that if you
[2:18:17] don't pay attention you're going to miss
[2:18:18] it
[2:18:20] the word of the Lord the same God who
[2:18:23] lay the foundation stone the same hands
[2:18:26] the same hand will finish it and then he
[2:18:28] said the word of the Lord come unto me
[2:18:30] saying the hands of zerubabel has laid
[2:18:33] the foundation of this house and the
[2:18:35] hands will will complete it it says then
[2:18:39] you will know then you will know that
[2:18:42] the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you
[2:18:45] so let me say this the message of God in
[2:18:47] the end time is only by grace
[2:18:51] let me say this because remember he says
[2:18:54] without Divine love we cannot get to the
[2:18:56] other side let me say this without Grace
[2:18:59] we couldn't make
[2:19:02] it but what says this it
[2:19:05] says paragraph 56 it says but according
[2:19:09] to the prophecy of message of Grace
[2:19:12] there will come a
[2:19:14] headstone it says and I want you to
[2:19:16] notice when The Headstone comes
[2:19:21] the prince that's going to cry out Grace
[2:19:24] Grace for it's by the grace of God we
[2:19:27] are saved not of your works that any man
[2:19:30] should boast and the message of Grace is
[2:19:33] being tramped under the feets of men
[2:19:36] until it becomes
[2:19:37] disgrace some of them Runs Out in
[2:19:40] internal security and some runs into all
[2:19:43] the everything but the true message of
[2:19:47] Grace Remains the Same
[2:19:52] amen the true message of Grace Remains
[2:19:57] the Same what is the message of Grace
[2:20:00] Luke
[2:20:01] 17:30 what is the message of Grace
[2:20:04] Revelation 10:7 what is the message of
[2:20:06] Grace that unto you I will send Elijah
[2:20:10] the prophet according to the scripture
[2:20:13] God still has
[2:20:16] Grace I don't care what you're going
[2:20:18] through this morning there's still the
[2:20:20] grace of God in the house of God in the
[2:20:24] people of
[2:20:26] God you know people try to conform
[2:20:29] people and and all you care about is how
[2:20:31] the person dress and if they're dressed
[2:20:33] like a message believer then that's it
[2:20:35] no what we need is the grace to change
[2:20:37] the hearts the grace to bring conversion
[2:20:41] the grace to fill the hearts with love
[2:20:44] the grace to change the nature of man
[2:20:47] that's
[2:20:49] right it says
[2:20:51] it says it's still the same and it says
[2:20:54] and that's where Satan tries to knock it
[2:20:56] out from the church but it's the grace
[2:20:58] of God we are all saved by oh my and I
[2:21:02] begin to think butam says in paragraph
[2:21:05] 130 of the same message it says
[2:21:07] Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign
[2:21:11] One Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign
[2:21:15] One Sovereign Grace from The Sovereign
[2:21:18] One Sovereign he says what can he do
[2:21:21] Sovereign it says Sovereign can do can
[2:21:24] do whatever he wants to
[2:21:29] do he says listen now Sovereign Grace
[2:21:33] can only be given by one that's
[2:21:37] Sovereign and God is Sovereign so he can
[2:21:42] give Sovereign Grace therefore being
[2:21:46] Sovereign Grace don't have to ask
[2:21:49] anybody
[2:21:52] think about it God comes and says oh
[2:21:54] Christian Life Tabernacle who do you
[2:21:56] want God to save
[2:21:59] today man we're going to exal one
[2:22:02] another like crazy
[2:22:05] oh this
[2:22:08] one God didn't ask you who he should
[2:22:13] say so if God saved the person next to
[2:22:16] you all you could do is love
[2:22:19] them because it wasn't you choosing to
[2:22:21] begin
[2:22:25] with you know people look at other
[2:22:27] people or not I'm not talking about

[2:22:33] way you know who are you to decide it's
[2:22:37] the Sovereign Grace Of The Sovereign God

[2:22:43] of it is just oh thank God that's why we
[2:22:47] said when we get over there it's going
[2:22:50] to be the glory of the let me say this
[2:22:52] there's going to be a lot of shock
[2:22:54] running across as
[2:22:57] a I can't wait to be on the other all of
[2:23:00] our mouths will be
[2:23:04] open why is a marvelous God he takes the
[2:23:07] rank sinner the one that you didn't give
[2:23:10] a chance the one that everybody wrote
[2:23:12] off the one that everybody thought would
[2:23:14] make it Grace comes by the way Grace
[2:23:17] brings him in the
[2:23:19] Kingdom it's not your choosing it's
[2:23:22] God's
[2:23:24] choosing I'll tell you it's going to be
[2:23:27] the glory of the grace it's going to be
[2:23:30] how powerful this Grace was to save a
[2:23:34] rich like me one who didn't deserve to
[2:23:36] be in a Congregation of saints one who
[2:23:39] feel like has seen himself away God
[2:23:42] takes him and says it's not by your
[2:23:44] works but my grace is made
[2:23:48] sufficient oh let me just say this butam
[2:23:51] says this now at the end time he says
[2:23:55] this this lady is called Lady Grace now
[2:23:59] I say this it's the glory of the grace
[2:24:02] that is to be revealed at the end time

[2:24:12] saying that there was no grow no grace
[2:24:14] extended like he be there at the end
[2:24:16] time this is the this is if I can say
[2:24:19] it's the guy gaing up together of all
[2:24:22] that God was trying to do and it comes
[2:24:24] at the end time and he says who is she
[2:24:27] he says she's
[2:24:28] predestinated elected Lady

[2:25:47] from the word elected lady
[2:25:51] one lady among all the other ladies was
[2:25:58] elected I'm just
[2:26:00] thankful how this I I can't comprehend
[2:26:04] this with my human mind I have no
[2:26:06] capacity to put this together all I do
[2:26:09] is rejoice in what God has already
[2:26:12] done he says like the Virgin Mary was to
[2:26:16] BR to bring forth the body of the Lord
[2:26:19] of of the of God on Earth and then she
[2:26:22] was elected woman God chose
[2:26:26] Mary it says and also God God has a
[2:26:30] chosen elected lady which is the bride
[2:26:34] she's elected and I hope you are member
[2:26:37] of that tonight it said tonight across
[2:26:39] the world Across the Nation he continues
[2:26:42] on the illustration here showing the
[2:26:45] relationship of of the Bride to Christ
[2:26:49] the elect lady
[2:26:50] it says how she was to be brought to him
[2:26:54] where it says she would come from and
[2:26:57] how that she would be brought to him the
[2:27:00] church here is the illustration it says
[2:27:03] that we got to we got we got in view is
[2:27:07] illustration by a woman which a woman is
[2:27:09] the type of the church because the
[2:27:12] church is considered a bride a bride
[2:27:15] she's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:27:19] the son of of
[2:27:21] God let me just say this he comes in
[2:27:25] such a age and a Darkness age that we
[2:27:28] are living in yeah we are in but says
[2:27:33] Darkness upon the Earth and gross
[2:27:35] Darkness upon the people the only age
[2:27:39] where Satan is called the God of this
[2:27:41] evil age no Darkness like this age he
[2:27:45] comes here and God that's where he
[2:27:48] chooses to call his
[2:27:51] bride what
[2:27:55] Grace he comes in the midst and and time
[2:27:58] like this where he it it it seems
[2:28:01] impossible where it seems like there's
[2:28:03] no way anything good could come out of
[2:28:05] it God said The more sin
[2:28:09] abound the more Grace will abound God
[2:28:13] said well this situation is just so
[2:28:16] perfect for me to show what the
[2:28:18] extension of myig gr can really do God
[2:28:21] comes and says now this is and let me
[2:28:23] say this this morning it doesn't matter
[2:28:25] how Darkness you are living in how the
[2:28:28] situation is worse in your life and let
[2:28:30] me say this the more darker it gets the
[2:28:33] more God can
[2:28:36] doall the worse he gets the more he's
[2:28:39] there to do why because that's his
[2:28:42] election that's what he promised you
[2:28:44] will do here it comes in the paragraph
[2:28:46] 229 of the invisible Union it says how
[2:28:49] can you come to this he says we were
[2:28:52] deceived and he talks about we were
[2:28:55] deceived we were deceived he says by our
[2:28:58] first marriage to come by the adulterous
[2:29:01] parent it was no fault of our own by the
[2:29:03] nature of birth you come as Eve came and
[2:29:06] you committed adultery that's the reason
[2:29:08] we are born in adultery you are a sinner
[2:29:11] to begin with it says that's right you
[2:29:13] was deceive into it you had he says you
[2:29:17] you it
[2:29:18] was it end your fault it says you never
[2:29:21] did it because that little germ that was
[2:29:25] in you was to be you before the
[2:29:27] foundation of the world God put your
[2:29:30] name in the Lamb's Book of
[2:29:35] Life what Grace somebody tell me how to
[2:29:38] explain this
[2:29:42] Grace there's no beginning to it there's
[2:29:46] no ending to it it's all God stretching
[2:29:50] himself doing all that he can for the
[2:29:54] elected one if the musician could come
[2:30:45] says that the mother
[2:30:47] Eagle knew that she had an
[2:30:55] somewhere and as far as the little iglet
[2:30:58] was
[2:30:59] concerned they had no understanding all
[2:31:02] they knew was they were born in the
[2:31:05] chicken yard and all the desires
[2:31:09] everything they looked at and it was
[2:31:12] nothing but Chicken Scratch in the
[2:31:15] barnyard all they could do is scratch
[2:31:18] and scratch
[2:31:20] but yet the mother
[2:31:22] Eagle
[2:31:24] knew that they had an egg somewhere and
[2:31:27] the prophet said that every evening
[2:31:29] every night the mother Eagle will just
[2:31:32] fly around be looking be looking be
[2:31:36] searching be
[2:31:39] looking and he said and one
[2:31:42] day this Eagle that was in the chicken
[2:31:44] scratch
[2:31:46] and it says so one day the mother knew
[2:31:49] that she had lay two eggs and she had
[2:31:52] begin to hunt that one flying around and
[2:31:55] searching like that great Holy
[2:31:58] Spirit it says one day he flew over the
[2:32:01] Barnyard he calls it the
[2:32:06] denomination she looked down there and
[2:32:09] seen her
[2:32:12] baby God's children she
[2:32:16] screamed and it was a voice and some
[2:32:19] Echo
[2:32:21] from inside of him something Echo from
[2:32:23] inside of
[2:32:25] him that sound that sounds
[2:32:29] right let a real predestinated bone germ
[2:32:33] predestinated of God hear the word of
[2:32:36] God it's music to
[2:32:40] him what is that that's
[2:32:43] Grace how is it that I hear this word
[2:32:45] and something within my heart says I
[2:32:47] believe it I love it how is it that I
[2:32:50] hear it and and it echoes the sound just
[2:32:54] expands my heart and and my heart just
[2:32:57] beats and I hear it there's just a
[2:32:59] impulse of faith in my heart to say I
[2:33:02] believe every bit of
[2:33:04] it it's
[2:33:07] Grace it's truth it says he knows it's
[2:33:10] the truth he says we tried of all we
[2:33:15] tried of all that denomination stuff
[2:33:18] anyhow to join and come and go with us
[2:33:21] and go with us and we got in the social
[2:33:24] parties and we got this and and did that
[2:33:27] that that sounded right but that was
[2:33:30] that that didn't sound right to the
[2:33:32] little fellow she said Son you don't
[2:33:35] belong in that group anyhow you belong
[2:33:39] to me you are mine and let me say this
[2:33:43] this the word of God to you this morning
[2:33:46] in whatever circumstance you are in the
[2:33:49] word of God to you this morning is you
[2:33:51] don't belong in there get out the word
[2:33:54] of God to you when he came to laia
[2:33:57] church H he says come out from amongst
[2:33:59] them ye my people the word of God when
[2:34:02] it sounds to your heart is calling you
[2:34:04] out of your sins and calling you out of
[2:34:06] the things of the world and calling you
[2:34:08] out of the habits of the world why is
[2:34:10] telling you you don't belong in there to
[2:34:13] begin with you don't belong in there
[2:34:15] come out what is doing that it's the
[2:34:17] grace of God that's doing it
[2:34:22] am and the scripture says when you hear
[2:34:25] his voice do not Harden your heart let's
[2:34:29] open our hearts this morning and say
[2:34:32] father I hear your word you know I
[2:34:34] thought about the woman that was caught
[2:34:36] in adultery they the came and and they
[2:34:39] brought him she was caught in adultery
[2:34:41] so there was no defense you couldn't
[2:34:44] argue what happened they she was brought
[2:34:47] before Jesus and they came in the lay
[2:34:50] there and to him and in fact they said
[2:34:54] it was so they can see what he's going
[2:34:55] to do and he looks at him and they came
[2:34:58] and they all looking there each one with
[2:35:00] the stone waiting to see what they're
[2:35:02] going to do waiting to for them to bring
[2:35:05] judgment upon her and say that you
[2:35:07] deserve to die so they look and all
[2:35:09] gather and and the scripture says that
[2:35:11] Jesus was writing down and and just
[2:35:14] writing and writing and so he looks at
[2:35:16] them and he says that so let's he who
[2:35:19] without through the first
[2:35:22] stone and the message started to Echo in
[2:35:24] the hearts of people and one by one they
[2:35:27] dropped the stone and walked away when
[2:35:30] Grace speaks everything else shuts
[2:35:33] up when Grace speaks the Judgment
[2:35:37] disappear when Grace speaks everything
[2:35:40] goes away why because Grace has the
[2:35:43] ability to take sins and turn it into
[2:35:47] righteousness Grace has the ability to
[2:35:49] take the wrong works and bring it into
[2:35:51] the work of righteousness Grace has the
[2:35:54] ability to take the wrong Sinner and
[2:35:56] make them a Believer so he looks at him
[2:35:59] and and then Jesus looks at the woman
[2:36:00] and says woman where are thy accuser she
[2:36:04] looks at him and says there's nobody to
[2:36:06] accuse it says they all gone away
[2:36:08] there's nobody to judge me here but only
[2:36:11] you what you say now they forget that
[2:36:13] when he came he said I came to the Lost
[2:36:16] ship of Israel the work of God or the
[2:36:19] message of God is for the purpose of
[2:36:22] restoration the word of God is not
[2:36:24] saying to destroy you or send you to
[2:36:27] Hell butam says that hell was made for
[2:36:29] the devil and his Angel it was not made
[2:36:32] for men men goes there because they
[2:36:35] don't want to receive Grace so he looks
[2:36:37] at there and he speaks and he says
[2:36:40] neither will I it says Go On th way and
[2:36:44] sin no more and that's what the message
[2:36:46] of the hour done to us it says go on the
[2:36:49] way and sin no more receive the grace of
[2:36:52] God this morning let's all stand oh if
[2:36:55] we can receive the grace this morning if
[2:36:57] we can open our hearts to the grace
[2:36:59] that's been extended God's grace to you
[2:37:03] is the message of the
[2:37:06] hour so you don't have to continue in
[2:37:09] the things that you are called in so you
[2:37:11] could be changed to be a true son and a
[2:37:15] daughter to God how many wants his grace
[2:37:18] this morning let's just lift our hands
[2:37:20] to him and pray to him just open your
[2:37:22] mouth and thank him for your his grace
[2:37:24] and and ask him if you could just pull
[2:37:26] his grace and to you and to the person
[2:37:29] sitting next to you and said our
[2:37:31] gracious father we're so thankful to be
[2:37:33] gathered in your house Lord and father

[2:37:38] deserve your grace and but Lord you in
[2:37:40] the same time you open up Grace and you
[2:37:43] done something for us that we couldn't
[2:37:45] do for ourself and Lord we just want to
[2:37:47] open our hearts and say come by our way
