Description:
The Morning After: Choosing A Husband
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Service: December 26, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

morning [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] to come open our service in prayer and have our psalm reading pray each one of you had a good christmas amen you know many times the way people might spend their christmas might vary drastically some maybe have many families some not much family some might have been alone but if you have jesus christ you have everything and so we're just thankful that for this time of year where we can just celebrate the the greatest gift that man has ever known as the lord jesus christ we're just thankful for each one that's been able to come where the mic will just ask you to come at this time for the song let's go ahead and pray father we are so grateful to you for your hand upon each of us lord for lord every need is met lord for your faithfulness to come by our way lord to speak to our hearts to direct our steps to heal our sicknesses to provide our needs lord to show us your words to make yourself known unto us lord we have everything to be grateful for and we just thank you for another opportunity to gather together lord to hear from you to learn of you at your feet to worship you to fellowship one with another to strengthen one another to be strengthened by you we want to be careful to commit this service to you that your will would be done lord that whatever purpose you have for today in your word with your people lord that you would be free to move deal with hearts meet needs make yourself known may this service be done according to your word as we commit it to you we thank you we look to you and we pray these things in jesus name amen good morning and merry christmas it uh you know it's worth noting that the closer you get to the end of the book of psalms the more it the more it becomes about praising the lord in fact the last five chapters of the book of psalms are all about praising the lord all five chapters begin and end with the statement praise ye the lord of the 130 times in the psalms that it speaks of praise 20 percent is in these last five chapters just all about praising the lord so it's interesting that the closer that it gets to the end the more it becomes about praising him you know we tend to think of praise as something we do in church when there's a worship service when a song touches our heart when you know the spirit is moving when the lord comes and deals with our specific need when he meets us in our hour or when we see him or when we hear from him we tend to praise that's that's our reaction and that's good but you know many times there's another level of praise than just us responding to his move in our life you know there's there's a purpose for praise it says in psalm 34 and verse 1 it says i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth continuously non-stop praise hebrews 13 15 says something similar by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually you know there's that word again continuously constantly nonstop praise you know what does that even look like you know certainly we can envision what it's like when we praise the lord when the lord does something for us or when the spirit is moving but to be constantly continually praising the lord does that mean to constantly walk around saying praise the lord whether you feel like it or not is that what it means to constantly continuously praise the lord we're going to read psalm 146 this morning verse 2 makes this statement while i live will i praise the lord i will sing praises unto my god while i have any being you know more than just a response our response our praise to the spirit moving meeting our need this speaks of a life of praise while i live there will be praise going forth out of my life while i have any being at all my very existence will be praised unto the lord you know this is us becoming his praise us becoming praise unto the lord you know ephesians 1 has several verses about this verse 5 says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved this isn't about us praising him because of something that he has done for our need or in a worship service this is about him positioning us in such a way that we can become praise unto his glory something totally different than our little attempt at praise how can we offer praise that accurately reflects him only he can take a vessel and make them something that praises him appropriately it says in verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory again not about us praising him for something he's done for us but him making us something that can appropriately praise him that can reflect him continuous praise not something we do in a worship service though that's fine certainly would praise him and worship him when the lord moves or when the word goes forth but we can't produce what praise for him should reflect only he can do that with our lives something that's reflected in us when he takes us positions us and reflects himself in us that we might be a living epistle right of all men our life praises him psalm 146 while i yet live will i praise him you know as we go through these chapters about what praise looks like there's little clues about how we can live how we can praise while we live how we can be in continuous praise it says in verse 3 of psalm 146 put not your trust in princes powerful influential men nor in the son of man in any flesh not even in yourself in whom there is no help you know continuous praise can't happen unless you get your eyes off of the leading of the flesh the leading of man following where they would have you go listening to those voices not going down the roads reflecting the images they would have you reflect you can't even begin to live a life of praise to be in continuous praise so long as that is what you're following after it says in verse in fact it says in verse 9 the way of the wicked he turneth upside down do we not live in an upside down age amen but it says in verse 5 happy is he that hath the god of jacob for his help whose hope is in the lord his god continuous praise can't happen until first you set aside all those other leadings all those other voices even your own flesh and put your hope totally in the hands of the lord that he might make you lead you direct you as he sees fit then you can begin to reflect something then you can begin to become that continuous praise that he's looking for it causes our lives to utter something to reflect something that's an image of him so if you want to know what continuous praise looks like while i live will i praise him psalm 146 gives us a little bit of a clue of what that looks like i don't know about you but there's i want to make sure that the praise that i offer him is something that reflects him and not my little attempt at reacting to something that he has done for me and the only way that can happen is by committing myself completely into him as my hope not any princes not any son of man but him alone so as we read psalm 146 this morning you know what greater praise could any of us offer than to be put in his hands and let him make us the image that reflects himself that while we live we will praise him let's read psalm 146 together praise ye the lord praise the lord o my soul while i live will i praise the lord i will sing praises unto my god while i have any being put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man in whom there is no help his breath goeth forth he returneth to his earth in that very day his thoughts perish happy is he that hath the god of jacob for his help whose hope is in the lord his god which made heaven and earth the sea and all that therein is which keepeth truth forever which executed the judgment for the oppressed which giveth food to the hungry the lord loses the prisoners the lord openeth the eyes of the blind the lord raiseth them that are bowed down the lord loveth the righteous the lord preserveth the strangers he relieveth the fatherless and widowed but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down the lord shall reign forever even thy god o zion unto all generations praise ye the lord the r amen let's just sing that song beautiful star of bethlehem fitting for the season amen you may have your seats and beautiful star of bethlehem we have seen his star and we have come to worship him amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] it was my life [Music]

pray [Music] it's a beautiful day amen and so i'd like to make an announcement this morning thank you musicians it's a a wonderful uh hour that we're live in and aren't uh aren't you grateful for it amen and so uh there's one extremely uh blessed uh gentleman with us this morning and i don't know what he must have done to deserve such a blessing and but i just can't use any other word but blessed so i will make this announcement brother tim and sister melinda seiler would like to announce the engagement of their daughter jenna to benjamin shelley are you guys here [Applause] did benjamin make it this morning well you tell him what i said and i'll tell you exactly what i told andrew tell him i'm watching him and uh but congratulations i i'll tell you he's very blessed jenna uh we've always appreciated you and are so uh grateful now this morning's message doesn't have anything to do with my announcement but we are going to be reading out a choosing of a bride so i felt a little funny when i was reading all the quotes and i thought well you know but i didn't plan it that way and they didn't plan it that way so god's got a lot of things that marvelous a lot of people asked me with our last service did i know there was nine candles there and i didn't that was just all inspiration i just didn't know and in fact i was shocked and even more shocking i was shocked i got all nine of them in there i certainly hope as you we will read that the natural types the spiritual and uh that's our desire is in it certainly have all those gifts that god gave us his spirit is a gift to us you know and um to think that those i was amazed when i thought about that scripture when it said against such there is no law you know there's a lot of things you can't do you just can't walk into any place that you want to right you can't drive as fast as you want to um there's everything that is regulated you know you in fact your body can't even eat as much as you want to you know i've sat there were as full as a tick i couldn't get one more ounce of food in me and the law was i'm filled up but it looks so good and i just want one more taste i mean there's laws that govern things but these gifts any place anytime anywhere and they'll do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what we could even begin to ask or thank we're going to minister a little bit this morning i guess if i would i would have a title i would call it the morning after the morning after this is the morning after christmas and i'm sure that there's all kinds of different thoughts going through our heads the things we've got the things that we have to make decisions about i had to make some decisions whether certain things fit or not you know or whether i liked them or not and and how to do it and so we're we're talking this morning on the morning after and kind of as a subtitle we're reading from the message called choosing a bride but really from our standpoint it's choosing a husband choosing a husband that we don't realize that i could also had many quotes that i wanted to read out of leadership what brother branham talks about uh how that we're led and and what choices we have to make so let's stand in our morning and take our bibles and let's turn over to first kings or uh let's read joshua this morning first and then we'll sit down and read that later um and this is joshua the 24th chapter and the 14th verse joshua 24 and 4 24 and 14 we'll be reading from this morning it says now therefore fear the lord what's the beginning of wisdom fear of the lord amen and and we hope we can maybe tie that in a little bit if the lord would lead us that way now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it seem evil un to you to serve the lord choose ye this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whoms land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord amen god bless you this morning may be seated you know this being the morning after christmas i began to sit back and and begin to think of how many morning afters there were in the scripture some of the morning afters were great and some of them not so great i always wondered what it must have felt the morning after adam made his choice and found him outside the garden you know that morning after must have dwelled in his mind and as he thought over his decision and i'm sure that there must have been in his heart maybe regrets you know that but he knew he had to go on you know and and i i believe that that must have been a hard morning after because he reflected back on the decision that he'd made and he knew that he couldn't change it now he knew that the discipline he had made he had made and and and we don't want to reflect on all the reasons he made that decision and how that god was going to allow his plan to unfold but i want to reflect more on the human side the the the uh the emotions that and the struggles and uh the dwelling and the pondering that goes on within us so much we go through sometimes seasons of it before that we can recover and accept the things that the way they are and set our course you know i always loved the definition that our messenger gave us when he said that correction is not punishment it's to adjust the course in which that you're going to travel many times you know will finally break down you know men aren't very good at taking directions i'm sure all of you wives realize that by now but you know we will open something up and we'll look at it and try to start putting it together before we decide to read the instructions and then when we finally sit down and read the instructions the instructions correct us and therefore we have to change our course or the direction that we're going in or many times we have to go back to the step that we uh so geniusly left out so you know correction is never punishment the punishment usually comes as the result of the choice the mental suffering the emotional suffering uh the regret you know sometimes i believe that regret is a terrible punishment to sit back and to realize that that there's nothing you can do to redo and and that's one great uh struggle that we all have in life is that we can't redo a lot of the things that we've done and that's important because you don't need to look back on those things you don't need to look back on the on on those things but uh i i think of these uh morning afters and and how that these individuals must have looked back on what they had uh just done and and they're they're stuck in that place of of uh pondering it and uh uh the great what if and or could have been you know i i think those are words that because of calvary that we don't have to have in our vocabulary anymore you know and because you can't change a lot of things but god can change things for us that that's what's wonderful you know i i there's i could if i ever started looking back at the choices i've made and the things that i've said and all that i how my life could have been what i thought it might have been in everything you'll end up into a vast realm of confusion and and i that's what's so beautiful about the blood and about the wonderful thing that the lord jesus did for us at calvary because he took all our regrets and all our things and he threw him in the sea of god's forgetfulness to be remembered no more you know i read in when brother branham was speaking in a message that he preached he called it experiences and he was talking about a time that he was going through a great time in his life and he was uh traveling with brother bosworth at that time brother brosworth was in his seventies and and uh he uh and he preached divine healing uh before brother branham preached divine healing and and i'd like to say this right here is that you know the word of god doesn't require us to to bestow any greater honor on a prophet than that which god bestowed and a prophet is a prophet because god made him to be a prophet and he had something that he wanted to bring to that prophet and say through that prophet and and a lot of times people uh they stumble i i was surprised how many people stumbled because they found out that charles larkin laid down the history of the church ages you know and and and they they have they have such a misconception of what a prophet is they have such a misunderstanding and brother brahma he he he expresses it right out he said i studied many men i took their truths i studied scofield you know and some things he had right and some things he didn't and people are are stumbled because brother branham used uh many of the teachings that men had on the pyramids before he came along all the truths about the pyramid are factual mathematical historical truths you know and and and when we preach and the inspiration comes thoughts come into our mind things that we've heard things that we've read we don't sit back and say uh such and such said this on the the the sermon you you know many times how many knows who said we don't know what tomorrow holds but we know who holds tomorrow who said that who's the first guy to say that am i going to research and research and research and come up with who the original person was that said it right and every time i want to express that thought that i have to lay a footnote down and said nostradami said that or sir savio dolly those are our all great demon possessed people you know you don't you know what i'm saying so when you're in the inspiration that's the historical side of it is is not the message of it so when brother brown saw the church ages he saw the church ages he knew he could his revelation was the two spirits coming up through the framework of the church right and that's what he was showing us in our day is the history of the two spirits working through the framework of the church because there's two spirits working in the framework of the church we saw here in the reading in joshua there was two spirits working in the framework of the church and and and there there had to be a decision made and so he he he used the he used many of the things that larkman says because they were true [Music] he took many of the teachings on justification that came out from martin luther because they were truth wesley spoke truth there's a lot of people that speak truth and it's truth i've heard like we talked at the young people there's a lot of people that are inspired they have a gift they write songs that inspire you you know i remember when i was in a valley one time and i that song came out i know the master of the sea you know that was like like david playing a psalm to me it comforted my spirit and so brother brown brought forth these uh the the history of of uh the the church ages and he used larkin's think but larkman didn't say that one was wesley and martin and all things he said i went and chose the messengers for each one of these ages and i i'm surprised that that people are moved by those things you know that they try to figure out how the cloud got there and and and and they go back and and what they can't understand is they get caught in the trap of reasoning nothing that god does reasons out with man the only thing when it's supernatural the only thing that it reasons out with with the believer is the seed that's in them and that's why the church is built on revelation and it's built on faith and faith is a revelation okay you know if not you'll get stumbled because now you're trying to put it together in your mind with your thinking and you become a god unto yourself so you choose basically uh something that's going to husband you know what husband tree is don't you husband tree is the nurturing and growing and feeding to bring forth a fruit so they choose what's going to nurture them what's going to give them husbandry what's going to develop them so like we're saying this morning choosing a husband you you choose what is going to influence you and what is going to lead you and that's why there was statements that i was going to read out of leadership because decisions lead you every decision has a morning after every decision if i could say this has a result it's got a morning after you know i've told many people don't do it and for the next 50 minutes them explained to me why they're going to do it and i say really i've taken dreams that people have come to me with and line them up in the row showed them every dream which i believe was god and showed them which way it was pointing them and they just make a decision and they have a morning after well the morning after is not the end of your life it's the beginning of your restoration so brother branham was talking about how that on the field with brother bosworth brother bosworth could preach and pray for the sick and hold up and brother branham couldn't you've heard him tell the stories after four or five discernments that he would he would just be done and he couldn't hold up okay yes he was as we know it forced his body into a nervous breakdown because nervous breakdown is not the same thing as a mental breakdown you understand a nervous breakdown is when your nervous system is fatigued can you understand and you and it it just fatigued i don't believe brother random ever had a mental breakdown he was fatigued in his body and he wore his nervous system out and anybody that is spiritual is a nervous person because the weight of the choices you make weighs on you heavy uh in our little small congregation that we have and i'll tell you arc were blessed we really are we don't we i we don't have a lot of major problems i'm trusting there's no gossiping going on you know if you can tell it to somebody else you ought to be able to tell it to me and and our sisters you know and and uh i'm i'm just as plain as can be usually that's where the trouble is and and i know our african sisters and some of our cultures are a little more prone to share things and talk things and that's why i say that in in christ there's neither bond or free june or greek male or female american or african or anything because we're all christ and christ is god and we all come under the same absolute amen but sometimes we're prone to things but anyway so brother brahms going through this and he he just wore out he's he's nervously shot and he said i slipped out of the house and i didn't tell my loved ones but i was going out and i was contemplating on taking my life and then it meant he goes on to explain later about coming out of that inspiration and the thing he said when i finally got to it i got out there and i began to to pray about it and and everything connect he gives a great thing about what god's gift to him was that he had a gift but there was another gift that he had and that's what held them and and comforted them and later on of course we know at the losing of sharon rose that that same gift come and comfort them so we're talking about morning afters and i wonder what cain's morning after was after he had killed abel he had a chance to do something different but he had a morning after just think of the morning after the choice that he made in killing abel you say boy this sounds like a depressing message this don't sound very christmasy but truth is always a gift because what sets you free the truth sets you free truth is freedom if you will look truth in the eye it will speak back to you yes sir amen and then you come to the place of decision think of in the days of noah the morning after the first raindrop fell and for the first time it had rained for 24 hours and the water was this tall and they looked around how many you think ran over to bass pro shop and bought boats they hewed out everything they could hew out they built rafts because it just might have been a possibility that that old kook in that floating farmhouse over there was right think of the morning after what i think what might even be more striking is the morning before because it was before the morning choice that gave them the morning after that they're having the morning after always comes from the day before because sometimes we're stuck with the morning after because we didn't do due diligence on the day before just think of moses the morning after the death angel passed through the land i i love that scene in the ten commandments where ramesses finally comes back and he sits on the throne and his wife chides them because he claimed to be a god and they believe their pharaohs are god and he had claimed to be the god he was sitting there his nation was ripped out from under him egypt was never to rise again it was over and he sat there and he makes this great statement moses is god is god amen he went to all his gods and his gods couldn't do nothing and finally he come to that great place in his life he said moses is god is god but look at all the opportunities that he had had the day before so that he wouldn't have had to had that morning after think of uh of uh the children of egypt children of israel that day you know a lot of people had to make a choice not every israelite came out but also many egyptians came out because it was the morning after something that god had done and the morning after brought a new set of choices do you understand that this morning the day before caused the condition caused the morning after but the morning after left a new set of choices like those leopards that were there can then they say why sit here we and die let's go out you know if it came when they got there the whole camp was gone they they became some of the richest men in all of uh israel look you know why why sit we here and so the the we we look at that we look at him at mount sinai the morning after moses came down from the mountain oh that golden calf didn't look so good all of a sudden i love again work it says moses is shining and they they got him shining they said moses has seen god just think it was the day before that caused the morning after but they didn't have to stay there did they moses drew the law the the the line in the sand and now they couldn't do nothing about where they'd been or what they'd been through but now lied before them a choice of path and we know how that it lies before let's turn in our scriptures if we could over the kings we're going to read in the 18th chapter and the 20th verse but in the 17th chapter there's a story of a little lady and her son and there was great famine in the land and the day before she had finally taken all the meal and oil left but for one cake so the day before created the morning after and what lied before her was i'm gonna go eat this cake and i'm gonna lay down me and my son and we're gonna die but you know something the morning after presented a new opportunity for a new direction because a voice rang out bring me something to eat can she had a choice and he said you bring me a cake and let me eat and the cruce won't run dry and the barrel won't run empty and she was stuck there with a a great decision a great choice to make now that choice was either you know that opportunity there was going to change what the morning after would be so there would have been a morning after of death or a morning after of life but the day before had only presented her with one and if she would have dwelled in that place in that mindset in that thinking but the morning brought her a new opportunity and that's what i love about the lord you may have had some bad morning afters but it's not the end of the matter and we read here and we know this great story the story of mount carmel so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel i stood on mount carmel and i looked over the valley i could imagine what it looked like and what the scene is and i i i thought they've got a great monastery up there you know the catholics have gone and claimed every spot but you know but they don't really know the spot right it's just that constantine's wife had dreams and they built all the all the sites based on the dreams and and and you go on on to mount dalgoth and there's a great big gigantic cathedral sits up there and they have a little altar built up over this little niche in the rock where they said they set the the crucifix in the cross in and they have this great altar there and the priests are there selling candles and then you light the candle i don't didn't like the candle i lit enough of my candles in fact i lit enough candles at one time for my whole lifetime so uh if you know my testimony to it so anyway and and so you they light this candle and they walk up and they put it in this little sand tub i think sister rebecca you've seen that haven't you there and and then they get down on their knees and they crawl over and they kiss this little plastic plate and then they they count and after about 25 30 people go they take those candles and they put them out and they start selling them again you know i just think of what a terrible end yes sir but we see what he says here he says and he gathered all the people together on mount carmel and elijah came unto all the people saying how long halt ye between two opinions but if baal but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word you know a halting between two opinions i think is one of the greatest definitions of being lukewarm doesn't settle it nothing settled when you're lukewarm sure i want to say that again nothing settled when you're lukewarm it's a terrible state to be in the lord despised that state so much that he said either be hot or cold in other words choose one opinion or the other but don't stay halted between two opinions if it's evil to you to serve god then choose the god of your fathers if it if it's righteous for you then serve the lord but look at these people and the people answered not a word what do you think their morning after was when the 400 prophets wailed and cut on themselves when everybody had bowed a knee think of all the morning after of all the people that bowed a knee to the religious system that was ruling the land in that day think of their morning after when the true word of god was vindicated i wouldn't have liked to been at that morning after the children of israel how do you think about the morning after katie sparnia two guys had a good morning after and their morning after wasn't the end of their journey they remained strong all the way until the end let's just take one more this morning of a morning after how about rahab what do you think her morning after was like she had the most expensive piece of real estate in all of jericho everything else was rubble think about her morning after now look at her day before she had a terrible day before but she made a decision and her decision changed her morning after because we know there's a law that you reap what you sow i just could imagine i mean you ever see where what her morning after led to who she married and who come from that seed that lineage seed oh wouldn't we just go into a great bible study of the type of the bride and eve and how the seed was passed down and all those ladies in the scriptures and what they typed see what morning after are you living in because her morning after was something else but every event transpired because of the choices that were taken i'd like to read to you the definition of choice brother graham says choice is an unwritten law in every human being sometimes we take predestination and we misunderstand it the footsteps of the righteous are led by the lord okay but the choice is made how many people have we seen that were led of the lord had great ministries and then that they are arrived at a question or a decision and the decision that they made change their day after so your day after may be blessed your day may after may be miserable but that doesn't mean it's the end of your choice here's what choice means an act of selecting or making a decision when faced with two or more possibilities and my dictionary has in parenthesis the choice between good and evil i thought are you kidding me i don't even know webster was a christian two possibilities your morning after holds two possibilities it holds the possibility of returning or going forward whether it's good or whether it's bad if you've made decisions that have caused you heartache that have messed your life up that were bad financial decisions or whatever you can stay right there and live in that or you might consider another possibility because my god says all things are possible yes sir and when brother brennan had to consider that possibility are you you think brother branham a prophet of god sat there and had to decide whether he was going to live or die i mean you wouldn't even think that he would be at such a place like that but he faced a morning after the morning after he had just prayed for the sick kim the devil was speaking to him and the depression that he went through you don't think the prophet of god didn't go through depression yeah he went through depression he went through a lot of depression it comes with the gift either choose the gift or chews a door but it comes with it and as for me and my house we'll serve god amen that brother ran through he said oh the depression was just caused by the gift he came to that understanding he says but i got another gift it's him and it's the gift of life oh i made a i remember one time that i i had an opportunity to cut a road in to a logging camp this was back in 1970 one i believe or two a lot of you weren't born there and it was gonna pay two thousand dollars and i could do it in one sunday and i remember i chose to make a decision i chose to go to church i've never had a pair of tires ever wear out since i'm not saying i hadn't changed them all right but i got 80 000 miles on 40 000 mile tires i put mitchum's on attack that lasted me three four five years i always credited that to that decision how so many things in my life had lasted longer than they were supposed to last well over any of the money i'd ever make i'm glad i didn't have the monday after that sunday but it's a it's a decision that you make and i want to just read because sometimes we we get to the place that we don't think we have to make decisions we just think well the the lord would have is it should have taken care of this and he should have taken care of that no it's who what are you going to choose to husband you you understand customers just not a companion to make children that's the most adult way that i can say it it's just going to nurture you who's going to give you well-being who's going to uh uh dig up the roots and after and and and uh fresh soil and and and and nutrients in there that it brings forth much fruit what what oh who you what are you gonna choose to uh and pick to mold your tomorrow because you have to have a today and a decision today in order to produce the results in the morning we read some stories of some awful mornings we could read a lot of stories of some wonderful mornings i wonder what the morning after lazarus coming from the grave was like i wonder what the morning after for that leopard that came back and fell at jesus feet and worshiped them all ten leopards had a mourning after the others went back and showed themselves to the priest and went back home clean they may have never testified of the lord that would not been a good morning after for me but it was still a morning after a good thing but that morning still gave them a choice and that one leopard's morning after brought him back to the feet of jesus and said lord thank you i always wondered if he was one of the ones in the upper room i put him there in my heart i looked at the boy that was healed when he was blind and he looks at me he says you being the fathers of israel and know not who healed me and jesus sought him out i always believed he was in the upper end i believe we can go to the upper room don't you but you've always got choices and that's what we're talking about this morning is choice you can make a choice and not have a morning after or you can make a choice the morning after to change your next morning after many hours i've spent on my knees repenting telling god i was sorry many at times i promised him i'd never do it again and find myself back at the same place at another morning after but at every morning after there's another morning coming and the decisions of that time will create the morning after and wouldn't you like to have morning after morning after morning after in him and wouldn't you want to know in your heart if you have a morning after that is full of regret and disappointment that that doesn't have to be your next morning after it doesn't have to be the morning after for the rest of your life that morning after does not have to be your husband all right thank you lord and if though any of you who have studied marriage in divorce you know it's exactly what the prophet taught he said that husband has got to die you can't let him be the one that's going to continually nurture your thoughts your spirit your experience your joy you can't let that morning after what do you think judas's morning after was like there's a song i like and it's called judas didn't know and in the words that song goes is that he would have forgiven him yes that's right that he loved him he would have received them and took him in again but judas didn't know his morning after led to him hanging himself because he was the son of perdition and he didn't believe that a morning after could exist that's greater than the morning he's in amen hallelujah i'm so glad that there's another morning coming in in my this life here and i'm so glad there's another morning coming amen yes sir oh that's the morning that we live for look what i i want to say if you say birmingham this sounds like a new year's message well this is the morning after christmas and the only thing that lies before you is a new year is tomorrow morning so it's the choices you make today that are going to produce that tomorrow morning that's why the prophet of god said don't let it pass you by i want to just read a little bit and we'll close because there's no service this evening there's no service wednesday night the next choice you have to make as far as i'm concerned is on new year's eve next sunday service is at also at 11 o'clock the choice is yours now choosing a bride i want to just read you a few statements now about choice the selection when faced in making a decision when faced with two or more possibilities choice is the decision made when facing two or more possibilities i've got two possibilities coming to me i can stay home or i can go to the service or i could go out and have dinner or i could go to the company party or i could do this or i could do that it's a decision it's a selection or a decision between two or more options wouldn't it be wonderful when we can get to the place that we narrow our options down to nothing other than the word of god not how i feel not what i'm going through but what the word of god said the decision to go forward despite how you feel despite your emotional makeup you know one of the hardest things for a preacher to do is stand at the post of his duty and preach the gospel when he's had a terrible day before and his morning after isn't so good he don't feel like preaching he knows he shouldn't be preaching he feels terrible he's condemned he just wants to run away from it all is miserable he doesn't he just looks at he's got a whole bucket load of excuses and that god says you can't use any of them my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in weakness and then you want to come do you want to come over here you're feeling terrible you're run down and you say well you know i can preach the people love me and okay and you know i'm pretty good and you know i've studied a long time and i know a lot of things that brother brown said on the tape and you can't use that either you're stuck right where brother branham was stuck he gave me a gift the blood if i meet him there he forgives me of all my unrighteousness i can have a new morning in him and when you walk out that door you leave and get yourself out of the way you get your miserable self out of the way you get your good self out of the way you get your gifts out of the way you get everything out of the way and you anchor yourself in one thing and one thing alone and that's god's eternal word heaven and earth will pass away but this word will not pass away you don't need no recognition you don't need no data boys you don't care if you get criticized you know one thing i've said what he said and it'll stand and it'll create for me a new morning praise the after if not you'll die you'll die oh i just i want to close but i i could go over into birth pains right now what he talked about the choice they all had to make between the two systems you know every day you're faced with two systems i don't know if i brought it yeah i did i'm going to read it anyway you don't have nothing to do but go open all the christmas gifts you couldn't open up yesterday because you got so many of them you know who had the christmas don't you walmart that's who had the christmas yeah yeah if you think that you think you had a christmas costco and walmart had real christmases of course you know what they got the morning after coming don't they when all that stuff that doesn't fit comes pouring back in and all the stuff that's broke just remember for every morning there's a morning after all right he said these men if they picked this and this is paragraph 175 in burke paints these men if they pick up this and it goes out with it they can make more sense of it see to bring it to a place you would i just want to lay this seed then hope they make it come to life he says in paragraph 74 it's always been that way that the reason she is bearing birth pains because there's a fight in her he's talking about the church right he's also talking about the individual there's a fight in you between the two husbands you understand that the husband of the old man the husband of your emotions the husband of your feelings the husbands of your regret the husbands of your consciousness but he made a choice in choosing a bride and he chose the miserable person that we are but the choice was his it was his choice of the place of worship it was his choice now we have a choice to choose what's going to rule over us the morning after or the morning that could come i choose the morning to come and i don't mean just tomorrow morning i mean the morning that's to come and i want everything that husbands my life every decision i make between two options to be made by the husband of my morning leave those things which are behind behind and press for the higher calling prophet of god said you cannot drive in a rear view mirror that's right yeah if we confess our sins he's just and faithful to forgive them when you compare your mourning against the blood your mourning loses every time because what he did for you that you could have a new morning surely out does what created the morning you're in there's always been the reason she's bearing birth pains because there's a fight in him there's an esau just a man of the world very religious and oh he's all right good fellow clean moral as far as i know of but he don't know nothing about that birthright think of his warning after when he sold his birthright think of jacob's morning after when he was a rat but he had the birthright oh hallelujah oh i love him the word must deliver that word bride church the word must deliver that word bright church if you're in a bad morning the word must deliver that word bride church where am i at all right he says inject and this is paragraph 146 and jacob i don't care what he is he wants that birthright he's the spiritual one he said and and then them to today is in the womb of the church there's a great big system trying to be formed called the world council of churches and from the womb of the church is coming forth to children it's just mark my word the world the word must deliver the word bright church the church has to be delivered out of her the bride for christ them that fell asleep in all ages will make up that bride that comes out on the word they that they come out on like from your feet coming forth to the head she it's a it gets greater and the more you have to have and so forth as the body grows up so does the body of christ grow up and then finally the head will come into it the head of it will now if you notice because it's all linked to the head the head does the turning pulling who's the head the husband what's pulling and turning you yesterday's failure your complex you don't like what you see in the mirror well there's a million doctors out there they'll stuff you with shots and everything you want and i'm not against it that's great to give you more self-confidence make you happy that's great but i couldn't even imagine myself without this big shnoj i got so used to looking at it the prophet of god said said think vice versa i just look in the mirror and say man it's a beautiful nose everybody's jealous that they don't got one like fun don't worry opinion's like a nose everybody has one the head of it will now if we notice because it's all linked together the head does the turning pulling but these systems will not grow out of that okay the systems will never grow out of the morning that they created oh i hope this is striking personal because we've got to decide now what we're going to be in the future what kind of person we're going to be what kind of church we're going to be what kind of dedication we're going to have because i the one thing that this virus did is it created a huge amount of lukewarm people and gave them an excuse and the word of god says he who chooses his life shall lose it but he who lays down his life shall save it you read into that whatever you want he says the systems can't grow out of that because it's a system and it cannot bring forth a cuckleburg cannot bring forth a bunch of wheat but they both in the same field watered by the same water and the same sunlight one is the word one is not the word and them two are fighting and they've been fighting since the first reformation and they're still fighting where did the first battle start it started in the mind they're still fighting the battle still going on but your mind does not create your tomorrow if you let the word create the tomorrow if we went through every prophecy that the seventh angel the angel of uh a messenger of malachi 4 5 the prophet of malachi 4 5 the the message of the 7th church age messenger the fulfillment of revelations 10 7 and all them scriptures were fulfilled in a chosen man called william mary and branham if we went through all the prophecies it would take us a year to get through them now i don't have to go any further on that you know what i'm talking about yes sir there we are there you are a system what system are you in what morning are you living in i don't care if you got drunk last night you don't have to remain a drunk i don't care if you smoked a cigarette you don't have to smoke another i don't care what you lusted at i don't care what you failed at i don't care you may have a terrible morning this morning because of your yesterday's choice but there's a system called the word of god that delivers people from bad mornings what system are you in are you in the system that's going to create another miserable tomorrow or are you going to create a new morning one morning at a time amen very good that's what he said take no thought of tomorrow the evil of today is sufficient thereof now let me lay the light on that is in the context of what we're talking about make the right choices today tomorrow will take care of itself it didn't say not to plan it didn't say not to plant your potatoes it didn't say not to make a life choice or a decision there's lots of choices in life but you don't have to let the evil that's with you on this morning create the next morning for you he said just imagine now if you had lived back in the other days under the jolt of god's prophets and words that come forth what side would you want to be on back there oh isn't that aren't these books wonderful these sermons they're so packed sometimes we just read them in one light and we don't understand that this is the i am the light that cometh down i am the bread that cometh down from heaven amen in the beginning was the word and the words with god and the word was the light of men the light of the morning the light of the new morning well you've got the same choice today she's fixing to bring port the perfect word back there and that word is coming forth the word bride a woman is part of the man taken from him so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the bible no systems no darkness nothing added to it it'll have to be in an unadulterated pure virgin word and let's close this morning and go go to choosing of the bride paragraph 31. so you say what are you telling us i'm telling you your choices can change your morning i know one thing that i've got to make a choice of and that's turn off the world turn off its politics turn off its thinking turn off all the stuff that bothers me because it eats me up and it makes me mad and people don't make godly decisions but i know there's one thing that i can let influence my day and it ain't that five dollars and 25 cents on the gas pump it's god promised he'd never let his children beg bread now what's gonna husband tree my thoughts it's all the devil all these people who thinks fox news is the angel of god sent down to save america you know what i mean yeah you know all that is is good cat cop bad cop the whole purpose of it was to throw you in jail one way or the other don't we've got an infallible unadulterated guide that if we could put this thinking in our thinking let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus you know what this message is it's the mind of god for the age we're living in amen end the story we there are many things of life we are given a choice the way of life itself is a choice we have a right to make our own way choose our own way that we want to live education is a choice we can choose whether we're going to be educated or whether we are not going to be educated that's a choice that we have right and wrong is a choice every man every woman boy and girl has to choose whether they're going to try to live right or not live right it's a choice choice is a great thing your eternal destination is a choice and maybe tonight some of you will make the choice of whether you'll spend eternity before this service ends tonight there will be one time that if you turn god down many time there will be one time you'll turn him down for the last time if you keep choosing the evil of your morning over the light of god's love and deliverance one morning you'll be trapped in that system he said it's a dangerous thing he said one one time you'll turn him down for the last time there is a line between mercy and judgment it's a dangerous thing for a man or a woman boy or girl to step across that line for there's no return when you step across that deadline so tonight it might be the time that many will make their decision where they will spend the endless eternity there's another choice we have to make in life that's a life companion a young man or woman stepping out on life has been given the right to make a choice the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject it but it's still a choice on both sides both man and woman they have the right to choose you you have a choice as a christian you have a choice of the church here in america so far that we can go to i don't like that so far that we can go to that's your own american privilege to choose any church you want to belong to that's a choice you don't have to go to any of them if you don't want to this is the first time in american history that americans have overwhelmingly chosen not to go to church there are more non-going church people in the united states than church-going people if you don't want to but if you want to change from the methodist to the baptist or the catholic to the protestant so forth there's nobody can tell you or make you come to any certain church that's our that's our freedom that's what our democracy is every man can choose for himself freedom of religion and that's a great thing god help us to keep it as long as we can we have a choice whether you choose this church you can choose whether it's this church whether you will choose a church that will guide you to your eternal destination you can choose a church that has a certain creed you might think that creed is just what you want or the other church has their creed and then there's the word of god you have a choice of you have to make the choice that's what god delights in so many times i hear that in brother mike's psalm reading god delights in the choices that you make that's how you worship him because he's your husband it's an unwritten law among us of choosing i believe it was elijah one time at mount carmel after the showdown to the great hour of the crisis we just about to come to right now perhaps it may be to you or i tonight that we make this choice like the mount carmel experience frankly i think it's going on worldwide now but there will soon be a time where that you'll have to make a choice and you men here your denominational churches just believe this that hour is right on you when you're going to make a choice you're either going to go into the world council of churches or you're not going into the to be a denomination anymore you're going to have to do that and that's the choice is coming soon he's bringing this choice to him but also we're talking about the choice you have to make for your individual life your spiritual being your spiritual atmosphere your spiritual food chain and what you want to create a union with which husband do you want and if you get the right husband in your individual life you'll get the right husband you're way ahead of me jeff you need to sit there and listen and give me time to get to where i'm going okay because that's i'm not talking about that carnal husband i'm talking about the one that's going to lead you tomorrow and feed you tomorrow and influence you tomorrow it's a dangerous thing to wait till that last hour two because you might take on something that you could never shake out of it now i'm applying that to what we're talking about you might take on something that you can never shake out of you'll take on a complex you'll take on a defeatist attitude you'll take on a failure attitude let's change our morning yes sir let's change our tomorrow morning this morning you won't be able to shake out of it you know there's a time when you can be warned then if you step across the line of warning then you already marked on the other side branded remember when the jubilee year come and the priest rode with his trumpet sounding that every slave could go free but if they refuse to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the temple to a post and an awl bore through the ear and then he served his master always it was put on his ear as a type of hearing faith cometh by hearing he heard that trumpet but he didn't want to listen to it oh my god don't accept that you may be in year one of the seven you may have six more years to go if the lord tarries till that trumpet's prone but never accept anything condition failure negativity never accept anything you got a past caused you to do things god can make it fresh and new i don't remember where i'm at or the jubilee year don't listen to it he says elijah paragraph 44 elijah gave them a choice what they should choose you this day whom ye shall serve if it god be god serve him but if it's baal be god serve him and as we see that all the natural things is a type of the spiritual thing as we went through in our lesson this morning as the son and his nature that was my first bible before i ever read a page in the bible i knew god because the bible is written everywhere in nature and it just corresponds with the word of god how the death burial and resurrection of nature the sun rising crossing setting dying rising again there's so many things that we could type god in nature that we have to bypass for this message now it's spiritual the natural types the spiritual then the choosing of the bride in the natural is a type of the choosing of the bride in the spiritual let's finish with paragraph 51 what i'm trying to emphasize this morning is choice people have got to the place they think predestination takes choice away and it doesn't and if we would study what we're doing when we're going to get married he's talking about marriage in this particular text but i believe i can take what he says here if we would study what we're doing when we're going to you can fill that blank in with everything sure when we choose our wife our husband if we study it over a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life remember the vow is until death do we part he could ruin his life by making the wrong choice but if we know knows what he's making the wrong choice and is marrying a woman and it's fit to be his wife he doesn't anymore then it's his fault if a woman takes a husband who knows that he's not fit to be a husband you know then it's your own fault after you know what's right and wrong so you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly prayed through the same applies to choosing a church now you must pray over the church that your fellowship in remember churches carry spirits now i don't want to be critical but i realize that i'm an old man and i've got to leave here one of these days and i've got to answer at the judgment day for what i say tonight or any other time and therefore i've got to be dead earnest and truly convicted we're not talking about marriage and divorce this morning we're not talking about choosing or not choosing a husband jenna has passed that threshold so you don't ever have to worry about those quotes ever again you know but some of you do have to to go through the process because we know the process brother tim and we're praying for the whole thing to go smooth but you've got a choice tomorrow you have a choice today of what your tomorrow is going to be are you going to choose him and let him guide you and help you out of your mourning you can make a terrible investment the stock market could crash you could lose all your money you have a choice of jumping out a window jumping off a bridge oh you don't think so sure go back and read the suicides on black friday people thought they lost everything but was it profit of the man if he gains the whole world and loses life god's gift to us is eternal life through christ jesus in other words if you're that seed and if you've made a bad morning he he's going to take you from that morning if you'll choose him to tape you choose a good morning good morning to you i really wonder what brother brennan meant when he stepped to the microphone and said good morning friends in other words you can change your morning many people didn't know they could rahab changed her morning noah changed his morning joshua and caleb changed their morning all kind daniel changed his morning you know it was one morning that put him in the lion's den but that same choice took him out of just think of of joseph he made a choice and it put him in prison but the same choice took him out of prison you don't have to remain in prison you don't have to be stuck that's a system it's a system that this world has developed to affect your emotions and your thinking i got notes written down here god of this evil age satan's eden wake up church the prophet of god said don't get caught in this age of reasoning don't get caught in satan convincing you that you cannot be delivered from a bad choice because there's a new day of coming there's a new morning at hand and i can have a new morning tomorrow i'm going to have a good day because it's good afternoon to you but let's have wonderful mornings let's stand together let us all take a look at our choices and in the morning after christmas when we just received and chose this as a memorial for the gift of jesus christ what are you going to do with what god gave you this morning i don't want to put it on a shelf but i want to take the isab that i might see i want to take gold trident fire and white raiment i want to choose to open the door this morning and let him come in and sup with me because i believe there's another morning coming soon and my choices on this morning are going to make that resurrection morning alive and then on the other side of that morning oh think of what that's going to be like running around like a young 20 year old fella greedy my sisters and my brothers and talking it over with paul and peter and say oh excuse me a moment brother i'm gonna run over and visit with moses [Music] oh and then we all go before our great husband and we'll lay down our crowns and worship him oh that sounds so beautiful to me this is a choosing of a husband a different morning after [Music] we honestly look at the message that god has given you and when you in your heart say i'm going to let this message this word this message that the lord jesus sent to me personally i'm going to let this message husband my life i'm going to be married to this word this is what i'm going to choose to make my morning and when i fail and the morning of failure comes i'm going to go back [Music] and say lord where can i go thou alone hath eternal life how do you think peter felt that morning when he denied the lord [Music] and the lord said do you love me peter [Music] feed my sheep and he asked him again [Music] and he asked him the third time and peter was grieved [Music] he could have run from his presence he could have hung his head in shame he could have just laid it all down and went back to the sea of galilee and got his boat but he said lord you know all things you know that i love you and the lord changed his mourning forever [Music] lord i pray this morning that you don't have to be in sin maybe just a little lukewarm maybe not sold out maybe being halted between two opinions this morning which is the definition of lukewarm maybe you have decisions that are laid out before you and you've got to choose i say choose him choose the word talk it over with them let them reveal to you life and life more abundant because that choice always makes for a beautiful morning and that choice will make for a resurrection morning one day so lord that's our desire maybe down in your heart this morning no service this evening you would like to lift your hand and say lord i'd like to rededicate my life i want to change some of the mornings i have [Music] i can't do it lord but what i'm choosing today is not to let yesterday guide me i'm not going to let yesterday be what's going to make my tomorrow but i'm going to lift my hands to you today and say lord you know i need healing i don't even know how to beg you anymore lord for deliverance all i can say is help my unbelief lord i'm so weak i can hardly give it up i can hardly keep my face out of the computer lord god i don't want to have that feeling that morning i want a new morning lord jesus i don't have to be stuck with that kind of mourning lord you can change my mornings you can put joy and peace and rest in the time of confusion i'm giving myself to you this morning i'm rededicating my life this morning i'm gonna make choices for the right kind of mourning and you just lift your heart and your hands to him this morning and say lord i'm i'm gonna have a different morning after from this morning forward i'm going to change my mornings this morning the morning after this morning is going to be a joyful day in my life i'm committing it to you jesus i'm committing my morning to you
