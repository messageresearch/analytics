[39:52] do scripture reading
[39:54] tonight we went into communion service
[39:57] we try not to
[39:58] try not going to be too long uh just to
[40:00] say a few words to
[40:04] comfort us i mean genesis chapter one
[40:09] we're going to read
[40:11] verse the second verse
[40:17] it says and the earth was without form
[40:20] and void
[40:21] and darkness was upon the face of the
[40:23] deep and the spirit of god
[40:25] moved upon the face of the waters
[40:29] amen let's also turn in luke chapter 4
[40:34] and verse 16.
[40:50] look the fourth chapter in verse
[40:53] 16.
[40:56] it says
[41:01] and he came to nazareth where he had
[41:04] he had been brought up and as his custom
[41:08] was
[41:09] he went into the synagogue on the
[41:11] sabbath day and he stood
[41:14] up for the read for to read
[41:17] and there was delivered unto him the
[41:20] book of the
[41:21] prophet isaiah and when he had opened
[41:23] the book
[41:24] he found the place where it was written
[41:26] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[41:29] because he has anointed me to preach the
[41:31] gospel to the poor
[41:33] he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[41:36] to preach deliverance to the captives
[41:39] and to
[41:40] recove and recovering of sight to the
[41:42] blind
[41:43] to set to set at liberty them that are
[41:46] bruised
[41:48] to preach the acceptable year of the
[41:50] lord and he closed the book and he began
[41:53] and and and he again
[41:56] and he gave it again to the minister and
[41:58] he sat down
[42:00] and the eyes of all of them
[42:03] in the synagogue were fastened on him
[42:06] that's just my head
[42:07] a gracious father we're so thankful to
[42:09] be gathered in your presence
[42:11] father your word is wonderful we love it
[42:14] lord we thank you for speaking to us
[42:16] this morning
[42:17] father now we just want to speak a
[42:18] little bit on what's on our heart
[42:20] and pray that you could just take it and
[42:22] multiply it
[42:24] lord you know that you know that you
[42:25] took the fish and you multiply it
[42:27] took the bread and multiply it we know
[42:30] that everything we laid in your hands
[42:31] father you have the ability to multiply
[42:34] therefore we pray father that you just
[42:36] take your word and speak
[42:38] to our hearts tonight because we have
[42:40] need of you we love you and ask these
[42:42] things in the name of jesus christ amen
[42:44] i have your seats just for a few moments
[42:48] i
[42:49] just stressed i could bring what's on my
[42:51] heart and
[42:53] this is really moved upon me on what our
[42:57] pastor preached
[42:58] this morning and perhaps as i go you'll
[43:00] see a lot of similarities and
[43:04] and i just trust that something could be
[43:06] said that could just go together with
[43:07] what was said this morning
[43:09] because i believe it's the word of god
[43:11] amen and
[43:12] so i want to just just for frame a
[43:15] reference i want to title this
[43:17] um in the uh the temple of the dynamic
[43:21] the temple of the dynamic and
[43:24] and almost for a subject as jesus said
[43:27] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[43:30] because he has anointed me
[43:33] in in you as we read this was in luke
[43:36] chapter four
[43:38] this is was right after he he was
[43:41] uh taken in the wilderness by the spirit
[43:43] of the lord after he was baptized and
[43:45] taken into wilderness to be tempted
[43:48] and after he was tempted and of the
[43:51] the the the devil for 40 uh
[43:54] when he was in the wilderness he came
[43:56] back this is after the temptation he
[43:57] comes
[43:58] and now he's beginning his ministry he's
[44:01] beginning to set
[44:02] and the first thing he comes and he
[44:04] tells them the spirit of the lord
[44:06] is upon me because he had anointed me so
[44:10] he
[44:11] he recognized that he was the anointed
[44:13] one of that time
[44:14] he comes to a place where he's actually
[44:17] recognizing that
[44:18] i have been anointed to do this and and
[44:21] and i'll say
[44:22] this just to begin that as we read in
[44:24] genesis chapter 1
[44:26] that god does the way that god brings
[44:29] his word to pass is by his spirit
[44:31] anointing is by his spirit moving is by
[44:34] spirit fulfilling something and and as
[44:38] we'll just look
[44:39] we'll go through the bible and begin to
[44:40] realize these things
[44:42] as it is written but random speaks in
[44:44] the message identify masterpiece of god
[44:47] it says
[44:48] now when he made adam that first man
[44:52] how perfect he was he looked uh he said
[44:55] he looked like god
[44:57] the great holy spirit brooding over the
[45:00] earth
[45:00] and the bird came out and then the
[45:03] animal
[45:04] different things it kept coming more
[45:07] in the form of one that was that that
[45:10] was brooding
[45:11] so it start with the bird and then it
[45:13] comes all the way
[45:14] into the form of the one who was
[45:16] actually doing the brooding
[45:18] and and so this is god in the beginning
[45:22] he it was his spirit that caused all of
[45:24] that to move
[45:25] and burton tells us that that that that
[45:28] it was the seed he was brooding over the
[45:30] sea that was already planted the seed
[45:32] was already under the water so as god is
[45:34] brooding it was the holy spirit
[45:36] bringing his word to come to pass what
[45:39] was spoken one time
[45:40] god is now bringing it to come to pass
[45:43] and the way he did it it was by his
[45:45] spirit moving
[45:46] and causing it to come to pass and so he
[45:49] continues on until he finally they came
[45:52] a a species just exactly like one that
[45:55] was doing the rooting
[45:56] god it says man was made in the image of
[45:59] god
[46:00] then he placed him in the great garden
[46:04] like michelangelo he placed his great
[46:08] life work and the great sculpture god
[46:11] placed
[46:12] his handiwork in the garden of eden made
[46:15] him a help meet
[46:16] a complete satisfaction it was
[46:19] what a complete satisfaction it was of
[46:22] god
[46:22] till even he rested it says it was just
[46:26] a rest
[46:27] his work had been finished so now he
[46:30] is showing us and it's important we
[46:33] begin to realize
[46:34] that it as the brooding is going forth
[46:38] is starting from something small until
[46:41] it comes into the image of the one
[46:43] that's doing
[46:44] the brooding the holy spirit within our
[46:46] lives
[46:47] as we receive it is to start from
[46:50] something small
[46:52] it's to start from a conviction is to
[46:54] start from a thirst in
[46:56] it to start from wherever we are from
[46:58] not liking the things of the world and
[47:01] and get away from where we are and move
[47:03] us into another place and
[47:05] but the the objective is not so we can
[47:07] stay
[47:08] in that condition uh and but branham
[47:10] says this will read it it says
[47:12] well the holy spirit was not given just
[47:15] so we can
[47:16] say we we're not like the world and and
[47:19] it's not given just so we can stop and
[47:21] say i don't drink i don't smoke i don't
[47:23] do this
[47:24] that's not the measure that god desired
[47:27] and our pastor said this morning that
[47:28] god wants to give us
[47:30] more and we just want to look up on the
[47:32] more that he wants to give us
[47:34] but the goal that god has in mind was so
[47:37] that the one
[47:38] who's doing the brooding could be
[47:40] manifested fully
[47:41] in the brooding of the sea that is
[47:43] brooding up that in the one that is
[47:46] bringing up will be nothing more
[47:48] than his representation into the image
[47:51] of the one that is brooding
[47:52] is trying to bring us back into the very
[47:55] image of god
[47:56] from the seed that we are he would
[47:58] brewed and brewed and brewed
[48:00] until we become any even in his very
[48:03] image
[48:03] david said in the in the psalms it says
[48:06] that
[48:06] that many comes to you and they they get
[48:09] what they want and
[48:10] you you feed the hungry it says there
[48:13] are many of you
[48:14] the people of the world it says the the
[48:16] sons you give them food and you give all
[48:18] of the things
[48:19] but it says as for i i want to stay in
[48:22] your presence
[48:23] until i become even like you reflecting
[48:26] the very desire that we see the prophet
[48:28] say here
[48:29] the one who's doing the brooding wants
[48:31] to see himself
[48:32] in the image of what is brooding in a
[48:35] message you must be born again it
[48:37] continues on it says now the holy spirit
[48:40] has never left the earth still on the
[48:43] earth he's talking about even today
[48:45] the holy spirit has never left the earth
[48:47] is still on the earth
[48:48] what is the holy spirit doing on the
[48:50] earth it says
[48:52] it's still on the earth it's still
[48:53] brooding over the earth
[48:55] coming on come unto me ye that are
[48:58] labored and have
[49:00] heavy heavy laden all you material
[49:04] that has been built in the image of god
[49:07] cooing calling and wooing
[49:10] what is it doing you we we here as the
[49:13] church and the body of christ
[49:15] representing the material of god
[49:18] that has been placed in this time and
[49:20] the holy spirit is here to take off that
[49:22] material
[49:23] and to bring it in the image of the one
[49:26] who's doing the brooding
[49:27] the body of christ was not given so he
[49:30] could be an
[49:30] image of something else it was given so
[49:33] he could be the very
[49:34] image of christ himself reflected within
[49:37] his body
[49:38] so he says now it continues on it says
[49:42] if the holy spirit is whose he says we
[49:45] come back right and say
[49:46] yes great god uh you you made me and i
[49:50] love you
[49:51] and you are my creator and i'm sinful
[49:53] i'm ashamed of it
[49:55] it says then he places in in me
[49:58] eternal life it says
[50:01] then if he gives me eternal life by
[50:04] answering
[50:05] by by answering back to his call
[50:08] and made me what i what i am without
[50:11] having a choice how much more can you
[50:14] raise me up
[50:16] after i've made my choice and been
[50:18] filled with the holy spirit
[50:19] the holy spirit is god's own life
[50:23] and you can no more lose that life than
[50:26] god can lose himself
[50:29] it's god's own life and he's trying to
[50:31] represent himself in you
[50:33] and the only way he does it is by spirit
[50:36] the only way he wants to do it is by his
[50:38] spirit
[50:39] moving upon the believer moving upon his
[50:42] seed so he can bring his seed
[50:44] into the very image of himself
[50:47] and then he says then if you give me
[50:49] eternal life
[50:50] by answering back it says and made me
[50:53] without
[50:54] be having my choice how much more you
[50:56] will raise me up
[50:57] if i've made my choice to fill me with
[50:59] the holy spirit the holy spirit is god's
[51:01] own life
[51:02] you can do more you can do no more that
[51:04] god can lose himself
[51:05] the word comes from the greek zoe
[51:08] and i it says i give unto you unto them
[51:12] eternal life so i begin to to think
[51:15] about just
[51:16] how in the scripture as the the
[51:19] scripture tells us
[51:21] about how many times we look in the old
[51:23] testament
[51:24] and we see examples of the spirit of god
[51:26] moving
[51:27] and and we know the prophet told us that
[51:29] there's no such thing as a holy man
[51:32] it's god the holy spirit in the man that
[51:34] makes a man
[51:35] holy there's no such thing as a holy
[51:37] church it's god
[51:38] in the church that makes it holy in
[51:41] other words it's always god
[51:42] doing everything and i began to think
[51:45] about samson the description that the
[51:47] prophet gave him and said
[51:49] it's not a man that you could have
[51:50] looked and attributed all the strength
[51:52] that he had and
[51:53] he seemed like it was a mama's boy or a
[51:55] a sister boy and one that was just
[51:59] a skinny one with long hair and things
[52:01] like that
[52:02] and and and and and the problem today is
[52:06] men's understanding or denominational
[52:08] the intellect of man
[52:09] has printed samsung into this great man
[52:12] and
[52:12] huge and talented and strong who was
[52:15] able to do all those things by himself
[52:17] but the prophet gives us a perfect
[52:19] description he says if you looked at him
[52:21] and the things that he did it never
[52:23] matched
[52:24] [Music]
[52:25] it never matched he looked at him and he
[52:28] said
[52:28] it was such a skinny boy and a zucchini
[52:31] man and
[52:32] but then when the spirit of the lord
[52:34] came upon him
[52:35] then he was to be able to do the things
[52:37] that he was doing
[52:38] when the spiritual of the law descended
[52:41] upon him
[52:41] that's when it took the the jawbone of a
[52:44] mural
[52:45] something that could have been broken up
[52:47] just by hitting anything
[52:49] and barbara says it will take that and
[52:51] hit the metals and after metals
[52:54] and kill a thousand philistine something
[52:56] that was supernatural
[52:58] something that you could not attribute
[53:00] it to the flesh
[53:02] and then when the spirit of the lord
[53:03] left him he became a man just like any
[53:06] other man
[53:08] you could look at him he was without
[53:10] strength without anything
[53:11] what did what he did it was the spirit
[53:13] of the lord
[53:14] moving upon him that caused him to do
[53:17] those things
[53:18] and i want to say this because it's
[53:19] important what we desire as a body of
[53:22] christ even as a herd
[53:24] i i don't believe we we live at any time
[53:27] where we need any more mechanics i
[53:30] believe we have enough mechanics
[53:32] they everything that the messenger told
[53:35] us about the word of god
[53:36] we know we've heard it and we'll believe
[53:39] it and we know all the things that he
[53:40] said
[53:41] what we need above all is the spirit of
[53:44] god
[53:44] to move upon that word and make it a
[53:47] reality for each and every one of us
[53:49] what we need is the manifestation the
[53:52] prophet tells us that god
[53:54] uh interpret his word by bringing it to
[53:56] pass
[53:57] in other words when you see the
[53:58] manifestation is the very
[54:01] interpretation of what was in god's mind
[54:04] about this word so what we need in order
[54:06] to have to see the interpretation
[54:08] is for the same spirit to move in
[54:11] genesis
[54:12] the same spirit that move upon samson
[54:14] the same spirit that moves upon david
[54:17] we need that same spirit to move upon us
[54:20] to bring us into a condition
[54:22] where we can manifest the word of god
[54:24] for our time
[54:27] we go too much after the mechanics and
[54:29] we're like oh i've never seen this
[54:31] before
[54:32] oh i love this and this is wonderful and
[54:34] that's good
[54:35] but don't stop there you move until
[54:38] the lord will move his spirit so you can
[54:41] say like jesus tonight
[54:42] and say the spirit of the lord is upon
[54:45] me because he has anointed me
[54:47] to bring up this word and to live this
[54:50] world to manifest it to bring it to pass
[54:53] i am the manifestation of the word of
[54:55] god for this generation
[55:00] and and and the the mechanics will not
[55:03] do it
[55:03] it takes the dynamic to bring us into
[55:06] that place
[55:07] that's why we need to kick out the trash
[55:09] and we need to pray more
[55:11] we need to forgive more we need to have
[55:13] the love of god within our hearts
[55:15] we need all those things why because
[55:17] those things are moving us
[55:19] from the mechanics into the dynamics of
[55:22] the world
[55:23] that's been promised if it's clogged up
[55:25] there's no way we can get to the mecha
[55:27] to the dynamic all we'll have is the
[55:30] mechanic
[55:31] and i feel like sometimes we're so happy
[55:33] with the mechanics that we have
[55:35] because we can see this we can see this
[55:37] but let's not stop there
[55:39] let's move to a place where god will
[55:41] take that mechanic
[55:42] and bring the dynamics to bring it to
[55:44] pass
[55:46] i'll pass you away this morning how that
[55:49] god that we can go into hospitals and
[55:51] touch the people and raise them in and
[55:54] i'm not talking about
[55:55] just going to do all kinds of miracles
[55:57] i'm talking about being led by the
[55:59] spirit of god
[56:00] where god places on upon your heart you
[56:03] have love for somebody
[56:04] and you can't stand there to watch them
[56:07] suffer
[56:07] and you call upon the name of the lord
[56:09] and he moves upon your heart to god do
[56:12] and you do according as he's shown you
[56:14] that's the time that we're living in
[56:18] so when yeah he he moved and
[56:22] and he came and he moved upon david and
[56:25] david believed he was anointed
[56:28] and and i'll say this even for the
[56:31] prophet that came and anointed him
[56:34] he didn't look like he was the guy for
[56:36] the job
[56:39] they came and they brought one after
[56:41] another and the scripture says he looked
[56:43] and said
[56:44] it's got to be that one it wasn't
[56:47] the second one came in yeah you know if
[56:50] he wasn't that one it could be that one
[56:52] it wasn't not until his
[56:55] all the sons came by and the prophet
[56:58] came there and he said if god spoke to
[57:00] me
[57:00] there's got to be somebody they were at
[57:03] the place where they just wanted anybody
[57:06] is there anybody else left it says well
[57:09] there's one who's
[57:10] over there and he's watching after the
[57:13] sheep and everything he said go call him
[57:15] at this point we just need somebody
[57:18] i tell you it's not our presentation or
[57:21] ability to do
[57:22] anything it's not our strength or by our
[57:25] might
[57:25] why we have to come into the realization
[57:28] is if god can use a mule
[57:30] if god can speak to a donkey if god can
[57:33] do those things
[57:34] that god can use you oftentimes because
[57:38] our order is we always at the very
[57:40] bottom and that's okay
[57:42] even at the very bottom god is able to
[57:44] use you
[57:45] so he can bring his word to come to pass
[57:48] david showed up
[57:51] and it wasn't exciting when it showed up
[57:54] and the lights and the sky open
[57:56] it just came up and they looked at him
[57:59] they said well
[58:01] we're going to try and as they did
[58:04] the glory of the lord manifested they
[58:07] knew it was him
[58:08] but what happened afterwards he went
[58:11] back doing what he was doing
[58:13] he went right back he didn't go back
[58:15] over there
[58:16] and no wonder perhaps he was asking
[58:18] himself i've just been anointed king
[58:21] but i'm still a shepherd here i'm still
[58:23] watching after sheep
[58:25] i should be at least to have one of my
[58:27] older brother come watch and say because
[58:29] i'm the king
[58:30] no he went exactly back to where god
[58:33] placed him
[58:34] why because he knew that he has been
[58:37] anointed
[58:38] he knew that wherever god would place
[58:40] him
[58:41] god wanted him to be there he was
[58:43] satisfied not by what was outside
[58:46] but what was done within his heart we
[58:48] need to come to a place where
[58:50] it's not the outside that satisfies us
[58:52] what satisfies us is the presence of the
[58:54] lord within our heart
[58:56] is when we get to a place where god is
[58:58] me to me
[58:59] that's why i'm here god has done this
[59:02] for me that's why i'm doing what i'm
[59:03] doing
[59:04] so he comes in and he knew he was the
[59:07] king
[59:09] and there was one day he got told to
[59:12] just take food to his brother that was
[59:14] at war
[59:14] and there he comes in he's bringing food
[59:17] to his brothers and
[59:18] they stuck over there and all of them
[59:20] scared of this goliath
[59:22] and the whole kingdom the whole military
[59:25] might and all the trained people and all
[59:27] of them just sitting there
[59:28] wondering what's going to happen and how
[59:30] there was just the last day and all of
[59:32] him just come to realize
[59:34] that we we just there's no way we
[59:36] confess this person
[59:37] and he showed up and the anointing began
[59:40] to work
[59:41] and the anointing began to work and i
[59:43] want to say this
[59:45] god will lead you in a situation where
[59:48] that anointing will come upon you for
[59:50] you to act
[59:51] it's not given so we can just go and say
[59:53] i'm anointed i'm anointed i'm anointed
[59:56] but when a situation arise
[59:58] something within you will tell you this
[1:00:00] is the time that you need to take
[1:00:02] control
[1:00:02] this is what you've been anointed for
[1:00:05] and you've been anointed for you to
[1:00:07] bring forth the word of god
[1:00:08] and he stood up and he said i have been
[1:00:10] made king
[1:00:12] he remembered what happened that day and
[1:00:15] he knew that
[1:00:16] in the position that god gave him that
[1:00:18] it was
[1:00:19] absolutely impossible for him to die
[1:00:22] unless he was sitting on the throne
[1:00:28] so he says because he has anointed me
[1:00:34] but one of them speaks about moses he
[1:00:37] says that moses was born a proper child
[1:00:41] and and and i want to use this because
[1:00:44] this is such a type of us
[1:00:46] even today um he grew up and they told
[1:00:50] him about
[1:00:51] how he was born and and how that they
[1:00:54] put him in a
[1:00:55] a a in a basket and they they they put
[1:00:58] him up on water and
[1:01:00] and all the things that has happened to
[1:01:01] him so all of those things and
[1:01:03] prabhupada says that everything that i
[1:01:06] told him
[1:01:07] it drew the picture for him in other
[1:01:10] words his parents told him about his
[1:01:12] birth and
[1:01:13] and how he was a proper child and how
[1:01:15] that he was saved and
[1:01:16] how that he was born for a certain
[1:01:18] purpose all of those things
[1:01:20] were the mechanics that was laid out
[1:01:22] before him and
[1:01:24] we we also realized that he tried to act
[1:01:26] upon that mechanic and he failed
[1:01:30] amen and the prophet tells us that
[1:01:33] when we see the things that we see today
[1:01:36] we see the world in the condition that
[1:01:38] we see today
[1:01:39] we we we have been given an eyesight
[1:01:42] for us to see the reveal word of the
[1:01:44] hour
[1:01:46] we've been called we heard our name
[1:01:49] we don't believe this message
[1:01:50] intellectually something within our
[1:01:52] hearts
[1:01:53] is responding to this message so
[1:01:56] all the mechanics are in place we could
[1:01:59] say
[1:01:59] but that's not enough it takes the
[1:02:02] dynamic to come
[1:02:03] off the word that we have believed so he
[1:02:06] can bring
[1:02:06] all of the promises just like he did in
[1:02:09] the beginning
[1:02:10] in other words it takes the dynamic to
[1:02:12] come and
[1:02:13] quicken every promise that has been uh
[1:02:16] uh a lot of for us for this generation
[1:02:19] that's how we come into it
[1:02:22] it's not a uh well you know we and i can
[1:02:25] say this
[1:02:25] uh we've we've seen our salvation in it
[1:02:28] that's wonderful
[1:02:29] we've received deliverance for it that's
[1:02:32] wonderful
[1:02:32] but that's not it that's not the end of
[1:02:34] it we've seen the healing from it that's
[1:02:37] not the end of it
[1:02:38] remember pravanam says that this uh uh
[1:02:41] uh seven seals or this quickening power
[1:02:44] that comes at the end time
[1:02:46] is to take us from where we are and to
[1:02:49] bring us
[1:02:49] into rupturing faith so we're going to
[1:02:52] go from here
[1:02:53] to there by quickening every single
[1:02:56] promise
[1:02:57] along the way the holy spirit quickening
[1:03:00] it to us
[1:03:01] so we can get into that condition
[1:03:06] what is in the messages it is
[1:03:09] it is the rising of the sun it says
[1:03:13] it says if the spirit that raised christ
[1:03:16] from the dead
[1:03:18] the word the dynamic
[1:03:21] it says the word the dynamic
[1:03:24] of the word dwells in you it will also
[1:03:27] quicken your mortal body
[1:03:30] now it says now how we flesh
[1:03:34] uh how now are we flesh of his flesh and
[1:03:38] bone of his born
[1:03:39] because because quickly he says
[1:03:42] because quickly while we are here mortal
[1:03:45] uh
[1:03:45] sinners and mortal ready to die
[1:03:49] these bodies it's quick and it's
[1:03:52] quickened
[1:03:52] that body what what's quicken
[1:03:56] bring to life the spirit that once
[1:03:59] liked to drink run around commit
[1:04:02] adultery
[1:04:03] and these things it's quickened why the
[1:04:06] thing
[1:04:06] died and you are resurrected you are
[1:04:09] resurrected
[1:04:10] it quickened your body it continues on
[1:04:13] and it says therefore
[1:04:15] your body is the temple of the dynamic
[1:04:19] your body is the temple of your dynamic
[1:04:23] and that's what i want to speak on
[1:04:24] tonight
[1:04:25] i want to say this my brother my sister
[1:04:27] we were not made for us to be sinners
[1:04:30] we were not made for us to remain in the
[1:04:33] things of the world
[1:04:34] god didn't create us so we could be just
[1:04:37] like the world
[1:04:38] he created and he chose a special group
[1:04:40] of people
[1:04:41] so his dynamic could come and manifest
[1:04:43] themselves
[1:04:44] in their bodies and and and we have to
[1:04:47] believe that
[1:04:48] we have to come to a place where we come
[1:04:50] to the realization
[1:04:51] that i have been made to be the temple
[1:04:54] for the dynamic
[1:04:55] it says why because why
[1:04:58] from the beginning you are part of the
[1:05:01] mechanic
[1:05:03] you were made part of the mechanic and i
[1:05:06] want to say this
[1:05:07] when we see our our election where we
[1:05:10] see
[1:05:11] how it's brought us together we see what
[1:05:13] is taking us from sin and all those
[1:05:15] things
[1:05:16] if we see how it saved us how we
[1:05:18] sanctify us how is
[1:05:20] what it's done for us so far we say we
[1:05:22] take all the things that he's done for
[1:05:24] all but it says we are able to draw the
[1:05:27] picture together
[1:05:29] and be able to see that there's
[1:05:31] something at work
[1:05:32] god has been doing something it's opened
[1:05:35] my eyes to see something
[1:05:37] it's done something for me and i'm not
[1:05:39] what i used to be
[1:05:40] the desires have been taken off and all
[1:05:42] those things why
[1:05:44] he's making you a temple for his dynamic
[1:05:48] and then he says that's part of the
[1:05:50] mechanic and
[1:05:51] they and they there's your resurrection
[1:05:55] they there is in the church
[1:05:58] there is there's the church in the
[1:06:00] resurrection
[1:06:01] with him these bodies right now
[1:06:04] are quickened you've you've heard you
[1:06:07] believe
[1:06:08] it change you from denomination unto the
[1:06:11] word
[1:06:12] and i want to say this it's the
[1:06:14] resurrection
[1:06:15] power that begins the very rapture
[1:06:18] within your heart
[1:06:19] yes the rapture begins by the new birth
[1:06:23] why because it's taking you as we said
[1:06:25] in genesis
[1:06:27] is coming to that little sea that was in
[1:06:30] the
[1:06:30] uh in the ground and it begins to
[1:06:33] quicken it
[1:06:34] he's quickening it his quickening is
[1:06:36] quickening
[1:06:37] what what is he quickening unto is
[1:06:39] quickening
[1:06:40] unto so you can become in the very image
[1:06:43] of who he is
[1:06:44] so you can see yourself the same as he
[1:06:47] is
[1:06:48] what was the purpose of quickening power
[1:06:52] it's not so we could just say i've
[1:06:54] received quickening power
[1:06:56] and i don't love the world anymore the
[1:06:58] quickening powers come to you
[1:07:00] so it can manifest the works of jesus
[1:07:02] christ in you
[1:07:07] so he speaks on and he says
[1:07:12] he says the dynamic it comes upon
[1:07:15] it says the dynamic if it comes upon the
[1:07:18] water
[1:07:20] it will just splatter the days of
[1:07:23] miracles
[1:07:24] are passed pom pom pom and i believe the
[1:07:26] bible pom pom pom
[1:07:28] but that's just no problem he says
[1:07:32] but when he hits a thousand octane
[1:07:36] it says zoom away she goes see
[1:07:40] you see how it says the dynamics strike
[1:07:43] that
[1:07:44] but if it strikes a chicken it won't do
[1:07:47] no good
[1:07:48] because there's nothing to quicken
[1:07:51] there's nothing to quicken in the
[1:07:53] chicken
[1:07:54] it says but when it strikes an ego it
[1:07:56] moves out
[1:07:57] amen the dynamic with a mechanic
[1:08:00] see what i mean that's it it's the if
[1:08:03] the true ego
[1:08:05] uh it says if it is the true ego
[1:08:08] he will understand so he says
[1:08:12] let me say something to the uniting time
[1:08:16] to see the church united nations united
[1:08:20] the uniting time of god and his bride
[1:08:23] too it says i say this with reverence
[1:08:26] and respect
[1:08:27] i believe that the bride of christ is
[1:08:29] called
[1:08:30] i believe she's sealed into the kingdom
[1:08:32] and i believe the mechanics are there
[1:08:35] now i want you to again to to come to
[1:08:38] the realization
[1:08:39] of what the prophet is laying out as the
[1:08:42] mechanic
[1:08:43] i believe that she's called i believe
[1:08:45] that she's still
[1:08:46] i believe the mechanics are there and
[1:08:49] then he says
[1:08:50] the mechanics are there it says they are
[1:08:52] waiting for the dynamic that will take
[1:08:55] her off the earth
[1:08:56] into glory in the rapture i believe that
[1:08:59] it will i believe that with all my heart
[1:09:01] yes sir we don't know
[1:09:03] how it will it was going to do but he
[1:09:06] shall do it
[1:09:07] he is the dynamic we just become members
[1:09:11] of of the of the machine of his body
[1:09:15] forming ourselves into the image and see
[1:09:18] him unite himself with us
[1:09:20] and his work and his love gift
[1:09:23] and and his and and his
[1:09:26] hands and he hands them to us just
[1:09:30] before the wedding supper
[1:09:31] we are waiting and watching for that the
[1:09:34] dynamic
[1:09:34] of the church will be the revealing of
[1:09:37] the holy spirit
[1:09:39] that the holy spirit that we have to
[1:09:42] work
[1:09:42] that it that we have worked in a small
[1:09:46] measure
[1:09:46] while we are while there is the
[1:09:49] headstone coming down to unite with a
[1:09:51] body
[1:09:52] but when the head and the body unites
[1:09:54] together
[1:09:55] the power of the full of the power
[1:09:59] the full power of the holy ghost will
[1:10:01] rise
[1:10:02] up exactly like that even from even the
[1:10:05] dead
[1:10:06] that's dead in christ 400 years
[1:10:09] or ago will rise in the beautiful
[1:10:13] or in the beauty of his holiness and
[1:10:16] take flight into the sky
[1:10:17] the dynamic is the holy spirit now i i
[1:10:21] just want to say this
[1:10:22] the the the mechanics part of it is
[1:10:26] our our place of us to play
[1:10:29] is the pushing that we have to do it's
[1:10:32] the best thing that we have to do
[1:10:34] is the repentance that we have to repent
[1:10:36] is the moving out of the things of the
[1:10:38] world
[1:10:39] it's by desiring the right things it's
[1:10:41] by applying the token
[1:10:43] is by forgiving one another it's by
[1:10:45] moving
[1:10:46] into the things that he has allow us to
[1:10:48] do
[1:10:49] that's the mechanic part of it because
[1:10:51] god will not come to a place where
[1:10:53] there's condemnation
[1:10:54] so he wants us to move out of
[1:10:56] condemnation he move on to move out of
[1:10:59] uh fussing and and fighting and all
[1:11:01] those things
[1:11:02] where we can get into the unity no
[1:11:04] wonder why the prophets say often and
[1:11:06] often he says
[1:11:07] oh if we can come under one mind under
[1:11:10] one accord
[1:11:11] he says there will not be a sick person
[1:11:14] in our midst in the next minute
[1:11:16] why because it's the unity that breaks
[1:11:19] the dynamic to come and work in the body
[1:11:24] it's the unity that brings the dynamic
[1:11:26] to work in the body
[1:11:29] in the message the anointed one uh i'm
[1:11:32] sorry perfect faith he says
[1:11:35] watch now he has appeared to us
[1:11:38] the same in the same form as it did to
[1:11:41] them
[1:11:41] in the old testament and in the same as
[1:11:45] in the new testament as is shown
[1:11:48] by the same word the same christ and i
[1:11:52] declare to you
[1:11:53] that christ is the holy ghost the word
[1:11:56] christ means the anointed just as the
[1:11:59] person is anointed
[1:12:01] just that it says that's the person
[1:12:04] that's anointed
[1:12:05] that is christ the anointed one how many
[1:12:08] knows that's the truth
[1:12:10] he says anointed one there is to be a
[1:12:12] man that would be anointed anointed with
[1:12:14] what
[1:12:15] the bible says in acts chapter 2 that
[1:12:18] jesus and nazareth the man of proof of
[1:12:20] god anointed with the holy spirit
[1:12:22] went about it and done great works and
[1:12:24] things
[1:12:26] that god manifested and proved he was he
[1:12:28] was this man
[1:12:30] and then he continues on he says and now
[1:12:33] we
[1:12:33] we become anointed with the same spirit
[1:12:36] anointed messiahs after last day
[1:12:40] to shine forth the resurrection of jesus
[1:12:43] christ
[1:12:44] to show that he is not dead but is in
[1:12:47] the form of the holy ghost
[1:12:49] is in his people moving among his bride
[1:12:53] with a love afraid to her pouring out
[1:12:56] into her himself they are becoming one
[1:13:00] with
[1:13:00] for the wedding supper and the same
[1:13:03] signs and promised
[1:13:04] by the same god and the same word is
[1:13:07] making
[1:13:08] his same manifestation there is nothing
[1:13:12] left for us to do
[1:13:13] but to believe but to believe it
[1:13:17] and believe it is the substance
[1:13:20] that creates a perfect faith
[1:13:26] it's the substance that creates perfect
[1:13:28] faith
[1:13:29] when we believe in this union when we
[1:13:32] come to a place where we know that we
[1:13:33] are anointed
[1:13:34] when we come to a place where we begin
[1:13:36] to manifest we let this
[1:13:39] dynamics come upon this temple that we
[1:13:41] are
[1:13:42] the scripture says that don't you know
[1:13:44] that your body is the temple of the holy
[1:13:46] spirit
[1:13:47] what is it it's god anointing you so you
[1:13:50] can move into it
[1:13:51] and i want to say this oftentimes you
[1:13:53] know we speak about the holy spirit
[1:13:55] coming and the holy spirit
[1:13:56] and receiving the holy spirit and
[1:13:58] sometimes it's left mysterious where
[1:14:01] people get into a place where do i have
[1:14:03] it don't i have it how do i get it
[1:14:05] i thought i had it and i don't have it
[1:14:07] and all those things and i want to just
[1:14:09] say this tonight
[1:14:10] the holy spirit can only come to the
[1:14:13] seed
[1:14:15] it's no question brahmanam says that in
[1:14:18] fact in the last day it says that
[1:14:20] that the holy spirit is here hunting
[1:14:23] for those who are predestinated before
[1:14:25] the foundation of the world
[1:14:27] can you get it god is wanting to give
[1:14:29] you so bad
[1:14:30] more than you desire it why because
[1:14:34] it's his word it is anointing it's his
[1:14:37] power
[1:14:37] he wants to manifest himself into you
[1:14:40] but madame says this
[1:14:41] he speaks about christ it says that all
[1:14:44] the program of god
[1:14:46] dwelled in him who was the anointed one
[1:14:49] and i want to say this
[1:14:50] all of the plan of god the same as it
[1:14:52] was in christ
[1:14:53] is rested upon those that have received
[1:14:56] this quickening power
[1:14:58] why because the quickening power does
[1:15:00] the same
[1:15:01] as he did in christ it does into the
[1:15:04] bride
[1:15:06] what was the holy spirit given for god
[1:15:09] wants to show this generation that he's
[1:15:12] alive
[1:15:12] he wants to show this world that he
[1:15:14] still lives he has work to do
[1:15:17] but he cannot do it in the body of jesus
[1:15:19] christ
[1:15:20] he has a body of people in the last day
[1:15:23] that he promised it will pour
[1:15:25] the scripture says that all that was in
[1:15:27] god he poured into christ
[1:15:29] and all that was in christ it poured
[1:15:31] into church
[1:15:32] we got caught up in what measure and
[1:15:34] everything and i want to say this
[1:15:36] we've been told that the ocean is
[1:15:38] spoonful will do exactly
[1:15:40] what the cub can do and i want to say
[1:15:43] this
[1:15:43] when we put our liquid fire together you
[1:15:46] take your measure
[1:15:47] you give it to that one measure we put
[1:15:49] that one measure together
[1:15:50] we put all of that together it comes
[1:15:52] into a size
[1:15:53] where god will allow us to do what he
[1:15:56] wants us to do as a body
[1:16:01] he cannot do in christ something
[1:16:03] different than the bride
[1:16:06] it cannot be in christ christ becomes
[1:16:09] the part of the whole plan of god and
[1:16:11] gets in us
[1:16:12] and do something different when he gets
[1:16:15] into us he makes us he makes us part of
[1:16:18] his plan
[1:16:21] it says now
[1:16:25] he says
[1:16:35] he says now
[1:16:39] that is true god called messiahs
[1:16:43] god called us
[1:16:51] and we become kings and priests unto god
[1:16:54] just like jesus was the high priest we
[1:16:57] become
[1:16:58] a last priest jesus he says god
[1:17:02] god in fullness dwelled in christ
[1:17:06] dwelt in him to shine forth the
[1:17:08] expression of god
[1:17:09] to the world for god was in christ
[1:17:12] reconciling the world to himself
[1:17:15] and god was in christ reconciling the
[1:17:17] world to himself
[1:17:19] god was god come into his church
[1:17:23] and anoint him and anoints him
[1:17:26] some messiahs some messiahs oh do you
[1:17:29] see
[1:17:30] it it says the same thing he did with us
[1:17:33] we he did in his he did he did is
[1:17:37] in his church the same power he had
[1:17:40] in his church his church becoming his
[1:17:44] dominion and he's the king over this
[1:17:47] dominion
[1:17:49] we are the king and priest offering
[1:17:52] spiritual sacrifices to god
[1:17:54] the fruits of our lips giving praise to
[1:17:57] his neck to his name
[1:17:58] oh it says amen oh my he says they were
[1:18:02] messiah messiah little messiah
[1:18:05] little anointed ones anointed one of
[1:18:08] what
[1:18:09] the main one the main anointing of that
[1:18:12] great one
[1:18:14] it says who do you
[1:18:17] who do you say this is give me a church
[1:18:22] that's so completely anointed with god
[1:18:25] till they everything acts their every
[1:18:28] action
[1:18:29] and move is that say of the lord walk in
[1:18:32] the shekinah glory
[1:18:34] and i'll show you a messiah
[1:18:40] it's it's that giving into him it's that
[1:18:43] dying to ourselves
[1:18:45] now you know we say oh we're waiting on
[1:18:48] this the scripture but
[1:18:49] says over and over again god who's god
[1:18:51] is waiting on you and i
[1:18:53] that's right so is it god waiting on us
[1:18:55] or is this us working on waiting on god
[1:18:58] see the enemy always wants to bring the
[1:19:00] confusion
[1:19:01] oh god i need this oh god i need this
[1:19:03] but random talks about
[1:19:05] moses it says moses was grown a proper
[1:19:08] child
[1:19:08] god laid everything he came into
[1:19:11] the dynamic he says he had the mechanics
[1:19:14] he was being told and he seen it in a
[1:19:16] word
[1:19:16] and he knew that there were to be out of
[1:19:18] the bondage and everything
[1:19:20] and then his dynamics is when he came to
[1:19:22] the burning bush
[1:19:23] it came and the dynamics came upon him
[1:19:26] but him says in the message the third
[1:19:28] accident if i'm not mistaken it says
[1:19:30] he says that when he says that god went
[1:19:33] into the form of moses
[1:19:34] so the dynamic came and he dwelt into
[1:19:37] the body
[1:19:39] so he comes and now he's before the red
[1:19:42] sea
[1:19:42] after all that god had done but when it
[1:19:45] says what was his action
[1:19:47] he says just like us humanly oh god
[1:19:50] can you come now i need you to speak i
[1:19:52] need you to show me
[1:19:53] what should i do what should i do what
[1:19:56] should i do
[1:19:56] and by the scripture but what i'm saying
[1:19:58] he says god must have been fed up with
[1:20:00] him
[1:20:01] yes sir he says speak the word and go
[1:20:04] forward
[1:20:06] it was anointed for the job
[1:20:09] that's the purpose of his creation was
[1:20:12] so he can do
[1:20:13] what he was doing the purpose of your
[1:20:16] creation
[1:20:17] is so you can hear this word and
[1:20:19] manifest it
[1:20:21] so he says and then he says one place it
[1:20:24] says
[1:20:24] uh moses wanted just to be pushed every
[1:20:27] time god will come in
[1:20:29] and move him to another move him to
[1:20:31] another and then push him from here and
[1:20:33] push him there and push him there but in
[1:20:36] the adoption
[1:20:37] hearing him we heard it this morning god
[1:20:39] is looking for sons and daughters
[1:20:42] that have understood the position they
[1:20:44] know what they're here to do
[1:20:46] they know what they've been anointed to
[1:20:48] do they know what they've been called
[1:20:50] they're about the business of the father
[1:20:52] so they come into a place where
[1:20:54] what they desire is the desire for the
[1:20:56] father
[1:20:58] what they what they would like to see is
[1:21:00] what their father wants
[1:21:01] in other words they are connected to
[1:21:03] this kingdom
[1:21:04] that what their father just like adam in
[1:21:07] the beginning
[1:21:07] out of name animals and the scripture
[1:21:11] says when god looks at it it says
[1:21:13] that's wonderful that's wonderful why
[1:21:16] because the mind of the father was
[1:21:18] transferred to the sun
[1:21:20] and the revealing of this word brings a
[1:21:22] quickening power
[1:21:24] while the mind of god has been revealed
[1:21:26] to us
[1:21:28] if we can move within our mind nothing
[1:21:31] will stand in our way
[1:21:32] and if something's done we have been
[1:21:34] given the power
[1:21:36] we have been given the holy spirit to
[1:21:38] call upon the holy spirit so he can come
[1:21:41] on the same and move on our behalf
[1:21:44] speak the word how are you going to
[1:21:46] speak the word because i'm connected to
[1:21:48] the father
[1:21:49] because what i desire is the father's
[1:21:51] desire
[1:21:52] what i want is to see the father
[1:21:54] manifested it's not me
[1:21:56] it's the father living in me
[1:22:00] ultimately the sun all the sun becomes
[1:22:03] it's just the father
[1:22:05] in another form ultimately the sun
[1:22:09] becomes the father in another body
[1:22:14] why because it's the pure spirit of the
[1:22:16] father that dwells within the sun
[1:22:18] he talks like the dad he walks like that
[1:22:21] he thinks like that
[1:22:23] he has the same love the same compassion
[1:22:26] the same everything
[1:22:27] how are we gonna get there if we're
[1:22:28] still fast if we're still
[1:22:31] mad at each other if we can't see
[1:22:33] clearly if we can't get off the things
[1:22:35] of the world
[1:22:36] if we can't clean up if we can apply the
[1:22:38] token how are we going to get there
[1:22:40] and that's why the tutor has been sent
[1:22:43] so he can walk us through
[1:22:44] the truder is the quickening power that
[1:22:47] will come and show you
[1:22:48] this is not the business of the father
[1:22:50] this is what the father wants
[1:22:52] you to do you do wrong the holy spirit
[1:22:54] convicts you
[1:22:55] what is he doing he is quickening you
[1:22:57] and tutoring you
[1:22:58] so you can come into that fullness
[1:23:02] god has not called us so we can just say
[1:23:05] we are saved
[1:23:07] oh that's what pentecostal did that's
[1:23:09] what they did they got gifts and they
[1:23:11] jumped up and
[1:23:12] they want everybody to be that way and
[1:23:14] that's the end of it
[1:23:15] god has called us for something
[1:23:16] different we have been called for the
[1:23:18] full manifestation
[1:23:20] the headstone has come the the love of
[1:23:23] god
[1:23:24] has been descended and we have received
[1:23:26] it and the desires of the father
[1:23:28] is the desire of the bride
[1:23:39] what's the purpose of the mechanics
[1:23:43] if there are no dynamics it's just so we
[1:23:48] can
[1:23:49] share with one another more mechanics
[1:23:54] so today we can use these words to
[1:23:56] describe one thing
[1:23:58] and then use the same different words to
[1:24:00] describe the same thing
[1:24:04] that's the curse of denomination
[1:24:08] they desired no part of the power
[1:24:11] they were happy with what they had in
[1:24:14] fact how
[1:24:15] how can a real believer say that the
[1:24:18] days of miracles are passed
[1:24:22] how can you say that and i will say well
[1:24:26] that's the nomination
[1:24:27] but i wonder how many of us when things
[1:24:30] happen
[1:24:31] how do we like our parents would even
[1:24:33] describe this morning
[1:24:34] we run into and god is the last thing we
[1:24:37] go to
[1:24:39] and i mean we show up crawling
[1:24:43] like crawling it's like at the last
[1:24:45] breath
[1:24:46] oh god in egypt
[1:24:49] where we have been called to be placed
[1:24:51] to be sons to be daughters
[1:24:53] to be the ones the continuation of the
[1:24:55] kingdom to be representative of the
[1:24:58] kingdom
[1:24:58] to be the mind of the father revealed to
[1:25:00] the word to have
[1:25:02] all these things with us
[1:25:05] it says he says
[1:25:09] now the word was made fleshed and
[1:25:12] manifested in him
[1:25:13] he was the complete anointed it was the
[1:25:15] complete anointed one
[1:25:18] it says they had it by partial
[1:25:21] they're headed by portions we are we
[1:25:24] have it by portion but it was the
[1:25:26] entire uh plan of god laid in him
[1:25:29] god planned before the foundation of the
[1:25:31] world to redeem
[1:25:32] the laws was in him he was that word
[1:25:36] and he still is the word the same
[1:25:38] yesterday today and forever remember
[1:25:40] he can he can do he came to the father
[1:25:44] through the prophets and made himself
[1:25:46] known through the prophets
[1:25:48] and then in the last day through the son
[1:25:50] jesus christ
[1:25:51] he was made manifest it's the same plan
[1:25:55] if god desired to save the sins the
[1:25:58] sinners in jesus christ
[1:26:00] god desired to save the sins in the
[1:26:02] bride the sinners in the bride
[1:26:04] if god desire to heal in jesus christ
[1:26:07] god desires to heal and arrive if god
[1:26:10] desires to deliver
[1:26:12] in jesus christ the same god desire to
[1:26:14] deliver
[1:26:15] in the bride it's the same continuation
[1:26:17] there's no stopping
[1:26:19] it's the same god moving where is he
[1:26:21] moving into
[1:26:22] is moving into the very image of who he
[1:26:24] is
[1:26:26] like a prophet talks about that the gold
[1:26:29] the one who works on the goal
[1:26:30] he will beat it and they will beat it
[1:26:32] they will work the gold
[1:26:33] until they see the very reflection in
[1:26:35] the gold
[1:26:37] and i believe that's what god is doing
[1:26:39] with us he's looking for his respection
[1:26:41] he's not looking for personality
[1:26:43] personality has nothing to do with this
[1:26:46] men have turned this gospel into
[1:26:48] personality and style of preaching
[1:26:51] and this and man and then oh i like the
[1:26:53] style
[1:26:54] i like when this one does this i like
[1:26:56] this you're missing the point of what
[1:26:58] god is trying to achieve
[1:26:59] god is not interested in man this gospel
[1:27:02] was not said so man can
[1:27:04] take it and take ownership of it and
[1:27:06] become the revelator
[1:27:07] this was sent so god can speak to his
[1:27:10] sons and daughters
[1:27:11] so they can manifest christ
[1:27:15] we get lost into people they pull us
[1:27:18] here and this one pulls here
[1:27:20] this one interprets it this way that one
[1:27:22] contradict that one
[1:27:23] and now we don't know it we're waiting
[1:27:25] so who's going to say what
[1:27:27] and how they're going to further explain
[1:27:28] it god brings his word by bringing it to
[1:27:31] pass
[1:27:32] that's his interpretation he says it
[1:27:35] with a messenger
[1:27:36] i want it i want to see it just like it
[1:27:39] says it
[1:27:40] i'm not interested in men's and
[1:27:42] explanation i want the dynamic that
[1:27:44] smoke that word
[1:27:45] to come within me and make the world a
[1:27:47] reality to me
[1:27:51] those are the people that are going in
[1:27:52] the rapture as long as you're still
[1:27:54] caught up within man
[1:27:56] you loosen it god wants you back into
[1:27:59] the fall
[1:28:00] look to him look to him who jesus christ
[1:28:03] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:28:05] he will start and will finish
[1:28:07] it he will spoke to what he'll make it
[1:28:09] to come to pass i don't care if you
[1:28:11] don't understand it
[1:28:12] you just believe it and he will bring
[1:28:14] the interpretation
[1:28:15] he will bring the understanding he will
[1:28:17] bring everything that you have need of
[1:28:22] amen it says this
[1:28:25] it says if i say the spirit of john
[1:28:27] dillinger
[1:28:28] was in me i'd have gun and
[1:28:32] be an outlaw it says
[1:28:35] because that's being a nature and
[1:28:38] that's being natural and if i said the
[1:28:40] spirit if i put
[1:28:42] my life of the life of pumpkin in a in
[1:28:45] us
[1:28:45] in a in the uh
[1:28:49] vine uh a grape vine it will bear
[1:28:52] pumpkin
[1:28:53] it says sure it's the life that produces
[1:28:56] it
[1:28:57] put the life into an apple tree and it
[1:29:00] will
[1:29:00] it into put the life of an apple tree
[1:29:02] into a pear tree
[1:29:04] it will bear apples because the life
[1:29:07] it's the apple life in the tree
[1:29:11] and and i want to say this this is by no
[1:29:14] means
[1:29:15] a condemnation
[1:29:18] far before it this is
[1:29:21] to bring us to a place where we begin to
[1:29:25] seek the life
[1:29:27] the appropriate life that we need to
[1:29:28] bring
[1:29:32] if i'm not bringing the spirit of christ
[1:29:34] if i'm not manifesting the life
[1:29:37] that comes with the spirit of christ i
[1:29:39] want it
[1:29:40] right we're here this is what
[1:29:44] as long as we're still breathing and
[1:29:46] live a year it's a space a time for us
[1:29:48] to do the right thing
[1:29:50] to move into the right thing he didn't
[1:29:52] say this as a condemnation
[1:29:54] and so you can go and say oh i must have
[1:29:56] a different life
[1:29:57] no if i don't have it i want it i'm
[1:30:00] looking for it
[1:30:01] god i want that manifestation and i
[1:30:03] don't care who
[1:30:04] laughs at me or who thinks whatever i
[1:30:07] tell you at the last day there's not
[1:30:09] gonna be laughing
[1:30:10] people will be crying and screaming and
[1:30:12] all kinds of things
[1:30:13] i want one is giving me a chance today
[1:30:16] it says today when you hear your voice
[1:30:19] his voice i'm not your heart
[1:30:21] today i heard his voice and i'm
[1:30:23] screaming our father i want
[1:30:25] your life not anybody else's life
[1:30:28] i don't want some preacher's life i
[1:30:30] don't want some pastor's life
[1:30:32] i want the life of christ living within
[1:30:34] me so i can manifest the fruits of
[1:30:36] christ
[1:30:39] oftentimes we take it and we flip it
[1:30:41] around oh
[1:30:42] i'm doing wrong i must know is there
[1:30:45] something within you that wants to do
[1:30:47] right
[1:30:48] if there is the city is there just call
[1:30:50] for the dynamic to come
[1:30:52] just pray so he can send the dynamic you
[1:30:55] didn't figure out this message by
[1:30:56] yourself
[1:30:57] you didn't come up to the conclusion
[1:30:59] that this is true that was the mechanic
[1:31:01] that he put in there
[1:31:02] just call upon the dynamic to confirm
[1:31:05] that mechanic that already lies in there
[1:31:09] amen
[1:31:12] he says and all that was in christ he
[1:31:15] poured into his church
[1:31:17] anointed one to continue the work
[1:31:21] that his word might live
[1:31:25] constantly that his
[1:31:28] word might live constantly
[1:31:32] if it's not on earth how is he going to
[1:31:35] live
[1:31:36] constantly
[1:31:39] he's going to live constantly by a group
[1:31:42] of people
[1:31:43] who have received his word and they are
[1:31:46] manifesting his spirit
[1:31:48] constantly that's how the holy spirit is
[1:31:51] not in the air
[1:31:55] it's not stuck up in the air and finding
[1:31:57] out am i gonna land
[1:31:58] am i gonna no the holy spirit is in the
[1:32:01] people
[1:32:02] to manifest christ it's here
[1:32:06] to manify is he here where in the people
[1:32:09] but what was in god important to christ
[1:32:13] as far as i'm concerned when he moved
[1:32:15] from christ it went into the people
[1:32:18] that's what the scripture says
[1:32:25] it says
[1:32:28] that that the word might might live
[1:32:30] constantly
[1:32:31] he lived by the word of the father men
[1:32:33] shall not live by the bread alone
[1:32:35] but everywhere that proceedeth after the
[1:32:36] mother god the church don't live
[1:32:38] by bread alone but by the word of christ
[1:32:41] the holy spirit comes in it and takes
[1:32:44] the words of christ
[1:32:45] and make it live action today
[1:32:51] these signs shall follow them that
[1:32:52] believe
[1:32:54] it says oh brother give me a church full
[1:32:58] of holy ghost
[1:32:59] god will do in one year
[1:33:03] what all theologian failed to do in 2000
[1:33:06] years
[1:33:08] you wait until that anointing of the
[1:33:11] church
[1:33:11] really strike home to that faithful
[1:33:14] little remnant
[1:33:15] after the door of the gentile is closed
[1:33:18] oh
[1:33:19] god will anoint the church then you will
[1:33:22] announce a church
[1:33:23] then who's filthy will let him be filthy
[1:33:27] still
[1:33:27] who's righteous let him be righteous
[1:33:29] still who's holy let him be
[1:33:31] right holy still and god will anoint
[1:33:34] this church with the power of god
[1:33:36] and things will take place not only then
[1:33:40] but there he's doing it now
[1:33:44] he's doing it now we need to move into
[1:33:47] it we need to
[1:33:48] come to a place where we desire these
[1:33:51] things
[1:33:52] yes we want to see these things
[1:33:55] and in closing i know we have communion
[1:33:58] tonight i'll just jump quickly and close
[1:34:00] here
[1:34:01] i'll read one more and then get to a
[1:34:03] close
[1:34:04] it says it says the kingdom of god
[1:34:09] is the word of is the kingdom of god is
[1:34:12] his word
[1:34:13] made power if you want to put it down
[1:34:19] write the first uh first corinthians 4
[1:34:22] and 20
[1:34:23] the kingdom of god is word is god's word
[1:34:26] made power
[1:34:28] what is what is the kingdom of god is
[1:34:30] within you
[1:34:32] kingdom is in you god's word comes in
[1:34:36] there
[1:34:37] what does he do what does he what does
[1:34:39] this word begin
[1:34:40] it turns itself into power
[1:34:44] the word attains itself into power
[1:34:48] making it say exactly what he said what
[1:34:51] he said
[1:34:53] you say you say you can't say it
[1:34:57] it says it it's it says it
[1:35:02] it says this and make it work
[1:35:05] so it speaks and then it makes it work
[1:35:14] you've got to say the same thing as it
[1:35:16] says to make a confession
[1:35:18] not saying well it's polished and a
[1:35:21] little here
[1:35:22] and more wisdom and then i'll better
[1:35:24] stand over here
[1:35:26] you stay with the word there it is and
[1:35:28] he makes it power
[1:35:30] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:35:31] and forever jesus says in saint john 14
[1:35:34] and 12
[1:35:35] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:35:37] you i beg your pardon
[1:35:39] it wasn't he said he said he said it
[1:35:41] there but he said
[1:35:42] he if he that he he that believeth
[1:35:46] in me the works that i do shall it do
[1:35:49] also
[1:35:50] if you abide in me and my word in you
[1:35:54] you can ask what you will and it shall
[1:35:56] come unto you
[1:35:58] if you abide in me and my words in you
[1:36:01] it's the constant abiding i want to
[1:36:04] close with this
[1:36:06] i was thinking about elisha or elijah on
[1:36:10] the mount carmel
[1:36:12] it came and it was such a time of
[1:36:14] confusion
[1:36:16] and the scripture says that it came to
[1:36:18] israel and it says
[1:36:20] that if baal be god and says then
[1:36:22] worship him if god be god let's worship
[1:36:24] him
[1:36:25] let's not get caught up between two
[1:36:27] opinions and i feel like oftentimes we
[1:36:29] are caught up between
[1:36:30] intellect and dynamic is it inalight is
[1:36:33] it dynamic
[1:36:34] sometimes we go by you know and then
[1:36:36] we'll say no it's not it we go back to
[1:36:37] the dynamic and then we
[1:36:39] it says if don't be caught up between
[1:36:41] the two
[1:36:43] now i want you to realize what he did
[1:36:44] here so he said that
[1:36:47] that the god who's god he will answer by
[1:36:50] fire
[1:36:51] by the dynamic the the true gospel of
[1:36:55] god
[1:36:56] always has a dynamic attached to it the
[1:36:59] true
[1:36:59] god the creator of heaven and earth he
[1:37:02] never sent his word
[1:37:03] and let you figure it out and let you
[1:37:06] try to find it yourself
[1:37:08] like the prophet of baal he made fun of
[1:37:10] him and says perhaps he didn't hear you
[1:37:11] you got to scream out louder
[1:37:13] it wasn't in the screaming and they
[1:37:15] scream and they run around and
[1:37:17] they cut themselves and create a source
[1:37:19] of urgency and did all of those things
[1:37:21] and nothing happened and you know why
[1:37:24] elijah was sitting right there
[1:37:26] when he came the first thing he done is
[1:37:28] he prepared the altar
[1:37:30] what is the altar is the mechanic is the
[1:37:32] word because the
[1:37:34] holy spirit can only move upon the word
[1:37:37] so once he had the word ready he knew
[1:37:39] that
[1:37:40] god will come and vindicate his word and
[1:37:42] i want to say this how many times the
[1:37:44] messenger in this last day
[1:37:46] he said if what i spoke to you if what i
[1:37:48] say to you is the word of god
[1:37:50] then he will come and vindicate it it's
[1:37:53] not for men to try to prove anything
[1:37:56] it's if it's the word of god god will
[1:37:58] come and vindicate it
[1:38:00] if what you believe is the message god
[1:38:02] will come and predicate it
[1:38:04] there's a dynamic always attached to the
[1:38:06] word
[1:38:07] to prove that what you believe is a
[1:38:09] reality
[1:38:11] so he comes in and he did it according
[1:38:14] to the word of the lord
[1:38:15] so he comes and he tells them and they
[1:38:17] do all that they can and everything
[1:38:19] and and all they lay all the intellect
[1:38:21] that nothing happened
[1:38:22] and the scripture says by the evening
[1:38:24] time elijah knew that the time was
[1:38:27] getting closer
[1:38:28] it just let them run and let them run
[1:38:30] when the evening time was done it says
[1:38:33] i think now you guys have run out and
[1:38:35] that's what pentecost has done
[1:38:37] they've screamed out and put out all the
[1:38:39] gifts and cut themselves
[1:38:41] and think it was by the sacrifices of
[1:38:43] man and done all that they could
[1:38:45] and what did it produce nothing
[1:38:48] why did he produce nothing then this
[1:38:51] little old
[1:38:52] just small guy and just not not greater
[1:38:55] stature
[1:38:56] just a little man and jesus just came
[1:38:57] and stood there
[1:38:59] and he took the first thing he done is
[1:39:01] he prepared the altar
[1:39:02] he took all the loose hands and he put
[1:39:04] it together he took what they left out
[1:39:07] and
[1:39:07] what the method is left out the baptist
[1:39:09] and the precipitation
[1:39:11] and all he laid all together and he knew
[1:39:14] by doing that
[1:39:15] by preparing the word that god will
[1:39:17] vandicate his word
[1:39:18] because why that's what he told him and
[1:39:21] he comes and delays the altar
[1:39:24] and it says that if god be god let him
[1:39:26] come and answer by fire
[1:39:28] and to prove that it was not the works
[1:39:30] of man he says poor water
[1:39:32] they pull back it after bucket off the
[1:39:34] bucket perhaps they say well there was a
[1:39:37] little wind that blew up and caught fire
[1:39:39] there was this he wanted to absolutely
[1:39:41] prove
[1:39:42] that this is not by any works of man
[1:39:44] this is god in action
[1:39:46] and i want to say this my brother my
[1:39:48] sister for us to see god in action
[1:39:50] let's believe the word let's kick out
[1:39:53] the trash let's prepare the altar
[1:39:55] let's lay on that altar let's die to
[1:39:58] ourselves and
[1:39:58] let's give ourselves all that we are
[1:40:01] let's not build some bridges other
[1:40:03] places
[1:40:03] let's cut loose of everything i tell you
[1:40:06] that's the church
[1:40:07] that will manifest the messiahs of the
[1:40:09] last day why because
[1:40:10] god will move upon her amen god bless
[1:40:14] you
[1:40:16] amen amen
[1:40:28] that's what i've been trying to say i
[1:40:29] just can't say it as good as billy
[1:40:32] and you believe that that's what we want
[1:40:37] and we've got to do our part and we and
[1:40:40] that's what we said that we've got to
[1:40:41] have that tutor
[1:40:43] we've got to have that spirit come we've
[1:40:45] got to have them start cleaning our
[1:40:47] lives
[1:40:47] we've got to start looking for it you're
[1:40:50] not going to see it if you don't look
[1:40:52] for it
[1:40:53] prophet god said if you come critical
[1:40:57] to criticize something you'll find
[1:40:58] something to criticize
[1:41:00] if you come looking for that
[1:41:03] dynamic power to start coming into the
[1:41:06] church
[1:41:07] it'll come and there's something that
[1:41:10] that touched me that billy said that i
[1:41:13] wanted
[1:41:14] to send that and let it really sink in
[1:41:18] your heart good
[1:41:19] he said when you looked at samson
[1:41:23] and you looked at the outside and you
[1:41:25] looked at the physical
[1:41:27] and then you looked at the work
[1:41:31] they didn't match now if big john
[1:41:35] meal here lifted up something you could
[1:41:38] understand that he's a big strong man
[1:41:41] you know but if some little skinny guy
[1:41:44] comes along
[1:41:45] and does it it don't match
[1:41:48] it's him if you look at yourselves
[1:41:52] you don't match
[1:41:57] you're you're you're not what the world
[1:42:00] would think was a church
[1:42:02] you're not what the world would think
[1:42:04] could
[1:42:05] have the power you don't have the
[1:42:07] education
[1:42:08] if you you you're just he didn't come to
[1:42:11] the
[1:42:12] rich of this world but he came to the
[1:42:14] those that were rich in faith
[1:42:16] the poor of this world when you start to
[1:42:19] look around
[1:42:20] and you see god elected you because you
[1:42:23] didn't match
[1:42:24] the ecclesiastical theory
[1:42:27] of what a christian would be
[1:42:30] he's the match he's the match to you
[1:42:35] because he created you and i think if we
[1:42:38] could get
[1:42:39] that courage and be encouraged and get
[1:42:42] our eyes off ourselves
[1:42:44] and our eyes on the prophet promise
[1:42:48] and that's what billy said when we can
[1:42:50] start to look to him
[1:42:52] we believe what he said right
[1:42:57] we believe what he said he's given us
[1:43:00] the automobile
[1:43:04] we own the automobile we go out there
[1:43:07] and we sit in the automobile
[1:43:09] and we say god gave me this autumn it's
[1:43:12] my automobile
[1:43:13] i could turn the key and it'll crank
[1:43:17] now what do you need to make it go
[1:43:20] you need that gasoline
[1:43:24] from heaven and that's what billy's
[1:43:27] saying to us tonight god
[1:43:30] put the gasoline in my tank
[1:43:33] i'm ready to go i'm ready to move to
[1:43:37] higher
[1:43:38] heights i'm ready to move to a more holy
[1:43:41] life
[1:43:42] i'm ready to move into service for you
[1:43:44] i'm willing
[1:43:45] we read that quote last week he says
[1:43:48] who's willing to say
[1:43:49] satan i've come to stand against you
[1:43:53] i've come to challenge you i've come to
[1:43:57] do it
[1:43:57] this is for me and this is where
[1:44:00] i believe the church is at
[1:44:04] and i loved how brother billy said the
[1:44:06] mechanics is there
[1:44:08] the tires are on the car he's done
[1:44:10] everything
[1:44:11] now lord send the gasoline of your holy
[1:44:15] spirit and that i i can make
[1:44:19] when i turn that spark in my heart it'll
[1:44:22] take me to my healing
[1:44:24] it'll take me to my deliverance and then
[1:44:27] when you start experience it for
[1:44:29] yourself
[1:44:30] then you know what he's done for me
[1:44:32] he'll do for others
[1:44:35] you know why i've always had a hope for
[1:44:37] a lost person
[1:44:38] no matter how lost they are or how dark
[1:44:42] they look
[1:44:43] because i came from a very deep
[1:44:46] dark place of sin
[1:44:50] darker than i can even express to you
[1:44:52] through my testimony
[1:44:55] i believe god plucked me out of hell
[1:44:59] and i was in the grips of satan
[1:45:03] and he took me out so i know in my heart
[1:45:07] that he can save any man no matter how
[1:45:10] deeply in sin they are
[1:45:14] now lord give me
[1:45:17] the love give me the gasoline
[1:45:21] give me the spirit to bring this
[1:45:24] to the dying world i'm about the
[1:45:27] father's business brother branham said
[1:45:30] i'm interested in the lost i'm
[1:45:32] interested in the sick
[1:45:34] and afflicted i'm interested in those
[1:45:37] that are in bondage
[1:45:39] and burdened and i want to bring
[1:45:42] this dynamics to them so i can show this
[1:45:46] world
[1:45:47] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:45:50] today and forever
[1:45:52] church that's and billy read the quotes
[1:45:55] tonight
[1:45:56] that's what we're moving into
[1:46:01] it's not man we we finally got
[1:46:04] past we had before we could have a
[1:46:08] form a ladder rain
[1:46:11] we had to have a former rain
[1:46:14] a teaching rain pentecost thought they
[1:46:18] were the latter rain
[1:46:19] but they weren't because they didn't
[1:46:21] have the teaching rain
[1:46:23] to go with it and what did really billy
[1:46:26] share with this night of the holy spirit
[1:46:28] through billy shared with it that's why
[1:46:30] pentecost never turned into nothing
[1:46:34] but a bunch of screaming shouting
[1:46:36] hollering
[1:46:39] and they can only produce that when
[1:46:41] they're
[1:46:42] in their atmosphere
[1:46:47] but a believer that's got the power
[1:46:50] it don't matter if they're in the mud it
[1:46:53] don't matter
[1:46:54] if it's a rocky mountain it don't matter
[1:46:56] if it's a valley
[1:46:58] it don't matter if it's the desert
[1:47:00] they've got the gasoline that moves the
[1:47:02] mechanics
[1:47:03] and that's where we're coming to we
[1:47:05] don't need emotion
[1:47:06] to do it we need the person of jesus
[1:47:10] christ
[1:47:11] dwelling in us and that's what we're
[1:47:12] having communion with tonight
[1:47:14] let's stand together as the brothers go
[1:47:21] prepare the communion to bring it
[1:47:24] and we'll read this little portion of
[1:47:27] scripture
[1:47:27] found in the 11th chapter of
[1:47:31] corinthians i enjoyed that brother and
[1:47:34] like i told you i wish you that has
[1:47:35] turned your back to the audience
[1:47:38] and then they could have said the lord
[1:47:39] turned us back to the audience
[1:47:41] and just preached to me i'm telling you
[1:47:45] that's what my heart's burning for
[1:47:48] and i i i've seen it in the in the
[1:47:51] sermons that
[1:47:53] that he's been bringing us you know
[1:47:56] they've just been
[1:47:56] pieces of the puzzle to me you know
[1:48:00] preach on this preach on that preach on
[1:48:03] that
[1:48:04] and now i'm starting to see the picture
[1:48:06] come together didn't brother billy say
[1:48:08] that
[1:48:08] he says he shows you this in the world
[1:48:10] he shows you
[1:48:11] this and you see the picture shouldn't
[1:48:13] we see the picture coming together
[1:48:16] with the homosexuality shouldn't we see
[1:48:18] the picture coming together with the
[1:48:20] civil unrest
[1:48:22] in the streets shouldn't we see the
[1:48:23] picture come
[1:48:25] come together with the plagues and the
[1:48:28] virus
[1:48:29] shouldn't we see the picture come
[1:48:30] together with the earthquakes and
[1:48:33] the fires and and the floods and
[1:48:37] that they're having look just down on
[1:48:39] the coast
[1:48:41] when is the picture gonna come together
[1:48:45] that this is the time
[1:48:50] lord give me i sap that i
[1:48:53] might see the hour
[1:48:56] is here hallelujah
[1:49:00] let us read for i have received the lord
[1:49:03] that which also i delivered unto you
[1:49:06] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:49:09] which
[1:49:10] he was betrayed took bread
[1:49:13] and when he had given thanks
[1:49:16] he break it and said take eat
[1:49:21] this is my body which is broken
[1:49:24] for you this do in remembrance
[1:49:28] of me and after the same manner also
[1:49:32] he took the cup when he had stopped
[1:49:35] saying this cup is the new testament
[1:49:39] in my blood this duty as
[1:49:42] often as ye drink it in remembrance
[1:49:46] of me don't you love like this cup
[1:49:50] is the new testament in my blood
[1:49:53] in other words me dying on the cross has
[1:49:56] brought to you
[1:49:57] this new testament and this revelation
[1:50:00] and i'll meet you under that shed blood
[1:50:03] every time do this as often as you dink
[1:50:05] in remembrance of me
[1:50:07] for often as you eat this bread and
[1:50:09] drink this cup
[1:50:10] you do show the lord's death till he
[1:50:13] come
[1:50:14] whosoever shall eat of this bread and
[1:50:17] drink of the cup of the lord
[1:50:19] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:50:21] and the blood of the lord
[1:50:23] but let a man examine himself
[1:50:26] and so let him eat of that bread
[1:50:30] and drink of that cup
[1:50:34] ask yourself is there a desire
[1:50:37] in your heart to commune with the lord
[1:50:40] even though satan's trapped you and made
[1:50:42] a lot of mistakes
[1:50:44] even though you've done things that
[1:50:46] you're ashamed of
[1:50:48] go past those things and look into your
[1:50:51] heart
[1:50:52] and say lord i want what i heard tonight
[1:50:56] i want this dynamic that i heard tonight
[1:51:00] that's why i'm coming to have communion
[1:51:03] not that i'm perfect but that i'm
[1:51:05] imperfect not that i haven't made
[1:51:08] mistakes
[1:51:09] but that i want the power that'll
[1:51:12] give me overcoming power
[1:51:16] amen and and
[1:51:19] and and for he says
[1:51:23] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:51:25] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:51:27] to himself not discerning the lord's
[1:51:29] body
[1:51:29] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:51:32] among you and many sleep
[1:51:33] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:51:36] should not
[1:51:37] be judged hallelujah
[1:51:41] and when we are judged we are chastened
[1:51:43] of the lord
[1:51:44] that we should not be condemned
[1:51:48] with the world therefore my brother when
[1:51:51] you come together deter
[1:51:53] to eat carry one for another and if any
[1:51:56] man hunger
[1:51:57] let him eat at home that ye come not
[1:52:01] together unto condemnation
[1:52:04] and the rest will i set an order
[1:52:07] when i come let us pray our heavenly
[1:52:10] father
[1:52:12] or we carry one for another lord
[1:52:16] our church has never been in times like
[1:52:18] this
[1:52:20] seems like it's just the civilization
[1:52:24] itself
[1:52:24] is trying to rip us apart
[1:52:28] trying to take believers out
[1:52:31] and making it difficult
[1:52:35] father we've got real christian saints
[1:52:38] that are out there ministering to those
[1:52:41] that are
[1:52:44] by this virus
[1:52:48] they call it that's affecting the
[1:52:50] elderly
[1:52:51] we've got real christian women and men
[1:52:54] that are
[1:52:55] they're helping every day
[1:53:00] and we ask you to protect them lord
[1:53:03] we ask you to be a shining light
[1:53:07] in that darkness that jesus christ
[1:53:11] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:53:14] father and we long for the day that we
[1:53:16] can all come back together
[1:53:19] lord that we can look upon one another's
[1:53:21] faces
[1:53:23] and we can hug one another knowing that
[1:53:27] we're safe in you
[1:53:31] for lord we know that if the watchman
[1:53:36] watches and god doesn't watch the city
[1:53:40] that that watchman is watched in vain
[1:53:44] lord what good does it do is if we did
[1:53:46] everything the world told us to do us
[1:53:48] and you weren't helping us
[1:53:50] and protecting us father please
[1:53:54] remember us father
[1:53:57] bring us closer together stronger
[1:53:59] together
[1:54:00] and as our brother preached tonight may
[1:54:03] that token
[1:54:04] so go out in our lives that you you'll
[1:54:07] know where
[1:54:08] to come and dwell amen
[1:54:11] you will know where
[1:54:14] to come and dwell because we've applied
[1:54:17] the blood
[1:54:19] we asked this tonight in jesus name we
[1:54:22] pray
[1:54:23] amen god bless you brother you'll come
[1:54:27] may be seated
[1:54:45] amen let us pray our gracious heavenly
[1:54:49] father
[1:54:50] lord we ask you to bless this bread
[1:54:54] father and for all that it represents
[1:54:57] and we know that you represent your word
[1:55:01] and your word is food
[1:55:04] and meat indeed through the spiritual
[1:55:07] inner man
[1:55:09] we ask that we could come into communion
[1:55:11] tonight
[1:55:12] with the very desire that you have for
[1:55:14] us
[1:55:15] the desire that we would be
[1:55:19] as your messenger said chips off the
[1:55:22] block
[1:55:23] just about the father's business living
[1:55:27] and doing the same thing just the way
[1:55:29] you would do it
[1:55:30] that's our portion that's what he's
[1:55:33] trying to do
[1:55:34] is have a church of sons and daughters
[1:55:37] that are about his will
[1:55:38] may we come in communion tonight
[1:55:41] with that vision father this blood that
[1:55:44] represents
[1:55:45] the shed blood of jesus christ that paid
[1:55:48] the price
[1:55:49] that by his stripes we were healed that
[1:55:52] it represents the stimulation of
[1:55:55] revelation
[1:55:56] may it come on our heart till it's
[1:55:58] revealed to us
[1:56:00] personally that we have a part to play
[1:56:03] in the fulfilling of the word may our
[1:56:05] communion be around your person tonight
[1:56:08] we ask it in jesus name we pray
[1:56:11] amen may god bless you come as you feel
[1:56:14] led
[1:56:26] hallelujah
[1:57:05] [Music]
[1:57:09] you
