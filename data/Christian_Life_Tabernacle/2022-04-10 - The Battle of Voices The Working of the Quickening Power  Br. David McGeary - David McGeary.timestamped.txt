[12:14] in jesus name amen
[12:21] amen
[12:22] so this morning
[12:24] [Music]
[12:44] good morning
[12:54] you know as we mentioned
[12:56] last week we're going to take the next
[12:58] few weeks and
[13:00] go through psalm 119 together just a
[13:04] beautiful chapter
[13:06] you know the portion that we're going to
[13:08] read this morning begins in verse 9
[13:11] and it begins with this verse
[13:14] where with all
[13:15] shall a young man cleanse his way
[13:19] by taking heed thereto
[13:22] according to thy word
[13:25] so the question is asked
[13:27] where with all
[13:28] or
[13:29] with what
[13:31] shall a young man cleanse his way
[13:35] the answer is by taking heed thereto
[13:38] according to thy word
[13:41] you know and
[13:43] suppose many people look at that and
[13:47] read that and and
[13:49] you know they turn that into an act of
[13:51] religious discipline
[13:54] they'll read the scripture you know how
[13:56] can a man clean up his life
[14:01] and they'll read that and say well by
[14:04] lining up with the scriptures by
[14:06] disciplining their life
[14:09] according to the teachings of the bible
[14:13] you know that represents probably
[14:16] 90 95 percent of christianity
[14:19] today
[14:22] disciplining yourself to line up with
[14:24] the scriptures
[14:26] and that's not even
[14:27] what the scriptures teach
[14:30] you know we know that paul and jesus
[14:33] even brother branham
[14:35] talked about you know
[14:38] righteousness doesn't come by
[14:40] disciplining yourself to line up with
[14:42] the scriptures
[14:45] this is speaking of something else
[14:49] notice it doesn't ask the question
[14:51] wherewithal shall a young man cleanse
[14:53] himself
[14:55] but it says wherewithal shall a young
[14:58] man cleanse
[14:59] his way
[15:02] you know that word cleanse
[15:05] actually means
[15:07] to be made clear
[15:10] or transparent to make
[15:13] plain
[15:15] or to have clarity
[15:19] actually
[15:21] which way
[15:23] do i go
[15:25] what path
[15:26] should i take
[15:28] especially in this day
[15:31] how do i know
[15:33] the course
[15:34] to take where with all
[15:37] shall a young man cleanse his way
[15:42] you know this is not ordering your life
[15:43] according to scriptures
[15:46] this isn't about
[15:48] you know lining up with a book
[15:50] you know as we
[15:51] mentioned last time psalm 119 is all
[15:54] about a relationship
[15:56] with the word
[15:58] you can't have a relationship with a
[16:00] book
[16:01] you can't have a relationship with books
[16:04] and tapes
[16:07] you know this is about taking heed to
[16:09] the word
[16:11] you know jesus told the pharisees in
[16:13] john 5 39 he said search the scriptures
[16:18] for in them you think ye have eternal
[16:19] life and there they which testify of me
[16:24] you know those people ordered their
[16:26] lives according to the scriptures
[16:28] probably more perfectly and more
[16:31] completely than you know anyone possibly
[16:34] could
[16:37] and yet when the way himself stood in
[16:39] front of them
[16:41] it wasn't compatible
[16:43] ordering your life according to the
[16:45] scriptures
[16:48] in that case resulted in a rejection of
[16:51] the way
[16:53] it's certainly not the kind of taking
[16:55] heed according to thy word that cleanses
[16:59] his way
[17:02] you know as we go through this this
[17:05] section of psalm 119
[17:08] we read about what it's like to take
[17:11] heed
[17:12] according to thy word
[17:16] you know and it beautifully paralleled
[17:19] as i was looking at this john 14 and 15
[17:24] as a group of men
[17:26] are taking heed to the word
[17:29] showing them how to cleanse their way
[17:34] you know it says in verse 9 of psalm 119
[17:37] wherewithal shall a young man
[17:40] cleanse his way
[17:42] by taking heed according to thy word and
[17:44] it says in john 14 6
[17:47] jesus speaking
[17:49] i am the way
[17:51] the truth and the life
[17:53] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[17:58] verse 10 psalm 119 it says with my whole
[18:01] heart have i sought thee
[18:04] oh let me not wander from thy
[18:06] commandments
[18:08] and the way says in john 14 15
[18:11] if he loved me keep my commandments
[18:16] and again in verse 21
[18:18] he that hath my commandments
[18:20] and keepeth them
[18:22] he it is the love of me
[18:26] in psalm 119 verse 11 it says
[18:29] though thy word
[18:30] have i hid in my heart
[18:33] that i might not sin against thee
[18:36] and the way said in john 14 16 i will
[18:41] pray the father
[18:43] and he shall give you another comforter
[18:47] that he may abide with you forever
[18:50] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[18:52] cannot receive
[18:54] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[18:56] him but ye know him
[18:58] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[19:01] you
[19:02] amen
[19:04] says in verse 12 blessed art thou o lord
[19:08] teach me thy statutes
[19:11] and the way said in john 14
[19:14] 26 and the comforter
[19:16] which is the holy ghost
[19:18] whom the father will send in my name he
[19:21] shall teach you all things
[19:24] and bring all things to your remembrance
[19:26] whatsoever i have said unto you
[19:31] in verse
[19:33] 13 it says with my lips have i declared
[19:37] all the judgments of thy mouth
[19:40] and the way said in john 15 7 if ye
[19:43] abide in me
[19:44] and my words abide in you ye shall ask
[19:47] what ye will
[19:49] and it shall be done unto you speaking
[19:52] his word
[19:55] verse 14 i have rejoiced in the way of
[19:57] thy testimonies
[19:59] as much as in all riches
[20:02] and the way said in john 15 11 these
[20:04] things have i spoken unto you that my
[20:07] joy might remain in you and that your
[20:09] joy might be full
[20:11] just beautifully paralleling
[20:14] the example of having a relationship
[20:16] with the word
[20:18] not being
[20:20] you know
[20:21] disciplining yourself according to the
[20:23] scriptures but there's a relationship
[20:25] here
[20:26] the word is more than a
[20:29] collection of books or books or tapes or
[20:31] whatever
[20:33] there's got to be a relationship there
[20:35] to cleanse
[20:36] your way
[20:39] wherewithal shall a young man cleanse
[20:41] his way by taking heed
[20:44] according to thy word
[20:48] you know it's just a beautiful example
[20:50] to me as i was reading through this is
[20:52] just
[20:53] you know i'm grateful
[20:54] personally that
[20:56] there's a way to get leadership
[20:58] right there's a way to get clarity
[21:00] there's a way to get guidance
[21:02] in this probably the most confusing hour
[21:07] you know we haven't been left without a
[21:09] word
[21:10] we haven't been left without
[21:13] guidance it's him who's with us to open
[21:16] the scriptures
[21:18] to talk with us along the way just as he
[21:21] did on the road to emmaus
[21:23] you know i pray as we read this little
[21:25] section of psalm 119 this morning we're
[21:27] just going to read these eight verses
[21:28] starting in verse nine
[21:30] first of all that we see the mirror of
[21:32] ourself and that we see jesus in the
[21:35] word but second that we have that
[21:37] relationship
[21:38] not just with a book
[21:40] but with the word talking with us along
[21:43] the way to help cleanse our way
[21:46] wherewithal shall a young man cleanse
[21:48] his way let's just read those verses
[21:50] together starting in
[21:52] verse 9
[21:53] wherewith all shall a young man cleanse
[21:56] his way
[21:57] by taking heed thereto according to thy
[22:00] word with my whole heart have i sought
[22:02] thee oh let me not wander from thy
[22:05] commandments
[22:06] thy word have i hid in my heart that i
[22:09] might not sin against thee blessed art
[22:11] thou o lord teach me thy statutes with
[22:15] my lips have i declared all the
[22:17] judgments of thy mouth i have rejoiced
[22:20] in the way of thy testimonies as much as
[22:22] in all riches
[22:24] i will meditate in thy precepts and have
[22:26] respect unto thy ways i will delight
[22:29] myself in thy statutes i will not forget
[22:32] thy word amen
[22:41] amen god bless you may have your seats
[22:43] man let's sing when i see the blood i'll
[22:45] pass over you amen

[46:22] amen god bless you let's open our bibles
[46:25] again to the verse that we've
[46:30] read so many times here
[46:33] in romans the 8th chapter
[46:36] i believe it's the 11th verse
[46:51] yeah and you certainly
[46:56] this scripture gives us a lot of hope
[46:59] and it also gives us exactly what it is
[47:02] that we should desire
[47:04] amen
[47:05] but if
[47:07] the spirit of him that raised up jesus
[47:10] from
[47:11] the dead
[47:13] dwell in you

[47:24] in you heavenly father we ask you to
[47:27] bless your word to us in your precious
[47:29] and holy name we pray this morning amen
[47:33] amen god as you may be seated this
[47:36] morning
[47:41] you know i have a little something on my
[47:43] heart and i i don't know exactly
[47:46] how to
[47:49] go about
[47:50] uh
[47:52] expressing it this morning i've
[47:54] i i've jotted down some notes you know
[47:58] this is what my notes look like and
[48:00] and and it's just an idea that hold my
[48:04] thought this morning and so
[48:09] i i was going to play a little portion
[48:11] of a message this morning to tie it in
[48:13] but
[48:14] i may just visit and then
[48:17] play that little portion at the end of
[48:19] service i i like us to hear the voice
[48:22] i really do i believe it has a positive
[48:25] effect
[48:26] on it sometimes you don't even realize
[48:28] it but there's just
[48:29] something about the voice and
[48:32] um you know i was fellowship with
[48:35] brother andrew the other day at lunch
[48:36] and
[48:38] and this was on my heart and i began to
[48:42] talk about it
[48:44] but you know we've been listening to
[48:46] this wonderful message
[48:48] called it is the rising of the sun
[48:52] and we know that we were talking in this
[48:55] message about how there had to be
[48:58] something that came
[49:01] in our day
[49:03] like it was in type so god did
[49:06] everything in type
[49:08] he in the old testament
[49:10] it was the shadow
[49:12] of things that were going to come
[49:15] so
[49:16] how many have you ever seen a telephone
[49:18] pole shadow
[49:21] somebody what how some of you out in the
[49:22] woods somewhere where they've got
[49:24] telephone oh that's right this is a
[49:26] whole brand new generation they have
[49:28] cell phones how many have seen a cell
[49:30] phone tower
[49:33] all right well us old people had
[49:35] telephone poles
[49:37] and in the morning you would look and
[49:39] the telephone pole would have a great
[49:41] big long shadow
[49:43] and all you would see is the shadow
[49:45] and you look at the shadow and you could
[49:48] see by the shadow
[49:50] it was a telephone pole
[49:53] but as the sun rose and the sun became
[49:56] brighter the shadow shrunk
[50:00] right and finally there was no
[50:03] shadow that told you it was the
[50:05] telephone pole
[50:07] the telephone pole itself
[50:10] was telling you that it was a telephone
[50:13] pole
[50:15] so the shadow gave way to reality that's
[50:18] right
[50:20] and so
[50:21] when you look uh
[50:23] back at the old testament
[50:25] it was
[50:26] it was the shadow
[50:29] and types of things to come
[50:32] so if they and that's what jesus scolded
[50:35] the scribes and the pharisees about he
[50:37] said if you would have known the
[50:39] scriptures
[50:41] and there was if you would have known
[50:43] what to look for
[50:45] if you have known the promise if you had
[50:47] known what to look for
[50:49] if you would have really read them
[50:52] for what that they said
[50:54] and trying to build yourself the system
[50:57] instead of burdening the people instead
[51:00] of turning my house into a a den of
[51:04] thieves uh could be before rising
[51:07] yourself up and sitting in the high
[51:09] places and all the corruption that went
[51:12] on he said if you would have just looked
[51:15] at this word
[51:17] and understood the promise of it
[51:20] and seeing the word he says search the
[51:23] scriptures because in them you think you
[51:26] have life but they are which were the
[51:29] shadow
[51:30] that was testifying of me so they could
[51:33] see the types they sat there and read
[51:36] right in the scriptures
[51:38] just the curtain was rant and just the
[51:41] scriptures that they were reading were
[51:43] being fulfilled up on delgado at the
[51:46] same exact time
[51:50] but they failed they failed to
[51:53] see
[51:54] the word of god revealed
[51:58] for
[51:59] the day that they were living in so they
[52:02] they didn't even see the shadow
[52:04] they tried to create a light
[52:08] and artificial light never works
[52:12] the only light that we've got to walk by
[52:15] is the light of god's word and and god
[52:19] does that by revelation so we understand
[52:22] that he gave a type and in this message
[52:25] brother brahm takes the type of the
[52:26] sheep offering
[52:28] of how that it was shown to the people
[52:31] that it was something that would be
[52:33] waived and then uh and then we
[52:36] understood that we've came down to our
[52:38] day
[52:39] and
[52:41] and and we recognized that that
[52:44] that life of the resurrection
[52:47] was waved over
[52:50] the people
[52:52] and they didn't recognize it in fact
[52:55] they rejected it and crucified them
[52:58] and because of that
[53:00] this gospel has come to the gentiles
[53:04] and so if i could say this a new crop
[53:08] was raised up
[53:11] something now was planted it wasn't
[53:15] the planning of the 12 tribes of israel
[53:18] it wasn't the planning of the menorah
[53:21] and of
[53:23] worship and and and going back to the
[53:26] things that
[53:28] of old this was a new exodus
[53:32] this was a new beginning it was a new
[53:35] life it was a coming out of the law
[53:38] into grace because something had been
[53:40] waived over and and and came to maturity
[53:45] and that's what he was jesus was the
[53:47] maturity of the old testament he was
[53:50] what everything the law was talking
[53:53] about
[53:54] and and jesus kept
[53:58] now maybe not in the eyes of man
[54:02] because they said oh you didn't wash
[54:04] your hands and you didn't do this and
[54:06] you heal on the sabbath and and
[54:10] you know and just nitpicking and
[54:12] everything but
[54:14] he fulfilled
[54:16] every shot in every tittle of the law he
[54:19] said search the scriptures because in
[54:21] them you think you have eternal life but
[54:24] they are which testified of me they were
[54:26] the shadow of me
[54:30] and so we we went through that and so uh
[54:33] we see from that that we definitely
[54:37] want to be aware
[54:40] and and so uh you know i was thinking of
[54:43] a title
[54:45] for
[54:46] my thought
[54:47] this morning and
[54:50] i i thought i would call it the
[54:53] the
[54:53] the battle
[54:55] of the voices the battle of voices
[54:58] the working of the quickening power i
[55:02] thought that was a good title
[55:05] you know what i mean i don't know if i
[55:06] can put the substance in it but like
[55:09] someone said if i can't
[55:11] do it i might as well have a good title
[55:13] huh
[55:14] but
[55:15] and and so
[55:17] we we understand that god has a way of
[55:20] working
[55:22] and
[55:23] and
[55:24] so
[55:25] that's the way that god always done he
[55:27] always has used prophets
[55:29] he's always used seers
[55:32] and seers can see
[55:37] and foretell
[55:39] what's coming
[55:41] and so as we were sitting there and i
[55:43] was
[55:44] thinking on the thing i just
[55:47] taken back
[55:49] as i've been reading this message and
[55:52] and listening and it's nice to have
[55:54] leslie back with us
[55:55] so anyway that makes me happier
[55:58] uh but as
[56:00] as i've been listening it just seems
[56:02] like
[56:03] i keep rolling back over these other
[56:06] thoughts that brother branham is
[56:08] bringing out in this message and i
[56:11] marveled at how that he places it
[56:14] together how he's in the beginning he
[56:16] talks about the sun
[56:18] drawing the the natural seed
[56:21] and then he talks about the s-o-n uh
[56:24] drawing the seed and he lays all that
[56:28] out there and he he goes back over it
[56:30] then of course he talks about the little
[56:32] eagle and and i began to just catch up
[56:36] something in my heart
[56:37] and i saw it like this if i could say it
[56:42] it just appeared to me i'm not talking
[56:44] about in the form of a vision but in in
[56:47] a mental uh uh
[56:51] visualization
[56:52] you know what i mean i could just
[56:54] visualize it
[56:56] as i visualized it and dwell on it it
[56:59] just became like so real to me i saw the
[57:02] prophet of god standing on top of a tall
[57:04] building
[57:06] or like a mountain
[57:08] and he could see
[57:12] know what i mean he was a seer
[57:14] he could he could see
[57:16] and and again we recognize it is that
[57:20] that he was the first fruit
[57:23] of the gentile church that came to
[57:26] maturity amen amen you know he wasn't
[57:30] caught away
[57:31] in
[57:32] denominationalism
[57:34] he wasn't caught away in trying to build
[57:37] the system he wasn't caught away in fact
[57:40] if you look at his ministry
[57:42] the power and the influence of his
[57:45] ministry and then look at the houses he
[57:48] lived in
[57:51] looked at the car he drove
[57:54] look at where he stayed
[57:57] they said there was one time i've heard
[57:59] the story that
[58:01] that he was staying at
[58:04] a certain hotel and he just thought it
[58:06] was too nice
[58:08] you know i mean he didn't want the
[58:10] people
[58:11] to have the wrong
[58:14] idea
[58:15] you know what i mean now i want you to
[58:17] see when you look around and you see
[58:20] what is every time you turn around
[58:22] there's a scandal because there's some
[58:24] television preacher that's uh stashing
[58:27] millions of dollars i think just down
[58:29] here in the uh
[58:32] one of these local churches down south
[58:34] here they were doing a remodel and they
[58:36] tore out a bathroom wall it was stacked
[58:38] full of cash
[58:40] because anybody checked the bathroom
[58:42] walls you know
[58:45] but but look at
[58:47] look at
[58:49] the example
[58:51] you understand he made statements like
[58:54] like the gospel didn't belong on
[58:56] television
[59:01] and we saw in him
[59:03] in the way that he lived the way he
[59:06] conducted himself
[59:08] how dedicated that he was to the cause
[59:11] of the gospel
[59:13] how true he was
[59:15] to the scriptures
[59:18] it didn't matter
[59:20] what the voices were
[59:22] it didn't matter what the influence was
[59:25] that was one of the definitions and the
[59:29] way of a true prophet a true prophet
[59:32] stayed with god's word he stayed with
[59:35] what god told him and what god
[59:38] instructed him to do with and so a lot
[59:42] of times we hear things but
[59:44] when you compare them
[59:47] you understand when you compare the life
[59:51] you you saw the humility
[59:54] and you saw the simplicity
[59:57] and then he and he and he speaks to us a
[1:00:00] message he says that god's hidden
[1:00:02] simplicity he kid in humility he doesn't
[1:00:05] come to be educated
[1:00:08] he says if you're not careful education
[1:00:10] takes you farther away from god
[1:00:14] and so we saw in him such an example
[1:00:19] and and and somebody that was so true
[1:00:22] and yet
[1:00:26] seemingly in the eyes of man on his own
[1:00:32] now it wasn't on his own because we know
[1:00:34] who was doing it
[1:00:35] but without denomination affiliation
[1:00:38] without joining any organization
[1:00:42] could just by the very essence of his
[1:00:45] ministry and how that had unfolded how
[1:00:48] he went to georgie carter's how he went
[1:00:50] down to the church and how good he went
[1:00:53] and that woman up there on the
[1:00:55] hill that was sick remember the story of
[1:00:58] the life talking to the old man
[1:01:01] just by the life that he lived
[1:01:05] and and what was
[1:01:07] radiated from him
[1:01:11] that his ministry ended up going around
[1:01:13] the world seven times
[1:01:16] millions of people heard the gospel
[1:01:20] thousands upon thousands of people were
[1:01:23] healed
[1:01:25] hearts were discerned everything just so
[1:01:28] miraculously moved without ever being
[1:01:32] part of a system
[1:01:35] that's right
[1:01:36] what transpired in his life transpired
[1:01:39] because he had a personal
[1:01:42] relationship with the lord
[1:01:45] now i know that
[1:01:48] he had a ministry
[1:01:50] and we know that an angel appeared to
[1:01:52] him
[1:01:53] and told him what would transpire told
[1:01:56] them that he would preach the king's and
[1:01:58] potentates but it wasn't a man-made
[1:02:01] system that brought that to pass
[1:02:05] it was an individual relationship that
[1:02:08] he had with obedience to the word of god
[1:02:12] and his recognition and acceptance
[1:02:17] of his
[1:02:18] calling now i want to
[1:02:22] say that again to us this morning
[1:02:25] with the recognition
[1:02:27] and acceptance
[1:02:29] of his calling
[1:02:32] each one of us in here this morning has
[1:02:35] been called
[1:02:40] we have been called in this day
[1:02:43] to manifest
[1:02:46] the spoken word or the prophesied word
[1:02:50] for our day
[1:02:52] okay i think mike touched on a little
[1:02:56] bit on his psalm that it's not our
[1:02:58] righteousness
[1:03:00] and it isn't us trying to look at the
[1:03:02] word of god and say i'm going to live it
[1:03:05] right
[1:03:06] we are called
[1:03:10] and you if you don't accept that calling
[1:03:14] you can fall into the system
[1:03:18] of the message of the hour
[1:03:21] and the message is not a system
[1:03:24] but man takes
[1:03:28] everything it's man's nature
[1:03:32] you know to try to organize it you say
[1:03:35] well how come this hasn't organized i'll
[1:03:38] tell you why it hasn't organized because
[1:03:40] nobody can agree on anything
[1:03:47] you know i mean every time somebody
[1:03:49] wants to come up and have influence and
[1:03:51] spread that influence there's something
[1:03:54] in us
[1:03:56] that's right you understand that the
[1:03:58] minute we start going down ground that's
[1:04:00] not right there's an automatic repulsion
[1:04:04] in us
[1:04:06] because we are designed
[1:04:12] let me just finish my
[1:04:14] my thing before i go to that point
[1:04:17] so the problem of god's on this building
[1:04:19] and he's seeing what he's seeing
[1:04:22] now we're not there
[1:04:25] we're not on top of that building
[1:04:27] and we don't see
[1:04:29] what he sees
[1:04:33] we are down here
[1:04:36] looking up
[1:04:39] at where he's at
[1:04:43] and we hear the things he's saying
[1:04:47] but we don't really see what he's seeing
[1:04:54] you can't
[1:04:57] because god's designed things in a
[1:05:00] certain way
[1:05:02] he designed a prophet to be a what
[1:05:05] a seer
[1:05:07] so he's seeing
[1:05:09] so as he sees he's designed us a certain
[1:05:12] way
[1:05:14] and and god has
[1:05:16] designed
[1:05:17] in his plan
[1:05:19] he designed things to come forth he did
[1:05:22] everything in the beginning he always
[1:05:25] designed things by starting in seed form
[1:05:31] you say why did he do that
[1:05:33] he did that because god is an
[1:05:35] evolutionist
[1:05:38] you ever heard the theory of evolution
[1:05:41] where did they get that from
[1:05:45] darwin just one day didn't come up and
[1:05:48] say
[1:05:48] oh the view theory of evolution
[1:05:53] no
[1:05:54] god
[1:05:55] is an evolutionist
[1:05:58] he started with void and nothing right
[1:06:01] and then he evolved it and then he said
[1:06:04] let there be and then he evolved it and
[1:06:06] let there be so how did it evolve
[1:06:10] it evolved by the spoken word
[1:06:13] it evolved by god amen evolving it
[1:06:16] that's right by taking it and evolving
[1:06:19] it by his word
[1:06:22] so it didn't start there
[1:06:25] now if i would have done it i would have
[1:06:27] just created everything boost
[1:06:32] but i i wouldn't have had a very
[1:06:34] long-range plan would i
[1:06:36] most of us don't have long-range plans
[1:06:39] i'll tell you the biggest
[1:06:41] enemy to a long-range plan is a credit
[1:06:44] card
[1:06:47] you say brother mcgregor that's not very
[1:06:49] spiritual yeah you know what people do
[1:06:51] they live for the moment
[1:06:55] they want something
[1:06:56] they can't afford it
[1:06:58] they really shouldn't be there they
[1:07:00] shouldn't waste their money on it they
[1:07:02] have um other obligations but
[1:07:04] man
[1:07:05] this thing is awesome
[1:07:08] just pull it out
[1:07:13] get what you want
[1:07:15] and you've just taken 22
[1:07:18] out of your income
[1:07:20] you have no idea what effect
[1:07:23] that momentarily
[1:07:25] action has on your life your family life
[1:07:29] your finances
[1:07:31] this guy this can take you from making
[1:07:34] twenty five dollars an hour to making
[1:07:36] ten dollars an hour
[1:07:39] because that's all you're left with
[1:07:43] now there are certain things you have to
[1:07:44] have that you can't get any other way
[1:07:47] like houses and cars
[1:07:50] let me tell you
[1:07:52] buy your house and your car
[1:07:55] don't get in debt
[1:07:57] for anything else
[1:08:00] it's a good discipline
[1:08:02] it's good advice
[1:08:05] and if you are in debt don't be a
[1:08:08] task master
[1:08:09] to debt
[1:08:13] that can affect your thinking
[1:08:16] that can affect your decision-making
[1:08:20] debt
[1:08:21] credit allows you to live beyond your
[1:08:24] means and now have another task master
[1:08:28] have another voice in your life
[1:08:34] plus it's good to get out of the habit
[1:08:37] of
[1:08:38] to everything that calls you every voice
[1:08:41] that comes up that the voice of the
[1:08:44] restaurant you know it's hard sometimes
[1:08:46] and and
[1:08:48] and you know i like to go out with
[1:08:50] people and i like to to to
[1:08:54] take people out but i don't like to take
[1:08:56] people out if they can't afford to go
[1:08:58] out
[1:08:59] so a lot of times i'll help buy their
[1:09:01] meals because i know they want to be
[1:09:02] there but they can't afford to be there
[1:09:05] but sometimes you've got to have the
[1:09:07] discipline to say no
[1:09:09] you've got to have the discipline to say
[1:09:11] i'm not going to be drawn down this road
[1:09:13] i'm not going to be
[1:09:15] be moved by my desire by the temporary
[1:09:18] thing i'm going to have a longer range
[1:09:21] plan
[1:09:22] and if i could say it this way god has
[1:09:25] always had a long-range plan
[1:09:27] [Music]
[1:09:29] and he unfolds that plan
[1:09:32] he evolves to that plant he moves
[1:09:35] towards that plan
[1:09:37] very
[1:09:38] meticulously and right on time and he
[1:09:41] schedules everything to fall in place
[1:09:44] history events
[1:09:46] wars rumors of wars everything is
[1:09:50] working together in a beautiful plan for
[1:09:53] god to bring to pass his word
[1:09:57] now believe it or not you're a part of
[1:09:59] that
[1:10:02] amen you're a part of that
[1:10:06] you know what i mean
[1:10:08] and some of us that have worked at
[1:10:10] construction and things like that if
[1:10:12] something doesn't fit you get the file
[1:10:15] out
[1:10:17] you know you can make it fit
[1:10:21] hey we have an expression what this
[1:10:23] needs is a bigger hammer
[1:10:26] you know what i mean and uh
[1:10:28] and so you you you're going you got and
[1:10:32] god's like that he's going to make
[1:10:34] things fit
[1:10:36] and so
[1:10:37] the problem of god sitting up here
[1:10:40] and remember he is the voice of god
[1:10:45] so we're talking about the battle of
[1:10:46] voices he is the voice of god
[1:10:49] so he is going to speak
[1:10:53] what he sees
[1:10:56] by sun drive tying in diverse manners
[1:10:59] god spoke to us by his prophets
[1:11:01] what did they do they they saw visions
[1:11:05] they had dreams
[1:11:07] god moved on them they said things they
[1:11:10] didn't even know what they were saying
[1:11:15] can you imagine when they walked up that
[1:11:17] day and said hey you said a virgin shall
[1:11:19] conceive
[1:11:21] i did
[1:11:23] yeah
[1:11:24] what was that he was under the
[1:11:26] inspiration you know what i mean he
[1:11:29] maybe didn't even understand what he
[1:11:31] said
[1:11:32] but it it was the great evolver the
[1:11:35] great voice
[1:11:37] so god does everything by his spoken
[1:11:41] word the spoken word is the original
[1:11:45] seed not the man's interpreted word but
[1:11:49] the spoken word was the original seed
[1:11:51] and god has spoke everything now so he
[1:11:54] pleases a prophet
[1:11:57] and i just in my mind i saw in this
[1:11:59] building and i saw him speaking what he
[1:12:02] was seeing
[1:12:05] well he's speaking this in 50s
[1:12:09] you know and and the the 50s and 60s
[1:12:13] he's speaking these things that he's
[1:12:14] seeing and and now
[1:12:17] we're just starting to see some of the
[1:12:19] things that he saw
[1:12:22] because we caught up
[1:12:25] with the prophecy
[1:12:30] amen
[1:12:31] now the minute is spoken it's real
[1:12:36] but we finally caught up with the
[1:12:38] prophecy
[1:12:40] and so we nobody understood what brother
[1:12:42] branham was saying
[1:12:46] he talked about the corruption that was
[1:12:48] coming into the church he talked about
[1:12:50] the corruption that was coming into
[1:12:52] hollywood evangelism he talked about the
[1:12:55] money and the corruption and the scandal
[1:12:58] and the big houses and the big
[1:13:00] ministries and
[1:13:02] and the money and building all those
[1:13:04] great things that what's going on he
[1:13:07] talked about all those things but they
[1:13:08] hadn't caught up with it yet
[1:13:12] because they didn't understand that he
[1:13:14] was up someplace
[1:13:16] that they they couldn't understand they
[1:13:18] couldn't recognize because all that they
[1:13:21] could hear were the voices that were of
[1:13:25] the present time
[1:13:27] the present moment
[1:13:29] how many of us really make decisions
[1:13:32] sometimes wondering how it's going to
[1:13:34] affect our eternal destiny
[1:13:38] i'm not very good at that
[1:13:43] you say well the scripture says take no
[1:13:45] thought for tomorrow
[1:13:47] no you've got to understand that
[1:13:48] scripture doesn't
[1:13:50] say take no thought to the moral he says
[1:13:52] place tomorrow
[1:13:55] in the hands of him who is running your
[1:13:59] day today
[1:14:03] if he has control of your day-to-day you
[1:14:06] can trust that you don't have to worry
[1:14:09] about tomorrow because he has today
[1:14:12] and if he has today he is an
[1:14:14] evolutionist he will evolve you to
[1:14:18] tomorrow
[1:14:22] connect what we're doing
[1:14:23] so as he sat on this
[1:14:26] mountain what he saw
[1:14:28] he began to speak what he saw
[1:14:32] and we're down here looking up so
[1:14:34] there's only one way that he can get to
[1:14:37] us what he's seeing
[1:14:41] and that's to speak it
[1:14:45] you understand that
[1:14:47] faith cometh by hearing
[1:14:49] hearing by the word of god
[1:14:52] what is another word for faith
[1:14:54] revelation what is revelation something
[1:14:58] that has been previously hid
[1:15:00] and now is revealed or seen amen
[1:15:06] so
[1:15:07] we're
[1:15:08] we're
[1:15:09] talking about
[1:15:10] the how the quickening
[1:15:13] power works
[1:15:14] and so he he speaks it
[1:15:18] so that's what he does he starts
[1:15:20] speaking it
[1:15:22] and then god allows man
[1:15:25] to invent a tape recorder
[1:15:31] for his message
[1:15:34] amen now that's what it was invented for
[1:15:38] america all right i know they put
[1:15:40] everything else on it in the world they
[1:15:42] put all kinds of other voices on it
[1:15:44] didn't it
[1:15:45] so the minute that was invented it
[1:15:48] became the battle of the voices
[1:15:50] right right that's good right everybody
[1:15:53] was out there radio preachers were out
[1:15:56] there everybody was out there's all
[1:15:58] kinds of voices and and we've watched
[1:16:01] the voice evolve haven't we we've
[1:16:03] watched it evolve from for real to real
[1:16:06] we've watched it go to
[1:16:08] eight tracks anybody in here old enough
[1:16:10] to have an eight track and there's a
[1:16:11] very few i got you old guys
[1:16:15] cassettes on and on and cds and i guess
[1:16:19] now i don't the world's digital and
[1:16:22] and it's satellite and all those things
[1:16:26] because it's evolving right
[1:16:30] and why is it evolving
[1:16:32] its voice is evolving
[1:16:36] it's trying to get its message out
[1:16:39] that that's what it's doing and here's
[1:16:41] here's why
[1:16:43] because
[1:16:44] when god made everything he put it in
[1:16:47] seed form
[1:16:50] so god designed
[1:16:53] us
[1:16:55] the seed of god he designed us to hear
[1:16:59] the voice of god
[1:17:01] amen amen now
[1:17:04] nobody else hears the voice of god
[1:17:08] except the seed
[1:17:10] that had god has designed
[1:17:13] with the
[1:17:14] receiver to receive it
[1:17:19] so this great seer
[1:17:22] is up here
[1:17:24] and he's seeing things
[1:17:26] and he's speaking what he's seeing but
[1:17:30] now that has to if i could use this in
[1:17:34] our thinking has to come down from the
[1:17:37] mountain
[1:17:39] from the from the
[1:17:40] from the the high places
[1:17:43] and it's got to come down and it's got
[1:17:46] to make contact
[1:17:48] with the seed
[1:17:52] because the seed is designed
[1:17:55] to hear it
[1:17:59] it's designed to receive it
[1:18:03] but when you receive it
[1:18:05] do you automatically go up to the top of
[1:18:08] the mountain
[1:18:10] or the top of the building
[1:18:13] no
[1:18:15] because what good would it do you to be
[1:18:18] on top of the
[1:18:20] mountain if you can see
[1:18:22] what good would it do to you to be
[1:18:24] caught up
[1:18:26] if you can't see
[1:18:30] and and so many times can i and i'm not
[1:18:33] critical i'm just
[1:18:35] you know i i i don't try to preach to
[1:18:37] the world i i don't try to have a
[1:18:39] worldwide ministry i've put in my heart
[1:18:42] a long time ago if god wants me to be
[1:18:45] here and pastor whoever he brings into
[1:18:48] the fold i want to do my best to tell
[1:18:51] them the word of god
[1:18:53] i don't have a universal message william
[1:18:56] branham had the universal message
[1:19:00] all right
[1:19:01] i don't have the explanation
[1:19:03] for the message the holy spirit has the
[1:19:07] explanation of the message
[1:19:09] we are here to grow as a body and to let
[1:19:13] our light shine
[1:19:15] and and not to put our candle under a
[1:19:18] bushel basket but do exactly what the
[1:19:21] prophet of god said he said let it shine
[1:19:24] in your neighborhood let it shine in
[1:19:26] your community let it shine in your city
[1:19:31] i don't know how many guys i've known in
[1:19:33] my life that want to go overseas they
[1:19:35] want to go overseas and they haven't
[1:19:36] even talked to their neighbor
[1:19:41] right
[1:19:42] you know
[1:19:44] but we won't go there
[1:19:46] so but i've already been there so i
[1:19:48] guess i can leave
[1:19:50] so there's something that
[1:19:53] that god's created you
[1:19:56] so you're not going to fly all the way
[1:19:59] to the top and see everything that the
[1:20:02] prophet of god saw
[1:20:05] because god doesn't work that way
[1:20:09] he always works from seed up
[1:20:13] you understand he always works from
[1:20:16] from the inside
[1:20:19] out
[1:20:20] so the first thing that he's got to do
[1:20:22] is he's got to quicken the seed
[1:20:26] he's got to bring the seed to life
[1:20:33] you hear something
[1:20:35] you're designed to hear it
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:39] every seed
[1:20:41] will bring forth of its kind
[1:20:44] so if every seed
[1:20:48] brings forth of its kind
[1:20:50] and a seed can only be brought forth by
[1:20:54] a voice
[1:20:58] satan's only a perverter
[1:21:00] he's not a designer
[1:21:02] if god designed that if that his seed
[1:21:06] would be brought forth by a voice and he
[1:21:08] designs that every seed would be brought
[1:21:11] forth by a voice or brought to life or
[1:21:15] impregnated by a voice then every seed
[1:21:19] has a voice
[1:21:25] even
[1:21:26] if
[1:21:26] even dark seed
[1:21:31] has a voice
[1:21:34] but you have a voice
[1:21:37] that speaks to the seed that's in you
[1:21:41] and he's not
[1:21:45] he's not instantly
[1:21:47] changing you
[1:21:49] because that's not what he is
[1:21:52] he's an evolutionist
[1:21:57] i know that word sounds terrible but
[1:21:59] that's what he said he was
[1:22:02] in other words god evolves
[1:22:04] maybe i could use this other word god is
[1:22:06] a grower
[1:22:08] why
[1:22:10] he's a husband
[1:22:12] sure
[1:22:15] he digs up he dungs he has fruit he
[1:22:18] grows he doesn't
[1:22:21] he doesn't instantly
[1:22:23] do this and instantly do that
[1:22:27] so
[1:22:28] he
[1:22:29] first of all he's got to come into your
[1:22:32] life
[1:22:33] and he's got to
[1:22:36] germinate the seed
[1:22:39] that's in you
[1:22:41] now that's pre-designed
[1:22:45] if you if we can rest in that
[1:22:48] this has been pre-designed
[1:22:50] at the whatever time he determined
[1:22:53] he was going to bring to life in me the
[1:22:56] seed
[1:22:58] and that seed just all of a sudden comes
[1:23:02] to life
[1:23:03] and it it
[1:23:05] the antenna goes up
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:10] i don't think there's anybody in here
[1:23:11] that's old enough to remember that show
[1:23:14] but yeah
[1:23:16] and the antennas come up and you catch
[1:23:18] the word you're hearing a voice you
[1:23:21] never heard before
[1:23:23] and you're attracted
[1:23:26] to that voice that's right there's
[1:23:28] something about that voice
[1:23:33] i love hearing the prophet of god's
[1:23:34] voice
[1:23:36] i mean the minute i hear it there's a
[1:23:38] peace that comes over me
[1:23:42] even when he's
[1:23:44] you know convicting me
[1:23:46] and and pointing out my mistakes and
[1:23:49] planning out my lack of dedication
[1:23:52] there's some comfort
[1:23:53] that takes place in my heart when i hear
[1:23:57] that voice because i know i am hearing
[1:24:00] the voice of god amen
[1:24:04] i've been designed to hear the voice of
[1:24:06] god amen
[1:24:10] now there's other voices that are
[1:24:12] battling for that spot
[1:24:16] and just like every other seed
[1:24:19] we could pick we could pick
[1:24:21] music we could pick sports we could pick
[1:24:25] anything there's seeds out there
[1:24:28] that manifest all them spirits
[1:24:32] and when you get when those voices of
[1:24:35] the world speak out
[1:24:37] they bring to life
[1:24:39] those
[1:24:40] seeds
[1:24:44] and then maybe a young child he'll he'll
[1:24:46] he'll be a young
[1:24:48] person what maybe they call a protege
[1:24:52] or something and that voice begins to
[1:24:54] speak to him and pretty soon they
[1:24:56] dedicate their whole life to baseball
[1:25:00] you know they eat drink sleep baseball
[1:25:02] they throw the ball they go down at the
[1:25:04] batting cage and everything there's a
[1:25:06] voice
[1:25:09] the voice of
[1:25:10] baseball you understand and they hear
[1:25:13] that voice
[1:25:15] and as that voice speaks to them they
[1:25:18] keep evolving
[1:25:20] into a ball player
[1:25:25] they start out in little league or
[1:25:27] t-ball
[1:25:29] you know and the kid don't want to play
[1:25:31] t-ball
[1:25:34] he walks up there with the bat in his
[1:25:35] hand he looks at the ball and the dad's
[1:25:37] scoring hit the ball
[1:25:41] what's wrong with you
[1:25:44] hit the ball i told you that how to hit
[1:25:46] the ball
[1:25:49] and you sit back no this is not
[1:25:54] this is crazy
[1:25:57] what's happening
[1:25:58] that person's under the influence of a
[1:26:00] voice
[1:26:02] he wants his kid to be a ball player
[1:26:06] he wants he wants he wants them to shine
[1:26:09] they have all kinds of psychology for it
[1:26:12] but it's just nothing but the devil
[1:26:14] that's right
[1:26:16] i've seen guys jump over fences and run
[1:26:19] out and punch out the umpire because the
[1:26:21] umpire called this kid out at second
[1:26:23] base get a life
[1:26:28] no
[1:26:30] it's sick
[1:26:32] and you know why it's so sick now
[1:26:35] because there's more voices out there
[1:26:37] than there's ever been and these voices
[1:26:39] are pointing to the wrong thing
[1:26:42] and why are the voices out there the
[1:26:45] voices are out there to manifest the
[1:26:48] seed that is in them because every seed
[1:26:52] will bring forth of its kind and this is
[1:26:54] manifesting time
[1:27:00] so there's voices out there that are
[1:27:03] looking for
[1:27:04] that seed
[1:27:07] that they can attach to
[1:27:11] and manifest
[1:27:13] oh that should be raising some questions
[1:27:15] shouldn't it what seeds in me
[1:27:17] what voice am i listening to
[1:27:23] you say well do i pursue a career or do
[1:27:25] i just go lock myself up in a room
[1:27:28] and listen to tapes
[1:27:31] do both
[1:27:33] you'll be successful
[1:27:39] so there's this battle
[1:27:42] because god's got a way of doing things
[1:27:45] he first of all he germinates
[1:27:48] the seed
[1:27:51] do you understand that
[1:27:52] the seed comes to life
[1:27:56] but the seed
[1:27:57] has got
[1:27:59] to grow
[1:28:02] now this is a tremendous scripture
[1:28:06] in
[1:28:07] hebrews
[1:28:11] 5
[1:28:12] and 8.
[1:28:14] and it it it
[1:28:17] it kind of struck me
[1:28:20] uh
[1:28:21] in the light of this understanding
[1:28:28] and because
[1:28:30] god can't break his plan
[1:28:34] do you understand
[1:28:35] otherwise he can't
[1:28:38] he once he does something
[1:28:41] he's got to continue to do it amen
[1:28:44] right
[1:28:45] so once he started with seed form
[1:28:48] even he had to create in mary
[1:28:53] seed
[1:28:55] he didn't use her egg he had to create
[1:28:57] it but jesus didn't descend down from
[1:29:00] heaven did he
[1:29:03] because that would have been out of the
[1:29:05] plan of god he couldn't have been a
[1:29:07] kinsmen redeemer because that would have
[1:29:09] been out of the plan of god but every
[1:29:12] single one of us in here started in seed
[1:29:15] form
[1:29:16] as a prophet of god sent to the betting
[1:29:18] ground to mother we came forth
[1:29:21] but that's the way that god did it and
[1:29:23] then you've evolved
[1:29:26] right into whatever you are now
[1:29:29] and you are what you are now because of
[1:29:32] the voices that you've heard
[1:29:39] you know what i mean mama put in front
[1:29:41] of you
[1:29:43] a nice salty fish head and she said
[1:29:46] this is good
[1:29:48] that's right and you ate it and you were
[1:29:50] hungry and guess what it was good
[1:29:54] you know
[1:29:56] i had spam
[1:30:00] i had leslie buy some spam the other day
[1:30:03] i'm gonna fry it up eat some spam like i
[1:30:06] did when i was a kid
[1:30:09] here
[1:30:10] you understand you are been molded by
[1:30:12] the voices that you've heard
[1:30:15] that's right
[1:30:17] and we are what we are because of what
[1:30:20] we heard now there's a great
[1:30:21] transformation going place
[1:30:24] on there's something that's evolving
[1:30:27] that's greater than if it's ever been
[1:30:30] and so in hebrews 13
[1:30:33] hebrews 5 8 it says
[1:30:36] though he were a son
[1:30:40] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:30:44] which he suffered
[1:30:46] and being made perfect
[1:30:51] he became the author of eternal
[1:30:54] salvation unto all
[1:30:57] them
[1:30:58] that
[1:31:00] obey him
[1:31:04] my sheep
[1:31:06] hear my voice
[1:31:08] the relationship starts when that seed
[1:31:12] is quickened
[1:31:14] if the the relationship starts of
[1:31:17] obedience
[1:31:19] to the voice
[1:31:22] because the voice has been sent
[1:31:27] from the top of the mountain if i could
[1:31:29] say it this way they're the top of the
[1:31:31] building the voice is being sent to you
[1:31:35] so that you can come up to the top of
[1:31:38] the
[1:31:39] mountain and see what he's been seeing
[1:31:46] but you've he's got to
[1:31:48] evolve you to that
[1:31:51] he's got to bring you to that place by
[1:31:54] obedience to his word that seed has got
[1:31:58] to mature
[1:31:59] it's got to grow
[1:32:01] it's got to attach itself
[1:32:04] with that voice it it's got to it's got
[1:32:07] to uh
[1:32:08] it's it's got to come into a
[1:32:11] relationship
[1:32:13] with that voice that that is what's
[1:32:16] drawing it
[1:32:20] you can't mix it
[1:32:23] that's what lukewarm is
[1:32:26] is trying to serve two masters it's
[1:32:29] trying to serve two voices there's got
[1:32:32] to be something in your life a voice
[1:32:34] that becomes an absolute
[1:32:42] and
[1:32:43] and it can't be secondhand revelation
[1:32:46] right right
[1:32:49] and many times god will put you in a
[1:32:52] circumstance where you hear him tell you
[1:32:55] something you know it's obedient and it
[1:32:58] looks like you're in an impossible
[1:33:00] circumstance
[1:33:02] that's right you're going to offend
[1:33:03] people
[1:33:05] you're you're
[1:33:06] your people's not going to believe you
[1:33:08] then then those other voices start
[1:33:11] coming in it's going to cost you your
[1:33:12] job
[1:33:13] everybody's going to think you're this
[1:33:15] what are you going to do about your
[1:33:17] bills you've got all this credit card
[1:33:19] debt you know i mean you're all the way
[1:33:21] over here and you're in school and and
[1:33:24] what are you going to do about school
[1:33:26] and all the voices come in
[1:33:29] the voice is a compromise
[1:33:32] the battle of the voices
[1:33:35] prophet of god said where does it where
[1:33:37] does that battle take place
[1:33:39] in your mind
[1:33:41] god gives you the weapon which is what
[1:33:44] his word
[1:33:46] his voice
[1:33:49] but if we don't have confidence in that
[1:33:51] voice
[1:33:53] then
[1:33:55] satan appears as an angel of the light
[1:33:58] it he offers all kinds of
[1:34:01] other ways to do things
[1:34:05] he has your own program
[1:34:08] he'll give you a program
[1:34:10] because he wants to bring forth a
[1:34:13] reality
[1:34:15] every
[1:34:16] voice
[1:34:18] is trying to bring forth a reality
[1:34:22] they're trying to make that seed
[1:34:25] what that voice is preaching
[1:34:28] become real
[1:34:36] every voice of the enemy
[1:34:39] every voice that's there every seed
[1:34:42] that's out there is looking just like
[1:34:45] that kid that sits there in this room
[1:34:47] and he's playing his guitar and he's
[1:34:49] listening to all those licks and he's
[1:34:52] sitting in there jamming and doing all
[1:34:54] those things there's a voice that's
[1:34:56] calling him to be a rock star
[1:34:58] he wants to be a rock star that's what
[1:35:00] he wants and pretty soon he's in a
[1:35:02] garage band you know what i mean and
[1:35:05] he's trying to do this and he's doing
[1:35:06] this and pretty soon he's got the look
[1:35:09] you know if somebody he looks like and
[1:35:11] he's emulating somebody and he's talking
[1:35:14] the language and he's in there pretty
[1:35:16] soon he's smoking dope and he's there
[1:35:18] and and there's this voice
[1:35:20] that's calling him to be a rock star and
[1:35:24] and that voice is wanting to make that a
[1:35:27] reality
[1:35:28] for him
[1:35:32] and if he'll submit himself
[1:35:36] to that voice
[1:35:38] and he'll give himself over to that
[1:35:41] spirit and that voice that voice will
[1:35:44] make that a reality
[1:35:49] you think that makes them happy
[1:35:52] they kill themselves by the truckload
[1:35:59] board anything
[1:36:02] the desire to make it a reality
[1:36:08] is there anything we want made real in
[1:36:10] our lives
[1:36:12] what is it that we want to be made real
[1:36:15] in our lives
[1:36:17] we want the works that he did
[1:36:21] that we do also amen we want to see
[1:36:26] i counseled to thee to buy of me
[1:36:29] i sat
[1:36:31] that thou may i see we want to see what
[1:36:34] he was seeing
[1:36:36] we saw the works we want to do the works
[1:36:38] that he's doing
[1:36:41] but if that's not there's only one thing
[1:36:44] that'll keep you from obtaining that is
[1:36:47] if there's another voice
[1:36:50] that's battling for that possession of
[1:36:54] reality
[1:36:57] you know we think being a doctor being a
[1:36:59] lawyer
[1:37:00] or or being successful there's no life
[1:37:03] in that
[1:37:08] i've been in the doctor's office
[1:37:11] i've i've had my doctor in tears just
[1:37:13] talking to me about god and
[1:37:16] and you know how that he lost this and
[1:37:19] how he loved that and
[1:37:21] i'm sure he's good with giving up pills
[1:37:23] and poking me and making me hurt and
[1:37:26] stuff like that but when it comes down
[1:37:28] to something that's really down on the
[1:37:30] inside there's only one thing that meets
[1:37:33] that place and that's the love of god
[1:37:35] shed abroad in our hearts by jesus
[1:37:37] christ
[1:37:40] there's only one thing that's real
[1:37:44] so back to what we're saying god starts
[1:37:46] it that way he starts it in seed form
[1:37:50] he germinates he germinates
[1:37:53] that seed that's in you and and then
[1:37:56] that seed has a thirst
[1:38:02] that seed has a thirst
[1:38:05] it's like
[1:38:06] the eagle if i could express it this way
[1:38:09] to you because uh what i'm trying to say
[1:38:12] i guess this morning is is you've got to
[1:38:14] understand the quickening power
[1:38:17] evolves in you
[1:38:21] it starts on the inside
[1:38:24] and works its way out
[1:38:26] the first thing the seed comes to life
[1:38:29] right
[1:38:30] and then it starts its journey well you
[1:38:33] look at that little eagle
[1:38:36] here's this eagle
[1:38:38] it's in the barnyard right
[1:38:40] but what's the one thing it doesn't know
[1:38:43] it doesn't know
[1:38:45] it's an eagle
[1:38:48] the only thing it knows is it doesn't
[1:38:51] know
[1:38:56] he doesn't know what he really is
[1:38:59] he knows he's different
[1:39:02] he knows there's something about him
[1:39:04] right right
[1:39:05] whether it's on the inside and most of
[1:39:07] the time it's on the inside
[1:39:10] most of the time it's in our mind
[1:39:12] and most of the time of a lot of
[1:39:14] christians i've dealt with through my
[1:39:16] life and my experience bringing people
[1:39:19] to the lord
[1:39:20] that
[1:39:22] difference in their lives has caused
[1:39:24] complexes
[1:39:27] now if you've been blessed to be raised
[1:39:30] in a christian home you ought to thank
[1:39:34] god every day
[1:39:41] when you're not
[1:39:43] and that
[1:39:44] seeds in you you find yourself doing the
[1:39:47] most crazy things you even sit back and
[1:39:49] say what am i doing
[1:39:52] you don't know where you are
[1:39:55] you can't you don't fit there's an empty
[1:39:58] spot inside of you you you you drift and
[1:40:02] aft and nothing's been settled with
[1:40:04] inside you and that's what this guy's
[1:40:06] there he's out there he's eating bugs
[1:40:08] you know what i mean he's eating rock
[1:40:11] music and and
[1:40:13] smoking and drinking yeah you're getting
[1:40:15] garbage you know what i mean loves the
[1:40:17] garbage and all the other chickens
[1:40:20] it's great
[1:40:22] you know what i mean
[1:40:24] and the chickens are going off to the
[1:40:26] slaughterhouse
[1:40:27] you know i mean
[1:40:29] and ended up missing and gone and in
[1:40:32] jail and cracking everything just
[1:40:34] picture the big old chicken yard and all
[1:40:36] of a sudden they come in and they grab
[1:40:38] them and they throw them in the cage
[1:40:40] you know everybody's going to jail
[1:40:42] when i was in that world everybody ended
[1:40:44] him in jail everybody was running from
[1:40:45] the cops
[1:40:48] you know what i meant
[1:40:51] they were getting in wrecks they were
[1:40:52] they were overdosing yeah why couldn't a
[1:40:55] guy sit back and look at the fruits
[1:40:59] and say what's going on around here
[1:41:04] you know what's happening what's really
[1:41:06] going on so that eagle doesn't even know
[1:41:09] it's an eagle
[1:41:12] right it's just up there flying it
[1:41:14] doesn't even know it's an eagle
[1:41:17] and all of a sudden
[1:41:19] it hears a what
[1:41:21] a voice
[1:41:26] and that voice
[1:41:29] identifies and quickens
[1:41:32] something in that
[1:41:34] that little
[1:41:35] uh half chicken
[1:41:38] half eagle
[1:41:40] you say half chicken half eagle yeah
[1:41:43] his inside was eagle but his outside was
[1:41:46] what still
[1:41:48] chicken
[1:41:52] right
[1:41:54] because
[1:41:56] this quickening power
[1:41:58] i'm just gonna jump
[1:42:01] also quickens the what
[1:42:04] the mortal body
[1:42:06] but it it only now knows it's a
[1:42:11] chicken
[1:42:12] so it's half chicken half eagle
[1:42:17] but it doesn't know that
[1:42:19] so all of a sudden the word speaks to it
[1:42:22] and it realizes something comes alive in
[1:42:26] it and it says i don't know what i am
[1:42:29] but i'm not this
[1:42:36] it hurts something it looks up
[1:42:40] right
[1:42:43] and it sees the eagle
[1:42:46] on the mountaintop
[1:42:48] on the top of the building it sees them
[1:42:51] out there and it's heard from him
[1:42:56] but it can't fly yet
[1:43:00] because there's got to be an evolution
[1:43:02] that takes place within the eagle
[1:43:08] you understand that
[1:43:10] this
[1:43:11] eagle is going to have to commit
[1:43:16] to the voice
[1:43:17] in ever to be able to fly out of that
[1:43:21] yard
[1:43:24] because now that mama eagle if you leave
[1:43:27] and listen to the story
[1:43:29] is going to have to instruct
[1:43:33] that
[1:43:35] eaglet
[1:43:36] how to fly
[1:43:39] but what's got to happen inside of
[1:43:42] him first
[1:43:43] the first thing that he has to have is
[1:43:46] then after he realizes there's something
[1:43:49] different then he's got to have the
[1:43:51] desire to fly
[1:43:56] that's right
[1:43:58] doesn't do me any good to say i'm an
[1:44:00] eagle
[1:44:04] do you want to fly no really mama
[1:44:07] come on down here
[1:44:09] have some uh bugs
[1:44:12] have some scratch
[1:44:15] come down here let's go into a cage
[1:44:17] every night
[1:44:18] and into the barnyard
[1:44:21] that eagle what you understand
[1:44:23] that eagle's seen miles
[1:44:26] it seemed beyond the barnyard
[1:44:29] it's seen beyond
[1:44:31] what's temporary
[1:44:34] oh eagles this morning
[1:44:37] we're not looking past our barnyards
[1:44:41] we're not looking into the possibilities
[1:44:44] we're we're not looking into the
[1:44:45] heavenly realms we're not seeing beyond
[1:44:48] our problems
[1:44:49] we're not seen beyond our flesh
[1:44:56] we're not we're not seen beyond our
[1:44:58] condition
[1:45:00] there's got to be a uh uh
[1:45:03] obedience and a transformation
[1:45:06] something working on the inside of us in
[1:45:09] order to to bring us to this place
[1:45:12] that what is promised to us will be
[1:45:15] quickened in the flesh
[1:45:18] philip and stephen they got they they
[1:45:21] were so
[1:45:22] full of the spirit that stephen was so
[1:45:25] full of the spirit because it was on the
[1:45:28] inside of him
[1:45:31] and if he was finally convinced
[1:45:35] and sold out
[1:45:38] a hundred percent he denied every other
[1:45:41] voice
[1:45:44] and he's when they were fixing the
[1:45:45] stoneham
[1:45:48] he just did nothing but tell him the
[1:45:50] truth
[1:45:52] you're blind
[1:45:54] you're the ones that destroyed the lord
[1:45:56] of glory
[1:45:58] he they started chucking rocks at him he
[1:46:00] says oh what did he do now he was on the
[1:46:03] mountaintop now he was up there he said
[1:46:06] i see the son of god sitting at the
[1:46:08] right hand of the father hallelujah
[1:46:13] now his flesh was quickened
[1:46:16] his body was quickened
[1:46:18] the life that was in him
[1:46:21] moved from inside of him literally in to
[1:46:25] his flesh
[1:46:28] where he can lay his flesh down
[1:46:31] for the glory of the kingdom of god
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:37] but that didn't come overnight
[1:46:44] philip
[1:46:46] phillip they're filled with the spirit
[1:46:47] of god
[1:46:49] the seed was brought to life
[1:46:52] now he's living
[1:46:53] and he's living the life he's obedient
[1:46:56] he's preaching the gospel he's in a
[1:46:58] meeting
[1:47:02] and the spirit moves on
[1:47:04] go
[1:47:05] over here
[1:47:10] so he goes down there
[1:47:11] and there's this enoch
[1:47:13] eunuch excuse me
[1:47:15] driving down
[1:47:17] the road in a chariot reading the
[1:47:19] scriptures and he he runs alongside the
[1:47:22] guy can you just picture it hey dude
[1:47:25] what are you reading well i'm reading
[1:47:26] over here in the prophets you know about
[1:47:28] this does he speak of of himself or one
[1:47:32] to come
[1:47:34] oh he says i know who he's talking about
[1:47:39] i've met him personally
[1:47:42] now philip has something on the inside
[1:47:44] of him
[1:47:46] it started out when
[1:47:50] when did it start out
[1:47:53] we said go get your brother
[1:47:57] you know what i mean
[1:47:58] way back when when the very first word
[1:48:01] was spoken to him
[1:48:05] and he said come see
[1:48:09] that that life i come here a man
[1:48:13] come hear somebody i've heard him it it
[1:48:16] brought something to life in me
[1:48:18] then he was led of the spirit obedient
[1:48:20] to the spirit he came along in his life
[1:48:23] and he was he he was living his life he
[1:48:25] was preaching the gospel he was carrying
[1:48:28] out the commission i hope you can point
[1:48:31] kind of see what i'm trying to say and
[1:48:33] now he's running this alongside this in
[1:48:35] the this eunuch and and he talks to him
[1:48:38] about the lord jumps up the chariot and
[1:48:40] he preaches the gospel to him and the
[1:48:42] guy stops and he says there's water
[1:48:46] what hindereth me
[1:48:48] from fulfilling the word of god
[1:48:53] now what has philip done
[1:48:56] he just started
[1:49:00] the eunuch on the same
[1:49:03] transformation process
[1:49:05] that he was on
[1:49:10] now what does philip do
[1:49:13] all of a sudden his
[1:49:15] mortal body
[1:49:17] this flesh
[1:49:18] this body that you are living in
[1:49:22] it
[1:49:23] translates
[1:49:25] to another place
[1:49:27] his fleshly mortal body got quickened
[1:49:33] by the spirit
[1:49:37] that was in him
[1:49:41] because the spirit
[1:49:43] that was in him had rule
[1:49:48] until you go back to our eagle
[1:49:51] all of a sudden it's in this yard
[1:49:55] and now it finds out i've got a desire
[1:49:58] to go up higher
[1:50:00] the first thing the
[1:50:02] mother eagle has to do in the story is
[1:50:06] convince the
[1:50:08] the person the eaglet that it is
[1:50:12] an eagle
[1:50:13] amen
[1:50:16] you are an eagle
[1:50:18] amen
[1:50:20] right
[1:50:21] it starts to talk about the identity
[1:50:24] right
[1:50:25] and it starts to so you don't you just
[1:50:28] picture it now
[1:50:30] here's the
[1:50:32] eagle
[1:50:33] sitting on the
[1:50:34] post
[1:50:37] of the barnyard
[1:50:39] preaching
[1:50:42] to the eaglet
[1:50:45] you are an eagle
[1:50:47] your name was written in my nest
[1:50:50] before the foundation of the world
[1:50:53] i saw you
[1:50:55] you were in me
[1:51:02] you were a part of me
[1:51:05] you came from me
[1:51:07] your bone of my bone your flesh and my
[1:51:10] flesh
[1:51:11] you're
[1:51:12] you're you're here
[1:51:14] i not only
[1:51:16] i have identity with you
[1:51:28] you're his lady
[1:51:30] you're his bride you're his elect he's
[1:51:34] got identity with you he's got to bring
[1:51:38] you to the place
[1:51:40] to evolving you
[1:51:42] by his word that you can take and accept
[1:51:46] the identity that you have in him
[1:51:54] that thing that bird was never going to
[1:51:57] flap this wings till it believed it
[1:51:58] could
[1:52:03] and that mother because it had that
[1:52:06] identity sit there and talk to it and
[1:52:09] talk to it and talk to it and preach to
[1:52:12] it and inspired it and did whatever it
[1:52:15] could
[1:52:17] because
[1:52:18] she knew
[1:52:19] why she laid that egg and what that
[1:52:23] eagle could do and where it's supposed
[1:52:25] to be and where it's supposed to go and
[1:52:28] what it's supposed to
[1:52:30] do and what its works are and what it's
[1:52:32] supposed to eat
[1:52:35] and it was out of place
[1:52:42] and that eat little elif
[1:52:44] looked up there
[1:52:46] and she went and she'd take a she'd jump
[1:52:48] off that post and go fly
[1:52:52] over that eagle
[1:52:54] what was she doing she was waving
[1:52:57] over that little eaglet
[1:52:59] what it could do
[1:53:05] come back down on the post and say this
[1:53:07] is what you were made for
[1:53:09] the works that i do you do also the way
[1:53:12] i fly you shall fly also you should you
[1:53:15] can overcome all these voices all these
[1:53:19] chicken things
[1:53:23] then the voices yeah you don't want to
[1:53:24] go out there
[1:53:28] look at this nice warm chicken house
[1:53:30] you're in
[1:53:32] how many's ever been in a chicken house
[1:53:34] a stench
[1:53:40] chickens are nasty
[1:53:42] i don't know why we eat so much of it
[1:53:50] i'm not against chick-fil-a so don't
[1:53:54] but
[1:53:57] there had to be
[1:53:59] a mental
[1:54:01] transformation
[1:54:04] from being half chicken
[1:54:06] and half eagle
[1:54:09] had to come to the spot
[1:54:12] you understand where it understood it
[1:54:15] was an eagle
[1:54:18] and it was possible
[1:54:21] to fly
[1:54:24] it hasn't flown yet
[1:54:28] you understand its body had not yet been
[1:54:32] quickened
[1:54:35] in our bodies heaven yet
[1:54:37] but they will
[1:54:39] and i believe some of you i won't even
[1:54:42] put my thing are coming to where your
[1:54:45] bodies are now becoming
[1:54:48] totally subject to the word of god
[1:54:53] you're denying the lust of the flesh
[1:54:55] you're denying the pride of life you're
[1:54:58] starting to bring this body under
[1:55:00] subjection you're starting to say no to
[1:55:03] the things of the world why
[1:55:06] that's just the beginning
[1:55:08] of the
[1:55:09] transformation
[1:55:10] of your body
[1:55:14] amen
[1:55:15] because part of this promise is not that
[1:55:19] some day
[1:55:20] will be resurrected the promises this
[1:55:23] mortal body this mortal body
[1:55:27] it will be quickened
[1:55:32] that i can fly this body
[1:55:35] can do the works
[1:55:39] not the preacher
[1:55:45] too many times our works is a collective
[1:55:48] work instead of an individual work
[1:55:53] when your body's quickened
[1:55:56] you don't have to be in an atmosphere
[1:55:58] right
[1:56:01] you fly because you're made to fly
[1:56:06] you don't got to go to revival to flap
[1:56:08] your wings
[1:56:09] you don't got to have someone just hype
[1:56:11] you up
[1:56:12] so you can flap in the hype
[1:56:15] right
[1:56:17] when you roll out of bed in the morning
[1:56:19] come on
[1:56:20] you stretch them late
[1:56:27] why
[1:56:28] because your body
[1:56:31] has been quickened
[1:56:33] so this little eaglet it's down in the
[1:56:36] it's down in the uh
[1:56:39] the yard
[1:56:41] now it's starting to hear the gospel
[1:56:44] what's going on is starting to evolve
[1:56:48] the seed
[1:56:51] is moving in
[1:56:53] to the mind
[1:56:59] the seed
[1:57:01] is hearing the word
[1:57:03] and moving into the mind where it's
[1:57:06] going to battle the voices
[1:57:11] because that's the way god works
[1:57:13] he works from the inside out
[1:57:21] and we can't look at the outside
[1:57:26] because that hasn't been quickened yet
[1:57:28] it's starting to come quicken
[1:57:30] it's starting to come subject
[1:57:34] they're starting to finally look at it
[1:57:35] and say you know what i'm tired of
[1:57:37] watching this junk on the computer it
[1:57:39] makes me feel bad
[1:57:44] i'm tired of thinking bad thoughts
[1:57:46] i'm fired i'm tired of of
[1:57:50] having bitterness in my heart
[1:57:52] i'm tired of not being free i'm tired of
[1:57:55] being worried i'm tired about financial
[1:57:58] troubles i'm tired i'm tired of this
[1:58:02] that little eagle had to come to the
[1:58:04] place that it was tired of the barnyard
[1:58:08] and it was hearing a voice
[1:58:12] that the first thing it was doing was
[1:58:14] changing its attitudes changing its
[1:58:17] thoughts changing its mind and giving it
[1:58:20] the hope
[1:58:23] that it too could come on top of the
[1:58:25] mountain and see
[1:58:34] so there it is
[1:58:37] now it wants what
[1:58:39] i want to fly
[1:58:42] i want my body quickened
[1:58:45] that's what that little eaglet was
[1:58:47] saying how do i fly
[1:58:49] how do i get my body quicken
[1:58:53] you're an eagle to begin with
[1:58:55] okay i get that start
[1:58:58] flapping
[1:58:59] your
[1:59:00] wings start doing the works
[1:59:05] start acting like it
[1:59:08] start
[1:59:08] moving it start walking into the
[1:59:11] christian image start walking into the
[1:59:14] image of christ start acting like he did
[1:59:17] start thinking like he did what's
[1:59:19] happening those wings are starting to
[1:59:21] move why now it's on its way to the
[1:59:25] quickening of its body
[1:59:27] first of all it had to start on the
[1:59:30] inside the seed coming to life secondly
[1:59:33] it had to be instructed
[1:59:37] of what it was
[1:59:39] where it come from and who it could what
[1:59:42] it could do
[1:59:44] but there has to come a time
[1:59:48] it's got to move
[1:59:49] into
[1:59:50] the body
[1:59:54] enoch got so close with god and he
[1:59:57] walked with god that he walked out
[2:00:00] what happened his body was quickened
[2:00:04] do you understand the promise of the
[2:00:06] resurrection it's not some day
[2:00:10] but that this mortal body
[2:00:14] by the spirit that was in jesus christ
[2:00:21] that spirit that was in him he puts that
[2:00:24] in you first
[2:00:26] he works from the inside first he brings
[2:00:29] the seed by the word of god you're
[2:00:32] brought into obedience to the word of
[2:00:35] god you receive the spirit that was in
[2:00:37] him if the spirit that was in him is in
[2:00:41] you
[2:00:42] then it quickens the mortal body
[2:00:47] jesus died of what
[2:00:51] a man how many knows that jesus died a
[2:00:53] man
[2:00:56] he died a man
[2:01:03] if i could say it like this without
[2:01:05] offending nobody
[2:01:08] but
[2:01:09] jesus said heaven and earth will pass
[2:01:11] away but my words will not pass away
[2:01:16] jesus as a man didn't quicken you
[2:01:22] it was the spirit
[2:01:24] that was in him
[2:01:29] which was the father
[2:01:32] that was god that was eternal he was the
[2:01:35] son of god and god imparted all that he
[2:01:39] was god poured into christ
[2:01:43] but he showed us by dying going there
[2:01:46] that spirit left
[2:01:48] him and he died a man
[2:01:52] why did he die a man because he oh it's
[2:01:56] so beautiful
[2:01:58] forgive me if i'm i'm caught up but he
[2:02:01] said he sat in the garden
[2:02:04] he said can this cup
[2:02:07] pass me
[2:02:11] he sweated
[2:02:13] even to the sweating of
[2:02:17] right blood
[2:02:19] he agonized
[2:02:23] but he knew that this was the cause that
[2:02:26] he came into the world
[2:02:29] you understand what the word said who he
[2:02:32] was and what he did he was so given to
[2:02:36] that amen
[2:02:43] so
[2:02:44] from the inside
[2:02:46] so from obedience so understanding
[2:02:50] having such a revelation of what he was
[2:02:52] here for what he was called to do
[2:02:56] that
[2:02:57] he died a man but guess what
[2:03:02] that mortal body
[2:03:05] got quickened
[2:03:08] it rose up
[2:03:10] showing us that all of our mortal bodies
[2:03:13] will be quickened also
[2:03:15] this quickening power don't leave you
[2:03:18] with death
[2:03:20] it never leaves you not only will it
[2:03:22] quicken your body this mortal body now
[2:03:26] but if it goes into the grave it'll
[2:03:28] quicken it again because that quickening
[2:03:31] power never leaves it never fails to
[2:03:34] perform what god
[2:03:36] wants
[2:03:38] and when that little eaglet in that
[2:03:40] barnyard
[2:03:42] got its mindset
[2:03:45] and finally realized i can do that
[2:03:49] i've been made to do that
[2:03:51] i've been called to do that how many in
[2:03:53] here really believe that you've been
[2:03:56] called to lay your hands on the sick
[2:03:59] and they recover
[2:04:02] not produce it
[2:04:06] you know
[2:04:07] not say the bible says
[2:04:10] i can lay my hands on the sick and
[2:04:12] they'll recover
[2:04:15] you know
[2:04:16] most of us pray like this
[2:04:23] i hope it happens
[2:04:28] no no not petering them guys
[2:04:31] they just come out of that quick and
[2:04:32] empowered
[2:04:33] they they knew what this this is what
[2:04:35] job said would happen this is the word
[2:04:38] of god living in me now it's going to
[2:04:40] quicken my mortal body
[2:04:42] he didn't say oh you know jesus said
[2:04:44] that you wouldn't you could be healed
[2:04:46] and jesus said that you could walk and
[2:04:49] you know what i mean
[2:04:50] that's the inside talking
[2:04:54] but they talked beyond the inside
[2:04:57] they talked with their mortal body
[2:05:02] silver and gold
[2:05:03] have i none but that which i have he
[2:05:07] reached down he grabbed him by the hand
[2:05:10] and pulled him to his feet and said walk
[2:05:19] now remember
[2:05:21] it's not going to do you any good to
[2:05:23] jump on top of the mountain and think
[2:05:24] you're going to go
[2:05:30] not until you're 100 given over
[2:05:34] to the voice
[2:05:38] jesus said i do nothing
[2:05:41] until the father speaks to me
[2:05:43] but when it spoke to him
[2:05:46] it didn't just quicken his mind it just
[2:05:49] didn't quicken his spirit it quickened
[2:05:52] his mortal body also
[2:05:56] i'm trying to tell us and trying to tell
[2:05:59] myself that that spirit that's in me
[2:06:02] will also quicken it'll bring this body
[2:06:06] to life it'll bring this body subject to
[2:06:10] the word this body will do the works
[2:06:13] that he done this person this flesh will
[2:06:17] walk and perform the works of god it
[2:06:20] won't be in my heart it won't be in my
[2:06:23] mind it won't be me praying for somebody
[2:06:26] else it'll be
[2:06:28] me amen
[2:06:30] me
[2:06:32] i will do
[2:06:34] the works that he done
[2:06:36] by will
[2:06:38] by power
[2:06:40] by might
[2:06:42] no
[2:06:43] but by his spirit
[2:06:45] saith the lord
[2:06:47] and and i can flap my wings
[2:06:50] and fly into the heavenly
[2:06:53] you know
[2:06:54] because god worked from the inside out
[2:06:58] you know god's got to fill us and and
[2:07:01] that's what we got to realize
[2:07:03] we need our bodies quicken
[2:07:07] amen
[2:07:08] the flesh wars against the spirit and
[2:07:10] the spirit against the flesh our spirits
[2:07:12] are right
[2:07:15] our minds are right our hearts are right
[2:07:20] we've got to start dealing with this
[2:07:22] thing
[2:07:23] we start to kind of start taking it
[2:07:26] under subjection
[2:07:30] we've got to we've got to bring it under
[2:07:32] total subjection to the word of god
[2:07:35] because when it comes into the total
[2:07:37] subjection of the word of god then god
[2:07:39] can quicken it amen
[2:07:42] and it can identify what's on the inside
[2:07:45] but bitter and sweet can't come out of
[2:07:48] the same fountain
[2:07:50] you can't be on the hilltop one day and
[2:07:53] then the valley the next
[2:07:56] so ask god to work on your inside
[2:08:01] because you have a desire
[2:08:05] to be
[2:08:07] what he's
[2:08:10] prophesied
[2:08:12] that we would be
[2:08:14] in this age
[2:08:16] i have a desire to fly there lord
[2:08:19] i have a desire to do the works that
[2:08:21] you've done
[2:08:22] i have a desire father that it's just
[2:08:25] not in my spirit it's just not in my
[2:08:28] heart it's just not
[2:08:30] in what i believe and okay but i want it
[2:08:34] to be
[2:08:35] made alive in
[2:08:37] my
[2:08:38] flesh
[2:08:42] and that's a promise
[2:08:45] and god's working
[2:08:47] and you say well what's he working
[2:08:48] toward we already know he sent a prophet
[2:08:51] there anybody in here that doesn't
[2:08:54] understand
[2:08:55] how that brother brahm's a prophet why
[2:08:57] he's the prophet and the scriptural word
[2:09:00] i'd be happy
[2:09:02] to sit down with you
[2:09:05] and explain to you the promises of luke
[2:09:09] 17 30 revelations 10 7 malachi 4 5
[2:09:14] revelations 3 and 14 the promise of our
[2:09:18] day coming to pass
[2:09:21] just like paul did with the jews he sat
[2:09:24] down and went through all the history of
[2:09:26] the word and how he was the high priest
[2:09:29] and it showed them through the
[2:09:31] scriptures
[2:09:32] that this was the fulfillment of the
[2:09:35] prophecy of the messiah
[2:09:40] the only thing that's taking your total
[2:09:44] complete
[2:09:47] submission
[2:09:48] is other voices
[2:09:53] other reasoning
[2:09:55] eve had a voice
[2:09:58] don't eat
[2:10:00] and it was the battle of the voices
[2:10:06] and she listened
[2:10:10] and
[2:10:12] we've got to see understand
[2:10:15] that the one that was
[2:10:17] on the mountain
[2:10:18] the one that could see what was coming
[2:10:21] the one that was on the building he
[2:10:23] spoke to us
[2:10:25] this is what's coming
[2:10:27] this is what coming and that words fall
[2:10:30] down on our hearts
[2:10:32] it quickened us it brought us together
[2:10:36] from all parts of the world
[2:10:38] formed us into a body
[2:10:41] and it's dealing with our hearts
[2:10:43] dealing with our minds
[2:10:46] that we can come in one accord
[2:10:48] by one spirit
[2:10:50] that the love of god would be shed
[2:10:52] abroad in our heart
[2:10:54] that we'll be committed we won't be
[2:10:55] running off into the world one day and
[2:10:58] out friday night doing this and and
[2:11:00] doing that and in and out and listening
[2:11:02] to this and listening to this and then
[2:11:05] come together
[2:11:08] but each of us individually will say you
[2:11:10] know something i don't want my body to
[2:11:13] do what it's doing
[2:11:15] anymore amen because it's at war with my
[2:11:18] spirit
[2:11:21] and god promised me
[2:11:25] you understand
[2:11:26] it's not your battle
[2:11:28] he promised me
[2:11:31] lord that i could fly
[2:11:35] he promised me that this body also too
[2:11:38] would be quickened
[2:11:40] and lord now i'm here praying for the
[2:11:42] quickening of my
[2:11:44] body
[2:11:46] that little eagle was saying lord i see
[2:11:48] it i see the sky i see what he's saying
[2:11:51] i see those things lord i'm praying that
[2:11:54] i can flap my wings and fly out of where
[2:11:57] i'm at
[2:12:00] and be in the heavenlies
[2:12:02] and do what i'm made to do
[2:12:05] because you'll never be happy
[2:12:08] being under bondage
[2:12:10] to any other voice
[2:12:12] but his voice
[2:12:14] and
[2:12:15] you say well he leave me no he said i'll
[2:12:18] never leave you nor forsake you i'll
[2:12:20] just make your life
[2:12:22] so miserable
[2:12:25] that one day you'll stop
[2:12:28] and say okay lord
[2:12:30] amen don't quicken my mind only
[2:12:32] don't quicken my spirit only but also
[2:12:35] quicken this
[2:12:37] mortal body let's stand together this
[2:12:40] morning
[2:12:45] [Applause]
[2:12:47] you love them this morning
[2:12:50] is that your heart's desire
[2:12:52] let's bow our heads each of us
[2:12:57] and
[2:12:59] let us look
[2:13:01] towards heaven in your heart
[2:13:04] he's looking at each of you and he knows
[2:13:06] each of your life
[2:13:09] he knows what you struggle with
[2:13:13] he knows if it's lust of the flesh pride
[2:13:15] of life ego
[2:13:18] he knows all the voices that talk to
[2:13:21] your flesh
[2:13:23] he knows all the desires that your
[2:13:26] senses have satan has so many things
[2:13:29] to attract
[2:13:30] the senses
[2:13:33] he has so many spirits to
[2:13:35] soothe the
[2:13:37] inside realm
[2:13:40] but way down in your soul
[2:13:43] way down inside of your heart
[2:13:48] if you would ask yourself
[2:13:51] is my flesh
[2:13:53] under subjection to the word
[2:13:58] i'm i'm still doing a lot of things in
[2:14:00] my body
[2:14:03] and i want you to separate your body
[2:14:08] from that part of you that believes
[2:14:12] and ask yourself you know
[2:14:15] i need this quickening power in my flesh
[2:14:22] i need this to go from the inside of me
[2:14:26] to the outside of me
[2:14:30] and lord you work from the inside out
[2:14:35] i know you sent a prophet
[2:14:40] i've heard that
[2:14:42] there's nothing in the world
[2:14:46] that'll take that away from me
[2:14:54] [Music]
[2:14:56] lord i know what's right
[2:14:58] [Music]
[2:15:00] and i have the desire to do right
[2:15:07] i love hearing your word i love going to
[2:15:09] church
[2:15:12] but father my flesh
[2:15:15] [Music]
[2:15:17] just hasn't been quickened all the way
[2:15:22] nearly not in the realms that i should
[2:15:24] be
[2:15:27] i don't have the understanding of this
[2:15:29] life that i should have
[2:15:33] lord and i want to come up higher
[2:15:37] and i've been told by your gospel by one
[2:15:39] that sat on the top of the mountain
[2:15:42] that sat up on top of the building that
[2:15:45] looked afar off and he said i see the
[2:15:48] quickening
[2:15:49] of the body
[2:15:52] i see the church
[2:15:54] i see the believer
[2:15:56] i see what's looking up at me from way
[2:15:59] below
[2:16:01] ascending to this place
[2:16:05] and seeing what i see
[2:16:09] and doing what i do
[2:16:14] and father they're on their journey up
[2:16:18] and now they realize lord that this has
[2:16:21] got to go beyond their minds
[2:16:23] and beyond their spirits
[2:16:26] it's got to actually come into
[2:16:30] the flesh
[2:16:33] in the beginning the word
[2:16:35] was made flesh
[2:16:37] now the flesh is being made word
[2:16:41] lord and i need that power this
[2:16:44] morning and i want to lift my hand up
[2:16:47] this morning
[2:16:50] and i want to say lord i want this to
[2:16:52] move from my heart
[2:16:54] and from my mind
[2:16:56] into my flesh
[2:16:59] i want it to be in my life in my bones
[2:17:03] and actually the bones that i feel i
[2:17:05] want to feel vibrating and full and
[2:17:08] submissive
[2:17:10] to your will
[2:17:12] i want it to live out of me where it
[2:17:14] could be seen
[2:17:19] lord and i want it to go into the secret
[2:17:21] places
[2:17:23] i wanted to go into the closets of my
[2:17:26] life and wanted to
[2:17:29] go no matter what it takes father
[2:17:32] if it takes sacrificing the thing i
[2:17:34] enjoy to do the most
[2:17:36] i'm willing to do whatever it takes
[2:17:39] to have you live
[2:17:42] not just in my heart
[2:17:46] not just in my mind
[2:17:49] but to live in my body
[2:17:54] if that's your desire don't look at what
[2:17:57] you're doing
[2:17:58] don't look at where you're at
[2:18:02] don't look at yesterday
[2:18:05] ask your heart
[2:18:06] is that what you want
[2:18:11] and if that's what you want you lift
[2:18:13] your hand this morning say lord that's
[2:18:15] what i want
[2:18:17] i'm a long way from the top
[2:18:20] but i know that you will work on the
[2:18:22] inside of me and if this desires on the
[2:18:25] inside of me it'll work its way out
[2:18:29] and lord i want to be that
[2:18:32] i want to be able to create a
[2:18:34] christ-like atmosphere radiating from my
[2:18:36] flesh
[2:18:43] you said that this flesh would come
[2:18:45] under total subjection to the word of
[2:18:47] god
[2:18:48] that's a promise it's not a condemnation
[2:18:53] it's not a judgment
[2:18:55] it's a prophecy of life
[2:18:57] to every believer
[2:19:00] and father i
[2:19:01] ask that it starts with me this morning
[2:19:06] lord so many feelings and emotions and
[2:19:14] so easy to get shook up
[2:19:17] lord i need you to quicken beyond my
[2:19:20] mind beyond my
[2:19:22] spirit
[2:19:23] beyond my heart
[2:19:25] right into my living bones
[2:19:28] and i believe it's a promise to the
[2:19:30] church father every hand that was raised
[2:19:34] father that's their first step
[2:19:37] for it to trans
[2:19:40] inspiring
[2:19:41] that's the first step that will happen
[2:19:45] by the uplift of the seed coming to life
[2:19:49] and the recognition of the desire
[2:19:52] i appreciate you this morning lord
