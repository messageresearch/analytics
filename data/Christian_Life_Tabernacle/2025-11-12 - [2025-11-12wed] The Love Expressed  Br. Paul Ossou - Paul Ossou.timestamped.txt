[23:36] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that

[23:42] a father towards your children to
[23:44] provide what we have need of. And Lord,

[23:48] surrendered to you, Lord. Letting it go

[23:54] thinking, Father, and looking to you as
[23:56] the the answer. [music]

[24:12] Lord, but you're the Lord that heals all
[24:14] our diseases. You make all things well.
[24:17] You could make it better than it was
[24:18] before, Father. And Lord, we ask for you
[24:21] to do that. Touch his back as well.

[24:35] if we were left to ourselves, Lord, we'd
[24:38] be lost sheep. We'd be tangled in
[24:40] briars. We'd be helpless, Lord. And
[24:42] Lord, we need you to come on the scene
[24:44] once again. And Lord, to pull us to your
[24:47] bosom, Father. And may we feel your hand
[24:50] leading. May we know that you're the one
[24:51] who's guiding, [music] Lord. May you
[24:53] dissolve our thoughts. And may we have
[24:55] your mind, I pray, tonight, Lord. I
[24:58] don't know how to speak all the needs
[25:00] that were read over this pulpit, Father,
[25:02] but we've put them into your hands,
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Lord. And that's a piece to our hearts,
[25:09] Father. May you just continue to brood
[25:11] out over this service. We thank you for
[25:13] it, Lord. May any hindrance, we just
[25:15] cast it away in my heart for before you,
[25:18] Father. May I receive all that I have
[25:20] need of each one that's been gathered
[25:22] here tonight, may we be closer to you.
[25:24] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.

[35:23] Let's pray.
[35:28] Evenly [music] Father,
[35:31] we love you tonight
[35:36] because you first loved us
[35:41] and tonight we are here
[35:44] to express
[35:46] this love to you.
[35:49] We need you.
[35:52] I believe that your [music] presence is
[35:54] among us.
[35:56] I can feel the leading of your Holy
[35:58] Spirit
[36:01] through the song.
[36:03] I know that tonight
[36:07] you're going to speak [music] to us.
[36:11] We just want to open our hearts
[36:14] to receive your [music] words.
[36:17] You know, oh Lord,
[36:21] I'm not able to talk to say something
[36:23] good to [music] your people.
[36:26] I just need your presence, your help.
[36:31] Bless us tonight [music]
[36:33] in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[36:36] Amen.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I think we are glad to be
[36:42] in the house of the Lord tonight. Amen.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; The last weekend
[36:52] we were blessed uh
[36:55] went to Tukton,
[36:58] Arizona where brother David was
[37:00] preaching.
[37:02] It was a great blessing. We can see our
[37:05] brother David is a blessing for the body
[37:08] of Christ.
[37:10] and
[37:12] since last week. God bless you, brother
[37:15] Billy. But the Billy doesn't know
[37:18] exactly
[37:20] what I'm I would talk about what my
[37:24] sermon tonight, but I think the
[37:28] introducing song
[37:31] is my preaching tonight. God bless you.
[37:35] Uh last week
[37:39] God was was dealing with my heart about
[37:42] the relationship I can have with God
[37:48] and I just
[37:51] figure that this relationship is just
[37:54] based
[37:56] on love.
[38:00] He loved me
[38:02] and he sent me his word that become like
[38:06] a love letter.
[38:08] Uh tonight
[38:11] my sermon is the love expressed.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; The love expressed. God express his love
[38:23] to us
[38:25] &gt;&gt; and we express our love to him.
[38:28] And we're going to take our Bible in the
[38:30] book of John. We know the scripture.
[38:35] Job chap uh John chapter 3.
[38:40] [snorts]
[38:44] John 3:15 and 16.
[38:52] The Bible says
[38:56] that without a belief in him should not
[38:59] perish but have eternal life.
[39:03] For God so loved the world that he gave
[39:06] his only begotten son that whosoever
[39:09] believeth in him should not perish but
[39:13] have everlasting life.
[39:17] Lord Jesus,
[39:19] may you open this word for us tonight in
[39:22] Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[39:28] And
[39:30] very often when we talk about the love
[39:33] of God,
[39:36] we
[39:38] talk a lot about his kindness,
[39:43] his mercy,
[39:45] his good, rich of mercy, good of good,
[39:48] rich of goodness and
[39:54] slow to anger. But tonight, you know,
[39:58] the love of God, we have the song we
[40:01] love to sing that say that
[40:05] the love of God is so great, is so far
[40:10] that if we can use the
[40:13] sky like a parchment and every man can
[40:17] be a scribe,
[40:20] &gt;&gt; we couldn't talk about the love of the
[40:24] love of God.
[40:27] and express all thing about it.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; And tonight I want to take one side
[40:35] because I think that the love of God is
[40:37] like a diamond with many sides.
[40:40] And I want to take one side of the
[40:45] expression of the love of God to us
[40:51] &gt;&gt; and this side is
[40:53] we're going to take our Bible in the
[40:56] book of Hebrew chapter 12.
[41:06] Hebrews chapter 12.
[41:20] Uh let's start with the verse 6.
[41:25] Hebrew chapter 12 verse 6.
[41:29] For whom the Lord loveth,
[41:33] he chneth and scourge every son whom he
[41:37] receiveth.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; If ye endure chastening, God dealeth
[41:42] with you as with sons.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; For what son is a whom the father chneth
[41:49] not? But if ye be without chastisement,
[41:54] whereof all are patus, then are ye
[41:59] bastard and not sons.
[42:01] Furthermore, we have are the fathers of
[42:05] our flesh which correct us, and we give
[42:09] them reverence.
[42:11] Shall we not much rather be rather be in
[42:15] subjection unto the father of spirit and
[42:18] and life?
[42:21] For they verly for a few days chenet us
[42:26] after their own pleasure, but if for our
[42:30] profit that we might be partakers of his
[42:35] holiness.
[42:38] That's one of the way
[42:41] God can express
[42:44] his love to us
[42:47] by chastening us. [snorts]
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Sometime we are just walking
[42:57] feeling like God is not seeing
[42:59] everything we are doing.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Like everything is good. Even we are in
[43:08] some evil things.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; We think that God is only a grander.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; He loved us. He can do nothing to us.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; But the Bible say that if God loves us,
[43:29] &gt;&gt; he will trust in us. Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Not because he want to do something bad
[43:35] on us,
[43:37] &gt;&gt; but because he want to bring us back to
[43:40] him,
[43:41] &gt;&gt; to bring us close to him. Amen.
[43:46] Uh
[43:50] brother Banam says he
[43:55] in the door of the door
[43:58] preach
[44:00] uh December 1257
[44:08] because when God
[44:10] ching us is knocking
[44:14] at our door
[44:16] &gt;&gt; to bring us back to him
[44:18] &gt;&gt; to have a relationship
[44:21] with us.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; And Buddham say is uh the power of six
[44:26] he said now
[44:28] you notice that he also give an
[44:32] invitation and said
[44:35] be zealous
[44:36] &gt;&gt; for those I love I trust them.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is the little coach and
[44:43] correct and weep and he said be zealous
[44:48] and repent. [snorts]
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Now he's not speaking to sinners.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; He's not speaking to sinners.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; He's speaking to the church.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; And when we are talking about the church
[45:03] is not a building.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; The church is you,
[45:08] &gt;&gt; it's me.
[45:11] So when Jesus when the love when love
[45:15] the Lord say that he just those he love
[45:20] is not talking about the sinner.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Sometime the devil can tell you that you
[45:27] are a sinner. You are chasting because
[45:29] you are a sinner.
[45:31] But if you know your position,
[45:35] &gt;&gt; if you know who you are,
[45:38] &gt;&gt; if you know really your relationship
[45:40] with the Lord,
[45:43] &gt;&gt; you know that you are not a sinner.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Even you are chasing is just because God
[45:50] is knocking at your door.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; God want to bring you back to him
[45:58] &gt;&gt; to bring you close to him. Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; And he said
[46:08] [snorts] he's speaking to the church.
[46:12] Be healed us of him and repent from our
[46:16] lukewarm condition that we are today.
[46:24] Some of us become just lukewarm.
[46:29] But God want to bring us back to him
[46:35] &gt;&gt; to do something for him
[46:40] and say
[46:42] now we notice he said I stand at the
[46:46] door and knock.
[46:49] [snorts] What is a person knocking at
[46:52] the door for?
[46:54] Is trying to gain the entrance.
[46:59] He has something that he want to speak
[47:02] to you about it.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; So God is knocking at your door because
[47:10] he has something
[47:13] to tell you.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; He have something about you.
[47:20] He has something he want to put in your
[47:23] heart.
[47:26] And but when I'm say
[47:28] in
[47:30] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[47:38] preach
[47:40] uh
[47:42] I think in
[47:46] June 12 55
[47:51] June 125
[47:54] paragraph 168 eight.
[48:00] He said,
[48:03] "I'd shock you if I tell you that just
[48:07] about to repeat again."
[48:10] The Bible said he was on the outside
[48:14] trying to knock to get in
[48:17] and nobody would let him in.
[48:20] He that I love I chasten and rebuke.
[48:25] I sc him. I shake him down.
[48:29] But it because I love him.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; God do it because he love you.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; The devil can can say that he's doing
[48:44] because God forsake you.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Is not true
[48:50] &gt;&gt; because he say that he won't forsake
[48:52] you.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:55] God promise that he won't forsake you.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Even you are chesting
[49:00] it because he love you.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; He say open up and let me come in. Yeah.
[49:11] Could not remember I didn't want to get
[49:14] in the church.
[49:17] It he the individual. Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; It not about the church the building
[49:24] &gt;&gt; but it about the individual.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Sometime we can pass through the trial.
[49:32] We are struggling
[49:34] but God can let us go through some trial
[49:40] &gt;&gt; just to bring us back to him.
[49:49] He said he couldn't get in the church.
[49:52] They had him locked out
[49:56] only organization of all of them.
[50:03] is his church age that he was on the
[50:06] outside the church put out, refused,
[50:10] rejected
[50:12] because he was only manifested in the
[50:16] temporarily in the other churches in the
[50:19] form of justification so forth. But in
[50:22] here, the age that coming now is the
[50:28] full manifestation of the vindication of
[50:32] Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today,
[50:35] and forever.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; So God doesn't want us to look like the
[50:42] people of Luther age,
[50:46] &gt;&gt; like
[50:48] Pont people.
[50:53] But we have to come back
[50:56] to our real position in God.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Come back to the image of Christ in our
[51:07] life.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; The full manifestation.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[51:12] &gt;&gt; So the world can see and testify that
[51:15] Jesus is really the same yesterday,
[51:18] today, and forever. Hallelujah.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; God is looking for each one of us
[51:31] to do the job
[51:34] &gt;&gt; to testify that is alive. Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; And sometime if we are not doing it, it
[51:43] can
[51:46] put us
[51:48] in chastising
[51:50] so we can come back
[51:54] and live like the Christian.
[51:59] You say, "Oh, I'll admit we got a lot of
[52:03] impersonator, but examine the first one,
[52:07] the original.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; We are from the original seed of God."
[52:14] &gt;&gt; And we have to express it.
[52:20] And sometime I say God can bring us to
[52:23] some trouble something just because he
[52:28] want to bring us back to him.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; The Bible say in the book of Job chapter
[52:36] 33
[52:59] Yeah. Job chapter 33 verse14
[53:06] Bible say
[53:08] for God speaketh once yeah twice yet men
[53:14] perceive it now
[53:16] in a dream in a vision of the night when
[53:20] deep sleep fallth upon men in slumbering
[53:24] upon the bed so God can talk to us to
[53:29] dream
[53:30] &gt;&gt; to vision
[53:32] and listen.
[53:35] Then he openeth the heat of men and
[53:38] sealth the instruction
[53:40] that he may withdraw men from his
[53:43] purpose and hide pride for men.
[53:48] He keepeth back his soul from the pit
[53:51] and his life from perishing by the
[53:54] swore.
[53:58] He is chatting also with pen.
[54:03] That another way God can talk to us.
[54:08] He's chatting also with pain upon his
[54:11] bed.
[54:13] And the multitude of his born with
[54:15] strong pain so that his life above bread
[54:21] and his soul dirty meat. His flesh is
[54:25] consumed away that it cannot be seen.
[54:29] And his bones that were not sick stick
[54:33] out. Yeah. If so drove near unto the
[54:38] grave and his life to a destroyer
[54:42] that God can do it for us.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; But it's wonderful our God.
[54:52] Verse 23rd, he say,
[54:55] "If
[54:56] there be a messenger with him,
[55:00] an interpret interpreter,
[55:03] one among a thousand to show unto man
[55:08] his uprightness."
[55:11] I can say the preacher,
[55:14] the pastor,
[55:16] if God can find him with him, then he is
[55:22] gracious unto him and safe, deliver him
[55:26] from going down to the pit. I found a
[55:30] ransom.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:32] So through the word
[55:34] &gt;&gt; God will bring you back
[55:39] &gt;&gt; and he say
[55:41] his flesh shall be fresher than a child.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; He shall return to the days of his
[55:49] youth. Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; He shall pray unto God, and he will be
[55:53] favorable unto him
[55:56] &gt;&gt; and he shall see his face with joy, and
[56:00] he will render unto men his
[56:03] righteousness. Amen.
[56:07] [snorts]
[56:07] &gt;&gt; So don't look at only
[56:11] what you are passing through today,
[56:16] &gt;&gt; but look at the one who make a promise
[56:21] &gt;&gt; that will never forsake you.
[56:26] He can take to he can he he can he can
[56:29] talk to you by a dream, by a vision, but
[56:33] he can talk to you through his word,
[56:38] &gt;&gt; to the preacher
[56:40] to bring you back to him.
[56:44] Andam says he
[56:50] in the beginning and the ending of the
[56:53] gentle dispensation
[56:59] preach September 1st 55
[57:05] paragraph 35
[57:08] [snorts]
[57:10] say
[57:12] the word of God is the lamp unto our
[57:16] feet
[57:19] that we should be guided.
[57:22] Then it's the light that follows the
[57:26] pathway that lead us from victory unto
[57:30] victory.
[57:32] Now before you can have a victory, there
[57:36] has to be a battle.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; And if there's no battle, there's no
[57:42] victories. Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; So we ought to be thankful
[57:47] &gt;&gt; for the battles and the trials
[57:51] &gt;&gt; and it's God giving us the opportunity
[57:55] to have a victory.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Don't that make you a little bit better
[58:02] now?
[58:06] &gt;&gt; If you are in a trial, be happy.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Be thankful to God.
[58:12] is trying to make you an overcome.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; He's trying to give you a victory.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; See the battle come along somebody
[58:25] saying something bad about you. Sickness
[58:29] come unto you. Maybe God give you those
[58:33] light affliction
[58:35] that it might heal you and show his
[58:38] favor to you.
[58:40] Let you
[58:42] let you see what he means by it. He
[58:46] loves you.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; The old shepher story that was told he
[58:53] there in Jerusalem
[58:56] in the holy lands of a shepherd was
[59:00] pecking and a sheep and he said
[59:04] what you packing it for? said it's got a
[59:09] broken leg. Said how it do that fall
[59:13] over a cliff said no I broke it leg.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; The cher broke his leg.
[59:23] He said why you c shepher you break that
[59:28] sheep leg
[59:30] say no I love it.
[59:35] is through the expression of his love.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; I love it and say
[59:47] it was going a way
[59:51] and I couldn't make it mind me.
[59:55] So I broke its leg so it could give it
[59:59] some extra intention
[1:00:02] so then it would love me and follow me.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; So God can God can chasten you so you
[1:00:13] can have
[1:00:16] more attention from him.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; So he can take care of you.
[1:00:23] seeking every close to him.
[1:00:28] He say sometime
[1:00:30] God has to let us break down
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; just a little bit
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; in earth to give us a little extra
[1:00:38] intention
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; that our love our God love
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; sometime God has to let us break down
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; just a little bit in earth to give us a
[1:00:55] little extra intention
[1:00:57] to get us up on his lap
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; to w us up in his bosom.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; When the doctor said nothing can be
[1:01:07] done, then he take us into his basm.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Say, see, I love you.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let you get well. See,
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; oh, doesn't that just make life a little
[1:01:24] bit better?
[1:01:25] Oh, he's so great.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; He's a marvelous shepher, isn't it?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; That our God.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; So if you are in a trial, the D the
[1:01:40] devil will say that where is your God?
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; God forsake you. You are not a son of a
[1:01:47] daughter of God. He will tell you it.
[1:01:52] Just tell him back
[1:01:54] I have my name in the book.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; He never forsake me.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; He will bring [clears throat] me back.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible say in the book I think it the
[1:02:11] book of Psalm. Yeah. Psalm.
[1:02:17] I'm thinking about something. Uh,
[1:02:21] yes. Excuse me. I'm trying to find it.
[1:02:30] I think it's Psalm 89.
[1:02:37] Yes, Psalm 89.
[1:02:41] God is talking about David,
[1:02:45] but we're going to start at the verse
[1:02:48] 28. But you know that it about David
[1:02:51] he's talking about.
[1:02:55] He say my mercy will I keep for him for
[1:03:02] ever more and my covenant shall stand
[1:03:06] fast with him.
[1:03:09] His seed also will I make to and endure
[1:03:14] forever and his throne as the day of
[1:03:18] heaven.
[1:03:20] [snorts] If his children forsake my law,
[1:03:25] if you forsake the law of God,
[1:03:29] and walk not in my judgments,
[1:03:34] if they break my statutes, and keep not
[1:03:37] my commandments,
[1:03:40] then will I visit the transgression? He
[1:03:43] will do it
[1:03:45] with the hold and the iniquity with the
[1:03:49] stripes.
[1:03:51] [snorts] Nevertheless, my loving
[1:03:54] kindness will I not earthly take from
[1:03:59] him,
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; nor suffer my faithfulness to fail,
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; my covenant will I not break,
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; nor alter the thing that is gone out of
[1:04:13] my lips.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; The devil will say that he forsake you.
[1:04:21] Tell him I'm the son of David.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; I'm the son of God.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; I can be chastined
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; is the the expression of my God's love.
[1:04:33] But I know he's doing that because he
[1:04:37] want to bring me back to him,
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; to bring me close to him, to help me
[1:04:43] to le upon him
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; to believe that everything I need I can
[1:04:50] find in his hand. Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Sometime you can do everything
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; and God just use his mercy upon you.
[1:05:04] Sometime God will chasten you.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; We know the story of Samson.
[1:05:14] Samson was born for a purpose
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; to do something to deliver the people.
[1:05:22] And we know that one day Samson went
[1:05:26] together.
[1:05:28] He saw an allot.
[1:05:31] Samson went to her.
[1:05:35] Samson stay with the allot all the
[1:05:38] night.
[1:05:41] And the gathered people
[1:05:44] closed the gate and was trying to kill
[1:05:47] Samson.
[1:05:51] Samson was in the sin
[1:05:54] with the island
[1:05:57] but God give him strength and power
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; to put out the gate of Gaza
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; put on his shoulder and go with it.
[1:06:10] But the same Samson
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; when he deal with Dala,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; it will not the same.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; God let
[1:06:20] the Philistine people
[1:06:24] to pull out his eyes.
[1:06:28] It was terrible.
[1:06:33] It It doesn't mean that it doesn't mean
[1:06:35] that God forsake Samson.
[1:06:41] But God was chasting Samson for a
[1:06:44] purpose.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; So you can remind that he was born to be
[1:06:49] a son of God.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; It was born to do something for God.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; It was born is not a sinner.
[1:07:02] It's supposed not to deal with the sin
[1:07:05] or with the world.
[1:07:09] But Samson knew that he was a son of
[1:07:13] God.
[1:07:16] Even in this condition,
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; he knew that he was a son of God.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; That's something we have to know.
[1:07:29] Yes,
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; we have to trust
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; to believe that we are the salt and the
[1:07:39] daughter of the prophecy.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; And if God say
[1:07:48] if God say that his word can quicken us,
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; he will do it.
[1:07:57] So Samson in this condition
[1:08:01] he knew
[1:08:04] and he pray he believed that God can
[1:08:09] have a possibility for him.
[1:08:13] And what says in [snorts]
[1:08:18] just one more time Lord
[1:08:21] preach
[1:08:30] January 20th 63
[1:08:34] [snorts]
[1:08:35] paragraph 103ami
[1:08:42] is talking about Samson,
[1:08:45] the condition of Samson.
[1:08:51] He say,
[1:08:53] "Revenge me, Lord of my enemies.
[1:08:59] Revenge my eyesight."
[1:09:03] They poked it out, "Lord, and here
[1:09:07] [snorts] I stand."
[1:09:09] Samur also knew there was a possibility
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; that God
[1:09:17] might once again hear him.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Sometime you feel like oh God is no more
[1:09:25] answering my prayer. Be like Samson.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; He's my God.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:34] If he doesn't answer today, he will
[1:09:37] answer tomorrow.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; I will stay there
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; until he will answer.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't answer tomorrow, he will
[1:09:48] do it after tomorrow.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't do after tomorrow, he will
[1:09:53] do it next week.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Just keep believe.
[1:10:03] Samson also knew there was a possibility
[1:10:06] that God God might once again heal him.
[1:10:12] Even in his conditions,
[1:10:15] there was a possibility.
[1:10:18] Oh church,
[1:10:20] there is a possibility regardless of all
[1:10:24] their doing.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Regardless your condition, there's a
[1:10:32] possibility that God can deal with you.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; God can deal with your heart.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; God can talk to you.
[1:10:45] God can resolve your problem.
[1:10:50] He says as we hear today so much so many
[1:10:55] so many made decision decision decision
[1:10:58] means a stone a confession
[1:11:03] as I have said before
[1:11:05] what good does a stone do if you haven't
[1:11:10] got a stone m
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; there with a sharp wood to cut some
[1:11:15] stone into a place stone for the
[1:11:18] building.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; That's why we are the pastor.
[1:11:26] We bless God for brother David
[1:11:30] who is a really a great blessing. And
[1:11:33] the Bible says
[1:11:36] what good does it to do to make decision
[1:11:41] if you still let the woman and the men
[1:11:44] remain as they was and just join the
[1:11:48] church.
[1:11:51] It's about stone that not shape into
[1:11:54] nothing.
[1:11:56] What we need is a stone mer,
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; a man with the word of God, a vindicated
[1:12:05] power to prove that God sent him to
[1:12:09] shape that church and cut off the worthy
[1:12:12] thing and shape them into the stones of
[1:12:16] the sons and daughters of God that go
[1:12:21] into his building. certainly white. Oh
[1:12:24] my.
[1:12:26] He knew the possibilities
[1:12:31] that there could be God would heal
[1:12:36] prayer.
[1:12:38] If we could only do that tonight.
[1:12:42] Jesus said when he was here on earth,
[1:12:47] John 14:12,
[1:12:50] he that believeth on me, the work that I
[1:12:54] do shall he do also.
[1:12:58] Jesus said or the Bible said in Hebrew
[1:13:02] 13:8
[1:13:04] that was quote a while ago Jesus is the
[1:13:08] same yesterday today and forever.
[1:13:16] So even your condition
[1:13:19] even you are shed
[1:13:23] do like Samson
[1:13:26] there is a possibility
[1:13:30] God have something for you
[1:13:35] it doesn't mean that God forsake you
[1:13:40] sometime preacher can put it on You say
[1:13:44] that oh you are ching because you are a
[1:13:46] sinner.
[1:13:48] We just read that when Jesus was say
[1:13:52] that
[1:13:54] that love will chasten he was not
[1:13:57] talking about the sinners
[1:14:02] it was about the church
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; it's about you
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; it's about me.
[1:14:14] Don't keep crying
[1:14:17] but believe that
[1:14:21] Jesus God will made a promise.
[1:14:26] He will take care of you
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; if the musician can come.
[1:14:33] So tonight
[1:14:35] as I say
[1:14:37] the love of God
[1:14:41] can be expressed in a several way in
[1:14:45] many ways
[1:14:48] sometime it lies like Job.
[1:14:53] Job was not a sinner.
[1:14:58] God testified to the devil
[1:15:03] that nobody on the earth was like Job.
[1:15:10] But look at what Job passed through.
[1:15:16] He lost everything.
[1:15:20] He was trusting.
[1:15:25] It was not easy.
[1:15:27] I believe that nobody among us want to
[1:15:30] be
[1:15:32] like child.
[1:15:35] Even we know the end of the story.
[1:15:39] Even we know that after the trials God
[1:15:44] blessed him twice.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; But the trial is heaven.
[1:15:55] If you are in the trial,
[1:15:58] if you are chasting
[1:16:00] tonight, God want to tell you
[1:16:04] that is because [music] he love you.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; He want you to come back.
[1:16:12] He want you to do something for him.
[1:16:17] He want you to love him more.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; to express your love to him.
[1:16:29] So in our relationship,
[1:16:32] God our father
[1:16:35] is showing to us his fatherhood love and
[1:16:41] we have to express to [music] him our
[1:16:44] sunship, our daughtership love
[1:16:49] to him.
[1:16:51] If we can bow our head.
[1:16:55] Lord Jesus,
[1:17:00] how you love us.
[1:17:04] We know [music] that we are nothing.
[1:17:08] We could do nothing without you.
[1:17:13] I know some some some of us
[1:17:17] passing through the trio.
[1:17:22] Oh, tonight [music]
[1:17:24] we thank you
[1:17:27] because we know that you take care of
[1:17:30] [music] everything about us.
[1:17:35] Even in the difficult condition,
[1:17:39] we know as Samson
[1:17:42] there's a [music] possibility.
[1:17:45] You have every time a possibility
[1:17:49] to [music] do something for us.
[1:17:54] May you
[1:17:56] come and [music] strength us
[1:17:59] and help us to be
[1:18:02] close [music] to you
[1:18:04] to love you more.
[1:18:09] We thank [music] you tonight.
[1:18:13] I commit all my brothers, my sister in
[1:18:15] your hands.
[1:18:18] I commit our pastor to brother David in
[1:18:21] your hand and
[1:18:24] every one of us.
[1:18:28] May you [music] just every day, every
[1:18:31] time
[1:18:32] express your love to us as you want.
[1:18:39] Thank you for your Lord.
[1:18:42] In Jesus [music] Christ's name we pray.
[1:18:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:06] Let's all stand [music] and sing it
[1:19:07] tonight.
[1:19:10] Amen. Aren't you glad for his love
[1:19:11] tonight? Amen. The guiding hand. How
[1:19:15] deep the father's [singing]
[1:19:18] love for us. Oh, I asked
[1:19:23] [music and singing]
[1:19:25] beyond all measure
[1:19:30] that he should [music] give his holy
[1:19:35] [singing]
[1:19:36] son
[1:19:38] to make [music]
[1:19:41] his [singing] treasure.
[1:19:46] How great [music]
[1:19:48] the pain of seeing
[1:19:51] heart.
[1:19:54] The father
[1:19:56] turn [music] his face away
[1:20:02] as [music and singing] wolves above the
[1:20:05] chosen
[1:20:09] [music] will bring many
[1:20:11] sons to glory.
[1:20:17] Behold [singing and music]
[1:20:19] her head upon the cloud.

[1:20:26] upon [music] each shoulder.
[1:20:32] My shame I [music] hear the
[1:20:37] voice.
[1:20:39] Oh, call out among the star.
[1:20:45] [music]
[1:20:47] Oh, it was my sin. I held [music] him.
[1:20:53] Hallelujah.
[1:20:55] And
[1:20:56] he was [music and singing]
[1:20:58] a pro.
[1:21:02] His [music and singing] thy
[1:21:04] bread has brought me. [music]
[1:21:08] Oh, I know that it [singing]
[1:21:12] is. [music]

[1:21:41] me.
[1:21:44] Oh, how [music and singing] great.
[1:21:52] Oh, how [music] great

[1:21:59] Oh, his [music] blood is cleansed by my
[1:22:03] every heart

[1:28:44] Lord bless you tonight. I trust you're
[1:28:46] all looking forward to our meetings uh
[1:28:49] this weekend.
[1:28:50] Uh we just ask you to reach out to uh
[1:28:56] yeah all our church members, everybody
[1:28:58] that you know and then encourage them to
[1:29:01] come on the Friday and Saturday night
[1:29:04] and maybe get here just a little bit
[1:29:07] early to help our deacons with seating
[1:29:10] and just kind of move up to the front.
[1:29:14] And uh I really enjoyed tonight's
[1:29:17] [music] message. You know, that's what
[1:29:20] gives you real Christian strength,
[1:29:23] that you can go through the test and the
[1:29:25] trials with victory, knowing that God's
[1:29:30] for [music] you and that he'll get you
[1:29:32] through and that makes a strong church.
[1:29:36] Amen. Pray for Matthew. He just got done
[1:29:38] preaching [music] three meetings and
[1:29:41] he's helping us with the meetings this
[1:29:43] weekend. The Lord will strengthen him.
[1:29:45] And we thank Billy and brother Andrew
[1:29:48] for preaching this weekend. It was uh
[1:29:51] really good and and [music] we had a
[1:29:54] good time in uh Tucson. I think the Lord
[1:29:59] was fruitful there. [music] And then one
[1:30:02] other thing I'd like to ask is that
[1:30:05] all the single brothers that drive,
[1:30:09] [music] if you would park on the back of
[1:30:12] the lot, the lot will finally be all
[1:30:14] cleaned out.
[1:30:16] Every st is available so all the young
[1:30:19] brothers and everything you park back
[1:30:23] there. You know what I mean? Like the
[1:30:25] last spot back there is just for you.
[1:30:29] Okay. So, praise the Lord. And you have
[1:30:32] the spot next to him. And then I think
[1:30:35] you get the message, huh? You love the
[1:30:37] Lord. You know, I thought this weekend I
[1:30:41] just my heart is hear ye him.
[1:30:44] I I'm really anxious to what the Lord
[1:30:46] has to say to us. And as our brother so
[1:30:49] beautifully
[1:30:51] uh
[1:30:53] laid it out there is that it's
[1:30:56] individual. So God will certainly speak
[1:30:59] to our hearts. So let's bow our heads
[1:31:01] and ask the Lord to bless our [music]
[1:31:03] services.
[1:31:05] And uh and then also one [music] other
[1:31:09] point if anybody has a little time
[1:31:12] tomorrow uh we need to have some brick
[1:31:15] stacked [music] and we certainly if you
[1:31:18] can help us just give us a call. So let
[1:31:20] us bow our heads. Our gracious heavenly
[1:31:22] father,
[1:31:26] as our brother spoke that you stand at
[1:31:29] the door
[1:31:31] and you knock
[1:31:33] because you have something to say to us.
[1:31:36] And father, may we hear when you come by
[1:31:40] to speak and you come by to knock on our
[1:31:43] heart. Father, may our spirits be
[1:31:48] to a spot that, Father, we listen
[1:31:52] and we receive what it is that you have
[1:31:56] for us and the direction you'd like our
[1:31:59] heart and our spirit to [music] go,
[1:32:02] Father, that we would improve our
[1:32:06] Christian walk because we know that
[1:32:09] you're preparing us for your soon
[1:32:11] coming, Father, for the rapture as we
[1:32:15] would believe and look up for that we'd
[1:32:18] be translated from this dimension to
[1:32:21] another. And we're just trusting,
[1:32:24] Father, that that you would help us this
[1:32:27] weekend move closer [music] to that
[1:32:31] rapturing condition and that rapturing
[1:32:34] faith. Bless each of us, Father. Let
[1:32:37] none of the trials of the enemy keep us
[1:32:40] from moving forward. May we not doubt
[1:32:43] your love for us, Father, but may we be
[1:32:46] ever true, knowing that you laid your
[1:32:48] life down for us, and that nothing can
[1:32:51] pluck us out of the palm of your hand.
[1:32:55] We ask you to bless us now. In Jesus
[1:32:58] [music] precious name we pray. Amen.
[1:33:01] Let's sing this song as our dismissal.
[1:33:03] [music] There's nothing like the
[1:33:05] presence of the Lord. God bless you.
[1:33:08] Amen.
[1:33:09] Oh, there's nothing
[1:33:13] [music]
[1:33:20] [music] like the presence of the Lord.
[1:33:24] [singing]
[1:33:27] There is nothing
[1:33:30] presence [music]
[1:33:33] by the presence.
[1:33:38] The presence [music and singing] of the
[1:33:40] Lord.
[1:33:44] I am free [music and singing]
[1:33:48] in his presence.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; I am here [singing]
[1:33:56] in his presence.
[1:34:00] For I forgive. [music]
[1:34:02] [singing]
[1:34:05] I'm not the same. I [music] am changing.
[1:34:17] [music]
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:35:03] [music]
[1:35:11] Heat. Heat.
[1:35:36] Heat. Heat.
[1:35:41] [music]
[1:35:43] Hallelujah.
[1:35:55] [music]
[1:36:04] Heat. Heat.
[1:36:11] [music]
