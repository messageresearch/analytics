[42:14] if you're here Sunday I hope you sing
[42:16] again let's open our Bibles while we're
[42:18] standing to thank you
[42:20] musicians John CH 4 verse we're going to
[42:23] read from verse 7 to 10
[42:49] if you're there say
[42:51] Amen the scripture
[42:54] reads there cometh the woman of Samaria
[42:57] to draw water Jesus saith unto her give
[43:01] me to drink for his disciples were gone
[43:04] away into the city to buy meat then
[43:07] saith the woman of Samaria unto him how
[43:10] is it that thou being a Jew asth drink
[43:14] of me which am a woman of Samaria for
[43:17] the Jews have no dealings with the
[43:19] Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto
[43:22] her if thou knowest the gift of God and
[43:25] who it is that say thee give me to drink
[43:28] thou wouldest have asked of him and he
[43:30] would have given thee Living Waters
[43:32] we'll turn again to Mark chapter
[43:43] 7 we're going to read in verse starting
[43:46] from verse uh let's
[43:49] see verse five we read this text the
[43:53] last time we spoke speaking about um
[43:57] message versus
[43:59] tradition understanding that you you you
[44:02] can't
[44:04] have
[44:06] one you can't have tradition and then
[44:09] use the tradition to try to make it
[44:12] conform to the word and to make the word
[44:14] fit how you see things and how you
[44:16] believe but either you have the message
[44:19] and its Purity unadulterated
[44:22] unmixed or you have tradition which is
[44:24] mixed it's something that man comes up
[44:26] with
[44:28] so we'll read it says then Pharisees and
[44:30] scribes asked him why walk not thy
[44:33] disciples according to the tradition of
[44:35] the elders but eat bread with unwashed
[44:37] hands he answered and said unto them
[44:40] well ha his Zas prophesied of you
[44:42] Hypocrites as it is written this people
[44:45] honth me with their lips but their heart
[44:47] is far from me how be it in vain do they
[44:51] worship me teaching for doctrines the
[44:53] Commandments of man for laying aside the
[44:56] command of God ye hold the tradition of
[44:58] man as the washing of pots and cups and
[45:01] many other such like things you do and
[45:04] he saith unto them full well you reject
[45:06] the Commandment of God that you may keep
[45:09] your own tradition for Moses said honor
[45:11] thy father and thy mother and who so
[45:13] curse his father and mother let him die
[45:15] the death but ye say if I man shall say
[45:19] to this father and mother it is Corbin
[45:21] that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou
[45:23] mightest be profited by me he shall be
[45:26] free and ye suffer him no more to do
[45:29] ought to his father or his mother I want
[45:31] to draw our attention to this verse here
[45:34] verse 13 making the word of God of none
[45:37] effect through your tradition which he
[45:40] have delivered and many such things like
[45:43] many such things like things do ye you
[45:45] may be seated may the Lord add a
[45:47] blessing to the reading of his
[45:50] word when we were when we were last here
[45:53] we
[45:54] spoke and touched on a little bit about
[45:57] tradition and and looking at the
[45:59] different aspects of tradition that it's
[46:02] it's a it's a learned trait it's
[46:04] something that's been taught over time
[46:06] passed down and often times when if
[46:09] we're not careful tradition slowly
[46:11] becomes law and it becomes something
[46:14] that you can pull for and draw from and
[46:16] claim that if it's not this way then
[46:18] scripturally it's wrong but I find you
[46:21] always have to bring back whatever it is
[46:23] that's being presented to you to the
[46:24] word filter it to the word give it a
[46:27] word test like a prophet would say if
[46:29] you can't find it in the word then leave
[46:30] it where it's at and in looking at
[46:33] things we saw
[46:34] that tradition is a very dangerous
[46:38] thing the scripture tells us that
[46:41] because of the man's tradition you've
[46:43] made the word of God of none effect and
[46:45] we understand that the prophet would
[46:46] speak in terms of tradition he speak
[46:48] about the spirit behind it that often
[46:51] times it's not necessarily what the the
[46:53] exact tradition is although not some are
[46:56] good some are bad but it's the spirit
[46:58] behind it TR tradition has such a power
[47:01] and such a hold on people that sometimes
[47:05] somebody could feel ostracized somebody
[47:07] could feel like for to give an example
[47:09] for for those who are may not all the
[47:12] way understand like in it's an American
[47:15] tradition that I'm not saying all of you
[47:18] participate in this tradition but just
[47:20] an example that sometimes there's a f
[47:22] family heirloom it may be a ring it may
[47:25] be something and it's passed down from
[47:27] generation to generation and they're
[47:29] expecting you to take that ring and if
[47:31] you're a man to propose with that ring
[47:33] to whoever is you find to be your mate
[47:36] and sometimes when you go away from
[47:38] those things and you don't choose to
[47:39] participate in that you may be looked at
[47:41] as someone going against the ways of the
[47:43] family someone going against something
[47:46] that's been established for
[47:48] years and I you know looking at the word
[47:50] I find it odd because brother Brandon
[47:52] would call us an oddball he would call
[47:54] us a called out people separated from
[47:56] the things of this world we don't have
[47:58] our identity in the things that goes on
[48:00] in this world we are believers of the
[48:02] end time message the way we do things
[48:04] the way we act the way we carry
[48:06] ourselves everything that we are is in
[48:08] accordance with the word so if the word
[48:11] that the prophet preached which is the
[48:12] revealed word of the hour it this it
[48:14] made this book into a new book it was no
[48:16] longer the same book that it once was so
[48:19] if this is a new book and it's a new way
[48:21] of living we We R read in the church age
[48:24] book where brother Brandon would say
[48:25] that this is not the old creation made
[48:28] over this is the new creation one that
[48:30] never was and Jesus Christ was the first
[48:33] of that race and we are coming into that
[48:35] existence he's adopting more Sons to
[48:37] come into that revelation of being true
[48:39] sons being like Christ was so if Christ
[48:42] wasn't the old made over then we can't
[48:45] now say we're going to take certain
[48:47] things from the way we used to do things
[48:49] and we're going to take this message
[48:50] we're going to mix it together where we
[48:52] see fit what whatever conforms with how
[48:54] I choose to live life I'll call that the
[48:56] word
[48:57] well that's not what happened in this
[48:58] day we received the prophet who had thus
[49:01] sayeth the Lord who had the way of
[49:03] living for you as a Believer the reason
[49:05] you're called a Believer is not for just
[49:07] happen chance it's not for the sake of
[49:09] just using the word but you are believer
[49:12] because you have accepted the word
[49:13] that's been preached to you and it's
[49:15] more than just accepting now it's a life
[49:17] being lived because Satan can knows this
[49:19] message Satan knows his message is true
[49:21] but he can't live it but you and I who
[49:23] have the ability to accept the message
[49:25] take the message and live by the message
[49:28] were called to a higher
[49:33] standard we'll look into the uh sermon
[49:36] brother Brandon preached and Jesus
[49:37] Christ the same yesterday today and
[49:39] forever paragraph
[49:42] 55 uh no 1955 806 paragraph 38 my
[49:50] apologies the script the the word says
[49:52] now notice why he did it listen why he
[49:55] did it listen at him when he addresses
[49:57] him Rabbi teacher see Rabbi we we who
[50:01] the Pharisees the religious world we
[50:04] know that thou are a teacher come from
[50:06] God this is Nicodemus speaking why
[50:10] because you got a degree no because you
[50:12] speak so eloquent no because that you
[50:14] are an educated man no because you
[50:17] belong to a certain denomination no we
[50:20] know that TH or a teacher come from God
[50:22] why because no man can do the things
[50:25] that you do except God was with him
[50:27] there you are not no man could teach the
[50:30] things that you do not no man could
[50:32] teach theology you you do not no man
[50:35] could do these things or teach the Bible
[50:36] like you do but no man could do the
[50:39] works that you do there's one thing to
[50:41] teach something there's another thing
[50:43] for God to confirm it and say it's the
[50:46] truth there's one thing to say something
[50:48] it's another thing to do something it's
[50:50] not hearers it's doers show me your
[50:54] faith without your works I'll show you
[50:56] my faith sayith Paul by my works if you
[50:59] believe it you'll act upon it that oh
[51:02] that's good that's it then your faith
[51:04] becomes works and God can go with you
[51:07] we'll stop for a moment here and draw
[51:08] your attention to
[51:09] this brother benam is saying here if you
[51:13] believe it you'll act upon it I wonder
[51:18] sometimes if we've gotten too
[51:19] comfortable and now we're trying to turn
[51:21] the the saying that I'm a I'm a message
[51:23] believer into tradition if we're just if
[51:26] we were just taking this word you know I
[51:28] believe in the message of the end time I
[51:29] believe in William Brandon he's the
[51:30] prophet I believe in Revelation 10:7 I
[51:33] believe in all these things these
[51:34] Mysteries that been revealed and all
[51:36] this word but where's the life that
[51:37] backs up the belief and that's what
[51:39] brother bandam is addressing here he
[51:41] said we know that your teacher come from
[51:43] God we Pharisees well why don't you come
[51:45] and join with me then why don't you
[51:47] believe me well of course we have
[51:49] regulation our regulation is a tradition
[51:52] of the elders which says if you don't
[51:54] belong to the Sanhedrin of denomination
[51:56] he read J Jerusalem well we be we all
[51:59] will be excommunicated and therefore we
[52:02] can accept it that's
[52:05] interesting they knew he was a man come
[52:08] from God they knew what he was doing
[52:10] that no man could do it but God but for
[52:13] the simple fact that it didn't happen
[52:15] the way they wanted it to they couldn't
[52:18] accept it I I I really want you to put
[52:21] yourself in the story right we we've
[52:24] received a message
[52:27] we've received
[52:28] Christ now what are we doing with this
[52:31] Christ that we've
[52:33] received if we're not careful we're
[52:35] doing the exact same thing that's being
[52:37] seen here oh I know it's true I know
[52:39] it's right I know I should live by it I
[52:41] know it's the way to get to heaven you
[52:42] know if I want to make a Rapture I got
[52:43] to believe this message and live
[52:45] according to it but yet there's no
[52:47] action behind it it gets really
[52:48] uncomfortable when it goes into your
[52:50] life and you start saying you know you
[52:51] ought not to be doing that you know you
[52:54] ought not to be living that way you know
[52:56] you ought not to be watching that
[52:57] speaking in that
[53:00] manner we got to take inventory look at
[53:02] your
[53:03] life what are you holding to if you
[53:06] don't have the actions of the word then
[53:08] where where are your actions
[53:13] at and yet was willing to admit it says
[53:16] and therefore we can't accept it and yet
[53:19] was willing to admit that no man could
[53:21] do the things that he did except God be
[53:24] with him
[53:27] brother brandom speaks in the sermon the
[53:29] infallibility of God's spoken word in
[53:33] 56 I I I really want us to as as I was
[53:37] looking at
[53:39] this I I couldn't help but see brother
[53:41] Brandon time and time again he's he's
[53:44] really trying to get us as people to
[53:46] understand that God can't really do
[53:49] anything with us so long as we're
[53:51] holding on to things that aren't
[53:53] relevant to what he's revealed you and
[53:56] if you're if you're not careful you'll
[53:59] think that you're walking in the
[54:01] Revelation but you're not really walking
[54:04] there because there's still still
[54:05] certain parts of your life that haven't
[54:07] fully been given over to the word we're
[54:10] trying to have a Oneness with the word
[54:12] to become one with the word you can't
[54:14] become one with something you don't feed
[54:16] on you can't become one with something
[54:18] that you don't listen to something that
[54:20] you don't have a relationship with it's
[54:23] the relationship with the word that
[54:25] brings the life of the word into your
[54:27] life but if you've got no relationship
[54:30] with the word then what good are you
[54:32] you're just like a tree when the wind
[54:34] comes you you move side to side when
[54:36] this happens you move here if a tornado
[54:38] comes by you get uprooted and moved but
[54:41] where's the foundation that keeps you in
[54:42] the word when trials and tribulations
[54:45] come you're supposed to have a word
[54:46] answer for things you're supposed to
[54:48] have a word action for things when
[54:50] things come but no because we're not
[54:52] grounded in the word because we're not
[54:53] living in the word and dwelling in it
[54:56] some times when things happen our action
[54:58] does not reflect the word but it
[55:00] reflects the
[55:03] man brother brandham says paragraph 43
[55:06] so when he made a promise that Christ
[55:07] would come they believed it when Christ
[55:10] come he ought to be the greatest answer
[55:12] to this latter that I know of he talked
[55:14] one one time an Israelite in whom
[55:16] there's no G when Philip came to him and
[55:18] got saved he went out and got Nathaniel
[55:21] and measuring that off that's from where
[55:22] Jesus was preaching that day you had to
[55:24] go around the mountain way over several
[55:26] miles where he found Nathaniel under a
[55:28] tree praying here stood the Son of God
[55:31] people did many didn't believe it the
[55:33] poor people believed it the poor
[55:35] received them they believed it they
[55:36] believed in the Supernatural but the
[55:38] Orthodox the starchy all it's telepathy
[55:41] see they didn't believe it yet they
[55:43] professed they believe the word but
[55:45] believing in in the way of their
[55:48] tradition and believing it and believing
[55:51] it the way God wrote it was two
[55:53] different things butam says believing it
[55:55] in the the way of their tradition and
[55:58] believing it in the way God wrote it was
[56:01] two different things Jesus was coming
[56:05] the way God promised it Hallelujah and
[56:09] there he stands here a man of low estate
[56:11] born a human being standing with one
[56:13] robe in his lifetime poor not a place to
[56:15] lay his head how could this be
[56:17] Aristocrats God you see it couldn't be
[56:20] but he was God to the poor he was God to
[56:23] those who would believe him and though
[56:25] and there he stood there and Nathaniel
[56:27] he was so excited or Philip rather he
[56:30] went around about four or five miles
[56:32] around and behind the mountain and found
[56:33] Nathaniel under a tree praying so he
[56:36] just waited till he got through praying
[56:38] then he got up he said come see who we
[56:40] found Jesus of Nazareth the son of
[56:44] Joseph listen to Nathaniel's response
[56:47] how could any good thing come out of
[56:49] Nazareth you one might think what's this
[56:53] connotation that they have towards the
[56:56] people of
[56:58] Nazareth if we're not careful we start
[57:01] doing the same
[57:02] thing man what good could come from a
[57:06] Kian what good could come from an
[57:09] Indian what good could come from an
[57:12] American what good could come from an
[57:14] African you put whatever name you want
[57:15] to put on it when God does something
[57:18] through a man it's not the vessel in
[57:20] which you're looking at it's what's
[57:22] being said behind the vessel that's the
[57:24] focus
[57:28] he says what good thing come out of
[57:31] Nazareth I think he gave him the best
[57:33] answer I know of telling anybody he said
[57:36] come and see that's the best thing to do
[57:39] they say is there anything to that
[57:41] oldtime heartfelt religion come and see
[57:44] that's the best thing get some of it one
[57:47] time then you be the judge see that's
[57:50] our problem we don't want to get a taste
[57:53] we just want to sit back and judge and
[57:55] judge judge and judge and judge but you
[57:58] get away from the noise get away from
[58:00] the distraction of people having their
[58:02] opinion about this you know you're
[58:04] supposed to stand firm with the word if
[58:06] you've received a revelation of
[58:07] something and you know it's according to
[58:09] the word it doesn't matter what SE and
[58:12] so says it doesn't matter the pressures
[58:14] that are placed upon you oh you know for
[58:16] 2,000 years we did things this way for
[58:19] 3,000 I don't a million years we did
[58:21] things this way when this word came
[58:23] forth that we have in this hour it had
[58:26] to uninstall any idea that you had that
[58:29] you thought was right because every man
[58:32] was looking for the truth every man was
[58:34] looking for an answer but God gave that
[58:36] answer to one
[58:38] man when he begin to
[58:41] sound at his voice not the voice of mom
[58:46] not the voice of dad not the voice of
[58:48] Uncle not the voice of Pastor put
[58:51] whatever name you want there at his
[58:54] voice when he begin to sound the
[58:56] mysteries of God was
[58:59] finished brother brother Matthew last
[59:02] last Sunday was was was preaching and I
[59:05] I I had this in my notes before he spoke
[59:08] and I'm like man Lord You're Lord you're
[59:09] wonderful and and it it brought me to
[59:13] remember we're speaking about the spirit
[59:14] of tradition and and and how if that
[59:17] crepes in too much it'll stop you from
[59:20] receiving the word in its
[59:22] fullness in numbers in the story of
[59:24] Miriam and Aaron when they're going
[59:26] against Moses now think about the
[59:28] condition in which they're doing it in
[59:30] they're his
[59:31] siblings older so it's I'm big
[59:35] brother I'm I'm your I'm the eldest
[59:38] Uncle I'm the oldest this I you know
[59:41] I've been around a couple more years
[59:43] than you have I have a right to say this
[59:45] why would God speak to you you're
[59:46] younger than me you don't know more than
[59:48] me you've only been in this message how
[59:51] long and you're going to tell me what
[59:52] the message
[59:54] says what Authority do you have I've got
[59:57] experience I've been here 50 years more
[1:00:00] than you you could have been here a
[1:00:02] thousand years more than me when brother
[1:00:04] brandom says something I'm going to hold
[1:00:05] to it if you won't that's a you problem
[1:00:08] that's not me we have to have that kind
[1:00:10] of an attitude that we hold to the word
[1:00:12] and knowing whom we believe in and it it
[1:00:15] it it struck me because they were going
[1:00:18] against Moses because of the Ethiopian
[1:00:21] women whom he had
[1:00:23] married one might say they were right to
[1:00:25] go go against him did not the Lord say
[1:00:29] that it's unjust for an Israelite to be
[1:00:32] with somebody that wasn't an
[1:00:35] Israelite oh I see him doing wrong you
[1:00:38] know brother brandom spoke that one time
[1:00:39] and it didn't come to
[1:00:42] pass brother brandom said this thing one
[1:00:44] time and I can't quite see it in the
[1:00:47] word I don't know where he pulled it
[1:00:49] from I don't know how he got
[1:00:51] this I I want us to really understand
[1:00:53] there's a difference between us and that
[1:00:55] man
[1:00:57] he was born a
[1:01:00] prophet there was no studying that he
[1:01:02] had to do learn all the scriptures learn
[1:01:05] all this then the third he barely knew
[1:01:07] the things he said
[1:01:09] himself then who's speaking cuz what
[1:01:12] Authority was he speaking under if he
[1:01:14] barely knew what he was speaking
[1:01:17] of my goodness and he said hath the Lord
[1:01:22] indeed spoken only by Moses hath he not
[1:01:25] spoken also o by us and the Lord heard
[1:01:28] it that struck me we know the Lord hears
[1:01:31] everything and knows everything but he
[1:01:34] had to specify In This Moment he heard
[1:01:38] it now the now the man Moses was very
[1:01:42] Meek above all the men were upon the
[1:01:43] face of the earth and the Lord spake
[1:01:45] suddenly unto Moses and and unto Aaron
[1:01:48] and unto Miriam come out ye three into
[1:01:50] the Tabernacle of the congregation and
[1:01:53] they three came out and the Lord came
[1:01:55] down and the pillar of the cloud and
[1:01:57] stood in the door of the Tabernacle
[1:01:59] pillar of the
[1:02:00] cloud and called Aaron and Miriam and
[1:02:04] they both came forth and he said hear
[1:02:06] now my
[1:02:07] words if there be a prophet among you I
[1:02:11] the Lord will make myself known unto him
[1:02:13] in a vision and will speak unto him in a
[1:02:16] dream my servant Moses is not
[1:02:21] so who is faithful in on mine house with
[1:02:25] him will I speak mouth to mouth even
[1:02:29] apparently and not in dark speeches in
[1:02:32] other words not in
[1:02:34] Parables not in things that he doesn't
[1:02:36] understand no I'm breaking it down to
[1:02:38] him so he understands what he's speaking
[1:02:42] about and the similitud of the Lord
[1:02:44] Shall Behold wherefore
[1:02:47] then were you not afraid to speak
[1:02:50] against my servant
[1:02:54] Moses this mage message that was
[1:02:56] preached by William brandom is directly
[1:02:59] from God
[1:03:00] himself it has the answer for
[1:03:05] everything there's not one thing he
[1:03:08] didn't speak
[1:03:10] about I'll say it again there's not one
[1:03:13] thing he didn't speak about God made
[1:03:17] sure he didn't leave you any room to say
[1:03:21] oh no brother brandom never touched that
[1:03:23] subject so I'm going to keep on doing it
[1:03:25] the way I see fits he touched every
[1:03:28] subject everything the believer has need
[1:03:31] of to make a Rapture any decision you
[1:03:34] want to make business advice it's
[1:03:37] there F fatherly advice is there how to
[1:03:41] be a mother it's there we saw that
[1:03:43] through the posum we saw that through
[1:03:44] the mother Eagle time and time again
[1:03:46] anything you have need of it's an
[1:03:49] absolute for a reason your absolute has
[1:03:52] to have the answers if it doesn't it
[1:03:54] can't be your ab Absolut so if you have
[1:03:57] a question about something how do I go
[1:04:00] about this you look no further than the
[1:04:03] revealed word of the hour the prophet
[1:04:06] didn't speak of his own opinion I I I I
[1:04:09] have to I have to say this point I was I
[1:04:11] was hesitant but I have to the prophet
[1:04:14] didn't speak an American
[1:04:18] message oh but he's American you know he
[1:04:21] was born in Kentucky he had no education
[1:04:24] but he could outspeak you and
[1:04:27] I certain languages he would use you
[1:04:30] would say vernacular you like how did
[1:04:31] you learn that with your education where
[1:04:34] it stopped the understanding you have of
[1:04:37] science the comprehension you have of
[1:04:41] things this was more than a
[1:04:45] man do do you honestly believe that God
[1:04:49] would send a message and tailor it to a
[1:04:52] specific
[1:04:53] culture to a specific specific way of
[1:04:56] leaving of living I don't I don't
[1:04:58] believe in a god like that he told us
[1:05:03] from all
[1:05:04] Kindred from all kinds they would all
[1:05:07] come under one
[1:05:10] headship when that Capstone came
[1:05:13] down it didn't say you know you know I
[1:05:16] have I have an American
[1:05:19] message I have an Indian message I have
[1:05:23] an America I have an African message
[1:05:26] now you believe according to what your
[1:05:28] culture is you believe according to your
[1:05:30] culture you believe according to your
[1:05:32] culture what what are we doing are we
[1:05:35] picking at straws
[1:05:37] guessing the same message that saves the
[1:05:40] white man is the same message that saves
[1:05:43] the black man that saves the Indian man
[1:05:45] that say it doesn't matter what the race
[1:05:47] is this message is the
[1:05:50] same it told you how to do everything it
[1:05:54] called you out of your Traditions it
[1:05:57] called you out of your way of thinkings
[1:05:59] in a little while you'll hear the
[1:06:00] prophet really speak about the hindrance
[1:06:03] that tradition has on the believer how
[1:06:05] it's hard for God to reveal himself to a
[1:06:08] Believer because they hold on to things
[1:06:11] past to the ways of doing
[1:06:14] things we got to be careful very careful
[1:06:18] let's go to the sermon the Seal of
[1:06:20] Christ preached in 55312 brother random
[1:06:23] says in paragraph 14 now over in the
[1:06:26] book of Ephesians we read what the Seal
[1:06:28] of God is what the Seal of the devil is
[1:06:31] now in Hebrews first we will go to the
[1:06:33] Seal of God for if we disbelieve
[1:06:36] willfully after we have received the
[1:06:38] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[1:06:41] no more sacrifice for sin if truth has
[1:06:44] been presented oh Hallelujah Jesus
[1:06:48] Christ came to Earth to present truth
[1:06:50] and not only TR present truth he was the
[1:06:55] truth
[1:06:56] and the religious people of that day
[1:06:58] said now we know that he is has mental
[1:07:02] telepathy we realize that he's reading
[1:07:05] their minds out
[1:07:07] there draw the parallel in the ministry
[1:07:10] but we believe that all of his healings
[1:07:12] and things he does is only by the
[1:07:16] devil because he don't agree with our
[1:07:20] denomination so they said he's a
[1:07:23] devil do you know what another word for
[1:07:25] denomination is
[1:07:28] tradition you have to study these things
[1:07:32] if you are not careful you will miss the
[1:07:34] very thing that God is trying to tell
[1:07:36] you this isn't William brandom speaking
[1:07:39] to you this is God through the voice of
[1:07:42] William brandom speaking to you this is
[1:07:44] a love letter to you the individual it
[1:07:47] speaks to you my sheep hear my voice
[1:07:52] some hear a
[1:07:53] man some he hear faults some hear
[1:07:58] mistakes
[1:08:00] misinterpretations but his sheep hear
[1:08:03] his voice his voice has no mistakes it's
[1:08:06] got no Faults behold I come in the
[1:08:09] volume of the
[1:08:12] bookall he says J said
[1:08:16] now you can say that against the son of
[1:08:19] man for you've you've got the truth
[1:08:22] presented to you you really know it's
[1:08:24] the truth in other words Nicodemus
[1:08:27] expressed it said we know Rabbi thou are
[1:08:32] we who the Pharisees the very ones that
[1:08:35] studied the word and knew the word
[1:08:38] understood the word they knew he was
[1:08:41] Rabbi a
[1:08:44] teacher we know that thou are a teacher
[1:08:47] come from God my if you won't accept him
[1:08:51] as a man come from God the world will
[1:08:55] we know it for no man could do the
[1:08:58] things like you do L God was with him
[1:09:02] and we know that you're a teacher come
[1:09:04] from God and I had to slip up here in
[1:09:08] the night time to get to talk to you in
[1:09:11] other words can you get to that next
[1:09:12] part oh tradition separating Man by
[1:09:16] their Traditions oh my brother brandham
[1:09:20] says in proof of of his resurrection
[1:09:22] 55 now the in uh parag 20 now man in his
[1:09:28] carnal condition and his mental
[1:09:31] conception he always pulls away from God
[1:09:35] it's been since the beginning that man
[1:09:38] longs to see the other side but he's
[1:09:41] Bound in a prison
[1:09:43] house sometimes tradition of man puts
[1:09:47] him there that they teach traditions of
[1:09:50] different forms and motives of how to
[1:09:52] worship and he puts men under bondage
[1:09:54] under in his tradition and that has been
[1:09:57] since the world
[1:10:01] began since the world began this has
[1:10:05] been he puts them under bondage I I find
[1:10:09] it funny when you look at it you go back
[1:10:12] to the beginning like brother Brandon
[1:10:13] would say here the Beast is offering
[1:10:18] Eve the ability to be like God to know
[1:10:23] like God to understand stand like
[1:10:27] God wasn't she already made in the image
[1:10:29] of
[1:10:31] God did not God give full authority to
[1:10:35] Adam in the beginning was he not God on
[1:10:39] Earth and yet he's being offered the
[1:10:42] chance to be
[1:10:43] God there's a perversion somewhere he
[1:10:47] already had his
[1:10:51] authority if we're not
[1:10:54] careful we will accept another offer for
[1:10:58] something God already gave
[1:11:00] you he gave you the authority to take
[1:11:04] the word wherever you see Satan find
[1:11:07] them get them out get rid of them if
[1:11:11] you're not careful you'll accept the
[1:11:13] substitute that'll kill
[1:11:16] you rather than taking the path which
[1:11:19] God gave you accept another man's
[1:11:22] opinion for there is a way that seem it
[1:11:24] just to a man and the end thereof is
[1:11:26] death take the word leave all other
[1:11:30] opinions
[1:11:31] out they don't belong it's an opinion
[1:11:35] for a reason we have a fact in this
[1:11:38] message God said it William Bram spoke
[1:11:41] it I believe it that settles
[1:11:45] it he he says but man always long to see
[1:11:49] the other side and any little thing that
[1:11:51] looks a little Supernatural the human
[1:11:53] being will run for it because it's some
[1:11:55] sort sort of a promise across the border
[1:11:57] just across the lane and what makes him
[1:11:59] do that is because he is created in the
[1:12:02] image of his maker almighty God he's
[1:12:06] created to be a worshipper of God and he
[1:12:09] must find some place to give an outlet
[1:12:13] to that feeling you see the makeup of
[1:12:17] man you were made to worship Christ in
[1:12:21] the sermon thirsting for Life brother
[1:12:23] Bram said God made every man man to
[1:12:25] thirst after him but man finds different
[1:12:28] things to quench that thirst dancing I
[1:12:31] didn't say it he said it looking SP and
[1:12:34] span all the
[1:12:36] time and he lists a bunch of things and
[1:12:39] he says man always tries to find
[1:12:41] something to quiet that voice quiet that
[1:12:44] thirst but the only thing that's been
[1:12:47] given to quench that thirst is Christ
[1:12:51] himself don't substitute that thirst you
[1:12:54] have in your life
[1:12:55] that hunger you
[1:12:57] have the devil the devil is
[1:13:00] Sly he comes in ways you least expected
[1:13:04] we hear it time and time again he's not
[1:13:05] The Devil in
[1:13:08] horns he may come in the form of your
[1:13:11] neighbor he may come in the form of your
[1:13:14] brother in the form of your sister I'm
[1:13:17] not calling your brother or your sister
[1:13:19] the devil but Jesus said depart from me
[1:13:22] Satan why because the word that was
[1:13:24] coming out
[1:13:25] was not from God he called it what it
[1:13:31] was be real careful not to crucify your
[1:13:35] own proof of his
[1:13:37] resurrection 1955 brother brandom says
[1:13:40] in paragraph 29 but man has longed to
[1:13:43] know him down through the age they've
[1:13:46] longed to know him in our text this
[1:13:48] morning our My Redeemer liveth in the
[1:13:51] early Sunday service we find out that
[1:13:54] there that joob as old as he was and way
[1:13:57] back in the first beginning he longed to
[1:13:59] know his creator in other words he said
[1:14:02] if I could knock on his door and talk to
[1:14:04] him how the human heart has longed for
[1:14:07] such things and today after 4,000 nearly
[1:14:10] 5,000 years more how much more the human
[1:14:14] heart today longs to go to his door
[1:14:17] knock at his door get acquainted with
[1:14:19] him I identify with that and then people
[1:14:21] through Traditions has blinded men from
[1:14:24] the Great great fundamental truths of
[1:14:26] the
[1:14:27] scripture now Jesus spoke the same thing
[1:14:30] when he was here on Earth he said ye are
[1:14:32] blind leaders of the blind he said if
[1:14:34] the blind leads the blind won't they all
[1:14:37] fall in the ditch now pronouncing
[1:14:39] Christian or religious teachers blind
[1:14:42] see I want to draw our attention to this
[1:14:45] God has a way of revealing himself to
[1:14:48] the people and making himself known to
[1:14:52] the people but many times s tradition
[1:14:56] shuts off the people before God can get
[1:14:59] a chance to get into them to reveal
[1:15:03] himself you get it see Traditions oh
[1:15:08] what that is today you should hear when
[1:15:09] brother Brandon is saying
[1:15:11] this that's the importance of listening
[1:15:14] to The Voice you'll hear the emphasis on
[1:15:16] where he's trying to make you can read
[1:15:19] here exclamation point and see that he
[1:15:21] probably screamed tradition but I would
[1:15:23] go back and listen there's an importance
[1:15:26] in listening you'll catch something but
[1:15:29] here he says God has a way of revealing
[1:15:31] himself to the
[1:15:33] people how many of us would like to have
[1:15:36] God reveal himself to us
[1:15:38] personally I testify I want that I want
[1:15:42] to know him as he is
[1:15:46] known but what am I holding to that's
[1:15:50] stopping me or in other words stopping
[1:15:53] him from getting to
[1:15:56] me he wants it from me more than I
[1:16:00] wanted he wants to make himself known to
[1:16:02] you he wants to become one with you he
[1:16:06] wants to reveal to you the Finer Things
[1:16:08] in life the great Mysteries the secrets
[1:16:12] that others don't know he wants to speak
[1:16:14] to you this is a love
[1:16:16] affair but how can he if we keep holding
[1:16:20] on to tradition it shuts you off from
[1:16:23] him I did didn't say it we heard it but
[1:16:27] many times tradition shuts off the
[1:16:30] people before God can get a chance to
[1:16:32] get into
[1:16:35] them Christ Living in is that not the
[1:16:38] hope we have in this hour that Christ
[1:16:41] might come and make his home in you and
[1:16:43] live the life in
[1:16:46] you you can't live this life by your
[1:16:49] strength you can't live it by your might
[1:16:52] you can't live it by your intellect you
[1:16:55] can't live it by your
[1:16:57] knowledge you've got to live it through
[1:17:01] Christ Paul said I Die daily I must
[1:17:05] decrease so Christ must
[1:17:08] increase the trouble man has had since
[1:17:11] the beginning of time is the
[1:17:14] understanding of God in a
[1:17:17] man that was God in a
[1:17:20] man it didn't stop
[1:17:23] there he was the first first fruit to
[1:17:25] come to
[1:17:27] maturity don't leave him in the
[1:17:30] Box what we saw in him Christ wants you
[1:17:34] to lower yourself enough that he might
[1:17:38] come and live in you and reveal himself
[1:17:42] then you become a partaker of that son
[1:17:45] of man Ministry you're the continuation
[1:17:47] of it but it can't happen so long as
[1:17:51] you're holding on to things that aren't
[1:17:52] profitable to you
[1:17:55] it's due time we start uninstalling the
[1:17:58] practices of old if we can't find it in
[1:18:01] this message get rid of
[1:18:05] it I'm sorry I don't know what to tell
[1:18:07] you if it's not in this message get it
[1:18:12] out did not the prophet say take the
[1:18:14] token and apply it in your home wherever
[1:18:17] you see the devil kick him
[1:18:20] out he spoke the
[1:18:22] truth if you have a TV in your home what
[1:18:24] did he say about it kabah is written at
[1:18:27] your door the glory of the Lord has
[1:18:30] departed but we'll come in and explain
[1:18:32] it
[1:18:34] away well I have it for this reason I
[1:18:37] have it for that
[1:18:38] reason brother brandom said if it's in
[1:18:40] your home the glory of the Lord has
[1:18:44] departed we have to start taking what he
[1:18:46] says for face
[1:18:49] value stop trying to find an
[1:18:52] excuse to continue living a partial
[1:18:57] life this message was meant to be lived
[1:19:00] sold
[1:19:02] out look at our Prophet look at the
[1:19:04] example he set coming from a home that
[1:19:07] that that was in
[1:19:09] alcohol father was making and brewing
[1:19:11] things look at the condition he grew up
[1:19:15] in you show me the trace of that in his
[1:19:20] life when God gets a hold of you and
[1:19:23] gives you a revelation
[1:19:25] you're no longer identified with the
[1:19:27] things of the past you are a completely
[1:19:31] new
[1:19:34] being Lord I want to die out to me I'm
[1:19:38] the culprit I'm the one that gets in the
[1:19:40] way M understanding my way of doing
[1:19:44] things I think this is right I think
[1:19:47] this is wrong well you know I have more
[1:19:50] life experience I can tell you the
[1:19:52] things that are better for you
[1:19:56] and yet still disregard the advice of
[1:19:59] the
[1:20:00] Prophet as if it was just the man
[1:20:03] speaking to
[1:20:05] us I'm speaking to myself here if you
[1:20:08] find yourself in that place take
[1:20:11] it this word is no respector of person
[1:20:15] The Man Behind here doesn't know more
[1:20:17] doesn't live any
[1:20:20] higher we're all on the same footing no
[1:20:23] big eyes no little use we're all called
[1:20:26] to live this message in its entirety not
[1:20:30] in partial in its
[1:20:34] entirety we'll say the rain falls and
[1:20:36] the just and the
[1:20:39] unjust the same rain that gives life to
[1:20:42] the wheat gives life to the
[1:20:44] weed it doesn't do away with the rain
[1:20:47] that the wheat
[1:20:49] needs it just shows what you
[1:20:52] are the prophet of God said a Believer
[1:20:55] when the doors are open is in
[1:20:59] church that doesn't eliminate the three
[1:21:01] kinds of Believers but don't use that as
[1:21:04] your excuse to not be in
[1:21:06] service you are the believer being
[1:21:10] Church what's it to you if the one next
[1:21:13] to you comes to church every service and
[1:21:14] doesn't live the life you're called to
[1:21:16] live the life you're called to be the
[1:21:19] example show them that you can stand in
[1:21:22] the word live the life
[1:21:25] and obey every single commandment that's
[1:21:27] been given to us by the prophet we read
[1:21:30] it to read it to you here last time
[1:21:32] brother brandom said if you love him
[1:21:34] you'd be there in church you'd be there
[1:21:36] in the prayer services you'd be there if
[1:21:39] you love
[1:21:42] him oh my isn't love showing
[1:21:49] up if you if you if you work all day I'm
[1:21:53] I'm entering into territories I Haven no
[1:21:54] idea of if you work all day I can
[1:21:58] imagine if you don't come home at a
[1:22:00] certain time you'll get a
[1:22:02] call I see it from the brothers I work
[1:22:04] with where you at honey oh we're almost
[1:22:08] done I might be late
[1:22:11] today
[1:22:13] why she wants to see
[1:22:16] you or if it's vice versa he wants to
[1:22:19] see
[1:22:20] you what do you think happens here at
[1:22:23] church
[1:22:25] where two or three are gathered in my
[1:22:26] name there in the midst I'll be how many
[1:22:28] opportunities have you missed to meet
[1:22:32] Christ oh I'm fighting I'm going through
[1:22:35] this I'm going through that I'm going
[1:22:36] through this it's so hard how do I get
[1:22:39] out of it how do I get out of it what if
[1:22:41] the answer you needed was you being in
[1:22:43] the house of the
[1:22:45] Lord and something would come not from
[1:22:47] the man but from God that he would speak
[1:22:50] through the man and give you an answer
[1:22:52] to the problem that you have but no we
[1:22:55] have this greater than thou
[1:22:58] attitude I have already made
[1:23:01] it I already lived the life why do I
[1:23:05] have to come to church I'm the true
[1:23:08] Christian I live
[1:23:11] it you see how that statement
[1:23:14] contradicts you're the True Believer but
[1:23:17] you don't come to the
[1:23:22] house can you make sense of it
[1:23:27] oh you know I I I'm you know I I'm I'm
[1:23:30] rich I'm rich I'm rich but I live under
[1:23:32] a
[1:23:36] bridge I'm not sick I'm not sick I'm not
[1:23:38] sick doctor I have Corona
[1:23:41] virus give me medicine you're not sick
[1:23:45] no no no no you don't understand I'm
[1:23:46] sick give me
[1:23:49] medicine if you're a
[1:23:52] Believer if you've accepted the message
[1:23:54] message of the
[1:23:56] hour brother Brandon was the first fruit
[1:23:58] to come to maturity we're in
[1:24:01] agreeance did he not make it his
[1:24:04] obligation whether he was speaking or
[1:24:06] not to be in
[1:24:08] service if our
[1:24:11] Prophet could live that kind of a
[1:24:13] soldout life what about
[1:24:16] us we we've got to remove this this
[1:24:20] traditional
[1:24:22] mindset that if I've made it I don't
[1:24:24] need
[1:24:25] anything no you need him so long as
[1:24:30] you're alive you need him we've seen G
[1:24:34] many of Great Men Who who are in this
[1:24:37] message preach this message fall
[1:24:42] away and you think that because you've
[1:24:46] already made it you don't need to come
[1:24:47] to
[1:24:50] service it's the sacrifice you make he
[1:24:53] said it in this in the
[1:24:55] sermon
[1:24:57] uh I'm I'm I'm forgetting I'm forgetting
[1:24:59] the sermon is your life worthy of the
[1:25:01] Gospel he said it's the sacrifice you
[1:25:04] make to come to
[1:25:06] church that gives way for God to bless
[1:25:10] you I come to church not so God can
[1:25:13] bless me financially I want to specify
[1:25:16] that I'm not here so God can bless me
[1:25:20] financially I'm in church because a
[1:25:23] Believer is post of Duty is church I'm a
[1:25:27] church goer Wednesdays you won't find me
[1:25:31] Sundays you don't need
[1:25:32] me I will be
[1:25:37] here this is where I
[1:25:40] belong and it's not just the life I live
[1:25:43] here but it's taking that life going
[1:25:47] home and now living that life what good
[1:25:51] is it if you come to every service it's
[1:25:54] true the prophet said Church don't save
[1:25:57] you so don't think because you mark your
[1:25:59] presence every single Sunday every
[1:26:01] single Wednesday that you're making
[1:26:02] progress no what's required in this day
[1:26:05] is a life
[1:26:07] lived a sold out life lived for
[1:26:12] Christ God's word calls for total
[1:26:15] separation from
[1:26:17] unbelief don't stand in the presence of
[1:26:19] the son with an
[1:26:23] umbrella how will you ripen the sun's
[1:26:26] effect is not on you oh Lord how many
[1:26:29] times I walked into this building and
[1:26:31] the Word was being preached and I had an
[1:26:34] umbrella of what I think was
[1:26:36] right that don't concern me I'm good
[1:26:39] that's not for me I'm good get out of
[1:26:42] the umbrella long enough for God to let
[1:26:44] the light shine on you and change
[1:26:50] you brother brandham says in the sermon
[1:26:52] proof of his resurrection
[1:26:55] that same sermon paragraph
[1:26:58] 143 now we don't we didn't know that
[1:27:02] good people loving him but didn't know
[1:27:04] that he was risen from the dead so is it
[1:27:08] today same thing today exactly brother
[1:27:11] sister oh my God wake your innermost
[1:27:14] being people don't understand that he
[1:27:18] has raised from the dead he's not dead
[1:27:21] He's Alive and he walked out under
[1:27:25] disguised to them in the form of a man
[1:27:28] he might appear to you in the form of
[1:27:30] your neighbor he might appear to you in
[1:27:33] the form of a minister or your mother
[1:27:35] Christ appears to you in
[1:27:38] people be real careful when somebody
[1:27:40] gives you the word it could be a
[1:27:43] 2-year-old it could be a three-year-old
[1:27:45] it could be 80 it don't matter the age
[1:27:46] the word stays the word and if you're a
[1:27:49] Believer when the word spoken to you you
[1:27:50] accept it if you're not checking up you
[1:27:53] make it right and you press on don't get
[1:27:56] in the
[1:27:57] habit of disregarding somebody for the
[1:28:00] sake of the age I'm older than
[1:28:04] him our Prophet said he may appear to
[1:28:07] you in a neighbor in a brother in a
[1:28:11] minister in a
[1:28:14] mother don't be so high and mighty and
[1:28:17] set in your ways that you fail to see
[1:28:20] when Christ is speaking to you
[1:28:24] oh but you're speaking man it's just
[1:28:26] it's just us it's just us the same
[1:28:28] problem happened with the
[1:28:29] prophet here the pum is at his
[1:28:35] door needing to be prayed
[1:28:39] for and he's so
[1:28:41] set on other things that he fails to
[1:28:46] realize that posum came at your door
[1:28:48] like every other person comes to be
[1:28:51] prayed for he thought she had I think
[1:28:55] rabies he just wanted to you offer so
[1:28:58] she could go in peace without
[1:29:02] suffering but she needed to be prayed
[1:29:06] for and he received the
[1:29:09] Revelation and he prayed for her and she
[1:29:12] got well and went with her
[1:29:14] babies don't miss when Christ is trying
[1:29:17] to speak to you in whatever vessel he
[1:29:21] uses you could be at work and the most
[1:29:25] sinful person on this
[1:29:28] planet why are you here on Wednesday
[1:29:30] don't you go to
[1:29:35] church hey I used to always hear you
[1:29:37] play a tape why' you
[1:29:41] stop man you used to be all about Christ
[1:29:44] you used to be all about God but why are
[1:29:46] you going out with
[1:29:48] us where's the
[1:29:51] standard if we not careful we start ass
[1:29:54] simulated when we're supposed to stand
[1:29:57] out be different we are a called out
[1:30:00] Bunch United under the message of this
[1:30:03] hour which is none other than Christ in
[1:30:05] word
[1:30:10] form says Christ in
[1:30:15] you says go up a little bit then treat
[1:30:18] everybody right be kindly be neighborly
[1:30:22] be loving Christ is in the person Christ
[1:30:27] in you the hope of glory and as you go
[1:30:30] along and people appear to you a kind of
[1:30:34] person speak to you listen to them you
[1:30:38] don't know it might be Jesus speaking to
[1:30:41] you he appears I'll be with you even in
[1:30:45] you and as you do unto these you do unto
[1:30:49] me oh when you get to looking at it that
[1:30:51] way the old tradition Falls away see it
[1:30:55] doesn't become a form of words and the
[1:30:58] Declaration of so many words put
[1:30:59] together it becomes a living reality
[1:31:02] that Christ is in us now the Holy Spirit
[1:31:05] moving back and forth through every
[1:31:08] human being surging through the hearts
[1:31:10] searching condemning the ruins in there
[1:31:14] and as you confess it he holds it before
[1:31:16] God and the blood cleanses it
[1:31:20] Amen brother brandom says I'm coming to
[1:31:23] a close close
[1:31:24] here in the sermon the unpardonable sin
[1:31:28] paragraph 49 preached in 54 uh
[1:31:33] 1024 parag 49 he says the first thing
[1:31:36] when somebody tells me or I pick up on a
[1:31:39] recording that I have seen a vision and
[1:31:41] foretold something before I say anything
[1:31:43] about it the vision anything first I
[1:31:46] check that the vision is with the word
[1:31:49] of God and if it isn't according to the
[1:31:51] word of God I'd say it's so far thanks
[1:31:55] be to God it's always been according to
[1:31:58] the
[1:31:59] word but if it ever be contrary to the
[1:32:02] word of God I'd say don't listen to it
[1:32:06] because it's
[1:32:08] false this is the truth right here the
[1:32:11] word of God then when we come sanely
[1:32:15] sound to God when we come without any
[1:32:19] malice any Prejudice with an open heart
[1:32:22] willing to learn
[1:32:24] learn God is able to
[1:32:29] teach when we are willing to learn but
[1:32:32] we must first lay aside
[1:32:35] tradition lay aside ideas that we've
[1:32:39] been
[1:32:40] taught now I know mother taught you
[1:32:43] things that was very good and so forth
[1:32:46] but sometimes mother had things
[1:32:49] wrong I've got a mother sitting right
[1:32:52] here the very subject I'm coming to in a
[1:32:55] few minutes told me years ago that she
[1:32:57] thought the unpardonable sin was a woman
[1:33:00] was for a woman to abortion abortion
[1:33:02] case in other words take the life of a
[1:33:05] child for it was born said how could she
[1:33:07] ever be forgiven it mama in her best of
[1:33:10] her knowledge to all she knew that was
[1:33:13] true see but it isn't true according to
[1:33:16] the word of God so that makes a
[1:33:20] difference so someone said I was born a
[1:33:23] Catholic
[1:33:24] mother was a Catholic she raised me a
[1:33:26] Catholic I'll stay a Catholic well I was
[1:33:28] raised up a Baptist but I didn't stay a
[1:33:30] Baptist when I seen the word of God said
[1:33:33] contrary to what the Baptist Doctrine
[1:33:35] was I believe the word of God and let
[1:33:38] every other man's word be a lie that I
[1:33:41] don't fell out with man I say brother
[1:33:44] this is what I believe I'm still your
[1:33:47] brother but I believe this is the word
[1:33:50] of God now when you get settled
[1:33:53] Foundation Al right then you have
[1:33:55] boldness to enter
[1:33:57] in this isn't a stretch but you can take
[1:34:01] off that word Catholic you can take off
[1:34:03] that word Baptist and you can place your
[1:34:07] ethnicity I was born African I was born
[1:34:11] this I was born that wherever you're
[1:34:14] from put it there brother bam says but
[1:34:17] when I seen the word of God was contrary
[1:34:21] to those beliefs in which I was born in
[1:34:25] what do you do as a
[1:34:27] Believer that's a
[1:34:29] lie every word of God is truth and man's
[1:34:34] is a lie when you find out that the way
[1:34:38] of doing things see because it's the
[1:34:40] spirit of
[1:34:41] tradition it's not necessarily the thing
[1:34:45] it's the hold that the spirit of
[1:34:48] tradition has on a believer in so much
[1:34:52] the prophet could tell you you one
[1:34:55] thing and for the sake of him being a
[1:34:58] white man you'll throw it off and say
[1:35:01] they have their American tradition of
[1:35:03] things did not our Prophet say before
[1:35:06] I'm an American I'm a child of the
[1:35:10] king did he not say I was I was he was
[1:35:14] born a brandom he didn't become
[1:35:17] one go further I was Christ's before I
[1:35:21] became a brandom
[1:35:24] what about you what about me what's your
[1:35:27] identity my identity isn't where I was
[1:35:31] born that's the identification of the
[1:35:34] flesh my identity is Where I Come
[1:35:38] From behold I come from God and I'll go
[1:35:41] back to God I'm here for a
[1:35:46] season to live out my life in this
[1:35:49] season I'm to be a pillar a standard
[1:35:53] that no no matter what background I came
[1:35:55] from no matter what trials and struggles
[1:35:57] I came from when I met this
[1:36:01] word it changed
[1:36:04] me I was no longer those things but I
[1:36:07] became a Son of
[1:36:12] God we really got to watch
[1:36:16] it let's let's let's turn back to
[1:36:19] that scripture in John
[1:36:24] I I got
[1:36:26] a a lot more quotes
[1:36:29] but I I I feel I've gone long
[1:36:33] enough maybe another
[1:36:37] time we we see here
[1:36:46] that give me one
[1:36:51] second in John John 4
[1:36:54] my my
[1:37:03] mistake if the musicians could
[1:37:10] come John 4:7 here we have the the the
[1:37:14] women of Samaria and as I as I was
[1:37:16] reading this you know because when when
[1:37:19] you read the Bible you don't read it
[1:37:20] like a
[1:37:21] book you when when you read it you're
[1:37:24] reading it with a desire to understand
[1:37:26] for God to reveal and speak to you it's
[1:37:29] a conversation when I read my Bible it's
[1:37:31] not me just reading it for an ordinance
[1:37:33] sake so as as I was reading this I had a
[1:37:36] question in my heart I said well the
[1:37:40] scripture says how is it that thou being
[1:37:44] a Jew asketh drink of me which am a
[1:37:49] woman of
[1:37:51] Samaria for the Jews have no dealings
[1:37:54] with the Samaritans well the Samaritans
[1:37:57] and the Jews there's a fundamental
[1:38:01] disagreement they they're they they're
[1:38:03] not of Kindred
[1:38:06] Spirits they both knew the words that
[1:38:08] were spoken by the prophets of old but
[1:38:12] the Samaritans had mixed in with with
[1:38:15] the unequally yolked so they were half
[1:38:17] Jew half
[1:38:19] non-jew and as Jesus here sends his
[1:38:23] disciples go
[1:38:24] away and he goes to that woman I have
[1:38:28] need to go by
[1:38:31] Samaria him being Jew by when you look
[1:38:34] at him says why what business does do
[1:38:37] you Jew have speaking with
[1:38:41] me it must have been years and years of
[1:38:45] an idea of a system of a tradition that
[1:38:50] you stay away from these kind of people
[1:38:53] because they're not like
[1:38:55] you and yet she's faced with God
[1:39:01] himself speaking to her woman give me a
[1:39:07] drink and it stumbles
[1:39:10] her she couldn't look past in that
[1:39:14] moment for a second what she was looking
[1:39:19] at let's be real careful
[1:39:22] Saints let's not make the same
[1:39:25] mistake let's not just look at what the
[1:39:27] vessel looks like but let's look at the
[1:39:30] words that's being
[1:39:32] spoke and Jesus speaks to her and says
[1:39:35] if thou knewest the gift of God and who
[1:39:38] it is that say it to thee give me a
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:45] drink that Prophet stood
[1:39:49] there I'm your brother
[1:39:54] I don't speak these things of
[1:39:57] myself the angel told me in the back to
[1:39:59] say this to
[1:40:01] you if we're not careful we start doing
[1:40:04] the same thing and not know it we start
[1:40:07] looking at him what business do you
[1:40:10] have that's what the Full Gospel
[1:40:12] businessman did to
[1:40:14] him here they were supporting him when
[1:40:18] he's doing all the signs and wonders and
[1:40:20] the Miracles and so forth and the moment
[1:40:22] he starts opening up that word to break
[1:40:24] bread to speak those Revelations those
[1:40:27] strong Meats they say oh leave that
[1:40:29] alone we don't want to hear that just go
[1:40:33] back to the Divine Healing campaigns go
[1:40:36] back to that go back to that they didn't
[1:40:38] want to hear it because it was
[1:40:39] condemning
[1:40:41] them let's open our hearts to understand
[1:40:44] and know when someone's speaking to us
[1:40:47] the word of God that we accept
[1:40:51] it it says and he would have given them
[1:40:55] Living Water the woman said unto him
[1:40:58] sir thou H has nothing to draw with and
[1:41:02] the well is
[1:41:03] deep from whence then H has thou that
[1:41:06] living water are thou greater than our
[1:41:10] father Jacob which gave us the well and
[1:41:13] drank thereof himself and his children
[1:41:15] and his cattle Jesus answered and said
[1:41:18] unto her whosoever drinketh of this
[1:41:22] water shall thirst again but whatsoever
[1:41:26] whosoever drinketh of the water that I
[1:41:28] shall give him shall never thirst but
[1:41:32] the water that I shall give him shall be
[1:41:35] in him a well of water springing up into
[1:41:40] everlasting
[1:41:42] life here he is speaking life to this
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:50] woman if you if you remember in the
[1:41:52] beginning when
[1:41:53] mzc came to visit
[1:41:56] Abraham and he tells him according to
[1:41:59] the time of life I'll visit
[1:42:02] you when he said those words the change
[1:42:07] was
[1:42:08] on she was
[1:42:11] changing after the words were spoken to
[1:42:14] her in this day we had a
[1:42:18] messenger with the word from God that
[1:42:20] when it was spoken to you the believer
[1:42:22] and you heard it it started to change
[1:42:26] you it's still changing you don't hinder
[1:42:30] it when things get uncomfortable and the
[1:42:33] prophet starts touching on things that
[1:42:34] you've held on for so long and for years
[1:42:37] and you just feel is right but the
[1:42:39] prophet's really speaking about it don't
[1:42:42] get in the
[1:42:43] Shell open your heart this is open heart
[1:42:48] surgery unless you open yourself how do
[1:42:50] you expect to be dealt with
[1:42:55] he says the woman said unto him
[1:42:57] sir give me this water that I thirst not
[1:43:02] neither come hither to draw Jesus said
[1:43:05] unto her go and call thy husband and
[1:43:07] come hither the woman answered and said
[1:43:10] I have no husband Jesus and said and
[1:43:15] Jesus said unto her thou has well said I
[1:43:18] have no husband for thou has had five
[1:43:21] husbands and he whom thou now Hast is
[1:43:25] not thy
[1:43:27] husband in that sayest thou truly the
[1:43:30] woman said unto him sir I perceive that
[1:43:33] thou are a prophet our fathers worshiped
[1:43:37] in this mountain and ye say that in
[1:43:39] Jerusalem is a place where men ought to
[1:43:41] worship Jesus said unto her woman
[1:43:44] believe me the hour cometh when ye shall
[1:43:47] neither in this mountain nor yet in
[1:43:50] Jerusalem worship the father ye worship
[1:43:53] you know not what you know what we
[1:43:55] worship for salvation is of the Jews but
[1:43:59] the hour
[1:44:00] cometh and now is when the true
[1:44:04] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:44:07] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:44:10] seeketh such to worship him God is a
[1:44:13] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:44:16] worship Him in spirit and in truth the
[1:44:20] woman saith unto him I know that mess is
[1:44:24] cometh which is called Christ when he is
[1:44:28] come he will tell us all things Jesus
[1:44:32] said unto her I that speak unto thee am
[1:44:36] he
[1:44:38] oh
[1:44:40] church we heard a greater than Solomon
[1:44:42] is here we heard a greater than all of
[1:44:45] them is here who is here in our midst
[1:44:51] now I that speaketh un to thee is
[1:44:55] he and upon this came the disciples and
[1:44:59] marveled he talked with the
[1:45:02] woman yet no man said what seekest thou
[1:45:07] or what talkest thou with her the woman
[1:45:10] then left her water pot and went her way
[1:45:12] into the City and saith unto men come
[1:45:16] see a
[1:45:19] man come see a man which told me
[1:45:23] all the things I ever did is not this
[1:45:27] the
[1:45:29] Christ and in this hour we receiv
[1:45:32] received the
[1:45:33] sign when that word was preached it
[1:45:37] called me by name it told me how I was
[1:45:42] living it was wrong and what I was
[1:45:45] called To Live By it quite literally
[1:45:49] spoke me into existence
[1:45:53] let's not handle the word
[1:45:56] lightly let's not just take it as
[1:45:58] another book as another man just
[1:46:01] speaking you heard Christ in this day do
[1:46:06] the very same thing he did to Abraham he
[1:46:09] turned his
[1:46:11] back told him what Sarah was doing in
[1:46:14] the tent and you had a man in this hour
[1:46:17] turn his
[1:46:21] back let's not mistaken what took
[1:46:24] place you saw Christ doing the same sign
[1:46:30] Christ in a man doing the same sign
[1:46:34] because it was promised that we would
[1:46:36] have our
[1:46:39] chance hallelujah what an assurance it
[1:46:43] gives
[1:46:43] us and you notice with the woman after
[1:46:47] what took place with her after the
[1:46:49] change it didn't matter that she was
[1:46:51] Samaritan anymore
[1:46:54] she told anybody who could hear it come
[1:46:57] see a man oh what's it to
[1:47:01] you that they've been in jail their
[1:47:03] entire life what's it to you the devil's
[1:47:06] been attacking them for so long what's
[1:47:08] it to you they've lost their mind what's
[1:47:11] it to you they've become what they've
[1:47:12] become what's it to you she's a
[1:47:17] prostitute whatever the case is what
[1:47:20] Christ has done in you is not meant to
[1:47:22] be quieted
[1:47:24] you're you're meant to say It on the
[1:47:26] Mountain you're supposed to show he's
[1:47:28] alive and well the same yesterday today
[1:47:31] and forever the god that did that is now
[1:47:34] living in me and you wanting to do the
[1:47:36] same thing for somebody else open your
[1:47:39] hearts to receive him let him have his
[1:47:41] way let him live that life through you
[1:47:45] that you might show that sign to
[1:47:49] somebody you know you have the gift of
[1:47:51] discernment brother randam said give me
[1:47:53] two minutes with a person I'll tell you
[1:47:55] what kind of spirit they have that
[1:47:56] wasn't just to him you a Believer your
[1:47:59] spirit isn't okay when you're in the
[1:48:00] presence of somebody who doesn't believe
[1:48:01] the way you do when you find yourself in
[1:48:04] a place where music is being played that
[1:48:06] you know ain't right there's a reason
[1:48:08] your heart aches to leave there's a
[1:48:10] reason this isn't the place I should be
[1:48:11] at if you're not hearing that voice you
[1:48:14] need to quiet the other voices in your
[1:48:16] life and let that voice be the centner
[1:48:18] voice that speaks to
[1:48:20] you let's stand

[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:42] Lord
[1:56:44] hallelujah amen aren't you thankful for
[1:56:46] the word amen always drawing Us near
[1:56:50] amen giving us our Tru true identity of
[1:56:54] who we really are where we came from
[1:56:56] amen but Satan is always trying to
[1:56:58] inject things by the way we grew up and
[1:57:01] this is how you do it you know speaks
[1:57:04] about anything that stands in the way of
[1:57:08] the word of God is human tradition
[1:57:11] whether it be how we were born or you
[1:57:14] know some will take the Bible and you
[1:57:16] know but when them talk and say they
[1:57:19] take the word of God they read it and
[1:57:20] they say this is what it means and they
[1:57:23] stop right there that's man's
[1:57:26] tradition because God is his only
[1:57:30] interpreter he will take a scripture
[1:57:32] give you one meaning today and you come
[1:57:35] tomorrow he gives you another why it's
[1:57:37] the Living Word of God and he's the only
[1:57:40] one who can interpret it for you and he
[1:57:43] because he wants you to live by it he
[1:57:45] doesn't want you to have everything
[1:57:48] already said in your mind this means
[1:57:50] this this is that no
[1:57:52] he wants to be your daily interpreter
[1:57:55] when you woke up in the morning he gives
[1:57:57] you an interpretation of what he wants
[1:57:59] for your life that day he guides you he
[1:58:02] leads you and I want to say this men's
[1:58:05] tradition will only produce
[1:58:07] death at the very end of it it will
[1:58:10] produce death but God's word will
[1:58:12] produce life why because he's going to
[1:58:16] unfold by taking the word of God we are
[1:58:19] allowing him to unfold it and bring
[1:58:22] exactly what he meant for for our lives
[1:58:26] but will say the end time message will
[1:58:28] produce the end time
[1:58:33] results and and I love what what our
[1:58:35] brother said they there's not a question
[1:58:37] we have that God has not given us an
[1:58:40] answer and often time the mistake that
[1:58:43] people make is they will go try to find
[1:58:46] their specific problem by the specific
[1:58:49] wording of
[1:58:50] It Go God can speak you with the cover
[1:58:54] to you on the C just by reading the Holy
[1:58:57] Bible and whatever question you had is
[1:59:01] answered he he speaks he you will be
[1:59:04] reading one scripture and all of the
[1:59:06] sudden it pops up and then an answer
[1:59:08] come from whatever you had need
[1:59:11] of and I want to say this tonight the
[1:59:15] answer to remove us from tradition is
[1:59:18] the
[1:59:20] Revelation all we need is Revelation
[1:59:22] from him father I I don't know what this
[1:59:25] means and I don't understand this let
[1:59:27] him be the revealer of his own word to
[1:59:30] you if if we walk by Revelation we're
[1:59:33] walking by truth we shall live if we
[1:59:36] walk by our own definition by our own
[1:59:39] understanding we shall die the way that
[1:59:41] seeth right unto man the end of that
[1:59:45] road is
[1:59:47] death but the word of God the revealed
[1:59:50] word of God understand that these men
[1:59:52] that took the same Bible they form all
[1:59:55] of these denominations we see around the
[1:59:58] corner so it's the revealed word of God
[2:00:01] by the prophet Messenger as our brother
[2:00:04] said he comes and he brings the very
[2:00:07] revelation of what that word is if you
[2:00:09] live by that you shall never
[2:00:13] die oh God help us tonight let's not
[2:00:18] have our own interpretation our own
[2:00:20] meaning our own definition where people
[2:00:22] come and you know they have their own
[2:00:24] every time you say a word they have a
[2:00:25] definition of all that means no let God
[2:00:28] be his own interpreter let God interpret
[2:00:31] your life
[2:00:34] yes Lord I don't know what I'm here for
[2:00:37] I don't know what you call me for he can
[2:00:39] take it and give you a meaning for for
[2:00:43] your life and tell you exactly what you
[2:00:45] were born for what you are here to do
[2:00:47] what your mission is what the statement
[2:00:49] is for
[2:00:50] you but we got to separate ourselves
[2:00:53] from our tradition for our own
[2:00:55] understanding the word of God is a
[2:00:57] separator when you hear it it causes
[2:01:00] conflict between what he said and what
[2:01:03] you knew and the child of God looks at
[2:01:06] everything he knew and says this all
[2:01:08] goes into a trash and I'm following the
[2:01:11] leading of the spirit I'm following the
[2:01:13] revealed word of the hour so it can give
[2:01:15] me my true identity is that your heart
[2:01:18] desire or not I say father come speak to
[2:01:20] us make your word a reality to us that's
[2:01:24] what we desire Above All Things amen

[2:01:36] valley let your sweet
