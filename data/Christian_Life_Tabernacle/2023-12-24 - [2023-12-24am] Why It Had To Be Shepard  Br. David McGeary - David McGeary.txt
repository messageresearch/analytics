the L I'm the thr I GL in [Music] my amen are you glad you bent your knee Amen to worship him alone let's go ahead and vow this morning commit the service to him Lord Jesus we're always so appreciative so grateful so dependent upon your presence Lord when we gather together Lord It's not to accomplish some religious ceremony Lord as so many do on Christmas Eve to come together and fulfill a religious obligation Lord that's not what we're interested in that's not what you've called us to Lord we come here with a promise that if we Gather in your name you'll meet us here Lord we look forward to what you have for us today Father we commit the service to you that all would be done according to your will Lord that that which you have determined to accomplish today would be done Lord that every need that's presented to you Lord you know the answer I pray that you would come alongside us and meet that Lord would you bless the man of God as he comes and speaks the word that your word would be made known Lord may you bless the service all that is done to worship and magnify you that you would be glorified and we pray this in Jesus name amen you can be seated Merry Christmas it's Christmas Eve today you know one of the portions of scripture that we he quoted and repeated and sung you know pretty much from every corner in the land is you know Luke 2 where it tells that story of one who came and how how a angel and heavenly host appeared to Shepherds one night on the hillside you know as they began to if they announced his coming and they began to praise the Lord they made a statement in Luke 2:14 that said glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men you know it's something that is proclaimed throughout the Christmas season there's decorations peace on Earth people sing about peace on Earth but what's interesting is this one when he came whom the world attributes to peace on Earth and he started to go about the father's business he made statements like this in Luke 12:51 suppose ye that I am come to give peace on Earth I tell you nay but rather division he said it this way in Matthew 10:34 think not that I am come to send peace on Earth I came not to send peace but a sword somehow that part doesn't find its way into the Christmas songs or the Christmas decorations Jes he said in Matthew 11 from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force what happened to peace on Earth you know when Christmas comes along and everyone talks about peace on Earth you know so many times they're thinking about a carnal Earthly version of Peace you know the Jews thought that when Messiah came he would push out the enemy and allow Israel to live at peace with the Nations you know and even today people speak of Peace On Earth as an end of war and famine and how people live in some idilic State here on Earth in harmony with one another but that's not the kind of peace on Earth that he came to bring in fact in Luke 4 when Jesus was being tempted by the enemy the enemy rightly identified that all the kingdoms of the Earth had been given to him and were his domain establishing peace between the devil's kingdoms was not his program instead of bringing peace on Earth he created conflict you know he brought forth a word which clashed with all of the social and political and religious and cultural natur Al Norms of the day you know ultimately all but a few rejected him and ultimately they sought to kill him peace on Earth I came not to send peace but a sword you know what's funny is Jesus never sought to do battle with anyone he never went out to fight or argue or cause dissension or any of that all he ever did was make known the word he said in John 5:19 verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do all he ever did was present the word to say and do exactly what the father showed him to do and the only result was that all things were put in in their position according to the word it was thus saith the Lord or keep still he did just what the father showed him you know that thought was on my mind is I began reading Psalm 144 this weekend you want to turn to that we'll be reading that today and it begins with an interesting statement the first couple verses says blessed be the Lord my strength which teacheth My Hands to War amen and my fingers to fight my goodness and my Fortress my high tower and my deliverer my shield and he in whom I trust who subdueth my people under me it's an interesting statement he teaches me to fight he teaches me how to to fight out of War you know if we're not careful though we can get caught up in this idea that we're to be running around defeating Devils but you just never saw Jesus do anything like that you know doing battle with the Enemy or measuring ourselves by how many Devils we defeat but just as you know I think just as the Lord's version of peace on Earth is different than ours I think the Lord's version of doing battle is different than ours as well you know James 4 said from whence cometh Wars and fightings among you come they not hint even of your own lusts that war in your members you see it's the opposite of I do nothing but what he showeth me Paul described that struggle this way in Romans 7:18 for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not you know notice here in Psalm 144 it doesn't speak of going out and fighting battles or winning wars it just speaks of teaching us how it says he is both my my refuge and my defense it says that I trust in him the margin of my Bible says I take refuge in him but we could read it this way as Jesus said in John 15 if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will which if his words abide in you then your will and his will will be the same that's right you will know what he wants done with his word and it shall be done unto you thank you Lord not because you're a devil defeater but because you abide with a teacher and a teacher abides in you as he said John 15:5 for without me you can do nothing so what does he want Don he said in John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things including how to war and how to fight and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you now notice what he says peace I leave with you peace on Earth my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth yeah give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid he goes on to say in John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you teach you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear yes that shall he speak Hallelujah and he will show you things to come you know so as I was reading that verse in Psalm 144 which teacheth My Hands to War and my fingers to fight you know indeed he teaches us how fighting is done by abiding with the peace I leave with you by allowing him to teach us all things what he wants done with the word every day doing nothing until he shows us first am for without him we can do nothing peace on Earth good will his will toward men let's go ahead and stand this morning you know that final verse of Psalm 144 says this happy is that people that is in such a case yay happy is that people whose God is the Lord are you grateful for him this morning are you grateful for peace on Earth are you you're grateful that you don't have to know how to fight right you don't have to go out and do the fighting yeah we just have to abide and let him lead us and guide us as he would have us do and say let's go ahead and read Psalm 144 together blessed be the Lord my strength which teacheth My Hands to War and my fingers to fight my goodness and my Fortress my high tower and my deliverer my shield and he in whom I trust who subdueth my people under me Lord what is man that thou takest knowledge of him or the son of man that thou makest account of him man is like to vanity his days are as a shadow that passeth away bow thy Heavens oh Lord and come down touch the mountains and they shall smoke cast forth lightning and scatter them shoot out thine arrows and Destroy them send thine hand from above rid me and deliver me out of great water Waters from the hand of strange children whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood I will sing a new song unto thee Oh God upon a salt tree and an instrument of Ted and strings will I Sing Praises unto thee it is he that giveth salvation unto Kings Who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword rid me and Deliver Me from the hand of strange children whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth that our daughters may be as cornerstones polished after the similitude of a palace that our Garners may be full according all manner of store that our sheep may bring forth thousands and 10,000s in our streets that our oxen may be strong to labor that there be no breaking in nor going out that there be no complaining in our streets happy is that people that is in

just to run our little church and to keep it all going and working so we have a little something uh for each of uh you today but we have a special announcement this morning we'd like to uh uh make and uh we'd like to announce on behalf of uh the family uh I never say their name right the mubanga family I hope I didn't hurt that too bad uh everything in Irish starts with a Mech or an O so it's a lot easier you know it's either Mick or o or something like that but anyway I we'd like to announce the uh engagement of brother Manasses and sister Zer this morning so where are you that brother man all right sisters Z here God bless you amen hallelujah I was hoping you'd be in full uniform this morning all those little buttons on you you know and and all those things congratulations what a lovely wife God's given you I've met her what a beautiful spirit what a a wonderful pretty girl God's giving you the best of life you know I I was proud that uh they join the service thank you for your service for our country amen and uh in Israel uh joined the service and a lot of people were grateful I think it's a wonderful decision and um so we're just thrilled for that this morning it's good to see my old buddy this morning God bless you how are you doing you good you're not going to stay up in them Hills forever are you I got to be honest you know um I I can't uh I can't for forget when I first uh uh Min um my brother he was standing in sitting in the back in our church and he was just shouting and carrying on and banging on the wall you know what I mean and uh I I said uh who is that crazy man come back there you know what I mean and I thought he'd just making a r Ruckus you know I won't embarrass him too bad but I I really come to love him and he's been a real friend of mine so it's nice to have him back with us this morning we're going to um listen to 30 minutes I wanted to play more but uh of why it had to be Shepherds and because we are here this morning because God sent a messenger we're not here because uh I have such a wonderful personality and I'm such a great preacher that I just gathered people together or we were with organizers we're here and we're together because of one thing is that we heard a voice we heard we heard a message go out in this day that God raised up and Vindicated a prophet and that Prophet came on the scene and he began to preach things that men had never heard before and once again to the Gentile church it was spoken in the days of Israel there was a man that came on the scene and they said never has a man spoke like this man and the Gentiles in this day were able to say the same thing never has there been a man that spoke like this man never was a man that could see what was hid and bring the hidden things of Darkness to the surface oh you scribes and you Pharisees he would say you know you doers of iniquity uh you do you know worship the slicers of your fathers wash them out nobody spoke like he spoke and nobody spoken this day because it was the pure unadulterated word of God and we've gathered because of that that is the reason that we purpose in our heart to go forward that's the reason that we try to make more space so more people can come in here not not that we can have a greater fellowship or that we can have a greater social structure or that we can have programs and things like that we've assembled this morning for one purpose and one purpose only is to hear the voice and to let that voice lead us and guide us in all truth and righteousness for it is the guide in this hour you might not say what lies ahead for tomorrow but we know who knows what lies ahead and we know that he knows what we have need of and so this morning uh I wanted to play and I wanted to listen to our messenger together because I never want us to lose the fact that that's our preeminence you know a lot of people feel that the spirit's moving on and God's moved on and now God's leading Us by the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit leads us by the word of God and and and uh that's what we go for I just noticed the Sanders here I think I bless you guys amen so nice to have everybody with us morning our visitors from love it God bless everybody and so that's the only way that we we have an answer is by the word a lot of people say well by the Bible you can give a thousand men this Bible right and you'll end up with a thousand different ideas you can give a thousand men a math book and they'll all be in the same mind because this isn't built on the letter it's built on divine revelation those whom God has chosen to reveal amen and this great messenger this great promise of Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 and Revelation 10:7 lied right in this book John 14 and Hebrews all lied right in this book but it was hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes such would learn and by God's grace and mercy he opened your eyes and he gave you I have that you might see and if your vision begins to get dim you know look up your Redemption dos now so for our scripture reading this morning uh we're going to let the messenger of the hour uh read our our scripture reading to us this morning and uh so as he begins to read the scripture this morning you can stand I'll tell you where he's going to read from so you can uh prepare in your scriptures he's going to read from the second chapter of the Book of Luke and and we will stand as he begins to play that for us we're just going to play 30 minutes I wanted to play 40 but I didn't want your message uh the message to get too long this morning we don't have service this evening so uh feel free so let's stand together as we prepare to listen to our messenger it's just raining outside you don't want to go out in the rain so we're just going to stay in here and uh a fellowship this morning around the word of God I sure enjoyed all the specialist this morning and all the singing and and and the love of the Lord so we love you this morning with all our hearts we love this message this morning and within it is everything that we have need of God bless you this morning as we listen to the message of the hour brought To Us by God's Prophet William brandham if you will turn with me for a reading in the Holy RIT St Luke the 2 chapter can you hear me all right is there any transposition in the microphones can you hear in the back all right if you can raise your hand thank you the second chapter of The Gospel According to St Luke and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar austa that all the world should be taxed and this tax was first made known was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed every one to his own country and Joseph also went up From Galilee into the city of Nazareth into Judea the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his spouse wife being great with child and so it was that while she was there the days of her accomplishment that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in the manger because there was no room for them in the end and there was in the same country Shepherd abiding in the fields keeping watch over their flocks By Night Lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone around about them and they were sore afraid and the angels said unto them fear not for behold I bring Good Tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a manger and S L there was yeah and suddenly there with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace good well toward man and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us go now even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord has made known unto us and they came in haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in the manger and when they had seen it they made on abroad the saying which was told them concerning the child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pounded them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen as it was told unto them may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word now it's uh why this great event was revealed to Shepherds that would be kind of an astounding thing for us I have some scriptures written here and a few notes that I will try to run over to explain to you why to the best of my knowledge and maybe then after this that the Lord with his grace tonight will take the wise away from us but did most all of us I suppose at one time or other has wondered why that this greatest event of all times was revealed to Shepherds why was it revealed to Shepherds and not to the theologians of that day they were the one were trained to hear it and why did it come and bypass the rich and come to the poor also why did it bypass the learned and wise and come to the humble and unlearned there is a few questions of why in this and another reason I might say notice the babe was born in Bethlehem which Bethlehem in the Hebrew interpretation as we had a couple years ago here Bethlehem means the house of God's bread and we proved in the scriptures he could not come any other place Bethlehem was founded by Rahab and her uh her husband Rahab was a harlot that a general courted from the the uh Israelite Army after they had taken uh Jericho and by faith she believed the message of God in her condition and she was saved and from there when Joshua divided up the lands of of where each one would be and there's a great lesson that sometime I hope to be able to bring at Tucson of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies when she groaned at the birth pain of the baby she called the name of the baby and that positionally placed it in the promised land its tribe a great thing all the word of God fits right together if it doesn't fit together it's not God's word is Misfit it's your thought is misfitting to the word it all fits together so then he was the bread of life as we taught last week in phix or week before last and being the bread of life he could come no place else but the house of God's bread and that was the why now here Jesus is born in Bethlehem and in Bethlehem there was synagogue great religious leaders lived in Bethlehem David the great king shepherd was born in Bethlehem his father chess was born in Bethlehem his grandfather oit was born in Bethlehem also all the way back he came from Bethlehem and here Jesus the son of David is born in Bethlehem right under the shadows of the great Cathedrals then if those people are trained and have been looking for the Messiah for all these years 4,000 years the Messiah had been prophesied to come and then if the Messiah be born in the shadow of the cathedral why did they have to go PL back up into the mountains to a bunch of unlearned untrained Shepherds Amen to bring the great message the first message and commission Shepherds not the wise and trained but Shepherds it's a strange thing isn't it well there's got to be a why somewhere there is a why now there's got to be an answer why and no man knows the answer save God he's the one that knows the answer now remember the Messiah was already in the city born in the city in a stable right by the great Cathedrals where the high priest and the great priest and the theologians and the wise and the trained all was there waiting for the Messiah and there he was right in their midst but why then did did they go to the out on the hills of Judea to unlearned untrained uncultured poorest of all look like the most unfit person for such a task to reveal the message and send them out to bring the message you know my opinion it might not amount to very much but I want to pass my opinion I believe it's because of the wisdom of God that he knew they wouldn't receive such a message the way it come it wasn't in the taste of their learning it was different it wasn't what they had been trained to believe he would be like it was contrary to their theological understanding all their training all their learning was bypassed become not I believe it was the wisdom of God that knew that they wouldn't receive such a message so the Messiah was here and there must be somebody recogniz it and he knew those who hadn't been mixed up and such stuff as that he would be more able to get his message to an unlearned group than he would be to a mixed up group that was so set in their ways that nothing could turn them not even the word of God and now Christian friends let me ask this question With all sincerity and love I just wonder if he would make the same act tonight and send to us in this generation the promised word that's promised for this generation I wonder if our theologians and Educators and wise wouldn't turn the message down just the same as they did that man doesn't change neither does God's word change he's the unchanging God he doesn't change notice Angels coming and Angels coming and giving their message to man of such low a state when there were men they're much more Earthly thought of qualified than these poor illiterate Shepherds the shepherd was the most illiterate of anybody he didn't need to know nothing but just about his sheep he didn't need to know mathematics he didn't need to know how to to split an atom he didn't need no scholarship he just had to know his sheep that's all that he needed to know and God the great wisdom and the fountain and resource of our wisdom would choose such a person as that persons rather as that and bypass all the wellt Tred Scholars that's trained to know that it speaks one thing that they were trained in the wrong field passing up all the important of the land that were important people great teachers to Ephesus the high priest many other great men all Israel's Mighty learned all the denominations and all the boasting theologians God bypassed every one of them uh that's God's wisdom notice the highest Heavens Hasting to honor Earth's most humble and unlearned the highest of Heavens came down to make himself known to the lowest of the earth bypassing all between to make yourself known the common herdsmen coming to give these common herdsmen the greatest message Of All Times there had been many great Messengers we' think of the Noah's day and the prophets and and the great priest and so forth it been in the Days Gone By the Great learned man Kings potent monarchs but here he comes with the greatest of all the messages what was the message Messiah is here now and to make that known he bypassed all the train to make it known to Humble Shepherds think of it all of the clergymen all of the churchmen all of the teachers all of the the theological training all the money had been spent all the churches and the doctrines and the denominations is all byass all the learning that they had spent on all the all the missionaries and all the priting all the membership and everything that they had thought they had done honor to God yet the key message of all of it was bypassed from him strange why and notice not only that but the most unlikely place for such an event the the Shepherds now was the one who received the message and now notice where the message was in the most unlikely place that anyone would expect it to come and I wonder tonight if we were looking for the true message of the Lord Jesus I wonder if it would be in an unlikely group a place that was that the great uh High cultured world in the church today would think was a bunch of of oh Heretics I wonder if that wouldn't be where we'd find him the most unlikely place and to the most unqualified speakers Shepherds know nothing about speaking only calling sheep but maybe that's why it comes but it was a promised word notice it could do that again it bypassed all the Nobles of the land it bypassed all the Nobles and was revealed to the no bodies all the Nobles that were decorated with with great doctors Divinity and and psychology and and highly uh education and great Cathedrals and things it was all bypassed and revealed to no bodies the wisdom the infinite wisdom of almighty God did it to make know one to them the greatest message ever was the Messiah is now on Earth what a wisdom can only come from God who knows wisdom all the wisdom and all all the schooling and everything was now laid to waste and bypassed by the great wisdom of God I keep repeating that because I want it to go down deep all laid the waste it was of no good bypassed it all to let God's wisdom have the right away that God takes the nothing to make the something we could stop here and speak of John we could stop and speak of Elijah nobody knows where Elijah come from all you know he just appeared on the scene the prophets back through the ages they were nobody but God took that and bypass the the ethics of the church and the teachings to make sure that he is God he takes something that's nothing to do something with it he shows his wisdom and his godhead by doing so that he takes the nothings when he first made a man he just took a ball of clay and made a man out of it where was nothing but clay but he made a man God takes the nothing's now to do the something's with and as long as we think we're somethings and we cannot be used in the hand of God we must forsake all we ever knew or learned pardon me like the great St Paul he said he had forget all he ever learned that he might know Christ all their schooling all their teachings and so forth was working out to the worst for them it finally denied him the very schooling that they had had far him to believe him turned around and become his most critical enemy and crucified him do you know that history repeats itself ever so often it's a noted fact it could happen again right by the side of us or you said if I live then well now if you want to know what you'd have done then look at your present State now and you can see what you'd have done then because it certainly is revealing train to believe his word and then when his word was Vindicated before their very eyes they denied the word that was made Vindication when God proved what he would do and said what he would do and prove what he would do then they turned around and called this man an evil spirit which cursed them all think of what taken place think of what caused them their training caused them not to recognize the very word made flesh for their day the very training that they had in their schools with the very best of teachers and you say well we wouldn't do that today their teachers were far Supreme to ours today Superior to our teachers and they failed they didn't have 996 different organizations as we have today they had about three and in the Three Bottle down to three and none of the three recognized it this goes to show that What man does is foolishness to God now they failed to recognize it now and they do the same thing again man intention is good and always is good and man never changes his posture he never changes his ways much I'm talking to the man of the world man is always praising God religious man for what he done and always pointing people to what he's going to do and then ignoring what he's doing see that's just man he's made that way he's always been that way and you Bible readers tonight know that that's according to the word right they're always praising God for what he has done saying what he will do and ignoring what he's doing that's just the habit of man the reason that they had did this the teachers to my opinion now they had interpreted the word c a all believed in a coming Messiah all Israel believed it they do yet today but the reason that they didn't recognize him his message wasn't according to their ecclesiastical fit they uh there the interpretation that they had of the word the Messiah never manifested himself in the way that they had interpreted that he would do it so and therefore they did not recognize him because it didn't fit their interpretation as I've said before and say again God doesn't need anybody to interpret his word he is his own interpreter now the Bible says let me prove to you now that that is the truth Isaiah the prophet 715 years before this happened Isaiah the prophet said a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a child there's no doubt that everyone in that age thought their daughter would be that woman because Isaiah said it but you see it was 700 years later but when God didn't need anybody to interpret his word when he'll do it or how he would do it he said he would do it and he did it God promised that he over in Isaiah also of believe the 28th chapter about the 18th verse and also in Joel 228 that in the last days the last 2,000 years he had pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh he said your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young man shall see Visions your old man shall dream dreams and the things that he would do Isaiah said with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest but they wouldn't hear it they Wagg their heads and walked by it he said all the tables of God would become full of vomit and there would be nothing clean and if that isn't a picture of Jerusalem and the Church of that day at the coming Messiah it's a picture today the same it's just repeating itself now when God says he'll do a thing he did it regardless of what anybody else thinks about it what anybody says when God speaks to something he's Duty bound to interpret that word himself and his in the Vindication of the word is his own interpretation notice vindicating his messiah's message he promised what the Messiah would do when he come and when he came even when the wise man in the East had looked down south Westward from where they were at in Babylon and they saw a majestic star did you know there's not a speck of History nowhere that any Observatory where they even kept the the uh the time by stars great man who studied these Stars there's not no history says that any of them seen that star at all why it wasn't given to them they wasn't looking for such but these wise men know that there would be a star of Jacob right and they were looking for it and it passed from the time that Jesus was born in Bethlehem now I know our Christian Traditions it's just like our churches it has things Topsy turby you go out here and you see wise men coming to worship a baby there's not such a thing in the scripture two years later they got there coming down through the Plains and across the Tigers River they never come to worship an infant but a young child about 2 years old why was it at the same time Herod slew all the children from two years old under that that he might catch the Messiah you see they God had Vindicated by his word and when these wise men came to Jerusalem the star LED them to the religious capital of the world Jerusalem and as soon as they entered those Gates that star the supernatural that had led them refused to show them anymore up and down the streets These Fine Man rich man with find great camels and so forth up and down the streets and worried this born King of the Jews we saw his star in the east and that great religious Capal after two years of the shepherd's message still didn't have the answer and know nothing about it the head of all the denominations amen didn't have the answer so it Disturbed the Sanhedrin and they called for the scribes to come read and they read Micah story The Prophet which said that th Bethlehem art thou not the least of all the princes of Judah the least but out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel and after the scriptures being read and still being Vindicated Before Their Eyes they still didn't accept it though the scripture said so I doubt very much they would today if the scriptures that's promised for this day would be made manifest I may never preach to you again but I want you to get this still they wouldn't believe the great wisdom of the father makes man's Wisdom so foolish that he belittles the man he actually comes to the place the work makes man feel so ashamed of himself and he's not big enough to admit that he's wrong he's still stays with this story no matter how much the father proves that his word is true and he's doing just what he promised to do man thinks his wisdom is so Superior to God if it don't come according to his wisdom why It Isn't So Am that's true in every age still does it see how fitting the whole matter was now what inspiration to those herdsmen the Angels come coming down to speak to herdsmen angels of God coming to speak to a bunch of shepherds I wonder if you ever had the privilege of of talking with a Shepherd or being with one a while if you would I I don't like to say it because of my uh remark I'm fixing to say after a while but the shepherd stays with the Sheep so much until he even laughs like the Sheep blatant he talks like the sheep and he smells like the Sheep that's right because he's with the Sheep that's all he knows is his sheep now the Vindicated word of Truth when these Shepherds humble uneducated man what an honor how fitting it is to a Shepherd to receive a message of a newborn sheep it could come to nothing else but a Shepherd that's why he was born in a stable and not in a house sheep were not born in a house or in a pink decorated hospital room see they are born in the barn in the fields that's the reason he was led to Calvary you can't not make a sheep walk the G way to the slaughter did you know that in the slaughter yards they have a goat that leads the sheep and when he gets up to where the killing place is he jumps out and lets the Sheep go on a sheep has to be led he can't lead himself so therefore it had to be the shepherd coming for the his sheep when they found the god baby exactly where the messenger said he would be and when they found this mess message of the messenger in the manger exactly where the angel said it would be now you'll just have to go home and listen to the tape you're s amen this is this message is tremendous and the farther you get into it the greater it is but I'd just like to take a little Christmas thought from that if uh you wouldn't mind and and uh uh hope that uh you heard enough that you understand that what I'm saying has a source and uh I've always tried to do that for you to let you know that uh the thinking is I don't want it to be my thinking I want it to be motivated from the word of God and and so my you know this is this is Christmas and we know that uh because of uh Christmas and uh there's a lot of giftgiving going on and uh a lot of uh uh trying to find the right gift and and of course you know now is a technical age and time and uh you can get gifts you can't even figure out you know know what button to press and and all this and everything has become uh more and more Superior more and more technical uh it was just David's uh birthday here uh uh and uh he had his birthday and in uh one of his brothers gave him a pepper grinder and I mean this ain't no just pepper grinder man this thing is a pepper grinder and I didn't even know a pepper grinder could get you know so technical you know what I mean and they figured out just how to let the grind the pepper just so perfect and everything in fact I was sitting 50 feet away from them and that pepper was ground so perfect I began to sneeze so there's a lot of emphasis at this time of year on gifts and and understanding gifts and I think that uh we received a gift we all know that the greatest gift that was ever given to this world was the Lord Jesus but I don't think a lot of times that we understand the gift and we don't even understand the message amen and and I thought the prophet of God that brought that out so beautiful he said the message that the angels brought the shepherd was that the Messiah is on earth now amen he's here now he said it's so in the same day today the message hasn't changed the Messiah is here now he's here now he's not a far off he's not gone someplace he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's here now but I don't think we understand understand all that the Lord brought us and I can't preach the whole gospel in just a few minutes but I just want to bring this to us this morning I don't really sometimes really think that we understand what this great gift is to us and I thought as the prophet of God begin to unfold uh uh this to us and I I'd like to say this about the gift this morning so many times our gifts are all we always relate it carnally you know uh I get the question asked to me what do you want for Christmas well I don't even want Christmas so uh you know what are you going to do about a gift you know I don't want no more stuff you know I I finally had to I guess the only thing I need is a pair of of slacks that the uh belt goes in and out you know what I mean and uh and so you you you you recognize that none of those there you don't need stuff you you uh you know someone says what do you want for Christmas and I begin to realize that there's nothing that man can give that could really satisfy what it is that I want excuse me and so everything's always geared to carnality and if if it's just it's just he said that's the way that man is it's it it's carnal we even think of God too much in the carnal realm we measure God by by carnality it's always about what God can do for me what God what's my situation what's my circumstance oh you know we go so long in a certain direction until we get in a mess and then we need God you know we got to call on God and and and we always want God the result that God gives us we want a carnal result we want him to do something for our body we want him to do something for our circumstance we want him to do something for our finance we want to do something for the ease of life we're always asking for something carnal and I'd like to say this morning that's the problem with us is we're way too carnal we're just carnal everything gets measured by the Flesh and and so even when we look at Christmas and we look at the gift of God we we try to begin to measure in in carnality what did he do he saved me what did he do he gave me heaven you know if if we we start to relate everything back to a physical carnal State and do you know the carnal mind if says in Romans 8 7-9 the carnal mind is enity with God it's against God it it separates us from God and all the time we begin to measure the blessings of God we begin to say oh God bless me and if I would say to you uh what's your blessing uh we would get a carnal response God blessed me with a good job God blessed me with the truck God blessed me with health God blessed me with this God blessed me with that and every measure of God is carnal that's how we've become and I thought as our prophet of God brought this out and we'll just walk through it a little bit this morning with you the gift of God was not carnal the gift of God was spiritual it's the spiritual mind that's life and peace we look at these great gift of God this morning and I want to just say this that it might rest in our hearts this morning that the gift of God was not carnal it was spiritual and really what was it that God gave us if I would to ask you could you want to give something to somebody that they need you want to give something to somebody that helps you identify like if you're a fisherman or or or something you want to give them something because you know they're a fisherman you know what I mean I I I tried to take up the sport of uh golf for a little while haven't golfed in a long time but all I got was golf balls golf shirts golf teas uh divots fixures I never hit a green to make a divot anyway so uh that's all you know because everybody identified me as a golfer and I thought I don't want to be identified as a golfer so we really begin to think even our carnal our identification of one another as carnal that's right that's right that's right we we we we we measure uh people people in the carnal realm we couldn't tell if somebody was spiritual or not and I'm not cheing us out this morning amen but I want to bring us to a reality that we can get from a carnal place to a spiritual place that's the trouble with the church they're not spiritual enough their whole process is carnal their whole measurement of life is carnal their whole measurement of one another is carnal and and we want to rise above that we want to rise above measuring our church by the sizes of our building you know the prophet of God he just preached about that over and over and over again like it's some sort of monument and then we look right here at the scripture and God's wisdom made his Monument nothing that was carnal that's rightall why did it have to be in Bethlehem because he was a shepherd He was the Lamb of God and the Lamb of God had to be born like a lamb why did it have to be Shepherds because it was the Lamb of God the wisdom of God cuz Lambs come to the Shepherds everything about it wasn't carnal at all it was spiritual the spiritual was AB it was absolutely a spiritual word happening and even today we think oh he's born in no rooming me in it was carinal the poor little Mary and Joseph uh rejected but you you understand it it that's the carnal story that's a carinal Viewpoint him coming down the land the taxes and everything oh that's the carnal view but when you get back if we could put on spiritual glasses it was a spiritual event it had to be that way because God's wisdom God's magnificence Hallelujah in fulfilling the word of God and hiding it from the wise and prudent and revealing it unto babes such as would learn it's it's it behooves us to really understand what it means the washing of the water of the word of God it means to wash the carnality out of it am and and begin to to place in us as it says in Philippians 2 and 5-1 let this mind be in you that was in Christ and so I want to say really what this great gift was what really was was the gift that God was giving us and so that we don't miss it or if I could say this part of really what it was that God was bringing to us have we ever got a gift you say what is this what does this do and I think you just look at the uh uh Christmas you just look at things we always look at it just the way the prophet of God said it what did God give you he gave me eternal life one day I'll leave and then we look at it and said oh you know uh he Vindicated it and he did all these things and we're always looking back and we're always looking to the Future and sometimes we don't even understand what what he's doing now even in the even in the the message of the hour we look back upon brother brandom's message and we look to the Future uh of the the message but a lot of people and I just say this from my heart I hope I don't seem terrible but a lot of people don't even understand the message is still doing something for us now and are we even catching what it's doing for us now you can read the Bible like a history book and you can read the Bible like a book of Prophecy but oh if you're spiritual right the carinal mind can read the Bible that's right as a book of uh prophecy that's right the carinal mind can read the book as a book of history but it takes somebody to be in the spirit to have a spiritual mind to read the scriptures and let the scriptures speak to you in the now that's right to be living that's right so we look at what he's as our messenger so beautifully brought out and he said in this 18th uh paragraph he said and there was a great lesson that sometimes I hope to be able to bring at Tucson of those Hebrew mothers giving birth over those babies when she would grown at Birth pain of the baby and she would call out the name of the baby and that positionally placed it in the promised land its tribe it's a great the great thing all the word of God fits right together that's right now listen what he said as I try to just express to you what it is on my heart and and if I can say this and I I I I hope I don't seem out of place but it's what I desire for you this morning and I desire for myself he said if it doesn't fit together it's not God's word that's Misfit it's your thoughts is misfitting to the word of God it all fits together it was the thoughts that misplaced the word of God it was the thoughts that were misfitted and he goes on to explain over and over again it was their thinking that was misfitted did you see how he went through it bringing it out he said he said he he says in this place he said he said in this paragraph 31 he goes on to speak he said we can stop here and speak of John we could stop and speak of Elijah nobody knowed where Elija come from all they knew is he just appeared on the scene the prophets back through the ages they were nobody's but God took and bypassed the Hallelujah ethics of the church and the teachings to show that he's God he takes something that's nothing to do something with it he shows his wisdom and his godhead by doing so you understand this forces you right into the measuring of things by [Applause] spirituality not by personality not by education not by uh the the uh Speech and elegance as Paul said I didn't come to you with Elegance of speech but I came to you humble and meek in fear and in trembling so it would take it would have to take a spiritual mind to be able to look at Paul and see the spirit moving and not judge him by the carnal because of the way that he was and yet he had to to defend himself in one place because theyve become so carnal that's right me but measuring I'm of this person and I'm of that person he says I didn't even baptize any of you and then when he came in question he says look at yourselves aren't you the proof of my Ministry so the the it's the carnal mind that separates people it's the carinal mind that measures what's spiritual and what's not it's the carinal mind what measures what good preaching is and what good preaching isn't one of the greatest messages that ever was preached was preached by a mule so we're such victims of of our carnal mind just follow me if you would for the wisdom of this godhead that he takes nothing when he first made a man he just took a ball of clay and made a man out of it that's all we are we've only got big eyes and little use in the colal realm right we've only got rich and poor in the carnal realm we only measure blessings in the carnal realm and you know it's such a blessing we would feel somebody's blessing if they're outgoing and and and they've got Carisma and they've got a personality we'd say oh that person's blessed I'd like to be with them but yet really in the spiritual mind a Meek and humble Spirit Hall somebody that's willing to take the back seat somebody that's willing just to not get any uh recognition or anything Hallelujah right and and we couldn't even recognize but yet that's the crown of life it takes spirituality to see those things it takes spirituality do you understand there there's not a preacher in this message that has anything to say and if they say anything other than what the prophet said they're [Applause] lying that's right amen the very fact that we would measure Ministries shows how carnal that we be come amen follow with me if you don't mind me please he says and God takes nothing to do something with it he says as long as we think or something then we cannot be used in the hands of God we must forsake all we've ever known or learned like the great Paul said that he had to forget every learned that he might know Christ all their schooling and all their teaching and so forth was worked out for the worst for them he finally it finally denied him the very schooling that they had had for him to believe him turned around and became his most critical enemy and crucified him think of it now the very carnal mind that they were thinking of to learn more of them ended up turning against them you understand what he's saying your chiral mind will turn against you your caral discernment will turn against you your carnal judgments will turn against you and eventually it led them to crucify the word of God and the god of Glory because why they learned you know Satan teaches us to think yeah education science civilization is all carnal it was never meant for us to do anything by we're not led by education we're not LED by civilization or culture that's right we're not led by science we're led by the spirit of God so he said that it was what they learned and what they were taught what they thought they were learning and what they thought they were being taught was the very thing that came back and destroyed them and because their learning was wrong it actually caused them to crucify the very thing they were looking for what a tragic thing it was as Mike spoke a little bit this morning and he drops down and he says says this he says train to believe his word paragraph 34 he says train to believe his word and then when his word was Vindicated before their very eyes they denied the word that was made Vindicated when God proved what he would do and said what he would do and prove that he would do then they turned around and called The Man a evil spirit which cursed them all how many knows it did the whole city was destroyed right he said think of what taken place think of what caused them their training caused them not to recognize the very word made flesh for their day the very training that they had in their schools with the very best of teachers what do he what does he he keep expressing here they were taught to think a certain way they were taught how it would be amen they were taught how that it is and we find out all their teaching was carnal all their teaching was carnal what what they were what they were saying it was based on carnality he says and he says this is what they do I like what he says here the great wisdom of the father makes man's Wisdom so foolish paragraph 46 that he belittles the man he actually comes to the place to where it makes him feel so ashamed of himself and he's not big enough to admit that he's wrong he'll still stay with his story no matter how much the father proves that his word is true and he's going just what he promised to do man thinks his wisdom is so Superior to God if it don't come according to his wisdom why it isn't so that's true in every age still does it see how fitting the whole matter was now thank now listen what I I'm trying to say this morning I hope you know I love you man's Wisdom man thinks that his wisdom is so Superior to God that he'll stay with his story he'll stay with his story he'll stay with his thinking why it it it isn't so that that that he he's trained he's taught he's educated from birth he's raised to think this way he has in him amen something that is is uh inherent to him that he's been brought up and he's learned all of us are here today many different countries many different languages we all have so much we've learned so much that's been brought to us coming through life my father telling me the way things were and and how he would present politics to me and and and how is Viewpoint of things and I would sit there and I would listen and and and I would become my father I'd be like my dad in fact in my life I came to a place that I I didn't understand why I reacted the way I did why that what things bothered me and what things didn't bother me and I was trying to find my way I went and spent two years with my father so I could understand that I got so much from him and I came to the place I said I love my dad with all my heart and he's made me what I am and one day I got down on my knees and I said God I love my father but you're my father amen I need you to make me like you that's right I'm thankful for the light life he gave me I'm thankful for the wisdom I'm thankful for the construction knowledge and and all that he did for me amen but that's carnal right we're not going to a carnal all right and as I said Proverbs 23 and 7 23 and 7 says as a man thinketh in his heart so [Music] is so we're we're predestinated okay I don't want to use the word predestinated excuse me I want to we're destined is what I mean to say we're destined to be the result of the things that we've heard and the things that were taught so we have the mind that is in us and that's what the the prophet of God was saying that though they the reason they rejected him was because of the mind that was in them was against God not that they weren't sincere not that they weren't one to do right but the word of God tells us a way seeth right unto a man but the end of that way is death and man will stay with that story and he'll defend his actions he'll defend his thinking he he'll explain it a and lay it out there and hold to it true and yet stick to that carnal reality that he's living in stick to uh stick to the the the very uh discernments that he has and they're Kel and they're Kel because we're carnal and when we stay carnal we're going to get carnal results so really this morning if I could say this in closing most of our problems in life are because of the way that we measure the way that we discern the the the way that we calculate yes sir the way that we perceive and it's man it's man he says it's just man that's what he said we just heard him he says that's just the way man is man's mind mind and man's thinking and man's discernment is death man in their effort to try to make life better is making life worse they're Hy breing food they're Hy breing science they're Hy breing this they made an automobile that killed Millions come they made bombs that destroy right they make machines now that have robbed us of our privacy right you can't sin and repent and put it under the blood anymore without it becoming public knowledge and destroying somebody nobody will ever apply the blood they won't wash it out of their minds they won't wash it out of their thinking they'll hold it against the person that be becomes that person's reputation that becomes the way that that person is that becomes what they are oh brother such and such uh he fell he stumbled he did this he did that that's his reputation that's his history you think anybody's spiritual enough to look through the blood the blood says if you look through the blood that's thrown in the godd of but we're not spiritual enough to do it if you have a history of a brother you have a history of the sister and you're still remembering the way that they were you'll be judged by what God thinks of them not what you think of them so really what what what what was it that man needed Hallelujah really when man was sitting here in the condition that they are their very education their very science their very culture is leading them and destroying them you know what's destroying us is our mind and why would the scripture say let this mind that was in Christ be in you because really the gift that that was given at Christmas was not a carnal gift it was a spiritual gift God was giving us a way to think amen he was giving all mankind yes sir a different approach to life a different discernment of life life yes sir a different discernment of sickness a different discernment of trouble yes sir Peter said it this way thinking not strange that the fiery darts of the enemy that the trying of your faith it's more precious than gold that's a spiritual [Music] mind that's a mind that is now in the Realms of Glory saying nothing in this world can hinder me hallelu prophet of God tries to do it and get that message AC crust us he said the sunshiny skar Skies doesn't mean that God's for you near does the rain and the clouds mean that God's against you the gift of God was a spiritual mind it was a spiritual gift it was a it was a thing that that would change your course yes you look back on all your complexes so many of us still l let our past things that have happened to us in the past still weigh us down still affect the way that we deal with people it's affected me that's all right when I get deeply hurt and deeply offended and my heart gets broken I I I roll back into a shell and I protect that spot and then if I I try to I I I get weary to get close and I get weary to let go I I walk around in in the protection mode my defense mechanism is is quick to come up yeah punch first ask questions later right I lack trust and when I lack trust I begin to lack peace and all of a sudden I'm in the realm of carnality every day of my life oh I worship God God's glory I love you Lord I praise you with our lips we do worship him but our hearts the way a man thinketh in his heart so is he I can greet somebody on the street but what how it is when when when there's a a built-in fear like I want to meet this person but what if they don't like me huah or what what if I don't make a good first impression and and I'll guarantee I haven't been given the gift of a good first impression but I have found that a lot of people that got a good first impression it's the ones you want to keep your eye on and and I I I have things that are circumstantial I have things that are history and the word of God speaks out and says leave those things yeah which are behind behind sir and press into a higher calling that's what the Lord brought this is this gift Lord that God is giving the world it's a spiritual mind it's spirituality it's to measure life and circumstances and everything around you from the spiritual I'll give you the send you back the comforter and he'll lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness the way that it really is not your thinking but the spirit will be there that you can enter into the spirit you can get in the spiritual mind in the spiritual presence and come out with a spirit your Viewpoint Hall h that's far above the world and the things of the world and the way that the world thinks it'll Endo you with power [Music] Hallelujah to take control over every circumstance it'll make you a Mystic to the world and you walk in a realm of your own because you're not seen it that Shepherd became so one with the Sheep he smelled like the Sheep he laughed like the Sheep he talked with the Sheep but yet he was spiritual enough to know where to lead those sheep where to feed him you Lord where to guide him app it he had the spirit we thank you of a Shepherd Hallelujah we got carinal views of Christmas we got carnal views of History we got carnal views of everything and the carnality of man just reeks and man can't make it man's mind can't make it the Bible tells us a way Seth right unto a man he's begging us he's telling us you've got to let this mind that was in Christ be in you you've got to let this spirit that was in Christ be in you cuz if this spirit that was in Christ be in you it will also Quicken your mortal body oh we've got that scripture so carnal we've put that scripture so far in the future that we don't even understand that there's quickening power right now it'll Quicken your mortal body yes sir it'll Quicken you that's right to come under subjection to the spiritual revelation of God's word that whatever circumstance you're in you make a Christ mind decision might seem crazy to the world but God will stand by it and it'll work out every time because the very gift that he gave was how that he thought wow thank you Lord that's what he was giving he argued with his disciples why do you murmur why do you act like this basically he was saying why do you think that way you don't think that that Father Knows Hallelujah I have need to go by this place amen well why is he going there that's what's he talking to that woman for don't know come on wouldn't you have liked to have had the spiritual mind and say oh the Master's talking to this woman there's a great Revival fixing to happen Samaria is about to receive the word of God this is God Almighty they couldn't in fact well all of a sudden he stands up on the boat Lord don't you don't you afraid that we perish how many of us today say aren't you afraid I'm going to perish and what's his answer oh you of little faith and he stands up on that bow of the boat he says peace be still hallu Sun breaks through the sky the water lays flat and they sit back and say what manner of man is this hallu hallu you know what you are with a carnal mind you're just another religion I can say this and I and you know I'm not saying this against the messenger I'm saying against what we've made the messenger and what we''ve made what he taught we've turned it into doctrines and we've come up with a message thinking and we've taken this message and made it carnal the greatest spiritual gift since the time of our Lord Jesus yes sir they made it carnal because they weren't willing to accept the truth when it showed them they were wrong the greatest Zeal for this age is to say I was wrong I didn't even look at this situation the way that it really is because the way that things really are cannot be found in carnal discernment that's right or in carnal thinking right or in Earthly Living Lord I Thank You Jesus the the right mind can't the mind of Christ cannot be found in anything that's mixed and is serving two masters it isn't your thinking and his thinking it isn't a blend of your religion and his doctrines it's surrender and death and saying Lord let this mind that was in you be in me amen and no wonder he said I'll send you another comforter and he'll be with you even in you till the end and he'll lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness life is not works life is something that comes in you that you view life from your heart and if Christ be in your heart and your heart hungers for spirituality then that's what you'll be and when I look at this Christmas I understand that it wasn't just God sending a Healer we need healing amen but we have to have a reason for why we're healed we've got to confess that we believe that we're healed we've got to have a purpose that we want to be healed for but yet this body will die it's got to die because we have one waiting amen for us it's got to be changed God can Deliver Us from finances I've paid a lot of people's rent I've made a lot of people's car payments because their finances not because of their finances because of the mind that they have an understanding of money of work they find the easy way and the pastor the quick easy way too lazy to take two jobs too lazy to work overtime too lazy to cut back on the things the pleasures that they have too lazy to cut off their Internet movie service too late to cut lazy to cut off this too too proud to get rid of a car they can't afford cuz their mind's not right and until you change the Mind you'll never change the reality right and it'll repeat itself and repeat itself and they'll run to God and they'll say God help me and all they've done is made God carnal all they want to do is God manifest in the carnal realm I until I can see them until I can touch them until I can put my finger in the holes in his hand I won't believe him Church God's gift was freedom from carnality my kingdom is not of this world if it was mine would be here to fight for me he looks at pilate he says you would have no Authority unless my Father in Heaven gave it to you he didn't change the course of history when it came to his flesh I love that song he could have called 10,000 angels but there was he had a spiritual mind he had a spiritual understanding he didn't do nothing until his Father revealed it to him he was led his mind was not the mind of this world he went to Calvary because of his own cuz he knew there was a people predestinated people that he wanted to give to them how he saw life thank you Lord how he discerned situations how he responded turn the other cheek if you're compelled to go a mile go TW don't borrow or or don't lend in hopes to receive again what is it all it's Spirit my spirit is life and Truth you've got to get in the spirit that's right you have to know that what God's gift to you is the spiritual Mind Of God it's not a carnal gift thank you Lord it's a gift that'll rise you above carnality it'll rise you above Judgment of any man it'll make every man pure in your sight Glory the prophet of God said it would take I believe he said like like U silk and gingham or whatever that cloth is Muslim cloth if I can say it that he says it'll put them together and make them live in harmony it'll take every big eyy and little you out of the situation and out of the circumstance you know what it is to have a spiritual mind is freedom and life true you you don't care what people think of you because you know you're nothing and you know if God is for you who can be against you I love what the prophet of God said before I go someplace I pray till I know that God sent me he says because I know when I get there they're going to say oh brother the meeting's been cancelled and oh this is such and such thing and that's such and such thing and he said I can stand there and say I've come in the name of the Lord God Will Make A Way yes sir this message was the mind of God hallelujah for this age it's spiritual life amen and discernment just as God went to the Gentiles that's right he came back in this generation veiled himself hallu in human flesh and wasn't giving to us religion or secrets to build churches or gather people together right he was giving us the mind of God Amen for the time and age that we were living in so we could take on the spiritual mind of the word of God and be set free from all this stress and all this pressure and all this worry and finally so we could come to the such a spiritual mind mind that we look up because our Redemption draweth near and with hope and joy in our heart we could say even so come quickly Lord Jesus he didn't come to give you something physical he came to give you something spiritual it's a spiritual gift it was man's mind as religious as they were that caused to miss it but he said I'll reveal myself un babes such as are willing to learn are we willing to learn this morning are we willing to sit back and say you know what I may not be right that's what I said this morning I wasn't right about Orlando when I first met him I thought you was off your rocker but the prophet of God said if you draw a circle and put you out you just draw a circle he said if you don't let them and get closer to them walk a few miles in their steps then one day I realized he loved me and I loved him and I could say that about so many of you I realized hey I love him I still think he's off his rocker but I still love him we can't even nowadays accept hardly that somebody loves us we can't genuinely in our heart these words Church mean so much to me when Peter looked at the Lord and said Lord you know all things you know oh that I love you I thought Lord I want to know you love me a spiritual mind will let you believe in yourself it'll quit throwing yourself in the dirt it'll keep throwing yourself under the bus it'll finally let you know that God so loved me he gave his only begotten son and I was yet a sinner he died for me it'll let you rise up in the Realms of the impossible it'll let you know things are not as they appear they're not as they seen cuz I don't look out and discern how things are I look to the Unseen God and I know that the Messiah is here now to do for me exceedingly and abundantly above what I could ask or think Revelation is the change of the Mind sin is revelation perverted and I hope this morning that you can see what I'm trying to say God's gift to us is spiritual don't even look for it in the carnal but because the spirit changes everything carnality is just rearranging the puzzle it's like changing furniture in a room you just move this here and that there and this there and you end up in the same place with the same stuff but a spiritual mind is life and it's peace really understand what God was giving the world he was giving them a more beautiful way to think than they ever imagined he said you say you say but I say unto you you read the scripture and you say but I say unto you and our messenger took a message one day and he said hear ye him hear ye him you're not going to find him in the carnal Realms of this world you're not going to find him in Civilization education you're going to find him in the spirit for all that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and it's the truth that sets you free and the only way you'll ever see truth is not through your carnal judgments but is through the spiritual inside it of the revealed word of God to your heart so really what was it that God brought the world really what was it that the gift that he was giving to us and did we really understand it did we really know what it was it was rejected because of the way way that it was wrapped it was rejected because who it came to but yet God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and what was he he was the word and what is the word it's a thought expressed he was giving us the mind of God because that mind will change the world that you live in God bless you this morning let's stand musicians would come don't forget your calendar if you're a musician Deacon trustee Church cleaner if you're part of of all that we are here uh I I have a little gift for you because you helped me so couldn't make it without you couldn't

just want to speak the name of Jesus that's what I want to do today I want to tell the world that he's made a difference that I can't I don't have to to look at trouble the way I used to look at trouble I don't have to look at sickness the way I used to look at sickness I don't have to look at my enemy the way I used to look at my enemy I don't have to look at life the way I used to look at life I was going to take my life until the great father through the word of God whispered the name of Jesus to me and I found out that there was something that could make me completely different from the inside out you say you do you struggle I struggle am I tempted I'm tempted am I draw off after my own lust I [Music] am but he said I'd never leave you amen nor forsake you and nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand it changed the way I think that's do I get lost and I don't know where I'm going or what I'm doing do I fall into doubt but he said if I started a work in you I'll finish it till the end then my mind becomes his mind and I know I'm okay I know he'll fix my children I know when it's all said and done that one day it'll open up and I'll see the Saints of Glory standing around me and then invite me to step over on to the other side and I'll lift my hands I'll say praise God it's going home time and I'll be caught up in the air with my Lord where would we be if he didn't give us a mind the gift of God is spiritual I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind cuz I know there is peace within your presence I speak Jesus I just want
