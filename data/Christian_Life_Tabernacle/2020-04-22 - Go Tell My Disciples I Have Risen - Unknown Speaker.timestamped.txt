[30:06] hearts Lord those that are unspoken

[30:36] want to commit this service to you with
[30:38] thanksgiving in our hearts we pray in
[30:41] Jesus Christ's name Amen amen
[30:44] [Music]
[30:46] it's certainly a privilege once again to
[30:51] speak to you from our hearts out of the
[30:54] Eternal Word of God so wonderful
[30:58] whenever you feel the call of God and
[31:01] you know that God he's on he's on the
[31:06] scene and he's faithful we certainly
[31:09] appreciate that and just if we can go
[31:14] into the scripture I'm gonna speak to
[31:17] you tonight a little bit something
[31:18] that's that's on my heart I just you
[31:23] know it's times
[31:24] you know there's certain chaos is going
[31:26] on in the whole world and and I think
[31:29] this is a wonderful opportunity for us
[31:31] to you know just take a you know moments
[31:35] like these and just reflect like our
[31:37] pastor said about you know taking a step
[31:40] back and getting like a bird's eye view
[31:42] and to really get the bigger picture and
[31:47] I think it's times like these that we
[31:49] have an opportunity to really to really
[31:52] refocus you know and to really come back
[31:57] to what is my heart purpose well what is
[32:00] what is the purpose of my existence and
[32:02] where did I come from and where you know
[32:06] what is what is what am I here for and
[32:08] where am I going after this and so you
[32:10] know we draw strength from the Word of
[32:12] God and so we just want to share a
[32:15] little bit of a thought out of the
[32:19] Gospel of Mark chapter 16 in mark
[32:23] chapter 16 this is after the
[32:27] resurrection and we'll read verse 15 and
[32:31] he said unto them go ye into all the
[32:35] world and preach the gospel to every
[32:37] creature he that believeth and is
[32:40] baptized shall be saved but he that
[32:43] believeth not shall be damned and these
[32:46] signs shall follow them that believe in
[32:48] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[32:51] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[32:54] take up serpents and if they drink any
[32:56] deadly thing it shall not hurt them and
[32:59] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[33:01] they shall recover so then after the
[33:04] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[33:07] received up in into heaven and sat on
[33:10] the right hand of God and they went
[33:13] forth and preached everywhere and the
[33:15] Lord working with them and confirming
[33:18] the word with signs following a man a
[33:22] man you may have your seeds I also want
[33:25] to look into just a couple more
[33:26] scriptures and you know the thought
[33:29] that's that's bubbling on my heart I
[33:32] just I I believe I won't be long tonight
[33:36] that
[33:37] you know something that that struck me
[33:40] about a month ago and I just I feel like
[33:44] it's a good time for us to personalize
[33:46] the Commission and so I think if we can
[33:50] look also in the example in Matthew
[33:55] Matthew chapter 28 and in verse in verse
[34:03] 1 it says in the end of the Sabbath as
[34:06] it began to dawn towards the first day
[34:09] of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the
[34:12] other Mary to see the sepulchre and
[34:15] behold there was a great earthquake for
[34:17] the angel the Lord descended from heaven
[34:20] and came and rolled the stone from the
[34:23] door that sat upon it and I just think
[34:26] about when I read that Scripture and I
[34:28] just like I said I think it's time that
[34:30] we personalized the Commission he said
[34:33] go ye into all the world and preach the
[34:36] gospel and these signs shall follow them
[34:38] that believe so so the Commission is is
[34:41] to say what he said and watch how God
[34:44] will confirm what he said and so I just
[34:47] I looked at this I looked at this
[34:50] Scripture and I just couldn't help but
[34:52] think about when the prophet of God for
[34:57] our day actually was a mount sunset and
[35:00] there was a great earthquake that
[35:02] transpired and there was going to be a
[35:04] breaking of the seals and so as I'm
[35:08] reading about the the resurrection and
[35:10] so so if we can just just continue to
[35:16] read here a little bit it says and his
[35:18] countenance was like lightning and his
[35:22] raiment white as snow and through and
[35:25] for fear of him the keepers did shake
[35:28] and did and become as dead men and the
[35:32] angel answered and said unto the woman
[35:34] fear not ye for I know that you seek
[35:38] Jesus which was crucified he is not here
[35:43] for He is risen and he said come see the
[35:46] place where the Lord lay and go quickly
[35:50] and tell
[35:51] disciples that He is risen from the dead
[35:53] and behold he goeth before you and
[35:56] Galilee and there shall you see him lo I
[35:59] have told you and I think that's
[36:01] wonderful and that's so if if I was
[36:04] going to speak the subject matter is to
[36:07] go tell my disciples I have risen and so
[36:11] when we consider what our commission is
[36:14] what our call is what our duty is he
[36:18] said when when he commissioned his
[36:20] disciples he said go into all the world
[36:22] and preach the gospel and I'll back up
[36:24] what what promises I've made and so as
[36:30] as we just consider you know the Word of
[36:34] God you know you think about your
[36:37] personal testimony and and I can't help
[36:40] but see you know how God in this endtime
[36:44] has has had an open door you know now
[36:48] there's an open door in heaven and gods
[36:50] he's bidding his subjects come let me
[36:54] prove whatever your need is whatever
[36:56] circumstance you find in yourself in
[36:59] your situation let me prove myself that
[37:02] I'm a healer let me prove to you that
[37:04] I'm a counselor let me prove to you that
[37:07] I'm a comforter and Almighty God amen
[37:13] and so we just you know we certainly we
[37:17] think about how that you know in this
[37:21] end time there would be a great
[37:23] deception that that has gone forth and
[37:26] and you know when when there was a great
[37:29] stone that was rolled over that that
[37:31] cave you know the enemy tried to come
[37:34] and fight against the word at that time
[37:35] and so there was a big denominational
[37:38] stone road over the tomb and so when
[37:42] when Jesus Christ did what he said he
[37:45] would do and he raised from the dead now
[37:48] the the the stone was rolled away and he
[37:52] he said now to go and tell my disciples
[37:56] that I have raised from the dead and so
[38:00] now we just as we consider this
[38:03] you know we want to look and just see
[38:05] the pattern and parallel and draw
[38:07] strength from the Word of God because
[38:10] you know it's it's it just it just
[38:13] struck me how that God has a way of
[38:16] guarding his gospel you know and you can
[38:20] see let's turn in to revelations and
[38:26] we'll just read in chapter 4
[38:30] revelations chapters Force's after I
[38:32] looked and behold a door was open in
[38:35] heaven and the the first voice which I I
[38:39] heard was as it were a trumpet talking
[38:42] with me which said come up hither and I
[38:45] will show you things that must come
[38:48] hereafter and immediately I was in the
[38:51] spirit and behold a throne that was set
[38:54] in heaven and one sat on the throne well
[38:58] I think that's so profound when today
[39:00] many people are trying to chop God up
[39:03] into three or many gods but the Bible's
[39:07] saying here that there was one that sat
[39:09] upon the throne and it wasn't it says
[39:13] and he that sat on the throne
[39:15] looked like Jasper and sardine stone and
[39:18] there was a rainbow round about him
[39:21] around about the throne and in this and
[39:24] in the sight like emerald and round
[39:26] about the throne was four and twenty set
[39:29] seats and upon the seats I saw four and
[39:33] twenty elders sitting and clothed with
[39:35] white raiment and they had on their
[39:38] heads golden crowns crowns of gold and
[39:43] out of the throne proceeded lightnings
[39:45] and thunders and voices and there were
[39:48] seven lamps of fire burning before the
[39:51] throne which are the seven spirits of
[39:54] God and before the throne there was a
[39:56] sea of glass like unto crystal and in
[39:59] the midst of the throne and round about
[40:01] the throne there were four beasts full
[40:05] of eyes before and behind and the first
[40:08] beast was like in a lion and the second
[40:10] like a calf and the third like the face
[40:12] of a man and the fourth beast like a
[40:15] flying eagle
[40:16] and these four beasts each having six
[40:19] wings about him and they were full a
[40:22] full of eyes within and rest not day and
[40:25] night saying holy holy holy Lord God
[40:29] Almighty which was which is and is to
[40:32] come
[40:32] and you know the the Prophet teaches
[40:35] about how that in the Old Testament
[40:37] there was these the the the the four
[40:42] patriarchs talking about Dan being the
[40:46] representing here the flying eagle and
[40:48] and on the the one side was the the calf
[40:53] and on the other side was the man and
[40:56] then the flying eagle and that the the
[41:00] first beast was the the lion of the
[41:02] tribe of Judah and that was guarding the
[41:05] the Holies the the very word of God and
[41:10] and so we're looking today and we want
[41:13] to see how that God in a parallel and in
[41:17] a pattern he also has protected the way
[41:20] back to the garden
[41:22] okay and so something that I just didn't
[41:26] simplicity just feel a little bit you
[41:29] know to to point to because if we can
[41:31] see there's an open door if we can point
[41:34] others when we've come in and we've
[41:36] partaken of you know the Tree of Life
[41:39] because you know at the beginning they
[41:43] couldn't take they couldn't partake of
[41:45] the Tree of Life because it hadn't been
[41:47] made flesh yet okay so now now that
[41:50] we've come on this side now we've
[41:52] partake of the Tree of Life we've tasted
[41:55] and see that he is good and he is
[41:57] faithful he is a healer then now from
[42:00] that standpoint we can now personalize
[42:03] and say well the word said it I've
[42:05] partaken in it and he can do it for you
[42:07] he can he's done it for me if you take
[42:10] him on the same approach in the same
[42:12] basis then you also will receive the
[42:15] benefit Amen so one of the things that
[42:22] you know it's just it's extremely
[42:25] profound in it just it just invigorates
[42:27] my so I get really excited thinking
[42:29] about it but
[42:30] you know when Moses you know when he was
[42:33] told to make what he saw in heaven make
[42:38] make in the likeness on earth and you
[42:44] know that the table the altar the the
[42:47] Ark and and you know I just think that
[42:51] within those those things they're
[42:54] symbols that are extremely profound
[42:57] adjusting limps of something that I
[43:00] think it can really be food for our
[43:02] souls today and so in like a parallel
[43:06] brother branham teaching about how the
[43:08] four Gospels you know Matthew Mark Luke
[43:12] and John are actually guards to - to -
[43:17] to protect and - to the entrance back
[43:23] into the - the Holy Ghost and so you
[43:26] think about the the gospel being guards
[43:29] and now so I just feel - maybe read a
[43:35] scripture and you know it's it's you
[43:40] know one of the great purposes is God's
[43:44] going to reflect his very
[43:45] characteristics what he intended at the
[43:48] very beginning before the fall man and
[43:50] so in Genesis chapter 1 and it says in
[43:55] verse 11 it says and God said let the
[43:59] earth bring forth grass and herbs
[44:01] yielding seed and and fruit trees
[44:04] yielding after his kind whose seed is in
[44:08] itself upon the earth and so it was and
[44:12] so we know that God he's placed
[44:16] transforming power with his within his
[44:18] seed within every seed that he planted
[44:21] it has the power to reproduce itself and
[44:23] then God he had commissioned he said
[44:27] this in verse 26 he said now let us make
[44:30] man in our own image in our likeness and
[44:32] let us let them have dominion so so God
[44:36] commissioned them to be a God on earth
[44:38] to have dominion to be to watch over his
[44:42] creation
[44:43] and to have dominion over the fish of
[44:45] the sea over the fowls of the air over
[44:47] the cattle and over all the earth and
[44:49] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[44:51] the earth and he and so God created the
[44:54] man in his own image and the image of
[44:56] God created he them male and female
[44:59] created he them and God blessed them and
[45:02] God said to them be fruitful and
[45:05] multiply and replenish the earth and
[45:08] subdue it and have dominion over the
[45:10] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[45:13] air and over every living thing that
[45:16] creepeth that moveth upon the earth and
[45:19] God said behold I have given unto you
[45:22] every herb bearing seed which is upon
[45:25] the face of all the earth and every tree
[45:27] in the which is the fruit of the tree
[45:32] yielding seed it is for you for meat so
[45:36] this is a eternal Word of God is an
[45:39] eternal thought of God that has to come
[45:41] to an expression it has to be manifested
[45:44] and and we know that Jesus Christ was
[45:48] the first of many brethren to come and
[45:51] therefore there was there was a a
[45:54] carrier or a there was a believer that
[45:59] this word of promise finally can anchor
[46:02] in in Mary and she came to the place
[46:04] where she said according to the promise
[46:07] of the angel be it unto me and I just
[46:10] believe it's the heart's cry that we say
[46:13] God what you originally commissioned me
[46:16] let me be fruitful and multiply your
[46:19] eternal thoughts and so you know as we
[46:24] consider those things I may be just kind
[46:27] of doing like a little just walk through
[46:30] the Bible a little study of a thought in
[46:35] Genesis chapter 3 and this this is after
[46:41] you know God had had caused into to
[46:46] depart out of he's like now they're
[46:48] gonna have to leave the garden but God
[46:50] he clothed them with animal skins and
[46:53] that was that was now God was going to
[46:57] do something for a man to bring about a
[46:58] restoration and so he said in in verse
[47:02] 22 of chapter 3 says and the Lord said
[47:05] Behold the man is become as one of us to
[47:08] know good and evil now lest he put forth
[47:12] his hand and take also of the tree of
[47:15] life and eat and live forever
[47:19] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[47:22] from the Garden of Eden to till the
[47:25] ground from whence he was taken so now
[47:27] God's sending him out of the garden and
[47:30] so he drove the man out and he placed
[47:35] him on the east of the garden cheer bums
[47:39] and flaming swords which turned every
[47:42] way to keep the way of the Tree of Life
[47:45] you know I just I I thought you know
[47:49] we've been really digging through the
[47:51] church age and book and studying it and
[47:56] and as I was thinking about something
[47:58] that the Prophet was talking about in
[48:00] the church age book it it you kind of
[48:03] brought me to this place in Genesis
[48:08] about how that he placed those cherubims
[48:11] and those cherubims are typed out as the
[48:14] two cherubim that their wings touched
[48:17] and they they were over the mercy seat
[48:20] and so as brother Branham described that
[48:25] that they had a flaming sword that it
[48:28] was death to come back into the garden
[48:30] because now they were guarding the way
[48:32] back to the Tree of Life and so they
[48:38] were turning every way and there's only
[48:41] four ways they're north south east and
[48:44] west and so I love how the prophet of
[48:48] God depicts that and and and Pro trays
[48:50] it in I can't remember the exact message
[48:54] but he talks about how that was the the
[48:57] the for the the four tribes in the Old
[49:00] Testament but the New Testament was the
[49:02] four Gospels you know John being the
[49:05] Eagle anointing and then with Luke was
[49:09] the
[49:10] the man the Ox anointing and then the
[49:16] the lion anointing and to keep the way
[49:21] to the Tree of Life and it's just it's
[49:25] just extremely profound to me that the
[49:27] the when when people took the the first
[49:31] church age messenger Paul and there was
[49:35] a restoration or there was a feeling of
[49:41] the Holy Spirit and then they did the
[49:44] very acts that Jesus did and that was
[49:47] the commission that God said but he now
[49:50] he warned him he said now after my
[49:52] departure Paul saying after my departure
[49:54] Grievous wolves will come in and so what
[49:58] did they start doing they started sewing
[50:00] lies and you know I just you know I'll
[50:04] read a couple of quotes out of the
[50:06] church age book to just kind of you know
[50:10] it's it's good to notice things it's
[50:12] good to notice things like that are
[50:14] happening but I don't think that that
[50:16] should be the very focus like all of the
[50:18] stuff that's going around you we know
[50:20] that the world is headed and and going
[50:23] down into the pit but but for us we want
[50:26] to stay focused and to fulfill the
[50:29] purpose which God commissioned us and
[50:31] and he's promised to empower us with the
[50:36] very promise and God can't fail and so
[50:41] he's asking us he said now know when you
[50:44] receive this promise he said now let it
[50:46] live let it shine before all men that
[50:50] they may glorify your father which is in
[50:52] heaven you know there's a lot of talk
[50:57] about you know people fearing this and
[50:59] fearing that but anytime that the
[51:02] Scriptures refer to this phrase fear not
[51:06] this is something that stood out and
[51:08] I'll just share it with you says that
[51:10] every time the Lord uses these words
[51:12] fear not there is an engagement at hand
[51:16] which will involve great danger and
[51:20] suffering
[51:22] and depravation now he's not saying this
[51:27] to blurt or in a curt manner but he's
[51:34] saying tribulation is coming but that
[51:38] would bring fright to one but like a
[51:40] mother who is about to turn the light
[51:43] off and gently tell her child not lest
[51:46] he be frightened now don't be afraid the
[51:50] light will go out and it will be dark
[51:54] but I am here with you so he says don't
[51:59] be afraid of what man can do to you I am
[52:04] with you my grace is sufficient for you
[52:07] and when you pass through the waters
[52:09] they will not overflow you not even
[52:13] death are you not even in death are you
[52:16] defeated and you are more than
[52:18] conquerors you know I just think you
[52:21] know I take great comfort in that you
[52:24] know you know if if I have to go through
[52:27] something and I just say I know that
[52:31] you're gonna be with me I know that your
[52:34] grace is gonna supply every single step
[52:36] of the way whatever it seems no matter
[52:39] what the circumstance looks like no
[52:41] matter how bad the situation or the
[52:44] diagnosis God is faithful and he
[52:48] promised and he can't lie so he's with
[52:51] the Saints amen amen and so I just you
[52:58] know our liberty and our freedom is
[53:01] connected to truth and when the enemy
[53:03] comes he comes in like a flood the
[53:05] Spirit of God will raise up the standard
[53:08] and those who are partakers of the Tree
[53:10] of Life the very truth of God's Word
[53:13] they're the ones that are that's being
[53:15] lifted up at this end time and so
[53:18] another
[53:37] this is out of the Philadelphian Church
[53:40] age and brother Brown speaking about in
[53:47] Revelations that says I will keep thee
[53:49] in the hour of temptation which shall
[53:51] come upon all the world to try them that
[53:55] dwell upon the the earth this verse is
[53:58] not a declaration to the true church
[54:00] will go into the the through the
[54:03] tribulation if it meant that it would
[54:06] have said so but it said I will keep you
[54:09] from the hour of temptation this
[54:12] temptation is actually exactly like the
[54:16] temptation in Eden it will be very
[54:19] inviting proposition held in a direct
[54:22] opposition to two gods commanded word so
[54:27] so we're setting in the very scene of
[54:29] the Garden of Eden again The Tree of
[54:31] Life is there and the Tree of Knowledge
[54:33] is here and so now he says and yet from
[54:38] the standpoint of human reason it will
[54:41] be so very right so enlightening so
[54:45] life-giving
[54:46] as to fool the world only the very elect
[54:50] will not be fooled the temptation will
[54:54] come as follows thank the Lord for the
[54:59] eyes to this last day the ecumenical
[55:04] move that started on what seemed to be a
[55:08] beautiful blessed principle fulfilling
[55:12] Christ prayer that we all might be one
[55:16] become so strong politically that she
[55:20] bears pressure upon the government to
[55:23] cause all to join with her either
[55:26] directly or through adherence to
[55:28] principles and acted into law so that no
[55:32] people will will be recognized as actual
[55:35] churches unless under direct or indirect
[55:38] denomination of this council little
[55:41] groups will lose their charter privilege
[55:44] etc until they lose all property and
[55:46] spiritual rights with people for the
[55:49] example
[55:50] now unless you have a ministerial a
[55:53] local Ministerial Association approved
[55:56] in many if not all cities one can be can
[56:02] cannot rent a building for religious
[56:06] services and to become a chaplain in the
[56:09] Armed Services or a hospital
[56:11] it is now mandatory to recognize as
[56:16] acceptable to the trinitarian ecumenical
[56:19] group Amen that's the hour we're living
[56:23] in and there's nothing new Under the Sun
[56:26] this is just a repeat of what happened
[56:29] at the first church as the pressures
[56:34] increase and it will it will be harder
[56:37] to resist the into to resist is to lose
[56:41] privilege and so many will be tempted to
[56:44] go along and they will feel that it
[56:46] would be better to sir publicly within
[56:49] the framework of the organization then
[56:52] to not serve God at all publicly but
[56:58] they err to believe that Devils lions to
[57:01] serve Satan even though they may want to
[57:05] call him Jehovah but the elect will not
[57:08] be deceived thanks be to God that the
[57:11] elect will not be deceived but I believe
[57:13] that we're in a time right now where we
[57:15] want to equip ourselves with the truth
[57:17] and not be ignorant of the enemy's
[57:20] devices how he'll he'll even use
[57:23] political systems he'll even use the
[57:25] financial burdens of life to to get
[57:29] people to compromise on the the teaching
[57:32] of the Trinitarian ecumenical groups
[57:35] alright they're gonna lose privileges
[57:38] and and this is my encouragement to each
[57:41] one of us and I take it to myself that
[57:44] they will lose privileges and the
[57:47] temptation is because they want to serve
[57:50] God in the public I'm just saying let's
[57:52] personalize the Commission of God we
[57:55] don't have to have a big badge that
[57:57] somebody hands us out well done you fed
[57:59] this many people you had this a big pat
[58:02] on the back but you know what
[58:04] it's just in our everyday life serving
[58:08] God and letting people know that he's
[58:10] the same yesterday today and forever
[58:13] that he'll do the same thing he's ever
[58:15] done and to be faithful to his word if
[58:18] you take God at His Word watch how he
[58:20] moves on the scene for you
[58:22] he says furthermore the very elect will
[58:26] not only be kept but this move becomes
[58:31] the image erected to the Beast and the
[58:34] Saints will be gone in a rapture a man
[58:37] so we're living in a time where we're
[58:38] seeing there's actually coming forth a
[58:42] maturing of those tears and now now
[58:45] there's a binding so so we can see the
[58:49] modern events are being made clear
[58:53] because these things were spoken years
[58:56] and years ago but it's easy to look at
[58:58] those things and fear and dread but what
[59:02] I'm saying
[59:02] now is though the tears are ripening and
[59:07] maturing and that might be more evident
[59:10] to you but I want to tell you tonight
[59:12] the the wheat seed has been maturing
[59:15] alongside and God is preparing to
[59:18] fulfill his word to bring full
[59:21] restoration watch when that little bride
[59:24] becomes persecuted watch how that third
[59:27] pool is activated watch how that
[59:29] creative power now as they speak the
[59:31] word in their situations I need a job
[59:35] God's faithful Amen he's still Jehovah
[59:37] Jireh oh I heard the testimony that
[59:40] God's still a job giver a man and so
[59:43] he's so faithful hallelujah you know I
[59:52] just I I thank God that he sent Paul and
[59:58] and God he by revelation revealed to him
[1:00:03] things that we needed and so as that
[1:00:08] that way back to the tree of life had
[1:00:11] been guarded by those two cherubims and
[1:00:13] those four beasts powers in the the
[1:00:18] the Gospels they were protecting a way
[1:00:21] back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:23] back to the life to be able to take part
[1:00:27] in the bread of life so these things
[1:00:31] that come upon us we know that he's with
[1:00:33] us and not even death
[1:00:35] what will conquer us and he says now
[1:00:40] this little delightful winsome movement
[1:00:43] that will start that started out in
[1:00:45] fellowship at the Ephesians will become
[1:00:48] a monster of Satan that defiles and
[1:00:51] deceives the whole world and this church
[1:00:54] system of the Roman Catholic and the
[1:00:57] Protestants in coming together will
[1:01:00] control the whole wealth of the world
[1:01:02] and force the whole earth into a
[1:01:05] religious trap or will kill them by
[1:01:09] refusing them the privilege of buying or
[1:01:12] selling whereby they would make a living
[1:01:15] this will be accomplished simply for the
[1:01:19] harlots daughters are all but gone back
[1:01:22] to her in the meantime
[1:01:24] Rome will acquire nearly all the
[1:01:27] supplies of gold and the Jews have the
[1:01:29] bonds and all the paper at the right
[1:01:32] time the harlot will destroy the
[1:01:34] present-day money system by calling all
[1:01:37] of the paper and demanding the gold with
[1:01:40] no gold the system fails and the Jews
[1:01:43] will be trapped into an alliance and the
[1:01:46] harlot church will take over the whole
[1:01:49] world this this world is headed for a
[1:01:52] cliff where they're gonna enthroned the
[1:01:55] Antichrist be system amen but because
[1:02:00] God has given you an ear to hear and
[1:02:03] eyes to see the the prophet of God
[1:02:06] already told us in advance what was
[1:02:09] going to transpire and when we see this
[1:02:11] time now we can say I know you're with
[1:02:14] me I know you're in me I know there's a
[1:02:17] purpose while I'm still here
[1:02:24] you know it's not a time to dread for
[1:02:26] the for the believer it's time to take
[1:02:29] God's promises and say I have been given
[1:02:33] an inheritance
[1:02:34] I have loved ones I have needs in my
[1:02:37] body I had needs within my neighborhood
[1:02:40] I had you know and God's he's he's so
[1:02:43] Willie and he's wanting to come on the
[1:02:45] scene right now and give you courage to
[1:02:51] claim your god-given right so when the
[1:02:55] world is going and and they're
[1:02:57] manifesting that Kingdom and the power
[1:03:02] that he has is fear to bind up to
[1:03:05] oppress and to subjugate and to enforce
[1:03:09] that power but God on the other end is
[1:03:13] by love wooing us back to the garden and
[1:03:15] thus recognizing God's has a provided
[1:03:18] way and that's the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:20] and so when we consider those things we
[1:03:23] want to look at those two those two
[1:03:26] cherubims I just I can't help but see I
[1:03:29] almost see like Paul and and brother
[1:03:32] branham those those prophet messengers
[1:03:34] protecting the mercy seat and when the
[1:03:37] word was preached now we had a former
[1:03:40] and a latter rain so now there's a
[1:03:41] teaching rain that has gone forth and
[1:03:44] it's been sowed into our generation and
[1:03:46] now there's a crop that is receiving the
[1:03:49] word of the hour and now it's beginning
[1:03:52] to produce a life of Christ that's not
[1:03:55] dead he but he said I'm risen and where
[1:03:57] is my where am I where am I where's my
[1:04:01] dwelling place where's the place of my
[1:04:03] rest and so he's now he's looking for
[1:04:06] altars he's looking for the heart of man
[1:04:10] to make his abode and so God has a
[1:04:14] provided way and that's by the blood and
[1:04:17] so when we consider that we just really
[1:04:19] rejoice and with that's what we want to
[1:04:21] point to is you know I want to
[1:04:24] personalize the Commission if I haven't
[1:04:25] received the blood and been able to come
[1:04:29] back into the garden and have that
[1:04:31] garden condition where my fellowship
[1:04:33] with God is unbroken and my my position
[1:04:36] as a son or you as a dog
[1:04:39] hasn't been restored yet then I say come
[1:04:42] to the fountain because the the blood of
[1:04:44] Jesus cleanses you from all sin and he
[1:04:47] restores your soul he'll bring that
[1:04:50] refreshing and then from that point now
[1:04:53] we can point others and say there's an
[1:04:55] open door there's a gate the the Bible
[1:04:58] says Strait is the gate and narrow is
[1:05:01] the way and that word actually is is not
[1:05:04] like crooked or versus straight that
[1:05:09] that word actually is is a water channel
[1:05:12] and so the Gospels were speaking in the
[1:05:15] Great Commission he says go into all the
[1:05:17] world and baptize them in the name of
[1:05:19] the Father Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:05:21] well that waterway was in the name of
[1:05:23] Jesus Christ that was the provided way
[1:05:26] to repent and be filled with his spirit
[1:05:29] and so then now we can share that with
[1:05:33] others say I've parked took of the Tree
[1:05:37] of Life because God has protected it
[1:05:39] throughout all the generations till now
[1:05:43] this is a real living Savior not only is
[1:05:48] he a savior but he's a healer
[1:05:50] he's a redeemer he's Almighty God he'll
[1:05:55] never be defeated
[1:06:07] a ma'am well we just was so grateful
[1:06:11] that he said that blessed are you when
[1:06:15] you hunger and thirst you shall be
[1:06:17] filled and and the thing is is he knew
[1:06:21] that you know he would give up his life
[1:06:24] and he realized that the spirit that was
[1:06:29] in him when the when the veil was torn
[1:06:33] and he gave up that Ghost now he made a
[1:06:35] way for us to come and receive his very
[1:06:38] spirit and you know the Bible says that
[1:06:44] you shall be filled and you shall be
[1:06:45] filled with his spirit that is the
[1:06:48] promise and what does his spirit do his
[1:06:51] spirit leads us and guides us into the
[1:06:54] revealed Word of the hour and that word
[1:06:57] has the power to transform us and it has
[1:07:00] the ability to transform our speech it
[1:07:03] has the power to transform our conduct
[1:07:06] it has the power to cause you to have a
[1:07:10] new job it has the power to keep the
[1:07:15] cupboards full of food it has the power
[1:07:18] to sustain you in a time of trouble amen
[1:07:42] and the resume of the church ages
[1:07:47] brother branham speaks about he says
[1:07:49] that now this may seem far-fetched to
[1:07:52] some but actually the very plain for all
[1:07:55] to see because right now the churches
[1:07:59] are controlling politics and at the
[1:08:01] opportune time will manifest exactly how
[1:08:04] great that control is how great is that
[1:08:08] control this eka medical move will end
[1:08:11] up with Rome at the head even through
[1:08:14] even though the people did not envision
[1:08:17] it that way it is because in Revelations
[1:08:21] 17 3 through 6 it states that the horror
[1:08:24] Mystery Babylon is seated on the Beast
[1:08:27] and she is controlling the last and
[1:08:31] fourth Empire this Rome Roman Church is
[1:08:35] doing that with the world council
[1:08:38] systems under her rome will be
[1:08:40] controlling and this image church system
[1:08:43] will be obedient to Rome because Rome
[1:08:46] controls the gold of the world thus all
[1:08:51] the people have to belong to the world
[1:08:54] church system or be at the mercy of the
[1:08:57] elements for they cannot buy or sell
[1:09:01] without the mark of the beast in the
[1:09:03] hand or the head and this mark in the
[1:09:07] hand in the head means that they will
[1:09:09] take the doctrine of the world church
[1:09:13] system which is trinitarianism etc and
[1:09:16] the mark in the hand is what means to do
[1:09:20] the will of the the world church and
[1:09:23] with the great power that the church
[1:09:26] system will persecute the true by true
[1:09:29] bride this image will try to keep the
[1:09:33] bride from preaching and teaching etc
[1:09:36] her ministry will be forbidden to give
[1:09:39] comfort and truth to the people who need
[1:09:42] it for before the Antichrist in person
[1:09:45] takes over the complete system of
[1:09:47] churches the true church will be taken
[1:09:50] away from this world
[1:09:54] and be with the Lord God will catch his
[1:09:57] bride away to the marriage supper of the
[1:09:59] lamb you know I just say we recognize
[1:10:02] that the the prophet of God taught us
[1:10:05] that but let's take this time and
[1:10:07] refocus and personalize the Commission
[1:10:10] because there is names on the Lamb's
[1:10:13] Book of Life that God is saying it's
[1:10:16] from faith to faith
[1:10:17] it's each one of us in our daily lives
[1:10:19] the enemy may have tried to come and
[1:10:22] disrupt things because he doesn't like
[1:10:25] God to receive worship and praise he
[1:10:28] wants praise and worship he has
[1:10:29] everybody to where they're just at home
[1:10:32] taking in all of his lies and and taking
[1:10:36] partaking of the tree of knowledge
[1:10:37] through entertainment and different
[1:10:39] things but there's a people that are not
[1:10:41] satisfied with the things of the world
[1:10:43] and they recognize there's a deep cry in
[1:10:46] the heart Lord finish the work that you
[1:10:49] started in your body in your bride and
[1:10:51] let me play my part let me be faithful
[1:10:54] not to be caught up with the
[1:10:56] intoxications of Laodicea and the things
[1:10:58] that are happening right now though it's
[1:11:00] very intense to them but for us we don't
[1:11:04] dread and fear it because our God is
[1:11:06] with us who is greater than our God
[1:11:09] there is none like our God I just think
[1:11:17] that it's it's it's so wonderful you
[1:11:20] know I I just took a look in the
[1:11:23] scripture and in Exodus 25 and you know
[1:11:29] what I didn't mean to take very long and
[1:11:32] just maybe ask the musicians to come I
[1:11:35] just wanted to encourage you to you know
[1:11:37] it's it's so important to stay focused
[1:11:40] in these times that the enemy tries to
[1:11:43] throw all of these distractions we're
[1:11:45] not ignorant we know what's going to
[1:11:47] happen our prophet taught us and the
[1:11:50] Spirit of God confirmed that we're only
[1:11:53] here for a short season and so when we
[1:11:57] consider that we just rejoice and in in
[1:12:00] Exodus 20:5 in verse 1 it says and the
[1:12:05] Lord spoke unto Moses saying speaking
[1:12:08] the children of Israel that they bring
[1:12:11] me an offering of every man that gives
[1:12:14] that willing willingly with his heart ye
[1:12:18] shall take my offering you know and
[1:12:21] that's that's just you know God's a
[1:12:23] perfect gentleman you know he makes the
[1:12:25] call and and he wants us to identify
[1:12:28] with his word and so I feel like if we
[1:12:32] can personalize the call saying I'm not
[1:12:35] ashamed to be identified with a god that
[1:12:38] can supernaturally undertake for a job
[1:12:41] oh I will testify now to those who need
[1:12:47] a job because I heard tonight that God
[1:12:50] was faithful when the believers went to
[1:12:53] their knees they went to their God and
[1:12:55] God undertook for the believers and so I
[1:13:00] want to say you know it's it's with the
[1:13:02] willing heart that I say God let me take
[1:13:06] the Word of God according to what you
[1:13:09] said this entire message and it's not oh
[1:13:13] don't smoke don't drink don't do drugs
[1:13:18] don't run oh it's come there's an open
[1:13:22] gate to the Tree of Life come and take
[1:13:25] the words of life into your heart and
[1:13:27] watch it produce what he said it would
[1:13:30] it'll bring the hearts crying it'll
[1:13:33] satisfy all of your longings
[1:13:39] in verse 16 it says and thou shalt put
[1:13:43] the Ark of testimony which I give thee
[1:13:46] and thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure
[1:13:48] gold deity two cubits and a half shall
[1:13:53] be the link thereof into in a cubit and
[1:13:56] a half the breadth thereof and thou
[1:13:58] shalt make two cherubims of gold of
[1:14:01] beaten work shalt thou make them and the
[1:14:06] two ends of the mercy mercy seat and
[1:14:11] make one cherubim on the one end and the
[1:14:15] other cherubim on the other end even
[1:14:19] above the mercy seat shall ye make the
[1:14:23] cherubims on the ends thereof and I just
[1:14:29] feel will be closing here in just a
[1:14:32] minute and why don't we stand
[1:14:36] I just wanted to encourage your Saints
[1:14:41] you know there's there's times that are
[1:14:45] one of these days time will be no more
[1:14:48] the this thing will wrap up and and the
[1:14:52] things that we hold dear today we want
[1:14:56] to make sure that they have an eternal
[1:14:57] value and the Bible says this in Isaiah
[1:15:00] 55 it says lo everyone that thirst is
[1:15:04] come ye to the waters and he that hath
[1:15:08] no money come ye and buy and eat
[1:15:12] yay come yay come and buy wine and milk
[1:15:17] without money and without price
[1:15:20] wherefore do you spend money for that
[1:15:23] which is not bread and your Labor's they
[1:15:26] II that which satisfying not hearken
[1:15:30] unto me and eat ye that which is good
[1:15:34] let your soul delight itself in fatness
[1:15:37] and incline your ear and come unto me
[1:15:41] and hear and your soul shall live and I
[1:15:45] will make an everlasting covenant with
[1:15:47] you even the sure mercies of David a man
[1:15:52] I believe that God has some testimonies
[1:15:54] I believe God has some witnesses let's
[1:15:57] go let's personalize the Commission
[1:16:00] let's let the Word of God no let the
[1:16:04] world know that the Word of God has
[1:16:07] taken place in the altars of our heart
[1:16:10] that there is a refuge there's a place
[1:16:12] even if they are poor and they don't
[1:16:14] have money
[1:16:16] but there's a long I now want to go on a
[1:16:19] search where those who are unsatisfied
[1:16:22] where are those that maybe don't have
[1:16:24] money to buy but as freely as you've
[1:16:27] been given freely give Amen Lord bless

[1:16:45] mercy seat and this these these two
[1:16:48] prophet messengers one at the beginning
[1:16:51] and one at the end Lord they they both
[1:16:53] spoke the same thing Lord brother
[1:16:56] branham said I preached what Paul
[1:16:59] preached Oh God let this bleeding bloody
[1:17:02] word cover us Lord and let it be on the
[1:17:04] altar of our heart that others when we
[1:17:07] point to the Tree of Life Lord that they
[1:17:10] can those who are unsatisfied can find a
[1:17:13] place of satisfaction and rest oh god
