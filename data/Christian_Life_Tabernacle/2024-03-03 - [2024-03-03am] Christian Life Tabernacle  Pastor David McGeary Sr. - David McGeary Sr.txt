Description:
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
March 3, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

sing that this morning amen so good to be Gather in the house of God Amen let's just sing that as you invite brother M you were the word in the beginning one when God Lord most high your hid glory in creation oh and I revealing you are Christ what a beautiful name it is oh what a beautiful name it is the name of Jes Jesus [Applause] Christ oh and what a beautiful name it is nothing think I'm P to this what a beautiful name it is oh the name of Jesus you didn't want heaven without us oh Jesus you brought Heaven [Music] down my S was great your love was greater oh and I could separate us now what a wonderful name it is oh what a wonderful name it is the name name of [Applause] Jesus oh and what a wonderful name it is nothing g p to this what a wonderful name it is the name of Jesus Amen let's go ahead and bow our heads commit the service to him heavenly father truly you have a wonderful Name Lord in it's in that name that all that you are is made known Lord all of your characteristics all of your thoughts all of your attributes all that you are your identity and Your Name Lord and that you have given us that name that we might have the opportunity to share in your characteristics and in your attributes and in your thoughts in all that you are Lord what a wonderful name it is Father you said that where two or three are gathered in your name there you are in the midst because you are in your name father we commit this service to you Lord we ask that it might be pleasing that you might put your name in this service Lord for outside of your presence since this is just another religious gathering of men Lord to fellowship with one another about the scriptures or the thought of the day or satisfy themselves with worshiping around their favorite songs but Lord if you aren't present in our midst all of that is in vain we commit the service to you that you would be present amen that you would be lifted up Lord that you would make yourself known and that your name could be found in this place we pray these things in jesus' name amen you may be seated just a minute I'm going to turn to Psalm 63 this morning you know and uh oddly enough my mind has been on communion this week you know and uh something that certainly comes to mind as we start off a new month something that you know we begin to turn our hearts toward as we think on our next communion service you know each time we read that scripture out of 1 Corinthians 11 where Paul is instructing the Believers how they should be approaching the Lord's Supper you know you see Paul wasn't there when Jesus participated in this with his disciples he was still among the Pharisees sitting at gelo's feet what he describes in 1 Corinthians 11 was something that the Lord revealed to him years later and we read it every month 1 Corinthians 11 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you but you know it's worth spending time in the scriptures of that night Matthew 26 and Luke 22 and what Jesus was dealing with his disciples about all that he showed them in those Final hours in that final night in John 13 through 19 you know and I always encourage everyone to spend some time looking at those as well as we begin to set our hearts toward communion but you see this supper wasn't for everybody you know this wasn't something he did openly in the synagogue on the Sabbath that you know everyone might participate but he took just a few those that were close to him and brought them into a little place set apart and asked them to join him in Fellowship when all the religious and cultural traditions of the day of the hour said that they would should be out with their own father's house celebrating the Passover but instead they were in this little place with him and he was sharing something with them that no one else had a part of ultimately even Judas could not remain in this place even though he had been part of the fellowship for years just a few chapters earlier in in Matthew 20 Jesus was asked by the mother of two of these disciples if he would grant them positions next to him in their Kingdom and he responded in verse 22 you know not what you ask and he challenges them are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of course they said that they declared they were able and he said You shall indeed drink of my cup you see he was inviting them to participate in something to be a part of something that night in that room what's interesting is rather than take the lamb which was the centerpiece of that meal a sacrificial animal he took the bread and he said this not the lamb represents my body you know when he was here his testimony of himself was never I am the Lamb of God it was I am the bread of life his Focus was on his bread and his cup and handed that to these men those who were with them with him in this intimate place and gave them an opportunity to be partakers of that but to participate in that offer you had to be in the room with him because if you were not in the room with him you were not a participant of that Fellowship you know and everyone else was out celebrating whatever religious or cultural motions were expected of that day but they were Miss missing entirely the offer that was being made to partake with him in his bread and his cup you know in communion you see communion is not about eating bread and wine drinking wine you know this isn't about performing our ritualistic checkbox to make sure that we drink enough cups of wine and eat enough loaves of bread to be sufficiently religious that's the case as we were fellowshipping with a couple folks the other night every Italian restaurant in town would be have us beat but we could stand in this line every single Sunday night and still never participate in communion you know every time we take that bread and take that cup we are declaring that we are sharing that bread and cup with him ourselves amen and that we are in communion with him amen we're giving witness that each of us individually are in that place in that little room sharing that communion with him not a good message believer not a good worshipper not a faithful church member not a student of the scriptures that understand understand all the secrets but someone who is in the room with him for themselves otherwise to take that bread and that cup is to give witness to something that isn't true we're going to read Psalm 63 this morning it's just a little short Psalm and this was on my mind as I was reading this it's a chapter about communion and it begins in verse one God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee not church not a sermon not a worship service not an anointing not Fellowship my soul thirsteth for you for him my God not someone else's not the churches not the prophets mine my soul thirsteth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is now notice what he says in verse two to see thy power and thy Glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary Lord I want to see your power and your glory the same way I see it in the sanctuary he's not saying I want to see your power and your glory in the sanctuary I want to see it the same as I saw it in the sanctuary he wants to see it for himself by himself you know we can all say that we've seen his presence we've seen his glory we've seen his movement in a church service but I wonder if we can say that we see him that way when we're not in a church service am I in that place am I in that little room of communion with him that I see him the same way there that I see in church or do I have to be in church to see him see I'm talking about communion because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee not because I'm in church not because of the music or the preacher or the worship leader but because your loving kindness is better than life my lips will praise you thus will I bless thee while I live this is how I will bless God this is how I will bless him I will lift up my hands in thy name his identity his work we just sang beautiful name what he wants done his attribute his work I will lift up my hands to that my hands will move under his administration this is more than just describing what I do in a church service when the music is playing and the people are worshiping what are my hands doing this is about what real communion looks like you know in Matthew 7 Jesus said not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands unto thy name he goes on to say many will say to me in that day Lord Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful Works we've taken communion every Sunday and then I will profess unto them I never knew you there was no communion with him it was just folks doing religious looking things let's stand this morning as we read Psalm 63 you know this is a Psalm of communion where it describes one who is in communion with him and you know my prayer for myself is that I am in that little room with him that I am in that little place with him because it's not about what I do but it's who I do it with amen and let's read that Psalm 63 together oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory so as I see thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee and the night watches because thou H has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I Rejoice my soul followeth heart after thee thy right hand upholdeth me but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes but the king shall rejoice in God everyone that sweareth by him shall Glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped amen a flen God bless you may have your seats amen oh I am

and I know that I can make it oh and I know [Music] no matter what may come my way my life [Music] Isen that I didn't put my mic on today uh that last part of that uh verse sometimes is hard to believe isn't it that your life is in his hand uh maybe things aren't going too well or uh there's a challenge and you just can't see how God could be in it you know what I mean but yet he'll never leave you nor forsake you he'll be with you always so let's just bow our heads as we approach them this morning our gracious Heavenly Father your word testifies that you'll never leave us nor forsake us and we were taught so perfectly that the sunshiny Skies doesn't mean you're for us neither does the storm clouds of life mean that you're against us father our faith only has one place to rest and that's in the Eternal Word of God so father this morning we ask that you would bless us and break that word to us this morning in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles uh uh if you turn over into uh Corinthians uh the uh 13th chapter of Corinthians and do I have that and they'll put this on me while you're finding that can you get a button up am I on I'm kind of like a child you know the scripture says unless you become like children and so you know they now I I need a lot of extra care you know I mean Lesley's always brushing food off of me and you know and and I never did like this part but you know like when your mom used to take spit and rub it on your hair to you know make you look better I just thought that was always so I thought that would go away but uh you know it it never goes away uh love always has certain characteristics doesn't it so we want to talk uh uh uh share we're going to listen to about 18 minutes of tape as a foundation and uh to our scripture and where we're going uh with this this morning because I believe there's great Wonders that lies ahead for the church and one of man's great uh mistakes is they always get ahead of God they they catch a glimpse of something or they feel there's something in the air and they run after it and they produce something that they feel is fulfilling that sense that they're feeling and then they gather around that and they say this is it but the this is the we know these great scriptures here as Paul is speaking and I guess it's worthwhile to read this wonderful chapter he says though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol so Paul's moving the emphasis here if you could follow this and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing now all these why is he emphasizing these things because these things have become measuring sticks okay Paul's trying to turn their eyes away from how they're measuring things and what they're measuring and get them back in Focus okay okay then he goes to explain a little bit about the character so you can have these things and not have this character right and this is where Paul wants to emphasize now charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity EV vanth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked I need to work on that public confession think thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth Thy word is truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth once again now watch where Paul is moving the emphasis watch his warning against how that they are judging and determining spirituality charity never faileth but where there be prophecies they shall fail where there be tongues they shall cease where there be knowledge it shall vanish away how many knows that great knowledges of the past are no longer knowledges today for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away now I want to hold that there uh with you okay cuz in other words if it says when that which is perfect is come now we have a lot of ideas on that the best that I can do this morning is you have to come to that answer yourself I'm going to share with you this morning what I feel what that which is perfect is and why the Capstone and love is such a part of it he said then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spoke as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things now this is a loving rebuke of Paul he say putting your emphasis on these things is childish I used to think that way but I've become a man I've matured I've come into a greater Revelation and understanding okay so now I'm going to put away childish things so what is he saying the childish thing is he's saying because you judge things by tongues because you judge things by prophecy by you judge things by that and that that's childish you're missing the real way that you judge things for there's something of Greater Perfection that is coming hallelujah amen all listen he said he says for now we see through a glass darkling and as we don't fully understand these things they're obscure to us and when somebody doesn't see something ahead they have a tendency to cleave to where they're at or to the past when when they're when they're when it's not clear and they're going into the unknown they cleave to that what they know they hold on to the past they they don't want to venture forward we see but then face to face now I know in part but then but then so that but then means when that comes when that which is perfect is come then shall I know even as also I am known so he says and he cloes now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated I I always feel that honesty is the best policy and uh uh so I'm going to try to be honest we've been uh studying and reading out of certain messages about the the the seed and we we've been talking about that life and that seed and the growth of that seed and and uh so you know I I I've never felt much that it's important to defeng yourself but I think it's you also owe your congregation explanations for why that you do what you do and the direction that you go in and I know there's lots of uh questions arise uh around certain times of the year and uh I've heard comments about our church and and myself that we don't believe uh in gifts and we don't believe in the uh baptism of the Holy Spirit and uh we don't believe in this or that now I believe in them okay I I I I don't think everything has to be a public display and I don't believe those things are only for the church house I believe it's important that the gifts are within the believer and they're within the church and there's been an order given to that but I I want you to understand why it is this morning that I don't pursue that Avenue you understand why I I don't emphasize it or try to create a uh uh uh uh uh the excitement over participating in that and I say this and I I I I'm not going to back my own self out I want you to listen to the messenger of the hour okay and and what that he's trying to point out to the people also what I feel that Paul was trying to point out to them there is a Perfection coming okay that is a a a wonderful uh Perfection above even uh what that we might perceive as being a move of the spirit and so we're going to start if you have uh uh some of you have I guess phones or tablets or some means of reading along we'll have it on the board but we're going to pick up in the message Harvest Time where uh brother brand was having a a uh discussion with a a Baptist Minister who felt that the that the baptism of the Holy Spirit was only for the disciples now I want to clearly make this clear the baptism of the holy spirit is not receiving the gifts the baptism of the holy spirit is receiving the person of Jesus Christ amen that is the baptism of the holy spirit amen it's the personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally amen he has a presence he can be felt you can feel his touch you can feel his power he can do exceedingly and abundantly above that which you could even ask for thing he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's all powerful though as we read here as we pick up brother Ram's talking to this Baptist and he's pointing out to him and as we pick it up that there is a such thing as of the baptism of the Holy Spirit there is is an experience where you move from the intellectual into the reality of the presence of God you can believe something faith without faith it's impossible to please God you can believe something but faith is is the substance that brings that promise into reality amen you could say I believe in God I believe in this I believe in that that's belief belief and Faith are two different things that's right we can say I I we could give all the Litany of the things that we believe and not have faith but faith is the is the your heart's desire to make the word of God become real in your life let me say that again faith is your heart's desire to see the word of God become real in your life not on somebody else not the fact that you've seen it and the effects of it on somebody else but it's when you want it for yourself faith is a hungering it's a thirsting after the things of God it's a desire to have those things that are promised alive in your life and if there's anything that our messenger with the love that he had in his heart tried to get to the people was he's the same you can have these things in your life they're for you amen so he starts out where we're going to pick up and he's explaining uh and expressing to the Pentecostal uh church that he's preaching to is the need and necessity to move on okay he's not condemning where they are but he's trying to express to them that there there's something that we can move into don't set up camp you know keep pressing F he he's he's he's trying to make that evident evident to them that that there that they're that to move on that there was a life and a promise to move into so he's not just trying to say where you're at is no good that's not what he's saying but he's saying that God has something for you he has a something to move on into and don't stop and and that's that's what I'm trying to express to you is is that we don't want to create an Evidence or uh some sort of measuring tape that the spirit of God is with us we don't want to say the spirit of God With Us is because we run the spirit of God is with us because we shout the spirit of God is with us that this that that is exactly the same thing as saying Loy is here or Loy is there or all those things we don't want to miss what it is that God is offering could I use that expression to those that love him I'm not oppos to any move of the spirit as long as the believer himself doesn't set his temp tent up there and doesn't Camp there and claims because of it they have it that's right so we want to go and can and we go on so let's finish this great scripture here he says for now we see through a glass darking but when face to face I know in part but then shall I know even also as I am known and we'll we'll pick it up here now for 18 minutes that's not too long to listen to the message I when those 18 minutes are done I'll guarantee you I'm going to sit right there I want to keep going but but let's let's just feed on this and and let's let's hope that we can grab this in our heart that we all in here this morning can move on to Perfection these things shall we do if God permits but let us move on to Perfection uh as we pick this up if you have your phones we're going to start in uh paragraph 170 uh four uh of Harvest Time and we're just going to listen over to paragraph um uh the end I believe it is of of one uh uh 226 I believe it is so anyway Lord richly bless you as we listen to this wonderful message Harvest Time noise abroad there was all shouting and praising God they said man Brethren what can we do to be saved Peter said can't every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost far the promise is to you and to your children and to them as far off even as many as the Lord are God so called heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never failed you Pentecostal pay no attention to the Methodist Baptist or Presbyterian you know that was forever generations and you pressed into it certainly now just don't stop pressing right there just keep on pressing see that's where methodists made their state they pressed into sanctification but stop Luther pressed into justification stop see then it organizes there it dies that's the end of it it's all of it watch now as we hurry up to when the spirit of true WID done he will teach you all things whatever taught you oh my bearing all remembrance to you what I've said to you bringing to you all the meance and he will show you things to come he will vindicate every word confirming the word with signs f everything that he promised that God promised in the Bible if you'll turn loose from every Creed and everything else and hold on to the word God is obligated to take care of his word and so when they did this the word vindicates itself he don't need somebody say well the days of Miracles has passed who's that man to tell me the days of Miracles is pass when I was once a blind man Hallelujah I once laid with the doctors give me three minutes to live and I'm living today how can they tell me any [Music] different once the lukewarm Church never now f with the Holy Ghost God don't need any interpreter the spirit itself which is the word interprets it to be the truth if a man will dare to stand out and take he's his own interpreter try him one time and find out that this right don't payent what somebody else said do what God Said do what say I do this but what about the other every word one word breaks the chain that's where the churches always fail right on that chain they organize it get the thing together and make a big denomination these man get together Holy Father SE and so and Dr Bishop so and so and what's the first thing you have there you are you die right there we prove it by nature and by the word if the Lord willing in a few minutes all right bring into remembrance he vindicates every word and we live by it Hallelujah live by man shall live by every word every word Vindicated Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe shall follow them that believe take a hold of it God vindicates it it's the truth where the seminaries and theologians inspired but Satan say you can't trust it that's for the apostles the days is passed there's no such thing that was only meant for the apostles to prove the gospel then we have learning people today they had better learning then we got now tell me any church to come up with that that sanin when their great great great great grandfathers had to be priests behind one crooked word in that and that scroller they stwn him part they had stay right exactly but they miss seeing the real kernel of the word when it comes the life that's why they were condemned and called the workers of Satan see that don't reflect the word of God when a Seminary Student tells you the Holy Ghost is not for today and these things all that Divine Healing stuff for some other days see it's not a reflection from God it's a reflection from a a Creed it's a reflecting from the doctrine it's outside the Bible Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday and forever St John 14:12 said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also now how you going to take that word out of there how you going to add something in this place you break the chain of Life man lives by Bread only the bre eternally he lives by that bread physically he lives by this bread there's the two bread the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is in you said amen to every word of God if that is the Holy Ghost I want to ask you something now this is that pinion part Mama used to give me cast a when I was a kid I can't stand the smell of this stuff yet we us raised poor and Mama borrow meat skins or render them out we get them down from an old sister named Goodman had a bakery down there she Bak hands and and render that out we get meal and take that grease and stuff and make our cornbread and we had poor eating no wonder we had malnutrition and so forth pling but Mom then every Saturday night we we didn't get the right kind of food so she make us all take a big ghost cast off and I just hold my nose and scream I said Mom it makes me so sick she said if it don't make you sick it don't do you any good so maybe that'll work this way now how I'm going to ask you something how can a man or a woman who claims to be filled with the Holy Spirit which is the word that right amen and how can you be the Flesh of that Holy Spirit as made you part of him to reflect the gospel of your age and deny the word that he wrote I don't care how good you are well I can take you to Africa to the the Hot Tops there and show you a life that a Christian can't touch even if they' be caught in adultery if one of the women before she's married a young woman she has to be test tested first for her virginy if she be found guilty just to tell what man did it and they're both killed together what if that happened in the United States who would bury all the cars see so but there you are see and they're heathens see the morale see so you can't test it with that our Indian brother here can tell you now the mohammad's probably have a lot better life than we ever think about but what is it it's the word that gives a test that Pharisees was twice as humble as Jesus he went around tearing up their churches and throwing them out and beating them out and everything like that this God the old preach you know well who was if I was having a meeting against him this morning I'd say who come to you when you were sick prayed for you that Godly old priest who long Papa that money when his crops fail that Godly old priest who dedicated you to God for a life of servant that Godly old priest who was it when he was in jail come and visit you that Godly old priest and this young Renegade called Jesus what does he do called your pastor a snake see it's not by the fruits it's by the word man shall not live by fruit alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and he was that word they just failed to see that's what he's supposed to do they couldn't sit because it wasn't ordain to sit that you can't come to me look at that poor Jews their eyes were blind blinded sure he did it he blinded himself think of how it would be to be blinded B be thanking God for what sight you got on the scripture now notice now he he was this word now after this he was tested Jesus tested now we're going through see it doesn't reflect the word When anybody says well that was for another age because the Bible said he's the same yesterday and forever how the Holy Spirit you could say that you are a filled with the Holy goost now it's going to hurt you a little bit is it all right raise your hand you won't be mad at me if you do you have to how can you win with bobbed hair telling you that you're filled with the Holy Ghost one word oh I spoke in Tong I don't make any difference I've seen Witch Doctors speak in Tong interpret that shock the spirit dance in the spirit how can you make call yourself ah head of the house and let your wife wear shorts and carry on the way she call yourself Christians how can you pastors ever face god with a thing like that without standing up and protesting you can't make them do it but if you get preaching like that you won't belong in the Seminary very longer with the gr you'll have to get cooperation from somewhere else we'll get into it just in a moment the Lord will see but there you are don't I don't mean to hurt you I love you that's the reason if you were floating down the river and I've seen you go to drown I'd be a poor fell say well be a good person honey you [Music] better I said the other night if I'm a Christian I had to be identified with every character of the Bible I had to stand with Lord and preach with him in the days and warn the people right I had to stand on Mount carel alone with Elijah I had to stand at Calvary and be crucified to myself and my own Thoughts with him but then again I raised with him is triumph over all things all the caral of the carnalities that world raised above it in him notice it doesn't reflect the word then no it doesn't vindicate it now but if you believe the word God will vindicate himself as he did here in Jesus the word bread always means to be fed on and the man shall not live by bread like this bread alone but by every word so that's the word bread keep that in mind this is this bread that the church to every age has fed on has been the hidden Mana just for the Overcomer only Revelation said so am now I don't have time to break this whole thing down because I probably got another 30 minutes but look when the Holy when the Holy Mana fell from heaven which was a tie of the Holy Ghost you agree on that God told Moses to go out and get an R full of it and put it in the holiest of holies because if they didn't put it in the holies of holies it become stagnant is that right the worms got into it now he said but put it in the Hol of holies in this om that every generation coming up after that priesthood when a man becomes to go to the be a priest to minister the word the first thing he gets to do after he ordained is go in and get a handful of that origal man and eat it that was the represent that light in his hand in the new church age reflect in his life the Mana and only the man that's perfectly overcome the man that really sits down and throws aside everything else besides the word and the word is that Mana oh my it's Jesus man shall live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God that's the hidden manner for the Overcomer oh that was laid up each each for each priesthood of following him the schools of theology long ago has swapped this blessed thing for a a mess of pottage exactly right yes sir like Esau did now Esau morally was a better man than Jacob but he didn't have respects to his birth rights which was the word how many knows that the birth Rights was the word the promise the Elder son but he was a good man moral man like the like the nominal Christian today a good man he didn't lie didn't steal he was good to his daddy he done all these things but you see his birth rights he said he didn't care about that what difference does that make I'm a Israelite anyhow see I I belong to it anyhow but it was his birth rights County see his natural was all right but his spiritual was all wrong so is it today the pottage mixed church and world together some of each one Bingo parties Dances all kinds of carrying on in the church shired women wearing shorts we say brother BR what's that little thing that's one of the words where the Bible said it it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair right if she does how she going to get in see just and preacher her tell you the word says that see she dishonors her head she dishonors her husband she should be divorced exactly right for she that will cut her hair there also be Shor off shaven if she wants to do that not with just Bob God don't want it that way that's that Myst in between don't fool with it either cut it all off or leave it grow that's what God Said any Minister the gospel knows that's the truth whether you understand it or not but that's the truth oh what good if you go do all the rest of it leave that go what this just a little bit of world of style into you trying to act just a little bit like the other churches that's exactly where Israel got in trouble that's where they died that's where Adam got in trouble that's where all the rest of them got in trouble just one word all what it Tak just one point pottage mixed with the world some of the world some of Hollywood some of the church some of the theologians and what you got notice if Satan fails here then he'll try a second scheme on getting you to to disbelieve the word and go to the sary of try the next scheme now here's where you want to be real careful and just set this for another five minutes on this part if you will then he makes you a supernatural offer I'm going to come back to all this just before closing he make see he can't tempt you away from the word you know I'm going to stay with the word then he'll give you a supernatural offering he said I tell you what you get up here and dive off the temple bring back up see show the people that you can do something Supernatural boy he got them there now watch this is watch when you get to the end where this temptation come maybe he might let some of you speak in tongue think you got it see or he might even let you prophesy though it not be with the word I see people stand up and prophesy with contr to the word is the East is and the West see it's the word that you live by them Supernatural gifts Satan can just hand him out the handful that don't mean one thing didn't Jesus say many will come to me in that day and say Lord have I prophesied in your name in your name I've cast out devil I've done Mighty works I've been a great man in the organization I've done all these things these things you say depart from me you that work iniquity what is Iniquity is something that you know that's right and you conceive it won't do it in your heart when you know that that Bible teaches a certain thing you won't do it that's iniquity and David said if I hide iniquity in my heart God will not even hear my pray is that truth is that the Bible now surely you couldn't get angry at that see Jesus said that many will come to me in that day and saying I've done all these things and I say depart you workers of iniquity same as did Adam Adam said Lord I did this I did that but one word one word did it that's all it takes this disobey one word this may be prophesied contrary to the word but now time he's got this Supernatural gift he's so carried away by The Noise by the glamour of it glory to God I prayed for so and so they got up and walked away Hallelujah I can speak in Tong and somebody interpret it's genuine the truth Paul said I can speak in tongue like man and angels and yet be nothing I can have faith to move mountains and still I'm nothing is that right but see he'll offer you that old Pentecostal people I love you I wouldn't be with you there's where you f what's the word not the gift what's the giver see where see where it comes from he's all carried away he's dancing in the spirit boy only thing he's got so many people around him everybody calling for him here and there he forgets the word or you're a very popper as long as you stay away from that word but you getting that word one time watch he's going to cooperate with you watch what comes out then we're going to get through this in another stage of nature in a moment see watch you who wants you then nobody does oh hands off for that like a certain Association gathered together here a few weeks ago and Bandon me any Ministry that come to the city Full Gospel would have me at the city to pray for their sick would be completely excommunicated from the association all right CL a pray for this all right don't hear it say and there's the word Vindicated that's the same thing theyve done with our Lord that's the same thing they done with every man in every age that's what they done with Luther Wesley and all that's what they done with you in the beginning now he turn right back to the same water you come out of notice way it's always been the same way it's never failed Satan does the same thing now he's so carried away by the noise of Glamour and so forth now he don't even pay attention to the word oh brother brother so and so said so and so and I got to go over here see he's just so carried away he don't even notice it whether it's word or not word don't make any the rest of me said it's all right so I make any difference thein says boy you got it don't you let nobody tell you you got one see notice Satan ever had even then watching this one place here he quoted the word even on this Supernatural tried to get Jesus to do the supernatural see being had Supernatural what if Jesus would have listened to him see he said now wait you want to stay with the word do you you want to stay with the word said it's written to give his Angel's charge concerning this time Dash foot against Stone to BU up but he wasn't dashing his foot against those Stone see watch what if he would have stayed with it he do you know I never said he quoted the word he quoted quoted it like putting icing on a cage covered it over whitewashed it it wasn't its right place that's what they try to say today trying to whitewash it but you can't make it R with the rest of scripture it's got to be Everything Jesus Christ is name yesterday today and forever no matter how much words you try to quote that don't make it's got to be quoted just the way he said that if it's quoted right he Vindicated to be so in your life that's how all men know you're written Epistles read of God written Epistles is Bible is that right epistle is a Bible and you're written bible reflecting his word that perfect man again in God but Jesus said it is written also but notice Eve at this same stage Carried Away by her Supernatural I know we want to keep going I know I do but was that plain okay w how can we as Believers okay what our desire is is to be able to listen to this message and to look out and see it you know what I mean preceive it so what did he what what is the prophet of God telling us and and if we go on we know that God moved up through every age didn't he he said when he said when uh he said you Pentecostals you didn't pay no attention to the Methodist in other words when the spirit fell the restoration of gift cames you moved on from that right and then he said now the Methodist they didn't play pay any attention to the Lutheran when sanctification came they moved on from that okay they kept going they kept moving don't don't stop there so then he's he throws in here he's talking about a journey isn't he I I want you to look at what he's saying I mean I just played it but you you you've got to you've got to keep your life in a position where you can hear the word amen where every time the gospel's preached you don't fall into this conviction cuz you're so uh tied up in the world that every word of God becomes condemnation condemnation condemnation you're always wanting to wash your life and clean your life well you're going to wash the pain off the car you know you we we you we've got to move so that's why we want to keep our lives right is so that we can hear what he's saying so he's talking to the church he's telling him he's saying every time you start to move up Satan's got a trick he's got a battle if he can't use one scheme on you right if he can't say the days of Miracles has passed and and this he's got another one and it what is it it's the supernatural he'll use the supernatural the handing out of gifts the handing out of prophecies the the inspiration of emotion to do what to keep you from seeing the bread of the word and saying you've got it now it's happening I it's not happening because I said it's happening it's happening because God's Prophet said it was happening God's wanting to bring the church farther he's Wan him to get him the perfect union with the word of God and Satan says oh they can't get there let let me give them the supernatural let me give them power let me let let me let let let them start speaking in tongues and prophesying and and running and rejoicing and and saying we prayed for this person and they got well and we prayed for that person and and they got well and how did the prophet sum it up it doesn't mean a thing right and there's people all over this message flocking to it you know why they're flocking to it because they've abandoned the voice of God hallelujah they won't even play it in their churches because it'll condemn them right where they're standing oh if you don't know the truth you can't determine a lie that's right you can't you can't can't recognize deception so how can you a kingdom can't be divided against itself Paul's saying don't measure it by prophecy by tongues it'll fail that's right it's not what's perfect but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part will be done away let's just take a quick moment because that's what this church should be interested in and I don't mean Christian Life I mean this age they should be interested in the perfect bread word of God which is the Holy Spirit so the scripture plainly tells us it says he says but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away let's just follow that for a quick moment could you bear with me for a moment cuz I I want you to know my position I I want you to know I'm not against anything I'm only for what God's got for his church and I I don't want anything I don't want to be distracted by anything I don't want to be distracted by his church I don't want to distracted as someone coming up and saying oh where are all the Miracles some people couldn't see a miracle if it happened right in front of them the only Miracle they can see is Divine Healing which is the what least that isn't a great move of God that was taken care of at Calvary that just takes Faith by his stripes are healed it's already a completed work you're just accepting something that God's already done uhhuh uhhuh really Divine Healing is accepting the truth of the Gospel which was left out of the CH church but it's really accepting the past you understand what I'm saying it's accepting what Jesus did it's accepting the works that he did it's accepting the past that it is true but he's talking about something that's to come yeah he he's he's he's saying he's he's saying here in prophesying but then but then when this happens then I'll know so let's just go through it I I don't want to get I'm inspired but I I want to make it plain so when you get questioned and when they kind of lay it on you like they've got something you don't they've got a little whoop-de-doo that you don't have you know they got a little shiver and they want to know where your shiver and quiver is you stand there and say that scripture says that they put their finger in the nose of them that claimed to the apostles and were not and said you're not saying what the prophet said we're not built on a move we're built on the word of God the message of the hour that's what settles it the spirit is free to move but in every single one of those movements there's always two or three or four people that got to be lit on fire first they're the little leaders of the movement same people jump same people to the altar same people speaking in tongues and then everybody else is sitting around observing woo God's with us because nobody's pressing nobody's pressing everybody's waiting for the ministry to bring it to them everybody's waiting for a a message that stimulates you well I'm going to tell you something plain and simple the food is stored up on the tapes That's Where It's At that's where it is for this age that's where God chose to put it it's not historical word it's Eternal Word it doesn't make matter that he left the scene the truth of the Revelation was eternal bottom line and when anybody comes along and tries to express that we've got it in our church it's happening here come on move on over and and I sit back and I say yes there's two things going to happen you'll lose your voice and you'll gain 100 lb what happened to the church what's happened to us when do we start measuring things by emotions when do we start shrinking back from the truth I'm not ashamed of this message cuz it's the power of God salvation it's what gets me through it's what will carry me to the end all those things are fine great wonderful Hallelujah but man does not live hallu by bread alone he don't live by that he lives by every word of God every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God who was the mouth of God God to this generation under the angel of Lady oia write these things sayith the Lord I am the beginning I am the first and the last what did he say oh what was the problem we just heard him say it the church just decide to compare themselves and get a little worldly just get like all the other people all the other music that they play all this other stuff try to be like everybody else try to compare and conform get our ideas you know how many people have come to me and asked me to get a drum set cuz some other church has got a drum set if you want a drum set go there I watched a lot of services I listen to a lot of tapes and I looked at B to the Tabernacle there was no drum set I I'm happy to go back to the piano and organ personally but I like to see young people worshiping god with the instruments and the strings and everything but since when are we trying to be like anybody else why don't we be above amen and Beyond amen Paul said you're fools to compare yourselves one with another and it goes on all the time what are we to compare with the word the word the word show it to me in the word well let's just talk about perfection for a few moments I love this messag amen I may not always be to live it but I love what he said and I believe it's true and I believe he's just what he said in this this message it's given to the Overcomer to hear it doesn't need no explanation or interpretation it speaks for itself but let's just look look at justification we know the seed went into the ground right what was the original experience at Pentecost went into the ground what they really possessed what did they come out of the room possessing it wasn't possessing gifts though they had them and I believe in them in order and in place they're wonderful they're not motivated by music they're motivated by prayer and fasting and being alone with God and being caught up into the spirit where the spirit itself maketh intercession for you amen that's what it's about about getting in your closet and getting alone with God and God speaking to you and God prophesying to you and the spirit making intercession and you coming out Victorious amen knowing that God spoke to you you don't wait for that certain sounding up let's rise up it's a rock [Music] concert oh but we like it I don't care if you like it like it's fine I've went and watched the Gaithers and just loved them I've seen Dy Rambo when she dressed right bring tears to my eyes when she's saying God walks the dark Hills they even make fun about it how they used to have their long hair it's all it used to be I don't want to go back hear me this morning I don't want to go back I don't want to go back to Pentecost that's right that's right I want that which is perfect amen am can you follow with me for a moment justification came up right so where was the church it was lighting candles it was doing penants for sins I've seen it with my own eyes people walking for my miles crawling for miles on their knees saying a rosary doing penants for sins that have already been forgiven if you can do one thing for your salvation Jesus Christ died in vain so the first thing that God had to give the church was justification they're not going to move farther they're not going to go forward until they totally understand they're Justified to take the next step that you can freely take the next step though you're a sinner so he brought justification and justification the Perfection of justification justification is not just just the fact that he died for you that is a historical fact it's not just knowing or the knowledge of that your sins are forgiven that's right that's not the Perfection of justification that's not what was perfect in justification wasn't the fact that he died for your sins that's true it wasn't the fact that your sins were forgiven that's true you could know he died and know your sins were forgiven and still be miserable still bearing the burden of what you did that was not the Perfection of justification the Perfection of justification was the deliverance from the guilt that's what made justification perfect is you didn't have the guilt of it anymore you weren't carrying it anymore it wasn't a part of your thinking you've accepted the fact that it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness it can be in the sea of your forgetfulness amen amen it was the freedom from the shame being ashamed because people knew what you did you think after that woman got done washing Jesus's feet and he says daughter your sins which are many are all forgiven go and sin no more you think she cared what anybody thought she was free from the guilt she was free from the shame she was justified it was as if she never did it in the first place that's the Perfection of justification people believe in justification but they've never got that which is perfect so when justification came they could have said when that which is perfect is come you'll feel no shame you'll feel no guilt and you'll have no desire to continue in sin that was a just perfection of justification it wasn't the knowledge of justification it wasn't the work of justification it was the benefit of what he did on Calvary that was the Perfection that he could give that to the believer now I'm going to say this I I've been in this church a lot of times there's a lot of people in here who believe the message and still have not accepted justification they're still wallering in guilt they're still wallering in shame they just can't accept the fact that their sin is not equivalent to the power of his blood can't accept it they're so steep in self-pity guilt and shame that they they can't move to the next step from justification the once you receive the Perfection of justification just like the wheat comes up into the the little Sprout and the stock there's a natural next step right that's right because the life is moving so the natural Next Step we know is sanctification so so there if there's a Perfection to justification there's a Perfection to sanctification it's the perfect work that God performed in justification it's the perfect work all that he justified he sanctifies so there there there are Perfection so sanctification is is not don't do this don't do that can'ts and cannots that was never what sanctification was that was not the Perfection of sanctification we're Sanctified we don't drink coffee throw that machine out Matthew I'm going to sanctify you you you know what I'm saying it wasn't oh you got to wear long sleeves they were missing the Perfection of it it became we do this we do that we don't do this we don't do that that was never the Perfection of sanctification Paul said all things are expedient for me all things are lawful for me but all things aren't expedient so what was sanctification and the Perfection of San sanctification the the S the Perfection of sanctification is the demonstration of what being free from sin means amen how many heard brother BR use the word reflection this morning over and over again he said it reflects it's a reflection sanctification is a reflection that I'm free from this I don't have desire to do these things a person that's been Justified sanctification is the natural thing that follows it's the result of being free from sin but now it becomes an awareness that I've I've got to keep myself Sanctified CU I'm a written epistle read of all men I've got to make my testimony clear I got to set myself aside for service I've got to be washed I've got to make sure there's nothing in my life I got to avoid the appearance of evil that's a Perfection of sanctification that that's the beauty of it it reflects the deliverance from the desire of sin you can't say I don't desire to smoke but I smoke right I you know uh you know I used to really be in love with the Cowboys but I don't love them no more I go to their games but I I don't love them well I how how do I know that sanctification justification is something that's unseen that takes place in your heart sanctification is the evidence and the reflection that something has you just get away from it how can two walk together unless they agree sanctification is the refusal to walk with anything that's not perfect with the word of God that's what sanctification isise Lord I don't do that it doesn't mean you're not kind it doesn't mean you're not thoughtful it doesn't mean you don't go the extra mile if you are Sanctified you do go the extra mile you do give your coat those basic Christian principles are the basis of justification and sanctification if you have those two things you do those things it that's a Perfection of it there's a Perfection that's beyond knowledge the prophet of God Called It life it's a life an event takes place in your life you come under a conviction the spirit convicts you of sin you feel guilt and shame he comes and he reveals to you I've died for that I've paid the price for that go and sin no more you step up Justified you don't walk in justification that's an inner work you walk in sanctification because the minute you get up there you've separated yourself from the world you separated yourself from the things of the world the love of God which you received when he gave you repentance it's not your love it's his love it's never been an object of Your Love it's not your love of God it's God's love of you and he expressed that love to you by dying on the cross and then sending you justification and when you receive that and you really repented and you don't want to do those things no more you desire to be a new person you get up from there and now you are going to walk in sanctification amen and what do you do you repent and you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and you start walking and then he fills you with his Spirit we refer to it as the baptism of the Holy Spirit some people refer to is be being borned again but when you're truly Justified you're born again you're a new creature in Christ Jesus but then he promised you a comforter I will not leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you to the end and the spirit will come and lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness he promised you that spirit that would lead and guide you into all righteousness so the per so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not just the res restoration of gifts it's more than that gifts is not the Perfection of the baptism of the Holy Spirit the Perfection of the baptism of the holy spirit is a Godly continence and a Godly atmosphere the Perfection if I could put it this way is a and Gifts was given because it it lets you know that the spirit is real and Powerful but that wasn't a Perfection of it so Paul comes along and says that'll be done away with you'll you're only doing that in part that's just a taste of what God's got coming oh he's just saying don't stop there keep pressing in don't be lured away cuz Satan's trying to offer the supernatural oh we're Supernatural Supernatural when you had none other than the presence of the son of man in our generation none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself come down and Veil himself in the ministry of the prophet and do the same works that he did 2,000 years ago when he was on Earth healing the blind raising the dead casting out cancers delivering talking to the people behind the his back and the tent exactly what he did when he appeared to Abraham Discerning them exactly what he did when he was talking to the woman at the well I don't want to exchange why God did that and the Perfection that was to follow that demonstration of the son of man for what the prophet called a bowl of pottage and I know the argument well we can do both we can have this in that too you want to know how many quotes I can get you where the prophet of God talks about he said one word one word I can cut my hair and still speak and T one word that's why the rain falls on the what the just and the unjust that's why many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord didn't I know you I'm not angry Church okay but when I see spirits trying to take the children of the Living God the seed word children of this message and trying to feed them something other when the than what the messenger of the hour taught it stirs me up and it's fine if you leave it out there but when you bring it in here and start accusing me of not believing in the move of the spirit you start saying that this congregation doesn't in believe that you might get some discernment that they really don't want God's word don't need interpretation he stands on it himself it's totally exposed but you know why they don't hear it they don't listen to it it's great I've been to concerts where I tell you I could have I could have jumped out of the top balcony and flown down to the stage you ever been to any of those M where it's just it's so in spiring man you're just you're you're shaken yes I've been to sporting events where I've chewed my fingers off to my Knuckles just in anticipation what's going to happen I never could figure out why people like scary movies and go watch something that's scary them to death and I thought they're actors nobody's getting killed there's no ghosts there's no secret people sitting behind closets it's all in your head well isn't that where the battle is anywhere why can't we move it out of our head into reality so let's go on will you bear with me I like how brother Ram says I'm going to say something that hurts will you still love me raise your hand everybody and let me know you're going to still love me you know what I mean I tell you ho ho ho ho but you know what he was telling them charity amen yes hope faith and charity but but all these is love are you going to still love me amen so list what he said what is the Perfection of the Holy Spirit what was the promise I will not leave you nor forsake you but I will come again and be with you even in you that was the promise of the Holy Ghost that's right when they came out of the upper room they were just fulfilling a prophecy of Joel that told him when this came this would happen but they did that wasn't the Perfection of it the Perfection was now they had the spirit of Truth the presence of the Lord Jesus the indwelling spirit that was going to lead them and guide them in all righteousness guide them lead them the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord and that that Spirit would convict them of sin so when they started unbelieving the word of God they'd be convicted we've got communion tonight that'll be a short service so the the Perfection is is the ever presence of the indwelling spirit not on you but in you it can fall on anybody it can only be in the elect he said I always I'll never leave you nor forsake you the the the Perfection of the spirit is a conscious reality of his presence now don't stop there cuz let's read go back in closing here and I'm I'm just going to leave this a little short of of everything that could be said in the 12th verse he says and we're talking about this Perfection but when that which is perfect is come and my question question is what is that which is perfect now I know most people say the Bible now if you were maybe raised in the fundamental Evangelical place they feel what when the King James Bible was printed the word was assembled by God that's which is perfect true the word of God is perfect but the letter kth and the spirit gives it life so we know that there's something that is perfect that is to come now this is Paul goes on to make this statement and I hope I can tie this together and you'll be bear with me he says for now we see through a glass darkling but then face to to face in other words face to face means person to person in fact that's even how the gospel really was to be spread not through radio not through television but face to face from Revelation to Revelation somebody getting saved Born Again delivered the love of God moving in their heart going to their friend go just like Phillip and Nathaniel and mve in you to move not just bringing them to church and letting the church do it the preacher do it but you do it saying friend the way you're living you're going to go to hell sister might say sister you can't you can't be doing that a real genuine Love in Your Heart charity amen greater than all things the Capstone what happened to the Capstone the Capstone so he says he says now this is the beginning of what is the Perfection that we're going to come to so I want to make it unequivocally plain the gifts the prophecy the emotion the dancing in the spirit everything that brother brandom distinctively covered in that is not the Perfection we can do those things if God so permits but let's not take that in a substitute right for the Perfection that he's offering us so let's just close in these thoughts he says but then face to face now I know in part so he says all these things I just have a glimpse of I have Parts pieces right right we read the Bible and they came up with this piece that piece different people would take different people pieces and put them together and make different pies Baptist pie Presbyterian pie pie pie pieces the prophet God said they were all glimpsing at the truth they were getting glimpses of it they were getting pieces of it and they would take the pieces that they had have and they would put him together and they were doing God a service without it being his will now he's not preaching these messages to the church he's preaching the message to the church because he wants them to know there's a Perfection lying ahead and he doesn't want them to stop along the journey and set up camp am I clear all quiet in here have I have any friends left I could have them put the baskets out there and you could take your tis and offerings back as you go out the door he doesn't want them to stop he doesn't he wants you to know there's going to be many that come and and say Lo he is here and lo he is there we don't want to stop so let's let's just go he says here he says he says I know in part but what happened all these pieces were up there and then the mighty angel came he put his foot on the land and the Sea and he had a book is that right and our names were written in that book that's right cuz it was the Lamb's Book of Life right and that book was sealed with Seven Seals right and we know it it it was on the book and without going into the seals but we know that there was four satanic horse riters that went out and tried to seal these Mysteries away away from the church and there were four beasts that God sent to keep it alive then at the end the mighty Angel Hallelujah John saw him coming down and he was taking the book and John was going to write and he he told them don't write but as it is in the days of the voice of the seventh angel then these things would be opened up and the Mysteries would be named on that's right so now it's not going to be in part but the first evidence of what the Perfection is that God is to give is for you to be known as you were known you understand that let me let me just read a statement to so I can just uh it's paragraph 60 I believe in invisible union now as you were know this is the first step and then I know in part but then I will know as I was known when did he know me how do he know me where was I at where were you when the the the angels in the Earth where were you when the the sons of God shouted for joy where were you you know what I can say I was there now you're going to know as you were known and so were you I'll just read the paragraph before any son will put daughter also is an attribute of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the bedding ground of mother you were brought forth into the Earth and became in the image of your father then he could have fellowship with you now he's telling you how you were known so so were you sons of and Daughters of God before there even was a moon a star or a molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attribute that was in God at the beginning oh Hallelujah now I'm being known as I was known this is how God knew me this is when God knew me this is where I was before the foundation of the world I I've known all this other in part but when that which is perfect has come all the pieces will be done away with and I will know even as I'm known oh Lord you mean you knew me where back then you allowed me to go through all this sin I needed you to display my attributes I needed you to show I was a forgiver I needed you to show I was a deliverer I needed you to show all these things there was a whole side of me nobody had ever known but I've let you come down so you could be my attributes you could be the Deliverance you could be the healing you could be the Salvation oh praise God listen the manifestation of the attribute that God was at the beginning for there is only one form of eternal life and that was you glory you want to substitute that for a little dance rise [Applause] up walk in the the power of Life walk in the spirit walk in the wordu Hallelujah that was you before now I'm being known as I was known that was me that was me that was me always had eternal life why do I want a little piece of pie when God's giv me the whole [Music] Bakery how could this Prophet write these things where was he living am that's somebody that walked so close with God he could be mistaken for God remember he said they were a lot closer than most everybody else Len from of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your Earthly father you didn't know but when that which is perfect this come you will know amen oh I think we we get in that other church we'll have a Jericho March amen you but you are manifested to his anybody read it image Hallelujah now we're talking about the Perfection that's right not a move of the spirit but now we're talking about being conformed in to his image in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory and The Fellowship Of God I could just go into book that book right now the Perfection is the union of husband and wife hallelu that these two shall be one so what Satan do he doesn't want that Perfection he doesn't want that Unity so he's going to offer you Supernatural okay you want to settle the question whether you're one with God just speak in tongues just prophesy just jump up just shout and what did the brother Bram just say and you say you've got it oh I'll tell you Church you don't know what it's like when you're standing in the anointing of his word you're not afraid of nobody Hallelujah you're not afraid of Goliath you're not afraid of their philosophies you're not afraid of their internet you're not a thing I challenge you to stand here on the word of [Applause] God young people I want you to know better amen amen camps are great but that ain't the Perfection you're seeking that ain't the blessing we're seeking and I didn't try to present this as a personal thing I try to take these the very quotes and lay it out exactly the way he laid it out let's don't let anything if you speak a tongues praise God that's fine I would that ye all spoke in tongues as I did prophesy prophesy is wonderful prophesying is not edification yay the Lord shall be upon you yay ye all should be blessed yay God loves you yay the spirit is mighty upon you today all ye people yay go forth in the power and demonstration of the spirit yay Church fear not anybody ever here been in Pentecost since when are we all caught up into somebody speaking words over us prop God I've seen him Pro prophesy and be so far from the word of God is it as East or West now people are on oh brother spoke this word over me brother spoke this word over me that's great but I had the seventh Church age Angel Hallelujah I had Elijah speak the word over me I had Malachi 4:5 speak the word over me I had the angel of the Covenant speak the word over me what why are we headed that way why we want to go that route amen when there's a storehouse in heaven full of the bread bread is meant to be fed on am amen thank you Lord not to say I've eaten enough bread now I can do this and do that and do this and do that he explains that exactly in here what's taking place and I'm obligated and that's what he said when you start staying with the word that's when you're not very [Music] popular but I'm obligated to You by my Divine calling and the office that God placed in me to tell you what William Maryam branam Malachi 45 the angel of Revelations 10:7 the angel of Revelations 3:14 [Music] said and just what our messenger says he says it's no longer on me it's on you the first step it's the union it's the uniting time when the bride and the bridegroom become one when you and the word become the same thing amen Jesus did a lot of Works besides miracles I could imagine him walking down a road can't you times are tough and he looks over to the house and he sees a couple kids playing in the yard and he sees the dad over there trying to make pots and he looks out there in their field is a little dry and they don't have much and he just comes by raises his hand and that Garden flourishes it grows wherever he went Hallelujah something good happened do you understand that could be you that you could create such an atmosphere that you controlled every situation what is a Perfection clever you become a Mystic to the world you walk in a world alone it's you and God you're walking there you're living by the word you become one with the word you don't need no sign to demonstrate you are the power you know that you were with him in the beginning you know you have eternal life and you always have eternal life you know I come from God and I go to God it's settled and we haven't even scratched the surface this morning so choose this day who you'll serve choose this day the Perfection you want to run off but I think it's a lot of of people are barking up the wrong tree God bless you this morning we turn to service to brother [Applause] Billy amen let's all stand this
