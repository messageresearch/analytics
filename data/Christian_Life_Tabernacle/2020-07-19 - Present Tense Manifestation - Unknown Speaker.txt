Description:
Br. David McGeary Sr.
Service: July 19,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

we rest in you for you promised that nothing could pluck us out of the palm of your hand and although our hearts may be torn we'll praise you this morning in this storm we'll lift your name and magnify you king of kings lord of lords we worship you this morning we ask you to bless us this morning in your word help us father for we're just flesh but you are eternal be our portion this morning we pray for we ask it in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you this morning while you're standing if you have your bibles and you'd like to turn over to uh two scriptures we'll read this morning one found in uh hebrews uh the seventh chapter and the first three verses there and then in timothy so let's read in timothy 2 timothy this morning and starting in the sixth chapter sixth chapter of second timothy and uh starting at the 13th verse and we'll just read a few scriptures there this morning amen i was told that i i don't know if i can see him out here but there they are in the back my friends from the shooting class amen amen i'm glad to have you back there lord bless you it's nice to see you may the may the lord jesus be your portion this morning may you feel his presence and may you know that he loves you and that's the most important thing so nice to have you here today amen and all our other friends and visitors let's let's read here this morning those of you that are not with us this morning our brothers and sisters that attend here that are watching us by way of the stream this morning we welcome you and though you're not here with us we believe you're present with us in the spirit so let's read he says here uh um let's start with the 12th verse here i like this scripture it's one of my favorites so fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life where until thou art also called and hath professed a good profession before many witnesses did i say ii timothy i'm sorry first timothy 1 and 6. first timothy one and six okay so let's go have you found that there okay so you all thought your bible was different than mine huh all right i know you've got used to me so anyway it's always safe as we read again fight the good fight of faith they hold on eternal life we're unto doubt are also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses i give the charge in the sight of god who quickeneth all things and be before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep his commandments without spot unrebukable unto the appearing of our lord jesus christ which in his time he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings the lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelleth in light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honored and power everlasting amen and then let's turn over to hebrews 7 and read the first three verses here of hebrews the seventh chapter he says for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who meant abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gaveth a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life but maiden like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated this morning and um we're just going to uh have a little kind of a bible type study this morning and as we we told you last week we talked a little bit about uh that we were going to minister on the subject present tense manifestation present tense manifestation and we challenged you all to maybe think of that in your mind a little bit of what it might be or what that you might think is a present tense manifestation and so we want to continue on our our subject that we've been uh talking about and ministering about about uh this present tense manifestation now a present tense of course we understand what present means but the definition of present tense is expressing an action that is currently going on an expression of an action that's currently going on so and then it's also the state of current existence so we we want to uh uh when we talk about uh present tense in the realms that were speaking on this morning i i think that it's uh really important to understand that there's only one thing that is present tense as you sit here you are not in uh it existing believe it or not you're changing by the second you just all of you have just got older since i've stepped out here you've probably had some brain cells die since you've begin to listen you've uh you know so something has transpired in a so we do not remain the same so you can't put this in the framework of time you can't put it in the uh a framework of what we would consider present day in other words we say that now we're living in this this time we uh we know our news reports and our our radio uh everything that we talked about nowadays is talking about politics or talking about the virus talking about this talking about that and it's in such a constant turmoil and a constant flux but there is something that remains the same that's unchanging and as i was writing with leslie the other day i i just said you know i said i've noticed something if you turn off the radio and you just don't listen to nothing and everything and you just sit back and have fellowship with the spirit that's in your heart i said you find out that this is a pretty peaceful world you know we were just driving down the street and and it you know the traffic wasn't bad and we just that we're gonna go uh get something to eat and and i thought you know it it's really not bad if you shut out all the other voices if you turn off all the noise and all the all the trouble and everything and you realize this morning that you're in the the palm of his hand and that you have a promise that nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand and that he promised to give you peace that surpassed understanding okay when the storm comes you uh you know that that he he's got you he he's the anchor in the storm he's the a rock that you're built on he's the he's a part of your life he's somebody that that you've meant and that you know personally he's not just in the pages of of a book and and though you can learn of him from that but it's somebody that you know that is real to you and you know that he loves you and you can look in your life and and i i love that song i've been redeemed kister laura saying that for us i thought the the part of that song that just got me so much is that you know i i was shackled i was shackled i was bound by the things that i did i was bound by the things that i said the very actions there and the sin that was in my life it had rule over me okay and so no matter what that i did these things became a part of the personality and the nature that i had you know that's one of the greatest things people don't realize about sin and about doing things and treating people wrong it leaves a scar on you it puts a kink in in the hose and it doesn't allow your life to flow because that's always there working you over it's kind of like you know what you really are but one day hey hey man one day on a rooftop i meant somebody that was going to uh he was going to make a difference in our lives he was going to cause a change he was it wasn't that you could add him to your life i didn't have to add him to my life i didn't have to to just take up all that i was and then add him to my life and say now i can go on different no he did more than that he wasn't an add-on amen he was a transforming power amen he took the old man and he took that nature away and he created us a new man in him that's what was wonderful that's why we're here fellowshipping this morning you know we're we're we're not here as a organization we're not here as anything we're just a local people just come together here because we've met him we've heard his word and and our hearts are set to the purpose of living that word and so as we begin to approach this great subject of a present tense manifestation i believe it is it is so reflected in this person called melchizedek melchizedek was a present tense manifestation abraham met him when he was coming home from the slaughter of the kings and as paul described him he said who was this person he didn't have a beginning of days he didn't uh have a father or a mother scripture says that he had no descendants so he he stood on his own now this is a a very uh it is i can say it this way it it's important to us and it behooves us to understand who that this is because it's it's going to play an important part in our lives the understanding of who that this man was what was he what was it he was there in the form of a man he was standing there in flesh we've seen him again as he he meant abraham when he gave abraham the promise this great person and you know many people have different ideas of who that he is because some claim that he's a type or a myth that that's very common with great scholars of the scriptures they believe that job is not really was never really a person they believe that job was a a parable or an old jewish a tale something like rip van winkle and they also believe that jonah was also a parable it was a tale it was a something that was given as an analogy or something and that you know pretty soon if you take that approach then you you put everything into a myth so there's no real baptism of the holy spirit there's no real divine healing there's no real salvation okay he begins to say that salvation is a state of mind well i can tell you salvation is far beyond a state of mind salvation is a way of life it's a living fountain that grows up inside of you and it nourishes your mind nourishes your heart nourishes your spirit because it's something that's real it's resurrection life that god has shared with you amen he actually shares his person with you it's real it's not a myth it's a person and some believe that it's a priesthood because he came it's an order another is it's something like you join like maybe a uh uh uh the knights of columbus or the or the eternal fraternal order of uh church janitors or or something like that it's an order it's a it's a club it's a organization this mel keys adapt but it's not amen he was a person so as i read a little bit uh to us this morning and as we walk through this this morning it it if you start placing yourself in this picture this morning because we're not a mishap this morning we were created with a purpose the scripture tells us in ephesians that were his workmanship in christ jesus foreordained unto good works that we should walk in them that he's revealed to us the mystery of his will that he proposed in himself after his good pleasure so god did not make mistakes this morning in regards to you this world in this universe just didn't come out of some something bumping up there together somewhere it's it's not it's something that was created and it was created by a god that had something in his mind he he had he had in his mind what that he wanted to do he had in his mind what he was purposing he he had proposed it in himself the scripture also speaks in one place it says that after the counsel of his own will so god received if i i can't comprehend that scripture i'm sorry it's so deep but the scripture says he proposed it after the council of his will in other words it's what he willed what that he wanted to accomplish what that he wanted to achieve what that he wanted to do so you can't just sit back and be a bump on the log you just can't go about your life getting a paycheck you just can't eat up your days and think well one day i'm going to pass away no that's not why god put you here he could have bypassed all that but there was something that he was achieving something that he was bringing to pass something that was unfolding and so that's what god's always done he's a great in a form he's a he he's a evolutionist he evolves he he has to start somewhere and evolve he had to start something in order that he could be realized and understood and that's what god wants he wants to have fellowship with you he wants you to understand him he wants you to know he wants you to know him he doesn't want us looking back 2 000 years at calvary and say that was jesus and this is what he did and because he did that and i've confessed that i'm a sinner and that i confess that he's lord that someday after i die he's going to put me in heaven you've left a lot of space out you're looking back at what that he did and you're looking back to what that he's going to do but you've missed the present tense manifestation you you've walked life just you went from a to z and then you rest in that and you say all that i have to do is be good and some uh of of a viewpoint armenians and and calvinist and that one lays all their they lay all what they have on what he did at calvary and others say no i have to i have to do works and we believe in works because works is faith expressed works as a result of something that he's done for you but it goes so far beyond that and it comes to what we we realize and we see as being something that is it is present tense a present tense manifestation he says now speaking of this person so we're talking about what is present tense there's only one thing that can be present tense he says he says it can't be that the fourth verse says that he was a person a man so in order to be a person he has to be a personality a man not a order but a person so he was not just a priesthood order neither was he a myth he was a person now understand that he's a person in order to be a person he has to have a personality so we're talking about somebody who is real we're talking about someone who is present tense and why is he present tense and this person is eternal if you notice he had no father he had no mother he had no time he ever began he had no time he ever ended and and ever who it was is still alive today because the bible said here that he had neither father nor mother beginning of days or ending of life so it would have to be an eternal person an eternal person so it could only be one person and that's god because he's the only one that's eternal god so who is this eternal person he is the i am there's only one present tense and that's the i am everything else changes everything else passes no matter how healthy you are believe it or not jacqueline anybody know who jacqueline is i am old i don't even know who the new jacqueline would be but anyway he was a guy that was just super healthy and ran exercises shows and everything but guess what he had an ending of days and he had a beginning of days but this person you have to say this person was god this person was god this person had a personality he wasn't he wasn't a myth he wasn't an order we're talking about somebody who is real a real person this morning you know and he says now he was god because he's the only person that can be immortal and god changed himself into a person god changing himself into a person now remember when god existed he was just the great i am he was the self-existing one there there was there was nothing that existed but him and so now this god in himself he he had attributes so we understand that god so i it's hard for us to comprehend but that's why that we're made in the image and likeness of god because we are made a person with a personality so god before that was just the self-existing one he like he said that timothy said you couldn't behold his glory you couldn't see him no man have seen them no man could come into that light or into that presence it look it it was it was so mighty and so powerful that the absolutely nothing could even fellowship with it or see it or comprehend it but so god in his great love for us he became something that could be loved and could be fellowshipped with he became a person so i don't know what he was before all i can say he was elohim the self-existing one there okay there i don't know what was there i don't know if he created worlds before i don't know how long time is i only know my little 70 years and i don't remember most of it but this god became a person now that's important to us as we unfold this this morning that he became a person he became something that he could express himself he took on he took on a form he became a person and so and you can't be a person without a personality so god has a personality you notice that you have a personality all of us are different we can be raised in the same home by the same parents eat the same food go to the same school go to the same church sleep in the same bedroom wear the same clothes but yet each one of us comes out different each one of us has a personality that personality is because god created you to have a personality because he had a purpose in you having a personality because he was a personality he became a person and in this great person of god there were attributes we understand that he was inaccurate he had attributes he had things that he was this personality is you notice some people are kind that's an attribute some people are ornery that's an attribute some people you just love to be around other people you step across the street they call you on the phone and the first thing you look at is is the caller id you know i i didn't have caller id for a long long time i'd have to say hello and it was hello oh no you know what i mean and people would start in and you couldn't get a word in edge right you didn't even know how to say uh i've got to go you would tell your wife call me on the other line you know what i mean you do you do anything some people that was their personality and and i've i've met people like that but i just couldn't hardly be around but when i took a little time to get to know them and i took a little time to to stand in their shoes and express a little brotherly kindness and and try to look at them and figure out why they're this way and then you you make contact with something in them that you know it's really not as bad as you think and then you begin to learn to enjoy them and you can go out to coffee with them you know and and finally you know your conscience is bothering you because of all the bad thoughts you had for him for so long you know what i mean and then finally that one day you're over the cup of coffee and you'll say brother you know what uh i hate to say this but there was a time i really couldn't stand you but uh you know i've i've come to know you and and i've come to see that you really love the lord and that you're really trying to do your best and and and and i'm glad you know so you know that's why we draw a bigger circle you know what i mean if you don't don't be so quick to judge don't be so quick to point a finger that's selfishness that that's all it is you just want to protect your little world you don't want to have to give of yourself but you know sometimes if you run across especially you teenagers and you people that are in school you know i i i was elected freshman class president don't i don't know why but uh they elected me freshman class president and i i just remembered the thing i always used to love i was popular in school not because the teachers like me i think i was popular because all the teachers wanted to throw me out so all the kids they like that you know so i was kind of a rebel type of fella and all the kids like me but i just remembered i always like to take what everybody thought was a nerd i think that's a term right it wasn't in my day we had another term for it you know what i mean and so we had these but i would like to go hang out with those guys and you know my whole goal was is if you know if you hung out with them long enough they would become popular you know what i mean all of a sudden the whole thing would change you know and you can change things for people you can make a difference in people's lives if you see someone at school that everybody makes fun of you be the first one to stand up you gotta understand there's a soul in there there's a personality in there there's somebody in there might be hurting there's somebody in there there might be somebody in there that god wants to manifest himself through so so don't ever get caught up in in this popularity thing at school don't ever get caught up in exciting at work you stay away from the gossip stay away from things you stand there with the love of god in your heart and you reach out to the kids around you you reach out to the people at school the things that aren't the people that aren't so popular they become a christian get bored again they're popular amen they may not be popular with this world but they're popular with the host of heaven they're popular with angels and and saints and and believers around the world so so never get like that so we're talking about this personality and god that god formed himself into a a person and he created us to be persons so these personalities could now contact one another so god made you so you could contact him and he made himself into something that he could contact you with so this so god created this because he wanted to fulfill this purpose we are not rats in a maze seeing if we can get through the maze of life and get out on the other side and and say we made it oh no oh no that's not where this is at hallelujah this is much more beautiful than that it is a much greater relationship than that this is more wonderful than that to think the wonderfulness of that god made you a person that he made himself a person so you too could come in contact with one another god wanted to make contact he wanted to express himself he wanted to express everything that he was so and so and that's why the you can never know god outside of revelation they asked jesus who do men say that i am he says some say you're this and some say you're one of the prophets some say you're john turned from the dead sometimes say you're elias he said but who do you say that i am and peter said thou art art the christ the son of the living god and he looked at him and said peter flesh and blood hath not revealed this to you in other words no flesh showed you this but my father which in heaven has revealed this to you and he said to him he says thou art peter upon this rock i'll build my church now i was raised the catholic we always thought the church was built on peter that's weird and then you know when i when i talked with my protestant friends they said the church was built on jesus christ well it wouldn't do you no good to build it on jesus christ if you didn't have a revelation of who that he was so the church is built on the revelation of the word of god that's where the church is built on god in heaven not man not flesh and blood not organization not denomination not human teachers but the church is built on god the person almighty father revealing to you who that he is that's a relationship this is not a lodge it's not a human fellowship it's not an organization it's not a social event you are here this morning and i hope you've come to sit and hear the word of god and have god give you a personal revelation in your life of whether you're right with him whether you understand him whether you've been injected with humanism but that when you walk out in your own personal life you've made contact with somebody that you can talk to and can talk back to you god doesn't believe in one-sided relationships and he doesn't want you to do all the talking hear ye him he wants you to listen he wants to reveal things to you he wants to enlighten you he wants to increase your understanding you say when will it stop it'll never stop it'll take eternity for him to reveal himself what a fellowship so we understand that god in becoming a person he was starting to change his form god changed himself into a person so god was he he became if we wanted to use a word of changing himself the terminology for that is e morphe the means to change and so we see that god changed himself and and so it came from the greek word emorphy comes from changing characters and it was like in a play like you would have a play and and so in this play you might have one person in this play play three or four parts okay knock i think you're going to start picking up on where i'm headed so this person in one scene he would run and he would change into a villain and he would come out in that act of that play as the villain and he's playing the part of the villain but yet he's still the same person and then he would run back and he would change his costume and maybe he would come out and play another part so it's the same person playing different roles he was playing different uh taking a different place and so we might ask ourselves this person what was the his present state of manifestation so this person now was manifesting himself as one act so you would look at that and say oh now he's manifested as a villain so you would say that's his present state of manifestation that's the part he's playing but and again the part changed but the person never changed the person remained the same it was the same person all the time not three persons so there's not god the father as one person and then god the son as a person and god the holy ghost as a person it's not three persons making up one god three personalities in order to have a personality or to be a person you have to have a personality so okay so they begin to express and they say well there's three gods and that's what i raised you knew i was raised a catholic before my conversion i studied in the pre-seminary program considering to be a priest and so i studied that out i understood what they felt they believed it took three persons just three completely separate persons and these three persons in some unity together made up what god is but god is the self same person the present state tense manifestation of god is i am the i am not the we are or the we will be or the we was but the present tense manifestation of god is i am i am the lord thy god thou shalt have no other gods besides me not a first person god not a second person god not a third person god the word of god commands us to worship that one person glory why is that so important to us because we begin to understand what it means to have a present tense manifestation not a future tense hope one day not looking back at what was but realizing that there is a present tense manifestation another understand the present tense is that person he's the only one that's present tense he's the only one that doesn't change he's the only one that remains the same he this person this god this one that changed himself into a person this god is the only thing that is present tense the only one nothing else is present tense because present tense is eternal and there's only one being that's eternal and that's why if you weren't part of that eternal being in the beginning if you weren't a part of him in your thing in his thinking if he didn't know you before you came here if he didn't create you if he didn't have you in his mind you'll never be there but if you're a part of him and a part of what he's manifesting and you're part of that present tense then you have eternal life so let's just unfold this for just a few moments and we'll close he said he says so this this character in the greek word means a forfeit which means changing his mask and that's what god did it's the same god all the time god in the form of the father the spirit the pillar of fire the same god made flesh and dwelt among us in more faith brought out so he could be seen now understand this is the purpose of god is to be seen he created adam so he could be worshiped so he created adam and he'd come down in the cool of eden in the evening and he would walk with adam and adam would have fellowship with him but all the time that god was walking with adam adam never knew god was a healer he never knew god was a deliverer he never knew god was a savior so here's god he's got a son and this son is perfect he's the first adam he's the son of god adam was the son of god echo there he was and and god had he put all that he was in adam and and there adam was but yet there's a whole part adam never knew about the father there was only one way that adam could ever know the father well god couldn't create somebody who was lost oh wow i should pray you should have jumped out of your seats you said i said pray god god couldn't create somebody who was lost not if he created it it's eternal now there's a he made a way for a lot of things to be created out here or not created perverted so he secured adam in himself the word he put his name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world he knew where adam would end up but he allowed adam to fall not to be lost you understand not to be lost all the father hath given me will come nothing can pluck them out of the palm of my hand if i begin the work i will finish the work but he allowed adam to false so he can now show adam that he was a savior a healer a deliverer he had these attributes that he wanted to manifest now adam was able to to know that he's a father he could worship him and know that he's a savior jehovah jirei a provider and god began to let the whole thing begin to unfold he began to have different manifestations of his present tense because he's present tense but he began to put on different masks he began to show himself so that he could be seen now he could be seen as a savior he could be seen as a deliverer he could be just seen as a healer he could be seen as a provider adam could never see that part of god but god couldn't lose him so he secured him by putting his name on the lamb's book of life your name was put on that book also your name was put on that book before the foundation of the world nothing can put it on nothing can take it off he knew you he knew when you would be here the color of your eyes the color of your hair the statue that where you were in he knew you then though it might have taken a thousand years for you to get here he knew you then he knew where you come from he knew where you were going god doesn't run the kind of ship that we would run he's the author and the finisher of our faith he's alpha and omega he's the beginning and the end he's the one in self-existing i am present tense he's the only present tense he's the only i am this person melchizedek was this person in a present tense manifestation he was this person in a present tense manifestation in moses he poured his fullness in the present tense manifestation of jesus christ god always veiled himself in a personality he brought so he could be seen now that same god is the holy ghost is the father not three gods three officers three acts of the same one god they're present tense manifestations every time i say present tense you think i am you think of this person this one god person that's here he's here but he's veiled to the unbeliever satan has veiled him in denominational systems he's veiled them in religion he's kept people from seeing who he is with false doctrine withholding the word of god and unrighteousness with with putting all kinds of systems all kinds of programs and and gymnasiums and swimming pools and and social classes and all these things still there's only one way into the kingdom of god and it's not a program you must be born again you must come in contact with this present tense and this present tense must become a part of you the bible said there's one god but that's how you can't get this straight out and have three gods you would never sell the jew that tells you that one who knows better he knows there's only one god now listen to what he just said you'll never get this straightened out you'll never understand this one god manifesting himself you'll never understand what your position is in the plan of god you'll never be able to figure it out as long as you've got this idea there's three gods you miss it because you can't see yourself as being part of the word of god you can't see yourself of having eternal life if you have eternal life you've always had eternal life because you were in his thinking in the beginning you think you just got here because of your father and your mother even david said thou art my god i was cast upon thee from my mother's womb you don't think i go farther back than morton emmett and rosemary mcgeary you think that i just came through my life i can always use myself as an example and one day i just happened to come to the realization that there was a god he knew me when i got here he knew i was his that's what makes him a redeemer redeemer means to be brought back redeemer means to to restore back to redeem you that means you were his in the beginning my sheep know my voice another they won't follow all the father hath given me will come he knew you you were a part of him you were a part of that thinking you were a part of his mind you were there in the beginning with him your time was whatever time he put you here but he knew you would be here he's infinite all that he foreknew he predestinated all that he predestinated he justified all that he justified he sanctified all that he sanctified he came filled with his glory he glorified the beautiful plan of god unfolding in your life let's close down as we follow because this subject's bigger than i can spit out notice like a sculpture he hides a mask over it that's what god has done to this age it's been hid all these things has been hid and is supposed to be revealed in this age now the bible says that there would be revealed in the latter times it's like the sculpture keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask of off of it and there it is so understand he's kept this covered all this time and now he's going to pull the mask off of it and there it is and that's what the bible has been it's been a work of god that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and its sevenfold mysteries and god promised in the last days at the age of the lady elsia church that he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing we could see it what a glorious thing god emorphae masked in a pillar of fire gaudi morphe a man called jesus god amorphy in his church god above us god with us god in us the condensation of god god in us the present tense manifestation of god being seen in a personality your personality god be seen in your personality that's the condensation of god gotti morphe he changed into a person then he was with us now in this age he's in us god being seen in a personality whose personality your personality the personality he gave you you say who's the present tense manifestation the present tense manifestation is the present tense the i am manifested in a personality so he could be seen god always fails himself in man now the unbeliever don't see it the unbeliever looked at the lord of glory and perceived them not in fact they called him beelzebub now you would never do that because you're a believer but they looked at them and they saw a man the predestinated looked at it and they saw god that was god's plan that was going to be the tense the present tense manifestation of god is god the manifestation of this person elohim this one god this one person this one present tense remember there's only one thing that's present tense heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now where is he where is this present tense where is this present tense this present tense spirit this unchanging god what is he doing he's condensing he's coming down from god to a person then showing himself in shadows and types in the old testament then creating a body yes god created a body in the womb of mary mary was not the mother of god god did not impregnate mary seed god created both seed and germ in mary he wasn't the son of mary he was god but he had a present tense manifestation in the person of mary and he came into the world and he was tempted like we were tempted you know it's real uneasy to make jesus god because he was the fullness of the present tense person was in him he was the fleshly manifestation of the present tense god jesus had the personality of god but he did nothing until the father showed him first he did nothing amen and he finally said if you can't believe me for my words believe me for my works and even the leaders of that day said no man could do these things unless the father be with him in fact philip finally says show us the father and he say philip have i been with you so long and you know not who i am he who hath seen me has seen the father why it was the present tense manifestation of the one person god in flesh that's who this melchizedek was he was this person god taking on personality and now he takes on personality that's the relationship that the believer has it's it's god in us condescending of god up there holy no one could touch him he settled upon the mountain and even the animals touched the mountain had to die and then god came down and changed his tent and come down and lived with us become one of us and we held him the bible says first timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for god was manifested in the flesh handled with hands god eat meat god drank water god slapped god cry he was one of us beautiful typed in the bible he was at that present tense manifested in flesh oh glory that was god above us god with us now it's god in us the holy spirit not a third person the same person you say what is the present tense manifestation what is it it's that same god manifested not in a church not in a myth of doctrine or dogmas or creeds not in a study a watchtower magazine or uh uh uh the scriptures uh as maybe taught by theologians not in the intellect but the reality of that present tense manifested in your personality see you just got to be yourself it's not about us changing into something it's not about us setting us a bunch of works up to do it's not about us it's about the present tense it's about the i am it's about that being being seen in a personality that's why he made you the personality you are don't try to be different than what you are be yourself that's where he wants to manifest himself he wants to manifest in you the way that you are become one with you that's why he gave you your personality so he could be present tense because once he became a person he could only manifest himself in a person because he can't change his program else he didn't do it right the first time so he was going to do it in the church then that's what you'll end up with you'll end up with a basilica sitting on six hills of rome with a triple crown in the mark of the beast that's what you'll end up with and you'll end up with a bunch of denominational daughters which are nothing but prostitutes to the teaching that there's three gods because nobody in the bible that was ever baptized in the name of the father the name of the son in the name of the holy ghost nowhere in the scriptures peter on the day of pentecost he said men and brethren these are not drunk as you suppose but this is the present tense manifestation that joel spoke of i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh what no system they said what must we do they were pricked in their heart they said what must i do he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the present tense manifestation that's why it's there is there to blind because you can never wrap your mind around three gods because you're in eternal confusion is it jesus is it the holy spirit is it the father no there's only one present tense there's only one i am there's only one god and that god manifested himself in jesus christ so in this world as he is so shall we be herein is the love of god manifest as he is so shall we be in this world in contact and fellowship with the present tense a present tense manifestation and i'll close it's the same person god come down and became flesh and died to death in christ so he could clean the church in order to get it fit for fellowship god loves fellowship that's what he made the man in the the first time for was fellowship god dwells alone with serpents but he made man so he could reveal himself and there's so much more i could go and you understand we covered some of it last week about the great attributes of god manifesting and how each of you became part of that manifestation but we what i so want to express to you today is you're not you are called to enter into a union with the present tense that god is alive he's here this morning his presence is here he can be known he's here to do the same works he did 2 000 years ago he's the same yesterday today and forever he's present tense he's here for whatever that you have need of he's not afar off if he was afar off he would be future tents if he was back in history he would be past tense he's not future tense he's not past tense he's present tense and he wants to manifest himself in a personality maybe your personality is physically sick hallelujah oh present tense manifest yourself manifest that attribute of healing in me maybe you're lost this morning you know this present tense your parents have told you about him you've felt them you've sat in service and felt his anointing you felt his spirit move across you heard a song and that song touched your emotions and here's a song about jesus and for some reason tears start running down your tree can you have no control over the heart that's beating inside of you all of a sudden you feel conviction you say what's that conviction it's the present tense knocking on your heart i want to come in i want to manifest myself in your personality i want to i want to take my abode in your personality i hope i can lay that down we are not changing our personality god gave us our personality god changed his form but he didn't change his personality he didn't change his nature but he changes your nature but he doesn't change the nature your personality that he manifests himself in because he's got to manifest himself in a person oh it's beautiful beautiful i mean i'm part of the plan of god this has been his purpose from the beginning i've worked all these years trying to become something different trying to change the way i am sin isn't the way you are sin is the influence of the devil on you sin is of the devil sin is in the flesh and the flesh warts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these two are contrary one to the other but that great spirit god made us people man makes saints god makes sons and daughters in closing because i will just continue on this subject and in this message if you would like to study and read it the bible said jesus is the same yesterday today and forever jesus says the works that i do shall he that believeth on me do also that's right notice that's the real malkeside now that's the real person now the works that i do you should do also who is this one person who was this melchizedek it was god made flesh who was this melchizedek it was that person in jesus christ who was that mount keys of that it was that person in his church who is this melchizedek it was god made flesh whoever believeth that jesus christ has not come in the flesh is antichrist is anti-anointing is anti-fellowship is anti-invisible union he's against he's against the person the i am the present tense abiding in flesh manifested present tense the world system of religion is against this revelation it's against the revelation of god the god the one and only true person god dwelling in human beings they always have them up there and then they create a third person to sprinkle a little anointing and that anointing never manifests itself the same way some say if you speak in tongues you've got it some say you shout you've got it you can go watch and someone will say a holy ghost outbreak and people are dancing and running and jumping and and falling all over and they say it's the spirit it's a spirit but yet there's still one god there's one person and that one person's desire was you not you to become something else but that he could manifest himself in your person present tense that's the malacca keys adapt today and i have many other things but we'll just take our time and and and spend these other days because this present tense god this only one god only one person this only one spirit is what is the rapture and that's why he wants that union to be there when that union starts and that growth starts the minute that you begin in that present tense reality the rapture begins it's already started in you now this morning my simple question is and i know i covered a lot of doctrine and maybe raised a lot of questions and i i hope i did because there's an answer and it's the word of god it's not man's interpretation of the word of god it's god interprets his own word by bringing it to pass and i hope this morning if if i didn't do anything this morning and not trying to explain but i want to stir up your pure hearts and your pure minds and i want us to bring back because the greatest thing that's happening with this so-called plague that's on the world is it's causing people to become loose everybody speeds everywhere because they're not writing tickets nobody shows up on time because they got a built-in excuse people start to stay home people start doing things all these things become part of your life it begins to work on your consciousness but you should never never stop being in fellowship with that person with the present tense manifestation of god in your life don't let that slip and if you've covered that up with religion that's all religion is it's a covering it's something you can put over yourself and say i am this i'm a methodist i'm a presbyterian i'm a baptist i'm this i'm that blasphemous names is all that there are and just a covering that you cover yourself up but you never come in contact with the revelation of the resurrection i am the way the truth the life i am the resurrection and the life i am the i am who do you say that i am thou art the christ okay looked at him and said you're not yet a man but but 50 years old and he said before abraham was i am i'm the present tense manifestation of the present tense i am the manifestation of the present tense are you this morning the manifestation of the present tense if you're not he's here because he created you that he could manifest himself in your personality let the word of god come in and cleanse your heart let the word of god deal with you amen not for those of you that need to go this morning we certainly understand i know i've been long this morning but since we've canceled our evening service that i've been taking a little longer in the mornings but i hope you can feel and understand his presence he's with us not only will he be with us he said i will not leave you comfortless but i will come again and i will be with you even in you till the end he promised that his present tense would be with us always and so we're gonna have a baptism we have a brother that wants to be baptized this morning and we're going to baptize them so his brother billy comes and he leads you in some singing we'll go ahead and stand and we'll be dismissed in prayer and then we'll have our baptismal service so if you have to go maybe you have to be at work or you have dinner plans you're more than welcome to stay and participate in the baptism service this morning but we'll just bow our heads and and let's just turn our hearts and open our hearts to this wonderful spirit and in our hearts may we say this morning our heavenly father my precious lord and savior i want to be in fellowship i want to be in fellowship with this present tense god it's not a religion it's not a church it's not a group of people it's an individual affair where i know i'm in him and he's in me [Music] i know that the one and only true god lives in my life he lives in my heart and i know that he lives out through me and that he wants to be seen [Music] his whole purpose was to make himself known and to be seen he put on a mask so he could be seen he could be handled and he could be touched [Music] and he didn't just go away he said i'll come again unto you [Music] i'm not going to take my presence away from you i'm not going to take the present tense reality away from you but i'm going to come again and i'll be with you even in you till the end of the world [Music] oh church don't substitute religion don't substitute intellect for that personal contact with the present tense this morning if you maybe you've met him and it's just got cold and you've drifted away and you'd like just to lift your hand this morning not to me my hands are up my eyes are closed my head is bowed and say god i want a greater reality of your present tense i want a greater reality of the person that's here with us i want more of a call in my life i want i want more of a consciousness that you're here in every circumstance i come in i want to be the master of that circumstance i want the present tense god to be seen in me in every situation i want to have this deep rich communion with you [Music] i don't want it substituted with theories and doctrines and man-made ideas i want it to be you i want to be in that secret chamber i want to be in that hidden place behind that inner veil i want to be in that shekinah glory lord i wanted to cleanse me from all unrighteousness i want to bring my flesh under subjection lord i want to be free from the lust of the eye and the pride of life i want to be free from my temper i want to be free from this depression and bitterness that so [Music] tears me down [Music] lord i want communion this morning [Music] father we've come this morning not to persuade people by personality not to preach a gospel that's sociably acceptable but father to preach the truth because the truth is the only thing that sets a man free and we fight spiritual wickedness in high places satan appears as an angel of light deceiving whosoever he will but praise god it's impossible just deceived the very elect thank you for that this morning we ask you to bless our baptism this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you this morning brother billy and the brotherhood wants to be baptized if you'd come brother jackson god bless you if you need

words before we baptize him go ahead brother turn uh hello brothers and sisters and friends um most of you already know a portion of my testimony because my brother was baptized a couple weeks ago so i think he's covered a couple of things over that but i was raised in a face where we thought brother random was god and i was raised from that and just having that basis uh we were taught to read the bible uh reading between the lines basically uh the issue with that you know you couldn't really accept the bible as the whole truth and uh once i started reading the bible for myself once i got his age i got the i got the whole truth from myself and i [Applause] i realized jesus christ was the lord and savior amen and i got to the truth and uh here to be baptized amen [Applause] and reading in the book of acts in the second chapter in the 32nd verse this jesus hath god raised up whereof we are all witnesses therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear for david is not ascended into the heavens but he said himself the lord saith unto my lord sit down on my right hand until i make thy foes thy footstool therefore let all this house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom he had crucified both lord and christ and when they had heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this up towards generation and they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about 3 000 souls amen just think repent and receive the present tense of god amen our brothers come to be baptized amen our precious brother according to the word of god jesus told him to go into all the world and to be baptized in the name of the father the son the holy ghost and peter with the keys to the kingdom and the divine revelation of the godhead knew that that name was the lord jesus christ for he came in his father's name and according to the word of god in the scriptures the word of god in this last day we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] oh blessed peace and peace [Music] oh blessed [Music] blessed be [Music] [Music] oh [Music] you're my hiding place [Music] you are worthy of my praise [Music] me [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Applause] i know [Music] said oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] crazy [Music] hey [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] me
