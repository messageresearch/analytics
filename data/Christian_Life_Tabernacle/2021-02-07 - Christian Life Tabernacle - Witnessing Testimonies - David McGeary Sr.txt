Description:
Br. David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Evening Service: February 7,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

you have a place prepared that we can come to and that you've given us eternal life that death has no sting that we just passed from one veil to the other lord that there's no sorrow in it for the one that passes over many times our hearts are sorrowful to see one goal but father if they're in christ jesus they've never left oh god we worship you oh lord elohim we praise you tonight and we just ask you to bless us in this wonderful time of communion in jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you may be seated tonight just um i've asked uh brother cosmine if he would come and just give us a few words of testimony of the things that they've had on their heart and the things that they're going and how everything's kind of falling together and and uh i just think it's a wonderful burden that they have and so cousin if you could come and share that with us tonight and for a few moments and then we'll read a few scriptures and we'll go right into communion so brother cosman if you could come tonight amen or bishop enjoyed those songs tonight and it's wonderful amen god bless you i'm a little nervous amen i wanted to read the scripture before we get started and that's going to be in romans chapter 6. verse 22 22 and 23 of romans chapter 6. and it says but now being made free from sin and became servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord as brother david said it's just it's been a testimony recently where the lord has just been doing a lot of work and in my life personally and you know if i was to sit here and talk about it it would probably take hours because there's just a lot of detail but you know just summarizing it as much as i can you know the ending of 2020 for me was with the desire in my heart and that was to be able to manifest more the spirit of christ in my life and you know i caught myself in this direction where i didn't know where to go now that then i it was just one of those things where i got comfortable i was going to work i was coming home i was coming to wednesday night service i was going home i was coming to church i was going home and it just became a routine so as the as the year was ending i really just had in my heart i said lord if this is christianity i'm this is boring i said i want more i i don't want to just go to work and come home and come to wednesday night and hear the word and go home and i said what's this i said this is this is boring i want more i want to contact other people and testify of this gift eternal life so you know as the year was passing it's not like something happened at that time i it was just a desire in my heart and as the time was passing um you know there were certain messages that were preached and you know i was listening to some some of the sermons from brother branham and they were just you know direct speaking to my desire my my heart's desire and you know as the time was coming i believe about almost a month ago there was one month or one night where the lord really dealt with me and you know i i was reading this message and i want to read this quote because this is this is where my heart start up and and and it's about being a witness and when i read this quote something really just manifested in my life that i can't explain i can't i could sit here and try to explain to you what happened but i i it's just supernatural so you know there's just no words to try to put it in in words to explain to you what happened but it's called it's out of 1958 the oneness of unity it says this it says here's brother brand i'm just describing you know the upper room and it's talking about the apostles and and he said he he says in here paragraph i believe i didn't write it on here but i believe it's 60 or something like that it says watch what he said he said it is not for you to know that hour but go up to the city of jerusalem and you shall be endued with power from on high before you can be a witness a witness has to know something a witness has to have an experience and you cannot be a witness of christ until the holy ghost has baptized you it says jesus would not permit his disciples to preach the gospel until they received the holy ghost yet they have been honored to walk with them for three and a half years though they were holy men accepted in his sight but he would not let them go preach until they waited up there and got all their differences out of them and then the holy spirit came what the world needs today is that same feeling when the dumping outcomes it needs a feeling what does that feeling do when it comes in where you have doubt it brings faith where you have indifference it brings love where you have hatred it brings fellowship and then when the church of the living god someday will be united under one great head and that will be the head of god into the unity of the body of christ will be the governor and the king of the lord over the entire church under his control then she will be received up so when i read this there was something in my heart that just said text us to brother joseph and this was like almost 10 o'clock at night i'm like well maybe he's sleeping i shouldn't do it so i did it anyways i try not to reason and i believe i'll kind of let him share the testimony on that but i i really believe that when i sent that something happened in their life but you know that night when i went to sleep i tried to go to sleep around 11 i woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning and i couldn't go to sleep so now i'm thinking i'm like well lord do you need to talk to me should i get on my knees what should i do i was just i was just waiting to hear from the lord so i went back to the sermon and i read it and i was really interested at three in the morning just reading the service because it was really really touching the burden that i had on my heart so you know a couple of days later the testimony with my daughter comes with lily and you know i i believe i came to brother david and i was kind of telling them what happened within my heart and and i'm i'm just trying to understand this new identity i'm trying to understand what taking place i and and now there was a burden on my heart and i've never felt that before and uh you know i told about the david i said brother david i i i don't know what's in my heart but i just i just want to go and and do something for the poor people i want to go grill out and just share the gospel i i don't know i just feel like i need to reach out to them and um you know that was that was that and uh you know went back to just being and working and all of that and i believe a couple of weeks ago or might have been last week or a couple of weeks ago i was talking about the joseph and i was sharing my desire with him and you know he said i'll come with you and and i said okay so um you know we got behind the scene and we kind of orchestrated a day where we would work for both of us together with our schedule to just go and find a spot i mean where do you find homeless at you know like you might find one here you might find one here so what how i don't have a bus to grab them all and take them to one place so um thursday come along and you know me and brother joseph were praying about this opportunity and just listening to the word and just trying to find some sort of guidance and there was none i mean you just you walk by faith and now i understand what what it means to walk by faith so we we we uh we meet at my office on thursday and it was about noon and uh brother joe says like where we're going i'm like well i don't know um i just i just know of this one spa and i don't know if they're still there all i know is that when i used to live in forney and i was driving to church every sunday when you pass over this direction there was just camp and i don't know where it's at i have no idea the street i have no idea anything so let's just go to dallas okay so we're getting on 183 we're going towards dallas we're getting down to 35 and um we pulled over it's just something just pulled over at 35 and continental and we pull up at the intersection and all of a sudden we see two guys were sitting on the left side and then a couple of more there so you know we made a left thinking that there was the garage and kind of looking and nothing happened so we turned around and parked the vehicle and we just started walking so the first people that we get encountered with is brother david and brother stephen and they're amazing amazing characters i we got to spend some time with them that day and but the stephen um has an amazing testimony he's only been on the streets for about three years brother dave has been on the streets for 37 years and now i'm getting to know somebody and and this is a shock for them because nobody ever likes to find interest in them so they're just like get out of here or you know trying to give him a dollar and leave and this was different so we go and talk to him and you know uh steven has a cast on so me and brother joseph you know offer prayers so we end the street literally just prayed for him and laid our hands and and and as we were talking i was asking for direction i said hey i'm looking for this camp i don't know where it's at i know what's underneath the bridge i know there's a bunch of homeless people that have tents and i'm trying to get to them and i don't know where i'm going they're like man i'm sorry i don't know i well you know we're here to i don't know i don't know where to tell you to go so we had about 10 15 minute conversation with them just sharing the gospel at the same time and then we crossed the street and we meet jonathan it was jonathan and delilah and they were begging they had a sign in their hand and you know but jonathan's sick he's got a lung disease and i asked brother jonathan the same exact question and i said um do you know this place i'm looking for this place this whole this whole thing it's it's all about that destination so i'm asking strangers about where to go and you know he's like well you know i don't really know i just know that i just know that there if you go over here maybe you make a ride and you go all the way down there might be a train there and by the train there's a parking spot and i think there's some people there underneath the brick i don't really know but try that and and i said okay okay so so after that i said brother jonathan i wanted to kind of explain to you what's been on our hearts and and me and brother joseph just felt the call to come out here and just to explain or talk to the people about the lord jesus christ and it's on our hearts desire to find this place we just can't find it and we told them that you know we had a commission and the bible said that to go preach the gospel and we want to cling to that and preach the gospel to these people and he stops for a second and uh i told brother david this in the office but it's just this guy all of a sudden just changed that the best way i could i could tell is like moses entered his body and all of a sudden he just started speaking something different and uh he uh he said you know i used to go to church once and he started testifying and i was shocked i i didn't know what to expect and he's like you know i i really want to pray for you because what you're about to do [Music] is going to be a phenomenal work and i don't know it's an honor to meet you guys and i want to bless you i want to pray for you and he said he said this he said he started crying and he just said you know he said i wish i could be in your spot i wish i could do what you're doing i wish i could go with you and he just started tearing in his eyes because i love my lord jesus and i really want to do the same work and i told by the jonathan i said you know i i said just keep that keep that in your heart keep believing because one day you will and i'm going to find you and i'm going to bring you with me and we're going to go share the gospel together and so we follow his directions go over here i don't even remember the streets i honestly didn't remember because it said turn right on top of the hill and i did that's what i did and i went all the way down and that's what i did so i didn't pay attention to no streets so we finally get up and we go over the bridge and we kind of missed it and we come turn around and a little bit joseph kind of shared a testimony on the side but we find brother jay and you know brother jay is just an awesome guy and he all of a sudden he i asked him to say question and i said um hey do you know about this camp do you know about this tents do you know about it's like yeah it's like it's right here it's like i actually know the people there they're awesome people i'm like huh i said okay do you want to come in my truck and show us where it's at he's like yeah okay so we put him in the truck first we want he said he was hungry so we got him some food and then after that we he kind of showed us to the camp so as we're walking out um and this is all happening thursday as we're walking out he's like hey i want to i want to go introduce you to these people i really want to tell them that what you're about to do from is going to be great i mean here's a guy that doesn't even know what's going on he's just kind of meeting us and he's just like man you guys are awesome there's something different about you and just all excited and happy and he literally went before this camp and i believe there is about uh now that we've met the people probably about 12 to 15 there and he goes there and he talks to him i don't know for about 13 15 seconds just real quick and me but joseph kept walking and kept walking and you know the first couple of people we came in contact with were were george and and glinda so we got to the destination now what i mean okay so we're talking to these people and we're like hey here's what the lord's been doing for us we we had this burden and we're here and this is the place and they're just kind of looking at us okay and uh we're going to come back saturday and what we're going to do is we want to just grill out for you guys and we want to share the gospel with you we want to we want to introduce you to to the lord jesus we want we want to share the gospel with you guys and they're like what yeah okay and uh we just started testifying to to george and glenda and you know something supernatural transpired there and i'll let brother joseph touch on that quickly but um so now they were excited for saturday george actually had a cell phone it wasn't charged because they don't have power there so they wrote around a piece of paper and i said george can you please do me a favor and maybe text me on friday and just let me know how many people are going to be here friday or saturday so i know how much food to bring because i don't want to bring food for 15 people and there's like 100 you know so he's like okay so we leave and you know me and brother joseph are just kind of just thrilled of what the lord just did you know we're just like oh my goodness okay we're here and and there was something on my heart i'm like hey we got to go tell jonathan this we got to go back i mean he prayed for us so we go back and we we talked to jonathan and you know we're just i'm just letting them know that the lord's really blessed us and we find we found the place and i said hey i said if you're willing to if you want to pray about it if you're willing to i want you to come with a saturday and and i want you to share the testimony of what the lord's done for you with these people i said my scars cannot identify with your scars and what you're going through and he was just honored he's like oh my goodness man you don't understand so he said you know what i'll come so he was just really excited so we end up going out there it was ended up being me brother joseph um brother adrian brother jackson and then brother orlando ended up showing and uh we go there saturday we pull up to the spot we started we started cooking and on friday night actually glinda texted us off of brother george's phone and said hey there's going to be about 25 people here tomorrow like wow okay so we were prepared for about 25 30 people so we go and buy all the stuff and we go saturday and and we we we cook out and you know um a lot of people are coming and uh you know we we i didn't want it to sound like we were kind of using it as a bait but you know a lot of people when they're hungry they come to food so i'm like well if we're gonna give you natural food we might as well just give us a spiritual at the same time not too two birds with one stone that's what we were here to do so as as people are coming eating we're just kind of spending a one-on-one time and testifying to some of these people and and i'll say this you know there was just the love in my heart for these people that i got to meet because they really have a character they really have a story and really i mean if you just sit there to listen you're just mesmerized you're just like wow and you know some of them say that they have an experience with the lord and and they do some of them don't want to hear about the lord but you know a lot of a lot of what they were doing is just like man there's just something they were recognizing something they're like they're just something different about you guys there's just something different about what you guys are doing you know there's a lot of people here trying to give us food but never where they're doing this personal touch and their personal way of sharing the gospel this is different it's just you know they're just they were just shocked so you know i told a bunch of the people there um i said you know um this is not going to be the first time we'll be here uh we're probably going to be here quite a bit um so i want to get to know you i want you to get to know me as individuals but the main important thing is i want to share the gospel with you and i want the same life and the same message that changed my life i want to share the same gospel with you because i know what it took me out of and i know we could take you out of that too and they were just happy they were just you know i've met homeless in the past or i didn't you know they're just kind of you know some of them could be grouchy some of them could just be you know stress of life or but i'm telling you the people that we've met they're just absolutely amazing they're just so warm so welcoming and and and they want to hear the gospel and by having that heart of receiving the gospel i really believe that the lord's going to do something and you know i don't know if you guys noticed but this morning we brought brother trevor with us in our church well he was part of that testimony and and he came and just sat down in eight and uh he was kind of telling us his life story and uh you know we offered i said hey do you want to come to church with us tomorrow he's like yeah man i'm like okay um at first we were gonna try to pick him up in the morning and all of a sudden you know the lord transpired where we're like we're just gonna bring him with us we'll put him over here into a room and in the morning he'll just come to church so you know he came to church and he was really excited that the lord was able to speak to him and and he was able to to be fed and uh you know just like i read in romans 6 it's it's a gift this gift is eternal life and and i want to share this gift because if he was if it changed my life and he gave me this how much more can he give it to his lost children that are still out there and and you know it's just it's just a testimony for me because you know i i never asked for this you know i i it was just something that the lord just provided and um you know i don't know where this work is gonna where it's gonna go what it's gonna do but just keep us in your prayer um we want the lord to bring people like that into our church and be fed you know and just be a testament be a light just be able to uh to share that gospel because what else are we going to talk about you know i don't want to talk about science i don't want to talk about math i don't want to talk about anything else with anybody else but i want to talk about the lord and if there's a seed there it'll receive and i know you know all we could do is just trust in the lord but yeah it's it's it's amazing and we're really looking forward to what the lord's doing so i'm gonna invite brother joseph he's gonna tie up some ants for me and share part of his testimony because you know it um it's been on both of our hearts to do this and i'm just thankful that that god's the same yesterday today and forever i'll tell you it's a privilege for me to just be able to do that and you know i'll say this you know not that but when you go there and and and you see the way these people live and you see the way these people have their life i'm just so great for that that god gave me and i have what i have and the fact that we were able to sit down and eat with them and share the gospel and and give them a hug and shake their hand and not worry about what they smelled like or what they looked like to who they were and who they weren't you know that showed that love and and that's what they recognized and they said there's something different about you guys because nobody does that everybody comes and drops off the food and they leave because that's all they're worried about is performing that good deed but there's just something different about you and there's just something different about what you guys are telling us i don't know what it is and i want i want to know more so they already know we're coming next saturday we're going next saturday and we're just going to keep going and you know i just i i just want to say this if you guys see one of them as they're coming to church we're supposed to bring brother jonathan the church is coming up wednesday he said he wants to come to church just shake their hand and just just just share that love because you know this is just something that we were able to do and i want him to feel the same exact love from from the people here because we're the same we're the same we obtain the same exact spirit and that's the spirit of the lord jesus christ in us god bless you [Applause] god bless you i definitely agree with that sentiment of feeling a little nervous looking upon so many faces but here we go so where to get started i would like to start with john 10 16 and it says and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd then in luke 14 verse 23 and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled so when this work commenced uh these were two scriptures i actually uh told brother cosman i said uh john 10 16 of the lord speaking of of their of there being other sheep not in the fold and that they must come in there be a one fold i said this this kind of feels like a theme thing with the work of going finding those sheep bringing them in and then also another theme too that brought in is that you know uh of going into the highways and hedges because in a sense that was literally what we're doing is literally going into the highways compelling them and if you look into compel there that means you know you're with an earnest state of mind you you're you're persuading them right trying to compel them to persuade them coming you know come to come to the lord come to the gospel come come to this uh come eat what i have to offer of you but before i get into a little bit of the details of what the lord did i have to back up a little bit of of what happened to me because as similar to a brother cosmic of the lord jesus coming and making a change in his life i too actually had a similar change and it was in 2020 end of uh november to be exact so we here i have brother david for the spirit of the lord laying in all these uh messages of the central theme being about the father's business and that really has had a profound effect on me to where even even even before this change even took uh it was even taking message books and putting them you know a few places here and here just just trying to satisfy that burden of to be about the father's business well that that worked a little bit but you know it doesn't quite hit the spot you know that that's good but that's not all that there is to do so it finally wound up towards uh the end of 2020 i remember uh spiritually feeling um the only way i can describe it as a spiritually sick i'm not feeling too well so asking the lord just i just spiritually i don't feel too good like i i need to get better like please make me whole so i remember a list of sermons that came to mind i think actually uh um i figured exact sources but i remember one in particular it was actually a sermon brother david was speaking of and he made i think a quotation of taking sides with jesus and he said he recommended and said um i recommend you go read it so you know what i took up the recommendation i finished reading the book that i was reading and uh then i popped on down and started reading that one it was a wonderful book cleared me up on a few things and somehow from that book i ended up on the messaging from that time i won't go into the exact details of what moved me in that but there was a call of god to my life from that message i was actually sitting my dining room at the head of my table where i normally normally sit almost all the time when i sit at that table and there was a call god made out to to to to the cold and different church member and i felt compelled to respond to that and i did i stood up on my feet and i responded to that i won't go into what he said afterwards but there was two words he a sentence he said after to me and it was so profound to me that it went from being just hearing the words on a tape but it was almost as literally those words were being spoken directly to me the best way i can i can say it is it's not it's not hearing it and being identified with it it's literally wow that that is that that that that is that is me who is talking about and when he said the last thing there was such a profound change that came over me um indifference went out lack of caring for people went out my whole motive and desire life changed how i conducted my life change i didn't ask for it the call that god put in i don't ever actually remember asking specifically what was said for me i was thinking of something else but the lord came in and and chose me and put me into his service to do his work and and and and i just inspect the fruit of that it could be like oh you just got excited but no it's just the fruit of that i noticed what happened in my life i used to i just in my mind you know i would feel uh sympathize with people and say sure you know we should be you know preaching the gospel giving the gospel to people and whatnot but now it goes from being in the mind to now being in the heart to where now from speaking from the mind is now speak from inside what was once done maybe mentally through what you think is right and now it's done by nature so it was such a profound change i noticed in my life i i probably went uh two or three weeks without telling anyone i'm just what do i do with this like i'm i'm changed i'm different uh and those are changes in my life you know an increased consecration a relationship between the bible and the message changed it was always an interest there but now it has gone gone to another level and now there's a few things that happened between now and with the work that the lord started with me and brother cosman but i'll just skip over those and leading up to what the lord has started the work with these with these uh homeless people i think about a week or two before i was i was in prayer and one of the things i prayed actually i don't remember the time frame there but sometime before brother cosman reached out to me i'd actually prayed is that lord i i want to i want to come in contact with more people because in my day-to-day life with what i do for a living you know to earn money to pay the bills and take care of things i'm at home i work at home especially with coronavirus just 100 home i don't contact a lot of people in that in living life like that so a cry of my heart was that lord i want to make contact with more people because how can you share the gospel with someone you know unless you see their face right you actually have to see them you have to talk to them you have to express interest in them you have to wait you know for the lord to open the door and you actually speak to them it's kind of hard to do unless you actually go and be there in front of people so that was the prayer lord i want to make contact with more people and i left it at that now there also was another desire and cry in my heart of the lord i i i want to win souls for your kingdom because as part of that transformation was the feeling or thought inside of me is that you know i've worked for my kingdom long enough my personal kingdom joseph gordon this flesh man right here it's time it's uh it's time to work for his so that was part of that transformation was that realization right there and actually part of that realization is that ambitions in life changed it went from being career oriented to actually now wanting to go save the lost to go bring the message to them to go look after their souls and bring them in and do and do all that could be done for them so there's that prayers that lord i want to make contact with more people so on the day that uh brother carson caused called me it was the sunday it was the saturday right before lily's baptism and the the contact right there was actually supernatural in and of itself because normally what i do with my cell phone since uh what i do day to day for a living i i don't need to be on the phone it's mainly there for my convenience i normally have uh all the ringers turned off everything off is just it's just silent like like if it's important i'll leave a voicemail and i'll get back to it otherwise it's not important that's normally how i've treated my phone so i was getting my coffee maker ready and my phone was sitting right next to my coffee maker and i'm getting it ready and saturday night then i see brother costume no i'm i'm glad i'm right here you know otherwise i would have missed it so i picked it up and said hello and started talking to him he tells me the just the the wonderful testimony of about lilly's uh her wanting to be baptized but it doesn't stop there then we stay on the phone he continues talking and he he talks about uh brother joseph you know the lord's put a desire in my heart to uh to go uh to go like a feed the like like the homeless or go do something for them that really struck me it quick into my mind it came to my mind real quick what i prayed lord i want to be in contact with more people and without hesitation i'm like i'm going with you why it came to me that was the door a door open i had prayed the door open that was the answer right there all right so we really really we put a very minimal amount of pre-planning in it why because we don't want to be light of our own minds so we end up i end up telling we say you know what i'll take off thursday will thursday work for you thursday worked for him and we left thursday thursday afternoon and we headed over we headed over there to dallas don't want to reiterate too many and sake of time we reiterate too many of the things uh things that he said but yeah you know the first people who we met was uh dave and and and stephen not really nice friendly guys we go over jonathan it was it was a it was really really wonderful talk talking to him we get off to the right place and actually the road that is is actually i think houston avenue if anybody familiar with it this place is is this bridge i think it's houston avenue under the head of the bridges let's go into the trinity river and uh we missed the parking lot it's a really big public parking lot right there i think it's for people to go see there's a few museums up up there there's a little train station there so we miss the turn for the parking lot and we go up and we have to turn around and as we're coming back into downtown right there uh broadcasting is like oh we gotta we gotta turn i said well we can't can't hear that's that's a one way um yeah yeah one way this way so you gotta go up there you need to get in that lane and actually as he's going some reason i'm moving my hand i sometimes move my hands a lot when i talk and i was moving my hand and i saw this guy walking down the street this way and ultimately he waves i was thinking he saw me in the vehicle and he thought i was waving at him and then i'll suddenly just i just said pastor we got to stop and talk to him we gotta stop we gotta we gotta talk to him and i actually i think i actually gesturing we gotta talk to him so he quickly pulls up backs up and this guy is already there and we're rolling down the window of course um this man jay his name is jay he's not actually homeless he has a little trailer he lives in but he has been homeless and the lifestyle he lives is one of the homeless person but so he sees this so he of course quickly picks up like oh wow they're going to give me something and we did probably more than what he actually uh thought he was going to get too so we actually get up and uh we make contact with them actually we actually have little care bags um they have a few things they need and a message book inside we actually hand one to him i said oh man that's great thank you really appreciate it but of course we don't stop there we actually get out and we're making contact with this fellow i think we asked him about the lord he said he's a christian and he said but you know you know i have a problem with cussing and you know we prayed for him i asked him can i put my arm around you i did because you know what in doing this work yeah no they they don't smell the best they're they're they're they're they're there there is there is that barrier there to where you could let that be an impediment your contact with him but i tell you what when you have the love of god in your heart you view them as your as an equal human being because the blood of the lord jesus christ was shed for all of us right as human beings were equal so just with that love in my heart there's no apprehension in making that kind of contact with them so put the arm around his shoulder prayed for him the lord would just deliver himself take that out of his life then brother cosman asked him do you know do you know where this place is and he says he does and the next thing that's done really blows the man away because brother carson opens the door says get in we're going to take you to where you live and eventually take him to uh to get him some food and whatnot and just really just just just you know we already made gave him something we got out and actually hugged him prayed for him we're interacting with him and now we ask him to get in the vehicle it's just it just blows this man's uh mind away that we're just like oh just one and done and gone so he actually takes us to the camp and and uh he makes makes the introduction for us so brother cosby told you a lot of details right there but uh one special thing that really really stuck out to me there was that the lord moved on a lady's behalf glinda now the thing that's really remarkable to me about that is that glenda that's actually the name of my mom i didn't know that when i actually when this thing about to tell you happened i didn't know it at the time but actually as we're standing there talking i think wrapping up uh making an introduction to them and we're about to leave i just i just felt a pull in my heart to pray for him i just did you know it's just one of those things you can't explain you just just feel like i need to pray for this person i did i took her by the hand and and you really felt the spirit of the lord there just coming to minister to something in in her heart and before we get started praying i asked her name she says glinda and that really really helped me to really just enter in and the lord really really just move it and touch her again i don't know what it was but it just the results afterwards you just felt that the lord touched something very specific in her heart so that contact was established and then we left we come back on saturday they're all excited to see us the lord really really really really moved before us and really did tremendous things with these people um we actually went through to try to pick up jonathan but he actually uh he actually was sleeping and the lady who is his wife she said no we'll take a rain check today uh we'll we'll just we'll just skip it so you know we didn't know him well enough to feel comfortable of waking waking him up because where it where it is is that you have some homeless over here this is their sidewalk then jonathan delilah they have their sidewalk over here where they're staying so at the time we didn't feel comfortable enough while waking up so we we went and left so we went to the camp we set up fed the people talked to the people and then actually the lord really moved on the behalf of glendale's husband uh george uh he has something wrong with his eyes and and just standing there talking with him just being friendly then finally a door opens up and then the lord moves in and and and and and and the lord just speaks and just tells him you know george you know he can see right now but the the fear is that he's going to go blind i told him you don't have to be you that doesn't have to be the end you don't have to be blind you know do you know the lord jesus that there's a gift of healing he looked at me strange not stranger like oh that's weird but like really that really that that really really got me i said has anyone ever told you this before and it really struck you really stuck in that man's heart while what was spoken to him so the lord provided that entry there to be able to pray pray for him and ask the lord to to provide healing for his eyes so that was that was really special right there and you know it was just a beautiful thing and how all the brothers worked together and how we individually were speaking to each one of them and the lord just ministering to the needs of these people's lives you know some of them you know the doors were completely shut like you know there's there's just no entrance right there to speak of them the lord brought other ones you know the doors wide open like oh yes i want to hear other ones you know you'd have to warm up warm them up a little bit talk to them and uh winding up here uh the young man trevor who came with us he was actually he's actually there pretty early uh one of one of the first ones he came there pretty soon actually after he started because you know his food right that news kind of travels kind of fast food go down to that place under the bridge they're feeding people down there but here's actually one thing you know people like free food and especially if you can't afford it but interestingly we we did not run out of food in fact we had enough food we actually had to give it away right we bought actually we actually bought too much so actually trevor comes comes down and the interesting thing there is that you felt almost an instant connection with him you know kind of like door open door closed it almost like he came and the door was well oiled hinges just just just waiting just almost a little breath and just swinging the doors right open and and and and just really speaking to him i told him brother trevor you know what the reason why we are here is that there is someone hungering for the lord we don't know who it is but all but the lord does not waste his time you know he doesn't waste his money he doesn't waste his time he doesn't do his business sloppy the reason why we're over here because there is at least one and brother cosmo and i were actually fellowshipping on this before we even got there he said there's at least one person here we don't know who it is trevor it might be you it might be you that that's the reason why this is done and we just really just just what were we doing we're doing that compelling doing that persuading come come come we got something for you come with us and of course the lord just wonderfully worked it out for him to come with us and and make it to this service and just the final comment here is uh is i'm just blown away with what's happened uh just like brother cosby he said you know i never asked for this i never asked to do this i am right there with them with the work that the lord is doing it's never anything that i recall asking for in my life the lord choosing putting a person on the path to do his work and i'm just so happy that i i'm able to share in this burden with my brother cosmic to go out to preach to these people to pull them in to do everything we can to bring eternal life to them bring this message to them to to to to get them well grounded in the word if they are believers if they're sinners bring get them to eternal life if they're sick you know pray for them put our arms around hug them tell them that we love them it's the lord jesus christ that loves them and i i'm just i'm just so happy to be a part of that and especially not just for myself but i'm so happy to be about the father's business and to be able to share in this business with my with my brothers and sisters in christ god bless you amen isn't that inspirational and and wonderful i'd just like to read a couple scriptures before we get into our communion of foot washing to kind of fortify and stand behind what the brothers have just said in romans 8 he says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so you've got to have a spiritual mind you understand the carnal mind finds every reason but we'll just keep reading and it said uh for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it is weak through the fresh flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that in righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnal minded is death but to be spiritual minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for that it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit and if so that the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up christ from the dead dwelling you he hath raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen to see young men and to see the spirit of god come in and move and to see that they have a calling in their life and then to to follow that calling despite any carnal-minded obstacles that might be up there and and and uh it just thrills my heart and then if i would turn over if you would turn over with me and do corinthians the first corinthians the first chapter and the 17th verse and paul's speaking and he says for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with the wisdom of words lest the cross of jesus christ should be made of none effect for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nought the understanding of the prudent where is the wise and where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made foolishness the wisdom of this world and after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the jew requires a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jewish stumbling block and unto the greek foolishness but unto them which are called both jewish jew and greek christ is the power of god in the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and the things which are despised hath god chosen ye the things which are not to bring to not the things that are that no flesh is glory in his presence but of him are ye in christ jesus and of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according to is it written he that glorious let them glory in the lord and i i just think it's wonderful and and i i just think it's the lord showing that he moves on a couple men's hearts and and brother jackson felt compelled to go and and brother orlando and and just to see the burden and to see the transformation that is taking so if i could say it you know god's got something for you to do and i i think it's wonderful when you see young men they begin to seek a calling and this calling presents a burden and they go out without anything but the love of god in their heart you know they're not they're not ashamed of who they're talking to they're in the highways and the byways and they're sharing the gospel and we've got so carnal minded and so church religion we think everything has to be done in church it's done by faith the faith revelation to revelation the love of god should have brought in your heart to many so i i just want to just really uh thrilled for the brethren uh um i i just hope that it it this calling in their lives never dies and that many more will feel a need in their life to fulfill something that might be missing and calling so they have all of my support i'm not the institutor of it i didn't plan the program that they did it and i'm glad they did and i'm behind them a hundred percent and i want to give them my support in prayer and in finance and who knows know what we're all waiting for don't you we're waiting for that last one to come in and and if they're on a mission to find them then praise god amen the lord richly bless you i hope you enjoyed that this evening uh at this time let us uh the brethren will go prepare for communion and get ready for communion we will let us stand since these scriptures are our scripture reading tonight and let us just read our communion scriptures but let's start with the 17th verse and see the wisdom of paul handling something that began to come into the church it says in the 17th verse now in this that i declared unto you i praise you not that you come together not for the better but for the worse for first of all when you come together in the church i hear that there be division among you and i partly believe it for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you when you come together therefore unto one place is it not to eat the lord's supper for in eating everyone taketh before the other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken what have he not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say unto you shall i praise you in this i praise you not for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also took ye the cup when he had some sane this cup is the new testament in my blood this dewey as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord and let a man examine himself and so let him eat that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if you would judge our your ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come amen god bless you brethren our gracious heavenly father before us lies this great communion table and father we know that it's a spiritual feast in a personal communion with you and lord we ask you to bless tonight the wine that is set here that represents the stimulation of revelation to the believer we ask you to bless it to those that partake father also the bread here that represents the body that was sacrificed for us on calvary and lord we ask that we partake of it father for it represents spiritual food to us but we ask you to bless the wine and bread this evening to each of the believers that takes communion and we ask it in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you
