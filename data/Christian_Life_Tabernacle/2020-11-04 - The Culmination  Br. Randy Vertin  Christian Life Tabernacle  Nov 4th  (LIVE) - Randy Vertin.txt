grateful for that we just want to give you an update on our services we heard several weeks ago that if we had a few cases show up in the church and so what that we did is we we closed it down for a few weeks because we didn't know who those people had come in contact with but all that cycle has run its course and all those people have got well and they're not contagious anymore and so we had like 65 people show up sunday and we're grateful that we had that many and we have some more tonight so for those of you that are in good health and not at high risk i think that you could feel safe to come back in and join a fellowship if if you feel that way if you don't then uh we hope that uh you know you have a reason but we certainly don't want fear to be our motivation you know we do want to know that we have a god that healeth of all our diseases and they've made this sickness so big you know the prophet of god said cancer would be like a common cold and you know but and we just got to go forward church we have a job to do so anyway it's wonderful to have brother randy i enjoy brother randy's preaching don't you it just it gets me fired up and and he always has something wonderful to say and and so uh we're gonna sing that little song as he comes because i think we're the generation aren't we we're the one that makes the difference anyway so could you help me sing that song this evening as we write brother generation amen okay generation where's the culmination my the coming of the lord is near living out the revelation overcoming sin [Music] [Music] let's just sing that one more time oh we are the generation we're the culmination the final voice the world would here the coming of the lord is here living out the revelation overcoming the truth will go to every tongue and nation we are the chosen generation [Music] amen god bless you this evening how many believe that that we're the chosen generation amen amen the word says that when you see that fig tree putting forth its buds that generation won't pass so all these things be fulfilled and we're so grateful to be in that called out group by the grace of god we'll just get right into the word here we're going to turn to a couple passages of scripture uh first jeremiah chapter uh well actually let's start first in romans chapter eight and then we're going to turn to jeremiah chapter 29. in romans chapter 8 we'll start at verse 18. in verse 18 in romans chapter 8 says for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was not was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth and pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have first fruits have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body amen let's turn to jeremiah chapter 29 and we'll read verses 11-13 i believe we know these scriptures very well and let's let's start at verse 10 and read through 13. it says therefore fear thou not o my servant jacob saith the lord neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid for i am with thee saith the lord oh you know i'm sorry i'm in verse chapter 30. forgive me i was wondering why that didn't sound quite right amen all right let's start at verse 10 here though as well and we read through 13 for for thus saith the lord that after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word towards you and causing you to return to this place for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart amen let's just have a word of prayer heavenly father as we just come once again lord not to hear from a man or any kind of man's expectation or reason they can come up with lord for that wouldn't profit us lord anything but lord we've come to hear directly from your throne that your holy spirit would speak to the hearts of every believer that would be here lord and if there would be anybody that would have need of anything lord god you could you could minister to that need even now by your word father we have that promise lord that that you would give us the things that we had need of the lord jesus we just come before you lord and are asking that your perfect will be done this evening may you anoint me lord speak only thy word lord jesus and anoint the hearers lord that they would be able to open up and receive the word of god lord for that's that's our very life lord it's our sustenance and the the very thing that we live by lord we just pray that you would have preeminence in the service this evening lord in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated this evening we just want to speak uh ted brother david asked me in the back uh the song you know maybe this thing on came up here and it's you know i don't usually not really good at always just thinking of the song right there on the spot always but this song had kind of been on my heart because it's the only the only song that i could think of that had the word in it but the word the word that the lord kind of gave me to minister on in my heart was culmination and uh so we just sing that song we are the chosen generation the culmination and the word culmination if you look up the definition it's it says it's the highest or climactic point of something and i really like this part when i look up the definition it says it's especially as attained after a long time and you know we're living in that season where we had our you know elections going on and everything and that's certainly a culmination of a lot of things that have been going on for a long time you know but it may not be the culmination we're looking for but the rest of the world always in such anticipation for it and even now they're just waiting with baited breath to find out what's going on and all these things that are happening and we understand that in our age that we're in is such a it's an impatience that we have you know it's always desiring to have something right now and but we you know even in the natural form we understand you know i i remember you know you always told as a child i remember being told as a child that the the great the some of the greatest things are those things that you got to wait for you know when when you have a promise of something to come and then you receive it it just means so much more to you when it comes and you know and we're looking right now that in the time that we're at we know we're in the very last days you know we we may not know exactly the exact time frame but we know that the coming of the lord is is even at the door that that we're in the process of the rapture even now we we and we've been speaking so much on you know we were talking i think the last time we spoke on uh the the different channels that we have open to us and one of those biggest channels we've been talking about is that reasoning and the nature of our age is is that scientific age where we want to know everything we want to know how everything works and we want to be able to break it down to the very molecule and understand why exactly this is happening and why exactly that is happening and and but god has not called us to that in everything you know god wants us to live by a faith in in and there's there in order to have a faith there there there's by necessity a lack of natural understanding you know so many times we want to understand oh why exactly does this have to be this way why you know people at the i just i guess i can only compare it to now because it's the right now the time we're at with the elections and everything everyone wants to know why is everybody in such an uproar why is everybody under such pressure about this and that and by faith we understand the reasonings behind it is because the age that we're in is literally hell pressing itself into manifestation on the earth morality of man is completely gone reasoning of man even in the natural is completely gone doing things that they don't even understand why they would do it you know we understand the scripture says they would not even like to retain god in their knowledge and because of that god gave them up to reprobate minds i believe that scripture even says in a place that they would even do things that were inconvenient things that and by that it's things that don't even make sense but what is it it's all bringing us to a place see too many times as christians the devil is right there to be in our ears always trying to tell us that things are out of control that things just kind of feel like they're speeding speeding towards something and it and we there's no control to it and in a sense he is correct because in and of ourselves we don't have control as christians as a believer in knowing the word that we have in this hour i don't want to be in control when when you receive the holy ghost you you made you gave something unto the lord where i gave up control of my own life i gave up my own decision-making process i gave up my own natural thoughts of what i want to happen or what i think things should be and i gave it over to the lord jesus and too many times we want to be in control of the situation we want to know oh what's happening so we feel like oh lord are things just speeding out of control but nothing's out of control with god no matter what we look at in the political realm no matter what we look at in the natural realm no matter what we look at in the spiritual realm in the church realm god is in complete control of every situation if brother branham could say that that he could count how many times that little fleet batted his eyes if if the lord could say to pharaoh for this purpose i raised you up why did we fear about another natural pharaoh we could call it president or whatever word you want to give it because god the scripture says he setteth up kings and he taketh them down so we we we got to get it out of our own mind that that we need to be able to just understand because there's only one thing i need to understand and that is my god is in control uh there's only one thing i need to understand is that before the foundation of the world god knew exactly what color clothes you're going to be wearing right now he knew i was going to choose this tie to wear this evening and you have to understand that there is nothing that happens without significance paul said there's not a sound made without significance just because you don't understand it doesn't mean god doesn't have it in control and too many times in our mental ability remember this is an intellectual super age beyond anything we could have even comprehended brother branham even if you weren't even the natural i mean he probably saw a cell phone in one of those visions or something i don't know but you imagine that a hundred years ago they couldn't even comprehend what's happening right now they say they say according to the natural our intellectual knowledge doubles every day it's just a geometric exponential growth of intellectual knowledge and look what's followed it an exponential growth of sin right behind it because it can't help that that when satan moves into the place and brings his intellectual power that they start to reason god out of everything they start to reason god out of the schools they reason them out of the government everybody worries about the government the government think we know why it is the way it is it's because they kicked god out a long time ago and we know it's true because we had a prophet come and indict that generation so how else could we expect it to prosper oh sure i believe the lord can have grace and give us a space of time i believe that as he did if he could do it for ahab surely he could do it for his bride if she needed it but we got to understand that that we know who holds tomorrow we and there is something god is letting god allows these things to happen everything that we think oh the lord's not in control if the lord who created the heaven and the heavens and the earth you don't think that if he wanted to just like the lord did not the lord say no you know i could call legions of angels and my father would send it god could do whatever he wants to do if he allows these things to be the way they are they are for a purpose and as we've been hearing you know i've so enjoyed the message i believe brother david our pastor preached probably about a month ago now but it just stuck with me and i've been incorporating part of it into my sermon so much is that we were brought into this time for such a specific purpose in so much that god put the attributes of himself in you so they could meet the need of the hour they were specifically placed in you because a deep is calling to a deep and now the deep lieth in you when the holy ghost comes in it makes us a bow now that deep that someone on the street is calling for you can meet that need you were called to fulfill that as much as moses by god himself was called and said i've come to deliver them but now i sent you why he had placed in moses an attribute of deliverer and now he says moses i come down i put it in you and now it's time to manifest that attribute so it is with the people of god the bride of jesus christ right now you we me brother david brother billy all that are called bride are the culmination that the climactic point of everything that god has been working for since the garden of eden and the devil would love to steal that from you by making you think that god's not in control of the situation god everything that god is doing is for your benefit every situation even when you mess it up even when you do your best to bury it even when you do your best to throw the wrench into the gears and break it all up it is working for your benefit because my scripture tells me that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord and then just to support that point we had a prophet that came and said even if you choose his permissive will he will work it for his perfect will so how can you lose you can't lose god had called you to be pride he's called you to manifest the culmination of all these things and as much as we fight against it it's going to happen anyhow it's going to happen anyway there ain't no abdicating this throne there's no just giving it up you can't do it it was called because you know what as much as sometimes we beat our heads into the wall the lord chose you because he knew he couldn't his first choice was the choice he stuck with he chose you brother branham said he can't switch from his first choice because if he did it means he made a mistake and god doesn't make mistakes so you are not a mistake brother and sister you are not called to this truth you are not called in this hour for a mistake jesus at the wedding in canaan remember what he said he's remember what he told him when he drank the wine that jesus turned water into wine he says he says you saved the best for last everybody else puts the good stuff out first you know that's how it is you go in for a job interview usually you throw out all the good stuff first and then you try to hide you know maybe you had a poor job performance you try to hide that later you try to blind them with all the the good stuff up front get them get them all happy about it and then you oh yeah you know i had this reprimand here whatever it might be not so with god god saved the best for last he said you for last you are the best that god's got to offer and this now that we don't that's not to build us up and to be prideful but the point is is to recognize who you are because see how the devil we've been talking about it last time how the devil he plays both sides of the argument right he's always there to play both sides so the whole time he's fighting you saying you there's no way you could be bride there's no way you could be bribed there's no way you could be bright and then and then you reckon god made me this i'm making a rapture and now he says well you know you're not that's not that can't really be true because you know look at you look at what you did look at this and look at that if you were bride then this see now he starts to agree with you well yeah you say your bride but what about this see he's never gonna let you go so the point is is we have to completely you have to ignore it it's hard to ignore when that man right in front of you in the mirror every day looking at you you wake up with your own failures you see all those things but it's time we blinded ourselves to our own failures and looked only to jesus christ see it's not about he's made us more than conquerors more than conquerors and it has nothing to do with your ability absolutely nothing to do with your ability the point is is that god has given you grace to where you can accept his ability to do it that's the difference that is the difference is to be able to accept what god has done for you you can accept his word or reject it that's what cain couldn't do he could not accept what god was saying it's time we accepted that god has called us to this hour for this moment and he didn't just put you here to be a fifth wheel you are part of it brother and sister you are a you are an important piece you can we can't make it without you if you're struggling out there thinking well nobody cares about me nobody cares you're just this insignificant part of the body i tell you what we all have bodies i i don't care if it's the skin on the bottom of my foot if i scraped it and part of it came scraping off and i'm bleeding i'm gonna feel it i'm not gonna enjoy it i want it back i want it healed so even if you feel like you're the most insignificant little part remember the scripture says if one part of the body hurts we all feel it so it's been too many times we're so busy trying to put our own spin on what it means to be the bride of jesus christ but the bride of jesus christ is just called to manifest the word that's all it is we've tried to make it well our minds can reason out of the message but all it is is living the life of god every day living the life of god every single day and just when you fail you get back up and you keep going and you acknowledge lord thy word is truth i desire to walk in every bit of it lord give me grace that when i fall down to get back up lord help me to love my brothers and sisters help me to love my neighbor you see we've over complicated things right we think remember we talked about this before but works is not just the miracles it's not it's not just the supernatural it's the supernatural life expressing itself through the believer not always in a supernatural way of a miracle but insomuch as james says true religion undefiled visiting the widows and orphans doing the things that are necessary but we so many what did jesus tell the pharisees he said you left the one done when you should have done it and you let that go and did the other so many times we're so busy building up in our minds oh well in order to be part of the bride i got to be laying hands and miracles got to be happening but how many people are out there out of a true love unfeigned love out of the heart are out there visiting the sick and the widows did not brother branham talk about what about the sighing and crying for the abominations when he said that was the sign that was the sign of the seal lord help me i need i need more of that but we've over complicated it and the devil is right there to say see because you're not living up to this and what that is is just a fabricated reasoned image of what you think the bride is well if that was it then john sure missed it john the baptist because he didn't do no miracles had a ministry that lasted six months and didn't seem to hardly have any converts because of it and jesus called him the greatest man born of a woman see what god calls great man calls foolish and what we call what what god what man calls foolish god calls great oh the the hills will melt like wax and the the mountains will skip like little rams not knowing that it was it's not lawful for you to have her talking to herod bringing the word back to the truth and it wasn't some great natural thing even a great what it looked to be supernatural from the outside but it was supernatural nonetheless because it was the very god of heaven fulfilling his word the word fulfilled is supernatural when when you overcome the tiredness when you overcome the feelings in the flesh and you get down on your knees and pray for someone that offended you with a sincere heart not because you know you ought to do it but when something moves on you and say i love that brother or sister i love this person i'm gonna pray for him i'm not gonna stew i'm not gonna sit there and hold on to a grudge or whatever it might be an art that's supernatural when you can overcome this flesh that's supernatural brothers and sisters because that is literally the spirit supernatural overcoming the flesh the natural even supernatural itself will go intellectual is a compound word super above natural it's above the natural so when you put the spirit the super above the carnal the natural that is supernatural the miracles are going to come why because he promised it no matter remember brother branham had to say it all the time because he was preaching to pentecostals that went over the edge into into sensualism and all about feelings they went so far over the edge they had to reign them back by the grace of god they're the only ones that accepted him for a while but then he had to reign them back and say look you got you got so far into to what you call manifestations into what you call feelings into what you call supernatural that now you'll accept someone with blood coming out of their hands instead of the word why because they miss that the word being fulfilled is supernatural so we're called to be the culmination of all these things see god works in ways so far beyond your reasoning you're gonna look and sing to the world you might as well just get used to it you already do you showed up here when kovin's raging you already look crazy since just the truth if if they saw us right now held the part whenever they'd come in and say you guys are nuts maybe we should start arrested people or something i don't know you don't think it'll come to that i don't know it may probably will at some point may not be coveted but it might be covet 35 i don't know but it's coming because it always comes down to that that government's always trying to push itself down and make itself but we got to get out of our own thoughts because i just read this i have a few quotes here one from the power of god in 1955. i love this he says don't try to outwit god god works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform pharaoh the hard-hearted demon-possessed man was killing every jewish baby because the devil had anointed him brought the king of them in raised him educated and fed him and besides that brought his mother over for a nurse for him amen that's what faith will do the mother saw that by faith she saw that that's the reason she went down there and stood and waited for her daughter to come call her to be the nurse see she already had it in her mind because god had revealed it if god reveals to you tonight that your sickness has gone through the atonement just as that revealed to that mother it's finished amen the power of faith she placed her baby right in the jaws of death think about that think about all the alligators that had to be in the river so the natural mind would say you're going to take it from one death and put it in the hands of another but that's what faith will do it doesn't look at reasoning it doesn't try to figure it out placed him right smack in the jaws of death i like this he says sometimes trials are brought upon us thank you brother praise the lord he says sometimes trials are brought upon us people say oh i wished i didn't god if i'm a christian why'd this happen brother branham god let that come upon you so he could show you show his love to you so he could prove to you i am the resurrection and the life death says i got a right the king's commission is to drown all the babies put them in the ocean she said i'm putting them in the ocean or in the waters under this by revelation i have prepared a way of escape amen and she laid him in death and faith brought him out and made him the son of pharaoh's daughter and made her the nurse see how god did god altogether was working to his own glory and just putting it right under satan's nose and saying i just want to show you how blind you are satan put the baby right under his face and made satan feed him and take care of him and nourish him up for the very man he was going to destroy the whole nation and lead the people to victory hallelujah oh our god is marvelous have faith stronger than death certainly faith is stronger than death i want you to think about it next time you're thinking about that loved one you got in the world oh don't worry pharaoh's just raising them up to destroy them you think you think it's out of god's control no god knows exactly what he's doing god knows exactly what he's doing i've seen bro brother sisters there's a brother i know that he's been in the world for like 10 years now knows this message you talk to him even after he's just out there doing whatever he wants and he knew he knows the message is right he'd still witness to people he's still bringing he would still be bringing people to church pointing them to the church when he himself wouldn't go you don't think god knows what he's doing yeah it may look a little rough from the outside but i'm going to tell you what god is in control you don't have to know how it's going to work but god is going to do it he's going to do it he promised he would so that's all for the bride that ought to be enough come what may it doesn't matter because why because this is that culmination time this is that climax we're working towards it's just see god he's a great he's a great drama artist see all these they put the movies out there with the superheroes and the things that they do you know they always talk about the three acts of a of a thing you have the the i can't remember what they are now but there's something it's like conflict in their resolution or however they do it and there's always that point where the hero's standing up against unspeakable odds and then they overcome who do you think was doing at first brothers and sisters see the lord loves to make to make it look like all is lost why because he's showing his glory he's showing his humility that just so he so he can raise himself up and show this is who i am i am the great conqueror i am the mighty conqueror i am the healer i am the deliverer see it's all about jesus christ he is lifting himself up and he wants to use you to do it so don't worry about if it looks like your back's against the wall don't worry if it looks like all the odds are stacked against you that's right where god wants it to be why do you think gross darkness upon the people the world's getting darker and darker many many many more are the children of the bonds woman than the children of the free many many more and it's getting smaller all the time why god knows how to set it up just right he set it up did he not set it up with the lord jesus it's him against see the whole world to the point where no man stood with him at the end only one john from afar watching and he died alone it looked like oh but then he raised up on the third day and you know what you want to know i was just thinking about this i never thought of this you know nobody saw the actual supernatural event of the resurrection that's how humble god is didn't need to show a big show just roll the stone away let the angel sit there with the clothes the one you seek for is no longer here he's no longer dead but he is alive glory to god see the lord knows how to do it just right see even in his greatest moments god shows his humility oh my you think about think about moses we just brother branham was dramatizing it just a little bit there but look at how insane it looked all these things look at look at how many times it looked like moses might have had it figured out no doubt he'd sit there in pharaoh's military schools no one god raised me up to be a deliverer i've been taught i know i'm a proper child i know who i am see he even knew who he was and had confidence in it at least enough enough natural confidence that he tried to fulfill it himself and then he falls flat and goes to running from his own commission and it looks like it's all lost now what will our hero do now you know that what will he do it looks crazy but god is in control see like brother bram said he had to beat out all of those years of carnal teaching that's what he's got to do to his children a lot of times is get all of yourself out of the way so you can realize it has nothing to do with you it's all about him it's all about him the lord jesus manifesting himself in you that's what he wants that's what he's doing right now all these things going on this coveted 19 this election process riots happening all over the place it is perfectly designed for the people of god for the bride of jesus christ to be manifested all of these things are designed and bringing us to a place where the the climax the culmination of all of these things can be fulfilled for all these years we read that scripture in romans the the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god who in here is the son or daughter of god creation is groaning for you creation is groaning for me the world doesn't even know that the reason they're rioting that the reason they're in an uproar that the reason they have no peace is because they're waiting for you and for me to manifest god to this world they don't even know it but they're anointed well you think about it you even think about daniel and the lions dead darius loved daniel but something anointed him to put out this ridiculous decree because he was hearing voices from from his advisors to put this decree forth to worship why it looked it didn't look sensible but he did it anyhow and daniel says i'm not giving into that i'm not giving into that garbage i know who i believed i know the word that i believed i'm not going to bow down to some system i'm not going to bow down to some man or some creed brothers sisters that's the place we're at because i don't know i don't know what form it's going to take but you're going to get pressed even more than you are now these are just light afflictions these are just light afflictions and that's not to scare people that's not the point but to realize that we need to have peace we need to have comfort and confidence in god knowing that no matter that government can come and tell you to shut down right now it doesn't matter oh what was this why is this happening i know exactly why it's happening it's to bring out the seed of god that's in you it's to bring out that manifestation those hard times got to come they gotta come you know what the with i was i thought about this when i first moved to texas and we bought a house i never had a house before so i'm learning about how to take care of my lawn and all those things but see i grew up in the north and in the north in the winter time everything dies but not so in texas you got to be on that lawn 365 because i blinked and my whole lawn was just a weed jungle i was like oh my goodness weeds never sleep in texas and then i realized later it's because you guys that we don't have hard freezes here that kill everything so what'd it do i had to go and i had to pluck them all up i had to put the chemicals on there trying to kill them all and it took forever and my first year and a half that my lawn was there it just looked it looked diseased it was i felt bad for my neighbors because it looked so bad i had the hoa putting notes on me telling you gotta fix your lawn and i'm like you're telling me you think i wanted to look like this but the lord showed me a lot of things through that because we're like a garden of for god and you've got to tend to it we got to tend to it you got to pluck out the weeds when they spring up you got to keep it you got to keep it nourished you got to keep it watered but the one thing i found out is there's a few things that i thought were really interesting number one weeds do not like the sun they thrive in in ideal conditions when the temperature is really nice and mild and they get a little bit of sun but not too much it's not too hot they get a little bit of rain that's like that kind of like that hotbed plant that needs to be pampered all the time that weed it's it's really easy for weeds to spring up when things are easy because we get lacks we get we get a little bit lazy we're not as we're not as vigilant you know when you when you're at war someone's on guard and it's wartime and they're out there in a post to watch over the base and they know it's wartime oh their eyes are peeled they're like a hawk they're like an eagle just scanning the horizon they're ready to go they're a real watchman but you get them in a time of peace oh we haven't had a tax for here in a long long time you'll catch them sleeping on the job and that's what we got to be careful of we've had it so easy in the natural most of us we have places to live we got plenty of food to eat some of us too much i know i can say that because i've been there you know we have vehicles to drive we we have jobs god has blessed us so abundantly but it's just like the scripture says when gesture and wax fat he kicked and we have to be very careful to guard against that so what happens if you fight when weeds start to grow so you know what you got you got you got pesticides to take care of the weeds but that's not always pleasant why because sometimes it puts stress on the real good grass and you know that's how it is sometimes when the pastor's got to get up here with a real pesticide and start smacking around those devils that he can that watchmen can see and sometimes the other people all the other brothers and sisters are kind of it kind of hurts a little bit but it's for the good you got to get those weeds out of there and then that you know what they don't like too is they don't like that hot texas sun you know as soon as that hot texas scum sun comes in it starts to burn all those weeds out they are starting to wither and die thus those trials that's those tribulations that we just got a little bit of that going on right now don't let it wilt you don't don't you're not weeds you are you are pure you're those lilies you're you're like reverend lily you thrive in that sun you you soak it up why because it's bringing you to a ripening it's bringing you to a fulfillment it's bringing you to that place but it gets dry and those weeds see god puts us through those trials and those hard times to burn out those weeds to start clearing to start figuring out lord what's going on but i tell you what i found out in all my research they said the best way to take care of weeds in your lawn is to have a healthy lawn to have a healthy lawn if you have a healthy lawn that grass will just it'll grow so thick weeds can't even get there that's what i want to be i want to be so healthy so so thick with the spirit of god when that little those little roots of bitterness try to spring up that holy ghost just quashes it right there it just chunks out everything the devil throws at you so how do you do it first you got to get in the sun you got to soak up the sun soak up his presence get in the presence of the sun get in prayer then what is it then you got to get some water you got to get a little washing of the water by the word you got to you got to soak up that water soak up this word soak up the teachings that are coming from from the prophet that are coming from your pastor soak them all up and then what do you got to do every once in a while you got to throw a little fertilizer on there sometimes those trials are going to come yeah it doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong like brother branson sometimes god just wants to show something to you sometimes he just wants to express something to you he wants to reveal a little bit more of himself in you that you didn't even know was there but he knew it and just like we talked about he has to he has to tease out he has to he has to draw out that attribute from you that you might not even know what's just way deep down inside but sometimes it takes those deep trials you know and that was the other thing i found out too is that another way that they clean out those lawns is they scalp them they mow them down to about a nub like a quarter inch and what does that do it strips all those weeds down to nothing and the weeds can't live like that and the sun comes and scorches them but the grass can persevere how many ever been scalped by god before i've ever been mowed down really low where god needed to get some things out of you i've been there god will mow you down sometimes you say lord why am i here he says it's about time you came to me i'll tell you all about it but it's all for a purpose god isn't just doing things willy-nilly the world wants to paint a picture of god to be just some doty grandfather perverted thing that is just playing with humans like they're just little play things that's the world's new version of god that's this cruel well why would god allow these things why does he do this and we've understood through the preaching and do different things it has to be because god has to have a contrast to work on has to have that contrast but he god isn't doing things just to be cruel to you he's not allowing things in your life just to just to because he enjoys suffering but because he's got to build character in you because he's got to root some things out because he wants to express himself to you so that you can express him to the rest of the world that's what he's doing it's not without a purpose it's not without a cause he wants to see the manifestation of the sons of god and in order to do that sometimes he's got to lay it low sometimes he's got to bring you high but it's all for a purpose that's why paul can say he said whether you be a slave or a free free man he said use it rather if you're a free man be a free man for god if you be a slave be a slave for god so it doesn't matter what situation you're in you can rest assured that god is using it for your good well it's because it's all working to a culmination it's all working to that climax it's all working to a rapture to a body change all of it is working and working all these things are driving towards a singular point the coming of the lord a rapture to taking away of his bride so with that goal in mind persevere you can take chastisement as a child and not as a bastard why because we know we have a revelation that our heavenly father doesn't chastise the way the world chastises the world chastises because they want their child to shut up because they're tired of hearing the whining because they want this or they want that but not so with god whenever god gives you a little spanking when he puts you in a situation it's for a cause and for a purpose lord give us the faith and the assurance and the love to be able to rest in that assurance because he's got it in control and you know what that's what the devil hates more than anything when you can sit there and the devil's just battering against your life because god's allowed a trial to come and you just put your hands up and say let it lord giveth and the lord taketh away but blessed be the name of the lord why because you have rest assured that he has got it all in control there's nothing out of his there's nothing out of his hands every time you're rejected every time the trials buff at you every time you fail every time you succeed god has got it in control it doesn't matter and it's all working towards something listen this from i think this was the quote i was looking for from the message look see because we're so busy looking for our own we're looking for our own ideas of what we think is coming but lord if we could just humble ourselves and accept the word in whatever way god decides to deliver it to you we get caught up in our own ideas but i like this brother abraham says it's not a joint church shake hands and a million more in 44 a new church a new building or a new something it was a new life that come by a supernatural move that they were looking for to happen how many of you are looking for something to happen we are an expectation but we can't like expectation morph into where we only ex we only expect it in the way our minds have gotten it see that's where the pharisees got to they could say we were looking for a messiah but when he didn't come how they thought he should come that's where they got in trouble and it proved they weren't really ready to accept it anyhow but see the child of god the bride of jesus christ says lord even if i don't understand it i'm going to accept your word even if i don't understand the situation i'm going to trust that you're in control and you're working all things together for the good of them that love god he says it was a new life that come down by a supernatural move that they were looking for to happen they knowed every certain season then come down and they waited he says now if it isn't going on all the time and we're on top of the house jumping around we feel well we'll leave this church it's cooled off what a nonsense how we can't wait abraham didn't wait he didn't think god had cooled off he waited 25 years then he seen the hand of god move they waited at a sheet gate for month to month for whatever it was for that one supernatural moving but they looked for it oh my they were looking for it and i really like this he says we find elijah kept looking until he's seen just the size of a man's hand now unbelief would have caught that right quick if that's the best you can do see how many oh my is that the best you can do that's what the devil's right there you feel that little tug on your heart god's gonna do something and the devils is that the best god can do surely he would have come down in some great sweep for the brother brandon can say that something from your heart caused you to lift your hand to defy all the laws of gravity shows there's something in you and yet we're looking always for these great things that we call great great things that we call great what was it the welsh revival one man where's the world's revival i am the welsh revival the welsh revival's in me god calls that great that's right but we want a million more in 44 we don't say it that way but that's the carnal mind thinking of it he says i love that he said now unbelief would have caught that right quick if that's the best you can do if that's all you can do well take it back but what was it he was looking for the supernatural oh he knowed only the hand of god could do it and when he saw that hand j-e-s-u-s he had f-a-i-t-h yes and when he saw it he said i hear the sound of abundance of rain what was it he accepted the first move oh my oh my that's what he's looking for is when he moves you grab it don't have to understand it don't have to come the way you thought it should but you jump on it when he comes by and he stirs the waters jump on it he's right there to give you what you have need of he's right there and that's what his brother brothers and sisters we think the rapture is going to be you know i i was thinking you know we sing i think there's the song you know i will run through a troop i'll jump over a wall all these different things well that's the way they said about john the baptist too wasn't it mountains will skip like little rams the hills will melt like wax and look what it produced if that's the case what's the what's the latter going to produce i'm not saying that's exactly what it will be i'm not sitting here trying to do that my point is get us out of our carnal expectations and have an expectation of only one thing and that is that god will fulfill his word that's the only expectation i want to have and not only that i'm going to be looking for it i'm going to be waiting for it and when it does come i'm just going to say lord give me a revelation to catch it and he will because he promised it he promised you that he would give you that revelation that the gates of hell couldn't prevail against it he'd build his church on that revelation he's going to do it he is doing it even now you may not see it but he's working israel didn't see all that was going on in pharaoh's house during those 40 years and they surely didn't see what was going on in the backside of the desert for the other 40 years but god was moving the whole time he was working the whole time so is it now oh we don't see this and we don't see that just because you don't see it doesn't mean it ain't happening because god is always working his purpose is going to be fulfilled unbelief is not going to hinder the promises of god doesn't matter he's going to do it anyhow it's going to happen he's bringing it to pass because he promised it he said the word has gone forth from my lips it shall not return to me void shall not return to me void he said i have called me a bride without spot wrinkle he said in the moment in the twinkling of an eye that last trump's gonna sound i'm an expectation for it i'm looking for it and when it comes i'm going to jump right on it why because he promised me he pro i believe he promised you amen hey man let's just stand won't keep you too long here he's building up to this culmination it's been all these times you look at brother branham surely nobody thought malachi 4 was going to be a hillbilly from kentucky you couldn't barely speak right which i still think is kind of funny because some of the words he still uses is better than our seventh grade education today you know but you think about it what it was back then you think about the intellectualism now it's not about that brothers and sisters god chose disciples that couldn't even sign their own name couldn't even sign their own name and we think unless you can recite every message every word and have an intellectual understanding no god will reveal it by his spirit he will show you listen to it that's why faith comes by hearing and not always by just reading i say thank the lord i think that what was that what was i think that was the story where he said he said i believe that he said i can't read it but i'll believe the cover he said the cover said holy bible he said i believe that if god can do that what's he gonna do for us he's doing it now he's fulfilling his word you you just stand at your position you stand at your post of duty he said if you'll be faithful and little you'll be faithful and much so if it's if it's a little thing now it seems like a great thing it may be a little thing now just to come to church and get in your position here be a soldier this is the barracks get to the barracks getting to hear the orders from headquarters we need that five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the church and he's doing it through the word through the holy ghost manifesting that word and quickening that word so be at your post and then when the orders come to move then we move he's making it happen i'm an expectation that he's bringing us to the climactic point and i love how brother david said it you know we had our candidate i made my vote for that candidate long time ago i only had to vote once and thank the lord i voted once and he reigns forever in my heart i love that the perfect candidate we don't have to worry about what this world's got what they're thinking of because my thoughts aren't with this world i'm looking beyond that whatever the lord gives us in this world he says use it rather for the glory of god if he's made you rich in lands or whatever it may use it for the glory of god amen he's doing it i believe it how many believe that how many can rest knowing he's got it all in control [Music] why because he's called you the bride of jesus christ to be the culmination of this age to bring us into a rapture that has nothing to do with being a prideful thing it ought to actually make us the most humblest people [Music] to say oh lord and to tell people tell people the lord has called me to get out of this place but he's given you the opportunity to if you can accept it [Music] they are to be so humble and so sweet and loving let's just trust the lord relax in that sense although we're pressing that battle we can relax i was telling i was telling some people it's a paradox we're constantly pressing to the mark of the high calling but at the same time we're totally relaxed it's we're a paradox to the world constantly bearing a burden for souls and yet at the same time completely confident that the lord's got it all in control that's why the devil hates you because no matter how much he could maybe see you get in that prayer closet and come out crying and and and burdened for things and then just get go about your business saying onward christian soul and the devil says i don't understand that yeah he can't understand it because he's not a partaker he can't be partakers of that as a paradigm i love that paradox the lord is faithful he that begun a good work in you is faithful to complete it amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father lord lord we just lift up the name of the lord jesus father you've called us to be a manifestation in this last hour to manifest your attributes to the world lord god to be a culmination the the climax of all these things oh god how you've manifested in small ways throughout the ages lord i believe it in the scripture it says that in the in the olden days you spoke through your servants the prophets but in these last days you revealed yourself by your son and now even even now you're revealing yourself in your people to the world and the scripture says that the light shine in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not so lord we don't get discouraged when the world doesn't understand us when it seems like everybody rejects us and our trials get rough sometimes because lord we know that we're abiding in that light as you are in the light and we can have fellowship lord with you in that light lord and we're resting in the light of this hour we're resting knowing that you've given us a word lord that we can hold fast lord a revelation that the gates of hell can't prevail against lord jesus i pray oh god that you would just lord give us courage lord jesus to continue fighting the good fight of faith to stand for truth oh god when all the world is going insane oh lord may we just stand firm lord on that rock of revelation knowing oh god that you've lord you're bringing it to pass lord and like the three hebrew boys even if you don't deliver in this manner we know he's more than able lord and we know that at the end here our greatest deliverance is to be delivered from this body of flesh into your presence lord at that wedding supper lord we glorify you we just ask that you would give strength to your people and let us go from this place lord and magnify the holy name of the lord jesus christ and in the name of the lord jesus we ask amen [Music] i don't know that song [Music] oh maybe i do not he's got it he's got it all in control he's got it all in control [Music] how many of you leave that this evening let's sing it again he's got it all in control he put that reassurance got it all in control i've put my life in his hands [Music] let's just see that one again i like that every road i walk now oh i put it on [Music] nothing catches him by surprise yes jesus [Music] knows [Music] he knows [Music] one more time he knows what we have need of my father knows what i [Music] and am everything i go through he knows what's best for me my father knows [Music] hallelujah man amen you know brother randy talked about the culmination you know the final uh the final event i just thought of the countdown that's what we're counting down to aren't we i like that statement that that brother branham made he said but god in the spiritual achievement is going forward not going backwards he's going forward looking into the word and believing the promises for the things that never has come yet amen for the spiritual revelation to manifest the spiritual things that god has promised amen don't you want to be a part of that church what a wonderful word tonight for the lord and and maybe just take a moment to bow our hearts and our heads and maybe just rededicate our lives to putting god first in our lives and [Music] putting his plan in achievement and renewing our fellowship with him renewing the abcs in our life and and look to where we can apply the token and the lord's inviting us this evening he's not condemning us for our past he's not correcting us and punishing us but he's inviting us into his fellowship inviting us in to be a part of what that he wants to do and inviting us into that final culmination that the final work and if you just deceive me would just like to lift your hand say lord i want to play my part give me the spiritual revelation that'll bring the manifestation of the promise in my life i want to play my portion i want to be about my father's business i want to be adopted and placed to do what it is that you'd have me to do lord if i can do more i ask that if i've been faithful and little make me faithful and much father if there's little foxes in my life i ask you to remove the foxes that my vine might be fruitful father i don't want to be on the sidelines anymore lord i want to be pruned that i might bring forth much fruit i just ask that you to bless the people father i know it seems like the enemy's thrown a big dark blanket over everything but we know that there's light that shineth in darkness and that we're not going to let a bushel basket cover our light but we're going to let it shine that the good works may glorify our father in heaven we ask these things in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray hey amen there's there's a song i don't know very well but just like he knows my name i'll sing that as a dismissal song amen you believe he knows your name amen he knows you amen you have a maker so he made you right praise her let's just sing it as you are dismissed tonight god bless you thank you brother randy amen [Music] my [Music] his hands he knows my name he knows he sees his age have a farm no matter where god bless you pray for sunday going peace [Music] them [Music] so you
