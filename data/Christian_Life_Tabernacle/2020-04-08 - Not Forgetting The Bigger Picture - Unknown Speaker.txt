scripture says for forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as you see that Day approaching well we certainly know that we have an enemy that's going to do everything he can to break the Word of God amen I hope that the sound is loud enough for those that are listening online and we're happy to be here tonight let's pray and ask the Lord to bless us amen father we just ask you to bless us this evening as we just stopped in the middle of the week Nordic doesn't even seem like it's weeks just seems like all the days just seemed to run together and every day seems to be the same the father were grateful that we can be together in spirit father those that have taken a few moments this evening to stop what they're doing and father getting on together and join us in gathering around your word we ask that you bless them and that you take them in the palm of your hand and you comfort them always remind them that you'll never leave them nor forsake them and father will be here one for another we're going to stand together as a body Lord Oberg is going to wait on your hand in your will whatever it would be father wherever you would lead us we just want to follow it have our hearts and our lives in your hand we ask you to guide us this evening in Jesus name we pray amen amen Lord bless you tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like to turn to a couple scriptures one fund in the 6th chapter of Hosea and we'd like to read there and then we'd also want to turn over to the Book of Revelations and read from the lady Elsie in church age so let's listen to this call and I just kind of like to draw a parallel a little bit of this call that Hosea is making and kind of compare it to the day that we're living in now and I I don't normally title my sermons but I'd like to talk talk on the topic tonight about not forgetting the bigger picture don't forget the bigger picture and it's easy sometimes to get bogged down in details but let's don't forget the bigger picture and so we like to read this scripture found in FEA 6 and 1 come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revived us in the third day he will raise this up and we shall live in his site then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his goings forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain under the earth o refirm what shall I do unto thee O Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness is as the morning cloud and as the early do it goeth away therefore have i hewed them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and they and thy judgments are as light that goeth forth for I desire mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings amen and let's turn over to revelations and three and 14 and let's read a few scriptures here tonight together and all this is very familiar to you I know but because there's all these seven church ages this is the one that we have to deal with yeah and so and it says under the angel of the church of lady osya write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works and that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that that were cold or hot so because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because they'll say if I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may s be rich and white raiment that thou may us be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness does not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may a see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and he will sup and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcome and set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches Amen father bless your word god bless you you may be seated you know these scriptures are a marvelous prophecy and we can certainly identify the characteristics of our country of the world of the time that these scriptures are referring to and as we look at this and when I talk about don't forget the bigger picture I think when we realize this we got to understand we've got to look back over the last ol if I could say the last 50 60 70 years maybe the last 100 years of our country and we've got to understand the progress that we've made and and the increase that we have had in the blessings that and the riches that now surround man I believe it was one of the brothers just ministered here not long ago but how far that we've come in the last hundred years from horse and buggy to automobiles to planes to sending satellites in the sky how we went from the Pony Express the instant messaging and and this great accomplishment that man has accomplished and so we we see that the great picture that is starting to be drawn here and so when I talk about not forgetting the bigger picture when you begin to understand that it's in these last hundred years if I'll use a good broad swipe of the brush is that man begin to move away from God that that's what man did he became less and less important in their lives man began to turn more and more away from the Word of God they begin to change what their values were what their morality was things begin to slip into the church and we begin to realize that the church began to get into a Sodom condition and and in his scripture says as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so there was a picture drawn in the scriptures and scriptures even this portion of Scripture was written by John envisioned on the Isle of Patmos so many many years ago that he could actually begin to describe the characteristics of the age the condition of the people the condition of their thinking and and that man was going away from God their goodness began to be like the morning dew it was gone and so no longer was the people holding to the scriptures and holding to the Bible but man begin to put their own interpretation on the scripture they begin to take away that they felt was right and a way that was good and they began to discuss that way amongst themselves and they began to come to conclusions and and they begin to come to consensus of what was right and what was wrong and it wouldn't even go back is so long to where that you would never ever see a Christian woman in a pair of shorts I mean it just would be something that would be unheard of and they didn't have to be a believer of this message they didn't even have to be Pentecostal it was just their morality of their conviction to what was right and and we realized that as this world began to work on and destroy the morality of the people how Hollywood begin to spring up in the forties and television programs and music began to be able to go over the air they begin to condition the standards and begin to bring down the morality of women we did a study and we were talking the other day with the brothers and they better mention this song that was sung I believe way back in the 20s or early 30s about rolling down little girl rolling down and if you would go listen to that song and you look here that this is going out and it's sowing seed into the people's mind it's sowing a thought process into the people's mind it's trying to change their understanding of what the position and the place that it is and it's not the place that man put things it wasn't the place that the preachers put things it was the places that the word put things the positioning of God being the creator and how that he made things and how that he wanted them positioned and the position that he wanted the the sisters to play the positions that he wanted the brothers to play he wanted men to be providers he since the fall he wanted them to work by the sweat of their brow to bring forth of the earth and defeat and he wanted the woman to be sanctified in childbearing these were not things that man said up these were things that God said up and a woman was made that way and in turn spirit her spirit lean that way but if someone wanted to change the world and change the nature and change the thinking then he would begin to work on those things he would begin to preach his philosophy he would begin to preach his his way to try to get women to move away to get into the workplace to let their let their morals down to to get them to the place where that I have a right I'm equal and I have a right so you've got to see that this was the country begin to move this way men were moving away from God and because man was moving away from God and churches he wanted to be successful they began to count their success by members instead of by birth that it was no longer important that a person was borned again and and that their life was coalesced had a marvelous conversion and a marvelous translation and there was something that took place in the change of their nature no man wanted to start getting lukewarm that was a condition they were going away from God they were abandoning the principles of God they were abandoning the Word of God and they began to substitute their thinking for God's thinking there are interpretations for the interpretations of God's Word men didn't even wait on God to interpret his word they draw the conclusion and they got a consensus and and if two of them decided or three of them decided they began to form groups and in the condition of it just became to such a terrible place that God being rich in mercy sent a message like he always did every time Israel would move away from God God would send a message to him he even knows ie told them come back to me come back to me if you don't come back to me I'm going to send your captivity back to you come back to me if God's always had a plea to men to come back to him come back to me return back if and that's the desire that that God has and so he he calls out to men and and the voice that God always chose to call out the people all through the time and in this last day he promised that he would send a voice to return the hearts of the children to their fathers to return us back to the principles of God to turn us back to the things of God and so when we began to look at the the bigger picture we've got to recognize the day that we're in and we've got to recognize what the message was from God took the days could that we're in and and you know the way the church was heading it was getting cold it was getting formal it was becoming more towards pleasing of men than pleasing of God they had to change things so they can get members because they begin to compare themselves they begin to want to have big buildings just think we have as many here tonight is any great big gigantic building across this city they're just storehouses for pews and chairs and screens and Technology they're just as bare-boned tonight what a sign what a symbol what a what a start look from God's viewpoint what he really thinks about buildings what he really thinks about systems what he really thinks about organizations he doesn't want sacrifice he wants the knowledge of God in the heart of the believer the knowledge of God's Word the truth of God's Word the Spirit of God living out lit candle a burning light the say the works that I do shall you do also didn't want a church that takes the sign of the believer away doesn't want a church that rests they're very eternal destiny on what they believe who wasn't a church that rests their eternal destiny on who they've meant that they know him they know him for the God that he is they know him for his word before he is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and even Jesus speaking to the Jews he said if I would have not have come and preached to you then you could you would be without sin but because you say that you see he says now you have no excuse you're without sin so you've got to recognize the bigger picture this country this world this civilization this end time was leaving the presence of God and coming under the influence of being agnostics and also coming to the fact that Satan was setting up his Eden and he was now becoming the god of this evil age he had succeeded in hacking God up into three persons he had succeeded in putting a nickel ad in spirit to govern the people don't forget the bigger picture excuse me I'd like just to read a few statements if I could just out of the the radio see a church age and em and this is a good book for maybe if you have a little more time at home and or you finished your work at home and and you have a few moments take this lady OC in church age and read it read it as he speaks of it here he says now we just read the scripture in lady osya he says I know thy works doubt that are neither cold nor hot I would that you are cold a hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth now so many times we take that scripture and we think it applies to works you understand doing good things well there's many of people who don't even believe in God that would outshine many a Christian as far as good works there's people who don't believe in the Lord who are donating and putting their lives on the line to be fighting this disease that's striking the country so it's not that it goes deeper than that listen as we read this he said the word is supposed to be in our mouths too we know that the church is his body it is here taking his place now that's the definition of the church going to all the world preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe the church is here taking his place to preach his word now watch the condition of the church watch the bigger picture the Bible hasn't changed the prophecy for the age hasn't changed the scriptural morals haven't changed Peter hasn't changed Paul hasn't changed James hasn't changed the book of Revelation hasn't changed the Bible hasn't changed it's the way that man reads it that's changed now we know the church is his body it's here to take this place what will be in the mouth of the church the word first Peter 4 and 11 If any man speak let him speak as the Oracles Word of God If any man speak let him say what the word says if any man gives his opinion on a subject let it be a word based opinion if any man is going to make a judgment let it be a word based judgment if anybody's going to treat his brother or his neighbor let it be a word based treatment the word is what should be in the mouth of a person because a word is a thought express so the thoughts of God should be in the believer so that the word of God will be in his mouth but when they took the thoughts of men and they took carnal interpretations and they weren't fervent to the Word of God fervent on fire for number one first source of anything what are you gonna do what the word says what are you gonna do in this situation what the word says what advice are you gonna give what the word says how are you gonna act how the word says so it says that and he says if any man speak let him speak the Oracles the Word of God first Peter 1 in 22 for the prophecy came not in old times by the will of man so what's now happening the bigger picture it's the will of man is pushing out the Word of God man has now set their own course they think they've set their own course but it's Satan building and Eden it's Satan who wanted to exalt themselves above the stars above the messengers of the church so he's exalting his thinking his religion his morals his attitude what he thinks his prosperity over the stars or over the message of the Word of God but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit then what is wrong with these people of the last days they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it I'm going to prove that right now so the bigger picture is what's happening to the church the church now is being influenced by the world they're establishing their own rights they do see a people's right my right to do this my right to do this my right can worship God the way that I want to worship God my right to believe and now here's the government they're right behind that but God's not gods not as we read yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her look at the bigger picture now okay he's going to confound at this world with his prophet in his bride because the voice of God which is the Word of God will be in her no I don't have to go that way no I don't have to do this I am NOT going to leave the Word of God I am going to take the Word of God if they can threaten what you want but if God be for you who can be against you if you have the Word of God in your lips and you stand for God God will stand for you I have not seen the righteous baked bread let Satan's whole purpose it is to discredit the Word of God to make the Word of God of none effect this is what they're doing they've left the Word of God they're not the mouthpiece of God they're their own mouthpiece yes it is for it says in the last chapter of the seventeenth verse the spirit and the bride say come and may I say that it has to be the two together it can be the bride just reading books and quoting tapes and from some academic intellectual standpoint it's got to be spiritual food-induced seasoned seasoned by the Holy Spirit season by real experience season by a born-again life that's quickening that word and making that word alive coming out of your mind into your mouth and being the spoken word in the last days because they are the voice of the last day and the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as it was in the first stage you have to understand the bride and the message is the same thing there's not a message and a bride the Prophet was the mouthpiece of the bride amen it was saying what they believed you might have not to believed it yet but when you heard it you already had an Amen built inside of you and you said that's true that's right that's the way it is so if it's not two voices it's not two lives it's not a different spirit by one spirit into one body we are all baptized now he has cried out in this last age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but what are but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces don't you think that if there's one true word and one true spirit and men were under the birth of the spirit and under the leadership of the author they'd be saying the same thing but because they're not saying the same thing it cannot produce a spiritual unity it can produce a political unity in a world council of churches just like we got a Democratic Party in a Republican party and a libertarian party and all kinds of parties and they all unite but they're not united very strange time he said but all you do is you hack it into pieces all kinds of different doctrines all kind of different teachings one contradicting the other and everybody trying to hold the people in not by an experience but by a gymnasium by this program by that program by mothers day out by babysitters my schools by this so in-person ways something they don't wait by the Word of God they waited by worldly benefits now remember this is the bigger picture this is what the church is doing it's blind miserable poor wretched and naked not worldly poor spiritually poor not worldly blind I've got an email from this company and what they are is they're a company that keeps track of every new person that moves into your neighborhood and what they'll do they'll immediately send you the information of this new person I only have one question do I have an exclusive no if not and everybody just becomes a door salesman knock knock I'm Baptist knock knock I'm Methodist not God they gotta have a sales pitch think I have something to offer they're no longer the mouthpiece of God they become their own mouthpiece can you imagine hi I'm from Christian Life Tabernacle I heard you just moved into the neighborhood have you been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are you free from your sin are you born again have you received the Holy Ghost have you kicked the TV out of your home have you applied the token and got rid of the rock-and-roll music has your wife taking her pants off are she still cutting her hair is she not adorned in gold things she does not painted her face like Jezebel now you wouldn't say it all like that but that's your message why because that's the condition the world's got into and the bigger picture was God sent a messenger to warn her that he was on the path to destruction we can't forget that this world has not changed their course they're on the same Road they've been on the only people who have changed their course is the elected seed of God they change their course because they heard the message they heard the warning they recognize their day and its message 10 forgets a bigger picture you can't forget the world is still hidden he says you don't do nothing about it you says he says you divide it and hack into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want oh that's what I said Sunday God's good God's wonderful God is a blessing he blesses me he provides for me oh he's may deliver he's my healer yes he keeps his word that's his side of it but take the other side you just can't take what you want and leave out the instructions to womanhood the instructions to young ladies the instructions to young men you can't you got to take all of it that's why the word says if you take any part out of it or add anything to it your name is taken out of the book of life let us just read on you leave what you want you are not interested in living it but debating it I would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected I could stand it if you would get white-hot and know the truth and live it I would praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it and in return must refuse in return I must refuse to honor you I will spew thee out of my mouth for you nauseate me can you can you see the the picture today you can see the bigger picture they claim to be spiritually rich but they have no impact on the community more people are in churches and yet there's more adultery more people are in churches and yet there's more drinking more people aren't churches and yet there's more juvenile delinquency there's more drug addiction there's more alcoholism people have abandoned the church and they take it on psychiatrists and yet they feel they have God this message was God warning us telling us I counsel thee I counsel thee buy of me gold tried in fire put on the character of Christ put the Word of God in your mouth if he sends a messenger to tell the people what God seen God's viewpoint you think you're rich but God don't you think you increase with goods but God don't God's been just and loving and kind to send a vindicated word of warning and judgment so that man could turn their hearts back to God and if they reject it then what can simply be said we can't forget the bigger picture we can't we can't lose the understanding of why that this message came in the first place it didn't come to produce a bunch of young theologians we got guys not 40 years old there's such knowledgeable scholars in the things of God what happened to the backside of the desert experience I really enjoyed something I heard brother Bissell say in a testimony he said I grew up I didn't have nothing I didn't have the father I didn't have a mother I didn't have any good things wasn't a pity party he said if it was those things that I went through that prepared me for the mission field people are prepared by the Spirit of God you're not prepared by the books and the tapes in letter form you're prepared by hearing the Word of God and the Spirit of God quickening the Word of God and giving you the revelation of transformation it's not putting this bride together don't forget the bigger picture we know it's election we know the message was sent to a people that would hear it we know they're the bride but what their call is is to put on white raiment character tried and fire works that are worthy of the word of God we can't forget the bigger picture we can't forget that where we are and recognizing the day and it's message the bigger picture don't forget there's no need of sitting around and keep patting one another on the back and praising one another we have got to know whether we possess the goods what goodness that they do to say who we are if Satan can walk through our door any time he wants to if there's no birding for lost souls there's no hunger to share this word of God there's no seek in you least if this is the days of sodom and gomorrah we can be like abraham and beat our word into plowshares and go out and find our lost brother but have we got to the place that we just disputing doctrine and terminology and everybody's trying to come up with a better vocabulary to explain the mysteries than somebody else sometimes I feel like Paul must have felt he said I went up there to their big meeting and they didn't add anything to my revelation why he had meant the author when they were talking to brother Branham and they were discussing all this stuff they said oh brother branham you don't know your Bible yeah but I know the author real well we need to get back in contact with the author of this message back in context it's the spirit and the bride that say come look at where we are and the Gentiles are called out the bride is ready the rapture is at hand can we realise that can we actually believe that is that a story that's been told is it a myth to us is it something that sounds real is it something that we outside can be leave or is it something that's in US that's a part of us that's more than life to us Ricki nice the message he said is it something that we can believe on the outside but is it really part of us that's having the word in your mouth because that's the thought you express what proceedeth from but the abundance of the heart and the mouth what proceedeth from the mouth comes from the abundance of the heart listen what that question is look at the bigger picture let's don't miss what it is that God is wanting to see believe me he already explained this message through the messenger I don't care how you put the quotes together you're never going to teach it and explain it any better than he did we don't need an explanation we need a revelation is this something we come we outside can believe or is this something that's in us that's a part of us that's more than life to us what attitude do we set in this morning in this Tabernacle remember it'll be a small flock that receives it think of it think of the God of this evil age think of Satan's Eden think there's a man that can turn on the light who do you say this is think of all the effort that he went to vindicate the message to get the people in this world to understand they're drifting away from God and are we going to go back and build the same thing let's pray the Lord help us the seals are open it's revealed to us we see what they left off you want to debate and fuss about serpent seed and water baptism and so forth you're blinded and don't know it the god of this world has blinded you to it and you don't know it wonder I have such a time this morning fighting them pressures so has he chopped out his bride from the denomination by his word promised by Malachi for in the last days chopped out his bride pewter from the rest of the churches hewed out his bride he chopped out his profits through with his profits by the word chopping Israel separate yourself from the rest of them what time is it brother what time is it minister do you see the time of the day and the sign you're living under can you understand it do you see it in other words are we missing the bigger picture have we lost what's happening and what's going on and start dwelling in two pages and doctrines and mysteries and teachings are we starting to be more impressed with what how a sermon is delivered and the emotion instead of the true value of God's Word everywhere now there's no revival everybody's complaining ministers crying I was reading one of the outstanding papers that comes here to the church a very fine paper and now I know the editor I know the people and they are godly people very fine brothers and sisters more The Herald of is coming one of the finest papers on the field Herald is coming but they hardly print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray well I wonder if we've just substituted fast pray with this is who we are this is who we are we're yet where the bride were the one know until it's manifested it can be disputed it can be questioned it's not a self Proclamation it's an identification given by the Spirit of God on an anointed seed of God that identification belongs solely to him to identify his ride it is not given to the ministry to identify the bride it's not given to the ministry to send a pep-talk it's not given to the ministry to explain it's given to God to quicken the seed this is the rising of the Sun sound the trumpet how many reads it you know see it's all all the time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's a great thing going to happen all you pray pray pray we're not too late yet why do they do that I say they do that because they missed the bigger picture they missed what God done in this day they missed the church in the world has left God read lady you'll see it's urgent they left God but he stood at the door and knocked on the heart of the believer personal why did you do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride that's not past or future tense that's a personal awakening of the bride you've got to recognize your awakening you've got a recce and I said I'm not part of a church I'm not part of a movement I'm not part of the fellowship I am part of an awakening a word of voice a message cried out to me and I rose up the resurrection started in me with the shout the voice the Trump and I've been quickened and made aware and I'm a part of an awakening not a movement not a teaching not a doctrine I think we're way too intellectually awoken and I think a good refilling would help us all they they don't recognize the awakening of the bride see by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done oh my you know what's been done to you that's the blessing of it I know I've been awakened I know I've heard the cry my sheep hear my voice another they won't follow I saw the path of the world my eyes were given I sad and I saw and I put on right Randleman that the shame of my nakedness didn't appear I bought gold tried and fire that I could have character and the love of the Spirit and the love of God shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit I recognized the day and its message he says that's what makes him feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you you know there's a lot of talk about we know you can't listen to the news you can't read a newspaper I signed an email today yours in you know yours and bondage you know or law I said yours in lockdown you know lockdown 19 just 19 I told the guy the other day it was really gotten a mess I said oh you've been 19 and I thought what they're looking for is they're looking for a cure they're looking for something and you know what they do they found out if you can take the blood of someone that had the disease and you can take that plasma and put that in the person they will become immune and I thought you know something I don't want lady OC yeah I don't want to become immune to Lady hacia and that what the prophet of God said he said the church is getting into spiritual amnesia because they get hypnotized by the little things and they fail to stand back and realize what they're a part of you're a part of the Great Awakening there was another Great Awakening I believe in the Philadelphia of age but this is the greatest awakening of all time a man I don't want to become immune to Lady osya I don't want their blood and their philosophies and their ideas that make me immune to the infection of this age I want to sit back I want to step back I want to see where I'm at see the day I'm living in recognize what God's been doing and ask the Lord Lord what would you have me to do pray for revelation pray for the leadership of the Holy Spirit pray that we could be about our father's business let's don't look don't lose the bigger picture this may come and this will go a man will feel they've got the victory but they haven't because they didn't realize what they were fighting this is a decoy Jesus says don't fear Him who can destroy and deliver your body but fear Him who can deliver your soul into hell we've got to fear the world and where it's trying to take us and recognize the awakening of the Word of God come out from amongst or my people and be ye separate let's don't forget our Awakening let's don't forget the love of God that he had for us that he would get us out of a boat get us out of a road get us out of a path that leads to destruction why it is the way to destruction and many claim to be on it and those that are on it claim to have God they claim to be worshiping God and they think that they're blessed when they're really headed for their own destruction but yet there was a narrow way and few be that find it few be that recognized it few be that was awakened into it aren't you thankful for God don't you love them those of you at home oh I just try to look out over here and pitch for your faces you know oh patrol Jomon they're raising his hands praising the Lord hola sister sharif was she sits up here all the young sisters the brothers I get to shake their hands the different ones scattered all the back those all back there are big baby crew in the back you know but they can't take what we're a part of away from us if they close the churches which they have for all practical purposes I count maybe just about nine and a half here and this is for the recording and but we're still together we're part of something that's real we're a part of an awakening praise God let's don't lose the bigger picture that we're a part of something that's real a man Lord bless you and those of you that's listening if you know you can email me if you have any questions or anything I think I'm going to use a email for church questions and stuff I think that's David McGarry cement senior at gmail.com and so you can email me questions about things be more than happy you can call me I sit at home a lot you know and I hope you're all well you know I talked with brother Isaac he's a Dallas police officer and and he's probably at work now he said brother David he said we don't make traffic stops all I said so you're working in North Dallas I said I'll go there and speed around the little he says we don't make traffic stops he says all's we're doing is domestic arguments all's it is is getting one person wanting the other person to leave and they can't go nowhere he says how what are we supposed to do he said I got a call for a girl that wanted me to put her boyfriend out of the house get him out of here and her name wasn't even on the lease he says I can't do this stuff their hands are tied that's what everybody doesn't get along the way they thought problems come up well that's the law of contrast the law of contrast was given so we could make an examination of where we are what side were on what we're a part of so god bless you reach out to me let me know you're okay you know even if it's a little note saying brother McGarry we're all well we're all happy we're all fed we're all going in the rapture we've all been awakened we all love the message we're doing our best to live it just let us know how you're doing we care I'm not good at social media if you get a text from me it took me five minutes to do a two line text I mean I tried the other day to do what Cosman doesn't use two thumbs I can't even move my thumbs like that it's every letter and then it's pressed how do you spell this then go write it down on a paper go back to my screen type it in you say well they got spellcheck I can't even get it close enough that spellcheck works but it doesn't change what's in my heart we can't we can't run what's in our heart through technology you can only put what's in your heart by the atmosphere that you create because the word of god the word of god not man's way the Word of God says let the love of God be shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit this don't forget that by the spirit the spirit and the bride say come god bless you let's stand together brother Billy would you come and lead us in a little bird at home if you have something on your heart a prayer request if you just lift your
