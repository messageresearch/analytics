Description:
Revealing The Father That You Might Do His Will
The Christ of God Pt. 2
Br. Ron Peterson
September 22nd, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

sisters um some of the brother already know the testimony but um in uh business they tell you to do bullet points if something's long and anybody that knows me knows if I get excited or nervous I might talk too much so uh Lord uh this is a testimony and a praise report to the Lord um for what he did for me and uh I'll just try to get right to it um about a year ago I was coming to church uh in July of 2023 and um I looked over my shoulder backed out and uh backed out and somebody was going too fast and rear ended my extera and as part of my job I um I have to drive for a living so um they said it was my fault it was on my personal vehicle and I knew that would affect my driving record so um I tried to fight it but they said at worst it would be a 50/50 accident even though the person was probably doing 20 or 25 M an hour in uh my apartment complex um so I told my employer and she wasn't too thrilled about it but a couple months later I'd been out all night um somebody was I think called out or something so I sometimes we go out at night and do X-rays and um I told them in the morning that um I was really tired I should probably take a few hours and they wanted me to go out anyway so um I was in a vehicle in apartment complex turned it too closely ripped the front end of the vehicle off so two accidents in a very short period of time and uh so essentially the employer had told me to uh um she basically pressured me into just saying they're going to call me they're going to and say that it was a hit and run and um so I just kind of listened to her and then um kind of went along with it for a moment and and then I immediately was convicted and I was like I'm not going to do that and uh so long story short um she was texting me and pressuring me to say it was hit and run and um I essentially she says she's a Christian and I told her you could bring this up to your pastor I could bring to my pastor we know what they'd say and um I said I'm not going to lie I'm going to tell the truth and she said that well when when we renew your insurance you might lose your job and I said well if it's the Lord's will for me to be with the Road Runner I'll be with the Road Runner and uh it kind of um affected the relationship with the employer since then so um couple weeks back the time for Renewal came up I don't know if she forgot about it but she said that um um she was calling me kind of freaking out and asking me some questions and anyway she said I had nine points on my record and she wanted me to go to the DMV and they wouldn't really be helpful without an appointment well the interesting thing is when I moved to Texas I had a California driver's license and shortly after um I think it was in 2022 I had got a Texas driver's license so I think all the points were going on to the California driver's license so went and got a print out uh it says you have no accidents or anything completely clear interesting I think that's in the sea of God's forgetfulness I don't know how they work but um so I get it it's I've got the records it says no accident so um and then I I heard something come over the pulpit right around that time it says it's not my business how he did it let go and let God so I was as a controlling person and trying to handle everything I can I'm I'm calling my insurance I'm calling them I'm I'm getting frustrated I'm trying to get answers and I was like you know what Craig just and I thought about how faithful God's been in my life and how he's even when I was in very sinful States my life he's um he's pulled me into the CFT of The Rock and and just shielded me from trouble even when I was wrong and so anyways um there was this it was the time and um so they were literally litigating about whether they were going to be able to keep me I forwarded my copy of my driver's license what the printout was and I asked some of the brothers brother Roger brother Jeff Howard and some of the brothers at the brother brother brother Matt's um morning study to pray for me and a lot of scriptures just kept popping into my mind and I thought well Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if the same conditions are met he's going to be faithful and so um I'll just read a couple little scriptures I pulled out and then I actually posted but I just keep it really simple because y'all are better you guys have a very good knowledge of the word and I'm I'm still putting on the whole armor so to say say but the one thing that that struck me is that if we you know the word says that in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and so when we keep his word and we stay in the word he's going to be he's going to stand for us and so I believe that to be true and so he's our Rock and our strength he's our shelter in the storm and so I started getting a piece after the brothers prayed for me and I was driving to Dallas and I just was listen Rel listening to a message brother Billy was singing and I just I had a piece come over me in the car and I just knew I had a revelation that whatever it was it was done and and I even posted to the brothers that um regardless of the um regardless of the outcome that I'm trusting in the Lord for his will in this matter God bless you and thank you for your prayers so I think because I stood for the word that the Lord stood for me and I just want to read a couple um scriptures because this is stuff that he says in in his word whosoever therefore shall confess me before men I will confess him before my Father which is in heaven but whoever shall deny me before men I will also deny him before my Father in heaven and then in Psalm 62 but there I'll read something before that verily I say unto you whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever soever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything they shall ask it should be done for them so that my father in Heaven may be glorified where two or three are gathered in my name there I'll be in their midst so I just was just trusting in the the Lord I had Brothers praying um in that moment and they were actually talking to the insurance company and um like I said the interesting thing is that I got the print out and that my Texas printout with my Texas driver's license from 2022 before both accidents has zero points on it so I thought that was wonderful so I I don't know how God did it exactly but I think that he just cast all of that into the sea of the forgetfulness and as of this moment as far as I know I have a clean Texas driver's license and I'm and uh I had the the assurance that God was going to have my back I stood for his word he stood for me and uh he's faithful and just and I just wanted I just feel that testimony was for somebody and uh the other day um I was listening to a message and a sentence came in my heart in my mind dropped into my heart why haven't you given my testimony not mine but his and and so I believe that was from God and I believe that was for somebody here I'd already shared this with some individuals and so I'm I get very nervous when I speak in front of people so I just wanted to um to share that with you brothers and sisters and um I'm not going to read Psalm 62 and Psalm 46 um but I will say God is our refuge and our strength the very has uh present help in time of trouble um and I don't fear anymore and so I I know that he's um he's had his hand over my life for about four or five years now and I just I'm so thankful that he plucked me out of the world so I just wanted to thank God and praise him for what he's doing and um I I was wondering if um maybe brother Ben could help me with a song that I love but I'm not really good I don't have the right voice for it I'm down from his glory could you help me with that when anybody wants to sing along I just um I I love that song and I've always wanted to sing it thank you brothers and sisters I don't know what key you guys sing it in whatever you down from his glory ever living story my God and Savior King and Jesus was his name

faith and revelation we ask you to bless it to us this evening in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen I I enjoyed brother Craig's testimony I had a great big old record too and then one day I found out it was all clean that was pretty good and he didn't give me old man-made insurance he gave me blessed insurance and that day I I like that there kind of policy don't you one that's blessed and the one I got naturally they raised the price all the time and then they kick me off of this and kick me off that but um um I'm grateful I got a clean record and Blessed Assurance it makes a difference and I didn't get a chance to welcome everybody but um uh it certainly uh nice to have our friends from Arkansas the sister that sang today and I I come to find out I knew her Grandpa I said I know your grandpa and then and this is yeah this is this great grandchild I said oh my it's good and then and also I have a real good friend named uh Ray Robson and his grandson I believe right is that right I can't believe it anyway and uh so he's with us so I I appreciate all that and any others that are with us I know there's some from Phoenix and different places were grateful you enjoy the word this morning amen you believe God's got more of it yes amen you can just uh I guess you just can't eat enough of it can you just just that that's it's just that good anyway so we're not going to uh we're not going to carry any longer we're just going to have brother Ron just come right up and uh we have a saying when you every Minister that comes up to the pulpit I always say one thing to them without fear without favor amen we want the gospel don't we without fear or favor we want it just the way that it is we don't want it directed you know or try to uh say something to pin flowers we just want the word because that's what'll make take us in the long run so just nice to have you with us brother Ron God bless you Lord bless you Freedom the Lord God God bless sing that's special yeah I'll sing it solo you can hear thank you musicians God bless you let's just remain standing I'd like you to turn with me if you would in your Bibles to St John chapter 4 amen I told David in the back office I said uh for those of your church that fact checks everything that I said uh I said that the the the word of the Lord uh 200 and some odd times even in the New Testament that is incorrect there only there's only 30 13 times in the New Testament 234 in the old uh if you fact check that maybe I might be off a little time or two but that's okay when you're my age you give a little bit of Grace sister Elizabeth God bless you your husband met me this morning I'm Elizabeth's husband you know Elizabeth stiny I said who don't know Elizabeth stiny I said she's very popular anyway God bless you sis good to see you yeah yeah as your face turns red there we I'm going to read here from St John 4: 25 through 26 the woman saith unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ and when he has come he will tell us all things and Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he may God bless the reading of his word you all may be seated this evening in the presence of God Amen now we had stopped there this morning in our first uh part there we we talked about how Samuel the word of the Lord came to Samuel and it wasn't known to him the word hasn't been revealed to him at that time understand that the revelation of God comes in a due season and a due time brother random said that God keeps all his appointments and he is going to keep as an appointment with you he's going to reveal things in due season even to you now you have to understand that when you are a child you think as a child you speak as a child you understood as a child but when you become a man so there Comes A Time In spiritual uh let's say relationship and growing up and spiritual maturity that you begin to catch things that you didn't catch before and so it is even with our Bible and with the message of the hour I am absolutely amazed at when I listen to tapes now I read my Bible now it takes on a whole new um emphasis a whole new understanding yes I read it before yes I've heard it before but now because I have a greater mature understanding it's revealed to us in season so we thank God for that amen even Jesus told his disciples he said look I have many things yet to share with you but seeing that you cannot bear them now how be it after I'm gone you'll begin to catch these things and I will have the Holy Spirit bring to your remembrance everything that I've spoken to you so I want to take and uh I'm not going to take a whole lot of time here uh tonight with you and and hold you too long but uh let's uh take uh let's call this the Christ of God part two and I want to take a subject and a subject the reason I give a subject is I'm going to go in a certain direction okay so if you know the direction in which you're going it's it's sometimes good for the people and uh so I want to call uh the subject revealing the father that you might do his will revealing the father that you might do his will remember now that Jesus told us so many times look I did not come to reveal myself the son can do nothing except the father reveal it to so he says my job is to come and to reveal the father understand when eternity breaks into that great realm when we go from mortality to immortality and we begin to understand even to know him as he is known you will have a such a greater understanding at that time right now you have a partial reality and God deals with you he's moving you from the understanding as a child into the understanding of a man and so you begin to catch things that you didn't catch before and so um we know that this anointing this Christ of God again like I said that it was the name Christ was never used in the Old Testament it's only used in the New Testament and yet brother brandham comes and says look it was Christ and David playing out his part he said this great Bible is a drama and it has act one scene one in the beginning God so we began to now see that God has this great drama and then it comes down into our day and understand we are playing out a drama right now every one of you have a position excuse me and that part is an extremely important part just like a watch has many parts to it and the parts that are the most important are not the parts you see it's the behind the scenes it's the mainspring it's the little sprockets and things that keep moving but understand you say well I may not have a great integral part yes you do even the Bible says do not the the comely parts do not th those That You Don't See play a very important part and when one of those suffers the whole body suffers is that correct and so we understand how important it is that each one of us pay uh play an important part now if you've ever watched an orchestra and you watch the great Maestro and he gets up here and he's orchestrating and uh I happened to see one time and uh a very well-known Maestro we were in the country of Vietnam and uh we had a day before we were leaving to go home we had been preaching there in Vietnam for about two weeks long story short we went and said hey we have tonight off why don't we go see this this great music musical thing that they were putting on I've never seen one and so he comes out they introduce him he comes out he bows to his orchestra he bows to the people and he he's got some kind of little pencil like thing you know tick tick tick tick like that and he turns around to his orchestra everybody and now as he begins to orchestrate the music I want you to understand he was the music he was only orchestrating each one and you would watch he would do certain things like this and he would over here and he'd tell them okay come up like this he point to another and Sh and everybody was playing their part and so it is in this end time we had a great mestro a prophet of God telling us that each one of us have an integral part in this great Symphony or this great drama you must Play Your Part the little Piccolo does not have the lead in every part of the music and every stanza but when he is to play He's supposed to play and I remember right at the uh cresendo when everything was coming to a head and you could feel it and the m like this and his hair is moving all over he's just going and he points to I think it was the lead violin and like this and this guy stands up and I mean he set that thing on fire he was and just going and going and it was coming to a great cresendo I want you to understand that we are now this brother R is saying look this is it this this is greater than the creation this is greater than Genesis 1 in the beginning God created this is the cresendo of why he did the creation this is why he went to Calvary this is why he shed his blood this is the crescendo because this is the whole wrapping up this is the final finale and just like the fireworks that you see on July the 4th and they boom boom boom but the the climax of every fireworks is the last minute and all of a sudden you hear and all a sudden and the whole sky lights up I want you to understand brother Brenham said look you you read uh the seven Church ages because it lays a foundation for the Seven Seals and he said like a um Roman Candle a Mighty uh burst of Illumination coming forth boom in the first church age second Church age boom Another illumination until finally we come down here to the last Church age this is the cresendo and burst after burst of Illumination until before our wondering eyes 11 or 1200 sermons come into a pattern and we see Christ and we say oh my God it was not just one sermon it was not just one Revelation but Revelation upon Revelation sermon upon sermon here a little there a little and as it begins to reveal itself to you and you understand your part and you begin to play your part because it's so important until you know your position like I told you in this morning brother R said when the true church catches the true Revelation now there when you say when the true church there must be a false church and catches the true Revel there must be a false Revelation you understand there is a paradox and so it says when she begins to understand her position and so it is we as the bride of Christ I want you to understand that now with this is not the orchestration of man this is the orchestration of the Holy Spirit and he is now the great Maestro and what's amazing is the brothers in Africa in the Philippines up in Canada around the world Ministries are catching Revel ation that they've never caught before and they're not sitting here sending notes to one another nor are they streaming one another's services I don't need to stream other Men's Ministry I want to stream his ministry by way of the Holy Spirit understand what I'm saying I'm not against that but I want to be under the main channel of inspiration of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit alone is the divine revealer of the word of God therefore without the Holy Spirit you'll not catch what God is doing now this anointing that we call the Christ brother Bram said now be careful on the on the level of anointings he said you can have the anointing of the Holy Spirit on you 24 hours a day in your soul black as night and on its way to hell he said depends on the outer Court inner Court holy of holies Body Spirit Soul so we see you can activate the gifts of the Spirit anointing on the spirit Caiaphas prophesied we see those things and so you understand it's not just the operating of the gifts brother Brenham when he came one of the hardest things now when did the seven Church AIDS the seventh Church Church age when did it begin what year what year did it begin 19 what 06 you know that I'm this is not I'm not trying this isn't school you're not going to get an F CU you flunk because you missed okay 1906 when was brother Brenan born 1909 so he was already Born Into the lysan age which now remember Pentecost started in 1906 and it went like a wildfire gifts and anointings and talking in tongues and all kinds of manifestation of the spirit and they said this is the latter rain and brother Brenham had to come and wean us away from former teaching to say this is not the latter rain because the mor Reign the the the former Reign had not yet come so he's weaning us away from what we call Pentecostalism tongues and interpretation and all this stuff and manifestations brother Brenham so much of the time and he get up and start to preach and like that and and then all of a sudden then he'd say well thank you Lord and everything and how could he correct all of this stuff that wasn't his home church and Gifts were operating thank you Lord we appreciate that and everything but then he would tell his Brethren he even told Brother Billy Paul and I got the chance to travel with him and he said one time there was tongues and interpretation and brother brandham told Billy Paul he said that brother that spoke in tongues and the one interpreted he said I had the translation of the tongues that that brother was speaking and He was cursing God now brother Brenham even there with Brenham Tabernacle he said okay I've let you play with the gifts all these years it's time that we're going to put them in order okay and what caused Junior Jackson and Don rutle to split off they were the sister churches what caused them to split because brother Brandon put Church order put it in order he said okay tongues and interpretation we're not going to have it anymore we're going to take the gifts in the back room I'm not here to teach you all this stuff I want to take you in a certain direction that brother Brenham is weaning his church away and if I could say this the whole Church age away from all of this former teaching so he's got to bring us back to correct teaching that we might understand this anointing that is called the Christ because the rain falls on the just and the unjust so he said you don't judge it by the anointing don't judge it by the signs judge it by the word many of them have called them elves Apostles and are not and we have found them to be Liars he said now that's a bold statement to be said he said how is it then that you judge the people he said it's not you judging them it's the word judging them that's why the word is our absolute the word of God is our absolute the message of the hour if we could say this is our absolute also because his absolute was the word brother Brenham we uh that is such an amazing thing that that it could be the uh 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation or whatever he said oh no my brother that would be adding to the word he said what it is is God's revealing what's already been in there but it's been hidden so this woman received the Messi sign it's one of the few times that Christ revealed himself personally to a individual we said the one woman the one that speaks to you is he now she goes and tells everybody hey come see a man what a stir she runs into the City come and see a man that told me all this so let's let's kind of drop in now into this part of the scripture and it causes stir he discerned my heart told me everything and it wasn't until they heard themselves from The Words of Christ himself catching the logos thought of God that they actually then became Believers not because someone told them to come and see but they came and saw themselves all of you got this by a personal revelation though somebody told you come and see somebody gave you a tape and book somebody shared with you but it's when you had an experience with God that your eyes come open now on the road to emus which means Earnest desire you have two disciples after the crucifixion of Christ and they are now sad and downtrodden got long faces and the resurrected Christ comes and he walks along with them are we together in the scripture now okay now he's walking with them why are you so sad what what what's going on haven't you been around here what this man we that we called Jesus we we thought that he was the Messiah and all of this but you know what they crucified him and we're upset and and now we're in fear of our lives and we're downtrodden and and everything and he began to take the scriptures concerning himself and he began to lay the scriptures is it not written and every they and it it caused what I call heartburn because they said did not our hearts burn within us but it still didn't open their eyes understand here is the resurrected Christ the one that they had seen and heard preached and he's walking with them but he's now in a form that they don't recognize him and so now he's walking along with him sharing the word their hearts are burning and yet they don't know who it is and he made the Bible says he made as though he would go further you know God is Con is is not stagnant he's constant like the sun from east to west it doesn't stop it's constant you understand and and so God is a constant one moving that's why you've got to move with him you got Revelation now but you need more tomorrow so just like a teacher okay you did good you passed the class for sixth grade but now you got seventh you can do better than what you did on 90% of the test you see good teachers Inspire their students good teachers in any school have got students that want to hey get into Mrs Smith's class get into John Brown's class because let me tell you they Inspire and every one of you I will have all of you to witness this that you had teachers in different levels of your schooling you don't remember them at all you don't remember their name but you remember the ones that inspired you you remember the ones that had uh something that quickened inside of you that that the that told you hey you did okay but you can do better get up off of your get about getting in and getting into this business and we had a his history teacher she was amazing she said I'll tell you what if you can guess who I am she would dress up and she would only she would come out and she says the whole class can be dismissed if you can guess who I am comes out with a robe and says just some line at two brute who was it and if you didn't guess it guess what okay well then let's open up your history books and let but if you knew and one person knew the whole class got set free thank God for those smart people let me let me tell you when one person in the church begins to catch Revelation it causes others that's oh my Hallelujah because you know what faith energizes faith as iron sharpeneth iron I want you to understand there are some preachers that preach real well and boy I tell you what that they the Eternal rainbow and this and that and on and on and they preach and they're so on fire and they speak so fast I cannot even think as fast as some of these guys preach much less think about how does a Translator translate and I telling you God and you're going my goodness and sometimes you come out after the service wow what did he say uh uh hold on hold on uh give me a hand give me um I don't remember what he said but boom my man he was inspired he might have been so inspired but if he was up here and it doesn't transferred to you it did you no good now I want to ask you on brother Brenham sermons when you listen is it so high and so above you you never caught it wow he was so deep he was so spiritual I couldn't catch it no brother brandham if he taught something and he talked about how many of you know he got a sermon off a cigarette pack and the remember he's walking along and he sees a cigarette pack a cigarette pack and the the voice tells him pick it up I ain't going to pick it up he's arguing I ain't going to pick up the cigarettes they're filthy no no go back and pick it he picks it up a thinking man's filter wow hee preaches a whole sermon on a thinking man's filter and he takes natural filters spiritual filters the word of God's filter on and on and when you got done you understood he talked about a filter and he said now God's word is a filter and he said we just don't take and let everything that comes through it because from Genesis to Revelation if it doesn't line up if the umum Thum doesn't light up by revelation from Genesis to Revelation let it go so a lot of times it there will be so much information and since when do we think now I'm not against this please do not take me wrong but but is anointing have to be loud I want to ask you when you're in your prayer closet and you have a real intimate time with God do you scream your prayer I will tell you and I'm sharing with you now a little bit of me personally when I have something so on my heart and I'm burdened and I'm in my prayer closet before God there are times I can't even say with words oh oh God oh God and moanings and groanings that cannot be understood is a language that God understand and I speak intimately to him in a broken contrite spirit he said a broken and contrite spirit I will not refuse sayi God so I remember I'm just giving you an example and please forgive me if some of you are from Germany and you speak German or whatever but I was over there from 84 to 89 with the voice of God recording and I remember we were in a German church and I will just kind of give you an example of how they would ask a brother to pray brother so and so come come and see here and they come up and they start very softly for and and on until God screaming and yelling in Jus am man sounds like a Pharisee he is known by broadening his fla trees by his long prayers reminds me of what was it pho's dying Ten Commandments remember that guy with it he got the lamp oh the son of Egypt you are dying and everything like that and Pharaoh look that old wind bag it is not by how loud you pray your prayer sometimes I will say the most effective sermons to the people are the ones that you understand and when you get done with the sermon you remember the sermon you remember the title you remember the scripture you remember who preached it you'll say back in 1984 I remember you were here and you preach thus and thus and I'll tell you that had an effect on me sermons that don't have an effect don't cause you to go higher sermons that have an effect cause you to go home to get closer with God to get into that intimate detail I'm not against I myself am an emotional person but when the Holy Spirit came in the meetings of brother brandham how many of you listen to tapes I want to ask you when he when he says yeah he's been preaching he said okay now I said I just want you to all be real reverent I want you to sit real still don't move don't get up to go to the use the restroom he said you know what I'm waiting for it's him maybe I said something that didn't please him you all know I'm just and all of a sudden he says he's here now I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God and he says now don't move and brother Brandon preferred the organ over the piano do you all know that at the end of the service why the spirit of God is Meek like a dove and a percussion instrument okay you understand only believe ding ding ding ding D ding ding ding whatever right you got to you got to hit this thing but the [Music] organ he said he's here now he's Meek he's gentle like a dove don't nobody move all of a sudden that you you've seen in the movie there's a black woman woo oh oh brother Ram he's still and all of a sudden he said he's looking he looks away he keeps he says excuse me that colored woman right back here and she's standing up now she's not making a spectacle but God is there dealing with her heart he said the pillar of fire is right above you you see my brother my sister so much of the time we think that unless it's loud it's not anointed volume is one thing I believe in using volume but a still Small Voice and a sermon where the preacher is preaching to you to where you can understand it has an effect to where the even the little boys you can ask them what did that Minister preach about and if even the little ones didn't catch it there's something wrong so anyway the testimony of the woman stirred the people but I want you to see here now let me see here excuse me because I I didn't print this out in St John 4: 41 and 42 remember she's gone into the City and said come see a man that right who under the first and second pull told me all these discernments discern my heart and oh my came right so remember first and second pole are attractions third poll is not third poll separation because when did Jesus changed his ministry St John 6 when he said except you eat my blood and drink eat my flesh drink my blood you have no part with me and many of his disciples said this is the hard saying who can hear it and the Bible says and many of his disciples walked with him no more is that right what verse is that St John 666 mark of the beast and they went away so Jesus now he went after him he said oh me light oh in oh he began no did did did he go and chase him and say excuse me oh pardon me excuse him I'm so sorry I offended you come back here come I don't want you to eat my flesh and drink my blood I'm not a cannibal you know what he did he walked down there to his disciples does this offend you Peter does this offend you can you handle this why don't you go why don't you go also is this too much can you not handle it does this offend you you see the word of God revealed in its season can become an offense and they walked away this hard saying when brother Brenham changed his ministry and went from first and second poll they all left him Full Gospel businessmen closed their doors brother Ram said I sat in Tucson for 18 months not an invitation at the Apex of his ministry revealing of the seals but he's changing the administration you understand it became an offensive pull does does this offend you the word of God Brother David preached over there in Congo God's a separator oh you really believe that God's a separator as he did in the beginning Genesis 1 he separated light from Darkness God through his whole Bible separated and it wasn't until God had Abraham separate from lot lot you see kept Abraham back until he separated from from lot then Abraham got the promise when you separate from out of the world come be ye separate sayeth the Lord I will receive you so the final separation in this seventh Church age is going to be what Rapture to in bed to it work final separation I'm going to separate the foolish from the wise right and we can all sit here and say oh I believe we're all wise virgin we have the Holy Spirit I want to know do you have the Holy Spirit is he revealing to you or are you just so excited that you're part of the called well let's go beyond calling let's make our calling and our election sure lest we fall so the testimony of the woman stirred the people let me just show you I'm sorry I I I'm just kind of going here and there but I feel comfortable and I don't feel I have to impress you is this okay brother David okay St John 4 verse 41 and 42 and many more believe because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying not because of your testimony yeah you stir us come see a man but we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the word of the world the testimony of the woman caused to stir come see a man but but it wasn't until they heard themselves Christ speaking then they believed so it's been with each one of us hey somebody had to tell you hey God sent a prophet oh yeah well there'll be a lot of false prophets in the end time too yeah okay well just come and listen I remember my wife had been my girlfriend before we got converted into this message and I had backslid went away from God wasn't doing right she came over to visit me from Phoenix she lived in Phoenix I lived in San Diego salana beach she came over and I excuse me you forgive me it's part of my testimony I lit up a marijuana cigarette in front of her and she absolutely freaked out she said I'll tell you what I want nothing to do with you if you're going to act like that and do the things of the world she said I don't want a boyfriend that's going to be dabbling in that kind of stuff okay so she cut off that relationship she flew back to Phoenix and I thought yeah okay cool you know how you're you want to be cool all right yeah I guess that's not the one well when I get converted a couple weeks later in fact I'll I'll tell you I was at a meeting in Bird Rock Fellowship in Laya California I am still seeking I was raised up in California my now my parents weren't Christians never once we went to church together my dad was a jockey and third bread Horse Rising Jesus Christ was a cussw word I'm going to fast forward to a meeting that I went to in Bird Rock Fellowship in laa California and sister lesie wanted to hear it from my side of the perspective because I went there and there was a black man preaching and I had notes on a piece of paper from the surfboard shop that I was working at in enenas California or lucadia from Sunset surfboards and the black Minister said the church will go through the tribulation Enoch and Methuselah here's the dates and everything I wrote down all and I thought well I guess so I guess so at the end of the service there was a man that stood up and he said no he said well let me just correct something he said the church will go through the tribulation but not the bride he said th thus sayith the Lord besides that you're a false prophet you know who that man was he's sitting in he that Troublemaker over here this guy over here that's thus sayeth the Lord man I tell you this place blew up the ministers you have to seen it they were up on the platform and the host Pastor is coming to the to the pulpit to get the microphone and he's having no that's my PO let stop I'm going to say this of all he says as long as it's brought in love we can listen to any man's doctor yes love love love love love what the world needs now right this is the Peace Love Jesus movement and so everybody oh yes love love so the man's they made him sit down but the man stand sitting next to him his name was Ron McCain and he stood up just as Meek and as humble as he could and he said I'd like to bring to you the doctrine of William Mary and brandham and it was a a bigger nuclear explosion and they said of all the ministers in the world we will never allow the doctrine of William Mary and brandham be brought over this Pulpit or taught no matter if it's brought in love or whatever and I thought wait just a second you just said if it's brought in love we can listen to any man but not this man and so I had a man sitting next to me I said hey who is William brandom he said I don't know and I said I'm fixing to find out well guess what I get converted and within two weeks I go to somewhere where we're going to play a tape and guess who's sitting guess who's sitting in the corner of that room the Troublemaker the outspoken guy that's why I love Brother David he's not a politician but we came into the message together and by God's grace we'll finish together huh now I want you to understand that Saul when he was on the road to Damascus there was an experience that he had remember he's he's he is killing many of the Christians putting them in jail and 1 Thessalonians 4 verses 15 through 18 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord now here's one of those times that the word of the Lord comes that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which asleep for the Lord himself self shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together caught up together that word harpazo caught up let me say this if you're not caught up in this message right now you'll not be caught up in the Rapture harpazo to take with Force it's not your will it's his will then we shall that are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words do you know the the doctrine of the Resurrection was not found in the Old Testament no such thing they didn't have it so we picked this up in Romans chapter 8 and we see Ro Romans 8 ver8 if you want to follow along so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his but if this but if Christ be in you somebody say Christ if Christ the anointed word be in you the Dead the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you so the word of the Lord is not just an anointing but the anointing is becoming a revelation by way that we call the message of the hour it becomes a living epistle you take the book and eat it now Saul of Tarsus was on his road to Damascus and he has an experience before God he's on his horse and he sees a bright light brighter than the midday Sun knocks him off his horse and into the dust where he belongs and he says Lord who art thou brother Braham said any man knows that here is a theologian and he's asking because he was a Hebrew of Hebrews a Pharisee of Pharisees and he says Elohim who art thou he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest isn't it hard to kick against the Pricks and his eyes became blinded so now he cannot see sometimes God has to Blind you to open your eyes and then he Holy Spirit comes to a man called Anna anas ananas I have called you to go pray for Saul of Tarsus excuse me did I hear that right Saul of Tarsus isn't he the same one Lord that's been killing Christians and putting them yeah yeah that's the one I would say it took a a man of great Revelation I would have asked the Lord several times are you sure I'd have put my hearing aids on I would have done anything hey are come on now let's be real could you imagine knocking on Saul's door is Saul home I hope he's not yeah he's here he's waiting for you so all God sent me to pray for you lays his hands on him and the scales come off his eyes he started a work in that day by sending annias ananas to go not to ananas and safire another man could you imagine if that is a pyramid scheme man he just pushed himself every convert that Paul got in theas went higher you understand that thank God that there was a man that followed the leadership of God the message of the hour is not to stay on tapes and books otherwise everyone who has a library who has the possibility to have the tapes to listen to them everyone would have the same Revelation but it's not the ownership of Bibles and of books and of tapes that gives you Revelation my Road to Damascus my pastor Floyd Patterson who was the pastor of our church in Flagstaff he asked me if I would go to Europe and open up at that time spoken word do you guys remember some of you old-timers remember spoken word publication if you had to get books is it there anybody here remember spoken word okay there's a few of you spoken word was Roy borders who printed mid millions millions of books and sent them all over the world and stamped on the inside of that says and these books are printed free of charge and given to people around and they are the transliteration directly off the tape if brother Brenham stutters and God he said and but but uh uh that's what they like a stenographer in a court of law if he said and Moses built an arc and went through the flood you don't correct it you just print it because it's transliteration you understand transliteration is not trying to take out all of the little mistakes in thethethe and and verily verily or whatever so my pastor when Roy borders died took over spoken word publication he said brother Ron would you be willing to go to Europe and open up a spoken word office I said I'd be more than happy to Sandy how many names were on the spoken word mailing list when we went to Europe because now Europe how many people in Europe need only English books because what they speak French German Italian how many were there Sandy 43 on the spoken word meiling list because why sand in English book to a man who speaks French no no P English I don't understand English so anyway long story short we moved over there I was I think 34 years of age I think something like what was 31 just a punk kid 31 can you imagine moving your family and your kids over into a foreign country you don't speak the language we went over there and we started and started getting the books and started Distributing them throughout to the pastors the different ones that were on the mailing list now year and a half later guess what Brother Floyd gives spoken word publication to Joseph brandham and they changed the name what do they change the name to voice of God recording okay now you all have heard a voice of God recording okay so brother Billy Paul and Brother Joseph come over and uh they inherit a work that we we're already doing spoken word publication European office so Brother Joseph we knew what one another we knew one another by name Billy Paul and I we knew one another by name but it wasn't a intimate relationship I'd only met him several times Joe is about a year and a half two years younger than I am I'll be 72 in December so this guy's an older guy than me he's going to be 75 soon anyway we we go over there they inherit so Brother Joseph and brother Billy Paul come to us and they said brother Ron uh would you stay on as a representative and we're going to change the name to voice of God Recordings and we're going to start getting the tapes and books out to the people here in Europe would you stay over for another six months until I can get somebody else I said sure sure well six months turned into another three and a half years and so we worked with voice of God to help to start I told Brother Joseph at that time if any of you remember the printing of the books and most of us had a pretty good library of books and pamphlets of brother Brenham that came out from spoken word and we put them in our office and at that time spoken word had been printing some of the Dallas series Topeka series shreport series and it's good to have those they're they're nice but I Don't Preach from most books most of the time you preach from the what we call the meat sermons the ones from Jeffersonville what Christ The Mystery of God reveal what is the attraction etc etc okay so I told Joseph I said Brother Joseph these um Brethren over here um can you send us conduct order and Doctrine no they're there we don't have them in print right now uh how about the Hebrew series no they're out of print right now well what do you have the all available book list well we have the the Topeka series The Dallas and I said Brother Joseph thank God I'm I'm glad those books mean something but I said the Brethren over here need to get the books that they need to be able to translate it to the people so the people can hear the word of God in their language and so Brother Joseph um he and I I said now I'm going to share with you a very intimate relationship or discussion that I had with Brother Joseph and Brother Joseph knows and he and Billy Paul's passed away now you all know that he was there also and I told him I said Brother Joseph may I ask you a question before I go to work for you you yes sir brother Ron go ahead how do you feel about what your daddy said about you are you a prophet what do you believe oh brother Ron and he rolls his eyes like brother Brenham does in in the the film yes brother cops I'll be more than happy to serve our Lord in Israel and Brother Joseph goes oh he said brother Ron if I could change my name I would I just want to try to get the my the Daddy's message out to the people and I said so are you a preacher no no I'm not a I don't feel to be a preacher I said well do you feel yourself to be some kind of a prophet and he said I don't understand what daddy said Now understand I'm going to share with you and this can go back to you can send it some of you that are Joseph Believers send it to Joe he knows i' I had this conversation with him personally so it won't offend him we talked about it I said Brother Joseph may I share with you is this okay with you guys I said may I share with you how I see it I said there's three kinds of prophets according to scripture a major word Prophet major there are seven Church ages and there are seven stars seven Major Prophets I said and that prophet's already come the major prophet in fact in your seven Church age book it's blank it doesn't have the name brandom under the seventh star that's a fill in you put it there so the major prophet to this age was who William brandom then you have Minor Prophets brother Bram said Minor Prophets are um Ephesians 4 they are the ministry right Apostles prophets evangelists pastors St preachers right and he says we all know that a preacher is a new testament Prophet because when he speaks he prophesies propo one whom the word of the Lord comes to and I said and then the third position is there are prophets liken unto agabus and agabus in the book of Acts prophesies two times now brother Brenham said there are men like a un agabus who can and will prophesy and he said agabus prophesied about Paul he who takes this girdle shall be bound in Jerusalem you know the prophecy and another was a famine in the land he prophesied a Dar the scriptures said he said God can operate that gift one or two times and never use it again but he's still a prophet you understand that's a gift as a prophet so I said but Brother Joseph I said look I said instead of you sending all of the tapes over to me why don't we get a a duplicator do you remember the old duplicators where you have the master and the four slaves and you could duplicate a C90 in about five minutes put the master in put the empty blanks and they would hit and then they record and man you could just so instead of sending all of the tapes coming from Jeffersonville let me I'm your representative it's still a voice of God production let me do the tapes here he said no no they're they're not anointed if they're not made in Jeffersonville I said excuse me excuse me yeah they're not anointed unless they're from Jeffersonville so what I did this is the real truth I had a cassette from Harold hilderbrandt end time message Tabernacle from up there in Edmonton a tape duplicated brother Ram sermon I took a voice of godan I took them behind my back Billy Paul and Joseph are in my office and I put one of them in and I said now tell me which one is Anointed I said you're spiritual which one's anointed he said well that's not fair I said' wait a second you just told me one's anointed one's not he said well actually brother Ron the anointing is on The Voice I said you got that right not on who duplicates it not where it comes from now when brother brandom talks about a copyright he means copy it right don't do like they did in Arizona and cood he said there's some in Arizona that are cutting and splicing and making me say some no copy it right that's that's a Kentucky understanding copy it right he didn't understand all this legal stuff that it you know you have to have a copyright and all this and do you remember the here I stand you remember the picture with Joseph here I stand well pretty soon saints of God the message began to become polarized the people listen to tapes and people that hear preachers and it become to become polarized and it's getting worse I want to ask you brother renam said the final voice to the final age is not Revelations 10:7 he said the final voice to the final age will be the bride of Christ and they under their messenger saying what he said what's amazing is Brother David and I so much of the time years ago different ones were telling us say only what he said but they never said what he said but we got it drilled in our hearts say only what he said on tape praise God so now do you guys remember' Neil haliva with ego Computing man I tell you what this is a history lesson also well Neil haliva got the first uh all of the tapes and books put onto uh a computer and you could go and get uh folio views do you remember that that was the computer applic folio views and now you could type in with your old computer and you could take a computer and you type in the love of God parentheses and and that old computer it take 30 to 40 minutes for it to come up with all of the quotes because it's thinking and then if you had to print it out it it take forever now you can have it on your cell phone you can fact check me you can fact check anyone and you can see whether or not the prophet of God said it now I said those things in sharing an intimate detail with you I worked for them for five years in Europe finally in 1989 November of ' 89 we left Europe to come back to America because the voice of God had spoke to me when I say the voice of God I I had God deal with me and told me to go to Arizona to start a church go to Phoenix because I would have never chose Phoenix I would have chose Hawaii French poesia Tahiti Bora Bora some South Pacific Island cuz I'm a surfer born on the beach and thought you know I remember the first time we heard of a brother in Hawaii a pastor had a church in Hawaii do you guys remember that there was a pastor yeah we were at the meetings the December meetings um of 1972 and there was a brother his name was Lonnie Jenkins you guys remember brother Lonnie yeah he got up and introduced himself well he said well God bless you I'm I'm from Hawaii and my brother and I and Mitch Buckingham good friend of ours we came in the message together all of a sudden we all three got the Epiphany same time that's our pastor I can believe the message and go surfing Sunday afternoon so we went and talked to brother Lonnie after service he said sorry brother and he said uh I'm moving I'm moving to tuon the Bible says and let me finish with coming back to our thought the Christ of God because Galatians 2 and2 says this I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Galatians 4:19 my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you birth pains I'm not not wanting to birth a Doctrine a Creed a denomination I travail with birth pains brother Brenham I travail that you might be birthed in Christ sir we would see Jesus as I'm bringing this to a close 19 64 paragraph 29 why would you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God when you call those who the word came to Gods Abraham was considered a god Elijah was a god Isaiah was a God because the word of God came to them and they were in portion Gods Jesus said said they were he said you call them Gods paragraph 30 now you see when the man was anointed like Joseph he portrayed Christ when Moses was anointed he portrayed Christ when David was anointed he portrayed Christ all leading up to Christ and he was the fullness of the word the word was made manifest in him and he was the complete anointed Ed one who had it by portions we have it by portions he was the anointed one the entire plan of God was laid in him in a sermon perseverant 1964 paragraph 64 he is here tonight to vindicate to reveal every promise that God made for this age he's here to do it he was in the days of the prophets he was in Moses he was in David he was in Elijah he was the in the rest of them to reveal God's promise of that age God laed his word to each age and he sends a prophet and the word goes to the prophet and straightens it out and that's exactly what he's done through all the ages and he is God and changes not Jesus Christ Christ is the prophet tonight that stands Among Us he is the one here in the form of the Holy Ghost who knows everything and can reveal everything that he desires to do now let me musicians if you want to come I just trying to bring this place to a close I didn't really mean to Rabbit Trail and go off about voice of God those are very intimate conversations that I've had with Brother Joseph and brother Billy Paul I miss brother Billy Paul of all the men on the face of the Earth that was with and witnessed and saw more of the Holy Spirit and of God's Prophet preaching and saw more miracles and witnessed more things of the prophet's Ministry is now gone used to be that I could write him a letter Hey Brother Billy what was it like what what this and I'd ask him a question he'd turn around and send it to me were any of you in the meetings of brother brandham any of you here or where any of you ever saw so that means that most of us are not first generation we weren't there we didn't see it I didn't see it I didn't come in until 1971 I'm born out of due season but greater is he who has not seen and yet believed little did your pastor and I realized that when we all of a sudden got these tapes and we heard this voice come out from her my people be separate my you long-haired Ricky here we all had long hair I remember when I cut my hair I had shoulder length hair and so when I cut it I kind of had a beetle haircut and I thought I'd done God a great service I come late to the tape service then and come in and I came in I shook everybody's hand as we as the tape was going on but I came in a little bit late so I was shaking God bless you God bless you like that and I'm kind of brushing my hair nobody said anything nobody nobody said a thing and I I finally was so bold enough I went over and turned off the tape I said is nobody going to congratulate me because I cut my hair you know what they said no we expected that now shut up and turn on tape back on see a lot of times we think we do God a great service no that's your reasonable service been serving the lord in this message now since 1971 I've seen a lot of people come and go I've seen a lot of directions this and that different anointings come and it's all for a purpose but I thank God that he's kept me right in the middle of the road I haven't gone off to this and I haven't gone off to that but I've stayed right here and I've tried to stay with just the simple message but I know this that we're not following just the prophet we're following the Pillar of Fire which is the anointing hallu you understand that he said that anointing watch that logos thought that was with there the children of Israel they were not following Moses they were following Moses because Moses followed the pillar of fire so even Pharaoh said what kind of a leader would lead his people up to the Red Sea and mountains on both sides so that we could kill them all what kind of a great leader is that and there was Moses in a quandry till God said take your staff you've all seen it in the Ten Commandments amazing he takes his staff and he stand still and see the glory of God he Parts the waters they go overr you all know the story well you know who they were following because the pillar of fire went before them you know who we're following even today go ahead and play something softly sisters whatever is good for you [Music] [Music] I believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he changes not the same God that was with the children coming out of Egypt is the same God that we saw the same Pillar of Fire the same Works how many believe we are in another Exodus we are and John was told to come up hither Book of Revelation chapter 3 and I John was in the spirit on the Lord's day and the spirit said come up hither John I have to show you things Hereafter and I was immediately in the spirit come up hither John you know what God's telling each of us as bride members right now come up here come out from all of this unbelief come out from all of this denomination come out from all of this stuff come up higher come into the revealed word follow me in the fullness of what I want to show you come away from all of the false teaching and false doctrines follow me and I will show you things to come God bless you this when I never even got into the rest of my sermon there but that's okay that's okay I know [Music] this so I I told my girlfriend remember she cut me off because I wasn't and any any good Christian girl you young Christian girls if you start liking some boy and then he does something wrong and he goes into the world you cut it off tell him get lost adios Amigo right and she told me that but the first one I wanted to call when I came into the message I called Sandy I said hey Sandy come on over I said I believe we found a prophet I'm a Christian I've gotten baptized she didn't hear anything about a prophet or anything she just wondering what happened to [Music] Ron we come to listen to a tape that night she flew over from Phoenix to San Diego I picked her up at the airport we went to listen to a tape we turned the tape on good evening friends and I'm praying oh God open her eyes to see what I've seen and by the end of the table nobody told her about the way she was dressed nobody said anything nobody said anything about makeup and fingernails and all of that but from that day forward Sandy had a revelation that God sent a prophet and I'm very very pleased that she is my wife have we ever had arguments H not really [Music] arguments we've had some severe fellowship before never thought about divorce maybe murder but not [Music] divorce because you know if we're honest with one another that you know what yeah she's a woman I'm a man she sees it one way I see it another but I've never had to tell her to go take that dress off take those high heels off take this and that and people say well brother Ron I know why she wears flat shoes cuz she's 2 and a half inches taller than you no wrong [Music] n and I'm I'm thankful that God opened her eyes because when you see my wife you see me when you see a reflection of her because if I preach to you one thing and she looks like a jezebel something wrong that right so I love to take my wife with me I've been to many countries and I love to take my wife because she stands there as a standard they look at it and so God bless you all thank you it's a pleasure to be here with you I shared with you some things from my heart tonight that I don't really share a lot of places so maybe you can hold the tape David hold the the tape don't let it go out man I hope I hope you're not even streaming right now so nobody could how many of you know that brother brand had a he had a switch on the side of the the pulpit in the Tabernacle you ever seen the thing it says on Blank Spot on tape brother renham had the key switch that he could turn off the main tape recorders Blank Spot on tape let me tell you about that brother Blank Spot on tape yeah then you pick it ah he's a fine [Music] brother we didn't even know brother brenham's [Music] name we thought his name was Jeff from Indiana because that's what was on the end of the tape the Box the real toore Jeff from [Music] Indiana well Brother David we came into this thing we started listening and [Music] man just a bunch of kids didn't know nothing [Music] one thing we had was a desire to serve him to follow Christ took us out of California David went up into Montana we went up into [Music] Oregon who would have ever thought that God had take a hippie like you and take him out of San Diego and put you right down here in Dallas Fort [Music] Worth Whoever thought that God would take a surfer like me and put him in a desert like Phoenix God must have a sense of humor because if he' to sent me to French Polynesia I probably would have been a little bit loot like a lot you know yeah do you know that when you were given your choice in scripture if you're given a choice if you're not careful you're not spiritual you'll choose the wrong thing I'll choose the greener pastures I'll lean towards a better job a better place many people will change their church now and go somewhere where there's not even a church because they got a better job oh really when this is this is going home time this is when the whole cresendo is coming hey this election coming up you see the the left liberals how do these people how did this happen we might have a woman president I don't know I don't really care all I say is let me tell you this thing's fixing to real really start crumbling real quick and it's the prophet's fault cuz he preached a sermon called the falling apart of the world it's falling apart Israel anti-Semitism brother Ram said watch those same Spirits pre-tribulation Spirits Hitler musolini ikan pre-tribulation Spirits he said we're loosed against the Jews and he said those same Spirits are coming now and guess what they're going to come after the Christians and the Jews what's going to happen to the 144,000 they're going to get martyred what's going to happen to the foolish virgin that's left here they're martyred wouldn't you rather give your life to Christ now would you rather be judged now than be foolish because the fully said well my Lord delays his coming they don't get serious and they don't catch the Holy Spirit to seal them to the day of their Redemption oh if you don't have the Holy Spirit don't be caught dead without Christ amen I love you thank you for allowing me to just share with you some [Music] things I just want to be found faithful doing what he'd have me to do when he comes amen amen God bless you what's the name of this song here that you're singing come on up here my brother pour your spirit out on me fall just like the rain God bless you thank you for listening I trust we were somewhat of a blessing to you um God bless you till we meet again shalom [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen I know a lot of you don't recall all the lot of the terminology and and different things but you know if you go to the scripture you find out there was 11 hours and they went out and they the Harvest was great and they they got some workers to come and work and they said we'll pay you so much and then they went out and got more workers and finally they went out in the very last hour and found workers to finish the Harvest you know and that's what you are you're the 11th Hour worker he didn't call you you back in the days of spoken word and he didn't call you back in the days a lot of stuff has gone on a lot of waters been under the bridge and a lot of histories been made and you know a lot of the people that come up on all those hours they started grumbling you know how come these people are getting the same pay you know what the pay is it's eternal life amen the 11th hour work or the Harvest is the rapture so you might not know where you fit in all the things that have transpired but you just got to live for the hour that you live in you know you're that 11th Hour worker it's the same harvest the same word that Ron and I picked back it he's talking 50 years ago you know 55 years ago ago when we picked up these tapes it's the same tape you pick up and you get the same Harvest that we got now we can tell you all the war stories but you know where we are we're sitting right here tonight listening to the same word have the same absolute and the same decisions that you have you have the same access to pick the same fruit off the same tree and just think we've been picking for years and now here we are and you guys are picking Revelations that took us hours and hours and years and years to come to but the Harvest is full now and you should be thankful that you born in the time that you're born in you should be thankful you live in this hour in the day that you live that you can serve him in this day in this hour and you know all through those years I made a lot of mistakes a lot of things I didn't know a lot of things I had to learn and just think here you are and you get it pure Revelation just flowing it's hardly fair but I'm glad you've got it cuz it's more than life amen I'm happy that you know what I took me 50 years to come to you've come to in just a very short time that's the grace of God the goodness of God let's Stand Together aren't you glad we have an absolute amen aren't you glad we have equal access doesn't have to be interpreted you can labor and work and I hope tomorrow that this Sunday has inspired you to go out and work for the kingdom you know let your testimony share what you have with others I think it would be a great wonderful blessing amen let's bow our heads this evening on your heart if you you have something on your heart I I believe it it's so wonderful that our messenger spent so much time wanting us to come to the great truth that he's the same yesterday today and forever and he said all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church that we can be that Shining Light and no man lith a candle and put it under a bushel basket but he Seth on a hill that it might shine that others might be able to [Music] see and let us pray in our heart in this great hour as the great last days of the heart harvest the the day of the 11th Hour [Music] worker that we'll let our light shine that our good works might glorify Our Father in Heaven because the last voice to this day as our brother brought out is the bride the testimony of their life the testimony of their dress the testimony of their M mouths the conf confessions of the Living God working in their lives the testimony of the great things that the Lord Jesus is doing for them and by them will be the gospel to this last GI generation another book of Acts living out in these last hour workers father that's my prayer for the church Lord that we would go forward and and what lies before us father that we would go forward with the revelations that you want to share with us and father we're built on the shoulders of those that have gone before us and we appreciate every one of them but father we've been called for this day and may we live the day that we're in with the fullness of all that we have within us you're a God that deserves all of what we have to give and we just ask that you [Music] would allow us to reconsecrate our lives to the reality that this message is the only way of Escape it's the only pathway out of here it's the only truth that will set us free father I just pray that that each of us would come to the realization of our own personal lives our own personal condition and our own personal surroundings and that we would just examine ourselves and say father is the word of God in my life and if it's not there the grace and mercy of God will allow it to enter in open your heart and let all that he is come into your life we ask it in jesus' name amen amen oh pour your spirit out on me like rain

face and some of it got in my eye and I got to thinking about as our brother was ministering today you know I'm here to tell you that nothing has happened to my eyes that God has preserved my sight and I believe just like he's saying in the Christ of God has come to anoint our eyes to see the message we must go into the storehouse because every time we go that seed within us is maturing and you've been anointed to see this day this Christ in each one of us and you've been sprayed with predestination praise God that toxic splash of unbelief it can't harm you we go to the storehouse and
