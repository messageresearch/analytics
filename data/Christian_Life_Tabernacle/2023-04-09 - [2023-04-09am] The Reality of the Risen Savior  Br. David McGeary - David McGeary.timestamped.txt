[21:09] invite brother Mike for a song reading
[21:11] this morning amen
[21:16] God bless you you may have your seats
[21:18] this morning
[21:31] good morning and happy Easter
[21:36] you know over the uh
[21:39] past few weeks
[21:42] you know Liz and I have been kind of
[21:43] going through this exercise of of trying
[21:46] to go through our family histories it's
[21:48] kind of something that I think her
[21:49] brother started us on
[21:51] we've been trying to piece together you
[21:53] know through ancestry and all that kind
[21:55] of stuff all the
[21:57] genealogies and it turns out that that's
[21:59] not easy to do
[22:02] um you know you're trying to you're able
[22:04] to get little pieces of history on
[22:05] somebody and then
[22:07] you know I don't know if this goes
[22:10] together or not right
[22:12] but you know a couple things kind of
[22:13] struck me as I was going through that
[22:15] first of all it is a lot of work
[22:17] you know it'll take uh it could be a
[22:19] full-time job if you let it
[22:21] but you know the second thing that
[22:22] struck me is it's amazing
[22:25] that just after the passing of just a
[22:27] generation or two
[22:30] there's very little That Remains
[22:33] of someone's life
[22:35] you might have a census record here
[22:40] a little newspaper clipping there some
[22:43] tax record or something like that but
[22:46] you know the sum total of an entire life
[22:49] is really just boiled down to a few
[22:52] small fragments of information
[22:55] at best
[22:58] you know no matter and it struck me as I
[22:59] was looking at that no matter what each
[23:01] one of these individuals poured their
[23:03] lives into
[23:06] spent 70 or 80 years
[23:09] investing in
[23:11] you know at the end of the day whatever
[23:13] they thought it was important to spend
[23:15] their whole life on
[23:17] with what's left behind is
[23:20] essentially nothing
[23:22] I mean maybe some evidence that they
[23:25] ever even existed at all
[23:29] and I was thinking of that in the verse
[23:32] that James said and
[23:34] James 4 14 he said for what is your life
[23:39] it is even a vapor that appeareth for a
[23:43] little time
[23:46] and then vanisheth away
[23:48] and there isn't
[23:50] any point where that becomes more
[23:52] apparent than when you're just trying to
[23:54] find what happened to somebody two
[23:55] generations ago
[23:59] you know I was thinking about that as I
[24:00] was reading Psalm 39 this week
[24:04] David said this in verse 4 he said Lord
[24:07] make me to know mine in
[24:10] and the measure of my days
[24:13] what it is
[24:15] that I may know how frail I am
[24:19] you know certainly it's a very sobering
[24:22] reminder
[24:24] of how much we spend our lives
[24:28] on things that just don't matter
[24:31] in this grand scheme of things
[24:35] you know and if the Lord tarries
[24:38] and outside of
[24:40] his work
[24:43] our lives would be no different than
[24:45] these who we read about
[24:47] in genealogies and
[24:49] ancestries
[24:54] he says in verse 5
[24:56] he says behold thou has made my days as
[24:59] in hand breath
[25:00] and mine age is as nothing before thee
[25:04] verily every man at his best state is
[25:08] altogether vanity
[25:09] Selah
[25:11] surely every man walketh in a vain show
[25:16] surely they are disquieted in vain
[25:19] he heapeth up riches and knoweth not Who
[25:23] Shall Gather them
[25:27] think about that Selah
[25:32] you know the question is is you know you
[25:34] look at that and what a way to bring
[25:36] down things to brass tacks
[25:38] right at the end of the day that's we're
[25:41] nothing
[25:43] so what are we about
[25:45] is the question
[25:47] what is
[25:49] the purpose what are we here for
[25:54] you know it's interesting David Begins
[25:56] the psalm with an interesting statement
[25:59] he says I said I will take heed to my
[26:03] ways
[26:04] that I sin not with
[26:06] my tongue
[26:09] you know here he is wrestling with
[26:12] this realization that you know man is
[26:15] essentially nothing
[26:17] that none of their efforts
[26:20] none of their accomplishments none of
[26:22] their labors none of their efforts
[26:24] mean anything
[26:27] and his response to all of that is I
[26:30] will take heed to my ways that I sin not
[26:33] with my tongue
[26:37] you know it's interesting to me that
[26:39] what concerned him was not his labors or
[26:41] his efforts or his works
[26:44] but what concerned him was his tongue
[26:50] he connected his ways with his tongue
[26:53] that which proceeded out of his mouth
[26:57] the thing he was focusing on was what
[27:00] came forth
[27:01] from his tongue
[27:05] you know the sum total of Our Lives is
[27:07] now measured by our accomplishments or
[27:09] our labors or our efforts
[27:12] you know even those who would seek to
[27:14] leave a name for themselves by attaching
[27:17] their name to a building or a bridge or
[27:19] to an organization or whatever
[27:21] at the end of the day
[27:24] doesn't matter what we do what it
[27:26] matters is what we speak
[27:31] you know we'll read here as we go
[27:32] through David's prayer that his prayer
[27:35] was that the Lord would guard what he
[27:36] spoke
[27:38] that which came
[27:40] from his tongue
[27:42] Jesus said in Matthew 12 34 he says for
[27:45] out of the abundance of the heart
[27:48] the mouth speaketh
[27:51] a good man out of the good Treasure of
[27:53] the heart bringeth forth good things
[27:56] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[27:59] bringeth forth evil things
[28:02] but I say unto you that Every Idle word
[28:05] that men shall speak
[28:07] they shall give account thereof in the
[28:10] day of judgment
[28:12] for by thy words
[28:14] Thou shalt be justified
[28:17] and by thy words shalt thou be condemned
[28:22] you know what matters is the word that
[28:25] comes forth from us
[28:29] it gives witness to what we are
[28:34] you know Jesus described in this verse
[28:36] that what was in his heart is a man's
[28:40] treasure
[28:42] for good or for evil
[28:44] in fact he says in Matthew 6 21 for
[28:47] where your treasure is
[28:49] there will your heart be also
[28:52] they're one and the same
[28:55] and then out of the heart the mouth
[28:58] speaketh
[29:00] and what is spoken is ultimately how our
[29:03] value is determined
[29:07] not our accomplishments not our efforts
[29:09] not our labors
[29:12] Proverbs 18 21 says this death and life
[29:16] are in the power of the tongue
[29:19] and they that love it shall eat the
[29:22] fruit thereof
[29:24] you know it's either what we speak is
[29:27] either part of what passes away like
[29:29] vapor
[29:32] or it's something that imparts life
[29:37] which we can only do if as Paul says in
[29:40] second Corinthians 4 7 we have this
[29:43] treasure in Earthen vessels
[29:45] that the Excellency and power may be of
[29:48] God
[29:49] and not of us
[29:52] James 3 2 says if any man offend and not
[29:55] in word the same is a perfect
[29:58] a complete man
[30:01] enable also to Bridle the whole body
[30:05] that's the key
[30:07] you know as I was looking at all these
[30:09] genealogies and generations of men and
[30:11] women gone by
[30:13] and how at the end of the day nothing
[30:15] they pour their life into matters
[30:17] except their ability to impart life
[30:24] you know the one thing we bring in life
[30:26] of value God by God's grace
[30:29] is an ability
[30:31] if he has done a work in us to impart
[30:34] life
[30:36] in our time here
[30:37] is What comes forth out of our lips
[30:40] imparting life
[30:43] or is it just part of the vapor that
[30:45] becomes fragments of information that
[30:48] are in a Dustbin of History somewhere
[30:52] no wonder David's prayer was
[30:56] you know to teach us to number our days
[31:00] but his prayer was Lord guard my tongue
[31:04] not with my tongue protect my ways
[31:08] as we read that this morning let's go
[31:10] ahead and
[31:11] stand
[31:15] you know today is all about
[31:18] Resurrection
[31:20] how one came an imparted life
[31:25] in a curse of death
[31:28] but you know
[31:29] the question is is
[31:32] are we imparting life with our tongue
[31:35] do we have the ability to Speak Life
[31:39] to others or is what we consume our
[31:41] lives with including What comes forth
[31:43] out of our mouth that which will pass
[31:45] away
[31:46] as a vapor of History
[31:49] so as we think about the resurrection
[31:51] this morning
[31:52] the story of the life that was sent
[31:55] let's not make that something of history
[31:57] but let's make ourselves part of that
[31:59] action this continuous imparting of life
[32:03] let's read that Psalm 39 this morning
[32:06] together
[32:07] starting in verse 1 I said I will take
[32:10] heed to my ways that I sin not with my
[32:13] tongue I will keep my mouth with a
[32:15] bridle while the wicked is before me I
[32:18] was done with silence I held my peace
[32:21] even from good and my sorrow
[32:24] my heart was hot within me while I was
[32:27] musing the fire burned then spake I with
[32:31] my tongue Lord make me to know mine end
[32:34] and the measure of my days what it is
[32:36] that I may know how frail I am behold
[32:40] thou has made my days as in hand bread
[32:42] and mine age is nothing before thee
[32:45] barely every man at his best state is
[32:48] altogether vanity Sila surely every man
[32:52] walketh in a vain show surely they are
[32:55] disquieted in vain a heapeth up riches
[32:58] and knoweth not Who Shall Gather them
[33:01] and now Lord what wait I for my hope is
[33:05] in vain deliver me from all my
[33:07] transgressions make me not the reproach
[33:10] of the foolish I was dumb I open not my
[33:13] mouth because thou didst it remove thy
[33:16] stroke away from me I am consumed by the
[33:19] blow of thine hand when thou with
[33:22] rebukes thus correct man for iniquity
[33:24] thou makeest his Beauty to consume away
[33:27] like a moth surely every man is Vanity
[33:31] see them hear my prayer O Lord and give
[33:34] ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my
[33:38] tears for I am a stranger with thee and
[33:41] a Sojourner as all my fathers were o
[33:44] spare me that I may recover strength
[33:46] before I go hence and be no more amen
[33:53] [Music]
[33:55] God bless you may have your seeds
[34:00] oh yes I spent in vanity

[44:34] man for the cover is a special this
[44:35] morning if you can come at this time
[44:51] God bless you
[44:59] the song I'm singing today is it's
[45:02] called Ten Thousand Angels and I thought
[45:05] it's interesting how as human beings we
[45:07] get easily frustrated with one another
[45:09] but
[45:10] you know Jesus put up with the lot for
[45:12] us he
[45:14] he didn't have to be on that cross he
[45:16] could have gotten off of it his Mercy
[45:19] endures forever so I
[45:21] I hope it's a blessing to you
[45:24] [Music]
[45:30] they pound the hands of Jesus
[45:34] in the garden way he prayed
[45:39] they led him through the streets
[45:43] in change
[45:48] they spat upon the savior
[45:52] so pure and free from sin
[45:57] they said crucify him
[45:59] he
[46:01] to
[46:03] blame
[46:05] he could have
[46:08] called
[46:09] Ten Thousand Angels
[46:13] to destroy the world
[46:17] and set him free
[46:22] he could have gone
[46:25] [Music]
[46:30] but he died alone
[46:34] for you and me
[46:40] upon his precious head
[46:44] the place the crown of thorns
[46:48] they left and said behold
[46:53] the key
[46:56] they struck him and they cursed him
[47:01] and mocked His holy name
[47:05] all alone he suffered air everything
[47:13] he could have
[47:15] called
[47:17] Ten Thousand Angels
[47:20] to destroy the world
[47:24] and set him free
[47:29] he could have gone
[47:33] ten thousands
[47:37] but he died alone
[47:41] for you and me
[47:46] when they nailed him to the cross
[47:50] his mother stood nearby
[47:54] it said woman
[47:57] behold nicer
[48:03] he cried I thirst for water
[48:07] but they gave them none to drink
[48:11] then the sinful work of man
[48:15] man was done
[48:19] he could have
[48:21] called
[48:23] Ten Thousand Angels

[1:01:25] your goodness and mercy endureth forever
[1:01:28] [Music]
[1:01:32] Lord and we just look
[1:01:35] through a glass darkling
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:40] wondering in our heart what things that
[1:01:43] you have prepared for us
[1:01:45] for those that love you
[1:01:50] just to think that there's so much
[1:01:52] wonders and
[1:01:54] Glory ahead of us
[1:01:57] oh Father it makes Our Hearts Leap with
[1:02:00] joy
[1:02:01] we ask you to bless us this morning on
[1:02:03] this Easter morning
[1:02:06] trust that you will be our portion this
[1:02:08] morning we ask these things in Jesus
[1:02:12] name
[1:02:13] amen amen if you have your Bibles let's
[1:02:18] turn to uh uh I'm going to try to be
[1:02:21] short this morning
[1:02:23] now I'm going to really try to be sure
[1:02:27] if I don't succeed it's your fault
[1:02:32] amen do you love him this morning
[1:02:35] amen let's turn to it just a couple
[1:02:37] scriptures
[1:02:39] let's turn to the gospel of
[1:02:43] Saint John the 14th chapter
[1:02:48] and read the uh
[1:02:52] the 19th verse
[1:02:56] and
[1:03:02] I I think that sometimes when we read
[1:03:06] all these verses together
[1:03:09] and we never get the full benefit of how
[1:03:12] beautifully they stand out alone
[1:03:16] so I just take the 18th verse for
[1:03:19] example and if you just read it all by
[1:03:21] itself
[1:03:22] what a beautiful comfort and promise
[1:03:27] I will not leave you
[1:03:31] comfortless
[1:03:33] I will come to you
[1:03:36] oh my just think of that anytime you get
[1:03:39] down or you have the blues you can lift
[1:03:42] your hands up and know he said I will
[1:03:44] not leave you comfortless what what a
[1:03:46] glorious thing it says and then we go on
[1:03:50] to read yet a little while and the world
[1:03:55] seeth me no more
[1:03:58] but ye see me because I live ye shall
[1:04:05] live also
[1:04:07] amen amen and let's turn over to Romans
[1:04:13] I believe it's the sixth chapter of
[1:04:16] Romans and
[1:04:19] uh
[1:04:22] found in the 23rd
[1:04:26] a verse
[1:04:30] and just uh
[1:04:34] short verse it says for the wages of sin
[1:04:37] is death
[1:04:38] but the gift of God is eternal life
[1:04:41] through Jesus Christ Our Lord God bless
[1:04:45] you may be seated
[1:05:01] well I don't know if we'll get the
[1:05:03] building done before the rapture
[1:05:05] but if we don't I'm okay with it how
[1:05:08] about you amen
[1:05:12] okay you know uh
[1:05:14] this great East area is marvelous for
[1:05:19] for so many reasons and
[1:05:22] and just so wonderful because
[1:05:27] we know that in his resurrection is also
[1:05:32] the promise of his coming
[1:05:35] and I I think that that should never
[1:05:37] leave our Focus
[1:05:40] that um he's coming
[1:05:43] he's coming back for us
[1:05:45] that seems to be a harder reality to
[1:05:50] grasp
[1:05:52] I saw an outstanding photograph here the
[1:05:55] other day I I wish I was more
[1:05:58] technically inclined I would have
[1:06:01] tried to
[1:06:03] show it to you
[1:06:06] but it was photographs of the city
[1:06:09] skylines
[1:06:11] across our country
[1:06:13] years ago
[1:06:16] at this time and across the city
[1:06:19] skylines on the skyscrapers all
[1:06:22] throughout the city were crosses all
[1:06:27] across the think and symbols of the
[1:06:31] resurrection and of God being the god of
[1:06:34] our country
[1:06:36] and they they showed in this hour now
[1:06:39] they went back and they took those same
[1:06:42] photographs and those skylines are dark
[1:06:46] and there's no mention of the Lord at
[1:06:50] all
[1:06:51] and I I think that it's kind of where
[1:06:54] man has gotten to the place that if you
[1:06:59] don't feel that he exists and you don't
[1:07:02] feel that that he's real and you don't
[1:07:06] feel that he's mindful of him you
[1:07:09] certainly aren't going to uh look for
[1:07:14] somebody that you don't believe exists
[1:07:19] you're just not going to be there you
[1:07:23] know and
[1:07:24] but if you really feel that he's real
[1:07:28] and that he's risen then you can know
[1:07:32] that he's alive to perform his word
[1:07:36] and I think that's what the whole our
[1:07:40] whole hope
[1:07:41] of Easter is
[1:07:44] and I thought of a lot of different
[1:07:47] things to preach this morning but I I
[1:07:50] this just came on my heart and and I
[1:07:54] just like to share it with you by just
[1:07:58] reading a little something to you this
[1:08:01] morning
[1:08:03] and just making very uh short comments
[1:08:08] uh Sharon said to me this morning she
[1:08:11] said Dad
[1:08:12] I said yes she says are we going to have
[1:08:15] service this evening I said yes she says
[1:08:18] well you're what about giving time for
[1:08:21] uh people won't be able to go to their
[1:08:24] Easter egg hunt she said if you have
[1:08:27] service this evening you know she is
[1:08:30] kind of uh what we call pulling your
[1:08:33] chain you know and I I just wonder why
[1:08:37] that
[1:08:38] man has drifted
[1:08:41] away
[1:08:44] from God
[1:08:45] why would they want us you know
[1:08:49] settle for Easter rabbits and and uh
[1:08:54] things like uh like that when there's
[1:08:59] such a wonderful
[1:09:01] uh reality
[1:09:04] in the Lord but I'd like to read this to
[1:09:08] you this morning if you would uh
[1:09:12] uh bear with me in this
[1:09:15] and I'd like to say I just want to talk
[1:09:18] about the reality of the Risen Savior
[1:09:23] the reality of the Risen
[1:09:27] savior
[1:09:28] and so this is a description of who that
[1:09:34] it was
[1:09:37] that raised from the dead
[1:09:40] and and I I I like to focus on that a
[1:09:44] moment who was it
[1:09:47] that really rose on that morning
[1:09:51] and and came alive
[1:09:55] and overcame death hell in the grave
[1:10:00] broke the curse of sin and that's what
[1:10:04] we said because the scripture tells us
[1:10:06] the wages of sin is death
[1:10:09] and we were all born in sin shaped in
[1:10:12] iniquity it came into the world speaking
[1:10:16] in life
[1:10:17] the very nature that we have is a nature
[1:10:21] of Destruction
[1:10:23] even self-destruction not only do we
[1:10:27] destroy one another but we destroy
[1:10:30] ourselves
[1:10:31] hey I don't know what it is why that we
[1:10:36] overeat and why that we over indulge and
[1:10:40] why that we drink alcohol and smoke
[1:10:43] cigarettes and take drugs I I I just was
[1:10:47] just the other day in my heart I was
[1:10:51] sitting there and I thought of what gets
[1:10:55] somebody started on up on some of these
[1:10:58] terrible drugs like like uh cocaine and
[1:11:03] act and I guess meth or speed or
[1:11:06] whatever they call it today are these
[1:11:09] things that are so destructive
[1:11:12] uh you know what I mean what place does
[1:11:15] somebody have to get to where they they
[1:11:18] give up on life and and can want to fall
[1:11:22] into addiction where it's so prevalent
[1:11:26] what the end of that road is
[1:11:29] there must be such a lack of Hope
[1:11:34] you you know what I mean because that
[1:11:36] could that there there's no hope at the
[1:11:39] end of the road there's no way out
[1:11:41] there's I'm stuck here
[1:11:44] and we were talking the other day uh
[1:11:47] uh some of the brothers and I and we got
[1:11:51] talking about death and I said you know
[1:11:54] I've said
[1:11:56] what wouldn't it be terrible
[1:12:01] to have eternal life here
[1:12:06] how would you like to live forever in
[1:12:08] this
[1:12:11] oh my
[1:12:13] I thought I thought in my heart I
[1:12:15] thought oh you know death
[1:12:18] death is a blessing
[1:12:21] you know because it's our our way out of
[1:12:24] here
[1:12:25] if you've got the great gift of God and
[1:12:28] the great hope
[1:12:30] that with no hope and with no uh
[1:12:35] reality beyond the perceptions that you
[1:12:40] see I can see why people are plunging
[1:12:43] into such fatalism because they lost
[1:12:46] hope but you know Easter is the hope of
[1:12:50] men
[1:12:52] it's the hope of life
[1:12:55] it's the hope of every circumstance that
[1:12:58] you're in that no matter if you have
[1:13:01] sickness that that that that has grabbed
[1:13:05] hold of this flesh you know one thing
[1:13:08] because that whatever allotted time that
[1:13:11] you have that you have a hope that one
[1:13:14] day you'll be whole
[1:13:17] whether here or there
[1:13:22] but this life is not the story that's
[1:13:26] written there was another story written
[1:13:29] on Easter and that was the story of
[1:13:32] another life another kingdom another
[1:13:35] land another world another hope
[1:13:41] of
[1:13:43] sin is death and and when a person only
[1:13:49] has this life
[1:13:53] and and and look and all that they could
[1:13:57] see at the end of this life it is we
[1:14:01] watch our parents get old
[1:14:04] and you know my mother will be a hundred
[1:14:07] and one years old this July
[1:14:11] and Leslie and I were talking the other
[1:14:13] day and and we're at that time where you
[1:14:16] come to a place she's doing really
[1:14:19] really good and she still wants to do
[1:14:22] things for herself and she still goes to
[1:14:24] church and cooks and everything
[1:14:27] sometimes you just think well she'll
[1:14:29] live forever and Leslie said David she
[1:14:31] said you know your mom's not going to
[1:14:33] live forever
[1:14:37] and I thought oh
[1:14:40] she could
[1:14:46] I plan on living forever
[1:14:51] but I don't want to live in this
[1:14:57] I don't want this to be my hope I don't
[1:15:00] want this to be my future I don't know
[1:15:04] because they're doing away with God
[1:15:06] and we have great difference in
[1:15:09] ideologies in different directions where
[1:15:12] man feels that they need to take the
[1:15:14] world and they're fussing and fighting
[1:15:17] and and arguing and and killing and
[1:15:21] doing everything because they're trying
[1:15:24] to carve out a hope for the future
[1:15:30] people think there's only one hope for
[1:15:33] the future if we can change the
[1:15:36] co-governing system in the whole
[1:15:38] economical system of the world and we
[1:15:41] can change this world and move it into a
[1:15:44] different direction and and get rid of
[1:15:47] this and get rid of that and do this and
[1:15:50] do this difference
[1:15:52] it's so vain
[1:15:55] why would you want to try to fix this
[1:15:59] world when you can get a ticket out of
[1:16:02] it
[1:16:07] okay at the end because they have no
[1:16:10] hope
[1:16:14] they can only see what lies ahead
[1:16:19] currency and value and I thought it was
[1:16:24] striking maybe you don't realize these
[1:16:28] things but
[1:16:30] um and I wouldn't want to burden you
[1:16:32] with them in any way but there's a big
[1:16:35] struggle in the world right now of which
[1:16:38] currency is going to be the currency
[1:16:42] that the world uses
[1:16:46] and these great countries are getting
[1:16:48] together
[1:16:50] the great oil producers and the great uh
[1:16:54] manufacturers of the world we know our
[1:16:57] greatest Manufacturing in the world is
[1:16:59] done in China and India and places that
[1:17:02] have vast populations and and low
[1:17:07] cost of Labor
[1:17:10] and they're wanting to get together with
[1:17:13] Russia and China and these places and
[1:17:15] they want to come up with doing uh
[1:17:19] The Exchange in a different currency
[1:17:22] than the dollar
[1:17:25] the dollar is what everybody uses
[1:17:29] but they're trying to change that
[1:17:31] because they're trying to change a world
[1:17:35] and why do you think they're working so
[1:17:38] hard to change this world to change the
[1:17:41] government to change this world because
[1:17:44] they know that they are dying
[1:17:49] man knows they can't continue like this
[1:17:52] they know they can't go on to this why
[1:17:55] our very life itself our very bodies
[1:17:59] testify of the world because that's
[1:18:02] where we came from
[1:18:06] you can live
[1:18:09] they know they can't live We Can't Live
[1:18:12] unless we do something
[1:18:15] but the wages of sin is death they can't
[1:18:18] change that but the gift of God was
[1:18:21] eternal life
[1:18:23] God has offered this world
[1:18:27] eternal life
[1:18:29] a new kingdom a new place to live a new
[1:18:33] land Beyond this land
[1:18:36] man's trying to get to the moon
[1:18:39] create
[1:18:41] of
[1:18:43] space stations if all kinds of things
[1:18:47] because they see right now that this
[1:18:50] Earth is in a struggle
[1:18:57] the very Work World itself is groaning
[1:19:01] those scientists know it they see it in
[1:19:05] the plant life they see it in the animal
[1:19:07] life they see it in the earth they know
[1:19:10] that this whole world right now is in
[1:19:13] anxiety
[1:19:18] men are like I told you before they're
[1:19:21] they're suffering with environmental
[1:19:24] anxiety
[1:19:27] why there's so much emphasis on the
[1:19:29] environment we've got to save the air
[1:19:31] we've got to save the water we've got to
[1:19:35] save this you know I think it would be a
[1:19:37] lot more important to save your soul
[1:19:42] but I want you to see they don't have
[1:19:44] hope
[1:19:47] they don't have hope the only hope that
[1:19:50] they have is in this life
[1:19:53] which they're watching deteriorate
[1:19:56] they're at the economies deteriorating
[1:19:59] the government's deteriorating violence
[1:20:02] is out of control
[1:20:05] there's there there they've lost
[1:20:09] all a Direction
[1:20:13] and they're and there's such an effort
[1:20:16] to try to save themselves
[1:20:21] and the future
[1:20:25] think how blessed you are this morning
[1:20:30] to know that
[1:20:33] he's risen
[1:20:37] that he overcame death
[1:20:42] this world will die
[1:20:47] whether it's a thousand years from now
[1:20:50] or 2 000 years from now this world
[1:20:54] cannot continue under the continual
[1:20:58] strain that man's putting upon it
[1:21:07] I saw a cartoon and I I didn't catch the
[1:21:12] cartoon I had to have it explained to me
[1:21:15] that there was a person that was ready
[1:21:18] to receive their paycheck and the person
[1:21:21] that was received their paycheck asked
[1:21:24] the person said oh could you just give
[1:21:27] me a dozen eggs instead
[1:21:32] and I thought well that's funny
[1:21:35] and they said oh they said
[1:21:38] uh dad eggs are are up twice three times
[1:21:42] or four times what they used to be
[1:21:45] because chickens are dying I guess
[1:21:48] and that's where eggs come from
[1:21:53] I finally figured it out
[1:21:57] no
[1:21:58] this this great
[1:22:02] struggle
[1:22:05] and so without hope
[1:22:13] what would your future be
[1:22:19] what's the plan for your future
[1:22:22] everybody wants to invest
[1:22:25] invest in the future I thought how many
[1:22:29] sermons brother Branham preached on
[1:22:31] investment
[1:22:35] so this morning
[1:22:37] we celebrate
[1:22:40] a hope
[1:22:42] that we have
[1:22:45] a piece that's her path to understanding
[1:22:49] because the wages of sin is death
[1:22:54] when man walked out of that Garden
[1:22:59] the day that they sinned
[1:23:03] they walked from eternal life
[1:23:06] to death
[1:23:08] that was the that was the wage of
[1:23:12] unbelief
[1:23:15] that's what they had
[1:23:17] unbelief the the fact that they
[1:23:20] disbelieved what they got in return and
[1:23:24] what they sold out
[1:23:27] for the Curiosity of what was in that
[1:23:32] tree of knowledge you understand you
[1:23:35] today
[1:23:36] are the witnesses of the tree of
[1:23:40] knowledge that Eve wanted to have a
[1:23:43] taste of
[1:23:45] do you think she thought it would take 6
[1:23:48] 000 years for this tree of knowledge
[1:23:51] to take over
[1:23:54] till where now what do you have a little
[1:23:56] thing you carry around with you
[1:23:58] a kid today doesn't even have to go to
[1:24:01] school
[1:24:04] foreign
[1:24:10] I think it's a girl
[1:24:16] whatever it is
[1:24:18] mine speaks like a girl
[1:24:24] you know I I'd say something that I
[1:24:26] think I'd get in trouble
[1:24:31] and and anyway I just I want to say it
[1:24:35] so bad I could almost bit but but I
[1:24:38] better not
[1:24:40] they don't have to go to school
[1:24:43] you can ask but anything
[1:24:47] I used to sit out and have to figure out
[1:24:50] what this and what this is I can ask my
[1:24:53] phone
[1:24:55] I've got
[1:24:56] 135 by 80 by 8 inches deep how many
[1:25:01] yards of concrete is that
[1:25:05] and then she'll say according to such
[1:25:07] and such you'll need you know
[1:25:10] 421 yards of concrete great
[1:25:14] why should I go to school
[1:25:18] why should I sit in a classroom
[1:25:21] you know and I went to Catholic school
[1:25:23] so I had nuns
[1:25:25] if you know you know what I mean you
[1:25:27] know you don't know what that meant did
[1:25:29] you well that meant that they kept going
[1:25:30] like this all the time to me and shaking
[1:25:33] my head you know what I mean hitting me
[1:25:35] with rulers anyway I'm you know I got
[1:25:38] arthritis in my hands today and and I'm
[1:25:41] blaming the nuns
[1:25:46] you know what I mean sure you don't need
[1:25:50] it
[1:25:53] because it's the tree of knowledge
[1:25:57] but what is it got man
[1:26:00] it's got them death
[1:26:04] oh no wonder Paul fit old death oh grave
[1:26:09] where's your Victory oh death where's
[1:26:11] your sting
[1:26:13] amen we have hope this morning
[1:26:17] so we know what the wages of sin are
[1:26:20] but the gift of God
[1:26:23] is eternal life and he said pretty soon
[1:26:27] the world won't see me no more
[1:26:30] do you understand they don't see him
[1:26:35] anymore
[1:26:38] they don't see them in nature
[1:26:41] they don't see them in mankind
[1:26:44] they don't see him anywhere
[1:26:46] in fact they no longer wish to retain
[1:26:50] him in their knowledge
[1:26:54] and because that they no longer want to
[1:26:57] keep the hope
[1:26:59] of eternal life
[1:27:01] that they no longer want to build their
[1:27:05] future
[1:27:08] on the hope of another kingdom because
[1:27:11] they no longer want to retain God in
[1:27:15] their knowledge he has given them over
[1:27:18] to a reprobate mind
[1:27:26] and and like if I can explain that in
[1:27:30] this very simply when you have a
[1:27:33] reprobate mind you do not think in
[1:27:37] Practical logic
[1:27:40] the very Simplicity of decency is gone
[1:27:49] it it just it common sense
[1:27:55] and common decency
[1:27:57] it is no longer what governs
[1:28:01] people
[1:28:03] they are now governed by their
[1:28:05] imagination
[1:28:09] whatever they can think whatever they
[1:28:12] can imagine
[1:28:15] you know we think so many times of the
[1:28:18] greatness of our country
[1:28:20] but you know you you get a viewpoint
[1:28:24] from the other world
[1:28:27] and we think oh Mexico's such a a a a
[1:28:31] terrible place to live how many
[1:28:35] shootings in schools that they have in
[1:28:39] Mexico last year
[1:28:43] anybody can count them no you can't they
[1:28:47] don't have them
[1:28:48] they love their kids
[1:28:54] if you heard on the Rope the side of the
[1:28:57] road or broke down on the side of the
[1:29:00] road in Mexico how many people do you
[1:29:03] think will stop almost everybody that
[1:29:06] goes by
[1:29:12] and they'll figure out some way to get
[1:29:15] you running
[1:29:17] whether it's duct tape baling wire or
[1:29:20] Coke bottle I don't care what it is
[1:29:22] they'll figure it out
[1:29:26] we had a carburetor bring a fuel pump go
[1:29:29] out one time and a guy sat on the hood
[1:29:31] the car with the hood open and with a
[1:29:34] coke bottle full of gas and poured a
[1:29:36] little bit of gas burn down the road we
[1:29:39] go a little bit more room down the road
[1:29:41] we go but we got there
[1:29:47] but what's going on here we're shooting
[1:29:50] people in shopping centers shooting
[1:29:52] people in restaurants shooting people in
[1:29:55] schools
[1:30:00] all they say peace and safety but sudden
[1:30:03] destruction comes this is not a place I
[1:30:06] want to live I want to have a hope
[1:30:10] of an exit
[1:30:16] I want to have a hope
[1:30:18] and it's this world is becoming darker
[1:30:24] it shall be light
[1:30:27] in the evening time
[1:30:29] the path to Glory we shall surely find I
[1:30:33] want you to lay it strong to you this
[1:30:35] morning
[1:30:36] that the wages of sin
[1:30:41] unbelief as death
[1:30:44] can no matter how dark it gets we have a
[1:30:48] hope
[1:30:50] because we have a promise
[1:30:53] a little while and leave me no more but
[1:30:57] you shall see me
[1:31:00] because I live
[1:31:03] Hallelujah
[1:31:04] you shall live also
[1:31:07] I will not forsake you
[1:31:10] I will not leave you comfortless but I
[1:31:14] will come again that where I am you may
[1:31:18] be also what a hope we have this morning
[1:31:23] this one I like to read this to you
[1:31:26] because I want us to understand who it
[1:31:29] is
[1:31:30] that Rose
[1:31:33] on that day
[1:31:35] what he is
[1:31:39] and what we have accessible
[1:31:43] to us
[1:31:48] he says but you shall see me
[1:31:51] for I shall be with you
[1:31:53] even in you
[1:31:56] until the end
[1:31:58] the hope of the Resurrection
[1:32:02] is not a future hope
[1:32:05] it's a present tense hope
[1:32:10] for he is a great hope
[1:32:14] and comfort
[1:32:15] in the time of trouble
[1:32:17] I'd like to describe how our messenger
[1:32:21] described him
[1:32:22] if you would listen and bear with my
[1:32:24] lack of ability to read
[1:32:30] there never was a life ever lived like
[1:32:33] his
[1:32:35] because he was the god manifested in the
[1:32:40] flesh
[1:32:41] when he was born he was the expression
[1:32:46] of what God the father is
[1:32:51] Philip have I been song along with you
[1:32:54] and you know not who I am he who hath
[1:32:58] seen me have seen
[1:33:01] the father
[1:33:05] and God the father being loved
[1:33:09] when Jesus was the full expression of
[1:33:13] love
[1:33:14] he was loved from the very first time
[1:33:18] his little baby hands stroked the pretty
[1:33:22] cheeks of his mother he was love
[1:33:27] and I think today that that's where many
[1:33:31] is failing to recognize that he was love
[1:33:38] who was it
[1:33:40] that Rose
[1:33:43] that morning
[1:33:45] what was he who was he what was his
[1:33:49] personality what was his nature
[1:33:53] he was love
[1:33:55] and I think today that's where many is
[1:33:57] failing to recognize that he was love
[1:34:00] God is love
[1:34:02] and they that love are born of God
[1:34:08] so loved the world that is the unlovable
[1:34:13] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:34:16] that whosoever believeth in him shall
[1:34:19] not perish but would have everlasting
[1:34:23] life
[1:34:25] he expressed his love
[1:34:27] when he was here on Earth in so many
[1:34:31] different ways
[1:34:33] till it is undisputable
[1:34:37] that he was the most loving creature
[1:34:40] that ever lived
[1:34:47] and I think in his life here
[1:34:51] he was expressing God
[1:34:54] and the only way that God can be
[1:34:57] expressed to people is through love
[1:35:04] foreign
[1:35:06] listening to the prayers lines last week
[1:35:10] as we did and others that I've listened
[1:35:14] to recently I noticed some
[1:35:17] way
[1:35:19] that when the people would approached
[1:35:21] brother random and they would come up
[1:35:22] and I believe they'd always come from
[1:35:24] this way
[1:35:26] and he would begin to talk to him and
[1:35:29] you know how that he would say he says
[1:35:31] I'm in that you're a stranger to me I
[1:35:34] presume
[1:35:36] and then he will say he said now between
[1:35:39] me and the gentleman or me and the lady
[1:35:42] that great light that great Pillar of
[1:35:45] Fire is sitting in between and he said
[1:35:49] the great camera has cut a picture of it
[1:35:52] he says the vision follows that light
[1:35:56] and there's that's where the vision was
[1:35:59] because that's who knew
[1:36:02] he says now you notice he said don't be
[1:36:04] afraid he said you notice there's
[1:36:06] something different
[1:36:07] he says you notice how warm
[1:36:11] and sweet
[1:36:12] it is
[1:36:15] the spirit of God's never angry it's
[1:36:18] never combative those people would come
[1:36:21] up it wouldn't matter how dark their
[1:36:23] sins were
[1:36:27] what reproach they had where they were
[1:36:30] at when they got there there was a suite
[1:36:33] spirit
[1:36:36] of love
[1:36:37] and he says that's him
[1:36:40] you feel it it's real sweet
[1:36:44] remember the anointing is always sweet
[1:36:48] what is the anointing it's the presence
[1:36:52] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:55] now as I noticed that I read this and it
[1:36:58] really touched my heart
[1:37:06] and well did he he do this when he
[1:37:09] caught one of the most vile women
[1:37:13] that there was of his day perhaps
[1:37:18] they found her just guilty
[1:37:21] and no way out when she was found in
[1:37:24] adultery
[1:37:26] and they drug her up before him and said
[1:37:29] what do you say do for her
[1:37:34] and when he turned to her and said I
[1:37:38] don't condemn thee
[1:37:40] go
[1:37:41] and sin no more
[1:37:45] instead of being thrown her out to the
[1:37:49] streets
[1:37:50] to be drunk out like a bunch of wolves
[1:37:53] over her
[1:37:54] to Stone her and take her life
[1:37:58] his tender kind loving heart
[1:38:04] stoop way down into the sin that she was
[1:38:08] in
[1:38:09] and said I don't condemn thee just go
[1:38:14] and don't sin no more
[1:38:21] and when he was on his way down to the
[1:38:24] grave of Lazarus
[1:38:26] I think that was another great time that
[1:38:29] he expressed what God is to the human
[1:38:33] being
[1:38:37] not only is he a God that can forgive
[1:38:42] the lowest sin
[1:38:45] that could be committed
[1:38:47] and take the guilty and make them
[1:38:51] Guiltless
[1:38:53] by his pardoning love
[1:38:57] but after death has laid Us in silence
[1:39:02] he's still concerned about us
[1:39:06] I think he well expressed that on the
[1:39:11] road down with Martha and Mary when he
[1:39:15] come to the house where death had shut
[1:39:18] out the life of a loving person
[1:39:22] and on his road down to the Grave yet
[1:39:25] being God knowing that he would raise
[1:39:30] him from the dead
[1:39:32] knowing that it had been told him
[1:39:36] that his very word laid the power to
[1:39:40] raise him from the grave yet when he's
[1:39:44] seen Martha and Mary and those who love
[1:39:47] Lazarus crying the Bible said he wept
[1:39:54] what was it
[1:39:56] his great loving heart
[1:40:00] when he's seeing that knowing that his
[1:40:03] friends were in trouble
[1:40:06] he was troubled
[1:40:08] with them
[1:40:12] he was so moved
[1:40:15] by what they were suffering
[1:40:18] that he wept with them
[1:40:22] they're talking about who it was
[1:40:27] I'm so glad to know that he can be found
[1:40:31] amongst the Brokenhearted
[1:40:34] and our God knows he's not one that
[1:40:38] would leave us
[1:40:40] he stands by us when all has failed
[1:40:45] and the last hopes of Earthly reaching
[1:40:48] has come to its end
[1:40:50] he's still God and He Loves Us and he
[1:40:55] was the expression of God I'll never
[1:40:58] leave thee nor forsake thee I'll be with
[1:41:02] you even in you
[1:41:05] till the end
[1:41:11] and oh how I believe that he Longs for
[1:41:15] his people
[1:41:17] to be so Anointed with his spirit
[1:41:21] that we could go to each other in trials
[1:41:25] and in troubles
[1:41:27] and give the expression of his sympathy
[1:41:31] as it pours from our hearts that's been
[1:41:35] born of his spirit
[1:41:38] and reflect in the church the love of
[1:41:41] the Living God that will Express what he
[1:41:46] said
[1:41:49] he shows what he did
[1:41:52] to the whole human race
[1:41:54] the very God represents himself in
[1:41:58] Christ
[1:41:59] he expressed
[1:42:02] he he ex he expressed his opinion to the
[1:42:06] human race to forgive and to love those
[1:42:11] who were unlovable
[1:42:13] and I wonder on this Easter morning how
[1:42:16] short
[1:42:18] we followed that
[1:42:20] we could love those who love us but he
[1:42:24] loved those who did not love us
[1:42:28] and I thought this morning that's who
[1:42:30] Rose
[1:42:34] that's who Rose from the grave
[1:42:38] and he rose from the grave to show that
[1:42:41] he's still alive and he's still the same
[1:42:45] yesterday today and forever he still
[1:42:49] goes to the the unlovable
[1:42:52] he still joins with you in your trouble
[1:42:56] he still cares for you when nobody else
[1:43:00] cares he's still with you when everybody
[1:43:03] else forsakes you he sees that's that's
[1:43:09] who rose up
[1:43:10] it's not the historical fact that he
[1:43:14] rose up
[1:43:16] because that they look back if you go to
[1:43:19] Jerusalem you'll go to one place and
[1:43:21] there are people saying this is where
[1:43:23] that he's buried
[1:43:25] and then you go to another place and
[1:43:27] they call it the garden tomb and they
[1:43:30] say this is where he is buried
[1:43:33] and I like the historical place
[1:43:39] but he's not buried
[1:43:43] Hallelujah
[1:43:46] he's not buried
[1:43:49] he's alive
[1:43:53] and he's coming again
[1:43:57] but he's he's alive because he he he
[1:44:01] he's not going to forsake you
[1:44:05] he's alive because he wants to be here
[1:44:07] with you
[1:44:08] and the most beautiful part of it when I
[1:44:11] I think of that love that's the love
[1:44:14] that lifted each one of us about a sin
[1:44:16] that's the love that came to that hippie
[1:44:19] boy
[1:44:21] in California
[1:44:23] who is vile
[1:44:25] I mean when you run around with a group
[1:44:28] of guys they call themselves the Hell's
[1:44:30] Angels don't think that's no saintly
[1:44:32] bunch of Boy Scouts
[1:44:37] but it didn't matter
[1:44:40] he can go there
[1:44:43] what allows him to go there
[1:44:47] what he is
[1:44:50] he's love
[1:44:53] it's a great thing that he laid down his
[1:44:56] life for us
[1:44:58] through that price our sins were
[1:45:00] forgiven
[1:45:02] a lot of great soldiers
[1:45:05] has laid down their life
[1:45:08] on the battlefield to keep our country
[1:45:10] free
[1:45:13] and we appreciate that and it's a shame
[1:45:16] that we've let so many wonderful things
[1:45:19] that they've died for
[1:45:21] to become not
[1:45:25] but what we have is a great
[1:45:27] Memorial
[1:45:30] asked the other day as we
[1:45:33] did the service for brother
[1:45:36] Otis and we went to the military
[1:45:37] cemetery and
[1:45:39] and
[1:45:41] they take the flag and they fold the
[1:45:44] flag and
[1:45:46] and the extended attention it moved my
[1:45:49] heart
[1:45:50] and then they
[1:45:52] shoot those guns off
[1:45:55] what are they doing they're given honor
[1:45:58] the last
[1:46:00] the last respect
[1:46:04] to a soldier
[1:46:06] and then they play the taps
[1:46:10] and those tears just
[1:46:12] start to go because it's so awesome
[1:46:17] but he can never come back to fight
[1:46:20] again
[1:46:23] his service is history
[1:46:28] whatever rank he achieved
[1:46:32] that was the end of his service
[1:46:35] Not only was it the end of his service
[1:46:37] that marked the end of his service first
[1:46:40] country but it marked the end of his
[1:46:41] service for mankind
[1:46:44] wouldn't it have been sad if he would
[1:46:46] have stayed in that grave and that would
[1:46:48] have been the end of his service
[1:46:51] all the Miracles that he performed they
[1:46:54] would just be history and that would be
[1:46:57] the end of them
[1:46:58] there would have been nobody else raised
[1:47:00] again nobody else healed again no more
[1:47:04] Loaves and Fishes broken it would have
[1:47:06] been the end of it
[1:47:09] it would have been a historical God that
[1:47:13] we could serve and we could say this is
[1:47:15] what he did this is what he did surely
[1:47:18] he was the son of God no what there
[1:47:21] never was a man like him that done so
[1:47:24] many great works
[1:47:26] foreign Monument
[1:47:33] I've been to the George Washington
[1:47:34] Monument
[1:47:36] a great big needle
[1:47:39] sticking in the sky
[1:47:41] I banged a little Lincoln Memorial
[1:47:45] a great big statue there
[1:47:48] and they say all that they've done the
[1:47:51] father of our country the the freedom of
[1:47:54] the slaves and the holding of America
[1:47:56] together and Thomas Jefferson Memorial
[1:47:59] and the writing of the Constitution and
[1:48:02] all those things but all those things
[1:48:04] history
[1:48:07] they can never serve mankind again
[1:48:12] it's done
[1:48:15] and what they did was great
[1:48:21] but he said the world won't see me
[1:48:25] but Jews shall see me
[1:48:28] because I live
[1:48:31] you live also and that's because I live
[1:48:35] the life that I had the works that I did
[1:48:39] what that I did when I'm here I'm still
[1:48:42] here to do the same thing I'm still with
[1:48:46] you I didn't leave you
[1:48:49] I'm still here I'm still the same loving
[1:48:52] God that went on Calvary I'm still the
[1:48:55] same loving God that forgave the woman
[1:48:57] that was caught in the act I'm still the
[1:49:00] same loving God that raised up the Widow
[1:49:03] son I'm still the same loving God that
[1:49:06] cast out the Devils I'm still the same
[1:49:09] yesterday today and forever
[1:49:12] I've risen
[1:49:16] and I'm here
[1:49:20] and I'm accessible
[1:49:24] I'm here to do for you exceedingly and
[1:49:29] abundantly above what I could ask or
[1:49:31] think do you believe he's risen
[1:49:37] do you believe he still can be touched
[1:49:42] that's the question
[1:49:48] is he a far off
[1:49:51] when he said he wouldn't be
[1:49:57] he offers to come into our lives
[1:50:02] foreign in fact he stands at the door
[1:50:05] and not
[1:50:06] and wants to come in and be for us what
[1:50:11] he was when he's here
[1:50:13] that same love of God the scripture says
[1:50:17] that he says it'll be the love of God
[1:50:19] shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy
[1:50:23] Spirit
[1:50:24] he was in fleshly formed then
[1:50:28] so he could die
[1:50:30] as sinner
[1:50:31] and pay our prices of Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:50:35] but then he went to Spirit form
[1:50:38] and in that Spirit form he wants to come
[1:50:42] into your heart and live in you
[1:50:47] and he's risen
[1:50:49] to do that
[1:50:52] I thought
[1:50:54] of all the greatness
[1:50:57] that he is never was a man like him
[1:50:59] never a man that loved like him never a
[1:51:01] man that did the work that he did and
[1:51:04] yet he's accessible
[1:51:07] how easy do you think it would be for
[1:51:10] you to get to the president
[1:51:16] try it sometime
[1:51:20] if you ever see a picture
[1:51:22] there's all these guys that got these
[1:51:24] cords coming out of their ears
[1:51:29] they're trained instinctly
[1:51:33] to lay down their life
[1:51:37] when the assassination attempt
[1:51:42] was made on Ronald Reagan
[1:51:46] they show the great film
[1:51:48] then I believe the gentleman's name was
[1:51:50] Hinckley
[1:51:53] they show him pulling out his gun
[1:51:57] and the Secret Service agent is standing
[1:52:02] there with this fat can he looks behind
[1:52:04] and they show him turning around and
[1:52:08] sticking his arms out guarding the
[1:52:10] president and taking a bullet
[1:52:14] how accessible
[1:52:16] do you think the president is
[1:52:21] a great businessman
[1:52:24] all these so-called
[1:52:27] movies Stars
[1:52:31] I'd call me hypnotic witches
[1:52:37] because they're trying to present you a
[1:52:40] world that doesn't exist
[1:52:43] some fantasy poison to corrupt your mind
[1:52:54] how accessible do you think they are
[1:52:58] they've all got bodyguards
[1:53:01] and yet the greatest person that there
[1:53:03] ever was
[1:53:04] in the whole world
[1:53:07] the most loving kind powerful merciful
[1:53:12] person
[1:53:14] is there for you personally
[1:53:17] any time you call
[1:53:23] Paul said we have not
[1:53:26] because we ask not
[1:53:29] and we ask not because we don't believe
[1:53:34] we don't believe what he really is we
[1:53:37] don't believe who he really is we don't
[1:53:40] believe the record that he left for us
[1:53:43] in the scriptures
[1:53:48] we don't believe it when the writer
[1:53:50] tried to tell us he's the same
[1:53:53] he hasn't changed he's the same loving
[1:53:58] merciful caring God that can weep with
[1:54:02] you that can bury your infirmities
[1:54:07] that can be touched
[1:54:10] by our infirmities
[1:54:12] he can feel with us he knows our
[1:54:16] heartaches he knows our troubles he
[1:54:18] knows what we're going through that's
[1:54:21] who Rose
[1:54:22] that's our hope
[1:54:25] that's why we can live
[1:54:28] because no matter how bad it gets
[1:54:33] he's there for us
[1:54:37] he's there to make intercession for us
[1:54:42] on our behalf he he didn't leave us
[1:54:45] alone
[1:54:48] it's wonderful what a wonderful hope we
[1:54:51] have this morning and Easter
[1:54:54] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:55:00] don't go without them
[1:55:03] because we have life
[1:55:05] and we have life eternal and we have
[1:55:09] life abundantly and we can ask
[1:55:12] whatsoever
[1:55:15] we have need of
[1:55:17] and he'll granted
[1:55:19] he has our well-being in mind
[1:55:23] oh
[1:55:24] what a hope
[1:55:26] what a resurrection
[1:55:29] what a resurrection that is what a
[1:55:31] resurrection this is this morning
[1:55:34] that he's come back in our day the same
[1:55:38] one that Rose came back to the Gentile
[1:55:42] world and once again showed that he was
[1:55:46] present with us by putting himself on
[1:55:49] display once again and watch them
[1:55:54] it's the same love
[1:55:57] it's the same Mercy it's the same works
[1:56:01] it's the same kindness
[1:56:06] because he's the same
[1:56:09] so we're we're going to finish this
[1:56:12] journey
[1:56:14] and I don't think we have long to go
[1:56:18] but we can't finish it without him
[1:56:25] and that's what we need
[1:56:28] because the victory is in love divine
[1:56:33] the victory is it in hate the victory is
[1:56:36] an argument the victory isn't in
[1:56:39] fighting with swords
[1:56:41] the victory is hiding yourself in the
[1:56:45] Cliff of the rock the victory is letting
[1:56:48] the love that was in him be shed abroad
[1:56:51] in your heart that's the victory because
[1:56:54] that's what allows you to turn the other
[1:56:56] cheek that's what allows you to go the
[1:56:59] extra mile that's what allows you to
[1:57:01] give your clear coat that it sets you
[1:57:04] free why because I'm not bound by this
[1:57:07] world this world is not my home I feel
[1:57:11] like traveling on
[1:57:15] and I've got this one great hope
[1:57:18] that he rose from the dead
[1:57:20] that he could give me
[1:57:24] his spirit
[1:57:27] if it would have stayed there he could
[1:57:29] have never given it
[1:57:32] but what was in this tomb
[1:57:36] there was death in here
[1:57:39] all's I am is a grave
[1:57:45] that's all I am
[1:57:47] this tomb
[1:57:49] had death
[1:57:51] but he rolled back the stone
[1:57:54] and he came out
[1:57:57] so he could come to your store
[1:58:00] he could come to your stone and he could
[1:58:03] roll it back
[1:58:05] and he could replace death
[1:58:08] with life
[1:58:10] he could bring heartache with joy
[1:58:16] suffering with peace
[1:58:19] sickness with healing
[1:58:22] he's so wonderful
[1:58:24] he's so real
[1:58:26] and he loves you
[1:58:28] and he cares for you you say I'm dark
[1:58:31] Brother David you don't know how dark I
[1:58:34] am you don't know what's going on in
[1:58:36] secret he does
[1:58:40] and he's standing at the tomb
[1:58:43] of your heart
[1:58:47] and saying let me roll open the door
[1:58:51] I'll come in and make it better I'm here
[1:58:54] for you

[1:59:02] you know when when I want someone to
[1:59:07] cover my back

[1:59:11] somebody like Benoit here
