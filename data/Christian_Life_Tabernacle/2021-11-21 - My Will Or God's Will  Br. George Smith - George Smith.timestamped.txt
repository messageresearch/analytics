[27:43] and destroy all them that afflict my
[27:46] soul
[27:46] for i am thy servant
[27:49] okay a few pages over to psalm i mean to
[27:52] a proverbs 14
[27:56] proverbs 14
[27:58] again we're dealing with
[28:01] god's speaking to us
[28:03] there is a way which seemeth right unto
[28:05] a man
[28:06] but the end of their the end thereof are
[28:08] the ways of death
[28:10] it might look good to you
[28:13] it might not be good
[28:14] now over here towards the end of the old
[28:17] testament
[28:18] in the book of jonah
[28:21] jonah is right before
[28:24] micah
[28:26] okay jonah chapter one
[28:30] tonight we're speaking on a subject my
[28:32] will or god's will
[28:34] something every one of us got to face
[28:36] when we wake up in the morning
[28:38] am i going to go god's way am i going to
[28:40] go my way
[28:42] jonah chapter 1 now the word of the lord
[28:45] came unto jonah the son of amitai saying
[28:48] arise go to nineveh that great city and
[28:52] cry against it for their wickedness has
[28:54] come up before me
[28:56] heavenly father thank you for your word
[28:59] thank you lord for your your obedient
[29:02] prophets of the past who have just said
[29:04] what you said
[29:06] and now we're here to remind people and
[29:08] to gather strength for our journey help
[29:10] us in jesus name amen
[29:12] you may be seated
[29:17] now tonight we're going to speak out of
[29:19] brother branham's absolute
[29:22] fair enough
[29:23] now my ideas
[29:25] absolute
[29:27] now jonah was an israelite now you all
[29:30] knew that but we're here to remind you
[29:32] jonah was israelite he lived in a little
[29:34] town called geth hepper it's uh just
[29:37] north of nazareth up in galilee
[29:40] and he was the first foreign missionary
[29:45] a missionary is an apostle one that is
[29:47] sent
[29:48] and according to brother branham it's
[29:49] the highest calling
[29:51] in the scripture in ephesians 4
[29:53] first apostles prophets and so forth
[29:57] elijah says in the end time 1954 i
[29:59] believe every christian is obligated
[30:02] not so much that you have to go over to
[30:04] the old country and preach but if you
[30:05] can't go
[30:06] help some help send somebody that can go
[30:10] real simple math don't have to wonder
[30:12] what it means
[30:13] everybody should hear the gospel at
[30:14] least once i want to do my part there's
[30:17] just something about missionary work
[30:19] that i just love it and just to know
[30:22] what you're doing you're doing god's
[30:24] will
[30:25] when you're giving to missions
[30:27] so we want to say what he says these are
[30:29] some of his words
[30:31] so missionary work
[30:33] is not only you know traveling to some
[30:35] foreign place where it's hot
[30:37] and there's bugs
[30:39] and all those things
[30:42] maybe they don't speak your language but
[30:44] missionary work is living for others
[30:46] right here
[30:48] you know everybody all your neighbors
[30:50] are watching you
[30:51] we're going through crisis after crisis
[30:53] after crisis and you still have a smile
[30:56] you still have a clean face you still
[30:58] you know seem to have gas for your car
[31:00] they're watching these things you see
[31:02] and so everybody wants eternal life
[31:04] or everybody wants to go to heaven right
[31:06] no if you take a poll tomorrow the
[31:08] people you work with well sure everybody
[31:09] wants to go to heaven
[31:11] they just don't want to go today
[31:13] okay
[31:15] yeah
[31:17] because no one wants to die and face
[31:19] eternal separation from god and from
[31:22] everybody else
[31:23] so i know that you all are you've always
[31:25] been interested in missionary work
[31:26] you've send missionaries you've helped
[31:28] me and different things and even today i
[31:31] collected some clothes that are going to
[31:32] go to venezuela
[31:34] okay we're going to talk about that in a
[31:36] minute
[31:36] but um
[31:37] brother branham says over here on that
[31:39] day on calvary
[31:41] he was just one man the perfect man he
[31:43] gave his life
[31:44] and he made an example for you and me
[31:47] now what must we do the first thing i
[31:49] want to say jesus never lived for
[31:51] himself
[31:52] okay he lived for others
[31:55] that's perfectly eternal life when you
[31:57] say you go to church and do good and all
[31:59] that's good but when you live your life
[32:01] just to yourself
[32:03] you're not showing eternal life
[32:05] okay life eternal life is living for
[32:08] others it proved it when it came as the
[32:10] lamb of god he lived and had eternal
[32:13] life because he did not live for himself
[32:15] he lived for others
[32:17] and you receive eternal life by
[32:19] receiving that day on calvary and you
[32:21] don't live for yourself no more you live
[32:23] for others
[32:25] so
[32:26] before we get too far into this we just
[32:28] want to
[32:29] uh dwell on this on the foreign missions
[32:31] for a minute because that's that's what
[32:33] um
[32:35] jonah was he was the first foreign
[32:36] missionary
[32:37] god gave him these instructions and
[32:39] we're going to get into that whether he
[32:41] you know if it's god's will or if it's
[32:44] our will we have a choice every day we
[32:46] live in america we've got choices so far
[32:49] and um
[32:50] if you noticed over in our study in the
[32:52] book of acts when we were in chapter 11
[32:55] there were some needs in jerusalem so
[32:57] paul
[32:59] and silas and them they were over in the
[33:00] church in antioch and they collected an
[33:02] offering and put it in the hands of the
[33:04] missionaries and they took
[33:06] missionary aid to
[33:08] the
[33:08] people in jerusalem
[33:10] and um
[33:11] so
[33:12] every every two weeks we're sending
[33:14] money we're sending clothes we're
[33:16] sending toothpaste and all kinds of
[33:17] things
[33:18] to the saints in a certain area of
[33:20] venezuela now not everybody's starving
[33:22] but some are going through very bad
[33:24] times what you read about it which you
[33:26] see on on the news it's much worse than
[33:29] that because they're kind of giving us
[33:30] the rosy picture but it's very very bad
[33:33] and so we're sending them church age
[33:34] books and different things now they they
[33:36] don't have any way that you can just
[33:38] send stuff in like books from another
[33:40] country we have an angle that we can
[33:42] send stuff because a pastor i knew years
[33:45] ago he's passed on now but his son
[33:49] operates a a shipping company in miami
[33:52] so i put the stuff in a you know ups
[33:54] goes to him then he puts it in a boat
[33:56] and his son operates the other end in
[33:59] venezuela to receive it and then it is
[34:01] dispersed to the believers so it works
[34:04] just fine
[34:05] now another thing is that over five
[34:07] million people have escaped from
[34:09] venezuela
[34:11] we got one sitting right here
[34:13] and
[34:14] they they couldn't take it no more
[34:16] there's nothing to eat there's no job
[34:17] there's no nothing so they left 5
[34:19] million now they get to these other
[34:21] countries such as ecuador and
[34:24] peru and colombia and different places
[34:26] they want to they want to send some
[34:28] money home well guess what they don't
[34:30] have any they don't have any western
[34:31] union no everything americans cut off
[34:33] except for the money they love the
[34:35] dollars
[34:36] so
[34:37] they send me western union money
[34:40] then i go over and put it in
[34:43] a bank and then have an automatic
[34:45] transfer to
[34:46] a friend who in venezuela who has an
[34:49] american bank account and he pays it out
[34:53] sounds like money laundering did it well
[34:55] that's exactly what it is
[34:57] we have to get it to him you know
[34:59] and um
[35:00] and so you know the book of acts is the
[35:02] only book that's not finished in the
[35:03] bible we're it's still going on
[35:05] all the things you see in the book of
[35:06] acts it's happening today
[35:08] um we're also helping build this church
[35:11] over in malawi i don't know if i've told
[35:13] you about that last time but these
[35:14] people got thrown out of their church
[35:16] they had a nice church but the man that
[35:18] donated the property some evil spirit
[35:20] got into me well i want my property back
[35:22] all you guys don't agree with me stay
[35:24] out anyway so here's all these people
[35:26] meeting under a tree
[35:28] and they wrote and they said now we've
[35:30] got a certain amount of money saved up
[35:31] to buy property to you know continue but
[35:34] we need a little more so they need about
[35:35] a thousand dollars well while i'm
[35:37] collecting the thousand dollars
[35:39] the property gets sold to the catholic
[35:40] church
[35:41] and i told don't worry god's got
[35:43] something better for you
[35:44] so sure enough they go out of town and
[35:46] they found a nice piece a couple acres
[35:48] and um
[35:50] they um
[35:51] they started you know digging it by hand
[35:53] no machinery they go about the size of
[35:55] this church there probably and all the
[35:57] digging and everything by hand so we've
[35:59] been helping them so as they go along
[36:01] they said wow this is going to be good
[36:03] we'll call this the george smith
[36:04] tabernacle
[36:06] so i don't think so we're going to call
[36:08] this walking in the light tabernacle
[36:11] they're they're almost finished with
[36:12] that
[36:13] and um
[36:14] and like the the church age book we've
[36:16] been printing that you know in this
[36:17] country but then we see the big need
[36:19] overseas so we've been printing
[36:21] thousands in china distributing to
[36:24] uh the spanish-speaking countries now to
[36:25] the english-speaking countries
[36:27] and um
[36:28] it's it's the book that
[36:30] just tells the whole story
[36:32] if you if they took everything else away
[36:33] you had your bible in church age book
[36:35] you'd you'd pretty much have what
[36:36] brother brahm said you know
[36:38] uh and i also noticed going through the
[36:39] book of acts nobody was out there
[36:41] telling everybody you know they weren't
[36:42] preaching yeah jesus said jesus said no
[36:45] their message was all these scriptures
[36:47] that you all memorized all these years
[36:48] here's the fulfillment that was their
[36:50] message and that's what we're doing
[36:52] today god has sent a restoration prophet
[36:54] now here's what he said
[36:56] so we're busy with all this going on
[36:59] and um
[37:00] so that's pretty much our missionary
[37:02] report but you see we have joan over
[37:04] here our brother jonah he had a direct
[37:07] commission from god
[37:08] go preach to the enemy their wickedness
[37:11] has come up before me i can't stand it
[37:12] anymore you go preach to him
[37:14] there's only one problem jonah was
[37:17] jewish and the people of nineveh were
[37:19] gentiles
[37:20] very serious segregation
[37:23] now nineveh was the capital of assyria
[37:26] you can look at your maps later not now
[37:28] and um
[37:29] it was the capital of um assyria which
[37:32] is currently northern iraq
[37:34] a very wicked sinful people very cruel
[37:37] violent city of over 120 000 people
[37:40] and at the time it was a large city it
[37:42] took three days to walk around it
[37:45] the assyrians
[37:47] up there
[37:48] you know in nineveh were constantly
[37:50] tormenting and oppressing the israelites
[37:54] yeah they didn't start in your lifetimes
[37:56] 3 000 years ago they were oppressing
[37:58] israelites you know it's been going on
[38:00] for years so god was sending his prophet
[38:02] right into the jaws of danger to face
[38:05] the enemy go cry against it
[38:08] it was time for repentance okay
[38:11] and so warning before judgment
[38:14] and don't be falling asleep because i
[38:15] got my friend here
[38:18] i'm watching you
[38:20] and so um
[38:22] god always sends warning before judgment
[38:24] when jesus was here he walked through
[38:26] israel sometimes he wrote a donkey but
[38:28] mostly walked
[38:30] and he performed miracles everywhere
[38:32] preaching people were being healed and
[38:34] so forth but there was three towns that
[38:36] just couldn't get it they just wouldn't
[38:38] believe they wouldn't pay attention
[38:41] now we have
[38:42] uh bethsaida
[38:44] quarazim and capernaum
[38:46] brother brahm talks about these many
[38:47] times it's in the scripture
[38:49] and so he cursed them
[38:52] and next day everything went on as
[38:53] normal
[38:54] 60 years later the earthquake came and
[38:57] destroyed those cities
[38:58] now since israel has become a nation
[39:00] they have restored every town and
[39:02] village everything's back the way it was
[39:04] originally except for those three
[39:06] villages
[39:07] nothing is there because jesus cursed
[39:09] them it's a pile of rocks nothing more
[39:11] there's a few people in capernaum
[39:14] because the catholic church owns it and
[39:15] they've made a tourist thing out of it
[39:17] that's fine
[39:18] but you see
[39:19] when brother branham preached the
[39:20] choosing of a bride which is one of the
[39:23] original tapes that your pastor heard
[39:25] and
[39:26] left california
[39:27] that was
[39:28] april of 1965.
[39:31] and brother branham said it's gonna be a
[39:32] piece three to four hundred three
[39:34] hundred to four hundred miles wide
[39:36] fifteen hundred miles long
[39:39] now when that goes into the ocean
[39:41] there's no repair
[39:42] there's no fema there's no washington
[39:44] there's no nothing it's the end that
[39:46] wave is going to go around the world
[39:48] okay
[39:49] so
[39:50] um
[39:51] why is that important to us over here
[39:53] man we're safe here in dallas there's no
[39:54] river there's no nothing well guess what
[39:57] your world's fixing to get turned upside
[39:58] down
[39:59] all this nice stuff it's going to
[40:01] disappear pretty soon
[40:02] and over in first corinthians paul said
[40:04] all these things happen to them for
[40:06] examples and are written for our
[40:08] admonition
[40:10] upon whom upon whom the ends of the
[40:12] world have come that's us that wasn't
[40:14] then that's written for laodicea you see
[40:17] we are the end time generation the end
[40:19] of the ages is at the door
[40:22] so the world has fallen apart in case
[40:24] you haven't noticed it's falling apart
[40:27] there's no way out of this credit
[40:28] problem we have we can't print enough
[40:30] money now they're going to burn things
[40:32] now they're going to steal things out of
[40:33] the stores there's no going back you see
[40:36] and jesus said this is coming he said
[40:38] when you see this coming in luke 21 28
[40:42] when these things begin to happen
[40:44] look up
[40:45] your redemption is drawing nigh he
[40:47] didn't tell us to vote in the right
[40:48] people he didn't tell us to make some
[40:49] more money to try to fix it no just
[40:51] forget it look up we're leaving
[40:54] okay
[40:55] so once again we have a message of
[40:57] warning before judgment
[40:59] now back there in capernaum
[41:02] in those days 60 years went by in the
[41:05] earthquake and destroyed those those
[41:07] towns
[41:08] and today pile of rocks one interesting
[41:10] thing along that same line
[41:14] when i used to travel to south america
[41:17] got there one day and they were having
[41:18] like a youth camp and so this one girl
[41:20] comes up and says oh brother george i
[41:21] need prayer and what's wrong well you
[41:23] know my house everything's going wrong
[41:25] and she had all kinds of problems
[41:26] and i knew that her name was bethsaida
[41:29] well
[41:30] bible name
[41:32] but you know there's bible names you
[41:34] don't want to put on your kids right
[41:36] nobody calls your child ananias or
[41:38] sapphira
[41:40] you know
[41:41] and so i said well what's your other
[41:42] name well my other name is esther well
[41:45] then starting now your name is esther
[41:47] and sure enough things got better
[41:49] names mean things you know
[41:52] so
[41:54] um
[41:55] we can choose we can choose to go with
[41:57] the world and all of its problems and
[41:59] all the chaos or we can choose to be
[42:01] here in church and look up
[42:03] we need a shaking we need to shake off
[42:05] the shackles of sin the shackles of
[42:08] attitude of non-concern and who cares
[42:11] that's not that's not the christian
[42:12] attitude you see we need a trimming a
[42:15] cut away cutting a way of lazy idle no
[42:18] interest attitudes and the idolatry
[42:21] it's everywhere
[42:24] idolatry
[42:26] so we're far beyond an aspirin or an
[42:28] alka-seltzer and you'll be okay no
[42:30] that's not the right solution you won't
[42:32] be okay you're going down
[42:34] we need major surgery
[42:36] amen
[42:38] we can't afford to continue to play
[42:40] church
[42:41] it's high time that we actively seek the
[42:43] presence of god
[42:44] in our individual lives get in the
[42:46] closet seek how to please god
[42:49] don't worry about brother david or me or
[42:51] anybody else just how can you please god
[42:53] and god will lead you through the word
[42:55] you see
[42:56] so his will is what we need in our lives
[43:00] now first john 4 20 if a man says i love
[43:03] god
[43:04] and hates his brother
[43:06] he's a liar
[43:07] and there's some sitting right here
[43:10] yeah
[43:12] for he that loves not his brother
[43:14] whom we can see how can he say he loves
[43:16] god whom he hasn't seen it's not
[43:18] possible see so however we treat each
[43:21] other
[43:22] believer to believer that's the way we
[43:24] treat god god's not some foreign thing
[43:27] no god's in your brother your sister
[43:30] and so he's watching our reaction to
[43:32] every test you think you've got problems
[43:34] so we're going to get into some problems
[43:36] here jonah had some serious problems
[43:39] because he didn't pay attention
[43:41] and so
[43:43] god could solve all your problems by the
[43:45] time the sun comes up you fill your bank
[43:47] account pay off your car all these
[43:49] things that we think are so important
[43:51] all that could be solved by the time the
[43:52] sun comes up no he lets it go on and on
[43:56] and on and he's watching for reactions
[43:58] you know because under under duress
[44:00] under under trial the reactions come to
[44:02] the surface you know
[44:06] and so
[44:06] um jonah
[44:09] was god's man of the hour okay
[44:11] and he had a clear-cut decision from god
[44:13] a commandment from god clear-cut go cry
[44:16] against their sin their corruption i
[44:18] know about the segregation i know all
[44:20] about your fears and your doubts go
[44:22] anyway
[44:24] okay so he's got it clear
[44:26] verse three
[44:27] but jonah anytime the
[44:30] verse starts with but we got a problem
[44:33] but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish
[44:37] from the presence of the lord
[44:39] and went down to joppa down to the coast
[44:42] found a ship that's going to tarshish
[44:44] and so he paid the fare went down into
[44:47] it to go with them to tarshish from the
[44:49] presence of the lord
[44:51] it's not looking good
[44:53] jonah wasn't just anybody he was god's
[44:55] prophet he was god's mouthpiece it's
[44:58] looking kind of bad for him
[45:00] so
[45:01] he didn't break relationship he only
[45:03] broke fellowship
[45:05] sometimes we go our way well i think
[45:08] it'd be better god told you go this way
[45:10] you go this way i think it'd be better
[45:12] for some reason
[45:13] and you're still god's child
[45:15] and if you are he will jerk you back
[45:18] it's going to cost you a little bit
[45:20] but at least he cared if he doesn't if
[45:22] he doesn't touch it lets you go well too
[45:25] bad
[45:27] so brother branham says in another place
[45:29] something that you don't want to hear
[45:31] but it's part of it anointed prophets
[45:33] make wrong decisions
[45:35] they're humans
[45:37] because we're going to cut this idolatry
[45:39] thing see
[45:40] so here's jonah he gets up the next
[45:43] morning
[45:44] and uh god told him to go one way you
[45:46] studied it out in your maps and things
[45:48] it works out
[45:50] he goes down to the coast where the
[45:52] ships are
[45:53] now these are merchant ships okay they
[45:55] could be a hundred feet long they could
[45:57] carry 300 tons of grain
[46:00] and
[46:01] it's a merchant ship and he he reaches
[46:04] in his pocket he gets some tithe money
[46:05] and he pays the ticket and he's going to
[46:07] go far from the presence of the lord now
[46:09] forget it you know
[46:11] well
[46:12] these guys operating these boats they're
[46:15] they're watching the weather they're not
[46:16] just going to go off into bad weather so
[46:18] they wait till the right weather and
[46:21] they take off
[46:22] well they get out there a little ways
[46:24] here's a big storm how would this come
[46:25] from so they start throwing stuff off of
[46:27] the boat throwing some of the grain out
[46:30] and
[46:31] um they um
[46:33] they had this tourist at least one but
[46:35] you know
[46:36] we know they had at least one tourist
[46:37] and he he tried to act like the world
[46:39] he's tried to you know slide in there he
[46:41] didn't have his profit suit on didn't
[46:42] have his little tag you know elder so
[46:44] and so he's just he just
[46:46] was acting like one of them
[46:48] and he's down there asleep and this
[46:49] boat's going everywhere
[46:51] and so kind of like peter you know when
[46:53] he when he snuck in you know peter had
[46:55] one problem he he talked when he
[46:57] shouldn't have talked
[46:58] now that was before the holy ghost okay
[47:00] later he got straightened out but see um
[47:03] they're in the garden in gethsemane and
[47:05] boy he's going to defend and here comes
[47:07] the the authorities they're going to
[47:08] arrest jesus and he gets out the sword
[47:11] and slices off the guy's ear
[47:13] remember
[47:14] yeah so the ears laid on the ground now
[47:16] what are they going to do
[47:18] so jesus reaches down
[47:20] puts it back on they should all been on
[47:21] their knees
[47:23] nope
[47:24] they hate it so bad
[47:26] so they take jesus over to caiaphas
[47:28] house
[47:29] and somehow peter paid somebody
[47:33] and he gets in there he's in the yard
[47:35] now and he's uh he's acting like he's
[47:38] just one of the guys down the street
[47:40] he doesn't he doesn't act like a guy
[47:42] with the keys you know he he just
[47:44] tries to
[47:46] sneak in
[47:47] and when they when they serve the t
[47:49] and he said thank you
[47:51] that's a galilean accent
[47:53] just like you know when canadians come
[47:54] in here you know how they talk different
[47:56] well he was different and so oh you're
[47:58] one of them never heard of him
[48:01] yeah it was just a few hours it wasn't
[48:03] 50 years later and so here's jonah the
[48:05] same way try to sneak in and be one of
[48:07] the guys you know
[48:08] well in verse 17 the lord prepared a
[48:11] great fish for what to swallow up jonah
[48:14] so when he comes up on deck and he sees
[48:16] how that these guys are burning little
[48:18] candles and they're worshiping their
[48:19] gods and this thing gets worse
[48:21] he says boys i know what the problem is
[48:23] so he had a little bit of discernment
[48:25] and he said if you throw me overboard
[48:26] everything will be cool
[48:28] well we'll try anything well when they
[48:30] throw him overboard
[48:32] he barely got wet because the fish was
[48:33] right there fish been following this
[48:35] boat for a long time
[48:36] yeah and so when they throw him over he
[48:38] goes in okay
[48:40] well you see there's no surprises with
[48:42] god
[48:44] it was a special fish that had oxygen
[48:49] there was no lights but he did have
[48:51] oxygen
[48:52] and jonah could live there now he's in
[48:54] the fish
[48:56] and we're not going to argue about what
[48:57] kind of fish it was it was a special
[48:59] fish okay our god can do anything
[49:02] and so he's in the stomach of the fish
[49:04] now
[49:05] and
[49:06] it's dark so eyes don't work
[49:09] and it smelled really bad but you know
[49:10] got to breathe but he did keep his mouth
[49:13] shut
[49:14] yeah he learned real quick oh
[49:18] and so he punch well soft everywhere you
[49:20] know and he's probably up to his waist
[49:22] and you know what
[49:24] and um
[49:25] so he had lots of symptoms okay
[49:28] and the next time you think you got it
[49:30] bad and things aren't working out just
[49:32] right and the kids don't want to take
[49:33] out the trash and all these little
[49:35] problems that you go through
[49:37] think of jonah he had problems you see
[49:41] he had plenty of time to think about his
[49:43] actions over here in
[49:45] verse 3
[49:46] going from the presence of the lord you
[49:48] know
[49:50] and so
[49:51] um
[49:53] so he's he's alive but probably wish he
[49:56] was dead
[49:57] and he doesn't know how long he's going
[49:58] to be in here you know they didn't tell
[50:00] you you've been here three days he's in
[50:02] there he doesn't know how long
[50:04] and
[50:05] so he closed his eyes you know
[50:08] these symptoms are all lying vanities
[50:11] now he was very much alive he could
[50:13] touch taste
[50:14] couldn't see he could hear he could
[50:16] smell
[50:18] and god supplied oxygen
[50:20] well now we got some unforeseen
[50:22] circumstances you know that five dollar
[50:24] ticket he bought to go on this tour i
[50:26] don't know i thought it was gonna be
[50:27] different because according to my
[50:29] calculations i'm sure pastor david has
[50:31] heard that many times well i think this
[50:33] and i think that you know the reason god
[50:36] allows hard-headed sheep to be in the
[50:38] church now we're not going to get no
[50:41] hands but
[50:42] every church has one or two
[50:44] the
[50:45] reason god allows these hard-headed
[50:47] sheep is for the perfection of the
[50:48] pastor
[50:50] he's human too
[50:51] you know
[50:53] yeah
[50:54] and so
[50:56] the symptoms you know are very real and
[50:58] he had to ignore
[50:59] his present reality and focus his mind
[51:02] on the word of god
[51:04] now guess what he did not have
[51:06] a cell phone okay
[51:08] he didn't have an ipad he had it stored
[51:10] up here
[51:13] now so many people are wondering why
[51:14] we're not speaking spanish because not
[51:15] enough people came to switch okay and we
[51:18] couldn't find a translator brave enough
[51:19] to stand up here
[51:20] so
[51:22] um
[51:23] and so he
[51:24] when he was home and he read his bible
[51:27] he had it stored and that's what you
[51:29] need to be doing because you don't know
[51:30] what's going to happen tomorrow
[51:32] you might be in jail or someplace so
[51:34] while you have the opportunity read the
[51:36] word get familiar with the word because
[51:38] we are one with the word
[51:41] and so he had it stored
[51:43] and i didn't have any prophetic
[51:44] manuscripts no pictures nothing he got
[51:46] serious about praying and he didn't know
[51:48] it was only going to be three days
[51:50] now our prophet says to us the devils
[51:52] tremble when the weakest of saints goes
[51:54] to their knees what a power and a
[51:56] privilege has been given to the church
[51:58] of the living god when you fall to your
[52:01] knees in prayer even the devils tremble
[52:04] to the weakest of them in other words
[52:06] the one that was just converted last
[52:07] week when he goes to his knees the
[52:09] devil's tremble
[52:11] some of you people have been praying for
[52:12] years
[52:13] and god bless you but you got to get
[52:15] more serious
[52:16] in another place he says the weakest
[52:18] christian here tonight can defeat satan
[52:20] anywhere anyplace any time under any
[52:23] conditions with thus saith the lord
[52:25] you just got to believe it
[52:27] okay so why
[52:29] why is jonah in this
[52:30] situation well apparently from what
[52:33] we've read he shirked away
[52:36] he turned from his duty you know
[52:39] and he ran from responsibility he ran
[52:42] from the presence of god he ran from the
[52:44] will of god and chose his own will
[52:47] remember my will or god's will
[52:50] only the fellowship was broken not the
[52:52] relationship
[52:53] and so every one of us had to make a
[52:55] choice to be sitting here today
[52:57] you could be anywhere
[52:59] you could be over there at the fitness
[53:00] gym or wherever you haven't suffered but
[53:02] you chose to come here you see you made
[53:04] a choice
[53:06] you see
[53:06] and so jonah made a choice and was
[53:08] willing to pay a price to go his own way
[53:11] he just didn't have any idea how high
[53:13] the price was really going to be you see
[53:16] so he chose to go in the opposite
[53:18] direction
[53:19] god commanded him you can study it
[53:21] god said i want you to go northeast so
[53:24] we're in dallas now son i want you to go
[53:26] to cincinnati for example or louisville
[53:30] and he chose to go southwest i think
[53:32] i'll go to el paso instead
[53:34] it was just that opposite 180 degrees
[53:36] you see
[53:37] he probably thought well you know
[53:38] there's a lot of sinful people in
[53:40] tarshish i'll just go preach over there
[53:42] no more not so much hassle opposition
[53:45] and god would have blessed his word
[53:47] you see but obedience is far better than
[53:50] sacrifice
[53:52] and i'm sure you've got many testimonies
[53:53] to prove that but you see we have we
[53:56] have catholics here in town we've got
[53:58] baptist charismatics and so forth using
[54:01] this same bible
[54:04] okay
[54:05] only the mormons have an additional
[54:06] bible that gives them a way out but none
[54:09] of them are living the word you see
[54:12] and
[54:13] so there's miracles in some of those
[54:15] churches they believe they're
[54:16] approaching god
[54:18] now we're going to get to that in a
[54:19] minute here because god honors faith
[54:23] the prophet says in thirsting for life
[54:25] great message uh march of 60. and this
[54:28] great pillar of fire the angel of god
[54:31] now we've got the picture right over
[54:32] here we're going to got a better one at
[54:35] the house going to come up here soon
[54:37] that's the pillar of fire that's the
[54:38] same fire that led to children of israel
[54:40] so he says this great pillar of fire the
[54:42] angel of god the logos that went out of
[54:44] god that led the children of israel
[54:46] through the wilderness when it came
[54:47] amongst the people it separated itself
[54:50] and great licks of fire began to come
[54:52] upon each one as the pillar fire began
[54:54] to break up
[54:55] god dividing himself amongst his people
[54:57] that ought to tear the heart out of
[54:59] anybody
[55:00] god tearing himself apart that he might
[55:02] divide himself a little bit on each one
[55:04] of us
[55:05] he goes on can you see why i'm standing
[55:07] for the unity of every church and some
[55:10] people stop there
[55:12] no you that's why he said say what the
[55:13] tapes say because sometimes when it's
[55:15] printed
[55:17] a little strange you got to know where
[55:18] the commas belong
[55:19] can you see why i'm standing for the
[55:21] unity of every church
[55:22] every full gospel church every believer
[55:25] that's where he's getting to see the
[55:27] unity of every believer we ought to be
[55:29] of one heart one mind one accord no
[55:32] matter how much we differ in the
[55:33] scriptures and it's going to happen
[55:36] if i bought the house over here on
[55:38] shirley way
[55:40] next to the pastor
[55:42] eventually we'd find something to argue
[55:43] about
[55:44] i guarantee you
[55:47] no matter how much we differ in the
[55:48] scriptures or you know your favorite
[55:50] quotation that might be
[55:53] one can see it this way
[55:55] that has nothing to do with it but in
[55:57] principle we ought to stand one great
[56:00] mighty army of god marching on because
[56:02] each one of you in your peculiarity
[56:05] now all these words are important
[56:08] wake up
[56:10] see you're looking at one person i'm
[56:12] looking at all the peculiarities
[56:14] yeah
[56:16] so he says here
[56:18] um because each one of you in your
[56:20] peculiarity
[56:21] god has proved that he's ignoring your
[56:23] doctor oh man i thought and doctrine was
[56:25] important well it's important but it's
[56:27] not the main thing
[56:28] god ignores your doctrine because he
[56:30] gave you the holy ghost and the bible
[56:32] said he gave them the holy ghost that
[56:33] obeyed him
[56:35] now if i obey him my peculiar way and
[56:37] you obey him in your peculiar way he
[56:39] gave us both the holy ghost so we ought
[56:41] to be christian brothers and sisters
[56:43] enough to arm up that's not single file
[56:45] single file is not god's way arm up you
[56:48] know make a sweep
[56:49] so arm up together
[56:52] and march on for one great purpose the
[56:54] gospel
[56:55] that your neighbors can see jesus christ
[56:57] alive in you
[56:59] because they don't care what william
[57:00] branham said okay
[57:02] they're looking for somebody who lives
[57:03] this bible
[57:07] but you see unto us he has revealed the
[57:10] mysteries of the kingdom we're more
[57:13] revelated you know
[57:15] and so god does not hold them
[57:16] accountable for the things that you know
[57:19] he has trusted us with his secrets
[57:22] the fullness of the revelation so god
[57:24] has a perfect will and he's got a
[57:26] permissive will for each one of us
[57:29] yeah no matter what your age is so let's
[57:31] see what the prophet says here in 1965
[57:34] we try to work on god's permissive will
[57:36] and he will permit it but also if we
[57:38] take his permissive will though it's not
[57:40] right he will make his permissive will
[57:42] work out together to glorify his perfect
[57:45] will
[57:46] so there is hope you see but there will
[57:48] be a price to pay
[57:50] another place he says we must submit
[57:52] ourselves to his will and to his word
[57:55] don't question it
[57:57] believe it don't try to find a way
[57:59] around it and you'll smooth it and all
[58:01] just take it the way it is somebody
[58:03] wants to go around and make some other
[58:05] way and when you do you find yourself
[58:07] going on you find god blessing you but
[58:10] you're working in his permissive will
[58:11] and not his perfect divine will
[58:14] so
[58:16] i go a lot of places sometimes we have
[58:18] questions and answers we might do that
[58:20] next time here
[58:21] yeah
[58:22] yeah
[58:23] see what's on your mind so people ask me
[58:26] how can i know god's perfect will for my
[58:28] life
[58:29] very good question
[58:30] okay wake up on the front row here
[58:33] we might hand out popsicles in a few
[58:34] minutes
[58:37] god's word god's spirit and god's will
[58:39] always run in parallel they never cross
[58:41] they run together in parallel okay
[58:44] okay so these three always agree the
[58:47] word the will and the spirit
[58:50] they work in harmony now some people
[58:52] have certain portions of the word
[58:54] memorized
[58:56] but their wires are crossed
[58:57] and they display a contrary spirit
[59:00] how can that be they're quoting the
[59:01] bible but with the contrary spirit
[59:04] well anybody can memorize scripture
[59:07] so
[59:08] uh
[59:09] when there's no harmony
[59:11] with the rest of the word then you have
[59:13] bad fruit results in contrary you know
[59:16] to the word now john 4 23 is where jesus
[59:20] met the woman at the well and brother
[59:22] branham talks about her just about on
[59:23] every tape if you've listened very far
[59:26] and
[59:27] he um
[59:28] he you know had a little debate there
[59:30] but he said look woman god is looking
[59:32] for those that worship him in spirit
[59:36] and in truth
[59:37] in other words balanced spirit and truth
[59:40] that's what we're after
[59:42] okay
[59:43] so they asked brother branham the same
[59:44] question how do you feel is the best way
[59:46] to find the lord's will in some
[59:47] important matters and we all have
[59:49] important matters whether it's the
[59:51] girlfriend whether it's the color of the
[59:52] car or whatever
[59:55] when you stand there look at all these
[59:56] clothes what's what i wear today you
[59:58] know some people only got one other
[59:59] change of clothes so you're very very
[1:00:01] blessed
[1:00:03] how do you feel is the best way to find
[1:00:04] the lord's will in some important
[1:00:06] matters 1961. i tell you dear friend the
[1:00:08] best way to find the will of god in some
[1:00:10] important matters is prayer
[1:00:12] oh we already knew that
[1:00:14] well there's more to it so we've got one
[1:00:16] got prayer
[1:00:18] um
[1:00:19] now here's the way i do it i take it
[1:00:21] before the lord and it's always been my
[1:00:22] strength i wait up oh wait
[1:00:25] well that's foreign word to 21st century
[1:00:28] i got a friend over in north carolina
[1:00:30] he's a real good coffee drinker and
[1:00:32] he'll go by
[1:00:33] starbucks if there's four cars he'll go
[1:00:35] across the street and buy mcdonald's he
[1:00:37] won't wait
[1:00:39] yeah it's just that way so we got prayer
[1:00:41] we've got weight okay got it
[1:00:44] i take it before the lord it's always
[1:00:45] been my strength i wait upon the lord
[1:00:47] and see what he says and then i just let
[1:00:49] myself be neutral oh
[1:00:52] it's hard to be neutral when you want
[1:00:54] something
[1:00:56] and you want it bad it's it's hard to
[1:00:58] pray and wait and neutral right
[1:01:00] let myself be neutral don't take either
[1:01:02] side so if i was in your place and
[1:01:04] didn't have these visions from the lord
[1:01:06] i would just wait upon the lord and say
[1:01:07] now lord you show me what is the
[1:01:09] decision to make
[1:01:10] and then the way you feel led to do it
[1:01:12] then wait a little longer then wait a
[1:01:14] little longer what's all this weight
[1:01:17] and see which way god leans towards now
[1:01:19] father in my heart you know it doesn't
[1:01:21] matter i want to know what you want to
[1:01:23] do about it so you wait you pray and you
[1:01:26] don't take a side and god will show you
[1:01:29] which is the right way
[1:01:31] so back here with our brother jonah
[1:01:34] god did make his permissive will turn
[1:01:36] around to accomplish his perfect will
[1:01:38] okay
[1:01:39] the special fish
[1:01:41] delivered jonah
[1:01:42] and the word of the lord reminded him
[1:01:44] once more
[1:01:46] now we're going to get into something
[1:01:47] sticky here and we hope that the you
[1:01:49] know idolatrous people don't get too
[1:01:51] upset
[1:01:52] when you listen to brother bram tell the
[1:01:54] same story more than once he tells the
[1:01:56] part about you know that the people of
[1:01:58] nineveh worship the god of the sea so
[1:02:00] the fish comes up there sticks his
[1:02:02] tongue out now comes the prophet and
[1:02:04] they all believed
[1:02:06] well i'd already read the bible at least
[1:02:07] twice now wait a minute
[1:02:09] he did tell us to check it out with the
[1:02:11] word and then i heard him say yeah i
[1:02:13] read that in a book okay so you read in
[1:02:15] the book sounds good but that's not what
[1:02:17] the bible says okay
[1:02:19] it says here in chapter
[1:02:21] where we at chapter 3
[1:02:23] uh in chapter 2 verse 10 and the lord
[1:02:26] spake unto the fish
[1:02:28] and it vomited out jonah upon the dry
[1:02:30] land
[1:02:31] and the word of the lord came unto jonah
[1:02:33] the second time saying
[1:02:35] arise go to nineveh and so forth
[1:02:39] so
[1:02:40] the fish is in the mediterranean
[1:02:42] i don't know if you you know in the
[1:02:43] globe you know it's got the
[1:02:44] mediterranean well that's where that's
[1:02:47] where the fish is and jonah's in the
[1:02:49] fish
[1:02:50] now for for the fish to get to nineveh
[1:02:52] he'd have to go out through gibraltar
[1:02:54] come all the way around africa and come
[1:02:56] up this river up there where nineveh is
[1:02:58] that's not possible that's why it says
[1:03:00] it vomited mount on dry land he's been
[1:03:02] in there for like you know almost three
[1:03:03] days
[1:03:04] and
[1:03:05] god speaks to him hey vomit him out so
[1:03:08] now
[1:03:09] you remember had his traveling with
[1:03:10] little kids sometimes they get sick
[1:03:13] you got a big mess
[1:03:16] i raised little kids
[1:03:18] so now here he is he's totally covered
[1:03:20] in fish vomit
[1:03:24] he lands on dry land
[1:03:26] so he's rolling in the sand never really
[1:03:28] got a mess
[1:03:32] the only solution for him is to go down
[1:03:33] to car wash right
[1:03:36] so
[1:03:37] he got a second chance
[1:03:38] after he got cleaned up got some new
[1:03:40] clothes
[1:03:41] chapter 3 records the greatest reaction
[1:03:43] to the preaching of the word of god
[1:03:45] greatest
[1:03:46] greatest revival in recorded history the
[1:03:48] entire city of 120 000 believed and
[1:03:51] stayed back the power of god the wrath
[1:03:53] of god they had a choice repent
[1:03:56] or go down with the unbeliever
[1:03:58] but guess what about 150 years later
[1:04:01] they entirely departed from the plan of
[1:04:03] god
[1:04:04] they forgot about the mercy they forgot
[1:04:06] about the forgiveness
[1:04:08] and the babylonians came down in 621 bc
[1:04:11] utterly destroyed the city now they
[1:04:13] didn't have bulldozers i don't know what
[1:04:15] they had but they didn't have the stuff
[1:04:17] we have today
[1:04:19] so devastating was the destruction that
[1:04:21] the ruins were only discovered a little
[1:04:24] over 100 years ago
[1:04:26] yeah 2500 years later
[1:04:29] such a hatred to destroy and we're
[1:04:31] seeing it in our cities in this country
[1:04:33] right now okay it's time for wake up
[1:04:39] i might throw it at you
[1:04:42] and so
[1:04:43] we're seeing that same thing just a
[1:04:44] hatred to destroy burned they have no
[1:04:47] reason no common sense
[1:04:49] scofield even says here such is the way
[1:04:51] of god
[1:04:52] light rejected brings destruction
[1:04:56] exactly true
[1:04:58] a long time ago in 1956 brother brahm
[1:05:00] said now this year is your decision for
[1:05:03] this country and i believe they're going
[1:05:05] to go the wrong way
[1:05:06] and sure enough you've lived long enough
[1:05:08] to see
[1:05:10] the results of those decisions back
[1:05:12] there
[1:05:14] okay
[1:05:15] god always warns first we're seeing
[1:05:17] today prophecy fulfilled
[1:05:20] everywhere hatred malice perversion
[1:05:23] so jonah was in fact a very crucial part
[1:05:26] of a much larger picture okay
[1:05:29] so much so that it's repeated in the new
[1:05:31] testament of our lord in matthew chapter
[1:05:33] 12.
[1:05:34] so here's the the lesson when you don't
[1:05:36] fully understand something maybe going
[1:05:38] on in this church or another family or
[1:05:41] or why is brother david going fishing or
[1:05:42] whatever
[1:05:43] something you don't understand
[1:05:45] that is going on be careful we don't
[1:05:48] need your judgment don't need your you
[1:05:49] know ideas
[1:05:50] it could be part of a larger picture
[1:05:53] and god allows these scenes to play out
[1:05:55] in order to bring the reactions to the
[1:05:57] surface
[1:05:58] be careful
[1:06:00] because god didn't call me or anybody
[1:06:02] else to straighten out all the things
[1:06:04] that i think are out of order
[1:06:06] just leave it alone
[1:06:08] you see it would seem that god's man
[1:06:10] god's prophet of the age god's anointed
[1:06:12] messenger it would seem that he was
[1:06:14] backslidden and he stepped out of the
[1:06:15] will of god
[1:06:17] it would seem that way because we as
[1:06:19] mortals with a little canary brain
[1:06:23] uh very small creatures that we are we
[1:06:25] don't have all the facts we don't know
[1:06:27] what what god's plan is
[1:06:29] we think we're going to build a church
[1:06:30] out here we don't know we're making
[1:06:32] plans
[1:06:33] god might take us all tonight we don't
[1:06:34] know you see
[1:06:36] and so we make these these knee-jerk
[1:06:39] reactions and judgments on partial
[1:06:41] information
[1:06:43] now i'm sure you've been in the mall or
[1:06:45] in the airports and you've seen people
[1:06:46] with a little thing in their ear and
[1:06:48] they're just going along just talking
[1:06:49] away
[1:06:50] who are you talking to you there's
[1:06:51] nobody here
[1:06:53] so we're only hearing half of the
[1:06:54] conversation right
[1:06:56] but if we stick with it we'll get enough
[1:06:58] that we can make up the other half
[1:07:00] and then we judge the case
[1:07:02] that's how we are we're mortals you know
[1:07:04] and so very few people of any given
[1:07:07] generation recognize the value of the
[1:07:10] message of god during their day
[1:07:13] hindsight we can see everything you know
[1:07:15] simeon lived near the temple he lived
[1:07:17] right next door
[1:07:19] he was old
[1:07:20] and he thought he was going to die but
[1:07:22] god said you're not going to die until
[1:07:23] you see the salvation of israel
[1:07:25] and he showed him what kind of sign to
[1:07:27] look for he was ridiculed you know and
[1:07:29] all that but he was spirit-led
[1:07:32] and he was one of the few that
[1:07:33] recognized what god was doing in present
[1:07:35] tense
[1:07:36] so whatever day they had their
[1:07:38] dedication to babies he would go out
[1:07:40] there and he'd look nope nothing today
[1:07:42] and go back to his hammock
[1:07:43] but one day he's out there looking and
[1:07:45] he saw the sign that god showed him to
[1:07:47] look for
[1:07:48] so all this line of mothers you know
[1:07:50] some with their dad and so forth so he
[1:07:52] goes up to mary
[1:07:54] he never saw her before but mary and
[1:07:56] joseph and simeon knew exactly what was
[1:07:59] going on
[1:08:00] and he said can i hold the baby well
[1:08:01] sure
[1:08:02] you know so he holds the baby and he
[1:08:05] prays the lord my eyes have seen what
[1:08:07] you showed me to look for
[1:08:09] now i can die in peace
[1:08:11] so
[1:08:11] he was one of the few that recognized
[1:08:13] fulfillment of scripture in their day
[1:08:17] brother braham says over here uh
[1:08:18] questions and answers on hebrews in 1957
[1:08:21] this city of jeffersonville now we could
[1:08:23] put dallas or whatever city in there but
[1:08:26] this city
[1:08:27] at the day of judgment will answer a
[1:08:28] great price someday for there have been
[1:08:31] hundreds and hundreds of outstanding
[1:08:32] healings done right here that's right
[1:08:34] right here signs and wonders the
[1:08:35] appearing of the angel down at the river
[1:08:37] and the papers blasted and forth and
[1:08:39] still people don't believe why is it now
[1:08:41] someday i'm going to leave here now this
[1:08:43] is 57 didn't title 65.
[1:08:46] someday i'm going to leave here i'm 48
[1:08:48] years old now why didn't the people
[1:08:50] recognize the picture that we have over
[1:08:53] here why didn't they catch that right
[1:08:54] quick why don't they catch these other
[1:08:56] things why don't they catch these
[1:08:57] prophecies you know they can't do it but
[1:09:00] one day i'm going to leave this world
[1:09:02] and when i leave they will recognize it
[1:09:05] some of you young people will realize
[1:09:06] after i'm gone
[1:09:08] this day this scripture is being
[1:09:10] fulfilled
[1:09:12] harvest time 1964 what did the lutherans
[1:09:15] do
[1:09:15] after the death of martin luther
[1:09:18] they met satan and made a denomination
[1:09:21] out of it
[1:09:22] it died never amounted to anything else
[1:09:26] two tapes and i mentioned this before
[1:09:27] some of you probably didn't do it but
[1:09:29] there's two tapes in
[1:09:30] albuquerque new mexico and march of
[1:09:33] in april 64 of 63 i'm sorry
[1:09:36] albuquerque new mexico
[1:09:38] april 63.
[1:09:40] you might not believe but this is being
[1:09:42] taped listen to it a few years today if
[1:09:44] there is such and then you'll know
[1:09:46] whether it's true or not one day when
[1:09:47] the evening lights are breaking and it's
[1:09:49] too late then you'll say that man could
[1:09:51] have been right
[1:09:53] but it's too late then just exactly like
[1:09:55] jesus said when he was here on earth
[1:09:57] quote god sent you all prophets down
[1:09:59] through the age every time the system
[1:10:01] religious system had fallen apart and
[1:10:03] what did you do with each one god sent
[1:10:05] the prophet you all killed them put them
[1:10:07] in the grave exactly and then in about
[1:10:09] another generation you wake up and
[1:10:11] realize well that was a prophet and then
[1:10:14] what do you do oh you garnish the tomb
[1:10:15] try to make it right you know make it
[1:10:16] pretty
[1:10:18] exactly
[1:10:20] and you garnish the tomb
[1:10:23] and you make a tradition of his life
[1:10:28] that's where he
[1:10:29] finishes the quote
[1:10:30] and that's exactly what israel had done
[1:10:32] moses they made a tradition of his life
[1:10:36] see ever since
[1:10:37] way back before paul way back before
[1:10:39] jesus they read a part of their
[1:10:41] prophet's message every saturday like
[1:10:44] yesterday
[1:10:45] the the
[1:10:46] the uh what he called synagogue right
[1:10:48] here in dallas they got together they
[1:10:50] read a portion of their prophet's
[1:10:51] message yeah right out of the old
[1:10:53] testament been doing it ever since
[1:10:55] and so they made a tradition of his life
[1:10:58] that's the way we do with martin luther
[1:11:00] john wesley and other men huh i wonder
[1:11:02] who they could be
[1:11:04] we're always looking back making it for
[1:11:07] a tradition of their life garnishing the
[1:11:09] tomb and their message was for another
[1:11:10] day by the time you wake up that day has
[1:11:12] gone by and we're in another day the
[1:11:14] whole system has worked that way since
[1:11:16] the beginning man-made systems
[1:11:20] now there are negative promises in the
[1:11:22] word
[1:11:23] things that will come to pass it's not
[1:11:24] all blessing okay so my question today
[1:11:28] is brother branham's life going to
[1:11:29] somehow be the exception to this rule
[1:11:32] many people are just now realizing the
[1:11:34] value of this message
[1:11:36] we've had the warning
[1:11:38] so something you don't understand you
[1:11:39] don't have all the facts
[1:11:41] be careful
[1:11:44] we need to just zip it it's like jonah
[1:11:46] did you know
[1:11:47] psalm 46 10. be still i'm god
[1:11:51] so jonah was god's prophet but as human
[1:11:54] he looked for the easy way no pressure
[1:11:56] everybody to agree with him pat him on
[1:11:58] the back many times god will indicate
[1:12:00] his will to us individually based on
[1:12:03] your circumstances based on what he
[1:12:05] wants you to do
[1:12:06] and he'll show us his will and what do
[1:12:08] we do we discuss it with the relatives
[1:12:10] well grandma what do you think
[1:12:13] what do you think it doesn't matter god
[1:12:15] showed you what to do you see
[1:12:18] and um we're looking for a consensus and
[1:12:20] we take a vote
[1:12:22] and we reason we look for the easy way
[1:12:24] like jonah did
[1:12:25] brother brahm says you have to struggle
[1:12:27] to do the will of god sometimes
[1:12:29] it won't always be easy but it does
[1:12:31] produce the best results
[1:12:33] so today we have a lot of book carriers
[1:12:35] of course now we we got it all right
[1:12:37] here
[1:12:39] well i believe the message oh yeah and
[1:12:40] press the button william brown speaks
[1:12:43] everybody can do that you see
[1:12:45] but they're willfully by their own will
[1:12:48] climbing onto boats headed for tarshish
[1:12:50] the wrong way
[1:12:52] you see
[1:12:53] um
[1:12:54] a way that is not ordained in the word
[1:12:57] it looks like it
[1:12:59] see jonah went 180 degrees today we got
[1:13:01] people getting off two degrees well it's
[1:13:03] almost that way well they preach most of
[1:13:06] the message i don't care we've got to
[1:13:07] preach the message you see
[1:13:10] so god told jonah to go northeast he
[1:13:12] went southwest opposite
[1:13:15] these boats today are just a couple of
[1:13:16] degrees off and when it's too late we
[1:13:19] realize they're not going the right
[1:13:20] direction
[1:13:21] we get way down the road and well this
[1:13:23] isn't even the ship of zion you know so
[1:13:26] be careful
[1:13:27] so we can have a leading we can have a
[1:13:30] doctrine we can have a promise right out
[1:13:32] of the word
[1:13:33] you see
[1:13:34] but if it's
[1:13:35] um
[1:13:36] not in proper season flowing in the
[1:13:38] economy of god for the message of the
[1:13:40] hour you'll be fighting the will of god
[1:13:43] if you're just one degree off if you're
[1:13:46] not dead on like this right here if
[1:13:48] you're off this much going wrong
[1:13:49] direction
[1:13:50] it's got to be balanced
[1:13:52] so you can be just a little bit off and
[1:13:55] you know you'll be fleeing from the
[1:13:56] presence of the living god thinking and
[1:13:58] believing you're right
[1:14:00] but you'll be choosing your will and not
[1:14:02] god's written word
[1:14:04] not having rightly divided the word of
[1:14:06] truth and there will be a price to pay
[1:14:09] so we are living in dark laodicea and
[1:14:12] brother branham says oh here in
[1:14:13] revelation chapter 4
[1:14:15] um
[1:14:16] everybody can't be a preacher
[1:14:18] but you have a voice every one of us is
[1:14:20] a living voice you know
[1:14:22] and
[1:14:22] if you are a preacher you're called to
[1:14:24] the pulpit to preach if you're not
[1:14:26] you're still a preacher but live the
[1:14:28] people a sermon
[1:14:30] let your sermon be lived it's the voice
[1:14:33] of god that'll bring reproach to them
[1:14:35] that reject it
[1:14:37] just live your sermon so when your
[1:14:38] ladies go to town and they see the long
[1:14:40] dress and some of you got long hair and
[1:14:43] the people that speak against it well
[1:14:45] they're signing their ticket
[1:14:47] but when they bless you
[1:14:49] they're doing well
[1:14:51] so the preachers call to preach his and
[1:14:52] live it too if you can't live it then
[1:14:54] stop preaching it but you're supposed to
[1:14:56] live your sermons
[1:14:58] and of course i gave you the
[1:15:00] i think uh last time i gave you the
[1:15:02] the quote from francis of assists
[1:15:05] all you catholic people remember francis
[1:15:07] of assists
[1:15:08] and he said preach always
[1:15:10] use words when necessary well brother
[1:15:13] i'm saying the same thing just live your
[1:15:14] message
[1:15:16] he says how we need in jeffersonville
[1:15:18] thousands of lived voices in other words
[1:15:19] real believers that actually live it the
[1:15:22] thunder of god thundering out in
[1:15:23] sweetness holiness purity undefiled
[1:15:26] lives walking around the earth without a
[1:15:28] blemish that's a real believer
[1:15:31] yes sir real christians that's thunder
[1:15:33] against the enemy the devil doesn't care
[1:15:35] how loud you can holler he doesn't care
[1:15:37] how much how high you can jump and so
[1:15:39] forth what hurts the devil
[1:15:41] is to see that sanctified holy life
[1:15:44] consecrated to god say anything to him
[1:15:47] call him anything he's just as sweet as
[1:15:50] it can be it moves right on that throws
[1:15:52] him that's the thunder that shakes the
[1:15:54] devil
[1:15:55] we don't have to get in people's face
[1:15:56] brother branham said they don't care
[1:15:58] what brother graham said they're looking
[1:15:59] for people that live the word
[1:16:03] so if we turn our back on the word okay
[1:16:05] and we've seen it happen
[1:16:07] maybe not openly but just indifference
[1:16:10] maybe it's a little bad attitude like
[1:16:13] the john the baptist's father
[1:16:15] he didn't
[1:16:16] he didn't get up and scream he just
[1:16:18] showed a little bit of doubt see they've
[1:16:20] been praying for a baby for years
[1:16:22] and then the angel appears tells him all
[1:16:24] about it he just kind of shirks a little
[1:16:26] bit okay because of your sorry attitude
[1:16:28] you're not going to speak for nine
[1:16:30] months
[1:16:32] so
[1:16:33] if we turn our back
[1:16:35] not openly but just by indifference
[1:16:37] maybe a little bad attitude we're
[1:16:39] fleeing from the presence of god and
[1:16:41] following an antichrist spirit
[1:16:44] i hate to give you the bad news but
[1:16:45] that's exactly what it is you see
[1:16:47] and um and an antichrist doctrine and
[1:16:51] soon you'll be anointed with arrogance
[1:16:53] selfishness self-righteousness respect
[1:16:55] of persons none of that comes from god
[1:16:58] if we deviate one degree off a true
[1:17:00] center just a quarter inch
[1:17:04] then we got the ball rolling downhill
[1:17:06] you know
[1:17:07] if we degree if we deviate one degree
[1:17:10] we won't hit the target all you hunters
[1:17:11] know that you got to hit right straight
[1:17:13] on where the x is you know
[1:17:14] yeah
[1:17:15] so
[1:17:16] we assume
[1:17:18] you know that we're right we assume he
[1:17:20] is with us and like we spoke about mary
[1:17:23] and joseph you know um they went down to
[1:17:25] the temple every year for the feast and
[1:17:27] so forth now they're on the way home
[1:17:30] it's about 60 miles and they get to the
[1:17:32] end of the first day
[1:17:35] and mary looks around you know they're
[1:17:37] getting ready to set up their camp and
[1:17:38] have supper and she says joseph where's
[1:17:40] the boy
[1:17:42] well i don't know i thought it was your
[1:17:43] time to watch him
[1:17:45] they went off without him
[1:17:47] the promise of god how in the world they
[1:17:48] do that they assumed he was with him
[1:17:52] and so
[1:17:54] they ventured off into make-believe
[1:17:56] leaving behind the promise of god for
[1:17:58] the hour and many are doing the same
[1:18:00] today thinking that god is with him
[1:18:03] now the interesting thing about mary and
[1:18:05] joseph
[1:18:06] if you read the scriptures
[1:18:07] you'll find out that when she got back
[1:18:09] there the next day and they found him
[1:18:10] right where they left him he was you
[1:18:12] know talking to the
[1:18:14] priests and so forth
[1:18:17] she didn't go up there like a like you
[1:18:18] would a nice guy oh honey
[1:18:21] have you had any sleep have you had any
[1:18:22] water have it taken care of you while i
[1:18:24] was gone you know no she took oh jesus
[1:18:27] why did you do this to me you made me
[1:18:29] look bad
[1:18:31] yeah that's what it says
[1:18:33] so
[1:18:34] we got a lot to learn you know
[1:18:36] brother brahm says in 1964 it's possible
[1:18:39] today that good men
[1:18:41] fine men walking with christ reading his
[1:18:43] word and still don't recognize that this
[1:18:46] is the hour that certain things in this
[1:18:48] bible must be fulfilled
[1:18:50] and we've got the same thing going on
[1:18:52] today
[1:18:53] can you open this please
[1:18:56] it's a good thing you're here
[1:19:00] thank you
[1:19:02] we got the same thing going on today
[1:19:04] good man
[1:19:05] reading the bible marching along and not
[1:19:09] realizing that certain things have to be
[1:19:10] fulfilled
[1:19:14] he says it's the hour that we're living
[1:19:16] in the time is at hand that these things
[1:19:17] must be done it's written and thus it
[1:19:19] must be
[1:19:20] fulfilled because god promised it
[1:19:23] our eyes must be open to see the word
[1:19:27] now you can look at the word everybody's
[1:19:28] got a bible they can read it but is it
[1:19:30] revealed do you see what's between the
[1:19:32] lines
[1:19:32] the pharisees had it drawn out it's just
[1:19:34] exactly had big charts you know over
[1:19:36] here's you know garden of eden all this
[1:19:38] stuff had exactly how the messiah must
[1:19:41] come
[1:19:42] they believed they were right
[1:19:44] and here he was born there walks right
[1:19:46] amongst them and they condemned him
[1:19:48] they couldn't see it he said you guys
[1:19:51] need to search the scriptures for in
[1:19:52] them you think you have eternal life
[1:19:55] and they testify of me
[1:19:57] us search the scriptures are you kidding
[1:19:59] we're moses disciples we know exactly
[1:20:01] what brother brown said and when he said
[1:20:02] it and what day and and
[1:20:05] i had a friend once a good preacher he
[1:20:07] said and what has malachi 4 done for you
[1:20:10] what's made some people rich others very
[1:20:12] intelligent but has it changed your life
[1:20:14] has it brought you closer to jesus
[1:20:16] christ do you love the word
[1:20:18] or are you an idolater
[1:20:21] so i searched the scriptures he said if
[1:20:24] you would be moses disciples if you
[1:20:26] really were you would know me because
[1:20:28] moses wrote of me
[1:20:31] if they would have actually known moses
[1:20:33] writing they would have known him they
[1:20:35] thought they knew moses writing
[1:20:38] but they didn't know it they were
[1:20:39] blinded to that fact
[1:20:41] and it's a good thing because otherwise
[1:20:42] you wouldn't have never been here but
[1:20:44] god had all this big plan okay
[1:20:47] so
[1:20:48] um they were blind to that very fact so
[1:20:50] just a few very few words from him like
[1:20:51] that and what they did is spring up this
[1:20:53] man's got a devil he comes to teach us
[1:20:55] what school did he come from but they
[1:20:57] failed to look and see that the very god
[1:20:59] that promised in the word was
[1:21:00] vindicating right there in that person
[1:21:02] of jesus christ he was the light of the
[1:21:04] hour he was the light for the people to
[1:21:07] walk in
[1:21:09] and when god when god's big spotlight
[1:21:11] moves we've got to move with it we can't
[1:21:13] stay back here yeah i was comfortable
[1:21:14] back here we had all kinds of things
[1:21:16] going on but we got to move with the
[1:21:17] light
[1:21:19] only god's word produces light
[1:21:22] so what i'm trying to say tonight is
[1:21:24] look around
[1:21:26] discern your surroundings you see
[1:21:28] be sure that he's with you check up our
[1:21:31] life our doctrine and our experience
[1:21:34] have to match god's word not your
[1:21:36] favorite personality your favorite
[1:21:38] preacher and so forth your imagination
[1:21:40] no it's got to match god's word
[1:21:42] we can't afford to go any farther in the
[1:21:44] glare of another time
[1:21:46] live for today prepare for tomorrow
[1:21:48] because we're on a journey we have a
[1:21:50] goal remember this morning the
[1:21:52] resurrection we're headed there
[1:21:55] so we have
[1:21:57] a spirit amongst malachi 4 people
[1:21:59] because i know a lot of them a lot of
[1:22:00] places
[1:22:01] and um they're just religious tourists
[1:22:04] yeah they're passing through collecting
[1:22:06] you know souvenirs and yeah i was here
[1:22:08] and i went to
[1:22:09] and i went this i went there i mean i
[1:22:11] lived in tucson for a long time and we
[1:22:13] managed the the denrum out there some of
[1:22:15] you've been out there you've seen it
[1:22:16] okay there's brother rem's guns there's
[1:22:18] his animals there's the bear that never
[1:22:20] was a cub and all these things
[1:22:22] and people well they were so excited to
[1:22:24] see these things they were taking rocks
[1:22:26] out of our yard yeah little
[1:22:28] souvenirs
[1:22:30] well
[1:22:32] you can't have that so i went down and i
[1:22:34] bought some rocks nice polished stones
[1:22:35] and i had them in a in a bowl boulder
[1:22:37] you can all have one
[1:22:38] and so now you can take souvenir no
[1:22:41] charge
[1:22:43] so
[1:22:45] but but friends we're at the point where
[1:22:47] people are actually burning candles to
[1:22:50] this picture
[1:22:51] it's happening tonight
[1:22:53] in some of the countries
[1:22:55] some people have the attitude they just
[1:22:56] haven't got brave enough to you know
[1:22:58] burn the candle they got the attitude
[1:23:00] and so
[1:23:01] they don't have any relationship with
[1:23:03] jesus christ the author and finisher of
[1:23:06] eternal life
[1:23:08] we all have a choice
[1:23:10] my will or god's will god's word is his
[1:23:13] will
[1:23:16] okay stand at the door knock 1957 well
[1:23:19] that's the way it is today with people
[1:23:21] who call themselves christians oh i
[1:23:23] belong to church that's good but you see
[1:23:25] the reason there is so much trouble in
[1:23:27] the church
[1:23:28] huh
[1:23:29] you wondered why it says right here the
[1:23:31] reason there's so much trouble in the
[1:23:32] church the reason there's so much
[1:23:33] confusion in the church so much
[1:23:35] discontentment in the church
[1:23:37] it's not because jesus is not there it's
[1:23:40] because that jesus can't gain access to
[1:23:42] the places he wants to go
[1:23:44] we have these little compartments oh no
[1:23:47] don't touch that you can come in jesus
[1:23:49] no that's far enough
[1:23:50] i'll join the church otherwise don't
[1:23:52] tell me how to run my business
[1:23:54] jesus wants to be the supreme ruler of
[1:23:56] your life
[1:23:58] the only way that he can bless you is
[1:24:01] when he becomes your lord
[1:24:03] see
[1:24:04] lord is rulership ownership see
[1:24:07] and have no secrets before him open your
[1:24:10] heart
[1:24:11] another place
[1:24:12] christ outside the door
[1:24:14] and when jesus comes in he wants to be
[1:24:16] welcomed
[1:24:17] but we've got little secret doors
[1:24:20] little bitty doors in our heart we don't
[1:24:22] want jesus in there
[1:24:25] over on the right hand side of the human
[1:24:26] heart after jesus gets in it's a little
[1:24:29] door called pride
[1:24:32] yeah the big p pride
[1:24:35] i'll receive him as savior but don't
[1:24:37] tell me how i have to do things how i
[1:24:39] have to dress what i have to do let my
[1:24:41] hair grow out and stop smoking
[1:24:43] cigarettes and quit going to the pool
[1:24:44] room and all these other things that you
[1:24:46] know happen
[1:24:47] don't worry he won't stay too long
[1:24:51] very dangerous but you do have a choice
[1:24:54] so if he's not lord of
[1:24:56] all you musicians can kind of make your
[1:24:59] way up here because we're getting
[1:25:00] finished getting ready to quit here
[1:25:02] if jesus is not lord of all your life
[1:25:05] today
[1:25:06] and he's calling you and he's he's spoke
[1:25:08] to you today
[1:25:09] all you got is yield to him
[1:25:12] you see
[1:25:13] we can pray for you
[1:25:15] and and this can be the turning point in
[1:25:16] your life okay
[1:25:19] and
[1:25:19] he can change your will he can change
[1:25:21] your desires and put you on the right
[1:25:24] road
[1:25:25] let's stand together
[1:25:28] the word of god says in first
[1:25:29] corinthians 2 but as it is written i
[1:25:32] hath not seen nor ear has heard neither
[1:25:34] has entered in the heart of man the
[1:25:36] things which god has prepared for them
[1:25:37] that love him but god hath revealed to
[1:25:40] us by his spirit he sent a prophet took
[1:25:42] him beyond the curtain of time and he
[1:25:44] told us what it's like
[1:25:47] jesus be
[1:25:49] the lord of all
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:25:56] jesus be
[1:25:58] the lord of all
[1:26:03] jesus be
[1:26:05] the lord of all
[1:26:08] o
[1:26:09] jesus be
[1:26:12] the lord of all
[1:26:15] the
[1:26:16] kingdoms of
[1:26:18] my
[1:26:20] heart oh
[1:26:23] jesus i
[1:26:26] surrender all
[1:26:29] jesus i
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:32] surrender all
[1:26:35] o
[1:26:36] jesus i
[1:26:39] surrender all
[1:26:42] the
[1:26:43] kingdoms of
[1:26:45] my heart
[1:26:46] again
[1:26:48] o cheese
[1:26:50] i
[1:26:52] surrender all
[1:26:56] jesus i
[1:26:58] surrender
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:01] [Applause]
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:14] let's sing it again
[1:27:21] [Music]
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:43] amen
[1:27:45] it's amazing the
[1:27:47] simplicity of god's word
[1:27:51] just to
[1:27:52] really examine yourself and to
[1:27:55] ask yourself he's
[1:27:57] in every corner
[1:27:59] of your life and
[1:28:01] everything that you reflect is
[1:28:03] reflecting him
[1:28:05] i know there's a great
[1:28:07] call in our lives that
[1:28:10] we want to see the lord jesus
[1:28:12] manifested you know and we want to see
[1:28:15] him in power and demonstration
[1:28:18] but he can't show his power and
[1:28:20] demonstration if there isn't a life
[1:28:22] there to witness it
[1:28:25] you know so maybe if we get the first
[1:28:27] end of it
[1:28:29] right first
[1:28:31] you know because the scripture says that
[1:28:33] these signs shall follow them that
[1:28:36] believe
[1:28:38] you know
[1:28:39] they're not the vindication that the
[1:28:40] believer the signs and wonders are is
[1:28:43] the following of the word
[1:28:45] and it's
[1:28:47] you know i like it when the word of god
[1:28:49] makes you think of all the little things
[1:28:51] that you're doing that
[1:28:53] are those little foxes that are just
[1:28:58] you know the things that are let go
[1:29:01] i always marveled at
[1:29:05] the definition of sin that
[1:29:08] brother branham used you know he said
[1:29:10] but said sins unbelief but he said sin
[1:29:14] is when you know to do right
[1:29:17] and don't do it
[1:29:20] that takes all the great big things
[1:29:22] out of the picture right murderer and
[1:29:25] you know and it brings it all the way
[1:29:27] down to just daily
[1:29:30] having that right spirit in your heart
[1:29:32] and it's hard to have that if you don't
[1:29:34] pray
[1:29:35] if you don't go back to those four
[1:29:38] things that brother george recommended
[1:29:41] those are his recommendations
[1:29:43] you know i i don't remember brother bam
[1:29:45] talking about reading the church age
[1:29:47] book but i love the church age book
[1:29:50] you know but that's an elder giving you
[1:29:52] some advice on it'd be good for you if
[1:29:55] you read the church age book but what
[1:29:57] read your bible right
[1:29:59] listen to the tapes
[1:30:01] read the church age book pray
[1:30:04] you know so there's so much we can do to
[1:30:07] sweeten our spirits
[1:30:10] and
[1:30:10] and uh take control of the things that
[1:30:13] if we just start taking control of the
[1:30:16] little things
[1:30:17] then i think the big picture would come
[1:30:19] to better for us amen you do that this
[1:30:23] week when you go out and testify and
[1:30:27] testify with your life
[1:30:28] testify with your heart
[1:30:31] be careful what comes off of your tongue
[1:30:35] and i appreciate it what brother george
[1:30:37] brought
[1:30:38] so much it stood out to me was about
[1:30:41] present tense
[1:30:44] you know being aware of the presence of
[1:30:46] the lord in the tents that you're in
[1:30:50] in other words that's right now
[1:30:53] when you're sitting at your desk right
[1:30:55] now
[1:30:56] when you're doing your job right now
[1:30:59] what's going on with me
[1:31:01] right now where's the spirit of the lord
[1:31:04] right now
[1:31:06] and the more accustomed can become to
[1:31:09] the presence of the lord
[1:31:12] the greater that we will see him others
[1:31:16] will see him
[1:31:18] get a point
[1:31:19] something someone to
[1:31:21] see yourself
[1:31:22] very good
[1:31:24] you know what i mean
[1:31:25] so we got to see him here
[1:31:28] and then we know that he's dining out
[1:31:30] for others to see
[1:31:32] so i think these are great words of of
[1:31:35] admonition today the simplicity of the
[1:31:37] gospel
[1:31:39] you know if if we do these things the
[1:31:42] greater things
[1:31:43] will come so we really appreciate the
[1:31:45] word brother george
[1:31:47] i i think it was well spoken and
[1:31:50] and uh
[1:31:51] you know i always liked brother george
[1:31:53] because he comes in such a different
[1:31:55] style
[1:31:57] than everybody else you know
[1:32:00] i always wondered what it'd be if he ran
[1:32:02] from this end of the pulpit and then ran
[1:32:04] around the church and
[1:32:05] huffed and puffed
[1:32:07] he wouldn't have said anything different
[1:32:10] than he said because it's not how you
[1:32:13] say it that's important
[1:32:15] it's what you say
[1:32:20] amen it's what you say
[1:32:22] so you don't read your bible do you just
[1:32:25] running up and down the stairs and
[1:32:28] no you get quiet and you just
[1:32:31] read the word
[1:32:32] and you let it
[1:32:34] settle in your heart
[1:32:36] and that's what's good so that's the
[1:32:38] things we want to do so let's let's this
[1:32:41] week you know i i thought this morning
[1:32:44] you know
[1:32:45] maybe this week as we go
[1:32:47] maybe as a church we'll just start in
[1:32:50] the new testament
[1:32:51] and every day somebody read i know you
[1:32:54] have your own bible readings but just
[1:32:56] read one chapter out of the new
[1:32:58] testament
[1:33:00] every day and if you know everybody in
[1:33:02] the church is doing that
[1:33:04] i don't know how long it will take us to
[1:33:05] get through the bible should be able to
[1:33:07] do it in about a year
[1:33:10] but the word of god will be rich in our
[1:33:11] hearts
[1:33:13] amen so if you love the lord today
[1:33:16] amen lord richly bless you
[1:33:18] but joseph gordon would you come dismiss
[1:33:20] us in prayer please my brother
[1:33:30] now brother joseph knows how important
[1:33:32] the word of god is because he programs
[1:33:36] artificial intelligence
[1:33:42] trying to teach machines to think
[1:33:45] i don't want to be a thinking machine do
[1:33:47] you
[1:33:48] i want to be a real christian
[1:33:50] with spirit life and i thought people
[1:33:53] that don't have the spirit are just
[1:33:55] artificial intelligence
[1:33:58] no real genuine christianity
[1:34:02] just artificial
[1:34:05] intelligence
[1:34:06] it's not a bad thing you do that joseph
[1:34:08] it's a good thing because you have a
[1:34:11] connection with the real god bless you
[1:34:13] we love you brother
