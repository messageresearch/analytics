you're worthy God you're a worthy father you're a worthy savior Lord and we just want to tell you thank you Lord We Want To Praise You Lord Lord to see your Mighty hands Lord in all of these Lord lives that Lord you broke chains and you overtook circumstance Lord and here we are tonight Lord we're needy and thirsty for another drink Lord we pray as we commit this little time of Fellowship Lord you take this little vessel this Mortal being Lord I'm nothing but father in your hands Lord you can Lord you you took uh low a few things of of bread and you fed 5,000 Lord and so I'm I'm believing

strength and the life that you intend father as we commit the needs of the people father we thank you for the testimonies we've heard Lord uh Lord it's it's so wonderful to Lord even if it seems a small or insignificant when you do it it's great father and we're here to say thank you for your greatness Lord and just pray you'd continue to bring a complete Restoration in our lives Lord for our pastor and Lord we just Commit This time of Fellowship to you in your faithful hands in Jesus Christ amen amen if you want to turn with me in your Bible we're going to go to the Book of Joel we'll read there in chapter one and I was looking around at the flowers today and the trees outside and my everything just seems to be coming into bloom the grass is looking greener and it's really uh so wonderful and so we're certainly grateful that we can see the natural but my if we could ever see what God's doing that's that's what our heart's craving that's right in Joel chapter 1 it says the word of the Lord came to Joel the son of pathal hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and let the children another generation that which the Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust ha left had the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten and then another verse over there in chapter 12 of the same book I'm I'm sorry chapter 2 in 25 it says and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten that's right the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people never shall be ashamed amen one more uh scripture reading in Genesis chapter 20 speaking about Abraham we see you know the natural types the spiritual and we see this relationship that Abraham and Sarah had there in chapter 20 we'll read verses 6 and 7 it says this in Genesis 20 and6 says and God said unto him in a dream yay I know that thou did this in the Integrity of your heart in thine heart for I also o withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffer I Thee not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all of that are thine amen we trust the Lord will add a little blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seat you know it just um it's one of those things that I was Lord had placed two thoughts on my heart and I just didn't know exactly what one was for this service so I kind of wrestled back and forth and seemed like yesterday it seemed like the Lord really opened the door to this inspiration about a title I want to speak to you tonight I will restore and I was listening to a message couple weeks ago and you know it just really stuck out to me and so in light of you know having a new sanctuary and you know we when we dedicated the the house of the Lord uh we were listening to God in Simplicity you know one of the things that stuck out to me in that admonition is you know sometimes in the buildings of a new church you know sometimes we get a little start you know and we just know that that's just part of it right and so sometimes in life you just go through stuff right and that's to have an experience but what does God want to do while we're having the experience well God wants to declare his promises in our lives he wants us to partake in his different attributes and so sometimes we go through things and we look at it from the wrong lens but God is here to give us his vision on the matter and so I'm certainly grateful for that and as I was pondering the the other message just seemed to just be so uh great for That season but I trust that maybe it'll just be a message for another time and so you know I just wanted to read out of a um message called God restoring the it's the restoration of the brid tree and this is mostly where I'll be pulling out of tonight so uh um I don't really have any other sermons that I'll pull out of that I don't believe but you know restoration is a is a very important thing and you know as as um you know one of the things that I do for a living is I do restoration work and so whenever there's a disaster or some kind of event that transpires or befalls a person you need sometimes if you have if you have a business or a home and there's fire wind hail or there's um you know tornadoes or or uh flooding you need to have a professional you need to have an expert you need somebody that could come and do the restoration for you somebody who knows what they're doing somebody who has experience and you're in a condition where you don't know all the ins and outs but there's somebody that if you could put confidence in them they can restore your property to previous condition before the storm happened before the fire happened before the water damage happened and you know if if that Restoration company can now realize owner of the insurance company it works according to the law the policy so if we could ever get on the same page if if the me being the contractor and them being the home owner if we can always just identify what is wrong with your home and say okay now do you have coverage is it in the policy is it written inside of the policy are you a benefactor of this loss do you see that yes there is evidence of a disaster I see mold I See Fire I see I see the evidence of something that was there but now when I go look in the policy does it have coverage you know a policy might have coverage but is your name on the top of the letter that says you're the holder of that policy you know so when we think about restoration we look at from two sides from the natural there's a restoration of things where um you know it it' be like a a disaster that came but you know as as I go through this message I don't want to take too much time going down these lines but because there's just so much I'd like to be able to express and I would encourage you to listen to this message the restoration of the brid tree you know it it if you try to listen it from top to bottom you're probably going to need at least four hours but you know this is a wonderful message and to think that God said that I will restore and it was something that God knew that this bride tree this tree of life that had been it been chipped down and been cut down to a stump but God said through Joel he said I will restore right and and we realiz realiz that God is a god of restoration you know so as we go through we realize there was you know if if we become born again now we're entitled to everything that was lost in the garden by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are entitled to every single promise in the book I just love that you know brother brandham says this in in paragraph 82 says to restore means to return to the former owner to bring back to a former estate of condition and we we can enforce a claim to restore oh my just think about it you're a policy holder when you have the Life of Christ in you you become a policy holder if the devil has come and take the privilege of being a son or daughter of God you have the right to say Satan give it back God has placed such a love in my heart to see what he did at Calvary he shed his blood and that blood is a worthy atonement to bridge the gap between God I mean when I look back in the The Genesis and see the account I see that God said I will put enity there would be one come that would atone for my sin for the sin of humanity right praise God that's right oh what a fellowship what a restoration to come into fellowship and communion with God like he's always desired we never knew what that was like but God said I will restore all that the Palmer worm ate the canker worm at the Locust and the caterpillar oh my you think about this great bug and brother Bram taught it's the same selfs same bug just in different stages my think he's just eating at the tree you know we just my just to think about restoration coming back to that position as a Son of God you know when we were born into this world we were born as sons and daughters but we needed restoration we were in a fallen condition oh you know what that's my toy Mommy and it's Johnny's toy you know we had this nature it was a lying nature it was a stealing nature but oh God he cared so much that he said I will restore oh my goodness what a fellowship what a God my to restore means to bring back restore a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs therefore some way it went away from the rightful owner and can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring it back to it who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural condition in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there is a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore okay praise the Lord now we have these rights to restore and now it'd be like if somebody got something stolen brother Bram tells the testimony of the brother where they got the car stolen right and so he he saw Vision so that's different for us because unless you see Visions you know but we have the word of promis that if there's two any two that come together and agree on one thing and it's the will of the lord we know that we have it we can call the great enforcer we can make our claim we can get down in prayer and agree together and the Holy Spirit which is the enforcer can come and restore our claim but we this is our inheritance it's your inheritance to make their claim if there's sickness you can call upon God for healing by his stripes I'm Healed if you have children that are Wayward it's for your house you have the right by a child of God being restored all of Heaven's willing to back you up if you will just re ask for restoration bring it back bring it back 88 says enforce then we are the the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claim that God gave us for God has a law and his law is his word is his law and God in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have the right to force these claims upon Satan give it back amen 89 says but the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which is unrightfully and deceitfully taken from God Souls of man he took from God Souls of women Souls of children sickness of the body oh my we just want to encourage your heart with a little bit of what God wanted to restore in your life gets me excited oh there's going to be some praise some hearts of the Believers right around the corner you're going to say you know what I see my moment I see my opportunity it's coming my thank the Lord I'm sorry I'm getting so excited right now I'm going try to calm down he says this we're going to jump over there to 93 it says now so then we have the scripture here that Jesus said wheresoever two or more gather in my name and if they agree they'll be I'll be in their midst and if they will agree touching in one certain thing and ask it but don't doubt it they shall have what they ask and it'll be given to them now there's the law now the one that's here to enforce the law is the holy spirit how about the people who don't believe the Holy Spirit would reject him see you're rejecting your own peace and mercy my my but that's not this house of God Amen in paragraph 101 he says now the only way he can work is when you let him work you imagine if I'm over there and this has happened I've I've come and I'm helping a policy holder homeowner or something and all of a sudden they're making all this emotional bid because they have this great loss but if they don't have coverage it's like arguing at a wall it's like you're not going to get anywhere and so it's like this if if we if we want to have God have fruit in our lives and work the works of God we only way he can work is when we let him work we can't be fighting against God we can't be arguing point of our opinion and what we think about the matter but God has a law and that's his word so if we just take his word in our heart God will bring it to pass he said see you're you've got to believe it every promise in the word of God is yours but it's upon Condition You Must Believe it sir you must take it in your heart as your profession and your possession this is mine Satan Take Your Filthy Hands off of my this is my promise this is my God he's brought me into fellowship with him now he's talking about the fish and the fish has a certain law but see if he just goes and tries to hold his breath he would be working counter there's the law is already in him see he says now in 103 he says and that's the law of Christ the law that law is in men you can bury them in the deepest grave in the deepest sea and the lowest hell there's a law of the spirit that'll rise him up again oh my I just think about the restoration oh my God has things that we're going through right now we can't do it but he's saying I will I will restore you have relationships that are broken God's saying I will restore don't look at your circumstance don't look at the situations believe my word I will restore that's my word to you than Lord receive it tonight it's the law of the spirit of God in men and women and children Hallelujah I am not going to go as far as I thought I was now in 105 it says this he says now I'm beginning to feel religious now we have a law the law of the life in US we don't only thing you have to do you are made and born a place here in the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you don't have to knock down to the devil we've got a law that law is the holy spirit is of the Holy Spirit the only thing you need to know is H have to do is to know how to let go and let God to to keep fighting at it see you'll never work it'll never work you have to know how to let go and let God God this is your word you're able to keep your word I'm going to let go I'm not going to try to force an outcome you are going to perform your word however you want I just believe it and I'm going to praise you now for it oh God thank you see says um you know the birds say and this 107 he says I'll see how fast I can run down there and maybe take off no you won't do it you'll fall down see he's got to learn how to control how that the law can control him my you know it's part of our nature we want to have control but you need to learn to let God let go and let God hallu let go of the control Oh you mean I have to put faith in God Amen that's where God's bringing us to he's restoring us to faith in God we're not to depend upon ourselves for anything you know it's the mercies of God that he's bringing these realities to us thank God amen see he says now then he takes you to your healing he takes you to the baptism of the Holy Spirit and anything that he promised isn't that wonderful any claim that he give you is yours by letting go and letting God hallelujah hallelujah now 10 112 he says what is it there's been a sentence a claim Easter claim or the flower claims it has a right to rise again and see God's law of nature pulls the Earth around to make the law of God in nature to bring forth an Easter a resurrection it's beautifully the return of the sun to restore what the winter killed while it was from the earth he sends the Earth back around the Sun and we're told that way back there the earth the earth went away from the sun went back there and that's the way the sinner does he goes away from the S so n and when this Su n but when the when it strikes when this Earth begins to come back when it's out there death strikes it it's winter it kills everything living thing that it can kill out there there now when the earth gets back around the seeds laying in the ground they're frozen the pulp run out of them and everything is gone but there's a little life preserved and as soon as the sun brings back into the position the Earth again then there's an Easter a resurrection up comes the flowers up comes everything all that the winter killed the sun restored all that the Winter's death killed the sun brings the life and restores the son of life restores oh I think that's wonderful you see the natural the sun because the Earth is on is going away and then there there's there's a winter and everything's dying off you can see now the sun is returning there's an Easter hallelujah and if if it's happening in in in our natural Realms around us we're in the season of restoration start throwing Waters everywhere sorry now in 15 it says and so it is with the people so it is now with the people all that the winners coldness of cold former religion killed out there and the nearing of the Son of God in the last days comes into his church and restores it back to life again I will restore Hallelujah sayeth the Lord see God restores the flowers the leaves his nature his seeds of the earth and therefore we know then that God will restore also his habitation he will restore his Eve that's right he will restore everything that death killed that's right now the only way it can ever remain dead is to let it lay in the wrong place on my my my but if it falls in the right place hallelujah it's got to come back to life again so God let us fall in the right channel that's right for a restoration hallelujah oh my don't let me get caught up in my own thinking and unbelief but let me fall in the channel of faith in your word because I know that your word will bring life amen the resurrection in life my all the winter kills the sun restores returning of the Sun what does it do it forces it it forces death when the sun the spring Sun comes back in line with the Earth it actually forces death to give up the dead to a resurrection for what a resurrection a restoration to restore again what does it the sun coming that's God's law God set the Earth in law gravitational law everything in nature Works according to God's law the flower serves its term and the seed serves its term it dies in into the Earth it's dead into the Earth and then there is a restoration oh how beautiful God laid it so plain in nature his laws and everything to serve his purpose my 118 he says now it's laying there dead and there's not a thing we could take one of them here lights like this and turn it on and it'll never never do any good there's no way for us to do it but God has a law and that when the sun comes unto the seed it forces the life out of the seed death can't hold it anymore now God has set his law now God set all of his laws to serve him both natural and spiritual working according to his word regardless of the conditions oh my goodness oh my goodness well we make a lot of excuses for conditions don't we but oh my God saying you know what don't look at your condition Hallelujah despite the condition despite anything God's word he said I'll restore says now yes God set all of the laws in motion think of it let this soak cuz we're coming to a healing service in a few minutes God set all of his laws in motion and it must work according to his own word are you getting it see his word his law has to work according to his word he commanded the sun he commanded the moon he commanded the Earth he commanded nature and they all fall right in line and all the laws work in harmony with God's spoken word and the law of life that is within us will bring us to a resurrection Hallelujah there it is the law of life is in you oh my and that's now it's impossible for it not and that's the reason the law of life that was in Christ when the word was spoken he says I will not leave my soul and my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in Hell there wasn't enough time there's wasn't enough Devils there wasn't enough anything to keep Christ in the grave till his body got to R because the law would bring the word to pass the law of God brought by the Holy Spirit brings any promise to pass regardless of the condition job said though the skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh I shall see God oh my regardless of how little you are I qualify regardless how low you are I qualify regardless how you are or how Unholy you are how sick you are how Afflicted you are the law of God's spirit by his word makes it obey him forces the issue give it back right oh amen and if we could ever just think that for a moment regardless forces regardless of the condition no matter what the condition is the law of God forces the condition to cope with his word it's got to oh I love that I love that praise God you know it's just amazing see sometimes it says this in 129 says sometimes people get so guilty minded he says that they won't want to face judgment you get that you you know some people like they start running and doing their different things they just they just can't accept I I don't want to and so you know it's like the kid that's whistling in the graveyard but he knows judgment's coming yeah you know and here we are saying Lord oh my and many people it ain't too hard to die anything anybody loose there can lose their mind and something again and do something rational some of them have their bodies burned and take them to the Sea and throw them into the ashes of the four corners and things The Winds of the sea that don't stop judgment see you come right on just the same yes sir see no matter regardless of the condition you're going to meet God somewhere we're going to meet God somewhere you've got to come to him you've got to meet him see because why he has spoke a word and put a law in his word and the law is his own law he his own law his own life behind it that's the reason why he swore by himself there's none greater see he had to take an oath because no Covenant should be confirmed without an oath and the only way that he could before he did take it by himself and himself become the oath oh brother when God became man and was the oath he made himself an oath and by his own death burial and Resurrection he proved his law was right Hallelujah Glory oh my you destroy this building and I'll raise it up again in three days I personal pronoun I will raise it up again in 3 days I'll bring it up try to destroy it see what happens for he knew the law of God glory you know the prophet of God said that Jesus only had one scripture that he can base the Resurrection on but he said right here he said for he knew the law of God and he got in Channel with the word of God oh Hallelujah Lord help me then the law of God has got to work by the work we're coming down in a great little thing in a minute where the law of God's word the law of God is with his word my I'm GNA have to skip some I'm trying to get somewhere Lord help me feeling okay God wants to restore many things all things Hallelujah he says this in 148 he says God is speak speaking of his fruit tree now God he wanted to have a fruit tree and he planted it the day of Pentecost and there it's been chopped down to a stump and We Know by prophecy that Joel said I will restore all that this bug had ate down he says God is speaking of that fruit tree that he had planted God planted that fruit his a fruit tree he planted it at the day of Pentecost and he brought that tree there for a purpose he wanted now this is the desire he wanted to bear his fruit the God's word he wanted a church that would keep his word all down through the age Eve failed to keep it the Jews failed to keep it the law had failed all of the all had failed so God planted him a tree a tree now if we'll skrip to verse 150 I'm sorry for doing this but I I just encourage you to take the time and listen to this because I am no substitute for the source but now when the tree of of uh uh now when this tree that God planted it was to Bear nine different kinds of fruit nine different kinds which means nine spiritual gifts nine fruit of the spirit to go with the nine spiritual gifts this was God's tree he planted it on Earth at the day of Pentecost praise God praise God we just start thinking of just brother brandom just runs right into Psalms 1 like a tree that's planted and he says that like a tree that's planted in by the rivers of water it's it's going to bring forth fruit in its season amen he says this and now this is in 164 he says but a man that's planted not stuck out but planted by the rivers of water he shall bring forth his fruit watch he and his his fruit in his season are you reading it Psalms 1 he says blessed is the man that sth not in the seat of the scorn for standeth in the way of Sinners he shall be like a tree that is planted by the rivers of water he shall bring forth his fruit in his season and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper see notice the ungodly not so he won't stand with him in the Judgment my my see now he shall bring forth his fruit in his season watch each his the personal pronoun there it's his fruit God's fruit in the season that the prophet is bringing it it'll be the prophet season God's fruit In God's Time by The Prophet season oh God thank you now he shall bring forth his fruit in his season there isn't to his there bring forth his God's fruit in his season that the messenger is ordained to come he'll bring forth those now remember that the Messenger will bring the fruit of God will bring it in God's season in the season of the bringer see he will bring forth the fruit in his season and he C and it cannot wither he's got predestinated fruit there it can't it can't destroy it because it's predestinated Amen oh I love that praise the Lord we're going to have to keep progressing here see it says now in 169 all trees by the woman died we all die by The Woman by birth we all die but through woman come death but this Birth come by but this Birth come by women all right then it has to die because of sin but the birth the new birth that comes by Christ cannot die that's the one tree and the other see this tree though it is persecuted made fun of and everything the very beginning of the Garden of Eden it cannot die it's predestinated it's been clubbed it's been beaten oh my everything done to it and what happened it cannot die his he will not die he can't because he's holding in him the predestinated word of God it has to come forth for his fruit is in his season predestinated SE season Joel saw one of them at the bottom and he said I will restore sayeth the Lord for the predestinated of God let in the roots of the tree I've cut down some trees before and they went down to a stump I'm like job's completed but oh my next year there's all of these saplings coming up I'm like man got humbled you know you're like yeah but oh my think about it God had a predestinated attributes in the roots oh my my my my in 17 he says and then at Pentecost where the church for the bride tree he set it in order at Pentecost the tree was predestinated to bring forth fruit in its season now going fine and the fruits were going just fine it bloomed out at the day of Pentecost let's see what happened at Pentecost see Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also they healed the sick and that day that started there was 50 days after Easter and they came and a Russian Mighty Wind from Heaven oh my think about it and they spoke with tongues they went out preached the gospel and the spokesman came out came out and he preached the gospel now this says this in um 187 notice now what had taken place on this God planted a tree to bring forth nine spiritual gifts gifts of his Spirit The Same Spirit was in Christ down come down upon the church had eternal life now the spirit the gifts of the Spirit was in the church and it was growing bearing forth fruit everywhere they thought not of theirselves they didn't organize nothing they just went ahead and was brothers and I'm glad that little thing was on there brother Brandon's pointing out to some something he says no Creed but Christ no law but love and no book but the Bible he says I believe that that's what I believe Amen in 192 it says this and there is the kind of sign that he said would follow the believer where is it today he gave the world an example of what would the believer sign he said it would be far better that you would a millstone hang at your neck and Dr round at the depths of the sea then to bring an offense to one of these and the angels always behold the face my father's face which is in heaven the Angels now notice there they were and they and that tree was planted it was doing great work and we know that and we know that went about everywhere why on the day of Pentecost 3,000 Souls were added baptized and went into the church and how Great Fellowship they had and everybody wasn't nobody needing anything everybody was kind and good-hearted and one another and they were all big one big family isn't that wonderful to think that that's what we're restored to you might look at it and say well I'm I'm recognizing that we need restoration but I'm here to tell you God promised restoration says and there came by a little ugly a little old ugly looking greedy teeth Beetle that lives in four different stages and Joe saw it four stages of an insect Destroyer came forth to destroy that beautiful tree of God think of it now I'm going to read off some of Joel and he said Joel in the first chapter he says now there was four different beetles there but there's actually ju it's just one one beetle in four stages now watch this little Beetle come by for great be for this great beautiful tree of God and we we call it a tree which was the church so this tree is the restoration of the Bride tree now the first was a Palmer worm and that's a little thing just a little bitty insect of a worm are you catching this there was a Palmer worm he was just a little worm and he went and attacked this tree and he brought destruction and Devastation in the form and in the season of a Palmer work he says he come along to destroy the fruit of the tree that was the first thing now let's go back in history and see this first thing was a dignified group that God amongst the common people and they said well this is good you know called the heal the sick and do these things that's wonderful so you know we ought to do we ought to get out there and get a bigger class of people and understand the better class the mayor the judges and carry and and the dignitaries of the city and as long as you carry on that way you'll never come around you'll never come around they'll never come around around you and you know that was the way it was at at Pentecost at the Pentecost but we don't have to be inviting the mayor and different things but the these kind of attitudes I like how brother Paul was saying we want to discern the time in our attitudes like the all this stuff that's going on in Israel all I mean we're looking at you know uh they're just you know you look around and there's there's not hope for this system of the world our only hope is in the promises of God he said I will restore now we're going to jump over to uh 203 it says this little Palmer worm came around and took up off all the fruits and I have two pages of fruit but just let's let's read some of them first thing he took off was brotherly love that's right the one thing that he that kills a church right there is on brotherly love yes sir then the next fruit that he took off remember love is the first fruit of the tree love joy peace longsuffering gentleness or goodness meekness Faith patience that's right in the Holy Ghost these are nine spiritual gifts with the nine fruits of the tree and so forth all right now the first he's got to eat on he got to eaten on the tree the fruit of the of the tree now let's picture this big tree God's tree bearing nine spiritual gifts they were Healing The Sick they were speaking in tongues they were casting out Devils they were doing great work Works preaching the unadulterated word of God no denomination to tie them down they were free doing a great work so in comes this little devil sitting up with two horns setting out in front like a grasshopper you know the little old gritty teeth this first little palm worm came out and ate off brotherly love he said you know so and so did so and so over at so and so church I wouldn't believe that bunch of people see there he is that's the first thing now the next thing he wanted to eat on was the fruit of faith faith in the word now look how do you know that it is the word it's been translated so many times you know that Devil's still eating he says he's this and that and the other oh my now the other fruit he ate off Joy of Salvation the fruit of Joy my you people make too much noise oh my oh you can you can preach brother brandom and that woman one time no it wasn't it was a man I believe he belonged to another church and he said to me he says my I can hear all those people crying you know I just think about it you know that's that's still attitudes that are are still living it's the Palmer worm he's still at work he's still chewing at the fruit of Brotherly Love he's still trying to eat the fruit of faith in God's word give you a reason your symptoms the doctor's diagnosis you you come from a family you're just not that smart you can't get that degree whatever it is he's still eating at it but faith in God's word oh my that's what we want to see God bringing restoration the joy of my salvation you know sometimes we can lose the joy of our Salvation that's because the Palmer worm is still at work my I better I might have to and then the next fruit is in uh 214 now the next fruit of the tree is peace Peace of Mind knowing that I'm saved now they tell you well if you site recite a certain Creed you're saved if you join the church you're saved if one of these things you're saved if you go there if you join our church you're saved if you say a hell Mary if you put your name on the book you have oh that just takes all the joy away my think about it these stage these stages of this bug the Palmer worm was eating at the fruit now what's the next stage of this development of this palmerworm was the Locust and the Locust began to eat the leaves off the tree and as he was eating the leaves off of the tree all of a sudden we let the prophet tell us now this little Locust what the Palmer worm left now this is in I believe one or 222 he says and I'm jumping in the middle then look at it the Locust came to eat eat with the Palmer worm left see the to destroy the leaves what is the leaves for divine Fellowship my to think about it the devil's trying to come and destroy our divine Fellowship well I'm recognizing the devil in every one of his tricks that's right now he's Presbyterian we won't have anything to do with him he's Nazarene he's Pentecostal and this and that and the other we won't have nothing to do with him because he don't belong to our group oh my look at these little Spirits Devils we have a meeting here in The Healing The Sick oh the church don't believe in that there he is that's that old Locust do he cut off the fellowship off that's right he took the fellowship what is fellowship what does the leaves do makes it cool when the birds flying under the leaves to cool off my we're going to jump down to 227 but you know we're supposed to what we're supposed to do the Bible says the predestinated the predestinated sons of God set in Heavenly places what is that what is the predes inated setting in Heavenly places what is that to do it's coolness Comfort a feeling at home don't you love it don't you love God's word you can be yourself you're part of the family of God not because I say so but because God said so amen where anybody can wear a tuxedo suit a man oh my I can't I can't read all that sorry okay sure can where anybody wearing a tuxedo suit and the next man on the way the other of this oh look she never got a permanent in her hair don't she look horrible she don't even have an Easter frown a gown on now whatever it was you know Easter frown that's about right sat back there going and brother brandom illustrates something but he says don't even have Easter Easter gown well look at him that old same suit he wore last year well what do you know about that you don't even feel right there I said to a little lady the other day a poor little woman she belonged to a great dignified Church she said she was dying with cancer went down to pray for her brother Roy Roberson there and one of the trustees went down there and the poor little woman was sitting there dying with cancer and she said I said do you are you a Christian she said sir I don't know what to say said I went to a certain church and said she started crying I said what's the matter she said I just couldn't dress right said they looked down and me there you are you're uncomfortable see but the Bible said that we would assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places oh my what all alike why I'll tell you what Heavenly place I'll tell you what to do I'll make it'll make a pair of overhauls in a tuxedo suit put her arms around one another and call each other brother oh my that's what leaves do my can you recognize the Locust at work eating at the leaves my he still had work but God said he would ReStore in one and 234 he says but the third stage of him was this cankerworm H so now he's got a bad name to start with canker cankerworm what does a cankerworm do he goes into the bark that's his lifeline there my yes sir he goes into the bark and destroys the covering the covering what is religion covering what does the word religion mean a covering so the little cankerworm after he got amongst the congregation got all dignified and they took all the fellowship away with them and in the form of a locust and now he comes around and takes the very religion and makes dogmas out of it set up some Orthodox word forms himself a religion and gets a bunch of men together and puts a Creed down there and takes the very religion and strips off the tree of God the very bark that bears the sap that comes into it takes it away cankerworm do you see that insect that's exactly right that canker worm that was Rome in the early church he amen my think about the fruit being eaten off the leaves now the bark what is the Bark I mean we're students of the message but I think it's good to just stir Your Hearts Up by remembrance you know we want to see how God because he's the same yesterday today and forever and so if God did this at Pentecost and he said I will restore the condition of Heart of his believing children we want to know how the enemy works because that's all part of our overcoming that's all part of putting this thing subject to this m in 238 says that's the way we're Christians not by joining into a group that's an organization we're born Christians being regenerated by the Holy Ghost notice now when this little cankerworm began to bore itself into the bark what did it do it began to take its religion its covering the doctrine away from it now religion is Doctrine and a covering that covers anything that's the reason our religion is by Blood the blood the life is in the blood that covers the word the life is in it's in the blood the blood is the religion and the life in the blood is what brings the results why you see it amen it's not covered by fig leaves my my we're going to go to 246 God sent the Holy Ghost the life of God to be in you not in a statue you're the guy that God wants to live in not a statue but in you God's people holy statutes there's ain't no holy statute you're the holy statute the Bible said so a body thou H has prepared me now this little fellow started destroying destroying what the cankerworm got into the bark and watch he began to destroy the bark what did he do he made the church spiritual he made a natural church for a spiritual church yes sir he took away all of the true and just gave a false now remember the fruit of the Palmer worm the fruit Palmer worm the leaf the Locust the bark the covering the religion the doctrine the doctrine to cankerworm God and there where did the first Doctrine come from out of the Bible you historians you know where it come from from Rome exactly where it started there's where they started accepting dogmas my God determined that his Bible would be written I'm jumping around a little bit here now but the water baptism there was the commission that was what the doctrine was at the beginning he said men and Brethren what must we do to be saved he said repent every one of you and be baptized that was the original tree that was the one that brought that was their doctrine that was by the word of God and it was Upon This Rock my we're going to try to run here 264 he says so you see the cankerworm got to eating eating away the baptism of water in the name of Jesus the next thing the cankerworm did is take away the baptism of the Holy Ghost my if you ain't got your Doctrine right how you going to cope up with the word of God if you got some Creed write your name on a book take a Eucharist and believe all this nonsense it'll never bring the results but if we take the unadulterated word and we do what it says if you haven't been baptized and you're on the fence God wants to restore to you what he promised it's going to shed light on that word as long as you do that that's what the Holy Ghost will do 267 he says but what did it do that's what the cankerworm did it took away the spirit and gave him a piece of bread my gave him a handshake gave him a piece of bread now instead of the word the cankerworm gave him a Creed do you see it see he gave a natural for Spiritual can you see it now look we're on the Catholic line here but did you know that right down there the Protestant 2 where do they have the Holy Ghost demonstrations in Protestant churches today where do they have the Pentecostal reactions among the Protestants they don't have it you have it in Lutheran no you don't if you do I want to go to it I want the Presbyterians where where is it at they've adopted something natural I'm fixing to leave you and you know that see don't never let this get out of your heart I believe brother Brandon's trying to lay a key here that this is what the devil wants to do is give you a natural just go to church pay your time just just have your routine with God that's just natural but God God says don't brother br's admonish is don't just take the natural the natural's death Shake ourselves don't take the natural that's death the natural man is death anything it does it's death it's subject here for death it's the spirit that maketh alive see the spirit gives us life it's Quicken it amen they took the water baptism and put it in Father Son and Holy Ghost my now I'm really gonna have to try to run now this is in 282 now watch here's a good one I'll get this one and then I'll stop and look now the Bible tells us when we've done wrong we should Purge our souls by the Holy Ghost get down and let the Holy Spirit reveal to us you're doing wrong and stay there before him and die out and Purge our souls now they're turning it around and giving you Purgatory after you're dead and then the priest makes a lot of money and prays you out of purgatory why nonsense why the natural for a spiritual 13 or 311 now here he comes the caterpillar the fourth stage of him the caterpillar all he he's a sucker he sucks the life the spirit the life that's what he does gets right down holds the pulp and gets to sucking the caterpillar there he is who we going to call him denomination that's the guy's name he's a destroyer sucks the life every time that God sends a move among the people every time they deny domate right there they die I want somebody who knows history to condemn that that can condemn that show me one time that an organization ever organized that didn't die my 3:13 what kind of life was it Holy Spirit what did it do it couldn't hold the holy spirit in there they still had dog the Holy Spirit wouldn't stand for it so it takes the holy the life out of the tree and gives him dogma and makes denominations we don't care what it says our denomination says this that now remember denominates it always dies and it never Rises my 3:19 God planted his tree to Bear spiritual fruit fruits of his spirit is that right but what did man man always tries to make an artificial form he did back there he does now now let's fire hard now and quick a man always tried to keep the spiritual church and make it artificial my goodness all right praise the Lord you feeling all right we're going to try to skip around and try to find a close might be a while you feeling okay we've only been an hour I'm going to try to make this highspeed finish got a few more minutes Amen in 4:15 it says what but what he was God's perfect Prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree Glory going to say something directly if he is the bridegroom tree do you believe it amen from the Garden of Eden then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bride tree she's got to be born of the same material the word made flesh in the tree hope you get it it's the same life in this female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride the work works that I do shall you do also is that right he is the bridegroom remember I am the vine ye are the branches my my we're going to these signs shall follow them that are believers not make Believers but Believers these things that I do you will do and vindicate that you are a Believer just the same as the works that I have done because the living father lives in me it ain't me doing the work it's my father and it won't be you doing the work it will be me in you doing the work see now you go into the world otherwise you're going to form what is known to me as the bride amen I'll go with you and you will be part of me I will be you will be my bride my life will be in your body just like a husband and wife are one person you and I are going to be one at that day you will know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you in me oh I just love that Satan just gets so angry at that see the Oneness of God all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church there you are makes them one oh don't you love that God wants to restore this kind of Fellowship a Oneness he said I would be in you it's not going to be you it's going to be my father that's in you doing the works oh I can just let go and let God I can just rest assure God you made the promise you said you would do this I believe it and God uses Believers to vindicate his word aren't you grateful you're a Believer aren't you grateful he planted something in your heart that you can believe and you can humble yourself say God I I don't feel like I'm really all what you you said but you know what I'm not basing it on my feelings I'm basing it on faith in your Eternal Word faith that you are able to restore me to the sound mind that you promised I would have amen now this is in 486 now look God never put out an organization the church was grafted in an organization and God cuts it off cuts it off cuts off the lifeline and it Bears organizational fruit but if the vine put forth another branch and it come out of the vine it'll bear the same that it did and you see the first one was Rome sent their Beetle out there and ate it off but God is going to grow one so high that it can't touch it it's going to come up it's going to come on up amen you can just say it's going to come on up let's go the tree goes from one place to another from one dispensation to another from Luther it went into Wesley and from Wesley went to Pentecost it goes to the word amen my I cannot rush over this this is now we're definitely coming to a close in um 488 it says it is Easter again for the True Believer of his never-failing word it is Easter it is a resurrection God has got of people everywhere am it's Easter for them why they have risen amen risen from those Creeds and denominations and come up through them it's Easter again the Royal seed has been hid in The Roots the word hid back there in his word for years and years and years and just now he began to reveal it's Easter time predestinated from the foundation of the world this church has begun to stand notice how God's predestinated in the beginning I got now I'm going to say anyhow all right notice here to restore the first Perfect Tree in three days after it's dead after the first tree's death He restored it in three days is that right restore back now the brid tree is also going to be restored in Three Ages or three stages rather the three stages it'll be restoration now look what justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost 1 2 3 now notice after three days the first tree restored at the beginning having the same signs and the same wonders Jesus came back and and the sign the signs appeared not at the end of the day oh brother not at the end of the first day I hope you're getting it the third day is when the real manifestation of Christ was made known at the end of the third day notice are you getting it not the first day dead form second day there was a rumor the second day he was still dead Luther Wesley at the beginning of the third day there was a rumor around all right not the first day Luther nothing the second but it was in the third day day the dispensation of the Holy Spirit there was a rumor around that said he's the same yesterday today and forever but at the end of the third day that's where he made himself known he came right down Among Us and came among the people and said look at me I'm the same one 496 he says what and that's what the evening light has come forth amen what is the evening light for to restore you get it amen the evening light is he is for the same purpose the Morning Light was for to restore what was cut down in the Dark Ages through exactly the way he did it would be again in the evening light see what I mean oh it's wonderful and no we're living here right here to see it now the evening lights evening lights exactly according to prophecy my my now I can't leave it without this 502 now listen closely now listen but don't miss this there was four death Messengers or would you rather just close listen real close now look there are four four death Messengers killed the tree that's right congregation says amen the Palmer worm the Locust the cankerworm the caterpillar is that right four messengers of Roman Devils dogmas killed that tree one took the fruit one took the bark one took the leaves one took the bark and took the life is that right the four messengers of Dogma killed the tree all but the roots and if four messengers of death killed the tree there's four messengers of life to restore the tree do you get it amen I will restore it he is going to restore it how by four death Messengers killed it four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what's the fourth the word the word there's the four Great prophets one of them Martin began to Shine the Light there was just a little light just a very small strength of justification came along Wesley stronger sanctification after Wesley came stronger than him Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great prophecy but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the very word the word of the Lord came to the prophet in the evening lights it shall come and restore to bring back what to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers the fourth light four Killers took it four Messengers destroy it four messengers of death took it away in dogmas four messengers of righteousness have restored it again prophesy prophesy son of man take these can these bones live again wish we had time I would write it down there and and I have to miss it pro prophesy can these bones live again that's the four stages of the coming of the church what the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones come forth but the life only came when the senu Skins Came Upon it but when the wind blew upon them that's when it came the fourth messenger of life my when the spirit began to come and bring his promise to a reality I will restore sayith the Lord hallelujah glory pleasa be to God the fourth light is come and it will bring forth the same signs my justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the bark the doctrine of Holiness what brought back the leaves Pentecost what is it Pentecost they clapped their hands they got to Joy and rejoicing Pentecost what was the the fourth one was the word itself the word made flesh the fruit and proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ was finally the that after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organization died out and Christ has again centered himself like the cap of the pyramid amen praise the Lord my and we'll close with this as we invite the musicians just trust that this little Fellowship that we've had has encouraged your heart but he says this in 5:19 now we might as well read 518 says there they are one altogether one in us the same signs human beings can't do it it's manifesting themselves come out the word to bring forth the predestinated word of God out of the roots of the tree back Yonder they all that all the denominations had refused refused refused but there will come a light forth there will come a light will rise whereabout over in Jerusalem no sir evening lights will not rise in Jerusalem evening lights goes where in the west they had their day and refused it but the evening light shall rise in the west what for to shine upon the word to ripen the fruit to bring forth the bride tree with the same signs the same wonders the same fruit they had at the beginning it shall be light in the evening time right oh the word will bring forth fruit in its season it will not wither but it'll bring forth its fruit David said in his season amen the same fruit it had at the beginning amen now we now with his word in his predestinated stage he has got it now and we see the words being manifested what is it it's perfect Vindication that the coming of the Lord is at hand and the time when he said I will restore sayeth the Lord all that the cankerworms all that the Methodist left all that the caterpillar has eaten all that this done after they stripped it down but I will restore in the evening time let us stand [Music] if you'll Ponder these things in your heart and I trust that God will do something in your life to bring a restoration you know when the presence of the Lord comes the word is a discerner and he knows your address you know William brandham the prophet is off the scene but the holy spirit is here and he is a discerner and if you have a need and the Lord's discerned you and you want to give your heart to the Lord or you haven't been baptized and the word has convicted your heart I just encourage you be willing to do whatever he told you let's pray together Heavenly Father we so thankful for your presence we thankful for your word Lord how it is a path it's a light to our path and Lord we just know that it's led

God cannot create something and something happened to deform it and it remains in that state no I don't don't care what happened I like what he said regardless of the circumstance of the condition God will bring it right back to what he wanted it so at the end whatever God wanted it to be it's going to be that I love it so your mistakes can't stop him and your faults and your your your your own judgment and your own accusation people's accusation nothing will change it what God Said will be is what's going to be at the end time why because he's the god of not just creation but restoration so he creates something happened to it he's able to bring it right back to what he created it to be that's wonderful that is wonderful and I was thinking as our brother was speaking when he in his first coming he he couldn't claim he just came to pay the price he just came to die because there was a penalty of death and and something had to die so we can live but in the second coming this is now time to claim that's why he said there's a law in you in the end time because of the death because of the price that was paid you can stand you and say this is mine good health is mine the Holy Ghost is mine whatever you have need of it's mine you have the right to claim it why because the the price has already paid and he's here to restore it to the original state and you couldn't hunger for it if it wasn't for you we're not here impersonating somebody else whatever is in your heart is what you were intended to be message of restoration I tell you I I I want to go home just with a smile and with the joy in my heart to know that whatever was wrong in this day today whatever I had done wrong God is able to take it and fix it I I tell you I don't care if it's death if it's whatever God can resurrect it he can bring it right back to what it was about I done this it doesn't matter the end time message is the god who stands and he said I'm here to restore it right back to what I wanted it
