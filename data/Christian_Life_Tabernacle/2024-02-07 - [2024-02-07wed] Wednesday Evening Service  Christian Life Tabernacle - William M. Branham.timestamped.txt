[28:05] father we'll give you the glory and we
[28:07] just commit it all to you in the mighty
[28:08] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[28:11] amen if you have your Bibles and just
[28:14] turn with me into Genesis
[28:17] 1 we're going to take a
[28:20] text uh and just read through we know
[28:24] Genesis is the seed chapter it's where
[28:27] we see the beginning of all things we
[28:29] see the true intent of God and and as
[28:32] we've been fellowshipping I just enjoyed
[28:34] the continuity of God's word and just
[28:36] the fellowship that we've had and the
[28:39] things that the ministry has brought and
[28:42] we're just going to take a text from
[28:43] Genesis
[28:44] 1:1 as it reads and God said let the
[28:47] Earth bring forth grass and the herb
[28:49] yelding seed and the
[28:51] fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind
[28:55] whose seed is in itself upon the the
[28:57] Earth and it was so just skip on down
[29:00] the 26 it says and God said let us make
[29:03] man in our image after our likeness and
[29:05] let us and let them have dominion over
[29:08] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[29:10] over the cattle and over the Earth and
[29:13] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[29:14] upon the Earth so God created man in his
[29:17] own image and the image of God created
[29:19] he him male and female created he them
[29:23] and God blessed them and God said unto
[29:25] them be fruitful and multiply and
[29:26] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[29:29] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[29:31] and over the fowl of the air and over
[29:33] every living thing that moved upon the
[29:36] Earth God bless you we ask that you to
[29:38] have your
[29:40] seats as the Lord just bless the reading
[29:43] of his word where you read his word it
[29:45] can't return void and the the promise
[29:48] and the reason we took this text as we
[29:50] see here in the very beginning a
[29:52] proclamation that that we've been
[29:54] fellowshipping on is that each seed has
[29:56] to bring forth of his kind and when you
[29:59] look into the Book of Genesis we see
[30:01] here God creating Adam in his very image
[30:04] giving him dominion over the land Over
[30:06] the Sea over the foul over the air over
[30:08] every living thing but in here is a is a
[30:11] promise or a commission that he would be
[30:13] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[30:16] Earth and when we look at this promise
[30:19] it's before even Adam is formed Out of
[30:21] the Dust of the earth it's it's it's a
[30:24] beautiful image that our prophet's able
[30:26] to take us to see is that in this image
[30:29] Adam is a spirit in the very image of
[30:32] God for God is a spirit and he's
[30:35] complete but yet there's this
[30:37] Proclamation that he'd be fruitful so we
[30:40] want to see the seed form that Adam is
[30:42] in here is a perfect image it's a seed
[30:46] image it's the image of God it and it's
[30:50] I I say complete because Eve is in him
[30:53] at this point right it she's not yet
[30:56] taken now Adam is not yet made in the
[30:59] image of a beast forming the in the dust
[31:01] of the earth if you follow the teaching
[31:03] of of our prophet he lets us know that
[31:06] here Adam is now made in the image and
[31:09] when he talks about it and and we'll
[31:11] just I guess we could read it here um if
[31:13] you read on down in Genesis uh 2 and7 it
[31:18] says and the Lord formed Man Out of the
[31:20] Dust of the ground and breathed in him
[31:22] the nostrils in his nostrils the breath
[31:25] of life and he became a living soul and
[31:29] uh many theologians get confounded at
[31:31] this they they're they're so diluted in
[31:33] their thinking they have no wisdom a
[31:35] Godly understanding that they would try
[31:37] to make this two oratories of the same
[31:40] creation but thank God for a prophet who
[31:42] could come and tell us what this
[31:45] creation is because we find ourselves
[31:48] there and we find ourselves receiving
[31:50] the same commission be fruitful and
[31:53] multiply okay that that is a promise I
[31:57] love the way that the prophet would put
[31:59] it it's just one line I'm taking here
[32:01] from spoken words the original see but
[32:03] brother brandom said God promised to
[32:05] multiply them but they had to wait until
[32:08] God's time and I I love that because
[32:11] when you read that scripture if you put
[32:13] it up and you're looking at Genesis when
[32:15] he says in the in uh verse one and he
[32:19] says he blessed them and God said to
[32:22] them in verse uh 20
[32:25] 28 be fruitful and
[32:29] multiply and
[32:31] uh just making sure I finding my place
[32:33] with you here if if most of us would
[32:36] read this you would almost read as a
[32:39] command right you You' think that there
[32:41] was something they were to accomplish
[32:43] something they were to do and and yet
[32:46] here God is it's a
[32:48] promise and that's when you're in the
[32:51] right channel I I appreciated my brother
[32:53] Matthew is sharing a thought it was what
[32:55] was the mistake that they made when they
[32:58] received the Commandments when God was
[33:00] asking to do they took it upon
[33:02] themselves as we'll do this and you take
[33:04] a look at what that was the very
[33:06] provocation to Eve was hey here's this
[33:09] promise you could be as Gods you could
[33:10] know both good and evil and you can
[33:13] bring forth this life this is your way
[33:16] of doing it and it's the same and what
[33:18] did that seed produce It produced a can
[33:21] right and and what did true to its
[33:23] father it it
[33:25] approached what can I do I will I'll
[33:28] make a a beautiful offering I'll bring
[33:30] the labor of my the field and the toil
[33:32] of my hands and I'm going to bring
[33:34] something beautiful and I'm going to
[33:36] take pleasure in the offering that I
[33:38] bring and yet here's a
[33:41] paradigm and I think every child of God
[33:44] is faced with this what can I
[33:47] bring there's there's there's no fruit
[33:50] in my hands there's no labor that I
[33:53] could bring and there's a there's
[33:55] something in the heartbeat of a Son of
[33:57] God that says I want to produce the life
[34:00] I want to produce this seed how can it
[34:02] be done I have no life of myself but
[34:06] it's the promise that he said multiply
[34:10] replenish the Earth and and we're living
[34:13] under that promise
[34:14] amen I thank the Lord for that we're not
[34:18] living by a man's idea we're not living
[34:22] by man's effort we're living by the
[34:23] spoken word of
[34:25] God
[34:27] The Original
[34:29] Seed so here's the
[34:31] promise to multiply to replenish it's a
[34:35] promise that the seed would bring forth
[34:37] of its kind
[34:39] and it's going to set there man bypasses
[34:43] it he goes his own way but there it is
[34:47] God's going to fulfill his word because
[34:48] we want we know one thing God's word
[34:50] can't return void if he's spoken it he's
[34:53] going to accomplish it just and now
[34:56] here's the pattern if he said let there
[34:58] be light there's going to be light the
[35:01] he he proves himself throughout creation
[35:04] he comes to this and he says multiply
[35:08] and
[35:08] now many may think that was
[35:12] fulfilled but we know through a
[35:14] prophet's message that sets there and
[35:17] then Isaiah would pick it up Hallelujah
[35:20] and he would he would catch the
[35:22] inspiration of it but I want you to
[35:24] notice now the predestin ated seed of
[35:27] that is something that you as a Believer
[35:30] or partaker in you are that
[35:33] fruit you are that one that's been born
[35:36] again because the seed of God sets there
[35:39] predestinated you know the SE work many
[35:42] people take the sewer they think God is
[35:44] just uh walking along spreading seed and
[35:47] and just somehow casting it but I we we
[35:52] uh planted some tomato seeds recently
[35:54] you know in Texas you got to get ahead
[35:55] of the Season you can't just wait that
[35:57] The Season's limited so you actually
[35:59] have to be planting your seeds now uh
[36:02] because otherwise by the time they're
[36:04] just coming to fruit that's going to be
[36:06] too hot and they're just going to choke
[36:07] out we've tried to grow tomatoes enough
[36:09] to learn that so you're starting the
[36:12] seed and you're being diligent you're
[36:15] taking that seed you know exactly what
[36:16] you're planning I'm planting tomatoes
[36:18] you're putting in the soil and you know
[36:20] exactly where you're putting it I mean
[36:22] some people even go put spoons or labels
[36:24] or whatever and if Ming is intelligent
[36:27] is doing that do you think God doesn't
[36:28] know where he planted his
[36:30] seed okay that it's a predestinated seed
[36:34] he's for ordained it and he put it into
[36:37] Earth and
[36:38] vessels and it's in you amen I there's
[36:43] enough signs in history in your life to
[36:46] be sitting here tonight that we should
[36:48] not doubt the foreordination of God that
[36:51] you're sitting here hearing the spoken
[36:53] word of God by a prophet messenger and
[36:57] we've gathered underneath it in this day
[36:59] we can we should be rejoicing we should
[37:02] be beyond the the idea of wondering what
[37:04] he's planted in US I mean let's face it
[37:07] I don't you think the devil's tried to
[37:09] discourage every single one of you here
[37:11] you're not good enough you've you've
[37:14] you've sinned the way the day of Grace
[37:16] you you've gone too far um you you know
[37:19] but where are you at you should stand
[37:22] here right now and you could say boo
[37:24] devil you yeah I me myself I there was a
[37:28] point just in recent weeks I didn't know
[37:29] ID be here I could say thank you Lord we
[37:34] should have the confidence of all people
[37:35] to be able to look Satan in the eye and
[37:37] say you can't stop this it's going to
[37:39] take a stronger win than this you can't
[37:42] keep the seed from coming forth and
[37:44] declaring what God's foreordained it to
[37:47] declare who planted it
[37:52] right praise be to God our confidence is
[37:56] so sure in this day I mean and all glory
[38:00] goes to
[38:02] God now I like this so there's a way we
[38:07] know this you know this is not uh there
[38:09] there's a there's an order that God has
[38:11] the the bedding ground you know there's
[38:13] the seed and there's the beding ground I
[38:16] the scripture is too clear in the types
[38:18] for us to just think that uh there's not
[38:21] a if you will a natural element to this
[38:23] it's all played out and type there's
[38:26] going to be an element where we have to
[38:29] be a husbandman what was the Commandment
[38:31] of to Adam in the very beginning to have
[38:33] dominion so you now have a
[38:36] soil that you need to be tilling that
[38:39] you need to be the husbandman of that
[38:41] you need to be exercising dominion over
[38:44] because you've been given Dominion
[38:46] anything that tells you that this flesh
[38:48] is bigger than you is a lie it's dead at
[38:51] Calvary you're you're you can reckon
[38:53] Yourself Dead there and and if you
[38:56] haven't come to recognize that there's a
[38:59] you can find that you have to let the
[39:01] dation and the travel run its course and
[39:04] don't settle for a a a thirst a
[39:07] perverted thirst that keeps you short of
[39:10] having
[39:11] that seed die out so that Christ can
[39:15] live and sometimes that's a daily dying
[39:17] out you don't think this thing comes
[39:19] back and and you Your Own Worst Enemy so
[39:22] that's what we're dealing with is a
[39:23] betting ground Mary I I like like this
[39:26] brother Brandon in Mary's belief would
[39:29] say and Mary knew that she had just read
[39:31] the day before I Isaiah 9:6 that
[39:35] something was about to happen and she
[39:38] knowed it was on the way she was in the
[39:40] word feeding she was now she's feeding
[39:43] on a truth for her day it's being
[39:47] quickened to her a prophet's message in
[39:51] time in season Finding the betting
[39:53] ground of Mary and it's being now
[39:56] Quicken to her and if and what is this
[39:59] Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born
[40:02] unto us a son is given and the
[40:04] government shall be upon his shoulder
[40:06] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[40:08] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[40:11] father the Prince of Peace Hallelujah so
[40:14] where is that now that's a prophetic
[40:16] word a spoken word that's being
[40:18] quickened in the bedding ground it had
[40:20] to come in through her she had to read
[40:23] the word she had to hear the word it had
[40:26] to come in and then it had to be
[40:27] quickened now the mystery of this is is
[40:31] is that the seed of God in its season
[40:36] will always be anointed it will always
[40:39] be quickened you you're you're not going
[40:42] to find the seed of God in the season
[40:45] without the anointing because the very
[40:46] Commission of the Hol the reason you
[40:48] can't separate the Holy Spirit and the
[40:50] word is the very holy spirit is given to
[40:52] brood out over the word to bring it to
[40:54] pass he didn't do it any other away in
[40:56] the very beginning the very seeds of the
[40:58] earth were there and the spirit of God
[41:01] brooded upon the face of the
[41:03] waters and brought it to pass the
[41:06] mystery is is that the very same Holy
[41:08] Spirit would brood over false
[41:12] seed now there is no place you will find
[41:15] the word of God sitting there and not
[41:18] being
[41:18] quickened in it's time in its season
[41:22] it's always quickened it's quickened by
[41:24] anointing it's Quicken by the spirit
[41:27] because that's you know that you don't
[41:29] put a seed in the ground and not water
[41:32] it I mean I don't know I you know maybe
[41:35] there is I'm sure some scientists could
[41:37] find I just don't know of a seed that's
[41:39] Quicken without
[41:40] moisture you know I if it's out there
[41:43] maybe but in plant life I pretty sure
[41:45] you need certain things to germinate the
[41:49] seed and it God the invisible things of
[41:52] God being clearly manifest in the things
[41:54] around us you can't can't live without
[41:57] the anointing in the spirit of God and
[41:59] it's given to you if the rain can fall
[42:01] on the unjust in the morning when we
[42:03] rise we want to be saying Lord Quicken
[42:05] the seed germ in me today by your
[42:08] presence anoint me go before me send
[42:11] your angels before me let me know you're
[42:13] with me and and there's a there's a
[42:16] thing here that is important when you
[42:20] possess the word of God we're not
[42:22] walking by sensation all right now
[42:25] follow me on this because if you're
[42:27] possessing the word of God in its time
[42:29] and season that's the faith seed to know
[42:31] that he's there looking out over his
[42:33] word that's all the confidence you need
[42:35] amen that's something that's different
[42:37] about the believer that Pentecost
[42:39] rejected they couldn't understand the
[42:41] word birth they couldn't understand that
[42:44] the faith of God could be imparted to
[42:45] someone to Quicken the word and they
[42:47] could have a born again experience they
[42:49] wanted to manufacture an
[42:52] Evidence when the very evidence is the
[42:54] fruit that it produces
[42:56] Hallelujah what's the seed of Jean got
[42:59] in you producing what's the fruits of
[43:01] the spirit that's coming out and then if
[43:04] it's not producing the fruit I don't
[43:07] care how anointed you are you need
[43:10] there's a way
[43:12] repent that's the fallacy is people
[43:15] create a false evidence so they can
[43:17] avoid the conviction of God they they
[43:20] want to claim to be children of God
[43:22] because of some false evidence when they
[43:25] need to be born again and they need to
[43:29] repent and it that goes for wearing a
[43:32] message religious cloak you want to take
[43:35] this message and use it and and think
[43:37] you've got some
[43:39] entitlement and the Very fruits that's
[43:42] living in your
[43:44] life just Lord help
[43:48] us we don't you know religion's a is a
[43:52] is a a
[43:54] blinding spirit a way Seth right unto a
[43:57] man and the and the end thereof is death
[44:00] you you want to understand how close it
[44:01] is that could deceive the very elective
[44:03] possible and you have to understand now
[44:06] the setting that brother brandham is in
[44:08] when he sits there and he goes to that
[44:10] meeting as a young Minister and he's
[44:11] sing seeing the Holy Spirit now move and
[44:14] the gifts operating and one of them
[44:17] being a true genuine seed and one of
[44:19] them
[44:20] not and the confusion that that brings
[44:23] I'm so thankful that we don't have to be
[44:26] confused okay what you can be certain of
[44:30] is that the rain does
[44:32] fall okay and you must live by
[44:37] it you must live by it but what you
[44:40] don't you're not going to be choked out
[44:42] by the tears you're not going to be
[44:44] choked out by that false Vine you're not
[44:46] going to be confounded that there's
[44:48] going to be those who named this message
[44:50] and they don't live it now there's Grace
[44:54] right because this message is pruning
[44:57] and that we we want to progress um and
[45:00] go forward that's a little of the
[45:02] thought today um as we were just seeking
[45:06] the mind of the Lord and and trying to
[45:08] to have a little quietness um a a couple
[45:12] trucks showed up out in front of the
[45:14] house and I look out the window and
[45:16] there's these big green
[45:18] trucks with some owl on it and a hat and
[45:23] some guys come out and all of a sudden
[45:25] there's about an hour or two of
[45:30] chainsaws and I'm just and I'm just
[45:32] sitting there going dear
[45:34] Lord I know your Will's in this I'm
[45:37] trying to be settled I'm a very as a
[45:40] sound guy I very sensitive to
[45:45] sound and so I just sitting there a
[45:48] moment I go outside well what are they
[45:50] doing they got to maybe they're going to
[45:51] remove one of these Elms maybe they're
[45:53] going to be doing something I look and
[45:54] they're trimming up a tree tree and
[45:57] they're climbing and they're being
[45:58] careful they're deadwooding it and I
[46:01] sitting there as
[46:04] thinking and I was drawn to
[46:08] this
[46:10] and in
[46:12] Mark 4: 11 it's the parable of the
[46:17] swer and there's something that happens
[46:19] in this we know that there's many
[46:21] grounds that the seed would Fallen if we
[46:23] could take the time just to read it
[46:24] starting in chapter 11 we'll try to
[46:26] progress but there's something that
[46:28] stuck to me out to me in that and he
[46:33] said unto
[46:34] them unto you it is given to know the
[46:37] mystery of the kingdom of God but unto
[46:40] them that are without all these things
[46:43] are done in Parables that seeing they
[46:45] may see and not perceive and hearing
[46:48] they may hear and not understand lest at
[46:51] any time they should be converted and
[46:53] their sin should be forgiven them now
[46:56] now that speaks of a very heart intent
[47:00] in the sewing of the word of God you can
[47:03] say is it you know in the Book of
[47:04] Revelations blessed are the eyes and
[47:06] ears that hear the prophecy of this book
[47:09] you can if you have been giving
[47:11] understanding if you've been giving eyes
[47:13] to see it's because he's opened your
[47:15] eyes to see and and so many of these
[47:18] things they're
[47:20] imparable to people they can see the
[47:23] type but we're the living
[47:27] word of
[47:30] this
[47:32] amen and he said unto them know ye this
[47:35] Parable and how that then will you know
[47:39] all Parables The
[47:41] Seer Seth the word and these are they
[47:45] that by the wayside were the where the
[47:47] word is s but they that heard Satan
[47:50] cometh immediately and taketh away the
[47:52] word that was sown in their hearts and
[47:54] these are they like likewise which are
[47:56] sown on Stony ground who when they had
[47:59] heard the word immediately received it
[48:01] with gladness and have no root in
[48:04] themselves and so endure for but a Time
[48:07] afterwards when Affliction and
[48:08] persecution ariseth for the word's sake
[48:11] immediately they are offended and these
[48:14] are they which are sown among Thorns
[48:17] such as that hear the word and the cares
[48:19] of the world and the deceitfulness of
[48:22] riches and the lust of the things that
[48:25] enter in choke out the word and becometh
[48:29] unfruitful so what's the Commandment in
[48:31] the very beginning be fruitful what's
[48:34] going to make you
[48:36] unfruitful and just you can go back
[48:38] anytime you want to know things that can
[48:41] cause you to be unfruitful Jesus is
[48:42] laying this out there for you cares
[48:47] deceitfulness the the any you know lust
[48:50] of this world any temporal pleasure so
[48:52] many times we're faced with the choice
[48:56] do something that's not expedient that's
[48:58] not profitable it's it's maybe not
[49:00] unlawful but is it spiritually
[49:03] profitable and it's so easy to do
[49:06] something that's not
[49:08] profitable it helps it causes you to be
[49:11] unfruitful and these are they which are
[49:13] sown in good ground thank you Lord such
[49:16] as hear the word of God and receive it
[49:18] and bring forth fruit some 30-fold some
[49:22] 60 and some 100 and I I pray that
[49:25] whatever wherever we're at we want to be
[49:28] hundredfold so there's a process by
[49:30] which we're going to get to the H
[49:32] hundredfold amen and that is through
[49:35] when he says these things there's a a
[49:40] promise that's
[49:42] given and it's in John 15
[49:45] 1-8 he says I am the True Vine and my
[49:49] father is the husbandman when they were
[49:51] climbing the trees I was watching the
[49:53] care that they were giving every branch
[49:55] anch in me that beareth not fruit he
[49:58] taketh away and so what they were doing
[50:00] in the tree is they're doing what they
[50:02] called deadwooding all right they're
[50:04] looking at the branches and they're
[50:06] saying this one isn't producing fruit
[50:08] and they're cutting it away and they're
[50:10] doing it in the right season and the
[50:12] right time with care and you don't want
[50:14] someone who doesn't know what they're
[50:16] doing
[50:17] pruning the bride tree you don't need to
[50:21] be letting something that's not the
[50:23] message of this hour do any pruning on
[50:26] you it's going to kill you it's going to
[50:28] cut off a branch that's supposed to be
[50:30] producing fruit we're not as the bride
[50:33] of Christ the wound is sealed all right
[50:37] we're not here receiving man's idea
[50:40] we're not dabbling in theology we're not
[50:43] dabbling in in philosophy if that if
[50:46] you're tantalized by those things it's a
[50:49] weakness all right let let the Lord take
[50:52] that weakness and turn it into a
[50:54] strength
[50:56] but commit that to him we don't want
[50:58] itching
[51:00] ears Forever Learning this this that you
[51:04] don't turn this message and the
[51:07] heartbeat of God and the Love Letter it
[51:09] is into a
[51:12] Theology and you do that you're going to
[51:14] the very first thing you're going to do
[51:15] is start mixing it with other things
[51:18] that sound
[51:20] good and it it's just not what it's for
[51:23] every branch that beareth not for he
[51:25] taketh uh taketh away and every branch
[51:28] that beareth fruit he purgeth it that's
[51:31] the word that struck me he purges it
[51:33] that it might bring forth more fruit so
[51:36] if we want to bring forth more fruit
[51:38] there's going to be a
[51:40] purging and I how are we
[51:44] purged amen if you if you look in
[51:48] Ephesians uh it's a verse
[51:51] 26 he says that he might sanctify and
[51:54] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[51:56] of the
[51:57] word
[51:59] amen I I actually just reading that I
[52:02] know there was several things that
[52:04] really struck to me if we could turn
[52:06] that to that scripture I think it' be
[52:08] worth just taking a look at
[52:10] that um this is a a a chapter that means
[52:14] a lot to me and especially in my my
[52:16] youth I I think I saw Redeeming the time
[52:19] up in verse
[52:20] 16 and thought of all the things that I
[52:23] had done the days that were evil and I
[52:25] and I was like you know how do we redeem
[52:27] the time but we're just looking here in
[52:29] in 26 that he may sanctify and cleanse
[52:32] it with the washing of the water of the
[52:34] word and if you back up this is
[52:36] bookended quite beautifully in verse 25
[52:39] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[52:42] also loved the church and gave himself
[52:44] for
[52:46] it that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[52:49] with the washing by the water of the
[52:52] word that he might present it to himself
[52:54] a glor glorious church not having spot
[52:57] or wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[53:00] should be holy and without blemish amen
[53:03] so what's the purging going to bring
[53:06] forth a bride what's the word in our day
[53:09] doing it's washing us it's cleansing us
[53:11] from all unbelief there's a message that
[53:14] is dressing a bride amen and just even
[53:17] earlier in Ephesians if you want to look
[53:19] it it goes over what the fruits of the
[53:20] spirit are and what the the purging
[53:23] should be allowing to present
[53:25] and to bring
[53:27] forth
[53:28] amen but it's it's in that
[53:33] pruning and that purging that's where
[53:35] you find most people will make their
[53:37] mistake because it's supposed to be a
[53:40] point and in time where maybe the tree
[53:42] looks a little more Barren maybe it
[53:44] looks a little more bare there's not the
[53:46] branches and I that's the the time where
[53:50] instead of being patient and letting the
[53:52] the work take its place often man tries
[53:55] to manufacture something and instead of
[53:58] letting that pruning process and that
[54:00] purging process take course that's where
[54:03] you find people run after a covering
[54:06] they run after they they they don't want
[54:08] the nakedness exposed they don't want
[54:10] the pruning of the word they're going to
[54:12] want to have uh something they play a
[54:15] part
[54:16] in and and the the patience to wait on
[54:20] God and know that if he's purging and
[54:23] his pruning it's going to bring forth
[54:25] fruit we just want to wait on God when
[54:28] we're when we're being uh pruned no
[54:31] chastisement is Pleasant at the time but
[54:35] in the end it's going to bring forth
[54:36] fruit it's going to be
[54:38] fruitful you want to deny yourself you
[54:41] want to deny your ideas and and allow
[54:44] those things to be cut
[54:45] away
[54:49] amen and it's it's in that that we find
[54:54] that it's the very dressing of a bride
[54:57] it's the dress wear that this word is is
[54:59] performing in the pruning and the
[55:01] washing and the purging in it it is
[55:04] speaking to the heart and tent of a
[55:06] bridegroom that has a desire that the
[55:08] bride would be dressed in a certain way
[55:11] that she would have an attribute that
[55:14] reflects him she's bone of his bone
[55:17] flesh of his flesh the very thing when
[55:20] when Eve is taken out of Adam the
[55:22] Declaration is bone of my bone Flesh of
[55:24] My flesh and we see that's the very
[55:26] thing that happens again in the New
[55:28] Testament when he's speaking of the
[55:30] Bride it's going to be a bride that's
[55:32] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[55:34] that's the image of who he is that
[55:37] they're one and the same when they when
[55:39] one reflects the other it's declaring
[55:41] the attributes of who he is and spoken
[55:45] word is the Original
[55:47] Seed brother brandham says in paragraph
[55:51] 73 he says them kind that takes the word
[55:54] is God 's true bride bringing forth
[55:56] children they can't die a child the
[56:00] bride brings forth on the word can't die
[56:04] because it's the word amen did you get
[56:06] it she can't die CU she's that child
[56:10] can't die CU he's a word child he's a
[56:14] seed child he's an eternal child
[56:17] Hallelujah so the be fruitful multiply
[56:21] and replenish the Earth is something
[56:24] that the bride of Christ in this day is
[56:27] manifesting because she is bearing
[56:30] word
[56:32] children and that child can't die one of
[56:35] the things brother Brandon would say is
[56:37] that you have the power to impart
[56:39] eternal life what are you carriers
[56:42] of the word the very word Gene of God
[56:47] and if you're carrying the word then it
[56:50] can produce the very life of God it's
[56:53] the very thing that can quicken in your
[56:56] brother and your sister Sons and
[56:58] Daughters of God we should always be one
[57:00] to be willing vessels that can be in the
[57:03] place in the season to be speaking the
[57:05] word of God Amen and your confidence is
[57:08] is that seed can't return
[57:10] void I love that quote I'm just going to
[57:13] read it again them kind that takes the
[57:16] word is God's true bride bringing forth
[57:19] children they can't die a child the
[57:22] bride brings forth on the word can't die
[57:26] because it's the word amen did you get
[57:30] it I I say Lord help me get it the
[57:34] confidence that we should have in the
[57:36] seed that's in US is that it's going to
[57:38] produce we're a bride that's been
[57:41] brought to the point of expectancy that
[57:43] we're producing the very likeness and
[57:45] image of God and that it's going to be
[57:47] fruitful it's going to multiply and it's
[57:50] going to replenish and it's to his glory
[57:53] this is his desire seed
[57:56] was there's no
[57:58] lying when the fruit comes out there's
[58:02] no wonder anymore what the seed was
[58:05] there's no guesswork they might grow up
[58:07] together they might that may look alike
[58:09] there may be a there may be a
[58:12] shook but there's a pulling away there's
[58:14] a separating and it's that's the pruning
[58:18] that's the separating you know that's
[58:20] that's the time of
[58:21] despisement that's the time when Deus th
[58:24] for forsaken me that's the time when the
[58:26] the world wants to sit and despise this
[58:29] message you know brother brandom in the
[58:30] Peaks there's a low time there's a time

[1:01:59] promise why do you think the devil hates
[1:02:01] the type of man and wife in Christ in a

[1:02:07] it's a
[1:02:11] promise according to Malachi 4 is
[1:02:13] scripture there would rise a message
[1:02:16] that would shake the hearts of the
[1:02:17] people right back to the apostolic
[1:02:19] fathers again there's to rise one on the
[1:02:21] scene in the power of Elisha that will
[1:02:23] rise on the scene in the wilderness man
[1:02:25] that would come out and have the message
[1:02:28] that'll run right straight back to the
[1:02:29] word again that's the hour that we're

[1:05:10] Fable it's a Living
[1:05:12] Word well let's get there let's look at
[1:05:15] Isaiah
[1:05:22] 61 the spirit of the Lord Lord is upon
[1:05:24] me because the Lord hath anointed me to
[1:05:26] preach good things under the
[1:05:31] Beek Jesus Christ
[1:05:33] himself did he come without
[1:05:39] anointing was the promise ever that the
[1:05:41] word would manifest and there not be the
[1:05:43] spirit there to brood out over
[1:05:47] it
[1:05:49] no
[1:05:51] no any spirit that would try to take
[1:05:55] away a gift from the
[1:05:57] bride that doesn't want
[1:06:00] Rebecca to be outfitted and adorned in
[1:06:03] all the gifts just wants to delay her
[1:06:06] departure well come on just wants to
[1:06:09] keep her in the tent a little longer and
[1:06:10] it's

[1:06:24] stall tactic I mean look at the goods I
[1:06:29] mean looks pretty legit this guy must
[1:06:33] have what he's talking about I mean what
[1:06:36] does this messenger do is there not a
[1:06:39] gift that he didn't deliver to the bride
[1:06:42] which promise did he say didn't
[1:06:46] qualify I don't know if any place he
[1:06:48] said speaking of
[1:06:50] tongues shouldn't be
[1:06:52] there you know what's
[1:06:54] interesting is somehow because he cried
[1:06:57] out against that religious spirit that
[1:06:58] would take the gifts and use it as a
[1:07:00] justification for sinful living has been
[1:07:04] used to take away a righteous life from
[1:07:07] partaking in the
[1:07:10] fruits but Lord let the fruits of
[1:07:13] righteousness first and foremost father
[1:07:16] but if you want to Adorn it with gifts
[1:07:19] so there's fruits that could
[1:07:21] edify Lord then Grant the fruit fruits

[1:07:28] 61 because the Lord hath anointed me to

[1:09:34] together and his word cannot return void
[1:09:37] the very promise that we would be
[1:09:39] fruitful was one that was given while we

[1:09:46] found now in that
[1:09:47] image and the Commandment is that we

[1:15:30] entangled with so many cares but you cut
[1:15:33] them
[1:15:35] away there's many people living a hybrid
[1:15:39] life got just enough religion to make
[1:15:41] him
[1:15:42] miserable got a gospel that allows them
[1:15:46] to go to church on Sunday watch their
[1:15:48] ball game there's no
[1:15:52] righteousness they go and they enter
[1:15:54] into an
[1:15:55] anointing and praise the Lord and the
[1:15:57] spirit of God and his goodness
[1:16:01] moves there's no life they're dead in
[1:16:04] sin and don't know it there's one day
[1:16:07] their nakedness is going to be
[1:16:11] exposed but what about
[1:16:14] us can we say thank you
[1:16:19] Jesus don't let their false feast spoil
[1:16:24] your
[1:16:27] praise they're mimicking
[1:16:30] you they're mimicking the the praise you
[1:16:33] can
[1:16:34] give they want to do it they
[1:16:39] can't there's only one provided place of
[1:16:43] worship that's in Jesus
[1:16:48] Christ they they think they have a right
[1:16:51] to
[1:16:52] worship
[1:16:53] and in vain they do
[1:16:55] it they're even sometimes lifting up an
[1:16:59] a false image and Satan's receiving
[1:17:01] worship as though he's
[1:17:04] [Music]
[1:17:05] God there's got to be an anointing where
[1:17:08] the bride is
[1:17:10] rejoicing that the bridegroom has come
[1:17:12] forth to take a bride it's the marriage
[1:17:15] of the Lamb has come you don't
[1:17:19] look if you see a sad bride there's
[1:17:22] something wrong
[1:17:27] you would want to stop the
[1:17:29] wedding there would be something and you
[1:17:31] say whoa whoa whoa hold
[1:17:34] up is this an abusive
[1:17:39] relationship why is she sad that she's
[1:17:41] married was this an arranged
[1:17:43] marriage what's going on but what has
[1:17:47] the bride in this day been betrothed
[1:17:51] with a spoken word word that called you
[1:17:54] predestinated that said that you were
[1:17:56] the very heartbeat in tent of God
[1:17:58] everything all the way through the Old
[1:18:00] Testament was shadowing a gentile
[1:18:02] bride and we can look back with this
[1:18:05] message and see it it a calling out just
