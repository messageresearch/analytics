name we pray amen amen you may be seated amen I believe we have a baby that fiction right okay so I want you to play the piano and dedicate your baby at the same time I heard you're a multitasker amen had you and your wife come and bring your baby we get dedicated at this time amen I I I think that's beautiful I I I usually do a baby dedications in the morning this is kind of nice to have one this evening so Brother Joseph and sister [Music] naris what a beautiful Family come on up here do we have a photograph up there maybe not has to maybe show the real thing there she got her mama's looks amen go ahead everybody I know she's kind oface Hallelujah this is SE Frank now SE uh appears 74 times in the Bible and uh Scholars have wondered what it means but the most of the uh spiritual schol scholars believe it means pause to praise and lift up pause to praise and lift up and uh it it also it refers to uh pause and reflect and it's a derivative from the word that means forever amen so praise and lift up the Lord forever reflect upon the Lord forever and I'd like to read the first Psalm where say law appears the first time in the Bible and it's Psalm 3 and Psalm 3 reads as follows Lord how are they increased that trouble me many are they that rise up against me many there be which say of my soul there is no help for him in God say la but thou oh Lord art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of my head I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and he heard me out of his Holy Hill saah I laid me down to sleep I awake for the Lord substained me I will not be afraid of 10,000 of people that have set themselves against me round about arise O Lord save me my God for thou haast smitten all my enemies upon the cheekbone thou haast broken the teeth of the ungodly salvation belongeth unto the Lord thy blessing is upon thy people say Lord amen what a beautiful name very very well done God bless you would you go ahead and pray for your daughter let's pray our heavenly father Lord we come before you with uh Thanksgiving for this uh addition you've made possible Lord Jesus and as we did Lord the day she was born Lord we come into your house and and dedicated

Lord all our all our efforts Lord are just in vain Lord and me pray that Lord you'd give us skill in wisdom to raise her in the admonition of the Lord and that she' prosper and be in good health Lord we commited now into your hands and dedicated to a life of service for you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen let us all pray together heavenly father as we welcome a new member of our body father of your family your child father may it always be with her as her name so describes lifting you up father praising you stopping and reflecting on you forever Lord we're just grateful for your goodness and your mercies to us and Lord we just ask that you would be a burning light in all of our Lives be a special child in The Hour That We Live May her candle always Shine for the glory of God we ask it in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen God bless thank I you so much hallelujah hallelujah God is good amen he's good all the time it's always nice to have brother Paul Minister for us I believe we're getting close to him preaching for us in English amen so um I'm longing for the day that every word that he says that he knows in English he says that and then we'll add the French where he can't complete it so we got a great challenge for you for one day for you to preach 100% English so you can preach 5050 now but we know it's possible but what I always love about the word of God when we have a brother uh minister in another language as you find out it's the same God the language doesn't change God and the message didn't change because the message wasn't given by language and the message wasn't given by print the message was given by divine revelation amen wherever God's seed was when the word was spoken the spirit of God came and revealed to that believer and that's why we have the same Revelation all across the world from many many different languages it only proves that there's one living God and the revelation of God's word is true and the goal of every Believers that's heard this message is to set their life aside that they might inherit the great prize of eternal life so we're so grateful for it's always a privilege for me to invite brother Paul to the pulpit so brother Paul God bless you if you would come with your interpreter brother Billy preach the word of God thank you brother David God bless you you know that I can preach 50505 English tonight but I be that one day maybe I will be able to preach in English or as the day of the poost to preach in one language and each one year in his own language so let's pray God our heavenly father it's a Grace and a privilege for us to be in your presence tonight and we believe that you are here to help us get into your word not just that it could be spoken out but that the word may become life in us that it may transform us that he may bring us into your image and your resemblance Lord I give you each one of your children here tonight I commit brother B into your hands father you know how much he helps me to try to translate these few words that your people may get it this thought that this little thought that's in me don't forget your servant Brother David that he has he gave this request for Tuesday father be with [Music] him you know how much he needs his vision to serve you Lord you know his devotion bless him or Beyond his uh his expectation and as we open your word come and bring it to us yourself in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I believe this morning it was a great blessing for me I wanted Brother David to continue talking [Music] because it's really the thing that God has to help us uh uh possess the true love last Tuesday I was speaking with my wife I shter portion of the scripture about Bram uh in question and answer of 57 says someone can hate you and he can prove to you that he really hates you but if inside deep inside your heart you love him regardless you are very close close to the kingdom and that's true so when Brother David was speaking this morning that came back to me I said may may the Lord help us [Music] really many times we stay around superficial things we we we we give our time or importance to things that that are really not important where there are things that God really wants to take us to I I always believe that this message has no Doctrine message is simple the message is simple as brother Bram brought it maybe I'm the [Music] problem I maybe I don't have the capacity to read between the lines or to translate what brother bam wanted to say and all I know to do is to to say what he said and if what he said can help somebody is the the goal or the motive for which we are serving him because one thing that's for sure that every word of man will be recognized as a lie and lies can only take you to death the word of God will be recognized to be the truth let's take our Bibles uh in the Book of Daniel chapter 9 thank you Daniel Daniel chapter 9 we're going to read the first five chapters sorry the the the verse 1 through five and then we'll go to verse 19 23 in the first year of Darius the son of asares and the seed of mides which was made King over the ram of calans [Music] in the first years of the reign of D of his Reign I Daniel understood by the book the number of years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem I set my face unto the unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications by fasting and sackcloth and Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping keeping the the Covenant of Mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandment [Music] we have sined we have committed iniquity and we have done Wicked and have rebelled every every even by The Parting from all thy precept and from thy judgment so he continu to pray and we're going to go to verse 19 at the end of his prayer amen he said oh Lord hear oh Lord forgive oh Lord hearken and do def differ not for thine own sake oh my God for the thy City and thy people are called by thy name and while and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of My People Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy uh for the Holy Mountain of my God yeah while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I have seen in a vision at the beginning at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about that time of the evening uh oblation and he informed me and talked to me and said oh Daniel I am come forth to give thee skill and understanding amen and at the beginning at the beginning of th supplication the Commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou are greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats from this scripture the Lord had put this little inspiration on my heart and that I'm going to call Discerning a discernment of time and our attitude Discerning discernment of time and our attitude we go towards the story of Daniel that we know how the story of Daniel in Babylon began when the King Nebuchadnezzar Jem he came and he besieged Jerusalem and in besieging Jerusalem and he ordained to the uh Chiefs of the unic to take some the children of Israel to Babylon and this young man that was to be taken to Babylon the king gave a characteristics of what these kids have to be and he said they have to be of the Royal Kingdom or the noble families in other words it was a a group of kids that had a special seed about them it was a certain kids that had a certain predisposition about them those are the ones that the king of Babylon decided to take from from Israel back to Babylon and scripture speaks that among those children Daniel Daniel was one of them an there was an anah there's Messiah and there was aaria and then when they got to Babylon they gave him other names and then to Daniel they call him Bel and to Ania they called mishak No Shadrach Shadrach M they call him M and then aaria they call him Abednego and we know many times when we speak about this young man Daniel will keep his name as Daniel but the others we speak about Shadrach M and Abednego and when these children went to Babylon they were brought uh away from the the habitat from where they came from away from the families away from the religion away from the church when they were just young children and this young man this young kids when they got to Babylon the Babylonian wanted according to the instructions of the king to to instruct them and to educate them according to their religion according to the ways of doing according to their habits but this four young men from their coming into the land they they they gave to them a proposition to eat the same food as the king to drink the same wine as the king to to to others this would have been a privilege by many ways the parents were not there the pastor was not there there was no the other brothers were not there and it seems like all our lives we're going to spend it here if they we do what they asking of us who's going to come and reproach us it's our new uh place of living en it's it's our environment they gave them a proposition this young man they didn't accept the [Applause] proposition because in them there was a seed they had a predisposition into their heart that they didn't come to church because the dad came to church because Mommy was asking me to come to church but because God placed something into my [Applause] heart that to recognize that everything that he said is life for me and everything that he didn't say I I rather give my life than to go in what he didn't say they asked for a favor to the unic of the king that what you are proposing to us according to what God has placed into our heart we cannot do it give us a favor just give us uh uh vegetables or and then give us water the unic said well if something happen it's going to be upon me that that's going to come the king will be will be furious with me he said just give us few days you can give others whatever you are proposing give us what we are asking in few days you will compare and you will present to the king both groups you will see which ones are in good standing the the unic accepted they took water and and vegetables uh certainly according to the scientist of that time it was impossible to have the the regimen or the way of eating and to be in good health but according to the one who's above science the one who realized that this young man had honor his [Music] word he who the creator of all the the the cells and the organism he came into action to give this this young man a good health to show to the king that these kids are on the right way and when they were presented they had they had a good presentation upon them than the ones who ate the food from the King maybe that if there were other kids who who didn't have the same seed in them who had tempted or tried to take the same food as what they did surely they would stand before the king they would send up uh uh and and and look very skinny why this regiment could could only work for those children who had this particular seed in them not uh uh to be amazed that when the word is brought forth if not everybody can receive that word the same way because not everybody has the same seed but when God placed the seed in us he himself he protects it he takes care of it he keeps it and we see how these young men in Babylon as they were growing up that they were considered they had a the king had a consideration about them Daniel was there interpreting the dreams of the king they had favor and those that were around they were not happy they were trying to create problems for these young men for these young menil will never be happy for you to remain a Christian that you may only that anytime you only have an absolute the only absolute to be the word of God he's always going to try to create situations or to try to bring you into a distraction and there you you you lost your vision or to try to confront you face to face it's like today I was talking with brother Billy in the office sometimes when we look at it it's with tears in our eyes it was saying the morning with love when a brother does something with with the love you go to them you you try to bring him up you you try to help him but today my brother Ben do does something wrong I haven't even talked to him I already recorded a video it's already on social media it's a distraction it's the [Music] devil the people are fighting on social media trying to find out who's who's got the most knowledge I was reading brother was saying somewhere we have a we have a generation of of Elders who have gone out they were calling them veterans but the problem is they organized themselves and they fought between themselves and they disputed among themselves it's the devil where God wants to keep us United God as he said in his prayer father that it may be one as you and I are one so the devil when if it doesn't bring you into destruction he takes you away from the word of God he's going to come to you face to face and because he couldn't take this children into destruction he confronted Shadrach Shadrach M and Abednego with a burning furnace that was heated up seven times it was to show them now you're going to you're going to deny your God but shadra Abed that King said nobody can deliver you out of my hand he said oh you are a liar our God is [Applause] capable you see you think your God will help you he said our God is able even if doesn't Deliver us if he thinks that the end of our journey is the fness we're going to go in there joyfully but we will never do this they were uh bounded they took them towards the furnace it was so hard that those that were coming to put put them in they were burned but them that were going in they didn't go in burned scientifically we don't know how to explain that there was a flame that had a temperature uh maybe below 60 FL but a flame why because they stay faithful they kept the [Applause] [Music] word and God kept his part of the contract but explains that he says when they were going into the flame oh there was an agitation with the angels were those are saying let me go and destroy everything let me go do this God looked and he said he said to what whatever concerns my children I'm not sending any of you I will go myself and I'll go down he came down in the furnace like the fourth man Daniel was confronted with with the lion dance God saved them if there was a young those were young men who kept the word and they grew old and as they grew old Daniel Daniel he came back to the word he was meditating the word what did the word say what is this supposed what what's supposed to happen in our time why is this thing happening over there why is this event over there the Bible says that in Reading Daniel came to the realization in meditating the word Daniel came to the realization Daniel discerned the time under which he was living Daniel realized in what time he was living in and when he realized the time he was living in so an attitude his attitude changed when we discern the time in which we are living when we realize the privilege under which God has placed us I I feel like saying we cannot remain indiff our attitude Daniel Daniel says that he turned towards prayer to his supplication in the fasting he was looking for communion with God because it's in prayer that we commune with God that we talk to God that God talks back to us Daniel Daniel turned towards God before we saw that Daniel was praying three times a day but when he saw by the word he turned towards prayer in the supplication in the fasting says in gab Gabriel's instruction to Daniel paragraph 78 it says I want you to notice how Daniel yet an alen yet outed from his people outed from his church without one church service without any church to go to without any hymn to sing to Be Sung but what he has sung himself in the midst of all of this still held on to what the prophet said amen amen amen amen no church to go to nobody to fellowship with everybody went to the hidden temples everybody worshiped they Idol no Christian song nobody believed the same thing he did and in 68 years from a young man from a young man of about 12 from the a young man about 12 about 12 or 14 when he was taken down there he held true to God and understood by Jeremiah's Prophet that the days were almost accomplished how that he says how that would warm the hearts of any true prophet of that of of God today that we look back and see what this true Prophet said and know that we are at the end time he said I understood by the book by the book that Jeremiah my brother many years ago prophesy that Israel will stay down here for 70 years and the time is about fulfilled and he made himself ready and he called and he called a fast and he Sanctified himself and he says the Ash and sackcloth he put upon his head and when and and went to fasting and praying to understand about what about what day they were living in and if Daniel the Prophet of the Lord could consult Jeremiah's book and it will bring such a it will bring him to to such a place that even Israel coming out all of them alive was coming out of Babylon to go back to their Homeland would cause him to fast with sackcloth and Ashes how much more how much more hard hard it to do to the Church of the Living God to know that the time is fading out and shall be no more and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the great Millennium ready to set in how can we spend uh wasteless time gambling swimming whole on Sunday no time for the Lord just run down and if the pastor uh speaks on something uh another that that you don't like you get up and you get out and if the church holds on too long why and then you are dissatisfied look at our condition look at look what we are doing compare our lives with that Prophet one man in a complete Kingdom with no church no church to go to and no and and none knowwhere else to go it was soore down and burned down his City his people was captive 68 years 68 years 69 70 he had two years left so when he began to read in the book and and see that the time was drawing n to fulfill be fulfilled he went to God In Prayer to find out about it when we read in the word when we read in the book like Jeremiah we say we see the Bible tells us what happened in the time of Noah will happen again we see how women wants to make can become beautiful with all kinds of makeup stuff what happened in the time of lot will happen again where men wants to become women women wants to become men we see all those things the Bible tells us in the last days that man will become cruel it will become enemy of those that wants to do good we see that in the Bible but instead like Daniel that our attitude be changed we are we are uh remaining in distraction we pay we give more attention to other things than the word of God says paragra 82 what a time what are we doing when nations are breaking the sea AR roaring sea a roaring men's hearts are are failing for fear perplex of time all these things the handwriting on the wall racial disintegration all kinds of evils going on into the world and FES and fights and [Music] stews and weapons hanging in the hangers that one little Nation by the size of Cuba down here can destroy the the world in 10 minutes and them fasting with one another ungodly man who knows not God and knows not his power and the Holy Spirit is in the church moving among the elect showing himself alive after 2,000 years that is the same yesterday today and forever how can we set how can we sit uh [Music] slofly how can we just run over the top of it time it says time where we are time where we checking up watching for that great hour approaching like this young man God is plac a seed in us that seed that recognizes the word of God and as we read the book may God Place into our hearts his true love that will bring us back to an attitude like one like Daniel had saysi in the uh uh 70 weeks of Daniel uh paragraph [Music] 43 now let's review just a little bit so we can get a base Dani it says now there there was Daniel was concerned about his people because he had read the Prophet Jeremiah the prophet and understood that Jeremiah had said that they would be in captivity for 7 years and then he seen that they had already been in captivity for 6 years so he knew that the time was at hand so he set aside all his work pull down as it was the shades all his day daily task set his face to God put on sackcloth and [Music] ashes and went to fasting and praying that he might understand when that time would be paragraph 44 he said now now that we found out that Daniel that he wanted this information for his people and I think if Daniel reading the prophet before [Applause] him and had this kind of understanding that he was he was near the end and sought God to find out how close the end was then I think we are Justified by seeing that we are at the end of the road now says put on uh uh put on not sackcloth and Ashes but throw all the things of the world and our cares of and and our cares of this life and seek God to find out what day of the year we are in because we are seeing that we are at the [Music] end and so that the church will Fast and pray to be ready like Daniel we have had the privilege to get into the promise concerning our time because when we read the book we see Daniel who saw the Plan of Redemption he saw it for the Jews and for the Gentiles he wanted to write it in Daniel chapter 12 the scripture say Daniel go in peace do not write this things but in the end time when these things will be revealed the knowledge shall increase So Daniel saw things that God told him not to write about it because he thought about you and I in whom God had placed his seated for the end time when John came about God John saw the same thing God revealed to him the Plan of Redemption John wanted to write it God told him to seal those things but the day of the voice of the seventh angel when he begin to sound the trumpet but the mystery of God God has given us Grace in placing his seat inside of us to bring us in contact with the message of the seventh angel and we know that this messenger of the seventh angel is the same of malach 4 he has to come and open the word before this coming of the Lord that he must come and give us all the material so we are able to go and meet him in the [Music] air and this seventh angel God gave him the ability for him to reveal things to us so today I can no longer come I'm going to come and preach to you the mystery of for for me there are no more Mysteries the seventh angel has already brought it forth and like this morning like Brother David was saying with a with a message we are reading through the book we can read the book and realize what's written on the book Jesus himself in Matthew chapter 24 he described to us the Plan of Redemption when they asked him a question he described the Plan of Redemption and when I went home between services can I was reading in the Seal's book and I fall upon something I Came Upon something in the Sixth Seal tells us that in Matthew 24 Jesus preached the seventh seal and he took his Bible I believe it's the Sixth Seal uh paragraph 140 it said he said now let's look at Ma Matthew chapter Matthew 24 the lamb himself speaking now it said now anyone knows that Christ is the author of the whole book as far as as far as that concerned but it's his speech here he his seron the people all right the Jews it says now I want you to hold your book like this Matthew 24 so I'll take like brother bam was speaking Matthew 24 like thisth apy Matthew 2 Matthew 24 and and Revelation chapter 6 so he wants us to take the book like this Matthew 24 and Revelation chapter 6 he says he says now watch this you you you can find out just how it is see what the lamb what what the lamb here is showing Sy exactly in symbols ex what he said over here in the word doing exactly continues paragraph 147 that's where he began to H give the the explanation or the to show he says for the first seal when you take the the first seal in in Revelation chapter 6 verse 1 and two it said and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I and I heard as it was the noise of the Thunders and of and and of the four Beast saying and I and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer is saying that he was the Antichrist because he was already crowned when Christ is supposed to be crowned by the the the the the Saints when you take that and you go to Matthew 24 verse 4 and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man sedu you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many it said that's Antichrist and he said when you go to the second seal uh uh Revelation 634 uh 6 uh 3 and 4 it says and when he had open the the second seal I heard the second beast saying come and see and then it said they went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that said uh that sat thereon and take the peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword it said when you go to Matthew chapter 24 verse 6 [Music] said and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars so it was the peace that was being taken out you shall hear of wars and rumors of War see that no man troubl see that ye not be troubled for all those things must come to pass but the end is not yet and when you that he took the third seal uh verse five and six uh uh Revelation chapter 6 and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast saying come and see and be and and beheld and lo a black horse and he that said on that said on him had a pair of balance in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the fourth Beast saying a measure of wheat for a panic and three measure of Bley for a penny and see that thou hurt not the oil and the wine it said in Matthew 24 7 and 8 for nation shall rise against Nations and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famine and pestilence over there there was a balance to weigh because there was a famine and here Jesus said there will be famine on the earth and says and all of that will be only the beginning of the birth pain and when he took the fourth seal uh uh verse seven and 8 I'll take eight verse eight and I look and behold a Pale Horse and his name that and and the name that set on him was death and Hell Followed him and power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and and with hunger and with death and with beast of the earth it was it was a a beast and and and the Earth and when we take Matthew 24 verse 9 then shall they deliver you up to to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all the nation for my name's sake he says the fifth seal vers verse 9- 11 and then he says when he had opened the the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony that they they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long lord said those were Marrs there was Souls Under The Altar and when we take Matthew 24 uh 9 to2 we see that there were those that had given their lives verse 10 the Bible says and then many and it says and then shall be many of of uh of offended and shall be betrayed shall betray one another and shall hate one another there were people that are going to betray one another and there will be those that will give their lives for the word and when he came to the Sixth Seal verse 12 and 13 and I beheld when he had opened the six se and L there was a great earthquake and the sun became uh black as sackcloth and the moon became as blood the star of Heaven fell upon the Earth even as a fig tree H casted forth uh um timly fig it said that Jesus spoke about it in Matthew 24 verse 29 it says immediately after the tribulation those days shall the Sun darken and the moon shall not give it light and the star shall fall from Heaven and the power of Heaven shall be shaken the same way and Jesus didn't speak about the seventh seal as it was in The Book of Revelation every uh uh uh uh seals is in the Revelation chapter 6 but Revelation chapter 7 it continu to speak then the seven seal it comes from Revelation 8 uh verse one and when we take Matthew 24 when he opened the seventh seal there was a silence in heaven but says it was the coming of the Lord in Matthew 24 it's verse 36 that Jesus says but for for but of that day and the hour no one knows it says uh no one knows not not even not not the angels of heaven uh not even the son but the father only so sometimes we bring to try to complicate the message when brother Bram he's telling us things in a simple way he he preached God highd himself and revealed himself in Simplicity before bringing big uh great things God has given as Grace to read in the book and to taking the mirror of the message and when we read like Daniel we realize that we are at the end time and what is our attitude what are we supposed to be doing God is inviting us to do like Daniel is to turn ourselves towards the B the word to abandon all the superficial things to to abandon all the things that are not useful to abandon all the distraction and to focus on the word as the musicians are coming my brother my sister like the young Hebrews if we have if we have he have the opportunity to be in church tonight if we have the opportunity to come in contact with this message if we have the opportunity to love this message is because God placed a seed in US Jesus looked at Peter Simon he said Simon Simon Simon Satan claimed you he wanted to sift you like a weed every one of us is like Simon Satan is claiming you so that he may se you like weed but glory be to God because Jesus told Peter I prayed for you that your faith may not fail Jesus prayed for you Jesus prayed for me so that my faith will hold strong that regardless of what the enemy will put on my way regardless of what level uh the the enemy will bring me in that this seed in me I am a son of God there's a true word and even if it come to pass that you find yourself in the most uh difficult situation uh the Bible speaks to us about the parable of the prodical son he said this man had two kids this one who came to his father he said give me my my portion he take his portion of the wealth inheritance the scripture says he went and squandered at all in the things of the world he he found himself in the world to to a point where he didn't have nothing that he was even negotiating pigs food you know when we speak about the nature of pigs it's the the the dirtiest nature the Bible says this kid they plunged thems in a complete wickedness I cannot even imagine what he had to do to be doing doing in the world maybe he committed crimes maybe he did horrible things but in that state the little seed that was in him it says this is not my place I have a father I am a son I cannot continue to find myself in situations like this when I have a heavenly father who's rich in Mercy who's good even if he doesn't receive me as his child I can ask him to just be his servant but I have to go he didn't say well I I I deceived my father what I did it's impossible for me says the only unpardonable sin is the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost when all other sins God provided the sin the the sacrifice for the forgiveness that that may not hold you so you stay there this prodal son he went back to his father when his father saw him he didn't even need that he may even express his repentance he was happy to see him he he he killed a fatter calf he gave him a white road to the point where his brother who is a good brother who had never backslid never a good brother a good Christian you never done this for me him who lost Everything You Killed the fat C the same God is's able is able to do it for each and every one of us to bring us back to the attitude of Daniel you may turn to a a a real relation uh uh relation with them with a true love not a some resemblance of love but real love this morning our pastor talked to us about possessing something that you should be possessing not something that God wants you to possess that but that you must possess and every one of us can go into their heart and ask and and find out if you have it or not and if you don't possess it he said he's going to give it to you because he placed a seed in you so you can desire it not so we can only think about it or or or act like we have it but in doing our inventory said because only perfect love will get in and we are all here so we may enter in we are like Travelers that have taken uh taken off for a destination and we don't want to have trouble at at at the arrival Point may God help us to be like Dan to do like Daniel to come back to prayer that we may claim this possession this love of God this true love because when we read in the book there is no more time as we bow our heads God our heavenly father you know that even I myself I am concerned by this words so I I join together with my brothers I join together with my sisters we want to do like Daniel we want to turn towards you may you forgive our negligence may you forgive our [Music] shortcomings we know that you placed that seat inside of us and you are the only one who can perfect it that's why you've called us tonight that's why you spoke to us tonight and we know that your word cannot come forth and return to you without without accomplishing your your your your desire here we are Lord we commit ourselves we we commit ourselves to you give us your grace give us your true love oh Lord we We Want to Love Like You Lord You prayed for us and that we may remember that before the tomb of Lazareth you said father I know that you hear my prayers and I know that this prayer was already exhausted or was already accepted may may we as the beneficial that the beneficiary of this prayer may it be expressed into our lives oh Father like we heard it this morning that charity may come visible to prove that your love is in us we commit ourselves Lord we commit ourselves to you Lord as we ask you these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let me [Music] see oh I know the time is here where everything that I on me will lay before the holy consum me fire all my works and all my Deeds every pray on my knees will lay before the whole consuming fire all I want to see is Jesus all I want to say is him in me all I want to see is Jesus [Music] might through [Music] me everything [Music] before words of God in his name Healing Hands touch the will L before the holy to fire all I want to see is [Music] Jesus all I want to see is him in [Music] me all I want to see in [Music] Jesus [Music] sh and hearing sa oh God hallah oh my PR oh well done well [Music] now my faith [Music] and all I want to see is [Music] Jesus all I want to see is in me all I want to see is Jus sh [Music] through me amen you know the hour of Prophecy came when Jesus had spoken these words there should not be one stone left upon another and when that hour came there wasn't a Believer left in Jerusalem they have all fled because they recognized the hour that they're there and as our brother admonished us that we can look in the word of God and see the time we're in and it's not going to get easier it's going to be harder and harder and harder to be a Christian and the world's going to make it harder in fact they're going to do all that they can to turn you out and they're going to make it difficult for us to make a living going to make it difficult for us to go to church they they're going to want to take it and turn this into a storehouse they're going to do everything they can to to keep us from going forward and I'd like to say there's going to come a time where we're going to have to live by the promises of God that's right there there's nothing we can turn to we our our minds will fail us of how to figure things out we will be so alienated from the thinking of the world and why they do the things that they do that we'll just di back in amazement in fact our lips will be crying every morning even so come quickly Lord Jesus and there's only one thing that we'll be able to live by and that's by the word of God we'll have to live by these precious promises that he gave us I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you the righteous shall never beg bread I'll provide for you I'll make a way for you you're going to have to King cling so true to this world word be so familiar with it be so lost in it that it becomes your life because he wants no part of you he doesn't want you in his kingdom he doesn't want you in his economy he doesn't want to have nothing to do with you and you better get ready for it we saw it in the great story that was told to us this morning morning how they finally cast them out and they say you were born in sin you are a sinner from begin with uh we are not his disciples and they'll kill you thinking that they're doing God of service they'll kill your influence but as our brother told us tonight Now's the Time well you can to make your commitment to the word of God to separate yourself to purpose in your heart that the Revelation is not going to be secondhand you're not going to get it because it's preached over the pulpit you're not going to get it because you talked about it with somebody but you're going to go find out it for yourself where you personally can identify yourself in the word of God and you can say he's was talking about me I am I am what he said would be and you stay true to it it'll stay true to you amen you stay true to him he'll be there for you no matter how dark the hour is he'll never leave you or never forsake you amen that's the kind of God we serve as our brother told that story about the prod son that made me want to sing that song I have a father amen you have a father I've got a father tonight I lost my natural father my Earthly mother who God's given to me for many years you know she's of the Catholic faith she called the priest to come give her her last rights I think in her own heart she doesn't feel her times long on this Earth I'm beginning to see signs of the many years that she's lived and lived her faith starting to take his toll [Music] and one day my both of my parents will be gone and I appreciate them for bringing me into the world but above it all I have come to find out that I have a father I have another father I have another home and though I've been prodal for lots of my life he Still's made a way for me and

what level of sanctification that you're going to live [Music] out the gates of Mercy I believe are still open for those that hear but one day if you don't move when he speaks pretty soon your ear becomes dull of hearing and everything that's spoken has turned to knowledge and you say I know that I know that I understand that I believe that I've been taught that and there's no more conviction left in the word of God there's no more leadership left in the word of God there's God's no longer speaking to you to get you to do this or to get to that you've just Fallen under the great big blanket of Doctrine and teaching and the gospel you you you live what now what you believe because you've passed up the leadership of the holy spirit so many times you never made that step you never went home and applied that token you never laid down that one thing that meant so much to you as a way of sacrifice and one day all the opportunities have ran out and you're going to be there looking and searching and hungering and the very thing that gives you life has become so common to you that you can't even recognize the life in it any longer the very message that you believe you you don't even see the light in it you it's it's you you already know it oh we don't want to get there church we want to have a tender heart to the move of the spirit we we want to have them poured out and and
