[13:07] [Music]
[13:23] good evening everybody all of the
[13:28] saints that are streaming in and if
[13:31] you're not here in Texas deceiving and
[13:35] watching uh we're under a severe ice
[13:39] storm so our roads aren't very good but
[13:42] we want to thank Brother Joseph for
[13:45] coming out to play for us and braving
[13:49] and putting his life on the line for the
[13:51] gospel we appreciate it and whether
[13:54] Cosman is going to speak for us tonight
[13:56] and thank Matthew for coming out and
[13:59] leading songs and opening in prayer but
[14:01] I like just to make a few announcements
[14:04] uh to our local assembly
[14:06] we want to make sure that when you park
[14:09] in the parking lot that you lock your
[14:12] cars
[14:13] and don't leave any valuables at all in
[14:18] your cards purses wallets laptops
[14:22] uh if you have that please lock them in
[14:25] your trunk
[14:26] uh there's a rash of people driving into
[14:30] restaurant parking lots church parking
[14:32] lots of breaking windows and reaching in
[14:36] uh to cars and grabbing what they can uh
[14:40] we're gonna meet with the deacons so we
[14:42] have somebody patrolling our parking lot
[14:45] to have safety out there so just be
[14:50] careful and when you park and and make
[14:55] sure you lock up your valuables and then
[14:57] remember we try to have a five mile an
[15:01] hour speed limit in the parking lot
[15:03] because we still don't have a a place
[15:06] for our children to play
[15:08] so many times they Dart in and out so be
[15:12] real careful for our children we want to
[15:14] keep them in prayer and also this year
[15:19] because we are in the midst of our
[15:22] building program
[15:24] each of the Louisiana campers this year
[15:29] will have to
[15:31] make arrangements for their own res
[15:36] reservation and
[15:38] transportation so each family or camper
[15:44] you'll have to make your own
[15:46] reservations and transportation
[15:49] Arrangement this year so keep us in
[15:53] prayer we're making progress and we soon
[15:57] hope that all our aspects of it will be
[16:00] complete and we'll be starting to frame
[16:04] the church in so it's going to take your
[16:06] prayers your grace your support or your
[16:09] love and confidence to keep us all
[16:11] through so God richly bless you we've
[16:14] put this service together for you this
[16:16] evening so that we could have this time
[16:19] uh we used to just cancel service and
[16:22] then David Jr came to me I'm not very
[16:24] technical he said Dad we could even
[16:26] stream a tape uh to do something for the
[16:30] people and that really inspired me so I
[16:32] called just a few brothers and said
[16:34] let's just put something on for the
[16:36] people tonight and these wonderful
[16:39] brothers all pitched right in so we're
[16:41] grateful I'm excited to hear Cosman
[16:43] tonight so at this time I'd like to
[16:46] invite brother Matthew to open our
[16:48] service in prayer in just a few songs a
[16:51] little bit of the word this evening and
[16:53] then we'll just Rejoice that God loves
[16:56] us that he's still good and he hears our

[28:36] [Music]
[28:39] God bless you before we just starlished
[28:41] his bow our heads
[28:42] wherever we are
[28:45] Lord we're
[28:49] not worthy to be in your presence Lord
[28:53] but Lord you
[28:55] send your son Lord
[28:57] to be able to give us access Lord
[28:59] tonight
[29:01] Lord where you would be able to come and
[29:03] dine with us Lord in a place like this
[29:07] Lord I know that
[29:09] the weather might try to stop a service
[29:12] maybe the fellowship of a Believers
[29:14] together to come and gather Lord but
[29:16] Lord your word is your word and your
[29:18] word will always remain because you are
[29:21] the same yesterday today and forever and
[29:23] you don't change Lord
[29:25] and so Lord tonight
[29:28] this simple thought Lord it doesn't have
[29:30] to move mountains but it's a simple
[29:31] thought Lord I pray that
[29:33] as we're just fellowshipping upon your
[29:35] word that you would come down in every
[29:37] home
[29:38] and that way you just would Quicken this
[29:41] word to them Lord
[29:43] not my words
[29:46] because it was a message that was sent
[29:48] for a people Lord
[29:50] and Lord we're sitting here in Heavenly
[29:53] places in Christ Jesus
[29:55] Lord with the opportunity of taking this
[29:58] word and feeding upon it Lord becoming a
[30:00] new creature Lord
[30:02] and so Lord I pray tonight as
[30:05] we're just gathered around your throne
[30:07] Lord that you would take all the
[30:09] atmosphere under your control
[30:11] Lord that you would just find comfort in
[30:14] what was said
[30:16] Lord and that you would just encourage
[30:17] us tonight
[30:19] Lord we just blessed for the safety of
[30:21] the people as they're traveling even
[30:24] going back and forth if they have to
[30:26] work or groceries or whatever it may be
[30:28] that you protect them Lord Lord we
[30:30] pleasure your blood upon their lives as
[30:32] the protection Lord that you would just
[30:34] keep them Lord
[30:35] and that you would just be with us daily
[30:38] bless this service bless your people
[30:40] bless the hearers bless me lordly I ask
[30:45] Lord
[30:46] from the bottom of my heart let you just
[30:49] be with me
[30:51] that you just
[30:53] let me move aside Lord
[30:56] concentrate on just speaking your truth
[31:00] Lord I want you to just be present
[31:02] tonight Jesus Christ's name
[31:05] amen
[31:07] God bless you
[31:10] before we sit we're just going to read a
[31:12] scripture
[31:15] for the few that are here we appreciate
[31:17] the support amen
[31:20] so we just want to
[31:24] open our scripture tonight
[31:29] Genesis chapter 6
[31:32] verses 5 through 9 we'll just read that
[31:34] tonight
[31:38] Genesis chapter 6.
[31:41] verses 5 through 9.
[31:44] and it says
[31:48] and God saw the wickedness of man
[31:51] it was great in the Earth
[31:53] and that every imagination of the
[31:56] thoughts of his heart
[31:58] was only evil continually
[32:02] and it repented the Lord that he had
[32:05] made man
[32:06] on the Earth
[32:08] and it grieved him at his heart
[32:11] and the Lord said
[32:13] I will destroy man whom I have created
[32:17] from the face of the Earth
[32:20] both man and Beast and the creeping
[32:23] thing
[32:24] and the fowls of the air
[32:27] for it repented me
[32:29] that I have made them God bless you
[32:31] which is ask a blessing upon the reading
[32:34] of the word you can have your seeds
[32:37] before I get started I just want to take
[32:40] this opportunity to just wish my father
[32:42] happy birthday I know that this is um
[32:44] today is his birthday and so I I didn't
[32:47] give him a present so this would be my
[32:48] present
[32:49] I figured that if I can give him a gift
[32:51] I can I can try to give him the word of
[32:53] God
[32:54] and so I just pray that it's a blessing
[32:56] for him and so if he's the only one that
[32:58] may be benefiting from this praise God I
[33:01] can
[33:01] I could benefit from it too amen
[33:05] um
[33:06] we also want to just think with the
[33:08] David for the opportunity it's just um
[33:10] it's been a privilege for me to just
[33:12] grow under his ministry
[33:14] and just to be able to call myself home
[33:19] um in a place like this and where God
[33:21] has blessed me with the word and the
[33:23] ministry of of Brother Davis so we just
[33:25] want to thank Brother David for that
[33:28] so we read Genesis chapter six and God
[33:31] saw the wickedness of man
[33:34] and it was great in the earth and every
[33:36] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[33:38] was only evil continually
[33:42] and it repented the Lord that he had
[33:44] made man on the Earth
[33:46] and he grieved him at his heart
[33:49] I just want to draw a small illustration
[33:52] because I I I was really moved when I
[33:55] read this when these when I read this
[33:57] few verses but just to draw a small
[33:59] picture
[34:01] in the beginning was the word
[34:04] and the Word was with God
[34:06] and the Word was God
[34:10] so God in the beginning said
[34:13] let there be
[34:15] and there was
[34:17] and everything that was existing based
[34:20] upon that word that was said was obeying
[34:23] God's word
[34:25] and so in the beginning
[34:28] when he created the Garden of Eden
[34:30] something that he actually called
[34:32] perfect
[34:33] something that we can identify with
[34:37] he said let there be
[34:39] and there was
[34:40] Let There Be and there was and so there
[34:44] was an obeying to something that was
[34:46] part of God
[34:48] there was something that was in Union
[34:51] with what God was speaking because there
[34:53] was a recipient on the other side
[34:55] following that didn't matter if he was
[34:57] an animal
[34:57] didn't that it didn't matter if it was
[34:59] whatever whatever the creeping thing
[35:01] that was the fowls of the air the the
[35:04] the creeping things that were crawling
[35:05] including man
[35:07] they were all obeying God's word because
[35:11] he is his word
[35:14] and so in the beginning
[35:16] we realize
[35:18] that
[35:21] we fall into
[35:24] this lust of of our flesh because there
[35:28] was something that happened
[35:30] and what happened was is that there was
[35:32] a disobeying to God's word
[35:34] because he first told Eve he said or
[35:37] actually to Adam he said out of all of
[35:40] this you can eat out of
[35:41] but out of that tree
[35:43] don't eat
[35:45] and so sure enough when the devil came
[35:48] and tried to maybe
[35:51] influence
[35:53] or maybe deceive Eve
[35:56] he
[35:58] disbelieved the word and tried to make
[36:01] Eve believe now he said he said surely
[36:05] so we understand that in the beginning
[36:07] because now God
[36:11] had created something that was perfect
[36:13] and it came to a point where Eve
[36:15] disobeyed God's word it brought this
[36:18] flesh now into a nature of sin
[36:21] it brought this nature into a place
[36:24] where now it was disconnected with this
[36:28] atmosphere of Eternity
[36:30] right because his word is eternal and so
[36:33] because this word is eternal that means
[36:36] that if I did if if if Eve disobeyed
[36:39] God's word now they pulled away from
[36:41] this from this atmosphere that was
[36:43] created for them to rejoice in
[36:47] so brother Branham says this and God who
[36:49] is rich in Mercy
[36:51] he says
[36:53] uh if if I can put maybe just a small
[36:56] thought of what the Lord has placed on
[36:59] my heart you know I I'm you know I I'm
[37:02] not a preacher or anything I'm just you
[37:04] know I I'm not bringing anything new the
[37:06] prophet the prophets talked about all
[37:09] these things
[37:10] but you know it's just the way that I
[37:12] can express of what God placed on my
[37:14] heart and so I hope that you you would
[37:16] be able to follow along but you know the
[37:18] word is the same yesterday today and
[37:20] forever
[37:21] he doesn't change
[37:22] and so if he did it back if he did it
[37:25] one way back then it's only to show us
[37:27] that he is the same and that he word is
[37:30] always present
[37:32] and so God
[37:34] brother bam says in the God who is rich
[37:36] in Mercy in 1965.
[37:39] he's that boy he he that's born of God
[37:42] does not commit sin
[37:46] the worshiper once purged has no more
[37:49] conscience of sin no more desire to sin
[37:53] the sin questions is over
[37:56] you become a part of God in Christ
[38:00] Christ died to redeem you
[38:04] now just think of all this all of a
[38:07] sudden it says now just think of all
[38:09] that we would have been if he hadn't
[38:12] been for God
[38:13] but God in his rich and mercy it says he
[38:19] has redeemed us tonight
[38:21] where we've been tonight is because of
[38:25] his God because of God's Rich mercy upon
[38:29] us
[38:29] it says once the world was so sinful
[38:33] that man had caused corruption to come
[38:36] upon the Earth
[38:38] and it says it even grieved God that he
[38:41] had ever made man
[38:45] the whole head was putrefied sore
[38:49] the whole body
[38:51] and God even grieved that he ever made a
[38:56] man so he said
[38:58] I will destroy man
[39:01] whom have I created
[39:03] he will destroy him because he is
[39:06] nothing but just a bunch of corruption
[39:12] and so as we just continue reading this
[39:15] quote
[39:16] the inspiration of what the Lord put on
[39:18] my heart is a corruptable flesh
[39:22] but an Incorruptible word bride
[39:26] a corruptable flesh
[39:29] because it
[39:33] it actually grieved God
[39:36] at that point
[39:38] that he had created man
[39:40] he says I will destroy man who I've
[39:43] created he will destroy him because he
[39:47] is nothing but a bunch of corruption and
[39:50] the whole human race would have been
[39:52] wiped out at that time but God rich and
[39:56] mercy will not let the innocent perish
[39:59] with the guilty and he went away and
[40:02] provided a way for the ones that wanted
[40:05] to come in
[40:07] that wanted to do what was right
[40:11] he made a way of Mercy for those who
[40:15] desired Mercy
[40:17] and he prepared an ark
[40:20] in other words this is how I love the
[40:22] how the prophet just puts it in
[40:23] Simplicity now he just explained
[40:25] everything that Noah just did in the
[40:27] days of Noah listen to this in other
[40:30] words he put some wings on some Eagles
[40:33] Hallelujah he says that they could fly
[40:36] above the judgment and now drown down
[40:40] with the chickens
[40:42] but he made a way of an escaped in the
[40:45] days of Noah this caused him to do that
[40:49] to provide because
[40:52] he was rich
[40:54] in Mercy
[40:57] and so for God so loved the world
[41:01] that he gave his only begotten word
[41:07] because that's himself
[41:10] that's how he comes
[41:12] and so
[41:14] I want myself to maybe come into
[41:21] just be sincere with myself you know
[41:24] we're not here to um
[41:28] I I I want to be sincere with myself and
[41:30] ask myself the question do I recognize
[41:33] the time that I'm living in
[41:36] do I recognize that time that I'm living
[41:38] in let's take the scripture in Luke 17
[41:41] as we would just continue with the
[41:42] thought
[41:43] I wanted to go over to Luke 17.
[41:48] and just look at the scriptures as we're
[41:50] just moving forward verses 20 to 30.
[41:53] because this is
[41:56] a promise
[41:58] that was given for our day
[42:01] and we know that the prophet
[42:04] goes and explains the ministry of the
[42:06] son of man
[42:07] he shows us in the scripture
[42:11] and so if you want to just turn with me
[42:13] Luke 17
[42:16] verses 20 to 30.
[42:23] and it says and when he had demanded of
[42:27] the Pharisees
[42:33] when the kingdom of God should come
[42:37] he answered them and said
[42:40] the kingdom of God cometh not with
[42:43] observation
[42:46] so the kingdom of God does not come with
[42:51] observation
[42:52] with the visible something that our eyes
[42:55] can try to understand something that we
[42:58] can try to put our own human identity on
[43:01] something that God has created he says
[43:04] verse 21 neither shall they say Lo here
[43:09] and load there
[43:12] making us aware that there's going to be
[43:14] a time where people are going to be
[43:16] telling us look here
[43:18] and look here compare myself with this
[43:21] man compare myself with this man compare
[43:24] myself with something or catching my
[43:27] attraction from something it says
[43:29] neither shall they say Lo here or Lo
[43:32] there
[43:33] for behold the kingdom of God is within
[43:37] you
[43:38] okay verse 22 and he said unto his
[43:41] disciples
[43:43] the days will come when ye shall desire
[43:46] to see one of the days of the son of man
[43:49] and ye shall not see it
[43:52] and they shall say unto you here he goes
[43:55] again
[43:56] see here
[43:58] or see there
[44:00] go not after them
[44:03] nor follow them
[44:07] for as the lightning now this is I love
[44:09] this verse for as the lightning the
[44:11] lightneth out of one part under Heaven
[44:14] shine it unto the other part under
[44:16] heaven so shall the son of man be in his
[44:20] day
[44:21] I'm sure we can all reflect how fast the
[44:24] lightning strike can height can light
[44:26] and just be gone
[44:29] we see the sign
[44:31] and we know that he has passed and we
[44:33] recognized it but he could be so fast
[44:37] verse 25.
[44:39] but first must he suffer many things and
[44:42] be rejected of this generation
[44:45] and as it was in the days of Noah
[44:48] so shall it be in the days of the son of
[44:51] man
[44:52] so now he's given the identity of what
[44:54] happened in the days of Noah
[44:57] it says they did eat
[44:59] they drank they married wives
[45:03] they were given in marriage
[45:06] you see the lustful way of the way this
[45:09] world is
[45:10] as it was in the days of Noah
[45:13] the same
[45:16] was happening in the days of Noah they
[45:18] were drinking they were marrying wives
[45:20] they were given in marriage until
[45:23] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[45:26] and the flood came and destroyed them
[45:29] all
[45:30] likewise
[45:32] also shall it be oh likewise also as it
[45:35] was in the days of law they did eat they
[45:38] did drink
[45:39] they bought they sold they planted they
[45:43] built it
[45:44] everything that's been described in
[45:47] verse 28 it's something that the that
[45:50] man's abilities is trying to accomplish
[45:54] it's something that man's man's desire
[45:58] that are not in the word try to do
[46:03] eat drink bot sold planted they build it
[46:08] but the day that law went into out of
[46:10] Sodom it rained fire and brisnom from
[46:14] heaven and destroyed them all
[46:16] even though shall I be in the day when
[46:19] the son of man is revealed
[46:22] in other words if I can I don't want to
[46:25] substitute the word
[46:27] in other words if I can just express it
[46:29] this way
[46:31] so shall I be in the day
[46:35] when the word is revealed because the
[46:38] word is present
[46:40] the word is the I am
[46:42] and the I am always deals with his with
[46:45] his with his elect for that time present
[46:48] tense we can't go back and look into
[46:50] something that's in history because
[46:52] history only proves to the believer that
[46:55] he is the same yesterday today and
[46:57] forever and that because he was spoken
[46:59] once and it came to pass now we can
[47:02] believe the same thing for our
[47:04] generation and know that it's going to
[47:05] come to pass without a doubt because
[47:09] we have to understand
[47:12] that
[47:13] will I find faith when I come
[47:17] the restoration wasn't of the gifts
[47:20] the restoration was of the faith back to
[47:23] the original fathers
[47:25] and so now God put a word in our
[47:28] generation
[47:30] a word that it may be a lot of people
[47:32] may call Fanatic a word that maybe a lot
[47:35] of people might identify and try to put
[47:37] it with the man a word maybe that we can
[47:40] I would even say that a word that even
[47:45] sometimes we take for granted
[47:47] a word that becomes normal
[47:50] a word sometimes that we just say we
[47:53] don't know the message we say we believe
[47:56] the message we say that we go to a
[47:59] message Church
[48:00] but then the life
[48:02] of the word is not manifested and it
[48:07] becomes just Doctrine
[48:10] brother Branham says the world is
[48:12] falling apart
[48:14] in 1963 says and when God makes a
[48:18] promise
[48:19] and you see it
[48:21] and he tells it and it happens and tells
[48:24] it and it happens and tells it and it
[48:27] happens and it tells it and then it
[48:29] never fails for it's God for the day it
[48:33] says oh feasting on these Heavenly
[48:35] Promises of his promised word for this
[48:39] age knowing with an absolute Assurance
[48:43] of faith
[48:44] that there is a coming of a new heavens
[48:47] and of an earth amen a new heavens and
[48:48] an Earth for this heaven and this Earth
[48:51] will pass away
[48:53] but this new Heaven and Earth Paul said
[48:55] over here in the book of Hebrews the
[48:57] 20th chapter says for we receive a
[49:00] kingdom that cannot be moved how do we
[49:04] get into it not by a religious system
[49:07] but a kingdom of God is within you
[49:13] the kingdom it says the king and his
[49:18] word is the same and it's within you
[49:23] vindicating the hour that we're now
[49:26] living in the promise that God made for
[49:29] this age here we are
[49:31] living with the King sitting in Heavenly
[49:35] places watching him doing these things
[49:38] and now we can he says and now it says
[49:41] how can we turn from the word to some
[49:45] system
[49:46] what does it do
[49:49] it denies the word
[49:52] you have to reject truth
[49:55] before you can have an error
[49:58] this is exactly right do you believe
[50:01] that
[50:02] you have to reject truth
[50:06] like the people of Noah did
[50:09] Noah preached a message 120 years
[50:13] I believe that Noah
[50:16] bumped shoulders with the world for 120
[50:19] years as he was preaching this gospel
[50:21] I believe he was with in the midst of
[50:23] them he was actually
[50:25] testifying of a boat being built
[50:27] something that a lot of people would
[50:30] thought was fanatic how in the world are
[50:32] we going to get rain we're not even the
[50:33] scientists for our day or describing
[50:35] what is rain something that we don't
[50:37] understand how can we have a
[50:39] transformation of our bodies
[50:41] how can we be taken away and be changed
[50:45] and and have this life of this Dimension
[50:47] that we're Longing To Be how can this
[50:49] happen within our life
[50:51] right just wondering and so now Noah
[50:56] never gave up
[50:59] Noah kept preaching the message Noah
[51:02] kept building his ark right
[51:08] brother Branham says this as I'm just
[51:10] continuing I'm trying to draw you know
[51:12] the Lord's just
[51:15] good amen
[51:19] then our it says in Christ is the
[51:22] mystery of God revealed it says then our
[51:24] headship is a kingdom
[51:26] the kingdom of God is within you said
[51:29] the Bible
[51:31] the kingdom it says we're not a
[51:32] denomination we belong to a kingdom
[51:37] and the kingdom is the word of God made
[51:42] spirit and life in our own life
[51:46] bring into pass every promise in this
[51:49] day as it was in the days when the word
[51:52] and God was won and the word and God is
[51:57] one in his church today making it the
[52:00] headship of the body and it says that is
[52:03] redeemed it says that is the redeemed to
[52:07] bring the message in this last day and
[52:09] be taken up from the dead in the
[52:11] resurrection and go back and restore
[52:13] again as Adam and Eve in the beginning
[52:17] In the Garden of Eden the threefold
[52:21] mystery of God his body
[52:25] and so
[52:27] we can go back to the days of lot we can
[52:31] go back to the days of Noah we can even
[52:34] go back to the days of Moses
[52:36] we can use a lot of scripture for for
[52:39] God to show us in his word that he is
[52:42] the same yesterday today and forever
[52:45] but
[52:47] we cannot
[52:50] try to use this word as just something
[52:54] we understand in this human mind because
[52:57] he's greater than that Saints
[52:59] he's greater than that he's Spirit his
[53:01] life he came down himself because a lot
[53:06] of times back in the old in the in in
[53:08] the in the in the in the days of Jesus
[53:10] you know the Pharisees they knew the law
[53:14] they knew the letter
[53:15] they might even know the letter better
[53:17] than me and you
[53:18] and it was so religious it was so it was
[53:22] so
[53:23] by law that the actual life of the word
[53:26] was that was being missed in their life
[53:29] and here's life
[53:31] trying to come show what it is to
[53:35] fulfill God's word
[53:36] shown away shown an example showing the
[53:40] way the word should be
[53:43] Jesus Jesus said himself
[53:47] 1963 God's Gift always finds their
[53:49] places it says Jesus said himself
[53:52] as it was in the days of Noah wherein
[53:54] eight Souls were saved eight Souls
[53:57] out of a generation likened unto this as
[54:01] it was in the days of Noah what was it
[54:03] see great cultured people
[54:07] great workers great Builders great
[54:10] everything they had
[54:12] maybe a civilization just like it
[54:16] great things that were identifying great
[54:19] it says great things
[54:21] that they had
[54:23] and as it was in the days of Noah so
[54:26] will it be coming in the coming of the
[54:29] son of man see God had Noah to identify
[54:33] his promised word
[54:36] and it was very fitting
[54:39] the ark was fitting to the word of God
[54:42] that he spoke that he will destroy man
[54:46] but he saved what he could and so we
[54:49] realized that
[54:50] the Fulfillment of escaping Noah was
[54:54] Noah following God's word and saying
[54:56] that I'm gonna build an ark
[54:58] and it was the actual thing that saved
[55:02] everyone that believed what Noah had
[55:05] preached
[55:07] in the boat
[55:09] you can identify with Noah you can try
[55:12] to say you know Noah you can try to say
[55:14] that oh I I heard new I heard Noah come
[55:17] through my through my town all the time
[55:19] I already know exactly I could repeat
[55:21] exactly what Noah says because it says
[55:23] the same exact thing he says it over and
[55:25] over he says it over and over I know
[55:27] exactly but it's just you know what I
[55:29] just I'm too busy
[55:31] I'm too busy with trying to mirror
[55:34] something that maybe takes away my
[55:37] attention
[55:38] maybe takes away my attention from
[55:40] something that brings me life maybe I'm
[55:43] too rubbing elbows with the world maybe
[55:46] there's something that happens within my
[55:48] life now where I feel like well you know
[55:52] what I haven't read the message for two
[55:54] months maybe I should just keep on going
[55:55] you know maybe I just I like this thing
[55:58] that I'm in right now
[55:59] maybe I feel comfortable
[56:05] what day are we living in Saints the
[56:08] word is open
[56:09] the seals have been opened
[56:12] we have the opportunity to be able to
[56:15] dine with our master and reflect his
[56:18] life by the revelation of this word amen
[56:23] now Noah had to deal with the reproach
[56:25] of his message
[56:28] you know
[56:29] he he was having a deal with the
[56:31] reproach because you know he was saying
[56:34] these people every day and he was
[56:35] preaching a gospel
[56:37] to an unbelieving people
[56:40] he was preaching a gospel to an
[56:42] unbelieving people even though everybody
[56:44] around him noticed that there was an ark
[56:47] being built
[56:48] they were actually watching what Noah
[56:50] was doing and Noah kept preaching the
[56:54] same word because he knew that what God
[56:57] gave him was nothing but thus saith the
[57:00] Lord and he never departed from it
[57:02] because he gave him specific
[57:04] instructions and he said I want this to
[57:08] be this length I want this to be this
[57:10] way I want this to be this way I want
[57:13] everything in order and I want you to
[57:15] get every two of each kind of an animal
[57:17] it was Specific Instructions now if Noah
[57:21] would have gotten away
[57:22] from the word
[57:26] then the ark wouldn't have been able to
[57:28] float
[57:34] as we're moving on
[57:38] but says but now wait in closing we say
[57:41] this
[57:43] to reject God's simple message
[57:48] to reject it God's simple way
[57:51] is to be destroyed eternally
[57:54] now that's how much he says how how we
[57:58] talk how simple it is and people think
[58:01] well they can laugh at it they can run
[58:04] over it they can treat it any way they
[58:05] want to but it's Eternal separation from
[58:09] God
[58:11] it says those who died in the days of
[58:14] Noah
[58:16] did not listen to his message
[58:21] those who died in the days of Noah did
[58:25] not listen to his message
[58:28] and they perished and Jesus went and
[58:32] preached to them in the change of
[58:34] darkness in the death before he rose up
[58:37] he went to hell and he preached to the
[58:40] spirits that was in prison that repented
[58:43] not in the long suffering of the days of
[58:47] Noah while a simple message of God by a
[58:51] simple man was being preached and he
[58:53] said Noah preached that I would be here
[58:56] and here I am
[58:59] the word Here I Am the word
[59:04] and uh and so we understand as the
[59:07] prophet's teaching us here
[59:10] the only ones that were able to actually
[59:12] receive salvation and become
[59:17] a a a a a living soul I can say
[59:22] become quickened was the ones that
[59:25] actually got
[59:27] to listen and and believe what message
[59:30] Noah was saying
[59:32] and it was that that pulled them into
[59:34] this dimension
[59:36] because the ark now was another
[59:38] dimension
[59:39] the ark was now something that they were
[59:42] knowing that they're about to go into
[59:44] and they were believing that God is
[59:48] going to fulfill his promise
[59:51] let's turn to First Peter chapter 3
[59:56] as we're just reading here the scripture
[59:58] that the prophet was referring to
[1:00:03] First Peter chapter 3 verses 18-22
[1:00:18] First Peter chapter 3
[1:00:21] verses 18 to 22.
[1:00:25] for it is better
[1:00:28] if the will of God be so
[1:00:31] that ye suffer for well doing
[1:00:36] than for evil doing
[1:00:39] for Christ also had once suffered for
[1:00:43] sins
[1:00:44] the just for the unjust
[1:00:47] that he might bring us to God being put
[1:00:51] to death in the flesh
[1:00:54] but quickened by the spirit
[1:00:57] by which also he went and preached to
[1:01:00] the spirits in prison
[1:01:03] which sometimes were disobedient
[1:01:06] when Once the long-suffering of God
[1:01:09] waited in the days of Noah while the ark
[1:01:13] was a preparing
[1:01:15] wherein ate wherein few that is eight
[1:01:18] Souls were saved by water
[1:01:20] it says verse 21.
[1:01:24] the like figure unto even the baptism
[1:01:27] does also now save us
[1:01:30] not putting away the filth of the flesh
[1:01:34] but the answer
[1:01:37] of a good conscience
[1:01:39] towards God by the resurrection of Jesus
[1:01:43] Christ
[1:01:45] but the answer of a good conscience
[1:01:49] towards God
[1:01:53] who is gone into heaven
[1:01:55] and is on the right hand of God angels
[1:01:58] and authorities and Powers being made
[1:02:00] subject unto him
[1:02:02] i i i and as I was we were reading that
[1:02:05] verse it just struck me because you know
[1:02:08] when we do something for the love of the
[1:02:11] word
[1:02:11] when we do something because there's a
[1:02:14] life inside of us that just doesn't do
[1:02:16] things for man I'm not just going to do
[1:02:18] things for man to see me that I pick up
[1:02:20] a bucket move it from here to here I'm
[1:02:22] not going to do things because you know
[1:02:24] but there's there's something inside of
[1:02:26] us there's a burden there's something in
[1:02:28] my in our hearts that would be able to
[1:02:30] do things because we know this actually
[1:02:32] brings a satisfaction
[1:02:34] by the word being able to be fulfilled
[1:02:36] in our life
[1:02:40] to live a life with charity for the word
[1:02:44] which is God himself
[1:02:46] will bring a resurrection
[1:02:49] to others around you
[1:02:51] because that's what he did
[1:02:54] as he was living life in the flesh
[1:02:57] as he was letting go of the things of
[1:02:59] the world as he understood even Jesus
[1:03:03] himself
[1:03:04] he was tempted in the word unless
[1:03:06] himself
[1:03:07] and even Jesus himself used the word
[1:03:10] itself to be able to defend him brother
[1:03:13] Branham says he could have used his
[1:03:14] powers
[1:03:15] he could have used all that he had but
[1:03:18] the father had now shown him yet to do
[1:03:21] that so he used the word as the safety
[1:03:28] First Peter Chapter 4 verses I'm sorry
[1:03:31] here's uh uh a quote brother bam says in
[1:03:36] thy house
[1:03:38] now when Christ died
[1:03:40] he committed his Spirit to God before he
[1:03:43] left the cross he said into the hands I
[1:03:47] command my spirit
[1:03:48] and the Bible said that his soul went to
[1:03:51] hell and preached
[1:03:53] that's his conscience and that he was to
[1:03:57] the spirits that was in prison
[1:03:59] and his body went into the grave now now
[1:04:03] see
[1:04:06] this is what the prophet is saying right
[1:04:08] here now see he was behind a barricade
[1:04:12] of scriptures
[1:04:14] he couldn't rise for three days and his
[1:04:17] Spirit went down he says he went back up
[1:04:20] in here in the presence of God and after
[1:04:23] three days
[1:04:24] that barricade was taken down because
[1:04:27] the scripture was fulfilled
[1:04:29] and this and his Spirit went to the soul
[1:04:33] and the soul went to the body
[1:04:36] he rose up he said before he died I have
[1:04:40] power to lay my life down and I have
[1:04:43] power to take it up again
[1:04:45] now the brother Brandon brings it in in
[1:04:47] into
[1:04:48] our day now it says now think of it
[1:04:51] every one of you in here as far as I
[1:04:54] know tonight Christians look
[1:04:57] the thing that is in you now the spirit
[1:05:00] that's in you now it's the same spirit
[1:05:03] that raised you up
[1:05:05] you have power to lay your life down you
[1:05:08] have you're doing it right now for
[1:05:09] Christ it says then you have power to
[1:05:12] take it up again you have power to lay
[1:05:15] down and you have power to take it up
[1:05:17] for it's the very spirit of God that is
[1:05:20] in you that raises you up it was the
[1:05:23] very spirit of God that was in Christ
[1:05:25] that raised him up so you have power to
[1:05:28] lay down and you have power
[1:05:31] to take it up
[1:05:34] First Peter chapter four
[1:05:37] you know
[1:05:39] we have power to lay down our life
[1:05:42] in humility
[1:05:44] being humble
[1:05:46] being able to reflect the image of who
[1:05:48] Christ was
[1:05:50] because we've seen an image that came
[1:05:52] into our generation we sent an image
[1:05:54] that came and lived in our time and
[1:05:56] showed the actual fulfillment of what
[1:05:59] the promise was to take he was the first
[1:06:02] fruit that came among us as mature
[1:06:04] fruits
[1:06:05] and he showed the way he showed exactly
[1:06:08] what the life would be he showed exactly
[1:06:10] what this message would be able to
[1:06:12] produce and now we have it as a image
[1:06:17] which is the image of the word
[1:06:21] and so now
[1:06:23] as God is coming within our hearts by
[1:06:27] the revelation of his word
[1:06:30] it lets go of the world
[1:06:33] and actually receives more of his word
[1:06:37] and his word is his promise
[1:06:40] and his word is life
[1:06:42] and his Lo his word is love and his word
[1:06:46] is peace these are promises that we
[1:06:49] actually have access to and we can
[1:06:51] inherit as part of our inheritance even
[1:06:55] now even in this eating that Satan has
[1:06:58] created say it has created an Eden for
[1:07:00] this generation
[1:07:03] to be able to try to deceive the very
[1:07:06] elected if he would possible
[1:07:08] to try to distract you to try to get you
[1:07:11] in a position where now you're starting
[1:07:13] to disbelieve God's word because there's
[1:07:15] so many lines out there there's so many
[1:07:16] ways that the devil can present things
[1:07:19] there are so many opportunities that you
[1:07:21] can actually try to partake of and now
[1:07:23] if you don't be careful and know the
[1:07:26] revelation of what you stand
[1:07:29] you can be moved
[1:07:30] but the kingdom of God is Not movable
[1:07:33] because that's what Paul said we read it
[1:07:35] earlier Peter I'm sorry it says that the
[1:07:37] kingdom is not movable
[1:07:38] beloved Chapter 4 verses 12-16
[1:07:43] beloved thinking now strange concerning
[1:07:45] the fiery trials which is to try you
[1:07:48] as though some strange thing that has
[1:07:51] happened unto you
[1:07:52] but rejoice
[1:07:54] in as much as ye are partakers of
[1:07:58] Christ's sufferings
[1:08:01] that when his glory shall be revealed ye
[1:08:05] may be glad also with exceeding Joy
[1:08:09] The Life of Christ
[1:08:10] if you be reproached for the name of
[1:08:13] Christ happy are ye
[1:08:15] for the spirit of glory and of God
[1:08:18] rested upon you yes Lord I'll take it
[1:08:24] the spirit of the glory of God rested
[1:08:26] upon you
[1:08:28] and on their part he is evil spoken of
[1:08:31] but on your part
[1:08:34] he is glorified
[1:08:36] but let none of you suffer as a murderer
[1:08:39] as a thief or as an evil doer through or
[1:08:41] as a busy body in other men's matters
[1:08:44] yet if any man suffer as a Christian
[1:08:48] let him not be ashamed but let him
[1:08:53] glorify God on this behalf knowing that
[1:08:57] where you stand on it's not being
[1:09:00] revealed by a man but it's been revealed
[1:09:03] by the word himself coming down through
[1:09:05] a pillar of fire knowing that this word
[1:09:08] would be about to grab you out of this
[1:09:10] Eaton knowing that you're
[1:09:13] house your pest house this prison house
[1:09:17] would try to keep you away from the very
[1:09:20] thing that actually God came to do in
[1:09:22] his to redeem his Spirit bride the one
[1:09:26] that was predestinated the word that was
[1:09:28] actually inside of the Bride
[1:09:31] and so
[1:09:34] brother Branham talks uh in the souls
[1:09:37] that are in prison
[1:09:39] he actually uses the story
[1:09:43] and he's trying to make us understand
[1:09:45] that the actual World we're living in
[1:09:49] has become hell
[1:09:52] because
[1:09:54] he had a vision when he was 14 years old
[1:09:56] I believe
[1:09:58] and I'm sure everybody remembers the
[1:10:00] story he gets shot he goes to the
[1:10:01] hospital
[1:10:03] and as he's out there on the hospital
[1:10:05] bed
[1:10:06] he's seeing himself
[1:10:09] bleeding I believe you know I believe
[1:10:12] there was a lot of blood he was on the
[1:10:14] hospital bed and he was on the he was he
[1:10:16] was there was something inside of him
[1:10:18] that thought he was this is it this this
[1:10:20] was going to be his last opportunity
[1:10:23] and so he goes into a a vision I believe
[1:10:26] or a dream
[1:10:28] and
[1:10:30] he sees this and he says
[1:10:33] I heard a noise sounded like some kind
[1:10:35] of a haunted affair
[1:10:37] and when it was I looked
[1:10:40] coming and it was a woman
[1:10:43] and they had green stuff
[1:10:46] just just could just see their face and
[1:10:50] they had green stuff under their eyes
[1:10:52] and their eyes looked like run back like
[1:10:56] woman today paint their eyes run stuff
[1:10:59] like that it says and their eyes were
[1:11:01] and their face and they're going ooh ooh
[1:11:04] ooh it says oh my
[1:11:07] and that got him
[1:11:09] that had that got him to to say Lord
[1:11:11] take me out of this place and I'll serve
[1:11:14] you the rest of my heart the rest of my
[1:11:16] life
[1:11:17] and so brother Branham brings it later
[1:11:20] down in the same service and it says 40
[1:11:22] years later
[1:11:26] the Lord reveals to him
[1:11:28] the actual
[1:11:30] dream or Vision that our Prophet was in
[1:11:35] and he says
[1:11:40] he wasn't just the penny everybody knows
[1:11:43] the story
[1:11:44] and he catches himself
[1:11:47] where he sees this woman coming off the
[1:11:49] escalator
[1:11:51] and he's just sitting there and he all
[1:11:53] of a sudden he just
[1:11:55] he starts just shaking and and there's
[1:11:57] something inside of him that just says
[1:11:58] Lord could this be is this is this is
[1:12:01] this where
[1:12:03] what happened
[1:12:05] and he catches himself
[1:12:07] in a position where he's like
[1:12:10] am I in hell what is this it brings them
[1:12:13] back to division when he was 14 years
[1:12:14] old
[1:12:15] and he doesn't tell
[1:12:17] sister me to anything and he just says
[1:12:19] honey let's go while you're ready
[1:12:22] and
[1:12:24] he says I got so scared I thought Lord
[1:12:27] surely I haven't died
[1:12:29] and you let me come to this place after
[1:12:31] all
[1:12:33] and there they were making just around
[1:12:35] like that and a vision like you can
[1:12:37] barely hear with your ears you know just
[1:12:40] the the Mumble and going on and the
[1:12:43] people and the woman coming up the
[1:12:46] escalator walking around there oh it was
[1:12:49] that Grim stuff looking looking funny
[1:12:51] stuff around their eyes it says it was
[1:12:52] mournful
[1:12:54] and he said and while I was under that I
[1:12:58] thought of this
[1:13:00] what day are we living in
[1:13:06] what day are we living in
[1:13:09] how we've gotten comfortable
[1:13:12] do we not know that
[1:13:15] this world provides only nakedness
[1:13:19] they're blind they're poor they're
[1:13:22] wretched
[1:13:23] and sometimes we want our image to be
[1:13:25] what the world has because we lack what
[1:13:27] our eyes can see
[1:13:29] and now we try to produce the same thing
[1:13:33] but maybe with the little bit of it's
[1:13:36] okay
[1:13:37] it's okay if I do this and then before
[1:13:40] you know it the little bit turns into a
[1:13:41] little more
[1:13:42] and before you know it a little bit
[1:13:43] turns into a little more more and before
[1:13:46] you know it you just disobeyed God's
[1:13:48] word and now
[1:13:50] you have to find your way back
[1:13:53] you have to get back to the word you
[1:13:55] have to get back to what came in our
[1:13:57] generation you have to came back with
[1:14:00] why the pillar of fire came in this
[1:14:03] generation and what was it to do it was
[1:14:07] to restore a fate to a people where they
[1:14:10] would be able to have their word on
[1:14:11] their lips and have nothing but to say
[1:14:13] it the Lord because what they would
[1:14:15] speak would be nothing but the word not
[1:14:18] what this human flesh could try to
[1:14:19] accomplish or say
[1:14:22] then after now it says brother Braham
[1:14:24] says this now after Jesus had clearly
[1:14:27] came identified himself God identified
[1:14:30] him and he prophesied
[1:14:33] and after the days of his prophecy
[1:14:36] though scripturally identified the
[1:14:38] people rejected him that's right
[1:14:40] he preached then after they rejected him
[1:14:44] here
[1:14:46] the ones that he had a possibility of
[1:14:49] being saved remember
[1:14:52] when he was preaching there was a
[1:14:54] possibility of anybody being saved
[1:14:57] we don't know who they are they're
[1:14:59] predestinated but he continually
[1:15:02] preached
[1:15:03] but in the days of his preaching but he
[1:15:05] says after the days of his preaching his
[1:15:08] ministry continued on because the last
[1:15:10] group he preached to was to the souls
[1:15:13] that were in hell
[1:15:15] that could not be forgiven I I have
[1:15:18] clearly read that from the Bible here
[1:15:20] this it says from second Peter see he
[1:15:23] went and preached to the souls that were
[1:15:25] imprisoned which is Hell locked up until
[1:15:28] the day of judgment because you see the
[1:15:32] Judgment isn't now
[1:15:34] there's no burning hell now
[1:15:36] somebody tell you that guy's in burning
[1:15:39] hell now that's wrong see a judge of
[1:15:42] this Earth is just enough to never
[1:15:45] condemn a man until he's brought to
[1:15:48] trial
[1:15:50] and God will never throw a man into a
[1:15:53] fiery furnace until first he is
[1:15:56] condemned by God's Own laws he rejected
[1:16:00] mercy so you see he first has to have a
[1:16:04] trial and the trial is the white Throne
[1:16:08] judgment
[1:16:09] but now he's in a place
[1:16:12] called a prison house
[1:16:15] and so as it was in the days of Noah
[1:16:20] as it was in the days of lot
[1:16:22] where men drank they ate they married
[1:16:26] they lived life they become comfortable
[1:16:30] but there was a voice that kept coming
[1:16:33] there was a voice that kept speaking
[1:16:36] there was a voice that kept a group of
[1:16:39] people together
[1:16:41] to believe that the promise will come to
[1:16:43] pass
[1:16:44] and it was by that word that the actual
[1:16:47] saving of their souls got to where they
[1:16:51] were on the ark amen
[1:16:54] brother Branham says this
[1:16:59] and Jesus said himself
[1:17:06] as the father sent me
[1:17:09] so send out you
[1:17:12] and as the father sent him to preach to
[1:17:15] the living
[1:17:17] to those who had hope
[1:17:19] and then present the met the same
[1:17:22] message to those who had no hope he
[1:17:25] seems to be fit it seems it seems to
[1:17:26] fitting at this time
[1:17:29] that will have to be done it's just
[1:17:32] because the spirit of Christ Living in
[1:17:35] US does not change the nature of him
[1:17:39] or does it change God's system
[1:17:43] he must be the same in every generation
[1:17:46] he must be the same he said as the
[1:17:50] father sent me
[1:17:52] so send are you
[1:17:55] I wanted to read first John chapter 2.
[1:17:59] just a few verses as we're just winding
[1:18:02] down
[1:18:05] amen
[1:18:11] verses 1.
[1:18:13] 15 through 17.
[1:18:17] because the spirit of Christ
[1:18:20] doesn't change natures
[1:18:23] the word is the same
[1:18:26] the word produces the same atmosphere
[1:18:28] the word for this is the same attributes
[1:18:32] the word produces the same love the word
[1:18:34] produces the same Joy it never changes
[1:18:37] these promises are for every believer
[1:18:40] verses 15 through 17 it says
[1:18:43] love not the world
[1:18:46] neither the things that are in the world
[1:18:50] If any man loved the world
[1:18:53] the love of the father is not in him
[1:18:58] for that for all that is in the world
[1:19:01] the lust of this flesh
[1:19:03] and the lust of the eyes and the pride
[1:19:07] of life is not
[1:19:10] of the father
[1:19:12] but is of the world
[1:19:14] it's what the devil tries to put before
[1:19:16] us
[1:19:17] and the world passeth away and the lust
[1:19:22] thereof
[1:19:24] but he that doeth the will of God
[1:19:28] abideth forever
[1:19:31] and we know that his will is his word
[1:19:33] and he because his will is his word the
[1:19:36] only way as a believer that would be
[1:19:38] able to to to manifest God's word and
[1:19:41] this hour is to be able to be quickened
[1:19:44] by his Revelation daily
[1:19:47] every day we must be sitting in God's
[1:19:49] word for him to come and reveal his word
[1:19:51] in our hearts
[1:19:54] the Ministries might be must be the same
[1:19:56] and so much he said I see some of you
[1:19:59] writing scriptures down it says he that
[1:20:01] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:20:03] shall he do also see the works
[1:20:08] brother random says the works in
[1:20:10] quotation marks and it says preaching to
[1:20:13] the lost if I can say
[1:20:15] testifying to the Lost
[1:20:18] witnessing to the Lost
[1:20:21] preaching to the Lost
[1:20:23] Healing The Sick
[1:20:25] and then to the impossible to ever be
[1:20:29] saved see the work went on just the same
[1:20:34] so this has been hasn't has it been
[1:20:38] may I put it like this
[1:20:41] the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:20:43] reincarnated in the church in this last
[1:20:46] day
[1:20:47] that's what many of us believe I believe
[1:20:50] with you I believe this
[1:20:53] if I didn't believe it I I'll do
[1:20:56] something else about it because after
[1:20:58] all this is me he says it's me and here
[1:21:01] concerned
[1:21:02] and if the spirit of God be in you
[1:21:06] you're concerned about the people
[1:21:10] you're concerned about lost souls
[1:21:13] there's something inside of you that
[1:21:15] just wants to reflect the image of God
[1:21:17] where you would be able to just be so
[1:21:20] sensitive to the spirit where we can
[1:21:22] start the start dining into this
[1:21:24] dimension of a spiritual mind where now
[1:21:27] we're partaking of these promises of
[1:21:29] this land and the more that we're
[1:21:31] actually partaking of this promises that
[1:21:34] were we're inheriting that the ones that
[1:21:36] were actually were for us from the
[1:21:38] beginning now we're starting to show
[1:21:41] another atmosphere
[1:21:43] because
[1:21:44] we're not of this world
[1:21:47] we're not living in this world to say
[1:21:49] that we're living in this world we're
[1:21:51] strangers and when you're a stranger you
[1:21:53] act strange
[1:21:55] when you're a stranger you talk strange
[1:21:57] when you're a stranger people look at
[1:22:00] you like you're strange and you know
[1:22:02] what the elect that sees the strange
[1:22:05] that they can identify with they'll grab
[1:22:07] a hold of it and now they'll know that
[1:22:10] there's something that's different
[1:22:11] because the scripture says no man speak
[1:22:13] like this man before
[1:22:16] who is he to bring the word the way he
[1:22:19] did and to try to tie up all these Loose
[1:22:21] Ends but it was the voice of the seventh
[1:22:24] angel that came in this generation by
[1:22:26] the appearing of a pillar of fire that
[1:22:29] actually brings a quick and Empower to
[1:22:32] the seed and would be able to draw the
[1:22:36] rest around them
[1:22:37] because one Resurrection brings another
[1:22:40] resurrection and and and and and it just
[1:22:43] multiplies
[1:22:46] brother Branham says this
[1:22:49] in the maps Masterpiece as I'm just I'm
[1:22:51] just closing if we can just stand maybe
[1:22:53] the musicians can come as we're just
[1:22:56] closing at this time
[1:23:02] brother bam says this and and a
[1:23:05] masterpiece it says
[1:23:07] Lord Jesus
[1:23:10] thou the fountain
[1:23:12] inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[1:23:14] it says flow through us today
[1:23:18] Lord and cleanse us from all unbelief
[1:23:22] and all sin
[1:23:25] that we might stand in thy presence now
[1:23:29] knowing that there is a need Among Us
[1:23:33] we know that we are sinners and not
[1:23:36] worthy of any blessing
[1:23:38] but then
[1:23:39] when we think of him who came and took
[1:23:42] our sins
[1:23:43] and when his blood's there and it's not
[1:23:47] us and the presence of God it's him
[1:23:51] just our Voice through his blood he's
[1:23:55] blood speaking o God then cleanse our
[1:23:59] hearts from sin and unbelief
[1:24:02] give us the desires of our heart for we
[1:24:06] truly have these desires to serve you
[1:24:10] in these in this Awakening conditions
[1:24:13] and afflictions and things of the world
[1:24:17] that's put Upon Us sometimes to perfect
[1:24:20] us
[1:24:22] the trials
[1:24:26] we've been told that he said think
[1:24:29] enough strange that these they can think
[1:24:33] of now strange that these trials come
[1:24:35] they're only working for our good and to
[1:24:39] perfect us and bring us into that place
[1:24:44] these great deserts of experience where
[1:24:48] righteous men are being molded into
[1:24:51] Saints we thank thee for these
[1:24:53] experiences Lord
[1:24:55] we would no mean no wise want to
[1:24:57] anything contrary to your will but we
[1:25:00] pray father
[1:25:03] that in this
[1:25:04] will be brought closer to you
[1:25:09] and when the burdens are so heavy and we
[1:25:13] can't go no further says then we write
[1:25:16] it says we raise our hands and scream to
[1:25:19] our father then hear us Lord
[1:25:23] make us well for this kingdom of God
[1:25:31] Lord as we just close
[1:25:37] maybe if you're just sitting at home and
[1:25:45] we come to our identity of
[1:25:48] being an ego in a chicken yard
[1:25:51] and I've
[1:25:53] bumped elbows with these chickens long
[1:25:55] enough
[1:25:57] maybe it's time to
[1:26:00] start storing My Wings
[1:26:02] start dwelling in Heavenly places in
[1:26:05] Christ Jesus
[1:26:07] where I can have mother Eagle come speak
[1:26:09] to me
[1:26:13] it's hard enough to just be able to look
[1:26:16] down and
[1:26:18] try to look at this flesh and what it
[1:26:20] tries to do and how it tries to pull you
[1:26:22] away from the word and how it tries to
[1:26:24] drag you to the right and to the left
[1:26:26] and it says look here and look here and
[1:26:28] pay attention here Lord sometimes so
[1:26:31] much confusion
[1:26:33] but Lord you send a word that would
[1:26:34] never fail
[1:26:36] Lord you send away that you would never
[1:26:38] let us depart from knowing that whatever
[1:26:41] this flesh would try to do if it's not
[1:26:44] according to thy will if it's not
[1:26:47] according to Thy Word
[1:26:48] I don't want it Lord
[1:26:52] we were tired of just being able to just
[1:26:54] feel comfortable in this world
[1:26:58] going places and not even testifying or
[1:27:01] maybe bring in the word of the Lord in
[1:27:03] an atmosphere
[1:27:06] we're atmosphere creators and the only
[1:27:09] way you can create an atmosphere is by
[1:27:11] his word
[1:27:13] and as you're bringing this word with
[1:27:16] this nature around a seed that maybe
[1:27:20] could pull back and understand that they
[1:27:23] have hope
[1:27:24] oh what a rejoice
[1:27:27] Lord as
[1:27:29] you know
[1:27:33] we're not here I'm not here to hide
[1:27:35] anything Lord I'm as sincere as I can be
[1:27:40] Lord we just thank you for this goodness
[1:27:43] we thank you for your word
[1:27:45] Lord I was once lost
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:50] the life that was lived
[1:27:55] that showed the way of this message Lord
[1:27:58] got me interested and
[1:28:04] as you're just listening to this voice
[1:28:07] Lord it just molds you into this image
[1:28:10] Lord
[1:28:13] Lord it was a seed that brought forth
[1:28:15] another seed
[1:28:17] and so Lord you know my desire tonight
[1:28:19] is to get closer to you
[1:28:23] Lord to get closer to your word to be
[1:28:25] able to dwell in Heavenly places in
[1:28:27] Christ Jesus
[1:28:28] Lord we're just so thankful for what you
[1:28:31] have done for us so far your grace and
[1:28:33] your mercy your blessings Lord your your
[1:28:36] word Lord if it wasn't for your word
[1:28:38] where will we have been Lord
[1:28:40] and if it wasn't for you to come Lord
[1:28:43] and bring
[1:28:45] a prophet in our generation to show the
[1:28:48] way the truth and the life
[1:28:51] Lord we're such a privileged people to
[1:28:54] know what this message produces
[1:28:57] Lord I just pray Lord that if there is a
[1:29:00] desire out there I know that a lot of us
[1:29:02] are home and maybe we're just not
[1:29:04] in a church service but God can come to
[1:29:07] you even right there
[1:29:09] Lord I pray that if there is a heart
[1:29:11] that's seeking for you
[1:29:13] it's worth a thousand worlds ten
[1:29:15] thousand worlds a million worlds Lord
[1:29:18] Quicken your words from Lord
[1:29:21] to know that there's nothing
[1:29:25] but the word and it's the word himself
[1:29:28] that comes personal
[1:29:30] to you
[1:29:32] individually and will bring forth life
[1:29:36] we thank you Father for your goodness
[1:29:39] we just commit the rest of the service
[1:29:42] and the rest of the evening and our
[1:29:45] homes and where we are into your hands
[1:29:48] in Jesus Christ's name
[1:29:50] amen

[1:31:10] Bride of Jesus Christ which is the word
[1:31:11] of God
[1:31:13] is incorruptible
[1:31:15] I like that quote he read
[1:31:18] you know
[1:31:20] he mentioned how everything in the
[1:31:21] beginning had to
[1:31:23] obey God's word there was an
[1:31:25] intelligence by law
[1:31:27] the prophet of God said eve by
[1:31:29] misbelieving one word
[1:31:31] caused everything to fall
[1:31:34] and the prophet said do you think you'll
[1:31:35] get by with misbelieving with one word
[1:31:37] he said how are we ever going to get
[1:31:39] back
[1:31:40] how we ever going to get back
[1:31:42] God sent a message
[1:31:45] to reveal every spoken word of God
[1:31:49] we're living in that hour I like the
[1:31:50] quote I wrote it down brother Branham
[1:31:53] said he put some wings on his Eagles
[1:31:55] how did he do it there's an old saying

[1:32:01] Wings on an angel I tell you this
[1:32:05] message came to But Wings on the Bride
[1:32:07] of Jesus Christ your predestinated seed
