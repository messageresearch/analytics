We have a new request up here from Sister Rachel Bernett. Right. Please keep William in prayer. He has another uh sonogram on his kidney on Wednesday morning. Amen. I believe we serve a healing God this tonight. And [music] Amen. We could certainly uh take [snorts] that to prayer and know that our God will touch the little one and make him well. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a testimony from [music] um David Kingong writes um the King Congo family wants to thank God for his healing tight hand and uh we've seen him move mightily this week for us. Amen. We thank God for that. Amen. Also, uh a couple announcements. Don't forget this there's no Sunday school next next [music] week during the meetings. Um, we want to uh also just remind all that the meetings are starting on Friday and we still have our Wednesday service. The [music] meetings are starting on Friday and want to make an effort to be there 700 p.m. Uh Saturday [music] the fellowship 12 to 300 p.m. Uh Sunday at 6:00 p.m. [music] Sorry, Saturday 6:00 p.m. Sunday morning at 8:00 a.m. Sorry, 11:00 a.m. and [music] 6:00 p.m. for that singing service. So don't show up at 8:00 a.m. Sunday. Sorry about that. [music] Um, we're going to be be praying for that that the Lord will come in. Amen. How many you love the presence of the Lord? There's nothing like his presence. [music] His word is a reality to those that believe. I believe we'll come packed in and I believe we'll bring our needs and we'll come and worship him and and amen the word and he will take care of all those needs. We we take our time. We invested in him. we get a dividend. Our sins and everything else is taken care of. That's the kind of God [music] we serve. Amen. We uh remind the young people to try to carpool it when possible and to try to [music] park in the back. Amen. Also, the bathroom situation. [music] The sister's bathroom is still shut down. So, if you can use the one in the uh fellowship hall and the uh over there, that would be um very helpful. will try to get that done and finish up as soon as possible. Want to remember our pastor, brother David, sister Leslie in Arizona. Pray that they'll be back tomorrow. So we pray that the Lord will give them traveling mercy. Uh but I think brother [music] Paul is with them. Brother Matthew is out preaching. So I want to remember him, that the Lord will bring himself home. [music] And all of those that are not here, we want to remember them. Amen. Do you have a need on your heart tonight? [music] Amen. And there was a testimony I heard brother David Jr. give. I'll just invite him to come and [music] give that and then uh pray for the over the request the brothers that are taking the request uh the offerings if you can come. [music] Amen. I guess the scripture says, "Let others speak well of you." But I think you could remember when brother David was given his testimony about the car. And uh how he had pulled over on the side of the road and the best I would say, I'm pretty sure the Lord did the miraculous. He probably was running a car without oil and it sounded like your engine was probably froze up, not the transmission, but you were testifying to what the Lord did and a brother Timothy Miller was watching that and they were in the middle of their own trials with their car and it wasn't they they're having car trouble and they wanted me to just pass on at that time and I even shared it how much they appreciated the testimony and uh and I could even just kind of read that But he uh and I might as well said, you know, this is the confidentiality of text messages nowadays. They end up on the internet. Brother David, yesterday morning at your church, a young brother gave his testimony about his car. While I was shampooing carpets, I had been listening to Revelations chapter 4, part three after turning on yesterday's morning service and heard his testimony. We've been going around and around with vehicle issues. Please tell him what a blessing his testimony was to me. Absolutely. We passed that on. And last night, he sends this yesterday morning. He said, "Last night, my boss wanted Ashley and I to come over to talk with him and his wife. When we got there, this was in his driveway." And he said, "Merry Christmas." And he shared a picture of a minivan. And uh you know, you just trust God, he's got the answer. You give him the glory. And you know, he he's mighty on our behalfs. And I think just with that and these needs that have been spoken, we can just go to the Lord and bring him in prayer. And the testimony is is I know a provider. &gt;&gt; He knows what we have need of and he'll supply above what we can ask or think. And inside of you is the power to ask and to testify and and uh receive what you have need of. And let's just go before him. Gracious heavenly father, how thankful we are to come to a heavenly father. Lord, who knows what we have need of before we could ask. Lord, and we don't come with merit. We have nothing to bring. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. We're simply recipients of unmmerited favor and grace. Lord, a price that's been paid that's complete. [music] Calvary accomplished it all. It's accomplished redemption in our body, Lord, [music] in in our spirit that we could sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. We've simply been made participants [music] of something you've purchased, Lord. And we want to come with confidence in that, Lord. The price wasn't paid in vain, Lord, but you told us to come boldly before the throne of grace and bring our petitions that we could receive, Lord. And we're asking for great things, Lord. That those who sit in darkness and bound in darkness, their eyes would become open, Lord, to see you in the power of your resurrection, Lord. The needs in the body, Lord, that they healing would be manifested, Lord. We thank you for your contining [music] continued healing touch on Lucas, Lord. Father, to see us smile, to see him up and moving, Lord, we ask you to just continue to heal him, Father. Lord, the needs that were spoken, the tests that are to come, Lord, we're looking to you and your promises, Father. Even now, tonight, Lord, may each one just become aware of your presence. [music] Lord, as you would come, soften the hardest of hearts, Lord. May your presence just prepare the ground, Lord. thankful hearts giving you grace, praise and thanksgiving, Lord, just to even be here in your house tonight. May our worship be pleasing to you, Father, Lord. And as your word comes, it'll accomplish that which you've sent it. We give you the praise, Lord, committing it to you. Thank you for this privilege once again to bring our request before you. [music] We love you, Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Oh, it's already done. It's [music and singing] already done. Oh, and a battle is over. Oh, and a victory [singing] is won. It's already [music] done. It's already done. [music] It's already [singing] done. [music] It's already [singing] done. Oh, the [music] battle is over. Oh, and victory [singing] is won. [music] Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm already here. I'm already here. [music] I'm already [music] here. [music] Oh, the battle is over. Oh, and the victory [music] is [singing] won. I'm already here. Oh, I'm already seeing. I'm already [music] sing. Hallelujah. Oh, [music] and I aren't you glad for the revelation tonight. [music] Oh, and the battle is Oh, and victory. I'm [music and singing] already Oh, and my family. My family. [music] Oh, my family is here. [music] Oh, the battle is over. &gt;&gt; Oh, and the victory [music] is won. Oh, it's already done. [music] It's already [singing] done. Oh, and it's already [singing and music] done. Oh, [music] and the battle is over. Victory. [music and singing] Hallelujah. Amen. Sister Jun has a special voice. Amen. God bless you. Just singing my favorite song again. So sing it with me. There is a blood that cost a life [singing] that paid my way. death its price. When it flowed down [singing and music] from the cross, my sins were gone. My sin [singing] [music] forgot. There is a grave that tried [music and singing] to hide this precious blood that gave me life. But [singing] in three days he breathed [music] again and rose to stand in my [singing] defense. [music] So I come to tell you he's alive. [music and singing] to tell you that he dries every [singing] tear that falls. So I come to tell you that he saves, to [music] shout, and [singing] to proclaim that he's coming back for you. There is a blood that [singing] sightes the blind. It heals the sick, [singing and music] the lonely find. [music] It has the power to [music] free the bound as chains they fall [singing] upon [music] the ground. So pour it out to cleanse [music and singing] my soul and let his liquid [music] glory [singing] flow because it lives to make me [music] whole. I [singing] owe my life. I owe my all. [singing] [music] So I come to tell you he's alive. [music and singing] To tell you that he dries every tear [music and singing] that falls. So I come to tell [singing] you that he [music] saves, to shout and to proclaim that he's [music and singing] coming back for you. This life, [music] this price, [singing] this blood, this one, this [singing and music] life. He paid. He paid the price with precious blood. [music] There is a grave that tried [singing] to hide [music] this precious blood that [music] gave [singing] me life. God in three days. [music] He [singing] breathed again and rose to stand [music] in my defense. [singing] [music] So I come to tell you he's alive. to tell you that he dries [singing] [music] every tear that falls. So [singing and music] I come to tell you that he saves to shout and to [music] proclaim [singing] that he's coming back for you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That blood will never lose his power. &gt;&gt; A man who forgives past, present, and future sins. It's taken care of all of it. There's no sin question anymore. He's completely taken care of it. Oh my. If we can only believe what he promised and stand by what he said, amen, it will come to pass. Amen. Let's all stand at this time. Let's sing that song, Our God Reigns. As we get ready to invite Brother Andrew at this time, I believe it's a Amen. A lonely [singing] arber [singing] [music] [music] good news. Oh, oh, [singing] I now sing peace. Oh, [music] and proclaiming news of happiness. [music and singing] Oh, and I got grace. [music] Oh, I [singing] got [music] Oh, [music and singing] I got Father God, [music] I got you [music] sing it as your father this time. Oh, and I [music] got you. Oh, [singing] and he came with [music] grace and majesty. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh [music] Jesus. [music] God loves us. [music] He is. Yes. [music] [music] He's [music] [music] the Jesus. [music] Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful he's alive? [music] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad to be here tonight and be in fellowship with you once again and to think about this morning's service. So my what a refreshing moments in time that God can come by our way and strengthen us to give us that understanding that we have a resource. We have a source of life. Amen. We just want to follow right behind our brother and maybe just have a few minutes uh fellowship. It probably won't be long, but we just want the Lord to have his way and we want the Lord to be able to deal with our hearts where we're at in our season. He's the only one that can do that. Amen. God is the only one that can know exactly what your need is. Amen. I believe I need more of him. How many would agree with me tonight and say, "God, speak to me because it's you that I need." Amen. [music] Let's go to the Lord together in prayer. Our precious heavenly father. Lord, here we are, Lord. Testimonies and songs have gone forth, Lord. And it's our earnest desire, the Father, that you would once again come. And Lord, you'd make yourself known, oh God, and you've chose this way by the foolishness of preaching, Lord, that we can, oh God, receive from you. [music] And so, Father, you see the needs and the desire upon your children. Father, we just we ask that you would meet it. Lord, meet the need, Lord, that when we leave here, Lord, they can have a greater assurance of what they have in you, Father. Lord, I need you, Lord. You see my heart, Lord, how I, oh God, long, oh God, to just give this time to you and that you would, oh God, magnify it and let it be food in season for your people. as we humbly ask oh God that you would take control from beginning to end for the upbuilding of [music] your kingdom. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. While you're standing, if you want to turn with me in the book of Romans, we'll read um chapter 8. Just wanted to share this thought about the source of my life. And by the end of the service, I want it to be the source of our life. &gt;&gt; We have a source of life. Amen. In Romans chapter 8 and verse 5, it says [snorts] [clears throat] and I'll wait you until you get there. And you can say amen if you get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture says, "For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is at immity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." So they that are in the flesh cannot please God. Oh my. Just to think tonight we want to be here and please God. Amen. And it has to be by revelation. Amen. That's what we're looking to to God to give us revelation. But ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit. &gt;&gt; If so be that the spirit of God dwelleth in you. Now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. But if Christ be in you, oh my, tell me a little bit more. If Christ be in you, now this is you. You put yourself here. If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin. But the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's there you are again. That's you. My Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not of the flesh to live after the flesh. For if we live after the flesh, you shall die. But if through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Amen. Ain't that wonderful? You may have your seeds. My just to think that, you know, in the word of God, it has made known the plan of God. It's made known redemption. It's made known that God had a predestinated plan and you were in his mind. You were in his thinking. And he so rigged the plan of God that he would place a part of himself in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I think that's wonderful to think that you went in your life. I went in my life. I had a course in which I was led by my flesh and it always led me into death, which is separation from God. My flesh always got me in trouble. Whenever I let my flesh and my own carnal desires, they led me astray. They led me into prisons. They led me into sickness. They led me into heartaches. They led me into sorrows. But oh my, thank God that there's something on the inside that's leading me to another source. It's a source of real life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, just to think that God wanted to have a contrast in our lives to know that we know that the life that I now live. It's not because only the the power that I have. You have a power. &gt;&gt; It's the power of your decision. &gt;&gt; If you're going to let your mind just continue to rule your life, it's a decision every day. &gt;&gt; Every day. Are we going to look to God and say, "God, I want your will to be done. Not my will, but thine be done." There's a power inside of the seed that can mortify the deeds of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; It's something to get excited about because not everybody in this world will give their self over to it. There's a conviction. There's a desire. Oh, I want to know what truth is. But the moment that God starts opening up truth to them, they say, "I don't want that. That's not for me." But oh my, just to think that God planted something in you that you wanted God. &gt;&gt; You wanted to serve God. You wanted to do what's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But there's that great contrast. My And I got to thinking as a brother said, "Oh, you know, when you look back in your life and you see where you come from, you see what God brought you out of." Oh, it made my heart start beginning to weep. I'm like, if I start getting tore up like that, I'm not going to be able to say anything to you. I'm just going to be rejoicing and weeping cuz what God has done for me. Oh, well, he took me from the bondage of self. Oh, I thank God for the the deliverance from self. And every day I have grace to put him to bed. Put it not just to bed, but put him to death. I can crucify this old flesh and say, "It's not me that liveth. I can preach this gospel to my flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I love that. You know, the scripture says there, as many as are led by the spirit, they are the sons of God. Thank God that he put something on the inside that thirst for the righteousness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have the power to yield our members to righteousness. It's just as simple as what we did when we yielded oursel over to go to school and try to have good success and all of the sudden we're making decisions and it's keeping us out of church. I know what it's like when God first healed my body. I thought, "Oh, you know what? I missed all of my high school years." Well, two of them. And um I thought, "God, you supernaturally healed me. They need to know the, you know, I need to be a witness for those in the professional world. I'm going to be an athlete. I'm going to go out there and I'm going to let them know, you know, uh, you know, this is a a talent that can't go unnoticed and unrecognized. I can be there for the world. &gt;&gt; And you know, the thing is is God heals us and he gives us of his his power &gt;&gt; and we become a partaker of the fruit of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But oh my, I didn't realize inside of me it was going to be like a stuffed shirt. &gt;&gt; Oh, but thank God for conviction because I tell you, I was missing church and you know, I was putting a lot of pressure on my wife and things like, oh, it's just going to be a little bit longer. Don't worry, there's a payoff and all this kind of stuff. But oh my, thank God for conviction because God spoke to my heart and he said, you're doing that for you, not for me. Oh my. How many times do we do things for us &gt;&gt; and we try to put a religious spin on it? We're all guilty. But thank God that there's a desire to serve God in truth and righteousness. &gt;&gt; Not my will be done but thine. Oh, I think it's a good time to continually search our heart and say, "God, try me. &gt;&gt; Search me. See if there be any wicked way in me. Show me what's leading me." That's right. &gt;&gt; My, you know, there's a lot of times that we want to do right, but we can't be divided trying to serve mammon and trying to serve God. We need to make a clear-cut decision for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We really want to run to that source of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; My Oh, I think about it. You know, Jesus gave us the example. You know, he showed us the way of life. He says, "I can do nothing in myself. I'm going to show you that I have a source. My father is my source." The word of God, the eternal plan of God, you know, he put that in the seed that's in each and every one of us. The plan of redemption, the plan of God, he actually, you are the very manifestations of the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. in your world, &gt;&gt; the very situations and seasons that we're in. &gt;&gt; It's to declare the same God, the same power to heal, to save, to redeem, to give comfort. &gt;&gt; I mean, there's so much to be said when you're in a trial, when you're in a difficulty, and someone would say something, it was a sweet as honey, &gt;&gt; you know, uh it's like a food in due season. I was thinking on the way to church this morning, I was driving. My wife and I drove separate and I was like, you know, that's all right. We I was going and I witnessed a little fender bender. Normally, I would just keep going. I would just keep going. But sons of God are led by the spirit of God. Every single day, we have an opportunity to make a difference in someone else's life, &gt;&gt; you know. And I could have just said, "Well, I'm going to be late for church." Who wants to be late for church? I don't I hate being late for church. I'd rather be there 20 minutes early, sit there by myself, but I want to enter in. Amen. But so I I witnessed this thing and I was going to just keep going on and something in me just said, you know, go ahead and pull over. And well, I'm so thankful that I did because I met a couple, an elderly couple, and another woman. She was an exchange student and you know it wasn't that big of a deal to me so much but this mean everything. Come to turn out that the man it wasn't his fault. Someone pulled out and kind of rolled in and uh this woman she she's an exchange student and uh I don't know what she was thinking but she was at fault and she was just driving on like nothing was going on. just like just kept driving. And I pulled up to the light and I looked over at her and she was looking at me and I said, "You need to pull over." And normally I wouldn't get into that business. That's not my deal. I'm not a policeman, you know? I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to get somebody on the hook, right? So I'm uh she pulls over and then the guy he had this badge on his on his chest, the guy that got ran into and he was he said he was 76 years old. And I got to thinking, you know, that could be my dad or it could be our pastor. And all of a sudden, this man, he had a badge and it said chaplain. And I was like, oh my boy. And he was wound tight. He was I mean, he was talking so fast his dentures were flying out back and forth. I was like, "Wow." I'm not trying to be funny, but I was looking at him going, "Wow, slow down." He had this bag that had a bunch of cords on it, and I didn't notice it at first, but I was just like, "Hey, calm down. Calm down." And he was giving her the what for and telling her everything. And I was like, "Hold on a minute." And this poor girl, you know, she's an exchange student and here she is. I'm like, "Hey, you know, let's let's just let's just deal with this. You know, it's an accident. It's a fender bender. Are you hurt? Nobody's hurt. You know, let's calm down." And so, all of the sudden, we just kind of let them know, hey, this is all going to work out. Look at your car, see the car, just get, you know, do the exchange, get your phone numbers and different things. To make a long story short, you know, I feel like the outcome would have been a whole lot different if I didn't stop. Seriously. and it gave me the opportunity to witness to him. &gt;&gt; I told the chaplain after a while, you know, he he began to realize his condition. They were like, "Whoa, I'm sorry. I'm wrong." You know, but this took about 15 minutes and but the Lord provided such a sweet opportunity, you know, to to pray for them and just to, you know, I asked the young lady, she looked like she was from India. I said, you know, I said, do you know that uh you know God loves you? You know, and uh you know, you you know that God allows difficulties and challenges because he's he's pursuing you. You know, he wants to come into your heart. He wants to come into your life. Do you know that's the truth? She looked at me. She's like, I didn't know that's the truth. She wanted to know truth. And sometimes in difficulties and struggles and hardships and things like that, that's when we come to know the Lord. &gt;&gt; And God has witnesses and ambassadors on earth today. &gt;&gt; But I don't want to be so mindful that I'm just looking ahead at [clears throat] my next success or my next business venture or my next accumulation of something that's perishable. But I want my name to be identified with somebody that has repented, &gt;&gt; that has come into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to have a little sensitivity now of what's leading me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just to think that, oh, this this dear child has no idea that there is a blood that has been shed for all mankind that if she would just accept it by faith, she can become a new creature. She doesn't have to wear those pins in her ears. She doesn't have to dress the way she does. She doesn't have to believe in an idolatrous deify God and all this kind of stuff like some works is going to save her. My we have a treasure. We have a resource. The blood has cleansed the vilest of sinners when it cleansed us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love that? You know, to think that we've been invited to shape and mold our character to Christ every single day. We've been given opportunity to shine forth the light in this hour. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a privileged people we are. &gt;&gt; To think that by the power of our decision, we don't just we're not just the average Joe going to work. We're not just the average Joe going to school because there's a source on the inside. If we can ever take our eyes off our faults and failures and realize inside of us is a well of living water. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a fountain of joy that can spring forth at any time. What has God done for you? &gt;&gt; I want to tell somebody what's God's done for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My Well, I'm aiming really hard not to look at my notes, but there's the scriptures I wrote down. But praise God. You know, you think about how that one of the keys to the believer is to look at our leader, to look at our guide. We're not the leader. We're followers. We have a shepherd. We have a source of life. Amen. And so many times we we want to revisit and say, "What kind of character did our Lord have?" you know, the great creator. My when I think about it, when brother Brenn was uh ministering on Wednesday, oh my heart was so touched. You know, I I believe this with all of my heart that when God gives you revelation like fresh revelation, brother Billy said, it actually produces the work the greater works. my and to think that when God gives us revelation, we become a new creature in that moment. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I just feel like as brother Ben was ministering and reading down on that quote and I I got to thinking about blind Barnameus and how blind Barmus, you know, he had a a service that he did for God and it wasn't just a works program. It was real faith. You know, he had those turtle doves. Brother Brandham talked about those turtle doves was his only way of actually income, &gt;&gt; right? But he began to feel there was something on the inside that wanted just more than that. &gt;&gt; I just believe that with all my heart that God put a thirst in brother blind barus and all of the sudden he said, "You know what? [clears throat] I believe I got a source that's greater than this natural provision and I'm going to go ahead and sacrifice those turtle doves to Jehovah. My Barnamesh, you can't do that. That's your only way of income other than begging. Like my God is a provider. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And God loves to see our faith go into action. Like you got a source on the inside. Well, you let your decisions do the talking. I like it because we need to make a confession, but we need to get to putting footsteps to those confessions. &gt;&gt; And blind Barnameus, he had what was known as a a seeing eye dog, but it was a lamb, and that was his eyes. And one day, it just come upon him that he was going to go ahead and sacrifice that unto Jehovah. Wait a minute, Barnameus. You can't you can't sacrifice your only lamb. That's your sight. &gt;&gt; But there was something on the inside that believed for more. &gt;&gt; There was a source on the inside said, you know what? I want to do this for my God. &gt;&gt; I want to sacrifice for my God. And oh my, as brother Ben reading that quote, my heart just broke thinking about my sin. how Jesus Christ had already been beaten and whooped and he was on the way to Calvary and that blind Bardmas's cry of his heart and how he labored by faith to do those things and on the road to bear your sin and my sin the sins of the world something stopped him in his tracks it was the faith of Our brother blind Barnameus. &gt;&gt; He's frozen in his tracks. &gt;&gt; One of the most important jobs a man would ever have. There was only one that can do it. That there was only one that was worthy. But oh my, as I was sitting in my seat and brother Ben's reading that quote got me to realize God's feeling about divine healing. And God wanted to heal his sight so that he can see the Christ. How much more your eyesight to heal you to see the revealed word of the hour is the resource for life. &gt;&gt; This is the only thing that's going to change us. &gt;&gt; The very words of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful &gt;&gt; to think that the scripture says, "Behold, what manner of love &gt;&gt; that is bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now we are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Not later. Right now, &gt;&gt; God is giving you power &gt;&gt; to become the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Don't look at yourself. Look at the word. The word said you are now sons and daughters of God. Well, I just feel to read this quote to you while uh a brother a couple weeks back was preaching. He was preaching out of the message why I'm a holy roller. And I went and listened to that and I got stirred up. I was feeling pretty good. But he said this in why I am a holy roller in paragraph 33 says, "Why I tell you it means something when a man's really born again of the spirit of God. He's acquainted. He becomes acquainted and a personality of God is in him. And he knows that he's only going from the ridiculous to the sublime. &gt;&gt; Well, that sums up my life. That sums up my life. I It was ridiculous to think the things that I led myself into, the prisons, the hell. Oh my, the sicknesses. But oh, when I come into know him &gt;&gt; and the personality of God be to dwell in me to bring deliverance, to bring salvation, to bring healing. Oh, it was so sublime. &gt;&gt; I went from the ridiculous to the sublime. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful that we have a source of life &gt;&gt; that you can be a a partaker of divine fellowship by promise? &gt;&gt; Oh my, what a privileged people we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. And to think as Psalms 10 100 paragraph 1-5, he says, "Now make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness. Come before his presence with singing. &gt;&gt; Know ye that the Lord, he is God. &gt;&gt; It is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves. We are his people, the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and enter into his courts with praise. Be ye thankful unto him and bless his name. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, I'm a thankful person. I believe that we're the people of God, chosen by God to bring the light in this day. Behold, in the evening time, &gt;&gt; there shall be representatives &gt;&gt; of the light. There shall be light in the evening time. &gt;&gt; Amen. The path to glory you will surely find leadership. Praise God for leadership. You know it was one of the last messages brother Brandon preached and that in communion my and to think that you know it it matters so much leadership you know we're going somewhere. He's leading us somewhere, &gt;&gt; you know, by by feeding on the word, you know, drinking in what revelations God's giving us, we become the word. Amen. As you hear it, you receive it, you believe it, you become it. &gt;&gt; You walk in it. &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful, simple formula. Ain't that wonderful &gt;&gt; to know that, you know, we've been given the the key to the door and and and there's only one way to please God. &gt;&gt; There's only one way provided by God and that's by faith. And faith is a revelation. And faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. So, if we've been empowered to go into the storehouse and listen and God can minister to us spiritual food in due season, well, let's just put everything else to the side and recognize the value of it. Amen. I I I'm personally testifying there's many times the enemy will say, "Well, this and that is is, you know, you got to have house, you got to have car, you got I mean, my goodness, there's all these pressures. you know, we're not really fit to live in this day. There's so many things demanding your affection, demanding your attention. Give an answer. Hey, do you mind taking a survey and giving us uh you know what? My goodness, how many things is going to be pulling on us? &gt;&gt; You know, there's a lot of pressure. Brother Brandham talked about it. I believe it was in the thotin age. He was saying like in that age, the believer, it was bender or bow. You were going to be killed if you didn't uh renounce your faith in Christ. But this age is those three pressures. Brother Brandham warned us. He prophesied. He said, he said, "Now the pressure of riches, &gt;&gt; you know, soft living, you know, these are things that try to keep us from going into the storehouse because it's in that source of life." Amen. When faith strikes our heart, it changes us from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; Oh my, I have a source. We have a source of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith changes the situation. Faith masters circumstances. Amen. Faith changes our attitudes towards the lost. Faith changes our attitudes towards the sick. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, I wanted to go through uh something in the book of Luke, chapter 22. there in um verse 7 gospel of Luke verse or chapter 22 and verse 7. How many love the Lord? &gt;&gt; God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Luke 22 and verse 7 thinking about that you know time you know was about to be the Passover and this was preparation of the Passover. It says, "Then came the day of unleavened bread when the Passover must be killed. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the Passover that we might eat." And they said unto him, "Wil thou, where wil thou that we prepare?" And he said unto them, "Behold, when ye enter into the city, there shall be a man that meet you bearing a picture of water. Follow him into the house where he enter in it. And you shall say unto the good man of the house, the master saith unto thee, where is the guest chamber where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples? And he showed and he shall show you a large upper room furnished there. Make ready. Well, I thank God that he's furnished a place. He's He's provided the material for preparation in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a a seven course meal. We have a table set in the presence of our enemy. Oh my, just to think of the parallel. And they went and found as he had said, and they made ready the Passover. And when the hour had come, and he sat down, and the twel apostles with him, and he said unto them, with desire, I have desired to eat the this Passover with you before I suffer. For I say unto you, I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God." And he took the cup and gave thanks, and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves. And he said unto you, "And I say unto you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come." And he took the bread and gave thanks and break it and gave them saying, "This is my body and given for you. Do this in remembrance of me. Oh my my." Likewise also the cup after s saying this is the cup of my new in the new testament in my blood which was shed for you. He says but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me at the table and truly the son of man goeth as it is determined but woe unto the man by whom he is betrayed. And they began to inquire amongst themselves which of them it was that should do this. And there was strife among them, which they should be accounted the greatest. And he said unto them, "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors, but ye shall not be so. But he that is the greatest among you, let him be as the younger, he that is a chief is chief as he that doeth serve. For whether is greater, he that siteth at meat, or he that serveth? It is not him that siteth. Is not he that siteth at meat? But I am among you as that I serveth. Amen. You know, just a super I mean just to think that the God of glory came and showed us the example and gave us a witness of character. It's not, you know, sitting at the high places. Like if someone really is spiritual and they're a servant, they take the lower seat, right? They serve. And that's why I thank God that we have many people who are serving. My, we don't want to just serve in church, though. There's there's people who are unsaved. &gt;&gt; My, there's people that are lost and in darkness. You know, we want to have that attitude. &gt;&gt; You know, like our brother was preaching the other night about mercy. You know, it's it's God's really it's his heart. He he delights in mercy. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Just to think if it wasn't the mercy of God, every single one of us would be perished. &gt;&gt; We would burn in the fire of God. &gt;&gt; But God who's rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for the mercies of God. But I I just oh my just when I started looking at this paragraph 28. Oh, I mean just ye were they which have continued with me in my temptation, and I have appointed unto you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed unto me, that you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom, and sit on my thrones, and sit on thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel. Oh my, just to think about an appointing. He said, I have appointed you to sit on thrones. Oh my, just to think about what the word appointed means. It means to be chosen. It means to be ordained for a specific purpose, a specific time, a specific role. It's also referred to as God's sovereign decision to establish a time or an event. My the designated individuals have a special service such as a leader like a king or a priest. Doesn't this sound familiar? He has made you kings and priests unto our God. Just to think that you by predestination have been given the power of a new birth to believe the word and to be converted to be quickened by the word to quicken by the spirit of life. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And then you become a what what does it a priest supposed to make intercessions? You we're advocating because we know a God that's rich in mercy. We know a God that the blood has not lose its power. And to think as a king, well, King David, you know, he was to lead the nation. My Well, we don't want to go down all those examples, huh? My mind's starting to race a little bit. I don't know how long I've been. I forgot to set my timer. Forgive me. Sunday nights are wonderful. Praise God. But I just got to thinking about, you know, the power of the leadership of God to lead us to lost souls. You know, I don't want to ever lose sight of souls. Amen. I believe that if we lose sight as a church of lost souls, we we're backslid. We need to get to the altar. You know, if we get so busy or so burdened and the cares of this life just start choking the vision out that we're here, we're we're being tested. But to know what it's like to know the difference, to know what it's like to be in bondage to yourself or you know, that's what the fall man did is it put such a a crush on our our our God nature. You know, all of a sudden now we wanted to take all the blessings of God and consume it for ourselves. Oh my. But when you look at Christ when he come, he didn't even have a pillow to lay his head. He was homeless so that you can have a home that I can have a home. He and many times after services he would, you know, have a headache or, you know, he would be hungry or different things. My but he did it because eternal life is living for others. Amen. He took the back seat. That's what we do when we're driving down the road and the guys are blowing by doing a 100 miles an hour weaving in and out of the We were on the way to church today motor. You know what? Go ahead and have the first place. I used to be crazy and doing crazy stuff, but I'm led by the spirit of God now. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a different reward to leadership. Boy, I' I've seen those guys going and the reward, my goodness, is death. &gt;&gt; The end of that road is destruction. &gt;&gt; Which you and I were on that road. But God, because he promised and there was something on the inside that said, I I don't want to remain in this condition. Praise God. We have a source on the inside. &gt;&gt; We're not praying to a God from 2,000 years ago, not even yesterday. We're praying to the God of now. Right now. Today is the day of salvation. Whatever we have need of, we can cry out to the God that's in us. &gt;&gt; What's your need tonight? &gt;&gt; You have needs. I have needs. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a source. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, this is a meeting place for God. God has set a table for us. This is a tent of meeting. This is provided by God. Amen. If you knew, and I know many of you do, but I'm here to remind you, you have a place that God wants to meet you. That's in his word. Amen. He wants to reveal himself to us day by day. As we go into the word of God, that's where our strength lies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without it, we cannot bring forth life. We can't live off of yesterday's mana. You couldn't store it over. We need fresh mana. And oh, just became such a reality as brother Billy was saying, it the the the fresh revelation gives it empowers us to the greater works. You might be looking at your life and say, "I have never laid my hands on any sick person and they've never gotten well." Well, that's okay because we have a source. If you'll just put your faith in the word of God and when the opportunity comes knocking, you just go acting. You say, "You know what? It might have not never happened, but t today might be my day. Today, you're sick. I have a God. I have a source. And I'm going to pray to the God that's in me. The same God that created the heavens and the earth. He's living in me. In you? Yeah. You want to triumph? He promised. I'll show you his promise. It's unfailing. &gt;&gt; There's two things that are immutable. God can't change. He can't lie. &gt;&gt; He's the same in essence, in power. He He can still save. &gt;&gt; His blood is still dripping wet on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's fresh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we thank God for that. You know, I just here to remind you. I know we've heard these things over and over and over again, but my I just can't get enough of it because, you know, I don't want to be a forgetful hearer. You know, I I know these things, but life gets in the way. This natural life, you know, we make plans and we get busy and things just take us away. But if we're not careful, we'll let one day go and then two days and then it's been a week and different things. But I want to remind you that our prophet taught this in the revelation of Jesus Christ. He says it's by the the spirit of God that we if we can discern and withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before us. My to think that there's something that would make the devil powerless over your life. You have strongholds. You have difficulties in your life. We all do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the greatest power that God has placed in the hands of man is prayer. God, he he told the prophet, he says, "Pray for revelation." &gt;&gt; We need revelation every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're praying for it. We want to pray for more of it. &gt;&gt; And faith cometh by hearing. Amen. We want to activate. We want to awaken the Christ in us. Amen. That's when the glory comes. When the supernatural Amen. He said, "With true revelation in our lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail against us, but we will prevail against them." &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I need that. You need that. You Sometimes the trial and the test, the sickness, the financial, the the relational troubles, they're too big for me. They're too big for us. But we got a big brother. We got a God. We got a source of life. Amen. And if we if God will, we just have to be faithful to go into prayer and listen to the services. Listen, let God lead us. He's going to lead us right to the very food. Amen. I think that's wonderful. It is the revelation of God that gives you authority over the devil. And you can see why they would they who would add or take away will be cursed. It would it would have to be so. For who can add to or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy? It is that simple. There is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word. My I mean we're not talking about Dr. Dobson. I mean I I tell you that's okay for them. I mean there was a time I I used to listen to that. But then when I heard the voice of God, it gave me power over the sin in my life. It gave me victory where I couldn't get the victory just hearing about uh you know psychology because God didn't back that up. He backed his word up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, praise the Lord. I've been longer than I thought to be. So we'll try to find a place to close. Everybody feeling happy? &gt;&gt; Our meetings are coming up and you know I just wanted to remind you one of the things that was just spurring on my heart you know brother Michael and brother Tom you know that they've been such a blessing to me personally you know and I think the last time brother Michael was here he was talking about untapped resources you know and I'm looking forward to the meetings. I'm looking forward because under that expectation things happen. &gt;&gt; You know, we get all together and we have these needs and something about the expectation is lifted and and I can point back me personally back in 2007 in the old church. It was a it was our annual meetings and I testified to the youth about this but I'll say it again. 2007 I remember brother Tom was preaching show us the father and it would suffice us and he's like Phillip you know haven't we been with you so long and you're saying show us the father and that message did so much good to me because I was facing a lot of struggle I was I had years and years of complex physical dysfunction doctors saying there's no cure for this and no you know I I had the remedies medicines which okay but there was something on the inside saying, "I just don't want to settle for that." &gt;&gt; But when he was preaching, it brought Christ alive. And then I realized there's another source of life. &gt;&gt; And God made that a reality to me that he was my healer. And from that day till today, they can't explain it, nor can I. But God was faithful to his word. &gt;&gt; You know, I had years and years. They said there's no cure for what I had in my back. It was degenerative. But praise God, I wasn't going to lift up that disease. I wasn't going to lift up my struggle and all of the years of heartache and hardship. But now I can point and say, I got a source of life. I got a resource. Now I know my God. I've heard of him before that he did it for others, but now I seen it. It's a reality to me. And when the hard time comes, when the struggle comes, I don't come running, racing out for entertainment to soothe me. &gt;&gt; I go to the source. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the rock. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just get to thinking about the rock, Christ Jesus. You know, it was the time that I don't know why, but just God wanted to express himself, you know, in in a rock. You know, he told Moses, he said, "Speak to the rock and it'll bring forth its waters." Amen. Amen. And you know, all the pressure started accumulating. You know, the waters gave forth when he spoke, but you know, just like human nature, the pressure gets on and he went over there and smoked it. But there's consequences to our actions. Amen. Just because you got saved and God's dealt with you and you've got the victory and God quickened it in you, you know, uh just like that old chaplain, you know, it's like, hey, he started acting crazy like, you know, all that stuff. He But he made it right right there in that moment when the Lord started dealing with him. He said, you know what? I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm so sorry. I was wrong. Praise God. We don't have to let wrongs carry out to where all of a sudden we're beating ourselves up and we're like, "Oh, I'm no good." No. If we're wrong, let's just make it right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We could just confess our wrongs one to another. And the blood of Jesus cleanses us. Amen. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; And I got to thinking about that. You know, if if you know there's storms in our lives, just like when Jesus was asleep in the ship and brother Brandon preached that great message, go wake Jesus. You know, there's someone on the inside waiting to be called on the scene. Amen. What's your need? You know, what's your desire? You know, we can call Jesus on the scene. Amen. I got to thinking also, you know, and maybe we can invite the musicians to come. Amen. We just uh you know, we're in the hour of the adoption of the children of God. And you know, God has told us and spoke over us that the word is in the bride. She has the mind of Christ and she'll stay still. She'll stay still until she has thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. So you can know when God starts moving on your heart and it's according to his word, you can speak the word and it'll bring forth. And I believe brother Brandon was asked, he said, "How many squirrels do you need?" Like, hey, he's the first one that come to maturity. So every day we have needs every day. If you think a a squirrel or a little fish or a possum, you know, God's mindful of what we would think is insignificant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The moment that you have a need, it matters to God. &gt;&gt; He says, "What do you need?" Well, the limit is he challenged brother Brandham to ask. You know, God is going to challenge you. Say what you want &gt;&gt; and I'll give it to you. &gt;&gt; We got to have that character that knows the mind of God. We've been battler trained. We've been battles scarred. We've been tested. We know we have a leader that will lead us astray, but we're not we're not uh ignorant of his devices. You know, if if you're running out and your flesh has got you pinned down, you just start denying yourself. Start starving that thing out. Feed on the word of God. Watch how God will resurrect his life in you. It's been my testimony. Has it been yours? Someone want to testify that maybe they don't know this God? Maybe they don't know the God of resurrection to resurrect you out of the [music] dead traditions of man, out of the dead works of man, but just to trust the true and living God. Amen.
