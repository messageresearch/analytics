[22:50] man we certainly want to welcome
[22:52] everyone and our visitors amen thank you
[22:55] for being here we're going to invite
[22:56] brother mike for our psalm reading this
[22:58] morning god bless you
[23:15] good morning
[23:19] every once in a while when you're
[23:22] reading the scriptures you come across
[23:26] some words that are unusual
[23:28] they're words that
[23:30] you know maybe we don't use
[23:32] anymore in the english language
[23:36] don't
[23:37] you know probably most people don't
[23:39] really know what they mean
[23:42] you know most of the time we all do it
[23:43] we read right past the word
[23:47] and we just sort of assume what it means
[23:50] you know we think because of the context
[23:52] it means one thing or another and we
[23:54] just
[23:56] let it pass on by
[23:59] there's an example
[24:01] one of those words in psalm 30.
[24:06] and it begins in verse 1 i will
[24:09] extol thee
[24:11] oh lord
[24:14] i will extol thee
[24:17] you know and this is
[24:18] david speaking
[24:21] that word
[24:22] extol
[24:24] is probably not a word that any of us
[24:27] use
[24:28] probably nobody would really understand
[24:30] what you're saying if you used it in
[24:33] regular
[24:34] language
[24:37] you know i suppose that when we read
[24:39] that we sort of breeze right by it
[24:41] thinking that you know it's
[24:44] just praise
[24:47] and
[24:48] you know the question becomes do you
[24:49] really
[24:51] know what you're reading
[24:53] when you read it
[24:56] you know sometimes we'll
[24:58] simply assume what it means and perhaps
[25:01] miss out
[25:02] on the message that's hidden in that
[25:05] word
[25:07] you know the words in scripture are not
[25:09] random
[25:11] they aren't just casually thrown out
[25:13] there to fill out space on a page
[25:16] the scripture says that holy men of god
[25:18] spake as they were moved by the holy
[25:20] ghost
[25:21] and history has shown that the hand of
[25:23] god has very carefully directed the
[25:26] construction of his word in the
[25:29] scriptures through the ages
[25:31] so every word
[25:33] is divinely appointed
[25:37] even the ones that are
[25:39] odd
[25:42] you know that word extol is only used
[25:44] four times in scripture
[25:48] three of those times are by david
[25:50] in the psalms
[25:52] and this is the first time right here
[25:54] that word is ever used
[25:58] and you know i've shared with you before
[25:59] more often than not the first time a
[26:02] word or phrase is used in the scripture
[26:04] there's a clue
[26:05] to what it means
[26:08] you know that word extol in the hebrew
[26:11] actually means to raise up
[26:14] to lift up
[26:18] kind of like a heave offering
[26:22] but you know
[26:23] this is this is more than just our
[26:25] version of praising the lord
[26:28] this is not something you do with your
[26:29] lips
[26:30] this is an action
[26:32] that hebrew word is literally taking an
[26:35] object
[26:36] and lifting it up and putting it
[26:39] in your highest place
[26:42] to extol
[26:46] you know when we
[26:48] read the scripture
[26:49] that says i extol thee
[26:52] oh lord
[26:55] do we
[26:57] do we take him
[26:59] and lift him up
[27:02] into our highest
[27:03] place
[27:05] not on sunday morning in a song service
[27:09] but on tuesday morning
[27:11] with your walk
[27:13] this is not something you verbalize this
[27:15] is not something you say with music or
[27:17] sing with a song or
[27:19] lift up your hands and suddenly you're
[27:21] extolling
[27:23] the lord but it's where you take him and
[27:26] you put him in your highest
[27:29] place
[27:31] this is an effort
[27:33] this is a an action
[27:36] when the music stops and you go home
[27:39] do you put him in your highest place
[27:45] you know psalm 30 verse 1 says i will
[27:47] extol thee o lord
[27:50] i will lift you up
[27:53] because
[27:55] thou has lifted me up
[27:58] you see the difference
[28:00] this is more than just praise it's
[28:03] because you have taken me
[28:05] and you have lifted me up
[28:07] now i take you
[28:09] and i lift you up
[28:13] i will extol thee oh lord this is
[28:16] something that you can only do
[28:19] if you have first
[28:21] experienced his hand
[28:24] lifting you up
[28:26] this is not something you can casually
[28:28] walk into a church service and do
[28:30] you have to have first experienced his
[28:32] hand
[28:34] reaching down and taking you
[28:36] and lifting you up
[28:38] to a higher place before you could ever
[28:40] begin to lay hold of him
[28:43] and lift him up
[28:44] to your highest place
[28:47] you know david knew a little bit about
[28:50] being raised up from nothing
[28:53] and put in a higher place
[28:55] you know it says in
[28:57] second samuel 7 8 as the prophet is
[29:00] speaking to him thus saith the lord of
[29:02] hosts i took thee from the sheep coat
[29:05] from following the sheep
[29:08] to be ruler over my people
[29:10] israel and it was at the time in second
[29:13] samuel five where he finally had laid to
[29:16] rest all his enemies and found himself
[29:19] in a place of kingship when he had
[29:20] previously been on the run living among
[29:23] the sheep
[29:24] and then he had another king offer him
[29:26] tribute and build him a house of cedars
[29:29] for nothing and it was at the dedication
[29:31] of that house
[29:32] that psalm 30 is written it says i will
[29:35] lift you up oh lord because you
[29:38] have lifted me up
[29:40] he knew something about the hand of the
[29:42] lord taking him from nothing and raising
[29:45] him up
[29:47] you know the very last time that word
[29:49] extol is used
[29:52] comes from kind of a surprising place
[29:56] did you know
[29:58] that king nebuchadnezzar actually wrote
[30:00] a chapter of our bible
[30:03] and it's in daniel
[30:05] chapter four
[30:07] that entire chapter is a writing of king
[30:09] nebuchadnezzar writing
[30:11] scripture and it's an experience that he
[30:14] had
[30:15] with the lord
[30:17] you know the story that he became lifted
[30:20] up with pride and there came a point in
[30:22] time where god struck him down where he
[30:24] was living as a wild man among the
[30:26] animals had lost his mind was eating
[30:29] plants and living among the beasts and
[30:31] you know they had to cast him out of the
[30:33] city but there came an hour where god
[30:36] came by his way and lifted him back up
[30:39] and raised him back up and put him back
[30:41] on his throne
[30:43] and it was there that he wrote daniel 4
[30:45] 37 now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol
[30:50] and honor
[30:51] the king of heaven
[30:54] somebody who had experienced the hand of
[30:55] god picking him up and putting him in a
[30:58] higher place now he could take the lord
[31:00] and put him in his highest place
[31:03] the very king of babylon
[31:06] i will extol thee oh lord
[31:09] not something you sing
[31:11] not something you say no matter how loud
[31:14] you say it but it's something you do
[31:17] and it's something you can only do
[31:19] if you've experienced his hand
[31:22] lifting you up
[31:24] what a wonderful reminder
[31:27] funny
[31:28] what a little word
[31:29] will do
[31:31] if you don't breeze by it
[31:34] so maybe let's read psalm 30 this
[31:36] morning it's just a short chapter
[31:38] i will extol the o lord
[31:40] starting in verse 1
[31:42] i will extol thee oh lord for thou has
[31:46] lifted me up and has not made my foes to
[31:49] rejoice over me
[31:51] o lord my god i cried unto thee and thou
[31:54] hast healed me
[31:55] o lord thou hast brought up my soul from
[31:58] the great thou hast kept me alive that i
[32:01] should not go down to the pit
[32:04] sing unto the lord o ye saints of his
[32:06] and give thanks at the remembrance of
[32:09] his holiness for his anger endureth but
[32:12] a moment in his favor is light
[32:15] weeping may endure for a night but joy
[32:17] cometh in the morning
[32:19] and in my prosperity i said i shall
[32:22] never be moved
[32:23] lord by thy favor thou has made my
[32:26] mountain to stand strong thou didst tie
[32:28] thy face and i was troubled i cried to
[32:31] thee o lord and unto the lord i made
[32:34] supplication
[32:35] what prophet is there in my blood when i
[32:38] go down to the pit shall the dust phrase
[32:40] thee shall it declare thy truth
[32:43] hear o lord and have mercy upon me lord
[32:46] be thou my helper thou hast turned for
[32:49] me my morning into dancing thou has put
[32:52] off my sackcloth and girded me with
[32:55] gladness to the end that my glory may
[32:58] sing praise to thee and not be silent o
[33:01] lord my god i will give thanks unto thee
[33:04] forever

[1:00:09] that's why we've chosen the path that
[1:00:12] we've chosen
[1:00:14] that's why we incline our ear to your
[1:00:17] word
[1:00:20] lord and we just ask that you
[1:00:21] continually
[1:00:24] strengthen us in our resolve

[1:00:41] and though the world mocks
[1:00:45] and says that we've lost our minds
[1:00:49] we have a promise let this mind be in
[1:00:52] you
[1:00:54] that was in the lord jesus
[1:00:57] and we ask that you'd grant that to us
[1:00:59] this morning
[1:01:01] we asked these things this morning
[1:01:03] in the precious and wonderful name
[1:01:06] of the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:01:09] amen

[1:01:44] found in um
[1:01:48] ephesians the 6th chapter and the 12th
[1:01:52] verse
[1:02:00] in the scripture in ephesians the 6th
[1:02:03] chapter and the 12th verse reads as

[1:02:20] against the rulers
[1:02:22] of darkness of this world
[1:02:25] and against spiritual wickedness
[1:02:28] in high
[1:02:30] places
[1:02:31] amen our gracious heavenly father

[1:02:43] amen god bless you you may be seated
[1:02:53] we'd like just to have a little
[1:02:55] sunday school this morning it's
[1:02:56] certainly
[1:02:58] nice to be back in the house of the lord
[1:03:00] and good morning to you all
[1:03:02] i i hope you miss me as much as i missed
[1:03:05] you
[1:03:07] you know that that would be nice but
[1:03:10] so
[1:03:12] you know sir
[1:03:13] being out seeing my mother and
[1:03:16] many of you know my mother's 99 years
[1:03:18] old now and
[1:03:20] you know she
[1:03:23] if i go buy a loaf of bread she wants to
[1:03:26] give me a dollar
[1:03:27] to pay for it you know and
[1:03:30] uh she's always uh
[1:03:33] want me to pay me back for everything
[1:03:36] but
[1:03:36] we were able to put in a new dishwasher
[1:03:39] for and
[1:03:40] and fix the door handle and fix the gate
[1:03:44] and put a light in the shed and
[1:03:47] put a
[1:03:50] motion detector light out in the new
[1:03:52] porch light
[1:03:54] and
[1:03:55] so we're there doing things for but you
[1:03:57] know she does so well it's it's it's
[1:04:00] really remarkable
[1:04:02] and
[1:04:03] she won't even let me help her down the
[1:04:05] steps
[1:04:07] you know i can do this and
[1:04:10] and
[1:04:11] we went we didn't go fishing this trip
[1:04:13] but we went fishing
[1:04:15] uh one trip with my mom and she walked
[1:04:18] all the way out
[1:04:20] to the pier with us all the way
[1:04:22] and she held the fishing pole
[1:04:25] and she fished out this there with us
[1:04:27] for about eight hours
[1:04:29] and
[1:04:31] you know
[1:04:33] i
[1:04:34] i'm thankful
[1:04:38] to the lord for that
[1:04:42] very few
[1:04:44] people in their 70s have their mothers
[1:04:47] with them you know i lost my father i
[1:04:50] guess 12 years ago or so
[1:04:54] and
[1:04:55] but
[1:04:56] i'm thankful for it but yet knowing
[1:04:59] that this can't go on forever
[1:05:05] you know it's you have to sometimes look
[1:05:08] at the things that you're facing
[1:05:12] and there's uh something that
[1:05:14] they refer to
[1:05:16] a lot in
[1:05:19] the world today
[1:05:21] and it's called
[1:05:22] denial
[1:05:24] uh you know they will call somebody and
[1:05:27] they'll say well they're in denial
[1:05:30] another they've
[1:05:31] they refuse to look at it the way that
[1:05:34] it really is
[1:05:36] and they'll they'll stand there and
[1:05:38] they'll be
[1:05:39] in denial they don't
[1:05:42] recognize that they have a problem
[1:05:45] and many times before you can help
[1:05:47] people
[1:05:48] is
[1:05:49] they've got to come to the conclusion
[1:05:51] that
[1:05:52] they have a problem
[1:05:54] you know if you don't have a problem
[1:05:56] then
[1:05:57] you certainly can't have help
[1:06:00] but if you recognize that you have a
[1:06:02] problem
[1:06:03] and you desire to have help
[1:06:06] then
[1:06:07] uh that's what you're resting in you're
[1:06:09] resting in the fact that that uh
[1:06:13] that there's help
[1:06:15] and uh if you know and i i i really uh
[1:06:20] being out in california
[1:06:23] which is a very different place than
[1:06:26] texas is
[1:06:28] of course i
[1:06:29] they still have
[1:06:31] uh masked mandates and you got to wear a
[1:06:34] mask everywhere and
[1:06:36] and they still have a lot of
[1:06:39] lockdown procedures and
[1:06:42] still
[1:06:43] seem to be
[1:06:46] dealing with covet in a much different
[1:06:49] way
[1:06:50] than we're dealing with it
[1:06:53] but i begin to look and think of the
[1:06:56] great effect
[1:06:58] that
[1:06:59] this
[1:07:00] plague
[1:07:02] and i thought it was strange that
[1:07:05] our government referred to it as a
[1:07:07] plague
[1:07:10] they called it one at one time they
[1:07:12] called it the china plague and
[1:07:15] and that wasn't correct because
[1:07:18] it was satan's plague
[1:07:21] that's who it is all sickness is of the
[1:07:23] devil
[1:07:25] but it was sent
[1:07:27] for a purpose
[1:07:29] and a reason and
[1:07:31] and uh
[1:07:33] and
[1:07:34] and seeing the far-reaching effects
[1:07:38] of what that it did
[1:07:40] and i think one of the strongest effects
[1:07:43] that it had everybody talks about the
[1:07:45] economical effect
[1:07:48] and
[1:07:49] you know the economy effect and the
[1:07:51] effect on the supply chain and the
[1:07:54] effect on being able to get things and
[1:07:56] the effect on prices and they all talk
[1:07:59] about the carnal
[1:08:02] effect
[1:08:04] of the plague
[1:08:06] but it was the spiritual toll
[1:08:10] that the plague took
[1:08:12] that was greater than the carnal toll
[1:08:18] and
[1:08:19] not just our church
[1:08:22] through this time period we have lost
[1:08:25] uh members uh from our congregation
[1:08:29] uh different things have transpired
[1:08:33] and
[1:08:33] but churches in general
[1:08:36] have lost
[1:08:38] a tremendous amount
[1:08:41] of
[1:08:42] people
[1:08:43] this is the first time in our nation's
[1:08:46] history
[1:08:47] that more people don't go to church
[1:08:51] then go to church
[1:08:54] so you no longer can be called a
[1:08:56] christian nation
[1:08:58] when the majority of the population
[1:09:00] doesn't go to church anymore
[1:09:02] it's almost down to only 40 percent
[1:09:06] so because that's a a
[1:09:09] quite a shift
[1:09:11] and so we begin to understand that
[1:09:13] things are shifting
[1:09:15] things are
[1:09:16] changing
[1:09:18] we know that
[1:09:22] man has a great desire to survive
[1:09:25] and they always argue and fuss
[1:09:29] over
[1:09:30] their
[1:09:32] method to survive
[1:09:34] and many people feel that what's going
[1:09:37] to have to happen
[1:09:39] is that the world is going to have to
[1:09:42] come together
[1:09:43] as one great community
[1:09:46] and there's going to have to have
[1:09:48] something that rises up
[1:09:50] and governs the world together
[1:09:53] in order for the world together to fight
[1:09:57] plagues how many knows plagues are
[1:10:00] coming
[1:10:03] they're coming
[1:10:06] how evident
[1:10:08] is the reality
[1:10:11] of plagues just think two years ago
[1:10:14] a around this time
[1:10:18] it just started coming
[1:10:20] and it wasn't by the
[1:10:23] end of this month in the beginning of
[1:10:25] february i believe that we only had 10
[1:10:28] people
[1:10:29] allowed in church
[1:10:33] and they had shut everything down
[1:10:35] restaurants were closed
[1:10:38] people were
[1:10:39] going to stores and
[1:10:41] and taking everything off the shelves
[1:10:48] many of you remember the great
[1:10:51] run on toilet paper
[1:10:55] that's how smart man is
[1:10:58] you know what i mean and
[1:11:00] uh
[1:11:01] it and
[1:11:02] so
[1:11:03] it just came
[1:11:05] and
[1:11:07] everybody was in lockdown the police
[1:11:09] showed up here at our our church to find
[1:11:12] out if we had
[1:11:15] more than people here somebody called
[1:11:18] because they saw some cars in the
[1:11:20] parking lot and
[1:11:22] the the policeman came in and
[1:11:26] of course we invited him to stay but
[1:11:29] he didn't feel
[1:11:31] that he could
[1:11:32] i said well you don't have to be on the
[1:11:34] street there's nobody out there
[1:11:39] and i and as far as i'm concerned you're
[1:11:41] a lot safer in the house of the lord
[1:11:44] than you are out out there
[1:11:47] uh you know sometimes we forget that uh
[1:11:50] part of it
[1:11:51] but there's been a a great
[1:11:54] event
[1:11:57] that's happened
[1:11:59] and sometimes it's hard for us to stand
[1:12:01] back
[1:12:03] and
[1:12:03] look at it
[1:12:05] from afar
[1:12:07] and realized what has
[1:12:11] just
[1:12:12] transpired
[1:12:14] and what what has just swept
[1:12:18] over the land
[1:12:21] and the world
[1:12:23] and what was the purpose behind it
[1:12:27] in other words what was satan
[1:12:30] trying to accomplish
[1:12:35] you know i know we don't take that
[1:12:38] in
[1:12:39] to thought
[1:12:41] much and that's what why we want to play
[1:12:44] uh 20 minutes 21 minutes of
[1:12:48] a message called the conflict
[1:12:50] between god and satan
[1:12:54] and also we'd like to read a few
[1:12:56] statements from the contest
[1:13:00] so there there
[1:13:01] had to be something that satan was
[1:13:06] trying to accomplish
[1:13:08] by
[1:13:10] sending
[1:13:12] this
[1:13:14] virus or
[1:13:15] whatever
[1:13:17] uh you want to call it or this
[1:13:20] circumstance this situation
[1:13:23] and after there there had to be
[1:13:26] something that
[1:13:27] that he was
[1:13:30] trying to accomplish
[1:13:33] or get at
[1:13:36] now
[1:13:37] so we know
[1:13:39] where the battle is
[1:13:42] don't we
[1:13:44] the battles where it's in the mind
[1:13:47] and so we know that
[1:13:50] there's
[1:13:51] a message that was preached called the
[1:13:54] greatest battle ever fought
[1:13:57] and i went back and i started reading
[1:14:00] through the titles
[1:14:02] of the messages in 1962
[1:14:06] and i thought this is a
[1:14:10] a prelude if i could say this 1916
[1:14:15] is
[1:14:16] the prelude
[1:14:18] of
[1:14:20] the sermons being preached
[1:14:23] before the opening of the
[1:14:26] seals and
[1:14:29] and and so
[1:14:31] god was
[1:14:32] preparing
[1:14:34] his children if i could say it that way
[1:14:37] by the word of god
[1:14:40] for a great event
[1:14:43] that was going to take place
[1:14:46] and he preached messages like the
[1:14:48] paradox
[1:14:51] you know something that is seemingly
[1:14:55] unbelievable
[1:14:57] but yet it's real
[1:14:59] he preached messages like
[1:15:02] perseverance
[1:15:04] and the greatest battle
[1:15:07] ever fought wisdom versus faith the
[1:15:11] contest
[1:15:12] the conflict between
[1:15:14] god and satan so many of uh
[1:15:18] forsaking all
[1:15:20] he preached so many messages
[1:15:23] that
[1:15:24] the uncertain sound
[1:15:28] so many
[1:15:29] messages
[1:15:30] that indicated
[1:15:32] that there was a battle
[1:15:36] coming
[1:15:38] there
[1:15:40] and that's what he's talking about the
[1:15:41] greatest battle ever fought so you know
[1:15:44] so much of what our messenger preached
[1:15:47] to us is prophecy
[1:15:51] it's preparation
[1:15:54] god always gives warning
[1:15:56] before judgment
[1:15:59] and so he began to preach a lot of 62
[1:16:03] if the prophet of god is talking about
[1:16:07] like wisdom
[1:16:09] versus
[1:16:10] faith
[1:16:12] you know
[1:16:12] it indicates battle it indicates strife
[1:16:16] it indicates the fact that you're going
[1:16:18] to have to pre
[1:16:20] uh pursue you're going to have to
[1:16:22] persist
[1:16:24] you're going to have to you're going to
[1:16:26] have to
[1:16:26] fight the good fight of faith
[1:16:30] and soak it if i know we're sitting back
[1:16:32] here yeah
[1:16:34] i guess it would be now what
[1:16:37] 60 years
[1:16:38] later is that where how far we are from
[1:16:41] 62
[1:16:44] 22 right so
[1:16:47] we're years later but there's something
[1:16:49] that we always forget about god's word
[1:16:53] that god's word is eternal
[1:16:58] and it doesn't change
[1:17:00] the only thing that changes is man
[1:17:03] changes
[1:17:06] man is always trying to adjust
[1:17:12] to
[1:17:13] what's around him
[1:17:16] and
[1:17:17] and so
[1:17:18] this this great
[1:17:20] uh
[1:17:22] 60 years later we really find out the
[1:17:26] things that were preached
[1:17:30] are coming to pass
[1:17:35] and you know
[1:17:36] we think about it
[1:17:38] how many years was it
[1:17:41] before the lord came that isaiah
[1:17:46] said a virgin
[1:17:48] shall conceive
[1:17:51] you go back hundreds of years
[1:17:54] 800 years i i think is some scholars say
[1:17:59] so many of the things that were preached
[1:18:02] before he ever arrived
[1:18:05] in fact there was such a distance
[1:18:07] between the times the prophecies were
[1:18:10] given in bethlehem oh little bethlehem
[1:18:16] the things that were spoken
[1:18:18] and the things that were prophesied and
[1:18:20] the things that he said he would be
[1:18:23] there was so much time in between
[1:18:26] and society and education and
[1:18:29] civilization had changed even though the
[1:18:33] promise had not changed
[1:18:38] that it became unrecognizable
[1:18:44] when it showed up
[1:18:48] so much so
[1:18:50] he even said i have not come to do i
[1:18:52] come to fulfill every jot every tittle
[1:18:56] every prophecy that was made with search
[1:18:59] the scriptures
[1:19:01] in them you say you have eternal life
[1:19:03] but every single one of them spoke of me
[1:19:10] so really he
[1:19:12] he was a fulfillment
[1:19:15] of the law and the prophets
[1:19:18] but there had been such a space of time
[1:19:22] such a change in the civilization
[1:19:25] such a change in the education such a
[1:19:29] change in the economy
[1:19:31] that and people became more involved in
[1:19:35] prosperity
[1:19:37] and and the things that they could learn
[1:19:40] and the advancements that they were
[1:19:42] making and the political
[1:19:44] system that had come upon them with the
[1:19:48] roman empire and all those things that
[1:19:51] the fulfillment of the scriptures
[1:19:54] became blurred to their vision
[1:20:00] and i think that
[1:20:01] a lot of what's transpiring now
[1:20:07] it's been a while
[1:20:10] since
[1:20:13] the message
[1:20:15] was given
[1:20:16] the warning was given
[1:20:19] that we've had
[1:20:21] marriages and
[1:20:22] and and and children and
[1:20:26] we've grown
[1:20:28] in age and in time
[1:20:30] and
[1:20:31] many have come
[1:20:33] and gone
[1:20:35] and but yet the one thing that always
[1:20:38] remains the same
[1:20:40] is god's word
[1:20:43] so this morning
[1:20:45] this message to me is
[1:20:48] these two messages
[1:20:51] stood up for me because we were just
[1:20:53] finishing the sermon does god ever
[1:20:56] change his mind
[1:20:57] about his word
[1:21:01] and in other words that's the one thing
[1:21:03] about god's word
[1:21:06] and so this morning when we
[1:21:08] when we look at it you say well do you
[1:21:10] have a title
[1:21:13] uh for
[1:21:14] uh
[1:21:16] your sermon then i i thought if i would
[1:21:18] have a title i would call it the
[1:21:21] restoration of the weapon
[1:21:27] the restoration of the weapon
[1:21:32] and so let's just listen to
[1:21:35] a few statements before
[1:21:37] that we listen to the
[1:21:39] 21
[1:21:41] minutes of this tape
[1:21:43] so
[1:21:44] this is called this
[1:21:47] quotes that i want to read to you here
[1:21:49] is from the message a contest
[1:21:53] so you are in a contest
[1:21:57] you may not think you are
[1:21:59] but you are
[1:22:01] you are involved in a battle
[1:22:05] the greatest battle that was ever fought
[1:22:09] you are in the battle
[1:22:11] of your mind
[1:22:14] so there can you imagine we just heard
[1:22:17] now let's let's just look at how scary
[1:22:20] the description
[1:22:22] of this enemy is
[1:22:25] he's the ruler of darkness
[1:22:30] it's spiritual
[1:22:33] wickedness
[1:22:35] in
[1:22:36] high places
[1:22:39] principalities
[1:22:41] and powers
[1:22:44] rulers of darkness
[1:22:46] spiritual wickedness in high places what
[1:22:49] a description there isn't no little guy
[1:22:53] this is a scary dude
[1:22:57] and what is he after
[1:23:03] you think what is he after what is he
[1:23:06] trying to get a hold of
[1:23:09] what is it that he's trying to captivate
[1:23:12] because that's what he is he's a
[1:23:14] captivator
[1:23:17] that's why the lord came to what set us
[1:23:20] free so you sit back and you think what
[1:23:22] is satan after he's after your mind
[1:23:27] he wants to get this thing
[1:23:29] that's inside of you
[1:23:32] and make it think the way he thinks
[1:23:35] you're gonna think the way i think else
[1:23:38] you're gonna fail you're gonna get sick
[1:23:41] you're not gonna ever have nothing
[1:23:43] you're never gonna have that ferrari
[1:23:44] you've always wanted
[1:23:51] no you don't think he's after his mind
[1:23:54] because the greatest battle was preached
[1:23:58] 60 years ago
[1:24:01] and we forgot
[1:24:05] you know what one of the curses of satan
[1:24:08] is they no longer wish to keep god in
[1:24:11] their consciousness
[1:24:15] so they're seared with the hot iron
[1:24:18] he's after your children's mind
[1:24:24] just think of the stuff i i just saw it
[1:24:27] the other day that
[1:24:32] i don't know who makes emojis
[1:24:38] i didn't know what emoji was i thought
[1:24:40] it was a soft drink
[1:24:42] it's like the sister who went to the
[1:24:44] chinese restaurant and said oh
[1:24:47] they have a wee fee here i've never
[1:24:50] eaten wefi before
[1:25:00] but they they have a pregnant man
[1:25:05] and some other
[1:25:06] thing
[1:25:10] why
[1:25:12] why
[1:25:14] they're after your mind
[1:25:19] look what's going what's the battle in
[1:25:21] school they have the unicorn
[1:25:25] you know because they have books
[1:25:28] everything what are they after they're
[1:25:29] after your mind it's it's okay to be
[1:25:32] homosexual
[1:25:33] it's okay to have the same sex marriage
[1:25:36] it's okay to do this and it's it's okay
[1:25:40] to do that what are they battling for
[1:25:43] they're battling for your mind and what
[1:25:45] are they trying to make it they're
[1:25:46] trying to make it difficult for you to
[1:25:49] stand up and fight against it
[1:25:54] i thought
[1:25:55] uh
[1:25:56] brother my psalm was
[1:25:58] so perfect in the exhortation this
[1:26:00] morning
[1:26:02] with god's word
[1:26:04] no you don't think about your mind just
[1:26:06] go about your way
[1:26:08] see that's to me
[1:26:12] what satan's purpose of the plague was
[1:26:16] was to get people out of the house of
[1:26:18] god to get them out of fellowship to get
[1:26:21] them out of why because the word
[1:26:24] corrects the air
[1:26:26] the word is what battles the battle
[1:26:30] and so if he could isolate you
[1:26:37] if you can decide that you don't need to
[1:26:40] come to church together if it's too
[1:26:42] dangerous come to come to church you
[1:26:44] want to know something
[1:26:46] people are just getting
[1:26:48] sick just the same
[1:26:53] well i'll tell you it's too dangerous to
[1:26:55] eat nowadays
[1:26:59] half the food's hybrid it's poison
[1:27:02] it's producing a bunch of mush
[1:27:05] that's the saith the lord
[1:27:14] but you see what he's after
[1:27:17] he's after our minds
[1:27:20] because after our thought process he's
[1:27:23] after our thinking
[1:27:26] come what do we call that
[1:27:31] we'll get to it
[1:27:33] let's just listen
[1:27:36] he said spiritual wickedness in high
[1:27:38] places
[1:27:42] now isn't that funny you can't see
[1:27:44] spirits
[1:27:46] you can only see the effect
[1:27:49] of the spirit
[1:27:52] how many times have you heard this
[1:27:54] expression have you lost your mind
[1:28:02] way because people are now questioning
[1:28:06] the thought process
[1:28:08] and the faculties
[1:28:10] that go into the decision-making
[1:28:15] have you lost your mind well i say have
[1:28:17] you lost your spiritual mind have you
[1:28:20] lost your eye sav
[1:28:22] have you lost your gold trident fire
[1:28:25] have you lost your white raymond
[1:28:33] i'd like to draw
[1:28:35] from that this is paragraph nine
[1:28:38] in the contest
[1:28:41] preached in
[1:28:43] i think it it's december 31st in 1962.
[1:28:53] for a 15-minute context rather i want to
[1:28:55] call it the contest
[1:28:59] a contest is a test
[1:29:03] of strength
[1:29:09] so what do you think he really sent this
[1:29:12] plague for
[1:29:14] to test
[1:29:16] the strength
[1:29:18] of the church
[1:29:23] to test the strength of their mind
[1:29:27] how many people without reason you tell
[1:29:30] me
[1:29:31] why people believe
[1:29:33] that he can sit there and eat
[1:29:37] and i can put a mask on standing up
[1:29:42] and he's safe
[1:29:50] everybody buys it
[1:29:54] i pity
[1:29:57] a person who's driving down the street
[1:29:59] in their car
[1:30:01] that they took out of their garage that
[1:30:04] they came out of their house into their
[1:30:06] car out of their garage is in driving
[1:30:09] down the street with two face masks on
[1:30:12] and a shield
[1:30:14] [Music]
[1:30:21] you know why
[1:30:23] they've lost
[1:30:25] their mind
[1:30:27] or may i say it this way they are coming
[1:30:30] into one mind
[1:30:37] doesn't god want us to be in one mind
[1:30:39] and one accord what do you think the
[1:30:41] enemy wants one mind one accord
[1:30:49] and it's a test of strength
[1:30:54] are you going to bow
[1:30:57] no i'd rather be a shadrack a mesh
[1:31:00] acting than the bed eagle i want him to
[1:31:02] sing the song shadrach meshach and
[1:31:05] abednego and david
[1:31:12] we don't want to go in the fiery furnace
[1:31:17] we want to avoid it
[1:31:21] oh he's got lots of ways you can put on
[1:31:23] a religious coat
[1:31:27] cover up the cowardness
[1:31:31] and let them
[1:31:32] take your mind
[1:31:34] but let me not forget this to remind you
[1:31:37] once again of this scripture let this
[1:31:39] mind be in you that was in christ jesus
[1:31:45] it's a test of strength
[1:31:52] and we
[1:31:53] were we have
[1:31:56] the test of strength
[1:32:01] we have the test of strength you have to
[1:32:04] you might not want to believe it
[1:32:08] but your strength
[1:32:10] in god's word
[1:32:13] is going to be put
[1:32:15] to the test
[1:32:17] because satan is a liar he's the father
[1:32:20] of all lies and he's an unbeliever
[1:32:24] he even tempted
[1:32:26] the lord of glory
[1:32:30] because he didn't believe
[1:32:33] it's the strength
[1:32:36] he goes on to say the indians used to
[1:32:38] have a contest of strength they called
[1:32:40] the tug of war
[1:32:42] and they used to pull one another
[1:32:44] through the fire
[1:32:48] he says but i want to speak
[1:32:50] for these minutes quickly
[1:32:53] upon the greatest contest
[1:32:55] there is
[1:32:58] it's between the church
[1:33:01] and
[1:33:02] satan
[1:33:04] i want to talk about the greatest
[1:33:06] contest there ever is it's between you
[1:33:10] the church
[1:33:11] and satan
[1:33:14] satan's after your mind
[1:33:16] god's after your mind
[1:33:24] and what's the curse of lady elsia
[1:33:26] it's what
[1:33:28] luke warm
[1:33:30] lukewarm is the mixture
[1:33:33] a lukewarm mind is a mixture
[1:33:36] between
[1:33:37] god's mind
[1:33:39] and satan's mind
[1:33:45] he says now this great this is paragraph
[1:33:49] and this great contest has been going on
[1:33:53] for many years
[1:33:56] it started in heaven
[1:33:58] and satan
[1:33:59] was kicked out
[1:34:01] into the earth
[1:34:03] and then he become an enemy to god's
[1:34:08] people
[1:34:10] and since then
[1:34:12] he's used all of his strength
[1:34:15] and his strategy to try to pull god's
[1:34:19] people across fire or in to his
[1:34:24] fire
[1:34:26] he's using all his strength
[1:34:28] all his strategy
[1:34:30] to pull you into his fire
[1:34:36] you know what he wants to make you
[1:34:38] servants
[1:34:39] in his kingdom
[1:34:41] all you are if you're in his hands is a
[1:34:44] block builder
[1:34:48] in satan's eden
[1:34:52] that's what the children of israel
[1:34:54] represented in bondage
[1:34:58] building a pharaoh kingdom and nowadays
[1:35:01] man is in the same bondage but they're
[1:35:04] building a kingdom to satan
[1:35:06] satan's eden
[1:35:08] the god of this evil age
[1:35:12] and before he can do that he's got to
[1:35:14] get your mind to his cause
[1:35:22] you can't get away from it
[1:35:25] you can be in denial
[1:35:30] but i understand that
[1:35:36] and then it goes down paragraphed elk he
[1:35:38] said
[1:35:39] and i know that's an old saying
[1:35:42] that people
[1:35:45] that it's an old saying and it's not
[1:35:49] so old neither but people don't believe
[1:35:52] in demons in this day
[1:35:58] i mean
[1:35:59] do you really
[1:36:01] consciously
[1:36:03] understand
[1:36:05] there there are real demon spirits
[1:36:09] we know of at least two hundred thousand
[1:36:12] thousand that were released and they re
[1:36:15] give you
[1:36:16] rivers euphrates
[1:36:18] to
[1:36:19] battle against who
[1:36:23] the bride
[1:36:28] is that feast of the trumpets i think
[1:36:30] that's in feasts of the trumpets isn't
[1:36:32] it
[1:36:35] just think of that so there's actually
[1:36:39] demons
[1:36:40] assigned to you
[1:36:44] to captivate your mind
[1:36:47] and to bring you into servitude
[1:36:51] to the king
[1:36:53] of the air
[1:36:55] the prince
[1:36:57] of this
[1:36:59] world
[1:37:02] now that's some scary stuff
[1:37:07] can you imagine you know you just think
[1:37:09] you're getting a great college degree
[1:37:13] you know what i mean you think you're
[1:37:14] you're you're doing all this stuff you
[1:37:16] got all this accomplishment you look
[1:37:18] back and say i got this house and i got
[1:37:20] this car and i got this and i got this
[1:37:23] money in my bank and i've done so well
[1:37:26] and i've got a little piece of paper on
[1:37:29] the wall that says i'm a master
[1:37:33] look if you've got that paper on the
[1:37:35] wall to you you might be a master of one
[1:37:37] i'm all for masters and doctorates and
[1:37:39] all those things are all wonderful but
[1:37:41] to me that's a lot of boredom
[1:37:47] that's a lot of hours reading
[1:37:50] it's a lot of hours sitting listening
[1:37:55] and it's usually about 12 years of your
[1:37:57] life
[1:38:01] but when it's all said and done
[1:38:06] what does it profit the man if he
[1:38:08] gaineth the whole world
[1:38:10] and loses his soul
[1:38:12] now i'm not trying to
[1:38:15] promote ignorance
[1:38:20] because there are some people that i've
[1:38:22] seen that are so dumb
[1:38:24] i wish they would have spent some time
[1:38:26] in school
[1:38:29] and i look at him and i think what are
[1:38:31] you thinking
[1:38:33] how do you think
[1:38:37] but let's just say he said they say
[1:38:39] there's no
[1:38:41] people say they don't believe in demons
[1:38:43] today
[1:38:44] but
[1:38:45] but the thing to do to my opinion is
[1:38:48] know your enemy
[1:38:50] and know your enemy and train
[1:38:53] for the contest
[1:38:56] that you're going to have when you meet
[1:38:59] him
[1:39:01] because you're going
[1:39:03] to
[1:39:04] meet him
[1:39:09] now
[1:39:11] how does he appear
[1:39:17] as an angel of light
[1:39:21] he's the kind priest
[1:39:23] he's such a good guy
[1:39:26] the prophet said he's a slicker
[1:39:30] he doesn't have horns in a pit
[1:39:32] a pitchfork and a fork and tongue
[1:39:36] he's a snicker
[1:39:39] surely you won't die
[1:39:42] you'll be god
[1:39:44] you'll be smart
[1:39:47] it'll be wonderful
[1:39:54] because you're going to meet him
[1:39:57] and know him
[1:39:59] know his know what his strength is
[1:40:03] then train for this contest when you
[1:40:07] meet him
[1:40:08] for it's one thing sure you're going to
[1:40:12] meet him and so you train
[1:40:15] for
[1:40:16] the contest
[1:40:18] now so
[1:40:19] with
[1:40:21] that in mind
[1:40:23] that we need to train for this enemy
[1:40:26] and we need to know what his strength is
[1:40:30] and what his tactic is
[1:40:33] then we can understand how is it
[1:40:38] and what method does he use
[1:40:42] to
[1:40:44] try to captivate
[1:40:47] our minds
[1:40:51] sounds like a science fiction movie
[1:40:52] doesn't it
[1:40:53] or a horror movie
[1:40:57] but he is
[1:40:59] he's trying to shoot his a spiritual
[1:41:01] electrodes
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:08] into your mind and get your thinking
[1:41:13] try to get
[1:41:14] fear
[1:41:16] is him getting your mind
[1:41:19] doubt is him getting your mind
[1:41:21] anxiety all these things are just satan
[1:41:26] trying to captivate your mind
[1:41:34] so let's just
[1:41:35] stop here for a moment
[1:41:38] and
[1:41:40] turn to the message
[1:41:42] and they'll play it
[1:41:44] on the board protests the conflict
[1:41:48] between
[1:41:52] god
[1:41:53] and satan
[1:41:56] the conflict
[1:41:58] the contest
[1:42:00] the strength
[1:42:02] and work and in this little portion he's
[1:42:05] going to talk about what satan uses
[1:42:08] and what god uses
[1:42:11] and
[1:42:12] do you understand that
[1:42:14] i believe
[1:42:16] that
[1:42:17] this virus and what's going on in the
[1:42:20] world politically and everything is now
[1:42:23] a great move of satan
[1:42:26] to get people's minds
[1:42:32] we think he's after our soul no if he
[1:42:35] gets your mind he has your soul
[1:42:42] what did he do he got people out of
[1:42:44] church
[1:42:45] cut off the lifeline of god's word
[1:42:49] and then he was able to get their minds
[1:42:53] you tell me how people that have a
[1:42:55] revelation
[1:42:57] of this message
[1:43:00] can all of a sudden lose their mind
[1:43:06] something transpired
[1:43:08] so let's listen
[1:43:10] and you
[1:43:12] we've already stood for our scripture
[1:43:13] reading
[1:43:14] so
[1:43:15] if you want to turn in your bibles to
[1:43:18] the scripture
[1:43:19] that the prophet of god is going to use
[1:43:21] is joshua 24
[1:43:24] 14 and 15.
[1:43:27] as we listened to just 21 minutes
[1:43:31] of this and we could go on farther on
[1:43:33] this but we want to quickly
[1:43:36] move into
[1:43:38] our small little point this morning as
[1:43:41] we listen to this foundation so remember
[1:43:43] as you listen to this satan's after your
[1:43:45] mind
[1:43:47] that's what the greatest battle is for
[1:43:50] your mind
[1:43:52] he wants to plant whatever seed he can
[1:43:56] in your thinking so let's just listen
[1:43:58] for this next 21 minutes and i hope this
[1:44:01] helps you this morning
[1:44:05] but you know i mean
[1:44:07] it
[1:44:08] yeah you know
[1:44:10] like paul said though i speak with the
[1:44:12] tongues of men and angels and
[1:44:14] understand all the mysteries
[1:44:17] and have not charity it profiteth me
[1:44:20] nothing
[1:44:21] and if i could say it this way we know
[1:44:23] what the mind of christ is right let
[1:44:26] every man look on the need of every
[1:44:28] other so what is it profit if we if we
[1:44:30] have all these great understandings of
[1:44:33] all these mysteries and don't have the
[1:44:35] mind
[1:44:37] of god's word
[1:44:38] so amen i just trust this is a blessing
[1:44:41] i i i thought well i could just read
[1:44:43] these but i don't think there's any
[1:44:45] better way to have it said
[1:44:47] than to hear
[1:44:49] the messenger say it so god bless you 21
[1:44:52] minutes it's not long try to stay awake
[1:44:56] try to listen try not to worry about
[1:44:58] your water bill it'll be there when you
[1:45:00] get home
[1:45:04] okay so
[1:45:05] hang tough for 21 minutes
[1:45:10] now we want to turn for just
[1:45:12] a few words
[1:45:14] tonight out of the bible
[1:45:16] found over in the book of joshua 24
[1:45:19] 14th
[1:45:21] verse and 15th verse i want to read from
[1:45:24] his word
[1:45:25] listen close to his word
[1:45:30] joshua 24 14-15
[1:45:34] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[1:45:37] him in sincerity and in truth
[1:45:42] and put away the gods which your father
[1:45:45] served on the other side of the flood
[1:45:50] and
[1:45:51] in egypt
[1:45:54] and
[1:45:55] serve ye the lord
[1:45:58] and if it seems evil unto you to serve
[1:46:01] the lord
[1:46:03] choose you this day whom you will serve
[1:46:08] whether the gods which your father
[1:46:10] served
[1:46:11] that were on the other side of the flood
[1:46:16] are the gods of the
[1:46:19] amorites
[1:46:20] in whose land you dwell
[1:46:23] but as for me and my house we'll serve
[1:46:26] the lord amen
[1:46:29] lord bless the reading of his scriptures
[1:46:34] i have
[1:46:35] some notes
[1:46:36] here that were like talk just a little
[1:46:38] bit from and i want to take a
[1:46:40] text tonight to call it
[1:46:43] the conflict
[1:46:45] the conflict between
[1:46:48] god and satan
[1:46:51] and
[1:46:53] just our
[1:46:53] teach it like a sunday school lesson
[1:46:56] but i've got
[1:46:57] several scriptures laying here
[1:47:00] um
[1:47:01] in eden
[1:47:03] god knew his enemy and all the attacks
[1:47:07] of his enemy
[1:47:10] a god is the infinite god
[1:47:14] and the infinite god
[1:47:17] is the perfection of the perfections
[1:47:20] he knew all things before they ever was
[1:47:24] and therefore
[1:47:26] if
[1:47:27] this infinite god
[1:47:30] could have
[1:47:33] looked forward and did and seen the end
[1:47:35] from the beginning
[1:47:38] and knew that he would have children on
[1:47:40] this earth
[1:47:42] his own blessed children
[1:47:46] don't you believe that he would provide
[1:47:48] for them the best that he could provide
[1:47:53] would not you tonight to your children
[1:47:55] that was helpless little fellows who
[1:47:57] can't take care of themselves
[1:48:00] don't you struggle and work
[1:48:02] and do everything that you can to
[1:48:05] provide the best that you can or able to
[1:48:08] provide for those children
[1:48:11] because you are a father
[1:48:14] a parent
[1:48:16] and if that being the
[1:48:19] the
[1:48:21] what i would say the
[1:48:24] the trueness
[1:48:26] and the thought
[1:48:28] of an earthly parent in parenthood
[1:48:32] originated in god because he was the
[1:48:34] first parent
[1:48:37] don't you think that god
[1:48:40] seeing what satan would be
[1:48:43] what satan would do
[1:48:46] he gave to his children
[1:48:50] and provided for them the best
[1:48:54] thing that could be provided for them to
[1:48:58] knowing what the enemies attacked would
[1:49:00] be god fortified his children
[1:49:06] we take the war
[1:49:08] when a general goes out to meet another
[1:49:11] general in war
[1:49:14] and uh this general
[1:49:16] if he's a real true citizen of this
[1:49:19] nation that he represents
[1:49:22] and he surely would be to be a general
[1:49:25] and uh
[1:49:26] the first thing he studies
[1:49:29] the enemy's
[1:49:31] attacks
[1:49:32] he knows
[1:49:33] what he's going to do how he's going to
[1:49:36] work
[1:49:37] because he kind of went over and spied
[1:49:40] out we got spies everywhere you know
[1:49:43] there's american spies in england
[1:49:45] there's american spies in france there's
[1:49:47] america and the german spies here and is
[1:49:50] no matter how friendly we are we still
[1:49:52] got
[1:49:54] spies and we're spying out some kind of
[1:49:58] a nuclear weapon then we find it take it
[1:50:01] back to the country then what it is they
[1:50:04] get ready when war does come they know
[1:50:07] how to attack their enemy
[1:50:11] and if we know god knew this great
[1:50:14] warfare was coming on between right and
[1:50:16] wrong
[1:50:17] and he knew what the enemy is going to
[1:50:19] do he know just exactly how to equip his
[1:50:22] people
[1:50:28] so
[1:50:29] if we notice
[1:50:32] the very
[1:50:33] first
[1:50:34] thing that god equipped his children was
[1:50:37] being infinite he knowed what it took to
[1:50:40] defeat satan
[1:50:42] any time any place anywhere on any
[1:50:44] conditions
[1:50:46] now he wouldn't say i'll give him
[1:50:48] something here
[1:50:50] and then a few years later i may study
[1:50:53] out something better to give them
[1:50:55] and uh then after a few years later like
[1:50:58] we in military force
[1:51:00] old bow and arrow and sledge
[1:51:02] rock hammer and then the next was a
[1:51:05] after the bow and arrow come the musket
[1:51:06] and after the musket come the
[1:51:08] springfield and and now the
[1:51:11] atomic weapons and things see we keep
[1:51:13] growing more but god at the beginning
[1:51:17] gave his children the atomic weapon
[1:51:21] because he's the infinite god
[1:51:24] now
[1:51:26] seeing there was going to be a conflict
[1:51:29] and there was going to be a battle
[1:51:32] god equipped his children with the right
[1:51:35] kind of ammunition
[1:51:38] right kind of a attack
[1:51:40] the right kind of everything that they
[1:51:43] had need of that would sweep them all
[1:51:45] the way from eden to the rapture amen
[1:51:48] what was it
[1:51:50] the word amen
[1:51:52] the word
[1:51:54] that's what defeats satan is the word
[1:51:58] it'll defeat him anywhere
[1:52:00] any place
[1:52:01] now why do we want to substitute
[1:52:03] something else
[1:52:04] when we've already got the best thing
[1:52:06] that there is
[1:52:09] the word
[1:52:11] and we find jesus on earth
[1:52:13] just to prove this was the best
[1:52:15] equipment when satan come and
[1:52:18] hand-to-hand combat with jesus
[1:52:22] he never just reached over with his
[1:52:24] power and tied his hands he just took
[1:52:26] the same weapon
[1:52:28] that god gave in the garden of eden his
[1:52:30] word and said it's written amen
[1:52:33] it's written
[1:52:34] and he punched him right out of the ring
[1:52:36] with it that's right
[1:52:38] because it's god's vest
[1:52:41] and look where it is it's not just for a
[1:52:44] one or two
[1:52:45] in a church it's for every one of us
[1:52:48] every believer
[1:52:50] has a right to take this word and fight
[1:52:52] the enemy anywhere you meet him
[1:52:54] anywhere you meet the enemy this word is
[1:52:57] what you have to use
[1:52:59] and jesus proved it when he come
[1:53:02] so he equipped his children with the
[1:53:04] word for their protection against the
[1:53:08] enemy when the all-out warfare comes
[1:53:11] into battles and uh setting a rate then
[1:53:14] there's only one thing a real soldier
[1:53:16] can use a real christian soldier that's
[1:53:18] thus saith the lord amen
[1:53:20] walk right out there and meet the enemy
[1:53:22] with the assurance that nothing
[1:53:25] thousand may fall at you right in ten
[1:53:27] thousandths at the left but it won't
[1:53:28] come naughty
[1:53:30] just remember that god
[1:53:32] made this
[1:53:34] statement and give this to his children
[1:53:36] that's the best that's ever been yet
[1:53:40] satan in eden when he first come to
[1:53:43] these attacks
[1:53:44] to attack the person
[1:53:47] knowing the children of god was
[1:53:50] fortified with this word
[1:53:53] satan attacked the word
[1:53:57] see
[1:53:58] he never attacked the bee
[1:54:00] he attacked the word first amen
[1:54:04] look at that sneaker
[1:54:06] lizard what he does today
[1:54:08] the first thing he can't lay it on
[1:54:10] saying well that's not a good person
[1:54:12] that's a good person see
[1:54:14] but the only thing he tries to do no
[1:54:16] matter how good the person is is to get
[1:54:18] him to deny that word amen that's the
[1:54:20] only thing he wants to do get you to
[1:54:22] deny that word
[1:54:25] so satan
[1:54:27] tried to
[1:54:28] to attack
[1:54:30] the word in the garden of eden so he had
[1:54:33] to have something now that he could use
[1:54:36] to
[1:54:37] to the human being would look better
[1:54:39] than that word
[1:54:42] see he had to have something that would
[1:54:44] look better to the human being than word
[1:54:47] and you know what he used
[1:54:49] reasoning
[1:54:51] just what would say common sense
[1:54:55] so that's what he used
[1:54:57] and he succeeded amen
[1:54:59] so that's what he's used all along
[1:55:03] but god can't give nothing else but his
[1:55:05] word
[1:55:06] because that's what he chose first and
[1:55:08] when god makes a decision it has to ever
[1:55:10] remain that way amen
[1:55:12] and satan took reasonings and took the
[1:55:15] reasonings and attacked the word and
[1:55:18] shook eve off the path
[1:55:21] that's right by reasonings human
[1:55:23] reasoning
[1:55:24] now
[1:55:25] the only way he she
[1:55:28] could uh got to disbelieve god's word it
[1:55:32] had to be appealing
[1:55:35] and satan knows how to make reasonings
[1:55:38] appealing
[1:55:40] it has to appeal to you
[1:55:42] and sin is very appealing
[1:55:45] and there's only one sin and that's
[1:55:46] unbelief
[1:55:48] so it's really appealing
[1:55:51] satan makes sin so appealing to you
[1:55:57] just stop in here for a few minutes i've
[1:56:00] often thought as a young man and
[1:56:02] read about
[1:56:04] uh different nations and the morals of
[1:56:07] the country and i'd heard different
[1:56:08] people tell me about
[1:56:10] especially
[1:56:12] down in france
[1:56:13] down in the place called pig alley
[1:56:16] and how that um
[1:56:18] the people were so immoral
[1:56:21] well i thought if i ever go in there
[1:56:23] i'll see them people down there
[1:56:27] women coming out you know
[1:56:29] rip a baits
[1:56:30] with such a old haggy
[1:56:33] look you know and
[1:56:35] mean
[1:56:37] and i
[1:56:38] went down in
[1:56:39] big alley the first night me and three
[1:56:41] more ministers
[1:56:43] brother what a surprise we got
[1:56:46] now satan's too smart for that
[1:56:49] he isn't going to produce something like
[1:56:51] that
[1:56:52] but some of the prettiest girls i ever
[1:56:54] seen in my life was there
[1:56:56] appealing
[1:56:59] certainly
[1:57:00] sin is appealing and attractive
[1:57:06] satan hasn't got a fork in hooves
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:12] and like that
[1:57:13] he is an old john barley corn out with
[1:57:16] coat hanging up
[1:57:18] and ears hanging down
[1:57:19] he's a slicker
[1:57:22] appealing
[1:57:25] sin isn't just rude like you think it is
[1:57:28] it's very appealing
[1:57:33] therefore we have to watch it close
[1:57:35] we'll just get to that in a little bit i
[1:57:37] thought of something else
[1:57:39] so
[1:57:39] uh
[1:57:40] how satan makes it looks so real it's
[1:57:44] appealing to them
[1:57:46] but
[1:57:47] if they would have just stayed fortified
[1:57:49] with the word
[1:57:52] let the word be their fortress
[1:57:56] then
[1:57:57] see
[1:57:57] if they've been fortified they've been
[1:58:00] behind the word
[1:58:04] the word would been in front of them
[1:58:05] always
[1:58:06] thus saith the lord
[1:58:08] thus saith the lord thus saith the lord
[1:58:11] right or left thus saith the lord like
[1:58:13] those angels down there that day when
[1:58:15] isaiah
[1:58:16] met in the temple he thought he was
[1:58:18] getting along pretty good a fairly good
[1:58:20] preacher
[1:58:21] the king liked him real well but the
[1:58:22] king was taken from him one day and he
[1:58:25] knelt at the altar and fell into a
[1:58:27] vision and saw angels
[1:58:29] with wings over their faces or their
[1:58:31] feet and flying with two wings a singing
[1:58:34] holy holy holy lord god almighty amen
[1:58:38] see
[1:58:39] every which away they went
[1:58:40] ezekiel saw
[1:58:42] the picture of the vision
[1:58:45] this way the spirit of god was moving it
[1:58:48] had the face of an ox
[1:58:51] this way it had the face of a line
[1:58:53] and everywhere it went it had a face
[1:58:57] every where it went it was
[1:59:00] 45. the word of god there's no way
[1:59:03] around
[1:59:04] fortified all the way around everywhere
[1:59:06] thus saith the lord just saith the lord
[1:59:10] you're walking you're talking your
[1:59:12] business you're associating everything
[1:59:14] but the word of god first amen
[1:59:19] so i believe i'll go tonight and um this
[1:59:22] little dance this won't hurt anybody
[1:59:24] could you take thus saith the lord with
[1:59:26] you
[1:59:29] i believe if i could pull this little
[1:59:31] deal it oh it's just a little bit shady
[1:59:33] but could you say thus saith the lord
[1:59:35] with it
[1:59:37] always take him first keep fortified for
[1:59:40] he is our fortress
[1:59:43] it's strange
[1:59:45] but do you know you have to ignore
[1:59:48] before
[1:59:51] in order to believe the devil's lie you
[1:59:54] have to ignore and deny god's truth
[1:59:57] first before you can believe the devil's
[1:59:58] lie amen
[2:00:01] do you ever think of that
[2:00:03] you have to deny the truth first before
[2:00:06] you can believe a lie
[2:00:08] amen right
[2:00:10] after the night
[2:00:12] eve got from behind it and lost the
[2:00:15] battle
[2:00:16] as soon as eve
[2:00:18] satan was standing out there
[2:00:20] shooting these targets
[2:00:22] she said but the lord said
[2:00:25] and then he shot again she said but the
[2:00:28] lord said
[2:00:31] so then he shot again another way but
[2:00:33] the lord said
[2:00:35] but satan raised up back there said but
[2:00:38] wait just a minute
[2:00:40] if the lord did say that let me just
[2:00:42] tell you something
[2:00:44] you see you're not wise like god
[2:00:47] you don't know right from wrong
[2:00:50] but if listen
[2:00:52] wouldn't you love to be wise like god
[2:00:56] why eve said it yes i i i believe i
[2:01:00] would maybe something like that i
[2:01:02] believe i would like to just know all
[2:01:04] the wisdom of god i like to know what's
[2:01:06] right and wrong i don't know it well i
[2:01:08] tell you
[2:01:09] now she said but but the lord said well
[2:01:11] but surely you know he's a good god he
[2:01:14] won't do that see
[2:01:15] right there she broke the hole through
[2:01:18] so he could shoot
[2:01:19] right there she made the wrong stop
[2:01:23] right there
[2:01:24] stopped a little bit
[2:01:27] now let me say something to you
[2:01:28] christians down here
[2:01:30] don't you never stop one second for the
[2:01:32] devil
[2:01:34] don't stop to reason it out when you
[2:01:36] start to reason it the devil comes right
[2:01:39] in
[2:01:39] you cannot reason god
[2:01:42] you cannot understand god
[2:01:44] you've got to just believe god
[2:01:47] okay
[2:01:49] i can't explain god nobody can
[2:01:51] i can't explain many things but the only
[2:01:54] thing i just believe it because he said
[2:01:56] so amen
[2:01:58] now there's none of us can explain it
[2:02:01] don't try to explain it don't get with
[2:02:03] these unbelievers and say well now look
[2:02:05] your pastor out there junior i hear him
[2:02:07] pray for the sick now y'all crazy down
[2:02:09] there there's no such thing as divine
[2:02:10] healing say all right there isn't for
[2:02:12] you then you're an unbeliever and just
[2:02:13] walk right on
[2:02:15] it's just for believers
[2:02:18] don't well you all say you got the holy
[2:02:20] ghost there's no such thing as holy
[2:02:21] ghost said it isn't for you than it is
[2:02:23] for me
[2:02:25] so you don't read don't try to reason it
[2:02:26] hasn't got no reasoning
[2:02:28] you just believe it you don't reason a
[2:02:31] thing because
[2:02:33] remember the only way that you can
[2:02:35] accept god is by faith amen not by
[2:02:39] reasons not by understanding not able to
[2:02:41] explain you don't explain nothing you
[2:02:43] believe something amen
[2:02:45] not what you feel jesus never said did
[2:02:48] you feel it he said did you believe it
[2:02:50] amen that's right you just believe what
[2:02:54] god said i can't explain to you how the
[2:02:57] how could a the greatest miracle i could
[2:02:59] think of is a man
[2:03:02] who is like take a pig
[2:03:04] and tell that pig you know
[2:03:06] you're no more pig
[2:03:08] you are a lamb and he becomes a lamb
[2:03:12] that'd be hard to believe well it's the
[2:03:14] same thing takes place when you become
[2:03:16] converted from a sinner to a christian
[2:03:19] see it changes your own opinions
[2:03:22] it changes your own will
[2:03:24] it changes everything that's in you
[2:03:27] and it brings you into another life and
[2:03:29] gives you another spirit that bears
[2:03:31] forth another record
[2:03:34] see
[2:03:35] then your old life has to die
[2:03:37] and the new one has to be born again
[2:03:40] and then see you're no more the creature
[2:03:43] you was at all
[2:03:45] that's when you become behind the blood
[2:03:48] fortified with the word don't try to
[2:03:50] explain nothing just believe it and go
[2:03:53] on
[2:03:54] lord i believe savior raise my faith in
[2:03:58] thee till it can move them out amen the
[2:04:00] heart i believe for all my doubts are
[2:04:02] buried in the fountain
[2:04:11] that's good isn't it
[2:04:16] but we we just wanted to
[2:04:20] brush on that for just a second so that
[2:04:23] we we under
[2:04:25] we understood
[2:04:26] that this is what the conflict is
[2:04:30] in the battle in your mind
[2:04:33] right is what god said
[2:04:36] versus what
[2:04:37] reasoning
[2:04:41] common sense
[2:04:45] and earth what's he trying to get you to
[2:04:46] do
[2:04:48] to think the way that he thinks i
[2:04:50] thought this one statement
[2:04:52] was was pretty uh
[2:04:55] phenomenal if if i could just
[2:04:59] grab it here for you again real quick it
[2:05:01] says now
[2:05:03] the only way
[2:05:05] that he she could have got to disbelief
[2:05:08] god's word
[2:05:10] is it had to be appealing
[2:05:13] satan knows how to make reasoning
[2:05:17] appealing
[2:05:20] in other words he knows how to make
[2:05:21] reasoning make sense
[2:05:24] it only makes sense it makes sense
[2:05:27] now do you remember what the very first
[2:05:29] tactic that he used to do surely he's a
[2:05:32] good god he won't do that
[2:05:38] you know they forget
[2:05:40] the mark of the beast
[2:05:43] all those good people out there surely
[2:05:45] they're good people they love the lord
[2:05:49] surely god's not going to judge him
[2:05:51] because they cut their hair
[2:05:53] surely god's not going to judge him
[2:05:55] because they paint their faith surely
[2:05:57] god's not going to judge him because
[2:05:59] they wear pants and they wear shorts and
[2:06:01] they put on bikinis and they go mix
[2:06:04] bathing together he's such a good god
[2:06:09] the same lie
[2:06:11] that he told in the beginning did you
[2:06:14] hear what he said he said satan used
[2:06:17] that in the beginning and it worked
[2:06:23] and because it's worked he's used it
[2:06:25] ever since
[2:06:28] now god but knowing right what was
[2:06:31] coming
[2:06:32] in other words god knowing what we would
[2:06:35] be up against
[2:06:41] what did he do
[2:06:45] i could just run around this church
[2:06:46] right now
[2:06:48] what did he do he restored the weapon
[2:06:55] what did he send
[2:06:57] elijah for
[2:07:00] to restore back
[2:07:03] the faith of the children
[2:07:07] he knew what the battle was going to be
[2:07:09] he knew what he was taking him to he
[2:07:12] knew that he was gonna pull him across
[2:07:14] the fire he knew that he was gonna build
[2:07:16] an eden that he was gonna become the god
[2:07:19] of this evil age he knew that people
[2:07:21] would be worshiping him thinking that
[2:07:24] they were worshiping god blind miserable
[2:07:27] poor wretched naked and not know it
[2:07:36] how are they going to fight
[2:07:41] how are they going to fight this
[2:07:45] he came in beast after beast
[2:07:47] he took him to the dark ages now he's
[2:07:50] got his mark
[2:07:51] and he's putting it on his forehead
[2:07:56] i know people that go to other churches
[2:07:58] that's fine but what they don't know is
[2:08:01] they're sitting under trinitarian
[2:08:03] doctrine
[2:08:05] that allows them never deceive jesus as
[2:08:08] a kinsmen redeemer
[2:08:13] what did jesus defeat satan with
[2:08:16] the word
[2:08:19] he didn't use anything else
[2:08:22] but the word
[2:08:24] who really when you look at it what what
[2:08:26] this why did he open the seals the seals
[2:08:29] was nothing but the revealing of the son
[2:08:32] of perdition
[2:08:36] it showed him from his journey
[2:08:39] after the resurrection all down through
[2:08:41] the church how he took the church
[2:08:43] captive
[2:08:45] how he built systems
[2:08:48] how he took god's
[2:08:51] mind
[2:08:53] from the people
[2:08:57] what the battles for
[2:09:00] the battles
[2:09:02] the battles for him he that's why he he
[2:09:05] fortified him
[2:09:07] he fortified him in in the
[2:09:09] in the word because he knew he knew
[2:09:12] about the warfare that was coming
[2:09:16] so now we're in this warfare
[2:09:20] we're in this battle
[2:09:22] and i'd like just to close
[2:09:24] again
[2:09:26] reading
[2:09:27] a few more
[2:09:30] statements from
[2:09:32] the the message the contest
[2:09:35] now the contest is a
[2:09:38] test of strength
[2:09:43] right it's a test of uh of of strength
[2:09:47] so uh
[2:09:49] it's like taking our brother here he's a
[2:09:51] uh he gave up a famous
[2:09:54] basketball career he could have probably
[2:09:56] made the nba all-stars we might as well
[2:09:58] make it sound good right brother
[2:10:01] you know he had a college scholarship
[2:10:03] he's a son of god either went on to
[2:10:05] perfection no matter what he does
[2:10:08] but he gave that up
[2:10:10] but we could use basketball for an
[2:10:12] example
[2:10:15] now if he was playing basketball against
[2:10:18] silas here
[2:10:20] that wouldn't be much of a contest for
[2:10:22] you would it
[2:10:24] how would you like if that was your game
[2:10:26] every day
[2:10:29] you know what i mean i mean that would
[2:10:32] wouldn't prove you're a basketball
[2:10:33] player
[2:10:35] it'd prove you're like some kind of
[2:10:37] psycho bully
[2:10:44] that's no test of strength
[2:10:48] you know what i mean it's like you know
[2:10:51] it it would be no
[2:10:54] test of strength for me to get in the
[2:10:57] boxing ring with uh uh
[2:11:00] brother chris harris you know who
[2:11:02] benches 450 pounds and okay that would
[2:11:06] that would be no strength come on chris
[2:11:15] i mean
[2:11:18] i mean it wouldn't be a contest
[2:11:22] right
[2:11:23] it wouldn't be
[2:11:24] it wouldn't be anything i mean if the
[2:11:26] basketball hoop was only this tall
[2:11:30] you know i could dunk it
[2:11:35] but it makes a difference when it's 10
[2:11:37] feet tall
[2:11:40] and i ain't no
[2:11:41] web
[2:11:44] you know you know who he is i'm glad you
[2:11:46] don't
[2:11:47] he was only four foot eight or five foot
[2:11:50] two and could dunk it so
[2:11:54] but i want to point out something to you
[2:11:58] is that
[2:12:00] if it's going to be a battle in a test
[2:12:02] of strength
[2:12:06] you understand
[2:12:07] then
[2:12:09] there's got to be if it's a test of
[2:12:11] strength then it's got to be equally
[2:12:15] it's got to be an equal challenge
[2:12:19] i read the article about
[2:12:22] uh
[2:12:24] professional
[2:12:26] athletes
[2:12:27] and
[2:12:28] and
[2:12:29] and
[2:12:30] why that
[2:12:32] there's such a a
[2:12:34] a desire in them to compete
[2:12:38] in
[2:12:39] the olympics
[2:12:41] and every year the olympics becomes a
[2:12:44] political thing
[2:12:45] we're going to boycott the olympics
[2:12:47] we're not going to send our athletes you
[2:12:49] know
[2:12:50] like
[2:12:52] the athletes don't care
[2:12:55] they want the test
[2:12:59] they want the challenge
[2:13:03] of proving that they're the best
[2:13:07] they train
[2:13:09] for it
[2:13:10] they train for the challenge they change
[2:13:13] for the contest
[2:13:15] they
[2:13:16] they train
[2:13:17] to for so that they can have the proof
[2:13:24] of the ability
[2:13:26] that they possess
[2:13:30] and with with with a basket only four
[2:13:33] feet tall
[2:13:35] and uh
[2:13:36] fighting uh uh a a little fella there's
[2:13:40] no challenge in that there's no contest
[2:13:43] in that there's no way to prove
[2:13:46] that you have any ability
[2:13:48] that you possess any talent
[2:13:52] that you have any strength that you're
[2:13:55] up for the challenge
[2:13:57] they say pro golfers now are becoming
[2:14:00] bored with the sport
[2:14:04] because there's not enough challenge in
[2:14:08] for it anymore
[2:14:10] they're tired of low scores
[2:14:15] those guys they
[2:14:17] they have a certain score and they hit
[2:14:19] 12 14 18
[2:14:21] points below it that they they say we
[2:14:24] need a way to make it more difficult
[2:14:28] more challenging
[2:14:31] because
[2:14:32] there's no longer a test
[2:14:36] there's nothing there to push them
[2:14:39] to the next level
[2:14:44] if you knew you were going up against
[2:14:45] somebody that was
[2:14:47] all league and all national and really
[2:14:50] good you'd study him you'd look at his
[2:14:52] move you watch his game that's what the
[2:14:54] pros do right they go there and they
[2:14:56] look at he says that's what a general
[2:14:58] does he studies the tactics
[2:15:03] let me ask you
[2:15:06] honestly
[2:15:08] how many of you have studied the tactics
[2:15:10] of the enemy lately
[2:15:18] how many of you got out of your car in
[2:15:20] the parking lot starting to head to the
[2:15:22] school and say i wonder what satan's
[2:15:24] going to throw on me today
[2:15:30] what's his tactics what's it been to use
[2:15:34] how is he going to meet me
[2:15:36] where's his trap
[2:15:40] it's there
[2:15:42] but then
[2:15:44] without the challenge
[2:15:48] without with with
[2:15:50] without
[2:15:53] if i could say this in equal
[2:15:56] and
[2:15:57] opposite strength
[2:16:00] there becomes no test of strength
[2:16:03] so in the arm wrestling
[2:16:05] between
[2:16:07] our brother and our little brother
[2:16:10] there would be no test of strength there
[2:16:13] now me and silas might be a test of
[2:16:16] strength
[2:16:23] i want you to understand that
[2:16:27] now let's go back to what we heard
[2:16:29] god knew in the beginning
[2:16:33] what the attack of the enemy would be
[2:16:38] so he provided for them the very best
[2:16:41] that he could
[2:16:45] in other words he provided for them
[2:16:48] something that would bring them
[2:16:51] to the same strength level
[2:16:57] of whom that they were battling
[2:17:04] because if he didn't
[2:17:07] they would fail
[2:17:09] so he had to restore
[2:17:12] back to the believer
[2:17:15] their weapon
[2:17:18] which was the weapon that he gave them
[2:17:20] in the first place
[2:17:22] but they had left that through reasoning
[2:17:29] they kept reasoning the word out they
[2:17:32] kept reasoning parts of the word out
[2:17:34] they kept tearing pages of the bible out
[2:17:37] because they didn't fit the days of
[2:17:39] miracles have passed that was for them
[2:17:41] there's no such god doesn't care whether
[2:17:44] you do live a certain way he doesn't
[2:17:46] care about this they drank in the bible
[2:17:48] you know what i mean they did this
[2:17:53] tearing pages out why the new age bible
[2:17:57] now is no bigger than this
[2:18:02] i had a man tell me we don't read the
[2:18:04] old testament
[2:18:07] well
[2:18:08] the old testament is the description of
[2:18:11] jesus
[2:18:14] how can you throw out the old testament
[2:18:16] and he said search the scriptures
[2:18:17] because they would speak about me
[2:18:20] in other words it's just like these
[2:18:21] people they say they do it but if they
[2:18:24] read it they wouldn't be doing what they
[2:18:26] do how can you throw out the old
[2:18:28] testament when jesus said search it
[2:18:32] they've left the what
[2:18:34] they've left the word
[2:18:41] so in closing this morning
[2:18:53] we
[2:18:56] see if i can find
[2:19:07] i'd like to say this in closing this
[2:19:09] morning
[2:19:10] because i want you to understand
[2:19:13] that
[2:19:14] about this battle
[2:19:17] that we're in now
[2:19:21] and how he knew it was coming
[2:19:24] and how it's destroying the church
[2:19:27] how it's how people are falling away
[2:19:30] because they got out of fellowship
[2:19:33] they got out of hearing the gospel
[2:19:36] why why church why preachers it's not
[2:19:39] you can listen to tapes at home and you
[2:19:41] know i believe it and i believe in us
[2:19:43] listening to tapes together
[2:19:46] and i believe in you reading your bible
[2:19:48] and i believe in us reading it together
[2:19:51] but we come to be
[2:19:53] so that the holy spirit can bring us in
[2:19:57] remembrance of those things which were
[2:19:59] sad so you can hear the word of god to
[2:20:02] fight your battle
[2:20:06] a body fitted and joined together but
[2:20:09] when you break away from the body and
[2:20:11] say you're no more of the body then that
[2:20:14] body's no more speaking to you
[2:20:17] and what starts to happen in your mind
[2:20:20] reasoning
[2:20:25] because there's not
[2:20:27] a present tense spirit
[2:20:30] challenging your thinking
[2:20:33] challenging your life choices
[2:20:36] exposing this
[2:20:38] the enemy
[2:20:40] that is after your mind
[2:20:45] that's what he's after he's after the
[2:20:46] way you think
[2:20:48] you get a thought going you get thinking
[2:20:50] going you come to church you come to
[2:20:52] church as an honest believer listening
[2:20:55] and you've got all this stuff going on
[2:20:57] in your head the preacher comes out he
[2:21:00] don't know what's going on in your life
[2:21:01] but also he's got this word
[2:21:04] and so he starts preaching the word he
[2:21:06] starts pointing to you what the word
[2:21:08] said he starts talking about the message
[2:21:10] reminding you who you are now you've got
[2:21:13] a voice against the voice
[2:21:21] and what would he say this is the voice
[2:21:24] of god to you this is the voice of the
[2:21:27] last day
[2:21:31] it was to restore
[2:21:33] in you
[2:21:34] the weapon
[2:21:39] not a watered-down version
[2:21:43] but the spoken word
[2:21:46] was the original seed
[2:21:49] something that would hit that gene
[2:21:52] part of you that's god in you
[2:21:57] and bring you to the battle
[2:22:02] it never was the escape
[2:22:06] of the war
[2:22:11] people and that brother graham said he
[2:22:12] said oh once you become a christian the
[2:22:14] devil no
[2:22:16] he says i know there's a devil i fight
[2:22:18] him every day
[2:22:20] well let's just close
[2:22:24] with
[2:22:26] this this morning
[2:22:28] and
[2:22:29] i i i trust that it will finally bring
[2:22:32] to you
[2:22:35] what the point of it is
[2:22:37] that we are in it
[2:22:40] it's on
[2:22:43] it's his tactic
[2:22:45] this virus has caused everybody to start
[2:22:48] rethinking
[2:22:50] everything
[2:22:56] reinvent reasoning
[2:22:59] reinvent thought
[2:23:01] reinvent our country reinvent the world
[2:23:05] reinvent rethink we've got to rethink
[2:23:08] this
[2:23:09] no you don't have to rethink you've got
[2:23:11] to quit thinking
[2:23:14] that's your problem
[2:23:16] you think too much
[2:23:20] you ever meet everybody overthinks
[2:23:22] everything
[2:23:25] i'm the worst person to know if you
[2:23:26] overthink everything because i make
[2:23:28] random statements
[2:23:32] and you'll dwell for days what did he
[2:23:34] mean by that what did he think about
[2:23:36] this did i do something wrong you can't
[2:23:38] remember how many apologies i get i'm
[2:23:41] thinking what
[2:23:43] did i offend you
[2:23:47] now i'm running around
[2:23:49] what did i do
[2:23:50] what did i do
[2:23:52] oh my goodness what did i say
[2:23:54] did i do it again i know i couldn't i
[2:23:57] can't imagine what it is and i'm always
[2:24:00] i'm in all in this thing why because
[2:24:02] reasoning breeds what
[2:24:04] reasoning
[2:24:06] it is the plague
[2:24:15] it was to get us to rethink everything
[2:24:18] rethink divine healing rethink laying on
[2:24:21] of hands
[2:24:24] well the only ministries that that uh
[2:24:28] really grew during this pandemic was the
[2:24:30] brothers who had six foot arms
[2:24:42] how long is your arm
[2:24:44] because i need someone to lay hands on
[2:24:46] me
[2:24:50] you know i i might be saying it
[2:24:53] lightheartedly
[2:24:55] but how many ever considered that
[2:24:57] satan's trying to get changed the way
[2:24:59] you think
[2:25:03] he's succeeding
[2:25:06] he's succeeding in the message
[2:25:10] these guys falling away
[2:25:15] was well instrumented
[2:25:18] by satan
[2:25:21] he knew they weren't believers
[2:25:24] he knew they didn't have seed
[2:25:27] but the scripture said they'll come in
[2:25:29] amongst you
[2:25:32] but there are spots
[2:25:34] in your feast
[2:25:38] and then they fall back and what's all
[2:25:40] they got to say reason reason reason
[2:25:44] reasoning try to figure the cloud out
[2:25:46] try to figure this out
[2:25:48] try to figure
[2:25:52] to figure
[2:25:55] that out try to figure all these things
[2:25:57] things out but now listen to this
[2:26:01] now the enemy is going to study our
[2:26:03] strategy
[2:26:05] with the word
[2:26:08] he's going to study our strategy with
[2:26:11] the word
[2:26:12] now that's what he's going to fight
[2:26:14] right he never attacks you as a person
[2:26:18] he attacks the word
[2:26:21] what if the prophet god said satan's
[2:26:24] whole
[2:26:25] journey
[2:26:26] is to discredit
[2:26:28] god's word
[2:26:30] it can't be the same that it was 2 000
[2:26:33] years ago we're not the same the word
[2:26:35] can't be sane we progressed the word has
[2:26:38] to be progressed you don't think they
[2:26:40] think the word got to progress how many
[2:26:42] bibles are there now
[2:26:45] the new living hippie bible
[2:26:49] you know the the new
[2:26:51] you know the new living this the the old
[2:26:54] traditional the mild traditional
[2:26:57] the bible without any of these or the
[2:26:58] outs you know
[2:27:00] the there's the what they call the
[2:27:02] female bible where every place is she
[2:27:05] instead of he
[2:27:08] god's neither male nor female how
[2:27:11] ignorant
[2:27:13] can man be
[2:27:18] oh you don't think you're ignorant where
[2:27:19] do you think you've learned everything
[2:27:21] you know from
[2:27:23] some other ignorant man before you
[2:27:30] and the only reason he's teaching you
[2:27:32] anything to begin with is so you can
[2:27:35] keep his kingdom going
[2:27:41] he's got the whole world tied together
[2:27:43] now
[2:27:48] we always wondered how is satan going to
[2:27:50] rule the earth
[2:27:53] science
[2:27:55] education
[2:28:00] everybody
[2:28:03] has got a phone
[2:28:06] and has got their face in it
[2:28:12] i saw a news thing where something on
[2:28:14] youtube went to 10
[2:28:17] billion
[2:28:20] what do they call it hits
[2:28:23] is that what it's called a hit views
[2:28:27] 10 billion views
[2:28:30] i i forget that's five times the number
[2:28:33] that means every person on earth
[2:28:35] has heard it
[2:28:37] five times
[2:28:43] [Music]
[2:28:52] i bet you everyone in here knows the
[2:28:54] baby shark
[2:28:56] and the mommy shark and the daddy shark
[2:28:59] you know what the best part about the
[2:29:01] whole song is is the truth of it run
[2:29:12] oh you don't think he's getting our
[2:29:13] minds
[2:29:17] why do you think he came back to restore
[2:29:21] the
[2:29:22] weapon
[2:29:29] now the enemy is going to study our
[2:29:31] strategy
[2:29:33] with the word
[2:29:34] and now satan studies
[2:29:36] that all out so perfectly
[2:29:39] tell when he come to eve he had the best
[2:29:42] strategy he could use upon her
[2:29:46] and that was to reason with the word
[2:29:50] now i hope you get this right here
[2:29:53] to reason with the word now you never
[2:29:56] want to reason with god's word
[2:29:59] just believe it
[2:30:01] don't try to explain it
[2:30:03] don't try to figure it out
[2:30:05] you can't figure out god
[2:30:08] so god is the word
[2:30:11] and it's made
[2:30:13] to
[2:30:14] believe
[2:30:16] here
[2:30:18] eat this box of kleenex for me
[2:30:22] well it's not made to eat
[2:30:27] you know eat eat this pen
[2:30:31] it'll make you sick
[2:30:34] it's not made
[2:30:36] to eat
[2:30:38] it wasn't made that way
[2:30:43] i mean can i can that
[2:30:45] set in
[2:30:47] god never made it
[2:30:50] to where it could be reasoned
[2:30:54] he never made it where it could be
[2:30:57] figured out
[2:30:58] he never made it where you could take
[2:31:01] your mind and make any sense of it
[2:31:06] because the word of god doesn't
[2:31:09] make sense
[2:31:14] why did he choose me
[2:31:21] you've heard my testimony but you don't
[2:31:22] know my life
[2:31:24] i can't testify how bad my life was
[2:31:28] because the scripture says don't even
[2:31:30] speak of those things which are done in
[2:31:32] darkness
[2:31:38] it's not made
[2:31:42] to reason
[2:31:45] he says it's only made to believe the
[2:31:48] only way you can get it to work
[2:31:51] is to believe it
[2:31:53] you can't figure it out it don't make
[2:31:55] sense
[2:31:56] it just don't make sense
[2:32:01] it's made to believe and that's our
[2:32:04] strength
[2:32:08] so if it's going to be a test of
[2:32:10] strength
[2:32:10] he had to restore our weapon
[2:32:13] because that is our strength
[2:32:17] it's the only way we're going to be able
[2:32:19] to fight them
[2:32:20] just accept the word and anyone knows
[2:32:24] that a seed in the right kind of ground
[2:32:28] will produce its kind and we just take
[2:32:32] the
[2:32:33] word
[2:32:35] so we see that the word
[2:32:38] isn't made
[2:32:41] to be thought through
[2:32:44] there's no elements in it
[2:32:48] that connect with the mind
[2:32:55] and now we can see when men have taken
[2:32:57] the word
[2:32:59] and connected it with their mind what
[2:33:02] did they come up with 900 different
[2:33:04] denominations three gods two gods
[2:33:10] all kinds of stuff because the word is
[2:33:13] not made to reason
[2:33:17] it's only made to believe it because he
[2:33:20] said it
[2:33:21] you can't even figure out how is he
[2:33:24] going to do it
[2:33:30] i don't know
[2:33:32] but he what said so
[2:33:37] so in this great hour that we're living
[2:33:39] in
[2:33:40] where satan's after our minds trying to
[2:33:43] get us to think all this stuff out god
[2:33:46] is trying to restore back to us our
[2:33:48] weapon
[2:33:52] he says what is it this is paragraph 30
[2:33:54] out of the contest
[2:33:58] and the paragraph i just got finished
[2:34:00] reading was paragraph 15.
[2:34:02] what is it
[2:34:03] it's actually a power
[2:34:06] god is a power
[2:34:08] and satan is satan
[2:34:11] reasoning is a power
[2:34:14] so if you take reasoning you take the
[2:34:18] power
[2:34:19] that reasoning gives you
[2:34:22] and those who have good reasoning and
[2:34:24] can reason begin to have power over
[2:34:27] other people's minds
[2:34:31] reasoning is contagious
[2:34:34] so if i'm after your mind and i come
[2:34:36] with reasoning and you accept my
[2:34:39] reasoning now you are going to pass on
[2:34:43] my reasoning
[2:34:46] what's the reason you guys do this
[2:34:52] and you track it all the way back to the
[2:34:54] beginning and you'll find out it was
[2:34:56] someone that didn't know nothing in the
[2:34:58] first place
[2:35:02] oh you re you did do you hear me
[2:35:06] reasoning's the plague
[2:35:09] that's what came with coven 19
[2:35:13] reasoning
[2:35:15] insane reasoning
[2:35:18] nuts
[2:35:21] insane
[2:35:25] the whole world's gone insane
[2:35:28] reasoning came up with it all kinds of
[2:35:31] reasonings but what was the answer to
[2:35:33] colvin 19
[2:35:36] i've got it
[2:35:40] it's the word of god
[2:35:47] it is
[2:35:49] but what did he want to do he wanted us
[2:35:51] to forsake ourselves assembling together
[2:35:53] we did everything we reasoned it out we
[2:35:56] thought well we'll be a good neighbor
[2:35:58] we'll just let you know we'll just abide
[2:36:00] by them for we which we thought was just
[2:36:03] a couple weeks and everything and time
[2:36:06] we finally figured out they're pulling
[2:36:08] one over on us
[2:36:12] separating us from one another
[2:36:15] separating us from fellowship
[2:36:19] don't worry if the lord allows us to
[2:36:21] build the new church we will have a
[2:36:23] quarantine area
[2:36:31] you're not allowed in it
[2:36:35] i've already seen what god's done for
[2:36:37] you so you can't get away with no excuse
[2:36:39] like that
[2:36:42] what is it it's actually a power god is
[2:36:45] a power and satan and satan is satan
[2:36:48] if you don't believe in the devil when i
[2:36:51] first got started i run headlong into
[2:36:53] him every day
[2:36:55] don't tell me there's no devil
[2:36:57] because i know better i have to fight
[2:37:00] with him every day
[2:37:03] so i know there's a devil
[2:37:06] and you must be trained when you meet
[2:37:09] him
[2:37:10] not trained in psychology
[2:37:13] not trained in education
[2:37:16] but trained by the holy spirit
[2:37:24] god's
[2:37:26] power
[2:37:29] in his word
[2:37:31] to make it manifest
[2:37:34] know your enemy
[2:37:36] you must be trained in god's power
[2:37:40] to make it manifest
[2:37:43] you know that's corinthians ii
[2:37:45] corinthians
[2:37:46] 3 16.
[2:37:49] let me just
[2:37:51] read that to you
[2:37:53] for a
[2:37:54] a quick
[2:37:55] uh
[2:37:57] reading here
[2:37:58] real quick 3 16.
[2:38:04] did i get it second corinthians
[2:38:06] yeah
[2:38:07] 3 16. well i thought it was second
[2:38:10] corinthians 3 16.
[2:38:12] maybe not
[2:38:14] well
[2:38:15] it's not i must have wrote it down wrong
[2:38:17] but anyway the scripture says that we we
[2:38:20] fight spiritual wickedness in high
[2:38:23] places and
[2:38:24] like oh i just got to have that
[2:38:26] scripture i don't know what i did with
[2:38:27] it where are you my scripture
[2:38:30] i know you're here somewhere
[2:38:33] i i wrote it down here
[2:38:35] uh
[2:38:36] well
[2:38:37] typical
[2:38:39] i'm not totally senile yet but
[2:38:42] i'm getting close
[2:38:46] but he says the letter killeth
[2:38:49] but the spirit
[2:38:51] giveth life
[2:38:55] so it's the revealed word
[2:38:59] that is the power the spirit word
[2:39:02] is the power
[2:39:04] that we've got to be trained in
[2:39:07] the power of god's spirit
[2:39:10] to make the word
[2:39:12] manifest
[2:39:16] i don't know if i can let that sink in
[2:39:19] but you've got to be trained
[2:39:22] in knowing that there's a power
[2:39:25] a spirit in the word
[2:39:29] it's the spirit
[2:39:31] power in the word to make it manifest
[2:39:36] so we're not trained by the word alone
[2:39:39] as letter
[2:39:44] we're trained with i sav
[2:39:48] that we can see the power of god's word
[2:39:52] making it manifest
[2:39:55] god allowed satan to do what he's doing
[2:39:58] so he could make his word
[2:40:00] manifest he allowed satan to do what he
[2:40:03] could do so he could provide a challenge
[2:40:07] of strength
[2:40:10] to the church
[2:40:14] to prove
[2:40:16] that she was
[2:40:18] this elect lady
[2:40:24] to prove to you
[2:40:26] that you're a christian
[2:40:28] that you're a believer
[2:40:30] that you can say no
[2:40:32] you can't be deceived he can't talk you
[2:40:35] into anything
[2:40:38] this eve
[2:40:40] will not
[2:40:41] listen
[2:40:48] the spirit killeth
[2:40:51] he said the letter killeth but the
[2:40:53] spirit giveth life
[2:40:57] the the spirit
[2:40:59] that makes the word real
[2:41:02] how many know and see how real this
[2:41:05] message is
[2:41:08] he says now i i would like to stand here
[2:41:11] now and lay into that and go back
[2:41:13] through the bible and show you man back
[2:41:17] there
[2:41:18] this paragraph 31
[2:41:21] who come face to face with
[2:41:24] how in the contest against the enemy
[2:41:27] they fortified themselves by the word of
[2:41:30] god
[2:41:31] noah
[2:41:32] had an experience of it
[2:41:35] and he knew that god told him it was
[2:41:38] going to rain
[2:41:41] and the contest was on between science
[2:41:46] and the word of god
[2:41:47] science says it can't happen
[2:41:50] god said
[2:41:52] it will
[2:41:53] amen
[2:41:57] you don't think there was a battle going
[2:41:58] on in noah's
[2:42:00] mind
[2:42:03] the same thing exists today
[2:42:06] it will happen
[2:42:09] it does happen
[2:42:10] there is a devil
[2:42:12] jesus cast them out
[2:42:14] and he gave his church authority to do
[2:42:17] so
[2:42:19] cast out devils in my name
[2:42:22] he cast seven devils out of a pretty
[2:42:24] woman one day he said when the unclean
[2:42:28] spirit is gone out of a man he walks in
[2:42:31] dry places
[2:42:32] returning back then
[2:42:35] bringing seven other devils with him
[2:42:40] now let's just put the devil
[2:42:42] and use another word there reasons
[2:42:47] he brings seven other reasonings
[2:42:53] how many times god told us not to do
[2:42:55] something
[2:42:58] we know it's not right we know what the
[2:42:59] word said and then he gives a reason
[2:43:03] and you cast that reason out
[2:43:06] and here he comes
[2:43:08] with seven better reasons
[2:43:13] all these other little voices
[2:43:17] oh you got to look back at the history
[2:43:20] of it
[2:43:21] you know and and and this and i i'll
[2:43:24] just say it like this it's just like
[2:43:26] this brother ram told the story of the
[2:43:28] guy who picked up the snake
[2:43:30] because it was cold
[2:43:32] and he put the snake in his pocket
[2:43:35] and when he got warm and everything he
[2:43:38] reached in his pocket to let the snake
[2:43:40] out and the snake bit him
[2:43:44] and he said snake i saved your life why
[2:43:48] did you bite me
[2:43:50] and he said you knew i was a snake
[2:43:54] when you put me
[2:43:56] in your pocket
[2:43:59] but what took place
[2:44:01] poor little snake he's cold
[2:44:04] i'll put the steak in my pocket surely
[2:44:07] he'll appreciate
[2:44:09] all that i've done for him
[2:44:16] you invite a thief into your house
[2:44:19] you know he's a thief
[2:44:21] and in your mind you think you're going
[2:44:23] to reform him
[2:44:27] he'll rob you
[2:44:30] he's a thief to begin with
[2:44:33] he was made a thief
[2:44:36] and the only way he won't become a thief
[2:44:39] is when he hears
[2:44:41] the word
[2:44:43] of god
[2:44:45] and it transforms him from a thief
[2:44:49] from a pig
[2:44:51] to a lamb
[2:44:54] but until the miracle
[2:44:56] he's a thief let us read on
[2:44:59] the same thing exists today
[2:45:01] but jesus cast the seven deals out he
[2:45:03] said and when an unclean spirit is god
[2:45:06] on mount he walks in dry places
[2:45:08] returning back
[2:45:09] and brings back seven other devils with
[2:45:11] him now that goes to show
[2:45:15] that if a man was claimed of devils
[2:45:19] there was something was in him had gone
[2:45:22] out
[2:45:25] a devil had gone out now
[2:45:30] when the devil moved out
[2:45:34] that gives god an opportunity to move in
[2:45:40] so when he goes out
[2:45:43] let the holy spirit
[2:45:45] come in
[2:45:47] don't just leave it there
[2:45:53] see reasoning that's where he starts
[2:45:55] reasoning right there all you don't need
[2:45:57] anymore
[2:46:00] i'm gone don't worry about me
[2:46:03] and it's him doing all the talking
[2:46:08] if you do
[2:46:10] just repent of your sins
[2:46:13] and go on
[2:46:15] then you're going to be worse off
[2:46:17] than ever
[2:46:19] but get that place where satan once
[2:46:22] lived in occupied get it filled with the
[2:46:25] holy spirit of god
[2:46:27] and then you'll have the strength of
[2:46:30] god's word in you
[2:46:33] manifested and cast out devils
[2:46:37] cast out reasoning
[2:46:39] every time you hear the word devil
[2:46:41] remember reasoning goes with it
[2:46:44] because that's his tactic
[2:46:47] that's what he always uses
[2:46:50] i'm talking this morning about the
[2:46:52] restoration
[2:46:53] of the weapon
[2:46:56] the respiration of god's thinking in his
[2:46:59] children
[2:47:03] this eve
[2:47:05] has got to get the same weapon that that
[2:47:08] eve had and use it
[2:47:14] she's got to stand against the reasoning
[2:47:19] so he's back
[2:47:22] disguised himself
[2:47:24] as the great medical deliverer
[2:47:28] of the world
[2:47:33] people say oh we're all in this together
[2:47:35] no we're not
[2:47:37] i ain't joining your pot
[2:47:44] my safety
[2:47:45] does not lie
[2:47:47] in this cd what is it
[2:47:50] center of d does he cdc
[2:47:53] yeah
[2:47:55] i got a good thought for that
[2:48:03] crooked devil center
[2:48:10] let the holy spirit come in don't just
[2:48:12] leave it there you'll be worse off than
[2:48:14] ever
[2:48:15] but get that place where satan once
[2:48:17] lived and occupied get it filled with
[2:48:19] the holy spirit of god and then you'll
[2:48:21] have strength of god's word in you
[2:48:23] manifested and cast out devils the
[2:48:27] contest is on
[2:48:29] the evening lights are shining
[2:48:33] god's holy spirit is present
[2:48:37] and now it's just about three minutes
[2:48:39] until time
[2:48:41] that the whistles are going to blow
[2:48:43] it'll be midnight how many remembers he
[2:48:46] called this age three minutes to
[2:48:47] midnight
[2:48:50] let's leave the building and go our
[2:48:52] different places
[2:48:54] and our homes
[2:48:56] and meet outside and meet the world
[2:48:59] let's not go as we have in former times
[2:49:03] let us go in the power of his
[2:49:06] resurrection
[2:49:07] let us go with the same power that
[2:49:10] raised him from the dead
[2:49:13] where was that power
[2:49:16] where was the power that raised him from
[2:49:19] the dead it was in the scripture that
[2:49:22] said i shall not let my holy one see
[2:49:25] corruption
[2:49:30] jesus went to the grave
[2:49:33] knowing
[2:49:35] that the word said
[2:49:37] that he would not let his holy one seek
[2:49:40] corruption
[2:49:43] that's why he could say destroy this
[2:49:45] temple and in three days i'll raise it
[2:49:48] up why because it was spoken it is
[2:49:52] written
[2:49:55] that's what he's trying to restore to
[2:49:57] you tomorrow this morning that's what
[2:49:59] he's trying to restore to the pride
[2:50:01] that's what he's trying to give back to
[2:50:03] her he's trying to give her back her
[2:50:05] weapon not theology not just the history
[2:50:09] of malachi 4 5 not just the
[2:50:12] understanding of the mysteries but the
[2:50:14] power to be resurrected
[2:50:22] let's go on the power of his
[2:50:24] resurrection
[2:50:25] let's go in the name of jesus christ
[2:50:28] with a banner lifted high
[2:50:31] with faith in his word
[2:50:33] to handle the two-edged sword
[2:50:37] with the shield
[2:50:39] and the full armor of god on
[2:50:41] to meet the enemy
[2:50:43] because he's getting stronger
[2:50:46] and more
[2:50:48] powerful every
[2:50:51] day
[2:50:53] and as the enemy comes in like a flood
[2:50:58] the spirit of god
[2:51:00] raises up
[2:51:01] a standard
[2:51:02] against him
[2:51:05] who's the standard of god this morning
[2:51:12] who does he raise up
[2:51:14] to stand against him
[2:51:18] he raises up his elect
[2:51:20] and what can he give her
[2:51:24] to defeat him
[2:51:26] the same thing that's worked
[2:51:28] from the beginning the atom
[2:51:31] of his word
[2:51:33] he restores back to her
[2:51:36] the weapon
[2:51:38] he's getting stronger
[2:51:43] he's been getting stronger and more and
[2:51:45] more powerful every day
[2:51:49] as the enemy comes in like a flood the
[2:51:53] spirit of god raise it up a standard
[2:51:55] against him
[2:51:56] if we have to come to the end of these
[2:51:59] things
[2:52:01] and the mysteries of god has been
[2:52:03] completed
[2:52:05] with us
[2:52:07] we're looking for more strength
[2:52:10] a rapturing strength
[2:52:12] to meet
[2:52:13] a
[2:52:14] worse force
[2:52:21] because he's gaining strength
[2:52:23] we have to meet a worse force
[2:52:27] you're not going to fight the same old
[2:52:28] devil
[2:52:32] he's a new devil
[2:52:34] and new power
[2:52:36] and new strength and new strategy and
[2:52:39] new reasonings
[2:52:45] this morning we're just looking at what
[2:52:47] he's just done we're looking at his
[2:52:49] tactics
[2:52:50] and look what he says
[2:52:53] that'll rapture the church and take her
[2:52:56] into glory we must have it
[2:52:59] let us meet security with a challenge
[2:53:01] like we
[2:53:02] are the servants of the living god like
[2:53:05] shadrach meshach and abednego of old we
[2:53:08] will not bow to the devil of this world
[2:53:11] and take back
[2:53:13] this thing
[2:53:14] that we've talked about
[2:53:16] let us
[2:53:17] press
[2:53:19] the battle
[2:53:27] no other age
[2:53:29] is as dark as this age
[2:53:33] no other age is as deceiving
[2:53:36] as this age
[2:53:38] but god is restored back to us
[2:53:41] our weapon
[2:53:43] so we can meet the challenge
[2:53:45] of strength he's gained more power
[2:53:50] we gain more power
[2:53:54] how does it give us that power by
[2:53:56] revealing his word
