[41:28] God this morning man we want to welcome
[41:31] all our visitors God bless you certainly
[41:33] happy to be gathered let's open our
[41:35] Bibles uh in in Mark chapter 11 a very
[41:39] familiar scripture reading
[42:07] uh let's start from verse 11 it says and
[42:10] Jesus entered into
[42:12] Jerusalem into the temple and where he
[42:15] had looked around about upon all things
[42:20] and now the evening tide was come and he
[42:23] went out unto Bethany with the 12
[42:27] and on the tomorrow when they were come
[42:30] from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a
[42:34] fig tree a far of having leaves he came
[42:38] if happily he might find anything
[42:42] thereon and when he came to it he found
[42:46] nothing but leaves for the time of the
[42:48] Fig was not yet and Jesus said and Jesus
[42:53] answered and said unto it no man eat
[42:56] fruit of the thereafter
[42:59] forever for his and and then he said and
[43:02] his disciple heard it and he came to
[43:04] Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple
[43:07] and began to cast out them that sold and
[43:10] bought in the temple and overthrew the
[43:12] tables of the money money changers and
[43:15] the seeds of them that sold
[43:18] doves and would not suffer that any man
[43:21] would carry any vessel through the
[43:25] temple and he thought saying unto them
[43:28] is it not written that my house shall be
[43:31] called of all the N of All Nation the
[43:34] House of Prayer but ye have made it a
[43:36] den of th thieves and the Scribe and the
[43:40] chief priest heard it and sought how
[43:43] they might destroy him for they feared
[43:46] him because all the people was
[43:48] astonished at his Doctrine and when and
[43:52] when
[43:53] even when and even was come he went out
[43:57] of the city and in the morning as they
[44:00] passed by they saw the fig tree dried up
[44:03] from the root and Peter calling to
[44:06] remembrance and say unto him Master
[44:09] behold the Fig Tree which th curseth is
[44:11] withered away now I I I I look at it and
[44:15] I astonish because I I wonder what they
[44:18] thought the effect would be you know
[44:21] what I mean here he is and he looked at
[44:23] it and he spoke and he walked away and
[44:26] now they coming in the morning they find
[44:28] the result of what was spoken and
[44:30] they're they astonished and says how
[44:32] could this be how look at it you know
[44:36] and and and so it's just amazing how and
[44:39] I want to just point that out that
[44:41] you'll find out through the Bible that
[44:43] that that has always been the human
[44:45] nature that that that we we we say or
[44:49] things would happen where the
[44:51] consequences of it are really not
[44:53] thought through when it's spoken and so
[44:57] so and and and and and Jesus answered
[45:00] and said unto him it says have faith in
[45:03] God for verily I say unto you that
[45:06] whatsoever ye shall whatsoever shall say
[45:10] unto this mountain be thou Mo removed
[45:13] and be thou cast into the sea and shall
[45:15] not doubt in his heart but shall believe
[45:18] that those things which he saith shall
[45:21] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[45:25] saith therefore I say unto
[45:28] you what things soever ye desire when ye
[45:31] prayed believe ye receive them and ye
[45:34] shall have them and when ye stand
[45:37] praying forgive if ye have an heart
[45:41] against any that he said if he have an
[45:44] heart against any that the that your
[45:46] father also which is in heaven May
[45:48] forgive you your trespasses but if you
[45:51] do not forgive neither will your father
[45:54] which is in heaven forgive your
[45:56] trespasses Also let's turn our Bibles in
[45:58] Genesis chapter 1 we're just going to
[46:01] read the first three verses it says in
[46:05] the
[46:06] beginning God created the heavens and
[46:08] the Earth and the Earth was without form
[46:11] and void and darkness was upon the face
[46:14] of the deep and the spirit of God moves
[46:17] upon the face of the water and God said
[46:20] let there be and there was light let
[46:22] there be light and there was light our
[46:25] gracious father we ask you bless your
[46:26] word to us in the name of Jesus we pray
[46:29] amen God bless you and have your
[46:39] seats I I want just for a moment this
[46:43] morning I I don't believe I'll be able
[46:45] to do this Justice or or just get
[46:47] through everything but we'll say what
[46:50] what is important and will stop when
[46:53] it's needful to stop I want to speak on
[46:57] uh the uh Power to Speak Life the power
[47:02] to speak life and as a theme uh I want
[47:05] this to be in the back of your mind when
[47:08] you say power to speak life I want you
[47:11] at the same time to think about your
[47:13] words have power your words have
[47:18] power and and before I could just go on
[47:22] I I I I just I was so uh inspired and
[47:28] moved by what brother benoa preached on
[47:30] Wednesday and I'll say if you are not
[47:32] here on Wednesday I really would
[47:35] admonish you to just go and listen to it
[47:37] and and and it's just it was such an
[47:40] encouragement to me um because often
[47:44] time if we are not careful we we make
[47:47] the church and coming to church just a
[47:50] habit you know we make it just oh I'm
[47:53] going to church it's Sunday it's
[47:55] Wednesday but we failed to recognize
[47:58] that within everything that we do that
[48:01] God has a plan God has a moment and a
[48:04] time that he wants to do things you know
[48:07] I I was even thinking about the pool of
[48:10] Bethesda you you think about it as the
[48:13] scripture will speak it that people will
[48:16] gather around it but it was only at the
[48:18] certain time that the angel will come
[48:20] and stir up the water it was those that
[48:22] jumped in when the water was still
[48:24] moving those are the ones that receive
[48:27] healing and when we come to church we we
[48:29] don't want to get caught up within
[48:31] anything else oh how did the song go and
[48:34] who did this who missed what and who did
[48:37] what and we want to come and be Solly
[48:40] focused on the word of God and not just
[48:42] to W with the mind to try to figure out
[48:46] to by theology to find out where is this
[48:48] person trying to go what are they trying
[48:50] to say no but trying to look at to look
[48:53] at it and listen with attentiveness with
[48:56] what God is about to say and to say God
[48:59] I want you to speak something for me I
[49:01] want to hear something that will be
[49:03] helpful for me I I didn't uh wake up in
[49:06] the morning take shower dress and do all
[49:08] of this just so I can come and see a man
[49:11] I have a need within my heart and I
[49:13] believe that as the word is being spoken
[49:15] that you can speak to my heart so we
[49:17] really want to take every moment say let
[49:20] me say this time is running out you you
[49:23] know the events and the things that are
[49:25] happening in the world if if we are if
[49:27] we really look at it closely it's
[49:29] showing us that time is running out and
[49:32] we know that the Gentiles don't have an
[49:34] allocated time to say that in such year
[49:37] everything will end that we know that
[49:39] all that we were waiting for is what's
[49:41] happening in Israel because baram will
[49:43] tell us that Israel is God's clock and
[49:46] and it's it's it's it's when God is done
[49:48] with the Gentile when the word will move
[49:50] over but it's in this time that the
[49:52] bride is supposed to get ready it's in
[49:55] this time that we are supposed to to be
[49:57] prepared and not get caught up in
[49:59] politics or the things that are
[50:00] happening but be focused on the word of
[50:03] God and my heart desire this morning is
[50:05] God I want your your word what you have
[50:08] been spoken what you have given us in
[50:10] this end time I want the word of God to
[50:13] have effect upon my
[50:15] life I I I don't want to be a believer
[50:18] that could just quot and you know we if
[50:21] we're not careful we become uh h h h uh
[50:24] very very eloquent in quoting everything
[50:27] that the prophet said someone will say
[50:29] we know exactly where they got it from
[50:31] and this one will say no I want the life
[50:34] that was in that word when it was spoken
[50:36] I want that life to come in me I want
[50:39] the things that I look at when I look in
[50:41] the mirror I want God to fix them I want
[50:44] the word of God to have such an effect
[50:47] upon my life that I will look at myself
[50:49] and see nothing else but Christ I want
[50:52] Christ to be manifested in my life I
[50:54] want my walk I want everything I I do I
[50:57] want the way I think the way I conduct
[50:59] myself I want it to be nothing but the
[51:02] word of God being manifested it's not
[51:04] time to get lazy it's not time to say we
[51:07] have more time there is no time we want
[51:10] to be focused on the word of God and and
[51:12] waiting and watching and waiting at at
[51:15] the 11th Hour knowing that at any moment
[51:17] it's going to come to pass now in this
[51:20] thought I was just want to say this I
[51:22] want to start by saying this to said we
[51:24] as Christians we are called to be the
[51:27] most to have the to have a positive
[51:30] outlook on life no matter what the
[51:32] circumstances are we we are called you
[51:35] know we we just went uh uh uh through a
[51:38] a a political season and and the
[51:41] election and all of those things and
[51:42] even as our pastor spoke about it not
[51:44] long ago uh uh people can look and say
[51:47] well we don't have a woman president I
[51:48] need to relax this is not time to relax
[51:51] this is not time to give in and and we
[51:54] and we can't be focused us on the world
[51:57] out there and look at all the negative
[51:59] things that are happening out there and
[52:01] constantly looking and and looking and
[52:04] seeing the demise that's out there we
[52:06] have been given the word of God and We
[52:09] Know by the word of God that those
[52:10] things were predicted to come and they
[52:12] will come to pass and and no president
[52:15] can change it no Constitution can change
[52:18] it not a country can change it the world
[52:21] is headed in the trajectory of
[52:23] Destruction and nothing is going to stop
[52:25] it why because men's thinking has gotten
[52:28] evil continually they have rejected the
[52:31] word of God and they are receiving what
[52:34] they have uh uh uh uh uh uh what you
[52:37] have left after you have rejected the
[52:39] word of God but we as Christians have to
[52:42] be and the prophet will say it over and
[52:44] over we have to be the most happiest
[52:47] person there is on the face of the Earth
[52:49] number one not only that we know what's
[52:52] happening out there not only everything
[52:54] that's happening out there has been
[52:55] revealed to us for us to know the mind
[52:58] of God not only that but also that God
[53:01] has promised to us has given us an
[53:04] opportunity in this end time to have an
[53:06] eyesight to be able to see the
[53:08] destraction out there and has also open
[53:11] up our eyes in the end time so that we
[53:13] may know who we really
[53:15] are God has called us and and and has
[53:19] given us the blessings are many
[53:22] blessings as Ephesians will say to come
[53:24] into this place our eyes are open to see
[53:27] the the deception that's happening out
[53:29] there to see everything and he's called
[53:32] us to be the member of the bride and his
[53:34] called us in the same time to be the
[53:36] elected bride and to be here to project
[53:39] his word and to be here to live the life
[53:42] of Christ in the end time I want to say
[53:44] this that is a blessing that is a
[53:47] blessing and it's not because of
[53:49] anything you've done it's the grace of
[53:51] God manifested in your life and we as
[53:54] Believers we are the one ones that are
[53:57] called to carry out the positive outlook
[54:00] under any circumstances we are not
[54:03] called to be in the mind like the world
[54:05] is we are not called to co to go out
[54:08] there and be uh uh uh uh in a situation
[54:12] of where where we feel like everything
[54:14] is falling apart the world is falling
[54:16] apart but we are not falling
[54:19] apart and I want to say this morning it
[54:21] doesn't matter whether you have a job or
[54:24] don't have a job it doesn't matter
[54:26] whether you are sick or not sick it
[54:28] doesn't matter what status you find
[54:30] yourself this morning you as a Believer
[54:33] has to be the most happiest person there
[54:36] is why because if God Gave You eternal
[54:39] life what can separate you from the love
[54:41] of God if you have eternal life what's
[54:44] more important than eternal life what's
[54:46] more is this this life that we live in
[54:49] is it the few years that we are
[54:50] allocated is it the the little money
[54:53] that we can make is it no those things
[54:55] are not important and they can never be
[54:58] put on the same scale as having eternal
[55:00] life to have eternal life is the most
[55:03] important thing for the
[55:04] believer to know that after this life is
[55:07] over after all the trials are over after
[55:11] all this world passes away that I will
[55:13] not pass away that should that alone
[55:16] should make you the most happiest person
[55:18] there is but one him will say it one
[55:21] place I'll just paraphrase it for the
[55:23] second time and and it will say if you
[55:25] were to to be uh to live a million
[55:29] years and be given all the money that
[55:32] there is but at the end of the million
[55:35] year you will die and go to hell but if
[55:39] you were to be given a choice that you
[55:41] can live for a million year a 100 or
[55:43] more whatever it is and live as poor as
[55:46] it could be but know that at the end of
[55:49] that 100 or million years you will go to
[55:51] heaven which one would you choose oh my
[55:54] brother my sister I will choose eternal
[55:56] life life every time why because I know
[55:59] this life is only temporary why because
[56:02] I know when this life is over I have
[56:04] another life waiting for me why because
[56:07] we don't live this life just so we can
[56:09] accumulate the goods we live this life
[56:11] for the life to come why because Christ
[56:15] the god the creator of Heaven and Earth
[56:17] has chosen for him to reveal himself to
[56:19] me and his PL and he sent his holy
[56:22] spirit to come and dwell within my own
[56:24] heart that has to be as the most
[56:27] happiest person we
[56:29] are
[56:31] and but one will
[56:34] say in the
[56:37] message respect it says in the message
[56:41] respect paragraph 29 and it will say
[56:44] this and said and I think and and it
[56:48] says and to think that the very one who
[56:51] created who wrote the
[56:54] Bible Paul is Isaiah Jeremiah and all
[56:58] the apostles and those precious
[57:01] Brethren wherever they are now whether
[57:05] they are wherever they are now very the
[57:08] very God that dealt with them to foresee
[57:14] things write it and write it and so
[57:17] forth and give them the gift of the
[57:20] Bible the prophecy and the speaking in
[57:23] tongue and the signs and wonders and so
[57:25] forth them same men wherever they are
[57:29] now we are going to be with
[57:33] them I I I want you to think about the
[57:36] sacrifices I want you to think about
[57:38] what those men went through I want you
[57:40] to think God has come in this end time
[57:43] and it's looked at us as 11 hours worker
[57:46] and it's given us the same wage as those
[57:49] that started before to think about Moses
[57:52] to think about Elijah to think about all
[57:54] this great men that we read on in the
[57:56] Bible the prophet is telling us that
[57:59] wherever they are tonight wherever they
[58:01] are this morning that we are going to be
[58:04] with them together and then it says the
[58:07] same God and then it says the same God
[58:10] with the same things it says it isn't a
[58:13] guess so anymore we know it now see it
[58:17] says because he's really present and we
[58:21] know it's so so we should not it says we
[58:26] shouldn't we not be the happiest people
[58:28] on Earth what more we long what more
[58:31] would we long so here is saying to just
[58:35] realize that these people have given up
[58:37] their lives and they've done so much for
[58:39] the gospel and they've done all their
[58:42] great and wonders and uh Moses opening
[58:44] up the right sea and and all the things
[58:46] that they've done it says that we as
[58:49] Believers of the end time we have not
[58:51] only received the same God but we have
[58:54] received the same reward but we'll all
[58:57] be at the same
[58:59] place
[59:01] Hallelujah and and and and and yeah we
[59:04] are sitting here we we think oh I I have
[59:07] a headache and I have this and I have
[59:09] need of that just think about how great
[59:12] of a blessing that we have received as a
[59:14] Believer to know that what that the same
[59:17] God not a different God the same spirit
[59:20] that was in John The Same Spirit that
[59:22] was in Paul that same spirit is in The
[59:25] Believer tonight
[59:26] that same spirit is in you this morning
[59:28] as you're sitting in the house of God
[59:30] that same God is here doing the same
[59:33] thing but bam says in the message we
[59:36] would see Jesus paragraph 15 it says and
[59:39] if the scripture says he is the same
[59:41] yesterday today and forever then we
[59:44] might it must be so or the scriptures is
[59:47] wrong and if the scripture is wrong
[59:49] where are we at it says what condition
[59:52] the whole world uh the whole world is
[59:54] tonight and remember remember Jesus said
[59:57] the scripture the scriptures cannot be
[1:00:00] broken so it says that comes from the
[1:00:03] mouth of the son of Christ the son of
[1:00:06] God the scripture cannot be broken and
[1:00:08] if the scripture says that is the same
[1:00:11] yesterday today and forever he has to be
[1:00:14] the same or the scriptures are
[1:00:21] wrong if the scripture says is the
[1:00:23] present help in times of need that same
[1:00:26] scripture has to be the same this
[1:00:28] morning if the scripture says I'll never
[1:00:31] leave you I'll be with you even in you
[1:00:33] until the end time he has to do that
[1:00:35] otherwise the scriptures are wrong so
[1:00:37] he's telling us is telling us here to
[1:00:40] know that as as Believers when we read
[1:00:43] the word of God we are called to come
[1:00:45] into the realization that we are not
[1:00:48] just reading the pages of the Bible or
[1:00:50] some written history about some God up
[1:00:53] in heaven but we are reading the word of
[1:00:56] the Living God and that same God is here
[1:00:59] with us this morning to bring his word a
[1:01:02] reality in your life so if he says I'll
[1:01:04] never leave you that God has not changed
[1:01:07] is here this morning if he says I'll be
[1:01:09] with you that same God has to be with
[1:01:12] you otherwise his word is not
[1:01:20] right and and and so he he that's the
[1:01:24] kind of God and that's the kind of
[1:01:26] attitude that he wants us to have it
[1:01:28] said let's just bring God to his word it
[1:01:31] says if God doesn't keep his word then
[1:01:34] it's not
[1:01:37] God and
[1:01:39] if it does keep his word we should be
[1:01:43] the happiest people on Earth how many
[1:01:46] believe God keeps his word this morning
[1:01:48] how many believe God is faithful this
[1:01:50] morning how many believe that we live by
[1:01:53] the word of God we are here because of
[1:01:57] the word of God we are here because God
[1:02:00] in the beginning he thought about as he
[1:02:03] spoke about us he promised that we will
[1:02:05] come to manifestation in the end time
[1:02:08] and he has nothing to do with anything
[1:02:10] that we have done we are here because he
[1:02:12] spoke the word and that word cannot
[1:02:15] return vo to him that word has to come
[1:02:18] into manifestation that's why we are
[1:02:20] sitting here this morning
[1:02:27] now we read in
[1:02:31] Genesis we read in Genesis who said in
[1:02:35] the beginning as the world was without
[1:02:38] form the spirit of God was moving upon
[1:02:41] the face of the Earth and it says that
[1:02:44] God said let there be light and there
[1:02:46] was light but when I will talk about
[1:02:49] this and and and and I won't read it I
[1:02:52] just want to illustrate so I don't I can
[1:02:55] save a little bit time and and it will
[1:02:58] speak about this in the power of
[1:03:00] transformation it will say yeah the the
[1:03:03] Earth was uh without form was void and
[1:03:06] and and it says and then the spirit of
[1:03:09] God was moving upon the face of the deep
[1:03:11] and and and and and the word and God
[1:03:14] will say leter be and and the word of
[1:03:17] God began to take what was out of form
[1:03:21] and forming into the Garden of Eden the
[1:03:23] word of God will take something that
[1:03:25] will was in chaos without form and void
[1:03:28] it will take and bring a shape out of it
[1:03:31] and the word of God when he spoke and
[1:03:33] let there be plant life they came plant
[1:03:36] life where it be uh uh Maron life and
[1:03:39] marine life came and let there be
[1:03:41] animals the animals came and all of that
[1:03:44] came by the spoken word of God and I
[1:03:47] want to say the principle I want to
[1:03:49] establish this morning is nothing can
[1:03:52] happen unless the word is spoken first
[1:03:56] and and I want you just to stay with me
[1:03:58] I said your word matters your word have
[1:04:01] power and I want to speak about the
[1:04:04] power of the word of the spoken word or
[1:04:07] the the power of the word and I want us
[1:04:09] to understand right from the get-go the
[1:04:11] prophet is trying to show us this so God
[1:04:14] in achieving the process of
[1:04:17] transformation the pattern of
[1:04:19] transformation of anything really lies
[1:04:22] within the spoken word and I want to say
[1:04:25] this if it outside of the spoken word
[1:04:27] it's only a temporary
[1:04:32] transformation I if you if you believe
[1:04:35] you think you can become a Christian
[1:04:37] outside of the spoken word of God you
[1:04:40] can become a Christian by your works and
[1:04:42] by everything you can do it will only be
[1:04:44] a temporary the only true transformation
[1:04:48] and the permanent transformation can
[1:04:50] only come by the word of God so it's
[1:04:53] only when God speaks and what
[1:04:56] say when God speaks he says there was
[1:04:58] nothing and because he spoke his word
[1:05:02] began to bring into creation what was
[1:05:05] not and that's why he will say at one
[1:05:07] place he said oh I wonder the sons of
[1:05:10] God it says isn't it strange that sons
[1:05:13] of God and that were made in the image
[1:05:16] of God and that were made to live by
[1:05:18] faith and that were made to live by the
[1:05:20] word of God and that were made to speak
[1:05:23] the things in existence that don't exist
[1:05:26] and and to look at things that exist and
[1:05:28] speak them out of existence I wonder I
[1:05:31] look at them and I see how they're
[1:05:32] conducting themselves and I wonder
[1:05:37] why we even take it to what a a pastor
[1:05:41] read when when the prophet came and and
[1:05:44] when we read in the scripture when we we
[1:05:46] read in that message the way of a true
[1:05:48] Prophet where he's looking and said
[1:05:50] these people were called to be a people
[1:05:52] of God they were called to live by the
[1:05:55] word of God they are blessed people how
[1:05:58] come they are trying to live up for the
[1:06:00] resources that have not given them
[1:06:03] instead of living by the resources that
[1:06:05] I've provided for them let me say this
[1:06:07] the believer's resource is the word of
[1:06:11] God your your resource is not your money
[1:06:15] it's not your house it's not your
[1:06:17] resource is the word of God if you ever
[1:06:20] want to bring a change about something
[1:06:22] speak the word of God St by the word of
[1:06:25] God if God Begin by the word we have to
[1:06:28] start by the
[1:06:33] word so he will speak the word so the
[1:06:37] word of God spoken to the Earth uh
[1:06:40] produced The Garden of Eden into
[1:06:42] existence the word of God spoken to the
[1:06:45] world began to bring the Sun and the
[1:06:48] Moon and and the plant life and the
[1:06:50] animal life and and all and everything
[1:06:52] else that there is and and and I want to
[1:06:55] say is the same voice of Resurrection we
[1:06:58] have heard it in the same time
[1:07:02] hallu the same voice remember the same
[1:07:06] voice of creation it's not a different
[1:07:09] the the the the the where we get caught
[1:07:11] up is well God said let there be what
[1:07:14] voice did you hear it was God speaking
[1:07:17] well and and the same God came in the
[1:07:19] same time and he's speaking and if he
[1:07:22] spoke in the creation in the beginning
[1:07:24] it came to pass the same God is speaking
[1:07:27] tonight is speaking in the end time so
[1:07:29] the same creation can come into
[1:07:36] existence but will say in the message
[1:07:40] who is
[1:07:41] God he
[1:07:43] says paragraph 17 it
[1:07:46] says
[1:07:48] now just like a child playing
[1:07:52] before the
[1:07:54] door and it was the Son of God the
[1:07:57] logos and I can see him
[1:08:00] there and he spake and said let her
[1:08:03] be it says and there was
[1:08:06] nothing but there was something but
[1:08:09] there was something
[1:08:11] happened and Adam turned there and began
[1:08:15] to W around this way this
[1:08:19] way the sun began to come into
[1:08:23] existence because he said said let her
[1:08:26] be there is the
[1:08:31] authority I I wonder if we really let
[1:08:35] that sink in that the word of God is the
[1:08:38] final
[1:08:39] Authority what what what the word speaks
[1:08:43] nothing can cross it nothing can come
[1:08:46] against it nothing can change it if God
[1:08:49] has spoken it's done if God has spoken
[1:08:54] you might as well go home and sleep if
[1:08:57] God has said has said something to you
[1:09:00] if God has spoken there's nothing in the
[1:09:02] world that can change
[1:09:04] that it says where did he make where did
[1:09:08] he make it from I don't know there was
[1:09:12] nothing to make it from but he believed
[1:09:16] his own
[1:09:19] word and there was
[1:09:22] light and I can see a piece fly off that
[1:09:27] it says it's a meteor and after a few
[1:09:30] million years or a 100 billion aund
[1:09:34] billions of years if you want to call it
[1:09:38] and it circled way out and I see
[1:09:42] standing there watching it and he fall
[1:09:44] down there and he stopped it after it f
[1:09:48] a few million years let it hang there in
[1:09:53] the Orit let it hang there in
[1:09:57] orbit and here goes another one fly off
[1:10:00] the Sun and he goes over there and hangs
[1:10:03] down and stops it there it says Jesus
[1:10:06] said that the so that the soer soed and
[1:10:10] if you will just St it in your heart and
[1:10:13] don't dip it and don't dig it out don't
[1:10:16] dig it up every time you see how it's
[1:10:18] getting along just it says just sink it
[1:10:22] in into your heart and settle it that's
[1:10:24] all walk right on God will take care of
[1:10:28] the rest of it it it's obligated I'm
[1:10:31] sorry I think I jump into another
[1:10:32] message yeah this is another message at
[1:10:35] that word I'm
[1:10:41] sorry it says do you know that
[1:10:45] everything that you see tonight is God's
[1:10:47] word
[1:10:49] materialized do you know that your body
[1:10:52] is God's word materialized do you you
[1:10:55] know them beings it says there there's
[1:10:58] God's word materialized do you know that
[1:11:01] the concrete is God spoken word
[1:11:04] materialized do you know that the whole
[1:11:07] earth is God's spoken word god spoken
[1:11:11] and said let be and he believed his own
[1:11:15] word and the Earth came into existence
[1:11:17] and if he didn't then there will come
[1:11:20] then it didn't come
[1:11:23] from it says well you
[1:11:26] Say it'll come off the
[1:11:28] sun well he says who spoke the son into
[1:11:34] existence everything is God's word the
[1:11:37] wordss were framed by the word of God
[1:11:41] the Bible says so God just spoke it and
[1:11:44] believed it his own word and that was it
[1:11:47] and that was it it says now God has
[1:11:50] spoken his word to us just believe him
[1:11:53] and watch it happen now now when he
[1:11:56] spoke something this is his word
[1:11:59] initially first he says and any other
[1:12:03] word that's contrary to to this is not
[1:12:06] God's word and has to come and he has to
[1:12:10] come from the Bible he says now this is
[1:12:13] his word to the nation now he sets it a
[1:12:17] he sets it uh after that he says in the
[1:12:21] church for some Apostle and and PE and
[1:12:23] and prophet and gift of healing and
[1:12:26] others maners and and if a prophet or a
[1:12:29] Seer would speak any word and it isn't
[1:12:32] according to the Bible here coming to
[1:12:34] the fashion or or contrary to the word
[1:12:37] of God it's not right it says but but
[1:12:40] this is God's word first now he pointing
[1:12:42] in the Bible what God uh what God spoke
[1:12:47] secondarily God it says that's
[1:12:49] secondarily his word to the individual
[1:12:52] so here we are and he's wanting us to
[1:12:55] get into the place as Believers where we
[1:12:58] we we come into an understanding that I
[1:13:01] I don't want to be built upon what the
[1:13:03] preacher is saying I don't want to be
[1:13:05] built upon what some thinking is and
[1:13:08] someone can come and and present A Way
[1:13:11] something in a way that you never heard
[1:13:13] it before that will not produce life but
[1:13:16] what he's wanting us to know is to
[1:13:18] understand that everything about us
[1:13:20] everything in the world everything is
[1:13:23] built upon the word of God
[1:13:26] and it's only what's built upon the word
[1:13:28] of God that will
[1:13:32] prosper now don't forget the process it
[1:13:35] couldn't happen unless God spoke it
[1:13:37] first So within our lives it it's
[1:13:40] important we get in the pattern or in
[1:13:43] the understanding that if I want my
[1:13:46] situation change I need to speak the
[1:13:51] word you know I was reading uh uh
[1:13:54] somewhere I forgot the the message you
[1:13:56] know but one says you know we'll be at
[1:13:59] home and and perhaps one of the little
[1:14:01] ones is sick and and said and when he
[1:14:03] seek what we do he said we come and my
[1:14:06] wife and I will lay hand on the baby and
[1:14:08] we begin to pray he said he said
[1:14:09] Heavenly Father you've given us this
[1:14:11] child and now they are sick and the
[1:14:13] condition here uh uh we don't know
[1:14:15] exactly what to do about it but you give
[1:14:17] us this child and you said if we ask it
[1:14:19] shall come to pass and then he says when
[1:14:21] we pray and finish that that's over
[1:14:26] and I'm like that's a principle we
[1:14:28] should be applying every day we we have
[1:14:31] family members we have children we have
[1:14:33] those that we need to see save and we
[1:14:36] have situations that we run in and and
[1:14:38] often time we run into a situation where
[1:14:41] we feel like somebody has to shake us
[1:14:43] all we have to raise our voices and
[1:14:45] scream before God can hear no it's given
[1:14:48] to you as a Son of God to speak the word
[1:14:51] so the word can go forward so God can
[1:14:54] utilize that that can change your
[1:14:58] situation he didn't say in screaming
[1:15:00] just speak it just be positive about it
[1:15:04] just know I'm speaking it's not a child
[1:15:07] is sick you start to go oh my goodness
[1:15:09] is going to die and he about to die and
[1:15:12] the last time I heard this happen to
[1:15:13] another child that died oh they're about
[1:15:15] to die oh God oh God no fear will not
[1:15:19] bring anything in other words fear will
[1:15:21] cause death to come in but what you need
[1:15:24] is a positive attitude what you is is
[1:15:26] the faith to cast out the
[1:15:31] devil you get fir from work oh God I
[1:15:34] don't know how I'm going to f the same
[1:15:36] God Who provided the first job the same
[1:15:39] God will provide another job you just
[1:15:41] walk out you say the lord giveth the
[1:15:43] Lord takes away blessed be his name he
[1:15:46] said the just shall live by faith he
[1:15:48] says I never seen a righteous B bread
[1:15:50] I'll go
[1:15:53] forward and watch the word come to
[1:15:58] pass oh we we get so filled with
[1:16:03] negativity we we let our flesh come in
[1:16:05] the enemy jumps in and every time
[1:16:08] there's a circumstance and the enemy
[1:16:10] works by the way of Flesh and causes us
[1:16:13] to speak so much negative and to speak
[1:16:16] so much confession of the devil we speak
[1:16:19] the devil's language and we wonder how
[1:16:22] that happened
[1:16:30] let me say this if something
[1:16:32] happen watch somewhere you must have
[1:16:37] spoken
[1:16:39] it you must by your mouth allow it to
[1:16:43] come you must have confess that somewh
[1:16:47] oh I'm not the good of a Christian you
[1:16:49] know every time I try I keep failing let
[1:16:51] me say this if you are a real believer
[1:16:54] you might might as well get used to
[1:16:57] failing I'm saying that you might as
[1:16:59] well get used to failing but your
[1:17:01] failure should not be the stopping point
[1:17:04] you must stand up and say it doesn't
[1:17:06] matter how many times I fail my God is
[1:17:09] able to make me a real
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:16] believer where is your word what are you
[1:17:19] speaking
[1:17:27] what are you
[1:17:30] speaking now I I was thinking about this
[1:17:33] and we'll get a little deeper into this
[1:17:35] and I'll get to my subject the the I was
[1:17:37] thinking about this the scripture will
[1:17:39] speak about that I was even
[1:17:41] fellowshipping with brother Paul about
[1:17:42] this I I think it was read throughout
[1:17:45] the meetings and I thought it was so
[1:17:46] wonderful about the spies yeah they are
[1:17:50] God sends them to Moses sends them to go
[1:17:53] in the Promised Land and to go and and
[1:17:56] and watch go and spy out the land and
[1:17:59] look at the land what the requirement
[1:18:02] was I want you to go look at it and tell
[1:18:04] me is it what God said it was going to
[1:18:07] be or
[1:18:08] not and then he says after you do that I
[1:18:11] want you to examine the inhabitant of
[1:18:13] the land and tell us what you think
[1:18:16] about them whether they be weak or
[1:18:18] strong or whatever just tell us so yeah
[1:18:21] they are they send them on the mission
[1:18:23] the mission was is the word of God true
[1:18:27] the mission was is my enemy stronger or
[1:18:31] weaker the mission was never speak it to
[1:18:34] it according to yourself the mission was
[1:18:37] you just report what you see in other
[1:18:40] words you go to a doctor they said you
[1:18:42] have this you have this you have this or
[1:18:44] you said God the doctor said this is
[1:18:46] happening this is happening that the
[1:18:48] doctor the mission was don't say well if
[1:18:51] I have cancer that means I'm going to
[1:18:53] die no that was their
[1:18:55] conclusion God didn't ask them to make a
[1:18:58] conclusion the word didn't say go out
[1:19:00] there here see what you're going to see
[1:19:03] and come back and give me your
[1:19:04] conclusion the message was you go out
[1:19:07] there and you just tell me what you
[1:19:12] saw and and I think that happen so much
[1:19:15] within our lives we go out and something
[1:19:17] happen and all of a sudden we fall apart
[1:19:20] you know we start to look well I don't
[1:19:22] know how I'm going to get that job I
[1:19:23] don't have the qualific
[1:19:25] well the scripture didn't say do you
[1:19:27] have the qualification let me say this
[1:19:30] the the the thing that's really
[1:19:31] upsetting about that story is these
[1:19:34] people were gotten out by the hand of
[1:19:36] Mighty
[1:19:38] God if you go back to see how they got
[1:19:42] out of the land that they came in it was
[1:19:44] a prophecy that they will go in bondage
[1:19:46] for 400
[1:19:50] years so they weren't in Egypt for 400
[1:19:54] years by a prophecy that was already
[1:19:56] given and the prophet said when the time
[1:19:59] of the promise came now I love this it
[1:20:02] says at one place when the time came now
[1:20:06] God began to change the event so it can
[1:20:09] match the prophecy God began to change
[1:20:13] the event why because it was time for
[1:20:15] deliverance when your time comes God
[1:20:18] will change your
[1:20:23] event amen we we we look at the event
[1:20:26] and we look at the circumstance and and
[1:20:29] and all of the sudden we make a
[1:20:31] conclusion they were not asked to make a
[1:20:33] conclusion they were only asked to go
[1:20:35] and spy the land so they were working
[1:20:37] and they came and they started making
[1:20:42] predictions
[1:20:43] well well based on what you ask us to do
[1:20:48] well now the first part is no no problem
[1:20:50] at all we went and in fact yes is the
[1:20:52] fruits of the land and you know this
[1:20:54] grapes no not one person could carry it
[1:20:57] yeah we all it took two people to carry
[1:20:58] the grapes and everything but as for the
[1:21:02] others we look like
[1:21:06] grasshoppers in their
[1:21:09] eyes there's no place in the scriptures
[1:21:12] where it says that the sons of anak
[1:21:14] looked at them and they thought that
[1:21:16] they look like
[1:21:19] grasshoppers not
[1:21:22] one they brought brought their own
[1:21:25] conclusion through the word of
[1:21:29] God how many times do we bring
[1:21:31] conclusion through the word of God the
[1:21:34] Bible says you are healed you walk in
[1:21:36] the doctor's office that said if they
[1:21:38] say you have a headache oh praise God
[1:21:40] I'm Healed you have cancer
[1:21:43] oh that one I don't know you just made
[1:21:47] your own
[1:21:49] conclusion the scripture says that I am
[1:21:52] the Lord God who Health all
[1:21:55] th diseases it didn't say I heal the
[1:21:57] headache I can't heal malaria he didn't
[1:22:00] say I heal the headache I I can't heal
[1:22:02] cancer he says all that
[1:22:07] diseases I I've said this before and
[1:22:09] I've say this if you read uh the the the
[1:22:12] the the Book of Joshua you will find at
[1:22:16] every Junction that it was never the
[1:22:18] strength of the Israel people that made
[1:22:21] them overcome to begin with the battle
[1:22:24] every battle that they fought they want
[1:22:27] it because of the obedience to the words
[1:22:30] of the
[1:22:32] Prophet obedience to the word of God
[1:22:35] when the word of God said only choose
[1:22:37] few people they did well they many well
[1:22:41] just choose few how are we going to go
[1:22:44] just choose few just follow the word
[1:22:46] when the word of God said I want you to
[1:22:48] just go around the building I just want
[1:22:51] you to go around and dance and just go
[1:22:53] around and do nothing around Jericho
[1:22:55] when they did that that produced the
[1:22:58] result in every instance God chose a way
[1:23:03] that seemed impossible to bring forth
[1:23:06] the result so they would know that the
[1:23:08] result didn't come from them but it came
[1:23:11] from
[1:23:13] God and God will do it every time in
[1:23:17] your life every time he will confin your
[1:23:21] wisdom he will confin you to show that
[1:23:24] you're not the one producing the result
[1:23:27] you're not the one producing
[1:23:30] healing you go you say well it's because
[1:23:32] of the pill I took no the pill didn't
[1:23:34] heal you it's your faith that healed
[1:23:38] you there's another one that took the
[1:23:41] same pill they die so you might as well
[1:23:44] stop talking about the pill and startop
[1:23:46] praising
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:23:52] God it it's amazing they talk about the
[1:23:55] placebo effect where you go they give
[1:23:58] you something and all of the sudden the
[1:24:00] person gets healed how is it possible
[1:24:03] what they gave you was not even
[1:24:07] medicine what is it it was your positive
[1:24:09] attitude it was your faith you believe
[1:24:12] that what you were doing something was
[1:24:14] going to happen and something happened
[1:24:16] to us
[1:24:27] oh
[1:24:31] my the
[1:24:33] word so
[1:24:35] when Joshua and Caleb
[1:24:38] came when he came the time to speak I
[1:24:41] love this they only
[1:24:45] spoke what the word had already
[1:24:51] spoken they didn't add anything new
[1:24:55] their revelation of the situation was
[1:24:58] only according to the promise that they
[1:25:00] already
[1:25:02] have they talked about the land being
[1:25:05] good land they talked about the sons of
[1:25:07] anak and the giant at the end they say
[1:25:10] that we are more than able to overcome
[1:25:13] them but what I'm says that they were
[1:25:16] looking at the promise and not under
[1:25:19] circumstances my brother my sister
[1:25:21] Victory comes when we look upon the
[1:25:23] promise and not on our circumstances and
[1:25:27] it's just not looking upon the promise
[1:25:29] but you look upon this promise and you
[1:25:31] speak
[1:25:38] it and I know you know way I'm going
[1:25:41] with this just want you to walk with me
[1:25:43] for a little
[1:25:45] bit so the pattern of
[1:25:49] transformation will only come when the
[1:25:51] go when the word is spoken first
[1:25:59] it's when the word Goes Forth because
[1:26:02] why the word is the only thing that has
[1:26:06] the power of transformation in
[1:26:08] it the word of God is what brings the
[1:26:11] result the word of God is our strength
[1:26:14] the word of God is what will change the
[1:26:18] circumstances you cannot continually let
[1:26:21] me say this speak negative
[1:26:25] ly and expect something positive to
[1:26:29] happen that's
[1:26:32] right and and I believe the reason is
[1:26:36] because often time we are we we lose the
[1:26:40] awareness that our words have
[1:26:45] power we lose the awareness that our
[1:26:48] word carries a power within
[1:26:52] it the scripture says the out of the
[1:26:55] abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:26:59] speakers the prophet will say in one
[1:27:01] place is that it's what we
[1:27:04] think it's what we spend time on it's
[1:27:07] all those things it's what we
[1:27:11] are and the scripture I was thinking
[1:27:13] about just before I get to this I
[1:27:17] thought about how many times and we can
[1:27:20] even be our own witness to this how many
[1:27:23] times s in our lives has something
[1:27:27] negatively been spoken that affected us
[1:27:30] for a long
[1:27:37] time how many times someone looked at
[1:27:41] you whether you were young or wherever
[1:27:43] whatever age you were in and looked at
[1:27:44] you and said looked at you he said oh
[1:27:46] you are no
[1:27:48] good oh look at you you will never
[1:27:50] amount to anything and you walked all
[1:27:53] your life life carrying not
[1:27:56] burden now these are just the words of a
[1:27:59] man these are just the words of a mortal
[1:28:02] but yet they're hurt yet they bring a
[1:28:06] result words spoken have a
[1:28:10] consequences words spoken will bring a
[1:28:14] result words spoken will bring something
[1:28:18] to come to pass the scripture will say
[1:28:21] in proverb 28 and 21 it says death and
[1:28:25] life are in the power of the tongue and
[1:28:29] they that love it its
[1:28:32] fruits and they that love it it that
[1:28:35] love it shall eat the fruits
[1:28:38] thereof and I want to say to say this
[1:28:41] and I wonder just how many times in
[1:28:45] circumstances that we come
[1:28:47] across how many times have we let
[1:28:51] ourselves become just negative about it
[1:28:55] instead of being
[1:29:00] positive how many times we we have we
[1:29:03] have completely lost the awareness that
[1:29:06] our words carry consequences and we just
[1:29:08] spoke and in fact we run into a
[1:29:11] situation where we think oh this is just
[1:29:13] me speaking let me say this every time
[1:29:16] you speak you are either inspired by God
[1:29:19] or you are inspired by the devil that's
[1:29:22] right
[1:29:30] there is no such thing as free
[1:29:36] thinker so because we always think God
[1:29:39] is on this side the devil and is on this
[1:29:41] side and I'm here in the middle making
[1:29:43] my own decisions no you're not you're
[1:29:46] either being influenced by one or the
[1:29:49] other and what you speak either comes
[1:29:51] from One Tree or the other tree
[1:29:56] right oh I'm no good we love that oh
[1:30:00] look at me I'm
[1:30:07] dumb you know I I let me say this this
[1:30:10] is simple but this is very
[1:30:13] important I I I could have taken this
[1:30:16] and and talk about the son of men
[1:30:18] speaking the word and we would have been
[1:30:20] up and running and all of that but that
[1:30:22] is not relevant unless we can understand
[1:30:25] this because that son of man
[1:30:28] manifestation is
[1:30:31] today talk about oh you know the the
[1:30:34] time it's about even the time of squeeze
[1:30:36] it talks about when if your your
[1:30:38] brother's crop is drying it says you can
[1:30:41] speak and God will send the rain let me
[1:30:43] say this your brother's crop is drying
[1:30:46] every
[1:30:47] day we've taken it and send it to some
[1:30:50] future event instead of speaking now
[1:30:57] amen there are people in our midst that
[1:31:00] need God that are struggling every day
[1:31:03] and we look at them instead of speaking
[1:31:06] the word we are speaking negative oh
[1:31:09] look at them they can't dress right look
[1:31:10] at them they can't talk right look at
[1:31:12] them they missing church pray for them
[1:31:15] speak the
[1:31:20] word and we if you're going to help
[1:31:23] somebody you have to have love in your
[1:31:26] heart you have to put yourself in their
[1:31:28] shoes you have to remember that God has
[1:31:30] done the same for you while you are yet
[1:31:33] a sinner while you were lost in sin he
[1:31:36] came and he was paent with
[1:31:40] youall he walked with you you were
[1:31:43] stumbling and rolling in the dust and
[1:31:45] and just don't know what to do he was
[1:31:47] patient with you how come you can extend
[1:31:50] the same patience
[1:31:57] this is God in a human flesh let me say
[1:32:00] this the son of man he came to speak
[1:32:04] life if Jesus came to speak life if we
[1:32:07] are the manifestation of that same life
[1:32:10] or that same sound then we are to Speak
[1:32:13] Life to
[1:32:14] people the word of God is given to you
[1:32:18] for you to walk into
[1:32:20] circumstances oh you know perhaps at
[1:32:23] work perhaps some where oh you know I
[1:32:25] just went to a doctor and they told me I
[1:32:27] have cancer and I'm going to die and
[1:32:29] everything God has giving you the
[1:32:31] authority to walk in a situation where
[1:32:34] death has been spoken and Speak Life to
[1:32:38] it oh you know
[1:32:41] what I know a God and that God he he is
[1:32:45] manifested in the end time and and he
[1:32:48] sent us a prophet and that Prophet spoke
[1:32:50] a word and he said not even cancer will
[1:32:53] stand before you and and I can tell you
[1:32:56] testimonies of Believers that I know and
[1:32:59] I can give you books that you can go
[1:33:00] read about the testimonies of that same
[1:33:03] God he can speak to your life and it
[1:33:06] will change the circumstance we are not
[1:33:08] called to participate in the deaf
[1:33:11] conversation who's going to be the next
[1:33:14] president who's going to be the
[1:33:16] secretary of the state who's going to be
[1:33:19] this and what is Donald Trump going to
[1:33:21] do and what's going to happen to the
[1:33:23] country what if this happened or what
[1:33:26] it's none of our
[1:33:30] business I I I feel like we want to
[1:33:32] prolong these things as long as we want
[1:33:35] let me say this in fact it's not on your
[1:33:38] program it's God's program to begin
[1:33:47] with oh my
[1:33:50] so and and and and so he it says death
[1:33:54] and life and in fact it will the
[1:33:57] scripture will speak in James oh I love
[1:34:00] this I could just spend all time in the
[1:34:01] Book of James speaking about this James
[1:34:03] 3 5 and 6 it says even so the tongue is
[1:34:09] a little
[1:34:10] member and and boast of great things
[1:34:14] behold how great a man or a little fire
[1:34:18] kindleth and then it says and the tongue
[1:34:21] is a fire a world of
[1:34:24] iniquity so is the tongue among our
[1:34:28] members that if the fire the whole body
[1:34:32] it says set forth a fire of uh the
[1:34:35] course of the nature and it is set on
[1:34:38] fire of hell so yes James now he not
[1:34:42] telling us so we can go and either Tire
[1:34:45] tongue so we don't speak anymore but
[1:34:47] he's wanting us to have the
[1:34:49] understanding that within this tongue we
[1:34:51] have the power to either speak life or
[1:34:54] death so we have to be careful every
[1:34:57] time we open our mouth so that we just
[1:34:59] don't speak some vain ideas that comes
[1:35:02] that we are very careful in making sure
[1:35:04] that I am speaking life I am speaking
[1:35:08] encouragement I am speaking life I'm
[1:35:11] speaking something that will produce God
[1:35:14] in the life of the
[1:35:19] individual we we we become
[1:35:22] expert and and I wonder how many times
[1:35:24] our tongue has gotten us in
[1:35:27] trouble and I'll confess this most of
[1:35:30] the time it's not even for the action we
[1:35:33] do something wrong but it really gets
[1:35:35] worse when we open our
[1:35:38] mouths why because we want to bring out
[1:35:40] all the justification why we were
[1:35:43] supposed to do the wrong that we
[1:35:48] did instead of just saying you know what
[1:35:50] I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that I am
[1:35:52] so sorry
[1:35:55] you know I get scared when somebody
[1:35:57] calls me and says let's get to the
[1:35:58] bottom of this I don't want to get to
[1:36:00] the bottom I want to get
[1:36:04] up to the bottom of since when I've ever
[1:36:07] people sat down and talked and talked
[1:36:09] and talk and come to a resolution
[1:36:13] never
[1:36:16] never you have your Viewpoint I have my
[1:36:19] viewpoint the only thing that can unite
[1:36:21] us is the word of God so if I say I'm
[1:36:24] sorry we forget about all we go
[1:36:30] forward do the bottom bottom of
[1:36:34] what God is not in the bottom he's
[1:36:37] up Hallelujah we should change it we
[1:36:41] should get to the
[1:36:44] up you know what brother I I I I did
[1:36:47] this because I wasn't really thinking
[1:36:49] I'm so sorry forgive me let's move
[1:36:52] forward and the
[1:36:57] and if you walk into somebody they
[1:36:59] talking bad about somebody say you know
[1:37:01] what brother we're not supposed to be
[1:37:02] doing this you know what sisters this is
[1:37:04] not okay we can't if you really need to
[1:37:06] help go see the person go help them
[1:37:10] let's pray how many believe Prayer
[1:37:12] Changes Things but how many times do we
[1:37:15] go on our knees to change the
[1:37:17] circumstance before we can talk about
[1:37:22] it amen
[1:37:24] I rather go to my knees I rather go to
[1:37:27] my knees and pray until God changes that
[1:37:30] circumstance without even the person
[1:37:32] knowing that I was praying for them than
[1:37:35] standing there and talking about
[1:37:39] it everybody wants to be a hero
[1:37:42] everybody wants to be to be the one with
[1:37:45] the wisdom to know that I'm the one who
[1:37:47] spoke I'm the one who prayed no you let
[1:37:50] me say you're not getting one credit
[1:37:54] what you get credit for is what happens
[1:37:56] in your
[1:37:58] [Applause]
[1:38:02] closet oh I lay hands on them that's why
[1:38:05] they're okay I did this who are you to
[1:38:08] begin with you are nothing you are
[1:38:13] nothing The Only Thing Worth is
[1:38:18] God but man wants to put himself into a
[1:38:22] place where let let me say this let's
[1:38:24] speak life and not
[1:38:30] death Matthew will say it this way oh I
[1:38:33] knew I wouldn't get
[1:38:35] there but I say unto
[1:38:38] you that every Idol
[1:38:40] word that men shall speak they shall
[1:38:44] give an account thereof in the day of
[1:38:47] judgment for by Thy word thou shall be
[1:38:50] justified and by Thy word th shall shall
[1:38:53] be
[1:38:55] condemned think about
[1:38:59] that every vain word do we even consider
[1:39:04] that you know it seems like if we're not
[1:39:07] careful and I'll just call myself on
[1:39:09] that it's like you you you were you were
[1:39:14] talking you were speaking your thought
[1:39:16] process like you haven't really even
[1:39:18] come to a conclusion yet but you're
[1:39:20] already speaking
[1:39:26] I think the Bible says that the person
[1:39:27] that talks too much commits
[1:39:30] sins what
[1:39:36] yeah so maybe we need to
[1:39:40] reduce condense our talking a little bit
[1:39:43] you
[1:39:44] know just condense it a little
[1:39:47] bit speak
[1:39:49] wisdom you know I I I grew up you know
[1:39:53] when I was young they used to tell us a
[1:39:55] story about The Lion and the and a and I
[1:39:58] believe a cow or or I don't know one of
[1:40:00] these animals with horns and so what
[1:40:03] happened is they say that one of this
[1:40:05] animal the lion always was afraid of
[1:40:08] them because every time he looked at the
[1:40:10] horns he wondered man what's in that
[1:40:12] mouth he said if he can stab me with the
[1:40:15] horns how much more with his mouth he
[1:40:16] could just bite me off and he was always
[1:40:19] scared of him until one day the lion is
[1:40:22] there just telling jokes and everybody's
[1:40:24] laughing he just started laughing and
[1:40:27] the lion looks in the mouth it's like oh
[1:40:29] this guy is
[1:40:33] stuffless and he became the Lion's meet
[1:40:36] since
[1:40:39] then and I think sometimes we do
[1:40:43] that we speak too much that we speak our
[1:40:47] wisdom away
[1:40:53] all the wisdom that could have been
[1:40:54] attributed to us gets lost in the
[1:40:57] multitude of
[1:41:05] words Romans will say that if thou shall
[1:41:09] confess in thy mouth the Lord Jesus and
[1:41:13] Shall Believe in thy heart that God has
[1:41:15] raised him from the dead and thou shalt
[1:41:18] be saved for it for with thy heart meant
[1:41:22] but for with the heart heart man
[1:41:23] believeth in unto righteousness and with
[1:41:26] a mouth man confess the with a mouth
[1:41:30] confession is made unto
[1:41:34] salvation whatam says if you say I'm not
[1:41:38] saved I'm not safe I'm not safe I'm not
[1:41:43] Sav you're walking out of
[1:41:47] it I'm not good I'm not good I'm not
[1:41:50] good you're walking out of it let me ask
[1:41:53] you a question if God saved you then how
[1:41:57] come you speaking it will change
[1:42:05] it isn't that
[1:42:10] amazing God wants you to repeat what he
[1:42:14] has done God wants our word to become
[1:42:18] his word let me jump to the end the
[1:42:20] bride has th say of the Lord or she
[1:42:23] skips
[1:42:25] still that's why where is the word at
[1:42:28] the end
[1:42:29] time the word is in the rde and she
[1:42:32] knows what to do with the what do we do
[1:42:35] with the word we speak it we change
[1:42:38] people's
[1:42:39] circumstances you know I was talking
[1:42:41] about Andrew earlier on if we're not
[1:42:44] careful our meetings become oh let's get
[1:42:47] together let's jump up and uh you know I
[1:42:49] touch you you heal my sicknesses and I
[1:42:51] come and you I touch you I heal your
[1:42:53] sicknesses and I deliver you and you
[1:42:55] deliver me and we do all of that we keep
[1:42:58] going in circle it's just
[1:43:00] us
[1:43:02] really that's the extent of the power of
[1:43:05] God that was given to us to just do it
[1:43:08] for one
[1:43:09] another it was given for you to go out
[1:43:13] there now I'm not saying we don't need
[1:43:15] healing we do God knows I need he
[1:43:18] doesn't need we need God knows we need
[1:43:20] in fact healing is the children's bread
[1:43:22] when we need it God will give it to us
[1:43:24] he's not going to let us go hungry he
[1:43:26] knows what we have need of but the
[1:43:29] purpose of a son is to speak life into a
[1:43:32] Dying World is to speak life where
[1:43:36] there's death is for him to go find the
[1:43:38] lost one is to go into a generation of
[1:43:41] dying and speak and let God come forth
[1:43:44] and bring this word to come to
[1:43:48] passen God didn't come into a perfect
[1:43:51] Eden that had everything in said let her
[1:43:54] be now imagine
[1:43:56] that he came into a void place a chaotic
[1:44:01] place a place that was without form
[1:44:05] that's where the word was
[1:44:19] needed I love this in Isaiah 50 and4
[1:44:23] perhaps I'll just read this one and come
[1:44:25] to some place to close Isaiah 15 and4
[1:44:28] says I love this it says if you could
[1:44:31] put it up there it says the Lord had
[1:44:34] given me the tongue of the
[1:44:39] learned that I should speak that I
[1:44:42] should know how to speak a word in
[1:44:45] season to him that is
[1:44:50] weary in I I saying the Lord had given
[1:44:54] me the tongue of the learner of the
[1:44:57] learn in other words the Lord has given
[1:45:00] me wisdom I have been given the tongue
[1:45:03] of one that's wise the one who's learned
[1:45:06] the one who's been blessed the one who's
[1:45:08] been converted that I should know when
[1:45:12] to speak the word that I should speak
[1:45:15] the word in season to him that is
[1:45:21] weary not just to speak vainly but I
[1:45:24] know there's a need right here that I
[1:45:27] have a recognition of the situation that
[1:45:30] I'll know what the circumstance is that
[1:45:33] I may speak the word of
[1:45:36] God but when I'm speaking the message
[1:45:38] testimony in the message law we know
[1:45:41] this one very well the message law he
[1:45:44] preaches Chicago Illinois
[1:46:01] it
[1:46:04] says it says now Paul's speaking here in
[1:46:08] the valley of the Shadow rather the law
[1:46:11] being a shadow of good things to come he
[1:46:14] says could never uh could never make the
[1:46:16] worship perfect he says then so he goes
[1:46:19] on and show what the per what what the
[1:46:23] Perfection is now isn't a strange thing
[1:46:25] that this is not so through uh it says
[1:46:29] it's so much through the uh uh thoughts
[1:46:31] of the people they say well I'm weak my
[1:46:35] Fai it's not much it's not very much I'm
[1:46:38] not a very I'm not a very good Christian
[1:46:40] it says just just what the devil wants
[1:46:43] you to say it says you are talking his
[1:46:46] language right there he says You must
[1:46:49] never say that don't ever let your
[1:46:51] testimony be negative negative let it be
[1:46:54] positive all the time I'm saved I have
[1:46:57] God in my heart I believe in with I
[1:46:59] believe in him with all my heart do you
[1:47:01] believe in Divine Healing with all my
[1:47:04] heart let your testimony always and your
[1:47:08] thoughts and everything never be permit
[1:47:11] it says never permit a negative thought
[1:47:13] to come into your mind if you can help
[1:47:16] it when it can start that it says when
[1:47:19] it starts that don't entertain it well
[1:47:23] you say I can't help the thought to come
[1:47:25] in
[1:47:27] well that it says it says don't be like
[1:47:30] a farmer that says it couldn't it
[1:47:32] couldn't stop he couldn't stop the bird
[1:47:35] from flying over his place but he could
[1:47:38] sure stop them from
[1:47:40] roosting don't entertain bad thoughts
[1:47:45] don't entertain evil thoughts don't
[1:47:48] entertain thoughts that are contrary to
[1:47:50] the word of God
[1:47:53] he says I couldn't stop them from HS
[1:47:55] thing he says that's a good thing see
[1:47:57] you can't help the thought when they
[1:47:59] come but don't entertain them just pass
[1:48:03] it on no he says no no sir Jesus Christ
[1:48:07] is my savior All Things Are Mine by God
[1:48:10] I'm it says I'm going to keep them I'm
[1:48:13] going to testify of them and God can
[1:48:16] only bless
[1:48:19] you as you confess that he has done it
[1:48:24] for
[1:48:25] you see he is the high priest of our
[1:48:29] confession is that right Hebrew three he
[1:48:32] says he says that he's the high priest
[1:48:34] of our confession and he can only do for
[1:48:37] us as we accept it and believe it and
[1:48:42] confess it thank you Lord that is the
[1:48:48] spoken word in action
[1:48:54] you say but I look in my flesh I can't
[1:48:56] help
[1:48:57] it yes you can just don't say
[1:49:00] it I don't care how many thoughts
[1:49:03] accumulate just don't let it
[1:49:06] out just don't let it out in fact when
[1:49:09] they accumulate just begin to speak the
[1:49:12] opposite you know good oh I'm just good
[1:49:15] right now
[1:49:23] oh you're not going to get this praise
[1:49:26] God he's already given it to
[1:49:30] me it's a fight it's a battle it's the
[1:49:34] Battle of making sure our minds are
[1:49:37] always on the right thing it's the Mind
[1:49:40] Battle of every day we woke up we put
[1:49:42] God first and we walk in his word and we
[1:49:45] confess his word we go forward we go
[1:49:48] forward knowing that what is spoken is
[1:49:50] going to come to pass it's the Conant
[1:49:53] Battle of knowing that my words amen
[1:49:56] have a
[1:49:58] weight my words what I speak butam says
[1:50:01] one place it says if God up there says
[1:50:04] by my stripes you are healed I will only
[1:50:07] repeat what he says it says if God set
[1:50:10] it up there and you confess it down here
[1:50:13] it will come to pass but if God set it
[1:50:15] up there you don't say it up here
[1:50:18] somewhere there's a breach in the
[1:50:20] electricity
[1:50:27] I was thinking
[1:50:32] about ba him if the musician could
[1:50:39] come y's called and they called him and
[1:50:41] they paid him so he can curse the
[1:50:45] children of Israel the ones that were
[1:50:47] with Moses they were just
[1:50:49] passing but balac hated them so bad that
[1:50:52] he wanted to see them go down he came
[1:50:55] and he paid a prophet and the prophet
[1:50:57] came and asked God God said no and then
[1:50:59] he came back and he tried to find a
[1:51:00] loophole for him to just figure out and
[1:51:03] and and then oh we're going to give you
[1:51:05] more money just do
[1:51:06] it he stand at the end and he
[1:51:10] says God is blessed I cannot
[1:51:15] curse it says behold I have not found
[1:51:19] iniquity in
[1:51:21] Jacob let me say this those that God has
[1:51:25] called and blessed and ordained we have
[1:51:29] no right to curse them that's
[1:51:37] right and it doesn't matter what stage
[1:51:40] they are in in the
[1:51:44] growth in the Emancipation Proclamation
[1:51:47] not everybody was at the same level but
[1:51:50] whatam says the younger one were able to
[1:51:52] run up there they could see the sun come
[1:51:55] up and oh I'm free oh they were able to
[1:51:58] scream and say I'm free why because they
[1:52:00] saw the sun rise but there were that
[1:52:03] were at the bottom of the mountain they
[1:52:06] were as free as those that were up in
[1:52:08] the mountain even though they couldn't
[1:52:10] see the sunrise with their eyes yet so
[1:52:13] just because a person cannot see the
[1:52:16] sunrise it doesn't mean they are not
[1:52:19] free they are free because the word says
[1:52:22] they are are free you are free because
[1:52:24] the word said you are free you are not
[1:52:26] free by Your Own Strength so I say
[1:52:29] tonight this morning let's speak the
[1:52:31] word but what him says speak to the Rock
[1:52:34] he says the rock is the Revelation The
[1:52:36] Rock was in the dry place he says here
[1:52:39] is the rock of God that was standing in
[1:52:41] the wilderness he says no matter what
[1:52:43] the situation was no matter what they
[1:52:46] had need of they were commanded to speak
[1:52:48] to the Rock so if they needed healing
[1:52:51] they spoke to the Rock if they needed
[1:52:53] Deliverance they spoke to the Rock
[1:52:54] whatever they now think about this in
[1:52:57] the wilderness how is water going to
[1:53:00] come out of the
[1:53:05] rock what says the most dest thing there
[1:53:09] is in the wilderness is the
[1:53:12] rock but yet God told them and says
[1:53:15] speak to
[1:53:19] it and let me ask you the next question
[1:53:22] since when does The Rock have
[1:53:27] years Hallelujah since when does the dry
[1:53:30] bone hear the word of God all ye dry
[1:53:34] bone he hear the word of the
[1:53:40] Lord am I the only
[1:53:44] one the word of God will
[1:53:46] penetrate
[1:53:50] everything everything
[1:53:52] if the
[1:53:54] rod of Aaron was taken a dry Rod placed
[1:53:59] into the presence of God it came alive I
[1:54:03] don't care how dead you are this morning
[1:54:05] just come in his presence you shall
[1:54:08] receive
[1:54:12] life so here we are we are giv life
[1:54:16] Let's Speak Life to everything Let's
[1:54:19] Speak Life in our circumstances Let's
[1:54:21] Speak Life life to everything we
[1:54:23] encounter something is not right don't
[1:54:25] dwell in the negative Speak Life to it
[1:54:28] get out of it to say I don't want to
[1:54:30] dwell in it I'm going to speak life if
[1:54:32] God could come and anoint the prophet to
[1:54:35] speak the scroll into existence in fact
[1:54:38] the prophet is there battling with it
[1:54:40] and saying well you know he said I've
[1:54:42] always looked at that scripture but I
[1:54:44] never understood it because every time I
[1:54:46] looked at it I thought well this can
[1:54:48] only happen after the atonement because
[1:54:51] the atonement is the pay of all the
[1:54:53] prices and the return of everything he
[1:54:55] says well then something told me well
[1:54:57] how come Joshua stopped the son that's
[1:54:59] before the atonment he says well I
[1:55:01] didn't know so I just left it
[1:55:04] alone but God wanted him to speak on it
[1:55:07] so God comes and he
[1:55:10] says yeah you are wanting to hunt don't
[1:55:13] you need squirrels don't you need
[1:55:15] something he said well I I do he says
[1:55:18] well why don't you speak it says
[1:55:23] well is that really
[1:55:25] you should I really
[1:55:28] speak he said yeah
[1:55:31] speak well before you
[1:55:34] speak how many do you
[1:55:37] want I love our
[1:55:41] god what color of our eyes do you
[1:55:45] want what do you really want God wants
[1:55:49] us to be
[1:55:50] expressive God don't want us to keep
[1:55:52] everything mental it's like someone
[1:55:54] saying I'm going to
[1:55:57] pray mentally
[1:56:00] speak God I'm here and I need this and
[1:56:03] this is happening and he want you to he
[1:56:05] wants to hear your
[1:56:07] voice he wants to hear you express
[1:56:10] yourself he wants to hear what's in the
[1:56:12] depths of your heart he wants to
[1:56:14] converse with you he want to hear like J
[1:56:17] like jobby says I want to go up to his
[1:56:19] door I want to open up and sit down I
[1:56:22] want to tell him what's in my heart
[1:56:25] don't you ever feel like well that's
[1:56:26] what he want he placed that desire in
[1:56:29] you so you can go after
[1:56:33] [Music]
[1:56:34] it but yet we are and we think oh maybe
[1:56:38] if I work over time then I'll get more
[1:56:40] money maybe no he wants you to speak the
[1:56:43] word the the situation is there to give
[1:56:46] you an opportunity so you can use your
[1:56:49] mouth and speak it's not given for for
[1:56:52] you to run away and go create another
[1:56:57] situation no it's given for you to say
[1:57:00] well I'm not going to run away I'm going
[1:57:04] to stand you and
[1:57:05] speak he said speak and go
[1:57:09] forward speak and go forward I'm not
[1:57:12] going to speak and forget I'm going to
[1:57:14] speak and wait until it
[1:57:18] happens why because the sons
[1:57:23] attribute is the same as the father's
[1:57:26] attribute if the father's attribute is
[1:57:29] to give life the only the son can only
[1:57:32] identify himself with that same
[1:57:35] attribute the only way we'll know that
[1:57:37] this is the son of such and such is by
[1:57:41] their life that they can produce did the
[1:57:44] prophet say that you have the power to
[1:57:47] impart eternal
[1:57:50] life and how many times do we use
[1:57:54] that how many times do we actually apply
[1:57:59] it but yet we are here believing that
[1:58:03] there's going to come a time where we
[1:58:05] can speak rain in somebody's crop where
[1:58:08] we're going to speak where the third
[1:58:10] pole will be manifested my question for
[1:58:13] you is
[1:58:14] when just tell me when if not now if not
[1:58:18] today if not this morning

[1:58:29] privileges I I was really touched and
[1:58:33] moved and my desire is not just to be a
[1:58:36] Christian and come here and preach a
[1:58:38] sermon after night I'm looking for

[1:59:05] over churches it's time we go past the
[1:59:09] churches and the programs and everything
[1:59:11] and all of those things it's time to get
[1:59:14] real and say God I want to touch you for
[1:59:18] myself I want that life to be manifest I
