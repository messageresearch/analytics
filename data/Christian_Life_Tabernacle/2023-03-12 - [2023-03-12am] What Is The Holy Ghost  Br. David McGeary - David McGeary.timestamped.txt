[15:31] I'm going to come and praise your name
[15:32] and to receive of you Lord

[15:40] break we pray to keep them all in safety
[15:42] wherever they might be and we ask okay
[15:44] you come and speak to us this morning
[15:46] let your blessings come down and
[15:48] minister to us as we come here to praise
[15:51] you in Jesus name amen amen you can turn
[15:55] around and just shake the hand to
[15:56] somebody tell them God bless you good
[15:57] morning beautiful sunny day we're happy
[16:01] to praise the Lord this morning amen as
[16:03] we just invite our brother Mike to read
[16:04] his song this morning amen
[16:09] foreign
[16:13] [Music]
[16:28] know those of you that work in corporate
[16:30] environments
[16:32] or in big businesses of really any kind
[16:34] you will be familiar with code of
[16:37] conduct training
[16:39] ethics training basically and
[16:42] you know the whole purpose of that
[16:44] is to
[16:46] you know describe the code of conduct is
[16:49] to basically describe the principles
[16:51] that that business is going to work
[16:53] using so that they can be trustworthy so
[16:57] that you know their customers and their
[16:59] suppliers and the government can all
[17:01] trust that this business is going to
[17:03] conduct itself
[17:04] ethically
[17:06] but they'll be trustworthy that they're
[17:07] going to do the right thing
[17:10] and you know we recently had
[17:13] to go through ours
[17:15] and it was basically a lengthy training
[17:17] to
[17:19] teach everyone
[17:21] once again
[17:22] how to be ethical and
[17:25] do the right thing
[17:27] and every year I go through that I ask
[17:30] myself the question shouldn't this just
[17:32] be common sense
[17:35] and then just as quickly it occurs to me
[17:38] that
[17:39] no
[17:41] you know unless there is something in
[17:43] that person
[17:45] some part of God
[17:49] All That Remains is Beast nature
[17:54] which at its best is temporarily
[17:57] controlled
[17:59] by rules
[18:00] or by teaching or by Behavior
[18:03] or
[18:04] you know commitment
[18:07] you know and it's really a surreal thing
[18:09] to go through training
[18:11] that basically is reminding people how
[18:14] to be good
[18:18] and to commit themselves each year to
[18:20] the task
[18:22] it's basically an annual confession from
[18:25] the company that they're acknowledging
[18:27] that people are
[18:29] generally not going to do the right
[18:30] thing
[18:32] unless we constantly remind them
[18:35] constantly make them promise
[18:37] to be good
[18:39] to remember how to act in a right manner
[18:43] to have integrity
[18:46] you know and it's uh some form of
[18:49] goodness if you will that they're trying
[18:50] to commit themselves to and
[18:53] you know but it requires constant
[18:55] reminding
[18:56] constant training constant teaching
[18:59] constant commitment constant discipline
[19:03] every year having to be reminded
[19:06] this is how to be good
[19:09] you know it's no different than someone
[19:10] trying to live a religious life
[19:13] you know whether that book
[19:16] that rule book is a code of conduct
[19:19] or the Bible itself
[19:23] you know a lifestyle of disciplining
[19:25] yourself according to a program
[19:29] you know something that requires
[19:31] constant reminding and teaching and
[19:33] discipline and commitment
[19:37] you know it's nothing more than a
[19:38] covering of what Fester is underneath
[19:43] you know obese nature that will
[19:45] naturally drift to the wrong thing
[19:51] now the bottom line is it's all fake
[19:54] you know that's the takeaway
[19:58] you know it none of that actually
[20:00] changes who people are
[20:04] it just gives them a way to pretend to
[20:06] be something
[20:08] than what they really are
[20:12] you know and except even if somebody is
[20:15] the most faithful
[20:17] at following those rules at its best
[20:21] we know that it's nothing more than
[20:23] filthy rags
[20:25] you know David knew something about that
[20:27] we're going to read Psalm 12 this
[20:29] morning
[20:30] and we could be living a descript we
[20:33] could be reading a description of the
[20:35] very age we live in
[20:37] you know it starts out help Lord For The
[20:40] Godly Man ceaseth
[20:43] for the faithful fall from Among The
[20:45] Children of Men
[20:47] they speak vanity
[20:50] everyone with his neighbor
[20:52] with flattering lips and with a double
[20:54] heart
[20:56] do they speak
[20:58] you know if that doesn't describe our
[20:59] day
[21:00] pretending
[21:02] to be good
[21:04] you know in many cases thinking that
[21:06] it's really working
[21:09] David says in verse 8 the wicked walk
[21:13] on every side
[21:15] when the vilest men
[21:17] or women
[21:19] are exalted
[21:22] that is in our hour
[21:25] a glorifying individuals who have the
[21:29] most perverted lives
[21:32] and celebrating them as Heroes
[21:36] examples of success
[21:38] voices of righteousness
[21:41] you know I read that and another
[21:43] scripture came to my mind and it was
[21:46] John 12 32 which said if I be lifted up
[21:50] I will draw all men unto me
[21:54] you know what's being lifted up
[21:57] you know what's being exalted
[22:01] based on what people are being pointed
[22:03] to
[22:06] you know all that program all that
[22:08] training all those Rule books at the end
[22:10] of the day they never bring people to
[22:13] Jesus Christ
[22:15] they bring you to the voting booth or to
[22:17] a training class or to a consultant or
[22:20] to a church or whatever but never too
[22:23] Jesus Christ himself
[22:26] and that tells you who's
[22:28] really being lifted up
[22:31] you know what caught my attention is
[22:33] this verse in verse six and this was a
[22:35] real blessing to me
[22:37] it said the words of the Lord are pure
[22:39] words
[22:41] as silver tried in a furnace of Earth
[22:46] purified
[22:47] seven times
[22:49] you know I thought of that as with all
[22:51] the fakeness the fake good that's about
[22:55] you know I'm so grateful that we have
[22:58] access to Pure words
[23:02] you know this is this phrase caught my
[23:04] attention as silver tried
[23:07] in a furnace of Earth
[23:10] you know that speaks of the refining
[23:11] process
[23:13] purifying process they used for silver
[23:16] back in his day and they still use it
[23:19] today
[23:20] the process is called compilation if you
[23:23] want to read it up read look it up and
[23:25] read all the technical details but you
[23:27] know the short story is this
[23:30] a little bit of silver
[23:33] is placed in a little Earthen vessel
[23:37] that silver is covered with all kinds of
[23:40] natural impurities
[23:43] but then a little bit of fire begins to
[23:45] be put on that Earthen vessel
[23:48] and all those impurities begin to be
[23:51] drawn out of that
[23:53] silver
[23:54] and All That Remains is pure silver
[24:00] you know purity
[24:02] is something that stands the test
[24:06] you know it proves
[24:09] fire proves what it is
[24:13] you know
[24:15] the word is want something that stands
[24:17] the test as well it's hands it stands
[24:19] the test so well that he's trusts it to
[24:22] put it in Earthen vessels
[24:24] full of impurity and in there
[24:28] it is made known
[24:29] even when the fire is applied to the
[24:32] Earth and vessel
[24:35] you know
[24:37] you think about all that goodness that's
[24:39] out there and it may create the
[24:40] appearance of goodness for a Time
[24:43] but just apply apply a little bit of
[24:45] fire to it
[24:47] and it'll tell you what's really made of
[24:51] but you know we want something that's
[24:52] placed inside
[24:55] something
[24:57] that is proven by fire
[25:00] something that matches the original
[25:03] the original pure silver
[25:07] you know not Earthen vessels painted
[25:09] silver
[25:12] but vessels filled with silver
[25:14] the word
[25:17] you know it's not about disciplining
[25:19] ourselves to be good we can go ahead and
[25:20] stand we're going to read that short
[25:22] we'll Psalm together
[25:24] or teaching ourselves to be good or
[25:27] disciplining ourselves to stay good or
[25:30] line up with the scriptures but it's
[25:32] about getting that silver inside our
[25:34] Earthen vessel
[25:36] you know John said it this way in first
[25:38] John 2 20 but ye have an unction from
[25:41] the Holy One
[25:43] and know all things
[25:46] and in verse 27 but the anointing which
[25:49] he have received of him abideth in you
[25:52] and ye need not that any man teach you
[25:56] but as the same anointing teacheth you
[25:59] of all things and is truth and is no lie
[26:03] and even as it has taught you ye shall
[26:06] abide in him
[26:07] silver in Earthen vessels
[26:11] you know so let's go ahead and read that
[26:13] Psalm together
[26:15] just think of what job said but he
[26:17] knoweth the way that I take
[26:19] when he has tried me
[26:21] I shall come forth as gold
[26:24] let's read that help Lord For The Godly
[26:28] Man ceaseth for the faithful fail from
[26:31] among the children of men they speak
[26:33] vanity every one with his neighbor with
[26:36] flattering lips and with a double heart
[26:38] do they speak the Lord shall cut off all
[26:41] flattering lips and the tongue that
[26:43] speaketh proud things who have said with
[26:45] our tongue will we Prevail our lips are
[26:48] our own who is Lord over us for the
[26:51] oppression of the poor for the sighing
[26:54] of the needy now will I arise saith the
[26:56] Lord I will set him in safety from him
[26:59] that puffeth at him the words of the
[27:02] Lord are pure words as silver tried in a
[27:05] furnace of Earth purified seven times
[27:08] Thou shalt keep them O Lord Thou shalt
[27:11] preserve them from this generation
[27:13] Forever The Wicked walk on every side
[27:16] when the vilest men are exalted
[27:23] amen God bless you you can have your
[27:25] seats

[1:03:05] this morning and
[1:03:07] because we're good musicians thank you
[1:03:09] so much
[1:03:11] this morning I work in Lord willing this
[1:03:14] is what everybody tells me
[1:03:18] and you know if God tells you something
[1:03:21] you can count on it
[1:03:23] if man tells you something you got a 50
[1:03:26] 50.
[1:03:27] you know what I mean but I've Been Told
[1:03:31] that they're going to start digging the
[1:03:34] plumbing in this Tuesday
[1:03:36] so we are going to start having some
[1:03:39] open ditches
[1:03:42] and so where you have to be extra
[1:03:44] careful to watch your children and some
[1:03:48] of the ditches will maybe be almost four
[1:03:50] feet deep most of them will not be but
[1:03:53] Rita's got to take extra care so if he
[1:03:56] takes Extra Care in this and then this
[1:04:00] coming week some of you brothers that
[1:04:02] might have spring break we do have a few
[1:04:05] projects that we have to get prepared in
[1:04:08] order for everything that come to pass
[1:04:12] so we certainly ask you to do
[1:04:15] help us out this next week if you can if
[1:04:18] you're on spring break and that will
[1:04:21] give you a coupon to McDonald's
[1:04:24] so we appreciate that you love the Lord
[1:04:28] this morning amen you know God's good to
[1:04:32] us
[1:04:33] and you know one of the promises of the
[1:04:35] scripture
[1:04:37] is that he would increase our
[1:04:39] understanding
[1:04:40] and we know our congregation is unique
[1:04:43] we're unique uh by uh the coming
[1:04:48] together of of many different countries
[1:04:52] different languages
[1:04:54] uh uh different people but all purchased
[1:04:58] by the same blood
[1:05:00] amen and and we're grateful uh for that
[1:05:05] uh
[1:05:06] we're also unique because we have a wide
[1:05:11] range of uh growth in the message we
[1:05:16] have a lot of new Believers we have a
[1:05:18] lot of people have been in the message
[1:05:20] two three four five ten years and then
[1:05:23] we've got those that have been longer
[1:05:26] and so our our our
[1:05:30] range of the uh word of God is is almost
[1:05:35] like from kindergarten to uh to college
[1:05:39] I guess if you would want to use that
[1:05:42] and so we can always grow and increase
[1:05:45] in the understanding of God's word but
[1:05:49] isn't it unique that God's work can
[1:05:51] reach you no matter what level you're at
[1:05:54] he's got something for you
[1:05:57] um
[1:05:58] so
[1:05:59] um this morning it just come on my heart
[1:06:02] uh to just talk to us a little bit this
[1:06:06] morning
[1:06:07] about what is the Holy Ghost
[1:06:10] that always seems to be the issue
[1:06:16] of do I have the Holy Ghost what is the
[1:06:19] Holy Ghost
[1:06:20] you know the prophet of God made a
[1:06:22] statement that is uh really something
[1:06:28] he said you know man doesn't know what
[1:06:30] electricity is
[1:06:34] they don't know what it is
[1:06:36] uh they they've got the they've got they
[1:06:40] can harness it
[1:06:41] uh they can make it turn on a light they
[1:06:44] can do all these things exactly but they
[1:06:47] don't know exactly what it is and they
[1:06:51] still don't I mean they know that they
[1:06:53] put two magnetos together and they
[1:06:56] rotate them and it produces some sort of
[1:06:59] field and and it's it's phenomenal but
[1:07:03] as much as they use it and they don't
[1:07:06] they can't put their finger on it and
[1:07:08] describe what it is except The Holy
[1:07:11] Spirits like that we don't know we can't
[1:07:14] really ever comprehend in our mind what
[1:07:19] it is the you know what I mean but uh
[1:07:23] but there's a there's a way that we can
[1:07:27] understand it and so that's what our
[1:07:30] hearts desire is this morning is to have
[1:07:33] Fellowship around the word to to
[1:07:36] establish a strong and understand it
[1:07:40] where it is that we're going
[1:07:42] so we've talked about
[1:07:45] we've talked about the God of this evil
[1:07:48] Age and and how many of those he's
[1:07:51] really stepping up on his throne
[1:07:53] I mean uh uh and and we know this is
[1:07:58] perilous times
[1:08:00] just to be honest with you uh
[1:08:05] if there's ever a time now that you need
[1:08:08] to Anchor in your faith and don't be
[1:08:12] afraid is is now they just had a large
[1:08:16] uh Bank collapse in

[1:08:35] stockholders and everything but we're
[1:08:37] divest we have money every place else
[1:08:40] you know but you could just see the
[1:08:42] dread in her face and I thought you know

[1:08:49] less than Jesus Christ in his
[1:08:52] righteousness Amen on Christ the solid
[1:08:55] rock I stand all other ground is sinking
[1:08:59] sand and I thought oh there you know

[1:09:03] and they say oh this is going to call
[1:09:05] the layoffs everywhere and and this and
[1:09:08] that you know what and I just thought
[1:09:10] wow
[1:09:13] the scripture says the righteous shall
[1:09:16] not beg bread
[1:09:17] amen be content in whatever state that
[1:09:21] you're in amen so I'm glad I'm in the
[1:09:24] state of Texas but the uh about
[1:09:29] uh I just thought you know it's it that

[1:09:40] has just taken a crash in everything
[1:09:43] thought technology was the savior of us

[1:09:48] amen and there's still one spirit
[1:09:52] by where we're all baptized One Faith

[1:10:34] stand this morning and turn in our
[1:10:36] Bibles
[1:10:41] okay
[1:10:42] and we're going to read in Acts 7.
[1:11:02] and uh
[1:11:08] so this is
[1:11:11] Paul
[1:11:13] uh standing before the council
[1:11:17] and uh
[1:11:21] they had brought Paul in because of what
[1:11:25] that he's preaching
[1:11:27] and Paul is now addressing the council
[1:11:32] and the Jews and the elders and he
[1:11:35] begins to speak to him and we're going
[1:11:37] to take this text from the seventh to
[1:11:40] the eighth verse then said
[1:11:43] the high priest
[1:11:45] are these things so
[1:11:49] and uh
[1:11:52] and
[1:11:53] and he said men Brethren and fathers
[1:11:58] hearken
[1:11:59] the god of Glory appeareth unto our
[1:12:03] Father Abraham
[1:12:05] when he was in
[1:12:07] mesopedonia before he dealt in Charon
[1:12:13] and said unto him get thee out of thy
[1:12:17] country and from thy Kindred and come
[1:12:21] unto the land which I shall show thee
[1:12:26] and he came out of the land of chaldea
[1:12:30] and came out of the Lamb the Chaldeans
[1:12:33] and dwelt in Charon and from hence when
[1:12:37] his father was dead he moved him into
[1:12:41] this land wherein ye now dwell
[1:12:46] and he gave him
[1:12:49] none inheritance in it
[1:12:52] no not so much as to set foot on yet he
[1:12:58] promised that he would give
[1:13:01] it to him for a possession and to his
[1:13:06] seed after him when as yet he had no
[1:13:11] child
[1:13:13] Hallelujah
[1:13:15] and God spake unto this why God spake on
[1:13:19] this wise
[1:13:20] that his seed should sojourn in a
[1:13:24] Strange Land
[1:13:25] and that they should
[1:13:28] bring them into bondage and then treat
[1:13:32] them evil 400 years
[1:13:34] and the nation to whom they shall be in
[1:13:39] bondage will I judge say God and after
[1:13:44] that shall they come forth and serve me
[1:13:48] in this place and he gave him the
[1:13:53] Covenant of circumcision
[1:13:56] and so Abraham begot Isaac and
[1:14:00] circumcised him the Eighth Day and Isaac
[1:14:04] begot Jacob and Jacob begot the 12
[1:14:08] Patriarchs May the father bless his word
[1:14:12] in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:14:16] maybe she's
[1:14:34] I'd like to read this little statement
[1:14:37] here before we start because I thought
[1:14:40] it was uh pretty comforting as we go
[1:14:44] forward in our our thing
[1:14:47] today but we'd like to make this there
[1:14:50] is nothing that will defeat Satan
[1:14:53] there's never been nothing on the earth
[1:14:57] yet that would defeat Satan like the
[1:15:01] word of God
[1:15:03] Jesus said in his greatest battle he
[1:15:07] said it is written
[1:15:11] amen and I I thought this would just be
[1:15:15] nice to read
[1:15:17] he said in this morning well I've been
[1:15:19] listening a few days ago to a broadcast
[1:15:23] that seemed to want to tell that
[1:15:27] creation just come from some ashes
[1:15:31] blowing together and some phosphate and
[1:15:35] a few chemicals on the earth and the
[1:15:39] warm sunshine created The Germ of life
[1:15:43] and brought out life
[1:15:46] said how ridiculous
[1:15:49] when the sunshine will kill any germ of
[1:15:52] life lay a germ out in the sun shine and
[1:15:55] it'll kill it immediately
[1:15:57] and there is no such thing but Satan
[1:16:02] trying to punch at me
[1:16:04] and after I had taken my little Rebecca
[1:16:07] to school this morning and on the road
[1:16:10] back I started to turn the radio on
[1:16:13] again
[1:16:14] and I thought I'd get into that stuff
[1:16:17] again so I just turned it back off
[1:16:22] and and as I was going up the street
[1:16:25] Satan said to me he said do you know
[1:16:29] that this man that you call Jesus was
[1:16:33] just a man
[1:16:34] like one day in his life like Billy
[1:16:39] Graham or Oral Roberts
[1:16:41] he was just a man that they began to
[1:16:44] have a few people together around him
[1:16:47] and to say he's a great man and after a
[1:16:51] while he became greater
[1:16:53] and then he become a God to them and now
[1:16:57] it's scattered all over the world since
[1:17:00] he's dead and that's all
[1:17:05] Satan telling them you know
[1:17:08] and I thought
[1:17:10] how a liar you are
[1:17:13] and then I turned just as I was crossing
[1:17:16] Graham Street I said Satan
[1:17:21] you that's talking to my conscience
[1:17:24] I'd like to ask you a few things
[1:17:28] who was it that the Hebrew Prophet spoke
[1:17:31] of
[1:17:32] that would come
[1:17:34] who was the anointed Messiah
[1:17:37] what was upon those men that foresaw him
[1:17:42] and told his life a thousand years
[1:17:46] before he got there
[1:17:50] who was it that foretold it just
[1:17:54] to the letter
[1:17:56] and when he come they said he would be
[1:17:59] numbered with the transgressors and he
[1:18:02] was
[1:18:03] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:18:06] and he was
[1:18:08] he was he made his grave with the rich
[1:18:13] but he should rise on the third day and
[1:18:17] he did
[1:18:18] and he promised the Holy Ghost and I've
[1:18:22] got it
[1:18:23] so you just might as well get away from
[1:18:28] it because it's written in the word and
[1:18:32] every word is true
[1:18:35] then he left
[1:18:38] just give him the word that does it he
[1:18:43] can't stand the word for it's inspired
[1:18:48] amen so he said he said to it he said
[1:18:52] and he said and he promised the Holy
[1:18:56] Ghost
[1:18:58] and I got it
[1:18:59] so you might as well get away from it
[1:19:03] and so he began to take this message he
[1:19:06] says well what is the Holy Ghost
[1:19:08] and in approaching this I I I'd like to
[1:19:12] read these things and then we'll just
[1:19:13] preach a little bit on what's there you
[1:19:16] can always go get the message yourself
[1:19:18] and I encourage you that you do
[1:19:22] foreign
[1:19:24] he said
[1:19:27] upon this place
[1:19:30] we wish to her the scriptures we just
[1:19:33] read we wish to approach the subject
[1:19:36] which I was think is an outstanding
[1:19:39] subject today of the what is the Holy
[1:19:44] Spirit
[1:19:46] what is it
[1:19:48] and now the reason I have taken these
[1:19:53] subjects in line like this
[1:19:57] is you can't you cannot come and receive
[1:20:01] the Holy Spirit and let you know what it
[1:20:05] is
[1:20:09] and you cannot receive it if you
[1:20:14] you cannot receive it if you know what
[1:20:17] it is unless you believe it's given to
[1:20:22] you
[1:20:26] and it's for you
[1:20:30] so that that's something
[1:20:32] you know what I mean you're not going to
[1:20:35] seek something you don't think's for you
[1:20:36] all right
[1:20:38] if this is for you and then you cannot
[1:20:41] know whether you've got it or not unless
[1:20:45] you know what results it brings
[1:20:52] now that's a great one isn't it
[1:20:55] you don't know whether you've got it or
[1:20:57] not unless you know what results it
[1:21:01] brings
[1:21:03] back and so that's where so many people
[1:21:07] had got confused because different
[1:21:10] people started coming up with the
[1:21:12] different definitions of the results
[1:21:15] thus came the false doctrine that
[1:21:18] tongues was the evidence of the holy
[1:21:21] spirit that it it's uh in fact tongues
[1:21:25] is the least of all the gifts when you
[1:21:28] hear that somebody speaking in tongues
[1:21:31] you can know one thing they have a long
[1:21:33] ways to go
[1:21:35] because they're just at the bottom
[1:21:38] amen of course it's it it became to
[1:21:42] where it was a false Doctrine that's the
[1:21:45] the uh that's the evidence of it and so
[1:21:49] they people had to have that evidence
[1:21:53] because they they wanted to know what
[1:21:56] result it brings so how do I know I got
[1:21:59] the Holy Ghost okay did you speak in
[1:22:01] tongues
[1:22:03] and then they say well that's the result
[1:22:05] of the Holy Spirit do you think the holy
[1:22:08] spirit is so little
[1:22:11] that that's the result of it
[1:22:14] oh no it goes It goes beyond everything
[1:22:20] it's marvelous
[1:22:22] tell what it is so we're just going to
[1:22:25] run down and approach this research
[1:22:27] you've got to know you've got to know
[1:22:31] uh uh
[1:22:35] what results it brings and if you know
[1:22:38] what it is
[1:22:40] and who it's to
[1:22:42] and what action
[1:22:44] it brings when it comes then you'll know
[1:22:49] what you've got when you get it
[1:22:53] and then that settles it then you'll
[1:22:56] know what you got when you did it how
[1:22:59] many people have received the spirit of
[1:23:01] the Lord and they're still not sure
[1:23:04] whether they've got it
[1:23:06] Satan just continually uh Badgers you
[1:23:10] and Badgers you and
[1:23:13] because if you're not sure of it you
[1:23:16] won't use it
[1:23:18] is
[1:23:19] so we're just going to just take a
[1:23:24] little approach this morning the the way
[1:23:27] our our messenger
[1:23:30] I I took it and and so we know that uh
[1:23:36] with Abraham
[1:23:38] with Abraham
[1:23:40] Abraham is a type of the believer how
[1:23:45] many knows that in fact he's the father
[1:23:47] of our faith so when you see how God
[1:23:51] deals with Abraham you know that if God
[1:23:54] ever deals with one son he'll deal with
[1:23:57] that son always and so if he deals with
[1:24:00] that son the way he dealt with Abraham
[1:24:02] and what Abraham's righteousness
[1:24:06] was attributed to Abraham was his faith
[1:24:10] that he believed God in fact the fact
[1:24:14] that he told the king
[1:24:16] that his wife was a sister
[1:24:19] wasn't even held imputed to him
[1:24:23] it wasn't even held against them and he
[1:24:26] just didn't do it once he did it twice
[1:24:31] you understand but he he but what was
[1:24:35] righteous about Abraham was that he
[1:24:38] believed God
[1:24:40] he believed God I think there was just
[1:24:42] something in Abraham that down in his
[1:24:45] heart he was waiting on the Lord he knew
[1:24:48] that he knew oh I'm in trouble here and
[1:24:51] and I'm going to do this and I'm going
[1:24:54] to lie but I think in his heart he felt
[1:24:56] the Lord would get him out why because
[1:24:58] he had a covenant he had a promise
[1:25:03] and that's what was Imperial to Abraham
[1:25:07] for righteousness and so Abraham being a
[1:25:10] type of a Believer Abraham was told move
[1:25:14] out
[1:25:15] come out of your land come after me and
[1:25:19] I'm going to show you a land and your
[1:25:21] seeds gonna possess the land it's going
[1:25:24] to be like the stars in the in Abraham
[1:25:27] believed that and he came out of the
[1:25:33] land and then God gave him a sign of
[1:25:38] circumcision
[1:25:39] and that is a type
[1:25:42] of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:44] Coke and just look at each of us today
[1:25:49] as we just Fellowship around this in our
[1:25:53] lives right each of Our Lives Many of Us
[1:25:56] come from different places and different
[1:25:59] times in life I came out of the 60s so
[1:26:02] you know at that time hippie-ism and
[1:26:05] music and all that stuff was the thing
[1:26:08] that was gathering and collecting young
[1:26:11] people up and we all ran around with
[1:26:14] long hair and uh and now the only time
[1:26:18] you'll see long hair on somebody is is
[1:26:20] if they're in their 70s or something
[1:26:23] it's the whole style changed the whole
[1:26:27] music changed the whole look changed you
[1:26:30] know again it just something but but
[1:26:34] each of us in our life no matter where
[1:26:37] we were at in our life no matter where
[1:26:40] we come from whether or not you grew up
[1:26:43] in a Christian home you know Christians
[1:26:46] in a Christian home still have to have a
[1:26:49] Christian experience
[1:26:52] and so we find out that the that the he
[1:26:57] said
[1:26:58] so each of us no matter where we are
[1:27:00] living
[1:27:01] how deep in sin or how what we might
[1:27:04] call a little sin or not such a bad life
[1:27:08] it doesn't matter
[1:27:11] you understand when you're in sin you're
[1:27:13] away from God
[1:27:15] and so no matter where we were
[1:27:19] the the Spirit by the hearing of the
[1:27:24] word of God brought us under conviction
[1:27:29] and your heart was pricked and you felt
[1:27:33] condemnation
[1:27:35] that's what happened
[1:27:37] God convicted you and uh
[1:27:42] and so when when God convicted you and
[1:27:47] brought you under condemnation and you
[1:27:50] realized that that you're lost
[1:27:55] I'm lost I'm not going to go to heaven
[1:27:58] in the condition I'm in I'm separated
[1:28:01] from God a lot of us realize we didn't
[1:28:05] have any control over our lives Spirits
[1:28:08] were just running our lives I had a
[1:28:11] terrible terrible temper and if I mean
[1:28:14] if you popped my cork there was no
[1:28:17] telling what would take place
[1:28:20] okay it was it was terrible I I needed
[1:28:24] the help of the Lord and and I was
[1:28:27] Chained and bound with complexes and and
[1:28:31] all those things and then the spirit of
[1:28:33] the Lord by reading the Bible I read in
[1:28:36] Romans chapter one and when I heard it I
[1:28:39] I realized what condition I was in what
[1:28:42] group of people I was running with uh
[1:28:45] the crowd that I was was was
[1:28:48] hanging around with in the spirits that
[1:28:51] was around me was exactly what Paul
[1:28:53] describes as he went down through Romans
[1:28:56] 1 and I I wanted out
[1:29:03] I didn't want to go where that was going
[1:29:06] I didn't want to be the way that I was
[1:29:10] and and so that's what happened to all
[1:29:12] of us
[1:29:13] and we cried out
[1:29:16] unto the Lord
[1:29:18] and then the Lord made a covenant
[1:29:22] with us
[1:29:25] in in that that's what he did he made a
[1:29:29] covenant with each of us and so he made
[1:29:31] a covenant with you if you would repent
[1:29:36] and turn from your ways
[1:29:39] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:29:42] Jesus Christ that I'll give you the Holy
[1:29:46] Spirit
[1:29:48] that's what he said
[1:29:50] so that was his promise that was his
[1:29:53] Covenant promised
[1:29:56] to the believer so to Abraham
[1:30:00] when heat came out of the land and he
[1:30:03] did what God said he was obedient he
[1:30:06] came out of the land God gave him a sign
[1:30:11] that he accepted Abraham's faith
[1:30:15] and he gave him the sign of circumcision
[1:30:21] so first thing we know what the holy
[1:30:24] spirit is it's a sign
[1:30:28] it's it's it's a a sign now and as we do
[1:30:34] this we've got to I'm going to read this
[1:30:36] statement he says now there is a vast
[1:30:41] difference between just a Christian and
[1:30:45] a holy ghost-filled Christian
[1:30:50] now this is good
[1:30:55] because we want to know what it is
[1:30:58] we want to I want to know I've got it
[1:31:02] I want to know what it does what action
[1:31:04] it brings
[1:31:06] he says between a holy ghost filled with
[1:31:09] us and now we're going to get this from
[1:31:14] the scriptures and place it just exactly
[1:31:17] in the scriptures the first place there
[1:31:21] is a Christian professed to be a
[1:31:24] Christian
[1:31:26] but if this Christian has not yet been
[1:31:29] filled with the Holy Ghost he's only in
[1:31:34] process
[1:31:36] of being a Christian
[1:31:39] there's nothing wrong with the process
[1:31:41] as long as you understand that
[1:31:45] there's no condemnation
[1:31:48] right
[1:31:50] you're in the process when I first
[1:31:53] became a Christian uh I you know I still
[1:31:59] had all my music I still had everything
[1:32:02] I believed in the Lord I wanted to be
[1:32:04] different right but it took me a while
[1:32:07] to to Really prove
[1:32:11] to the Lord
[1:32:13] that I really wanted to come out
[1:32:17] so you can profess
[1:32:20] and struggle
[1:32:22] you understand but as long as you're
[1:32:24] kind of running back and and going back
[1:32:27] in and out back and forth and traveling
[1:32:29] your
[1:32:31] professing you're believing unto
[1:32:34] you know what I mean but it could but
[1:32:37] there's there's something that's going
[1:32:38] to happen
[1:32:40] it's okay Abraham had to come out
[1:32:45] and when he came out
[1:32:47] then
[1:32:50] God accepted it
[1:32:53] it said but if a Christian has not yet
[1:32:56] been for the Holy Ghost he's only in the
[1:32:58] process of being a Christian
[1:33:00] see if he profess us to believe it he's
[1:33:04] working to it
[1:33:06] but God has yet to give him his Spirit
[1:33:10] of the Holy Ghost he's not yet reached
[1:33:14] that goal with God that God recognizes
[1:33:17] it
[1:33:20] well the thing about it is is God knows
[1:33:24] whether you're sincere or not he also
[1:33:26] knows when you're going to be sincere
[1:33:29] but you can't go you can't get rid of
[1:33:32] the labor process
[1:33:36] that's what they want to do today they
[1:33:39] don't want anybody doesn't want to go
[1:33:40] through to the labor to have a child you
[1:33:44] know what I mean they'll do anything to
[1:33:46] get out of it in fact they don't even
[1:33:47] want children nowadays
[1:33:52] I actually heard this with my own ears I
[1:33:55] couldn't believe it but look I heard
[1:33:58] several women says well we don't want to
[1:34:01] have children because I suffer
[1:34:04] with
[1:34:06] environmental stress
[1:34:11] I suffer with environmental anxiety
[1:34:15] I'm so worried about the environment
[1:34:18] I am so worried about the failure of of
[1:34:23] the stars in the moon and the air in the
[1:34:27] water that that I don't want to have
[1:34:29] children because I don't want them to
[1:34:31] bring them into a Dying World well how
[1:34:33] about a dying soul
[1:34:40] you know that's a Godless Society
[1:34:45] that thinks that this the water and and
[1:34:48] the wind I know one that's the master of
[1:34:51] the wind I know one that's the master of
[1:34:54] the sea I know one that will provide
[1:35:00] he can feed 12 000 with some fishes and
[1:35:03] some loaves I'm sure he can take care of
[1:35:05] me
[1:35:09] they eat that there he said that as
[1:35:12] we're reading
[1:35:13] he says because that God made a covenant
[1:35:16] with Abraham after he called Abraham
[1:35:19] which is a type of calling the believer
[1:35:22] today
[1:35:23] he called Abraham and Abraham moved out
[1:35:26] of his country and went into a Strange
[1:35:29] Land to dwell among strange people
[1:35:33] and that was a type of when God calls a
[1:35:37] man to stop his meanness
[1:35:40] repent of his sins
[1:35:43] he turns then from the crowd that he was
[1:35:47] in
[1:35:48] to live in a new crowd amongst the new
[1:35:53] type of people
[1:35:55] and then after God found Abraham to be
[1:35:59] faithful
[1:36:00] to the promise that God gave him
[1:36:04] that he would have a child and through
[1:36:07] this child all the Earth would be
[1:36:09] blessed then Abraham confirmed his faith
[1:36:13] by giving him a sign and that sign was
[1:36:17] circumcision and circumcision is a type
[1:36:21] of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:24] so after the after you believed
[1:36:29] and you come out of the crowd
[1:36:34] and you you separated yourself
[1:36:38] now he's going to he promised you
[1:36:42] right if you repent
[1:36:45] and you're baptized that he would give
[1:36:48] you the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit
[1:36:51] is a uh is a a sign
[1:36:56] to you circumcision is a type of the
[1:37:00] Holy Ghost and he gave Abraham's
[1:37:03] circumcision sign after he had accepted
[1:37:07] God on his promise and walked out into a
[1:37:11] strange country see
[1:37:14] and that's what God uses today it's a
[1:37:17] sign of circumcision of the heart
[1:37:21] the holy spirit that makes God's Church
[1:37:25] separated the church from all Creeds
[1:37:29] faiths denominations they're in all
[1:37:33] kinds of denominations but yet they are
[1:37:36] a separated people
[1:37:38] so the the holy the holy spirit is a
[1:37:44] sign to you
[1:37:49] it's the sign that God has accepted your
[1:37:54] sincerity
[1:37:56] and that you believe it's a promise
[1:38:00] and that you believe that he forgave you
[1:38:05] so if you believe that he forgave you
[1:38:08] so you're brought under conviction
[1:38:10] you're you're you you realize you're
[1:38:13] wrong you want to come out you you tell
[1:38:16] God that I'm sorry I want to be
[1:38:19] different but if you don't change
[1:38:21] anything
[1:38:24] if you if you you don't make no
[1:38:28] difference the Holy Spirit isn't an add
[1:38:30] to
[1:38:32] right
[1:38:34] that's what it is it's just not an
[1:38:36] attitude it's not something that you you
[1:38:39] use one is well we just keep going
[1:38:42] onwards it is so what what's it it it's
[1:38:46] a sign to the believer it's a
[1:38:50] distinction
[1:38:52] so what did what did circumcised
[1:38:55] decision
[1:38:56] to Duke to Abraham it was a sign that
[1:39:00] Abraham had this promise
[1:39:04] right now the promise was to him
[1:39:08] and do his seed
[1:39:10] so every
[1:39:12] offspring of Abraham
[1:39:15] cooked the sign of circumcision and
[1:39:20] that's what distinguished them and
[1:39:24] separated them from all the other
[1:39:27] peoples in the land was this Mark
[1:39:32] and that's what the holy spirit is it's
[1:39:35] the mark
[1:39:36] upon the believer that he's of God
[1:39:44] that he's not of this world
[1:39:46] in fact he's been separated out
[1:39:49] because that he's different
[1:39:54] it's a sign to you
[1:39:57] that's what he gives you if you've been
[1:40:00] sincere and you've been sincere and so
[1:40:03] don't don't try to take it into that if
[1:40:07] you don't accept it at its first level
[1:40:11] then you're wanting it to be something
[1:40:14] that is not
[1:40:18] that's the first thing that the Holy
[1:40:20] Spirit does it's a sign to you it's
[1:40:23] settled
[1:40:26] it's a sign
[1:40:27] it's a sign of separation
[1:40:32] your your spirit is now what
[1:40:35] different
[1:40:38] it's changed you
[1:40:41] you've got something now in your heart
[1:40:43] that makes you different it you're not
[1:40:46] you don't run with these people no more
[1:40:49] now the flesh is still
[1:40:52] Satan always is going to war against the
[1:40:55] flesh
[1:40:57] you're going to have that but you that
[1:41:00] he's given you something
[1:41:02] it's a sign to you that that that he's
[1:41:05] that that you've been separated that
[1:41:09] you're a distinct person
[1:41:12] that you know that you're different
[1:41:15] I'm just not what I used to be
[1:41:19] I've been changed
[1:41:21] I I I've caught this that something took
[1:41:25] place and and you you want to know
[1:41:28] something
[1:41:30] is not only assigned to you
[1:41:33] it's assigned to everybody else around
[1:41:36] you
[1:41:39] what happened to him
[1:41:42] he used to the scripture says he they
[1:41:46] think it's strange that you no longer
[1:41:48] run with them you no longer talk the way
[1:41:50] you talk if you no longer act the way
[1:41:53] that you act that you wanted to be
[1:41:55] different you wanted to be separated God
[1:41:58] called you he brought you under
[1:41:59] conviction he heard the word you
[1:42:02] answered that
[1:42:05] you said you were sorry
[1:42:07] you came out from amongst them
[1:42:10] you can you you you you you're not you
[1:42:13] don't go where they go you don't you
[1:42:15] stopped your meanness you stop those
[1:42:17] things and God looks upon you and you've
[1:42:20] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:42:22] Jesus Christ and you're sincere he
[1:42:25] promised you
[1:42:27] I'll give you my spirit
[1:42:31] I'll be with you
[1:42:33] even in you till the end
[1:42:36] so if you're battling within your
[1:42:38] sincerity
[1:42:41] and there's still things of the world
[1:42:43] you like
[1:42:45] then you can never come to the assurance
[1:42:50] that you have that indwelling spirit
[1:42:54] so what will happen is is that there's a
[1:42:58] compromise out there
[1:43:00] a false Revival
[1:43:02] that'll let the rain fall on the outside
[1:43:08] but it's not what's the desire of your
[1:43:11] heart
[1:43:12] and a Spirit-filled Christian
[1:43:16] is desire
[1:43:18] is to serve God
[1:43:21] to be free from the world to be free
[1:43:24] from the sins of the world to be free
[1:43:26] from anger and bitterness and talking
[1:43:29] and backbiting and all those ungodly
[1:43:32] things and christ-like things you have
[1:43:35] such a desire for it that you're longing
[1:43:38] for it you're longing to have that right
[1:43:42] spirit
[1:43:43] and when when that's really there
[1:43:48] so what happened to the world that they
[1:43:52] they people didn't want to give all of
[1:43:55] their life to Christ so they gave them a
[1:43:57] false sign
[1:44:00] of speaking in tongues but the real
[1:44:03] spirit is assigned to the believer that
[1:44:06] God has accepted your faith and accepted
[1:44:10] your call and accepted your desire
[1:44:14] hey amen oh
[1:44:17] it's just it's wonderful
[1:44:20] but what else is it
[1:44:22] it's a seal
[1:44:28] okay so when you when you when you have
[1:44:30] the Holy Spirit
[1:44:32] if it's a seal and I hope this morning
[1:44:35] by talking about it if you you say well
[1:44:38] I don't have that
[1:44:40] then you will say I want it
[1:44:45] and then you know the formula to get it
[1:44:48] repent
[1:44:50] be baptized in the name Lord Jesus
[1:44:52] Christ you say well I have done that
[1:44:55] that then then follow the rest of it
[1:44:58] separate yourself
[1:45:00] circumcise your life
[1:45:04] cut away the world
[1:45:08] when you do that that was the process
[1:45:12] then you can number yourself
[1:45:15] amongst the separated
[1:45:18] and he will give you
[1:45:20] his spirit
[1:45:25] you say well I want a sensation I'll
[1:45:27] tell you if I lose the desire for
[1:45:29] something that's entangled me for years
[1:45:31] and years I know that ain't me
[1:45:37] so it's a seal like Ephesians 4 30 says
[1:45:42] it says grief not the Holy Spirit where
[1:45:45] you are sealed unto the day of your
[1:45:48] Redemption
[1:45:49] so what is it if it's God letting you
[1:45:53] know that it's a finished work
[1:45:58] in other words nothing's going to pluck
[1:46:01] you out of the palm of my hand
[1:46:05] no that's that's not talking about
[1:46:07] knowing it in a
[1:46:13] you know that bears witness with your
[1:46:16] spirit
[1:46:17] that it's finished
[1:46:21] the work is finished it's over I'm saved
[1:46:25] I'm Glory bound I'm going to heaven
[1:46:30] I've been purchased the spirit is a seal
[1:46:35] that bears Witness
[1:46:39] that he's accepted you and sealed you
[1:46:44] which means it sent you to your
[1:46:47] destination
[1:46:50] we know our messenger uses the rail car
[1:46:55] he says when that car is ready to be
[1:46:57] shipped to its destination that there's
[1:47:00] a seal to put on it that uh
[1:47:05] that lets them know that this is where
[1:47:09] it's going and nothing can stop it from
[1:47:12] going there it won't be opened but he
[1:47:14] makes this this statement and I thought
[1:47:16] this was good he says notice how long
[1:47:20] does that seal last not until the next
[1:47:23] Revival
[1:47:25] until the next time
[1:47:27] something goes wrong
[1:47:30] until the day of your Redemption that's
[1:47:33] how long you're sealed until the day of
[1:47:37] your Redemption when you are redeemed up
[1:47:41] in to be with God that's how long the
[1:47:45] Holy Spirit seals you
[1:47:48] in other words I will not leave you nor
[1:47:51] forsake you but I'll be with you even in
[1:47:55] you till the end
[1:47:57] that's what it is so when you have the
[1:48:01] spirit
[1:48:02] you have the witness of God's word in
[1:48:07] your heart
[1:48:10] nobody's going to rob that
[1:48:13] but he says here's what happens
[1:48:16] he says
[1:48:18] that's what's the matter
[1:48:20] we don't get sealed so much we're too
[1:48:24] loose about things
[1:48:26] when the inspector goes through to
[1:48:28] inspect your life to see if you're
[1:48:32] you're not just a little loose about
[1:48:34] things a little loose about your prayer
[1:48:37] life a little loose about your temper a
[1:48:40] little loose about the tongue to talk
[1:48:43] about others
[1:48:45] uh
[1:48:46] He he'll never seal the car
[1:48:50] some dirty habit some vile things some
[1:48:53] Bulgarian mind he can't seal the car but
[1:48:57] when he's found everything in its in its
[1:49:01] place the inspector then he seals it
[1:49:05] dare anybody open that seal till that
[1:49:08] car reaches its destination to where
[1:49:11] it's sealed for there it is touch not
[1:49:14] mine anointed doomed by prophets no harm
[1:49:18] for I say unto you could be better for a
[1:49:22] millstone to be hanged about your neck
[1:49:25] then
[1:49:26] and you were drowned in the depths of
[1:49:29] the sea then tried to offend or shake a
[1:49:33] little one of the least of these that's
[1:49:36] been sealed
[1:49:39] you see what it means
[1:49:42] it's a seal
[1:49:45] so you're saying what is the holy spirit
[1:49:47] these are the things he gives you
[1:49:51] we want a sensation
[1:49:54] but it's it it it's a uh
[1:49:59] it's a seal that that that lets you know
[1:50:03] that uh it it it lets you know the
[1:50:07] work's over
[1:50:08] I've done the work I've accepted your
[1:50:12] faith
[1:50:14] you've you can't get a pardon tell you
[1:50:17] what
[1:50:18] accept it
[1:50:20] so I I've received the pardon
[1:50:23] you can't be sealed if you're still not
[1:50:25] sure he forgave you
[1:50:29] and if you're not sure he forgave you
[1:50:31] it's because you don't believe his word
[1:50:35] he said if you confess your sins I'm
[1:50:38] faithful and just to forgive them
[1:50:43] we're talking about how do I know I have
[1:50:45] the Holy Spirit Well if you know you've
[1:50:48] been forgiven and you know your life's
[1:50:51] not the same and you know your desires
[1:50:53] have been changed you know you're not
[1:50:55] the person that there's been a nature
[1:50:57] change in you you've received the you've
[1:51:01] received that sign from God
[1:51:06] because then now there's a different
[1:51:08] Spirit In You
[1:51:11] you didn't make that Spirit up
[1:51:16] you all of a sudden didn't go sit down
[1:51:18] with Zig Ziglar and come out and and now
[1:51:21] you've got a new attitude on life
[1:51:25] no something changed you
[1:51:28] something came in you
[1:51:34] God did something in your heart
[1:51:38] and there's a and
[1:51:42] we'll bring this we'll just talk on this
[1:51:45] so it is it's it's a comfort
[1:51:50] that's what he is he's a comforter
[1:51:53] you're you're at rest
[1:52:00] you understand you've put the question
[1:52:04] of where you're going
[1:52:06] behind you
[1:52:08] you you it so you you've entered into
[1:52:13] the rest because you know he's with you
[1:52:18] and you talk to someone that's that they
[1:52:20] they know they've got that peace
[1:52:24] that that Blessed assurance
[1:52:27] that comfort
[1:52:30] they they know that God's done something
[1:52:33] for him
[1:52:34] okay and there there no they know
[1:52:38] they're Heaven bound because they know
[1:52:40] that he redeemed them and they've
[1:52:42] entered into that rest and and they know
[1:52:45] he's with you and you he you know he
[1:52:48] promised I'll never leave you nor nor
[1:52:50] forsake you okay and that if he started
[1:52:54] the work in you he'll finish it
[1:53:00] you could say I'm not perfect Lord
[1:53:03] I'm growing
[1:53:05] but I know you're with me
[1:53:10] I have the comfort you won't forsake me
[1:53:12] that's the Holy Spirit
[1:53:16] that's the spirit of God that's doing
[1:53:18] that
[1:53:20] that's his presence
[1:53:22] because that's giving you that comfort
[1:53:25] that's giving you that assurance
[1:53:31] why people get well they'll they'll get
[1:53:33] like signing one to come in and buy the
[1:53:36] gifts
[1:53:38] I want this power
[1:53:42] how can I get it here how about
[1:53:45] a few G's
[1:53:53] okay
[1:53:55] that's what he Peter told me he said you
[1:53:57] need to repent
[1:54:00] what did he do he put him right back
[1:54:02] into the process
[1:54:04] you need to come out from all that
[1:54:06] thinking you need to come out from all
[1:54:08] that you need to repent you need to get
[1:54:10] your heart right you need to separate
[1:54:12] from the things of the world if you do
[1:54:14] those things you will receive the holy
[1:54:17] spirit because it's a covenant promise
[1:54:21] [Music]
[1:54:25] but God gives you a peace that's her
[1:54:28] path's understanding and all of a sudden
[1:54:30] that's not the spirit of God
[1:54:36] he gives you a a seal
[1:54:40] that you know you're Heaven bound you
[1:54:42] know where you're going praise God I'm
[1:54:46] on my way to Glory the storms don't

[1:55:20] because the seal the believer knows I've
[1:55:23] been sealed in my heart
[1:55:26] that I'm I'm going to Glory
[1:55:29] I've been purchased with the price a guy
[1:55:31] said on the the rail I'm going
[1:55:37] you say what ends if the car Falls over
[1:55:40] you know what happens if the car Falls
[1:55:41] over he writes it back up

[1:55:48] because nothing can break that seal

[1:58:15] just to confess your sins that he'd be
[1:58:18] faithful and just to forgive them
[1:58:21] and that he would wipe away all your
[1:58:24] iniquities

[2:05:23] night's subject but what did he do it
[2:05:25] for
[2:05:26] what did the Holy Spirit what did he
[2:05:31] come for
[2:05:33] what did he come in you for
[2:05:37] what did he come in me for was to
[2:05:41] continue the works of God
[2:05:47] amen so when when the father
[2:05:51] sent Jesus right what did he do
[2:05:55] he put his spirit in him
[2:06:01] and then Jesus said I don't do nothing
[2:06:03] till the father shows me I only speak
[2:06:06] those things with the father tells me to
[2:06:09] speak
[2:06:10] why because God was sending him so he
[2:06:13] put his spirit in him
[2:06:17] if if you're if you you if you don't
[2:06:21] want what it is then you don't know
[2:06:24] whether you've got it or not there's a
[2:06:27] lot of people that have the spirit but
[2:06:30] somebody's convinced them that is some
[2:06:32] sort of manifestation of gifts and
[2:06:36] speaking and all those things that they
[2:06:38] take all the peace all the joy all the
[2:06:41] sign all the seal and everything and
[2:06:44] they just throw that aside they're not
[2:06:46] happy with it because they're chasing
[2:06:49] after a carrot yeah
[2:06:51] amen
[2:06:56] it is simply his word
[2:07:01] in your heart
[2:07:04] so when he sent Jesus he put his spirit
[2:07:06] in him when Jesus sent
[2:07:09] you

[2:07:21] me no more but you see me because I'm
[2:07:24] with you

[2:07:44] will come and be with you even in you
[2:07:49] till the end sign seal Assurance
[2:07:53] protection
[2:07:58] the holy spirit is his spirit
[2:08:00] in you
[2:08:02] because he said let this Spirit be in
[2:08:06] you that was in Christ what for to let
[2:08:09] every man look upon the needs of others
[2:08:12] to continue his work
[2:08:17] what was he
[2:08:20] huh
[2:08:21] he was he was a mighty conqueror
[2:08:27] now just think that's what the spirit's
[2:08:29] for
[2:08:31] it's not to speak of itself
[2:08:34] but to bring you into remembrance of all
[2:08:37] things that I've said and I've done
[2:08:41] is to bring you to remember it's him
[2:08:44] reminding you of himself
[2:08:47] you remember you remember the little
[2:08:49] blind boy
[2:08:52] that was born blind
[2:08:55] remember when I went and I put this
[2:08:58] fiddle and I made some milk and told him
[2:09:01] to go wash
[2:09:02] do you remember that that was me
[2:09:05] I conquered that blindness
[2:09:08] and remember all the scribes and all the
[2:09:10] Pharisees they came up and they said Oh
[2:09:13] by what power you do this well by why do
[2:09:16] you do this
[2:09:18] remember he said oh you guys do men of
[2:09:20] Israel
[2:09:21] you teachers of the law
[2:09:24] okay and you don't know by what power
[2:09:26] this is done in other words you can't
[2:09:29] discern between good and evil you don't

[2:11:11] enough

[2:11:29] the grave
[2:11:30] he knew what he was he knew what it was
[2:11:33] that God gave him and what God put in
[2:11:36] him

[2:12:09] down the street no he did every work he
[2:12:12] did in the midst of unbelief but he was
[2:12:15] a conqueror
[2:12:19] conquered it

[2:18:29] things
[2:18:31] what is it
[2:18:34] it's the mighty conqueror
[2:18:37] it's the one who conquered hell death in
[2:18:39] the grave that was his Spirit when he
[2:18:43] came he came back to redeem Adam's
[2:18:46] Fallen race he came back to redeem every
[2:18:49] single one of us that was born in sin
[2:18:51] shaped in iniquity who had the spirit in
[2:18:55] US of our first husband which was our
[2:18:57] birth through sex by Adam
[2:19:01] and he come to take that Stony heart out
[2:19:04] of us and replace it with a heart of
[2:19:07] Flesh
[2:19:09] he come to change that nature that we
[2:19:12] had and replace it with his nature
[2:19:19] he said
[2:19:20] if you can do all signs and wonders and
[2:19:23] speak with tongues and have all the
[2:19:26] gifts and you have not loved
[2:19:30] it profiteth you nothing
[2:19:36] you say can people do all these things
[2:19:38] and and have these gifts and signs and
[2:19:41] do all these things and not have him in
[2:19:43] his heart yes
[2:19:46] because the rain falls on the just in
[2:19:48] the end yet
[2:19:51] I'm not worried about
[2:19:54] the unjust
[2:19:58] I just want my heart right
[2:20:00] I want him in my heart
[2:20:03] I want the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:20:06] which is the spirit of Jesus Christ
[2:20:09] coming into my life
[2:20:12] the prophet of God said the mystery of
[2:20:15] this age was receiving the baptism of
[2:20:18] the Holy Spirit without sensation
[2:20:23] how do you know you've got it because
[2:20:26] you know what action it brings
[2:20:29] you know if you're turning the other
[2:20:31] Chief do you know if you believe the
[2:20:33] word of God you know if there's
[2:20:35] forgiveness in your heart you know if
[2:20:38] there's compassion and competing you
[2:20:40] know if you're the Good Samaritan or the
[2:20:43] Scribe or the Pharisee that drives by
[2:20:45] you know that by the love of God that
[2:20:48] shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy
[2:20:50] Spirit what was Jesus he was the love of
[2:20:53] God
[2:20:54] God so loved the world he gave his only
[2:20:57] begotten son whoever believeth him he
[2:21:01] shall give them power to become the Sons
[2:21:03] and Daughters of God hallelujah
[2:21:08] think of it it's him and you
[2:21:12] believing his word
[2:21:19] that's what got lost
[2:21:24] that's what he told them
[2:21:26] he says go wait in the upper room
[2:21:29] in Terry
[2:21:32] until you're endued with power from on
[2:21:34] high
[2:21:37] well when they came out of there
[2:21:39] that day they began to preach
[2:21:43] what do they preach they preach Jesus
[2:21:46] Christ o men and Brethren this same
[2:21:48] Jesus
[2:21:51] whom we call Lord and Savior you did
[2:21:53] crucify
[2:21:55] you hung them but this was The Lord Of
[2:21:57] Glory
[2:21:59] and they were pricked in their heart
[2:22:01] and they said what must we do they said
[2:22:04] repent
[2:22:06] we baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:22:08] Jesus and you shall receive his Spirit
[2:22:11] In You the gift of the Holy Spirit
[2:22:15] Christ in you
[2:22:19] when he found those guys they didn't
[2:22:20] even know whether there was such Holy
[2:22:22] Spirit he said how are you baptized we
[2:22:25] are baptized under repentance
[2:22:27] so they were doing the works under the
[2:22:30] spirit of repentance
[2:22:32] and Paul brought him and brought him
[2:22:34] into the liberty of the spirit where
[2:22:37] we're set free
[2:22:39] how why are you set free because you
[2:22:41] know he's with you
[2:22:45] you know I think sometimes we've just
[2:22:48] like the lamb and the dove he's been
[2:22:51] with us but we just kind of been getting
[2:22:54] loose and getting away and he's just got
[2:22:57] to wait
[2:22:58] he's got to step back he can't go with
[2:23:00] you there
[2:23:01] but he'll start getting that word
[2:23:03] working he'll start sending those hound
[2:23:06] dogs to Hell after you he'll start
[2:23:08] creating that desperation it won't be
[2:23:11] long
[2:23:12] you'll be right back crying for Him
[2:23:14] Father come back to me restore me I got
[2:23:19] away from you I'm not letting you live
[2:23:21] in my heart the way that I ought to let
[2:23:23] you live in your heart okay I've grieved
[2:23:26] the Holy Spirit
[2:23:28] come back lord I want to be in
[2:23:29] fellowship with you
[2:23:31] forgive me
[2:23:33] forgive me
[2:23:35] you know what he said in no wise will he
[2:23:37] turn you away
[2:23:39] he'll be faithful and just behold I
[2:23:42] stand at the door and knock
[2:23:48] why look
[2:23:50] someplace else for him when he's right
[2:23:53] here
[2:23:56] what happened to the church
[2:24:02] it
[2:24:03] it got away from him
[2:24:07] it just it just it got a it it just got
[2:24:12] so far away to where they they no longer
[2:24:18] they wanted the knowledge
[2:24:20] but they didn't want the life
[2:24:24] they wanted
[2:24:25] to know about him
[2:24:27] and talk about him but they didn't want
[2:24:31] him
[2:24:32] so what did they do they put him on the
[2:24:34] outside of the church and he's knocking
[2:24:38] to get in
[2:24:40] and he said If any man will open the
[2:24:42] door I will come into him and I will sup
[2:24:46] with him I will feed him the evening
[2:24:49] meal
[2:24:51] I'll commune with him
[2:24:53] I'll make things right
[2:24:56] I'll straighten out your life I'll
[2:24:58] deliver you from the problems you've got
[2:25:00] in I'm an advocate

[2:25:14] to be with you even in you
[2:25:17] I mean I'd like to just close when
[2:25:19] reading these statements the church got
[2:25:21] away from it so till all the tables
[2:25:24] we're filled with vomit
[2:25:28] you couldn't find the Life of Christ
[2:25:30] anywhere
[2:25:33] the ministry had turned in no longer
[2:25:35] being servants but lording over God's
[2:25:38] Heritage the Nickelodeon Spirit was
[2:25:41] raging everything was about bigger this
[2:25:44] bigger that money this money that man
[2:25:47] teaching for Doctrine
[2:25:49] the Commandments of men
[2:25:52] they got away from the word
[2:25:55] but there was a promise to God's seed
[2:25:59] I will restore saith the Lord all that
[2:26:03] the Palmer on the canker worm the
[2:26:06] caterpillar butterfly and I'll restore
[2:26:08] everything that was lost
[2:26:11] but first the seed has got to go back
[2:26:14] into the ground
[2:26:17] and when it goes back in the ground
[2:26:19] it'll start coming up again
[2:26:22] so I'm going to read these thought last
[2:26:24] thoughts to you this morning
[2:26:28] he said
[2:26:35] little babies say well I go to the
[2:26:37] church my mama belonged to this church
[2:26:42] I have nothing against that dear brother
[2:26:44] and I realize this is being taped that's
[2:26:49] all right belonging to Mama's church but
[2:26:51] listen Mama walked in one light
[2:26:55] you're walking in another
[2:27:03] Luther walked in one light
[2:27:06] Wesley walked in another
[2:27:09] Wesley walked in one light
[2:27:12] Pentecost walked in another
[2:27:14] but were walking on higher than that
[2:27:19] today
[2:27:21] and if there's another generation it'll
[2:27:24] go beyond us
[2:27:27] who is that other generation
[2:27:32] you are
[2:27:36] then come along
[2:27:39] he said back in the early days
[2:27:43] when things were wide
[2:27:46] way wide Luther taught justification by
[2:27:50] faith that was just to bring the people
[2:27:54] from Catholicism to protestantism so he
[2:27:58] said in the beginning it was real wide
[2:28:01] justification was a real wide sweep
[2:28:05] it was a real white sweep he said
[2:28:10] and he says into the fellowship around
[2:28:13] the word
[2:28:14] justification by faith that was a big
[2:28:18] wide sphere and they never moved from
[2:28:21] that
[2:28:23] and Along come another revile Revival
[2:28:27] called John Wesley
[2:28:29] it shook them down from that and brought
[2:28:33] her down to sanctification live good
[2:28:36] clean holy lives Sanctified by the word
[2:28:39] of God
[2:28:40] give joy in your heart that shook off a
[2:28:45] lot of the Lutheran Doctrine
[2:28:47] then Along Came Pentecost with baptism
[2:28:51] of the Holy Ghost
[2:28:53] and narrowed it down again by receiving
[2:28:57] the Holy Ghost that's right and now
[2:29:00] that's been shaken down
[2:29:03] and the gifts and the restoration and
[2:29:07] the spirit of God has come in in the
[2:29:10] fullness of signs and wonders into the
[2:29:13] church and has shook Pentecost what is
[2:29:17] it we're so close to the coming of the
[2:29:20] Lord Jesus until the very spirit that
[2:29:24] was in him is working in the church
[2:29:28] doing the same things that he did what
[2:29:32] is the holy spirit it's the same spirit
[2:29:35] that was in him for what that the church
[2:29:38] can continue the works who
[2:29:42] who is the church somebody ought to
[2:29:45] stand up and say I am
[2:29:48] I'm the church I'm going to do the works
[2:29:53] it's in me
[2:29:55] if the same spirit that was it was in
[2:29:59] Christ dwell within me it's going to
[2:30:01] Quicken my mortal body he didn't say he
[2:30:03] was going to Quicken the church
[2:30:05] he said he would Quicken you make it
[2:30:09] personal
[2:30:12] make it personal you know if you have
[2:30:15] the spirit of the Lord
[2:30:18] he said
[2:30:23] and when he was here on Earth he never
[2:30:27] been anywhere back from the time of the
[2:30:31] Apostles till this time why
[2:30:34] see it's wide Narrows Narrows Narrows
[2:30:39] what is it just like your hand coming to
[2:30:42] a shadow the negative the negative the
[2:30:45] negative well what is it it's a
[2:30:47] reflection what was Luther a reflection
[2:30:50] of Christ what was Wesley a reflection
[2:30:54] a reflection of Christ
[2:30:57] he says now the holy spirit of God has
[2:31:01] worked under justification
[2:31:04] Luther
[2:31:05] under sanctification Wesley
[2:31:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost under
[2:31:10] Pentecost
[2:31:12] and here it is in the last day
[2:31:15] performing and doing the very same thing
[2:31:19] that it did when it was in
[2:31:24] Christ
[2:31:25] what is it the church and Christ has
[2:31:29] become one
[2:31:31] and as soon as they connect together
[2:31:36] the last link
[2:31:38] shall grow through the sky shouting
[2:31:41] up will come Wesley Luther and the rest
[2:31:44] of them back there in their days
[2:31:48] he'll that's first will be last and the
[2:31:52] last will be first and there will come
[2:31:55] the resurrection what
[2:31:58] we're at the time listen
[2:32:02] that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy
[2:32:06] Ghost by justification just a light
[2:32:09] shadow of it the Holy Ghost by
[2:32:11] sanctification a deeper shadow of it the
[2:32:15] Holy Ghost by the baptism of it a deeper
[2:32:18] shadow of it but now the Holy Ghost by
[2:32:22] the restoration of its very person being
[2:32:27] in here
[2:32:28] forming and sign in wonders like he did
[2:32:32] at the beginning
[2:32:34] Glory you can call me a Holy Roller
[2:32:38] anyhow you might as well get started now
[2:32:43] Hallelujah
[2:32:46] we're not going backwards
[2:32:49] those are just Shadows
[2:32:52] with shadows
[2:32:54] just think everything that Pentecost was
[2:32:58] it was annoying if it was a restoration
[2:33:00] of gifts
[2:33:02] but this is Christ in you
[2:33:06] this is the invisible Union
[2:33:10] of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[2:33:13] Earthly bride this is the age where the
[2:33:16] where where the church
[2:33:18] the Bride In Christ become one
[2:33:22] they become the same thing
[2:33:26] that's what the holy spirit is
[2:33:29] it's him
[2:33:31] in you
[2:33:33] continuing the works the church got away
[2:33:36] from that it went into the ground but
[2:33:39] you hear what he said by restoration
[2:33:43] he sent the ministry of restoration
[2:33:47] not to bring us to a lesser light
[2:33:50] or a light of an age come by
[2:33:54] but to mature us
[2:33:56] by sitting in the ripening of the Sun by
[2:33:59] setting under the word of God to bring
[2:34:02] us to where that very Spirit of Christ
[2:34:04] is in US herein is the love of God made
[2:34:07] perfect
[2:34:09] that as he is so are we in this world
[2:34:14] the Capstone
[2:34:16] how is the Capstone made perfect because
[2:34:20] as he was so are we in this world
[2:34:26] what is the Holy Spirit
[2:34:30] it's the spirit of Jesus Christ
[2:34:34] in you
[2:34:36] continuing the works that he did making
[2:34:40] you a mighty conqueror
[2:34:44] the question is
[2:34:46] do you believe he can do that in you
[2:34:56] as I was listening brother Ben was
[2:34:58] telling the story
[2:35:00] when he got married he'd been his wife
[2:35:02] had died five years and
[2:35:04] sister meaty
[2:35:07] the Lord dealt with her heart and the
[2:35:09] Lord dealt with brother Bam's heart and
[2:35:11] they became married
[2:35:13] and they were up on a uh
[2:35:17] that the honeymoon
[2:35:21] trip we always called that a hunting
[2:35:23] Moon
[2:35:26] and you know the story how he got up
[2:35:28] hunting he thought he'd go get so they
[2:35:30] they'd set up a little lean to him by
[2:35:32] the cabin
[2:35:34] and the ranger is going to come up and
[2:35:36] open up the cabin and then they would
[2:35:39] spend the night in the cabin and then he
[2:35:41] would hunt and and uh so he thought he'd
[2:35:45] go out and get a little meat so they
[2:35:47] could have some venison to cook and Hunt
[2:35:49] called Camp meat and he got up there and
[2:35:52] he got lost
[2:35:54] and he said you know I thought I was a
[2:35:56] Woodsman
[2:35:57] he said my mama's happy Indian
[2:36:00] and and he said I love the woods and I
[2:36:02] love nature and I love being outside he
[2:36:05] said my conversion never took that from
[2:36:07] me
[2:36:10] and he said but I got lost
[2:36:14] I didn't think I could get lost
[2:36:17] oh I started out I know where I'm going
[2:36:20] he said he kept coming back to his deer
[2:36:22] and finally he just put it all together
[2:36:25] in his mind and he said I'm I'm going
[2:36:28] this way
[2:36:30] he said Alice marching straight for
[2:36:32] Canada
[2:36:34] he said I never made it
[2:36:38] he said but I felt a hand
[2:36:44] come on my shoulder
[2:36:46] and turn me around
[2:36:48] he said I stopped and thought what was
[2:36:50] it snow what it was he said I felt that
[2:36:52] hand turned me around he said I turned
[2:36:55] around and all of a sudden the clouds
[2:36:57] opened up and I saw that mountain I was
[2:37:00] going the opposite way
[2:37:04] and he said I just started that way as
[2:37:06] hard as I could
[2:37:09] he said I knew I ran a phone line
[2:37:12] from that Tower
[2:37:14] to my cabin
[2:37:16] and if I could just cut across there and
[2:37:18] get that phone line
[2:37:21] so he put his hand up
[2:37:23] and he walked with his hand up thanking
[2:37:25] the lord praising God I know that
[2:37:27] lifeline's there
[2:37:30] I know that Lifeline there I'm trying to
[2:37:32] tell you today there's a Lifeline for
[2:37:34] your life
[2:37:36] he's the mighty conqueror I don't care
[2:37:38] what you're bound by alcoholism
[2:37:41] cigarettes drugs
[2:37:44] spirits in the flesh depression or
[2:37:47] whatever it is there's a lifeline so
[2:37:50] that leads to life
[2:37:52] and he just put his hand up and kept
[2:37:55] going until he finally grabbed a hold of
[2:37:57] it
[2:37:58] and he knew once he grabbed that line
[2:38:03] he had the Assurance he was going to
[2:38:05] take him there
[2:38:07] it was a sign
[2:38:09] that he was on the right way
[2:38:12] it was a seal that he knew were the end
[2:38:15] of the journey was going to take him
[2:38:18] it was an assurance to him
[2:38:21] that he was no longer lost
[2:38:23] he knew where he was
[2:38:26] it was a protection as long as he held
[2:38:30] on to it he would not go astray
[2:38:34] it was his Advocate it made all the
[2:38:38] wrongs and wrong turns he did right
[2:38:42] it made everything they failed in every
[2:38:45] false Trail he took it was already now
[2:38:48] because he had a hold of the lifeline
[2:38:53] to what is the Holy Spirit
[2:38:55] it's our lifeline
[2:38:58] it's our life
[2:39:01] It's Our Hope
[2:39:03] it is everything that we need because
[2:39:06] it's him
[2:39:09] I will come again and I will be with you
[2:39:12] and I will be in you till the end and he
[2:39:18] held on to that line
[2:39:20] but now that line holds on to us
[2:39:23] nothing will pluck you from the palm of
[2:39:26] our hand
[2:39:29] we just need to turn our hearts back
[2:39:32] to him
[2:39:35] letting him
[2:39:38] Unite with us
[2:39:41] until we know it's him in US
[2:39:44] Jesus says it's not I that does the work
[2:39:48] it's the father
[2:39:49] that does the works in me
[2:39:52] you're not going to say this day it's
[2:39:54] not by our power
[2:39:56] and not by our might
[2:39:58] but it's by his spirit in US that we can
[2:40:03] do all things through Christ Jesus who
[2:40:06] strengthens us
[2:40:11] it's him
[2:40:14] he's the only hope of glory
[2:40:17] what is the holy spirit it's the same
[2:40:20] spirit
[2:40:22] that was in Jesus Christ
[2:40:26] giving him the power to do the works
[2:40:30] that same Spirit comes back onto the
[2:40:33] believer
[2:40:34] and dwells in you
[2:40:36] and if that Spirit dwells in you as it
[2:40:39] quickened his mortal body so will it
[2:40:43] also Quicken your mortal bodies you're
[2:40:47] the conquerors today
[2:40:49] it's him in you on the Earth today doing
[2:40:55] the same works that he did through you

[2:41:03] with the same power that raised him from
[2:41:06] the dead living in you aren't you glad
[2:41:10] for that

[2:44:09] Lord there's so much question

[2:44:22] in low East here and
[2:44:25] he's moving over here and he's moving
[2:44:28] over there
[2:44:29] [Music]

[2:46:53] but she said he's the only one that can
[2:46:56] help me
[2:46:58] [Music]
[2:47:00] so she went
[2:47:02] and was mocked and scoffed
[2:47:05] and Jesus said Simon
[2:47:08] you didn't even wash my feet
[2:47:12] but she hasn't stopped washing my feet
[2:47:14] with her tears and wiping them with her
[2:47:17] hair
