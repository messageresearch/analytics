Description:
Wednesday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 21st, 2026
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Somehow throughout [music] the the week while studying, I fell upon uh this story and it it touched my heart. I want to share it to you. The man's name is uh Joseph Metalcott [music] Scriven and he was born in Dublin, Ireland. And uh while he was attending college, he met his what he would call his sweetheart. And uh before they got married, [music] she fell off her horse and drowned and she passed away. And it hurt him so much that he moved and went to Canada [music] and lived his life as a poor man helping others that were in need. [music] And his heart was never truly healed. But he had met somebody and the night before their wedding she passed away as [music] well. And so just so much on his heart not fully have [music] healed from the first passing. Then he got a letter finding out that his mother back in Dublin was sick and he wrote her cuz he couldn't go see her. He wrote her a poem and the poem is [music] as we know it the song What a Friend We Have in Jesus. You may not be able to enter in [music] in the exact same pain that he had, but if he can look at the pain he went through and still [music] say, "I've got a friend in Jesus." How much more us with what we go through. And what a friend we have in Jesus and [singing and music] all our sins and griefs to bear. And what a privilege [singing] to [music] car bring [singing] everything [music] to God in prayer. And oh what [music] peace we often fall on [singing] faith. And all [music] what needless [singing] pain we bear. And all because [singing] we do not [music] care. Bring all everything to [singing] God in prayer. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; In hell we trials and temptations [singing] [music] is their [singing] tray and [singing] we should never be discouraged. [music] [singing] Oh take it to the Lord and pray. [singing] Oh, [music] I [singing] find a friend so faithful. Oh, [music] will [singing] all my sorrow sh [music] [singing] weakness. [music] Get to the Lord in prayer. And all we we [singing] [music] come [singing] burn with load of [music] care. Oh, and pray should save your [singing] steal [music] my ref. Oh, [singing] take it [music] to the Lord in prayer. [singing] Oh, and you thy friends despise, [music] forsake me. Oh, [singing] take it to [music] the Lord and pray. Oh, when in his [singing] arms he can shield [music] me. Oh, and thou will find a soul [music] this day. Sing that verse again. Oh, [singing] and on we [music] we [music] [singing] burn with the Lord of King. [music] Oh preious Savior, steal my reduction. [music] Take it to [singing] the Lord and pray. Oh, [music] and do thy friends despise, [singing] forsake thee. Oh, and take [music] it to [singing] the Lord in praise and [singing and music] is all you'll take and shield me. will [music] find a soul this day. And what a friend we [singing] have in Jesus. Take it to the [singing] Lord in praise. [applause] [music] Amen. How many know they have that privilege? Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's no friends like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just a couple announcements to make at this time. Um the uh forecast for the weather for this weekend, I don't know uh if you've looked at it, it it doesn't look really good.

Exalt [music and singing] his name forever. [music] Glorify [singing] the Lord with me. [music] Oh, come exalt his name forever. &gt;&gt; Let's just go before him. Heavenly Father, [music] we truly desire to exalt you, Lord, and Lord, to have hearts that come together into one mind and one accord. And lift up your praise, Father, for the good things that you've [music] done. And Lord, how you've preserved us and how you've kept us and how you've allowed us to come into your house once again. And Lord, we just ask as we sung these praises [music] that they're sweet to you, Father. And Lord, that you're pleased to come now. And just [music] take your word, Father, and break it to us. We know that in your word, Father, there's life. There's healing. And Lord, it's in your word that we know your very heart and mind, [music] Father. We ask that you would break your word to us now. commit ourselves to you, asking that you'd be glorified in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. [music] We pray. Amen. While you're standing, if you'd turn in your Bibles with me, we're going to be taking the text out of Matthew chapter 15. And trust we won't uh be too long. We know probably the the longer we're in here, the colder it's going to get out there. But I I uh felt a little convicted last time. I didn't read some quotes. And really the uh you know that was on me cuz later on I'm like well everybody stayed in the parking lot for an hour and fellowshipped and and I could have taken the time to to read the the quotes and the sources. So you just pray the Lord has his way. You know we we can't come with a premeditated mind and if we're just leaving it to man it's you know if God's not in it it's it's nothing. But we just ask that he would come and he would minister to the needs that we have. Out of Matthew chapter 15, reading uh from verse one, then came Jesus to the scribes and the Pharisees which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandments of God by your tradition? For God commanded, saying, "Honor thy father and mother, and he that cursseth father or mother, let him die the death." But ye say, "Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me, and honorth not his father or mother, he [snorts] shall be free." So he's he's reciting back to the Pharisees and the Sadducees a a law or proclamation that they've made of the commandments of God. And he goes, "And you know, now that I'm a son, I owe nothing to my parents because everything that you've done unto me, you've done unto God. So consider it. We're even. And I don't need to do nothing for you. I don't need to come mow your lawn. I don't need to do We're good. We're I know you took care of me, but uh what you did for me, you did did unto God. So just consider it that way and we're we're good. and honorth not father or mother, he shall be free. Thus ye have or thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites. Well did Isaiah's prophesy of you, saying, "This people draw nigh unto me with their mouth, and honorth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. And he called the multitude, and said unto the him, unto them, "Hear and understand. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileleth man." Then said his disciples unto him, "Knowest thou not that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this, saying?" Like, do you know what you're doing here? You're making those guys mad. But he answered and said,"Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone. They will be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch." Then answered Peter and said unto him, "Declare under this unto us this parable." Jesus said, "Ye also yet without understanding, do you not understand that whatsoever enterth into the mouth goeth out of the belly, and is cast out into the drought? But those things which proceedth out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceedth evil thoughts, murderers, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnesses, blasphemies. These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man. Heavenly Father, I just ask in your word, Lord, that we would see how our hearts, Father, are the critical matter, Lord, and just break your word to us as we commit it to you. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. You could be seated. The thought I would like to take with you and we'll just fellowship on is the character of the heart. So when we talk about the character of something, it's the characteristics. It's the nature and it's it's by which you know something. It's it's its characteristics. You know, if it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck, walks like a duck, it might be a horse, right? It's a duck, right? So by its characteristics you know something and this is a this is very fundamental this is elementary everybody here from the youngest to the oldest should be able to understand the if it's character declares something that's it's it's telling you what it is right so Jesus says look every tree that my father hasn't planted it's going to be burned &gt;&gt; all right so we can know that with an assurity if it's not of God if it's not planted of God. If it's not from God, its end is to be burned. And we say, "Praise the Lord." Because we don't want anything that's left over of man. We don't want anything that I'm so glad that all the things of man has an assure ending and that's to be burned. So I we rejoice in this, but there's an understanding that we want to have that the heart becomes a very critical thing. Right? Because it's from the heart that the issues of life happen. It's from the heart. Jesus is is saying, "Look, you're looking at the hands and the behavior, but you're you're you're not even understanding the condition of the heart and my prayer." And and just even as I'm this word, it's convicting to me. I have to know my heart's condition. &gt;&gt; I have to be very aware of the characteristics and the nature that my heart is declaring. And it's it's not hid, right? I my heart declares itself in my behavior, the things I do, the things I put my affections on, the way I spend my time. And if I if I don't take heed to myself, then I become a Pharisee and a Sadducee where I've whitened the walls. I've given myself this image of religion. I profess with my mouth that I care for the things of God. And on the very inside, my heart is not knit with his. &gt;&gt; And I and I would challenge us as we look at we look at the character of the heart. My question would be, is your heart's condition mirroring the heart of Christ? And that's just the the way the Lord was convicting me. But we're going to step through this. A lot of what we were just the Lord led was just through the different services. our f our pastor talking about uh character and the way back and and you know the the uh the amnesia and our brother Cosman. It was just a wonderful time in the Lord and the the Lord just continued to feed us. We're going to take some some uh quotes out of believing from the heart. Brother Brandham would say uh I've noticed the these things. I noticed them. I come to the conclusion, no matter what you are, God has to furnish the audience, no matter if it if I could stand this morning and bring the dead to life and bring the cripples to the normal condition. And yet, if God is not in the program, it would be in vain, &gt;&gt; right? So, I I want to tell you the good news is that we're not dependent on on my ability or even the things that I would do. What really comes down to it is is we want to recognize whether or not God's in it, right? And if if if God's in it, then I want allin. &gt;&gt; I if God's a part if the program is God's program, then I want to be passionate about it. I want to be dedicated to it. I want to understand what the mind and the will of God is. And I want all &gt;&gt; I don't want to be the one who's sitting back going, "Could this be? I don't know enough. I have no spiritual discernment enough to know. I don't know my Bible enough to know. I don't even know why I'm here. I don't even understand if this is God's program. I'm halted between two opinions. As brother Matthew said the other night, it's just not my style. So, I can't discern if it's God or not because it hasn't petted my flesh the way I like it. I have no understanding of whether or not it's the word of God or not. But we know if it the reward of this day is to know the very mind and heart of God. When you've received this message of this day, you've been given access to the very heart and mind of Jesus Christ. That is what you have the ability to know. You have no excuse to not know and understand that God desired for you to be here tonight. &gt;&gt; You you pleased the very heart of God by not forsaking to bring yourselves together and assemble yourselves and and to be mindful of the needs and the burdens of the others and say, "You know what? I'm going to go show whose side I'm on. I'm going to bring my lick of fire. I'm going to come to the house of the Lord and I'm going to be believing for the my brothers and sisters, Lord, that you could come and in your word and you could do something. That's the mind of God. &gt;&gt; That's the heart of God to you. &gt;&gt; We're going to try to move along. [clears throat] Man is known by his characteristics. If you take a man, no matter how good he tries to be, if his works are evil, all the goodness won't amount to nothing. So there's a we're talking about the heart condition. And if a man's word is his character, a man has the word is a man, his word is no good, then you'll never have confidence in that man because his word is no good. &gt;&gt; So now we're talking about character, right? So therefore, God our father, his character and his works prove what he is. Now we know that the world come here by some great creator. It could not have just happened to be. Now I want to just a few moments to just as simple as possible, but I want you to get in praying that the Holy Spirit would move it right into the light that it belongs in. Now, if you would just look and see the trees growing and the limbs and the leaves, how they come and go, the flowers in the spring and the fall and the winter and the summer, something has got to be behind it. There could not be a tree unless there could be an intelligence to make a tree. No matter what kind of life it would be, there has to be behind that an intelligence makes it what it is. Now, he's he's touching on something. The intelligence behind it makes it what it is. It's very simple, but the tree wouldn't be doing anything unless there was a life in it. &gt;&gt; Right? So, ye are the vine. I'm the vine. You're the branches. There's a there's going to be a a a concept here we want to understand. Now, think that straight now. Don't let it go over. Think of it deep. For if you notice our scripture lesson, Jesus said, "If you will say, if you say in your heart," so brother Brandon had taken a text. He took a text from uh Mark 16:14 after he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at me and araided them with their unbelief and hardness of their heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he had risen. So, Brother Brandham's takes two scriptures. He takes the one where he's araiding the 11. Now these are disciples but look at the heart condition that they had the heart he he he has he has now indicted them for the hardness of their heart. I don't think any of us would go ahead and say in our own esteem in our own I you know none of us have paid the price of the apostles we haven't done anything unto death because I still see you. Okay. But he's telling them that the ones that were with Jesus, he's now telling them, "Your heart condition didn't allow you to receive the testimony of others that had witnessed me." It was a heart condition. So, there's a there was a a hardness of their heart. The good news is is he also took Mark 11:23. He said,"For verily I say unto you, that whatsoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart," that's Mark 11:23, "He shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, and he shall have whatsoever he saith." &gt;&gt; So now, what's important? &gt;&gt; The heart. and and it just the title of the sermon, man, it just hits me. Believe from the heart. You know, a lot of us think we believe and we think and it's the, you know, it's the head. But he he's saying if you doubt in your heart &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham takes that the other way and he says if you believe in your heart &gt;&gt; you know Jesus said if you don't doubt &gt;&gt; but you believe you can in in your heart but now recognize that your belief your heart what it does is going to result in really what fountain what fruit what tree what life &gt;&gt; is in the tree &gt;&gt; because the tree has to have an intelligence behind it. &gt;&gt; You are bearing a fruit. &gt;&gt; Your life, your characteristics, what is coming to manifestation is because of your heart. Now, we're going to take a deep exam. He said, "Stop. Dig deep. Don't let that go over your head." So, we're going to look at, you know, the heart is a muscle. It has chambers. It pulsates and all of you can live without it. All right, we got you paying attention. You can't live without your heart. And and just to make this relatable really u could you imagine two friends who didn't have anything in common that their hearts didn't even have the same interest. It just that it would be like a body without a heart. there would be no life be in that friendship. Right? So what what you have to understand is uh when we're talking about these issues of life there we we relate to them in material things but there's a real spiritual aspect to it. It's the life flow, right? The heart is the life flow. What's keeping you going? &gt;&gt; What's your source of strength? &gt;&gt; And that's what makes things strong. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, Jeremiah 17:9, we're going to go through some scriptures. We're going to try to uh I don't think we'll be long. Jeremiah 17:9, the heart is a deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Who can know it? &gt;&gt; So, ouch. &gt;&gt; So, David, you're telling me that you just said the heart's very important. I need the heart. Without the heart, I die. And now you're telling me it's deceitful. It's desperately wicked. And who can know it? Yes. That is your born condition. &gt;&gt; This is your born condition. You can't you can't appease this. &gt;&gt; You can't make this white. You can't cover it up. I It You will find until you're born again, things just happen that come from this guy right here. And it has no good fruit. It's selfish. &gt;&gt; It's you're you're indicted. &gt;&gt; You you that brother Brandham says it in one one place and a brother shared it while he was here. Uh but your righteousness is filthy. &gt;&gt; So the best that you can do is coming from this place. Proverbs 2:12, every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the Lord ponderth the hearts. So even your own understanding, your thinking of your heart would be that you're right. But God's judging that. &gt;&gt; First Corinthians 11:28, "But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup." &gt;&gt; I mean, are you making sure your hands are clean? Are you or was it like, "I'm going to take a piece of bread off the plate and I just need to make sure my hands are clean." That's not the examination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. But for this cause many are sick and weakly among you, not discerning the Lord's body. What are we to discern? What are we to take an account of? What are we supposed to examine? We want to be looking at our heart. Isaiah 29:13, "Wherefore the Lord said,"For as much as the people draw near me with their mouths, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of man." I mean, what a what a condition. Now, we love the Lord, Jehovah, deliverer, brought us out of Egypt. what mighty things he's done. And now their hearts are so far from them that yet while their mouths are giving accolades and they're going through this form of worship, they really don't care for the things that God cares about. It's written all over their face. It's written all over by the things that they do. They don't have the nature and the love of Christ in their life. They are not showing forth who God is. But they sure got a mouth service. But their their hearts had wandered. Jesus would say, "Ye hypocrites. Well did Isaiah's prophesy of you, saying, these people draweth none to me with their mouth, and honorth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me, but in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." So this is a longunning condition. Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you clean the outside of the cup of the platter, and with and within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou bind fer blind Pharisees. Cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter, that the outside of them may be clean. Also, woe unto you Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye like unto the whited separators, and indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but are within full of dead men's bones, and all uncleansliness. Even so, ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. So, the word now has come two-edged. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's two-edged. &gt;&gt; You could on the outside portray the righteousness, &gt;&gt; but if your heart is wrong, &gt;&gt; it was for nothing. &gt;&gt; But if your heart's right, you are going to show forth the righteousness. And we'll get into that. But you know, you can have a form of godliness, but deny the power of it. Right? Titus puts it this way. This is very good. I'm going to also take it out of the amplified. They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and to every good work reprobate. Would you like So, it's a broken and contrite spirit. Right? So, Titus 1:16, they pro it in amplified and I believe we have it. You can read it with me. They profess to know God, to recognize, perceive, and to be acquainted with him, but deny and disown and renounce him by what they do. It's the little tab that says AMPC. They profess to know God, to recognize, perceive, and to be acquainted with him, but deny and disown and renounce him by what they do. They are detestable and loathome, unbelieving and disobedient and disloyal and rebellious. And they are unfit and worthless for good work, deed or enterprise of any kind. Now they have a profession, &gt;&gt; right? I know the message. I know God sent a prophet, but they denounce him by what they do. So when the message says do and do not do and you don't do, then you're renouncing. I don't care what you say. When the message teaches something and you live contrary to it, then you by your deeds are renouncing by your deeds. Right? So we we it's not we're not left out of this. We're not a religion where we've now drawn an affiliation. We think if I profess him before man, I'm now per but he's looking at the very works that you have and your heart. So you you it's you have to have both. And in one place where brother Brandon would even say that he knew Balam's heart, right, wasn't the will of God. That he would he wanted his own desire over the word of God. So your I and this is the good news. The character of the heart of the believer is that their heart desires God's will over their own will. you the heritage that we have, the restoration that we've been given and and we're we're just holding back. We're not going to leave you here. We're we're going to get there. But you have the heart of Christ. &gt;&gt; You have the heart that says, "Not my will, but thine will be done." But you have to recognize that there is a transformation. There's a place where the heart deceives itself that thinks because it could take a form of godliness, that it could take a profession, that it can take a religious works, it can dress itself up, but inwardly it's ravenous. I if you think in your own way that you've attained something, &gt;&gt; it's religion. And even then, so if you can put on religion and you don't know the very mind and will of God, you've missed it. There's a place, now this is the good news. There's a place where a man can live so close to the presence of God. It's not by your choosing. Brother Brandham says it's not by your choosing. So, I want to live close, so close to the presence of God. And it's not by my choosing. &gt;&gt; It's by God's election &gt;&gt; that you live in that spot to where your own intellectuals have nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I I I have a peace now. The place that I'm living so close to him that the devil don't know to to do with me is because of his elective love and grace. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. This is the place we want to be where Mark 11:23, for verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, he shall believe those things that he saith shall come to pass. He shall have whatsoever he saith. Brother Brandham is talking about that place. He testifies to the fishy. He testifies of the things that God did. He says, "I had nothing to do with it." That was a channel &gt;&gt; where the very life of Christ now drops in and the very words that he's speaking is coming through a life source &gt;&gt; that is not him. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go through some things. I'm going to just establish a basis here because power apart from character is satanic, &gt;&gt; right? We're not just we're not just craving this. Hey, I see. Let me buy this from you. I see the devils are subject to you. I want to be able to speak the word, right? I want to be able to to have this power, but this is the gate that you have to enter in. If you love me, keep my commandments. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he is he that loveth me. And he that loveth me shall be loved by my father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. For this is the love of God that you keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievious. That's three scriptures. And this is love that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. &gt;&gt; If you keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love. Even as I have kept my father's commandments, abide in his love. That was John 14:15, 14:21, 1 John 5:3, 2 John 1:6, John 15:10, 1 John 4:20. It's a principle that's very well taught. If you love God, keep his commandments. And we all know we love from the mind. If a man say, "I love God and ha and hateth his brother." Now, this is that outward show, right? So now we're talking about the character. If a man saith he loved God and hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he hath not, for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen. &gt;&gt; How can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God loveth his brother also. Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints, if we can understand, we're with the love that God loved us. &gt;&gt; It's for God so loved the world. Now, he's saying your brother whom you've seen. &gt;&gt; Right? So, I I I have to share with you this. You are the image of God. &gt;&gt; If I look upon the what God created in his image and I hate it, I mean, that right there should kill racism probably, right? I mean, I hate that. That would even be a thing. But if you can hate something made in the image of God, then the love of God is not in you. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you say &gt;&gt; because we're made in his image. Why do you think Satan is such a perverter? &gt;&gt; Why do you think he attacks what a man is and what a woman is? And because it's declaring who God is, &gt;&gt; that's why he hates it. &gt;&gt; We man wasn't made to be that way. &gt;&gt; A woman wasn't made to be that way. &gt;&gt; And when we could recognize the image of God that we're made in, that's what causes the love of God to project. &gt;&gt; It's not Satan's image. He's a perverter. But what we love is when we can see through the eyes of Christ what God intended. Now just to kind of turn a corner a little bit we want to talk about the seed the fruit what is coming through that life. Brother Brandham even when he started he talked about the tree. So this is uh from the church ages. He says I know thy works. There are identical words uttered to each of the seven messengers relative to the people of God in each age. As they are spoken to the two vines, true and false, they will bring joy and gladness to the hearts of one group, but they ought to strike fear in the hearts of the other. For though we are saved by grace apart from works, true salvation will bring forth works or deeds that will please God. Now, this is the theme that's speaking to my heart is what pleases God, &gt;&gt; right? It's it's the works that please God. We want God in it. &gt;&gt; So, the the motivation here, the heart's desire, the really live stream of this is the pleasing of God. &gt;&gt; So, we're bringing forth now fruits, righteousness, even as he is righteous. If the verse means anything at all, it means that a man does, he is. As a man, what a man does, he is. James 3:11, "Do the fountain send forth as the same place, sweet water, and bitter?" Romans 6:2, "How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?" Matthew 12:33-35. Either make the tree good and his fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt. For the tree is known by his fruit. Oh generation of vipers, how ye being evil speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things. &gt;&gt; A good man out of the treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things. &gt;&gt; What is the character of your heart? Because a good man out of the treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things. &gt;&gt; We have been made to possess good things in earthn vessels. The very life of Christ &gt;&gt; in us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is what we have. It bringeth forth. Now if a man a good man out of the good treasures of his heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasures forth uh bringeth forth evil things. Now if a man is born of the word being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever. He will produce the word and therefore will be scriptural. Oh, what an indictment the truth is going to be against the perig per p per p per p per p per p per p per p per p per p per p perimeamian church age the that stand that matchless one in his hand the shape of a sword with the two edges the word of god and that word will judge us on the last day in fact the word is judging even now &gt;&gt; thank you Lord &gt;&gt; we what we've received is a word of god in this day that is judging us now as the bride of Jesus Christ we don't enter into a judgment to come. But we have a a word that is washing us now. It is judging us. It is coming. It is indicting the matter. It's telling us our hearts and the affections that it that could be attached to it need to be cut away. &gt;&gt; Because we have to bring forth Christ. &gt;&gt; We don't have another option. &gt;&gt; Our hearts must bring forth the Christ child. We have to declare Christ. There's not another place that it's going to take place. There's not another one. It's you or nothing. &gt;&gt; It's the bride of Jesus Christ declaring who Christ is from her heart or there's no one going to do it. &gt;&gt; And it's given. This is the age. This is the hour. &gt;&gt; This is the time. This is the season. It's been for such a time as this. &gt;&gt; It there's no option. &gt;&gt; You're the tree is either good or it's bad. You're either going to produce the mature fruit for this day or you're not. &gt;&gt; So, we have to be in anticipation and expectation. We have to be looking. We have to be desiring. We have to be saying, "Lord, I want the very nature and character of Christ dealt out in my life. &gt;&gt; Nothing less." our character. We want him to be known. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just skipping through for the sake of time, but I want to read this. And any man, I'm going to back up just a little bit. Well, it seems like then upon thinking those things that there could be a placing by reading the word of faith that would go beyond the intellectual conceptions into the heart. Jesus said, "If thou sayest in thy heart now, we get all flustered in our minds and we go out and say, "Oh, I seen that done." Yes. And once in a while, I just hop, skip, and so forth. So, he's talking about just not really hitting the beat. You know, it's sometimes I'm up. It almost be like an up and down. Sometimes I'm running at it. Sometimes I, you know, sometimes things go good, sometimes they don't. And it seems like I just can't get moving right. It's because we try to mix the intellectual with the supernatural. They have no dealings with each other at all. Intellectuals will say one thing and the supernatural will say another. And any man that is ever led by the spirit of God does not take any thought of any intellectual, but he is led by from his heart by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your heart, &gt;&gt; what it has is the very spirit of Christ in it. &gt;&gt; And we need to trust that. Not the deceitful heart, &gt;&gt; not this other heart, but something has transpired in a in a people. Now, Brother Brandham goes on and he makes this relatable. He says, "Right now, I have letters and phone calls. You mean, Brother Brandham, that you would wouldn't be going overseas after all this great, but it looks wonderful. Something way down inside said, be careful." So, brother Bram saying, you know, in his heart, he wants to do what's right. He wants to go. This is a great opportunity. This is the move of God. This is this is God moving. But something in his heart saying, "Be careful." And therefore, we don't look at what we see. We look at those things which we do not see. What God says in the heart. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand, we have to have our hearts tuned. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; We have to have our hearts in a condition to know the will of God. &gt;&gt; And in this day and in this hour, spiritual amnesia &gt;&gt; is a plague. &gt;&gt; You are given to know the mind and heart of God. We've received a word in this day to tell you what the mind of heart and heart of God is. The heart's that channel. The character of your heart really has a lot to do with how effective that channel is, right? Because Jesus would pray in the garden, not my will, but thine be done. There's the sacrificial nature of your heart that has to be able to lay down its own wants and its own desires to display the true character of who Christ is. So there's the deceitful heart, there's the there, you know, it really that where's the greatest battle ever fought, right? It's taking place over your affections. It's taking place and you should be so thankful when the word of God comes and indictes you &gt;&gt; and tells you that something isn't right in your heart. &gt;&gt; That's the grace of God to you. &gt;&gt; That's I don't I don't want to have a heart that's displeasing to him. &gt;&gt; Saints, I want the word to come. If we become so dull of hearing that when something's said in correction or said what's right or someone just says something, we can't see the truth in it. We just become defensive. &gt;&gt; We're just more interested in our self-image and our own pride. &gt;&gt; We can't even know that that person probably said that because it's the very heartbeat of God. &gt;&gt; We get more offended by the way it was brought. &gt;&gt; You know, you can't. The donkeyy's telling you no, and you're like, &gt;&gt; I got my way. heart condition. &gt;&gt; You got a heart problem &gt;&gt; and and it's okay. You were born that way. &gt;&gt; You must be born again. &gt;&gt; You have to die. &gt;&gt; Boy, dying ain't easy. &gt;&gt; But God, now the way of God was to declare himself in you. Okay? So when we're talking about a tree, we're talking about a nature behind it. God's desire is that you be fruitful and you multiply and that you bring forth much fruit. That's his desire of you. That's the heart of God. That's the mind of God. That's the intelligence behind it. That is what's pushing for manifestation. That's why there's a struggle because that life has to be manifested. &gt;&gt; That's the intelligence behind it. &gt;&gt; And now character, how's his character displayed? By a bed of ease. Where we I mean, let's be honest. Let's look at the Bible and we say everybody in the Bible, even Daniel, they had everything perfect. They were above reproach and they were just I mean Job, I mean everybody that I could think of in the Bible when they showed forth the glory of God, they were just maybe Solomon was, you know, he was pretty good actually. He had faults though, right? But there there is an understanding that God is proven. His character is tested. what he does must stand the test. Every son of God that comes to God must be is is chasened of the Lord, right? Because he knows what you're made of. &gt;&gt; You don't know what you're made of, &gt;&gt; but there's a there's a life inside of you that's going to bring forth a fruit. And brother Brandham in this sermon would talk about the guy who built the bridge. And he he said that there was a he he he gets excited about it because he's saying this man in in his in his building of the bridge, he went and got the best he got the best engineers. He got the best concrete. He got the best of everything because he's going to build a bridge. And you have to understand, brother Cosman, God's got a record. &gt;&gt; He gets the best. &gt;&gt; He ain't a second place God. He whatever category he was in, he's first place. &gt;&gt; He's got the record. &gt;&gt; You're the best. &gt;&gt; What he's placed inside of you is overcoming power. It don't have a second place. &gt;&gt; It's the best. And you know what? In proving it's the best, sometimes it's just got to get a lot of things out of the way. &gt;&gt; When you when he's setting the pillars for the bridge, he's throwing sand. He's using the blasters. He's But he's going to get down to the bedrock. And when it comes down to it, you go, I know my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; I Lord, you've destroyed me. I have nothing left. But this I know. &gt;&gt; I know your love. Oh my, it's good to be on the potter's wheel. &gt;&gt; And that is God's love towards you. Now just share this. This was a blessing to me. Like Jesus was a witness of God. He become so full of God till him and God was one. God dwelt in Christ reconciling the world to himself. The very expression a man's work declares his character. Christ was God's work. Christ declaring God's character. His feeling for the sick. His longing for saving souls till even he gave his own life. God's work. God's character was declared in Christ. And if you can just empty your own intellectual thoughts out and give God the right of way, he can declare his character through the work of you of your yielding. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, you can't give what you ain't got. &gt;&gt; Your good will and your desire to do something for someone in all your efforts, you might as well be a Mother Teresa. &gt;&gt; Nothing could come of it. God's not in it. &gt;&gt; Nothing could come of it. But I've got news for you. If you could empty yourself out, if you could yield yourself enough, you say, "God, have the right of way. &gt;&gt; Lord, take this heart. Take this mind. Take my desires. It's yours. &gt;&gt; Have the right of way. &gt;&gt; Empty up. Get the word the world. Get your doubts out of the way. If you come to the altar to be prayed for, say, "I'll go up and I'll just get if I get healed." God can never declare his works. You've got to get your own thoughts out of the way and let him fill you. &gt;&gt; This is not a passive religion. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go see if God's God. We got a lot of people whose hearts are never in it. Their hearts aren't it. They never did. Now, this is the promise. Second Peter 1:4-12. We're just going to go through this. Whereby are ye given un whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And besides this, so now you are partakers of divine. Don't let that word divine get lost. divine nature. You partakers of divine nature. You who were once alienated from God. You who had a deceitful heart, a heart that was was corrupted. How could this be? How could it be that you were made a partaker? And he goes on and he talks about the stature of a perfect man. He goes through and he lists the virtues. I think we're close to um do we have time? What time do we start? &gt;&gt; Thank you. All right. So, we'll we'll read it because it's good. It's God's word. Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And besides this, give all diligence. This is our part. Add to your faith virtue and to the virtue knowledge, and to the knowledge, temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience, godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and the brotherly kindness charity, love, the capstone. For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that you shall be neither barren nor unfruitful. &gt;&gt; So what's the intelligence behind the tree? What's the desire? It's that you be fruitful. How do we be fruitful? This is it's right here. There's a restoration to the bride tree. This is the things that were ate away through each church age, right? We know what this we have the way back. We have how to get rid of spiritual amnesia. We understand the very way that God combed these things and and how these were taken away from the church and how they're restored back. We live in the age where we can say we've been made partakers of divine nature. And if we're partakers of divine nature, then we are neither barren nor unfruitful. This is why this is possible. Ezekiel 36, for I will take from you among the heathen, and gather you out of the countries, and will bring you unto your own land. Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you. And I will take away the stony heart of your flesh. and I will give you a heart of flesh, and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk into my statutes, and you shall keep my judgments and do them. Hallelujah. I couldn't keep them before. I couldn't do them before. I tried and I failed. Oh, but he took out my stony heart. &gt;&gt; He took out that heart of a David McGary Jr. Oh my. Oh, brother Brandham talks about that that that boy that was an Irish and German descent. And he says he had the genes. He said the parents are born again, but he was stuck with that nature. He says until he's born again, no. Oh, saints, you don't have to worry about how treacherous your heart is. I know the heart mener. I know the one who can take out the stony heart and give you a new heart. Are you willing to put your heart on his altar and say, "Consume it, Lord." Yeah. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you take your heart and you put it on his altar and I say, "Lord, even right now, the things that I've if I've lost my first love, if my heart has gone astray, if there's anything in my heart that's not messed with yours, Lord, give me a new heart." This is your attribute. &gt;&gt; You can't change. &gt;&gt; Your word said you would do this. It didn't say I would do it. &gt;&gt; David McGary is going to go change his heart. He's a He's a good leopard licker. He'll take his spots right off. can't do it. &gt;&gt; I can't I can't change the nature of how deceitful and treacherous this heart is of a man. But he promised that he would give you a new heart and a new spirit. Why is it even possible that the tree could start bringing forth a good fruit? It ain't you. &gt;&gt; The redemption of Calvary is so profound. Well, what Calvary allowed you to partake in is the very nature of Jesus Christ. The nature that could cause him to go to the cross and say, "Father, forgive for they know not what they do." All of a sudden, you have a virtue in you. The nature of a lamb that could say, "Father, forgive." Oh, that's not my strength. That's because he's given me a new heart. &gt;&gt; That's a character that he wants on display. &gt;&gt; He wants the nature of Christ on display that loves, forgives &gt;&gt; what he was, Christ declared the heart of God. We get so lost in our religion that you don't we I wonder if we even understand what we look like, the way we treat other people, our thought processes towards other people. He died for the sins of the world. That person out there, Brother Brandon, walking into the diner was not &gt;&gt; that wasn't a nice story. That was the heart of God. &gt;&gt; He paid for those sins. That's why you you're quick to put people under the blood because he paid that price. You forgive &gt;&gt; because if you judge, you're judged. &gt;&gt; It's heart condition. &gt;&gt; When your heart is in a place where you're judging other people's, there's your heart's not you're not in tune. You're you're you're losing your you're not in that place of fellowship. You ought to be and we all can get there. &gt;&gt; It this is this is a checkup. This is examin. We have communion to examine ourselves. And the churches that don't have communion, they might not just be examining themselves. And it shows in the way they dress. They got worldliness all in the church. The makeup's back in. The d the short skirts are back in. And it's all in the name of the message. Worldly musics are being played in the church. [snorts] &gt;&gt; In the church. I'm not saying during the service. I'm saying in the sanctuary in the house of God. &gt;&gt; They're playing music that ought not to be played, no examination, &gt;&gt; no checkup of the heart condition. You ain't fooling God. &gt;&gt; If you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God is not even in you. &gt;&gt; You got to check up. character, &gt;&gt; character. You know, the the the ruggedness of a Christian in the in the life of a Christian. We don't sacrifice anything anymore. We don't give up anything. We are more selfish. And I'm must be preaching that myself. But the and when I say sacrifice, I'm not I don't have a Catholic idea of Ash Wednesday or you know like I'm going to give up chocolate for a week so I could show that I could sacrifice something. I'm talking about when do you lay yourself down for somebody else? When do you when they ask you to go a mile, do you go twain? When do you take the harder way? And if that isn't happening in our lives, it's not because there ain't a cross to bear. It's because we don't know the mind of Christ. This is what brother Brandham would say. His works cannot fail. His character cannot fail. And his works declare his character. And so he's arisen today, and he's here in our midst, the same yesterday, today, and forever. And we're witnesses of his character. His character has changed me. When it come to me, I was once a sinner and now I'm saved. I was once lost, now I'm found. I once loved the things of the world. I hate it now. Somebody saw me crying the other day and [laughter] they're like, "Why is Dave Jr. crying?" I appreciated brother Jeremy coming and talking about a vase that's broken. Saints, when I start thinking about where my heart was, I start crying about the grace of God in my life. I can't help it. If you if this is a crack in the vase for his glory that I'm just going to be a baller because when I start thinking about where I was, &gt;&gt; I was an enemy to God. My heart was strayed from it. It's not that I didn't know the truth. I knew the truth and I was an enemy of the truth. Oh, but God rich in mercy. Oh, he reached down to me. And you [laughter] know what? I just got to thank him. When I think about I just got to tell him I love him. It wasn't me who did it. It was divine intervention. &gt;&gt; It was the grace of God. And you know what, Lord? I can't change for the way you brought me. I would have much rather been a good kid. &gt;&gt; I wish I would have I serve I see kids Oh, my heart rejoices. They love the Lord and the things of God. What a beautiful testimony. I'm more zealous for that testimony than the one I I [laughter] had. I wish I could tell I wished I could live the way you live. So, it's just a broken vase with some lines in it, a couple tears, but I tell you what, you stand in the glory of God, being proclaiming his grace of holiness and righteousness and overcoming and with a zeal for the love of God and for the things of God with a passion for God. Don't compromise. &gt;&gt; But he changed me. &gt;&gt; I once cared not for God. I love him now. Something happened to me. Something happened to you. What is it? It's God's work declaring his character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter] You're meant to declare the very character of who he is. That's restoration. &gt;&gt; That's what we're going to wrap up here. This here, this is a dying spirit and a dying body. Think about the will of man. How's you how you get old and in a man of a broken spirit. So this is a body that's dying and and it it's just but now you can't be in two bodies at one time. But there you can have two natures in you at one time. Now the nature of the spirit of the lord when you are born again you're not born to physical like the baby was but that happened is the spiritual birth has come into you while the spirit birth is growing into your heart so it's a growth it's like a tree it's like the wheat plant right so when the heart condition we talk you know we know that the parable of the condition of the seed going into the ground and how that's a heart so it's got to grow but it's growing that's the the thing to take away. And when the life leaves the body, this is a this is beautiful. It goes to that body. Our theophony just as when the body is presented to the earth, the spirit comes in. And when the spirit goes out of the body, there is a body waiting. For we know that there are earthly tabernacle be dissolved. We have one already waiting. See, so what is your heart in tune with? What is your heart hearing from? You [snorts] know the very the the introspection here is is if your heart cares for the things of the world then that's that human nature heart. That's what you're hearing from. And you need to discern that voice in your life. Young children know that the world would try to tell you that's who you are. That's death. But you have another body. So there's a a nature that cares for the things of the world. But when you're born again, you receive a nature that cares for the things of God. &gt;&gt; And that body, you have a new one. It's not like this body. It doesn't have the cares and the wants and the desires and the things that encumber us here. There's something that's crying for a complete redemption. I can't wait till I get out of this pest house. But if you got to realize, do you realize if you've been set free? That's more of a reality to you than the cares and wants of this flesh. You've been set free from it. But do you realize how many people are in bondage to keeping this thing optimal? &gt;&gt; I mean, there's like some billionaire out there who's his I think he doesn't even want to get married because it might decrease his lifespan. I don't know what record he's going for, but my God's a got a record. [laughter] I mean, that guy, whatever record he's going to obtain a I mean, he can't even beat the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; My God's a got a record, but I got a I got a better record for you. I've got eternal life. But if you care for this world and the things of this world, that care is going to die with this body. You're I hope that your heart is declaring where your treasures are laid up. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to get rid of my complexes. I'm going to read. I don't know if I read good or not, but hopefully this is salty enough you go back and find it. So, we're talking about what God's restored in this day. There's a bride tree. There's a fruit to be manifested. That's the life that's in you. It requires the heart that's been restored. We talked about Ezekiel. We talked about how that your heart now has been made a place where the very life of Christ could bring forth wells of living water where you are producing the very nature of Christ. But the original church began in Jerusalem at AD.33 on the day of Pentecost. That's where we'd have to go back to. I'm trying to get back there. But see, with the antichrist move, trying to make the antichrist, the real spirit of God, trying to move them back to the original faith again. Look at here. What does the palmer palmer left? The caterpillar eat. What the caterpillar left, the cankerworm eaten on down till it get down to the stump. Joel saw it and said, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord, all the years that they've eaten." Now it was about a thousand years there. There was nothing but a stump. So now we're it's come through the church ages. But you cannot because the life of that tree is predestinated to bring forth the tree. &gt;&gt; The intelligence behind this is a predestinated elected life force of God. He's going to have his heart's desire. Now about a thousand years predestinated bringeth forth a tree. Come up. Luther started it growing. What did he do? Organized. The husbandman pruned the branches. Come up to the Methodist. What did it do? Organize. Just like the mother pruned the branches. Come on up into Pentecostalism. Pentecostals. It's done the same thing. Organize. God has pruned back the branches. But that life in the heart of that tree has to live. God said I will restore. For the evening light has to ripen. In the middle of that tree stands the heart of God. This is the manger. This is the very place where God chose. He could have done it in the heavens. He could have done it in a lot of places. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; But he's chose to do it in you. In the middle of the tree stands the heart of God that the bride tree to meet the bridegroom tree just like it was in the Garden of Eden. Originally the tree, the two trees of life take Adam and Eve as the shadow of the two trees that actually stood there. Life and death. [snorts] Our position and where we stand is to know the very mind and heart of God. And a lot of what we said, it may look like it's an evaluation of our heart, but really, what was the heart of God? What was it that held him on the cross? If the musicians would come, what was it that would cause him to live a life that he could say, "For their sakes, I sanctify myself. And the privilege we have of knowing the mind of Christ was that we could understand the nature that we're to display. I I don't know of anybody else who could sit there and go back and tell you before the world was formed that you were in the thoughts of God that he desired to have a family that you were predestinated attribute. There's this the language of this message starts to speak to the nature of who God is &gt;&gt; to the very heartbeat and the mind of Christ. And what we want is our natures by the Holy Ghost to be the lamb to be the the that the dove could rest upon. We don't want carnalism. We don't want the cares of this world. And that it happens, saints, our hearts need to be evaluated. They have we have to check up. We have to say, is God in this desire. And I believe that there's enough word. You know, you take a you take a rag. Sometimes I've cleaned up some very dirty things and you get it full of something, oil, and you start to take the water and you you run it over it. And it really isn't just just having the water run over it ain't really doing much. But you take it and you squeeze it out and you notice whatever that was in it, it it kind of starts to come out and you run the water over it and it kind of sponges back up and you squeeze it again. And as you wash that and you keep squeezing it, you're looking for when there's no more trace of the other thing that's been picked up in it. You just squeeze it a little more and you just you want to wash it out. I say, Lord, if you have to take my heart and you have to squeeze it a little bit, just squeeze any worldliness out of it and Lord, fill it back up with your word. If I feel a little pressure, if I feel like all of a sudden I'm having to make choices, what is it? You're washing my life. &gt;&gt; What I want to make sure is I don't fill it back. When I when I feel the squeeze, I don't want to fill it back up with the world. I want that water to come in and I want it to wash it. And I want to start feeding my heart the things of God. And you know what? He might squeeze it again because what is he looking for? He's looking for that time where what all that comes out of it is all the word. It's all the life, all the worldliness has been beaten out of it. It's proclaiming the very life and nature of Christ. But sometimes the heart has to be squeezed. We have to be willing to put our hearts on the potter's will and say, "Lord, squeeze it." &gt;&gt; Will you not my will but thy be done? &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust that spoke to your hearts tonight. Amen. I know the prophet said [music] that the number one killer of mankind is heart disease. and and and I and I really believe with all my heart that a Christian is one who's who's received the new [music] heart. We we are not called to take our hearts and [music] and try to insert religion and try to insert and and mix it up like our brother said, it's never going to work. You we need a clean heart and [music] a new heart. They said, "I'll take away this stony heart. I'll give you a new heart and and and [music] I'll take away your spirit. I'll put in a new spirit and I'll give you a heart of flesh. A heart that can obey the word of God. I I tell you, you can try to [music] live by the letter and try all that you can. It's all nothing but filthy rag. &gt;&gt; But what we need is a heart of a heart that can receive the word of God. But when I'm said in the church ages, they said you couldn't receive the word because you didn't have the spirit of God. I thought, "Oh, I needed the word so I can receive the spirit." No. The seed that's placed in you [music] was made to receive the word. &gt;&gt; And and I want to say this, it's not we come and we say, "Oh, if I was a child of God, then I'll do this." No. Because you are a son of God, then you will do it. It's not because it's the enemy that would come and say, "Well, if you are a son of God, then you would do this, right? If you're a son of God, then you do this." Then you're like, "Am I a son or am I not a son?" No. The reason why you're sitting here today, it's because God has touched your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and what we need is is to separate ourselves from the things of the world. We God don't want us to be half filled with the world and half filled with the with the word of God. No, he wants it's our job. The scripture says that we hold our vessel in holiness and and we God wants to dwell in our heart. He created the heart. But Rom says no man builds a house so they can live it empty and he created your heart so he can dwell in it. &gt;&gt; And and that's what we desire. We said, "Lord, my heart has been drawn aside by the things of the world, but Father, I want to come back and I I want to clean my heart tonight. I want you to give me a clean heart and a hearts that cry out. A heart that will hear, a heart, a contrite heart and a broken heart that actually desires the things of God." Not just just run after an extra dollar and what I can gain for myself. A heart. Jesus was the heart of God. But when says, "I used to think that God hated me and God was against me until I saw Jesus Christ. He was the very heart of God manifested." Now, it didn't stop at Jesus. You are the very heart of God manifested. you know, and this religion or this gospel is not just for us to say, well, you know, as long as I I'm in a church setting, then we have to love one another. No, that's not what Jesus did. You know, says we we get to a place where people, you know, if you scratch my back, I'll scratch your back. He said, that's not how it ought to be. Whether you scratch my back or not, if you need, I'll scratch your back. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I tell you sometimes we talk about the mysteries and the great things and the coming and the cloud and this and we forget the very fundamental &gt;&gt; of what the Christian life is all about. &gt;&gt; It's about laying down our lives &gt;&gt; so we can take up his. It's about giving up all that we are so we can take him. So as he was so are we in this world to every everybody that we meet. This generation has to know that Jesus Christ is alive and well. And the only way they would know is through your heart. [music] &gt;&gt; God give us a right kind of heart. Why don't we stand and sing &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh create in me a clean heart of G. Amen. Create in me a clean heart. Oh God and winter arise spirit [singing] [music] within me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; road [singing] creating me a clean [music] heart.

Oh, I am [music and singing] by the power of your love. Oh, glory [music] be [music] that should I surround [music] me. Oh, [singing] [music] hallelujah. You draw me to [singing] your and [music] [music] I rise up [music and singing] like oh and I will show [music] you. Oh, your spirit leads me on in the power of your love. [singing] [music] Oh Lord, I'm [music] see. &gt;&gt; That's my heart desire tonight. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, and the knowledge of your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh [music] my go [singing and music] in my life. Oh, and [music] you live it [singing] every day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; in the power of [singing] your love [music] and hold me. [music] They should not surround [music] [singing] me. Hallelujah. Bring me near [music and singing] Lord. Oh me to you. I draw [music and singing] me to your side. [music] my way. I'll rise up like an [music and singing] eagle, Lord, and I will [music and singing] show you. Oh, and your spirit is beyond in the power [music and singing] of your love. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I trust that's your heart desire. That's my heart desire that my nature be changed and be filled with the love of God because that's the only thing that will bring about the change we [music] need. But a Chris, if you could just come and dismiss us tonight. Amen. If you need prayer, just come. [music] We'll be prayed for. We certainly enjoy the word and pray that the Lord will bless our brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just thank you so much for bringing us here tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that we heard from you, Lord. We've been in your presence that you were here. [music] &gt;&gt; Father, even if we didn't see you or feel you, Father, you said you'd be here, Lord. We know you were here. &gt;&gt; Father, we've sang many songs now about a new heart, Father. [music] Lord, that's the desire of every person here. And I pray, oh God, that it'd be more than a song for us, Lord. God, I pray, Father, that you give us revelation and ISAF to search our hearts, Lord. I don't want to look at my heart through my own eyes, Lord, but may I see it through your word. And Father, I'm so thankful, Lord, that Lord, as it was said, I can't change it, Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; Father, you brought us here, Lord, and we're just trusting [music] that the work you start, you'll finish, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I pray, oh God, that someone here tonight, Father, maybe they have the desire to lay a heart down. Maybe they don't know how, Father. I pray, God, that you'd move on every heart in this place, Lord. that there's a desire deep down that they want this heart that you speak of, Father. Lord, I pray, God, that you'd just break every chain, Lord. That you'd release it, Father. That you'd drive away the fear and the doubt and the worry and the complex, [music] Lord. That you just let them know. If you could just lay it down, you'd be in control of everything. &gt;&gt; Father, we just thank you. We love you, Lord. We just commit the evening into your hands. We just pray that you be with everyone as we leave, Lord. Father, we just ask that you touch our brother, Lord. Restore unto him, Father. Father, fill him up. Give him virtue, Father. Lord, continue to speak to him, Father. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. You dismiss continue to remember our pastor. The Lord will continue to he's doing much better and we want to just continue to pray for him. Amen. Be okay. Key of G. Beautiful Lord. Wonderful Savior. I know for sure.
