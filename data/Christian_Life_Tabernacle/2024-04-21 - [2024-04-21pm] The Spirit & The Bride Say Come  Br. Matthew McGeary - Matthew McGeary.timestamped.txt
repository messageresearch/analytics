[39:48] anchored us we don't have to be tossed
[39:50] to and fro into uh run after some new

[40:32] hour that's all I need hey he's my hope
[40:35] he's my stay it's my all and all all my
[40:37] eggs are in one basket wherever this
[40:39] message takes me I'm
[40:41] going praise the Lord just reading out
[40:43] of John chapter
[40:45] 20 and we're going to read uh verse
[40:50] 21 uh through 23 says then Jesus said
[40:54] unto them now and maybe we just back a
[40:57] little bit just to give a little um uh
[41:00] show where this is taking place uh it
[41:02] says then the in verse 19 then the same
[41:04] day at evening being the first day of
[41:07] the week when the doors were shut where
[41:08] the disciples were assembled for fear of
[41:10] the Jews came Jesus and stood in the
[41:13] midst of them and said unto them peace
[41:16] be unto you so look at the condition
[41:18] that they were in they were fearful they
[41:21] were afraid they were the the doors were
[41:23] shut and he says peace be unto you and
[41:26] when he had so said he showed unto him
[41:29] them his hands and his side then were
[41:32] the disciples glad when they saw the
[41:35] Lord then said Jesus to them again peace
[41:38] be unto you as my father has sent me
[41:42] even so send I you and when he had said
[41:47] this he breathed on them and saith unto
[41:48] them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever
[41:52] sins you remit they are remitted unto
[41:54] them and whosoever sins ye retain
[41:58] they are retained we just ask a blessing
[41:59] upon the reading of the word you may be
[42:01] seated also if you'll just turn in your
[42:04] Bible with me uh over into
[42:07] Revelations uh chapter 22 we'll read a
[42:10] familiar uh scripture there as
[42:14] well everybody
[42:17] comfortable you enjoying the the extra
[42:19] space and the air condition and the nice
[42:22] clean pews I pray we can keep them that
[42:25] way
[42:29] amen just reading out of uh Revelation
[42:32] uh chapter 22 now and verse uh
[42:39] 17-9 it reads and the
[42:42] spirit and the bride say
[42:46] come let him that of thirst and let let
[42:50] him that heareth say come and let him
[42:52] that a thirst come and whosoever will
[42:55] let him take the water of life freely
[42:59] for I testify unto every man that
[43:01] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[43:04] this book If any man shall add unto
[43:06] these things God shall add unto him the
[43:08] plagues that are written in this book
[43:11] and if any man shall take away from the
[43:13] words of the prophecy God shall take
[43:16] away his part out of the book of life
[43:19] and out of the holy city and from the
[43:21] things which are written in this book
[43:25] amen so uh just in in reading that uh
[43:28] scripture it says the spirit and the
[43:30] bride say come there's an invitation
[43:33] that is going out and the spirit and the
[43:35] bride they are saying the same thing
[43:37] they're saying come what is the
[43:40] invitation what are we inviting people
[43:42] to and it's by the revelation of the
[43:44] hour that we start to understand the
[43:47] hour that we're living in and what the
[43:49] invitation is and what we're being
[43:51] called out of we're being called out of
[43:53] the denominational all all the the shuck
[43:55] has pulled away the the hour of the
[43:57] restoration of the gifts and the Revival
[44:00] that broke out through the country from
[44:02] 1906 and and was moving down in those
[44:05] early age and and I believe William
[44:07] Seymour and and all of those wonderful
[44:09] things there was a great Revival and a
[44:11] great move that was going on and and it
[44:13] had to be that way because there was
[44:15] going to come the spoken word The
[44:16] Original Seed was going to come uh and
[44:19] manifest itself in the middle of That
[44:21] Shook and as that word would be become
[44:24] manifested that Shu would start to pull
[44:26] away and he would start to identify look
[44:29] that the Revival is over uh uh
[44:31] everything that was catching their
[44:32] attention the restoration of the gifts
[44:34] and and the speaking in tongues and all
[44:36] of those things that was taking place
[44:38] the prophet of God comes along and he
[44:40] says look uh uh those things that caught
[44:42] your attention and and everything that
[44:44] you you you know uh that you're you're
[44:46] looking for that that's dead we're now
[44:48] entering into another age so there was a
[44:50] lot of people a as the years went on
[44:53] they were they were trying to get back
[44:54] to that same Revival kind of to see see
[44:57] the restoration of the gifts and that
[44:58] fire just burning up again but here
[45:00] stands a prophet telling them look that
[45:02] Revival's over it's gone you you're
[45:04] you're fasting and praying for something
[45:06] to come upon the church but the spirit
[45:09] of God is moving on we're moving into a
[45:11] different age I just draw your attention
[45:13] as we're just uh trusting that God would
[45:15] just take us and and and lead us
[45:17] according to his leadership of the Holy
[45:19] Spirit but if you just jump into uh uh
[45:21] the scriptures and you start to look
[45:23] what uh uh the prophet of God would say
[45:25] in the third seal he would say the bride
[45:28] hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no
[45:31] Revival there no manifestation of God to
[45:34] stir the bride yet see we're looking for
[45:36] it now now I think that's a profound
[45:38] thing right there to look and see here's
[45:40] the prophet of God standing in 1963 and
[45:43] he's telling the church he's stand there
[45:44] say look there's been no manifestation
[45:46] to stir the bride yet there's been no
[45:48] Revival for the bride I sit back there
[45:50] and I look at that and I start to wonder
[45:52] what do you mean brother brandom the
[45:54] blind eyes were open the dead had been
[45:56] raised uh the first pull was in
[45:58] manifestation by there you were you the
[46:00] spirit of God was taking people by the
[46:02] hand and and telling them of their
[46:04] problems and then the second pull came
[46:06] in the Discerning of the thoughts and
[46:07] intents of the heart you you would think
[46:09] my what what a stirring what a Revival
[46:12] that would have been what of an
[46:13] attraction that would have been but now
[46:15] he's standing there and he's preaching
[46:17] the third seal and he's saying the bride
[46:19] hasn't had a
[46:22] Revival
[46:23] yet okay so what he's doing the prophet
[46:27] of God is now showing you that I'm I'm
[46:29] going to show you where we're at in time
[46:30] as our as our pastor was talking about
[46:33] this morning I want to show you where
[46:34] we're at in time what what are we
[46:36] looking for what is it going to take
[46:38] what what what is what are you what are
[46:40] you hungering for what are you thirsting
[46:41] for are you fasting and you're praying
[46:44] and you're longing for some great
[46:45] Revival and you want to see the
[46:47] manifestation of the gifts and all of
[46:49] those things sure they have been re
[46:50] stored to the church they are present
[46:53] amongst us we have to have those things
[46:55] because it was part of the restoration
[46:59] right he was Resto he didn't restore it
[47:00] back to take it
[47:02] out but you see there was an age when
[47:05] the restoration came into the church but
[47:07] now once that's been
[47:09] satisfied now I I I just have to say it
[47:11] like it is is now think if you're
[47:13] restoring a
[47:14] car right if if if you got a hunk of
[47:17] metal there and it's it's been all Tor
[47:19] down and and chopped off down to the
[47:21] ground and now you're going to start
[47:22] restoring it back what are you going to
[47:24] do you're going to start banging out the
[47:26] metal you're going to straighten it out
[47:27] you're going to start getting the frame
[47:29] right you're going to start getting back
[47:31] in the the the seats and getting it all
[47:33] set up and and you're going to rewire
[47:35] and get it all all the electricity put
[47:38] back in it just right you're going to
[47:39] get the wheels on it and I imagine when
[47:41] it finally takes shape and you look at
[47:43] him like my goodness does that look like
[47:44] a 1967
[47:47] chevel doesn't it look good well yeah
[47:50] but let's take a look at it like oh you
[47:52] know no I I the outside looks good but I
[47:54] haven't gotten the battery in and I
[47:56] haven't got the alternator in yet oh
[47:59] okay oh oh what are you doing I'm
[48:00] restoring it see right now it's starting
[48:02] to take form it's starting to take shape
[48:04] of what it once was but see I'm in the
[48:06] process of restoring it back to what it
[48:09] once was so now when you start to put in
[48:11] the battery and you start to put in the
[48:12] radio and you start to get everything
[48:14] and you get in there you're like H H Ho
[48:16] Ho Hey W the horn works all right now
[48:20] why don't you try the
[48:22] radio this is krld D all right we got
[48:26] the radio you work in my and you'll
[48:27] start to Rejoice you'll start to be
[48:30] thankful because where you're at in the
[48:32] process of restoration now you're
[48:34] thankful because in the season in the
[48:36] Revival if that's what the Sheep music's
[48:39] calling for oh here we're in the process
[48:41] of restoration and this is when the
[48:43] battery goes in this is when the
[48:45] alternator goes in this is when the
[48:46] radio starts to work then you're in tune
[48:49] to look for these things to go into
[48:53] action so now the radio's working the
[48:55] batter's charged the alternators
[48:58] in but now when it comes
[49:01] time to start that
[49:05] thing I understand the radio
[49:07] works when we get in to start the
[49:10] vehicle don't say well brother Matthew
[49:11] look the radio works we can honk our
[49:13] horn I know I can honk my horn I'll honk
[49:16] my horn every single day I'mma turn on
[49:19] the music and I'm going to Rejoice it's
[49:22] already there it's good to be
[49:25] reminded turn it on honk the horn but
[49:29] that ain't gonna take you
[49:33] anywhere it's we need it it got to be
[49:36] there it's part of the restoration but
[49:38] now when it comes time that you got to
[49:39] turn that key how many have ever worked
[49:42] on a car and you you replace this and
[49:44] you replace that and it comes down the
[49:45] Moment of
[49:53] Truth well yeah you're not having a
[49:55] Revival
[49:57] because the horn Works you're not having
[49:59] a Revival because the alternator and the
[50:02] battery
[50:06] works hey we got fire in this thing now
[50:10] why why are you getting excited because
[50:12] it's come time it's come the hour that
[50:15] the Dynamics got to come into the
[50:17] mechanics because I want to tell you you
[50:19] can toot your horn you can turn on the
[50:21] radio but that ain't going to take you
[50:22] nowhere there got to come a time when
[50:24] the Dynamics comes upon the mechanic and
[50:26] it gets time ready to
[50:28] go you can sit in the garage and you can
[50:31] listen to the radio you can toot your
[50:32] hor but when it comes time to go to the
[50:33] grocery
[50:35] store do you got gas in the tank do you
[50:39] got spark to make that thing
[50:42] run so now what are we looking
[50:46] for but brother brother random is

[52:19] needing to fast and pray why are we
[52:21] looking for something to

[52:29] placing them out there in the future and
[52:32] we're saying oh when this happens then I

[52:58] well it's a
[53:01] pressure I don't know about you but I I

[53:23] like I got your back I got your back
[53:24] turn your head look here go here stop
[53:27] that watch this hey if we were sensitive
[53:30] to what's going on in the Supernatural
[53:32] realm around us as our pastor was saying
[53:34] we need a
[53:36] shaking we we see what's going on in
[53:38] Israel we see what's going in all around
[53:42] us why do they do that why do we do that
[53:45] they want a Great
[53:47] Awakening if I may may just say maybe
[53:49] they're they're wanting a great
[53:52] Revival they're crying believing that
[53:54] there will be an Awakening they good
[53:56] people why is it what have they done
[54:00] they have not recognized The Awakening
[54:03] of the
[54:04] Bride see by being a Christian they feel
[54:08] the pull of the
[54:10] hour but they haven't recognize the
[54:13] Awakening of the
[54:16] Bride so so he says by being a Christian
[54:19] they feel the pul of the hour and they
[54:20] have not a recognizing what's been done
[54:24] that's what's making them feel that way
[54:26] they it something is supposed to happen
[54:29] but see they're looking for it way off
[54:31] in the future to
[54:32] come when it's already happening right
[54:37] by you if you're not careful that same
[54:40] Spirit gets on us we start looking for
[54:43] some manifestation down the road to come
[54:45] and we're failing to realize the Revival
[54:48] we're failing to realize the Awakening
[54:50] that this bride is now living
[54:54] in there ain't no no greater Revival
[54:57] there ain't no greater Awakening that's
[54:59] ever going to strike the face of this
[55:02] Earth but the bride's Revival that is
[55:04] taking right place by the
[55:06] word it's not a Revival or some TR
[55:09] attraction from an age gone by but it is
[55:12] a word Revival and what is this word
[55:14] Revival well let's get it from the mouth
[55:16] of a prophet he says the bride hasn't
[55:19] had a Revival yet we're back into the
[55:20] third seal there's been no Revival there
[55:23] no manifestation uh to stir the bride
[55:25] yet I tell you tell you what that makes
[55:26] me happy cuz sometimes I feel like I
[55:29] missed it sometimes I wanted to be back
[55:32] there in the healing campaigns and I
[55:34] wanted to see the spirit of God and the
[55:35] prophet say there goes the L Goos right
[55:37] there there goes the pillar of fire back
[55:39] there oh I would have Lov I would love
[55:41] to see all those things but then now
[55:43] what he's he's doing he's taking the
[55:45] church further he's taking us into what
[55:47] another
[55:48] age we're now moving out of the man
[55:52] age an intellectual Revival an
[55:56] intellectual revival can only take you
[55:58] so far but now we're moving into the
[56:00] bride age we're moving into the bride's
[56:03] Revival he says there's been no Revival
[56:06] there no manifestation of God to stir
[56:08] the bride so that means there's
[56:10] something coming to stir you Hallelujah
[56:14] that means there's something coming to
[56:16] stir you well what is I want to be
[56:18] stirred anybody want to be stirred I
[56:20] want my heart to be
[56:22] stirred what's this Great Awakening what
[56:24] is he talking about
[56:26] are they still in my thunder up there
[56:28] they sure are it's all right it's good
[56:31] it's good to it's good to have an open
[56:33] book test Hallelujah we got an open book
[56:36] test what is it going to take got an
[56:39] open book a ain't no secrets around here
[56:43] I'm not the eighth Messenger right you
[56:46] got thus sayith the Lord I was
[56:47] fellowship with a brother not too long
[56:48] ago we were talking about speaking in
[56:49] tongues and and all these things sure uh
[56:51] speaking in tongues is a gift that God
[56:54] has restored back to the church and
[56:55] there's people with with the gift and
[56:56] it's in operation well why don't we see
[56:59] it so often why don't we see so many of
[57:01] these things well I can't speak for the
[57:03] church I can't speak for the age I can
[57:05] only speak for myself and I know I
[57:06] already got thus sayith the
[57:09] Lord that's right there ain't no
[57:11] Mysteries there ain't no secrets I got
[57:12] thus sayth the Lord I got Malachi 4:5
[57:14] the Lord himself is here amen but God by
[57:18] his grace with those gifts in the church
[57:20] if if there's something going to happen
[57:22] and and sometimes you might hear it as a
[57:24] pronouncing of of blessings and those
[57:26] things are wonderful that can encourage
[57:27] somebody and uplift them and I say
[57:29] praise God that is wonderful we we we've
[57:31] had uh Christ himself come down and say
[57:34] you are The Virtuous bride without spot
[57:35] or wrinkle you never did it it's
[57:37] encouraging
[57:39] Hallelujah and if he wants to uh as he
[57:42] if if I could say as the prophet would
[57:44] have said it in order and there would be
[57:46] that maturity in the church and Gifts
[57:48] would be in operation and done according
[57:49] to the order that God called it he might
[57:51] say uh brother Matthew in two days
[57:53] you'll be going down this way there's
[57:55] going to be a tree that's going to fall
[57:56] out and you're going you you're going to
[57:57] want to look for this and that and this
[57:59] is going to take place okay I can't find
[58:02] that in black and white
[58:04] print I can pour through the message
[58:06] like where does that say surely Way
[58:09] Bedford Texas tree in the middle of the
[58:11] road right if God wants to operate in
[58:14] that capacity praise God we believe in
[58:16] those things and certainly when those
[58:18] things were being restored to the church
[58:21] we were tooting our horns we were
[58:22] blaring the radio it was a wonderful
[58:24] thing and we need all those things God
[58:26] placed them in the car so the car could
[58:28] operate and go down the road and I
[58:30] rejoice in those things but I want this
[58:32] thing to be able to run when it comes
[58:34] time to leave I want to go in a Rapture
[58:37] I'm to be caught up in the brid's
[58:39] Revival and what is the brides
[58:43] Revival we'll finish this
[58:45] eventually he said there's been no
[58:47] Revival there so you you ain't Miss
[58:51] nothing you ain't missed nothing Brother
[58:54] Gary oh he said there's been no Revival
[58:58] yet see there's been no Revival there no
[59:00] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[59:02] yet we're looking for it
[59:05] now it'll take those
[59:09] seven unknown Thunders back there to
[59:13] wake her up again see yeah he'll send it
[59:18] he promised now
[59:20] watch so you move on up that 63 March as
[59:23] he's breaking the seals and and that
[59:25] quote we read was a recognizing his day
[59:27] in 64 and he's saying look everybody is
[59:30] looking for something that's already
[59:32] here look no further church it's
[59:36] here what did the scripture say it said
[59:39] the Lord himself shall
[59:43] descend if the Lord himself is going to
[59:46] descend we have a promise in the
[59:48] scripture that says God will do nothing
[59:51] but what he Reveals His Secrets unto His
[59:54] prophets his servants so then if the
[59:57] Lord
[59:59] himself is going to
[1:00:02] descend that means there's going to be a
[1:00:04] Prophet come on the seat and say
[1:00:07] hey the Lord
[1:00:10] himself is going to
[1:00:15] descend look at that
[1:00:17] scripture the
[1:00:19] Lord
[1:00:23] himself the Lord
[1:00:29] himself not a
[1:00:32] prophet not something other than the
[1:00:36] Lord
[1:00:37] himself shall
[1:00:40] descend so what is the prophet standing
[1:00:42] there preaching the Rapture preaching
[1:00:44] the unveiling of God preaching the seals
[1:00:47] he's showing us that the Lord
[1:00:51] himself is
[1:00:54] descending to you
[1:00:58] now so much so that he would take the
[1:01:00] picture and say what was that turn it to
[1:01:04] your right that's our Lord up
[1:01:07] there showing us what was the Rapture
[1:01:10] the Lord shall descend with a shout he
[1:01:13] does all three while he is descending
[1:01:17] what is he declaring to you he's
[1:01:19] declaring to you the
[1:01:21] thing that's going to wake this bride
[1:01:24] up what is it going to shake you what is
[1:01:27] it that's going to get you in line what
[1:01:29] is it that's going to get you in a
[1:01:31] rapturing condition it's going to be the
[1:01:34] revealed word of the hour there's no
[1:01:37] other way there's no other method I
[1:01:40] don't care how many camps and and how
[1:01:41] many churches run around the whole world
[1:01:44] go to this conviction the convention go
[1:01:47] to the 12 steps of alcohol do whatever
[1:01:49] all these things they're going to be
[1:01:51] wonderful helps they might be a place
[1:01:53] where you meet God it might start
[1:01:56] Revival in your life there's only one
[1:01:58] thing and if they're preaching the
[1:01:59] unadulterated word of the hour then it's
[1:02:01] going to be a word Revival I'm glad we
[1:02:04] got some men in this message that aren't
[1:02:06] afraid to declare unto you that God has
[1:02:08] sent a prophet according to Malachi 4:5
[1:02:11] and his name is William Mariam brandom
[1:02:14] and God used that vessel as he descended
[1:02:17] down and used them like a microphone and

[1:06:11] to we we were just reev inviting him to
[1:06:14] another denomination are we just
[1:06:16] inviting him to another uh uh Revival
[1:06:19] with the same likeness of an old Revival
[1:06:22] no no why why that's why our pastor and
[1:06:25] the Propet takes the time to say look
[1:06:26] that Revival's gone it's
[1:06:28] over sure we might see some of the
[1:06:30] manifestations sure uh we might have a
[1:06:33] church Revival and a setting to where
[1:06:34] the power of God moves in a tremendous
[1:06:36] way and we need those things it's part
[1:06:38] of the restoration it's part of a church
[1:06:40] up a local church uh having a Revival
[1:06:43] those things are wonderful the prophet
[1:06:45] of God said the local church isn't
[1:06:46] dependent on local Reign you got to have
[1:06:48] your own
[1:06:50] Revival you got to have something that's
[1:06:52] sustaining you the Lord himself shall
[1:06:57] descend we have heard the message of the
[1:07:00] hour God declaring that he is
[1:07:04] here well I don't know where we're at so
[1:07:07] we'll just try to keep
[1:07:08] preaching but we read the scripture out
[1:07:10] of John now we're just going to start
[1:07:12] preaching for a little bit in John
[1:07:14] chapter 20 he says then peace be unto
[1:07:16] you as the father sent me even so I send
[1:07:19] you and when he said this he breathed on
[1:07:22] them and said to them receive ye the
[1:07:24] Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they
[1:07:26] are remitted unto them and whosoever
[1:07:28] sins you retain they are retained look
[1:07:29] it's going to take the bride of Christ
[1:07:32] to say
[1:07:34] come we have to give people an
[1:07:38] opportunity that which has been freely
[1:07:40] given give
[1:07:42] it the the the the spirit and the bride
[1:07:45] are saying the same thing come out from
[1:07:48] amongst Tre might people are you still
[1:07:50] preaching
[1:07:52] that that's your message
[1:07:55] to tell your co-workers to tell your
[1:07:57] friend to tell your mother your father
[1:07:59] your brother your sister your teammates
[1:08:02] right that's your message is to go out
[1:08:05] there and tell them to come out of them
[1:08:07] my people and be separated from all the
[1:08:10] nonsense out there what did the prophet
[1:08:12] of God said he said it's too much
[1:08:13] nonsense too much Hollywood too much TV
[1:08:16] I think that's all crept in to the
[1:08:18] church that we' become complacent that
[1:08:21] we think we're going to go in a Rapture
[1:08:23] because we go to a message Church sorry
[1:08:25] about
[1:08:27] it the fruits of the spirit better be on
[1:08:30] display in your
[1:08:32] life how do you know them by their
[1:08:36] fruits just look at how they dress and
[1:08:38] how they carry
[1:08:40] themselves if they're aspiring to be
[1:08:42] like the the world and and they're
[1:08:44] trying all these little uh uh gimmicks
[1:08:46] and tricks to to make them look like the
[1:08:48] world so they look better on Instagram
[1:08:50] and and can pucker their lips and look
[1:08:52] all Rosy and everything something
[1:08:54] wrong wake up children of God something
[1:08:57] wrong you're being influenced by
[1:08:59] something something's put a hook in you
[1:09:02] and it's pulling you the wrong
[1:09:04] way I say if there be any any anything
[1:09:07] in you that wants to be like God say God
[1:09:09] forgive me I hear the man of God and I
[1:09:12] say forgive
[1:09:13] me I've messed up time and time again
[1:09:17] and here I am I'm walking down the same
[1:09:19] trail and I didn't think I would back be
[1:09:21] back here and here you are again you're
[1:09:24] walking right into the same trapped
[1:09:25] thinking everything's Rosy and
[1:09:29] peachy just because you got some stamp
[1:09:31] of approval on it you better watch
[1:09:34] out you'll get hooked you better get the
[1:09:37] Holy
[1:09:39] Ghost well it's it's it Grieves my soul
[1:09:44] to see so many young people getting
[1:09:46] married in our churches without the Holy
[1:09:49] Ghost many many of
[1:09:53] them and they go through
[1:09:56] trials and heartache and they bring
[1:09:58] things into their marriage that they
[1:10:00] never should have because they never
[1:10:01] died to the old
[1:10:03] nature and now their their marriage has
[1:10:06] been scarred and they're coming for
[1:10:08] counseling and they're bringing things
[1:10:09] into their marriage to try to make it
[1:10:11] work because they were trying to satisfy
[1:10:15] a fleshly
[1:10:16] hunger with with some virtuous Act of
[1:10:19] marriage and it'll never
[1:10:21] suffice you'll have to get the victory
[1:10:24] over that thing of eventually so why not
[1:10:26] get it
[1:10:28] now that you can come into a union with
[1:10:31] your husband or your wife in total
[1:10:33] Victory not five or eight years down the
[1:10:36] road saying honey I didn't have what I
[1:10:38] thought I
[1:10:41] did oh he have an ear let him hear what
[1:10:44] the spirit is saying to the
[1:10:46] church it's Rapture time it's going home
[1:10:50] time it's time to get in order it's time
[1:10:52] to get our our life right
[1:10:56] has the father sent me so I send
[1:10:59] you well what does that look like it
[1:11:02] looks like the ability to take the
[1:11:04] word take the message of the
[1:11:07] hour things that are to
[1:11:12] be flashing red light so the sign of his
[1:11:14] coming the unveiling of God there's a
[1:11:17] man here that can turn on the light it
[1:11:18] is the rising of The Sun It's the Easter
[1:11:21] seal the Mighty God unveiled before us
[1:11:26] this
[1:11:27] day this scripture is
[1:11:30] fulfilled why can you say it for the
[1:11:32] spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:11:34] me he has anointed me to take the
[1:11:39] book he has anointed me to take the
[1:11:42] message of the hour and make it
[1:11:45] live I was
[1:11:48] predestinated I wasn't born back in the
[1:11:50] 40s and 50s and 60s because God had a
[1:11:52] purpose for me I'm in a place you right
[1:11:57] at the very end and just as the father
[1:12:00] sent me I'm going to send you I'm going
[1:12:04] to anoint you to take the book and eat
[1:12:08] it up thou must
[1:12:10] prophesy
[1:12:13] again you got to be anointed
[1:12:16] Church you got to have the fruits of the
[1:12:18] spirit you got to be walking in Victory
[1:12:21] we got to shake ourselves is that where
[1:12:23] you're living you see the life of the
[1:12:25] Prophet you see his ability in that
[1:12:27] prophetic minute to take the book to to
[1:12:29] reveal are we in a place where we know
[1:12:31] according to our position what hour as
[1:12:33] our Pro Pastor would say what hour are
[1:12:35] we living in where are we
[1:12:38] at what should we be manifesting in this
[1:12:43] hour prophet of God said his bride is
[1:12:46] the anointed one for this
[1:12:48] day I've been laboring out of the church
[1:12:51] age book how he said he did not complete
[1:12:53] all his work while in his Earthly
[1:12:54] Ministry so now he works in and through
[1:12:56] the bride she knows that for it was not
[1:12:59] yet time for him to do certain things
[1:13:01] that he must now do but he will now
[1:13:03] fulfill through the bride the work which
[1:13:04] he left for this specific time that's
[1:13:07] what I'm wanting just to minister on to
[1:13:09] you is that part of that bride's
[1:13:10] Ministry and and my subject is the
[1:13:12] spirit and the bride say
[1:13:15] come he said in John 1:12 he says but as
[1:13:19] many received him to them he gave power
[1:13:21] to become the sons of God even to them
[1:13:23] that believe on his name
[1:13:26] power to
[1:13:27] become all of the potential is there God
[1:13:31] put the seed in there with the
[1:13:32] potentials that it would be what he said
[1:13:34] it would be now we want to encourage you
[1:13:37] here a little bit see Satan hates that
[1:13:40] Satan hates the law of the seed he hates
[1:13:42] the spoken word is the Original
[1:13:44] Seed I imagine as he was sitting there
[1:13:47] and watching Adam and Eve
[1:13:50] go he's like I got
[1:13:52] in and all of a sudden he said wait
[1:13:57] I'll put
[1:13:58] enmity between thy
[1:14:01] seed between the serpent seed in the
[1:14:03] seat of the
[1:14:04] woman he knew oh no he spoke it he's
[1:14:09] been looking for that thing he thought
[1:14:11] he had it in
[1:14:13] Abel he he thought he had it in the
[1:14:17] prophets he thought he had him on
[1:14:22] Calvary he thought he finally got him
[1:14:24] when he stuck that Stinger into him said
[1:14:26] I finally got that
[1:14:29] one that was prophesied to bring the
[1:14:32] victory over my
[1:14:34] kingdom but what on the third
[1:14:37] day he rose
[1:14:40] again the mighty
[1:14:42] conqueror I want to ask you where is the
[1:14:44] mighty conqueror
[1:14:46] now where is
[1:14:50] he where is
[1:14:53] he it's Qui as Revival I've ever seen in
[1:14:55] my life it's okay you ain't got to be
[1:14:58] allowed to have a Revival I'm I'm
[1:14:59] thankful to
[1:15:01] that this ain't no public
[1:15:03] show that's why I can act crazy and I
[1:15:06] don't I can just do it by myself it
[1:15:07] don't matter I know where I came from
[1:15:09] and where I'm going I'm happy about you
[1:15:11] want to join in with me join in with me
[1:15:14] if you don't oh hey I mean it's okay
[1:15:17] it's all right I'll just look like a
[1:15:18] fool for my Jesus but you're going to
[1:15:20] look like a fool for somebody
[1:15:22] right you're going to dance out in the
[1:15:24] world and dress out in the world and do
[1:15:25] all these things out in the world and
[1:15:27] you're going to holler at the ball games
[1:15:28] and do all these things but when you're
[1:15:29] when you're a p of the greatest thing
[1:15:31] that ever happens you know we we seem to
[1:15:33] hold our peace but that's okay some of
[1:15:35] us just need to shake off them uh uh
[1:15:37] heavy bands and lift up those holy
[1:15:41] hands start living in Revival start
[1:15:44] recognizing the hour that we're now
[1:15:46] living in because all the potential is
[1:15:48] there and I want to say if Satan was
[1:15:51] trying to stop
[1:15:53] him but he couldn't
[1:15:57] and if he couldn't stop
[1:15:59] him can he stop
[1:16:03] you because you are that Original
[1:16:08] Seed and if he couldn't stop that
[1:16:10] Original Seed then where did you come
[1:16:13] from where do you came from the Original
[1:16:16] Seed the spoken word and nothing can
[1:16:19] defeat that word therefore he can't stop
[1:16:23] you Jesus would say say blessed are ye
[1:16:25] when men shall revile you and persecute
[1:16:27] you shall say all manner of evil against
[1:16:30] you falsely for my name's sake but
[1:16:31] rejoice and be exceedingly glad for
[1:16:34] great is your reward in heaven for so
[1:16:36] persecuted they the prophets which were
[1:16:38] before
[1:16:39] you look the devil can try to ruin your
[1:16:47] testimony and some of you feel like he
[1:16:51] has you feel like he got me he hit me
[1:16:56] and I can't recover this this blow is
[1:16:59] too much for me I'm going to bear this
[1:17:00] Mark the rest of my life he he got me
[1:17:05] I've fallen down I've been hurt I've
[1:17:06] been wounded I don't know how to bear
[1:17:09] this reproach before the church before
[1:17:11] my parents I don't know how I can live
[1:17:14] with this I've been
[1:17:16] wounded yes the Devil he's a good
[1:17:19] adversary he's there to take shots at
[1:17:22] you he's there to try to ruin your
[1:17:25] testimony but I got good news for you

[1:17:31] the only thing the devil can do can you
[1:17:34] hear me out there the only thing the
[1:17:38] devil can do is give you more to testify
[1:17:43] about hallelujah what the only thing the
[1:17:47] devil can do is to give you more to tell

[1:26:23] Church let's get in a Rapture condition
[1:26:25] right now let's say what the prophet
[1:26:28] said let's say what the spirit says and
[1:26:30] what they're saying has already been
[1:26:31] said in the word that we should be out
[1:26:33] there saying come out of her my people
[1:26:36] we should be inviting them to an Fe
[1:26:37] Feast we should be inviting them into
[1:26:39] the Rapture you know that's what this
[1:26:41] message is it's the
[1:26:42] Rapture there ain't no other Rapture
[1:26:45] this is it there's only one place you're
[1:26:48] going to be changed in a moment and a
[1:26:49] twinkling of an eye and that's in this
[1:26:51] message that's in this word he says
[1:26:55] and what they will say will have already
[1:26:57] been said in the word and they're saying
[1:26:58] it now come out from among her now and
[1:27:00] be ye separated the cry has gone out the
[1:27:02] cry is going out how long will the voice
[1:27:04] cry we do not know but one thing we do
[1:27:07] know it won't be long for this is the
[1:27:10] last
[1:27:11] age now I just want to focus on this
[1:27:13] before we
[1:27:14] close he says he will speak out and
[1:27:18] those who receive that prophet in his
[1:27:20] own name will receive the beneficient
[1:27:22] effect of the prophet
[1:27:34] Ministry now the prophet would pick that
[1:27:36] up in questions and answers when
[1:27:37] somebody's asking them to explain the
[1:27:39] prophet's reward he says well now
[1:27:42] Jesus whosoever receives a prophet in
[1:27:45] the name of a prophet receives a
[1:27:48] prophet's
[1:27:49] reward he goes on to say and if they
[1:27:52] want to know what a prophet's reward is
[1:27:55] is to be a friend to the prophet now I
[1:27:58] can't help but every time I read that I
[1:28:00] hear good evening
[1:28:05] friends and just as our Lord did in
[1:28:07] scripture he said I no longer call you
[1:28:11] servant I call you friend because the
[1:28:13] servant doesn't know what the master is
[1:28:16] doing but he Reveals His secret he
[1:28:19] reveals what he's doing to his friend oh
[1:28:22] let this mind be in you which was was
[1:28:24] also in Christ Jesus good evening

[1:28:29] which you are living I'm here to tell
[1:28:31] you what I'm doing I'm here to say the
[1:28:34] Lord himself has descended with a shout
[1:28:37] it is the message of the hour it is the
[1:28:39] bread of life Gathering Together the
[1:28:45] bride is to be a friend of the prophecy
[1:28:47] that's a reward he's your
[1:28:52] friend like that SHO it woman it might
[1:28:56] come in handy
[1:28:58] sometime it did for her see watch go it
[1:29:03] might come in handy sometime it did for
[1:29:06] I don't know what you have need of
[1:29:07] tonight but I want to ask are you a
[1:29:09] friend of this
[1:29:12] message come
[1:29:14] on are you a friend have you received
[1:29:17] this message in the name of the prophet
[1:29:20] in which it has
[1:29:21] come are or are you ashamed
[1:29:27] oh now here's the rub ah here's the
[1:29:30] rub it's easy to be friends with all of
[1:29:33] our Christian
[1:29:35] buddies and fellowship with them and oh
[1:29:39] Jesus saves in Jesus heals where's the
[1:29:44] reproach start talking about a prophet
[1:29:47] and put a name on
[1:29:49] it
[1:29:51] yeah because now the source is is
[1:29:55] identified and Satan hates that all hell
[1:29:59] fights against this
[1:30:01] Revelation because if somebody can come
[1:30:04] in contact with the
[1:30:06] source
[1:30:09] Hallelujah I don't know why it strikes
[1:30:11] me you know they they say uh uh G give a
[1:30:13] man a fish and and feed him for a day
[1:30:16] but teach him how to
[1:30:19] fish feed them for a lifetime look that
[1:30:22] that's that's fine you you can encourage
[1:30:24] somebody in the
[1:30:25] Lord you can you can maybe give them a
[1:30:28] quote but why don't you sit down and say
[1:30:29] I want to tell you something according
[1:30:32] to divine revelation the spirit and the
[1:30:35] bride say come I want to share with you
[1:30:38] according to Malachi 4:5 God I sent a
[1:30:41] Prophet by the name of William bradam
[1:30:43] and as the scripture says at the
[1:30:45] sounding of the seventh angel messenger
[1:30:48] when he begins to sound all the mystery
[1:30:51] of God shall be finished I not good news
[1:30:55] it's finished it's revealed the message
[1:30:58] has
[1:31:00] sounded good way to lose some
[1:31:06] friends but if you love
[1:31:09] them if you really love
[1:31:14] them H how how could you keep the
[1:31:17] greatest
[1:31:18] thing the world Christ the unveiling of
[1:31:22] God how could you not not give him the
[1:31:25] source that's right you know you know
[1:31:27] what does that a nielan spirit that
[1:31:29] wants to conquer the leoty that wants to
[1:31:32] keep it all for themselves I'll tell you
[1:31:34] what the prophet
[1:31:36] said I I'll no well what he meant I know
[1:31:40] but that was that was pre
[1:31:42] 63 see that was that was that was pre 63
[1:31:46] but if you come over here and questions
[1:31:48] and answers
[1:31:49] and why don't you just give them the
[1:31:52] message here you know what here's
[1:31:54] here's a here's a good book why don't
[1:31:58] you there's a man here that can turn on
[1:32:00] the light why don't you go listen to
[1:32:02] this and pray God reveal himself to
[1:32:05] you give them the
[1:32:07] source let them hear my sheep hear my
[1:32:10] voice and another they won't follow look
[1:32:13] you're predestin look if they're if they
[1:32:15] bride there's a special tuner in
[1:32:19] there you know they they got these you
[1:32:22] know they when you put in irrigation and
[1:32:24] things like that and electricians do the
[1:32:26] same thing but you have wires going
[1:32:28] everywhere but you can put a little
[1:32:30] honer thing on the end of that wire and
[1:32:33] that wire is going under the buildings
[1:32:34] and it's going under the parking lot and
[1:32:36] everything but then you get a little
[1:32:37] tuner and you start trying to find where
[1:32:39] that source is and some people have been
[1:32:42] walking their old lives I wonder I
[1:32:44] wonder where it is and there got to be
[1:32:47] something more than this I've gone to
[1:32:49] this church I've gone to that church and
[1:32:52] then you come around and you say they
[1:32:53] see the way they you live and everything
[1:32:55] like beep beep beep beep like God that
[1:32:57] sounds
[1:32:58] familiar maybe you share you share with
[1:33:00] them water baptism and you beep beep
[1:33:03] beep beep that sounds pretty good but
[1:33:06] why don't you just set put it in their
[1:33:08] hand beep this is what I've been looking
[1:33:11] for all my
[1:33:13] life this is my Revival I had a good
[1:33:16] time in that church I had a good time of
[1:33:18] there but when I come into the light if
[1:33:21] you walk in the light as he is in the
[1:33:23] light we shall have Fellowship one with
[1:33:25] another and the blood of Christ shall
[1:33:27] cleanse you from all your
[1:33:29] sins might as well read it while I'm
[1:33:31] holding
[1:33:32] it then if we are walking in the
[1:33:35] god-given light I love it when he does
[1:33:36] stuff like that then if we are walking
[1:33:38] in the god-given light of the hour then
[1:33:40] God takes that word that's given for the
[1:33:43] hour and vindicates it just like he did
[1:33:46] in Genesis 1:3 let there be
[1:33:49] light and light came forth his word went
[1:33:53] forth and the light followed it and
[1:33:55] cleared away the midst and the Darkness
[1:33:58] went to one corner and the light shined
[1:34:00] on the other side if you want Darkness
[1:34:03] to be chased out of your life I got the
[1:34:06] answer come let him that's a thirst
[1:34:12] come you want a prophet's reward it
[1:34:14] might come in handy sometime let the
[1:34:16] musicians

[1:34:38] Revival this is the brid's Revival this
[1:34:41] is not an intellectual Revival you can
[1:34:44] talk me in one day and out the
[1:34:47] other I can be on the highest
[1:34:49] Mountaintop I'm in Revival I can be in
[1:34:52] the lowest lowest valy of my life and

[1:35:12] Revival I am the message of the
[1:35:15] hour am you can no longer you can no
[1:35:19] more stop me than you can stop God
[1:35:22] because greater is he
[1:35:24] amen that is in
[1:35:26] you than he that is in the
[1:35:29] world
[1:35:32] hallelujah oh praise His wonderful
[1:35:35] name that's the way God does today he
[1:35:39] sends his word for this
[1:35:41] hour and the Holy Spirit comes and makes
[1:35:44] the word
[1:35:45] live and the Darkness goes on to their
[1:35:48] Creeds and denomination but light shines
[1:35:51] because it's the word of God being
[1:35:52] Vindicated
[1:35:54] that his word is
[1:35:56] true oh hallelujah what do you have need
[1:36:00] of I want to tell you there's a fountain
[1:36:02] open in the House of
[1:36:05] David we got needs represented amongst
[1:36:09] us oh
[1:36:11] my well I tell you what this message
[1:36:13] comes in handy it did for the shemite
[1:36:16] woman God had given her
[1:36:20] something so she went back to the
[1:36:22] source if you ain't living in Victory go
[1:36:25] back to the
[1:36:26] source if you ain't living overcoming
[1:36:29] life go back to the source if you're not
[1:36:31] living in Revival go back to the source
[1:36:34] come back to the
[1:36:35] word come are you
[1:36:39] thirsty come and
[1:36:41] drink prophet of God said it takes the
[1:36:43] spirit of
[1:36:44] God to bring
[1:36:47] life and that life must not come out of
[1:36:50] just the intellectual Revival it gots to
[1:36:53] come out of the Bible word Revival and
[1:36:57] that word is the same yesterday today
[1:37:01] and forever and when it falls today and
[1:37:05] quickens you get the same results you
[1:37:08] did in Acts two exactly it always has
[1:37:11] and always will because it's the spirit
[1:37:14] of God that conditions the
[1:37:16] atmosphere oh people get so confused how
[1:37:19] the prophet is trying to lead the church
[1:37:22] out of
[1:37:24] the Revival that was ushered in by the
[1:37:26] restoration of the gifts and when he
[1:37:28] stands there says look the Revival's
[1:37:30] over it's dead that won't happen no more
[1:37:33] he's not doing away with your Revival
[1:37:37] he's getting your eyes off an age
[1:37:40] Revival that's gone by look every age
[1:37:43] had a Revival every generation has a
[1:37:45] chance at the word but he's standing
[1:37:48] there telling the people stop looking
[1:37:50] for something in an age that has gone by
[1:37:53] everybody's crying fast pray fast pray
[1:37:56] for Revival and the very thing you're
[1:37:58] praying for the very thing you're
[1:37:59] looking for is right here in the
[1:38:02] building Christ is here the Mighty God
[1:38:05] unveiled before you what do you have
[1:38:07] need of this message is here there's a
[1:38:09] man here that could turn on the light
[1:38:12] the Lord himself shall descend he is
[1:38:16] here with an open book what do you have
[1:38:18] need of come to the Fountain the spirit
[1:38:20] of the Bride say come am amen you need
[1:38:26] healing there's healing
[1:38:28] here oh it takes the spirit of
[1:38:32] God play something
[1:38:34] sister it takes the spirit of God to
[1:38:36] bring
[1:38:37] life and that life must not come out of
[1:38:40] just an intellectual Revival it got to
[1:38:42] come out of the Bible word Revival and
[1:38:44] the word is the same yesterday today and
[1:38:47] forever and when it falls
[1:38:49] today and quickens you get the same
[1:38:52] results as did in Acts two
[1:38:54] exactly it always has it always will be
[1:38:56] because it's the spirit of God that
[1:38:58] conditions the
[1:38:59] atmosphere it takes atmosphere to do
[1:39:02] things that's the reason you men are
[1:39:05] always taught bring your children here
[1:39:09] well certainly that's right I'm glad to
[1:39:11] see my daughter Rebecca come in and sit
[1:39:13] down just a few minutes ago some of you
[1:39:16] you seen me wink at a woman it was my
[1:39:18] daughter so she come in and sat down I
[1:39:21] want her to receive the baptism of the
[1:39:24] spirit and that's why she is here in the
[1:39:26] meeting you mean we go to meetings to
[1:39:28] get the Holy
[1:39:32] Ghost did you see
[1:39:34] that what are we here for
[1:39:37] church we create an atmosphere we preach
[1:39:40] the unadulterated word it takes
[1:39:43] atmosphere to do
[1:39:47] things but the atmosphere is not your
[1:39:50] absolute the atmosphere is not your
[1:39:53] attra action it's the revealed word of
[1:39:56] the hour that we must be anchored in
[1:40:00] because our feelings and our emotions
[1:40:02] and the atmospheres will change but one
[1:40:04] thing that will never change is that
[1:40:07] thus saith the
[1:40:10] Lord
