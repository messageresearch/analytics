[32:44] Lord, give us a clean heart tonight. Oh
[32:49] God,
[32:52] oh and you arise,
[32:57] spirit
[32:58] within you.
[33:07] Create
[33:09] me.
[33:10] [Music]
[33:17] Oh
[33:19] God,
[33:24] and renew a right spirit
[33:29] within me. Cast me not away.
[33:38] Cast me not
[33:42] away
[33:44] from thy presence,
[33:49] oh Lord.
[33:54] Take not thy holy spirit
[34:00] from me.
[34:06] our restore
[34:15] Lord the joy
[34:18] of thy
[34:20] salvation
[34:22] [Music]
[34:25] and renew a right spirit
[34:30] within.
[34:31] [Music]
[34:33] Let's just go before him. Heavenly
[34:35] Father, Lord, we know the song that
[34:38] David would sing, Father, is a heart's
[34:41] cry of every believer, Lord, to be
[34:44] renewed and restored in your presence,
[34:46] Father, to always be found in your
[34:48] house, Lord. We'd rather be adorment in
[34:51] the house of God. And Lord, there's no
[34:53] other place that our hearts desire is to
[34:56] be than to be found in your presence.
[34:58] And Lord, we're so thankful that you
[35:00] desire, Lord, to draw us unto yourself.
[35:02] And Lord, that you provided a way that
[35:05] we could come. We're approaching now,
[35:07] Lord, in the acceptable place in thy
[35:10] son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, that
[35:13] all of our sins being forgiven, Father,
[35:15] you've provided a place of worship. And
[35:18] Lord, in this day, you've given us a
[35:20] truth. And Lord, we know who you are.
[35:22] And you've opened our eyes that we're
[35:23] blinded. And Lord, we've been now
[35:26] gathered around the body word, a
[35:28] bleeding, bloody word, Father. And Lord,
[35:31] it's producing exactly what you sent it
[35:33] to produce. And we want to thank you for
[35:35] that, Lord. We believe it's that word
[35:37] that has what we have need of. That's
[35:39] why we've gathered here, Lord. That your
[35:40] word would come. It would heal our
[35:42] diseases. That it would shape us into
[35:44] your son's image, Father. And Lord, if
[35:47] we could be more pleasing to you. So we
[35:50] commit this service to you, Father, that
[35:52] you would do by your word what you
[35:54] intend to perform. Commit this service
[35:56] to you in the precious name of our Lord
[35:58] and Savior Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen.
[36:01] While you're standing with me, if you
[36:03] turn in your Bibles to the book of
[36:04] Revelations, we're going to take a
[36:07] reading out of chapter 3, very familiar
[36:09] for our day. In verse 17 it reads,
[36:13] "Because thou sayest, I am rich and
[36:16] increased with goods, and have need of
[36:18] nothing, and knowest not that thou art
[36:20] wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
[36:22] blind and naked, I counsel thee to buy
[36:25] of me gold tried in fire, that thou
[36:27] mayest be rich, and with ramnant, and
[36:30] white remnant, that thou mayest be
[36:32] clothed, and that thy shame of thy
[36:34] nakedness do not appear. and anoint
[36:38] thine eyes with eyes that thou mayest
[36:40] see. As many as I love, I rebuke and
[36:44] chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent.
[36:47] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[36:49] If any man hear my voice and open the
[36:51] door, I will come into him and will s
[36:54] with him and he with me. To him that
[36:56] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[36:59] in my throne, even as I also overcome,
[37:02] and am sat down with my father in his
[37:05] throne. He that hath an ear, let him
[37:08] hear what the spirit saith to the
[37:10] churches. Heavenly Father, as we've read
[37:12] your word, we ask that you would
[37:13] multiply it to us. Father, in your name
[37:15] we pray. Amen. You can be seated.
[37:19] Just continuing on the thought this
[37:21] morning. I I really uh much was en
[37:23] enjoyed and was blessed by the service.
[37:26] Uh it just as a thought to carry that
[37:28] forward, I want to speak on identified
[37:30] by desire and the fruit of desperation.
[37:34] So just in that reading of what we took
[37:36] from the lady church age I the word need
[37:40] I would say is also tatamount to desire.
[37:43] If you need something you're desiring
[37:45] after it. I have need of this. I need
[37:48] it. I desire after it. I need a drink of
[37:50] water. Uh whatever a lacking would be
[37:52] would also be associated with a desire.
[37:55] And what we find in in this day there's
[37:58] a people who would say they have no
[37:59] desire for anything that really that
[38:02] which they have need of. So there's a
[38:04] there's an identification by a lack of
[38:07] desire. Uh and we don't want to be the
[38:10] ones who are saying we have need of
[38:12] nothing. We have no desire for nothing.
[38:14] Our bellies are full. We are fat.
[38:16] There's no desperation. There's no
[38:17] crying for more. But we want to be the
[38:20] ones that are found as having the need
[38:22] of his righteousness that we would be
[38:24] clothed in white ranant that we'd
[38:26] receive is that we could see. And I
[38:29] believe that's the, if you will, the
[38:32] passing from death unto life is when you
[38:34] recognize that you've received what you
[38:38] have need of.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; So there's going to be a contrast. I
[38:41] believe that's the paradox really in any
[38:43] time is there's a point at which you
[38:46] pass from death unto life.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; But there is a you can't um equate
[38:52] I think it's really hard I guess just to
[38:54] really say it simply. You can't
[38:56] understand the kingdom of heaven unless
[38:57] you've been born again.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; So you would you would think that it's
[39:00] something that you could wrestle with
[39:02] intellectually, obtain carnally, but
[39:04] it's not something that you can do for
[39:06] yourself. You have to be completely
[39:08] dependent on him. He's the one who has
[39:10] to come and open your eyes. Um I I find
[39:14] that really the word of God has
[39:17] everything that we have need of. It is
[39:19] your identification.
[39:21] So when you look into the word of God as
[39:23] a son of God, there's a cry in your
[39:25] heart that that wants to produce
[39:28] everything that the word of God told you
[39:30] that it could produce. It's not going to
[39:32] be satisfied by anything less. So when
[39:35] Jesus says, "Be ye perfect as your
[39:37] father which is in heaven is perfect."
[39:39] That's going to cause a desire in your
[39:41] heart, a desperation, a call that
[39:44] requires perfection.
[39:46] But there's an enemy
[39:49] &gt;&gt; that wants to take that desire and get
[39:52] you to settle for anything less
[39:55] &gt;&gt; because that's the carnal mind.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; It will take the things of God and the
[39:59] promises of God and get give you a plan
[40:02] or an idea on how to achieve them.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; If I mean let's the book of Genesis the
[40:07] reason the devil hates it is it exposes
[40:10] him. In the very beginning, Eve had a
[40:12] promise.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; And what Satan did was come to her and
[40:15] propose a way for her to obtain the
[40:18] promise
[40:19] &gt;&gt; that was not God's provided way.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; And that t that tactic has not changed.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; It's still the same. Man wants something
[40:29] to do with it. in even in our own
[40:31] abilities we are going to be faced with
[40:34] that uh if you will tendency
[40:38] &gt;&gt; in and of ourselves we look for at first
[40:42] first thing is what can I do about it
[40:44] &gt;&gt; what can I do
[40:46] &gt;&gt; and that's kind of the paradox is we can
[40:48] do nothing
[40:51] &gt;&gt; you know the uh the thing that we
[40:54] recognize is that there and I want to
[40:56] clarify something there's a difference
[40:58] between desire
[41:00] and temptation.
[41:02] Okay? When you've been born again, the
[41:05] very heart desire in you has been
[41:07] changed.
[41:09] You your you your your heart is now set
[41:12] upon the heavenly.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; You can now say that the things I used
[41:16] to
[41:18] desire after I count as dung. They no
[41:21] longer mean anything to me. But I can
[41:23] still be tempted. But temptation is from
[41:26] without. I can definitely recognize that
[41:28] it's no longer in my heart to do those
[41:30] things. So you have to discern that
[41:34] which is without and that which is
[41:36] within. If it's not that with is without
[41:39] that defileleth a man, but that which is
[41:41] within.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; So you in probing and seeking out your
[41:44] own salvation with fear and trembling
[41:46] has to discern what is in your heart.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; So I'm speaking on being identified by
[41:53] your desire.
[41:55] So you find it within yourself a nature,
[41:57] a law that when you would do good, evil
[42:00] is present with you.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; But there's a seed gene of God in you
[42:05] that desires the things of God, that
[42:07] desires something further in the kingdom
[42:10] of heaven. Jesus would even pray on
[42:13] earth as it is in heaven.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; And even in our reading, Jesus said, "As
[42:18] I have overcome and is set in my
[42:21] father's throne, it is given to you to
[42:22] overcome." It's Jesus Christ the same
[42:25] yesterday, today, and forever. I do not
[42:29] believe that there was nothing. I I I
[42:31] don't believe that Jesus Christ fell to
[42:33] anything.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Okay? I want to establish that right
[42:36] now. Jesus Christ did not live a partial
[42:38] victory. He didn't come to show that we
[42:41] could only go so far in this flesh.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't come to, you know, to say
[42:45] you're going to always going to have to
[42:46] cope. But I'm crucified with him at
[42:49] Calvary and I've resurrected with him
[42:52] &gt;&gt; now.
[42:54] The life that I live, I now live by the
[42:57] blood of Jesus Christ, by the life of
[42:59] Jesus Christ. I'm not uh living the life
[43:03] of David McGee. Now, that's a paradox
[43:05] &gt;&gt; because that the guy who seems to wake
[43:07] up in the morning,
[43:09] &gt;&gt; okay? And you see that and I see that.
[43:12] But I'm here to declare when heavens and
[43:15] earth pass away, the real me is going to
[43:17] be here.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to be the faults. It
[43:23] ain't going to be the failures. It ain't
[43:24] going to be the doubting. It ain't going
[43:25] to be anything less than the word of
[43:27] God.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; And it is the word of God that has been
[43:30] swn in us.
[43:35] You know the uh
[43:39] the end time believer is given to
[43:42] manifest the fullness.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; So
[43:47] you you got to embrace that desperation.
[43:53] You have to understand that that travail
[43:55] is intended for a purpose. We have to be
[43:58] sincere.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; We have to recognize that the
[44:01] desperation to manifest perfection is of
[44:04] God.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; It's because it's a promise.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; It's because it's our inheritance.
[44:10] And it's not necessarily going to come
[44:12] easy.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; But it's a victory.
[44:17] I it's it's it's
[44:23] what was it? It was it was a given in
[44:25] this day that there there would be a
[44:26] people that would have a form of
[44:27] godliness but deny the power thereof.
[44:30] So in and uh power apart from character
[44:34] is satanic.
[44:36] So this is a common phrase. It's it's
[44:39] actually pretty good. It's a scriptural
[44:40] understanding. But knowledge is power.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. So God even being omnipotent,
[44:46] omnipresent, an attribute of power is to
[44:48] know all things. It's a powerful thing.
[44:50] So when you increase with knowledge,
[44:53] but you don't have the character,
[44:56] &gt;&gt; it becomes something where truth can be
[45:00] carried in unrighteousness.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; But there's the character of Christ that
[45:05] comes by the spirit of God.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is still the answer. Yes,
[45:12] it is.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; It is the life of Christ that allows us
[45:15] to overcome.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; It's not just in an understanding of who
[45:18] we are. It's not just in an I loved it
[45:21] when brother Billy and brother Matthew
[45:23] went down the same line. There has to be
[45:24] a desire for connection.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; We are drawn to him by some a bond
[45:31] that's unbreakable.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; He desired you before the foundation of
[45:35] the world. You're not getting away from
[45:37] it.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; So, it's got to have its work.
[45:41] He's drawing you unto himself. And what
[45:44] has to happen is you're drawing into the
[45:46] presence of the sun. It's melting away
[45:48] everything that cannot stand in his
[45:50] presence. The baking out of the
[45:52] greenness
[45:54] sometimes makes you think that you're
[45:56] unworthy.
[45:57] It causes little things to be magnified.
[46:00] But what is he doing? He's drawing you
[46:03] unto himself.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; He's perfecting you. He's creating in
[46:07] you the identity.
[46:09] So what you're identified by is your
[46:12] desire.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Because you're going to follow after it.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; You know, we would call it maybe
[46:19] sometimes a discipline. A lot of people
[46:22] they they do a discipline. We were going
[46:25] I you know, I try to work on my
[46:26] discipline. I don't have very much
[46:28] discipline. There's people who have
[46:30] professions that it requires a
[46:32] discipline. they're disciplined in it,
[46:34] especially with around the things of
[46:36] sports or anything that's a of a of a
[46:39] natural ability. It it it becomes a
[46:41] discipline that encompasses all aspects
[46:44] of your life, diet, you know, they got
[46:47] regiments and it becomes a very much a
[46:49] discipline and something that shows
[46:52] where your desire is at because you're
[46:56] pursuing after a goal. And the reason we
[46:59] took the scripture reading we did is
[47:01] it's given to us to sit with him in his
[47:04] throne.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; We have to keep the goal in mind.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; What is it going to take to sit with him
[47:11] in his throne?
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Character.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; It has to be character fit to rule.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; That's the prize that's set before us.
[47:19] So we should we should understand that
[47:21] it through this world that in the time
[47:24] that we're here God is going to be
[47:26] perfecting us. Just to read as it to
[47:29] grab an inspiration Matthew chapter 6
[47:32] verses 9 through 12 after this manner
[47:34] therefore pray ye our father which art
[47:37] in heaven hallowed be thy name thy
[47:39] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[47:42] as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
[47:45] daily bread and forgive us as our de our
[47:48] debts as we forgive our debtors. As we
[47:51] said, the the very proclamation of what
[47:53] we should be praying for is the
[47:55] manifestation on earth as it is in
[47:58] heaven.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; If we can catch the heavenly vision,
[48:02] &gt;&gt; if we can understand what's there, then
[48:04] we have the right to cast down the
[48:07] things that are here. And I I'll ask you
[48:09] this. How do I know the kingdom of
[48:11] heaven? I know because it's within me.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; I have no doubt to that which I've
[48:16] obtained. I've been I've been touched by
[48:19] his fire.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; I know whom I believed in. I've
[48:23] encountered God. I'm not questioning
[48:25] anymore if God's real. And I know that
[48:28] he identified me as a son. And that
[48:30] experience is for everybody.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; It was not David McGary Jr. that was
[48:36] worthy to come into his presence, but he
[48:38] sought me out
[48:40] &gt;&gt; and he touched me. And he marked me and
[48:42] he identified himself with me.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Oh saints, it becomes such a reality to
[48:47] me. The identity he took in my shame
[48:52] &gt;&gt; in all my failure. He identified himself
[48:55] with me.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; When he hung there on the cross, he took
[48:58] all my shame.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Before I could be identified with him,
[49:06] &gt;&gt; he identified himself with me.
[49:09] Yes.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; When that becomes a reality,
[49:15] &gt;&gt; it per it generates a love in your life
[49:17] for him
[49:19] &gt;&gt; that doesn't want to do anything that
[49:21] would bring a reproach to him putting
[49:24] his name on you
[49:26] &gt;&gt; and I so many times fell.
[49:32] But that should be the love response for
[49:34] what he did for you is God, hold me by
[49:38] your mercy and grace.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; I'm no better than anyone.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Unless you keep me, I'll fall.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; I don't you there's a there's too many
[49:47] vessels of dishonor, Lord.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; By your grace, raise me up, Father.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; We don't We don't need any more vessels
[49:55] of dishonor.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; We need real vessels
[49:59] &gt;&gt; to his glory.
[50:04] You know the the thing that we are is
[50:06] it's it's spoken of in Romans 8 verse 9
[50:09] is the text that even brother Ben was
[50:12] taking. But ye are not in the flesh
[50:15] &gt;&gt; but in the spirit.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; If so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[50:21] you. Now if any man have not the spirit
[50:24] of Christ, he is none of his.
[50:27] Everything that we are, everything that
[50:30] we are is in Christ Jesus.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; And it is the spirit of God that dwells
[50:37] in us.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; And everything contrary to that we cast
[50:42] down.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; We do not accept anything less than
[50:46] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[50:48] and forever. So I tell you that what is
[50:51] in you
[50:52] &gt;&gt; is the same life that was in Jesus
[50:54] Christ.
[50:56] Not a partial victory,
[50:59] &gt;&gt; but you have the right to every victory
[51:01] he possessed.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Every victory. Not a partial victory.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; It was a victory that allowed him to lay
[51:10] his life down and raise it up again.
[51:16] There has to be a desperation to possess
[51:18] all the things that God has for us. God
[51:21] has put the thirst there to to draw us
[51:25] to the place that the supernatural
[51:28] transpires.
[51:31] If you have not had your soul changed,
[51:36] if you and maybe that's a brought to
[51:39] life to be quickened to have a
[51:41] revelation of really what your soul
[51:42] possesses,
[51:44] &gt;&gt; it takes the quickening power of God to
[51:46] do so.
[51:48] The way God works in the is simply faith
[51:50] cometh by hearing. Hearing by the word
[51:53] of God there by looking at our example
[51:55] of Christ Jesus. It should cause us to
[51:58] say that's what I want to be. That's the
[52:01] image that's set before me. I'm desiring
[52:03] after it. I want to be like Jesus. And
[52:06] that's the very thing that
[52:09] should be living in our brothers and
[52:10] sisters around us.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; I want my life to be salty.
[52:17] Just to take a a in this presuming
[52:22] preaching 620117
[52:31] starting uh 3:19.
[52:35] So it's the life that counts.
[52:39] It's by the fruit you're known. If you
[52:42] see that you're it isn't tallying up.
[52:44] Would you like to be a real Christian?
[52:47] And now I want you with your heads, eyes
[52:49] closed, and praying. If you will, I want
[52:51] you to be real honest. Now, just now, be
[52:54] real honest. Sin cannot be covered by
[52:57] drinking, by casting it aside, by
[52:59] joining a church, by trying to do
[53:02] better. Sin can only be killed by the
[53:05] power of God, the blood of Jesus Christ.
[53:08] Wouldn't you want a life like that if
[53:10] you would? and you're you believe God is
[53:14] in the building. His never-failing
[53:15] presence is always near, no matter where
[53:17] you are. A vision the other morning told
[53:20] me that he said, "Do not fear. Stand up
[53:22] boldly." See, because the neverfelling
[53:25] presence of Christ is near. Would you
[53:27] want to be that type of a Christian?
[53:30] Like you really know you should be.
[53:32] You're really trying to be, but you
[53:34] haven't reached that place yet. Now your
[53:36] own life proves it. Raise up your hands
[53:39] to God. God bless you. That's honest,
[53:42] sincere hearts. I really want to be.
[53:45] Now, if you have, you know, your life
[53:47] that you're tallying up what a Christian
[53:50] is required to do, then even now in the
[53:52] presence of the Holy Spirit, Satan makes
[53:54] you keep your hand down, won't receive
[53:57] it. Now, what about that? When you know
[54:00] you're right here with the scriptures
[54:02] that you're wrong, I say that in love.
[54:07] What a horrible thing that it is. see
[54:10] that you would know that. I don't say
[54:12] that you are, but I say if you would
[54:14] know it and know that your life, look at
[54:17] what you do and the things that you're
[54:19] acting in your life doesn't compare to
[54:20] the Bible and you hear the gospel is
[54:22] preached and you read it yourself and
[54:25] you know it's wrong to do these things
[54:27] and yet you do it. Isn't that horrible?
[54:30] Now at least 20 30 hands up went out.
[54:34] Would you like now? Don't nobody look.
[54:36] Just let me look. I want to pray. Some
[54:38] was left out. We'd put your hand. I will
[54:41] see you in the balcony. Yes. God bless
[54:43] you. There's plenty more. God, it really
[54:45] sincere. Why don't we settle it tonight?
[54:49] Just why not just say tonight, let's
[54:51] settle it. Now, come in among you out
[54:54] here at Phoenix, the lovely place.
[54:56] Appreciate you so much. Letters, write,
[54:58] encouragement, things. Try encourage me
[55:00] and pray for me. And the reason I got I
[55:02] want to sincere Christ going to make an
[55:05] answer for this. Sorry, just getting to
[55:07] this. I don't tell you all the truth.
[55:10] Then see, I'm going to have to answer.
[55:13] And what's the reason? I want I want you
[55:16] to be there, brother, sister. Don't take
[55:18] a chance. The slightest chance. Don't
[55:22] take it. Don't just play with it. We
[55:25] don't Let's be real. Real Christians.
[55:31] You can be, too.
[55:34] You know a certain lady that you'd like
[55:36] to be like, a certain man you'd like to
[55:39] be like, a certain minister you'd like
[55:41] to be like, a certain person you want to
[55:43] be that way, you can be, let's believe
[55:47] it with all our hearts.
[55:49] There has to be an example lived out and
[55:51] waved out over the people.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; You know what is it? what it when you
[55:55] recognize potential, when you recognize
[55:58] something that could be obtained. And I
[56:00] trust that in our day, we know what can
[56:02] be obtained. We've had a sheathwave
[56:04] offering, a a a speak to the storm
[56:07] ministry, a create the squirrels, a son
[56:10] of God coming into position and
[56:12] authority. We have example lived before
[56:14] us that we can desire after that we
[56:17] could say, "Lord, as you as he followed
[56:19] Christ, I want all of it. I want all of
[56:21] it for me in this day." A a child does
[56:25] that tendency quite easy.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; We could even do it naively. When we see
[56:30] someone else has the ability to do it,
[56:32] competitive nature tells us there's
[56:34] potential for me to do it.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; There should be a godly attribute that
[56:39] in us says that's for me.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to pursue after. I want that.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; That's for me.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let anybody sell you short.
[56:52] It is not for me to say to quench your
[56:54] thirst.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; It is not for me. You've got it,
[56:57] brother. You've arrived. If God's
[56:58] calling you further, go further.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; There's more for you to have.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; We are fools to compare ourselves one to
[57:06] another.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; The only thing that you're responsible
[57:10] for is he calls and leads you, you
[57:12] follow after it.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; He's faithful.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; If he's put a desire in there for more,
[57:18] there's more for you to have. Amen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; It is not my measure of spirituality
[57:25] that you need to achieve.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Now, if I'm leading and I'm an example,
[57:30] praise God. But, you know, let's pray
[57:33] frogger a little bit. You get out ahead
[57:34] and then I'll and I'll catch up.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; But let let's charge.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Let's go find all the promises he has
[57:41] for us. Let's lift one another up. Let's
[57:44] be the examples. Let's say we can do
[57:46] this, brother. I've got the victory.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Not You know,
[57:54] &gt;&gt; we're flawed.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Nonsense.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I I victim mentality
[58:06] &gt;&gt; is not what we have in this day.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Away with it.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; We're not just all the broken sistns,
[58:15] &gt;&gt; the wounded vessels,
[58:17] wounded warriors for Jesus.
[58:22] That's not what our claim is.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; He's the Lord God that health all my
[58:26] diseases. When I was lost and undone, he
[58:28] found me. Now that I've tasted of the
[58:31] heavenly, I got something to give. Let
[58:34] me tell you, the one who heals a broken
[58:36] heart that can take you from nothing and
[58:38] and bring you up. There is no place that
[58:41] my God can't bring you from.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; You may think you're lost and he doesn't
[58:45] know where you're at. He knows exactly
[58:46] where you're at.
[58:51] The love of Jesus Christ is the greatest
[58:53] power this world has ever known.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; And if you I I believe that if you could
[58:59] but taste it.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Whatever you think is too great becomes
[59:05] nothing.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; The things that I thought were unfixable
[59:09] one moment in his presence were gone.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Gone. Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; And that's Jesus Christ the same
[59:16] yesterday, today, and forever.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; And no man who enters into the presence
[59:21] of God recognizes
[59:26] there ain't no worthiness in you.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Try to tell me that a kid who grows up
[59:31] on a pew doesn't have anything to repent
[59:33] of.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; You've got a righteousness that you're
[59:36] bringing to God.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; You haven't been in his presence.
[59:44] You show me in the scripture where
[59:46] anybody's encountered God and they said,
[59:48] "Well, that was nothing.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; I guess I was good."
[59:54] Even the rich young ruler at least had
[59:56] to repent of heart.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; You don't come into the presence of God
[1:00:03] and and think that you got it.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; You recognize that without him, you're
[1:00:10] lost.
[1:00:11] that he has everything that you have
[1:00:13] need of.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; That that's the salvation that would
[1:00:17] write the verse. It was grace that
[1:00:19] taught my heart to fear and grace my
[1:00:22] heart my fears relieved.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; How precious that hour, it's that
[1:00:28] transformation. It's the guilt. It's the
[1:00:32] sin. It's the burden that makes you the
[1:00:34] candidate for a savior. That's right.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; If there's no burden and there's
[1:00:40] travail,
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; I have need of nothing. I'm good. I
[1:00:44] understand all the mysteries.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; I understand the message. I know what
[1:00:50] God's done in this day. I've
[1:00:53] intellectually obtained it.
[1:00:58] And what do you become? A rich young
[1:00:59] ruler
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; that wasn't willing to just go just to
[1:01:03] die. Whatever it is, I guarantee you
[1:01:06] he's calling you further.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; If it's sell all that thou hast,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; learn how to die.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Be zealous, therefore, and repent.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I I
[1:01:23] don't want to leave any behind.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; I recognize that there's those who
[1:01:28] understand that they've passed from
[1:01:29] death into life. We're not trying to
[1:01:31] crucify Christ. Aresh. If you pass from
[1:01:34] death unto life, I understand that. But
[1:01:35] you know what it's like to repent.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; You know what it's like to die.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; You know what it's like to to have him
[1:01:43] come and be the lifegiver.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; But don't think there's another gospel.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Like the gospel somehow changed now that
[1:01:51] we've got all the mysteries open. It's a
[1:01:53] different gospel. You just don't have
[1:01:55] anything to repent of.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; It's not a different gospel.
[1:02:01] Repentance is still the the ingredients
[1:02:04] hasn't changed.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; The formula is repent.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:02:09] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[1:02:11] gift of the Holy Ghost. That's Jesus
[1:02:13] Christ the same yesterday, today and
[1:02:15] forever. There's no uncertainty in it.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; There's there's no other formula.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; And it starts with repentance, you know,
[1:02:25] and I it takes a revelation to repent.
[1:02:29] That's right.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; It takes a revelation to repent. You
[1:02:32] can't come to repentance unless he
[1:02:34] reveals to you your frame.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you think it's a checklist.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I stole the gum from Piggly Wiggly
[1:02:41] and my mom caught me. Chick. I'm sorry,
[1:02:43] Lord. And I've been a pretty good guy
[1:02:46] otherwise. So now you can receive me and
[1:02:48] you can accept me and I have something
[1:02:50] to bring. I could really be beneficial
[1:02:51] in your kingdom. What would you like me
[1:02:53] to do?
[1:02:55] I could pass out tracks. I could
[1:02:57] probably get people. I can compel them
[1:02:59] to come in. We can do things that we and
[1:03:01] then what are you just doing? You've
[1:03:03] you've accepted the religious covering.
[1:03:04] You've become a cane.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; You are now approaching him through your
[1:03:08] works, through your own worthiness.
[1:03:10] You're you're approaching him through
[1:03:12] knowledge.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; And your approach is to die to your own
[1:03:16] understanding.
[1:03:19] It's hard to die.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; The travail of death. And you know what?
[1:03:24] It's from glory to glory. I'm not going
[1:03:26] to despise God's program. If I have to
[1:03:30] go through a place of desperation for
[1:03:32] him to bring me a revelation, then Lord,
[1:03:34] I want to be on your threshing floor. I
[1:03:37] want to be on the potter's will. I want
[1:03:40] to be in the place where he's molding
[1:03:41] and making my character. I don't want to
[1:03:43] despise the desperation.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Whatever he sees fit in my life to bring
[1:03:48] to pass, to mold me into him, his image,
[1:03:51] to make it so I could sit in the throne.
[1:03:53] I'm going to keep the prize before me.
[1:03:55] I'm going to recognize the goal. What is
[1:03:57] he making? He's he's he's making a
[1:03:59] character to sit with him in his throne.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And people may look at that process and
[1:04:04] think it's failure.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; But if I know the goal
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; and I know what he's doing,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; then it brings a victory amidst the
[1:04:14] storm.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; It ain't a failure. It's a trophy.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful in his sight.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:23] It's the work of his hands. So many
[1:04:25] times what man has measured as failure
[1:04:28] is God's successes.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; What man looks at and despises is is
[1:04:34] God's trophies.
[1:04:39] Galatians
[1:04:42] chapter 1 verse 6.
[1:04:46] I marvel that ye are so soon removed
[1:04:48] from him that called you under the grace
[1:04:49] of Christ unto another gospel, which is
[1:04:52] not another. It's not another gospel.
[1:04:55] But there are some that trouble you and
[1:04:57] would pervert the gospel of Christ.
[1:05:00] But though we or an angel from heaven
[1:05:02] preach any other gospel other than that
[1:05:04] which was preached unto you, let him be
[1:05:06] accursed. As we said before, so say I
[1:05:09] again, if any man preached unto you any
[1:05:11] other gospel that ye have received, let
[1:05:14] him be accursed. For I do now persuade,
[1:05:18] for do I now persuade men or God? Do I
[1:05:23] seek to please men? For if yet please
[1:05:26] men, I should not be a servant of
[1:05:28] Christ. But I certify to you, brethren,
[1:05:31] that the gospel which was preached of me
[1:05:32] is not after man. For I neither received
[1:05:36] it of men, neither was I taught it, but
[1:05:38] by the revelation of Jesus Christ. For
[1:05:41] ye have heard of me by conversation in
[1:05:44] time past in the Jews religion, how that
[1:05:46] beyond measure I persecuted the church
[1:05:48] of God, and wasted it. And I profited in
[1:05:51] the Jews religion above many my equals
[1:05:54] in my own nation, being more exceedingly
[1:05:57] zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
[1:05:59] But when it pleased God, who separated
[1:06:02] me from my mother's womb, and called me
[1:06:04] by his grace to reveal his son in me,
[1:06:07] that I might preach among the heathen,
[1:06:09] immediately I conferred not with flesh
[1:06:12] and blood, neither went I up to
[1:06:14] Jerusalem to them which the apostles
[1:06:16] before me, but I went to Arabia and
[1:06:18] returned again to Damascus.
[1:06:22] This gospel that we received was the
[1:06:24] same gospel Paul preached.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; It wasn't received of man. It's not the
[1:06:29] product of man. And when we say the
[1:06:31] message, we don't mean something that
[1:06:33] man has done.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; When we say Christ, when we say the Lord
[1:06:38] Jesus Christ, there's many that bear his
[1:06:40] name that are not him, but we don't use
[1:06:42] his name profanely. We don't attribute
[1:06:44] it to things that are not him. Though we
[1:06:46] know things have gained access to it, we
[1:06:48] the son of predition is exposed.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; But we don't equate the things of God to
[1:06:53] the things of men.
[1:06:56] What God does is God.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; What man does is man.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And I understand that I do the works of
[1:07:03] men in my life all the time. But the
[1:07:06] truth, as brother Billy said, stands
[1:07:09] apart.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; It It's not the truth because I've said
[1:07:12] it.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Me, David McGary. It's the truth because
[1:07:15] it's God's word.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; And God is obligated to his word.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; If a donkey speaks it,
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; the truth stands apart. I have no claim
[1:07:24] to it as it being my own. He's claimed
[1:07:28] me by it.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; The only claim I have is that he cla he
[1:07:34] put his name on me.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; He gave me the name. He read my name.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; The truth stands sovereign.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; So just because someone takes the truth,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; they have no claim to it.
[1:07:50] Don't ever uh diminish the truth because
[1:07:54] people carry it in unrighteousness. Let
[1:07:56] the let God's word be God's word.
[1:08:00] It's not man's product.
[1:08:04] It's not received of man. It's received
[1:08:06] by by revelation. And you have to seek
[1:08:09] out in your own heart with fear and
[1:08:11] trembling and make sure that it is not
[1:08:14] an intellectual understanding.
[1:08:17] I I this really can't be confused. I
[1:08:20] know there's things in my life that I'll
[1:08:21] say I intellectually understand and I
[1:08:24] believe them, but I want them to become
[1:08:26] a revelation. It's it's not wrong to
[1:08:28] believe the truth, but we want the
[1:08:31] quickening power to come with it. We
[1:08:33] want anointed word. There's an anointing
[1:08:36] in this day that's been given to us to
[1:08:38] overcome.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Not by power, not by might, but by my
[1:08:42] spirit, sayeth the Lord.
[1:08:46] You know the the the amazing thing is
[1:08:50] there's a fruit of in of intellectual
[1:08:54] understanding
[1:08:55] and it it it's it's not that even and
[1:08:58] this this is for all of us okay because
[1:09:00] Moses the beautiful type of Moses with
[1:09:03] an intellectual understanding of who he
[1:09:05] was what his calling was what his
[1:09:07] position was with an intellectual
[1:09:09] understanding he killed a man
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; and that's what we will do with
[1:09:14] intellectual understanding it's my idea
[1:09:16] versus your idea. I want you to say it
[1:09:19] the way I say it because it's the way I
[1:09:22] understand it. So just please say it my
[1:09:25] way and otherwise I'll kill you.
[1:09:29] Say it my way. Please just use my
[1:09:31] terminology because it's my intellectual
[1:09:32] understanding. I need you to say it my
[1:09:35] way and I will totally kill your
[1:09:38] doctrine if you don't say it my way.
[1:09:41] That's an intellectual under that's the
[1:09:43] that is a mark of an intellectual
[1:09:45] understanding. And let's just go around
[1:09:48] this 50 more times so we can all adopt
[1:09:50] the same phraseology because we I got to
[1:09:57] grab it this way.
[1:09:59] So intellectual understanding will kill
[1:10:02] a man,
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; but a revelation will say, "Come see a
[1:10:05] man.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; I found a man who could tell me. Yeah,
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; I I can see where you're coming from,
[1:10:11] brother.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; I understand what you're saying. I may
[1:10:14] not say it the exact same way, but I
[1:10:16] know what you're talking about.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; I have enough grace to see what you're
[1:10:21] you're looking at the mountain from that
[1:10:23] side, aren't you?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's he's a non He's an unfelling
[1:10:27] God. His mercy is great.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; You could fellowship around a
[1:10:31] revelation.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; There's some virtue to give.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; There's a life and a saltiness that
[1:10:37] could be poured out. So God grant me
[1:10:39] more revelation.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Open your word to me, Father.
[1:10:48] We, you know, there's an identity
[1:10:50] that we have by our desire. There should
[1:10:53] be an example that's set before us. I I
[1:10:56] think of the story that Brother Brandham
[1:10:57] told of the boy that was walking in his
[1:10:59] father's footsteps and and when he
[1:11:02] looked back, he was like, "What are you
[1:11:03] doing?
[1:11:06] I'm following after you, Dad. I'm doing
[1:11:09] what you're doing.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; There's there there's somebody's
[1:11:13] footsteps that you are following in. We
[1:11:16] have to understand we are sheep.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; We are sheep.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; It's it's not negotiable.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; You are following something.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; A a discipline, uh something.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; We've been made that way.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; We're sheep.
[1:11:35] If you can understand influence, one of
[1:11:38] the first things when I became born
[1:11:40] again, oh my goodness, when I started to
[1:11:43] see that there was a voice behind
[1:11:44] everything, when I started to see that
[1:11:47] there was influence and my spiritual
[1:11:49] understanding became opened and I
[1:11:52] realized that things were voices and
[1:11:54] things were being declared out and
[1:11:56] crying out and they're w wanting to
[1:11:58] press their way in and find influence
[1:12:01] and identity in you.
[1:12:04] And you see those things being
[1:12:06] identified in people.
[1:12:11] Identity,
[1:12:13] desire
[1:12:14] being manifested.
[1:12:17] What is inside of you is declaring
[1:12:19] itself
[1:12:21] because you've followed after something.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; And if no one else sees it, he does
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; for the good, too.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; He knows your heart. He knows what
[1:12:34] you're desiring after.
[1:12:41] This is uh as the eagle stirs her nest
[1:12:43] in 6101.
[1:12:57] No 166.
[1:13:00] No sir, Papa Eagle.
[1:13:06] They look just like him. They believe
[1:13:09] the same thing he does. They look like
[1:13:12] him. Yes, sir. They're made like him.
[1:13:15] They are built like him. And he knows
[1:13:17] they're genuine eagles. Oh my. That's
[1:13:19] what God wants. A genuine Messiah.
[1:13:23] He is Messiah. Messiah the anointed one.
[1:13:26] And we are his children which have a
[1:13:28] lesser anointing. So we're as Jehovah
[1:13:31] eagle is the great eagle and we're his
[1:13:33] eaglets. He's Messiah and we were the
[1:13:36] same anointing as Messiah. Amen.
[1:13:38] Anointed Messiah means the anointed one.
[1:13:41] Are you anointed? Amen. What with the
[1:13:45] same spirit that he was anointed with.
[1:13:48] We have it in measure. He was without
[1:13:50] measure. He was God manifested in the
[1:13:52] flesh and were sons of God part of him.
[1:13:55] Come off. Yes sir. The very works that I
[1:13:58] do, ye shall do also. I might take a
[1:14:01] spoonful of water out of the ocean out
[1:14:02] here and you would never miss it out of
[1:14:05] the ocean. That's the way we would be
[1:14:08] missed if we were happening to drop out.
[1:14:11] But remember, the same chemicals that's
[1:14:13] in the entire ocean is in that spoon.
[1:14:16] Same water. That's just more of it out
[1:14:18] there. So that's what it is. Oh, you
[1:14:21] say, "What is it out there?" Ocean
[1:14:23] water. What's here? Ocean water. Just
[1:14:26] exactly. That's the way Papa Eagle
[1:14:28] thinks about his little ones.
[1:14:30] Hallelujah. How's he strutting around?
[1:14:33] He will scream at them and they'll
[1:14:34] scream back.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; That's it. I am he that was. Amen, Papa.
[1:14:41] I am he that is. Amen, Papa. I am he
[1:14:44] that is to come. Amen, Papa. I'm the
[1:14:47] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:14:49] Amen, Papa. I'm still the healer. Amen,
[1:14:52] Papa. I give the Holy Ghost. Amen. Papa
[1:14:58] little old crow.
[1:15:02] You got a little loud.
[1:15:07] Don't make me to you at all.
[1:15:09] Different reaction.
[1:15:13] You little buzzard. What you hollering
[1:15:15] about? Get out of the nest. Little
[1:15:17] vulture. You couldn't eat eagle food
[1:15:19] anyhow. That's right. Amen. Why we
[1:15:24] worried? what the what the world thinks.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about what anybody you get
[1:15:28] the victory. There's always going to be
[1:15:30] somebody over there think, "Oh, he got a
[1:15:31] little emotional, got a little in the
[1:15:33] flesh. They just never got a whole that
[1:15:37] never mind."
[1:15:41] I pray God you lose it.
[1:15:44] It I love it. Brother Brandham tells a
[1:15:46] story. It's It's God has a sense of
[1:15:49] humor.
[1:15:50] sister was dancing in the aisle
[1:15:53] and he thought it just might be a little
[1:15:55] out of order.
[1:15:58] He ended up down there dancing, too.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; You can go look that up.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; I You know what? I hope the people are
[1:16:11] really good critics are really good at
[1:16:13] looking up quotes.
[1:16:16] you. If no one knows how to use the
[1:16:17] message app by now, come see me.
[1:16:23] All right. 171. Thank you. I was going
[1:16:27] to skip ahead. You little buzzard. What
[1:16:30] you hollering about? Get out of the
[1:16:31] nest, little vulture. You couldn't eat
[1:16:33] eagle food anyhow. That's right. Oh my.
[1:16:35] Then first thing you know, he finds out
[1:16:37] that they're fine little eagles. He
[1:16:40] walks around. The first thing you know,
[1:16:41] mama is determined that her that her
[1:16:44] little eagles ain't going to be like an
[1:16:46] earthbound chicken.
[1:16:49] They ain't going to be walking on all
[1:16:52] the time going to give them a few trials
[1:16:55] to see how they come out. Every son that
[1:16:57] cometh to God must be chasened, tried.
[1:17:01] That's so important, saints.
[1:17:03] I you can, you know, we're talking about
[1:17:07] finding your identity in the scripture.
[1:17:09] You go through the scripture, there's a
[1:17:11] Hannah, there's a Rachel, there's a it's
[1:17:14] not fit to give the the bread to to
[1:17:17] dogs. There's always
[1:17:21] some resistance.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; But what comes out is the character and
[1:17:25] the nature that Christ wants to see. He
[1:17:27] knows what's in there.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what he planted and he
[1:17:32] knows it will overcome. That's right.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; He He is not doubting the gene he put in
[1:17:38] you
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; one bit.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; It's the very life of Christ in earthn
[1:17:45] vessels.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; It's overcoming power.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; But he's got to kill the shuck.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a little bit of
[1:17:54] chastening, a little bit of trying, a
[1:17:56] little bit of baking. And when they back
[1:17:59] up, say, "No, I ought." Oh, why? You
[1:18:01] wasn't a son to begin with. If you
[1:18:03] cannot stand the chastisement, then the
[1:18:05] Bible said you become a bastard child
[1:18:07] and not a son of God. So that's the way
[1:18:10] you pull them out.
[1:18:14] Like a man went forth. He said the
[1:18:16] kingdom of God throwed a net into the
[1:18:18] sea. And when he draw it out, there was
[1:18:20] tapens, crawfish, lizards, and
[1:18:22] everything else. Pulled them out onto
[1:18:25] the bank. That's the preacher's job. We
[1:18:28] don't know what is which. Some of them
[1:18:30] is fish, some of them as lizards, some
[1:18:32] of them snakes, and some of them
[1:18:33] crawfish. Watch the old crawfish when
[1:18:36] he's there. Somebody say, "Glory,
[1:18:38] hallelujah. Praise the Lord." Sayump.
[1:18:44] You know, I should play that part. Blump
[1:18:47] blump blump. I can't believe that. Right
[1:18:50] back to the water he goes. You know,
[1:18:53] just I don't know if you've ever seen a
[1:18:56] little mud bug skitter backwards.
[1:18:58] Don't want no part of it. Bloom bloom.
[1:19:01] Back to the water he goes. The old snake
[1:19:05] just slick stick his head up. I thought
[1:19:08] I was in church.
[1:19:14] We're all supposed to be refined,
[1:19:16] civilized people in here.
[1:19:20] I thought I was in church. You know,
[1:19:22] they'd be more comfortable if you're
[1:19:24] hollering at the ball game. might put it
[1:19:26] on the television and go
[1:19:30] in their own house. They just love it.
[1:19:35] But no, ain't no place for that in
[1:19:38] church, huh? The old snake just stick
[1:19:40] his head up, say, "I thought I was in
[1:19:42] church, but it's holy rollers." Here he
[1:19:45] goes. What was he? A snake to begin
[1:19:47] with. A crawfish to begin with. Old lady
[1:19:51] spider.
[1:19:53] Plunky plunk. Right back to the mud hole
[1:19:56] again. Right back out with the shorts on
[1:19:59] cutting her hair. Right. As long as it
[1:20:01] goes to the as a hog goes to its wallow,
[1:20:04] the dog to his vomit. There you are.
[1:20:06] Don't get mad. Just sit still.
[1:20:10] When I was a little kid, we lived up in
[1:20:12] Kentucky and I had a hard time living.
[1:20:14] Mama used to take out the corn pone and
[1:20:17] I don't know whether you know what that
[1:20:19] is or not. black eyed peas and turnip
[1:20:23] greens and she would make an old corn
[1:20:27] pone. We we don't have any large. She
[1:20:30] would render out meat with skins and
[1:20:32] when she would make that that grease
[1:20:35] that shortening
[1:20:37] for the corn and bread out there and
[1:20:39] then meat skins
[1:20:41] that's pretty rough.
[1:20:44] I mean I I skinned a hide. I couldn't
[1:20:46] imagine boiling a hide down to get the
[1:20:48] fat off the skin. That'd be one of the
[1:20:50] more gamey tasting things. I I don't
[1:20:54] know if anybody still does that, but
[1:20:55] that's hard living right there.
[1:20:58] And she would render out the meat skins
[1:21:00] and when she would make that the grease,
[1:21:02] the shortening out of the cornbread out
[1:21:03] of them meat skins. And you know, it was
[1:21:06] kind of bad living. So every Saturday
[1:21:08] night we all used to have to take a big
[1:21:10] bath and had a big old cedar tub and
[1:21:13] when they poured the water in to get hot
[1:21:14] and that was nine of us. And so all of
[1:21:16] them would take a bath. You never change
[1:21:19] the water. Just add some more hot water.
[1:21:21] It was the last one. Had to take my own
[1:21:24] boy. I had to bath. All right. But then
[1:21:27] the thing is that after it to get ready
[1:21:30] for school Sunday, now that was on the
[1:21:32] Saturday night and the Sunday we would
[1:21:33] all take a good round of castor oil on
[1:21:36] account of that way we had to eat. I got
[1:21:40] so sick I would hold my nose and just
[1:21:42] gag. Said, "Mama, I can't even stand
[1:21:45] this stuff. I can't." She said, "Honey,
[1:21:48] it don't make you sick, it don't do you
[1:21:50] any good." That's the way the gospel is.
[1:21:53] If it don't get your spiritual
[1:21:56] gastronomics all stirred up, make you
[1:21:59] real sick, you won't go digging, and
[1:22:02] find out where it's right or not.
[1:22:07] Don't despise the chastening of the
[1:22:10] Lord. Recognize he's doing it for a
[1:22:13] purpose. He's the answer.
[1:22:16] Hold on. In the name of the Lord, I tell
[1:22:19] you, hold on.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; It's worth it all.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; When your faith is re, you will come
[1:22:25] forth.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; No person crosses a desert unless they
[1:22:28] know there's something on the other
[1:22:30] side.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; You hang on for the answer.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; There's an answer. You may You may be
[1:22:36] all sick. You may be all tore up. There
[1:22:38] may be desperation. There may be
[1:22:40] anxiety. There may be all this turmoil.
[1:22:43] And you don't know. You feel like you're
[1:22:44] at your wits end. Hold on.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Christ is the answer. Don't settle for
[1:22:50] anything less.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; I don't I'm not here for a feel-good
[1:22:53] gospel.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; We We got a leaving message. We got a
[1:22:57] goal,
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; God. Whatever it takes. Let my character
[1:23:00] be the right character.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; If I have to die a little bit, that's
[1:23:05] okay.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; If I If I have to give something up,
[1:23:08] it's all right. But Lord, don't don't
[1:23:11] give up on me.
[1:23:13] continue to refine me.
[1:23:19] It's got to make you dig.
[1:23:22] There has to be a desperation.
[1:23:29] Just to
[1:23:32] draw on an example,
[1:23:36] I'm going to turn to Samuel. 1 Samuel
[1:23:45] Chapter one.
[1:23:56] I'm not going to try to unpack all of
[1:23:58] this.
[1:24:01] I pray the Lord will do that for you.
[1:24:07] So Hannah rose up after they had eaten
[1:24:10] in Shiloh and after they had drunk. Now
[1:24:13] Eli the priest sat upon a seat by the
[1:24:15] post of the temple of the Lord. And she
[1:24:19] was in bitterness of soul and prayed
[1:24:21] unto the Lord and wept sore.
[1:24:24] And she vowed a vow and said, "Oh Lord
[1:24:26] of host, if thou wilt indeed look on
[1:24:30] the affliction of thine handmmaid,
[1:24:33] and remember me and not forgive thine
[1:24:36] handmmaid, but wilt give unto thine
[1:24:39] handmade a manchild, then I will give
[1:24:41] him unto the Lord all the days of his
[1:24:43] life, and there shall not raise or come
[1:24:45] upon his head." And it came to pass as
[1:24:48] she continued praying before the Lord
[1:24:50] that Eli marked her mouth. Now Hannah,
[1:24:53] she spake in her heart, and only her
[1:24:56] lips moved, but her voice was not heard.
[1:24:59] Therefore Eli thought she had been
[1:25:02] drunken.
[1:25:03] And Eli said unto her, "How long wilt
[1:25:05] thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from
[1:25:08] thee."
[1:25:11] Many times right at that moment, a lot
[1:25:14] of us would have the wrong response.
[1:25:20] Well, if you were a man of God,
[1:25:24] you'd have approached me differently.
[1:25:28] But this was an opportunity.
[1:25:32] And Hannah answered and said, "No, my
[1:25:34] Lord,
[1:25:37] not who do you think you are? How dare
[1:25:39] you pick on the sisters?
[1:25:42] What do you you know just just watch the
[1:25:45] approach because what happens is there's
[1:25:48] always two reactions.
[1:25:51] There's the eagle and there's the
[1:25:52] buzzard
[1:25:54] and the word comes offensively.
[1:25:59] And what are you going to do? Are you
[1:26:01] going to repent? Are you going to have
[1:26:03] the right approach? Are you going to
[1:26:05] cover yourself with a religious spirit?
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Are you going to hide?
[1:26:13] We want the word of God to come right
[1:26:15] down to our address
[1:26:19] and speak to us and we want to be open.
[1:26:24] No, my Lord, I'm a woman of a sorrowful
[1:26:27] spirit.
[1:26:30] I have drunk neither wine nor strong
[1:26:32] drink, but I have poured out my soul
[1:26:34] before the Lord. Count not thy handmmaid
[1:26:38] for a daughter of BL, for out of the
[1:26:41] abundance of my complaint and grief, I
[1:26:43] have spoken here too. Then Eli answered
[1:26:46] said, "Go in peace, and the God of
[1:26:48] Israel grant thee thy petition,
[1:26:51] and thou hast asked of him." And she
[1:26:54] said, "Let thine handmmaiden find grace
[1:26:56] in thy sight." And so the woman went her
[1:26:59] way and did eat. And her countenance
[1:27:02] was no more sad.
[1:27:06] But there was a travail.
[1:27:09] There was a place where Hannah was at
[1:27:12] where her soul was bitter.
[1:27:18] Repentance has to have its work.
[1:27:21] [Music]
[1:27:23] And I believe you could be a good kid
[1:27:28] and not have done anything wrong.
[1:27:31] And when you come into the presence of a
[1:27:33] righteous God, recognize that you're
[1:27:35] lacking.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; There is no righteousness that we have
[1:27:39] when we come into the presence of a holy
[1:27:41] God. You may have done nothing wrong
[1:27:44] your entire life, but you can't be holy
[1:27:46] like he's holy.
[1:27:49] Even the angels are dirty before him.
[1:27:52] They never did anything wrong.
[1:27:56] to to to to relegate repentance to a
[1:27:59] checkbox so that you've never had a
[1:28:02] revelation of what it means to be born
[1:28:05] again.
[1:28:07] It's no longer your life, but the very
[1:28:10] righteousness of Jesus Christ in you
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; who can lay anything to the charge of
[1:28:15] God's elect.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; It's the life of Christ in me.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to know that you know that
[1:28:24] you know that you know
[1:28:26] And you don't need to dig it up.
[1:28:29] But if you know that your you're
[1:28:31] identified by desire,
[1:28:34] if your desire has truly changed, if
[1:28:37] your heart has been set on fire, if you
[1:28:40] want to express the heavenly image, if
[1:28:42] you've heard from your theophony, if you
[1:28:44] have a a prize, if you have a goal, if
[1:28:46] you're if you're selling all, you know
[1:28:48] what? I have nothing else.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; You want to tell me that the church of
[1:28:53] Pentecost isn't alive and well? I know
[1:28:55] there's people sitting in this building
[1:28:57] right now who will tell you they have
[1:28:59] nothing else but this message. They've
[1:29:02] sold it all out. There's nothing else
[1:29:04] that means anything to them. The message
[1:29:06] means everything.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; It's all that they have. I I can tell
[1:29:11] you it's all that I've got.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; I It doesn't need to be stripped away to
[1:29:16] prove it. I know that when it all comes
[1:29:18] down to it, it's all that I got.
[1:29:24] Don't take this message and relegate it
[1:29:28] to anything else than the grace of God
[1:29:31] to bring us up into the heavenly to give
[1:29:34] us complete and total victory.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; It's not the work of man. It wasn't made
[1:29:39] to to create theology and and it's meant
[1:29:43] for you to possess complete victory.
[1:29:47] You could be as he was, victorious,
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; possessors of all things. You can enjoy
[1:29:54] the the neverfelling presence of Christ
[1:29:57] Jesus.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; He's with you wherever you go.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:30:03] against that. Satan cannot take him from
[1:30:06] you.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; He's here
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; in your darkest hour. He's there.
[1:30:14] in your darkest hour.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; He was there
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; looking over his son.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; He would tell Satan, "No more.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; You can't go that far.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; You can't take him."
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; There's many of us have walked up to
[1:30:34] that line and God said, "No."
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Mercy said, "No.
[1:30:40] He's not going to let you go.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; You don't need to prove his love for you
[1:30:47] to walk up to that line. You just have
[1:30:49] to surrender.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; You just have to die. You have to be
[1:30:53] will and say, "Lord, I I know I have a
[1:30:55] lacking. I need you, Lord. I see the
[1:30:58] life lived. I don't have what it takes.
[1:31:00] But if the gospel's the same and you're
[1:31:03] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[1:31:04] Father, then you could touch me, too. If
[1:31:07] you've touched them by the power of the
[1:31:09] Holy Ghost, you could touch me, too.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; If they could know you in a reality that
[1:31:13] they know they know you're real, then
[1:31:16] you could do the same for me.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; If you said you came to open the blinded
[1:31:19] eyes, then you haven't changed.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; That is who you are.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; You still open the blinded eyes. So,
[1:31:26] Lord, open my eyes. There's more with us
[1:31:29] than there is with them.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me than he
[1:31:33] that's in the world. You're telling me
[1:31:34] this guy I can't lick. I can lick them.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; There's Give me my mountain.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; I'm a possessor of all things.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in me.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; There ain't another. There's not another
[1:31:49] Jesus Christ.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; You There's some that'll preach to you
[1:31:54] another Jesus Christ,
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; but there's not another.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; It's a victorious Christ.
[1:32:05] What did we read?
[1:32:08] As I've overcome.
[1:32:11] That's that's the script. That's our
[1:32:13] scripture. You want the goal. You want
[1:32:15] the prize. You want it set before you.
[1:32:22] To him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[1:32:24] sit with me in my throne. Even as I also
[1:32:28] overcome
[1:32:30] and am set down with my father in his
[1:32:32] throne. He that hath an ear, let him
[1:32:36] hear what the spirit is saying under the
[1:32:37] churches.
[1:32:39] Did you hear it?
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Hey, did you hear it? We have a promise.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; We have a mountain to take.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; It's been given to us.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; We could sit in his throne.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; We can rule with him. You know what that
[1:32:51] means? You know what that means? Oh,
[1:32:53] that I got someone on my mind.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; I got someone on my mind. When they come
[1:32:56] before me, I'm going to say grace.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, man. You know, I I think of I
[1:33:03] think the Gibeonites, Gideonites,
[1:33:06] you know, there's this tribe
[1:33:09] that saw the children of Israel, and
[1:33:11] they were fearful out of a godly fear.
[1:33:13] They had reverence sung to them. So,
[1:33:16] they're like, "Throw some moldy bread,
[1:33:19] put on some raggedy clothes, and they go
[1:33:21] up to the Israelites and like,
[1:33:25] I'm tired. I've come a long ways.
[1:33:29] I'm your neighborh. And uh
[1:33:34] we just wanted to make allegiance with
[1:33:35] you. Please don't kill us. We'll serve
[1:33:38] you. Now, they didn't know that these
[1:33:41] guys live next door.
[1:33:46] So, they make an allegiance with it.
[1:33:47] Okay. You know what? You look pretty
[1:33:50] raggedy. You look pretty tore up. You've
[1:33:53] obviously your bread's moldy. We can
[1:33:55] understand with our intellect exactly
[1:33:57] who you are. didn't consult God at all.
[1:33:59] Just intellectually sized him up. This
[1:34:02] was the amazing thing.
[1:34:05] God honored that oath. Matter of fact,
[1:34:07] they weren't allowed to break it. And
[1:34:10] when you look,
[1:34:13] when Joshua commands the son to stand
[1:34:15] still, when he speaks the word, it is
[1:34:19] for the sake of them.
[1:34:24] They were going to battle because all
[1:34:25] the other tribes were like, "Oh, you're
[1:34:27] gonna line yourself up with them guys.
[1:34:29] Well, we'll just come kill you." And you
[1:34:31] know who stood in their defense? The
[1:34:34] children of God. We have authority. And
[1:34:38] you want to see the power of God
[1:34:39] manifest? Stand for somebody.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Stand. Do battle.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil just come in and
[1:34:45] take someone's life. Do battle.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; You want to speak with authority? Say,
[1:34:50] "Let it rain on my brother's crop, son.
[1:34:52] You stand still. Go take the fight to
[1:34:54] the enemy.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Don't let him have your family. Don't
[1:34:57] let him have your loved ones. Don't let
[1:34:58] them have your neighbor.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Speak the word. The grace of God is an
[1:35:05] incredible thing.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; And then they found themselves to be
[1:35:09] servants to the Levites. So don't don't
[1:35:13] you know what?
[1:35:14] There's going to be those in the outer
[1:35:16] courts. There's going to be all sorts of
[1:35:17] things in the kingdom of God. But you
[1:35:19] have the opportunity to play a part in
[1:35:21] that economy.
[1:35:23] What kind of inheritance do you want?
[1:35:25] What kind of reward do you want? How
[1:35:26] many people do you want to be able to be
[1:35:28] fellowshipping with? You say, "I'm glad
[1:35:29] I got you here, man. Boy, going to miss
[1:35:32] you.
[1:35:34] Good to see you."
[1:35:38] Do you realize what it's been given to
[1:35:39] you?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Does it Don't you want to thirst after
[1:35:42] that?
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to have the character
[1:35:45] that's fit to rule?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Don't you recognize what we've been
[1:35:48] called to in this hour? No wonder all
[1:35:51] the saints from all the other ages
[1:35:53] wanted to be here. The the position of
[1:35:56] sons,
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; adopted sons.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; What an inheritance we could have in
[1:36:02] Christ Jesus.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Let's possess all the things that God
[1:36:06] has for us. Amen.
[1:36:21] Can I try to find a place to stop here?
[1:36:29] Amen.
[1:36:43] I find this uh
[1:36:47] problem with it getting
[1:36:50] away from your notes is then you you
[1:36:52] don't know where you're in your notes.
[1:36:54] So
[1:36:57] got a lot in here. So um
[1:37:04] you know just we make a mess of things
[1:37:08] so many times when we go about things
[1:37:09] our way and our intellect. We the other
[1:37:12] day we're over at brother Thiago's and
[1:37:15] we started putting together get two
[1:37:17] cooks in the kitchen.
[1:37:20] It's not going to be the first or the
[1:37:22] last time IKEA gets mentioned in a
[1:37:23] sermon,
[1:37:25] but we got to putting together a piece
[1:37:26] of IKEA furniture.
[1:37:31] And I think they do design those things
[1:37:33] just to prove that men can follow
[1:37:36] directions because if you don't follow
[1:37:38] the directions, it don't work.
[1:37:42] cuz the way you look at it and it goes
[1:37:45] together and it goes together perfect.
[1:37:47] It fits like it was it was supposed to
[1:37:49] go there. But by the time it was over
[1:37:51] with Julia had to go and redo it all.
[1:37:57] And I asked her, you know, how did it
[1:37:59] she took a picture of it and it was
[1:38:00] complete and it looked really good. I
[1:38:02] was like, well, how bad was it? She
[1:38:03] said, I had to redo everything.
[1:38:06] said the screws that I needed that for
[1:38:09] the very end were you had already put
[1:38:11] together like the first pieces you had
[1:38:12] to take it all apart
[1:38:17] and saints when we try to do something
[1:38:19] our way
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; he's just going to have to break it down
[1:38:22] and redo it
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; we cannot despise the chastening of the
[1:38:27] Lord
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; it is for a purpose
[1:38:31] and that's my encouragement to you I'm
[1:38:34] not saying that the travail is easy. And
[1:38:37] I'm not saying there isn't travail
[1:38:39] ahead, but when we know what the prize
[1:38:42] is, that's the same thing that Christ
[1:38:44] did for the prize set before him. He
[1:38:46] endured the cross.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; You're the prize.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; It is the it's with that in mind. We'd
[1:38:52] be the most miserable of all people if
[1:38:54] we didn't recognize for which we were
[1:38:56] contending.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that that I've tasted
[1:39:00] of it's worth it all.
[1:39:03] I there is nothing that this world has
[1:39:06] and can compare to the things of God.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; There ain't no drug. There ain't nothing
[1:39:11] that one moment in his presence.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; It it's greater than anything, saints.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go try to find out.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; That's all substitutes.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And and I can testify to that. There's
[1:39:28] nothing greater than the reality of the
[1:39:30] presence of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Nothing greater.
[1:39:35] Period.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; And I want to live in it. I want baptism
[1:39:40] after baptism.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; It's what renews me. I love it when the
[1:39:45] inspiration of the Lord draws near. I
[1:39:46] love his anointing. I love his power. I
[1:39:48] love his grace. I live for that. I want
[1:39:50] to be I I want to be in it. I want to be
[1:39:53] found in his presence. I love the
[1:39:54] quickening power upon my heart. Yeah.
[1:39:57] that can make me a fanatic.
[1:39:59] You know what happens is is because
[1:40:00] people have no seed in them, they know
[1:40:03] that that leads to sensuality
[1:40:07] because it's just anointing on flesh.
[1:40:09] That's all they have to be anointed.
[1:40:10] Because without the seed of God in you,
[1:40:13] it just causes manifestation.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; But you know what I say, God? Bring it
[1:40:17] everything to manifestation.
[1:40:19] Bring it all to maturity. This is the
[1:40:22] this is the day of harvest.
[1:40:25] Lord, I want to be a mature Christian by
[1:40:28] your word, by your spirit. Mature me,
[1:40:31] Christ, into your image.
[1:40:40] This is in the sixth seal, paragraph uh
[1:40:44] 384.
[1:40:48] This is what it comes down to, saints,
[1:40:50] is when when the word comes, your
[1:40:53] attitude to the word.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you'll honor these
[1:40:57] people for their respects to the word
[1:41:00] and heal them for Jesus' sake. Out here
[1:41:03] in the audience, Lord, there's sitting a
[1:41:05] people just like it was who for ge who
[1:41:09] listened to the apostle Peter on the day
[1:41:10] of Pentecost, how he went back to the
[1:41:13] word and got the word. I like that. This
[1:41:18] is uh 630323
[1:41:22] paragraph 384.
[1:41:26] How he went back to the word and got the
[1:41:28] word and he said Joel said in the last
[1:41:30] days these days will take place and this
[1:41:34] is that and
[1:41:37] 3,000 believed it and were baptized. And
[1:41:40] father, today we stand here by your
[1:41:42] grace. And it's not because that it's a
[1:41:45] special people, but it's because just
[1:41:47] like in the days of the lion or the ox
[1:41:49] or the man, it's eagle time. It's the
[1:41:52] anointing of the hour.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; It's the time that we're living in. It's
[1:41:58] the work of the Holy Spirit for this
[1:42:01] particular time to prove that Jesus is
[1:42:05] not dead.
[1:42:11] It's an anointing
[1:42:14] that is here
[1:42:16] to prove that anointing just as David
[1:42:19] was anointed, just as anybody was
[1:42:21] anointed. If you understand the church
[1:42:22] ages, the had the anointing of the ox
[1:42:24] and martyrdom and the wisdom of man.
[1:42:26] This is the eagle hour. There is an an
[1:42:29] eagle anointing. You want to be found
[1:42:32] under the influence and the anointing
[1:42:34] for your day.
[1:42:37] because you could be found
[1:42:40] being distracted
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; and being trapped and being laboring in
[1:42:46] another field. And that that's a lot of
[1:42:49] what's going on. But you want to be in
[1:42:52] the channel of what God's doing in this
[1:42:54] day under the anointing that he has for
[1:42:56] you.
[1:42:59] It's it anointing matters.
[1:43:03] It's the time that we're living in. It's
[1:43:05] the work of the Holy Spirit for this
[1:43:07] particular time to prove that Jesus is
[1:43:10] not dead. The things that he said that
[1:43:12] he would do just before the evening
[1:43:14] light were out. Here we've seen him do
[1:43:16] that right down along the road. We seen
[1:43:20] it come down the scientific research and
[1:43:23] his picture taken the great pillar of
[1:43:24] fire and that led the children of Israel
[1:43:27] who met Paul on the road.
[1:43:30] This is the pillar of fire.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; This is the picture that he's referring
[1:43:34] to.
[1:43:35] And we know the same pillar of fire that
[1:43:37] led Moses down there in the wilderness.
[1:43:38] By that same pillar of fire, he wrote
[1:43:40] several books of the Bible. For he was
[1:43:43] anointed with the word. The same pillar
[1:43:46] of fire coming upon Paul on the road to
[1:43:48] Damascus, he wrote many books of the
[1:43:50] Bible called the word of God. And now
[1:43:52] Lord, the same pillar of fire by the
[1:43:54] evidence of the proof of the word and by
[1:43:56] the scientific research that we see it
[1:43:58] revealing the word of the Lord. God let
[1:44:02] the people quickly awaken Lord quickly
[1:44:06] those who have the name put on the book
[1:44:08] of life when the flashes across their
[1:44:11] path may they see. Let the little
[1:44:13] ill-famed woman all the way well that
[1:44:16] day she recognized quickly and she knew
[1:44:19] it was the scripture. And now, Father, I
[1:44:21] pray that all that will receive you at
[1:44:23] this time in their hearts will settle it
[1:44:25] forever at this hour and they'll finish
[1:44:28] with sin and with and will arise and
[1:44:32] make preparation now for public
[1:44:34] confession of baptism in the name of
[1:44:35] Jesus Christ for the remission of their
[1:44:37] sins to show that they believe that God
[1:44:39] has forgiven them and they take on the
[1:44:42] name of Jesus Christ. Then, Father, pour
[1:44:44] down the Holy Spirit of oil upon them,
[1:44:47] that they might be placed into the
[1:44:49] service of the Lord God, that they might
[1:44:51] be workers in this last evil day. For we
[1:44:54] realize we have just a short time, and
[1:44:57] the church might go at any time. The
[1:44:59] lamb might at any time leave the
[1:45:01] sanctuary up there, the throne of
[1:45:02] sacrifice, come from the throne of God,
[1:45:04] but the sacrifice lays over there. No
[1:45:06] more hopes of the world. She's finished.
[1:45:08] And she goes into frustrations and great
[1:45:11] spasms, earthquakes, and the great
[1:45:12] things shaking and the resurrection and
[1:45:14] the and Christ rose from the grave when
[1:45:17] the saints rise and the same thing will
[1:45:20] take place. Lord, could it be any
[1:45:23] minute? We're watching that glad day to
[1:45:27] arrive. Take your children under your
[1:45:29] own, Father. Draw your little lambs to
[1:45:32] your bosom, grant it, and feed them on
[1:45:34] the word till they strengthen for
[1:45:37] service. We commit them to you now.
[1:45:39] Lord, answer this prayer.
[1:45:42] Saints, the desperation of the hour has
[1:45:45] got to become real.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; At any time, this thing could wrap up.
[1:45:52] The sincerity and the desperation that
[1:45:54] we want to be identified with is the
[1:45:56] fruit of that desperation.
[1:45:59] The fruit of recognizing just like it
[1:46:02] would be
[1:46:03] a Rahab, get them in.
[1:46:07] We want to get all those in that could
[1:46:08] be saved.
[1:46:10] The hours late, we're marked by the
[1:46:14] fruit of our lives, by the desperation,
[1:46:15] by the desire that we have, by where we
[1:46:18] stored up our treasures, where our
[1:46:21] hearts at. The things that we declare,
[1:46:23] by the very things that we do speak
[1:46:26] louder than our words.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; And Lord, help me live a life worthy of
[1:46:32] this gospel. the musicians would come.
[1:46:37] You know, sometimes it may feel
[1:46:41] that what you're doing is your own
[1:46:44] effort.
[1:46:47] You may feel like you're dragging your
[1:46:48] flesh to church. You may feel like it's
[1:46:51] almost completely a carnal act. But I
[1:46:53] want to encourage you that if you're
[1:46:55] doing it according to the word of God,
[1:46:57] that's the supernatural element.
[1:47:01] That's the supernatural element.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; By possessing the word of God, you are
[1:47:06] possessing the supernatural. And by you
[1:47:08] acting on it
[1:47:11] despite everything else, that's
[1:47:14] supernatural.
[1:47:16] When you put God's word first and you
[1:47:18] put it into action, when the devil knows
[1:47:23] that there's been nothing else given to
[1:47:25] you but the word,
[1:47:27] that's supernatural.
[1:47:31] You're a supernatural people. You're the
[1:47:32] people of the book. When you have the
[1:47:34] word in your possession and you act upon
[1:47:36] it, that faith in the word that'll
[1:47:38] produce what God sent it to is pleasing
[1:47:40] to God.
[1:47:43] So while there's a power and while
[1:47:45] there's anointing and while there's
[1:47:47] spirit, there's nothing more
[1:47:48] supernatural than a son of God by the
[1:47:50] hands of faith taking the word of God
[1:47:52] and doing battle
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; because you know in whom you've
[1:47:55] believed. And the hands of faith that a
[1:47:58] son of God has are different hands.
[1:48:02] The weapons of our warfare are not
[1:48:04] flesh. They're not carnal.
[1:48:06] They tear down Satan's kingdom.
[1:48:13] Just thinking of even that,
[1:48:15] I I'd say that one of the times where
[1:48:17] I've seen one of the most supernatural
[1:48:19] things in my life, I saw the dead
[1:48:21] raised. I told the testimony a while
[1:48:23] back.
[1:48:25] And when I after that was done, I think
[1:48:28] I was so in shock, brother Billy.
[1:48:31] But I knew what he was worthy of, I
[1:48:35] stood there and I started glorifying
[1:48:37] God. And I'll tell you, I've never felt
[1:48:38] more in my flesh than in that moment
[1:48:41] when I was standing before witnesses
[1:48:43] saying, "God, you're worthy.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm going to praise you. Look what
[1:48:47] you've done." I was commanding my mind
[1:48:50] and my lips and my voice to praise him.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you one thing I wasn't
[1:48:54] going to do. I was going to be silent.
[1:48:58] Not after what I seen he done,
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; saints. And once he's become real to
[1:49:03] you,
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; give him what he's worthy of.
[1:49:10] You don't have to be supernaturally
[1:49:13] charged. You just have to know that he's
[1:49:14] real.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; And know that it's pleasing to him. Let
[1:49:18] the love of God reign in your hearts.
[1:49:21] God bless you.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Let's just turn the service over to our
[1:49:26] brother and pray. Heavenly Father, we're
[1:49:29] so thankful, Lord, that you've made
[1:49:30] yourself real to us. And
[1:49:33] Lord, you have a grace that's sufficient
[1:49:35] for us. And Lord, we're going to have
[1:49:37] confidence in the hand that you have in
[1:49:41] our life that though it's trial, though
[1:49:42] it's travail, though it's heartache,
[1:49:44] whatever it is, Lord, that you're
[1:49:46] molding a character that's pleasing to
[1:49:48] you. Lord, we're not going to despise
[1:49:50] your chastisement, Father. Those things
[1:49:53] that would lead us to repent,
[1:49:55] Lord. We want you to have your complete
[1:49:57] and perfect work, Lord. Our confidence
[1:50:00] is in you that who's begun the work will
[1:50:02] finish it, Lord. and we don't rest in
[1:50:06] even our own ability that we can do
[1:50:09] something to make a significant change,
[1:50:11] Father. But we need you to come and be
[1:50:13] the differencemaker,
[1:50:15] Lord. Our confidence is that you're with
[1:50:17] us, that the neverfailing presence of
[1:50:19] Jesus Christ is here to perform what
[1:50:21] you've promised, Lord. And my prayer now
[1:50:24] is that we as bow our heads, Lord, that
[1:50:28] Lord, in you and your grace, as you've
[1:50:29] made yourself real to me and me being
[1:50:32] unworthy, Father, that you would also,
[1:50:35] Lord, by that same grace, open the eyes
[1:50:37] of the blind, Lord. Our commission in
[1:50:39] this calling is that the blinded eyes
[1:50:41] would be open, Lord. And that's Jesus
[1:50:44] Christ, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:50:46] forever, Lord. And you're the confirmer
[1:50:48] of that. It's not something man can do,
[1:50:52] Lord. But we look to you in your grace
[1:50:54] and we ask that for we believe we're
[1:50:57] standing in your will and your
[1:51:01] a love for us has been declared.
[1:51:04] Satan, we give you charge to leave as
[1:51:06] you would try to blind the eyes of your
[1:51:10] God's people.
[1:51:12] You have no standing here. This is
[1:51:14] bloodbought ground.
[1:51:16] The blood that was shed on Calvary
[1:51:18] dripped upon this very earth that we're
[1:51:20] formed from. We're the purchase of
[1:51:23] Calvary
[1:51:25] and you have no ground. You have no
[1:51:27] right.
[1:51:29] Lord, we ask that the victory that you
[1:51:31] won, Lord, would be manifested.
[1:51:34] We'll be careful to give you the praise
[1:51:36] and the glory and the honor. For we ask
[1:51:38] it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:40] Amen.
[1:51:57] Stand and sing that tonight.
[1:52:01] Oh, I need you, Lord.
[1:52:04] I need you, Lord,
[1:52:07] right now.
[1:52:13] And I need you, Lord.
[1:52:16] I need you, Lord,
[1:52:19] right now.
[1:52:24] Oh, I raise my hands.
[1:52:28] I'll bow my knees
[1:52:31] and worship at your throne.
[1:52:35] Oh, and I need you, Lord.
[1:52:39] I need you, Lord.
[1:52:43] Just sing it again. Just sing it from
[1:52:45] your heart tonight.
[1:52:47] Oh, and I need you, Lord.
[1:52:51] I need you, Lord,
[1:52:54] right now.
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:59] Oh, and I need you, Lord.
[1:53:03] I need you, Lord,
[1:53:06] right now.
[1:53:10] [Music]
[1:53:12] I raise my hands.
[1:53:15] I'll bow my knees
[1:53:18] and worship at your throne.
[1:53:24] I need you.
[1:53:27] I need to
[1:53:29] right now.
[1:53:35] Lord, I come.
[1:53:40] I confess
[1:53:44] by you.
[1:53:48] I find my way.
[1:53:51] Oh, and without you,
[1:53:56] I'll fall.
[1:54:00] Oh, and you're the one
[1:54:04] that guides my heart.
[1:54:08] Oh Lord, I need you. Oh, I need
[1:54:16] you. Oh, and every
[1:54:22] I need
[1:54:25] Oh, you're my one
[1:54:28] faith. Oh my rightousness.
[1:54:34] Oh God, how I need
[1:54:39] you.
[1:54:41] Oh, where seems run.
[1:54:44] Oh, your grace is more
[1:54:50] where grace is found. Hallelujah.
[1:54:54] He's grace himself tonight. Oh, and you
[1:54:59] are.
[1:55:01] Oh Lord I am free
[1:55:06] and a holy man.
[1:55:09] Oh is Christ in me.
[1:55:14] Oh Lord I
[1:55:20] need
[1:55:22] Oh
[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:27] my.
[1:55:30] Oh my god.
[1:55:34] Oh, and my rightest.
[1:55:40] Oh, God
[1:55:41] mighty. Sing that second verse again.
[1:55:46] Oh, and worship runs deep.
[1:55:51] Your grace is
[1:55:55] where the grace is found.
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:55:59] That is where you are. Lord
[1:56:04] you are
[1:56:07] Lord. I am free
[1:56:11] and I'm holy.
[1:56:14] Oh is Christ in me.
[1:56:19] Oh Lord I need you.
[1:56:24] Oh my.
[1:56:26] [Music]
[1:56:28] Oh my.
[1:56:31] [Music]
[1:56:36] Oh, you're my
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, and my
[1:56:43] tasteless.
[1:56:45] Oh, God.
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:53] Hallelujah. I trust the word spoke to
[1:56:56] you tonight. You know, when you lose the
[1:56:59] hunger for something,
[1:57:02] there's nothing left. You know, you just
[1:57:06] follow through and you just basically
[1:57:08] just become a follower. But something is
[1:57:12] worth when you have the hunger for it.
[1:57:15] You know, the word is given and we see
[1:57:18] it and we don't want to be like those
[1:57:20] that grew up by the sea. We see, you
[1:57:22] know, we played in the water every day
[1:57:24] and all of the sudden the sea don't mean
[1:57:27] anything to us.
[1:57:30] The the the it's it's given to
[1:57:32] accomplish your purpose. And if we have
[1:57:35] that purpose as our goal in mind, we're
[1:57:38] going to strive until it happens. You
[1:57:41] know, you don't rest your weapon when
[1:57:43] the battle is not finished yet. You
[1:57:46] know, you you keep your weapon. You keep
[1:57:48] fighting until the battle is over.
[1:57:50] That's what a soldier does. The the
[1:57:53] enemy is full of distraction as we heard
[1:57:56] it. He will get something going on over
[1:57:59] here, you know, hey, pay attention over
[1:58:02] here. Pay all of that. He's just trying
[1:58:04] to slow your progress. He's trying to
[1:58:07] get you to a place where you remove you
[1:58:10] you you you take your eyes off the ball
[1:58:12] as he would say so you don't focus
[1:58:14] anymore so you worry about the cares of
[1:58:17] life and the things around you and
[1:58:19] everything all in a while while you are
[1:58:21] in battle. You can't do all of that. You
[1:58:25] focus on the battle and Jesus will fight
[1:58:27] everything for you. You focus on the
[1:58:30] goal ahead. He will provide everything
[1:58:32] else that we have need of. But there has
[1:58:34] to be a hunger within the heart. I mean,
[1:58:38] you go read some of the messages even
[1:58:40] after 63, the prophet is standing there
[1:58:43] says that the seal is open and all of
[1:58:45] this, but we have a hunger within our
[1:58:48] I'm like,
[1:58:49] you have a hunger.
[1:58:53] The reality of God is continual. The
[1:58:57] reality of God is every day. We we live
[1:59:01] in a time where the the enemy is so
[1:59:04] deceitful. It's not time to even pay any
[1:59:07] mind or any of your time trying to
[1:59:10] understand what the enemy is. I love
[1:59:12] what our brother said. We have been
[1:59:13] given a message and we desire for that
[1:59:16] message to become a reality. And I we
[1:59:19] don't care what the church down the
[1:59:21] street is doing, what the others are
[1:59:23] doing. And I'll even say this, I don't
[1:59:26] care what my neighbors doing.
[1:59:30] I want the word to become a reality to
[1:59:32] me.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; And once it's a reality to me, I want it
[1:59:38] to become a reality for you,
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; for the other person, for the other
[1:59:42] person. You see, the problem is if you
[1:59:45] keep distracted, you won't fight for the
[1:59:47] right thing.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; We we want to be the light of the world.
[1:59:52] And we can't be the light unless we
[1:59:55] partake of the light. We we we we are
[1:59:58] this human being that part of us as
[2:00:01] brother will say Jesus Christ was 100%
[2:00:04] man and 100% human. We don't want to
[2:00:07] focus on the human side. We want to
[2:00:09] focus on the the the heavenly side, the
[2:00:12] God part of us and let it shine and let
[2:00:16] it possess our vessel and lead us into a
[2:00:19] place where we can actually focus and be
[2:00:22] about our father's business. You know,
[2:00:24] some part of the enemies, you know, even
[2:00:27] why the church is not full is because
[2:00:29] people have places to go. They got jobs,
[2:00:31] they got things, and they got bills, and
[2:00:33] they got And oh my, let me say this. I
[2:00:37] just want to say this with all my heart.
[2:00:39] The the enemy, he's been studying men
[2:00:42] for 6,000 years.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; He knows everything about man.
[2:00:49] And the only way we will enter when all
[2:00:52] is said and done, it's going to be by
[2:00:54] revelation.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; It's going to be by stripping everything
[2:01:00] everything humanly. Just like Jesus
[2:01:03] said, not my will but thy will. Father,
[2:01:06] we will have to come to a place where he
[2:01:08] says, "Father, I have no will. I have no
[2:01:11] way. If you don't come, I die."
[2:01:17] If we still have even an ounce of
[2:01:20] intellectual that we can hang on to and
[2:01:22] and because I still got a job, then I'll
[2:01:24] come. No, it's going to have to come to
[2:01:26] a place where we say when all is
[2:01:28] stripped away from me, I'll still serve
[2:01:31] the Lord
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; because it will go either one way or the
[2:01:37] other. And all it's looking for is to
[2:01:40] slow you down from the progress from
[2:01:43] obtaining to the promise. And the
[2:01:45] scripture says they without them uh them
[2:01:48] without us they're not made perfect. So
[2:01:51] they are waiting on us to catch up. They
[2:01:54] are waiting for us to win. I love said
[2:01:57] they are probably standing over there
[2:01:58] and just pressing on and just screaming
[2:02:01] press on brothers. You're almost there.
[2:02:03] Don't give up. Just keep going.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Let's not give up. Let's continue the
[2:02:08] fight. He the general Jesus Christ
[2:02:12] himself is leading the fight. Let's
[2:02:14] continue and he will lead us to the
[2:02:16] promised land. Amen. Brother M. Thomas
[2:02:18] sake, if you could just come and dismiss
[2:02:20] us. Amen. And if you need prayer
[2:02:22] tonight, don't be ashamed. Don't be
[2:02:24] afraid. You just come up and I'll say
[2:02:26] this even while the word is being
[2:02:28] preached. If you need prayer, just come
[2:02:29] up forward.
[2:02:33] All right? You don't have to wait. And
[2:02:35] you know, Bman says we can get out of
[2:02:36] order a little bit. You know, just come
[2:02:38] forward and the Lord will speak to you
[2:02:41] and he will do what he needs to do.
[2:02:42] Amen.
[2:02:51] Let's bow our hands.
[2:02:54] Heavenly Father, Lord, it was
[2:02:57] good to be in the house of the Lord
[2:02:58] tonight.
[2:03:03] Lord, the word spoken, Lord, has
[2:03:07] gone forth, Lord.
[2:03:12] Lord, I pray that everyone in here,
[2:03:14] Lord, that might be streaming, Lord,
[2:03:16] that
[2:03:19] that we would go out and be doers of
[2:03:21] your word, Lord, not just hearers.
[2:03:26] Lord, as our brother just said, the hour
[2:03:28] is late, the distractions are great.
[2:03:35] Lord, the enemy is coming in like a
[2:03:37] flood.
[2:03:40] During a flood, every crack, every
[2:03:42] crevice, every little area, Lord, gets
[2:03:45] filled with water, Lord.
[2:03:49] But we had one come in this day that
[2:03:52] reminded us that when we see the enemy
[2:03:55] come in like a flood, that you raise up
[2:03:58] a standard. Lord, you've raised up a
[2:04:01] word to to bring us victory.
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; The words are a victorious. Lord, it's
[2:04:09] us that you're waiting for, Lord. Help
[2:04:12] us to continue to die daily. Lord, to
[2:04:16] put you first, to seek first the kingdom
[2:04:18] of God.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; All the devil has is
[2:04:26] lies.
[2:04:30] Lord, we know that
[2:04:32] you've got our back.
[2:04:36] Lord, it's been you the whole time. It's
[2:04:38] grace that's led us
[2:04:41] safe this far, and your grace will lead
[2:04:43] us home.
[2:04:45] that we just ask that you'd be with us,
[2:04:47] Lord, that you would.
[2:04:50] We want to give you the preeminence,
[2:04:52] Lord, not just in this service,
[2:04:57] but in our lives, Lord.
[2:05:00] We don't just want a savior. We want a
[2:05:02] Lord.
[2:05:04] This message was not a message of a man,
[2:05:07] but from you, Almighty God.
[2:05:12] We love you. We thank you for it. We ask
[2:05:14] that you'd be with us as we go. In Jesus
[2:05:17] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:05:22] Amen. God bless you. Amen. Want to
[2:05:25] remember our pastor and just pray that
[2:05:27] the Lord will bring him back safe home
[2:05:29] and those that are still on that went to
[2:05:32] camp and other places and the Lord will
[2:05:35] be with them. Amen. Beautiful
[2:05:39] Lord,
[2:05:42] wonderful
[2:05:43] Savior,
[2:05:46] I know for sure.
[2:05:49] [Music]
[2:05:50] All of my days are
[2:05:54] held in your hand,
[2:05:58] crafted into
[2:06:02] your perfect
[2:06:03] [Music]
[2:06:06] plan.
[2:06:09] Oh, when you gently call me
[2:06:14] into your presence,
[2:06:18] guiding me by
[2:06:22] your Holy Spirit,
[2:06:26] teach me the Lord
[2:06:29] to live all of my life
[2:06:33] into
[2:06:36] Oh,
[2:06:42] I'm captured by
[2:06:45] your holy calling.
[2:06:50] Take me up.
[2:06:53] I know you're drawing
[2:06:57] me to yourself.
[2:07:02] Lead me, Lord.
[2:07:05] I pray.
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:12] Oh, take me,
[2:07:17] mold me,
[2:07:21] use me,
[2:07:25] feed me.
[2:07:29] I give my life
