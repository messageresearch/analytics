remind us once again father the great reward for those that run the race with patience Lord we're grateful for all the truth that you've given to light our path father we know that you have something for each and every one of us this evening as an individual draw Us close to you first father and then close one to another I know your great desires that we would love one another that pleases you more than any but as a individual and as a body May our hearts be holy set on you we ask this this evening in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen God bless you this evening we're going to get right into our service this evening with brother Paul and and just trust that the Lord has something how many knows the Lord knows your heart he knows what you have neither and he knows what your burden is and he can just lift it I mean he knows he's gonna get you to the next step he's got predestinated for you to be that's what I'm counting on this evening then he'll take me all the way through so let's just invite uh brother Paul this evening we appreciate brother Paul it's great sacrifice for the gospel this evening brother Paul God bless you brother thank you it's a privilege to have you here and work with us for the bill we bless you all right may the Lord bless you Allah as we are still standing let's take our Bibles um we're gonna open in the Book of John and the Long Point John chapter 14 we're going to read verse 16 to 20. and the Bible says it's Jesus speaking foreign and I have prayed I says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelt with he dwells with you and shall abide with you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you and yet a little while the world the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live ye shall live also on Facebook at that day he shall know that I am in my father and I and ye in me and I in you let's flip over to John chapter 12 we're going to read verse 32. foreign if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me let's pray we bless your name Lord [Music] because of your love you will you've allowed us to be gathering your house tonight we are conscience that none of us made any such effort to be here tonight but it's your goodness and your grace towards us and because of that we want to make our hearts available that you may speak to us yourself because we know that the words of men cannot help another but your word is sufficient come and abide with us in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I have your seats I believe we are happy to be gathering the house of God it's a great privilege for us to be at the service of Our Lord uh when I was getting ready for this service I was telling brother that the devil fought me greatly you should be nearest benediction I thank the Lord because many times when the devil is fighting like this the means behind is a blessing uh so since yesterday when Brother David asked me to to come in and preach tonight well come she tell him and when I because I was at home I was not doing anything so I started praying and meditating so God can Inspire something to me and right after that I started feeling some violent headaches [Music] I went to bed about 1am is I woke up around 5 a.m 5 30 a.m and even this morning I still had headaches I even try to to take my blood pressure it was a little bit higher the devil wanted me to call by the David and tell him is there a way I can get off of this is I told him at the service of the Lord if if it would require for me to fall at the pulpit I will it should be needed and I thank the lord it's happened to me many times like this I was coming to the PAW Patrol and all I know is every time I go down I feel I feel I'm not sick anymore and I believe the same thing will happen tonight [Music] as I was meditating I was telling brother Billy in the back I didn't know how to title my my thoughts but from the scripture we just read in John chapter 12 32. I want to speak on how can Jesus still attract today because he said said if I'll be lifted up I will draw all men unto me Jesus Jesus has to be lifted up so he can draw all men unto him and that's what he said in his word and he has to continue to draw people he has to continue to draw people to his word and we know that in the beginning when God created man God placed them in the garden and everything was perfect and they were only walking by the word of God and as long as they were in the word of God everything was perfect because he had attributes that he wanted to manifest a person he couldn't have been a savior unless there was someone to say you don't call Adam so when Adam and Eve left the position the word position when they they went away from the word said that God had a three-fold purpose that in his three-fold purpose he wanted to express himself remember he wanted to express himself and as this great God Spirit music he couldn't Express himself through his population to the humanity remember so he created himself a body the body of our Lord Jesus he came to dwell in that flesh to express himself to show us who he was to show us how he was to express to us the love that God had for Humanity because you remember that God himself those are pretty children fullness of of uh deity he came to dwell in Jesus Christ to express himself foreign according to the very definition of Isaiah Emmanuel the son is Emmanuel God With Us is God who came to express and reveal himself towards us and when he was Jesus was ready to leave the Earth that's when we read the book of John he began to speak to his disciples and I said let not your heart be troubled believe in God believe also in me it was really truly the the uh uh to his disciples now there were some in the disciples that were still a little bit confused like Philip conscious when he said believe in God believe also in me he said my father and I we are one Phillip he said just show us the father and I will suffice and he would say Philip I've been with you so long and you don't know who I am is and Jesus knew that he had fulfilled the first the the the first purpose of this threefold purpose and then he made a promise that I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you [Music] because he had to fulfill the second purpose of the threefold purpose it was God wanting to have preeminence over his people preeminence over his church because he wanted to continue his work through the bride but Israel said to put ahead because he wanted to bring this right to be like a prisoner who only walks according to the leadership of the Holy Ghost because he says yet a little while the world will see me no more the world will not see him anymore there is a promise for us in our everyday life we have to see Jesus in our work of every day we have to see Jesus when we don't see Jesus we are ask ourselves a question some noodles are we in that second fault purpose that he was trying to fulfill because he promised [Music] he brings it to pass always the word always comes to a fulfillment and today that Jesus has changed the form he said when I'll be lifted up I will draw man unto me he needed you and I in order to attract men to him God doesn't have other hands except your hands God doesn't have either feet except your feet God doesn't have any other mouth except your mouth so God is counting on us to attract men unto him it's a sufficient sermon to attract men unto him foreign how was Adam and Eve in the beginning and we know that that is going to pass in the same time but in order for us to go through to that place we have in our time the Jews as we are living the second purpose where God is having preeminence of his people to prepare us so we can be uh give ourselves as instruments to prepare us so we can give ourselves completely to God so God can use us to attract men unto himself um the marriage of the Lamb paragraph 133 it says did you ever notice what the real church is supposed to do it is in the Old Testament when they had it when they had the sacrifice they killed one bird and they put the blood upon another company more the dead mate and they flew across the Earth spreading the blood of the Dead mate the correctly David when the church becomes the real bride of Jesus Christ she's carrying the blood of Jesus Christ with her sprinkling it up on the ground calling holy holy holy unto the Lord it is every bit of her will be of God her whole makeup will be of God you can't expect nothing else it is that's why people come to church too that was that's the reason why people come to church we went from the we went to the body and we're going to the body form or through the word form and we come to church so that this word that we are listening to the word that God has given us then that he would take us from this Mortal body this body of sin so he can bring us to the body word so he can bring our body to The Obedience of the word who can definitely imagine so we can become in the image of Christ so we can express Christ it says that's why that's why people come to church not to play cards play poker dance in the basement things like that that's for the world and we'll never be able to compare with them and shame on us sort of trying to that are trying it no death your pressure we should preach the Holy Ghost in power and the resurrection of Christ we've got something they haven't got let us live it please not trying to copy after them we don't have to copy after the world we don't have to copy the nomination because we have something particular the new death of him that we have to live so we can be in the image of Christ that we may attract or or pull men unto him let us live it [Music] that's why we are no longer drawing but God is calling upon us tonight it's to consider our position but what God is here on Earth that God is living as the grace to meet this message not that we can live like simple morals [Music] not to imitate what the world is doing not to walk like the world is walking today the world is doing all that they can big things so they can attract people to themselves so they can attract Christians for Destruction to consecrate ourselves to God they're doing it so we don't have time to think about God someone can go to a football stadium he can be there for six hours supporting my contacts but if a preacher preaches more than two hours he starts to sleep he become annoyed that's already enough a lot about television foreign sometimes someone can spend the whole night on social media ask them to pray for 15 minutes it will fall asleep because the devil knows that God has a purpose for you we cannot overcome when we go in the same field as the devil we will never have overcoming Powers we're gonna be we're gonna be happy today and when we go out the devil takes us back we become sad we come next time we are happy we go back he takes us back but the only way so it doesn't take us back we consecrate ourselves to God that we may claim to God who made the promise to remember that he himself that he will come to form this sentence in the form of the Holy Ghost to abide in US bring us to where we become we hunger and thirst if the true Christian Life and when we walk foreign [Music] you know if we go there I know he may give us the opportunity to hunt in his place media but he said when one of the men is a is an unbeliever is a infidel they went but the word went out but when I'm stayed in the car yeah he went and he presented himself on banks were the the my daddy's word can we go Hun he said yeah there's no problem he said oh I have my pre my pastor with me foreign it says I don't believe you preachers you you barking on the wrong tree expression said it's an expression that means that you are only Liars you talk about things you have no idea you said you see that mountain I was born up there it's about seven years I look everywhere I know there's nothing that looks like God told them he asked him about the palm tree said are you the one who planted that tree he said yeah I planted it about 40 years ago is it can I take a one one of the the apples took the Apple yeah and he started asking him a question foreign what is the intelligence because we know that the botanic life doesn't have intelligence but what intelligent tells tells the tree that when fall comes that it may hide his life he says among the preachers there is only one man if he was to come back here but that preacher came this woman couldn't even stand up her sister went to the meetings and as this preacher was preaching under the inspiration he told the sister that you have a handkerchief he has a little bit thing blue on it trying to Circle you have a sister who's dying of cancer that saith the Lord take the handkerchief and place it up on my sister and she shall be healed it is we heard such a noise coming from there and we thought that she passed away in the morning we went to to to uh to uh said is C and EF to me D you tell me what intelligence that would tell the life to come down on the roots and to come back during the Spring I will tell you let's tell you the intelligence that told me to say that say of the Lord that woman is here is that all you want to say to you the man gave his life to Christ why past can I stream it because he expressed Christ because he knew what he was talking about because Christ was manifested because today God doesn't just needs for us to talk but could not but our lives come set them like as the man who came in contact with him that the person may not just take our words but look at our lives that which we are and say I want to be like that person I want to be like that person says in the message Zacchaeus the businessman paragraph 152. it says hear me if you are really determined to see him you don't care what you have to go through with or how much criticism what other people say you want to see Jesus you'll do anything to see him you will wait your turn you'll do you'll do whatever your purpose to do just so you you get to see him the trouble today is today that there's not a thirst enough thirsting enough there's not enough thirst and hunger for for the people at least I believe the church ought to be a little more saltier than it is than what it is God creates a thirst salt is the savior if it if it's in contact but if the salt has lost his favor it's henceforth good for nothing but whatever but become an organization that's right but you've got to have the favor the savior is the salt the strength if a man sees Christ Living in you it will make him thirst to be like you it will make him see Jesus in you make him see God he needs every single one of us he needs us to manifest Christ every promise that God spoke for us I like the song that says that every promise in the book is mine that every every chapter every letter every promise is mine make a journal fit may God help us and to manifest Christ to the Dying World he says here is voice paragraph 102. CC is and when you get desperate about these things something will take place you are not desperate enough I go to Christian Life Tabernacle that's it but that's not enough it says he says you paragraph s and I belong to church and that that settles it but it has you have to be desperate about it you he says you have you have to really need God Jesus said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled but as long as you are satisfied with the things of the world how can God ever speak to you God wants God wants to bring you to his image to his resemblance he wants to speak to you but you are too filled up with the things of the world that's what's the matter with us today we put all of our time on the things of the world the pleasures of the world and give no time to God it's true dunk now we find out that we find out that Isaiah got desperate aesthetically and he screamed and confess his sins he confessed the sins of the people and when he got through the confession he heard he heard of a noise up above him and when he looked up there was a chairman flying back and forth through the building Wings Over the face Wings over their feet and flying wings and crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty [Music] and he changed him and God wants for us it's not a subject of how many demonstration of power we come up with or even the knowledge of the word that we have Metheny but it's the question of Christ really in us when we come back to ourselves LED prospects when when we look at our own lives internally when Christ said if I live you shall live also is it really valid for you am I living like Christ wants me to live can I say that Christ can draw the world through me it's an individual question says to accepting God's provided way at the end time I'm not going to try to be long tonight paragraph 174. he was speaking about the baby he said God gave to the baby the only way he can get what he needs is to cry knows God's provided ways the best way they know it says they know no better way for the baby to get what you want than to cry for it used to say the baby that Christ the loudest gets the best service that's about that that's about the way it is it means when we spend more time in prayer we receive more service he says that goes for that goes for the children of of the God's children I could I could I could parallel that for you a man gets up and chew and and say chew chew his gum foreign but if you don't why all right it's your will Lord if you want to give him the Holy Ghost if you want to heal me if you don't give me that it's your will yeah a man says that it's your will it says he says he's done he's done wrote his will out here is he says it's your will that's good it is it says this is his will all right and if you want me to if you want me to have it I'll have it but nevertheless if you don't do it why that's all right you will never get nowhere if you say that you will never get nowhere but let that one made get there and cry out like body Robinson he stopped in the middle of the cornfield he tried up he tied up his music he said Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back you will find a pile of bones I'm going to stay here till I get it that's business and he will do that [Music] you claim the promise he says when I see a promise in the Bible and it's God's word I love you yes then I just stay there and cry out till God gives it to me and he will do that to get me off of his hands hey man you you may get off God's uh you may get off God's hands and you continue to press and God will give it to you cry out to God God will give it to you he will do it so you get off his hands you see that would be in the natural but is wanting you to do that he likes for you to ask abundantly that your joy may be full yes cry until his word is Vindicated now friends observe upon the honest let's watch for a minute now cry until the word is Vindicated me God promise God don't look that in our time is that complete like this impacted us he will fulfill the second purpose of his promise that he would have the preeminence over us that he may Express himself through you and that is for each and every one of us and that is so we can draw men unto him so others can see Christ that they may have hunger and thirst for Christ and so if tonight and I realize that I'm not there yet says let's do like babies let's cry until let's claim the promise until use that Circle until God gives it to us [Music] [Music] so that I can present you to the world Amen foreign he wants to draw the world to him God wants to express himself he wants to draw the world through your life let us stand heads [Music] I have a prayer from Japan I don't I don't I don't want to read it I want a technician in the back as we are close as you close our eyes and do we buy our heads and pray for us in the spoken word is the Original Seed from paragraph 8 through paragraph 13. our heaven [Music] our heavenly father said in your word if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all man unto me and that is our purpose in life is to lift up before a dying generation of people that Jesus Christ is still the Son of God the savior of the world and I'm so happy to know that I live where there is people who believe that and along with the thousands that has accepted him as their savior and knowing that after this life is finished there will be a life on the other side that'll be so glorious that this toils and few hours that we're passing through these Shades and shadows of life here in the testing ground that we are nearly entering into the orbit now waiting for the countdown or sooner or soon there will come a time that when God's time is fulfilled the great arm that's helped back the time so long will finally let go as church will move off from this Earth in space into a land where there'll be no sickness sorrow old age death that's why we are together today Lord is to express our feeling about these things we're so glad to know that this is just not bringing the people together for something in vain that it has been proven the greatest reality the world has ever known amen that the Son of God is not dead who made the promises that's right but is alive Among Us forevermore amen thank you Lord we're so happy this morning Lord above all things though we own the world and could be young for hundreds of years to enjoy it but it would only be a season compared with what's the time it's laid up for those who love him amen so we are trying to point our brother and sister to this great hour that's approaching us and as we see that time coming Lord our hearts burn we want to make ready one by one we go down the lane we just got through burying one from our midst our sister Bell going quickly according to her request so quick we couldn't get to her to pray with her but it was her request to go to see how good that you are to provide all the things that we desire in our hearts you leave none of them you promised it now we pray that you bring Hearts to understand you today those who do not understand you amen thank you bring Sinners to repentance rain sick people to the healing knowledge of God oh God bless your Saints and buying their hearts together yes and as these tapes goes out to the the cities and the churches all out to the Nations around the world May ministering Brethren who has maybe once misunderstood understand now that thought Church might be prepared and now Lord who separated me from my mother who fed me all the days of my life has brought me to this hour by thy Grace feeling it was thy will that I should explain to the people why that I have acted and did the way I have done may it be in such a way that people will have a better understanding lord of the peculiarity of thy servants Grant these things father these scriptures and texts and words that we have written here through the week praying and studying may they fall on good ground ever where they are heard a ground that can hold them and nourish them and then all praise shall be given to thee while we asked it in Jesus name amen Hallelujah I thought if if we were to write a a mission statement you know when a business or a company they have what they call a mission statement the purpose of our our company they call that a mission statement I thought what a mission statement tonight to have Christ Jesus so living out of us that it would draw all men to us and I love the question that brother Paul posed tonight in the wonderful way the Holy Spirit brought it the Holy Spirit changes your nature and if you love the world or the things of the world or having a tremendous trial with the things of the world and and the that you need the Holy Spirit you need the Nature changer you need him to make you like him because we know that's our hope if the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in US it'll Quicken our mortal body and a lot of people say well what's the the rain falls on the just in the unjust and how do I tell the difference well I like the way Paul put it if you go out and you get blessed and then you go back and you're back and then you go out and you get blessed and you go back in your back that's the rain falling on the unjust but when you've had that nature change that's right you know what I mean and you're not the same person you used to be yeah something's happens you know what's happening and you know it's come from the outside and you know he's done it amen then you got your candle lit oh and it's it's wonderful and and if it just really wonderful and he said if you don't don't quit cry out yes cry out Lord I want that Holy Spirit you know I want a nature change if I could just lay that so deep in you that's right I want to change your personality I want to change your heart I want to change your thinking I want the love of God shed abroad in My Heart by the Holy Ghost I want to have overcoming power I want to tell no to the enemy I want to love my brother but I want to I don't want to be bitter I want to be transformed into your enemies that's the spirit of God moving in you and working in you it can tell and his brother Paul preached I just thought that you know when he talked about that salt I felt like sitting at a table eating you know salt brings out the flavor right the Savor that's good it's good and others don't bring out the flavor Chuck the salt but you gotta sprinkle it you know what I mean having it on the table don't do no good you've got to spread it abroad good look that's the script the whole the love of God spread about abroad or sprinkled gripe salt abroad on all those people around you you can ask yourself do I have the Lord in
