well I'm in for a surprise because I don't know what's happening which I've learned that that's a good thing when you're a pastor so we're excited tonight uh a lot of people put a lot of work into it a lot of the Sunday School teachers and the helpers and the kids and the parents and everything we won't take time to name them all this evening but I just think it's wonderful that everybody's participating and that it's such a wonderful blessing so at this time let's just stand together and have a word of prayer and just ask the Lord to bless us and then we'll just turn it over to the kids and let them have this evening to bless us our gracious father you are so wonderful father you have children Lord from all ages and you're the father of us all and we've come at this time of year Lord knowing that you were born with all the Lambs but it's a time that the world at least recognizes that you were born and we're here to celebrate your birth every day is a Christian a Christmas for a believer every day their hearts are full of joy that you give to all as the Angels said joy to all men and peace on Earth and Good Will father because you were born we ask you to bless this evening now and be with us in the Lord Jesus name we pray amen thank you excuse me I need to get in I'm sorry ma'am you can't come in family only how do you know I'm not a part of the family this is the right side Fellowship you aren't wearing a red tie but I'm expected your name Bailey blah Bailey plots let's see Blitz block man blubber sorry no blocks to meet some friends have for dinner sorry ma'am you can't regardless of who your friends are what's wrong with the way I'm dressed the Red Thai Fellowship you need a red tie to come in foreign that's ridiculous it's zero nobody gets in the red tide Fellowship without a red tie I don't have time for this I'll miss my meeting here here this ought to help you look the other way while I slip in you can't buy your way in ma'am I work for the richest man in town bribes mean nothing to me do you know who I am you just said you were Bailey blots have you forgotten who you are no I mean you don't know who you're dealing with I'm friends with the mayor and all the city councilmen know my name so let me in before I'm telling you disrespected me man the owner's richer than all of them and it's no respective persons no amount of contacts can get you in without a red tie nobody gets in the red side Fellowship without a red tie look I can get a red tie later but I need to get in right now friends are probably waiting at the table for me right my friends are probably waiting at the table for me right now go ask them they'll vote for me it won't do you any good ma'am no one inside has any influence on who gets in believe this I really need to meet with these people my financial future you depend on getting this contract won't you give me a break hey I donate to Charities all the time I'll donate to one in the fellowship's name that's very commendable ma'am but it doesn't get you in look I'm just as good as anybody already in there better than some even it's not 50 left others in and keep others out on the contrary arrow is the only fair way to let anyone in it makes everybody Fair since they get in by virtue of wearing the red tie me I'm much stronger than you just try to stop me please don't do that ma'am you only hurt yourself nobody has ever gotten around me past me or through me no kidding you're like running into a solid stone wall what do I have to do to get in nobody gets in the red so without a red tie yeah again you're real big on repeating that one thanks for nothing pal Haven't Seen the Last of Me Mr high and mighty doorman [Music] foreign not you ma'am you can't get in the cocktails of others Well you Can't Blame a Girl for Trying can you it's been tried before ma'am and doesn't think we're looking for a back door in this is the only way in well thanks for the tip but you won't be getting one from me I need a red tie how do I get one real quick huh if I can't find one make one myself ah a just ought to get me in hope nobody smells me though this old piece of crummy cloth really stinks hey man kept the rules I've got a red tie I'm gonna hardly call that a proper time ma'am hey I made it myself that I'll just show you I'm trying even more than if I went out and bought one because of my effort to keep the rules count for anything ma'am that rag is filthy and smelly all it does is your inability to abide by the rule your own efforts count for nothing all right I've had it what's your name Mister D law man spell that for me d-e-o-a-w all right I'm reporting you to the manager I'll have Justice it's Mercy Dean ma'am not just this we'll see get me the owner or manager I want to speak to him very well are you the owner my father's the owner I'm the manager to get you must first go through me Bailey this is Mr King the manager of the red tie Fellowship Mr King this is Miss Bailey blotz she has a complaint she'd like to speak with you about pleasure to meet some spots how can I help you thank you for coming out to me since I couldn't come where you were I'm happy to do it and that's the problem I can't seem to get past d-law here under any circumstances the art can be event too many at times but that's his job he must enforce the rules to the letter and keep out those who don't meet the requirements but I can't meet the requirements and I need to get in you you're the manager will you please tell him to let me in well Bailey I can't let someone in who don't meet the standards that being fair to those already in he did but you run the place you write the rules yes and I must stick by them nobody gets in the red tie Fellowship without a red tie how can I get one can you loan me one no we don't loan them can I pound from you you couldn't possibly pay what it's worth this is insane how does one get into your fellowship if I can't if you can't loan me one and I can't buy one from you or anyone else then what do I do you must simply ask ask that's all that's it wait a minute can't be that easy not not after all that these red ties are too costly just to be free true they are not free a high price just paid for them but I am paying it and giving it to those that ask as a gift it's too easy there must be a catch I don't believe it well you must believe it if well you must believe it if you're to ask and receive it otherwise you'll never ask if getting a tie is so easy why d-law here just offer me one he could have gotten me in right away Gila has no ties to give all he can do is tell you that you need one I'm the only one that can give you what you need to get into my fellowship to ask and you will receive don't you want to check my background see if I'm worthy or something your background doesn't matter what you mean it's forgotten how can you build a brighter future is my plan once in my fellowship will affect you that will affect the dealings with others sounds too good to pass up but almost too good to be true [Music] alright I give up may I have one of your red ties please I'd like to be in fellowship with you of course Billy but once in you're not just part of the fellowship you're part of the family foreign [Music] this is the beginning of a wonderful relationship thanks so much now everyone will know I'm a part of the Great Fellowship I'll wear it with pride not Pride baby where's Joy then everyone will ask where you got it from and then you can introduce them to me they can get a red tie of Their Own that sounds great I'll do it coming in baby your friends are waiting welcome Miss Blatt enjoy [Music] that have gotten trouble they had to follow the cloud of Fire the pillar of fire that's left they followed that and that the church tonight will only follow the pillar of fire the Holy Spirit you'll make pain God has a way of providing ways there's two ways a man can go and that's his way or God's way and that's the right way or the wrong way and your way is always the wrong way and God's way is the right way and you can't be in your own way in God's way at the same time so you got to get out of your own way so God can have his way for you that's right God makes a provided way foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] that our voices [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] anymore [Music] [Applause] [Music] let your words [Music] in the maker of my heart [Music] I just feel this way [Music] let your words [Music] [Applause] [Music] every day my heart inside this house [Music] God let your words [Music] [Music] testing [Music] it's not just about the manger where the baby lay it's not all about the Angels who sang for him that day it's not all about the Shepherds or the bride and shining stars foreign [Music] [Music] let's roll away [Music] so that you and I could have realized someday it's not all about the good things in this life I've done it's not all about the treasures or the trophies that I've won it's not about the righteousness that I find Within it's all about his Precious Blood that saved me from my sins [Music] [Music] so that you and I could have realized the beginning of the stories [Music] out the cross it's about my sins [Music] it's about the Stars [Music] so that you wish [Music] [Music] that Jesus Christ is born [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] how praise [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my God Let Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ and I feel us foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] amen I didn't know what to expect I I I have one question though how did you figure out who's going to beat the law and who is going to be the king
