where i am [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] hallelujah amen that's not your desire this morning they may cover us all our entire lives amen regardless of where we are we need this covering amen but a daniel poe if we could just come and open our service and pray [Music] heavenly father we thank you for this day this is the day you have made we so happy to be here father forever going on with the world but we are your children not any children father but children of the promises we can live through the promises that you say you will be with us [Music] father we have believe in your word [Music] it's only your word that can take us to whether we trust me our protection is in you everything we can just say that now father is to present your name for your god that never change [Music] father men can change [Music] but in you there is not even a little bit of change the way you bless in the years past is the same way you are blessing us now we have no doubt in our heart that you are at our side we are your children father come and commune with us father you know each heart here we pray that you may cover us through the blood of jesus christ father we are the result of that blood if it wasn't for the blood father what could you say at this time we thank you for the very life of god that you have given to die at the cross so that we may have this very life father come speak with us we need your word this time first we commit the service from the something from everything we will do here father we just want to do it for your glory the purpose of you even coming in this last age father is for your glory to be yours and you alone bless us together fathers we start with you in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen good to be gathered in the house of god this morning amen i trust you're excited to be here you know the scripture says i was happy when they say unto me let's go in the house of the lord amen welcome all our visitors as you invite porter mike for so i'm reading this morning amen god bless you good morning going uh going to turn to psalm 66 this morning give the sound system a minute to calm down you know this scripture begins with the verse it should be familiar to all of us it says make a joyful noise unto god all ye lands sing forth the honor of his name and make his praise glorious say unto god how terrible or awesome art thou in thy works through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit thyselves themselves unto thee such wonderful words of praise and i was thinking as i was reading that you know passages like this are commonly used in worship services throughout the land really you know as praise leaders rally the people into a spirit of praise and celebration their call to worship make a joyful noise unto the lord praise because they are in church you know while you know this is certainly a call to praise there's another interesting verse not too many verses down that seems like it's kind of in an odd place considering this call to worship this call to praise and it's verse 18 it says if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me you know it's kind of a sobering reminder sure but it seems so out of place with this chapter that would seem to call all people to praise you know it's uh we tend to look at that verse and think that it refers just a prayer you know and certainly that's true i mean james said that ye ask and receive not because he asked amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts but this particular chapter is also speaking of praise if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me you know there's praise that the lord will not hear just as there's prayer that the lord will not hear why if i regard iniquity in my heart what is iniquity the first time it's mentioned is often a clue what the definition is it's in isaiah 53 6. it's turning everyone to his own way doing your own thing is iniquity your own way of prayer asking amiss your own way of praise praising amiss you know it's uh often that people come to church and they praise because it seems like it's the right thing to do they're in church you praise when you're in church you praise because you enjoy it or it feels good or it sounds good or it really hasn't been a decent service if there hasn't been praise if i regard iniquity of my heart it doesn't matter how much praise you do it's not about you it's not about how you feel it is not about the work you perform you know it's uh it's interesting that there is a verse right after that if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me it's verse 17. it says but verily god hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of my prayer you know the chapter closes with a little bit of a different tone than it opens it says blessed be god which hath not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me see the difference between prayer that is heard or praise that is heard and praise that is not heard is who is doing the work you see because acceptable praise is the result of a work that god has done but praise is not a work that you do and many go to church praising because it's the work that you do in church but praise is what you do because of the work he has done for you amen you know praise is iniquity when you do it because it feels good because you enjoy it because it sounds good because you're in church and it's the right thing to do because it's not it's not a good service if we don't praise that's all iniquity that's you doing your own way all right but when it's the result of his work you know it's uh the question is really has he done a work for you that's the real question and it's so funny when you listen to some of these worship services that go out in the land where there's this great call to make a joyful noise and at no point in time where there'll be a challenge or a testimony of the work that god has done for them individually it's just praise him for his mighty works well what work has he done for you and on that are silent acceptable praise is when it's based on a work that he has done for you as we read further into psalm 66 you know just think about it the individual personal experience is his acceptable praise if god ever came by and did something for you met your need spoke to you in your dark hour touched you you have a basis of praise you read further in psalm 66 notice what it says verse 5 come and see the works of the lord praise is a testimony your testimony of the works god has done for you you know something you've personally experienced not something you've heard about but something you've seen something you've experienced just even as you read through some of these works which holdeth our soul in life and suffereth not our feet to be moved the fact that your soul has been quickens to life and that you recognize that he has continued to hold you you have a basis of praise amen he has touched you you know it says that for thou o god has proved us thou has tried us as silver is tried if there's anyone in here come on that feels like they're being proved or have been proved and tried that's the hand of god on you you have a basis for praise you know it says in verse 12 we went through fire and through water but thou brought us us out into a wealthy place if you've ever felt him reach down and lift you up and put you in a wealthy place he's touched you personally you have a basis of praise it says in verse 16 come and hear all that fear god and i will declare what he hath done for my soul praise a testimony of what he has done for you not praise because it feels good not praise because you enjoy it not praise because it's the right thing to do in church not even because you believe that a true good church service hasn't happened if there hasn't been praise that's all iniquity and oh by the way you don't even have to be in church to do this praise as a result of his work not because of where you're at so it's important as we read that this morning make a joyful noise unto the lord that the basis for doing that is his hand on you let's read psalm 66 this morning starting in verse 1 make a joyful noise unto god all ye land sing forth the honor of his name make his praise glorious say unto god how terrible art thou in thy works through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee all the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee they shall sing to thy name selah come and see the works of god he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men he turneth the sea into dry land they went through the flood on foot there did we rejoice in him he ruleth by his power forever his eyes behold the nations let not the rebellious exalt themselves selah o bless our god ye people and make the voice of his praise to be heard which holdeth our soul and life and suffereth not our feet to be moved for thou o god has proved us thou hast tried us as silver has tried thou brought us thus into the net thou laid its affliction upon our loins thou hast caused men to ride over our heads we went through fire and through water but thou brought us us out into a wealthy place i will go into thy house with burnt offerings i will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered and my mouth hath spoken when i was in trouble i will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the incense of rams i will offer bullocks with goats selah come and hear all ye that fear god and i will declare what he hath done for my soul i cried unto him with my mouth and he was extolled with my tongue if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me but verily god hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of my prayer blessed be god which hath not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me amen remaining harmony the lord has done something for this morning hey man you may have a few seats this morning amen amen let's sing give me that old time religion oh it's the whole

attitudes so many things pulling one way or the other [Music] so many things trying to captivate our minds for the battle is for our mind and in our mind through it all this confusion of what we call civilization and education and science there's still one truth there's still one god there's still one way and one life and we're here this morning father with our hearts desiring that your spirit would come and make more clear to us that way that we would increase in revelation and understanding of your will that we would grow in the knowledge of the power that you have and father how that that power can come in and rule in our lives we just ask you to bless us this morning father we also ask you to show your mercy on us and forgive us father for we're weak lord and we're made in flesh and shaped in sin and we came into this world speaking lies but through your love for us you've redeemed us and you're building in us a statue of a perfect man and capping us off with the capstone of your love father we want to grow into our heritage this morning we ask you to bless us in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen and amen god bless you this morning while you're standing let's open our bibles to we welcome any visitors that we have with us this morning and just trust that something that's said in the word of god today will help you and your life and you'll be blessed and and god's word will continue to grow let's turn over the scripture we've been reading it quite a bit these last few services and as we continue on our subject matter that we've been talking we don't necessarily call it a series by any means but you know this morning we're just we just want to talk about uh the coming together of the mechanics and the dynamics and and um and really what makes the church uh what she's supposed to be and uh it's hard to stay in god's plan and just let him to bring it to pass but we trust we can do that romans the 8th chapter and the 11th verse because this is what we are desiring and talking about this morning of taking possession of so we're talking about taking possession of a promise something that we know about that we've been told about that we're even been told as is ours and and this the difference between believing it and then taking hold of it and actually having it faith is a substance amen it's not a hope you know it's a substance of things that you used to hope for or you used to believe for that and then that hope that mechanic comes in to possession and you actually have it and then it becomes a dynamic so let us read here but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwelling you so that that's this is our key that we've got to have that same spirit that dwelt in him dwelling in us he he that raised up christ from the dead also he said if it if but if the same spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in his precious name we pray amen amen so you may be seated thank you i i better do something i wanted to read a quote off of my phone but i i don't know these things very well so i'm i just turned down the sound so i hope it doesn't vibrate i don't know how to read on the phone without having it on and i don't know if you can turn off phone calls or not so i don't know whoever invented these things spent a lot of time trying to make it difficult i'm surely that i'm sure they didn't have me in their mind when when they made it but we want to review a little bit this morning we're going to play another 11 minutes this morning and i hope that you have maybe went ahead and got one of your on your phone or whatever instrument that you use i like the books myself personally i i like to have them i like to go through them and and you know mark them up and just until every line is colored with a marker and every word has a underline under it as it as it becomes alive but you know it that you would have joined in with us on this study because you know you know that we're we're reading for and and gleaning if you could say the many nuggets and and truths that are hid within this great sermon that our messenger preached to us and this is a wonderful message it has a key like you know you know that the word of god is like a key uh we heard the sermon a door within a door and and you have the key that opens that door and so as you're going through life's journey maybe through school or when where you start to come in life and and of course the enemy comes in in your early teenage years your body's developing getting its different uh separations of of feelings and emotions and and the enemy comes in and then he offers you choices he he presents you stuff and presents you thinking and present you thoughts and and and emotions in in your flesh and you're caught in a battleground where where you all of a sudden there's you realize there's another force in another spirit in the world and it's beckoning you and it's calling you and and it begins to work in your mind with reason and and you have five senses now that are activated you see things that you've never seen before you feel things that you've never felt before and you're you're in this emotional turmoil and this turmoil of the five senses and then you begin to develop feelings you know what i mean you get your feelings hurt and and then you start protecting your feelings and you're caught up and yet all this time there's another force that's trying to captivate you and draw you in and make you a part of his kingdom and it's slavery you know he he's got to keep his great machine going and so he'll try to he'll get you in a walk of life and he'll you'll labor and you'll work and then you'll you'll uh you know try to achieve and he's always hanging a carrot above to your nose and and then if life is hard and there's struggles there well then he's got drugs and alcohol and all kinds of things to try to make life easier on you and and people just don't know where they're going they don't know what the end of the matter is and so now we have a wonderful wonderful gospel that it comes to tell us what the truth is and set us free from the captivation of the world and the wages of sin is death and you got the the definition of death is not going to a graveyard and and just laying somebody to rest as we would say i just got back this friday i flew to missouri to do a funeral for a sister and and you know a wonderful testimony wonderful sister and we've committed her back to the earth because that's where she came from but that's not death because she didn't die because she had life death is eternal separation from god that's what death is you know and that that's what hell is hell is the consuming fire that separates you from god for eternity until you're not that's death not this 70 years 80 years that god gives us or how many it ever years that he allots us and then our spirit leaves this body and this body they put it in a box and and maybe if you're fortunate somebody missed you you know others might be singing thank the lord you're dead this is the happiest day in my life you know it's the nicest thing you ever did for me was die you know but that's not what this is all about so we've got to rise above this flesh we've got to rise above this uh our our carnal mind because the carnal mind and the fleshly mind is at enmity with god in other words it's at a it's in a battle with god it's warring against god it's it it's kicking against the prick it's fighting against what god's real plan is for our lives so you can't think carnally and get anywhere with god you've got to we got to continually shake that carnal mind off of us we've got to continually shake the worldly thinking off of us education knowledge science politics uh opinions we've got to continually fight those out of our lives and the way we fight those out of our lives is with the washing of the water of god's word that's what cleanses us that's why you read your bible that's why you pray that's why you uh place yourself in a sermon study and and get into the presence of the lord it is to wash you to wash you clean to set to what it would what do they call it a reset to reset your mind i think they call it sometimes refocusing to refocus to get back in line with what is the real objective here [Music] what is the real plan here what is the real goal here what is the real end here um i know that we we have a natural survival tendency so we want to eat you know even our messenger told us he said when a man gets hungry enough he'll eat anything you know we're very fortunate that we haven't come to that place yet but you know it's going to be a real test one of these days i think we're just entering into the testing ground now people said well when people became critics of the message they thought that was the great falling away no i think the great falling away has hasn't even really begun yet because it's going to be so personal i think we're going to be forced with such great personal challenges and such pressure financially and mentally to just to give up you know what i mean and quit the pursuit and quit the fight that it's going to be so hard to hang on and he's just going to try to press it down to where there's such a few but now is when we need to fortify ourselves and and to make sure that we're driving that race not right out on the edge but pull right back out close to the mountain and drive as close to the word of god as we can so as we talk about this great review the ultimate end of the believer is the reward we are living in rapture time now some of us i hope i'm here for the rapture i had a a a greater hope of that when i was 20 years old than i do when i'm 72 years old you know sitting here this morning i could look down the road and i could look at my friends that have passed away at 80 and 82 and 78 and and and you know 85 86 and i sit back well that's 10 years and i could actually sit here and think i might by the grace of god have 10 more years 15 more years 15 year years from now i'd be 87 years old that is not very law amen each precious moment you know becomes precious and i trust that god will will place his spirit in my heart and in my mind and get my mind on the right things so that the time that i'm allotted is allotted for him now that's the way an old man looks at it but a young person ought to look at it like this he may come any day now physically i might be able to live another 150 years but this world may not have 50 years this life may not have 50 years you may not have 50 years let alone how many young people are are i lose their lives every year to many different circumstances sicknesses death heart attacks all kinds of things we don't know the time that we've got allotted but we ought to take heed that what we're working for is to make that rapture don't let satan try to talk you out of it that there's no such thing one of the very first lies he tells is that he don't exist i'm not for real anyway some i don't know who caused all this sin and misery and sickness and death but he don't take credit for it even though he's the cause of it so we understand that we're pursuing something here this morning and we have a revelation that god had a plan in the beginning amen and he has an elect people a people that were a part of him in the beginning and those people are possessors of eternal life and their possessors of eternal life is because god knew them in his heart and in his mind from the beginning so we read here if i could read this he said he's talking about when he was in arizona and in the great cloud that we have a picture here of came down and he got caught up in the vision and and he said and so there he spoke to me and said the seven seals will be open the seven mysteries and this is in paragraph twelve the the seven mysteries seven-fold mysteries of the bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed now think of the day that you're living in how blessed and privileged you are to be in a time and an age when things that were in the bible but they were hid and there was mysteries that were hid since the foundation of the world and you are the people that has been chosen for him to reveal that to you everybody had that opportunity but god provided a way that he was going to do it and that way was that he was going to reveal these mysteries through the ministry of the son of man in other words he was going to be the one that opened this mystery he was going to be the one that revealed it but he would choose a chosen vessel a man that had the ministry of being a prophet in other words he could hear from god lift a ear god could show him things without driving them totally insane how would you like an angel to appear to you you know i'd like an angel of hearing i'll guarantee you'd probably find yourself in the nut house because every single devil would say oh you're insane you're just saying you're that and then how would you like to go tell somebody let's have a mini taste test of faith i just come out of my office and i say an angel just appeared to me and billy a real man a real angel i really saw him and this is what he told me i know you i've worked with you ain't no angel ever talked to you when you were working with me you know what i mean the first thing would be there be a doubt i mean just think of it why did you believe it you know okay and and so i i'm just sitting here just figure we got 2 000 people here i don't know why i'm going down this road but i am and it and i look over there and i say you right there with that little boy on you not quite sleeping but anyway and you know you've done this and this and you're from here you think everybody believed it at the same time there was soo sayer fortune teller oh it's fixed it's planned the usher put him there i saw the usher see them there it's a gimmick it's a thing how would you like to face all that stuff no a prophet's made a certain way he's made to hear and handle the word of god it's a special being a special person he's got a special way in fact it's so much so that even the formation of his mouth was by god that he could speak the words just the way he speaks the sentence construction even of the words that the sentences that he's spoken is so designed to connect so there's an elected people here a chosen people and we we understand you've got to understand that you are that people. that's why the scripture says that who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect why because the seed of god remaineth in them satan may trick you he may trap you you may stumble you may fall but he'll send that word to contact that seed and to bring you back to repentance so we find out that the that there's this special being was brought in at a special time under a special sign under a special astrological sign all all things perfectly planned according to god and he said that was that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings hearing those mysteries praise god thank you lord why you i don't know why me i certainly don't know he didn't have to do it but he did so don't let the world talk you out of your privilege and your blessing tell me what the world has to offer you back in the old days maybe they'd offer you a horse and buggy or if you if you took this job or you get something i'll give you a horse how many would like a horse today a horse is a liability it's an expense it costs you nobody wants a horse but that was a big blessing you got hung on the spot if you stole the man's heart see the world changes there's only one thing that doesn't change and that's god's word that's god's plan that's what remains the same so we gotta reass we gotta have a reset we've got to have a refocus we've got to have a shaking we've got to come back to a real a reality of what's real this world is not real it's not real because it's ever changing and now it's out of control and doesn't even know where it's going the world's looking for a savior that's going to come and straighten it all out and it's going to get one and it's going to be the antichrist and people will be serving satan thinking they're serving god they're thinking they're going to say oh finally peace and prosperity and then come sudden destruction you don't understand what a wonderful repeat that we're in right now the prophet of god when he brought this message what was he talking about the nuclear bombs remember he said watch russia watch russia what's everybody doing right now they're all watching russia russia russia russia russia russia you know what scares me brother tim's what the catholic church is doing behind the scene i think there is just a little meeting here pope getting involved you know who holds the world economy yeah people want bailing out you know who can bail them out is the vatican there's no telling what's going on but we don't have to worry about all that [Music] what we have to worry about is my sheep hear my and another they will not follow my sheep hear my voice so here we are we're this privileged little hunger group hearing those mysteries hearing that voice hearing the voice that is telling us what is truth remember modern events are made clear by prophecy modern events don't don't bring the prophecy to pass the prophecy already told you what the modern events will be and our messenger already told us that the mess that this world would be in we're not surprised he told us about the homosexual spirit when it was still in the closet but what do they call it coming out coming out of the closet well we knew you were in there right we were expecting you because the prophet told us as it was in the days of sodom and gomorrah so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man it doesn't matter what god did back 20 years ago it's the revealing of the son of man to you as a person deity in flesh deity in your flesh is the revelation of the son of man marriage and divorce serpent seed all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself that's opened those seven mysteries now the seven mysteries of what of what the church was so what was she she was the female part of adam it's what she was the bride she's separated from adam that's why the first adam was a living soul the second adam is a what a quickening spirit what's he going to quicken he's going to quicken his female part his bride back to life oh this is good if i could stand to look at myself i'd preach in the mirror that opened those missions of what the church was so what she was okay how it was in christ at the beginning okay we've been through those now this is actually what's going on right now if i could say it this way and how it would be revealed in the last days so how is this church going to be revealed in the last day how is this bride going to be quick and delight now and i don't just mean made alive you're all breathing i think you know i mean there's some people that are dead while they live but i don't want to be in that group do you but brought to life not living because there was a book that held people that were living that were alive they're alive they don't have nothing to do with god they're alive they live they work they eat they go to sleep they're going to die and and what their judgment is not mine to make but there's another people that are alive because they've come to the realization and the full understanding of where they come from who they are and where they're going now those people are really alive because they already know their future you know your end you are already sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus you're not going to live you live now you possess eternal life you know you have a place at the wedding supper you are alive that's right because there is no doubt of your future amen in fact you know where you're going and you know you're going to get there because he said so think of it that's the lamb's book of life those are those that what had eternal life if you have eternal life you what always had eternal life why because your name was on the lamb's book of life nothing can put it on there nothing can take it off i've looked at my life and i'm ashamed of it but a lot of my life has been an effort to take my name off the lamb's book of life but he said it that settled it the gift of god is eternal life lest any man should boast he settled it before i could mess it up think of it and then he will do whatever he has to do to bring your life into conformance with his perfect will no matter how many times you take his permissive will how many time you turn down his advice how many time you put against the holy spirit he will win i read the back of the book and we win so now he's revealing her or bringing her to life or resurrecting her what a resurrection that was when he came out of the grave what a resurrection this is of the bride rising up in this last days out of a dead denominational worldly system and rising to life by the hearing of the word of god jesus had the power in him not only to turn water into wine feed thou five thousands with a few loaves and fishes heal the blind the lame the leopard raise the dead but raise himself from the dead the first fruits of somebody coming up from the dead even though he typed it in many so a few others in the bible that came to life but he had to lay it in shadow so we could recognize it in the flesh now he's going to share that power and life the same life and power that raised him from the dead that he possessed to do all those works all those signs and wonders even to the place of laying his life down and taking it up again whatever that power was that spirit that ability which is beyond our comprehension [Music] he came and went to calvary that the chastisement or the punishment of our sins would be on him so he paid the price of what you did wrong you stole the you you stole the cookie out of the cookie jar and you would get your little hand slap he put his hand there the father was going to give you a whooping for stealing that and drinking and getting drunk and smoking and wrecking the car and lusting and doing all the other stuff that we do gossip and god's ready to give you a weapon he steps in he takes the chastisement he takes the punishment he pays the price now therefore that cannot be laid on you because he already took it and if he could lay down on you that means that the punishment that he took was ineffective no good and didn't accomplish anything why do you punish yourself we have not because we believe not and we ask not and we ask not because we believe not you got guilt ask him to get rid of it he already took it you're not asking for the guilt to go away what you're asking for is a revelation of what that he's done for you beautiful hallelujah just to think a wretch like me a dog worse than snail trail that's how low he loved came and died that not one of those sins would be put on your record and when god pulls your name out he don't see red he don't see nothing he sees white because he's looking through the blood of his son and red on red makes white really put white next one white why because of the calvary now that would have been good right at least our sins were forgiven but what good of it do if we remained in the grave what does it do if you have no hope we do not sorrow as others do that have no hope but we know that we too will be changed in the twinkling of an eye to get meet the lord in the air brethren i would not have you be ignorant of them which are asleep oh let's read it oh that's good that thessalonians i think is second second thessalonians 4. we ought to just read that that's just how there is to it 413. this is nowhere near my notes and we're going to play 11 minutes i don't know what's happening with me but i would not have you be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and arose again even so then also them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for as we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them that are asleep hallelujah whether i go by the grave whether i go by any other means i don't care because i still live we got these promises on both sides of the river isn't it wonderful for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven oh my you just want to jump right into the rapture tape right now with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first you know there's a lot of dead people in christ that are alive and there is a resurrection going on right now in a rapture right now of bringing people that are in the darkness of their minds in the darkness of sin in the darkness of denomination who have no idea they're the elect lady bride of christ part of the rapture and those people right now are being resurrected by the word that was spoken through the mouth of malachi 4 5. it's a resurrection happening right now you may be coming to life this morning in the battle of your mind right now you may be considering for the first time that you need to have a life that's totally committed to the rapture and you're going to resurrect out of your habits you're going to resurrect out of your darkness you're going to resurrect into life and liberty in christ jesus and be filled with the spirit that is a resurrection that's this resurrection but there's also those that have gone on before then we which are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord now that power that brought him out he's going to share this power with his bride and this is a lot more teaching but the bride so the life that was in him just like it was in eve that life came out of adam eve's life came out of adam so this eve's if life understand the second adam is a what a quickening spirit so now he has the spirit oh i hope i can say this right to put the life right back in eve that's right and you didn't sin eeps sinned but adam went out after her as a living soul do you know that jesus was the son that eve would have had if she waited everybody we would have been here how was how was jesus made not by any part of mary not by any part of joseph but it was spoken in the life that's exactly what would have happened to eve every predestinated son would have come in the perfect plan of god by spoken word and it would have been formed out of the earth and brought into existence the birth pains natural birth pains was part of the curse if it would have come the other way it wouldn't have been that way i'm helpless this morning so so we understand that that that this spirit now returns back on the bride you say well the baptism no this is above the baptism of the holy ghost this is above anointed ones at the end time this is above the rain falling on the just and the unjust this is eve the bride receiving the same life that was in christ you've got to take it above the baptism of the holy ghost what the world calls the baptism the holy ghost the restoration of gifts the emotional shouting the speaking in tongues this is something that's beyond that this is the restoration of the bride the restoration of the bride tree this is the restoration of the path of life that was in the beginning so when we get back to eden we will resume the plan that god had for us in the beginning we just dropped down here for a little time so god can reveal to us all his other attributes so that's right the same life that the second adam had the power to bring eve back to life is waved over the people again through revelations 17 and 30. and so that's just a quick review and we realized that that life is what raised him up he is now a quickening spirit the rain's going to fall on the unjust in everything the spirit's going to go out and it's going to fall on people and they're going to rejoice but what are they they are anointed ones at the end time the anointing is right but they don't have the seed they don't have the bright inheritance gene of god and this ministry only brings to life the gene seed of god the bride now that bride is going to be brought to life that is the resurrection of the bride the quickening spirit this spirit that can take you out of the human being that you are he became you that you might become him we are still afraid to take our rightful position in the lord jesus today this morning myself included are still sitting here with a cloud of doubt and confusion that's keeping me from being a messiah to taking my rightful position that i am the son of god as he is so am i amen right now there's only one thing that can do that that's a spark it's a quickening power it's a power that comes and turns all the mechanics on okay this is where we're picking up so let we're just going to have a communion service tonight just communion and foot washing i would like your feedback on that if you if you like doing it that way trying it for a few times so you can sit there i like this instead of having a long song service 45 minutes to hour of preaching foot washing and everything that we come just for foot washing and then for those of you that want to have communion or foot washing that can't come to service we're going to try to work out a way that we can bring that to you okay so now we've just talked about how far we've got now the prophet of god is going to give us a warning this next 11 minutes is a a warning and an instruction of the trap that the church falls into okay and that trap is called mechanics so let's just listen to 11 minutes we'll close up with a little uh continuation of our study and so remember the reason that we're sitting here this morning is hearing this word is we want a clear revelation and leadership of god's word and then as soon as we close up a sister zoe he wants to be baptized this morning so we'll let her have her chance to join the fellowship all right lord richly bless you we're going to start in paragraph 103 and that's where we closed last week that the only way this quickening power can come is through malachi 4 5 luke 17. anybody that doesn't accept the spark from that ministry will never be quickened amen and don't start asking yourself oh what about people that never heard what about all this what about it you know what is it to you if he carries till i come follow without me amen lord bless you this next 11 minutes thank you brother mike god bless you no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the bible until that wave sheath until that holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move we put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics we need the dominant power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest him and to bring to pass that this is gasoline it might be in a gasoline can it should still be water see but the only proof of it is put this life on it and it will prove worse gasps and when you try to put the holy spirit in the denomination you're as much as try you can get a splatter you'll ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon but all i'm so fast that there is a ten thousand power the word of god and a holy ghost tied it up and to resurrect the power of god into a man's life or a woman's life are into a church that shoved that cadillac down the road on the dynamic power of the holy ghost which came back to us waved over the people at the day of pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever that was the first sheep come up from all the prophets which was the son of god the king of all prophets there's been churches churches brides brides churches rise brides but there's got to come one hallelujah that has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamic shut [Music] up the church live in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simoniz job when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be a dynamic to make it work that's what he proved hallelujah that's what easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was god himself the dynamics in the word pain the body of jesus christ whole stepping dead in the grave shaking the life and rise again and roll away i am he that was dead so dead till the sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics god's word he was a dynamic to prove it and is he being the group the bride has to come forth because this part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and the others that spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it's just something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken his spirit defending his spirit coming the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him had put it together and made mechanics and dynamics until the church or the people all these easter bunnies and ceremonies and big churches and pirates will fail and pass away until that church become both time and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so hey why is that in john 14 12. he that was he before me the words that i do shall he you also give him a charge of my dynamics and his mechanics that's the world when i'll be able to withstand it and i'll raise him up again at the last day hallelujah all right that's the easter egg the time and the mechanics together the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up down all you want to and deny this word amen amen they won't do any good you're just cranking around them the pistons have got sparked out of fire but no gas need to far back it'll only work as they come together amen so one will set steel and the other will go up that's the only thing there is to it yes they both might look like both claim to be churches no claim to be bribed but one has mechanics and it brings it to pass but what he said is the truth it just won't no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics comes a time and it comes that bar is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that exposures it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion ever moves or he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of god but with the dynamics notice it's the spirits that quit it's the it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's a spark that fires the gas you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the words the father living father sent me so send i you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything i do only that which is pleasing to god now as he sent me so saying it was the same mechanics and it takes the same dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the dynamics will take its place paul said the gospel came to us not in word only through gasoline only but through spark also to make it move it came to us in that manner it's the same spirit that raised him up that quickened the true believer to eternal life i remember potentially now watch as we are getting out of our time notice the same spirit now romans 8 1. let's just read that again in romans 8 1 and we'll see what that says all right and not romans i mean 8 11 i'm sorry and romans 8 11. but if there's a problem there's a sketch but if the spirit of him god the holy spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwelt in you oh there you are if the bridegroom spirit dwells in the bride when god made his first bride grew he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit forming in the dust of the earth and making material and notice when he made e from adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word or adam was a spoken word you see he took from him and then taken the he had masculine and feminist spirit and he took the feminist spirit away from adam and placed it in eaves who are still part of adam's fence is adam's flesh then it was adam's spirit the dynamic that quickened the mechanics of his body so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones then how is this mortal flesh go become his flesh we'll get to it how is it done how what is this great transformation notice now if the spirit of him god that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you oh the predestinated ones of course like the seed laid up on the earth the one that had life and many of them are dead they were just rotten seeds but waters and things burn them out but you know there was a seed laying there ready for life god knowed it was laying there now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the holy spirit comes to claim its own how this is deep now be sure to catch this good now as the sun was sent across the earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to lie it was not to bring all the dirt to the knife but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around the line not all men will receive christ oh no but those which god foreordained life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's when it comes to quicken they're the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the sun and say oh this old sun's so hot that rock said there's no sun so hot but that little seed said that's what i'm looking for and it began to spring forth the line it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to quicken the rock not to quicken the dirt but to quicken the life of the seed now the holy spirit comes now of course it wasn't set why won't all the people receive it it wasn't said to god told me i don't believe i don't care what you say if you can raise up the dead or anything and heal the sick and prove it anyway i still don't believe that this turn on your unbelievers it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't sent to you it's said to those who will believe the message is to the believer to them that perish is foolishness but to them that are in christ and part of that seed is life now how many days do you think we could spend on that 11 minutes going in how you're part of the earth and the earth's in you and how you were quickened but and maybe we'll go back over that again but this just in closing this morning it's 12 o'clock we'll be out a shorter service tonight and anything and i i just spent eight hours in the airport uh yesterday because my flight was canceled and so i had plenty of time to study so i had prepared about a four and a half hour sermon but i just want to bring this point to you in closing so much more i want to go into but i'll just close this because i'm really excited about zoe getting baptized so those that have to go as soon as we get to that point you are dismissed uh you can go and those that would like to stay if you want to move closer or whatever be a glorious and so we'll do this great thing now he said now there's too much emphasis put on the mechanics now how does that apply to us we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics it needs a dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is the word so every time he says gasoline you you say word the word so everybody claims to have the word but there's only one thing that can prove that it's word it isn't the testimony that it's word i could have a bucket of water a bucket of diesel fuel and a bucket of gasoline how many knows what would happen if i lit a match and threw it on diesel fuel nothing because it's got to be put under pressure and turned into vapor and all the diesel mechanics no it takes a while it wouldn't flash it wouldn't blow up if i threw it on water it wouldn't fly but if you throw it on gasoline you're gonna know it's gasoline because it's gonna manifest the dynamics of gasoline so now you understand the dynamics what is the dynamics of something in other words what is what is the dynamics of of dynamite what is the dynamics of this what is the dynamics of that if the dynamics is what that produces is its dynamics it becomes the definition it's the result of what that it is so when you put the word or the dynamics on the word it'll prove its word by the dynamics that it produces give you an example stand up billy i'm a christian i've got the love of jesus in my heart i only read the red letters don't tell me about nothing it's just jesus jesus is so good jesus is so sweet i'm just you glory hallelujah praise god glory hallelujah now give me a little slap on the cheek i'm gonna rip you apart you dude now that's the dynamics of what that i really am but when you got the dynamics you don't have to go around saying you're a christian i just walked up to billy and billy slaps me oh oh oh i forgive you brother 70 times 70. oh i want you to know that jesus i know hallelujah dynamics that really proves it's the word now you can put music on me right that's music on me you can put an anointing on me glory to god hallelujah praise god right isn't that what he said i don't care how much you shout how much you jump you know it doesn't mean nothing so one of the first things we've got to understand is an understanding of what the mechanics is because he said we put too much emphasis on the mechanics do you think the baptists are putting emphasis on mechanics no they're not putting i think the catholics are putting emphasis on mechanics no so let's just take a quick look and then we'll close of what the mechanics are the revelation of the godhead is a mechanic it's the mechanics water baptism mechanics church order being here 30 minutes early praying for the service coming prepared not staying up until 12 o'clock playing a game because you've got service in the morning knowing you've got something to contribute reading your bibles trying to catch the mind of the spirit trying to fit into the anointing of the spirit that's why we don't want you when we the minute we call for the musicians that's when the spirit comes after the word the prophet of god taught that part of the mechanics getting up unsensitive to the spirit just walking out maybe walking by somebody that god's dealing with their heart mechanics dress code mechanics the the seals that's mechanics church ages mechanics divine healing mechanics all all that is is the mechanics of the word of god you understand the that it's the the reason it's the mechanics is because it's the truth you understand it's the true revelation of god's word the mechanics it's got to be the truth so the mechanics has got to be in place all of it so he uses a car as a kind of a type to draw a visual that if the wheels are off the car it's not going to roll if you can't get in the car it ain't going to roll i've got one of those cars or the church has got one of those cars that the door don't open you gotta have the key to open the door so the mechanics has to be there it's got to be both mechanics and dynamics so if it doesn't have a battery it's not going to go if it doesn't have this if it doesn't have that all of it's got to be there but he says we put too much emphasis on the mechanics we buff the hubs we give it a sam simon eyes job everything is about our doctrines right our our uh our teachings are right we have to that we have the true revelation of the teachings of god's word but that has to be right you can't you'll never have the dynamics with the trinity mind so both parts of it has to be there all the doctrines got to be right that's part of the mechanics you've got to have the uh so the the dynamics is a something that falls upon the mechanics so you've got to have the word you've got the word you know what the truth is if you've been a believer for a year that you've filled your tank with the tapes we've listened to do you filled your taint with the quotes and the fellowship and the scripture that that's all the mechanics filled with the word and we have that sitting there right in place we've got believers the sisters are wearing skirts they're not putting on high heels if you know if it starts pushing your body forward you know it's too too high it's it's not right i don't have a measuring tape you know what i mean of what a high heel is i think the leslie and you can look at some of the elder sisters in there and look at what kind of shoes they wear you know there's no one walking around in stilettos or or i don't i was going to say pumps but i don't really know what a pump is so uh but you know you don't see these high heels and if you're wearing them this morning we don't have we love you you know we just presume that you're doing what you know is best but that's what the word of god is you know it's the filter so that only pure gas gets in your tank pure word fills up your tank so you we've got the mechanics he said but we put too much emphasis on getting everybody's hair right everybody's dressed right church order right getting everybody to believe the right doctrine over and over again teach the right doctrine teach the right doctrine you've got to believe right you've got to have that right but dynamics is strong meat okay it takes your revelation and makes it manifest in the flesh or in other words it brings it into existence you say it's not what do you mean by bringing into existence in other words it brings it into a living reality now you're living the mechanics the mechanics has got to move it's got to do the works that he did now if you listen to this slow and if we went through it line by line but it is actually what your you finally work on the car you work on the church you work on yourselves you get yourself under the token you fill yourself with the word of god now that you're there something okay apart from the mechanics has got to come and ignite you to move into the predestinated work because you are foreordained unto good works that you should walk in now that you now perform the works that you were predestinated to perform that the works that i do shall you do also is that males over 30. is that old senile pastors or is it every man woman boy and girl whose name is written on the lamb's book of life there's got to be something outside of mechanics so the trap was is we put so much emphasis on the doctrine on malachi 4 5 this is god's prophet this is god's prophet how many know this is god prophet how many know it by divine revelation you don't need me to explain to you one more time that he's a prophet how is this church going to prove that they have christ in them how is it going to prove that they have word in them that they're full of gasoline that is not the mechanics only because it's got to be both you understand it's got to be both it's got to be the revealed the true revealed word of god what the bible really teaches right and that was what the teaching reign was and that could only come by a prophet it could only come by the opening of the seven seals there was no gasoline or no word in the church until the seals were opened and the word of god was now poured in to the tank of your heart now you've got the word you've got the church buffed up i think our deacons are the best mechanical polishers there are they keep all the hubcaps on they keep the wheels from falling off they keep it clean the mechanics is there there she sits a beautiful machine all in order all the bride marching in step to the word filled with the word of god and we need something amen we need to come to the time where we look back at her and says it doesn't do us one more bit of good to simonize it again to wax it again it's time we take this church on a trip that she comes out of the garage and starts finding and doing the works that she's predestinated to do so he's got to have the mechanics the mechanics is the true word the mechanics is the doctrines the teachings it it's it it's that part of you that oh you you know what i'm saying that it's it lives right right but see the dynamics makes you act different it makes you live different not in a mechanical way in other words it doesn't make you live right that's still mechanics believe right that's still mechanics have the right nature that still mechanics and that's what we put all the emphasis on let's be honest we preach about living right believing right believing malachi 4 believing the seals are open believing this the mysteries believing this believing that believing that and to have the right nature oh i'd rather have the right nature than the wrong doctrine that's what we put emphasis on and he's saying what we failed to put emphasis on is the dynamics is the power that's in the gasoline when it's ignited by the resurrection spirit and that isn't running around the church shouting and dancing and and everything because he just he just told us that i don't care how much you run around do you shout and and you dance he said if you don't have that life you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do any good you're just cranking around the pistons the spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire it by you got to have both all right we put the emphasis on the mechanics we'll admit that she's buffed the hubcaps are polished it's been simonized over and over and over again so we understand so that that's the mechanics living right believing right dressing right having the right attitude i've got all that part of it now we need the dynamic power that's to put into actions the promises of god hebrews i mean ii peter 1 4. let me just find it real quick just to read it to you because it's it's so beautiful whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises here we are we've got a bible full of promises we believe it right those promises are in us we confess them we've got the gas you see what i'm saying we've got the gas by these exceedingly great and precious promises by these ye might be partakers of divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so now we've got these great and exceeding precious promises we've got everything the prophet of god said that we would be said that we could do but we substitute it with emotion we think when we shout and we dance and we run and we repent and we come to the altar a hundred times that is not the dynamics that's being talked about the dynamics is the the power that takes those promises that you have in your life it's an external spark it's something that doesn't come from within you it comes from without you it's a quickening power in other words that promise that you hold in your mechanics is brought to life then it takes the automobile that you are all buffed and polished right full of the word it sparks it and now it moves that automobile that believer into the fulfillment of that promise and bringing that promise into a fleshly existence it's out of the garage it's actually bringing now the very word of god to pass it causes her to step out and speak something that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh that's the dynamic it proves its word how does it prove its word because it brings the word of god to pass now we just heard that and we'll try to listen to it again the prophet of god said it takes the believer and turns him into the lion of the tribe of judah that power that quickening that makes you alive brings you into resurrection turns you into the bride of christ back together with him in an invisible union that the same works that i do you shall do also so now the church is beginning to turn a corner the car's polished it's full of gas it's now time for the church to take a trip not only up and out of here but it's time for her to start fulfilling the works that's been prophesied of her the dynamics is the power to bring the word to pass now we've got to understand that that power men call it the holy spirit but that falls on the just and unjust this spark this dynamic only falls on the elected bride lady because she's the one that now represents both mechanics and dynamics she is not a clunker driving down the road sputtering putting out all kinds of smoke she's a beautiful lady full of virtue full of the word of god imperfect union with her husband got all the mechanics in order now she's moving into a new part of her life the dynamic part of life we would spend forever trying to get every believer part of every individual's life into my perfect mechanical order there comes a time you got to start polishing your own car yeah amen you got to start buffing your own hubs you got to simonize it you got to vacuum it you've got to keep it clean and you've got to keep it full of gas and now we can sit there in this vehicle and lift our hands up and say lord quicken me what would you have me to do where would you have me to go what am i living for i want to drive for the rapture i want to pick up anybody along the way that i can and take them with me i want to show this world that you're the same yesterday today and forever that you still heal the sick that you still raise the dead you still cast out demons you still do all these works lord my car's ready i'm full of the word i've got the mechanics now lord i want you to spark me that the evidence of what the true church is is made flesh in me i drive by a house down the street and he's got a i think he's got a 56 a 57 55 56 and 57 chevy oh they're beautiful i'd like to go drive them i'd like to take it for a spin don't you want to take your mechanics don't you want to bring it into existence don't you want to take it out of the ground young ladies don't you want to at school take somebody that you know might listen and sit down and open your bible to them and explain what it means to be a real lady not to give away your virtue to wait for your husband how how how how that god could really some of you men at work guys at school you might as well let them know you're going to find out you're a believer here it's better they find out you're a believer here then wait till there and they find out you aren't i don't want to be ashamed of this gospel i don't want to be ashamed of the car i drive i don't want to be ashamed of the gasoline i have in my tank oh god quicken it the quickening power bring this bride to life hallelujah that's what we need to put the emphasis on the spirit that's going to bring us to life that the works that he does we do also amen she's finally back in the beautiful form of life god bless you this morning we're just starting down this beautiful road of the quickening power of the sheaf offering what was waved over it why it was waved over it how this bride will be revealed in the last day by the spark hitting the word that the prophet put in your tank and bringing you to life god bless you this morning let's stand how are we going to get into that spark i know let's say it this way i want that spark to get into me amen everything that i know everything i've been taught all the ways i've tried to apply the token lord now may it produce fruit that's what our hearts desire is brother jackson you're gonna help me baptize zoey i presume somebody will come back and help i guess sister laura you'll help her get ready and then you're welcome to come here take pictures from there and if you guys will all go get ready now and then those of you that have to go i understand some of you will have to go and and that's perfectly fine we'd love you to stay but if you have to go we'll just sing a song while we're standing and then you can make your way out but let's just bow our heads and i just wanted to ask you something in your heart this morning do you in your life [Music] feel that you can do more for the kingdom of god than you're doing do you in your heart [Music] realize that you're not testifying and sharing the lord jesus like you should you this morning in your heart feel that the word of god doesn't have full preeminence in your life may i ask it this way this morning to you this morning look at yourself and say you know what i i'm not really looking for the coming of the lord i'm not really living for the rapture it's just kind of a side thought [Music] don't feel bad that you feel that way this morning because there's more of us in here that are in that condition than we'll admit and we tried to speak this morning about a spark about a power [Music] that can come into your life and bring those desires to live right and do right put all that in order and then cause you to labor for the kingdom of god to go into all the world to share the gospel to lay your hands on the sick to cast out devils the works that i do shall you do also because i go unto my father i will not leave you comfortless but i will come again and spark you and set that word that's in your heart on fire that you bring those promises into existence in your life and you'd just like to lift your hands to him this morning and say lord spark me quicken me [Music] bring all that i believe in all that i am into life turn me into a little messiah this morning turn me into you [Music] you became me that i might become you that you'll be living through me i wanna i want your my life to change this morning [Music] i'm asking for that power that will resurrect me from a believer from mechanics to dynamics from mechanics into the proof that the word of god is alive in me because it's doing what the word said it would do that's what i desired this morning that's what my hands up for lord i want to be free from the bondage of the world i want to be free from just putting all the emphasis on on the carnal side of the thing lord i want you to live in me and do your part i ask it this morning lord i'm turning my life to you say lord i've been involved way too busy in the things of the world turn me around lord let me come back to you let me be back in love with you let me read my bible before i step out of my car for school let me bow my head at the wheel before i get out for work lord let me be a lighthouse light my candle father give me that spark i can't produce that spark it's got to come from you and i'm lifting my hand this morning saying smart me lord jesus set me on fire we asked it this morning in jesus precious name amen [Music] oh who is like you lord [Music] god bless you [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Applause] of my future days [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh oh and the moment that i see you face to face [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] welcome holy spirit oh when we are in your presence [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] oh oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] satan's battle before you oh my accusing me of sin is [Music] in mind to guide me [Music] oh [Music] i'm [Music] if that's what it takes [Music] i [Music] amen you know we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity and come into the world speaking lies then the word of god comes our way and it quickens to life something in us and on the day of pentecost peter and them coming out of the upper room filled with the spirit of god and the people they they knew that they were from nazareth and and that their galileans in that their nature gave them away but they knew that they were with jesus and then the word of god began to be preached what jesus died for and that he said men and brethren this is what was promised in the bible that he'd pour his spirit out upon men and women and they would speak with other tongues they would prophesy they'd be fulfilled with the same power that he was filled with and with this stirring spirit in them their hearts were pricked and they said what must we do to receive this same spirit and peter said repent every one of you and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit here's where we pick up that story in acts uh the the second chapter and the 36th verse therefore let all the house of israel know it surely that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call so the spirit of the lord moved upon zoe's heart to be baptized and now this promise awaits her too that her life might be quickened at her young age to manifest the word of god in her life so we're going to baptize her now it's nice to have her father here with us to help baptize her zoey upon your confession that the spirit of god moved upon you to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus that you receive the promise of his holy spirit that you receive the same spirit that he had in him in you that you life will also be quickened into the resurrection of the dead into the rapture of the living saints to be with ever with the lord we have to do this according to the promise to go into all the world baptizing them in the name of father the son and the holy spirit and by divine revelation and by the teaching of the messenger of this age we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] let's all stand and sing a dismissal song amen oh i'm feeling so much better talking about this [Music] [Music] oh [Music] go [Music] is [Music] let's go [Music] you
