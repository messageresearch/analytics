Description:
Sunday Evening Service
Br. Matthew McGeary
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 18th, 2026
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Oh, left behind [singing] heaven stone [music] to build it here inside. [singing] Oh, and there [music] at your cross. You paid the day I [music] You broke my chain, free my soul.

Thank you [music] Jesus for the blood [singing] of thank you Jesus [music] [singing] me. Thank [music] you Jesus [singing] in my life [music and singing] from the darkness to glorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray. Lord, we so thankful for your your call upon our life. Lord, we see the the darkness and the the strain on the people of this age and how they are looking for financial freedom and position and to store up treasures in this earth that we know is all going to burn and pass away. Lord, to think that you called us to be a part of another kingdom, &gt;&gt; Lord, where we don't have to put our joy and our satisfaction in our job or in our car or in our house or our ability to manufacture something. Lord, you called us to believe your word. And you've given us a promise, Lord, that everything is already taken care of and that we have an inheritance. And all we have to do is simply believe what you've said and receive it. And we know that we can walk into all the promises that you've given unto us, Lord. And we just thank you for Calvary. We thank you for the sacrifice, Lord, of [snorts] that would wash us white as snow that we could stand before you, not having to worry about [music] our past and not having to wonder if it was dealt with, Lord, but to know it's finished because you said it was finished. Therefore, Lord, we can we can enjoy uh the beneficiaries of your resurrection. And we just thank you for this opportunity to stand once again, Lord, before your purchased possession. We never take it for granted. We never take it lightly, Lord. And we just look to you, the author and finisher of our faith, that you would just come and have your perfect will in the service. We ask it in your name, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Just want to say what a tremendous blessing it is to have uh Brother Cosman and Sister Holly and their family with us. how much uh they mean to us and we're uh looking forward to eternity. You know, uh God brings certain ones into our life and into the assembly and they mean so much to us. Yet, you know, we're we're prisoners of Jesus Christ and we're here to serve and one of these days, you know, we'll we'll have a million plus years to talk it all over. So, while we're on this side, we just want to be faithful to the calling. So, we're thankful that uh brother Cosman was obedient uh to the leadership of the Lord and doing a work there in southern Romania. Uh wonderful people there, but there is a great need. So, just remember him in prayer as uh uh him and his family continue to serve the bride of Jesus Christ in that region. I just want to maybe pick up where he left off. We'll just read in Ephesians chapter 1. Just see how the Lord would lead in this service tonight. Um, you know, I won't say much other than it it somehow fell my lot. And sometimes, uh, [snorts] you know, I was talking to brother Billy. I was like, well, you know, if if, uh, if if if we preached when we wanted to, none of us would ever preach. You know, it's it's I don't think out of the brothers here, none of us are going to be like, "Yeah, I'm that guy." But, uh, we just want to be faithful when when when asked. And so, uh, we're just, uh, I just remember one time, uh, you know, it it always strikes me, but my brother Aaron asked me to preach one time on a Wednesday night and and I and I just I wasn't I just didn't feel ready. I didn't I didn't feel prepared and and I I tried to find the mind of the Lord and not to get into what his perfect will was for that night or not. But I just remember in that turmoil, I finally just said, "I can't do it." And it wasn't but 20 minutes till service. I told my brother Aaron, I was like, you know, I I I just can't do it. And but it it smoked my heart because I thought, you know, here here my brother, he he he travels around the world and preaches the gospel and and labors for the kingdom of God and and maybe maybe I had an opportunity to carry the load a little bit and I wasn't able to do it. And from [laughter] that moment, I just said, "Lord, I always want to be willing. I might not be ready. I might not be able, Lord, but I just want to have a willing heart. And and so that's that's been my my [laughter] burden is to just be willing. And uh sometimes you might not feel like you do much, but one thing you want to know is Lord, I did it for you. I just try to do my part. And so we just trust the Lord will come and have his way. Ephesians 1 and verse 5-14. Amen. I enjoyed the word this morning. Did you all enjoy that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so thankful for the reading of the will. [snorts] And uh brother Cosman just ended right here. So we're just picking up Ephesians 1 and verse 5 uh through uh verse 14. It says, "Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children uh by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved, and whom we have redemption through his blood, and the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, that he might gather together one and all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are in earth, even in him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. Aren't you thankful for that? That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ, in whom ye also trusted after that ye have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory. Amen. You may be seated. As we we just heard uh this morning, we could even turn over into Isaiah 60 and read how uh there is gross darkness upon the people and gross darkness upon the land, but arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. And we certainly can look out and we can see that, you know, the world is in such a chaotic time. And and the prophet would even preach shalom and start to show how, you know, the world is right back in that condition again to where there's gross darkness upon the people and it's in a chaotic condition. And and certainly we can see that if you just look out into the news or look out into the politics or or or just go down to your local supermarket and you'll certainly see the chaos, the confusion, the insanity just running rampant everywhere. But it's amazing that right in what would be called the darkest hour and the darkest age and the darkest time that the world has ever seen. It is also the time of the greatest light. Now, now to think it is a paradox to think in the hour that that it is the most gross darkness that the world has ever seen. Right in the midst of Lady Oia and the and the grossest darkness that's ever been upon of the world, there is a people that has been called that has actually come under the greatest light that the world has ever known. And you know what? What an opportunity that we have to think that there is a people that we have received the greatest light that that has ever shown. And and and we know that that light is Jesus Christ. And to reject him is to reject the light. It's to reject his word. And and you know, if you reject him, it's it's to re to receive him is life. And to reject him is it it it's death. And you know, we know that that this message, he is the word. And and his word is a seed. And the life is in the seed. And and and what we are finding out more and more is that very word is a seed and it's inside each one of us each inside of each one of his believing children. And brother Brandon would say it this way in the great warrior David. He said because the life is in the seed and God's word is a seed and it's alive. If you can just simply receive it take it out of the Bible and said it means me. Amen. Then you got something. That's right. All the demons couldn't stop you from it. No matter what anybody else would say, you wouldn't believe it because you know where you are standing. Oh, I want to be a people that I I want to know exactly where I am standing. I want to be sure of who I am in the hour that I am standing in. And and and you know, really that's the tactic of the devil. HE WANTS TO TRY TO GET YOU DISCOURAGED and he wants you to TRY TO DOUBT AND HE HE WANTS TO GET YOU TO WORRY and and he wants to move you off THE PROMISES OF GOD TO TO REALLY GET YOU TO A PLACE WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE STANDING. He he he wants to get you to a place WHERE YOU START TO QUESTION WHO YOU ARE and and maybe the hour that we're now living in and make you think that maybe we got more time AND AND KNOW IT JUST STRIKES ME HERE RECENTLY I I was uh uh fellowshipping with a with a friend of mine who who's just receiving the word and God's doing a supernatural work in his life and I'm so thankful for that. and and he he's coming in contact with people, you know, that have have claimed to be Christians all of their lives and a and you know, and he's like, "Oh, you know, you the reason you're, you know, you're doing good is cuz we've prayed for you and WE PRAYED FOR UH this in YOUR LIFE." BUT HE'S HE'S sitting there looking at them and he said, "Yeah, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE THE FRUITS of the word in your life." And so he starts TO ASK THEM AND QUESTION THEM AND THEY TELL THEM, "WELL, YOU KNOW, you know, you know, Kyle, you it doesn't matter. You know, just just just look look into the Bible at the thief on the cross. YOU KNOW, ALLS HE HAD TO SAY WAS REMEMBER ME. And what he was doing, he was making his own religion that I can live any way that I want to live. And and you know, I I can go to church on Sunday and I can GO TO CHURCH ON ON Wednesday or man, they don't even do that once a year. Go on Easter. It doesn't matter. Just as long as somewhere down the line, I say, "Remember me, Lord." And it's a shame that people will get to a place to where, you know, they they they they think they know where they're standing, but they're totally blind. And just as the condition of the age, they're they're wretched, miserable, and blind. And what they don't even know it. They think they have need of nothing. They think that just SAYING THEY GO TO CHURCH ONCE A week is just enough. AND I TELL YOU, WE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T FALL INTO THE SAME CATEGORY OF THAT STRAIN on the age where we think that we're we're pretty rich and increased with knowledge AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. And you know, I really don't got need of nothing. I have everything I HAVE NEED OF. I I I HAVE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. WELL, there's a lot of truth to that. But what you WANT TO DO IS EXAMINE your life and see if the message of the hour is living out through you if you're bearing the fruits of the word. And hey, I I say it's ALWAYS GOOD TO CHECK UP AND LOOK INTO THE WORD BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM EVEN TOLD US AND TAUGHT US. HE GOES, "WELL, you want to see look at what he did and look at what you're doing and SEE WHAT YOU GOT." WELL, I TELL YOU, THERE OUGHT TO BE ALWAYS A SOBRIETY AND A SINCERITY in the heart of the BELIEVING CHILDREN OF GOD TO BE FEEDING on the word of God AND LOOKING AT THE LIFE. I SAY I PRAISE GOD FOR A LIFE THAT WAS poured out for us uh uh uh uh through MALACHI 4:5 THAT WAS WAS AN OPEN BOOK uh uh a a and and and shared all the life experiences and and I tell you we needed that because what WAS IT DOING? IT WAS SHOWING US THE EFFECT OF THE WORD in a believer's life in the day and the hour that we're now living IN AND HOW IT FINE-TUNES ON DOWN TO WHERE YOU KNOW YOU COULD JUST ANSWER A PHONE AND SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST GOING TO STEP OUT a little bit." BUT THE BUT THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS THERE TO TO SHOW HIM, LOOK, you can't continue that way. I can't continue working through you and BEARING THE FRUITS OF MY WORD IN YOUR LIFE. YOU GOT TO GO MAKE THAT RIGHT. And to think if if IT WAS THAT FINE-TUNED DOWN TO WHERE JUST A LITTLE MISREP misrepresentation where, you know, YOU COULD JUSTIFY it all you want. You could say, WELL, YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WASN'T. HE HE DID SAY, "WELL, TELL HIM I'M not here." And go out and what? He wasn't there. And I wonder how MANY THINGS ARE WE DOING and thinking that we're getting by with &gt;&gt; and and yet we want to say, "WELL, YEAH, WE ARE THE ONES. We're going to do the great." Well, yes, we believe all those things, but something THAT'S BEEN ON MY HEART THAT I WAS FEEDING ON AND BEEN LISTENING to to LATELY IS BROTHER BRANDON PREACHES A MESSAGE CALLED SPIRITUAL AMNESIA. And if it if we're not careful, WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE FORGET WHO WE ARE. AND FOR WE FORGET what the message OF THE HOUR WAS SUPPOSED to produce in a believer. &gt;&gt; You know, it it's it's exactly what we heard this morning and and WHAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR SAID AND WHAT PAUL TAUGHT. YOU KNOW, WE CAN UNDERSTAND ALL THE MYSTERIES. WE CAN UNDERSTAND ALL THESE THINGS, BUT WHAT PROFITED US IF WE DON'T HAVE LOVE? IF WE DON'T HAVE charity &gt;&gt; and if we if we're not careful, we start to lean towards towards understanding and and and a and and maybe our routine of of coming to church and and if we're not careful, we start to see that the word is not having an effect in our life like it should. And here in our text in Ephesians 1:5, it says, "HAVING PREDESTINATED US unto the adoption of children BY JESUS CHRIST to himself according to the good pleasure of whose will?" &gt;&gt; His will. SO WHAT ARE WE PREDESTINATED UNTO? &gt;&gt; ADOPTION. I'm not looking for adoption to come down the road. I believe right now I am living in adoption. you know, AND I COULD TESTIFY ON THAT A WHILE HERE A WHILE BACK. I WAS READING out of Galatians where, you know, we've received the spirit of adoption, and I just spoke out of my mouth. I said, "I AM AN ADOPTED SON OF GOD." WELL, you know, I SPOKE THAT WORD OUT AND LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT I WAS ABOUT TO WALK INTO THE GREATEST TRIAL THAT I'd ever walked into my life. BUT, YOU KNOW, UH, ANY REVELATION THAT YOU RECEIVE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE TESTED ON THAT REVELATION. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU BETTER KNOW WHERE YOU ARE STANDING BECAUSE YOUR MIND CAN SEEM to lose you and EVERYTHING CAN CAN SEEM LIKE IT'S NOT RIGHT AND AND THIS MIGHT NOT LOOK right and that might look right. But oh, praise the Lord. IF THERE'S A REVELATION, IF THERE'S AN ANCHOR INSIDE OF YOUR HEART AND AN ANCHOR INSIDE OF YOUR SOUL, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COMES. ONE THING YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE HEARD the word OF THE LORD AND IT HAS BEEN QUICKENED IN MY SOUL AND I KNOW WHERE I am standing. And I might not be able to make sense of this AND THAT AND AND THIS HAPPENED AND THAT HAPPENED. But one THING I AM SURE OF, I KNOW WHERE I am standing. &gt;&gt; I say it's really important that we know where we are standing. Isn't that what he said? No matter what anybody would say, you wouldn't believe it because we know where you are standing. So many times people get into a place of spiritual AMNESIA BECAUSE UH SITUATIONS, RIGHT? and and and and maybe uh it COULD BE SOME SOME UH FAMILY TRAUMA OR SOMETHING HAPPENED. YOU COULD GO INTO THAT MESSAGE AND SEE HOW THE SHOCK OF WAR and the shock of sin. What will it do? It'll cause amnesia. AND SOMETIMES WE FORGET who we are. And many times people come for prayer and they need deliverance. And really all they need is they just need to be delivered from their spiritual amnesia. They they they have forgotten who they are. are. And and WHEN YOU START TO FORGET who you are and that YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD AND THAT YOU CAN DO THE GREATER WORKS AND YOU CAN DO ALL THINGS, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU START TO QUESTION YOUR SALVATION, YOU START TO QUESTION THE HOLY GHOST. YOU START TO WONDER, WELL, IF IT it's really me. AND REALLY, WHAT YOU'RE STARTING TO DO IS YOU'RE STARTING TO OPEN UP A door for reasoning to come in and doubt to come in. And then all of a sudden, the worries in THERE, AND YOU'RE CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS, and you're starting TO WONDER, WELL, WHY WHY WHERE'S THE JOY OF MY SALVATION? AND AND WHY AM I DOING THIS? AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE MENTALLY fatigued and and the strain is so much. So you you MIGHT AS WELL JUST WATCH A LITTLE OF THIS AND FEED ON A LITTLE OF THIS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE DAY YOU WONDER, "HOW IN THE WORLD DID I GET TO WHERE I'M AT? I don't even know if I'm a SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD ANYMORE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM." AND MAYBE YOU COME UP FOR PRAYER. AND MANY TIMES WHAT THE WORD the the the word of the Lord is I it's to deliver you FROM THAT SPIRITUAL AMNESIA BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU WHEN did you become A SON OF GOD? WHEN DID YOU BECOME A DAUGHTER OF GOD? &gt;&gt; Oh I love it. WE CAN GO BACK IN EPHESIANS. I JUST LOVE IT HOW IT SAYS IN IN verse four it says according HE AS HE HAS CHOSEN us in him before. &gt;&gt; When did you BECOME A SON? YOU ALWAYS WERE A SON. YOU ALWAYS WERE A DAUGHTER. THEREFORE, BECAUSE YOU ARE A SON AND A DAUGHTER OF GOD, YOU CAN BE REBORN. BECAUSE YOU ARE A SON OR A DAUGHTER OF GOD, THEREFORE, YOU CAN BE QUICKENED. THE QUESTION ISN'T WHETHER YOU'RE A SON OF GOD. THE QUESTION ISN'T WHETHER YOU'RE A DAUGHTER OF GOD. THE QUESTION IS, ARE YOU GOING TO START STANDING UP FOR WHAT YOU really are and say, "I am the BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. I CAN DO THE GREATER WORKS AND I DO KNOW WHERE I'M STANDING, and there ain't no devil. There ain't no demon going to talk me out of my divine inheritance. I have been PREDESTINATED UNTO ADOPTION. ADOPTION IS NOT AN OPTION. &gt;&gt; Adoption is not an option. IT AIN'T AN OPTION TO US BELIEVERS. YOU'RE PREDESTINATED TO AN UH TO ADOPTION if you can. If you can come to church three times a week, if you CAN GET THERE 20 MINUTES EARLY, I I then I will. NO, YOU ARE PRED. WELL, THAT MEANS THERE AIN'T NO DEVIL IN HELL THAT CAN STOP YOU FROM COMING INTO THE FULLNESS OF THE MATURITY OF THE WORD THAT HAS BEEN SPOKEN FOR THE HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. AND I WONDER is there are PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE STANDING THAT THEY CAN TELL THAT OLD DEVIL, THAT OLD DEMON, YOU COME A LITTLE TOO LATE. I'VE DONE HEARD FROM MY THEOPHONY. I KNOW WHO I AM and I know where I AM GOING. I AM THE PREDESTINATED SON OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND I CAN DO THE GREATER WORKS. I'VE BEEN PREDESTINATED UNTO ADOPTION. IT IS NOT JUST AN OPTION. IT IS MY INHERITANCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, shake yourself a little bit tonight. MAYBE WE'VE PUT SOMETHING OFF ON the rainbow in a pot of GOLD SOMEWAY YONDER AND WE'RE WAITING FOR SOME BIG CALAMITY or we're waiting for SOMETHING TO COME OR WE'RE WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO COME IN THE FUTURE. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, MAYBE WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF SPIRITUAL AMNESIA. WE NEED TO WAKE UP AND WE NEED TO SHAKE OURSEL AND UNDERSTAND THE CAPSTONE HAS ALREADY DESCENDED. WE HAVE HEARD THE SHOUT. WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR THEOPHONY. NOW IS THE HOUR of the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it's a promise and I want to say it's a promise of what the seed word will produce in you. and and and there ain't nothing that can keep you from it. What we need to do is receive it &gt;&gt; no matter what anybody else says. &gt;&gt; I know where I'm standing. &gt;&gt; Well, help me help me out a little bit. Does anybody know where you're standing? &gt;&gt; You can say, you know what? I don't listen to worldly music. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't entertain the things of the world. Now, HERE BECOMES A GREAT PARADOX. We'll just hit on this for a little bit maybe uh uh uh you know just to maybe bring it down home to where sometimes we're living you know sometimes we're entertaining things we shouldn't entertain &gt;&gt; now we have to remind ourselves you know what I'm a son and daughter of God I shouldn't be doing that &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; and you know the prophet talks about you he's he's not just going to SHOVE YOU THROUGH A PIPE AND PULL YOU OUT ON THE OTHER END and say, "Well done, my good AND FAITHFUL SERVANT." YEAH, THERE'S A MIGHTY DELIVERANCE and God will deliver you of A LOT OF THINGS, BUT YOU REMEMBER THERE'S A YOU GOT TO KEEP YOURSELF PROTECTED because there's always a punch coming. MAY MAYBE YOUR BATTLE'S LOST. MAYBE YOUR BATTLE'S MUSIC, MAYBE YOUR BATTLE'S A TEMPER, MAYBE YOUR BATTLE'S SOMETHING ELSE. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THERE'S ALWAYS A GIANT that's wandering around in the land. AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP AGAINST THAT THING. And you know what you're going to have to do? you're going to have to be do battle. And that's one thing I love about Da uh David in this IN IN THE BIBLE. HE KNEW WHERE HE was standing when he came face TO FACE WITH GOLIATH. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WONDER, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? AM I CALLED TO FIGHT? AM I SHOULD I GO FIGHT THIS this this THIS GOLIATH? YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. NO, HE HAD ALREADY heard the word of a prophet. A prophet HAD ALREADY COME AND anointed David and said, "David, you are anointed the COMING KING OF ISRAEL." DAVID KNEW WHERE HE WAS STANDING. THUS SAYETH [screaming] THE LORD ACCORDING TO A VINDICATED PROPHET, I AM THE ANOINTED ONE OF GOD, AND I SHALL BE THE KING over Israel. So there ain't no Goliath. &gt;&gt; There was nothing Goliath COULD DO TO STOP DAVID BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY PROPHESIED. HE WAS ALREADY ANOINTED FOR THE JOB. ALL HE WAS DOING IS TAKING DOWN EVERY GIANT AND EVERY DEMON OF DOUBT THAT GOT IN HIS WAY. WHAT ABOUT THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST? IF THERE'S A GOLIATH STANDING IN YOUR WAY, I DON'T CARE IF it's temper, IF IT'S LUST, IF IT'S COUNTRY MUSIC, WHATEVER IT IS, WHEN IT STARTS TO BOAST AND TRY TO TELL YOU, SEE, YOU AIN'T GOT THE VICTORY. YOU AIN'T REALLY GOING TO THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. YOU'LL NEVER GET THE VICTORY OVER THIS. YOU JUST SAY, YOU OLD GOLIATH, YOU'VE BOASTED ABOUT YOUR GODS, BUT I AM OF THE LORD GOD OF THE FAITH OF ISRAEL, AND I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR HEAD OFF. AND I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU GOT TO TAKE THE WORD OF GOD, AND YOU GOT TO HIT THAT DEVIL SQUARE BETWEEN THE EYES. HEY, maybe we're getting down home to where we're living, &gt;&gt; BUT SO MANY TIMES WE GET SPIRITUAL AMNESIA and we start, well, that's just the way it is. No, that that's not the way it is. &gt;&gt; I SAY WE GOT TO BE SURE OF WHERE WE'RE STANDING BECAUSE SATAN'S ALWAYS TRYING TO MOVE YOU OFF THE PROMISES, ALWAYS TRYING TO OFFER AN EXCUSE, ALWAYS TRYING TO OFFER REASONING, ALWAYS TRYING TO EVEN OFFER ACHIEVEMENTS. But my Bible in Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. IT IS A GIFT OF GOD, NOT OF WORKS, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus under good works, WHICH GOD HATH BE OR BEFORE ordained that we should walk in THEM. LOOK, YOU THE VERY FOOTSTEPS OF YOUR life have been ordered of the Lord." &gt;&gt; What were we hearing this morning? It's the reading of the wheel. IT'S TELLING YOU WHAT your will is for your life. WHAT THE INHERITANCE OF YOUR LIFE IS. SO THEN WHAT WE'RE TO do is to look into the message of the hour to hear the message of the hour and to look at our life and to see IS ARE WE MANIFESTING what the reading OF THE WHEEL HAS SPOKEN OUT OVER OUR LIFE. AND IF you see things that aren't part OF YOUR INHERITANCE, I SAY let it go. AND LET'S TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD AND SAY, LORD, it's mine. We know that Christ was the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was fulfilling all that the word had spoke of him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We know that Christ was the word made flesh and he was fulfilling all the word that was spoke of him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So then JUST AS CHRIST WAS THE WORD made flesh and he was fulfilling ALL THE WORDS OF THE PROPHETS, NOW WHAT are we? We are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. And what are we doing? Just as he WAS THE ANOINTED MESSIAH, NOW WE ARE THE anointed word. And what are we doing? WE'RE FULFILLING ALL the word that was spoken of us. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "As the father sent me, so send I you." &gt;&gt; And if he was the anointed word for that day, THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "HIS BRIDE IS THE ANOINTED one for this day." OH, I'M TELLING YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING. We're hearing the reading OF THE WILL OF GOD FOR OUR LIFE. WE ARE NOT SOME WISHYWASHY, SPINELESS, BACKBONELESS BRIDE OF CHRIST WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHERE SHE'S STANDING. AND WE'RE JUST PUSHED THIS WAY AND PUSHED THAT WAY. AND WHEN LUST COMES ALONG, WE JUST GIVE IN IT. WHEN WE hear music, WE JUST THUMP OUR FEET TO IT. And and and WHEN THE DEVIL STARTS TO RISE UP IN OUR FAMILY'S LIFE, WE JUST SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW, LET ME CALL THE DOCTOR. LET ME CALL THE PASTOR." NO, I WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE OUGHT TO BE A PEOPLE HERE. WE know exactly WHERE WE ARE STANDING. WHEN THAT DEVIL STARTS TO SHOW HIS FACE INTO OUR LIFE AND INTO WHERE WE'RE LIVING, THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING HE SAYS, "DEVIL, YOU BACK UP IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I AM A SON OF GOD. I HAVE FULL AUTHORITY AND FULL POWER AND DOMINION OVER YOU. GET OUT OF MY WAY." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We could go in the church AGE BOOK WHERE THE PROPHET OF GOD STARTS TALKING ABOUT HOW HE DIDN'T COMPLETE ALL OF HIS WORK WHILE HE WAS IN HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY. So now he's working in and through the bride. And she knows this. For it was not yet time FOR HIM TO DO CERTAIN THINGS THAT HE MUST DO NOW. But he will now fulfill THROUGH THE BRIDE THAT WORK which he left for this SPECIFIC TIME. DID YOU KNOW YOU GOT A JOB TO DO? SOME OF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB AND YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN GIVEN a spiritual job. &gt;&gt; I wonder if you would start giving more diligence to your spiritual job, you might end up with a natural job. SOMETIMES WE GIVE SO MUCH TIME AND WE GIVE SO MUCH ATTENTION AND WE GIVE SO MUCH OF our efforts to the things of the world that the very thing that you're called to to to to live out you you DON'T GIVE ANY TIME AND ATTENTION TO IT. I I wonder if the amount of time you YOU YOU SPEND STUDYING for for for for you you KNOW TO PASS YOUR TEST or or if you spend to do this or that OR ALL THE TIME you you you spend on LinkedIn and all this. My goodness, if you just spend it in the word of God, it might produce A SUCH A FAITH IN YOU, YOU'LL JUST SPEAK A JOB RIGHT INTO EXISTENCE. WELL, LORD, I NEED A JOB THAT'LL LET ME GO TO TO church on Wednesday. I NEED A JOB THAT'LL LET ME GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S THE CHILDREN'S BREAD. IT'S MY INHERITANCE. I AIN'T GOT TO WORK ON WEDNESDAY, AND I AIN'T GOT TO WORK ON SUNDAY. I AM OF THE FAITH SEED OF ABRAHAM. AND I CAN LOOK RIGHT IN MY BIBLE. OH MY MY GOODNESS. AND WE are living IN THE HOUR OF THE ADOPTION OF CHILDREN WHERE I CAN SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN. MOUNTAIN, GET OUT OF MY WAY. I MIGHT GOT BILLS AND I MIGHT HAVE THINGS TO PAY, BUT ONE THING I KNOW MY BIBLE SAID, HE WILL NEVER SEE THE RIGHTEOUS FORSAKEN AND BEGGING FOR BREAD. GO AHEAD AND TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD. YOU CAN SPEAK A JOB RIGHT INTO EXISTENCE. SAY, LORD GOD, I'M SPEAKING MY JOB INTO EXISTENCE. I AIN'T GOING TO WORK ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND I AIN'T GOING TO WORK ON SUNDAY. WHY? BECAUSE I AM THE FAITH SEED OF ABRAHAM. I HAVE AN INHERITANCE. I'VE HEARD THE READING OF MY WILL. I ABOVE all want you to prosper &gt;&gt; and be in good health. &gt;&gt; Well, WHEN THAT OLD GOLIATH STANDS IN YOUR WAY AND SAYS, "NOPE, YOU CAN'T PROSPER. YOU CAN'T BE IN GOOD HEALTH." I SAY, "OH, DEVIL, [screaming] I KNOW WHERE I AM STANDING. I HAVE HEARD THE READING OF MY WILL, AND IT IS HIS WILL THAT I SHALL PROSPER AND BE IN GOOD HEALTH." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. John 1:12 says, "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God." &gt;&gt; Even to them that believe on his name, power to become. How? How am I I can't be brother Brandon. WELL, PRAISE GOD. WE'RE NOT CALLED TO BE BROTHER BRANDHAM. &gt;&gt; But I tell you ONE THING YOU ARE CALLED to be is what the sheath wave was. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And that was A MANIFESTED SON OF God &gt;&gt; with full power and dominion and full authority who could speak to a storm. &gt;&gt; Think about what happened too when he went up. What was he obedient to? He was obedient to death. YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHEN BROTHER BRANDON WAS WALKING UP THAT MOUNTAIN, he was being obedient to die? &gt;&gt; Just like you, WE KNOW THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS THE original for a sheath wave, right? And what was he obedient to? He was obedient to walk UP OR UP THAT HILL UP THAT MOUNTAIN CALLED GALATHA. WHAT? AND TO die for the sins our for our sins that that SAME LIFE THAT WAS IN Christ could be in us. And what was it? Jesus Christ, the sheath wave, was lifted up on Calvary. HE WAS WAVED BEFORE the people. If I be lifted up, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO THEE. AND THE ORIGINAL SHEATH WAVE, THE WORD that was made flesh, WAS WAVED BACK TO HIS BELIEVING CHILDREN ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. OH, we now I just want to preach the RISING OF THE SUN. WHAT a resurrection that was. And what a resurrection this is. What would the same life that WAS IN CHRIST JESUS NOW IN THE EVENING TIME ARISE AND SHINE GROSS DARKNESS UPON THE PEOPLE? BUT THE GLORY OF THE LORD HAS RISEN UPON YOU. NOT NOT JUST TO NOT JUST TO WARM YOUR SKIN AND TO SAY, "OH, THE SUN IS SHINING ON YOU." NO, BUT WHAT IS IT? IT'S THAT LIGHT NOW IN YOU. THE SAME RESURRECTION life in you. AND WE SAW ONE IN OUR DAY OBEDIENT unto death. And it was in that obedience THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN HE WALKED UP THERE IN OBEDIENCE, HE, you know, I, it's been a minute. I'll go revisit it. But he goes, "Would you walk with me?" &gt;&gt; Oh, it would be the greatest privilege. &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help us to get a revelation of WHAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's an invitation. &gt;&gt; OH FOOLS AND SLOW OF heart &gt;&gt; to know all that the prophets have spoken. &gt;&gt; They were walking with Jehovah AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS HIM. Oh my. MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN WALKING WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR SO MANY YEARS. BUT I PRAY, OH GOD, GIVE US A REVELATION TO SEE THAT YOU ARE STANDING AMONGST US ONCE AGAIN. YOU ARE WALKING WITH US AGAIN. &gt;&gt; And it's the greatest privilege &gt;&gt; I have ever known is to have a revelation of Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30. &gt;&gt; And it was in that moment of walking with him, [snorts] all of a sudden, what did he do? I don't know what step it was, but all of a sudden, he stepped right into an Eden condition. He was young again. &gt;&gt; And even the deer started to come up. Adam, is that you? &gt;&gt; Why? Because here WAS AN ADOPTED SON WITH THE SAME POWER AND AUTHORITY THAT ADAM HAD WHEN HE STOOD ON THE EARTH. HE COULD SPEAK TO THAT MOUNTAIN. He could speak to this cloud. HE COULD SPEAK TO THAT. AND THERE stood an adopted SON OF GOD STANDING THERE. AND HE SPOKE TO THE STORM AND SAID, "CLOUDS AND YOU YOU GO THIS WAY AND LET THE SUN SHINE FOR FOUR DAY." ALL OF NATURE HAD TO OBEY THAT VOICE. I WONDER IF SOMETHING INSIDE OF MOTHER NATURE WAS SAYING, "I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE." &gt;&gt; WHAT is all OF NATURE'S GROANING FOR THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD? AND ACCORDING TO DIVINE PROMISE, HERE STOOD ONE ON THE EARTH AGAIN. AND when I SEE THAT, I KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN PROPHESIED for my life. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you that devil can try to SAY IT ANY KIND OF WAY HE WANT. BUT THAT'S NOT AN OPTION. It's a promise. &gt;&gt; I SHALL MANIFEST EVERY SINGLE WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN OVER THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. WHY? BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THE READING OF MY WILL. AND GOD DOESN'T give something to TAKE IT BACK. WHEN GOD GIVES YOU SOMETHING, HE MAKES A WAY FOR YOU TO RECEIVE IT. MAYBE YOU AIN'T GOT ARMS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD IT. MAYBE YOU FEEL LIKE, "HERE, I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING. I CAN'T HOLD IT. MY ARMS AREN'T BIG ENOUGH." WELL, HE'LL MAKE A WAY. HE'LL MAKE YOUR ARMS BIG ENOUGH. HE'LL MAKE YOUR HEART BIG ENOUGH. MATTER OF FACT, HE'LL PREDESTINATE A SEED OF GOD WITH ALL THE POWER to become. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD HAS PLACED A SEED INSIDE YOU WITH THE POWER TO BECOME EVERYTHING THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR HAS SPOKEN OVER YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; All the potential is already there. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said God put the seed in there with the potentials that it would be what he said it would be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I was just THINKING ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT AND I GOT TO THINKING ABOUT that eagle in the chicken yard. &gt;&gt; You know, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT EAGLE. JUST JUST THINK OF HOW WHAT AN ODD PECULIAR SIGHT THAT WOULD BE. Here's this eagle plucking around with chickens. You you would IMAGINE WALKING UP AND SEE, MAN, THAT'S THE ODDEST SIGHT THAT I'VE ever seen. Why is that eagle walking around AND SCRATCHING AT THE GROUND AND TRYING to eat the same thing that these chickens are eating? &gt;&gt; The bigger question would be why is that eagle tolerating that? Like, hey, [screaming] you're an eagle. &gt;&gt; But you know that eagle WASN'T TRAINED TO HEAR MY VOICE. And the problem WAS IS THAT EAGLE WAS FEEDING on chicken food and he was hearing chickens talk. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You know, and if you're listening to the things of the world, if you're listening to chickens, YOU MIGHT SOUND LIKE A CHICKEN. [snorts] &gt;&gt; If you eat chicken food, &gt;&gt; you are what you eat. &gt;&gt; AND AS LONG AS THAT, but here's what I love to look at THIS STORY. IT WAS ALWAYS AN EAGLE. &gt;&gt; It just didn't know &gt;&gt; it was an eagle. &gt;&gt; So here this chicken is I IT'S IT'S SCRATCHING AROUND IN THE BARNYARD. It's hearing chicken talk. It's eating chicken food. That's all it ever known. But what happened? All of a sudden, it started to hear something. And I got TO THINKING ABOUT THAT. WHAT ABOUT US? I wonder if maybe WE'VE GOT A LITTLE SPIRITUAL AMNESIA BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE REASON WE ACT LIKE the world and we sound LIKE THE WORLD AND IS IT IS IT BECAUSE of things that we're listening to? [snorts] You know, I wonder if we GOT A TASTE FOR THOSE THINGS. IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? WE JUST WE JUST THOUGHT WE'D stick around in the barnyard a little bit. &gt;&gt; WE THOUGHT WE WOULD SCRATCH AROUND THERE A LITTLE BIT LONGER. And you know what'll happen? The longer you stay, the more accustomed you'll get. &gt;&gt; But you see, if you're feeding on the things of the world, if you're eating the things of the world, then those are going to be the things you start to identify with and the start THINGS YOU START TO ENTERTAIN. BUT OH, THANK GOD. THE SCRIPTURE SAID, "BEHOLD, I SEND YOU ELIJAH." WHAT WAS IT? THAT eagle was always AN EAGLE. BUT WHAT WAS IT LACKING? IT WAS LACKING to hear from SOMETHING THAT WOULD IDENTIFY WHAT IT REALLY WAS. &gt;&gt; And what was it? IT WAS THAT VOICE THAT WOULD CALL TO THAT eagle &gt;&gt; and say, "LOOK, YOU DON'T BELONG down there. &gt;&gt; You don't you don't need to live like that. YOU DON'T NEED TO ACT LIKE THAT." AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING IN THAT EAGLE, IT SAW SOMETHING THAT IT IDENTIFIED WITH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE HEARING THIS MORNING. IT'S THE READING OF THE WHEEL. WE ACTUALLY SAW THE THE WORD TAKE ON FLESH in our day &gt;&gt; in a vindicated word through a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; And what was it? It was that eagle's life screaming out, testifying, &gt;&gt; calling your name. What What did you hear? WE HEAR BROTHER COSMAN SAYING, "WHAT WAS THE OPENING OF THE WORD?" IT WAS THE REVEALING and the calling OF YOUR NAMES. HEY, HEY, YOU DON'T BELONG down a lady. You You aren't a chicken. YOU DON'T BELONG IN DENOMINATIONS. YOU ARE AN EAGLE. &gt;&gt; And what is it? IT'S THAT WORD THAT STARTS TO TURN THE HEART. &gt;&gt; Back to the original faith. &gt;&gt; We'll try not to be much longer, but it would turn you back back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers. And then when we receive that original faith, then we can go all the way back. Now listen to this. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS THIS. He says, "WHEN MEN SINNED, HE CROSSED a great chasm between he and God and and left. THERE'S NO WAY BACK. BUT GOD WAS FULL of mercy. He took a substitute and a lamb that was a substitute until the fullness of the time come when he God made flesh to take away sin. And now there's not even a chasm there. Hallelujah. That's how powerful the blood of Jesus Christ is. &gt;&gt; You realize that THERE WAS A GAP. THERE WAS A CHASM THAT YOU COULD NOT CROSS. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO WAY for you to get from here and get to God. AND YOU KNOW WHAT GOD DID? HE DIDN'T CREATE A BRIDGE. &gt;&gt; He just eliminated THE GAP. YOU CAN'T EVEN FALL INTO THE CHASM. IT'S GONE. WHERE ARE YOUR SINS? YOU NEVER SINNED IN THE FIRST PLACE. HEY, THERE AIN'T NO GAP. YOU CAN'T EVEN FALL OFF THIS ROCK OF REVELATION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW POWERFUL HE ELIMINATED THE GAP. [screaming] &gt;&gt; He said, "And there's NOT EVEN A CHASM THERE. &gt;&gt; A MAN AND GOD BECOME FATHER AND SON. THERE'S NO SIN AT ALL." &gt;&gt; WELL, go ahead and put your dancing shoes on. I'M SORRY. I'M OLDFASHIONED. I believe all the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I get excited about it. You I &gt;&gt; You mean old devil, you've been lying? YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME I WASN'T FORGIVEN. WELL, YEAH. YOU KNOW, YOU DID this and you did that. You know, you'll never be You'll never be the bride of Jesus Christ. The No, no, no, no. Yeah. You see, you see, you ain't no manifested son or daughter of God. You can never, you know, your foolish version. You know, you better start handing out bottles of water because that's the only way you're going to get in, right? OH, NO. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEING sure where we're standing. &gt;&gt; We got to know where we're standing. Oh, praise God. Listen to a vindicated pro. This is the reading of your will. THIS IS MALACHI 4:5. THIS IS YOUR IDENTIFICATION. THIS IS TELLING YOU WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT GOD'S DONE. He says, "A man and and and A MAN AND GOD BECOME FATHER AND SON. THERE'S no sin at all." He puts them in the sea of of the bleach of forgetfulness and can't even remember them no more. Hallelujah. Now, we can't do that. WE'RE HUMAN. WE COULD FORGIVE, but we cannot forget. But God is infinite and he's so great that he can absolutely forget you. Even did it. Well, take that to the devil AND GIVE HIM A BLACK EYE. HE'D BEEN TRYING TO BRING UP YOUR PAST AND TRYING TO REMIND YOU OF YOUR PAST AND TELL YOU THIS AND THAT, BUT OH, YOU CAN TELL THAT OLD DEVIL NAUGHTY. CAN YOU IMAG? CAN YOU IMAGINE OUR ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN COMING TO GOD AND TRYING TO TELL GOD AND SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM UH YOU WANT TO YOU KNOW, YOU YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM THE KINGDOM AND AND YOU KNOW, BUT YOU'RE A RIGHTEOUS GOD. YOU'RE A GOD OF LAW. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN LAW, THEY'RE NOT EVEN RIGHTEOUSNESS ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THE WORD THAT YOU'VE GIVEN TO THEM BECAUSE THEY DID THIS AND THIS AND THIS AND THIS. YOU REMEMBER? NO. WHAT? Could you imagine HOW MAD THE DEVIL WOULD GET? WELL, WAIT A SECOND. &gt;&gt; WAIT, you're God. &gt;&gt; I know WHAT THEY DID. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DID. And you know what they did. Nope. Could you I I COULD YOU SEE THAT DEVIL STARTING TO GET STEAM and get mad? Well, you mean you YOU'RE GOD. YOU KNOW ALL THINGS. You know everything. YEAH. AND I KNOW THAT WHEN I PAID THE PRICE ON CALVARY, I SAID, "IT IS FINISHED." AND THEY WERE THE VIRTUOUS, SINLESS BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. THEY NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. I HAVE removed the chasm. There is no gap. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming] HALLELUJAH. I TELL YOU, WE MIGHT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FORGET WHAT, BUT WHEN THE DEVIL starts to bring IT TO OUR REMEMBRANCE, I TELL YOU, WE JUST NEED TO REMIND THAT OLD DEVIL, HEY, I have been forgiven, and God doesn't even know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, we can't do that. WE'RE HUMAN. WE CAN FORGIVE, BUT CANNOT FORGIVE. BUT GOD IS INFINITE, and he's so great that he can absolutely forget you even did it. Think of it. Hey, you might not be able to amen me, but you can amen a prophet. &gt;&gt; You never did even sin. And there puts a man again IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD, HIS FATHER. And you're his child. WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD NOW. NOT WILL BE. NOW WE ARE THE SONS and daughters OF GOD. OH MY. THAT MAKES A METHODIST FEEL LIKE SHOUTING, DOESN'T IT? &gt;&gt; WELL, glory to God. If a Methodist is going to sound like shouting, then I, AS A MESSAGE BELIEVER, I KIND OF FEEL LIKE SHOUTING, TOO. to think that I never did it in THE FIRST PLACE. I KNOW IT'S A TALL ORDER TO BE THE MANIFESTED BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. I KNOW IT'S A TALL ORDER TO GO IN A RAPTURE. I KNOW IT'S A TALL ORDER TO GO INTO A BODY CHANGE. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE AIN'T NO BAGGAGE HOLDING ME DOWN. THERE AIN'T NO SIN. THERE AIN'T NOTHING THAT I EVER DID. THERE AIN'T NO HABITS. THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S HANGING ON ME THAT'S GOING TO KEEP ME FROM WALKING INTO THE INHERITANCE THAT I'VE BEEN PREDESTINATED BY ALMIGHTY GOD. SO WHEN THAT DEVIL TRIES TO BRING IT UP AND TRIES TO TELL ME, "WELL, NOT YOU. YEAH, ME. WHY? BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD FROM MY THEOPHONY. I have heard THE READING OF MY WILL. I AM PREDESTINATED UNTO ADOPTION. MY NAME HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. HEY, THAT MAKES ME SOUND LIKE SHOUTING. I THINK I'LL SHOUT ABOUT IT. WHY? I AM THE SINLESS, VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Not I am going to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; I am. Not that I am a redeemed son of God. I AM NOT THAT I WILL BE FORGIVEN. I AM NOT THAT I WILL BE JUSTIFIED. I AM NOT THAT my name will be written in THE BOOK OF LIFE. MY NAME'S ALREADY WRITTEN ON THE man's book of life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Now, just moving quickly to a close. Brother Brandham says this, AND I I JUST THOUGHT I would would would I I put this quote in there because I want to read a very familiar quote, but brother uh Cosman this morning was talking about the reading of our will. And this is a real familiar quote. So just act like you never heard it before. Just act like this is new. And and maybe somebody here you might just say amen. Then we stand Christ the mystery of God real. Then we stand justified in the presence of God as a drop OF INK DROPPING INTO A TUB full of bleach. You'll never find the stain of ink no more. &gt;&gt; It went somewhere. It'll never come back again. And when a man &gt;&gt; is truly redeemed, &gt;&gt; that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it, &gt;&gt; his sins are [screaming] deolished. It's gone. It's separated. It's dropped into the ink of the blood of Jesus Christ. And it's never to be remembered. God forgets it. and he stands as a son and daughter of God in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; You might not feel his presence. &gt;&gt; HEY, YOU MIGHT FEEL EMPTY. YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL LIKE HIS PRESENCE IS AROUND YOU. BUT OH, PRAISE GOD. I AIN'T GOT TO FEEL IT TO KNOW THAT I'M STANDING IN HIS PRESENCE BECAUSE A PREDESTINATED SEED ON THE INSIDE OF ME HAS HEARD THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR AND IT HAS TOLD ME I NEVER SINNED in the first place. AND RIGHT NOW I'M STANDING IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD [screaming] MY FATHER. HALLELUJAH. I KNOW THAT HIS ANGELS ARE ENCAMPED around them THAT FEAR HIM. AND I KNOW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. I KNOW CHRIST IS PRESENT RIGHT [screaming] HERE, RIGHT NOW. THE PRESENT TENSE OF GOD IS RIGHT HERE. OH, I AIN'T GOT TO FEEL IT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? BECAUSE I GOT THE REVELATION OF IT, IT GOES BEYOND MY FEELINGS. IT GOES BEYOND MY SENSATIONS. IT GOES DOWN INTO THE SOUL REALM. AND IT'S SO REAL THAT THAT SOUL REALM TAKES OVER THIS VESSEL. AND I JUST CAN'T HELP TO SING. I CAN'T HELP TO SHOUT. I CAN'T HELP TO SAY, "THERE IS NO MORE CHASM. THERE IS NO MORE SIN. I'M RIGHT NOW IN THE PRESENCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I could tone it down, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD, GIVE ME A STYLE. &gt;&gt; God anoints the man of the hour to catch the people of the hour. Well, you know what? MAYBE THIS AIN'T YOUR HOUR, BUT IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUR. SO, LET'S JUST ALL get together AND BELIEVE FOR ONE ANOTHER AND ACCEPT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; I got a quote for that if you didn't like it. RIGHT? WE'RE ALL FLOWERS. WE EXPRESS OURSELVES ANY KIND OF WAY WE WANT. I COULD READ A, YOU KNOW, PROBLEM IS THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID WE GET SPIRITUAL AMNESIA WHEN WE GET CAUGHT between two opinions. Well, IS IT THE WORD OF GOD OR ISN'T IT? &gt;&gt; SO, IF IT'S SOFT SPOKEN OR IF IT'S YELLED, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? &gt;&gt; It's the word of God or isn't it? &gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM IS IS WE'VE GOTTEN TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS. WELL, it's a little too excitable. So, you know, I I don't want to I don't want to say amen because then I'm amening emotion. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah. I I I'LL HIT IT RIGHT WHERE that's where we're at. Well, you know what? IF THE PREACHER'S RUNNING ALL over the place, IF IF I START TO SAY AMEN AND IF I GET EMOTIONAL, that means, you know, I'm I'm kind of I'm kind of uh leaning towards an emotion and and I'm just amen and emotion and not the word. Well, yeah. Now, if I'm running around and SCREAMING AND I AIN'T SAYING WHAT A PROPHET SAID, DON'T SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; But whether I whisper it OR WHETHER I SHOUT IT, ONE THING WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS AMEN IT. BUT SOME OF US HAVE GOTTEN STUCK BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS, WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO AMEN it or to SO WE DON'T DO NOTHING. &gt;&gt; YEAH. But when somebody ELSE FITS YOUR STYLE AND TASTE, WE CAN HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE LOUDEST ONE IN THE BUILDING. AMEN. [screaming] THAT'S RIGHT. I LIKE HIS STYLE. BUT THEN AN EVANGELIST come and SAY THE SAME EXACT THING. NOTHING. &gt;&gt; BUT THEN EVANGELISTS COME AND SAY THE SAME THING. [screaming] AMEN. AND THEN AND THEN SOMEBODY COME AND they teach and lay out the word. Nothing. &gt;&gt; Look friends, I I AM TIRED OF BEING CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS. I JUST WANT SOMEBODY TO TELL ME THE TRUTH. WHETHER YOU WHISPER IT, WHETHER YOU SHOUT IT, THERE'S A SEED INSIDE OF ME THAT'S PREDESTINATED TO RECEIVE IT. AND I WILL SAY AMEN. THE PROPHET OF GOD TOLD US AMEN. WELL, IF YOU CAN AT LEAST JUST DO SOMETHING SAY GET THEM. GET THEM, PREACHER. GET HIM. &gt;&gt; I know some of us got it all figured out. And and they know and and I look look I've heard it. I you know I don't get nothing when he preaches. Well, that's all right. Some people do. But don't rob them of their blessing &gt;&gt; because your attitude is what's hindering the moving of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm sorry. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE UP HERE ANYWAYS, BUT WHAT WE GOT IS A BAD CASE OF SPIRITUAL AMNESIA. &gt;&gt; WELL, we're afraid TO BE WHAT GOD'S CALLED US to be. &gt;&gt; But I tell you WHAT, IF WE TAKE THE VEILS OUT OF THE WAY, &gt;&gt; SEE, that's our problem. We look at it too much of the flesh. WHETHER IT'S BROTHER BILLY, WHETHER IT'S BROTHER DAVID, WHETHER IT'S BROTHER ANDREW, WHETHER IT'S OUR PASTOR, I want to say if THEY'RE SAYING WHAT A VINDICATED PROPHET SAID, "AMEN. [screaming] AMEN." SICK AND BOY, GET THEM. &gt;&gt; But you know what THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID? WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT BETWEEN two opinions, you lose your reasoning. &gt;&gt; Brother Matthew's preaching tonight. I don't even know why I'm here. You mean I got to listen to Junior again? You mean Brother Ben, he ain't been serving the Lord a tenth of the time that I've been preaching. I can't get nothing from him. &gt;&gt; He's just a baby. What can he tell me? &gt;&gt; Brother Billy. We all love Brother Billy. Give me brother Billy. He didn't like that. Brother Billy, you know, I'll have to throw him under the bus with all the rest of us. WHY DOES BILLY HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING? HE'S [snorts] ALWAYS PREACHING, ALWAYS LEADING SONGS, ALWAYS STANDING BEHIND HERE. You know, there's spirits like that. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about spiritual amnesia. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOVE. LOOK THAT LOOK I I'VE I'VE HEARD IT. I I've heard it and and and I marvel at and I I think it's wonderful and it's THE WAY THAT GOD THAT GOD DOES IT IS AND SOMETIMES ONE PREACHER CAN SAY SOMETHING AND A AND then another one COME ALONG AND LIKE MAN I've never heard that in all my life. YOU KNOW PASTORS will be like I've been preaching on that for four weeks. Some like one planth one waterth but God gives the increase. ALL I WANT IS THE INCREASE. And I'm sick AND TIRED OF DEVILS TRYING TO ROB THIS CHURCH OF THE INCREASE. GOD GIVE US A MESSAGE. HE give us the Holy Spirit. I said WE OUGHT TO WELCOME IT. WE OUGHT TO AMEN IT. WE OUGHT TO SHOUT. WE OUGHT TO DANCE. WE OUGHT TO RUN. WE IF IT'S SLAIN, I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. BUT WHATEVER IT IS, I WANT TO SAY IT'S for you. &gt;&gt; Well, somebody didn't like that, but I said it anyways. May May I just say this that for the critic who's getting critical right now, go listen to getting in the spirit &gt;&gt; and I'll leave it right there. But I when did we ever get to the place where we can't have joy &gt;&gt; and and you know what WE COULD TAKE TIME AND I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M OUT HERE BUT YOU I DIDN'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYWAY so here I am. The prophet OF GOD ACTUALLY SAT IN THE SEAT OF PLAYING THE CRITIC AND HE SAID, "OH MY GOODNESS, HERE COMES THAT DANCING in the church." and he got to thinking, "NOT IN MY CHURCH." And you know what? THANK GOD HE GAVE US A PROPHET. HE THOUGHT, "YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE I'LL JUST RUN IT THROUGH THE SCRIPTURE." And he got to running IT THROUGH THE SCRIPTURE, WHAT A VINDICATED PROPHET DOES. AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? AND I FOUND OUT THAT DANCING means victory. And you know what he said? Before I REALIZED WHAT I WAS DOING, I WAS OUT THERE in the middle dancing with her. Not like that. BUT HE WAS DANCING ALL AROUND. WHY? BECAUSE HE GOT TO LOOKING IN THE WORD AND he said, "MY GOODNESS, IF DANCING MEANS VICTORY, WHAT KIND OF VICTORY DO I GOT?" YOU RUN IT THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT. YOU RUN IT THROUGH CALVARY. YOU RUN IT THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES AND THEN A VINDICATOR PROPHESY, YOU ARE HIS VICTORY. HALLELUJAH. I GOT VICTORY TONIGHT. I GOT THE VICTORY OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. I GOT THE VICTORY OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. SOMEBODY WANTS THE JOY OF THEIR SALVATION RESTORED. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT ABOUT THE VICTORY THAT THE GREAT MIGHTY CONQUEROR HAS CONQUERED. AND WHAT A RESURRECTION THAT WAS. AND WHAT A RESURRECTION THIS IS. ARISE AND SHINE. THY LIGHT HAS COME. &gt;&gt; We're standing right now in the presence of God. Amen. Now we are the sons OF GOD. NOT WILL BE. We are. Now we are redeemed. Brothers, if you can cue that up, I'm going to play that uh last six minutes of spiritual amnesia. Whatever the paragraph, uh, Brother Gary, was it 215? We have Satan's answer. God has vindicated himself. God has proved himself to his promise in this day. Hallelujah. The headship is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ the risen Lord is here in THE SAME POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION THAT HE EVER WAS MANIFESTING HIMSELF. THERE IS THE DEVIL'S ANSWER. WHERE IS THE DEVIL'S ANSWER? &gt;&gt; It ain't in a tomb in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Oh, BUT IT WAS RESURRECTED ON THE THIRD DAY. &gt;&gt; And we're living in THE HOUR OF RESURRECTION. WHERE IS his victory? Is it in a tomb in Jeffersonville? &gt;&gt; NO, SIR. HIS RESURRECTION IS in you. AND IN YOU, WE ARE [screaming] HIS VICTORY. AND RIGHT NOW, HE IS HERE IN THE SAME POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION THAT HE EVER WAS MANIFESTING HIMSELF. THERE'S THE DEVIL'S ANSWER. I WANT TO TELL THAT OLD DEVIL, HE IS RIGHT HERE THIS NIGHT IN THE SAME POWER AND SAME MANIFESTATION THAT HE EVER WAS. AND I KNOW WHERE [screaming] I AM STANDING. I'LL PRAY FOR 1,000 PEOPLE. AND IF NOT ONE OF THEM GETS HEALED, MY GOD IS A HEALER. AND I'VE BEEN GIVEN A DIVINE COMMISSION TO CAST OUT EVIL SPIRITS, TO LAY HANDS ON THE SICK, AND THEY SHALL RECOVER. I HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED TO DO THE GREATER WORKS. I CAN SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN. MOUNTAIN, [screaming] YOU GOT TO GO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; We are the devil's answer. Hallelujah. I'm feeling pretty good. I feel like I can finally start preaching. The Bible says, "Let this mind be in you." &gt;&gt; That was also in Christ Jesus. who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God. Listen to what he says. rising of the sun and he being the groom, the bride has to come forth &gt;&gt; because it's part of him &gt;&gt; and it can only be the manifestation of fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the bride. &gt;&gt; It can only manifest it DOES THIS IF IT DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM the groom, it isn't the bride. Now, we can look at the age, we can look at the church, and we look at we can look at the individual. So, if there's something in my life that's manifesting the groom, THAT'S NOT TELLING ME I'M NOT PART OF HIM. WHAT IT'S TELLING ME THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S HANGING ON ME THAT'S NOT part of him. &gt;&gt; And I need deliverance. I need to bring it under subjection. &gt;&gt; He says it isn't. He says it it does something different from the groom. It isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone AND LIFE OF HIS LIFE, POWER OF HIS POWER. She is him. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and call me a fanatic. Call me a Pentecostal. Call me a holy roller. Call me whatever you want to call me. BUT ONE THING, YOU BETTER CALL ME. CALL ME REDEEMED. &gt;&gt; Call me the bride of Christ. Tell me she is him. And it ain't about what I can do. It's about what HE'S ALREADY DONE. HE'S ALREADY removed the doubt. He's already written my name on the lamb's book of life. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] BUT I WANT TO bring it a little further. Let us go on under perfection. &gt;&gt; Right? We're we're settling that. I think we've taken some time TO SETTLE THAT. AND OUR PROPHETS HAVE BEEN PREACHING on character. &gt;&gt; Now that we know where we're standing, I TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, [snorts] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; It's time to start taking that word AND PUT IT INTO ACTION. What did we hear in that opening quote? No matter what anybody does or what anybody says, let them say what they want to know where I am standing. Hallelujah. Now I just leave off here. We getting a little long and that tends to happen. [snorts] Prophet of God says, "As long as you still love the world, no matter how much you confess to be up here, you're not up here, you're down there. He that loves the world and the things of the world, the love of God hasn't entered into him yet. Now, now don't let the devil condemn you of that. You're just still scratching around in the barnyard. But what when brother Brandon was preaching that message about uh spiritual amnesia, he says the church has forgotten what she is. We act like the world. And he SAID IT SHOWS THAT WE GOT spiritual amnesia. But he goes on and says, "But when you raise above that to the heavenly things, then set your affections on things above because you are risen with Christ and now seated together in heavenly places." Look, that's where we belong. We But we belong flying high above the cares of this world. I'm going to have to stop, but I I just want to preface this with saying this and every may everything maybe we were leading up to. I think sometimes if we're not careful, we get spiritual amnesia and we forget who we are. We forget our character of what the message is wanting to produce in us. &gt;&gt; And brother Ben would take time and show how Nebuchadnezzar, he told he didn't even know he was a human anymore. And I'm wondering if we're starting to lose our identification of of believers. Nebuchadnezzar didn't even know he was a man anymore. Are we forgetting we're the bride of Christ? There's a certain way that we dress. And I'm not talking about uh you know uh uh uh uh uh being conformed. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about conforming. But I see I I I see you know there's a drift in our dress and and the way we conduct ourselves and the music that we listen to. And I wonder if if we're not careful, we're getting a bad case of spiritual amnesia. [snorts] You know, the music we listen to is sounding more and more like the world. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we got spiritual amnesia. I I wouldn't doubt there's some oldfashioned Pentecostals with some of the stuff we listen to, they like, uh-uh. And I and I tell you, I it reminds me that Jesus said, "I sanctify myself for their sake." What did he have to sanctify himself for? &gt;&gt; The sinless lamb of God. What What was he doing? He was being an example. &gt;&gt; And And I think we've forgotten what we're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; We We're getting so close to the edge now. Just Just as close, but as long as we can say we're believers, I say, "Let's get closer to the wall. Let's get as close to this message. Let's get as close. LOOK, I MEAN I MEAN DON'T DON'T WEAR YOUR SKIRTS JUST as short to get away with it or your your clothes all these things and brothers and how you conduct yourself. I didn't mean to get on all that. I want to I want to let you go. BUT BUT BUT I SAY OH HAVE WE GOTTEN a little spiritual amnesia that we we forgot the reading of the will that we heard this morning of what we are really supposed to be and what the character of God is really supposed to produce in our life. &gt;&gt; Ye are the light of the world. Just cue that up for me so I can stop. Now let me instruct these people here first. My friends, whatever you're here for, he know I can prove it to you to take one by one bring you up here on this platform and there won't be one thing that he won't make known. Now that's been since I was a little boy. That gift's not in question. But the question is, can you receive it? Do you believe it? Now you share. What if you HEAR THAT? THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING. HE keeps his word. Then just believe that you receive it and accept it. Raise up and say, "Lord God, I'm here to accept it." AND JUST STAY THERE till it happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like Buddy Robinson said one time in a corn field. He said, "Lord, if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back, you'll find a pile of bones laying right here." &gt;&gt; He was dead earnest. And you're not going to get anything from God that you get desperate about. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, have you noticed today prop? Have you noticed today what we do? We actually we got enough God about us and we come up to the platform. We say yes, maybe I better come up. Now, this is experience of worldwide. Yes, I better go up and stand say well well I don't know here I am. See what a place to be in. THERE'S NO FIRE BURNING. There's no enthusiasm. THERE'S NOT A GO INTO IT. And as an evangelist, that just kills me to see God's people in that shape. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be on fire. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, WHAT is it? It's exactly what I told you. Revelation 3, you're lukewarm. And he said, because you're lukewarm, I'm going to spew you out of my mouth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. And if he said that, that's what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; So, let's not be that crowd. You're you're needy. LET'S GET IT OR DIE. THAT'S RIGHT. Let's get it or die. &gt;&gt; Now, my dear brother, sister, if I could come down and help you do something, I'd sure do it. &gt;&gt; Now, by gift, I can tell you what you're here for. I can tell you what by the Holy Ghost, by God's spirit, tell you what you've come for, what you've done, what will be the future or something like that. But that don't take care of it. &gt;&gt; You've got to accept this yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to be you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, are you ready? Raise up your hand. Say, "I'm ready. I'm ready to die right here." Uh, don't do it unless you mean it. I'm ready to die right here. Or get what I want from God. Amen. Are you really ready? Then let the audience stand everywhere. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now, together, together, let's unite ourselves together. &gt;&gt; Let's pray and let's just you ministers now walk up to these people here, everyone. And you're representing the hands of Christ. Now you that wants the Holy Spirit. You that wants that experience, not a emotional excitement. You want THE HOLY GHOST, THE LIFE, the germ of life inside you. And you want to get rid of that amnesia that's making you can't identify yourself. You don't know where YOU STAND. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE. Let's get rid of it right now. There's a new birth here for you. A real genuine new birth. Now, let's lay our hands over on these people. Let's everyone raise up our hands and pray with one accord. Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, grant all that in Jesus Christ's name that the Holy Ghost will come tonight, this Saturday night, where the Holy Ghost like a rushing mighty wind. MAY THESE PEOPLE BE BAPTIZED INTO THE HOLY GHOST. MAY THE FIRE AND POWER OF GOD NOT LEAVE THEM. If you're here in the morning, MAY THEY STAY stay until the Holy Ghost come. That's the idea. That's it. There it is. That's the Holy Ghost coming. That's the Leave it now. Accept it. Be filled with his Amen. May we all just stand. I was just pricricked in my heart just just as the prophet of God was closing that out. I say, "Oh, I I don't want any spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I don't want to forget who I am." I say, "Oh, may I cry out to God? Let the baptism of the Holy Ghost come. Lord, take away any spiritual amnesia that's made me forget who I am and and maybe forget what the message of the hour is. If I've made it some type of religion, if I've made it some type of explanation, as long as I say, "Amen. I got it. Oh no, but it's the person of Jesus Christ. And I say, "Oh, oh, just as he said right here, heavenly father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, grant it, Lord, that in the Jesus Christ name that the Holy Ghost will come tonight, this Saturday night where the Holy Ghost fell like a rushing mighty wind. May these people be baptized into the Holy Ghost." I say, "My, if it worked for the prophet right there in 1964, I say if it was good enough for him, it's good enough for me. I want more of the Holy Ghost." I pray God if if if your Holy Ghost was falling in 1964, it's still falling today. Why? Because the door is still open. I want the Holy GHOST MOVING IN MY LIFE, MOVING in my church, moving in my family. Uh not just between these four walls, but when I GO OUT OF HERE, I WANT THE HOLY GHOST MOVING in my life. Amen. Do you you agree with that? But you know, the problem is that if we're not careful, we get stuck between two opinions and we we we we want to we want to be the judge of what is God and what's not of God. &gt;&gt; Is it just emotion? Is it not just emotion? I I tell you what, I I don't know anything about all that. Alls I know is I once was lost &gt;&gt; and I was in a real bad situation and I I couldn't get out of it. But oh, the Bible said, "If you call on the name of the Lord, you shall be saved." And I come to find out God is not a man that he should lie. And he lifted me up out of the muck and mire. And he started to clean up my life and said, "It's okay. No, that don't matter. Let me wash you by the water of the word. You never did it in the first place." No, you don't worry about that. No. What What are you talking about? Why do you keep MENTIONING THESE THINGS? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. And what did he start TO DO? HE STARTED TO READ HIS WILL out over my life. He filled me with the Holy Ghost and put me into service. So I I all I know is I've heard from my theophony. If there's there if there's victory, it's mine. If there's healing, it's mine. IF THERE'S DEEP CONSECRATION, IT'S MINE. If there's humility and meekness, IT'S MINE. IT'S ALL MINE. EVERY BIT OF IT'S MINE. The joy, the scream, AND THE SHOUTING, IT'S ALL MINE. And the meekness and the humility AND THE SOVEREIGN OF THE STILL SMALL VOICE IS MINE. IT'S ALL MINE. I JUST WANT TO live in it. I want to breathe IT. I WANT TO ENJOY EVERY SINGLE PART OF IT. AND I DON'T WANT TO BE THE CRITIC. I I can't be cuz I know what he did for me. &gt;&gt; I'm not in a position where I can say, "Well, that's he's just doing that because of this and you know that's just this and that." No, I just want to sit back and say, "Oh, God, I believe you're doing for him what you did for me." You know, some things I don't understand and some things we do understand because we've been properly taught. But one thing I know we want, we just want to see the will of God moving in all of our lives. And I say, you know what, my if the prophet could preach spiritual amnesia here in [music] 1964, I believe it was. And a and and I I I say, you know what, Lord, I want your Holy Spirit moving in my life. And if if the seals can be open and here HE'S SHOWING US THAT, OH, YOU CAN HAVE ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE, but you know, you can still get spiritual amnesia. Lord, have I forgotten? Have I forgotten what the character of the message is supposed to look like in my life? Lord, have I let it become routine? Have I? Have I lost the joy of my salvation? Have I forgot how you want to manifest yourself in the way that I dress and the way that I act? Have I kind of made it all about me and I I forgot to make it all about you. Lord, I say, Lord, forgive me. Just as you prayed for these people, let's just all bow our heads. Lord, just as you prayed for these believers through your prophet, Lord, you said they had a a case of spiritual amnesia, Lord. And you were preaching that message for me, letting me know as your son that there is a disease called spiritual amnesia. And if we're not careful, situations and family crisis and bad decisions can can shock us. We forget who we are. If we forget what our inheritance is, Lord, just like your prophet showed that that old soldier boy who had amnesia, he got out of that train car and he got to looking around and he saw something familiar. Lord, thank you for this message. Lord, I saw something familiar. And I realized it was leading me back to my father, back to where I came from, Lord. And you're taking us all the way back before sin, back to an Eden condition. And Lord, we just want to surrender ourselves to you tonight and say, "Lord, forgive me if I've gotten a little spiritual amnesia." And I've allowed a pattern to set into my life to where I do good for a little while and then I kind of let off. And I'm starting to entertain things I I should entertain. And I realize, Lord, that you've come tonight to tell me I've got a little spiritual amnesia. I've I've got my eye off of the the reading of the will, Lord, that you've predestinated us unto adoption. And Lord, that that's our inheritance and that's our promise and that we can just tell that old devil, you've lost your hold. I'm remembering who I am because I've heard the message of the hour and it's telling me I don't belong in the chickenard. [snorts] Come up higher. come up out of the chicken yard and soar in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Lord, I just commit the people to you. May you just be their portion in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Let's just [music] sing this song. Help me sing it. Chasm at white [music] between us. How high the mountain [music and singing] I could not climb. In desperation, [music and singing] I turned to heaven and [music] spoke your name into the night. And through the [music and singing] darkness, your loving kindness. For through the [music] shadows of my soul, the word is [music] finished. The end is written. Jesus Christ my living [music] who could imagine [music] so great the God [music] of aes Step down for glory and to [music and singing] my to my [music] cross has spoken. [singing] Oh, I am for [music] the king of kings. Call me his [music] beautiful [singing] Savior. I'm [music] yours forever. Lord Jesus Christ, [music] my Lord. [singing] Oh hallelujah. [music] Praise the one who set me free. Hallelujah. Death has [music and singing] lost his grip on me. You have broken [singing] every chain and [music] salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, [music] my love. Oh, and they came the [singing] morning that [music] sealed the cry. Oh, and you just think about that tonight. Be [music] free. Oh, [singing] out of the silence. Oh, the roaring. [music] Oh, and declare. [singing] Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh [music] king in the morning till the crowd [music] very [singing] light begin [music] to bring out all the sil. might [music and singing] glory for [music] you as your single. [music] Praise the one who [singing] set me free. Hallelujah. [music] has lost his me. [singing and music] Oh, you are broken every chain. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus Christ. [music] Just sing it one more time. Oh, and hallelujah. [music] Praise the [singing] one who sets me free. [music] Hallelujah. Death has lost his grip on [music] me. You have broken every [singing] chain and [music] salvation in your name. Jesus Christ. [music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be his holy name. What a wonderful word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I I just appreciate that because you know to to the way to come out of amnesia is to come in contact with something that sounds familiar. It is actually tracing back your steps and looking and looking and looking until that eagle heard something that sounded right. until that eagle heard something that was contrary to everything they were telling him. They told him, "If you heard that voice, run. Don't listen to it. It's coming to eat you up." And the chicken heard the voice. All of them run. All of the sudden, the eagle hears the voice. Instead of running, all of the sudden, the voice makes sense. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I tell you, you could never figure out this message. &gt;&gt; You can study all you want. You will never figure it out. You will never line it all up just perfectly so you can believe it. It has to be something that you hear that don't make any sense, but you believe it anyway. &gt;&gt; It's something in THE HEART IS JUST TELLING YOU IT'S RIGHT. IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE THEOLOGY OF IT, BUT you were made to believe it. &gt;&gt; That's what takes away the amnesia. It It's not the the Let me say this. There's a lot of people that came in contact with this word. THEY STUDIED IT. THEY STUDIED it and they studied it. They stated it. Later on, they said, "Oh, guess what? It's not right." Really? 20, 30 years. It's you didn't FIND IT RIGHT. BUT WHAT? WHAT? WHY ARE YOU HERE TONIGHT? WHY ARE YOU HERE? IS IT BECAUSE YOU STUDIED IT ALL AND CAME UP WITH THE SAME CONCLUSION? NO. THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT THAT'S made to draw you in. There's something that's daily communicating and speaking to you. What is he doing? He's taking away the amnesia out of you. He's bringing the TRUE IDENTIFICATION OF WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE to begin with. &gt;&gt; Nobody can take away from you. Nobody. Nobody can bring you in and nobody can take you out. It's the voice of the bridegroom and only the bride can understand it. &gt;&gt; He says my sheep hears my voice and now that they will not follow. Why is he made it so that your heart is calibrated to hear it and it makes sense. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I say that's the greatest blessing we've ever had on this face of the earth. And I want to say this. If that's true, let's eat it. &gt;&gt; Let's drink it. Let it play in your house. Let it play in your car. Hear it. Feed of it. I I tell you, YOU BECOME WHAT YOU FEED ON. You become what you feed on. YOU HEAR IT TUNED SOMEWHERE. ALL OF THE SUDDEN YOUR BODY even unknowingly it comes out. HOW MUCH MORE IF WE STAY WITH THE WORD OF GOD EVERY DAY? I TELL YOU, YOU WOULD SPEAK. YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE YOUR OWN VOCABULARY. YOU WILL TALK THE WORD. YOU WILL THINK THE WORD. YOU WILL WALK THE WORD. YOUR YOUR BODY, EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU WILL CHANGE. WHY? Because that's what you are in contact with every day. &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't let the darkness affect you. You have a hiding place. When when IT GETS SO DARK AND WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T come to your into your hiding place, he he's here. He's made a way FOR YOU TO AVOID ALL OF THAT THAT'S HAPPENING. HE'S COME OUT AND TOOK YOU OUT OF Laudisia and set you aside into a special place where you can look at the darkness that's going on and say, "Thank God I'm not affected by it. &gt;&gt; He's made you so you can look those that are in darkness and they look at you and you become light to them. &gt;&gt; You become their only source of light. they can look at you and see this is what actually makes sense to me. This is what it means to be a Christian. All of this I mean you know I I I feel like people in the last days there are Christians waiting to whatever opportunity comes up they take it. They call themselves Christians but yet they live by any opportunity out there. We are Christians that only live by this. If he spoke it, we believe it. If he didn't speak it, we don't want anything to do with it. I say, we've been encouraged by the word of God today. We've been brought up in the heavenly places tonight. Let me say that, stay there. &gt;&gt; Stay in heavenly places. Don't let the world drag you down and in the mud. No. Stay in heavenly. Surround yourself with your heavenly places. Make your house a heavenly place. Make your car a HEAVENLY PLACE. MAKE YOUR ATMOSPHERE at work a HEAVENLY PLACE. SURROUND. DON'T DON'T GET OUT OF THAT ATMOSPHERE. Stay in it and let it become a reality every day. So those that will look at you, they will see that Christ is once again living. Amen. [music] Amen. Let's sing that song. Our God reigns.

Lord, may we have the right reaction to your word, Lord. Father, your [music] prophet taught us that the spirit of America's laughter and to laugh things off and to [snorts] be jokey. And Lord, we're to be serious, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Father, we heard tonight in that tape, he said, "If you're lukewarm, he'll spill you out of his mouth." And that's what he'll do. He said, "Lord, we don't want to be lukewarm. Lord, we want to be what you called us to be, what you predestinated us to be. Lord, may we have the faith to step into that, Lord. May you lead and guide us and give us a vision, Lord, that we not perish. Lord, we love you. We just thank you. We ask that you'd bless Brother Cosman and Brother Matthew, all that they've given today. Hey Lord, may you restore upon upon them, Lord. Father, we just ask that you go go with us from here [music] and protect us, Lord. If you Terry and we meet again, Lord, may you come and just minister to our hearts once again. We're just so thankful of the word we heard. May it be just an everpresent &gt;&gt; living God [music] coming out of us, Lord, and touching others and changing lives and calling those last ones in so we can go home, Lord. Lord, we just thank you so much in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I dismissed KFC. Why don't we sing that song?
