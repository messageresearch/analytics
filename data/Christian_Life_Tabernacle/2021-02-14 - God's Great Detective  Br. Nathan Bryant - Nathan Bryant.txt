we just want to commit the service to you in the name of jesus christ we ask and pray amen amen amen so good to be gathering the presence of the lord this morning i want to welcome everyone amen i know that there's a lot of people home and stuck in with the snow and ice certainly i want to welcome them this morning i'm told about the nathan's brian's church they uh closed because of snow and ice and they're joining us this morning and my fear streaming so we certainly want to welcome them amen happy to have them uh stream and one day we'll meet face to face amen i believe we won't have to worry about the weather amen we won't have to worry about anything we'll just amen worship god for eternity that's our heart desire amen brother mike can come at this time for our psalm writing amen morning put a couple extra layers on this morning you know the uh the two shortest chapters in the book of the bible are in the psalms one of them is psalm 134 it's only three verses long it's the second shortest chapter in the bible extra credit to those who know what the shortest is but you know in verse one even in this little this little chapter there's a there's a ton of good stuff in it you know i i couldn't even make it past verse one so in though psalm 134 1 it makes this statement it says behold bless ye the lord all ye servants of the lord that little statement bless the lord you know it's something we read it's something we say it's something that we sing but i'm just curious when we look at that statement what does that mean to bless the lord you know it we might say it's to praise him we might say it's to worship him we you know we know that song that we sing bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name what about the time in the scriptures when it says things like i will bless thee and i will bless them what about the time when jesus is preaching on the sermon on the mount it says blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled how about the times that we pray that the lord would bless us or we give a testimony that we've been blessed or that such and such a thing as a blessing is it praise then is it worship what does it mean to bless the lord and if he blesses me how can i possibly bless him the same way you know there's a thing that i do you know it's interesting even that phrase bless the lord this is just free but david's the one who really made that he's the one that says it the most out of 22 times in the scriptures david says it 18 times but there's this thing i do whenever there's a phrase or a word or whatever that just just trying to comprehend a little bit what the word might mean when it uses that i go back to the very first time that that word is used in the scripture and more often than not it sort of defines itself the first time it's used and it turns out the very first time that that word bless is used this is in genesis 12 2 when the lord is calling abraham and he makes this statement he says and i will make of thee a great and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing the first time that the lord uses the phrase bless he identifies it as making someone's name great you know he basically describes giving abraham a name an identity a reputation a witness that is great you know and sometimes we'll look at all the blessings that he had in terms of flocks and herds and riches and whatnot and say that he was definitely blessed but the real blessing is the fact that when you look at his testimony in the scripture he's described as a man of faith as the father of our faith even as a friend of god not as the one who lied about who his wife was to protect his own skin not as the one who laughed when the lord first told him he was going to have a son in his old age none of that instead he had a name he had an identity of being the father of our faith and a friend of god he was given a great name he was blessed you know when jacob went into isaac snuck into isaac to get his blessing and if you read it what that was in genesis 27 28-29 when isaac blessed him he did so by making his name great he said let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee his blessing was to be given a name an identity a testimony a reputation if you will so how do we bless the lord we bless the lord in exactly the same way by making his name great you know we have been whenever you make someone's name great you're broadcasting his identity his name his attributes in everything that you do you know name is an identity it's a set of attributes that that describes a person a character and all their relationships so that when someone's name or someone's identity is made great it's broadcasting the collective character and attributes of that individual you know in exodus 33 when moses asked the lord to show him his glory you remember the story where he put him in a cleft of the rock caused him to see his back parts as he passed by he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and in exodus 34 6 when he actually passed by it was a continuous proclamation going forth declaring the attributes of the lord blessing the lord so when you see in the scriptures statements like bless the lord bless the lord or bless ye the lord my servants like in psalm 134 you know what to do it's about proclaiming his attributes it's about making his name great it's about making his identity known in all that you do and in exchange he blesses us by giving us a name that is great his name his identity his attributes so i just you know that just kind of stuck out to me as i was reading that little scripture bless ye the lord all ye his servants what is that it's to make his name great in all that you do so let's just read that together and hopefully that blesses you like it did me it's just three little verses in psalm 134 says behold bless ye the lord all ye servants of the lord which by night stand in the house of the lord lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the lord the lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of zion amen amen god bless you man of your seats man let's sing at calvary years of spending vanity amen [Music] all years i spent in panicking [Music] oh [Music] [Music] multiplied [Music] see

please pray for my friend robert um robert i mean he was put in the hospice a couple of days ago amen amen i know we've been told men when the doctors have done all that they could and then when they've given the last word and everything amen we have the right to petition another physician amen and that's the great physician we can certainly take it out before him this morning and pray that he'll move on our brightest friend and he will just touch him and do according to his will and way and if you have a need upon your heart do those that are home and those that are streaming amen it's

new albany nathan's brother nathan's church they're watching today streaming since their church lot is covered with ice so they're the church of the closed door this morning but and we also are very nice to have uh nathan's family with us rebecca phillip nathaniel and princess ruth is with us this morning so we're certainly nice to have them this morning amen you may be seated here at this time we're going to have a baby dedication this morning and uh so we're gonna dedicate caleb daniel stefan this morning and so i'd like to invite the family to come up and that would be great and grandpa come up and join us we'll pray come on you got your minister of the gospel you need to come up and dedicate this grandson with us [Music] bring them in bring it [Music] amen can i hold him that's a good looking baby oh i got the message amen amen i i i i love this scripture uh that's written in the book of numbers and the 13th chapter and it said caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to over come and the the hebrew meaning of caleb is faithful devoted wholehearted bold and brave and you know just that exercise of faith when he said you know we are more than able to take it all the children of israel perished in the wilderness except for joshua and caleb because they believed god's promise and this is the faith that want caleb possess so uh brother like we like to do we'd like you to pray for your son first and and you dedicate him to the lord and then me and grandpa joined and praying for amen lord heavenly father we're so thankful lord jesus that you have gifted a baby unto us his name is caleb daniel we're so thankful for him lord we ask you to bless him lord and as he grows lord peace keep him healthy lord

all these things lord we we're thankful and we dedicate him back into your arms lord for that's the best arms to be in we love you and we thank you for everything in jesus name we pray amen amen come over here and join me in prayer he got behind the whole pulpit and he feels that call to preach that let's paper here together our gracious heavenly father father grandpa and father together we stand as servants of the lord and we dedicate caleb back to you his father has committed him back into your hands father and we join in his prayer father asking that he be bold as his name says and faithful and wholehearted father and lord may he one day steal the people and preach the promises of god's word thank you we ask you to bless them and be with them this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen amen amen god bless you thank you okay god bless you sis wonderful amen amen amen hey buddy god bless you thank you all so much [Music] hey man you know every time i i look at a little baby or dedicate a baby i just can't believe they grow up you know and it doesn't seem like in no time flat you're you know they're walking around taller than you are and unlike people say i'm not shrinking p everybody else is getting bigger so uh we're blessed this morning to have brother nathan with us this morning nathan bryant from new albany as we said the church of the open door and his congregation watching via internet we know that a storm is blown in i've never seen a time where there's so many efforts to try to close the church doors but we appreciate you that have made the journey out this morning to be here in fellowship the day may progressively get worse if you are comfortable with coming back we certainly welcome you back this evening some of us live closer if your drive is a little more treacherous then please feel free to stream online but we'll try to stream our service this evening also and we're close enough brother nathan and i can walk to church if it gets too bad and you'd do that for me would you rather praise the lord and and uh so uh so but anyway it because it was snow it wasn't too bad but sometimes after it's driven on and it gets packed it might get a little slick anyway so anyway if you feel at all uncomfortable with coming to service we certainly understand and once again all of you that have joined us by way of live stream uh we certainly uh trust that you'll be blessed this morning and so let's just go forward with god's word this morning let's stand and let's turn our hearts to the lord and act as we you know as we sing amazing grace to invite brother nathan to the pulpit just turn your hearts to the lord this morning and and just ask god to speak to you you know i don't believe any of you have visited uh much with nathan uh this week and i certainly haven't talked of anything about anybody or any problems or anything like that or what anybody needs or what anybody's got on their heart for prayer and what their desire might be in their heart so there's only one that knows that and that's the lord he knows your heart he knows what you have need of even before you ask and and if if you could just have that confidence in him like the song said i look to jesus and you'd be surprised that god just used a vessel of flesh to really speak to you and i know some of you are at home and i know many of the people that stream that can't make it to service they get dressed up in their church clothes and they they don't have the coffee cup in their hand they get dressed up like they're going to church and they sit there and and they enter into the service and ask god to speak to him do you believe he can speak to you this morning that's what makes it personal that he can take a man that's willing to get out of the way and not say what he thinks you want to hear or not try to say i'm only going to preach something i'm not going to just but he's true and honest to what god puts on his heart to pray and when he preaches that you find out that you'll walk out of here saying that's what i prayed last night that's the scripture i read we were just talking about that the other day that just answered my question because jesus christ is truly the same yesterday today and forever and he's present here this morning to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think so as we invite our brother to the pulpit this morning let's sing that song amazing grace sing grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] oh that grace that taught my heart [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] is oh just think of it when we've been there [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] let's just worship as our brothers [Music] is [Music] praise god blessing it this way this morning oh through many many days [Music] it's his grace [Music] let's sing it again this way oh praise god he's worthy of your praise this morning praise god praise god we'll praise god praise god praise god oh praise god praise god oh praise god oh praise god oh praise god praise god praise god amen god bless you richly and good to be with you again some people blame me for bringing this cold weather but i think it beat us here so try not to blame me too bad but good to be in church this morning brother branham in a message called the church in its condition in 1962 he talks about how that he would go up into the northern areas and british columbia and out in the alaskan highway and different places and how the people would actually have to come with dog sleds and things to the service and he said no doubt there'll be a great outpouring of the spirit because where there's little bl where there's little uh effort and little sacrifice put in there's little blessing but where there's big sacrifice put in there's a big blessing so uh you had to put out a little more sacrifice to come this morning so i pray that there'll be a great blessing this morning not because that i'm here not even because brother david's here but because jesus promised that he'd be here he said wherever two or three are gathered together he'd be in their midst so i i i'm excited this morning to know that he's here with us it puts me at ease to know that he said he'd never leave me nor forsake me and and want to greet the our church at home uh literally this morning there at home and um and we want to greet them and and appreciate those that are listening in that from the local area here and from back home where we're from and appreciate brother david giving us the opportunity to come and appreciate the work that the lord is doing through him here [Music] my we're truly a blessed people to have truth in this age aren't we an age of darkness where there's so much that uh just seems like everywhere you turn it's turmoil and chaos and fear but yet the the the believer has a peace that they know in whom they've believed and we know he's got it all in control amen god bless you jeremiah chapter 17 this morning if you turn with me jeremiah chapter 17 and just want to read there before we pray this morning brother david put the pressure to me he said i don't i don't want some canned sermon he said we want fresh manna this morning and and then we canceled our service i thought well if i preach something i've preached at home they've all heard that anyhow so something something new this morning that i've never preached before so you you pray for me jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 10 i the lord search the heart i tried the reins even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings amen may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word and i want to speak on a thought this morning of god's great detective god's great detective let's bow our heads together dear heavenly father lord we thank you for another opportunity to be assembled together lord for those of us that are here and lord for those that couldn't be here due to distance or due to weather lord i i thank you that they have through the form of media a way that they can assemble themselves together even though they're not physically here yet lord we're assembled around your word this morning and lord we thank you for a body of believers here in texas that still believes in your word and still believes in assembling themselves together and lord we we thank you for an opportunity lord just to speak what you've placed on my heart this morning and i pray that you'd help me to get myself out of the way lord i don't know the needs of the people but lord you know every need and you know the circumstance lord you know what they're facing and you know lord exactly the type of encouragement that they have need of and lord i don't have the ability to look into their life as a prophet would to know exactly what is what they're facing but lord we do have the word and we know that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and so i just pray this morning father that you would help me to get out of the way and anoint me to get into a channel that would speak something that would encourage them in lord whatever it is that they're facing may you just come by our way again this morning and lord speak to hearts we'll give you the glory and the praise for it in jesus christ's name and the church said amen god bless you and you can be seated this morning this word in in jeremiah chapter 17 that we read where it says i am the lord that searched the heart that word search is a greek word or a hebrew word excuse me that that means to search or to search for to search out to examine or to investigate and so we want to look at this this uh thought of god's great detective it's not something that i made up it's actually a quote that we'll read later in the service i heard a few months ago and and this phrase just stood out to me god's great detective and brother brandon when he refers to that he's referring to the holy spirit as being god's great detective and you know the god's detective is he's better than you you read of sherlock holmes or nancy drew and the hardy boys but god's detective is greater than anything they could do because they would have to which are obviously being fictional characters but any detective that you would look at whether it be real or fictional they would have to try to piece together a little bit at a time what they were trying to investigate or search for they didn't have the whole picture and so they would look for little clues and they would find evidence and try to piece it all together and and form a conclusion but god's great detective he had all the facts before there was ever a mystery he had all the facts and and you know many times many times an investigator they're actually trying to to reveal or expose certain things and and to try to prove certain facts but god actually did it the opposite way he had all the facts and then he veiled those in a mystery that he would reveal to his people down through time and so god when he looks at a problem he he knows the thoughts and the intents of the heart he knew who would be here this morning he knew what your path would be we're going to get into a little bit of predestination this morning that god by for knowledge you go back to romans chapter 8 in romans chapter 9 and god by foreknowledge could look down through time before there was ever time now that's you know we that's hard for us to wrap our mind around that god could look down through time before time existed god was in eternity but brother david he knew the time that we would be on the face of the earth before there was a concept of time and he could look and he knew your end he knew your beginning before adam was ever created on the earth before there was ever a molecule before there was ever anything that was created god the self-existing one brother branham said he couldn't even really be called god because god means an object of worship but that he was just the self-existing one out there in eternity but he looked down through time and he looked down through space and there was no space yet but he knew where you would be born and he knew who your parents would be and he knew who your grandparents would be and god could look down and see everything that would be from the very beginning to the very end he knows when he wrote his word he the back of the book is already written and satan is exposed and we know what his end is and you know it's interesting to see how that satan works because satan goes about it as though he doesn't know what his own end is but he knows he's already read the same book that we've read and he knows what his end will be but yet he's he keeps going out here and attempting different things but god has already exposed what the end of satan will be but i'm so thankful that he also exposed that for the predestinated we don't have an end oh my we didn't have the beginning because we were a part of god as an attribute of god now you had as far as your physical being you had a date we can all look back to and well my birthday was this this month and this day and this year but in god's eyes you were already existing back there with him he knew you would be and he knew what your progress would be he knew what your struggles would be he knew what your trials would be and so god could look down and search out the beginning through the end before there was ever any space time or anything like that and god knew all about it already you know that should give us a piece this morning that should give us a peace that no matter who's elected or who's impeached or who's not impeached or no matter what the disease comes out next or no matter what they say about coronavirus it hasn't shocked god god has never been shocked by anything that has happened when when when eve came and and and said all my the serpent beguiled me uh god didn't have to ring his hands together and go have a conference in the garden and say what are we gonna do we've got a problem here we need to come up with a plan of redemption to save these people gabriel uh uh michael a wormwood any of you all got any ideas of how we can have a plan of redemption there was already a plan of redemption in place before adam and eve were ever placed in the garden because it said that jesus was the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world well we know you that doesn't make a lot of sense intellectually because we can look and say well he was slain around 80 33 he wasn't slain before the foundation of the world but in god's mind and in god's thinking it was already a finished work because he had already seen what would be he had predestined and pre-planned what would take place and he already had a plan of redemption before there was anybody that needed to be redeemed he already had a plan of salvation remember it's a dual atonement not only salvation but also healing he already had a plan for salvation before there was anybody that was sick and even before jesus died on the cross brother branham said that when they lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness moses here he goes and he crafts this and god tells him lift it up before the people and those that will look will live oh it's time that we look and live again this morning amen you don't have to look to a man except the man christ jesus you don't need to look to nathan bryant but we do need to look to the word that god sent us look and live this morning there's life in it and so moses would lift up the brass serpent in the wilderness and all those that had been bitten by these snakes if they would look they would live brother branham said they were drawing dividends on a deposit that hadn't even been made yet oh if you can find me a plan like that brother matthew at a you find me a bank brother jackson that i can go down and draw dividends on an investment that i haven't even made yet oh you know i i'd like to collect my thousand dollar interest we don't show any deposits at all but i'm gonna make a deposit 40 years down the road they'll run you out of the building but god allowed his children in the wilderness journey back there to draw dividends on a deposit that hadn't even physically literally been made yet but in god's mind he already accepted that it was going to take place because he had already seen it amen now that's glorious isn't it but you know we we look at that oh thank you god for saying that you were going to come and be veiled in flesh and and that you were going to have a plan of salvation that you could do that and already heal people and let them draw dividends but you know god knows what your end will be as well and that's why the scripture says that now are we the sons of god amen now not not that we will future now we are seated in heavenly places with christ jesus but we want to put god off in the future somewhere but god looks at it as a finished work now maybe you're just getting started on your journey with god and maybe you've got a long way to go yet as far as the person in the pew besides you feels they look at you and all my they need to work on this and they need to learn more about that but god looks at the finished product and sees what you're going to be oh my psalm chapter 44 verse 20 if we have forgotten the name of our god or stretched our hands to a strange god shall not god search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the heart that shouldn't it shouldn't surprise people you know it's been it had been so long since we really had a vindicated prophet that it surprised people when a man like brother branham would come and he could stand in a prayer line and people would come up and he'd say now i don't know you i don't know who you are or anything about you and he said i'll be honest you can recognize i'm stalling because i'm just as helpless as helpless could be and then he'd turn right back around and say now this is your name and this is your address and this is your parent's name and this is what your doctor looks like and this is what he read on the chart that shouldn't surprise anybody when moses sat down and began to write the bible he looked back and he said esau was red and hairy and somebody said how did you know that moses you weren't there we didn't have any artifacts and and bibles and letters and things say post flood to know what it was like back there before noah how do you know what some of these things were that she wrote about about the first six days of creation you weren't there how do you know about noah and about his children and what their names were and how long it took him to build and how many days they went in before the door was shut he said i just saw it a moment ago amen because god allowed him to look back in time and write it oh brother banham said he went to a house one time and a man he was praying for a little baby and as they were headed there in the car brother bam said does your house look like this is the wallpaper like that and the chair like that he said brother branham was you ever there he said i was just there a minute ago amen the man didn't understand but he wasn't physically there but he was looking in a dimension that the world knows nothing about and the same god that could look back down through time and tell a prophet what your past was can look down through time in the future and know what your outcome will be oh my the same god that could tell moses write this about noah and write this about abraham and and how he sat in the tent door and elohim came down the same god could allow moses to sit there and write and moses went up to mount nebo and died there and moses hadn't even died yet but moses was writing it the same one that could look back and say sarah said this to abraham the same god could speak to him and say i'm going to raise up a prophet like unto you and so he could look forward in time and he could look backwards in time why because it wasn't the man it was the god that was using the man to anoint him to do that and that god knows the secrets of the hearts as we said earlier hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart i'm sure you've experienced that where maybe uh you know i had a a person tell me recently they they had a a friend there or a family member at church and and they were sitting there hearing me preach and a question popped into their mind and i don't even remember what the question was but they something just a question popped in their mind they were new to the message they didn't know really what we believed or what we taught they just happened to be in church that morning and i was preaching something and a question popped into their mind and they thought well what about this and i said now maybe you're thinking what about this and said whatever it was now i didn't know a bit more than anything what they were thinking but what was it the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart i don't get to take credit for that because i didn't know what they were thinking but he knew what they were thinking because the word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart maybe you're sitting here this morning and you have a need and you think oh my the title of this sermon and the direction brother nathan's gone he's probably not going to speak to that need well you just say god you get a hold of that man and you get him into a channel where he can speak and you'll be surprised what god can do and maybe i won't have a bit more idea about it than nothing unless you come up and tell me after service but that don't i don't have to know but he knows would see jesus 1959 give him your life if you want to give him glory i believe the brother read a scripture about that earlier in psalms about to give god glory give him your life if you want to give him glory come give yourself up to him surrender that the great holy spirit god's detective knows all about you oh my they sing it about santa claus but it wasn't true about santa but it is true about jesus he sees you when you're sleeping he knows when you're awake he knows if you've been bad or good so be good for goodness sake they tried to attribute that to santa santa don't know nothing about me but jesus does he knows when you're afraid and he knows when you're discouraged and he knows when you're depressed and he knows when you're sick and he knows when you're facing family problems and he knows when that loved one is backslid and he cares because you care he even cares about the little things i had a sister emailed me the other day and said she was trying to find something to she had some pipes that she was afraid to that were going to freeze up and she was trying to find some insulation and things to put around it and was sorting through things out in the garage and found a piece that was just the right size for that pipe and just the right length just a scrap piece seemed like in the shed but god knew her need now that might seem little to you but my you you get yourself in a time like that when you have a need and god gives you a custom piece fit just for what you need it might not be a pipe insulation might be a prayer cloth or might be a an answered prayer or might be something that you're facing and god just custom fits something specifically to you and you realize that he cares about the little things just as much as he cares about the big things he knows all about you we're looking at this thought of god's great detective now god is not just a private eye he's the all-seeing eye he sees into every detail of your life he sees your mistakes he sees your weaknesses you know the thing that that amazes me is that god could look down through time and as i start to get to it and we got way off on a channel here somewhere but romans chapter 8 in romans chapter 9 it begins to break into the thought of god's foreknowledge and how that he could predestinate by foreknowledge and paul takes them back to malachi chapter 1 there when it begins to talk about how that jacob have i loved and esau have i hated now jacob and esau had not even been formed when god begins to say this in his thinking that before they were even born before they were formed in the womb i decided i love jacob and i hate esau now god god did not we don't believe in random selection that god just went down he said any meanie mighty mo i'm going to pick this one to predestinate them i'm going to not save this one but god didn't just do random selection but god looked down through time and he knew the attribute he knew the predestinated seed in jacob and if you or i had been sitting there and seeing jacob and esau in church brother branham said you would have much preferred esau to have been a church member in your church my he took care of his daddy and he was a good man no doubt he paid tithes and he came and he worked hard and he was always trying to do something to help and and here's jacob a little scheister a little deceiver going about trying to get the birthright any way that he could but god looks down he says i loved this one and i hated that one it shows that god knew what their end was going to be and that he wasn't just looking at the moment you know satan will try to get you my i don't know maybe he doesn't you but he will me and i know he does he did paul and david and different ones down through history he will focus in on the very worst moment in your life the very worst mistake that you ever made and when you begin to talk to the devil he'll want to bring that up all the time and he'll want you to focus on that the very weakest moment no doubt paul would wake up in a cold sweat sometimes and and have nightmares of those men taking and stoning stephen and him saying here let me let me hold your coat for you so you can get a little bit bigger rock and no doubt david sometimes would sit up in bed in a cold sweat and think about sending uriah out there to the battlefield to hide his own sin and telling his men draw back from him and let those men come and kill him and no doubt those things would haunt those men and the devil would come and throw those things in their face but god was not focusing on their worst moment in fact god once it was under the blood god couldn't even remember their worst moment i find it so interesting that god knows my future but there's things in my past that he can't even remember amen that's a conundrum god remembers your future you don't remember your future but god does but he can't remember pieces of your past oh i don't know how many is here old enough to remember the the cassette recordings you know we've got some that are old enough to remember the reel-to-reel recordings but uh but you know before mp3s for some of you young people we had this thing called cassettes and you'd put them in the tape player and it was magnetic it would record and and you'd put the little cassette player in there and if you got the the tape from from voice of god there you'd come on and if they if they broke into the sermon a little late because the men hadn't put the tape on in time or because it had been a part one to part two and they'd lost part one somewhere along the way there was a man from jeffersonville by the name of tom cannell and brother tom would come on there and he'd say now the tape that you're about to hear is incomplete and every attempt has been made to find the missing portion of this tape and any assistance that you can give us would be appreciated i don't know about you but you know we won't be at the great white throne judgment because the bride's already judged but if there's anything that's played about me you know brother brandon said we'd have a screen that would come down and they'd play if there's anything played about my life brother david there'll have to be an angel or somebody that'll come on at the beginning of it see now the film that you're about to see is incomplete we searched all over we searched into the sea of forgetfulness and we've searched everywhere but there's portions of this tape that are missing it's an incomplete tape and god will say i don't even remember it satan the accuser will come up and he'll say now wait a minute brother so-and-so you know brother jay there was things that you did and he'll try to accuse you and he'll try to take it before the father and say father why don't you strike him dead don't you remember the things he did and god would say i don't know what you're talking about i can't remember what you're talking about and so many times satan beats us up about things that god can't even remember oh my i don't know about you i don't want to waste my time on something god can't remember god has a file on me he has a file on you but there are some things that have been redacted from that file he didn't just take a black marker and write over it where you could kind of squint and hold it up to light and try to see through it but he absolutely erased it brother bam said it's like clorox bleach that you take a bathtub full of clorox bleach and you take one little ink drop and drop it in there and he said you try to find where it's at it even goes back to the original chemicals to where it's not even ink anymore but it reverts it back to the original chemicals and brother branham said that satan when he comes and tries to get you to sin and then you go and you say father i didn't mean to do that and you place that in the blood of jesus he said then it goes back to the original chemicals and god takes your sin and places it back on the devil where it belongs oh praise the lord god's great detective knows all about it brother man said in questions and answers part 3 1964 god takes a picture of you he's got a picture of me in his file brother jackson oh my i'm glad he didn't take it you know in my current stage i believe my predestinated image has a few less pounds on it than i have right now he said god takes a picture of you and he goes down about a paragraph later and he says now this picture was not taken when you was 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world it was put in god's great file and then only thing it did was featured itself here for you to make your choice and god goes to his filing cabinet and gets out before there was ever a world created he goes into his family album and he gets out a folder and he opens it up and he looks and there's nathan bryant there's david mcgeary there's there's all these different brothers look here and the angel said i don't understand there's there's nobody that even looks like this there's not even a creature that looks like this he said i know but this is just a picture i took from my thinking it's one of my attributes and it's going to be in this age or it's going to be in that age i've got one of moses so i've got one of david and there wasn't even a david or a moses there i've got one my you know a polaroid picture you just have to take it you'd have to wait for it to develop and you just shake it and blow on it and everything like that and and you know it might take two or three minutes before it was fully developed but god out there millions of years ago in his thinking had a picture of you in his mind but it may have taken three million years from the time that he was thinking of you for you to develop here now we know it was longer than that because it was out in eternity just to give us some concept of time with it you know millions of years later then you come on the earth and you came not as a as a grown adult brother bam said men aren't born men they're born babies and so you came into this world as a little bitty baby but that wasn't the picture that god had of you and then you got to about your best physically at 21 23 somewhere in there 18 years old somewhere and and god saw you at your best but that still wasn't the picture that god took of you because you came through the fall and there were things in your life maybe physically maybe emotionally maybe spiritually there were scars and things that that was not exactly what he had but he was getting you into a condition to where he could bring you to that place that he already had in his thinking of you before the foundation of the world oh my he had a great filing cabinet this great detective did and he knew all about you he knew what your choices would be and i don't know about you but if we put all of my choices up here on the screen this morning there'd be some lousy ones that i'd be ashamed for you to look at that if we put all my decisions and all of my faults faults and every thought that i've had for the last 20 years up here there'd be some things that that would really make me ashamed and embarrassed but don't sit there and look at me like angels there'd be things that you wouldn't want up here either but the thing that that is surprising i guess as you know when we think of it intellectually the thing that's surprising to me is god knew all of those things and he still said jacob have i loved and esau have i hated jacob probably had a lot more things up there to show than esau did but he looked down through time and he saw a quality in jacob a predestinated seed that it didn't matter what he had to do he loved that birthright and he was going to get to that birthright why was it because believers just believe we've wasted a lot of time trying to convince beli trying to convince unbelievers to believe they'll never do it you can't make an unbeliever believe you might convince them to be a make-believer for a little while but you'll never make them a believer because there's nothing in there well how do you know who's who brother nathan well you don't you just keep sowing the words sowing the word but don't i don't i don't come and preach to unbelievers and i don't come and preach to make believers i come and preach to the bride and the bride will catch it and you know if the unbeliever wants to tag around the and the make-believer wants to tag around the word will eventually stake them off but the bride will catch the word and say this is what i've been looking for oh my chronicles chapter 17 and verse 16 david had a plan that he looked around he saw that god had allowed him to build a house of cedar to live in and he he saw all the great things that god had blessed him with and he had a desire in his heart to build a tabernacle for god that the ark of the covenant could sit in that the people could come and worship and he wanted to build a temple and he goes to nathan the prophet and he tells him this plan and this desire and and it says that nathan said go and do all that is in thine heart but you see there was a difference between nathan speaking and god speaking well amen we could just stop and preach that this morning it's the same thing this morning there's a difference in me speaking and god speaking there's a difference in a man getting up and sharing his opinion and there's a difference in god giving the word and showing that it backs up with the word and that it dovetails with the word there's a great difference so nathan tells him go and do all that's in that heart but that night nathan goes back to his house and he begins to pray and he gets to thus saith the lord for david and he comes back and he tells david look god told me to tell you that he drew you from the sheep coat and he's made you gave you a name liken to great men and like unto great names and and but you're a man of war and that you can't build this temple but that there's gonna be a son that is coming and this son god is actually gonna call him his son and this son that is coming he's going to build the temple and not only that but god is never this man's going to make mistakes now god didn't get into all this with david but i'm just giving you a little bit of insight here this man is going to make mistakes this man on a backslide this man is going to let some of his wives uh sway him from the true worship of god and get him into a backslidden condition but god's also going to allow him to write a big portion of the bible and god is also going to say in his word to david that he would never let his mercies leave solomon now solomon had not been born yet but god was showing david some of these things that were to be modern events made clear by prophecy we would call it today or things that are to be and god's giving him a glimpse into the future here and david in verse 16 of first chronicles 17 says david the king came and sat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is mine house that thou has brought me hither to and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes o god for thou has also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come in other words you're not just telling me what the morning newspaper says about yesterday's events but you're revealing what's going to happen for a great while to come that you're revealing what it's going to be for my family in the future and has regarded me according to this state of a man of high degree o lord what a what a thing it was for david to recognize that god did not just know about his past but god knew about his future you realize what an assurance that should give to us as believers we don't know what tomorrow holds but we certainly know who holds tomorrow and god when you know when they came out and said that coronavirus had hit our country god did not wring his hands he wasn't shocked he you know he wasn't shocked off the throne he wasn't devastated uh he he didn't have to come up with a new plan and a new atonement oh my well uh the blood of jesus isn't strong enough for coronavirus so we're going to have to come up with a with a new a vaccine or something to to try to be able to heal this you know what same god that can heal cancer can heal coronavirus oh man i know that's not popular but you know the blood of jesus cleanses men from all sins and if it cleans men from all sins he said also i'm the lord that healeth all thy diseases a double l they haven't come up with a new one ebola or aids or anything they haven't come up with any new virus that doesn't fit into the category of all i'm the lord that healeth all thy diseases oh my why should i be discouraged the song said his eye is on the sparrow and he watches over me he's watching over me brother david he knows what my end will be he knows what my outcome will be he knows his thoughts of me his thoughts are higher than my thoughts he can figure out things way in advance further than i can and all of our efforts and all of our good works and everything that we're doing if we don't just give it into the hands of god and say god you take control you'll be headed in the wrong direction because he looks and he sees he doesn't just see tomorrow he sees 10 years from now and sometimes we go through things and in the present moment it seems like a trial and it seems like just a terrible situation and we think god how can romans 8 28 be true in the face of this i want to say this morning romans 8 28 is true in the face of any circumstance in the face of it you say oh brother nathan you just don't know what i'm going through no i do not but jesus did before he ever placed it in paul's heart to write those words all things work together for good i like that when when the scripture says that word all it just encompasses everything and everybody he didn't just say they work good all things work together for good for the prophet all things work together for good for the pastors but all things work together for good to them that love the lord and are called according to his purpose that means i get to write my name right in there and say it may not look good but it's working for my good because god sees way down to the end of the line and he knows what we have need of to get us into a condition for whatever lies ahead david when the lion and the bear came it didn't look good it didn't look good for david here i've got to go out and none of the other shepherds have troubles that i have here i never hear any any uh wolf killing or line killing or bear killing stories from them they never have any problems with their flocks but here every time i turn around there's a lion or a bear and i got to get out my old slingshot again seemed like a trial seemed like a problem but god was preparing him because he knew there was a giant coming down the road and he had to build this man's faith and train him on the back side of the desert to a fake a spot where when he faced saul he said don't let any man's heart fail him for fear a lion and a bear came in and tried to take my sheep and god rose me up and anointed me and i slew him and the same god that would do that can defeat some circumcised philistine amen maybe you've got giants in your life this morning that you're facing you don't see any way over it around it or under it it seems like an impossible situation but let's go back in our memory a little bit and remember last year that impossible situation that we couldn't figure out any way around or over under that god brought us through and remember five years ago when he was sick and the doctor gave you up and you didn't think there was any way around it and god brought you through and i remember ten years ago when he wasn't even serving the lord and your family had gave up on you and the church had gave up on you and everybody in the message that gave up on you and then god got a hold of that predestinated seed and began to work on you and it looked impossible to everybody else that you'd ever serve the lord but god did it well that same god that did all that back there if he could bring you through the lion and he could bring you through the bear he can bring you through whatever giant you're facing this morning same god amen just as mighty this morning as he ever was still hebrews 13 8 he hasn't got any weaker the blood of jesus christ doesn't have an expiration date it doesn't get weaker with age oh my same jesus this morning that brought you through the last time can bring you through this time david recognizes this and he says in psalms 139 verse 1 oh lord thou hast searched me and known me this is again this hebrew word that means investigated lord thou hast searched me and known me thou knowest my down sitting and mine uprising now understand it's my thought of far off in other words before i even think it you know about it you understand what my thoughts are going to be before i even have them thou understand it's my thought afar off thou compasses my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways oh my for there is no word in my tongue but lo o lord thou knowest it all together he knows when you're gossiping he knows when you're on social media running somebody down he knows when you're talking about the word he knows when you're talking about whatever it is that you're you're focusing your time on there's not a word that comes out of your mouth that he doesn't know about there's not a thought that goes through your mind that he doesn't know about and not only that he knew what it was going to be before there was ever an earth for you to be on thou has beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me now you remember when the hebrew children were coming out of egypt and they got up there against the red sea and they were being led by a pillar of fire at night and by a cloud by day and they come up against the red sea and now pharaoh's army is behind them and there's mountains on either side of them and there's no way of escape it looks like but moses stands there and he says stand still and see the salvation of the lord now we get worked up when we get in a situation like this and we wring our hands and we begin to worry and we begin to fret but moses told them just stand still and see the salvation of the lord if there's any advice i could give you this morning whatever battle that you're facing stand still and see the salvation of the lord he's great in battle he's mighty the bible said he's a man of war he's a mighty in battle and so they got up against the red sea and there's no way for them to go but then here comes around it becomes a cloud to the egyptians and a pillar of fire you know we said we had that in our age too there was a cloud and a pillar of fire that was following a vindicated message and i know that they make fun of it today but well i just happen to believe it i'm thankful for churches that aren't ashamed still to have pictures like that up in them i know there's a lot of churches taking them down but i don't preach at those churches anymore because god didn't call me to preach to unbelievers amen when they take them down i want to write them and say hey send them to me i'll put some more up i said that'll offend somebody well if it offends them they need to be offended somebody said you mean you'd have a picture of a man in your church oh you just didn't look high enough you just didn't look high enough that was the problem with the pentecostals they didn't look high enough they were looking at the man but we looked a little higher and saw what was hanging above the man amen somebody said you mean you follow a man yes i do if i'd been a noah's day i would have followed a man right up the plank into the boat if i was in moses's day i would have followed a man right out of egypt because it wasn't the flesh of the man that i was following it was what he was following is what i was following [Applause] and he was before them and behind them and it became the very word that god sent became darkness to the egyptian brotherhood said it always blinds the eyes of one and opens the eyes of the other and it becomes a it becomes a message of deliverance to one and it becomes a message of judgment to those that were rejected and here it blinded the egyptians behind them and shown a path for the israelites to see to cross over on dry land and we put that back as a little you know a little bible story that we tell in sunday school we read the kitties before bed but this same god david said was before him and behind him we're compassed about with a great army of witnesses this morning we're compassed about to where if we could look like god allowed gehaza elisha stood there one day and hazel wrote his head he said oh we're surrounded oh my there's riots on this side and there's coronavirus on this side and there's political trouble on that side and there's message politics on this side and we're surrounded elijah said oh god just open up that open up that spiritual image to a young man's eyes and let him look around and see and he recognized he was surrounded but it was a great host of god's army that had surrounded them and there was more with them than there was with him because god said the angels of god and camp around those that fear him i'm surrounded all right but in a good way in fact my enemies are surrounded by what's surrounding me oh my thou has beset behind me and before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful me for me it is high i cannot attain unto it whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence if i ascend into heaven that are there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there jonah found this out one time he was running from god and he ran to tarshish and god was there he ran from joppa and god was there he ran into the boat and god was there he went into the belly of the boat and god was there he went to the ocean and god was there and then the fish swallowed him and went to the bottom of the ocean and god was there he said if i hide underneath the rocks underneath the mountains where would i go where you're not at god maybe there's some jonas this morning but my god has got you right where he wants you jonah thought he was running from god but god had jonah right where he wanted him to where when he came up out of that fish and god would give him some time to sit down there oh some people say all this message that you follow it's unscientific they apparently have not read this book they say the message is unscientific you go back to the story of jonah and the story of the three hebrew children i don't know of anything more in scientific than those two stories but i believe it with everything that's within me amen explain to me by science how fish swallowed jonah he went to the bottom of the ocean for three days and three nights with no oxygen tent with nothing down there and god protected him some degree weathers down there you think texas is called this morning it was colder in the bottom of the whale's belly down there and god protected him and brought him up and he walks off the gangplank to a group of people that worship dagan the fish god and they said oh goodness this man must be a prophet god knows what he's doing somebody said i can't i can't believe this message i i don't have enough scientific evidence we have more scientific evidence in this age than any other age if they couldn't believe in this age there's no way they could believe in moses's age we have a picture of the pillar of fire but moses just came out and said i saw a bush burning and it didn't consume and god spoke to me out did you get a recording of his voice moses no did you get a picture of the of the of the pillar of fire did you get a sample of it no you're just going to have to take my word for it well if you want to deliver it enough you'd take a vindicated prophet of god's word for it if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth is the day the darkness and the light are alike to thee and he goes down in verse 23 and he says search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting my let me break into this age for a little bit and read you a few quotes of what god did this great detective the holy spirit what he did in this age the unchangeable god working in an unexpectable way 1962. he says the holy spirit can go back down through your life and tell you what you was and you know whether that's true or not well if you know and know that's the truth then surely you could believe what he tells you will come to pass this is what was taking place god was getting a man and a channel where he could take him down one dimension and look back into the past and then he could take him and show him forward what was going to be he could take and look back and say now i see you in a little checkered dress as a little girl and you run up on a porch because you're being chased by a yellow dog and because of that you've been nervous your whole life and he said but i see i see it get light around you well if he could tell him what had happened way back there that maybe they'd even forgot about and said oh goodness i forgot all about that brother branham but he could look way back in their subconscious and see that down through time and then he could tell him what they were going to be well if this man can tell me remember the woman at the well she dropped her water pot and ran in the city and said behold a man who's told me all the things that i've done the true easter seal 1961 i never seen you in my life you're a stranger to me i know nothing about you god does know you and if he can reveal to me by his holy spirit the resurrected christ who come here and give me listen to this a temporarily resurrection by my spirit that my spirit goes away now and his spirit comes in then to let you know whether he's alive or not now i don't know you that's me and my spirit we don't know you but he knows you but he wants to borrow my body to prove that he's the resurrected christ he said i'm so happy to loan it to him give it to him anything he can get out of it he says in anointed ones at the end time he said i think the where where the people can't get it separated they still can't get it separated brother david he said they can't realize that the angel of the seventh angel is not the son of man he said i wasn't the one that spoke down there on the river i was only standing near when he spoke i'm not the one that says these things i'm only the one that's standing near they can't get it separated i sat with the brother at a picnic table a few years ago and he wanted to tell me that brother branham was the son of man i said well if he was physically the man the flesh of him was i said he said he was the same in every way except the physical body i said that's right except the physical body it was the ministry was the same not the man i said if the man was the same then we need to bow down like abraham didn't call him elohim but it wasn't the man but it was the ministry to where he could stand there as helpless as helpless could be said i don't know you i don't know anything about you and then turn around and say i take every spirit under my control i said now if he was if it was him if it was the man that was jesus then he would remember what he said because it was the same personality but a separate personality came in and took over to where he said now now is what he told you the truth well if he was the if he was the physical man was it then why didn't he remember but he said god allows me a temporary resurrection that my spirit goes somewhere else so that his spirit can step into this vessel and he can speak and say this is what your doctor said this is what was on your chart this was and then he would come back and say now i don't know what he said i'll have to go back and listen to the tape but was what he told you the truth and even his greatest critics it was never wrong one time why because it wasn't a man it was god in the man people want to worship brother branham i don't worship brother branham but i certainly worship the god that was in him amen don't get scared this morning that same god's on the inside of me brother bannon questions and answers who did jesus pray to in the garden of gethsemane the same one that we pray to the holy ghost on the inside of him amen we pray sometimes like like we're a lutheran or something oh we're going to pray to god a million miles away on a cloud somewhere you missed it somewhere he's not a million miles away on a cloud he's as close to you as your own right arm [Applause] that's what the day of pentecost was all about god coming back and veiling himself and human beings again so that he could speak through you and work through you and live through you amen we've got a lot of wonderful scriptures the atheist has the same king james bible king james bible that i have atheists around the world have it on their shelf and it's doing them no good we have a lot of wonderful quotes and there's people that have walked away and made fun of it that have the exact same books from 47 to 65 that i do on their shelves and on their cell phones and on their tablets and they search it and study it sometimes more than we do because they're trying to find fault and trying to criticize it but it won't do them any good it won't the word won't do the atheist any good but when we take the word for it's not for well i think it meant that and so and so said it meant this and i don't know i believe this part but i struggle with that part but when you take the word and allow it to live through you brother banham said oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices he said that's the thunder that'll shake the devil amen satan doesn't care you can quote the devil and he won't care very much but when he sees a life that's lived that backs up the word that's when the devil trembles my sir as we would see jesus 1961 just a gift sir he tells this man the prayer line just a gift sir trying to relax myself and catch your spirit as odd as it might seem i've seen them lay people laying dead finland three or four different places i've seen in my life and god would let my spirit so leave me till i'd go out into the land and catch that spirit and bring it right back again to that person it's true god in heaven knows it's true you want a scripture for that so that you don't think well brother bam just said that luke chapter 20 verse 37 now that the dead are raised even moses showed at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him you say all my sister so and so she died three years ago and we went down here and buried her in this texas dirt down here she's more alive than you are if she's if she was a believer amen believers don't die they're in a faster dimension than we are more more alive than we are and we say oh poor sister so-and-so i say poor us we're still here facing sickness and fears and troubles and things but they stepped into a body where there's no sickness there's no pain god is not the god of the dead but the god of the living my let me read you this i'm trying to close but i'm having a hard time doing it the water of separation 1955 when you go home tonight you christians respectable people that are that's here sitting a bunch of big drunks and things and moved in taking over your house say well what about this looky here they say this is a house isn't it he says you get home today and you look around there's a bunch of drunks of coming and taking over your house they said this is a house isn't it yes well it's made for human beings isn't it yes well i'm a human being i have a right to be here but you don't have a right to be here we don't believe in that kind of carrying on well he said i'm not going to get out there's a law down here that says he will get out as long as you can prove it's your house is that right satan said now i'm gonna take you prematurely i'm gonna do this no you're not we got a title to this property of ours that's right and we got a an attorney sitting in glory amen with the blood sacrifice of his own life not only that but we got an fbi agent he says amen again the holy spirit god's great detective just leave the blood there and serve that warrant on him watch the holy ghost put him out want to say this morning it's time that we serve the devil his eviction notice hey jesus came and got the title deed and redeemed back brother branham said everything that adam lost he came and redeemed back and we live so low below our privileges all one day we're going to do this and one day we're going to do that by well he jesus already came and redeemed it all back why don't you stand up and take what god has given you claim your god-given rights but we're afraid oh well i don't know if it's for me and i don't know if it's for this day and i don't oh my stand and claim your privileges we live so far below our privileges sometimes and god's great detective has taken it all the way back to the title deed and found out hey this thing didn't belong to the devil it belonged to jesus christ and we're heirs with him joint heirs with the king and he comes and he says devil you don't have no right to stay here any longer and kicked him out of his own house and took the keys to the devil's own house it's time to serve eviction notice on the devil but we baby him and pet him and all my well poor sister so and so you know she's got this spirit on her well that that you know you need to pray for her but don't baby that spirit don't entertain that spirit or it might come on you but give the devil his eviction notice and say you aren't welcome in my home anymore you're not welcome to take over my thoughts anymore and get me to dwell on things of doubt and unbelief and fear you're not welcome around my family anymore i'm applying the token to him i'm serving this eviction notice on the devil now this word eviction notice if you look it up on google it says an eviction notice is how a landlord gives notice to a tenant to vacate a certain property the problem is we've let him we've let him come and and set up shop and just kind of uh you know squatters rights just come in and well he's been you know the tv and those those filthy videos have been here so long we'll just we'll just let it go and the you know the internet we don't have it filtered where our kids can go on and see any kind of filth they want and he's just been here so long you know possession is nine tenths of the law it's not his house kick him out of your house serve an eviction notice on him in time the landlord is here and gives notice that this is not your property but we've dedicated this property to him and we're here to tell you you have to leave satan the inside man 1953 and now satan brother branham says you who've bound her and trying to take her to the grave yet aged but our god doesn't look at age oh somebody said hallelujah god doesn't look at age and i come to a servant i come to serve a warrant on you as a representative of calvary as god's agent and you cannot stay in this house any longer you have to move out because as the holy spirit the detective of god who's here and your secret places are revealed and you can't hide any longer you know the devil hates to be exposed i've seen it in prayer lines you know we read it sometimes in quotes but as the scripture said i have heard but now i see i've seen it in prayer lines satan get exposed and he absolutely hates it sometimes he'll throw a screaming fit about it but you know what there's something about the devil when you expose him he is powerless a lot of the problem is satan has convinced us that all my you better not you better not ask for prayer for that or you better not confess that to your spouse or you better not do this or do that you better not tell your parents about that why because he likes that control that he has over you but you expose him one time brother bam said you he said samson went down there and he said that lion that had been trying to kill him he just grabbed it and ripped it apart and he said he went by a few days later and he said there was sweet honey in there and he said you overcome a temptation that you've been struggling with he said just overcome that a few times and see how much sweeter it gets and how much easier it gets but the devil says oh you could never you could never get victory over that well he doesn't want you to think that of course but he he's just uh he's just a tenant that has moved in but the landlord has come to serve him his eviction notice and said satan you're not welcome in my bride any longer you're not welcome to torment her any longer you know a lot of times we get sick and we just take it for granted well i guess this is just my this this is just uh my cross to bear well the scripture said that he wanted to see us prosper in health even as our soul prospers so i don't believe it's god's will for you to be sick but we feel sorry for the devil sometimes i think i don't feel sorry for him i like kicking him in the teeth oh my god's good isn't he he sent a great detective that went searching for you he searched down through your life he searched down through your family back in your great great grandfather's you think of all the wars and famines and pestilence and plagues that spin down through the years and god protected your lineage to bring you down maybe you had a great grandfather in world war one and a grandfather in world war ii and a father in vietnam and and god protected those men were maybe thousands of men falling to the left and the right but god knew you had to be here this morning and he knew there was a predestinated seed that he was going to bring forth on the earth and then we get here and the devil says oh you'll never make it god protected me before i was even here brother rahm said if he could do all that and bring you to where you're at if he could bring your parents together through all those different lines and bring you here without you having any choice in it what can he do for you now that you have a choice in it amen let's bow our heads together lord jesus we thank you that you searched down through time and space and eternity and you saw that there'd be a bride in this age lord we look around we see the challenge of the hour and it seems almost impossible sometimes that there would be a bride in this age without spot or wrinkle but we know that it will be because your word promised it and we have confidence because we've seen your word come to pass so many times lord and lord we're resting in you this morning we thank you that you searched down and you saw us you saw our weaknesses you saw our faults you saw our failures and yet you loved us enough to choose us anyhow god it's beyond anything i deserve it's beyond anything i could earn or or work my way into but as brother david saying this morning it was just amazing grace how sweet the sound lord maybe there's some sitting here this morning in the service or maybe they're listening lord at their homes here in texas or back in indiana at my own home church there lord they couldn't get out because of the weather today and and couldn't make it to church because of the icy parking lot and maybe some here that lived great distances and knowing that another storm is coming in and not knowing what the roads would be like and they're they're sitting there in their home lord but wherever they're at lord i pray that your holy spirit would would shake their conscience enough to make them recognize that god cares for him and that he chose them and elected and predestinated them before they had any choice in it and then the devil comes along and tries to get us to give up because we're not good enough or because we made a mistake or because we we were discouraged about something or somebody said something and hurt our feelings oh god help us this morning to recognize that your great detective is still on the case and that you know the thoughts of the heart that you discern the intents and lord that you would send a man by lord not just this weekend or myself being here but lord you place it on brother david's heart and the different local minister brothers you play certain things at certain times on their hearts and then you lead different guest ministers by their way and and say certain things at certain times for the need that the person would have at that moment or at that specific date and time and things that are laid in the word for years and years and even back in the scriptures thousands of years some of these things have have been written on pages and yet a man pick that up because it's the eternal word and get into a channel where you can make it so personal to somebody that's sitting here something that moses wrote maybe 4 000 years ago god we know that it takes you to do that but lord may it bring encouragement to them this morning to recognize that you care about them and that you know their circumstances and lord even if they feel like they can't go on that lord that's the time when you pick us up and you do the caring lord that's the time when we depend on you and i pray that you bring encouragement and peace to every home lord take away any fear or doubt or anxiety take away any oppression or depression lord that would try to torment them in the spiritual realm father i pray that you just move on the scene and encourage hearts and build their faith father i pray and strengthen them for the journey that they're facing lord each one of us lord we're we're on slightly different paths lord different families and different characteristic traits and different jobs and different walks of life and maybe different personalities but lord you're guiding us all if we're a predestinated seed of god to one final destination i pray that you'd be with each one whatever level of their journey they're at maybe they're a new believer that's on fire for god or maybe they're they're a prodigal son that's trying to come back but has ran so far that the devil's telling him that there's no hope for him lord may you let him know this morning that there's still hope for him if they love jesus that there's still hope for him lord and father if there's any that maybe they've just been stagnant for so long that they long to see god moving in their life the way that he once did father may you just ignite something in them may you do a supernatural work that they begin to see you everywhere they look father like the man that brother branham talked about said all i've seen is god for the last 40 years god opened up our eyes to look and see father you're a present tense god lord your present tense for our needs the present help in time of trouble lord if there ever was a time of trouble we recognize us now but lord we're serving a present tense god that's here for those needs lord we just commit this service to you father may it be a blessing and an encouragement to someone i pray protect us on the roads bring us back safely tonight we pray lord and we just give it all to you father because it takes you lord some planet and and some watered and but lord it's you that gives the increase so we pray father that you just quicken lord the words that went forth this morning and sink it into hearts we pray in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen you love him this morning amen musicians if you'd come amen let's sing this this morning i believe it's fitting [Music] oh when pangs of death seized or my soul unto the lord i cried o till my jesus came and made i would not [Applause] [Music] why don't we stand and sing it this morning well till my jesus came and he made me hope i would not be denied [Applause] oh like jacob is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] till my jesus came and made me whole i would not be denied well old satan said my lord was gone and he would not hear [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the lord church the works already done and christ my lord he is here [Music] [Applause] [Music] listen to this part this morning well old satan says that this message is wrong and there's mistakes oh here and there oh but praise the lord vindication has been done christ the mystery of god is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everyday [Applause] amen amen amen you know i'm a great believer in giving opportunity you know something the brother said this morning really touched my heart and it was about god knowing your future you know i like that because you know we always know about going back but know your future and and you know uh one of the greatest things i always want for people is for them to have a deliverance and we need deliverance amen you know we have salvation but through life's journey we have things that come our way we have an adversary that tries to cling onto our lives we we have circumstances that arise and and and we need deliverance and i've i've i pray for so many people as brother nathan has also and they come up and they say i want delivered from this i want delivered from this deliver me from this please pray for my deliverance but when that brother spoke what he spoke this morning my heart went to that place and i thought you know of all the people a lot of people come up and they pray for deliverance but they don't cast their problem into his hands and let him provide the deliverance in the future that he knows right you know it's like i want to take this problem brother mcgary and today i want to stick it in the microwave and i want to get an instant deliverance but they've never put the problem into his hands now i believe abraham put the problem of having a child into god's hands [Music] it didn't matter it took a while but they knew in your heart who's got the problem so if you've given it to him then you know he's got it and he knows the future and he knows how to work it out and he knows how to bring it to pass and he knows what he wants to accomplish and you to learn from your deliverance but it's it's never placing it into his hands when you come up to get a deliverance or or something he already knows that he has knows what you have need of even before you ask but the scripture says cast your cares upon him now i i don't know this morning [Music] if there's a deliverance that you want and and i don't mean a need i mean that you want something that you know is holding you back and you want to put that in to his hands i'm not talking about i want to deliver in chess we know but would you be willing to cast that burden and cast that care and and give it to him lord i've got this i'm like this and i'm going to commit this into your hands and know in your heart he's got it now and he knows the future he knows what he wants you to be and you'll let him do that [Music] so it doesn't do you no good say i want deliverance deliver me if you don't turn it in his heart and i didn't want this moment to pass this morning after these great words of encouragement the words of discern are the thoughts and intents of the heart the holy spirit puts you under conviction and and you know that you're not right and you want to be right but what i'm talking about is saying lord you know i want to be right now i'm putting that into your hands to bring the path now is there something this morning if there's something that you would like to place in the lord's hands so you don't have to come up and say this is my sin brother nathan i've got this i've got this problem and i've got that problem and and it and i i need this know that you'll come up and say brothers i'm standing here today and i want you to pray with me because i'm putting this into his hands and he'll do it in its time and it's season but i'm i'm placing that care into his hands i i wish i had the vocabulary and the words to express to you what i'm trying to say the difference between the deliverance which is the result and the beginning which is putting it into his hands it's like taking a seed you cast that seed into the ground and you place it there and then you let god do his work and you reap the fruit but you can walk away the prophet of god said and you can look at that field and you can say i planted my corn look at my field of corn because you've cast it and you've sowed it and then you know what it's going to bring forward and we try to bypass many times the placing it into his hands [Music] so there may be nobody here this morning that can come prepared if you're at home and and you're watching and there's just a heaviness in your heart for something and you just like to place it into his hands this morning i don't even know what how you're going to do it lord i don't care i know you know i know i know but i'm placing it into your hands this morning if you if you could if you feel that help you and you'd like to cast it into his hands this morning and you'd like to come up to prayer you can come up for prayer if you would anyone that feels that way maybe one of the deacons could come and help line the people up and we just want to pray [Music] [Music] because [Music] all fear is gone because i know yes i [Music] is [Music] he is to love [Music] he landed [Music] an empty grave is here because it is our fear is gone because i know [Music] is [Music] across the river [Music] and [Music] [Applause] i know he reigns because he lives i can face it is gone because i know yes i know he holds my future and life is worth the living just because it [Music] [Music] become [Music] [Music] is he holds my future and life is worth the living because it is [Music] all the way i'm going all the way [Music] is [Music] you give your life for me on calvary i want to do my best for you today [Music] i'm going all the way and as [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] that i am going all the way [Music] rest
