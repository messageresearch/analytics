[30:02] SE Frank now
[30:06] SE uh appears 74 times in the Bible and
[30:13] uh Scholars have wondered what it means
[30:17] but the most of the uh spiritual schol
[30:20] scholars believe it means pause to
[30:25] praise and lift
[30:26] up pause to praise and lift up and uh it
[30:32] it also it refers to uh pause and
[30:37] reflect and it's a derivative from the
[30:40] word that means
[30:42] forever amen so praise and lift up the
[30:46] Lord forever reflect upon the Lord
[30:51] forever and I'd like to read the first
[30:54] Psalm where say law appears the first
[30:56] time in the Bible
[30:58] and it's Psalm 3 and Psalm 3 reads as
[31:02] follows

[31:07] me many are they that rise up against
[31:12] me many there be which say of my soul
[31:18] there is no help for him in God say
[31:23] la but thou oh Lord art a shield
[31:28] for

[31:51] the Lord substained me I will not be
[31:54] afraid of 10,000 of people
[31:58] that have set themselves against me
[32:01] round about arise O Lord save me my God
[32:07] for thou haast smitten all my enemies
[32:10] upon the cheekbone thou haast broken the
[32:13] teeth of the ungodly salvation belongeth

[34:39] all the time it's always nice to have
[34:42] brother Paul Minister for us I believe
[34:45] we're getting close to him preaching for
[34:47] us in English amen so um I'm longing for
[34:52] the day that every word that he says
[34:54] that he knows in English he says that
[34:57] and then we'll add the French where he
[34:59] can't complete it so we got a great
[35:01] challenge for you for one day for you to
[35:05] preach 100% English so you can preach
[35:09] 5050
[35:12] now but we know it's possible but what I
[35:16] always love about the word of God when
[35:18] we have a brother uh minister in another
[35:22] language as you find out it's the same
[35:24] God the language doesn't change God and
[35:27] the message didn't change because the
[35:31] message wasn't given by language and the
[35:34] message wasn't given by print the
[35:37] message was given by divine
[35:40] revelation amen wherever God's seed was
[35:44] when the word was spoken the spirit of
[35:46] God came and revealed to that believer
[35:49] and that's why we have the same
[35:51] Revelation all across the world from
[35:54] many many different languages it only
[35:57] proves that there's one living God and
[35:59] the revelation of God's word is true and
[36:03] the goal of every Believers that's heard
[36:06] this message is to set their life aside
[36:09] that they might inherit the great prize
[36:12] of eternal life so we're so grateful for

[37:44] out but that the word may become life in
[37:48] us that it may transform

[38:07] hands father you know how much he helps
[38:13] me to try to translate these few
[38:17] words that your people may get
[38:21] it this thought that this little thought
[38:23] that's in
[38:25] me don't forget your
[38:28] servant Brother
[38:32] David that he has he gave this request
[38:35] for
[38:37] Tuesday father be with
[38:40] [Music]
[38:41] him you know how much he needs his
[38:45] vision to serve you
[38:47] Lord you know his
[38:50] devotion bless him or Beyond his uh his
[38:56] expectation and as we open your
[39:00] word come and bring it to us
[39:03] yourself in the name of Jesus Christ
[39:07] amen
[39:12] amen I believe this morning it was a
[39:14] great
[39:19] blessing for me I wanted Brother David
[39:21] to continue talking
[39:28] [Music]
[39:32] because it's really the thing that God
[39:34] has to help us uh uh
[39:37] possess the true
[39:42] love last
[39:46] Tuesday I was speaking with my
[39:51] wife I shter portion of the scripture
[39:54] about
[39:55] Bram uh in question and answer of
[40:01] 57
[40:06] says someone can hate
[40:11] you and he can prove to you that he
[40:14] really hates
[40:16] you but if inside deep inside your
[40:21] heart you love him
[40:25] regardless you are very close close to
[40:27] the
[40:29] kingdom and that's
[40:34] true so when Brother David was speaking
[40:37] this morning that came back to
[40:40] me I said may may the Lord help us
[40:44] [Music]
[40:47] really many times we stay around
[40:50] superficial
[40:54] things we we we we give our time or
[40:58] importance to things that that are
[41:00] really not
[41:05] important where there are things that
[41:07] God really wants to take us
[41:15] to I I always believe that this
[41:21] message has no Doctrine message is
[41:25] simple the message is simple
[41:28] as brother Bram brought
[41:32] it maybe I'm the
[41:36] [Music]
[41:37] problem I maybe I don't have the
[41:40] capacity to read between the
[41:44] lines or to translate what brother bam
[41:47] wanted to
[41:49] say and all I know to
[41:52] do is to to say what he said
[41:58] and if what he said can help
[42:03] somebody is the the goal or the motive
[42:06] for which we are serving
[42:09] him because one thing that's for
[42:14] sure that every word of man will be
[42:17] recognized as a
[42:21] lie and lies can only take you to death
[42:28] the word of God will be recognized to be
[42:30] the
[42:33] truth let's take our
[42:37] Bibles uh in the Book of Daniel chapter
[42:45] 9 thank
[42:47] you
[42:49] Daniel Daniel chapter
[42:53] 9 we're going to read the first five
[42:56] chapters
[43:00] sorry the the the verse 1 through five
[43:03] and then we'll go to verse 19
[43:14] 23 in the first year of Darius the son
[43:17] of asares and the seed of mides which
[43:21] was made King over the ram of calans
[43:26] [Music]
[43:40] in the first years of the reign of
[43:43] D of his Reign I Daniel understood by
[43:46] the book the number of years whereof the
[43:49] word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the
[43:51] prophet that he would accomplish 70
[43:55] years in the desolation of
[44:13] Jerusalem I set my face unto the unto
[44:16] the Lord God to seek by prayer and
[44:19] supplications by fasting and sackcloth
[44:22] and Ashes
[44:39] and I prayed unto the Lord my God and
[44:41] made my confession and said oh Lord the
[44:44] great and Dreadful God keeping keeping
[44:48] the the Covenant of Mercy to them that
[44:51] love him and to them that keep his
[44:53] commandment

[45:04] we have sined we have committed iniquity
[45:07] and we have done Wicked and have
[45:09] rebelled every every even by The Parting
[45:14] from all thy precept and from thy
[45:17] judgment so he continu to
[45:20] pray and we're going to go to verse
[45:23] 19 at the end of his prayer
[45:43] amen he said oh Lord hear oh Lord
[45:47] forgive oh Lord hearken and do def
[45:52] differ not for thine own sake oh my God
[45:57] for the thy City and thy people are
[46:00] called by thy
[46:13] name and while and while I was speaking
[46:17] and praying and confessing my sin and
[46:20] the sin of My People Israel and
[46:23] presenting my supplication before the
[46:25] Lord my God for the holy uh for the Holy
[46:29] Mountain of my
[46:42] God yeah while I was speaking in prayer
[46:46] even the man Gabriel whom I have seen in
[46:48] a vision at the beginning at the
[46:51] beginning being caused to fly swiftly
[46:54] touched me about that time of the
[46:58] evening uh
[47:08] oblation and he informed me and talked
[47:11] to me and said oh Daniel I am come forth
[47:14] to give thee skill and understanding
[47:29] amen and at the beginning at the
[47:32] beginning of th
[47:34] supplication the Commandment came forth
[47:37] and I am come to show thee for thou are
[47:40] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[47:43] matter and consider the
[47:47] vision may the Lord add the blessing to
[47:49] the reading of his word you may have
[47:51] your
[47:55] seats from this scripture
[48:00] the Lord had put this little inspiration
[48:02] on my
[48:06] heart and that I'm going to call
[48:09] Discerning a discernment of time and our
[48:15] attitude Discerning discernment of time
[48:18] and our
[48:22] attitude we go towards the story of
[48:24] Daniel
[48:29] that we know how the story of Daniel in
[48:32] Babylon
[48:34] began when the King
[48:38] Nebuchadnezzar Jem he came and he
[48:40] besieged
[48:43] Jerusalem and in besieging
[48:48] Jerusalem and he ordained to the uh
[48:52] Chiefs of the
[48:55] unic to take some the children of
[48:58] Israel to
[49:02] Babylon and this young man that was to
[49:05] be taken to
[49:09] Babylon the king gave a characteristics
[49:12] of what these kids have to
[49:17] be and he said they have to be of the
[49:20] Royal
[49:22] Kingdom or the noble families
[49:30] in other words it was a a group of kids
[49:33] that had a special seed about
[49:38] them it was a certain kids that had a
[49:41] certain predisposition about
[49:47] them those are the ones that the king of
[49:50] Babylon decided to take from from Israel
[49:52] back to
[49:55] Babylon and scripture speaks that among
[49:58] those children Daniel Daniel was one of
[50:01] them an there was an
[50:04] anah there's
[50:07] Messiah and there was
[50:10] aaria and then when they got to
[50:14] Babylon they gave him other
[50:17] names and then to Daniel they call him
[50:21] Bel and to Ania they called mishak No
[50:26] Shadrach
[50:28] Shadrach M they call him
[50:33] M and then aaria they call him
[50:37] Abednego and we know many times when we
[50:41] speak about this young
[50:43] man Daniel will keep his name as
[50:48] Daniel but the others we speak about
[50:51] Shadrach M and
[50:55] Abednego and when these children went to
[51:03] Babylon they were brought uh away from
[51:06] the the habitat from where they came
[51:10] from away from the
[51:13] families away from the
[51:17] religion away from the
[51:21] church when they were just young
[51:23] children
[51:27] and this young man this young kids when
[51:29] they got to
[51:34] Babylon the Babylonian wanted according
[51:37] to the instructions of the
[51:41] king to to instruct them and to educate
[51:45] them according to their
[51:47] religion according to the ways of doing
[51:50] according to their
[51:53] habits but this four young men
[51:57] from their coming into the
[52:00] land they they they gave to them a
[52:06] proposition to eat the same food as the
[52:11] king to drink the same wine as the
[52:17] king to to to others this would have
[52:20] been a
[52:23] privilege by many ways the parents were
[52:25] not there
[52:27] the pastor was not there there was no
[52:30] the other brothers were not
[52:34] there and it seems like all our lives
[52:36] we're going to spend it
[52:39] here if they we do what they asking of
[52:42] us who's going to come and reproach
[52:49] us it's our new uh place of
[52:53] living en it's it's our environment
[52:58] they gave them a
[53:01] proposition this young
[53:04] man they didn't accept the
[53:07] [Applause]
[53:09] proposition because in
[53:12] them there was a
[53:17] seed they had a predisposition into
[53:20] their
[53:24] heart that they didn't come to church
[53:26] because the dad came to
[53:30] church because Mommy was asking me to
[53:32] come to
[53:36] church but because God placed something
[53:39] into my
[53:40] [Applause]
[53:41] heart that to recognize that everything
[53:44] that he
[53:45] said is life for
[53:48] me and everything that he didn't
[53:52] say I I rather give my life
[53:58] than to go in what he didn't
[54:01] say they asked for a
[54:03] favor to the unic of the
[54:08] king that what you are proposing to
[54:14] us according to what God has placed into
[54:16] our
[54:18] heart we cannot do
[54:21] it give us a favor
[54:27] just give us uh uh vegetables or and
[54:30] then give us
[54:34] water the unic said well if something
[54:38] happen it's going to be upon me that
[54:40] that's going to
[54:42] come the king will be will be furious
[54:46] with
[54:48] me he said just give us few
[54:54] days you can give
[54:58] others whatever you are
[55:01] proposing give us what we are
[55:04] asking in few
[55:07] days you will
[55:11] compare and you will present to the king
[55:13] both
[55:17] groups you will see which ones are in
[55:20] good
[55:25] standing the the unic
[55:29] accepted they took water and and
[55:37] vegetables uh certainly according to the
[55:40] scientist of that
[55:43] time it was impossible to have the the
[55:46] regimen or the way of
[55:49] eating and to be in good
[55:54] health but according to the one who's
[55:57] above
[56:03] science the one who realized that this
[56:06] young man had honor his
[56:09] [Music]
[56:11] word he who the creator of all the the
[56:15] the cells and the
[56:18] organism he came into
[56:23] action to give this this young man a
[56:26] good
[56:27] health to show to the
[56:32] king that these kids are on the right
[56:37] way and when they were
[56:41] presented they
[56:42] had they had a good presentation upon
[56:45] them than the ones who ate the food from
[56:48] the
[56:49] King
[56:52] maybe that if there were other kids
[56:57] who who didn't have the same seed in
[57:02] them who had tempted or tried to take
[57:05] the same food as what they
[57:08] did surely they would stand before the
[57:14] king they would send up uh uh and and
[57:17] and look very
[57:20] skinny
[57:23] why this regiment
[57:26] could could only
[57:28] work for those children who had this
[57:31] particular seed in
[57:33] them not uh uh to be
[57:37] amazed that when the word is brought
[57:44] forth if not everybody can receive that
[57:47] word the same
[57:51] way because not everybody has the same
[57:54] seed
[57:58] but when God placed the seed in
[58:01] us he
[58:04] himself he protects it he takes care of
[58:08] it he keeps
[58:13] it and we see how these young men in
[58:17] Babylon as they were growing
[58:21] up that they were considered they had a
[58:24] the king had a consideration about them
[58:29] Daniel was there interpreting the dreams
[58:31] of the
[58:33] king they had
[58:36] favor and those that were
[58:39] around they were not
[58:44] happy they were trying to create
[58:46] problems for these young men for these
[58:49] young
[58:55] menil will never be happy for you to
[58:58] remain a
[59:01] Christian that you may only that anytime
[59:04] you only have an absolute the only
[59:07] absolute to be the word of
[59:11] God he's always going to try to create
[59:18] situations or to try to bring you into a
[59:22] distraction and there you you you lost
[59:25] your vision
[59:32] or to try to confront you face to
[59:39] face it's like
[59:42] today I was talking with brother Billy
[59:45] in the
[59:50] office sometimes when we look at it it's
[59:52] with tears in our
[59:54] eyes it was saying the
[59:56] morning with
[59:59] love when a brother does
[1:00:02] something with with the love you go to
[1:00:05] them you you try to bring him
[1:00:08] up you you try to help him but
[1:00:13] today my brother Ben do does something
[1:00:17] wrong I haven't even talked to
[1:00:19] him I already recorded a
[1:00:23] video it's already on social media
[1:00:29] it's a
[1:00:32] distraction it's the
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:39] devil the people are fighting on social
[1:00:42] media trying to find out who's who's got
[1:00:44] the most
[1:00:48] knowledge I was reading brother was
[1:00:51] saying somewhere
[1:00:57] we have a we have a generation of of
[1:01:00] Elders who have gone
[1:01:02] out they were calling them
[1:01:05] veterans but the
[1:01:07] problem is they organized
[1:01:10] themselves and they fought between
[1:01:13] themselves and they disputed among
[1:01:16] themselves it's the
[1:01:23] devil where God wants to keep us United
[1:01:32] God as he said in his
[1:01:33] prayer
[1:01:35] father that it may be
[1:01:38] one as you and I are
[1:01:44] one so the
[1:01:47] devil when if it doesn't bring you into
[1:01:52] destruction he takes you away from the
[1:01:54] word of God
[1:01:56] he's going to come to you face to
[1:02:00] face and because he couldn't take this
[1:02:03] children into
[1:02:06] destruction he confronted
[1:02:09] Shadrach Shadrach M and
[1:02:12] Abednego with a burning
[1:02:16] furnace that was heated up seven
[1:02:21] times it was to show them now
[1:02:26] you're going to you're going to deny
[1:02:27] your
[1:02:30] God but shadra
[1:02:35] Abed that King said nobody can deliver
[1:02:38] you out of my
[1:02:39] hand he said oh you are a
[1:02:42] liar our God is
[1:02:45] [Applause]
[1:02:48] capable you see you think your God will
[1:02:50] help you he said our God is
[1:02:54] able even if doesn't Deliver
[1:02:58] us if he thinks that the end of our
[1:03:02] journey is the
[1:03:05] fness we're going to go in there
[1:03:08] joyfully but we will never do
[1:03:13] this they were uh
[1:03:16] bounded they took them towards the
[1:03:20] furnace it was so
[1:03:23] hard that those that were coming to put
[1:03:25] put them
[1:03:26] in they were
[1:03:29] burned but
[1:03:31] them that were going in they didn't go
[1:03:34] in
[1:03:37] burned
[1:03:40] scientifically we don't know how to
[1:03:41] explain
[1:03:42] that there was a
[1:03:45] flame that had a
[1:03:48] temperature uh maybe below
[1:03:52] 60 FL but a flame
[1:04:00] why because they stay
[1:04:03] faithful they kept the
[1:04:05] [Applause]
[1:04:06] [Music]
[1:04:07] word and God kept his part of the
[1:04:14] contract but explains that he
[1:04:17] says when they were going into the
[1:04:20] flame oh there was an agitation with the
[1:04:24] angels
[1:04:27] were those are saying let me go and
[1:04:29] destroy
[1:04:31] everything let me go do
[1:04:34] this God looked and he
[1:04:37] said he said to what whatever concerns
[1:04:40] my
[1:04:40] children I'm not sending any of you I
[1:04:44] will go
[1:04:45] myself and I'll go
[1:04:48] down he came down in the
[1:04:51] furnace like the fourth man
[1:04:59] Daniel was confronted with with the lion
[1:05:03] dance God saved
[1:05:08] them if there was a young those were
[1:05:11] young men who kept the
[1:05:14] word and they grew
[1:05:18] old and as they grew old Daniel
[1:05:23] Daniel he came back to the
[1:05:26] word he was meditating the
[1:05:29] word what did the word
[1:05:32] say what is this supposed what what's
[1:05:35] supposed to happen in our
[1:05:37] time why is this thing happening over
[1:05:41] there why is this event over
[1:05:44] there the Bible
[1:05:47] says that in
[1:05:49] Reading Daniel came to the
[1:05:54] realization in meditating the
[1:05:57] word Daniel came to the
[1:06:03] realization Daniel discerned the time
[1:06:06] under which he was
[1:06:10] living Daniel realized in what time he
[1:06:13] was living
[1:06:15] in and when he realized the time he was
[1:06:18] living
[1:06:19] in so an
[1:06:21] attitude his attitude changed
[1:06:29] when we discern the time in which we are
[1:06:36] living when we realize the privilege
[1:06:39] under which God has placed
[1:06:45] us I I feel like saying we cannot remain
[1:06:51] indiff our
[1:06:53] attitude Daniel Daniel
[1:06:57] says that he turned towards
[1:07:00] prayer to his
[1:07:03] supplication in the
[1:07:08] fasting he was looking for communion
[1:07:11] with
[1:07:14] God because it's in prayer that we
[1:07:16] commune with
[1:07:18] God that we talk to
[1:07:21] God that God talks back to us Daniel
[1:07:27] Daniel turned towards
[1:07:32] God before we saw that Daniel was
[1:07:35] praying three times a
[1:07:39] day but when he saw by the
[1:07:43] word he turned towards
[1:07:45] prayer in the
[1:07:47] supplication in the
[1:07:50] fasting
[1:07:53] says in gab Gabriel's instruction to
[1:07:56] Daniel paragraph
[1:08:01] 78 it says I want you to
[1:08:03] notice how
[1:08:06] Daniel yet an
[1:08:10] alen
[1:08:12] yet outed from his
[1:08:15] people outed from his
[1:08:18] church without one church
[1:08:21] service without any church to go to
[1:08:25] without any hymn to sing to Be
[1:08:28] Sung but what he has sung
[1:08:31] himself in the midst of all of
[1:08:36] this still held on to what the prophet
[1:08:39] said amen amen amen amen no church to go
[1:08:45] to nobody to fellowship
[1:08:49] with everybody went to the hidden
[1:08:53] temples everybody worshiped
[1:08:56] they Idol no Christian
[1:08:59] song nobody believed the same thing he
[1:09:04] did and in 68
[1:09:09] years from a young man from a young man
[1:09:12] of about
[1:09:18] 12 from the a young man about 12 about
[1:09:22] 12 or 14 when he was taken down
[1:09:27] there he held true to
[1:09:31] God and understood by Jeremiah's
[1:09:35] Prophet that the days were almost
[1:09:44] accomplished how that he says how that
[1:09:47] would warm the hearts of any true
[1:09:50] prophet of that of of God today
[1:09:57] that we look back and see what this true
[1:10:00] Prophet
[1:10:03] said and know that we are at the end
[1:10:07] time he
[1:10:10] said I understood by the
[1:10:14] book by the
[1:10:17] book that Jeremiah my
[1:10:20] brother many years ago
[1:10:26] prophesy that Israel will stay down here
[1:10:29] for 70
[1:10:31] years and the time is about
[1:10:34] fulfilled and he made himself
[1:10:38] ready and he called and he called a
[1:10:41] fast and he Sanctified
[1:10:45] himself and he says the Ash and
[1:10:48] sackcloth he put upon his head
[1:10:56] and when and and went to fasting and
[1:10:58] praying to understand about what about
[1:11:01] what day they were living
[1:11:03] in and if
[1:11:05] Daniel the Prophet of the
[1:11:09] Lord could consult Jeremiah's
[1:11:14] book and it will bring such a it will
[1:11:17] bring him to to such a
[1:11:20] place that even Israel coming out
[1:11:28] all of them alive was coming out of
[1:11:30] Babylon to go back to their
[1:11:33] Homeland would cause him to
[1:11:36] fast with sackcloth and
[1:11:43] Ashes how much more how much more hard
[1:11:47] hard it to do to the Church of the
[1:11:48] Living
[1:11:51] God to know that the time is fading out
[1:11:56] and shall be no
[1:11:58] more and the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:03] Christ and the great
[1:12:05] Millennium ready to set
[1:12:10] in how can we spend uh wasteless time
[1:12:14] gambling swimming whole on
[1:12:17] Sunday no time for the
[1:12:20] Lord just run down
[1:12:25] and if the pastor uh speaks on something
[1:12:29] uh another that that you don't
[1:12:31] like you get up and you get
[1:12:34] out and if the church holds on too long
[1:12:38] why and then you are
[1:12:41] dissatisfied look at our
[1:12:44] condition look at look what we are
[1:12:49] doing compare our lives with that
[1:12:53] Prophet one man
[1:12:57] in a complete
[1:12:58] Kingdom with no
[1:13:01] church no church to go to and no and and
[1:13:05] none knowwhere else to
[1:13:08] go it was soore down and burned down his
[1:13:11] City his people was
[1:13:15] captive 68 years 68 years
[1:13:21] 69
[1:13:23] 70 he had two years
[1:13:27] left so when he began to read in the
[1:13:32] book and and see that the time was
[1:13:35] drawing
[1:13:37] n to fulfill be
[1:13:41] fulfilled he went to God In
[1:13:45] Prayer to find out about
[1:13:50] it when we read in the
[1:13:53] word when we read in the
[1:13:55] book like
[1:13:58] Jeremiah we say we see the Bible tells
[1:14:01] us what happened in the time of
[1:14:04] Noah will happen
[1:14:08] again we see how women wants to make can
[1:14:11] become
[1:14:13] beautiful with all kinds of makeup
[1:14:17] stuff what happened in the time of
[1:14:20] lot will happen
[1:14:23] again where men wants to become women
[1:14:26] women wants to become
[1:14:29] men we see all those
[1:14:33] things the Bible tells us in the last
[1:14:38] days that man will become
[1:14:41] cruel it will become enemy of those that
[1:14:44] wants to do good we see that in the
[1:14:51] Bible but instead like Daniel
[1:14:56] that our attitude be
[1:14:59] changed we are we are uh remaining in
[1:15:08] distraction we pay we give more
[1:15:10] attention to other things than the word
[1:15:12] of
[1:15:13] God says paragra
[1:15:18] 82 what a
[1:15:22] time what are we doing
[1:15:26] when nations are

[1:15:34] roaring men's hearts are are failing for
[1:15:38] fear perplex of

[1:15:56] and FES and fights and
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:08] stews and weapons hanging in the hangers
[1:16:12] that one little Nation by the size of
[1:16:15] Cuba down here can destroy the the world
[1:16:19] in 10 minutes
[1:16:29] and them fasting with one another
[1:16:32] ungodly man who knows not God and knows
[1:16:36] not his
[1:16:41] power and the Holy Spirit is in the
[1:16:43] church moving among the
[1:16:48] elect showing himself alive after 2,000
[1:16:52] years
[1:16:56] that is the same yesterday today and
[1:17:01] forever how can we set how can we sit uh
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:10] slofly how can we just run over the top
[1:17:13] of
[1:17:15] it time it says time where we are time
[1:17:19] where we checking
[1:17:23] up watching for that great hour
[1:17:27] approaching like this young
[1:17:31] man God is plac a seed in
[1:17:35] us that seed that recognizes the word of
[1:17:40] God and as we read the
[1:17:44] book may God Place into our
[1:17:47] hearts his true
[1:17:51] love that will bring us back
[1:17:56] to an attitude like one like Daniel
[1:18:00] had
[1:18:02] saysi in the uh uh 70 weeks of
[1:18:10] Daniel uh paragraph
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:16] 43 now let's
[1:18:20] review just a little bit so we can get a
[1:18:22] base
[1:18:27] Dani it says now there there was Daniel
[1:18:30] was concerned about his
[1:18:34] people because he had read the Prophet
[1:18:37] Jeremiah the
[1:18:43] prophet and understood that Jeremiah had
[1:18:46] said that they would be in captivity for
[1:18:48] 7
[1:18:51] years and then he seen that they had
[1:18:54] already been in captivity for 6
[1:18:58] years so he knew that the time was at
[1:19:03] hand so he set aside all his
[1:19:10] work pull down as it was the shades all
[1:19:15] his day daily
[1:19:18] task set his face to
[1:19:22] God put on sackcloth and
[1:19:27] [Music]
[1:19:31] ashes and went to fasting and praying
[1:19:35] that he might understand when that time
[1:19:37] would
[1:19:38] be paragraph
[1:19:45] 44 he said now now that we found out
[1:19:49] that Daniel that he wanted this
[1:19:51] information for his people
[1:19:55] and I think if
[1:19:58] Daniel reading the prophet before
[1:20:01] [Applause]
[1:20:04] him and had this kind of
[1:20:10] understanding that he was he was near
[1:20:13] the end and sought God to find out how
[1:20:16] close the end
[1:20:21] was then I think we are Justified by
[1:20:25] seeing that we are at the end of the
[1:20:27] road
[1:20:39] now says put on uh uh put on not
[1:20:43] sackcloth and Ashes but throw all the
[1:20:46] things of the world and our cares of and
[1:20:50] and our cares of this
[1:20:53] life and seek
[1:20:57] God to find out what day of the year we
[1:21:01] are
[1:21:03] in because we are seeing that we are at
[1:21:05] the
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:12] end and so that the church will Fast and
[1:21:15] pray to be
[1:21:18] ready like
[1:21:22] Daniel we have had the privilege
[1:21:29] to get into the promise concerning our
[1:21:32] time because when we read the
[1:21:36] book we see
[1:21:39] Daniel who saw the Plan of
[1:21:43] Redemption he saw it for the Jews and
[1:21:46] for the
[1:21:47] Gentiles he wanted to write it in Daniel
[1:21:51] chapter
[1:21:52] 12 the scripture say Daniel go in
[1:21:56] peace do not write this
[1:21:59] things but in the end
[1:22:01] time when these things will be
[1:22:05] revealed the knowledge shall
[1:22:08] increase So Daniel saw
[1:22:12] things that God told him not to write
[1:22:15] about
[1:22:16] it because he thought about you and
[1:22:21] I in whom God had placed his seated
[1:22:25] for the end
[1:22:27] time when John came
[1:22:30] about God John saw the same
[1:22:34] thing God revealed to him the Plan of
[1:22:38] Redemption John wanted to write
[1:22:40] it God told him to seal those
[1:22:43] things but the day of the voice of the
[1:22:47] seventh
[1:22:49] angel when he begin to sound the
[1:22:52] trumpet but the mystery of
[1:22:55] God God has given us
[1:22:58] Grace in placing his seat inside of
[1:23:03] us to bring us in contact with the
[1:23:06] message of the seventh
[1:23:08] angel and we know that this messenger of
[1:23:11] the seventh
[1:23:13] angel is the same of malach
[1:23:16] 4 he has to come and open the
[1:23:20] word before this coming of the Lord
[1:23:25] that he must come and give us all the
[1:23:28] material so we are
[1:23:31] able to go and meet him in the
[1:23:34] [Music]
[1:23:37] air and this seventh
[1:23:43] angel God gave him the ability for him
[1:23:46] to reveal things to
[1:23:48] us so today I can no longer come
[1:23:54] I'm going to come and preach to you the
[1:23:56] mystery
[1:23:58] of for for me there are no more
[1:24:02] Mysteries the seventh angel has already
[1:24:05] brought it
[1:24:06] forth and like this
[1:24:08] morning like Brother David was
[1:24:11] saying with a with a
[1:24:15] message we are reading through the
[1:24:18] book we can read the
[1:24:21] book and realize what's written on the
[1:24:24] book
[1:24:28] Jesus
[1:24:29] himself in Matthew chapter
[1:24:34] 24 he described to us the Plan of
[1:24:38] Redemption when they asked him a
[1:24:41] question he described the Plan of
[1:24:46] Redemption and when I went home between
[1:24:49] services
[1:24:55] can I was reading in the Seal's book and
[1:24:58] I fall upon something I Came Upon
[1:25:00] something in the Sixth
[1:25:04] Seal tells us that in Matthew
[1:25:09] 24 Jesus preached the seventh
[1:25:13] seal and he took his
[1:25:16] Bible I believe it's the Sixth
[1:25:20] Seal uh paragraph 140
[1:25:26] it said he said
[1:25:29] now let's look at Ma Matthew chapter
[1:25:32] Matthew
[1:25:35] 24 the lamb himself
[1:25:37] speaking
[1:25:41] now it said now anyone knows that Christ
[1:25:45] is the author of the whole
[1:25:47] book as far as as far as that
[1:25:50] concerned but it's his speech here he
[1:25:53] his seron
[1:25:55] the people all right the
[1:26:01] Jews it says now I want you to hold your
[1:26:04] book like
[1:26:06] this Matthew
[1:26:10] 24 so I'll take like brother bam was
[1:26:18] speaking Matthew
[1:26:22] 24 like thisth
[1:26:25] apy Matthew 2 Matthew 24 and and
[1:26:29] Revelation chapter
[1:26:40] 6 so he wants us to take the book like
[1:26:44] this Matthew
[1:26:46] 24 and Revelation chapter
[1:26:49] 6 he says
[1:26:57] he says now watch
[1:27:03] this you you you can find out just how
[1:27:07] it
[1:27:09] is see what the lamb what what the lamb
[1:27:13] here is
[1:27:14] showing Sy exactly in symbols
[1:27:20] ex what he said over here in the
[1:27:25] word doing
[1:27:29] exactly
[1:27:36] continues paragraph
[1:27:40] 147 that's where he began to H give the
[1:27:44] the explanation or the to
[1:27:47] show he
[1:27:49] says for the first
[1:27:52] seal when you take the the first seal in
[1:27:56] in Revelation chapter
[1:27:58] 6 verse 1 and
[1:28:01] two it said and I saw when the lamb
[1:28:04] opened one of the
[1:28:09] seals and I and I heard as it was the
[1:28:12] noise of the Thunders and of and and of
[1:28:16] the four Beast
[1:28:20] saying and I and I saw and behold a
[1:28:23] white horse
[1:28:26] and he that sat on him had a
[1:28:29] bow and a crown was given unto
[1:28:34] him and he went forth conquering and to
[1:28:38] conquer is
[1:28:40] saying that he was the
[1:28:44] Antichrist because he was already
[1:28:48] crowned when Christ is supposed to be
[1:28:50] crowned by the the the the the Saints
[1:28:54] when you take
[1:28:58] that and you go to Matthew
[1:29:00] 24 verse
[1:29:03] 4 and Jesus
[1:29:06] answered and said unto them take heed
[1:29:09] that no man sedu
[1:29:12] you for many shall come in my
[1:29:17] name saying I am
[1:29:20] Christ and shall deceive many
[1:29:24] it said that's
[1:29:26] Antichrist and he said when you go to
[1:29:28] the second
[1:29:30] seal uh uh Revelation 634 uh 6 uh 3 and
[1:29:37] 4 it says and when he had open the the
[1:29:40] second
[1:29:42] seal I heard the second beast saying
[1:29:45] come and
[1:29:47] see and then it said they went out
[1:29:50] another horse that was red
[1:29:57] and power was given to him that said uh
[1:30:00] that sat thereon and take the peace from
[1:30:02] the
[1:30:06] earth and that they should kill one
[1:30:10] another and there was given unto him a
[1:30:13] great
[1:30:15] sword it said when you go to Matthew
[1:30:17] chapter
[1:30:18] 24 verse 6
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:24] said and ye shall hear of wars and
[1:30:26] rumors of
[1:30:28] wars so it was the peace that was being
[1:30:31] taken
[1:30:35] out you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[1:30:39] War see that no man
[1:30:42] troubl see that ye not be
[1:30:45] troubled for all those things must come
[1:30:48] to
[1:30:49] pass but the end is not
[1:30:52] yet and when you that he took the third
[1:30:57] seal uh verse five and
[1:31:00] six uh uh Revelation chapter
[1:31:04] 6 and when he had opened the third
[1:31:08] seal I heard the third Beast
[1:31:12] saying come and see and be and and
[1:31:15] beheld and lo a black
[1:31:20] horse and he that said on that said on
[1:31:23] him
[1:31:24] had a pair of balance in his
[1:31:27] hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of
[1:31:30] the fourth Beast
[1:31:34] saying a measure of wheat for a
[1:31:38] panic and three measure of Bley for a
[1:31:42] penny and see that thou hurt not the oil
[1:31:46] and the
[1:31:47] wine it said in Matthew
[1:31:50] 24 7 and 8
[1:31:55] for nation shall rise against
[1:31:57] Nations and Kingdom against
[1:32:02] Kingdom and there shall be famine and
[1:32:07] pestilence over there there was a
[1:32:09] balance to weigh because there was a
[1:32:13] famine and here Jesus said there will be
[1:32:16] famine on the
[1:32:19] earth and says and all of that will be
[1:32:21] only the beginning of the birth pain
[1:32:25] and when he took the fourth
[1:32:28] seal uh uh verse seven and
[1:32:31] 8 I'll take eight verse
[1:32:35] eight and I look and behold a Pale
[1:32:40] Horse and his name that and and the name
[1:32:45] that set on him was
[1:32:47] death and Hell Followed
[1:32:52] him and power was given unto him over
[1:32:55] the fourth part of the earth to kill
[1:32:58] with the
[1:32:59] sword and and with hunger and with
[1:33:04] death and with beast of the
[1:33:07] earth it was it was a a beast and and
[1:33:11] and the
[1:33:12] Earth and when we take Matthew
[1:33:14] 24 verse
[1:33:21] 9 then shall they deliver you up to to
[1:33:25] be afflicted and shall kill you and ye
[1:33:28] shall be hated of all the nation for my
[1:33:31] name's
[1:33:32] sake he says the fifth
[1:33:36] seal vers verse 9-
[1:33:42] 11 and then he says when he had opened
[1:33:45] the the fifth
[1:33:50] seal I saw under the altar The Souls of
[1:33:53] them that were slain for the word of
[1:33:56] God and for the testimony that they they
[1:34:00] held and they cried with a loud voice
[1:34:03] saying how long
[1:34:06] lord said those were
[1:34:09] Marrs there was Souls Under The
[1:34:13] Altar and when we take Matthew
[1:34:16] 24 uh 9
[1:34:19] to2 we see that there were those that
[1:34:22] had given their lives
[1:34:24] verse 10 the Bible
[1:34:26] says and then
[1:34:29] many and it says and then shall be many
[1:34:33] of of uh
[1:34:34] of offended and shall be
[1:34:39] betrayed shall betray one another and
[1:34:42] shall hate one
[1:34:45] another there were people that are going
[1:34:47] to betray one
[1:34:49] another and there will be those that
[1:34:51] will give their lives for the word
[1:34:55] and when he came to the Sixth
[1:35:00] Seal verse 12 and
[1:35:04] 13 and I
[1:35:07] beheld when he had opened the six
[1:35:10] se and L there was a great
[1:35:13] earthquake and the sun became uh black
[1:35:17] as
[1:35:18] sackcloth and the moon became as blood
[1:35:23] the star of Heaven fell upon the
[1:35:26] Earth even as a fig tree H casted forth
[1:35:31] uh um timly
[1:35:35] fig it said that Jesus spoke about it in
[1:35:37] Matthew
[1:35:39] 24 verse
[1:35:42] 29 it says immediately after the
[1:35:45] tribulation those days shall the Sun
[1:35:48] darken and the moon shall not give it
[1:35:51] light and the star shall fall from
[1:35:55] Heaven and the power of Heaven shall be
[1:36:00] shaken the same
[1:36:04] way and Jesus didn't speak about the
[1:36:06] seventh
[1:36:07] seal as it was in The Book of
[1:36:13] Revelation every uh uh uh uh seals is in
[1:36:17] the Revelation chapter
[1:36:20] 6 but Revelation chapter 7 it continu to
[1:36:29] speak then the seven
[1:36:31] seal it comes from Revelation 8 uh verse
[1:36:38] one and when we take Matthew
[1:36:42] 24 when he opened the seventh
[1:36:45] seal there was a silence in
[1:36:48] heaven but says it was the coming of the
[1:36:51] Lord
[1:36:54] in Matthew
[1:36:55] 24 it's verse
[1:36:57] 36 that Jesus
[1:36:59] says but for for but of that day and the
[1:37:04] hour no one
[1:37:06] knows it
[1:37:08] says uh no one knows not not even not
[1:37:11] not the angels of
[1:37:13] heaven uh not even the son but the
[1:37:17] father
[1:37:22] only so sometimes we bring to try to
[1:37:25] complicate the
[1:37:27] message when brother
[1:37:31] Bram he's telling us things in a simple
[1:37:36] way he he preached God highd himself and
[1:37:39] revealed himself in
[1:37:42] Simplicity before bringing big uh great
[1:37:45] things God has given as
[1:37:48] Grace to read in the
[1:37:52] book and to taking the mirror of the
[1:37:56] message and when we read like Daniel we
[1:38:01] realize that we are at the end
[1:38:04] time and what is our
[1:38:07] attitude what are we supposed to be
[1:38:10] doing God is inviting us to do like
[1:38:15] Daniel is to turn ourselves towards the
[1:38:18] B the
[1:38:21] word to abandon all the superficial
[1:38:27] things to to abandon all the things that
[1:38:29] are not
[1:38:32] useful to abandon all the
[1:38:37] distraction and to focus on the
[1:38:41] word as the musicians are
[1:38:44] coming my brother my
[1:38:47] sister like the young Hebrews
[1:38:54] if we have if we have he have the
[1:38:55] opportunity to be in church
[1:38:59] tonight if we have the opportunity to
[1:39:01] come in contact with this
[1:39:04] message if we have the opportunity to
[1:39:07] love this
[1:39:09] message is because God placed a seed in
[1:39:15] US Jesus looked at Peter Simon he said
[1:39:19] Simon Simon Simon
[1:39:25] Satan claimed
[1:39:28] you he wanted to sift you like a
[1:39:33] weed every one of us is like
[1:39:36] Simon Satan is claiming
[1:39:41] you so that he may se you like
[1:39:44] weed but glory be to
[1:39:47] God because Jesus told Peter I prayed
[1:39:50] for
[1:39:51] you that your faith may not
[1:39:54] fail Jesus prayed for you Jesus prayed
[1:39:58] for
[1:39:59] me so that my faith will hold
[1:40:05] strong that regardless of what the enemy
[1:40:08] will put on my
[1:40:13] way regardless of what level uh the the
[1:40:17] enemy will bring me
[1:40:18] in that this seed in
[1:40:21] me I am a son of God
[1:40:25] there's a true
[1:40:28] word and even if it come to
[1:40:34] pass that you find yourself in the most
[1:40:37] uh difficult
[1:40:40] situation uh the Bible speaks to us
[1:40:43] about the parable of the prodical
[1:40:48] son he said this man had two kids
[1:40:53] this one who came to his father he said
[1:40:56] give me my my
[1:40:59] portion he take his portion of the
[1:41:02] wealth
[1:41:06] inheritance the scripture says he went
[1:41:08] and squandered at all in the things of
[1:41:10] the
[1:41:13] world he he found himself in the
[1:41:18] world to to a point where he didn't have
[1:41:20] nothing
[1:41:24] that he was even negotiating pigs
[1:41:30] food you know when we speak about the
[1:41:32] nature of
[1:41:34] pigs it's the the the dirtiest
[1:41:42] nature the Bible says this kid they
[1:41:44] plunged thems in a complete
[1:41:49] wickedness I cannot even imagine what he
[1:41:52] had to do to be doing doing in the
[1:41:54] world maybe he committed
[1:41:57] crimes maybe he did horrible
[1:42:01] things but in that
[1:42:06] state the little seed that was in
[1:42:10] him it says this is not my
[1:42:13] place I have a
[1:42:16] father I am a son
[1:42:23] I cannot continue to find myself in
[1:42:25] situations like
[1:42:27] this when I have a heavenly
[1:42:30] father who's rich in
[1:42:33] Mercy who's
[1:42:37] good even if he doesn't receive me as
[1:42:40] his
[1:42:42] child I can ask him to just be his
[1:42:46] servant but I have to
[1:42:50] go he didn't say well I I I deceived my
[1:42:54] father what I
[1:42:56] did it's impossible for
[1:43:00] me
[1:43:03] says the only unpardonable
[1:43:07] sin is the blasphemy against the Holy
[1:43:12] Ghost when all other
[1:43:17] sins God provided the sin the the
[1:43:21] sacrifice for the forgiveness
[1:43:26] that that may not hold you so you stay
[1:43:30] there this prodal
[1:43:32] son he went back to his
[1:43:38] father when his father saw
[1:43:41] him he didn't even
[1:43:45] need that he may even express his
[1:43:50] repentance he was happy to see him
[1:43:56] he he he killed a fatter
[1:43:59] calf he gave him a white
[1:44:03] road to the point where his
[1:44:06] brother who is a good
[1:44:08] brother who had never
[1:44:11] backslid never a good brother a good
[1:44:17] Christian you never done this for
[1:44:21] me him who lost
[1:44:25] Everything You Killed the fat
[1:44:28] C the same God is's
[1:44:33] able is able to do it for each and every
[1:44:36] one of
[1:44:37] us to bring us
[1:44:40] back to the attitude of
[1:44:46] Daniel you may turn to a a a real
[1:44:50] relation uh uh relation with them
[1:44:55] with a true
[1:44:57] love not
[1:44:59] a some resemblance of love but real
[1:45:05] love this morning our pastor talked to
[1:45:07] us about
[1:45:10] possessing something that you should be
[1:45:16] possessing not something that God wants
[1:45:19] you to possess
[1:45:23] that but that you must
[1:45:29] possess and every one of us can go into
[1:45:31] their
[1:45:33] heart and ask and and find out if you
[1:45:36] have it or
[1:45:37] not and if you don't possess it he said
[1:45:42] he's going to give it to
[1:45:47] you
[1:45:49] because he placed a seed in you so you
[1:45:51] can desire it
[1:46:01] not so we can only think about it or or
[1:46:04] or act like we have
[1:46:06] it but in doing our
[1:46:10] inventory
[1:46:13] said because only perfect love will get
[1:46:20] in and we are all here so we may enter
[1:46:27] in we are like Travelers that
[1:46:30] have taken uh taken off for a
[1:46:36] destination
[1:46:38] and we don't want to have trouble at at
[1:46:42] at the arrival
[1:46:44] Point may God help
[1:46:47] us to be like Dan to do like
[1:46:50] Daniel to come back to prayer
[1:46:54] that we may claim this
[1:46:57] possession this love of
[1:46:59] God this true
[1:47:01] love because when we read in the
[1:47:04] book there is no more
[1:47:08] time as we bow our
[1:47:15] heads God our heavenly father
[1:47:23] you know that even I myself I am
[1:47:26] concerned by this
[1:47:29] words so I I join together with my
[1:47:34] brothers I join together with my
[1:47:38] sisters we want to do like
[1:47:41] Daniel we want to turn towards
[1:47:46] you may you forgive our negligence
[1:47:53] may you forgive our
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:47:57] shortcomings we know that you placed
[1:47:59] that seat inside of
[1:48:02] us and you are the only one who can
[1:48:05] perfect
[1:48:06] it that's why you've called us
[1:48:10] tonight that's why you spoke to us
[1:48:13] tonight and we know that your word
[1:48:15] cannot come
[1:48:17] forth and return to

[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:53:55] through
[1:53:57] me amen you know the hour of Prophecy
[1:54:02] came when Jesus had spoken these words
[1:54:05] there should not be one stone left upon
[1:54:09] another and when that hour came there
[1:54:12] wasn't a Believer left in
[1:54:15] Jerusalem they have all
[1:54:18] fled because they
[1:54:20] recognized the hour that they're
[1:54:24] there and as our brother admonished us
[1:54:27] that we can look in the word of God and
[1:54:29] see the time we're
[1:54:31] in and it's not going to get
[1:54:35] easier it's going to be harder and
[1:54:39] harder and harder to be a
[1:54:43] Christian and the world's going to make
[1:54:45] it
[1:54:46] harder in fact they're going to do all
[1:54:50] that they can to turn you out
[1:54:55] and they're going to make it difficult
[1:54:57] for us to make a living going to make it
[1:55:00] difficult for us to go to
[1:55:02] church they they're going to want to
[1:55:04] take it and turn this into a storehouse
[1:55:06] they're going to do everything they can
[1:55:09] to to keep us from going
[1:55:14] forward and I'd like to say there's
[1:55:16] going to come a
[1:55:17] time where we're going to have to live
[1:55:22] by the promises of God that's
[1:55:25] right there there's nothing we can turn
[1:55:28] to we our our
[1:55:30] minds will fail us of how to figure
[1:55:33] things
[1:55:34] out we will be so
[1:55:37] alienated from the thinking of the world
[1:55:40] and why they do the things that they do
[1:55:44] that we'll just di back in amazement in
[1:55:47] fact our lips will be crying every
[1:55:50] morning even so come quickly
[1:55:52] Lord
[1:55:54] Jesus and there's only one thing that
[1:55:56] we'll be able to live by and that's by
[1:55:59] the word of God we'll have to live by
[1:56:04] these precious promises that he gave us
[1:56:08] I'll never leave you I'll never forsake
[1:56:11] you the righteous shall never beg bread
[1:56:14] I'll provide for you I'll make a way for
[1:56:17] you you're going to have to King cling
[1:56:20] so true to this world word be so
[1:56:23] familiar with it be so lost in it that
[1:56:27] it becomes your
[1:56:29] life because he wants no part of
[1:56:32] you he doesn't want you in his
[1:56:35] kingdom he doesn't want you in his
[1:56:39] economy he doesn't want to have nothing
[1:56:42] to do with
[1:56:43] you and you better get ready for
[1:56:48] it we saw it in the great story that was
[1:56:51] told to us this morning morning how they
[1:56:53] finally cast them out and they say you
[1:56:56] were born in sin you are a sinner from
[1:56:58] begin with uh we are not his
[1:57:02] disciples and they'll kill you thinking
[1:57:04] that they're doing God of service
[1:57:06] they'll kill your
[1:57:07] influence but as our brother told us
[1:57:10] tonight Now's the
[1:57:12] Time well you can to make your
[1:57:15] commitment to the word of
[1:57:18] God to separate yourself to
[1:57:22] purpose in your
[1:57:24] heart that the Revelation is not going
[1:57:27] to be
[1:57:31] secondhand you're not going to get it
[1:57:33] because it's preached over the pulpit
[1:57:36] you're not going to get it because you
[1:57:37] talked about it with somebody but you're
[1:57:40] going to go find out it for yourself
[1:57:43] where you
[1:57:45] personally can identify yourself in the
[1:57:48] word of God and you can say he's was
[1:57:52] talking about
[1:57:55] me I am I am what he said would be and
[1:58:01] you stay true to it it'll stay true to
[1:58:04] you amen you stay true to him he'll be
[1:58:08] there for you no matter how dark the
[1:58:10] hour is he'll never leave you or never
[1:58:14] forsake you amen that's the kind of God
[1:58:18] we serve as our brother told that story
[1:58:21] about the prod son that made me want to
[1:58:24] sing that song I have a
[1:58:26] father amen you have a father I've got a
[1:58:30] father tonight I lost my natural
[1:58:35] father
[1:58:38] my Earthly mother
[1:58:41] who God's given to me for many years you
[1:58:46] know she's of the Catholic
[1:58:48] faith she called the priest to come give
[1:58:52] her her last
[1:58:55] rights I think in her own heart she
[1:58:58] doesn't feel her times long on this
[1:59:03] Earth I'm beginning to
[1:59:07] see signs of the many
[1:59:11] years that she's lived and lived her
[1:59:15] faith starting to take his toll
[1:59:20] [Music]
[1:59:22] and one day my both of my parents will
[1:59:25] be
[1:59:27] gone and I appreciate them for bringing
[1:59:30] me into the
[1:59:31] world but above it all I have come to
[1:59:35] find out that I have a father I have
[1:59:38] another father I have another home and

[2:06:45] dull of
[2:06:47] hearing and everything that's
[2:06:50] spoken has turned to
[2:06:53] knowledge and you say I know that I know
[2:06:57] that I understand that I believe that
[2:07:00] I've been taught
[2:07:02] that and there's no more conviction left
[2:07:06] in the word of
[2:07:08] God there's no more
[2:07:10] leadership left in the word of God
[2:07:12] there's God's no longer speaking to you
[2:07:16] to get you to do this or to get to that
[2:07:19] you've just Fallen under the great big
[2:07:21] blanket
[2:07:23] of Doctrine and teaching and the
