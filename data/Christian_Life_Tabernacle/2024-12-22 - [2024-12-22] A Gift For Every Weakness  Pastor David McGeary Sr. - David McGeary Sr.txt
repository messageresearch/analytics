there's no way to measure the amount of work that has gone into this and the effort it takes and uh you'll see by just the size of the of the group of the young people to get them to work together and coordinate and be with one another and tolerate one another why I think that's absolutely wonderful and so we're just going to enjoy what they have for us and we know that uh uh our scripture tells us in Isaiah 9 and6 that unto us a child was born and and he was a mighty God he was a counselor he is a prince of peace he's an everlasting father and we just have this day to celebrate that time of

prayer brother first of all we ask you to pray okay and then we will uh then we'll pray together okay before share little testimony as long as short okay thank you God bless the church I'm so sorry I had a procedure my procedure last week I may not be able to speak fluently so I want to share a testimony regarding this our baby from the day one when uh he was conceived like maybe 3 months when we went to see the doctor and the first day we went they did some test they said uh is a risk pregnancy what are we going to do like they didn't say it like a fav word they just asking us like like do you want to leave it they didn't mention that do you want to leave it but in their reaction you see you will notice that they asking you if you want to leave it or you want we agree that we are going to leave it like uh we started going they started referring us to different hospital my wife like every week we go to like two hospital they will do their scan the doctor will say they are seeing something and they cannot guarantee us they will send us to another uh hospital to go and do another scan there they will say they didn't see anything I I told my brother David and his precious wife they said they encourag us they said we should listen to what they tell you to do but we praying with you they started praying I told my pastor from Nigeria so we continue or when like the month that the baby is going to be delivered so she went for her final sh up to to scan the baby like the baby supposed to be delivered next week but the doctor said we should come like a week before that so the doctor said this baby is a RIS baby we need to bring her out so went for the final scan on the other side they said the baby is looking fine the baby is growing but this one say we don't think the baby is going to grow from the beginning okay I said okay we believe in God God is going to keep it for us we have agreed so our brother and our family keep on praying for us so that day we went to the doctor the doctor said you cannot go go home I said we not prepare to deliver this baby today he said no what we are seeing you cannot go home he said uh the flu level from on Friday was 12 but now is in 6 he said we need to refer you to the where the baby will be delivered just go there just go there they just do that scan and you from there you be going home from there we didn't go home we in the hospital I texed Pastor I saided BR Bing please pray for us and they said they will be praying and they have been praying I always text them and they have been praying for us I tell them my sister too he said listen to what they are going to say let them do their their work I said okay so the the one that b me most was I didn't believe it when they say a risk pregnancy I said what do they mean by risk so the day when uh the time when she want to deliver the baby they brought a document they said my wife should come and sign said what the document for he said we told you it's a risk pregnancy it's 50/50 is that you lose your like lose your baby or you lose your wife she need to sign do you have a will do you have something something that you want to give to somebody sign this document I said by faith you will sign it for you to carry your your work but from here my wife and my daughter will go home together so she signed de started decided everything within a few minutes the baby was delivered I think I than I thank the Lord I Thank The Lord and you know the funniest thing she's supposed to come on like 9 months she came a week before the day she supposed to

portion father as they dedicate this child to you today in the wonderful and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen [Applause] wonderful wonderful good things that God does I'll tell you that the the doctors will scare you to death if I guess you know they're supposed to make you well but they they'll scare you to no end and but anyway we're we're certainly uh wonderful for that we'd like to once again uh uh enjoy the children and like to thank brother Tim and sister Melinda and all what they do brother Tim uh takes care of our Sunday school and all the teachers and the helpers and and uh well just our trustees that uh help manage our finances and keep our books and do all the things that are necessary our deacons that uh without without them I couldn't uh carry on and and our musicians and uh all the people in the sound booth and our interpreters and all our young people helpers sister April and all those that help uh all that just takes all of us to do it and uh you know just [Music] alone if you want to call it that just the staff to keep this church up is in between everybody is is over is over 50 people so uh it it just takes everybody working together and we're really thankful but it wouldn't be uh wouldn't be necessary if wasn't for you and so each year lesie and I try to put out uh give everybody in the church a little gift and uh uh so we we try to give a calendar every year and I believe the calendars are in the back and uh so we like to give one calendar per household so for example if there's uh two or three brothers living in the same apartment one calendar it's not calendar per person is calendar for household if you live in a tent One calendar per tent if you live in a trailer One calendar per trailer if you live under the bridge One calendar for under the bridge so I I hope that uh uh uh we don't care where you live we're glad you're here but please take that gift uh from us and we we really appreciate that so uh we're just going to have a little message on my heart and uh uh uh if and so let us stand and we'll turn in our Bibles to uh St John oh okay uh yeah we wanted to uh share something with you this morning uh you have that picture can you put it up as you know uh brother Matthew and brother Darien have been in India uh preaching and it started out uh they started doing Zoom meetings uh over there with a few Brothers uh these are all Pentecostal preachers and it continued to grow until where they almost had 200 people uh zooming in and talking so they put together a little convention and had a a a several day service with these uh uh about 200 uh Pentecostal ministers and this is a picture of some of the 29 brothers that were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so uh and uh so uh they'll be starting their travels back home and I'm sure there's been many doors open there and and a work that the brothers have started that they'll continue to help these brothers grow and answer their questions and and prove that uh what what we serve is a living God with a word-based message so uh I just think that's one I know Matthew got a little food poisoning while he was over there and and we continue to trust that the Lord strengthens him so uh you know you're all a part of that you know so it it takes a body it takes a family and and and so uh each one of you will have a little a piece of that in your crown so let's turn to St John the 3r chapter in the 14th 15th 16th 17th verse probably the most memorized scripture in the Bible it says and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting ing life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved Heavenly Father we ask you to bless in your precious name we pray amen amen you may be seated I like uh uh having services with a theme you know I like preaching at Christmas and Thanksgiving and Easter and and things like that and so uh it's just nice to have a time uh to preach about something so I have a a a little uh uh thought uh it's it's it might start out depressing but just hold hold on there and and with it a little bit and I I hope it'll bless you uh brother Miguel nice to see you Paris brother many years been my friend come over and with us I guess this is the first time in our new building right amen so anyways be we had to make it bigger because you're singing bless so many people they just had to come so we appreciate it so very much you know at Christmas time A lot of times you know the emphasis is on gifts and and uh trying to find the perfect gift you know and uh so I I told in our family I said I I'll buy this but no no clothes I don't want no clothes this year you know so and uh I'll guarantee I'll get socks and but you know it it just after a while you just try to think of what is it really that you want or what do you need or where are you going to put it you know what I mean I don't uh I I'm every time I walk into my closet I realize this thing's got to be remodeled you know and I can't blame it all un Lesly she looked at me the other day and she Saidi never seen a man in the world with so many shoes well I don't throw my shoeses away I just pile them up and uh they're wore out they're beat up you know and what's ever the closest to slip into I slip into them and uh uh you know if one pairs full of mud I just put the different pair on and uh so you know you you always you just get to the place where I don't need anything but but you know God so loved us that he gave us a gift and so I'd like to preach a a sermon to um this morning and the title of it is a gift for every weakness a gift for every weakness and we uh we're born in in this world and uh we know the scriptures tells us that we're born in sin shaped into iniquity come into the world speaking lies and uh but yet our opinion of ourselves is pretty high uh if you were to ask yourself to write a resume of yourself uh you would immediately go into all the character istics of yourself that you uh thought were important if you go to do a job interview you give a resounding review of yourself and your abilities I can do this I can do that I'm I'm good I'm this but you know man has done a lot of studies and found out that Human Nature has lots of weaknesses now we know that we have characteristics of human beings that uh one is that we seek shelter and we she seek companionship and we want to uh uh we want to advance and we want to make life easier on ourselves and and these are are great uh characteristics we want to multiply uh those those are things that are common to human beings no matter where they are in the world uh they they there certain characteristics that they they list in the characteristics the anatomy of human beings the physical characteristics of how our limbs work and how we walk upright and then our social characteristics how that we're communal uh people and uh we strive to work together but we learn uh that's another characteristics and we learn and so those are characteristics but along with our humanism we we got a nature and our our our human nature though it has many great positive uh characteristics many good incentives and good intentions our our nature itself is kind of has some flaws in it and a lot of times we think of gifts when we talk about gifts or we think of abilities you know what I mean this person's gifted and so we think of their abilities or we think of tools you know what I mean something that will help us do something but I wanted to call call this a gift for every weakness and uh so you know we we find out even though we we we seem to do good within ourselves we have weaknesses and our weaknesses hurt us and our enemies seek to take advantage of our weakness that's what you does even our messenger told us when you're you're in a battle or you're in a fight you look for that weakness and he said every one of us has weaknesses and the enemy's got a a something coming against us uh uh but he said uh uh you know we've got to cover that weakness and so we we think in our nature and we think of our our thing and and even though we kind of look at gifts uh things but I thought and we know that the greatest gift that was given to us was the love of God God so loved the world he gave us his only begotten son and it and this gift is a gift for everything and so just to go over a little bit I want to talk a little bit this morning about our weakness and not just one weakness they have over they've listed over 50 or 60 weaknesses in the human being and I want to say this morning that we have a gift for every weakness for every weakness and I'll just start listing uh going through the list and I'm sure none of this applies to any of you here so we're certainly talking about all those sinner Devils out out there right but we're we're in here we're all Angels right and and uh we we really have need of nothing right I mean uh you know the fact that it says we're blind miserable naked wretched and have need of nothing that certainly doesn't mean me which is one of our weaknesses let's just talk about our weaknesses and as you do this I I want you to think of what's on my heart this morning a gift for every weakness okay every Avenue that that Satan can get to you everything about yourself that hurts you everything about yourself the weaknesses that you have that hurt you that keep you from going forward that keep you from so many things and Rob us of so much life and joy and I'll just go through some of these lists that that different authors and have have have listed and each one of them has a different thing but I think they're all great it says this person here puts the first list on man's weakness is being cowardliness you know to be cowardly you know he says it's it's a weakness you know uh where you you are gripped by fear and a failure to want to Prevail or or stand up or or have any toughness you know sometimes we call it it being spineless or having no backbone or having no conviction you you you know what I mean not wanting to uh to just uh face it up that that that's a weakness that we have is human beings were our nature the nature that we received when we were born and came into this world in the very nature that we possess has within us a weakness of being coward cowardly and and that's why when someone goes and has Valor it it's it it's such stands out that it it's recognized because they overcame a weakness now it's given to us to be Overcomers and and that's our portion and and we need help overcoming another uh weakness that man has is uh uh is selfishness you know uh that great uh thing about you know I guess it starts real early with children you'll have a room full of toys and one child will be playing with one toy and some you'll be across the whole other room playing with a different twin that kid will get up and run across the room and say that's mine to be selfish you know to make sure that you've got what you need you know what I mean uh the lack of ability to share to be selfish that's built in our nature we we we we get that we didn't ask for it uh you know I didn't ask to be born I didn't make an arrangement with my parents and said I'd like to be born on October 27th 1949 and uh I I would like to you know I'd like to have nice head of hair all my life no I I picked up the natural characteristics of my parents be through their genes and and I picked up the human nature that comes with being a human being and in picking up those Natures I pick up these weaknesses and these weaknesses have hurt me personally over the years and and so it it selfishness is one of the weakness you know apathy you know built in our characteristics uh you know to reject or or or or disapprove or have contempt of others you know it's a it's a human nature apathy it is one of the human Natures that we have I I thought this one was put on the list and I thought why you know this should have been number number one lack of concentration to pay attention you know what I mean to gather up the details you know you know just to take the time when someone tells you your name just to take the concentration to catch it now you know that's my weakness and and I have a real good excuse for it but I want to say this morning that there's a gift for every weakness and and and so you know just the uh you know to uh and and the thing who happens is these things hurt us and we use them for excuses and and you know and that's why when the great message was preach perfect strength and perfect weakness we start using our weak weaknesses as excuses and there's no need for them to be excuses because we have a gift for every weakness and and so you know a distrust is another great weakness that our Nature has just in our nature our nature distrust impatience I know none of you suffer any of these Envy you know resentment these are just some of the things that uh are are listed dependency you you know where where uh we we don't want to fear for ourselves we want to depend on others and and we uh uh and a lot of times that weaknesses causes for disappointment you know people will let you down you know uh i i attended I've attended several uh uh AAA meetings and not because I was an alcoholic but I had loved ones and encouraging them to go you know a lot of people they don't like uh uh oh they'll they'll have an opinion or an attitude towards something that helps people if someone's somebody's going to help somebody to overcome alcoholism I'm all for it you understand it don't take God out of their life I encourage every person to do all that you can to overcome but also I want you to understand that there's a gift for every weakness and and I believe Matthew brought that out so well last time he preached when with alcoholism the first thing they want to convince you is once an alcoholic always an alcoholic if you're an alcoholic you will always be an alcoholic well that's because that's a weakness but we've got a gift for every weakness amen amen and then this person list on his list at number 10 is stubbornness is one of the biggest human weaknesses that there is just being stubborn and uh you know uh that is uh I don't know if stubbornness has hurt any of you but it's hurt me a lot of time you know especially in in work you know you want to do something certain way and you're going to fight it and you're going to force it and you're going to make it work even though it wasn't designed to work you will reinvent it you will take it apart you'll refix it you'll get it to where it work because you're just that stubborn and and stubborn's a weakness in in our nature well even his children will pucker that lip up and you know know and uh I I saw a couple grandkids giv some grandparents the fits the other day and and the kid wanted the most ridiculous thing you know what I mean and and I thought in my heart I thought you know what there's a gift for that kind of stubbornness and it's wrapped around my waist there is a gift for every weakness and chastisement sometimes a great thing and those are some of the ones that are common to us but there's other sometimes within ourselves is hidden weaknesses that are are hard to be identified and I thought some of these were were Were Striking and and I I hope that you understand that my emphasis isn't on the weakness the emphasis is on the fact that we have a gift for every one of those weaknesses what God's given us no matter what came with our nature this gift that God has given us can is is for every weakness you've God and but I thought this was a a a great weakness fantasy you you know giant thoughts and little actions you know living in a dream world you know a fantasy I I've worked with lots of guys that I I'll tell you their work ethic was a fantasy cuz at the end of the day they ain't done nothing you know what I mean but they think they're moving the Earth you you understand it's a weakness it's not to be able to perceive the reality around you to be living in a fog to to uh imagine things that that are are there imagination becomes a weakness uh uh to men uh you know I I I went through a terrible time in my life where I just thought everybody was thinking about me you know what I mean everybody was out to get me and it was a big a great big gigantic conspiracy the only people I believe that's true with is the City of Bedford other than that uh uh it you just it it it is just something that that you you go through it it's a weakness that you have and there can you imagine there's a gift for that when you find your mind spinning off into things God's got a gift for that it's beautiful negativity you know withdrawal from reality and avoidance you're letting that negativity create in you that you'll avoid certain people you'll avoid certain things you'll avoid certain tasks you just get overwhelmed with negativity and you know one of the things our our messenger even taught us he said never never never never never never have a negative thought negativity is a weakness that it it hurts you and and just think these weaknesses that no wonder he said the day that you eat thereof is the day you die not not only did the good qualities but the the fact that man Adam walked out he was positive every morning the sun rose if he wanted to move the sun two degrees he moved the sun two degrees he named the animals he did the you think there was negativity in his life no he didn't even know what negativity was but when that when his nature changed then these things begin to come up these weaknesses be begin to arrive in in our nature and we were born with them not we didn't have a CH choice to pick our characteristics and we didn't have a choice to pick the negativities and the weaknesses that come with our natures and and negativity is is uh uh uh one of the great things conceit the the definition that he puts here I thought was pretty thing he says conceit the self-expansion of the ignorant you know when you you you you think of that you know another one a weakness being sloppy nobody's sloppy right you know uh making hasty decisions without proper consider consideration leading to regrets and sometimes irreversible consequences sloppiness becomes a root cause of my setbacks in life being sloppy you know not giving due diligence not you know making decisions sloppy decisions you know and and th th th th that thing we think of sloppiness is well you know you don't tie your shoe you don't you know you don't tuck in your shirt that's sure that's exactly amounts to all of it because if you have a sloppy appearance and someone you know sees those things then it creates an atmosphere around you and it's hurting you it it it it shows there's no consideration you know one time I was late and like my I I told my dad I'm sorry I'm late he says oh it's just because you're selfish I thought what do you mean yeah he says that's just sloppy living you know and I I I I didn't you know and then I come to to learn he was counting on me being there I I didn't make a decision you know what I mean because I thought I could be sloppy because it's my dad but because it was my dad I should have been even more diligent but these weaknesses and the thing about it is if there's a gift for that weakness then when wouldn't it be wise for our own self-interest to make contact with that gift and to let that gift work if if you have a tool you you know have you ever had a bolt that you you took a pair of channellocks to until it was totally rounded off and all you would have to done is went and got the end wrench that fited no what stubbornness sets in and self-will sets in and and conceit sets in and ego sets in and and you're going to get that thing off and if it won't come off you'll just go get a a reciprocator saw a sawsa and it's just because it's sloppy sloppiness is a real problem of a church they don't care about the time they don't care about anybody else and you think well who does it hurt it hurts you it hurts you it hurts your testimony let me ask you if if there was an appointed time for the Rapture 10 a.m. next Sunday morning the Rapture would take place how many of you wander on in here about 10:30 you wouldn't do it you wouldn't do it I mean you're not late to work and let me tell you what work does for you it makes you tired it makes you sore and it makes you old and you'll be on time for that Pronto but something that gives you life see we don't we we don't understand that if if there wasn't a gift for every weakness then we would have an excuse you understand but now here's a gift that God has given for every human weakness that we've got we didn't ask for the weakness but but yet he gave us the gift anyway he so loved us see I want you to look at the gift different not a gift of something that's future oh salvation one day I'll be saved no that's not what the gift is the gift is a gift for every weakness that you have this morning warning it's for your weaknesses it's not for your strength it's the sick that need the physician spiritually sick personality sick nature sick total disregard for any of the reality living in fantasy sloppy living arrogance you know having little little knowledge of something and acting like you know it all self-perception do you know you know it just it the Dignity of of not being supportive you know okay just I don't need anybody blind miserable wretched naked have need of nothing arrogance says I don't need help because I don't have any weaknesses now if you think I had a weakness that's your problem it's because of you you it's not because of me my name is St David no the the the you say why are you saying this I don't want to depress you but if if you have a gift for that God's God's given this this little type we have here of this little baby that came in this manger he he didn't come to just to save you what is he saving you from he's saving you from yourself he's saving you from the nature that'll destroy you he's saving you from the weaknesses that deprive you of blessings and life and goodness and joy and peace and patience he came with a gift for every weakness you've got think of it it's beautiful that that's the you know doubtfulness you know just you know just doubting that you can't nothing can happen good for you doubt we call it unbelief it's a human weakness it's a weakness that you just won't you set a limit and and you build a wall around yourself and you just can't believe past it pretty soon you can't believe God can do something for you you can't believe the impossible you can't have a dream you you can't you can't expect that there be any blessings come your way you just live in a world of of of Doubt Doubt's terrible D doubt is poison doubt is the break of life it's the stop sign of life you got to have faith to move from where you are to something else you have to have faith in this message this morning that this message is of God and that God is trying to reach out for you and say yeah you might possess this weakness you might possess some of these characteristics but I am the gift for that weakness don't hold on to it and don't let it hold on to you don't let it keep you back all things are possible he said as many as believe I give them power to become the Sons and Daughters of God self self-absorption totally absorbed with self you know how does my hair look I put enough polish on it you know I mean you know you look Thor looking in the mirror I mean it's absorbed with self all caught up with what people think what do people think what do people think of me you know how am I doing you you know what I mean cuz everything else like my goodness you know I it just it sometimes it's just uh you know you know what self the does it draws a circle self absortion doesn't let you draw a bigger Circle it drives draws a circle and puts everybody else out you're absorbing with what you believe there's people that are so anti- Christmas they're absorbed with their little religious Christmas deal you you know what I mean they're they're against Christmas they're against Christmas trees they're against you know putting a a penny in the little bucket or giving Toys for Tots you know what I mean they think that that's all paganism no self absortion is paganism it's the worship of self little 11 said to Grandma I said Grandma Santa Claus is real I see him everywhere you know it doesn't hurt you Paul people would think that people had Christmas trees that you wouldn't even believe who had had Christmas trees we don't that we don't have a Christmas tree but it's not because of a thing is our family that down and made a family decision that we'd like to have a nativity scene if you got a Christmas tree I love Christmas trees I love them it's beautiful it's beautiful to decorate them it's not an idol your the idol that tree don't have no weakness it smells good and if there happens to be something under it for you well how much more would you like it you know the family's got ways of doing things you know that that's self absortion it if you get into your mind you're thinking it it kills you paranoia paranoia afraid of everything afraid of what's going to influence you afraid of what's going to be done to you afraid of if you're going to lose all your money afraid of this you know another uh thing is you know extravagance it's a weak Ness you know what allows you to be extravagant is a credit card a credit card is the most unreflected reality of where you really are can you afford this no but this plastic can the avoidance of the Day of Reckoning oh I don't have to pay this yeah me and Les say when we first got married we we we bought a refrigerator from Sears well we just figured it out we would have paid that refrigerator off about now because they would let you give you a129 a month 25 years and you pay that refrigerator off and that refrigerator cost you1 14,000 but it was just a129 and you can afford that that's extravagance living outside your means it's a weakness and the scripture says that to be content in whatever state you're in don't let credit take you out of the state that you're in don't spend what you don't have you're hurting yourself and that's going to cause you to make decisions that aren't good decisions I told you this might get a little depressing but praise God there's a gift for it he's got a gift to take that burden of extravagance away from you that burden of I got to have I've got to have I want this I want that I need this you don't need nothing we know what we all need we need to pray and read our Bible and pray for Revelation he's got a gift for every one of these weaknesses I'm just hold on I'll get to yours I know you're all like that lady said he hadn't touched me yet paranoia greed undisciplined nah not here jealousy stubbornness this one is kind they it it's light promises and little faith in other words making promises lightly and lack of commitment to fulfill them you want to know the number one example of that I'll pray for you man I just had a wreck you know and and my my car is total oh I'll pray for you not what the scripture said they said go go the extra mile your car wreck you don't have a car do you need a car you need to borrow a car can I help you rent a car you say well I don't have any money to help you to rent a car well you know something maybe God just bring something your way to help them rent a car let me tell you a secret about God you can out give God you can't give and not have it rewarded a hundred times in this life you give your time you give your effort it will be rewarded it you just can't outg give God but if you're selfish if you're paranoid about your bills if you're paranoid about this if you're paranoid about your future you're paranoid about your existence you want to live above your means all these weaknesses you understand create a fragile human being that really no longer is able to really reflect Jesus Christ in his fullness but the gift of God is if you could believe that he's a gift for every weakness he will make you to become the Sons and Daughters of God and then you'll say to this mountain be moved you know we don't need to make light promises publicity you know you know politics publicity what people think I got to watch what I say because of what people think I got to say what what effect you know you got longterm reasons you know my if I go if I go over with brother Billy they're going to think I believe the way brother Billy believes and and I I can't go to that church because they'll align me with this church in all the years that I've been the pastor has anybody ever heard me tell anybody not to go to somebody's church or not to listen to him it don't matter you know why because the bride can't be deceived the elect can't be deceived if you're paranoid I don't care what meeting you go to I don't care what you listen to I I I don't care if somebody feeds you and and they're their Pastor I don't care if you come in here and and sit you don't have to pay your ties to sit here the gospel was freely given so we freely give it you know we're we're not worried about publicity we're not worried about what people think or what people say we're interested in one thing Lord I've got weaknesses my weaknesses are hurting me I've got complexes they're hurting me they're keeping me from enjoying the kingdom of God they're keeping me me from enjoying my brothers and sisters they're keeping me from having freedom and peace and longsuffering and patience and godliness and kindness Lord I need something I need a gift that'll take care of the weakness he's everything that we have need of vanity Love of Money impulsive one of my greatest characteristics quick to judge quick to speak quick to get caught off by something just impulsive goes back to sloppiness it goes back to these things there's a gift for impulsiveness there's a gift you know for those that can't walk by the you know you know why they put all those little candies and those candy bars and all them stupid little stuff around the register Tinker Toys and it don't matter what it is because people have compulsion as a weakness they can't control their reaction they've just got to have one of those curiosity you know it just they're impulsive grab this grab that we get we don't even these are weaknesses that we've learned to grow with and I hope you understand that God I I tried to say is this is the time that there's a transformation going on in The Believer amen that she's not fitting into the puzzle of human weaknesses and of human nature and of what Society does you know what with they've got for all these weaknesses they've got psychologist and they've got psychiatrists but praise God we've got the Holy Ghost AM we don't we we we can overcome these things blind obedience just think of that you say what is that that's going with the trend something's in style at school you'll wear it whether it's comfortable or not you may not even like it it may not even look good on you but it's the trend it's the style it's the fashion everybody likes a certain music some guy becomes famous you know everybody's flocking over some guy I forget what his name was I thought what is a real guy I couldn't stand one of his songs you know it's a human weakness blind obedience glowing with the crowd glowing with the trend not not going back and thinking it over there's a gift for that that hurts you what other people think hurts you not being able to go forward and and and and being paranoid and and all these things these are things that hurt you do you understand that and if it's hurting you the scripture says it hurts the whole body because when one member of the body suffers the whole body suffers together and it's given to us you get a bad attitude you know what the scripture says A little leaven leavens the whole lump you come in and sit down on the preacher and and get all huffed up don't think that he don't know it don't think that he don't see it if he's anointed he sees it he can call it out but you want God to deal with the heart you want God to bring the conviction you know we don't measure skirts because we want the Holy Spirit to convict you we don't measure how tight they are we preach against tight skirts we preach pre against high heels we preach against makeup we preach against jewelry we preach against cutting your hair but we don't have a rule for it why because we want the spirit of God if you're caught up with glamour if you're caught up with publicity you're caught up with how you you look it's more important what people think of you let me tell you there is a gift for that weakness this morning there's a gift for every weakness that we have as human beings there's a Divine gift for it hallelujah thank you for Christmas I thought this was an amazing self elimination killing your subconscious abilities people eliminate themselves you know that little voice that talks to you on the inside the one that puts you under conviction the one that says you know better or you should do this people eliminate that they don't want their conscience talking to them you know the scripture says you turn your back on God he snares your conscience with a hot iron don't eliminate that in your life it's not it's not bad to argue with yourself but people are self-eliminating themselves complexes negativity all these things we list this whole list of weakness as we're going through you understand they're limiting you they're they're they're dissolving what that you really are why do you think Satan wanted to inject his nature into your lives cuz that's the only way that you can get he could get to you because he's the father of lies and there's no truth in in him and every one of these weaknesses is a lie of the devil they are not what Sons and Daughters of God possess amen and that's why he came I'm only I number 24 and I don't want to look in them here I want to look right over here from whence my help comes from to where my victory is over every weakness where my victory is over every fear and every doubt and every LIE there's a gift I thought this was strange they call it fluke you know when people say well that's a fluke it's the Indulgence of self deception deceiving yourself can you imagine that's one of our human weaknesses you know just I mean you think about it you know you you you you you you you eliminate your conscience and and then you indulge in self-deception you know and then what follows stuff like that is is uh retaliation that's a human weakness to think that you got to retaliate for everything everything's got to be tit fortat that's what Jesus said it was said before I say you an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth he says I I say unto you do unto others because you'd have them do unto you serve god with your whole heart your whole mind your whole strength and love your neighbor as yourself the beauty of the Gospel the understanding of the gift this morning you understand the gift was for your weakness it's a gift for every weakness you can't use your excuses you can't live an un Christlike life you you can't live powerless because of your weaknesses my strength is made perfect in weakness his strength is made perfect in every one of these weaknesses his gift overcomes and his strength is made perfect in weakness am am I clear this morning do you understand really what's been given to us I hope you love them and appreciate them more a fluke you know that and this is another one here is the the the idea that everything has to be perfect you know what I mean just you know everything's got to be perfect everything's got to be exactly right you know what that leads to it leads to low self-esteem I'm not perfect I'm no good I can't get everything just right I'm worthless that devil needs to take a hike who is your Perfection your righteousness is is what fil fth y Rags but who is our righteousness amen we have a gift that takes care of that I don't have to be perfect he's perfect if I accept his gift and and I let his gift take tackle every single one of my weaknesses you know loss of goals nobody has anything to live for you know just I'll just read a whole list real fast again impatience egoism jealousy cowardness uh uh Conformity with ignorance uh resentment dependency little openness to new experience es or new thoughts closed-mindedness controlling attitude towards other you know excess is ego poor anger management lack of ambition arrogance lack of listening Prejudice uh F fality you know when someone's frivolous making big deals out of little things you know self Shame Shame linked to one's identity low self-esteem laziness apathy uh uh cynicism you know cynicism is being satisfied with one's own mistakes therefore you're cynical of every everybody it's it's a cruelty extreme Pride excessive ambition inconsistency Rebellion hostility lack of initi initiative carelessness self-indulgence lack of motivation tendency to set unrealistic goals lack of concentration excess of concerned about everything fear of fear lack of imagination lack of faith lack of creativity all these things that we went through are all things that our human nature gave us we didn't ask for him we were borned with them we were borned with these weaknesses they're the weaknesses of our nature do you understand that these are weaknesses of our nature Jesus was tempted by every single one of these weaknesses but he overcame he learned obedience by the things he suffered what do you think the things that he suffered was it was the weaknesses it was every single one of these weaknesses the weakness to be sloppy the weakness to be inconsistent all those things were the things that he was tempted with you ever wondered that what he was tempted with nature he was tempted with human nature he was born in sin but was sinless he became sin he took on the nature of man he became weak so we could become strong he became us so we could become him it's the greatest gift that was ever given was the gift for every single one of our weaknesses hallelujah what did he give us he gave us the opportunity to have a new nature to be born again and not carry all these attitudes all these weaknesses into our decision making amen but to be led for the Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son herein is the love of God made perfect as he is so are we in this world think of it quit making excuses quit Bo your neck quit having an ugly attitude quit thinking that you're worth something and you got to get paid every dime for everything you do we're worth nothing it's the grace of God the more you give the more God gives to you the more you love the more love you'll have don't worry about yourself you've got somebody worrying for you I will not leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you till the end oh thank you Lord I'm a mess I'm I'm just a mess I'm guilty of every single thing that was read here I have I have every one of these is my disease cuz my disease is human nature but you realize you can be borned again and if these things start to pop up he's got the gift for that if I were to read the fruits of the spirit if I was to read the gift just the fruits of the spirit alone begin to wipe all those things clear when you live for others all these weaknesses is self it's the human nature it's the human characteristic but we had a gift that came he says I'm going to pay the price for all the heartache trouble that these human weaknesses have caused I'm not going to lay any of it to your charge why lay it to your own charge if he's not going to lay it for your charge why let any one of these weaknesses be an excuse for you to live a lesser life than God wants you to live why let a weakness keep the joy of the spirit of God out of your heart why let all these weaknesses keep you from loving and living for other people I've never in my life I'll testify to the Lord I've never in my life given my last dollar that I hadn't had dollars to take its place my father owns the cattle on a thousand hills no we're not self-made we're made by his grace by his mercy and his love there's no success Among Us one being more successful and the other you want to know what success is success is overcoming there's people that got millions of dollars who are possessed every single one of these demons we don't even measure that way we don't live there we're living because we've been offered a new nature we've been
