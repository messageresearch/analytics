[27:52] in your bibles to matthew the
[27:55] 26th chapter
[27:58] you know we certainly
[28:00] want to encourage everybody that can to
[28:02] come out
[28:04] to the services of
[28:06] friday uh saturday night and
[28:10] and sunday morning don't be afraid that
[28:12] you won't have a seat
[28:14] uh
[28:14] we'll squeeze in another row of chairs
[28:17] if we have to and
[28:19] we'll put some more seats up here
[28:22] for some
[28:23] uh ministers to sit in if we have to and
[28:26] we'll open my office up if we have to
[28:29] and we'll sit in the foyer if you have
[28:31] to
[28:32] and we'll sit and overflow if you have
[28:34] to and
[28:35] and we'll do everything we have to
[28:39] right
[28:40] but i want to be here because something
[28:42] wonderful might happen amen so we
[28:46] certainly want to do that but we're just
[28:49] going to just go straight to communion
[28:51] service
[28:53] a little different i sometimes we um
[28:57] everything gets in a routine
[29:00] and
[29:01] sometimes maybe just to see that we have
[29:03] some liberty
[29:05] we also want you to pray about
[29:10] maybe
[29:11] having some sunday school classes
[29:14] on
[29:17] on sunday evening
[29:19] i know that a lot of the children may
[29:21] not be able to make it but for those
[29:23] that can
[29:24] we're just praying about
[29:27] the i talked to the brothers and they're
[29:29] willing to
[29:30] tear down the back and set it up for
[29:34] some classrooms maybe we won't have as
[29:36] many classes
[29:37] as but we might just have two classes
[29:40] back there but we want to do something i
[29:43] that's been the biggest burden on me and
[29:46] the biggest press to
[29:48] try to
[29:52] get something built for us
[29:55] as quick as possible and then pretty
[29:58] soon here we'll find out exactly what
[30:01] we'll do and and then we'll put it
[30:04] to a vote of the whole congregation to
[30:06] see if they want us to go
[30:08] forward with building if you feel like
[30:12] you want it the responsibility that's
[30:15] going to take
[30:16] the financial side of it and everything
[30:19] because we surely want your
[30:21] will in everything that we do amen
[30:24] so anyway pray pray about
[30:26] sunday school and those of you that
[30:29] might consider to be a teacher
[30:31] or
[30:32] would like to do that and helpers as
[30:35] many as that were there before we'd sure
[30:37] welcome everybody back and let's just
[30:39] trust that the lord will be able to
[30:41] have us do something and then pretty
[30:44] soon
[30:46] by the grace of god we'll
[30:48] probably have a change within the next
[30:50] year so
[30:52] all the building permits have been filed
[30:58] they're reviewing
[31:00] the plans for the
[31:02] building part for the first time they're
[31:05] reviewing the plans for the civil
[31:08] drawings for like the seventh time
[31:11] so i don't know if they can find
[31:13] anything else but
[31:15] i guess they just like to stick to their
[31:17] routine
[31:18] i'm not much one for routine
[31:21] you know and i mean i'd like to flap the
[31:24] wings on the eagle's nest
[31:27] you know what i mean i like people to
[31:29] be put in the situation they're either
[31:31] for you or against you
[31:33] and
[31:34] so
[31:36] we're grateful for it i'm really looking
[31:38] forward to the lord to do wonderful
[31:40] things but i i don't know if they're
[31:42] going to delay us
[31:44] past the 10th now that
[31:47] they said the city council has to
[31:49] approve it
[31:50] uh earlier before they told me they
[31:52] didn't but i guess they've had it
[31:54] maybe a change of mind but that's okay
[31:57] if if if not it'll be a little bit but
[32:00] if we can work we should be able to
[32:03] start if the first approval goes through
[32:06] by the first of march
[32:08] if not if they make us wait till after
[32:10] the 10th then it should be after the
[32:12] 10th but
[32:14] so
[32:15] i have a construction meeting
[32:18] planned that the subcontractors and i'll
[32:20] be at
[32:21] and
[32:22] we'll figure out what they want to do
[32:24] huh so let us pray but now we can have
[32:27] communion
[32:29] so that always brings comfort
[32:32] doesn't it when you can walk with the
[32:34] lord
[32:35] you can come take communion remembering
[32:38] what he did for you
[32:40] and you can lay your petition
[32:42] so communion's a time to lay your
[32:44] petition to the lord there's healing in
[32:47] communion
[32:48] there's victory and communion so as you
[32:51] have come take communion tonight come
[32:54] with something on your heart that you
[32:56] would like the lord to do for you
[32:58] or or maybe something you want to do for
[33:01] him
[33:02] and you'd like him to give you
[33:04] leadership and guidance in it but just
[33:07] don't come to take communion tonight
[33:10] with nothing in your hand to bring
[33:14] so bring it bring it to heart's desire
[33:16] bring a request bring somebody maybe
[33:19] that you have a burden for
[33:22] bring it to communion tonight commune
[33:24] with the lord let him know you're here
[33:27] because you're remembering what price he
[33:29] paid for you
[33:31] and that in this great work there's many
[33:33] things that god can do so let's turn to
[33:36] the
[33:42] 14th
[33:44] verse of the 26th chapter
[33:47] of matthew the first recorded pure
[33:49] communion
[33:51] and it said
[33:52] then one of the 12
[33:55] called judas iscariot
[33:58] went into
[33:59] the chief priest
[34:02] and said unto them
[34:04] what will ye give me
[34:07] and i will deliver him unto you
[34:12] and they
[34:14] convened it
[34:16] with him
[34:17] for 30 pieces of silver
[34:21] and from that time he sought opportunity
[34:25] to betray him
[34:27] now can you just imagine that
[34:30] for the whole time
[34:32] they sought opportunity
[34:34] to betray him
[34:36] i i wonder what that was like
[34:40] and now
[34:41] the first day of the feast of unleavened
[34:45] bread the disciples came to jesus
[34:48] saying unto him
[34:50] where will
[34:51] thou that we prepare
[34:54] for thee
[34:55] to eat the passover
[34:58] and he said go into the city
[35:01] to such a man
[35:03] and say
[35:05] unto him
[35:06] the master said
[35:09] my time is at hand
[35:11] i will keep the passover at thy house
[35:15] with my disciples
[35:18] and the disciples did as jesus had
[35:21] appointed them
[35:23] and they made ready the passover
[35:26] now when the evil was come
[35:29] he sat down with the twelve
[35:32] and as they did eat
[35:35] he verily
[35:37] i say unto you
[35:39] that one of you shall betray me
[35:42] and they were exceedingly sorrowful
[35:45] and beginned every one of them to say
[35:48] unto him
[35:50] lord is it i
[35:53] now i just want you to take a look at
[35:55] that jesus knew what judas was
[35:58] i mean this this was him discerning
[36:02] and just letting him know
[36:04] i know
[36:05] you know so and they were exceedingly
[36:08] sorrowful and begin every one of them to
[36:10] say to him lord is it i
[36:13] and he answered and said he that dippeth
[36:16] his hand with me
[36:18] in the dish is the same shall betray me
[36:21] the son of man goeth as it is written of
[36:25] him but woe unto that man
[36:28] by whom the son of man is betrayed
[36:31] it had been good for that man
[36:34] if he had not been born
[36:37] then judas which betrayed him answered
[36:40] and said
[36:41] master is it i
[36:44] and he said unto him thou
[36:46] hath said
[36:48] and as they were eating jesus took bread
[36:51] and blessed it and break it and gave it
[36:54] to the disciples and said take eat this
[36:58] is my body
[37:00] and he took the cup
[37:01] and gave thanks
[37:03] and gave it to them saying drink ye all
[37:06] of it for this is my blood
[37:10] of the new testament
[37:12] which is shed for many
[37:14] for the remission of sins
[37:17] but i say unto you i will not drink
[37:21] therefore of this fruit
[37:23] of the vine until that day when i drink
[37:27] it anew
[37:28] with you
[37:29] in my father's house
[37:32] and when they had sung a hymn they went
[37:35] out unto the mount of olives let us pray
[37:39] brothers
[37:48] our gracious heavenly father
[37:51] lord we have here
[37:54] the bread father that
[37:58] represents father the bread of life
[38:02] father that your words is truly
[38:05] meat for the
[38:07] inner man and for the soul
[38:09] and father even meat for our natural
[38:11] life because there is healing
[38:13] by your stripes we are healed
[38:16] father we just ask you to bless it to us
[38:18] for this communion this evening that we
[38:21] are taking father we're fulfilling your
[38:23] commandment and your example because
[38:26] you've certainly give us
[38:27] an example
[38:29] and father also the cup
[38:31] father of the wine lord which we know
[38:35] represents the life
[38:37] that you return back unto the believer
[38:40] father and that
[38:41] is the cleansing of our sins and all
[38:45] that you've done for us lord god it's
[38:47] just such a wonderful
[38:49] realization that there's someone so
[38:51] supernatural
[38:53] and so powerful cares for us
[38:56] just mere mortals father
