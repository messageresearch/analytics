Description:
Unused Promises
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 11th, 2026
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Brother Tim Sal, if we could just come and open our service in prayer, determination this morning, the psalmist David said, "This is the day the Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. &gt;&gt; And I had my version of that. I say, I'm determined to rejoice and be glad in it. Let's head. Gracious Lord, we thank you for the gathering this morning, Lord. We're able to lift up our voices in unison and say, "Praise be the name of the Lord." Lord, we welcome you in our midst. We know where you come, Lord, the supernatural, almighty, allsufficient heavenly father. Lord, there's nothing that would be out of your control, out of your doing, Lord. We pray that we can just yield to that spirit this morning, Lord. And may you just have preeminence in our midst this morning, Lord, as we sing the songs of praise and worship, Lord. May the just the effects of this sinful world just fall off of these cleaned up, sanctified bodies, Lord. May we enter into true fellowship and communion with our heavenly father. Lord, whatever needs we have, we just lay them at your altar this morning, Lord, knowing that you will answer each, Lord, as you see fit, Lord. But the persecutions, the trials, the troubles that come, Lord, they're for our benefit. David said, "He hath chasened me sore, but he hadn't given me over to death." We're thankful, Lord, that you have a means of preserving life in each one of us. Lord, even when these bodies fail, Lord, we look to to you that's within us. We lift up your name today, Lord. Ask that you just use us, Lord, as a body as you for your honor and glory as you see fit, Lord, and the ministry that comes forth, Lord. May he just be able to sense that the ground is prepared and ready for the word of God's seed that's going to fall in fertile ground this morning. Lord, we pray for those that couldn't be here, the sick, the needy, all things. Lord, we just commit them into your hands for your honor and glory. We ask all these things in the blessed name of our heavenly father, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning.

Once my heart was astray from that head finely way and was wretched and vow as could be. But my Savior above gave me peace, joy, and love when he reached down his hand for me. Oh, when he reached down his head for me. Oh, he had to reach way down for me. Oh, I was lost and undone without God. Oh, his son. when he reached down his hand for me and I was near rein when he came to me there and he showed me that I could be free. Oh, that he lifted my feet glory complete. Oh, when he reached down his hand for me. Oh, and he reached down his hand for me. Oh, I know he reached way down for me. Oh, I was lost and done without God. Oh, his son and he reached down his hand for me. Oh, how my heart does rejoice since I made him my choice. And from the tempest to heaven, now I free. Oh, now I need all this. I'm secure from all. Oh, he reached down his hand for me. Oh, and he reached down his hand for me. Oh, he had a reach way down for me. And I was lost and undone without your holy son. Oh, when he reaches down his hand. for me. Oh, says the Lord, gave me peace. Oh, heavenly joys, they never cease. And Lord, I give all my life unto thee. Oh God, my feet, oh my head, bread with thee that I may stand. Then he reached down his hand for me. Oh, when he reached down his hand for me, he had to reach way down for me. Oh, I will lost and undone without his son. When he reached down his hand for me, he said that I could still go free. Now tell me, what kind of a man would reach down his head? Oh, and do this for me. For me. Oh, I'm so oh unworthy to live. Oh, and I f my name in his will. He said that I I could still go free. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. How many can say this morning, I've been touched? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We're certainly thankful for that. We got a couple of requests we want to bring before the church at this time, man. Brother Stephen writes a testimony. It says, "I want to thank the Lord for uh my wife's birthday yesterday. I pray that God's presence be with her and the family always." Amen. Certainly thank the Lord for that. Amen. Also, brother uh uh David King writes, "I just want to thank the Lord for his victory over the sickness that that was bothering my sister Naomi. We certainly thank the Lord for his uh healing hands. Amen. They could certainly come and touch our sister. Amen. Uh Sister Abigail writes, "Uh God bless you all. I want to ask for prayer for my mom. She's a homesick with allergies that have been bothering her uh for over a week and uh she hasn't been able to properly breathe and asking for a healing touch in our bodies." Amen. We could certainly take it to the Lord and and know that it is a prayer answering God. Amen. Brother Emanuel has an unspoken request I'd like to be remembered for this morning. Want to take it before the Lord. Also from brother Steven again he writes uh uh praying for journey and the mercies as as I travel to South Africa on on Tuesday uh the 13th of January. Certainly want to uh keep our brother in prayer uh for traveling mercies. Amen. And brother Caleb writes, "God bless you, saints. Uh, the Kubaluca families are asking for prayers as Sister Jeannie was admitted to the hospital last night uh with signs of a stroke and the doctors uh noted the blood pressure spike and uh and it has gone down overnight. And once again, keep us in prayer." Amen. I believe we can certainly lift our sister up. I'll tell you this. But Bam says it's in the hour of need that Jesus comes. He He's never forsaken us. And there's nothing that we can ask that he hasn't already done. Amen. It's it's in our need that he's always there to answer and show that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So if you have a need upon your heart this morning, why don't you just lift your hand up to him and and say, "Father, this is my aisle of need and and I need you to come even right now and and touch and and answer to the request and and I believe we can lift our hands in faith all of us together as children that our father will hear." Amen. The brothers that are taking the offerings, brother Sergio, if you could just come and take this knees before the church. Amen. Let us pray.

Oh victory in Jesus my savior forever. He saw me and bought me with his redeeing power. He loved me. I knew him and all my love is doing. He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing blood. I heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing. How we made the lame to walk again and cause the blind to see. And then I cry, "Lord Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit." And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the f Victory. Oh, victory in Jesus my savior forever. He saw me and he bought me with his redeeing blood. He loved me here. I knew him all my life is through. He plunge me to victory if he's blessing. I heard about the manion he has built for me in glory. And I heard about the straits of gold beyond the crystal sea.

Our gracious father, Lord, you're the great creator and maker of all things. Father, you made us just the way that you wanted us to be. You chose in your great plan to have a variety of people and natures and personalities that you could all mold and form into the image that you had in your mind. And Father, we ask that we would continue to be on your potter's wheel today. that you would form us and and deal with us and make us be what you'd have us to be. Father, we pray that you never take your hands off of us, but you just keep working towards that great perfection. We ask you to bless each heart here this morning. In Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's turn over to uh the uh um see if I got my the gospel, the book of Second Kings in the Old Testament. And uh Second Kings is right after First Kings. I'm a Bible scholar. and uh and then it's just be after Judges and and Numbers and Exodus. So, it's kind of in the front of your Bibles. So, and we'd like just to read here and and have uh kind of just continue on the thought that we were ministering on uh last Sunday and uh just uh go down that line just a little bit again this morning. It said, "And then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab, and Isaiah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber, and was in Samaria, and was sick. And he sent messengers and said unto them, "Go inquire of Beelzebub, the god of Achor, whether I shall recover of this disease." But the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise and go up to meet the messenger of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is no God in Israel that ye go and inquire of Beelub, the God of Acar? Now therefore, thus saith the Lord, thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shall surely die. And Elijah departed. And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back? And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus sayeth the Lord, it is not because there is no God in Israel, that thou sent to inquire of Beelzeba, the God of Acorn. Therefore, thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou hast gone up, but shall surely die. And he said unto them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you? And told you these words? And they said unto him, he was a hairy man and girded with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said it was Elijah the Tishbite. Our gracious father, we ask you to bless your word in your precious name. We pray you may be seated. My uh my my little thought this morning uh to us all because uh is uh called unused promises. unused promises. And uh I I just this message uh came on my heart where I got my inspiration from. If you'd like to go uh study it and read it, uh it was I believe it was preached in November of 1962 and it was the message is called the way back. and uh and and so um we've been talking about uh uh character and uh uh the uh characteristics of something. And so we want to kind of just talk this morning about uh if we could do it maybe in a Bible study way and preach to you uh not so much of what our side of the effort is but having an understanding of what he's trying to do. You know I mean he the reason he created heaven and earth was to show his manifest himself. The invisible things of God are clearly seen in the visible things around us. So God being a spirit and uh not being whereas he could be handled or touched or known or seen uh uh and and being God, he was he was God alone. In fact, he really wasn't even God to begin with, if you could realize that because God's an object of worship. And so there was nobody to worship him and he created angels and and and yet uh uh he he wanted to display himself and make himself known and have fellowship and and so if when you can under understand that God is really the driver and the motivator of our lives if we're his &gt;&gt; the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord. Uh even Paul who God had in his mind to do a work for him. Uh he he was going about uh persecuting the church and and the Lord intervened because he had a great work for Paul to do. And he said, "Saul, you know, why why does it's hard for you to kick against a prick? You know, why do you persecute me?" And and I always thought I like that because Jesus took it personal. In other words, he was he was killing his followers and killing the ones that he believed. Jesus didn't say, "Oh, you're persecuting my saints. You're you're you're you're uh you know, you're you're destro destroying my legacy. You're uh interrupting my teaching." No, he said, "Why does thou persecute me?" In other words, this is this work that's going on of these men coming and recognizing me as the Messiah and receiving my spirit and being endued with power from on high and going about healing the sick and raising the dead and casting out demons and baptizing them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He said, "This isn't them. This is me. I'm the one doing the work. I'm the one that's manifesting myself. I'm the one that's on display. Uh this isn't them doing it. It's me doing it. And by you hurting them, you are hurting me. &gt;&gt; So why are you interrupting or persecuting or trying to put an end to the work that I am doing? and and and Satan, he wanted to come against that and and it I almost feel inspired right now to go through the the horse riders, you know, because that's what he did. Satan was wanted to interrupt that work from the beginning. And you know, and the best way to to deceive anything is to create a counterfeit. And that's what God uh Satan always does. He always has a counterfeit. He always has something else that he comes up with uh other than the way that God provided. So God has a provided way of doing things. He has a plan that he put in effect and he made that plan known in his word. &gt;&gt; Well, he's got a little secret in there is that he's got to reveal to you to what that word says. He's the one that opens your eyes to it and gives you Isab and therefore he that heareth blessed is he that heareth the words of this book and and and and understandeth these things. So you're blessed to hear the gospel. &gt;&gt; Now other people don't think you're blessed. A lot of people think we have a bunch of rules. You know, they just think it's a shame that you have to have long hair, that you wear dresses, that you men don't smoke and drink. They just think that's just miserable. Oh, you you just they come, "Oh, you just got to be miserable, you know." Uh, a guy told me one time, he says, "Well, don't you cuss?" I said, "No, no, I don't cuss." He said, "Well, you know something? If you just curse a little bit, you'd feel a lot better." I thought, "Wait a minute. No, I I I'm happy not cursing. &gt;&gt; This isn't a burden to me. It's a joy. &gt;&gt; I used to curse. &gt;&gt; I used to have a temper. &gt;&gt; I I used to, you know, beat things against the wall and and get so mad, you know, we used to say it. I so mad I could spit. You know what I mean? You just I I would get furious. And then the good things of God come by and I'm not going to lose my temper anymore and I'm not going to curse. And when I get all that frustration, something inside of me says, "This is temporary. It's not worth it. Uh there's something more to life than this." You know what I mean? I rejoice in that. I I I'm not that's not a burden to me. &gt;&gt; You know, thank God I I know his plan. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I know what he is and I want to learn more of him and I want to understand him more and I want to become more like him and I I want to become more acquainted &gt;&gt; and if I could this is sort of the line I want to go down. I want to become more acquainted with the way that he does things. You know, we just think sometimes things are so uh uh uh uh terrible. I wonder how that uh the that father felt when his son took his inheritance and went out and squandered it all. You know, I mean, I'm sure he was hurt, but I'm sure he back in the his heart and in his prayers, he says, "This is my son. I dedicated him to you. He's your child. He was You gave him to me by promise and I believe you're going to bring him back. &gt;&gt; And he waited patiently for the return of his son. &gt;&gt; And when his son come back, he didn't treat him like a a servant. He didn't treat him no, he treated him like a son like what that he always was. But how would you like to go through that? You you know what I mean? I I'm blessed. You know, I have I have uh three boys that that uh preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I know at least two of them have spent time in the back of a police car, &gt;&gt; you know, and in a lot of places that they shouldn't have been. But I I hang I hung on to something &gt;&gt; and and that was that that he that he he would if you raised them in the way that they would go &gt;&gt; that they would return &gt;&gt; out to. &gt;&gt; So that was a promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and and because I used that promise, &gt;&gt; it got a resolve. Amen. So, and so we pick up this story here and and uh it and it it kind of kind of reminds me like he says he said um you know this this man got lost in the woods and I think brother Brandon, brother Jeff is up there hunting and he got lost and the guy came came to him and he was riding up there and the guy he he He he came up to him and he said he said uh he said to him he says how do you get out of here? So the guy's lost and he comes up on his horse. He says how do you get out of here? And the guy answered him back. He said well how did you get here? And he and and he said how he said he said well that way. He said well then that's the way out. So the way back again is just how you got here. &gt;&gt; And so if I can say it this way, you know, sometimes if if that sometimes when we we get lost or we get into a place, we want to know the way back. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? H how do I get here? And what's my way back? Uh and because if you reject the way back, you reject the way forward. If you're lost, you have to go back to where you were. You've got to go back to an identifiable reference point that gets you going in the right direction. When you get lost in life and you don't you don't know what you're doing. It it it's very easy to do to get in a routine and you're working and you're laboring and you're going on and and and all of a sudden you get these feelings on you. What is what is what what is all this about? And what am I doing? And and what's my future hold? And and I it just seems like I'm spinning my wheels and the weight of of life just gets down to you. How did this happen to me? How did I get in this rut? And and you get in a rut that and you find you're you're kind of drifting and you're kind of lost and and and maybe you've made some mistakes. Uh, I'm go glad that my God's greater than my mistakes. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? But there's something inside of you that says you I how do I get back? How do I get back to that place of joy? I I'm backslid. I'm not reading my Bible. I'm not praying the way I used to. I don't feel the sensitivity of the spirit. I don't have any leadership. I don't have any uncction. I feel powerless. I I I I don't feel like I'm being led to do anything. And we we we our our life seems to close in on us and we feel collapsed and and and our joy begins to leak out. Uh like a leaky sister, you know what I mean? We we we're not holding uh we're not holding the joy of the Lord. We're not holding the peace of the Lord. Uh those things. And and so there's some desire in our heart that we want to get back. &gt;&gt; You know, I I want to get back. And that's why we call it being backslid. &gt;&gt; You You understand? And we want to get upslid. You know what I mean? We we we want to we want to go back up the slide. We want to climb the ladder. You know, and and so that that's our that that's what our goal is. We got to know that that there's an enemy, but there's got to there's a way back &gt;&gt; for for the believer &gt;&gt; and there's a way back into the presence of the Lord. There's a way back into the joy of the Lord. There's a way back where the pressures of this life and and th those things mean a whole lot. You know, uh it's like putting money in the savings account. you think you got a little bit of money in the savings account and and you feel uh pretty good. We used to say I got a little jingle in my pocket, you know, and if you had a little jingle in your pocket, man, you felt pretty good, you know. I used to keep a dollar bill, $1 bill, so I would never die broke. You know, I just, you know, if I die today or I get in a wreck, at least I'm not going to die broke. Well, I got a father that owns the cattle on a thousand hill &gt;&gt; and he promised &gt;&gt; I want to set that word again then he promised &gt;&gt; that the righteous would not bake bread &gt;&gt; and then my sermon goes so we're we're looking at we're we're just looking at this story and I took some inspiration from this story so if you want to go back and listen to it it's 11:23 um 1962 Shreport series called the way back and and brother B says this this morning. He says and the story started off this is paragraph 10 of that message. It says that the our story starts off tonight with the people that had that had like last night had got away from God. So, we know that Ahab got away from God and now his son takes the throne and he's away from God. And when we find ourselves away from God, we want to know a way back. Now, Satan will tell you there is no way back, but there is a way back. &gt;&gt; And and so they they they they had they had got away from God. And that is the most miserable thing that I can think of is someone a believer away from God. &gt;&gt; How many have ever I've I been away from God and it's miserable. &gt;&gt; It's miserable. you feel miserable, you know, and and regret &gt;&gt; just comes flooding in because you can't undo what you did and it's just setting on your mind uh like a ton of bricks and you're dragging it behind you and and maybe the burden leaves you for a few days or so, but then you come back along and there it seems like you're dragging your past, &gt;&gt; you know, and and yet there's there's promises for that, &gt;&gt; you know, leave those things which are behind behind and press for a higher calling. &gt;&gt; And and so uh the Samaria and and those people uh they they they got away from God. And we find out that this king of Samaria, Isaiah, the reason that he was away from God is because he had the wrong kind of tutoring, the wrong kind of raising. &gt;&gt; And so we we we find out sometimes that our problems are the things that and teachings and ideas we have in our life that aren't from God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Their their attitudes, &gt;&gt; their their reaction &gt;&gt; that maybe we've seen our parents do. Maybe we've seen the kids at school do. I I I've talked to hundreds of parents who who come and and they're devastated because their kid come home from school saying things. You know, I sat in my office. I don't think that person's here. If you are, forgive me because I don't remember who you were. But I remember the situation. They came in my office. I said, "My six-year-old came home today from school and announced to me that they're gay." And I said, "And and they're they're like I said, they don't even know what they're saying. But there there you understand. So, but that all this stuff takes them in away. Let me tell you, parents, know what they're teaching your children. &gt;&gt; If you have your children in sports, know the coach, know the attitude, know the parents, know the spirit that's on the team. uh you you know can know what the the uh uh atmosphere that's being created. See, these are things that we've got away from, &gt;&gt; you know, that that we we've we've dropped our responsibility on the atmosphere that we have in our home, the atmosphere that we have around our children, what it is that we're we're uh putting out as being important. If you have children and you're always talking and they always hear you worried about the bills, worried about the future, worried about this, worried about that, you know what that is to them? That's life. You know, could you imagine just saying, "Well, praise God." You know, if all they heard is, "Praise God." You know, I'm glad my father owns the cattle on a thousand hills. Hallelujah. I God will take care of us. You know, oh, I I woke up this morning not feeling too well, but thank God God's a healer. But that you understand now the way that they've been taught in the way they should go. And that's why the scripture says, "Raise a child in the way it should go." So you're you're just, you know, you've got to take the responsibility of knowing what direction are they're going and what are the questions that are on their heart and mind. &gt;&gt; And that's say to all our young people, I don't care if you're seven, six, eight, nine, 10, if you have a question about the word of God, I'm always available. because we want to go in the right direction. If we're not in the right direction, then how do we get back? &gt;&gt; You know, how do we how do we back instill the enthusiasm for the gospel, the enthusiasm for being in church on time, the enthusiasm for bearing the burdens of one another, the enthusiasm. It doesn't matter if the economy falls apart. I I would rather be financially bankrupt than spiritually bankrupt. &gt;&gt; I I you know I I would rather have the faith &gt;&gt; you know you know to take a stone and turn it into a loaf of bread than have all the money to buy all the bread in the world. But but we we GOT TO GET BACK TO that &gt;&gt; back to God first. Back to the power of God. Back to the MERCY OF GOD. BACK TO the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if we're not there, it it's not condemnation. It's how do we get back? And so he said they that he said because they didn't have the right kind of raising. His mother was a heathen. His father was a backsliden Israelite Ahab. And through there he hadn't had very much bringing up in the way of the Lord through by the thought by the people. So he he didn't he wasn't brought up in the way of the Lord. You can take that down now. Thank you. &gt;&gt; You know, deliverance is a great thing. &gt;&gt; I I I believe in deliverance. It's a good thing. But you know I but I think better than deliverance is is is not to get in trouble in the first place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know deliverance become becomes a crutch. &gt;&gt; You know and we always offer deliverance. There's a a lot of deliverance ministry in in the land today. uh got a lot of you know you're in trouble or you're you know you're you're this is going on this is going on that's going on here God's a deliverer he'll come and deliver you he's a he's a a mighty deliverer and and and people run and they come for deliverance because they want deliverance &gt;&gt; but what's better than deliverance is to be raised in the way to go that you Don't get in trouble. &gt;&gt; That That's the the better way. &gt;&gt; Experience is a teacher, but it's not the best teacher. Instruction is the best teacher. Obedience is the best weapon. &gt;&gt; It's not crash, burn, and be resurrected again. You know, if I ever come to this altar and I pray for a deliverance from whatever, whether it's movie, whatever it is, you guys have heard the list a million times from everybody that preaches, all the people come find, but I'd like to get up and say, "Okay, God just delivered me from this. HOW DO I NOT GO BACK? What's my way forward? &gt;&gt; I'm tired of repeating this. &gt;&gt; I like Aaron preached one time. I thought it was a pretty good sermon. He's called Breaking the Cycle. &gt;&gt; You know, this is what I want to know. And so we find out that that that we we recognize that uh that he uh that we want to we want to start finding out how is it that we go forward. And that's why I preached last Sunday that character is the deliverance. Not the act of being set free. &gt;&gt; A guy can step out of prison. &gt;&gt; The shackles are off, &gt;&gt; but if he runs with the wrong crowd &gt;&gt; and it's hard &gt;&gt; because all what he knew was what put him there. &gt;&gt; And when he comes out, that's still all that he knows. And if not, if he starts running with the same and doing the same and and doing the same things, he'll he'll go right back. &gt;&gt; But if he has the character to say, "I ain't going to be back in that place again. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to run with these people. I'm not going to take that. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to work hard." that that that isn't the things that the actions are not what delivers him. It's the character that's inside him. The characteristics of the decisions that he's made and the stance that he takes that's going to be his deliverance. &gt;&gt; He wasn't delivered when the key was opened and the cell came open and he came out no longer in bondage. His deliverance was the character that he has &gt;&gt; to overcome &gt;&gt; and it's given to the overcomer. &gt;&gt; Not the guy who's got the most deliverance stacked up. &gt;&gt; Look at me. I've been delivered 150 times by the Lord. But give me one deliverance and the character of Jesus Christ and I won't be back there. &gt;&gt; I want that to sink deep. &gt;&gt; He says, he says, I think that's the matter today, that most popular route. And when God makes a way, the people get away from him. And God makes a way for the people to return back to him. And the people refuse to do it. Then God asks, "Why?" He always asks, "Why didn't you do it?" And so we find out that this is our story that there there's a prophet in the land. And this king goes and inquires of be elabub. Will I be in this bed or not? And the Lord speaks to Elijah because the Lord had the plan. &gt;&gt; The Lord was the one who knew. you know, it isn't uh it it isn't this little uh you know, this little voice in this thing. You ought to Google, how do I get to heaven? How do I make the rapture? What is the voice of God in this generation? Do you think they got the answers? &gt;&gt; Why do you inquire? &gt;&gt; Why? Why do you why do you go this way? Why do you use these things? Uh uh you know, why do you do some some something else? You you know what I mean? Why do you go to some other source? Why? WHY DO YOU FIND some other method of deliverance, some other method of of finance? I you know, I've had people come and say, you know, I just can't get ahead. I asked I said, "Do you have you pay your tithes? &gt;&gt; No, I pay my bills and then what I have left over, I give some to God." You think, oh, you know, and you say, well, you know, why don't you why don't you reverse that program? &gt;&gt; And you know me, I'm not preaching tithing this morning or offering or anything. You have an experience with the Lord, it you you'll want to do it automatically. But &gt;&gt; but it's it's trying something else. &gt;&gt; You know, people that wanted to, you know, I like to catch fish. I got so many fishing lures that you It's ridiculous. Why? Because every time I get in there, I want to try something else. Well, I don't care what you're trying. If the fish don't bite, they're not biting. How about looking out and seeing if the cattle are feeding and the birds are feeding? They said, "Now I'll go fishing because they're fishing." But no, man wants to use science. They want to use technology. They want to use every they want to use some other provided way. I'm using fishing because I want you to see that it even in the carnal realm, we we we we want to fix carnal things with carnal things. And carnal plus carnal equals carnal. And this is what this king did is that he he wanted he wanted to try to try something else. He he wasn't going to go to what God provided. He's going to try something else. He's going to try some other method, some other thing. And when and this is what I'm trying to point out. There's a book full of promises. And the promises of God unused. &gt;&gt; We don't use the promise. Maybe because we don't know what the promise is. I I just printed out a hundred verses about deliverance. And then there's another hundred about trust. And there's another hundred about this. And I went there and there's all these different categories with Bible verses. AND I SAID, "THERE'S A BIBLE VERSE FOR EVERYTHING." &gt;&gt; God's got a promise for everything. &gt;&gt; He's got a word for everything. He has a method for everything. &gt;&gt; You don't need the mana of man. We need the mana of God. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. THAT'S WHAT HE PROVIDED &gt;&gt; IN THIS GREATEST BATTLE THAT WAS EVER FOUGHT. The battle in our mind and the battle in our life and the battle OF FLESH. IF GOD COULD HAVE GIVEN US ANYTHING BETTER than his word, he would have done it. &gt;&gt; But what did HE GIVE US? HE GAVE US PROMISES. &gt;&gt; It's what he gave us. And they go unused. The promises aren't even considered. They're not even searched out. Have you ever seen those little promise boxes? Pull a promise out every day and you read it. Just think how many days I don't even want to look back but how many days have I started a day without a promise. &gt;&gt; Without knowing what the future of my day was according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. the future of my day according to the promised word of God. &gt;&gt; I'd like to step out in the morning say, "I am the Lord thy God that deliverth thee from all thy diseases. I can rely on that promise. &gt;&gt; I will keep you. &gt;&gt; Nothing will pluck you out of the palm of my hand." I was starting that day, LORD. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF FOWLS AND BIRDS of the air that are trying to pluck me up and destroy me. The people at work hate me. THEY'RE SETTING TRAPS FOR ME. THEY'RE DOING ALL THESE THINGS FOR ME. BUT I'M NOT LOOKING AT THAT. I'm going to rely on the promised word of God. And yet the promises of God unused. &gt;&gt; There's a whole stack of them. I like these guys that have a whole box full of end wrenches and yet they'll get a pair of vice grips to turn that bolt every time. And after four or five times, you can't even put an end wrench on it no more. &gt;&gt; And it's so warped and through and chewed up that it's almost becomes worthless. &gt;&gt; You keep putting the wrong thing &gt;&gt; on something. You'll get it so warped and so mixed up in your mind that you won't even be able to discern it &gt;&gt; anymore. &gt;&gt; It'll become so deformed you won't even be able to tell what it is. &gt;&gt; And that's how uh Isaiah got and and Ahab got. They got so far away from God that there was a a way back &gt;&gt; right there in their midst &gt;&gt; and they couldn't recognize it. &gt;&gt; And it was the same thing was in our generation. The the church, the Christian church got totally away from God. They were going in the wrong direction. They were counting numbers. They were counting growth. They were counting the move of the spirit. They were counting their fellowship amongst one another. How that they felt. They no longer cared for the mind of God. They no longer cared for the promises of God. They no longer cared for the word of God. THEY WERE TOTALLY VOID. AND GOD SENT THEM A prophet &gt;&gt; to bring them back. &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE SAITH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AND IF THEY WOULD ASK, HOW DID WE GET HERE? HE SAID, "LOOK AT THE WAY YOU CAME. &gt;&gt; They quit. They started eliminating promises. They picked some, but they didn't pick others. They started wanting to preach a feel-good gospel. They had every other reason in the world for what they were doing. They lost the motivation of what does he feel about this? What is the will of the Lord? What does the Lord think about this? What does the word of God say about this? How should I address this? I'm going to knock until I found an answer. I'm going to seek till I find. I'm going to lay before the Lord. You know what the trouble nowadays? It's pressure. Everybody wants a instant decision. &gt;&gt; They want to microwave everything. They want to take this Bible, stick it in the microwave for 5 seconds, get it PULLED OUT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE WORD SAYS. IT SAYS, "THEY THAT WAIT UPON THE LORD, &gt;&gt; shall mount up with wings of the eagle." &gt;&gt; You can't Google the Bible. You can't Google the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You can't go seek some other way of doing things. with something that that he can that that uh you know that that he can fulfill his own way. And this is why the promises of God are are are are so important. You and I I just want to to say that to you. Uh it they're they're so important. You know, people I like what brother Ben says in here. I I won't give that that, but I'll just tell you what he said. He said, "Man was always trying to come up with slogans, you know, some move, some rally, you know, some thing to to create the revival." Let me tell you, the revival is individual. &gt;&gt; It's in your heart. &gt;&gt; You have to want to get back. You have got to work to get back to God. You have got to want to be healed. You have got to want to be delivered. You you know you it's it isn't a conviction that's put on you in the moment and then you feel the pressure and you run because I don't want to feel conviction. Most people want deliverance from CONVICTION BUT THEY DON'T WANT THE CHARACTER THAT KEEPS THEM FROM GETTING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. And that character lies in the promises of God. &gt;&gt; I like what he says. He says here, he says they want to come back in their own way of thinking. I'll just read the whole way. He says God had a way for him to know it, but he didn't want to take that way. He took the most popular way there was among the people. I hate to say this, but that's always seems slogans America back to God, back to God hour and things like that. But the thing of it is they want to come back the way that man had achieved for them to come back and they want to come back on their own way of thinking their own way of doing and usually it's contrary to God's way of returning. God had a way for him to get well. &gt;&gt; That would have been call Elijah the Tishbite. &gt;&gt; Elijah the Tishbite would have come, told him the word of the Lord, told him to get rid of his idols, told him to apply the the the token to Israel, told him to re get back to offering the sacrifices to get back to dressing right, acting right, living right. He would HAVE TOLD HIM GOD'S WAY BACK AND HE WOULD HAVE GOT BACK. &gt;&gt; BUT HE WENT and inquired &gt;&gt; of another way. &gt;&gt; And there we don't inquire of the promises. &gt;&gt; THE PROMISES go unused. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a mountain full of them. There's enough scripture for everything, &gt;&gt; but it's not used. &gt;&gt; It's like we said, it's acknowledged. &gt;&gt; It's identified. It's like putting on the jersey from the team. You know, I'm going to put on a a hockey jersey and I'm going to walk into the mall with a hockey jersey. You think everybody's going to Oh, there goes a hockey player. In my mind, if I was to wear a jersey, I should wear a Penguin jersey. Then they can say, "There goes a penguin." &gt;&gt; It's not association. Deliverance is in character. &gt;&gt; It's not association but it relies in in greater than association. He says their own way of thinking. And then when they returned down when they turned down God's provided way for them to return, God asked them, "Why? Why did you do it that way?" That's a good QUESTION TO ASK OURSELVES. WHY DID I DO IT THAT WAY? Why did I gossip instead of going to the person myself? &gt;&gt; Why did I have that bad feeling? &gt;&gt; Why was I jealous? We don't ask. Brother B preached a lot of sermons. Um, why? &gt;&gt; Because if we're not careful, we don't even use our mind. Our minds are being used, but we're not using our mind. I remember one of my boys told me one time, he said, "Dad, turn off your computer because if you don't, they'll use it." I thought, "You're crazy. How are they going to use my computer?" And they tried to explain to me how it's hooked up and I got an IP address and blah blah blah. And man, they took me off of this earth into space and alls I wanted to do is get back here as quick as I could. I asked my phone one time, "How do I get to such and such place?" I know it's auto parts store car. Next 20 minutes, I have 15 auto part store commercials. It's voodoo. AI. That's exactly what we're all going to get. We're all going to have artificial intelligence instead of the intelligence of God's word. God's word is the most intelligent thing that there is. &gt;&gt; God's word works. &gt;&gt; It'll never fail. It's been designed from the beginning to the end. It was designed TO GET US THROUGH THIS AGE. It was designed TO GET US THROUGH EVERY AGE. IT'S DESIGNED TO GET US THROUGH THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. IT'S GOD'S WORD AND IT WILL NOT FAIL. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But use everything else. &gt;&gt; You know what? I can put every artificial intelligence in one scripture. Surely you will not die. &gt;&gt; Where did it come from? I know where it came from. &gt;&gt; Unlike Al Gore who thinks he invented the internet, I know where the internet come from. I know how it got here &gt;&gt; and I know who's running it &gt;&gt; come from the beast &gt;&gt; in the midst of the garden &gt;&gt; who offered Eve another way to serve God. Do you know that Eve believed Satan's lie as God's truth? She thought she could serve God better, be more like God, but God's way was obey what I said. &gt;&gt; I'll provide the rest. &gt;&gt; I'll take care of you. &gt;&gt; I'll lead you. I'll guide you. I'll speak to you. I'll direct you. I'll convict you. I'll give you uncction. If you start down the wrong path, you'll feel my presence. Say, "No. that you're in the hand of God and nothing will pluck you out of there. That's a promise. And so he says, he said, he says like we call a time uh we used to be the president would say, well, we'll call 15 minutes of prayer. All the machinery stopped. They'll never do it. It's got to take a breaking up. It's got to take a dying out. It's got to take a regeneration. I It It don't take an hour of prayer. It takes until you come back. &gt;&gt; But you got to want to go back. &gt;&gt; You want to get you want to have to get back TO THE SPIRIT. YOU CAN'T KEEP having the church, the ministry, the everybody that we all do our best to ministers. I'm all with them. BUT YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE THEM KEEP PROVIDING you uh power drinks. &gt;&gt; You know, ANOTHER LITTLE TIDBIT, &gt;&gt; ANOTHER LITTLE SOMETHING TO GET YOU MOTIVATED. I guess they got programs today. &gt;&gt; I don't told me what one a CPT t chat or another guy says, "No, I use mine's better." And and so they pulled a trick on sister Leslie. We're talking about doing a little remodeling on the platform, make it a little bigger and and everything. So, Matthew talks to his phone and blah blah blah and kind of draws it up the way he want. And he takes a picture home to Leslie and says, "Look what we did, mom." And she's seeing the picture. And not only that, Davey's in the picture. She said, "How did YOU GUYS DO THAT SO FAST?" And they said, "Oh, we had all the stuff right at church. We're being duped." Amen. &gt;&gt; All the time. &gt;&gt; And we're totally unconscious of it. &gt;&gt; We We don't filter nothing back through the word of God. We don't find out, is there a promise of God for where I'm at &gt;&gt; and what I'm going through? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is there a promise God for my automobile? Is there a promise of God for my job? IS THERE A PROMISE OF God for my feelings the way that I am? Is there A PROMISE? IS THERE SOMETHING THAT GOD SAID HE WOULD DO? &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD SAYS HE'LL DO IT, HE'LL DO IT EVERY TIME. &gt;&gt; But it's not even considered no more. &gt;&gt; It's way down on the list &gt;&gt; of the book of wisdoms. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can solve every single &gt;&gt; scientific problem right here. &gt;&gt; It's all going to burn. &gt;&gt; I know the whole history of atoms &gt;&gt; and molecules. I don't care how you manipulate them now, friends. It's all going to burn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm smarter than Bill Gates. &gt;&gt; Until he repents and gets filled with the Holy Ghost and then there's no big eyes or little &gt;&gt; U's. &gt;&gt; What ladder are you climbing? What are you burning your life on? &gt;&gt; When we hit middle age crisis, a lot of guys go through it. We think, "I've worked all these years and I I can't keep working like this. What's my future hold? What am I going to do?" And then they say, "I got to do something." And then they start working on what they're going to do. What am I going to do for my retirement? What am I gonna do for my future? I got a promise &gt;&gt; if I would use it. &gt;&gt; He knows my future. &gt;&gt; He will take care of me. &gt;&gt; I can trust him. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord thy God that provideth all thy needs. I am Jehovah Gyra. But I'm going to change my direction. I just want to finish this. It's not something that you imagine or a declaration of creeds. It's not a declaration. It's not something that you declare or some thought thought of some instrumental of man but it's thoughts knowing Christ himself knowing him not even for the word if you know him you know the word because he is the word then you've got to come back to that reality. &gt;&gt; You've got to come back to the reality of God's word. God's word is a promise. &gt;&gt; It's the promised word. What is Malachi 4:5? It's the promised word of the hour. What is Luke 17:30? It's the promised word of the hour. What is Revelations 3 and14? It's the promised word of the hour. It's what God promised. It's what he said. What is the ministry of the son of man? It's what he promised. He said that the Lord would come back and veil himself in this generation. It's the promised word. &gt;&gt; It's his promise. Now, there's a reason. There's a reason for the promised word of God and and you people refuse it. They do all kinds of things. They take everything else. But the reason that God makes these promises and it's found in first se second Peter the first chapter and the fourth verse. By these exceedingly great and precious promises, we become partakers of divine nature and escape the lust of the flesh. &gt;&gt; So by it's by the promise that you become partakers of the nature. So God expressed his character in his word. I wrote my note this way. He said the promise being fulfilled in your life is that promised word being made alive. &gt;&gt; So when you take a promise of God, God gives you a promise, you take that promise, you have faith in that promise, you live by that promise. when that promised word now is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, God keeps his word. &gt;&gt; And when that kept word, that fulfilled word is made alive in your life, now he is on display. Then his character that made the promise. So why did he make the promise? BECAUSE THAT'S HIS CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; I'll not leave you, Dylan, nor forsake you. &gt;&gt; I'll be with you, &gt;&gt; even in you wherever thou go. Joshua, be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord thy God. I'll be with you wherever thou go. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; IF YOU KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS, I WILL NOT DEPART FROM YOU. if if and so when he makes a promise you have TO UNDERSTAND IT'S THE character and the attribute and the nature THAT CAUSED HIM TO MAKE that promise. So now the promises of God have a purpose. &gt;&gt; He gave these promises for a purpose. &gt;&gt; He He LEFT ALL THIS STACK FULL OF PROMISES. Now we know we got a devil says not one of them will work. &gt;&gt; But it's always by the believer &gt;&gt; that he proves his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's the character that makes the promise. &gt;&gt; If I help you do something, then the what causes me to help you is the love of my heart and the character in my nature. &gt;&gt; Unless I've got some alternative motive. And Jesus said that don't lend that you can borrow again. Don't lend and charge us. If you're compelled to go a mile, go twain. If you're asked for your coat, give your cloak also. What is that? That's character. &gt;&gt; The promises of God were given to display his character. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's the character is where the promises come from. The attribute, the nature, the personality that he is. It's what he was and is that produced the promise. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Am I making that clear? &gt;&gt; He gave a promise because he could give a promise. And he gave the promise because he can't lie. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now pet So he says if he gives the promise then the he says the character the promise is kept then his character that made the promise and keeps the promise. So anybody can make a promise. I can promise you with no character, &gt;&gt; but the character of my promise is me keeping the promise. &gt;&gt; So now I'm keeping the promise. I make the promise because my heart's desire is for you to have it. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to be dismayed. I don't want you to be discouraged. I want you to know I'm there for you. I want you to know I'm going to help you. I want you to know I have the power that to get you through whatever you think. I want you to know that I'm in charge of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want you TO KNOW OF GOD BEFORE YOU CAN BE against you. But all these promises are laying dormant. They're going unused. And therefore, his character is on the outside of the church knocking, trying to get in. &gt;&gt; I'll not forsake you. I he says, "I will come again. I'll send you another comforter." It wasn't a different comforter. It was him in a different form. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to you again in a different form. I'm not going to come to you in the flesh. I'm going to come to you in spirit. And I'm going to be with you in spirit. And I'm going to dwell with you in spirit. And I'm going to walk with you in spirit. and I'm going to be in you in spirit. That's my promise. &gt;&gt; His character is the same character that makes the promise is the same character that keeps the promise. And he says the promise and keep keep his promise. Then the promise is manifest and on display and identified in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He makes the promise. &gt;&gt; You take the promise. &gt;&gt; You believe the promise. The promise is made manifest and comes to pass. That's him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In you. By these great and exceedingly and precious promises, we are partakers &gt;&gt; of divine nature. &gt;&gt; But he spoke the promise because that's who he is. That's what he is. That's what he's made out of. And he gives you the promise that by that promise he can manifest himself. Now you can come with some other way but God only manifest himself in his word. The church has tried to come up about revival, but the way back to the original Pentecostal faith came through the promise of Malachi 4:5. And there's not another way back. &gt;&gt; Because he came back to correct correct the air. &gt;&gt; You couldn't have the former reign, the latter rain until you had the former reign, the what rain? the teaching reign, the ABC reign, &gt;&gt; THE UNDERSTANDING OF GOD REIGN. IT'S NOT TO DEMONSTRATE a power that we have or an anointing that we have. It's to BE IN A POSITION THAT HE CAN IDENTIFY HIMSELF in you. &gt;&gt; Am I long? Oh, it's not even noon yet. Now listen. So we understand that the promise is him. If he says I'm the Lord thy God that heals you all diseases by my stripes you are healed. That isn't a promise a separate from him. That is him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the great physician. &gt;&gt; He is the healer. &gt;&gt; I took these stripes. I want you to know that by these stripes, there's no sin laid to your charge to keep you from getting your healing. &gt;&gt; There's no curse that Satan puts on you. There's no sin that can be laid to your charge. You got to get that out of your mind. fight that battle with the promised word of God. &gt;&gt; But he has a way. Oh, I hope I can make this clear. I'm laboring to make it so clear to you. He has a way of doing things. &gt;&gt; And his way was his promise word. That's the way that he chose that he was going to be manifested in you. &gt;&gt; Not you deciding you're going to put on some kind of new Christian nature. &gt;&gt; Oh, how are you my brother? &gt;&gt; How are you today, my brother? &gt;&gt; You are now going to be so humble and sweet. &gt;&gt; Humility is not how you act. It's how you think. You can look at says, "Oh, &gt;&gt; oh my my brother Ben, my brother, you poor little sorry idiot failure. Uh, how are you today? Is God treating you fine, my brother? Don't ask me for a dime. I ain't giving you nothing. &gt;&gt; It's not how you act. It's how you think. &gt;&gt; And how should we think? Let this mind be in you &gt;&gt; that was in Christ Jesus. In closing, usually takes me 40 minutes to close. And God has never left himself without a witness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So he gives his promises &gt;&gt; so he can be on display. &gt;&gt; He gives his promises so he can be active in the hearts and lives of men. &gt;&gt; There's only one way God has to get into mankind. You say, "Well, it's by his Holy Spirit." No, THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A PROMISE. &gt;&gt; Repent and be baptized in the name, Lord Jesus Christ, and I'll give you my spirit. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; WHICH IS WHAT? THE PROMISED WORD. &gt;&gt; If you receive THE HOLY GHOST, WHAT ARE YOU RECEIVING? You're receiving every promise in the book. Every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, EVERY LINE. NOW you amen EVERY WORD OF GOD. AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. THAT'S THE TRUTH. THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; You can shiver and shake and disbelieve the word. Now, &gt;&gt; I'd rather shiver and shake and believe every word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it's by the promises. Listen. And God had a witness in that day, but his father hated that witness. And and his name was Elijah the prophet. and his mother hated this witness. But yet it was God's witness and stood just the same. &gt;&gt; God always has got a people somewhere that he can point to and say that's it. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that's our claim? Then how can we be that's it and have a pile of unused promises? &gt;&gt; How can we go seek some other way of getting things done when everything in our lives can be done with the promised word? our children safe, our jobs kept, our bellies full, clothes over our back, a good nature, doing the good works of God. Everything we have need of is laying in the promises of God. &gt;&gt; And he's got he's going to have a people &gt;&gt; that he can point to and says, "That's it." Why? Because the character of the accepted promise &gt;&gt; and the coming to pass of that promise &gt;&gt; the promises coming alive in the life because they live by the promise they can look and see that promise was fulfilled in their life &gt;&gt; and that's it. That's why he said, "YOU SEE THOSE PEOPLE, those girls, why they have their long hair and have their dresses because they're from another kingdom &gt;&gt; and they live holy under that kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's why we talk about high heels. Satan designed high heels to make a woman's body take a certain pitch to make it look sensual." Because the curse in the garden was sex. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why dress some other way? &gt;&gt; Why try to look beautiful in some other way than the beauty of holiness? You want to dress sexy, you'll attract a sex maniac. &gt;&gt; And he won't be true to you at all. &gt;&gt; But you take somebody that loves your character. &gt;&gt; He'll love you like he loves the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's a promise. He'll treat you right. &gt;&gt; He'll take care of you just like God takes care of him. Husbands, love your wives as Christ loves the church. &gt;&gt; Every promise he made to you, you can make to her. This is real marriage and divorce teaching, not a bunch of ways to figure out how you can get remarried. It's about getting married right the first time. &gt;&gt; Having the Holy Ghost and getting married right the first time, not taking a chance. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care how Google you got out of a boy and how sweet his tongue was. How do you How sweet do you think Satan's tongue was to Eve? That's why we call him slick talkers and forkid tongue, devil tongue. Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, I can't make it without you. You're the prettiest girl I've ever seen. What am I gonna do? you know, oh, would you wash this shirt for me? Uh, oh, you know, oh, you're just so wonderful, my would you come wash my car for me? Uh, &gt;&gt; I'm pretty soon you're nothing but a maid. Doing everything you can to please. Everything you can to please. Everything you can to please. And you ought to say, "Wait a minute. What are you doing for my spirit? What are you doing for my soul? &gt;&gt; Are you taking, you know, have you prayed today? Have you read the Bible? Have you prayed for me? Wouldn't that be a really good thing if one of you young sisters talking about just looked him dead in the eye and say, did you pray for me today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "No, I was just hoping your dress would get tighter. There's death in the camp. &gt;&gt; We got to get back to the promises of God. &gt;&gt; God never leaves himself. Look, God always has. He can point to, "Oh, I want to be among that number." I'm sure we all want to be there. It's the desire of every heart. We want to be among the number that God can say this is my people. &gt;&gt; Look at them. &gt;&gt; So when they look what is it that God wants them to see? &gt;&gt; He wants them to see his character, &gt;&gt; his nature. &gt;&gt; Where do you get that nature? from the exceedingly precious and great promises of God, we become partakers of divine nature. So if you're leaving THE PROMISES OF GOD UNUSED, you're leaving the display AND THE CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST UNDISPLAYED and unused. AND IT'S THE ONLY METHOD HE HAS IS BY HIS PROMISED word &gt;&gt; for this age and every age and every scripture &gt;&gt; we want to be among the people that say this is my people. Look at them. They're an example of what I am. Our mind auto automatically goes back to what can I do in my life to change my actions &gt;&gt; to be more like him. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching that. &gt;&gt; I'm saying there's a pile &gt;&gt; of unused promises. &gt;&gt; Get one. That's right. &gt;&gt; LET IT COME TO PASS IN your life. &gt;&gt; AND NOW HE IS ON DISPLAY. &gt;&gt; Am I making myself clear? &gt;&gt; I know it's not the modern trend. Everybody wants something to fall out of the sky, &gt;&gt; but God's already planned it. He's already laid down the way. &gt;&gt; It was his what? His word. &gt;&gt; Back to the word. The very first words in the scripture were his promises. The day you eat thereof is the day you die. You can take of every other thing in the garden, but don't eat this. The day you eat that, you die. &gt;&gt; It was a promise. It's all been a promise. Jesus fulfilled what? Every promise &gt;&gt; concerning him. &gt;&gt; We will fulfill &gt;&gt; every promise concerning us. &gt;&gt; Use the promises of God. Young sisters, use the promises of God for your husband. Young men, use the promises of God for your wife. Our messenger, because he was a prophet of God and the word of prophet, he could speak the promises of God for our age. &gt;&gt; I am the voice of God to you. &gt;&gt; That's what he said in closing this morning. This is my people. Look at them. They're an example of what I am. They are reflecting my life in theirs. What was Jesus life? It was complete obedience to every word of God. It was pre-planned by God. How did he pre-plan it? By what? Prophesying. He'll be in the grave three days. He'll hang on the cross, my bones that stare at me. He sat there and gave every promise. He'll turn the brokenhearted. He'll do this. He'll do that. He spoke it. He prophesied it. He told him he had to give something, some sort of promise that would identify him. So he wants to identify you. So he doesn't want you to come up with a creed, a moral code, your own way of living. He's going to identify you by giving you a promise because it's through that promise that you'll be partakers of divine nature. Now it's him keeping the promised word. And in keeping his word, he has now fulfilled his word using you as the vessel. Therefore, now you become the attributes of God. &gt;&gt; He says they are reflecting my life in them. They have surrendered their life and I'm reflecting my life. I got to find the rest of my quote. I'm reflecting my life through theirs. What a beautiful thing. How it must make God feel good to know that he's got somebody he can put trust in. And he had a man and his name was Elijah. Can I say that the Elijah of our day was the first fruits? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And one thing that you knew about brother Bram, he believed every promise. God wants to manifest himself through his people and the church wants to manifest itself to the people. I wonder if that poison isn't getting in our ranks &gt;&gt; where we want to manifest oursel to the people. &gt;&gt; Let's forget that. &gt;&gt; I don't care what people think about. We're a family here. &gt;&gt; Let's take care of one another. Love one another. Pray for one. Let's believe the promise of the word. Let the world take care of itself. &gt;&gt; I can't compare my ministry. People, they preach far, far beyond whatever I can preach. I don't have the ability, the energy or nothing. But there's one thing I know is I know that the food is in the storehouse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A man asked me, "Where do you how do you pick these messages? How do you find the things you do? Where do you get that from?" I'll tell you, the storehouse. &gt;&gt; It was what God provided. The storehouse. It's in the storehouse. I don't have to get it someplace else. It's in the storehouse. &gt;&gt; Where was the way back? It's in the storehouse. &gt;&gt; Where's the character? The identified character is in the storehouse. &gt;&gt; WHY? THE STOREHOUSE IS THE STORED UP PROMISES FOR OUR AGE. AND GOD MANIFESTED HIMSELF IN HIS promises &gt;&gt; and the promises of God. go unused. The church wants to manifest itself to the people. More numbers, bigger crowds, richer people, and so forth like that. Better dressed. That's what's got us in the chaos we're in. &gt;&gt; I'm getting out of the chaos, aren't you? &gt;&gt; We don't We're not chaotic. &gt;&gt; We've got a sure path to glory. It shall be light &gt;&gt; in the evening time. The path of glory you shall surely shine. The evening light have come. It is a fact that God in Christ is one. &gt;&gt; We got all the promises, church. &gt;&gt; Let's don't leave them &gt;&gt; unused. &gt;&gt; You want to manifest Christ? God's looking for somebody that can trust him, &gt;&gt; that he can trust that'll take his word and believe it. A guy asked me, he said, "Well, I want to do the will of God." I said, "What's the desire of your heart?" God gives you the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; You have got to want to come back. &gt;&gt; You have got to want to be healed. &gt;&gt; That's right. You have got to want to be one with him and in fellowship with him. Ask your heart if you want that. He promised in no wise will I turn you away. Seek me and you shall find me. &gt;&gt; Knock and it shall be opened. That's a promise. And it's by these exceedingly great impressive promises that we're partakers of divine nature. There's a book full of promises. Find yourself one. Look until you find. Seek and you shall find. &gt;&gt; Study to show your f proof. fall in love with the promises of God's word because I'll tell you in reality that's all you've got. Your car could be busted up pulling out of the driveway. Your company could crash tomorrow. You could be injured. You could get sick. You could do all those things. But there's one thing that Satan can never take from you, and that's the promise that God made you. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing. &gt;&gt; And when it's all said and done, what do we have? His promise. &gt;&gt; Why did he give us his promise? Because that's the way he manifest his character in you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand together. You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, he give you a way back. And it's not in your actions, it's in his promises. I just like us to bow our heads and and maybe you just ask yourself, I know you're busy with your jobs and your work and your finances and your bill and your future and and all those things. But I'm sure none of us want to have trouble at the river when we come to cross that great day. But I'd like to ask you if if you'd really examine yourself, if you could say, you know, I'm really not using the promises of God. The God promised that he'd strengthen me, but yet I use Red Bull. The God said that he'd order my footsteps, but yet I use some form of career development. I use a lot of things to make my life better, my health better, my life easier. And when I do, alls I do is I manifest the wisdom of my career counselor or I manifest the caffeine and Red Bull cuz I work longer and faster. and I'm using all these other things that are manifested in my life. And and yet Jesus said, "What does it profitth a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?" And then he made a promise. He said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, &gt;&gt; and all else will be added unto you." &gt;&gt; Lord, I wonder how many times I leave that promise unused. I wonder how many things in the Bible that I've never picked up and put into action. Lord, my prayer for my life in this life of this body is that we're a people that live by the promises of God's word in our daily life. That we're taking the promise and trusting it because that's the only way you can be manifested is through your promised word. the people that he can look at and say, "I'm reflected in their lives." I pray this morning, Father, that my thought was made clear. And Lord, I would rather see it in lives that stop for a moment and ask, is there a promise? Is there something that God said about this situation? Is there something that's from heaven that I can hold on to to get me through this? Lord, we take medicine and that's fine. That's fine. But it's no good if there's not a healer behind it. A doctor can set a bone, but it's you that heals it. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't put a trust in any pill, any shot, anything. My trust is in you. And I ask, Father, that above all things that the love of God would be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit. That's what we ask, Father, with all of our heart this morning for this people that they could believe every promise of God's word. Amen. What is that? Oh, be it unto me according to your word, according to your promises. I can say to you, the truth that sets me free. Oh, and according to your word, oh Lord, lead to me. Oh, and lead to me. according to your word. Oh, and according to your promises, I can stand secure. Oh, come upon my heart. and the truth are set free. Oh, and according to your word, oh Lord.

Oh, this is my day. Oh, this is my day. Oh, and your word. &gt;&gt; He made the promise to you this morning. all to me and I Lord I'm desperate for you. Just tell them you need him this morning. Hallelujah. Oh, and now Lord, I'm lost without you. &gt;&gt; If you need prayer this morning, just come. You'll be grateful. Hallelujah. Oh, he's here this morning to make his word a reality to you. Oh, and your holy praise. Oh, and this is my daily pray. Oh, I missed my very worth to me. Lord, I'm desperate for you. You are the answer this morning and just sing it one more time this morning.

And Lord, I'm so thankful for a gospel that transforms lives. Lord, as it has transformed us, Lord, we can take that same word upon our lips, provide it to others, and watch your promised word come to pass. Father, we just want to commit each one as they go into your hands, Lord. That Father, that you would be able to apply your word, Lord. Give us eyes of understanding. May you be the first thing we look to. May we look to the provision. What did you have to say about it, Father? Quicken us, I pray. Grant us vision.
