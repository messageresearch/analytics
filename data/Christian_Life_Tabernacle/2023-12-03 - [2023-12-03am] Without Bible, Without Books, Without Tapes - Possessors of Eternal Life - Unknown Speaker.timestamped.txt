[17:21] hearts amen that we may receive life and
[17:23] life abundantly amen God bless
[17:27] you
[17:32] [Music]
[17:37] Lord Jesus once again we're just
[17:38] grateful to be in this place this
[17:40] morning Lord that you raised us up in
[17:43] health strength this morning lord gave
[17:46] us the strength to come Lord you gave us
[17:49] a desire to be here Lord that we heard
[17:53] your voice and that something drew us to
[17:55] this place a desire a longing that we
[17:58] might be in your presence father not not
[18:01] just to see one another not just to hear
[18:04] a great teaching or Lord to have a good
[18:07] service but that we might come to see
[18:10] you Lord as the two men said as they
[18:13] walked on the road to EMAs Lord we look
[18:17] forward to our hearts burning as you
[18:19] talk with us along the way Lord we
[18:21] commit the service to you we want to
[18:24] welcome you that you would have your
[18:25] perfect will Lord that what's done here
[18:28] would be the work of God and not the
[18:30] work of men Lord you know the desire of
[18:32] each one that's come through that door
[18:34] the needs that they have needs perhaps
[18:36] that they don't even know themselves
[18:39] Lord each of us Lord looking to you to
[18:42] make us more and more like you we pray
[18:44] once again that the service would be
[18:46] done according to your will that every
[18:47] need would be met we pray these things
[18:49] in jesus' name
[18:52] amen wel be seated we are
[18:56] uh going to read Psalm 12 23 this
[19:00] morning it's uh just a few short verses
[19:05] it's a little
[19:07] Psalm and it it begins with a simple
[19:11] statement it says unto
[19:13] thee lift I up mine
[19:16] eyes oh thou that dwellest in the
[19:21] heavens you know it's very similar to a
[19:23] scripture that's just two chapters away
[19:25] that is probably more familiar to us and
[19:28] Psalm 121 it says I will lift up mine
[19:31] eyes unto the
[19:33] hills from whence cometh my
[19:36] help my Help Cometh From The
[19:39] Lord you know both scriptures speak of
[19:44] one lifting up their eye and setting
[19:47] their sight on the
[19:51] Lord
[19:52] and you know it
[19:55] describes where we should have our eye
[19:59] what our eyes should be fixed
[20:02] on you know probably everyone in this
[20:06] room would say Amen to the idea that we
[20:10] need to keep our eyes on
[20:14] Jesus know Paul said it this way in
[20:17] Hebrews 12 he said looking unto
[20:21] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[20:26] faith you know brother Bram made an
[20:28] interesting statement in a sermon he
[20:32] preached entitled Look Away to
[20:36] Jesus and he said this about our need to
[20:39] keep our eyes on the
[20:41] Lord he said now you might say we have
[20:45] heard this generation after
[20:49] generation we've heard this for a long
[20:52] time that is
[20:54] true and it has been preached for a long
[20:57] time
[20:58] many ministers has took this same text
[21:02] thousands of
[21:03] them but here is the thing I want to ask
[21:07] you tonight for these next few
[21:10] minutes when you look uh the question is
[21:15] what do you see amen when you look amen
[21:19] that's right what do you see when you do
[21:23] look that only depends Hallelujah on
[21:27] what you're looking
[21:30] for you know and that was kind of on my
[21:33] mind as I was looking at Psalm 123 where
[21:36] it says unto thee lift up mine
[21:39] eyes oh thou that dwellest in the
[21:43] heavens the question is in the
[21:46] psalm what is he looking
[21:49] for in what way is he
[21:53] looking if you move on to verse
[21:56] two he says
[21:59] behold as the eyes of the servants look
[22:03] under the hand of their
[22:04] masters and as the eyes of a maiden unto
[22:07] the hand of her
[22:08] mistress so our eyes wait upon the Lord
[22:12] Our God
[22:15] Amen now remember what brother brandham
[22:20] said what do you see when you look
[22:24] amen it depends on how you look
[22:28] and what you're looking
[22:31] for and here in Psalm 123 he compares
[22:34] the
[22:35] looking to a servant or a
[22:39] maid
[22:41] waiting
[22:43] watching the
[22:44] hand of the
[22:48] master this is a different kind of
[22:51] looking you know it's not just waiting
[22:55] to hear from the master with the expect
[22:58] ation of hearing his
[23:01] voice it's watching The Master's
[23:05] Hand anticipating his
[23:09] needs not sitting in another
[23:12] room
[23:15] somewhere you know waiting to hear his
[23:19] voice this is being already close enough
[23:22] to
[23:23] him to be able to
[23:26] anticipate and recognize his
[23:29] desire even without him
[23:33] speaking already so
[23:37] familiar so
[23:40] practiced so
[23:42] close that you're able to watch the
[23:45] Master's
[23:46] Hand and be sensitive to the slightest
[23:51] move and know what he wants
[23:54] done nobody heard anything
[23:58] nobody felt
[24:00] anything but you saw
[24:04] it if you need somebody to
[24:08] shout you're not close enough to the
[24:12] master you know there's a story in
[24:15] Matthew
[24:16] 8 of a centurion that
[24:20] came to Jesus on behalf of one of his
[24:24] servants Now understand that a centurion
[24:27] was an important
[24:30] man an
[24:32] officer in the Roman
[24:34] army who was responsible for 100
[24:38] soldiers it would be the equivalent of a
[24:41] captain in one of today's
[24:46] militaries and as the captain of an
[24:49] occupying
[24:50] Army he was perhaps the most important
[24:53] man in
[24:55] town Matthew 8 verse 5 and when Jesus
[24:59] was entered into capernium there came
[25:02] unto him a
[25:03] centurion beseeching
[25:06] him and saying Lord my servant lith at
[25:10] home sick of the
[25:12] paly grievously
[25:15] tormented you remember the story Jesus
[25:18] said in verse 7 I will come and heal
[25:21] him now it was that simple he said yes
[25:24] and he was already on his way to do the
[25:28] move but then this Centurion who was the
[25:32] most important man in
[25:34] town said Lord I'm not
[25:37] worthy that thou should us come under my
[25:41] roof but speak the word
[25:43] only and my servant shall be healed for
[25:47] I am a man under Authority notice what
[25:50] he says I am a man under Authority
[25:52] having soldiers under
[25:54] me and I say to this man go and he goeth
[25:58] Hallelujah and to another come and he
[26:01] cometh yeah and to my servant do this
[26:05] and he doeth it Hallelujah so my
[26:08] question is is when he had a need why
[26:10] didn't
[26:13] he he had hundreds of soldiers uhhuh
[26:17] hundreds of servants oh my most
[26:20] important man in
[26:21] town and he could have he could even
[26:24] taken a person off the street and told
[26:25] him what to go do and he didn't done
[26:29] it so without any question without any
[26:32] choice they would have had to go do as
[26:34] he
[26:36] asked you know the scripture goes on to
[26:38] say in verse 10 that Jesus marveled at
[26:40] this he said I haven't seen Faith like
[26:43] this anywhere in
[26:45] Israel and of course he did just that he
[26:48] spoke the word and the servant was
[26:49] healed but my question is this what
[26:53] made this servant so special
[26:59] that this servant was so
[27:02] trusted so
[27:05] valued that this
[27:07] Centurion the most important man in
[27:11] town would come down into the
[27:14] streets into the gutters
[27:18] himself to bring this request personally
[27:22] to
[27:24] Jesus for this servant this servant
[27:29] why you know a servant one who's under a
[27:35] master responds to every word of his
[27:40] master or her
[27:42] mistress you know they say do this do
[27:45] that there's no choice there's no option
[27:46] and a good servant will respond and be
[27:49] sensitive to the
[27:51] voice but the real close real trusted
[27:55] real valued servants
[27:59] they're the ones that are so valued so
[28:01] loved that a great man would do anything
[28:03] pay any price for that
[28:08] servant are so close so in
[28:13] tune with the
[28:15] master that they only need to watch his
[28:20] hand and they can tell by the way he
[28:23] moves the direction he starts to look
[28:28] because they know the
[28:30] master they already know his
[28:34] desire and his
[28:37] need and are ready to
[28:42] move they already know what his need is
[28:45] because they're so practiced at watching
[28:47] him move that he doesn't even have to
[28:49] speak they see him begin to move and
[28:52] they know what he wants
[28:55] done they just need to sit sit there and
[28:57] watch his
[28:59] hand they knew when he needed a
[29:02] drink they knew when he needed his
[29:05] shoes they knew when he needed the
[29:08] fire and immediately he'd be about the
[29:10] work that's an
[29:13] Irreplaceable
[29:15] servant you know have you ever been to a
[29:17] restaurant where you had a waiter or a
[29:19] waitress that you never even had to ask
[29:21] for
[29:22] anything the moment you set your glass
[29:25] down and they were there and filled it
[29:28] you set your plate in a certain way they
[29:30] were there picking it up they already
[29:33] knew that you needed more bread you
[29:35] didn't even have to ask because they
[29:37] were watching your
[29:39] hand and you'll pay any price for a
[29:43] waiter like
[29:46] that Psalm 1232 behold as the eyes of
[29:51] servants look unto the hand of their
[29:55] masters and as the eyes of a Maiden unto
[29:57] the hand of her mistress so our Lord or
[30:02] so so our eyes wait upon the
[30:07] Lord you know as brother brandham said
[30:09] what do you see when you look what are
[30:13] you looking
[30:15] for it depends on how you
[30:18] look you know as Believers no doubt
[30:21] we've desired a we we've developed a
[30:24] habit when we have a need or we have a
[30:28] desire or we have a request we set our
[30:31] eyes on the
[30:33] Lord and we seek his face we ask to hear
[30:36] his
[30:37] voice we read the word we listen to a
[30:40] tape come to church services and desire
[30:43] to hear from
[30:45] him but the question is are our eyes set
[30:49] on him such are we so close to
[30:52] him that our eyes are carefully watching
[30:55] how he
[30:56] moves
[30:58] and we know him enough to recognize when
[31:00] he's leaning a certain way or he's
[31:02] leaning another
[31:04] way we often look to him to meet our
[31:08] needs but is our eyes so fixed on him
[31:11] that we can anticipate his needs and be
[31:14] ready to
[31:17] move you know a trusted servant is one
[31:20] who's so close to the
[31:22] master will watch his hand and
[31:25] anticipate his needs
[31:28] he becomes an extension of the Master's
[31:31] Hand the Master's Hand begins to move
[31:34] this way and the servant completes the
[31:36] work the master starts to turn his eye
[31:38] here and the servant completes the work
[31:41] an extension of the
[31:44] master any servant can respond to a
[31:48] shout in the
[31:49] house any
[31:51] servant can respond when the right sound
[31:54] is played on the Bell or the the
[31:59] instrument but how many servants are so
[32:02] close to
[32:03] him that they just watch how he moves
[32:06] and they're
[32:08] there anticipating his needs let's go
[32:11] ahead and
[32:13] stand you know my prayer is that the
[32:16] Lord would help me to be so
[32:19] close so sensitive to his
[32:22] hand so aware of him
[32:28] that I can anticipate his desire that I
[32:31] know what he wants done amen with his
[32:37] word help me not to be one of those who
[32:39] need shouting to
[32:41] respond that need some instrument to
[32:44] play to respond that need detailed
[32:47] instructions or great hours of study to
[32:51] respond but so focused on his desire
[32:56] that I can be be there when he moves
[32:59] let's go ahead and read Psalm 123 this
[33:01] morning it's just a short Psalm unto
[33:03] thee lift I up mine eyes oh thou that
[33:06] dwellest in the heavens behold as the
[33:09] eyes of servants look under the hand of
[33:11] their masters and as the eyes of a
[33:13] maiden unto the hand of her mistress so
[33:16] our eyes wait upon the Lord Our God
[33:19] until that he have mercy upon us have
[33:22] mercy upon us O Lord have mercy upon us
[33:25] for we are exceedingly filled with
[33:27] contempt our soul is exceedingly filled

[1:03:19] son a high priest that could be touched
[1:03:23] by our
[1:03:25] infirmities that was tempted in every
[1:03:28] manner the way that we are
[1:03:32] tempted it's hard for us
[1:03:35] to understand that kind of
[1:03:41] love but he overcome that he could
[1:03:45] become our
[1:03:47] Overcomer that he could become our
[1:03:51] way he could become our answer to all
[1:03:54] All
[1:03:56] Things No
[1:04:00] matter how we perceive the
[1:04:04] situation he's greater for he's the
[1:04:07] creator of all
[1:04:09] things and we ask this morning
[1:04:14] that our precious savior would touch
[1:04:17] each
[1:04:19] heart that it would leave an indelible
[1:04:22] mark on our lives that we could look and
[1:04:26] say surely the Lord has been here surely
[1:04:30] the Lord has moved on my
[1:04:32] behalf surely the Lord has been my
[1:04:36] portion and my strength and My
[1:04:38] Hope surely the Lord hath made a way for
[1:04:42] me the great way maker we ask that you
[1:04:45] would bless that to us this morning we
[1:04:48] ask your guidance and your goodness to
[1:04:52] us and mercy this morning morning we
[1:04:54] pray in jesus' name
[1:04:58] amen amen hallelujah if you have your
[1:05:01] Bibles let's open this morning to St
[1:05:05] John the 14th chapter and then we're
[1:05:09] going to uh it go to the 16th chapter
[1:05:12] and read a verse of scripture there amen
[1:05:16] so
[1:05:18] um I just got out we had an hour this
[1:05:21] morning of preliminaries now I get my
[1:05:24] hour and a
[1:05:25] half amen I mean I don't want to cut
[1:05:29] myself short you know no we just want to
[1:05:32] love we want to listen to a little
[1:05:33] portion of sermon this morning but let's
[1:05:36] listen to these great scriptures here as
[1:05:40] the Lord tells us we're going to
[1:05:41] continue
[1:05:43] on on our subject no Bible no books no
[1:05:48] tapes the Faith of Our Fathers and I'd
[1:05:53] like to call
[1:05:54] this portion of that no Bibles no books
[1:05:59] no tapes possessors of eternal
[1:06:02] life and uh so we know that our that
[1:06:08] what is supposed to be restored to us in
[1:06:11] this day is the Faith of Our Fathers so
[1:06:15] we want to start to comprehend what was
[1:06:18] it that they must have had that they had
[1:06:21] no books no tapes and no Bible and yet
[1:06:26] they wrote the book of
[1:06:28] Acts so it's a it's a fabulous thought
[1:06:31] if we could enter into it and I believe
[1:06:34] that our prophet of God unfolds this to
[1:06:37] us in so many ways as he was trying to
[1:06:41] get the modern church back to the
[1:06:45] experience that they had in the
[1:06:47] beginning and he says Jesus and this is
[1:06:50] the 14th chapter and the 12th verse he
[1:06:53] says verily verily I say unto you he
[1:06:57] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:07:02] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:07:07] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:07:13] father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my
[1:07:17] name that will I do that the father may
[1:07:23] be glorified IED in the
[1:07:26] sun now that's a key
[1:07:29] verse because he's giving them a promise
[1:07:33] he's giving them something that they can
[1:07:36] go out
[1:07:37] with right they're get they're going to
[1:07:40] be commissioned so when they meet people
[1:07:43] they have to know that whatsoever I ask
[1:07:45] in the father's name he'll do so hold
[1:07:49] that there because this is what makes
[1:07:52] you real that's right without this
[1:07:55] you're just
[1:07:57] words okay we don't want to be words do
[1:08:01] we want to be life in flesh amen amen am
[1:08:05] mean he says and if ye love me keep my
[1:08:10] Commandments and I will pray the father
[1:08:14] amen and he shall give you another
[1:08:18] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:08:22] forever
[1:08:24] amen amen even the spirit of Truth whom
[1:08:28] the world cannot receive because it
[1:08:32] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[1:08:37] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[1:08:42] shall be in you amen these These are the
[1:08:49] keys to the Faith of Our Fathers amen
[1:08:54] they possess something shall be in
[1:08:57] you I will not leave you comfortless I
[1:09:01] will come to
[1:09:03] you oh no wonder he can say go wait I
[1:09:07] will come to you go wait up there until
[1:09:11] I come
[1:09:13] amen he he said I have come yet a little
[1:09:16] while and the world seeth me no more but
[1:09:22] ye see me because I live ye shall live
[1:09:27] also at that day ye shall know that I am
[1:09:35] in my father and ye in me amen and I in
[1:09:43] you that's what all of us want to come
[1:09:48] to the revelation of and know beyond the
[1:09:51] shadow of a doubt
[1:09:54] he's
[1:09:56] here amen let's also turn to John 16 and
[1:10:00] the 13th
[1:10:08] verse he
[1:10:11] says how be it when he the spirit of
[1:10:15] Truth is come he will guide you into all
[1:10:20] Truth for he shall not speak of himself
[1:10:23] self but whatsoever he shall hear that
[1:10:27] shall he speak and he will show you
[1:10:32] things to come amen amen Heavenly Father
[1:10:36] we ask you to bless your word to us in
[1:10:39] your precious name we pray this morning
[1:10:42] amen you may be
[1:10:46] seated uh uh we just uh we want to say
[1:10:50] this this morning uh to you that uh
[1:10:54] We've we've uh finally come to the uh
[1:10:59] the top of the hill as far as the
[1:11:01] building next door door goes now we're
[1:11:04] starting
[1:11:05] downhill U and but uh the
[1:11:10] uh uh we're going to start sheet rocking
[1:11:14] uh tomorrow Lord willing and um so I
[1:11:19] just want to let you know when you do
[1:11:21] sheetrock there's a lot of white d D
[1:11:24] everywhere so you're welcome to go in
[1:11:26] there and get Dusty if you like and you
[1:11:29] want your kids to track that dust into
[1:11:32] your cars that's okay with me uh
[1:11:36] there'll be drywall mud everywhere and
[1:11:38] that gets all squishy and tracky but
[1:11:41] you're more than
[1:11:43] welcome to
[1:11:45] to walk around in there and get dirty
[1:11:48] and dusty and muddy uh that's fine but
[1:11:52] parents it's your
[1:11:54] call okay so we just want to say that
[1:11:57] pray that everything goes well uh after
[1:12:01] we get it drywalled and painted we'll
[1:12:03] need a lot of help uh I'm sure that
[1:12:06] we'll pick a color that not all of you
[1:12:08] are going to be happy with but that's
[1:12:11] too bad as long as I like
[1:12:15] it you know what I mean so so that's
[1:12:20] that's how it's going to be okay and
[1:12:23] then if if uh if you can find a church
[1:12:26] to go to that'll paint it just the color
[1:12:28] you want it that's fine with me also but
[1:12:32] anyway because we're not here to build
[1:12:34] churches we're here to make the
[1:12:36] Rapture is that what we're here for so
[1:12:40] we understand that God sent us a
[1:12:45] messenger to restore back to us the
[1:12:49] Faith of Our Fathers cuz without faith
[1:12:53] Faith it's impossible to please God and
[1:12:56] it's not man-made Faith it's god-given
[1:13:00] faith faith is a
[1:13:03] revelation and God reveals something to
[1:13:07] you and you're able to recognize it as
[1:13:11] God it speaks to something that's within
[1:13:15] you there's something inside of you that
[1:13:18] responds to it you know it's his voice
[1:13:22] because the script R says my sheep hear
[1:13:25] my voice and another they won't follow
[1:13:29] and I I want to share with you before we
[1:13:32] go into listening to 29 minutes of the
[1:13:36] message leadership you'll see where our
[1:13:38] sermon
[1:13:40] going but I'd like to play for you a a a
[1:13:45] just a one quot or I'm not play for you
[1:13:47] put it on the board from the voice of
[1:13:51] the sign the the voice of the sign and
[1:13:56] we know that God never comes forth am
[1:14:01] and does the
[1:14:03] supernatural without a message
[1:14:07] following and the message is the voice
[1:14:11] of the sign so if if I would to do
[1:14:14] something there would have to be an
[1:14:16] intention and in purpose of why that I
[1:14:20] have done it and the reason that I did
[1:14:23] it was to reveal to you or show you
[1:14:27] something or get a message to you so
[1:14:31] that would be the voice of the sign
[1:14:35] would be the purpose and the reason that
[1:14:38] the sign was done and the message for
[1:14:41] the sign God didn't come in this
[1:14:44] generation and turn his back to the
[1:14:47] audience and say like oh there's a
[1:14:50] sister in the fifth row uh wearing
[1:14:54] such and such and I see her right here
[1:14:57] and I see her at a doctor's office and I
[1:15:00] see the doctor examining her and I see
[1:15:03] this is what he says and and it be
[1:15:05] exactly
[1:15:07] right amen you know what I mean he did
[1:15:10] those things so the church would
[1:15:13] recognize that what he was
[1:15:16] saying it came from the father now for
[1:15:20] those that have that God's opened our
[1:15:24] eyes and given us a deeper Revelation
[1:15:27] that should have been good enough just
[1:15:30] as him being a prophet but for those who
[1:15:33] understood greater what God was doing
[1:15:36] that was the same spirit that was in
[1:15:39] Jesus Christ back in a different
[1:15:43] Corporal body no difference between the
[1:15:47] spirit but now the son of man didn't
[1:15:50] come in the created body of Jesus Christ
[1:15:54] now it came in a redeemed
[1:15:57] body and it was the same Lord Jesus
[1:16:00] Christ veiled in flesh in our day doing
[1:16:05] the same signs that he did 2,000 years
[1:16:08] ago so the Gentile
[1:16:11] Church would be on equal
[1:16:14] basis
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:17] amen and he he performed that right out
[1:16:20] before us God sitting in our gener
[1:16:23] generation and and doing uh the the
[1:16:29] supernatural Amen in order to get his
[1:16:33] elect
[1:16:34] lady that he knew who would be here in
[1:16:38] this age and this time amen focused
[1:16:43] on tuned
[1:16:45] into the Word of
[1:16:48] Promise that that there's going to be a
[1:16:52] resurrection ction yeah and a
[1:16:55] Rapture and that that's what is the key
[1:16:59] element of everything that we were now
[1:17:04] okay I like you to listen to this quote
[1:17:07] um and to me it Matthew shared this with
[1:17:12] me and I I just thought it was so
[1:17:13] wonderful I don't know if he read it to
[1:17:15] you Wednesday night or not I don't
[1:17:18] recall but listen to what he says he
[1:17:21] says God will build his church upon upon
[1:17:27] the
[1:17:27] foundation of Jesus Christ and that's
[1:17:31] the Bible outside of that all other
[1:17:36] ground is sinking sand God doesn't
[1:17:40] change his
[1:17:42] nature amen his nature doesn't change so
[1:17:47] we know if God ever does something one
[1:17:49] way the first time he does it the same
[1:17:51] way the second time
[1:17:53] so whatever he did in the first church
[1:17:57] he has to do in the last Church he's
[1:18:03] never changed it every age it's been by
[1:18:07] Revelation even uh Martin Luther had
[1:18:12] Revelation and he moved by faith in the
[1:18:16] portion of the spirit that was given to
[1:18:19] him to move and he did a great thing out
[1:18:23] of the Catholic church that was no easy
[1:18:26] thing and Wesley and we could go on but
[1:18:30] now let's read the rest of this together
[1:18:33] and see how
[1:18:36] phenomenal this was preached in
[1:18:41] 64 and and it it's it's right up here if
[1:18:44] you want to read it say this he
[1:18:47] made women different from
[1:18:51] man and man different from
[1:18:57] woman he dressed them different he wants
[1:19:01] them to stay that way see woman wants to
[1:19:07] look like man and man wants to look like
[1:19:13] woman oh
[1:19:15] my such a
[1:19:18] perversion the whole thing
[1:19:21] looks like it's got a grip on the people
[1:19:27] and you can't change
[1:19:31] it now think of it in the hour we're
[1:19:35] living in in 64 he's saying man wants to
[1:19:39] be woman it's a dark cloud that's got a
[1:19:42] grip on the people and they can't change
[1:19:44] it look where it's brought them
[1:19:49] to look where it's brought him to the
[1:19:52] sports world is all upset because these
[1:19:55] men are coming over and they're claiming
[1:19:57] to be women and they're swimming and
[1:19:59] running and playing sports and and and
[1:20:02] and then they claim there's no
[1:20:04] difference God said he made them
[1:20:06] different and he wanted them to stay
[1:20:09] that way but look at he says it he says
[1:20:11] it's got a grip on the people you can't
[1:20:13] change it it looks like a great
[1:20:17] monster a great
[1:20:20] Blackness if you understand
[1:20:23] what I'm speaking of it in the spirit
[1:20:27] amen a great monster amen a great
[1:20:33] Darkness over the people
[1:20:37] amen now you are
[1:20:40] living in the age that there's a great
[1:20:46] Darkness a a
[1:20:49] monster over the people amen now think
[1:20:52] of the power of that monster amen that
[1:20:57] it could take a a person a
[1:21:00] man and have such an effect on him that
[1:21:04] he wants to be a woman and vice
[1:21:09] versa and the world's just trying to say
[1:21:12] oh it's natural now i' say that because
[1:21:16] this spirit is going to it's going to
[1:21:19] come against our children amen and I
[1:21:21] want you to know know that it's not that
[1:21:25] their gender confused it's not that they
[1:21:28] don't know whether they're a man or a
[1:21:30] woman or not it's this great monster and
[1:21:34] you've got to be able to look at that
[1:21:36] and say that's a great
[1:21:38] monster it's a trying to grip my child
[1:21:42] and I'm going to stand up against
[1:21:47] it I mean we know how far this

[1:24:45] it's a great monster amen that's gripped
[1:24:49] the people they can't helps they can't
[1:24:52] can't stop there's only one way out and
[1:24:56] that's God's provided way amen so we're
[1:25:00] talking this morning as we're talking
[1:25:04] about this
[1:25:07] church that is going to be restored in
[1:25:13] us and so we understand from what we
[1:25:17] just read that these believers they
[1:25:21] didn't have books they didn't have
[1:25:25] Bibles they didn't have
[1:25:28] tapes so God promised them something he
[1:25:32] had to give them
[1:25:35] something do you understand to lead them
[1:25:40] lead them and to guide them and that's
[1:25:43] what he said he said when the spirit of
[1:25:46] truth comes when the spirit that I
[1:25:48] promised you I would not leave you nor
[1:25:51] forsake you but I'll be with you even in
[1:25:54] you till the end the spirit that he
[1:25:57] promised them he said I will not leave
[1:25:59] you comfortless but I will come again so
[1:26:03] he he told those Believers you go up
[1:26:06] here and you
[1:26:08] wait cuz he had some work to finish he
[1:26:11] had to go to the souls in prison we we
[1:26:14] understand those things we're not going
[1:26:15] to go into great lengthy teachings but
[1:26:17] we want to keep it simple he said you
[1:26:20] wait cuz I'm going to come again and
[1:26:24] when that happens amen you will know
[1:26:29] that I'm in the father amen the father
[1:26:32] is in me and I'm in you now this is what
[1:26:37] we want to settled this
[1:26:39] morning it's an individual Affair it's
[1:26:42] not a group Affair you've got to come to
[1:26:46] the place that you answer that question
[1:26:49] in your heart is he in
[1:26:55] me if he's not it's okay you've got a
[1:27:03] promise you can have them come into you
[1:27:07] it's a very simple formula
[1:27:12] repent be honest with yourself be honest
[1:27:16] with your life these are the things I'm
[1:27:19] doing these are the things I'm staying
[1:27:21] the SE are the wages of sin is death the
[1:27:25] gift of God's eternal life I I I I
[1:27:28] recognize I'm weak I I I I recognize I'm
[1:27:32] a failure Lord I'm sorry I can't do it
[1:27:35] myself I don't have the ability in me
[1:27:38] I'm sorry I Repent amen and then when
[1:27:43] that repentance is sincere amen amen you
[1:27:47] you step into the pool of baptism in the
[1:27:50] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:53] and you're baptized for the remission of
[1:27:56] your sins that to let you
[1:28:00] know that you've done your part then he
[1:28:03] does his part and he
[1:28:06] says I promise
[1:28:09] you if you shall repent of your sins ye
[1:28:12] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:16] so in the beginning the question was
[1:28:19] these men are drunk yeah
[1:28:22] no they're not drunk as you would
[1:28:24] suppose this is what was promised that
[1:28:27] Joel prophesied I'll pour out my spirit
[1:28:32] upon my sons and my
[1:28:35] daughters so they saw that these men
[1:28:40] that were cowards a few hours ago are
[1:28:43] now have
[1:28:46] possession of
[1:28:47] something
[1:28:50] amen their faith was not
[1:28:56] intellectual their faith was
[1:29:01] possession something came into them amen
[1:29:05] and then when these men
[1:29:08] ask what must we
[1:29:11] do to get this Same
[1:29:16] Spirit that's dwelling in you dwelling
[1:29:20] in US amen amen that's what they wanted
[1:29:24] amen now see this is what the prophet of
[1:29:27] God's trying to get the church back to
[1:29:29] but the church has gone in
[1:29:34] elect they didn't have a
[1:29:37] Bible they didn't have a book they
[1:29:40] didn't have a tape they couldn't
[1:29:44] take the
[1:29:46] experience and then bring it to the
[1:29:49] letter and kill it
[1:29:54] for the letter
[1:29:56] kth but the spirit giveth life amen amen
[1:30:02] amen FK they had to have
[1:30:05] something that was
[1:30:07] genuine those men had to see the the
[1:30:11] evidence aren't these unlearned and
[1:30:13] ignorant
[1:30:15] men who are these
[1:30:18] guys speaking in unknown languages
[1:30:21] speaking all kinds of great works of the
[1:30:24] spirit of God moving so he had to give
[1:30:27] them
[1:30:31] something that was going to lead
[1:30:34] them and guide
[1:30:38] them remember they didn't have a
[1:30:42] book they didn't have a
[1:30:45] tape they didn't have a
[1:30:50] Bible but God was going to give them
[1:30:55] something that would that they would
[1:30:59] possess that would lead them and guide
[1:31:03] them into all
[1:31:05] truth and all
[1:31:09] righteousness now that's is where I'd
[1:31:11] like to
[1:31:12] start and keeping that thought in mind
[1:31:18] we want to listen to 29
[1:31:20] minutes and I I I I believe that our
[1:31:26] messenger's worth listening to am if he
[1:31:29] could absolutely tell us in
[1:31:32] 64 about a
[1:31:34] monster that was coming amen that was
[1:31:38] going to grip the
[1:31:40] people and it was going to make men want
[1:31:43] to be women and women want to be
[1:31:46] men I I think it would it would take
[1:31:51] behoove us
[1:31:53] to pay
[1:31:54] attention the message is
[1:31:58] leadership so picture
[1:32:01] these
[1:32:03] people our disciples without a
[1:32:07] book without a Bible without a tape they
[1:32:12] got to start their Journey they need
[1:32:16] something to lead them let's just listen
[1:32:20] the 29 minutes if you would of the book
[1:32:23] leadership we're starting at paragraph I
[1:32:27] think it's uh let me see if I can think
[1:32:30] of the paragraph we're starting at uh
[1:32:33] paragraph around paragraph
[1:32:36] 96 uh and uh and we're just going to go
[1:32:41] to about
[1:32:43] paragraph um somewhere paragraph uh one
[1:32:48] uh somewhere around 170 or or somewhere
[1:32:53] right in there but anyway the brothers
[1:32:55] know where to stop it listen this
[1:32:57] morning but I want you to listen it from
[1:33:00] the ears of the Prophet telling us you
[1:33:05] need something to lead
[1:33:07] you there's a great Dark Cloud out
[1:33:13] there that's trying to grip the
[1:33:16] people you can't
[1:33:18] navigate he said you can't get away from
[1:33:24] it now you know you we always say they
[1:33:28] can't get that's he said you got to
[1:33:30] watch this Dark Cloud if you don't watch
[1:33:32] it it's going to get you if you don't
[1:33:34] have something to lead you and guide you
[1:33:37] it's going to take hold of
[1:33:39] you so it's marvelous what we have in
[1:33:43] this hour so let us just listen as he's
[1:33:45] trying to uh uh put into our hearts the
[1:33:51] the importance of having leadership and
[1:33:55] then to tonight's communion uh we won't
[1:33:58] do um much preaching tonight we'll go
[1:34:00] straight into the communion service for
[1:34:02] all of you who know that if you want to
[1:34:05] make the Rapture you can you must take
[1:34:08] communion for those that don't you're on
[1:34:11] your
[1:34:12] own you know you can try to make it
[1:34:15] without it if you want
[1:34:16] to you know I just don't you just got to
[1:34:20] decide what's leading you you and where
[1:34:23] your priorities are but listen to how
[1:34:26] important leadership is God bless you 29
[1:34:30] minutes I think you can stay awake for
[1:34:32] that I hope amen God bless
[1:34:36] you the first step you've probably ever
[1:34:39] taken in your life speaking of
[1:34:41] leadership it was probably the hands of
[1:34:43] some kind old mother them hands may be
[1:34:46] still tonight out here in some Cemetery
[1:34:49] somewhere but that was a hand that held
[1:34:51] you to to make your first step then
[1:34:53] after your mother taught you how to walk
[1:34:56] and you make a few steps and fall down
[1:34:58] and get up and you thought you were
[1:35:00] doing great things then she turns you
[1:35:03] over to the school teacher and then she
[1:35:06] begin to lead you to an
[1:35:08] education how what you must do and how
[1:35:11] you must learn and and so forth like
[1:35:13] that then after the school teacher got
[1:35:16] through with you then you returned back
[1:35:18] your father got a hold of you then when
[1:35:21] your father got a hold of you he taught
[1:35:22] you perhaps your business how to be a
[1:35:25] successful businessman how to do things
[1:35:28] right your mother taught you how to be a
[1:35:31] a housewife how to cook and so forth
[1:35:33] like that then after they got through
[1:35:36] with you then your minister or priest
[1:35:39] got a hold of you but now who leads you
[1:35:43] that's the question now now we're all
[1:35:46] led by something tonight we have to be
[1:35:50] we're LED it
[1:35:52] notice now let's uh look at this young
[1:35:56] Fell's uh what had influenced him let's
[1:36:00] look at the uh this young businessman we
[1:36:03] would call him because he was a
[1:36:04] businessman he was a great successful
[1:36:06] man let's look at his leaders perhaps
[1:36:08] first his mother had taught him as a
[1:36:11] little boy the things that he should do
[1:36:14] his father had made him such a fine
[1:36:17] success and maybe left him left him an
[1:36:20] inheritance because because he was a
[1:36:22] ruler himself perhaps his father was
[1:36:25] gone so he is a a
[1:36:27] businessman he was uh let's call him
[1:36:30] today like a Christian businessman or he
[1:36:34] was a religious businessman I think
[1:36:36] would be the best quotation this man was
[1:36:38] religious he was by no means an Infidel
[1:36:41] and he had been taught by his mother how
[1:36:44] to do right how to walk how to addess
[1:36:47] himself he had been taught by his father
[1:36:49] a great business and how to be a
[1:36:51] successful man and his business was
[1:36:54] successful and father and mother had
[1:36:56] been raised up in the church and
[1:36:57] appointed him to the priest and the
[1:36:59] priest had made him a real religious man
[1:37:03] therefore he was a fine cultured man he
[1:37:06] was a fine a boy with good character if
[1:37:09] Jesus Christ looked at him and loved him
[1:37:11] there was something about the boy it was
[1:37:13] real right for the Bible said here we
[1:37:16] find out in Mark and Jesus beholding him
[1:37:18] loved him yeah Jesus beholding him loved
[1:37:21] him so therefore there must be something
[1:37:25] real outstanding about this young fellow
[1:37:29] he was had a good character a good
[1:37:31] character reading he was a man that was
[1:37:33] raised right intelligent smart
[1:37:35] intellectual successful in business and
[1:37:38] a religious man he had a lot of good
[1:37:41] characteristics that was outstanding so
[1:37:43] much that it attracted the attention of
[1:37:46] Jesus Christ the Savior but when he was
[1:37:49] confronted being successful in all these
[1:37:51] other things nothing had went wrong he
[1:37:54] was perfectly cut out right measured up
[1:37:58] right intelligent right education his
[1:38:01] success his smart a fine businessman
[1:38:04] probably belonged to a businessman's
[1:38:05] group somewhere there in Palestine he
[1:38:08] might have belonged to a businessman's
[1:38:10] fellowship like we have here
[1:38:12] tonight no doubt he did because
[1:38:15] businessman has always had fellowships
[1:38:17] with another one with the other because
[1:38:19] just like birds of a feather they have
[1:38:21] things to talk about and if it's the
[1:38:23] religious man they don't want to talk
[1:38:24] about the man that runs the bar room and
[1:38:26] the all of them together because they
[1:38:27] have nothing in common we've got to have
[1:38:30] things in common so Christians has
[1:38:32] things in common with Christians Sinners
[1:38:35] has things in common with with Sinners
[1:38:38] and and societies and whatever they are
[1:38:41] they have things in common this young
[1:38:43] boy probably belonged to a uh
[1:38:46] businessman's fellowship and he was
[1:38:49] religious as he could be because Jesus
[1:38:52] in questioning here he said I have kept
[1:38:55] these Commandments observed them all
[1:38:57] from my youth that's right see he had
[1:39:00] been brought up right taught right and
[1:39:01] everything but when he was confronted
[1:39:04] with the uh the thought of eternal
[1:39:09] life now I want you to notice with all
[1:39:12] this character that he had he yet knew
[1:39:15] he did not possess eternal
[1:39:20] life now all of our societies our church
[1:39:25] our
[1:39:26] membership and the things that we hold
[1:39:28] so dear our American
[1:39:32] societies and everything is very fine
[1:39:35] there's nothing to be said against that
[1:39:37] and our Christian businessman Society
[1:39:39] here is a great thing it's been an open
[1:39:42] door for me to on my interdenominational
[1:39:45] thoughts that we are Christians there is
[1:39:48] no one no one denomination can claim us
[1:39:52] real Christian because you belong to God
[1:39:54] denominations are
[1:39:55] man-made and Christianity is Heavens
[1:39:59] sent but in all these things that we
[1:40:02] have as good as they are as fine as we
[1:40:05] come together and As Nice of meetings as
[1:40:07] we have and social understanding that we
[1:40:10] have yet we are each one confronted with
[1:40:14] eternal life
[1:40:16] amen no matter how successful we've been
[1:40:19] in business how successful we've been
[1:40:22] and what a great church member we are
[1:40:23] how we work how we try to do things
[1:40:26] right still if it's not done in the
[1:40:28] right way it is a worship of God in
[1:40:33] vain Jesus cled that the same way as I
[1:40:36] stop here for a moment he said in vain
[1:40:39] do you worship me teaching for Doctrine
[1:40:41] the Commandments of man now I think of
[1:40:44] sincere honest worship with the
[1:40:48] sincerity of your heart to God and still
[1:40:51] be in
[1:40:52] vain it began that way with Cain at the
[1:40:56] Garden of Eden sincere worship but was
[1:41:01] rejected very religious still
[1:41:04] rejected a sort last week week before
[1:41:07] last at a businessman's meeting a
[1:41:09] breakfast there where several hundreds
[1:41:11] of people had gathered I took two and a
[1:41:13] half hours to speak on doing God a
[1:41:16] service without being God's
[1:41:18] will now that sounds strange
[1:41:21] strange but we've got to channel
[1:41:24] ourselves into God's provided
[1:41:27] Channel and God's way of doing it no
[1:41:30] matter how much we think it's right it's
[1:41:32] got to be according to the word of the
[1:41:34] Lord or it's in vain Cain worshiped but
[1:41:38] it wasn't according to the word of the
[1:41:40] Lord the Pharisees worshiped but not
[1:41:43] according to the word of the Lord and in
[1:41:45] this particular message to the
[1:41:47] businessman I taught this David he
[1:41:52] wanted to do the Lord a service and he
[1:41:54] was right in what he
[1:41:56] said he said is it right for the Ark of
[1:41:58] the Lord to be down there let's bring it
[1:41:59] up here in the days of the king the
[1:42:02] other king he succeeded he said it's not
[1:42:05] right they never consulted the Lord by
[1:42:07] the ark but we must do it now that's
[1:42:09] correct what they should have done he
[1:42:11] said we should go get the ark and we
[1:42:13] could consult the Lord and that's right
[1:42:16] it was down in another country said we
[1:42:17] got to bring it up here get it up here
[1:42:19] and put it in our house here and Worship
[1:42:21] the Lord now notice he went in the wrong
[1:42:25] channel to do
[1:42:26] it he consulted the captain of 50s and
[1:42:29] hundreds and thousands they all was
[1:42:32] consulted everyone seeing it was the
[1:42:34] will of the Lord look like or it was a
[1:42:36] the word of the Lord the word of the
[1:42:38] Lord sometimes you have to put it in its
[1:42:40] right place or it's not the will of the
[1:42:43] Lord I'll let that soap
[1:42:46] deep and you'll get a a general
[1:42:48] conception of what I'm trying to say I
[1:42:52] don't want the church to fall into the
[1:42:53] steps that you found over there in
[1:42:55] England long hair and painted faed man
[1:42:59] and perver we don't want
[1:43:03] that no matter how religious it sounds
[1:43:06] and how much Elvis Presley can sing
[1:43:08] religious songs he's still at evil I'm
[1:43:11] no judge but by their fruits you know
[1:43:14] them he's a Pentecostal but that don't
[1:43:16] make a bit of
[1:43:17] difference your fruits bear record what
[1:43:20] you are no matter if the spirit comes up
[1:43:22] on him he could speak in tongues he
[1:43:23] could shout he could heal the sick and
[1:43:25] Jesus said many of them will come to me
[1:43:27] in that day and say Lord Haven not done
[1:43:28] this and that and I say depart from me
[1:43:30] you that work iniquity I never even knew
[1:43:33] you we've got to be real genine
[1:43:37] Christians and the only way we can do
[1:43:39] that is confronted with this question
[1:43:41] here of eternal life there's only one
[1:43:44] form of eternal life and that comes from
[1:43:46] God and he for ordained every creature
[1:43:48] that would ever have it just just as you
[1:43:51] was a Jane in your father you was a Jane
[1:43:53] in God one of his attributes to begin
[1:43:56] with or you'll never be there you come
[1:43:59] forth in the beding ground of your
[1:44:01] mother your father didn't know you you
[1:44:03] were in his Lawns and when you come
[1:44:05] forth in the bedding ground of the
[1:44:06] mother then you become a human being and
[1:44:09] made in the image of your father now you
[1:44:11] can fellowship with him in the same
[1:44:13] thing by God if you got eternal life the
[1:44:16] life that you come in the Natural Life
[1:44:18] physical life that was by your father
[1:44:20] and the only way you can come born again
[1:44:22] is the only way is it has to be from
[1:44:24] your heavenly father is attributes all
[1:44:27] the father has given me will come to
[1:44:30] me see you are here because your name
[1:44:33] were placed on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:44:36] before there was even a foundation of
[1:44:38] the world that's exactly right you're a
[1:44:40] Jane a spiritual Jane out of your
[1:44:43] heavenly father a part of God's word
[1:44:47] that be so as I've said then you was
[1:44:49] with Jesus when he was sh because he was
[1:44:51] the word amen you suffered with him died
[1:44:54] with him buried with him and Rose with
[1:44:55] him and now sitting in Heavenly places
[1:44:57] in him notice David thought everything
[1:45:01] was fine and he consulted all these
[1:45:03] people and they everyone be to dance and
[1:45:06] shout and scream they had all the
[1:45:08] religious motions that there was but
[1:45:10] still it wasn't God's will to go down
[1:45:13] and bring the word of God back to the
[1:45:15] house of God but you see God always in
[1:45:18] all ages Works through one way his first
[1:45:22] decision is his only decision because
[1:45:24] he's perfect in his
[1:45:27] decisions he never does nothing except
[1:45:30] he first reveals it to his servants the
[1:45:32] prophets exactly that's why this the
[1:45:35] church age that we live in there's no
[1:45:37] church no Methodist Baptist Pentecostals
[1:45:39] or anything else can ever put this
[1:45:41] church into the bride it'll have to be
[1:45:43] the answering of Malachi four for God to
[1:45:45] send a prophet to be revealed to because
[1:45:47] that's the only way our churches
[1:45:49] denominate and throw the thing into a
[1:45:51] mess and huddle it's like they've always
[1:45:52] been and God always sends the prophets
[1:45:56] and there was Nathan standing in the
[1:45:58] land of Vindicated Prophet before God
[1:46:00] and he wasn't even
[1:46:02] consulted and they went down there and
[1:46:04] cus the life of an honest man and so
[1:46:06] forth and took the ark instead of
[1:46:08] putting on the shoulders of the Levites
[1:46:09] to pack it they put it on a cart to pack
[1:46:11] it all together messed up uh you see if
[1:46:14] you don't go according to the the will
[1:46:17] of God and the way that God has give us
[1:46:19] to go they all always get it messed up
[1:46:21] and take it off in some organization
[1:46:22] denomination some message and there you
[1:46:24] go see it's always been done that way
[1:46:27] that's the same thing that this boy was
[1:46:29] confronted with he come in he' been a a
[1:46:32] a member of maybe the Pharisees or
[1:46:34] Sadducees or some great uh order of that
[1:46:37] day he was religious as he could be he
[1:46:39] said I've observed these Commandments
[1:46:41] that have been taught since it was a
[1:46:43] youth see and Jesus loved him for it but
[1:46:47] he refused to be guided he he refused to
[1:46:52] accept the real leadership of Jesus
[1:46:55] Christ to give him eternal
[1:46:57] life notice he believed there was
[1:47:00] something different than what he had or
[1:47:02] he would have never said good Master
[1:47:06] what must I do now see he want to do
[1:47:08] something himself that's way we do we
[1:47:10] want to do something our the gift of God
[1:47:12] is a free gift God give it to you don't
[1:47:15] do one thing for it he ordained it to
[1:47:18] you and you're going to have it see
[1:47:20] notice he knew it was there he believed
[1:47:22] in it and wanted it but when he was
[1:47:24] confronted with how he had to do it it
[1:47:27] was different from his ritual it was
[1:47:29] different he could hold his money and
[1:47:30] belong on to the church that he belonged
[1:47:32] to and so forth but Jesus knew that and
[1:47:35] knew it hoarded this money and he said
[1:47:37] go sell all you've got and give it to
[1:47:39] the poor and come take up your cross and
[1:47:41] follow me and you'll have Treasures in
[1:47:43] Heaven but he couldn't do it the other
[1:47:46] leaders that he had had in his youthful
[1:47:48] days had such an influence on him till
[1:47:51] he refused to accept God's provided way
[1:47:55] which was Jesus Christ the only one who
[1:47:58] holds eternal life the only one that can
[1:48:01] give you not the church can't give you
[1:48:03] eternal life not your neighbor not your
[1:48:05] pastor not your
[1:48:06] priest not your Creed only Jesus Christ
[1:48:10] himself can give you eternal life no
[1:48:14] matter how good you are what you quit
[1:48:15] doing what you start doing you've got to
[1:48:18] accept the person amen of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:21] Christ then when you do that he is the
[1:48:24] word and then your life fits right in
[1:48:27] the word and it manifest itself to this
[1:48:30] age that you're living in Noah had to do
[1:48:32] that for the word to be manifested in
[1:48:34] his age now what if Moses come along and
[1:48:37] said we know what Noah done we'll take
[1:48:39] Noah's uh word we'll do it this way Noah
[1:48:42] did it we'll build a Ark and float down
[1:48:45] the aisle River and go out of Egypt what
[1:48:47] wouldn't have work see that was another
[1:48:49] age Jesus couldn't have come with Moses
[1:48:52] message Luther couldn't come with the
[1:48:55] Catholic message Wesley couldn't come
[1:48:57] with the Luther's message the Pentecost
[1:49:00] couldn't come with the Wesley message
[1:49:02] and the bride can't be formed in the
[1:49:04] Pentecostal denomination it just can't
[1:49:06] do it that's exactly right she's done
[1:49:09] organized and went out here and there
[1:49:10] she sits just like the rest of them it's
[1:49:12] a shook just like the life comes up to
[1:49:14] the see that writer as I spoke the other
[1:49:17] night that writer that wrote this book
[1:49:19] not he criticized me so bad said I was
[1:49:21] the devil U if there was such a thing so
[1:49:24] he said he didn't believe in God he said
[1:49:26] a God that could fold his arms and set
[1:49:28] up and watch them Martyrs through the
[1:49:31] early ages and claimed to have power to
[1:49:33] open the Red Sea and let them women and
[1:49:36] children be tore to Pieces by lines and
[1:49:38] so forth and then said he was a loving
[1:49:40] God so there's no such a creature see
[1:49:42] the fellow without inspiration of the
[1:49:44] word fails to see it the first corn of
[1:49:47] wheat the bridegroom had to fall into
[1:49:50] the the Earth in order to rise again so
[1:49:53] did the first bride that was born at
[1:49:56] Pentecost had to go through that Dark
[1:49:58] Ages like any other seed be buried they
[1:50:01] had to die they must do it but it
[1:50:04] started sprouting again and Luther in
[1:50:06] the First Reformation it did look like
[1:50:09] the seed that when it was the light of
[1:50:11] that day the L St then went on into the
[1:50:13] tosel Wesley and from the tossel it went
[1:50:16] into Pentecost the shov when you see
[1:50:18] into the the whe when it comes forth the
[1:50:20] corn of wheat a man that's raised wheat
[1:50:23] you go out and see that wheat farm in
[1:50:24] there it looks just exactly like the
[1:50:26] grain but if you'll take a tweezer and
[1:50:28] sit down and take that wheat and open it
[1:50:30] up there's no grain there at all it's
[1:50:32] just a Shook and then what is it's Farm
[1:50:36] there to hold the green see and then the
[1:50:38] first thing you know the life left the
[1:50:40] the the stalk to go into the tossle left
[1:50:43] the tossle go into the shook it leaves
[1:50:45] the Shook and goes into the wheat three
[1:50:47] stages see of it and then forms the
[1:50:50] wheat outside of the three stages Luther
[1:50:54] Wesley Pentecost just exactly see no
[1:50:58] doubt you can't interrupt nature now
[1:51:00] look every three years after a message
[1:51:03] has went forth sent from God they
[1:51:05] organized this has been 20 years and
[1:51:08] there's no organization it won't see now
[1:51:11] the Shu has to pull away give the wheed
[1:51:13] a chance to lay before the sun to ripen
[1:51:16] um the message coming right back into
[1:51:19] the church again forming the body of
[1:51:21] Jesus Christ just like the first rig one
[1:51:23] that went into the ground now to see go
[1:51:26] the eternal life the life sure the the
[1:51:30] stalk back here carried the life
[1:51:33] certainly it did but you see when it
[1:51:35] become the stalk and it was finished the
[1:51:37] organization the life went right on into
[1:51:40] Wesley come right out one and watch each
[1:51:43] one of them one a big blade don't look
[1:51:44] like the grain but when the little
[1:51:46] pollen comes like the on the the sh on
[1:51:49] the stock the pollen of the tossel it
[1:51:52] looks a whole lot like the green but
[1:51:53] when it comes down to that shook it's
[1:51:56] almost there did Jesus say in the last
[1:52:00] days Matthew 24:24 the two would be so
[1:52:03] close it would deceive the very
[1:52:05] Janss predestinated the elected ones if
[1:52:10] it was possible almost like the real
[1:52:13] things so in the last days now you see
[1:52:16] it's wheat time now it's getting Harvest
[1:52:19] Time
[1:52:20] this is not Luther's age this is not
[1:52:22] Pentecost age this is a bride age as
[1:52:25] Moses called a nation out of a Nation
[1:52:29] Christ today is calling a church out of
[1:52:31] a church you see the same thing in type
[1:52:33] take them to the Glorious Eternal
[1:52:35] promised land now to refuse that person
[1:52:39] that's doing the calling Christ no
[1:52:41] matter if you're Pentecostal Methodist
[1:52:43] Luther whatever you are you got to this
[1:52:46] age nothing against them not at all but
[1:52:50] in this age now you've got to accept
[1:52:53] like they did in that age the person of
[1:52:56] Christ which is the word in the
[1:52:58] beginning was the word and the word is
[1:53:00] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:53:02] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:53:05] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:53:07] Hebrews 138 see you must accept that
[1:53:11] person of eternal life and what life
[1:53:14] Luther had was justification Wesley had
[1:53:18] sanctification added to it the Pentecost
[1:53:20] had the restoration of the gifts coming
[1:53:22] back and added to it but now it's
[1:53:24] completing in the body you see the three
[1:53:26] phases of it and out of that now when
[1:53:28] the Resurrection comes the life that
[1:53:31] lived in them lutherans just went out
[1:53:32] the life that lived in the methodists
[1:53:34] went out the life that went in the
[1:53:35] Pentecostals will all be raptured out of
[1:53:38] the ground in the body of the Bride to
[1:53:41] be taken in before Jesus Christ glory to
[1:53:45] God oh it's
[1:53:48] exciting it's the truth hallelujah we've
[1:53:52] turned a corner hallelujah we're looking
[1:53:54] towards
[1:53:55] heaven watching farther coming a cap on
[1:53:58] the pyramid as we would say it's coming
[1:54:01] back The Church Must Be resurrected soon
[1:54:05] and we must get ready and the only way
[1:54:07] you can is not say well I belong to the
[1:54:09] assemblies I belong to the Oneness Tess
[1:54:12] or whatever it is all them there I
[1:54:13] belong to the Church of God that don't
[1:54:15] mean a thing Our Father shouted and
[1:54:17] danced that's perfectly all right that
[1:54:19] was their day but today you're
[1:54:21] confronted not with the organization
[1:54:23] that they made but with the life that's
[1:54:25] going on which is Jesus
[1:54:28] Christ this young fellow had done the
[1:54:30] same thing Moses wrote those
[1:54:32] Commandments but you see the same God
[1:54:35] that wrote The Commandments by his
[1:54:37] Prophet was the same thing it prophesied
[1:54:39] the day would come I'll raise up a
[1:54:41] prophet like it unto me and it'll come
[1:54:43] to pass that all that don't hear him
[1:54:45] will be cut off back in the
[1:54:47] denominational Shucks and toses they
[1:54:49] must go on to life and today don't say
[1:54:52] I'm Pentecost I belong to this I belong
[1:54:54] to that that don't mean
[1:54:56] nothing you've got to accept the person
[1:54:59] Christ eternal life confronts every one
[1:55:02] of us don't forget that the other
[1:55:05] leaders you see it had such a hold on it
[1:55:07] there people just talk well we belong to
[1:55:09] this and we belong to that and had such
[1:55:10] a hold on it but what a fatal thing to
[1:55:13] reject the leadership of eternal life
[1:55:18] now that life is present tonight
[1:55:20] amen that's right the holy spirit is
[1:55:22] your which is Christ in spirit form his
[1:55:25] Spirit the anointing is your a little
[1:55:28] while the world seeth me no more yet ye
[1:55:30] will see me for I'll be with you even in
[1:55:32] you to the consummation to the end of
[1:55:35] the world Jesus alone can lead you to
[1:55:38] that eternal life there's no church no
[1:55:41] denomination no preacher no priest no
[1:55:43] nothing else can lead you to it you must
[1:55:47] be led by him amen the only one that can
[1:55:51] lead you could you imagine him leading
[1:55:53] you out of his word which that's him and
[1:55:56] if he is the word and you're a part of
[1:55:58] him won't you be a part of the word the
[1:56:00] word that God wants to pour the Waters
[1:56:03] of Salvation upon today to identify him
[1:56:08] today like the apostles identified him
[1:56:11] like Luther like Wesley like the people
[1:56:13] in them days identified him this is
[1:56:14] another age it's a word the word said
[1:56:18] these things that we're seeing taking
[1:56:19] place now is predicted to take place in
[1:56:21] this hour so accept Jesus Christ and let
[1:56:25] him lead you to the eternal life though
[1:56:28] he had achieved this young fellow he had
[1:56:30] achieved all good things in school been
[1:56:33] fine as a good boy no doubt he' been
[1:56:36] good as a real father and listened to
[1:56:39] his daddy and business he'd been a good
[1:56:41] a good boy good to his parents he' been
[1:56:44] loyal to his priest he' been loyal to
[1:56:46] his church he had been loyal to the
[1:56:48] Commandments of God but but he lost the
[1:56:51] greatest thing and the rest of them
[1:56:53] didn't mean very much to him when he
[1:56:54] turned down the leadership of eternal
[1:56:58] life Jesus
[1:57:01] Christ
[1:57:02] notice this leadership confronts every
[1:57:06] one of us today the same thing as it did
[1:57:09] that young man we no matter how
[1:57:11] religious we are you may be Catholic you
[1:57:13] may be Baptist Methodist or you may be
[1:57:15] Pentecostals or whatever you are this
[1:57:17] same thing confronts you tonight amen
[1:57:20] eternal life that's acceptance of Jesus
[1:57:24] Christ we are given this opportunity
[1:57:26] sometime in life we have to confront the
[1:57:28] thing just like this young man did
[1:57:30] because you are a mortal being and
[1:57:33] you're giving the you're giving the
[1:57:35] opportunity of choice you have a choice
[1:57:39] God made it so you can choose if he put
[1:57:41] Adam and Eve on free moral agency so
[1:57:43] they could choose and then they made the
[1:57:45] wrong choice and see he can do no more
[1:57:48] to you than he did to them he's got to
[1:57:50] put you the same thing so you can choose
[1:57:53] or reject you have a choice let's look
[1:57:55] at some of them you have a choice as a
[1:57:57] young man whether you're going to have
[1:57:58] an education or not you have that choice
[1:58:01] you can want to just not to have it you
[1:58:02] can just refuse it you have a choice of
[1:58:04] your cond up I'm going to hurt just a
[1:58:07] little bit here you can go out and let
[1:58:09] your hair grow down and be a beetle or
[1:58:11] some of these
[1:58:12] ignoramuses are you women you can look
[1:58:14] like a a decent human being or you can
[1:58:17] be one of these weired creatures that we
[1:58:19] have out there that glued eyes and
[1:58:21] Waterhead haircuts and things are
[1:58:23] completely against the word of God which
[1:58:25] is absolutely contrary not even offer
[1:58:28] couldn't offer a prayer to be accepted
[1:58:30] that's true exactly right it's what the
[1:58:34] Bible
[1:58:35] said but what's happened to you church
[1:58:38] you've seen so much television so much
[1:58:41] things the world it's so easy for your
[1:58:43] old Adam nature to drift into that to
[1:58:45] act like the rest of
[1:58:47] them may I repeat this again again in
[1:58:50] the kosha in the offering of the the the
[1:58:54] atonement in the days of Moses when
[1:58:56] Moses brought the children out there was
[1:58:58] to be seven days that there was to be no
[1:59:01] 11 among the people anyone knows that in
[1:59:04] Exodus no 11 should be found in your
[1:59:07] camp at all seven days that seven days
[1:59:10] represent the full seven Church ages
[1:59:12] amen no 11 now you can't do it you've
[1:59:18] got to come to one thing to believe
[1:59:21] you're either going to believe God
[1:59:22] you're going to believe your church
[1:59:24] you're going to believe the world you're
[1:59:25] you cannot mix it
[1:59:28] together and you can't hold of them old
[1:59:30] things that the other Church before you
[1:59:32] did you've got to take the message of
[1:59:34] the hour he said what was left over
[1:59:37] don't let it stay till morning to come
[1:59:39] into this other age burn it with fire be
[1:59:42] destroyed that the age that you're
[1:59:44] living in the message of this age has
[1:59:47] got to be brought out of the scriptures
[1:59:49] and Vindicated and proved by God that
[1:59:52] it's God doing so then you either
[1:59:55] receive that or reject it that's eternal
[1:59:58] life Leadership of the Holy Spirit
[2:00:00] leading his
[2:00:01] church we can stay on that a long time
[2:00:04] let's move just keep moving along the
[2:00:06] choice of your conduct you could you
[2:00:10] can't mix it now you're either for God
[2:00:12] or against God and the outward
[2:00:15] Expressions shows exactly what's on the
[2:00:17] inside amen
[2:00:20] the cucker many of you think I got the
[2:00:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to
[2:00:24] heaven that don't mean one thing that
[2:00:26] you're going to heaven no sir you can
[2:00:28] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[2:00:29] hour in your life and still be lost and
[2:00:31] go to hell the Bible says so it's
[2:00:35] exactly right look here you are a
[2:00:38] outside person you have five senses that
[2:00:40] contacts that outside body God gave you
[2:00:42] five senses not to contact him your
[2:00:44] Earthly home SE taste feel smell and
[2:00:46] here then you have a spirit on the
[2:00:48] inside of that and it has five Outlets
[2:00:50] conscience and love and so forth five
[2:00:52] Outlets that you contact the spirit
[2:00:54] world with that but with your spirit
[2:00:58] your physical contacts the physical your
[2:01:00] spiritual contacts the spiritual but
[2:01:03] inside of that you've got a
[2:01:05] soul that soul is that
[2:01:08] janeen that come from God and like a
[2:01:12] baby formed in its mother's womb when
[2:01:14] the baby comes into the uh to the
[2:01:16] mother's womb but the little germ crawls
[2:01:19] into the egg it doesn't form one cell a
[2:01:21] human the next a dog the next a cat the
[2:01:23] next a horse it's all human cells
[2:01:27] because it's building off of an original
[2:01:29] human cell and when a man has been born
[2:01:33] again by the word of God predestinated
[2:01:36] to eternal life called the
[2:01:38] elected it'll be word of God on top of
[2:01:41] word word on word not a denomination a
[2:01:44] Creed and then a word and a Creed it
[2:01:46] won't work you can't have that LE in it
[2:01:49] only one eternal life Jesus Christ the
[2:01:53] word in the beginning was the word the
[2:01:56] word was with God and the Word was God
[2:01:58] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[2:02:00] Among Us friends you feed my children
[2:02:04] you send me across of mission fields to
[2:02:05] the world to bring the message I got to
[2:02:08] be sincere with you what I'm looking at
[2:02:11] maybe you don't see that's what I'm here
[2:02:13] to try to tell you it's not because I
[2:02:15] don't love people it's because I do love
[2:02:18] people Hallelujah corrective when I see
[2:02:21] the slipping of the church going all say
[2:02:23] well we did this and we did that and
[2:02:25] look around over the church and see the
[2:02:26] it just won't work then look here in the
[2:02:28] Bible and see it's got to be that way at
[2:02:29] the end that lukewarm Lady of see Church
[2:02:31] age putting Jesus out the word you never
[2:02:34] call you go call church he said as many
[2:02:37] as I love I
[2:02:39] rebuke I chasten them amen taking the
[2:02:42] word and pound it on and telling you're
[2:02:44] wrong in it that's the reason I love you
[2:02:47] if you'll open the door let me in I'll
[2:02:49] come in and suck with you not a church
[2:02:52] she's done put out of that she's headed
[2:02:54] for The ecumenical council that's where
[2:02:56] she's gone right back in the room where
[2:02:59] she come from and that exactly I got
[2:03:01] that wrote on paper from 25 years ago 33
[2:03:04] years ago and there it is not only that
[2:03:06] wrote in the Bible from En Vision she's
[2:03:08] gone back there's no way of saving it's
[2:03:10] gone it's going to be that way God's
[2:03:12] calling individuals I stand at the door
[2:03:15] and knock If any man any person one
[2:03:18] individual out of a
[2:03:20] thousand it might be one out of a
[2:03:32] million I could preach two
[2:03:34] years and not cover what we just
[2:03:40] heard I mean there there's so many
[2:03:44] things but we're just trying to keep it
[2:03:47] in our little thought of of where we're
[2:03:50] at today just to awaken ourselves to all
[2:03:55] the things that were said that there's a
[2:04:00] way that seems right unto a man and and
[2:04:04] that so we're looking at this
[2:04:07] church
[2:04:08] and they they didn't have anything to
[2:04:12] make the choices
[2:04:15] with so we what what I I'm trying to get
[2:04:19] at is is
[2:04:22] that intellect was not the way that God
[2:04:26] chose to run the church or by knowledge
[2:04:31] amen you understand so he doesn't change
[2:04:34] so what he did in the beginning the way
[2:04:37] he started his church and the way he
[2:04:40] founded his church was the way that he
[2:04:43] wanted that church to
[2:04:46] continue and it was by the end
[2:04:48] individual
[2:04:50] Affair of each individual accepting the
[2:04:54] person of Jesus Christ and having that
[2:04:58] leadership and so what slipped out of
[2:05:01] the
[2:05:02] church what is the
[2:05:05] leadership of the Holy
[2:05:08] Spirit men and women being led by the
[2:05:12] spirit of God these people they didn't
[2:05:15] have a book to go to they didn't have a
[2:05:18] Bible to go
[2:05:22] to they they had to go to
[2:05:25] prayer they had to go into the presence
[2:05:28] of the Lord amen and have the spirit of
[2:05:32] God give them holy unction they they
[2:05:35] they they had to be moved upon by the
[2:05:38] spirit of God and if you start reading
[2:05:40] your Bible from that aspect you start
[2:05:43] seeing he said God has given us a holy
[2:05:46] unction so he's bringing the church back
[2:05:50] he he he he he's bringing the church
[2:05:52] back to that Affair that they have where
[2:05:56] they come into His
[2:05:58] presence and they have to hear from him
[2:06:01] they have a choice that lays before him
[2:06:04] they have all kinds of voices around
[2:06:06] them everybody giv them bits of
[2:06:08] knowledge you should do this you should
[2:06:10] do that you should do that they didn't
[2:06:13] have a book to go to they didn't have a
[2:06:15] Bible to go to they didn't have a tape
[2:06:18] to listen
[2:06:20] too they they had to have the the spirit
[2:06:25] of God speak to them
[2:06:28] expressly the spirit SP in their heart
[2:06:31] they had to have that
[2:06:34] relationship and each of you and myself
[2:06:38] all of us together we we've got to make
[2:06:42] sure that uh relationship is established
[2:06:47] we we've got to we've got to know cuz
[2:06:49] that's what he gave the church now he
[2:06:52] says now knowledge is not
[2:06:56] leadership
[2:06:58] am you you understand that knowledge is
[2:07:02] not
[2:07:03] leadership and that what you can do you
[2:07:05] can have a Bible and have all kinds of
[2:07:08] knowledge amen amen you can have a book
[2:07:13] and have all kinds of knowledge you can
[2:07:16] listen to a tape and have all all kinds
[2:07:18] of knowledge the the the word
[2:07:22] is the word doesn't Quicken you it's the
[2:07:26] spirit that quickens you it's the spark
[2:07:31] that word won't move unless the spirit
[2:07:34] of God reveals that word to you and
[2:07:37] leads you in the way to be
[2:07:40] moved and so this is what's happened
[2:07:43] that what what happened is the church
[2:07:46] replaced leadership with knowledge they
[2:07:50] PE leadership with education they they
[2:07:54] they they replace
[2:07:57] leadership with doctrines and Creeds and
[2:08:00] and
[2:08:01] interpretations and so what what you can
[2:08:04] do with knowledge you can take that that
[2:08:07] knowledge and do what you want to or
[2:08:10] what you think with it
[2:08:16] amen you can just take the Bible and
[2:08:19] interpret it anyway you say that's not
[2:08:22] true go down the street every corner has
[2:08:25] got a building on it that says this is
[2:08:28] the way we interpret the Bible
[2:08:32] right this is what our knowledge has
[2:08:35] brought us
[2:08:39] to you know my mother's a Catholic and
[2:08:43] and uh you know lesli and I'll be at the
[2:08:45] house and she'll have the rosary on her
[2:08:48] TV you know we'll have to listen to the
[2:08:50] rosary you know you know the rosary is a
[2:08:54] kind of a shape beads and you say three
[2:08:57] hell mares and five our fathers and
[2:09:00] Glory bees and and they'll just be in
[2:09:02] there praying you know they don't ask
[2:09:05] God for anything it's just it it's just
[2:09:07] so ritualistic that but you ought to
[2:09:09] hear them
[2:09:11] talk oh they quote about the Lord and
[2:09:14] they talk about the spirit of the Lord
[2:09:16] and the goodness of God and everything
[2:09:19] totally
[2:09:21] oblivious if you would say that they're
[2:09:24] the that the Pope the Vicor of Christ is
[2:09:26] the Antichrist Church the mark of the
[2:09:29] beast why they didn't they would never
[2:09:31] believe any of
[2:09:33] that but you're
[2:09:37] elected you weren't elected to
[2:09:40] intellect you weren't elected the
[2:09:42] knowledge you weren't elected to have me
[2:09:45] come here and teach you my Revel
[2:09:49] ation that's right you're elected to
[2:09:53] know that you can have an individual
[2:09:57] relationship and God can lead you and
[2:10:00] guide you into all truth and
[2:10:04] righteousness that you'll have choices
[2:10:07] put before you and you don't want to
[2:10:10] make those choices by
[2:10:15] intellect even when you listen to a tape
[2:10:18] we just listen to a tape there was so
[2:10:20] much in that tape that that was meat
[2:10:23] upon
[2:10:25] meat that was steak that was that was uh
[2:10:29] roasts that was I mean I couldn't
[2:10:32] Express that's the whole
[2:10:37] cow it's phenomenal what we just
[2:10:41] heard and he's saying I'm seeing the
[2:10:43] church
[2:10:44] slip I love you I'm trying to tell you
[2:10:47] something the church has lost its
[2:10:50] leadership you've got to ask
[2:10:54] yourself do I have leadership in my life
[2:10:58] and is my leadership from him or am I
[2:11:01] just set a
[2:11:04] drift am I just going through every day
[2:11:07] making choices in decisions not knowing
[2:11:11] where those choices and decisions are
[2:11:13] taking
[2:11:16] me look at that first church when I
[2:11:20] think of them I think that those those
[2:11:22] they had to they they how did they make
[2:11:25] their
[2:11:27] choices they didn't have anything to
[2:11:31] read they didn't have anything to listen
[2:11:34] to they made their choices by prayer and
[2:11:37] fellowship one with
[2:11:40] another they made their choices by
[2:11:43] waiting for his presence to come down
[2:11:47] and get an unction
[2:11:48] and get a
[2:11:50] revelation it's like a young man meeting
[2:11:53] a woman she may be she may be very
[2:11:58] beautiful you understand but a beautiful
[2:12:02] girl can hit you with the
[2:12:06] pan you know you need to get down till
[2:12:09] you you have that satisfaction in Your
[2:12:13] Heart Lord I really feel that this is
[2:12:16] the way that that I need to
[2:12:20] go until you're
[2:12:23] satisfied same thing you're not
[2:12:25] attracted by the outward senses you're
[2:12:27] not attracted by those things you're
[2:12:29] attracted by what's in your heart what's
[2:12:32] in your soul that part of you that's God
[2:12:35] you've got a part inside of you that's
[2:12:37] God that's what you need to get Quicken
[2:12:40] and relationship and brought
[2:12:43] life you can have the word on all these
[2:12:46] other dimensions but we want that word
[2:12:49] to connect with the part of God that's
[2:12:53] us then that's where we make our choices
[2:12:56] amen that's what we they made their
[2:12:58] choices through through uh
[2:13:02] uh they made their choices by by by
[2:13:07] Prayer by getting in the
[2:13:10] spirit by having the Holy Spirit move on
[2:13:13] them by holy
[2:13:14] unction until they knew it was God they
[2:13:17] prayed through
[2:13:18] true now the message
[2:13:22] didn't take that away from us it tried
[2:13:25] to restore it back to us that's right
[2:13:30] the messenger was trying to restore it
[2:13:32] back to us that God still speaks he
[2:13:35] still moves he still can do exceedingly
[2:13:37] and abundantly above what you can ask or
[2:13:40] think he can still heal he can still
[2:13:42] deliver am am he's not
[2:13:46] dead amen get them out of your mind and
[2:13:49] into your
[2:13:51] heart but you can take all these other
[2:13:57] things and and you can make a choice
[2:14:00] based on
[2:14:04] this and still not be his
[2:14:10] will
[2:14:12] because we have that nature we wanted
[2:14:14] our
[2:14:16] way but when we can push past
[2:14:20] that and come to that leadership look at
[2:14:23] this
[2:14:24] church look at this first church they
[2:14:27] they couldn't they they only had one
[2:14:30] thing to explain their
[2:14:33] choices and that was their life
[2:14:36] am they only had one thing to back up
[2:14:39] their words that was their life you can
[2:14:43] take this book and argue with somebody
[2:14:46] and say it's here it's here you can live
[2:14:47] any way you want to and take this
[2:14:51] book you you don't even have to live
[2:14:54] right you can just hand somebody a
[2:14:56] book this is what I'm trying to tell
[2:15:00] you
[2:15:02] no let your light so shine amongst men
[2:15:06] that your good works glorify your father
[2:15:08] in Heaven it wasn't
[2:15:11] meant to be brought down to just a
[2:15:14] mechanical
[2:15:16] device this word that was brought in our
[2:15:20] day was returning this church back to
[2:15:25] the same leadership that they had at the
[2:15:28] day of Pentecost it was restoring back
[2:15:31] the faith now we had a sheep offering we
[2:15:36] had a light we had somebody that was
[2:15:39] standing in front of us that was led by
[2:15:43] that
[2:15:45] Spirit he was an influenced by cre he
[2:15:48] wasn't influenced by Doctrine he wasn't
[2:15:50] influenced by money he was the first
[2:15:53] fruit of that church rising up amen
[2:15:57] that's right now when Jesus was the
[2:15:59] first fruit of that church he rose up he
[2:16:03] said the works that I do you shall do
[2:16:05] also because I send you a comforter I
[2:16:10] will come again I'll be with you I'll be
[2:16:13] in you and that day you'll
[2:16:16] know
[2:16:19] amen that the word's in you and that
[2:16:22] word is not going to be contrary to what
[2:16:25] was written what was spoken or what was
[2:16:28] printed
[2:16:31] amen but we don't want a
[2:16:34] manade
[2:16:36] substitute now someone's going to say oh
[2:16:38] brother McGary don't believe in the
[2:16:40] Bible he don't believe in the books he
[2:16:41] don't believe in the tape's right amen I
[2:16:43] just played the tape I read the Bible
[2:16:47] and I I showed you the
[2:16:49] book amen I I don't I don't care I
[2:16:54] preached a sermon one day and someone
[2:16:56] come up to me after service says man I
[2:16:58] see you don't believe in Preachers
[2:17:03] either
[2:17:05] really thank you that's like saying oh
[2:17:08] you're the biggest hypocrite I've ever
[2:17:10] met
[2:17:12] no what what I'm trying to say is you've
[2:17:15] got the battles in your mind
[2:17:18] amen you got to battle the
[2:17:21] process of taking the intellect here
[2:17:27] taking the intellect here or listening
[2:17:30] to what that you want to hear and bring
[2:17:34] yourself under the leadership of the
[2:17:38] spirit that the spirit can Quicken this
[2:17:42] to you can Quicken this to you can
[2:17:45] Quicken what you he to you he can supply
[2:17:48] the leadership in what you're hearing
[2:17:51] Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the
[2:17:53] word of God but it takes the spirit life
[2:17:57] of the word to Quicken the
[2:18:01] seed and that's what we've got to see
[2:18:04] that that this final maturity that we're
[2:18:07] coming to is a body of Believers not
[2:18:12] resting on the
[2:18:16] intellect and what he said this he said
[2:18:21] that but what he said now comes to
[2:18:26] manifestation In the Flesh and now it
[2:18:29] becomes a
[2:18:31] light cuz he said there shall be light
[2:18:34] in the evening time the path to Glory
[2:18:37] you shall surely find and so it it
[2:18:40] begins our
[2:18:42] approach begins to
[2:18:44] change when we read this we read it it
[2:18:49] ought to press
[2:18:50] us to him amen am what do you mean Lord
[2:18:56] reveal this to me speak to me Lead Me
[2:19:01] Not oh I've got
[2:19:03] it I understand that now it's going to
[2:19:07] become a
[2:19:10] buzzword the church is almost run by
[2:19:14] buzzwords every preacher's got these
[2:19:17] little buzzwords they say and just the
[2:19:19] people just makes the people jump and
[2:19:21] jerk and and
[2:19:25] everything they got
[2:19:27] quotes they just quote them
[2:19:31] out but it it doesn't go outside the
[2:19:36] walls these disciples the the only way
[2:19:40] that they could back up what they were
[2:19:42] saying was with their
[2:19:46] life
[2:19:48] they couldn't say well see it says here
[2:19:51] no they were what written Epistles read
[2:19:55] of all men now when you go back and read
[2:19:58] the Bible you can understand these men
[2:20:01] that were writing these letters were
[2:20:03] writing these letters to people that
[2:20:05] didn't have a Bible they didn't have a
[2:20:07] book they didn't have a tape they were
[2:20:09] talking from life
[2:20:13] experience they knew that what they
[2:20:15] possessed what it
[2:20:18] produced amen so they were without a
[2:20:21] Bible they were without a a book they
[2:20:24] were without a tape but they were
[2:20:27] possessors of eternal
[2:20:32] life and nobody understood what was
[2:20:35] leading
[2:20:37] them except if they were led by the same
[2:20:42] thing and then that was the body and the
[2:20:46] fellowship men and women led by the
[2:20:50] spirit of God the prophet of God
[2:20:51] preached leadership it was one of the
[2:20:53] last messages he
[2:20:55] preached telling the
[2:20:58] church can't go off the
[2:21:01] Creeds you can't go after do all he had
[2:21:05] was the
[2:21:07] Bible but I believe he knew the books
[2:21:09] would come after and the tapes were come
[2:21:10] and I'm glad for every one of them I
[2:21:12] love them I Feast on them but unless the
[2:21:16] person of Jesus Christ quickens this
[2:21:19] message to you in the truth of the
[2:21:22] Revelation that it was spoken in it'll
[2:21:25] produce exactly what we've got
[2:21:29] amen all kinds of just fellowships all
[2:21:32] kinds of different groups all kinds of
[2:21:35] different leaders nobody has an
[2:21:42] absolute it's up to us
[2:21:45] individually to make make
[2:21:48] sure that we have the person of Jesus
[2:21:52] Christ amen leading us in our
[2:21:58] life you say I'm not sure whether I do
[2:22:02] or
[2:22:03] not
[2:22:05] ask and you shall
[2:22:07] receive get down on your knees somewhere
[2:22:11] get in your closet somewhere pray
[2:22:14] through you can't think it into
[2:22:21] existence it's a
[2:22:23] genuine experience that you
[2:22:27] know that you passed from Death onto
[2:22:30] life you know in that day that he is in
[2:22:34] the father and the father is him and
[2:22:36] that you're in him and he's in you you
[2:22:40] know it because you got down until you
[2:22:43] possessed it and every one of those
[2:22:46] early church church members when they
[2:22:48] met somebody they took what he
[2:22:52] said they knelt down they expressed
[2:22:54] everything the people saw the change in
[2:22:57] their life and they stayed there and
[2:22:59] they prayed
[2:23:00] through until that same Spirit affected
[2:23:04] him you know what we do nowadays you
[2:23:07] want to get born again read
[2:23:11] this listen to this I believe in
[2:23:16] listening
[2:23:20] but you got to get the
[2:23:22] life of what you're
[2:23:25] hearing you understand you know I'm for
[2:23:28] tapes you know I'm for
[2:23:30] books but the prophet of God was
[2:23:34] talking about what the first church
[2:23:37] had and we talked about that last time
[2:23:40] we ministered how the church drifted
[2:23:43] from that
[2:23:44] leadership and then that was God 's
[2:23:48] complaint they left their first love
[2:23:51] their first love was him leading them
[2:23:55] and they substituted it and that's the
[2:23:58] complaint now this church has to come
[2:24:01] back to the complaint meet the complaint
[2:24:04] and come back under the leadership of
[2:24:07] the Holy Spirit the leadership of the
[2:24:10] word of God the leadership of their
[2:24:14] Savior and that leadership amen and I I
[2:24:19] my own confession is there's a lot of
[2:24:21] choices I make there's a lot of
[2:24:25] reactions that I have that I knows not
[2:24:29] him and I realize that as much as I know
[2:24:33] this message and this
[2:24:35] word I've got to bring myself under
[2:24:38] subjection to the person of Jesus Christ
[2:24:43] and him alone and that's a challenge
[2:24:47] because the flesh Wars against the
[2:24:49] spirit and the spirit against the flesh
[2:24:52] I hope you understand what I'm trying to
[2:24:54] say this morning God bless you let's
[2:24:59] [Applause]
[2:25:04] stand the musicians can come God bless
[2:25:13] you this in your own heart this morning
[2:25:23] you can ask yourself if you feel you
[2:25:25] have that leadership in your
[2:25:28] life not what you
[2:25:31] believe I know you believe the word and
[2:25:34] I know you believe it's the truth and I
[2:25:36] know you believe the
[2:25:38] message and you believe the Vindication
[2:25:41] of it that's not the question this
[2:25:45] morning
[2:25:47] the question is do you possess the
[2:25:50] leadership of the
[2:25:57] spirit the Lord may have even changed
[2:26:00] your
[2:26:04] nature and you know you're different
[2:26:06] than you were
[2:26:10] before but you just took that different
[2:26:13] person and just went about your life
[2:26:19] living your life as a good
[2:26:22] person that so sounds like that young
[2:26:26] man that the prophet of God preached
[2:26:29] about living right doing right believing
[2:26:33] right not a mark against
[2:26:36] them but he didn't have that
[2:26:42] leadership he didn't have
[2:26:45] that
[2:26:49] submission to the will of
[2:26:53] God and we'd ask you this morning if you
[2:26:56] don't feel that you have that leadership
[2:27:00] in your life I'm not saying you're a
[2:27:03] sinner I'm not saying you don't believe
[2:27:06] the
[2:27:07] [Music]
[2:27:09] message but you've come to that place in
[2:27:12] your life where God's LED you to that
[2:27:15] choice
[2:27:20] where you've got to choose that
[2:27:23] leadership amen and maybe you've been
[2:27:26] denying that choice because you're
[2:27:28] afraid that it might lead you
[2:27:30] to something that or take you away from
[2:27:35] something you've always
[2:27:39] wanted I know what that's
[2:27:45] like but you want to say in your heart
[2:27:48] Lord I want your
[2:27:51] will I want to do what you want me to
[2:27:55] do I want to be what you want me to
[2:28:00] be I I I'm I just don't want to go
[2:28:04] on
[2:28:06] believing and never being
[2:28:11] led I want to come back and place myself
[2:28:14] before you this morning and consecrate
[2:28:17] yourself and say Lord I I come back to
[2:28:20] you this morning I want to be led by
[2:28:22] your
[2:28:23] spirit Lord even as a pastor of a church
[2:28:27] some of the loveliest greatest people in
[2:28:30] the world Lord I still need your
[2:28:36] leadership I can't go on the
[2:28:39] [Music]
[2:28:42] past I've got to be led each
[2:28:45] day if you'd like to lift your hand and
[2:28:48] say Lord I I'm here this morning
[2:28:53] and I I as a believer I'm standing here
[2:28:56] my life is right my life is
[2:28:59] clean I've obeyed every commandment I've
[2:29:02] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:29:04] Jesus Christ you've changed my life but
[2:29:09] I just don't really feel I'm being
[2:29:11] led am and you want to lift your hands
[2:29:14] up and say Lord lead me this
[2:29:17] morning I want to come back to that
[2:29:20] faith of the early church where my
[2:29:23] fathers didn't have a book they didn't
[2:29:25] have a Bible they didn't have a tape but
[2:29:27] they were led by the spirit of
[2:29:31] God and the scripture says as many as
[2:29:34] are led by the spirit of God are the
[2:29:38] sons and daughters of
[2:29:40] God lord and that's my heart's desire
[2:29:43] this
[2:29:45] morning
[2:29:48] Lord I'm sorry that I haven't listened
[2:29:50] I'm sorry I haven't sought your
[2:29:54] face Lord the only time I come is when
[2:29:57] I'm in need and I'm sick and then I come
[2:30:00] crying to you but Lord I want to stand
[2:30:03] this morning and say Lord what would you
[2:30:06] have me to do what can I do for you lord
[2:30:10] lord I I want your spirit to move on me
[2:30:15] now

[2:30:24] this

[2:30:30] me and guide me in my
[2:30:33] life we ask that you would grant that
