Description:
Communion Service
Sunday Evening Service: February 13, 2022.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

we pray amen and amen god bless you as you're turning in your bibles to matthew the 26th chapter you know we certainly want to encourage everybody that can to come out to the services of friday uh saturday night and and sunday morning don't be afraid that you won't have a seat uh we'll squeeze in another row of chairs if we have to and we'll put some more seats up here for some uh ministers to sit in if we have to and we'll open my office up if we have to and we'll sit in the foyer if you have to and we'll sit and overflow if you have to and and we'll do everything we have to right but i want to be here because something wonderful might happen amen so we certainly want to do that but we're just going to just go straight to communion service a little different i sometimes we um everything gets in a routine and sometimes maybe just to see that we have some liberty we also want you to pray about maybe having some sunday school classes on on sunday evening i know that a lot of the children may not be able to make it but for those that can we're just praying about the i talked to the brothers and they're willing to tear down the back and set it up for some classrooms maybe we won't have as many classes as but we might just have two classes back there but we want to do something i that's been the biggest burden on me and the biggest press to try to get something built for us as quick as possible and then pretty soon here we'll find out exactly what we'll do and and then we'll put it to a vote of the whole congregation to see if they want us to go forward with building if you feel like you want it the responsibility that's going to take the financial side of it and everything because we surely want your will in everything that we do amen so anyway pray pray about sunday school and those of you that might consider to be a teacher or would like to do that and helpers as many as that were there before we'd sure welcome everybody back and let's just trust that the lord will be able to have us do something and then pretty soon by the grace of god we'll probably have a change within the next year so all the building permits have been filed they're reviewing the plans for the building part for the first time they're reviewing the plans for the civil drawings for like the seventh time so i don't know if they can find anything else but i guess they just like to stick to their routine i'm not much one for routine you know and i mean i'd like to flap the wings on the eagle's nest you know what i mean i like people to be put in the situation they're either for you or against you and so we're grateful for it i'm really looking forward to the lord to do wonderful things but i i don't know if they're going to delay us past the 10th now that they said the city council has to approve it uh earlier before they told me they didn't but i guess they've had it maybe a change of mind but that's okay if if if not it'll be a little bit but if we can work we should be able to start if the first approval goes through by the first of march if not if they make us wait till after the 10th then it should be after the 10th but so i have a construction meeting planned that the subcontractors and i'll be at and we'll figure out what they want to do huh so let us pray but now we can have communion so that always brings comfort doesn't it when you can walk with the lord you can come take communion remembering what he did for you and you can lay your petition so communion's a time to lay your petition to the lord there's healing in communion there's victory and communion so as you have come take communion tonight come with something on your heart that you would like the lord to do for you or or maybe something you want to do for him and you'd like him to give you leadership and guidance in it but just don't come to take communion tonight with nothing in your hand to bring so bring it bring it to heart's desire bring a request bring somebody maybe that you have a burden for bring it to communion tonight commune with the lord let him know you're here because you're remembering what price he paid for you and that in this great work there's many things that god can do so let's turn to the 14th verse of the 26th chapter of matthew the first recorded pure communion and it said then one of the 12 called judas iscariot went into the chief priest and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you and they convened it with him for 30 pieces of silver and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him now can you just imagine that for the whole time they sought opportunity to betray him i i wonder what that was like and now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying unto him where will thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master said my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover now when the evil was come he sat down with the twelve and as they did eat he verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me and they were exceedingly sorrowful and beginned every one of them to say unto him lord is it i now i just want you to take a look at that jesus knew what judas was i mean this this was him discerning and just letting him know i know you know so and they were exceedingly sorrowful and begin every one of them to say to him lord is it i and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish is the same shall betray me the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i and he said unto him thou hath said and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but i say unto you i will not drink therefore of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it anew with you in my father's house and when they had sung a hymn they went out unto the mount of olives let us pray brothers our gracious heavenly father lord we have here the bread father that represents father the bread of life father that your words is truly meat for the inner man and for the soul and father even meat for our natural life because there is healing by your stripes we are healed father we just ask you to bless it to us for this communion this evening that we are taking father we're fulfilling your commandment and your example because you've certainly give us an example and father also the cup father of the wine lord which we know represents the life that you return back unto the believer father and that is the cleansing of our sins and all that you've done for us lord god it's just such a wonderful realization that there's someone so supernatural and so powerful cares for us just mere mortals father lord and i know that we maybe make lots of mistakes father and and we have lots of trouble in our lives and father we mess things up so many times but lord it was this love that was demonstrated that overcometh all it's this love that's our victory father that you loved us and you put your our names on your heart in the tablets of your heart father and you came to win us back and pay for all our failures father we take this communion remembering that tonight in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen god bless you you can come to communion as you feel led
