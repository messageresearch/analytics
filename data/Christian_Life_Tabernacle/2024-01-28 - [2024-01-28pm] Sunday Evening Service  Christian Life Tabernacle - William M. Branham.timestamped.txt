[36:02] laid out and you know brother brand made
[36:05] the statement he said that all these

[36:11] that the message is timely that's so
[36:14] everything testifies of God's word you
[36:18] know just no matter how that you look
[36:21] around and you know it's we talked about
[36:25] the two eding of
[36:27] you know in the Garden of Eden the
[36:30] scripture said that Adam and Eve uh that
[36:35] they were veiled from the fact that they
[36:38] were naked that they didn't know that
[36:42] that they were unclothed in any way
[36:46] because they were veiled by the word of
[36:49] God that uh wasn't even there but isn't
[36:52] it strange that though in the first Eden
[36:56] God's
[36:58] Eden Adam and Eve uh were uh blind you
[37:03] know to the fact that they were naked
[37:06] and now we come over in our day and
[37:09] they're
[37:10] blind to the fact that they're naked
[37:14] they're blind miserable poor wretched
[37:16] and naked and don't even know it and and
[37:21] you know and so brother brand referred
[37:24] to it you know they they're out there
[37:25] taking their clothes off it's and it
[37:28] don't even bother them you know what I
[37:31] mean the poor sons and daughters of God
[37:33] they have to struggle with it but yet
[37:36] here it is those two great Edens run in
[37:40] parallel you know and the our greatest
[37:43] joy is is that we know that we're going
[37:45] back to the eating that we come from
[37:49] amen so uh if we just got to continue
[37:52] pressing the great Mark and everything
[37:54] just kind of an update on um our
[37:58] progress
[37:59] uh next door um so we got to this week
[38:05] coming up and if if we get all the help
[38:07] we got can get and everything falls
[38:11] together uh I would think by the end of
[38:14] next week we'd be pretty much done uh
[38:17] with the physical construction of it and
[38:21] the following week we should be able to
[38:23] put in our carpet and then the following
[38:27] week we should be able to have the pews
[38:31] in and then we'll call on about 50
[38:34] sisters to go clean the whole place up
[38:38] because it's
[38:39] dusty and uh so if all those things go
[38:42] well and the city
[38:45] fathers will let us in uh that's the
[38:49] biggest hurdle you know is the city they
[38:52] always come up with something so we have
[38:56] we have have the occupancy
[39:00] inspection and then we have the Ada
[39:05] inspection and uh so that uh there's all
[39:09] kinds of
[39:11] handicap requirements we have to make
[39:14] and and um I'm sure that there's always
[39:18] something they want us to do and then uh
[39:23] there's the Fire Marshall inspection
[39:27] so we just have to get all all those
[39:29] little things right and and they always
[39:32] come along and they say make this door
[39:35] open this way and put this up higher put
[39:38] that lower and we read all the all the
[39:42] things we can read to make sure we do it
[39:44] right and so I bought some some little
[39:47] things and it said Ada approved you know
[39:51] in other words this is the Cs me out and
[39:55] then you you have the Ada person come up
[39:58] and they don't see it that way and so we
[40:02] just pray that we can get all that
[40:04] worked out and uh get it cleaned up
[40:07] they're supposed to turn the heat on uh
[40:12] maybe Monday uh get everything for our
[40:15] heat we'll have our heat on and our air
[40:18] conditioning on and then we're going to
[40:22] U um see about deciding whether we want
[40:27] to get it all cleaned up and move in
[40:30] there so we'll just play it by year uh
[40:34] everybody asked me when the first
[40:35] service would been I was trying to go
[40:38] for March
[40:39] 31st of that's Easter but we may be able
[40:43] to have a service before then so I just
[40:46] pray and we'll have to move the piano
[40:49] over there so we'll get a a piano moving
[40:54] company so the last piano moving company
[40:57] we had they dropped it
[40:59] so poor sister Rebecca she was standing
[41:03] back there filming and all of a sudden I
[41:07] heard this
[41:09] gasp and they had dropped her piano so
[41:12] that was a that was a pretty uh uh
[41:16] Dreadful thing but we'll try to get it
[41:18] all moved over so when we come to that
[41:22] spot what we'll do is we'll have one
[41:24] service here Sunday evening and then no
[41:30] service uh the Wednesday that we're
[41:34] moving and then if everything goes well
[41:37] we sh will have a service so that's
[41:40] where we are
[41:42] um we have some mats that we put out so
[41:45] if you go do start going in there wipe
[41:49] your feet um be real careful uh some
[41:54] kids crawled up under our electric lifts
[41:57] and we're playing on the lifts so
[42:00] parents um don't um let your kids play
[42:04] on any of the
[42:06] machinery and the only other thing we
[42:09] have to do is we have to pray for our
[42:11] sound people that they get all their
[42:14] sound in in
[42:16] time lots of prayers there for am for
[42:20] the sound
[42:25] person
[42:27] Mike's hiding it
[42:30] back uh but anyway we can do it huh amen
[42:35] Lord's been good to us and you'll I know
[42:37] we don't might need much room tonight uh
[42:40] we're going to feel like a big empty uh
[42:44] space over there uh maybe we can get our
[42:48] Sunday evenings up a little bit but
[42:51] you'll have plenty of room and and U we
[42:55] just trust it'll be a blessing and then
[42:57] we can start getting uh this together um
[43:02] I've got with brother Tim and uh Syer
[43:05] he's going to take care of our Sunday
[43:07] school for us and we're going to have a
[43:09] meeting with all the Sunday School
[43:11] teachers so we can understand all the
[43:15] technology uh that you want for Sunday
[43:17] schools so we're going to build some
[43:20] classrooms and then we'll have a place
[43:23] here that you'll be able to come to in
[43:25] between between
[43:27] Services um one of the things we're
[43:30] going to have to do is we're going to
[43:31] make some changes on some things there's
[43:34] no need to make changes now but we're
[43:37] going to try to make some changes in the
[43:38] order of things but we're going to have
[43:41] a lot of
[43:42] rules how many loves
[43:46] rules how many be believe that rules are
[43:50] made to be
[43:52] broken see yeah uh no so we're we have
[43:57] we don't have all the rules figured out
[44:00] you know who makes the rules don't you
[44:02] it's the people that do something crazy
[44:05] and then you have to come up with a rule
[44:08] you know so uh uh we want to have this
[44:12] to be a nice place that you can wait in
[44:15] between services and uh and I I think
[44:20] we'll probably allow you to eat if you
[44:22] clean up um and we'll have a little more
[44:25] of
[44:26] Fellowship area so you just pray for us
[44:29] uh everything that we're doing we're
[44:31] doing to make it easier uh for you and
[44:35] more beneficial to our our our kids so
[44:39] we can have some real good Sunday school
[44:41] have all the equipment and things that
[44:45] they need and we should have some pretty
[44:48] good uh sound over there um I guess they
[44:54] got all kinds of stuff you know that I
[44:56] never heard of before I didn't think we
[44:59] needed it all you know I I just thought
[45:02] we needed a microphone in the speaker
[45:06] you know what I mean but now they can
[45:08] make all the singer sound good and and
[45:12] uh uh they got special spotlights on me
[45:16] that uh somebody told me you're going to
[45:19] look awful white up there I said well I
[45:21] hope I can look
[45:23] Angelic okay you know what I mean so uh
[45:28] uh but anyway they got these big
[45:32] spotlights they're supposed to take all
[45:34] the Shadows off of you you know what I
[45:36] mean so I think I was blind now I got up
[45:39] there I really couldn't see so um but
[45:43] anyway it it's it's it's yours I I I I
[45:47] really want you to understand that that
[45:50] the church is in your name you know it's
[45:54] it's not in my name name you know I
[45:57] could have set it up that way where you
[46:00] know I own the buildings I own the
[46:02] property it was all in my name and but I
[46:05] didn't you know so it belongs to you so
[46:09] you can get rid of me and still have the
[46:12] building so that's just how we set it up
[46:16] because we want you to have the pride of
[46:20] ownership so let's just pray that we
[46:22] have a good week ahead of us that we can
[46:26] get everything in and uh we can get it
[46:29] cleaned up and then U uh everybody can
[46:34] start decorating or doing whatever you

[46:59] pews they have a special system now
[47:02] where all the spaces are numbered on the
[47:05] Pew and so everybody kind of has their
[47:09] space and then we have an electric shock
[47:12] so if anybody falls asleep
[47:16] we yeah and and or if we need the whole
[47:20] congregation to say Amen we we just we

[49:33] he gave me a testimony and then I'd like
[49:35] to share it with
[49:37] you he said you know Brother David he
[49:41] said when I grew up in my family
[49:45] uh
[49:47] uh he said my my mother
[49:51] prayed and he said the faith of our
[49:53] family was built
[49:56] in
[49:58] prayer she said when I he said to me he
[50:01] says when
[50:05] uh when any of us children got
[50:10] sick we didn't go to the doctor first
[50:13] and then prayed we always prayed
[50:16] first and he said because of it we
[50:19] didn't go to the doctor that
[50:22] often and then he said my my life
[50:25] situation changed and and I I was
[50:29] amongst people that the anytime they got
[50:32] sick they ran to the
[50:36] doctor
[50:38] and he said then one of my children
[50:41] became sick and and they were having a
[50:44] trouble and and they wanted to take him
[50:47] to the doctor take him to the doctor he
[50:49] said that wasn't the way I was raised so
[50:52] we tried the doctor and the doctor
[50:54] thinks he said finally he said I decided
[50:57] to go back to my roots amen he said and
[51:00] I prayed amen and he said it was all
[51:03] over
[51:04] then amen and and I I I hope that you
[51:11] understand my heart and my heart is that
[51:15] what was promised to us is that the
[51:19] Faith of Our Fathers would be
[51:22] restored and the Holy Spirit
[51:26] when Jesus sent the Holy Spirit not only
[51:29] did it UE them with power from on high
[51:33] but it brought to them
[51:36] remembrance of everything that Jesus
[51:39] taught amen and then when they were
[51:42] brought to the remembrance of what Jesus
[51:44] taught what Jesus taught the word is
[51:48] what empowered
[51:50] them amen so if for whatever lies ahead
[51:56] for us which we know the world's getting
[52:00] worse we are going to have to increase

[55:46] among us Lord we just want to share our
[55:49] heart and the testimonies of what you
[55:51] have done for us Lord you are the same
[55:54] yes yesterday today and forever and you
[55:56] never change because you've
[55:58] predestinated a seed that would believe
[56:00] you upon your word that would never fade
[56:02] away that would never walk anywhere else
[56:04] but in your word and Lord we're here
[56:07] tonight just wanting to Fellowship
[56:10] around the word of God and to know what
[56:12] you're doing in our hearts
[56:15] Lord what good will it do to gain the
[56:17] whole world and lose our soul it's not
[56:19] even worth it Lord we just want to be in
[56:22] your image we want to be molded and we
[56:25] want to be the image of your Masterpiece
[56:27] father we want our faith to walk into
[56:30] that image Lord that you had in the
[56:32] beginning that the one that you had in
[56:33] the thoughts in the thoughts of your
[56:35] mind that's where we want to be and we
[56:37] want to be the true genuine expression
[56:40] of Jesus
[56:41] Christ because he was a sinless lamb a
[56:45] lamb without spot or wrinkle he was
[56:48] perfect and we overcome because he
[56:51] overcame and we're here tonight because
[56:54] he over
[56:55] came and we thank you Father we just
[56:58] thank you for your word we thank you for
[57:00] the testimonies we've heard so far and
[57:03] Lord the word this morning we've been so
[57:05] blessed Lord that you've identified our
[57:07] hearts and Lord the spoken word is the
[57:10] Original Seed because that's what was in
[57:13] the beginning when you spoke something
[57:15] you you you you provided evidence behind
[57:19] your word father and so we're standing
[57:22] here behind the evidence of your word
[57:24] that you are the same yesterday today
[57:26] and forever we commit this little time
[57:28] of Fellowship in your hands in Jesus
[57:30] Christ's
[57:31] name amen God bless you
[57:36] um let's just open with the scripture if
[57:38] you don't mind turning since we're
[57:40] standing let's turn to First John
[57:42] chapter 3 we won't be preaching tonight
[57:45] we're just going
[57:46] to share our heart and what the Lord is
[57:49] done for us while we were
[57:51] away and we need to be stimulated we
[57:54] need to be be motivated by the word of
[57:56] God because if there's no word behind it
[57:58] it doesn't produce life amen and when
[58:01] the word's behind it what happens is is
[58:03] now God fulfills his word in our life if
[58:07] we believe upon his word
[58:09] amen not pervert it not take one word
[58:12] away from it not add to it but just keep
[58:14] it simple keep it genuine and believe
[58:17] upon his word because he is the same
[58:20] amen let's just read 1 John chapter 3:18
[58:23] to 24
[58:28] amen it says my little
[58:31] children let us not love in word neither
[58:34] in tongue but in deed and in
[58:38] truth and hereby we know that we are of
[58:41] the truth and shall assure our hearts
[58:45] before him for if our heart condemn us
[58:49] God is greater than our heart and
[58:52] knoweth all things beloved if our heart
[58:57] condemn us not then we have confidence
[59:00] towards
[59:01] God I want to ask you tonight do you
[59:03] have confidence towards
[59:05] God because God is not a god of History
[59:08] God is not a god of 2,000 years ago that
[59:11] people preach God is a god of today amen
[59:14] and his word is life his word is peace
[59:17] amen so when your heart doesn't condemn
[59:19] you then we have confidence towards God
[59:22] amen
[59:23] amen and whatsoever we ask we receive of
[59:27] him because we keep his Commandments and
[59:30] do those things that are pleasing in his
[59:33] sight and this is his Commandment that
[59:37] we should believe on the name of the son
[59:40] Jes on his son Jesus Christ and love one
[59:44] another as he gave us the commandment
[59:47] and he that keepeth his Commandments
[59:50] dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby
[59:55] we know that which abideth in Us by the
[59:59] spirit which he gave what which he had
[1:00:02] given us amen God bless you you can have
[1:00:05] your
[1:00:10] seats we just want to I wanted to read
[1:00:13] this quote before we get started just to
[1:00:17] see what What God Says in his word
[1:00:20] because when God deals with his sons you
[1:00:23] know the sons of of God they're led by
[1:00:25] the spirit of God and the spirit brings
[1:00:27] them to the revealed word of the hour
[1:00:29] and gives them truth and the truth that
[1:00:32] that God reveals to a son or a daughter
[1:00:34] what happens is is now they're they're
[1:00:36] becoming the image that God is revealing
[1:00:39] to his son or to his daughter and it's
[1:00:42] it's only by the revealed truth of the
[1:00:44] hour there's no other way amen it's got
[1:00:47] to come by the revealed truth of the
[1:00:48] hour and just as Brother David was
[1:00:51] preaching this morning you know we have
[1:00:54] to to have
[1:00:56] faith amen amen
[1:00:59] faith is of God faith is of god brother
[1:01:04] Bram says this in perfect
[1:01:06] faith and I just want to read this
[1:01:09] because I want this to be the foundation
[1:01:11] we want to make sure that we he deserves
[1:01:13] all the glory it's not something that
[1:01:15] man's doing it's something that God is
[1:01:17] doing and it's his word that now is
[1:01:20] leading his children to look for that
[1:01:23] last soul yes amen and and and now the
[1:01:28] word also bring us maturity brings us
[1:01:30] into a faith that Jesus Christ had a
[1:01:35] faith that we were able to be restored
[1:01:37] to a faith that the prophet was able to
[1:01:39] come in our generation and restore it
[1:01:42] back to what it was in the beginning
[1:01:44] what was the faith in the beginning it
[1:01:47] was the pure genuine word of God not
[1:01:49] mixed with anything else amen and the
[1:01:52] word of God is pure amen Amen brother
[1:01:56] bam says in perfect
[1:02:00] Faith but as long as you're doing things
[1:02:03] that's wrong you can't have confidence
[1:02:05] towards God so now he's just he's just
[1:02:09] he's talking here I I don't know the
[1:02:10] paragraph in in the table but it
[1:02:14] says but as long as you're doing things
[1:02:16] that's wrong you can't have confidence
[1:02:18] towards God perfect Faith
[1:02:21] 1963 so you see you'll aut automatically
[1:02:24] know that you're wrong it says you
[1:02:27] automatically put yourself back there a
[1:02:32] sinner by knowing that you're
[1:02:35] wrong but when when your heart don't
[1:02:38] condemn you you know you are a
[1:02:43] Believer and there's nothing between you
[1:02:46] and God you can ask and and and it says
[1:02:50] you can ask what you will and know that
[1:02:52] it'll be given because it's the word
[1:02:54] word that's given to you just like it
[1:02:57] was to those
[1:02:58] disciples now the only thing you have to
[1:03:01] do then is have faith in what you are
[1:03:06] amen is to have faith in what you are it
[1:03:11] says have faith in the in in what the
[1:03:15] word says you are
[1:03:18] amen I'm going to repeat that one more
[1:03:20] time it says to have
[1:03:23] faith it
[1:03:28] says have faith in what the word says
[1:03:32] you are and Jesus had faith in the word
[1:03:35] of God and said what he was it says it
[1:03:40] is written of me didn't David in the
[1:03:43] Psalms and in the prophets and all of
[1:03:45] them that speak of him says I am the
[1:03:48] bread of life that came from God out of
[1:03:50] Heaven amen I am it says I am the Tree
[1:03:55] of Life from the Garden of Eden I am all
[1:03:58] these things it says I am that I am and
[1:04:01] he knew with that perfect
[1:04:04] faith that he was anointed a messiah he
[1:04:08] says that the spirit of God was upon him
[1:04:12] he said now I myself do nothing but it's
[1:04:16] my faith in
[1:04:18] God and it says and God was in him and
[1:04:22] the Word was made man manest and when
[1:04:26] the word of God comes in you it's made
[1:04:30] manifest for you are a Believer see and
[1:04:35] a Believer is the faith of God that
[1:04:39] moves in you amen
[1:04:43] amen it says you like that I like it
[1:04:46] when it says I I I like teaching of I
[1:04:49] like teaching of where it says what
[1:04:51] faith really is it says no knowing who
[1:04:55] he was without a shadow of doubt he knew
[1:04:58] he was the son of God he knew it for the
[1:05:01] word
[1:05:03] identified it says the word of God
[1:05:06] identified who he was he said if I do
[1:05:11] not the works of my father don't believe
[1:05:13] me but if I do then believe the works
[1:05:17] for they are the manifested word
[1:05:20] promised praise God it says oh if you
[1:05:24] could just wake up to that yeah okay if
[1:05:29] you can wake up to that brother brandom
[1:05:31] talks
[1:05:32] about a subconscious in an individual
[1:05:36] waking up to the conscience of the
[1:05:38] individual the identity of the
[1:05:40] subconscious that's within you to the
[1:05:43] conscience that now you have in this
[1:05:53] flesh
[1:05:55] but if I do then believe the works for
[1:05:57] they they are manifested word promised
[1:06:00] oh if you could just wake up to that get
[1:06:03] it you see the word itself identified
[1:06:07] him who he was and he said who can
[1:06:11] condemn me of sin in other words who can
[1:06:15] show me that my life and my Works don't
[1:06:18] fulfill exactly what Messiah should
[1:06:22] do nobody could say nothing for he was
[1:06:26] then he had Faith to believe then
[1:06:30] whatever he said would happened then he
[1:06:34] turned around and said the works that I
[1:06:37] do shall you also a little while and the
[1:06:41] world seeth me no more ye shall it says
[1:06:45] yet you shall because I'll be with you
[1:06:48] even in you it says take no thought what
[1:06:52] ye shall say for it's not you that
[1:06:55] speaketh it's not you that speaks it's
[1:06:58] my father that dwelleth in you he's the
[1:07:01] one that does the
[1:07:04] speaking and it's not me it's the father
[1:07:07] that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works
[1:07:09] see what I mean it says now the
[1:07:13] identification of a scripture is as over
[1:07:16] scripture Christian these words said
[1:07:19] Jesus these signs shall follow them that
[1:07:22] believe now how can you call yourself a
[1:07:26] believer of people and deny those words
[1:07:29] how can you call yourself a Believer and
[1:07:32] deny any of this word see you can't do
[1:07:36] it you're not a Believer therefore
[1:07:38] science can't follow you because you
[1:07:40] just accept what you want to believe and
[1:07:44] let the rest of it says you don't
[1:07:46] believe it but you've got to take the
[1:07:48] whole thing and believe it amen amen and
[1:07:52] when you truly believe not make believe
[1:07:56] but really believe then the sign follow
[1:08:00] them that
[1:08:04] believe it says oh could you compare a
[1:08:07] Christian today with them Christians of
[1:08:10] long ago how them disciples walked in
[1:08:13] the power of the spirit moved by the
[1:08:17] Holy Ghost it says just a prisoner as I
[1:08:22] preached on the other night a prisoner
[1:08:24] to the word and the will of God he said
[1:08:28] he couldn't even move until God moved
[1:08:32] him wouldn't you like to see a church
[1:08:36] rise like that he says it's going to
[1:08:40] it's going back it's got to come that's
[1:08:43] right it's on the road now I
[1:08:48] believe
[1:08:51] amen that's the power of of this message
[1:08:54] in The Bride of Jesus
[1:08:57] Christ
[1:09:00] amen when we're all about the father's
[1:09:04] business and
[1:09:10] so as many of you
[1:09:14] know last year we were in Romania for
[1:09:17] quite a while we we were there for about
[1:09:19] 7 weeks we we first started with brother
[1:09:22] Matthew he was preaching in the youth
[1:09:24] meeting in Romania and we were there for
[1:09:26] four or five days and brother Matthew
[1:09:28] came back and me and my family stayed
[1:09:30] for a few weeks longer we were there for
[1:09:32] seven weeks and you know when the word
[1:09:35] of God when the message of the Hour
[1:09:38] really brings you to the revelation of
[1:09:40] Jesus Christ and all your soul wants to
[1:09:42] do is long for the ones that are
[1:09:45] lost when you see the revealed word of
[1:09:48] the hour when the message of the hour
[1:09:50] can take flesh then your your heart is
[1:09:54] no longer about you your your life is no
[1:09:58] longer to serve your own purpose but now
[1:10:01] is to go and and to preach the gospel to
[1:10:05] reflect the life of the hour and to go
[1:10:09] get the ones that are
[1:10:10] lost because there's a compassion there
[1:10:13] that God had placed into a believer's
[1:10:15] heart amen and that's his
[1:10:18] love and his love is there to redeem
[1:10:22] those that are lost those that are still
[1:10:25] out and so we're privileged people
[1:10:28] Saints we're just family tonight amen
[1:10:31] can we just amen we're we're just we're
[1:10:33] just testifying we're not preaching
[1:10:35] we're just testifying of what God's
[1:10:38] doing but Jesus Christ is the
[1:10:41] same and so when God deals with our
[1:10:44] hearts now there's a burning now there's
[1:10:46] a desire for us to be able to share this
[1:10:49] light that God has revealed to
[1:10:51] us when God reveal feels his word to us
[1:10:54] it's no longer for us to to retain but
[1:10:57] now is to be given because now out of
[1:10:59] your belly shall flow rivers of Living
[1:11:03] Waters amen and the truth that's in you
[1:11:08] could now produce the life in that other
[1:11:11] in that other soul that may be thirsting
[1:11:13] for life
[1:11:15] amen and and so we were in Romania for 7
[1:11:20] weeks we were we were just there with my
[1:11:22] family it was really a blessed that it
[1:11:24] it was a blessed trip it was it was
[1:11:27] really a testimony to have my family
[1:11:29] there you know that's that's where I
[1:11:31] grew up that's that's where my f that's
[1:11:33] where we're
[1:11:34] from and that doesn't doesn't make us
[1:11:38] Romanian citizens or American citizens
[1:11:40] we're all citizens of the heaven amen we
[1:11:43] don't we don't carry an identity In the
[1:11:45] Flesh even though we were born there we
[1:11:47] were born all over the world but we're
[1:11:49] here in Bedford Texas
[1:11:51] tonight right 156 16 17 different
[1:11:54] countries this is not something that
[1:11:56] man's done right this is not something
[1:11:59] that man was able to just put together
[1:12:01] because if man would have done this it
[1:12:02] would have been possible but God by a
[1:12:05] revealed word brought a seed out of all
[1:12:08] kinds out of all Nations and brought
[1:12:10] them together Under One Roof for a
[1:12:12] purpose and the purpose is is to reveal
[1:12:15] the life of Jesus Christ now in the
[1:12:17] bride amen she's supposed to reflect
[1:12:20] life yes and so when we go out we want
[1:12:23] reflect life we want to reflect this
[1:12:25] gospel we want to reflect this life and
[1:12:28] so we were on the road seven weeks we
[1:12:29] were we were just traveling and it was
[1:12:33] it was really a a blessed time to see my
[1:12:35] family my children enjoy really
[1:12:39] the uh the fellowship around the the
[1:12:43] other believers you know this message
[1:12:45] produces the same life
[1:12:47] Saints it produces the same exact love
[1:12:51] and the Capstone is divine love is a go
[1:12:54] of Love is a love now that you can you
[1:12:57] can reflect one to another how will they
[1:12:59] know that you are my
[1:13:01] disciples for the love that you have one
[1:13:04] for another you can't fake Divine love
[1:13:06] there's only one source of life that
[1:13:08] could give us Divine love and that's God
[1:13:12] because God is love
[1:13:15] amen and so we were there for 7 weeks
[1:13:19] and we come back it was really a a huge
[1:13:22] testimony while we were down there there
[1:13:24] the Lord had done so many testimonies we
[1:13:26] we had issues with our vehicle our some
[1:13:29] of our wires on our engine burned and
[1:13:32] and somehow we were able to drive 900
[1:13:35] miles with the with the wires that were
[1:13:38] just when I got back and returned the
[1:13:40] vehicle to the rental place the guy
[1:13:41] looked at me and he says I don't know
[1:13:42] how in the world you made it here but
[1:13:44] this vehicle shouldn't even been driving
[1:13:47] your radiator should have been shouldn't
[1:13:49] have been blown up your your clutch fan
[1:13:51] should have been done you should have
[1:13:52] blown an then and I said you know what
[1:13:54] my friend I said I serve a living God I
[1:13:57] didn't have fear I didn't I didn't I
[1:13:59] didn't know what it was I was like Lord
[1:14:00] you know what it is I'm just walking
[1:14:01] forward in it we had AC we had I mean
[1:14:05] car was running
[1:14:06] great car was running great but you know
[1:14:08] that's God that's Faith that's not
[1:14:11] looking at the negative that's not
[1:14:12] looking at what the devil could throw
[1:14:14] your away now you're looking at the
[1:14:15] promise of God and when God gives a
[1:14:18] promise now it produces life amen so
[1:14:24] you know that that was a testimony for
[1:14:26] my family they were able to see God come
[1:14:28] upon the scene while we were together so
[1:14:31] we come home and you know God's just
[1:14:33] dealing with the heart and he's
[1:14:35] continuing to dealing with the heart and
[1:14:37] you
[1:14:40] know the the the trip that we took this
[1:14:43] time was was a more specific trip for me
[1:14:46] because God has been dealing with my
[1:14:48] heart for the past few months and to
[1:14:50] just sharing my heart and and to the
[1:14:52] people of Romania there's there's been a
[1:14:55] few there's been a few um Brothers out
[1:14:58] of the southern part of the country that
[1:15:00] just kind of started contacting us
[1:15:02] directly and we've been sharing our
[1:15:04] heart with them and you know they were
[1:15:05] in a process of you know brother Matthew
[1:15:09] knows and I believe um I don't know
[1:15:12] brother Andrew Made It by there but
[1:15:13] brother Matthew knows this they were
[1:15:15] they were gathering into a home they
[1:15:16] didn't have anywhere to they didn't have
[1:15:18] anywhere to to gather and but it didn't
[1:15:21] matter to them they they got a source of
[1:15:22] life
[1:15:24] and all they wanted to do is is not
[1:15:25] forsake the Assemblies of coming
[1:15:27] together so they wanted to gather
[1:15:29] together and so when we started you know
[1:15:32] the work down in Romania 3 four years
[1:15:34] ago God has continually just building it
[1:15:37] and building it and and so they they
[1:15:40] were able to receive a few donations and
[1:15:43] now they've they were able to raise a
[1:15:45] building uh there was a a donation that
[1:15:48] was even made from from here and and so
[1:15:51] it was it was for the benefit of the
[1:15:52] body there they were able to raise a
[1:15:55] building and now they're gathering in a
[1:15:59] building and now God is is giv them a
[1:16:02] place where they can gather together and
[1:16:05] they can they can have services and they
[1:16:07] can hear the word of God they can hear
[1:16:09] what the God is doing and so are we
[1:16:12] privileged
[1:16:13] Saints are we privileged Saints there's
[1:16:15] there's there's there's churches and
[1:16:17] there's other people that that that
[1:16:19] don't have the the what we have and we
[1:16:22] should be thankful to the Lord of what
[1:16:24] God has given us and and and
[1:16:29] so as the Lord's just been dealing with
[1:16:32] the heart in in a specific
[1:16:34] Direction I wanted I wanted God to do
[1:16:37] something for me on this trip it was
[1:16:38] very specific it was really something
[1:16:40] that I was looking forward to I was you
[1:16:43] know and and I didn't know how it was
[1:16:44] going to unfold we just prayed before
[1:16:46] the Lord and so as the Lord as the Lord
[1:16:50] just opened up the opportunity you know
[1:16:53] it's amazing how God just puts all
[1:16:55] things in order if we're just in prayer
[1:16:56] and expectation Saints you don't have to
[1:16:59] call you don't have to say anything all
[1:17:01] you have to do is pray and God makes all
[1:17:04] things come around behind the scene
[1:17:06] before you know it it's you're walking
[1:17:08] into the vision that God had for
[1:17:09] ordained for us to walk
[1:17:11] into because our life is not here to
[1:17:15] just live in this world but now is to
[1:17:17] reflect the life Behind These doors
[1:17:20] where the life of Jesus Christ could be
[1:17:22] manifest to a lost soul to a soul that's
[1:17:25] maybe in need to somebody that might
[1:17:27] have might have needed a comfort maybe
[1:17:30] somebody that needs an encouragement and
[1:17:32] that's what the bride does she carries
[1:17:34] life and she imparts life because she
[1:17:37] has life and the life is in the word
[1:17:40] amen and
[1:17:43] so you know as as we were praying the
[1:17:46] the um the the group down in the
[1:17:49] southern area here in in in the southern
[1:17:52] part of of the area next to the Black
[1:17:54] Sea had had just reached out and said
[1:17:57] you know we would like for you to come
[1:17:58] down and and maybe just hold some
[1:18:00] Services we really we we just got into
[1:18:03] this building we've just dedicated it a
[1:18:05] few months ago and and we want we want
[1:18:07] to just hold some Services God is really
[1:18:10] doing something down in this area and
[1:18:13] and and it's just been a marvelous
[1:18:15] work so I took it before the Lord of
[1:18:18] course you know uh we want to walk into
[1:18:21] the perfect will of the Lord and so we
[1:18:23] took it before the Lord and sure enough
[1:18:25] the Lord just gave us the confirmation
[1:18:27] and so my dad my my father brother
[1:18:30] brother Leon he he fell the pull to to
[1:18:34] join and and just be there and you know
[1:18:37] it's it's um it's a privilege to be able
[1:18:39] to carry the gospel you know into your
[1:18:41] own country you know I believe that
[1:18:45] sometimes you know being able to hear
[1:18:47] the propit in our language in English
[1:18:50] being able to read being able to
[1:18:52] understand and hear the voice of the
[1:18:54] seventh angel the one that quickens our
[1:18:56] soul the one that we're able to
[1:18:58] understand and catch the revelation of
[1:19:00] the truth it's important amen it's
[1:19:02] important and so and so to be able to
[1:19:06] carry that home and share that home you
[1:19:09] know for me it it it it was it was it
[1:19:12] was a
[1:19:14] testimony and so you know as as we as we
[1:19:19] the Lord put on our heart to go around
[1:19:21] these dates
[1:19:23] um we we had a few services that were
[1:19:26] scheduled we had a Friday night that was
[1:19:28] scheduled in the in the belie with the
[1:19:30] Believers down in karash which was a uh
[1:19:33] an hour away from this area here where
[1:19:36] this church is in
[1:19:38] kavod and so you know my heart was
[1:19:41] always there to to just Express you know
[1:19:45] the love of God you know it's it's so
[1:19:48] hard to try to live around a lot of
[1:19:51] wolves it's very hard to live around a
[1:19:55] lot of wolves when there's just a few
[1:19:58] sheep and they're
[1:20:00] scattered and they're trying to survive
[1:20:03] they're trying to feed they're trying to
[1:20:05] stay alive they're trying they're trying
[1:20:07] to to walk into the revelation of the
[1:20:10] message but there's always wolves that
[1:20:13] are dressed like sheep that walk amongst
[1:20:15] them that try to deceive the very
[1:20:16] elected if it would be possible and so
[1:20:19] sometimes our heart you know you you you
[1:20:21] want to go and pray the gospel so you
[1:20:23] can encourage the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] and and and just you know show show you
[1:20:29] know the the the effort you know
[1:20:33] brotherly kindness and the love of God
[1:20:35] just being able to express and so we had
[1:20:38] a Friday evening in in karash and we
[1:20:40] were there with the Believers there and
[1:20:42] then and then and then Saturday and
[1:20:44] Sunday we were we were in this
[1:20:46] area um but you know God has done
[1:20:50] tremendous things it's it's hard for our
[1:20:53] eyes and our our words to describe what
[1:20:56] God's doing but God is Sovereign and he
[1:20:59] calls them by
[1:21:02] name he calls them by name Why by name
[1:21:06] because their name has been written in
[1:21:08] the Lamb's Book of Life and truly that's
[1:21:11] their true identity truly the word that
[1:21:14] was written there it was the word that
[1:21:16] was written in the beginning about them
[1:21:19] and it takes it takes the word of God to
[1:21:22] be able to to to reflect and bring those
[1:21:27] bring those seeds to life and so we were
[1:21:31] there and we had a we had a wond we had
[1:21:33] wonderful services and so as soon as the
[1:21:35] rest of the Believers in Romania heard
[1:21:37] that we were there of course they wanted
[1:21:39] us to pass by they didn't want to let us
[1:21:42] go they you know Romanian feed you as
[1:21:46] until you die and then they Fellowship
[1:21:47] you until you
[1:21:51] die it's it's just the way Fellowship is
[1:21:54] is around food so you just eat and you
[1:21:56] eat and then you Fellowship until you're
[1:21:59] literally you're you're you're you're
[1:22:01] done and so you know it
[1:22:03] was it it was it was it was great we had
[1:22:07] we had a good we had a good time but you
[1:22:10] know really
[1:22:12] um every one of them every church that
[1:22:15] we've went through we were we were able
[1:22:17] to start down in the South and then we
[1:22:18] were and then we'll show some pictures
[1:22:20] here in just a little bit but I'm just
[1:22:21] going to want to express what God's
[1:22:24] doing and then I'll invite my my father
[1:22:26] brother Stefan to come and and just
[1:22:28] Express his heart too but you know it's
[1:22:31] so
[1:22:32] important to express our faith because
[1:22:36] you know when we express our heart it
[1:22:39] comes from Faith to Faith now your
[1:22:41] testimony could be of your testimony
[1:22:43] really is
[1:22:45] life your testimony really is life
[1:22:48] because now it's no longer a word that's
[1:22:51] remained on paper or a quote that's
[1:22:52] remained in the message but now it's
[1:22:54] made alive in you and because it's made
[1:22:58] alive in you it has a power of
[1:23:00] Resurrection when you testify about
[1:23:03] it and
[1:23:05] so it it was it was such a beautiful
[1:23:08] testimony as God was just dealing with
[1:23:10] us but we were we were able to share our
[1:23:13] heart and go to BL brother Myers in clou
[1:23:16] and and and and then we were able to
[1:23:18] visit some brothers in in the northern
[1:23:20] part of the country by Amada and and
[1:23:23] and we ended up going to a few other
[1:23:25] services near Arad where brother Gabriel
[1:23:28] was at but you
[1:23:31] know God is doing
[1:23:35] something and he's preparing his
[1:23:38] bride he's getting her ready because she
[1:23:41] has to be dressed in that righteous
[1:23:44] garment that she has to carry she's
[1:23:46] dressed with the word of God and and
[1:23:50] so um I wanted to read the scripture as
[1:23:54] we just kind of come to a close and I I
[1:23:57] just kind of ask my dad to come but I
[1:24:00] wanted to turn to John chapter
[1:24:03] 5 and just read these few scriptures and
[1:24:06] I'll read one more
[1:24:08] quote but before we read here I wanted
[1:24:10] to just let you know this every church
[1:24:14] that we've went
[1:24:15] through they send their love and
[1:24:17] greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:19] Christ they truly they truly love the
[1:24:22] Lord and they loveed the Lord because
[1:24:24] they showed us how much they love the
[1:24:27] Lord by their
[1:24:29] expression and and you can you can you
[1:24:33] can see when when there's a life that's
[1:24:35] been changed and affected by the message
[1:24:37] of the hour and how we could influence a
[1:24:41] Believer but I wanted I wanted to I
[1:24:43] wanted to read this these few verses
[1:24:45] here and and just pay attention let us
[1:24:48] speak to your heart because the word of
[1:24:51] God is personal person Al amen it
[1:24:53] uncovers your
[1:24:56] identity
[1:24:57] amen and and so listen to what John
[1:25:01] chapter 5 we'll just read 19-32 and then
[1:25:03] I'll read a
[1:25:12] quote then answered Jesus and said unto
[1:25:15] them verily verily I say unto you the
[1:25:19] son can do nothing of himself but what
[1:25:23] he seeth the father do for what things
[1:25:26] soever he doeth these also doeth the son
[1:25:31] likewise for the Father loveth the Son
[1:25:35] and showed him all things that himself
[1:25:38] doeth and he will show him Greater Works
[1:25:41] than these that ye may
[1:25:45] Marvel for as the father raiseth up the
[1:25:49] dead and quickeneth them even so the son
[1:25:53] quickeneth whom he
[1:25:57] will for the father judgeth no man but
[1:26:01] had committed all judgment unto the
[1:26:04] son that all men should honor the son
[1:26:08] even as they honor the
[1:26:10] father he that honth not the son honth
[1:26:15] not the Father which had sent
[1:26:17] him verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:26:22] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:26:25] that sent me had everlasting life and
[1:26:28] shall not come into
[1:26:31] condemnation but is passed from Death
[1:26:34] unto life amen verily verily I say unto
[1:26:38] you the hour is coming and now is when
[1:26:43] the dead shall hear the voice of the Son
[1:26:46] of God and they shall and they that hear
[1:26:50] shall live for as the father had life in
[1:26:54] himself so had he given to the son to
[1:26:58] have life in
[1:26:59] himself and had given him authority to
[1:27:02] execute judgment also because he is the
[1:27:05] Son of Man Marvel not at this for the
[1:27:10] hour is coming in the which all that are
[1:27:13] in the grave shall hear his
[1:27:16] voice and shall come forth they it says
[1:27:20] they that have done good unto the
[1:27:22] resurrection of life and they that have
[1:27:25] done evil unto the resurrection of
[1:27:29] damnation I can of my own self do
[1:27:32] nothing as I he I judge and my judgment
[1:27:36] is just because I seek not my own will
[1:27:40] but the will of the Father which ha sent
[1:27:43] me if I bear witness of myself my
[1:27:47] witness is not true there is another
[1:27:50] that beareth Witness
[1:27:52] of me and I know that the witness which
[1:27:56] he beareth of me is true am amen the
[1:28:02] witness that he Bears about his bride
[1:28:05] about his elect is
[1:28:07] true because they are the true
[1:28:10] unadulterated word of God Amen they
[1:28:14] believe nothing but the word of
[1:28:16] God and
[1:28:19] so we've been so blessed we've been so
[1:28:22] blessed to be able to
[1:28:24] take this power of
[1:28:29] transformation this resurrection that
[1:28:31] now had taken place and share it and be
[1:28:36] able now to to share really what God has
[1:28:39] done through the message of the hour I
[1:28:41] I'll say this Saints you
[1:28:44] know we have to be honest with
[1:28:51] ourselves there's a lot of there's a lot
[1:28:54] of things
[1:28:56] that and there's a lot
[1:29:01] of there's a lot of Expressions maybe
[1:29:03] that may not be true or there's a lot of
[1:29:05] ways that has even entered into the
[1:29:07] message of the
[1:29:09] hour and so brother brandham says how
[1:29:13] can you tell the true from the false he
[1:29:16] says check word by word word by word
[1:29:20] it's word upon word precept upon precept
[1:29:24] and that's how you'll know them it's by
[1:29:26] the word because there'll be nothing but
[1:29:28] the word of God
[1:29:30] Amen and if it's if it's
[1:29:34] hybrid if it's if it's mixed without
[1:29:36] faith it won't have the
[1:29:39] power if it's mixed with anything else
[1:29:42] but the word of God it won't have the
[1:29:44] power but if it's mixed with faith if
[1:29:48] it's mixed with with with with the true
[1:29:51] genuine spirit of God the truth it
[1:29:55] produces
[1:29:57] life amen amen listen to what brother
[1:30:00] brandham says in the power of
[1:30:01] transformation
[1:30:10] 1965 it says the transforming power of
[1:30:16] God that's taken us from the chaos of
[1:30:19] Science and education
[1:30:22] and the things of the world and the
[1:30:25] understanding of this modern day 65 no
[1:30:29] October 31st power of
[1:30:34] transformation and the things of the
[1:30:36] world and the under it says and the
[1:30:38] understanding of this modern day it says
[1:30:41] has transformed us now into Sons and
[1:30:45] Daughters of
[1:30:46] God and even death itself can never hold
[1:30:50] us in the grave
[1:30:53] it says will be changed in a moment in
[1:30:56] the twinkling of an eye it says oh you
[1:30:59] means to say I it says I mean to say
[1:31:05] that that's the truth Jesus that word
[1:31:10] stood on the earth which was it says
[1:31:14] which was the word and it says the the
[1:31:18] one that was raised up that raised up
[1:31:20] Lazarus he said I am the resurrection
[1:31:23] and life he that believeth in me though
[1:31:27] he were dead yet shall he live amen and
[1:31:32] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:31:35] shall never die it says no there's no
[1:31:38] way to stop the Living Word of God it's
[1:31:42] got to rise
[1:31:45] again Hallelujah there's no way to stop
[1:31:47] the Living Word of God it's got to rise
[1:31:53] again and from out of this chaos watch
[1:31:56] what brother Bram saying here I love
[1:31:58] this
[1:31:59] quote and out of this chaos of this
[1:32:02] modern scientific Eden that we're living
[1:32:04] in of culture and of Science and
[1:32:08] education and all this modern stuff it
[1:32:11] says will rise praise God this robe of
[1:32:15] Flesh will drop and it says and rise and
[1:32:19] seize the Everlasting rise someday we'll
[1:32:24] go through it says we'll go through the
[1:32:26] air and all of this will be over for the
[1:32:30] word of God that's brought us from the
[1:32:33] modern thinking of our mind Transforming
[1:32:37] Our mind into the renewing of our hearts
[1:32:41] towards
[1:32:42] God and our Spirits it says that same
[1:32:46] spirit that spoke that has transformed
[1:32:50] us this far
[1:32:52] and it'll also it says and also will
[1:32:55] take us into his presence into his glory
[1:32:59] with the glorified
[1:33:02] body he's quoting Isaiah here it says
[1:33:04] they shall build houses they shall
[1:33:07] inhabit them they shall plant Vineyards
[1:33:10] it says in our s in in all our
[1:33:13] scientific search we plant the garden
[1:33:16] our sons come along to take the fruit
[1:33:19] from it and his sons come and takes the
[1:33:22] fruit from him and they plant and
[1:33:25] another one eats and they build and
[1:33:27] another one inhabits but it says but
[1:33:30] long will be the days of my servants
[1:33:33] they'll be there and their offsprings
[1:33:36] with them they'll build and another will
[1:33:39] not inhabit though plant and another and
[1:33:43] not another eat thereof it says what the
[1:33:48] very God the very Prophet that the word
[1:33:51] of God said a virgin shall conceived
[1:33:55] promised us this
[1:33:58] amen how do we get it we are potentially
[1:34:03] there right now see because God said so
[1:34:08] it has to be when he raised Lazar at
[1:34:12] there he said don't think this is
[1:34:14] strange for the hour is coming when all
[1:34:18] that's in the grave will hear his voice
[1:34:21] The Voice of the son of man and shall
[1:34:24] come forth some to shame and some to
[1:34:27] life it says what is it
[1:34:29] transforming transforming by the word of
[1:34:33] God making us Sons and Daughters of God
[1:34:38] and will also give us life in the world
[1:34:42] to
[1:34:43] come oh my what more can I say listen
[1:34:48] not to other
[1:34:50] things
[1:34:52] amen that should be a comfort for the
[1:34:54] Bride of Jesus
[1:34:56] Christ making us Sons and Daughters of
[1:35:00] God by the revealed word of the hour
[1:35:03] restoring us right back to where we were
[1:35:05] in the beginning like we heard this
[1:35:06] morning what a what a wonderful word
[1:35:09] Saints this message is not just quotes
[1:35:13] and the scriptures are not just verses
[1:35:15] that we
[1:35:19] read what you eat is what you
[1:35:23] become what you eat is what you
[1:35:27] express what you eat is what your nature
[1:35:31] produces and that is life it produces
[1:35:34] Divine love it produces patience it
[1:35:38] produces kindness it produces gentleness
[1:35:41] it produces God in flesh am amen it was
[1:35:46] God above us we heard it brother B
[1:35:50] brother Billy mentioned it this morning
[1:35:52] it was God above us same God never
[1:35:55] changes just three different
[1:35:57] attributes God above us God With Us and
[1:36:01] now he's God in
[1:36:04] us by the spirit that he foreordained
[1:36:08] for us to have only to receive the truth
[1:36:13] that's part of the
[1:36:16] spirit and this
[1:36:19] life is a privilege
[1:36:22] this life is a privilege to be able to
[1:36:25] share with others that don't have
[1:36:29] because the message is a
[1:36:34] person and this person is the restored
[1:36:38] bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:41] today amen and she produces life she
[1:36:46] produces the promise like Sarah did she
[1:36:50] didn't hurry
[1:36:52] she
[1:36:53] waited and she manifested the promise
[1:36:56] because she was patient and believed
[1:36:59] upon the word of God so we've
[1:37:02] been it's been such a blessing to be
[1:37:04] able to go home and share this share
[1:37:07] this gospel with the believing Saints
[1:37:10] there and you know this message is what
[1:37:13] unites the bride together not only in
[1:37:15] Bedford Texas but I'm going to say
[1:37:18] worldwide because she's from All Nations
[1:37:21] from all kindreds she she she she's part
[1:37:24] of him she she knows she knows her mate
[1:37:28] she knows her husband and and it
[1:37:31] produces the same love and and so um I'm
[1:37:35] going to invite my dad to maybe come and
[1:37:38] share a few words and then we'll just go
[1:37:40] through and express you know some of the
[1:37:42] pictures that we have on on a on a few
[1:37:45] on a few slides and and just so you can
[1:37:49] see the the Believers there but truly
[1:37:52] the privilege and the honor goes to the
[1:37:54] Lord amen he he has the preeminence he
[1:37:59] is the life he is the truth he is the
[1:38:01] way he's showing us the way he's showing
[1:38:04] us he's showing us the direction to go
[1:38:06] and so God bless you we've we've truly
[1:38:09] been blessed we we couldn't have done it
[1:38:11] without your prayers without your
[1:38:12] support with all of the things that
[1:38:14] you've done for us and just know that
[1:38:17] you know a
[1:38:19] prayer does more than anything you could
[1:38:21] ever ask
[1:38:23] for amen because the devil the devil
[1:38:26] always tries to come against the word of
[1:38:28] God he always tries to come and and and
[1:38:31] and push and and and deceive and and and
[1:38:34] try to push you away and take away your
[1:38:36] confidence and put fear within you and
[1:38:39] and always trying to discourage you but
[1:38:41] there is a word that was given that
[1:38:43] produces life that overcomes that and
[1:38:45] the Bible says that perfect love casteth
[1:38:48] out
[1:38:49] fear and when you have him you have
[1:38:51] perfect love
[1:39:09] amen we just want to greet you in the
[1:39:10] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:12] Christ we sure missed
[1:39:16] you we love
[1:39:20] you and and we it's just I'm so happy to
[1:39:23] say that we're back
[1:39:31] home uh I want to read a quote from a
[1:39:35] message um leadership in
[1:39:40] 1965
[1:39:41] um December
[1:39:44] 7th and then the paragraph would be
[1:39:47] uh
[1:39:49] 141 she
[1:39:53] and the word says
[1:39:57] this just as Moses it's called a nation
[1:40:00] out of a
[1:40:04] Nation Christ today is calling a church
[1:40:07] out of a church you
[1:40:11] see the same thing in
[1:40:18] type taking them to the Glorious Eternal
[1:40:21] Eternal Promised Land amen amen
[1:40:25] amen is the it's the Bride of Jesus
[1:40:30] Christ which is which were the ones that
[1:40:33] were uh
[1:40:36] chosen that was that was predestinated
[1:40:38] before the foundation of the
[1:40:41] world and their names were written in
[1:40:44] the Lamb's Book of
[1:40:46] Life and within all this you also find
[1:40:50] Romanians
[1:40:53] amen amen
[1:41:00] amen it was it was really a privilege
[1:41:03] for me to go on this little tour in
[1:41:05] Romania
[1:41:13] um it was my first time actually just
[1:41:16] going back home into my own country and
[1:41:18] and having fellowship with the mess such
[1:41:24] churches it was it was very
[1:41:28] different but I would like to say this
[1:41:31] that
[1:41:33] Christ he has his
[1:41:35] chosen there
[1:41:39] few but they have the unadulterated word
[1:41:42] of God amen
[1:41:49] amen you as as as you know or maybe you
[1:41:53] should know the the word is very tested
[1:41:56] in
[1:41:58] Romania for us here in the states is may
[1:42:01] be very
[1:42:05] easy uh the the word the word Christian
[1:42:09] yeah Christian everybody everybody's
[1:42:12] Christians everybody everybody claims to
[1:42:14] be Christians
[1:42:16] here but in
[1:42:18] Romania when you're talking about a
[1:42:20] Christian
[1:42:23] especially when you get into the
[1:42:25] message is very is very
[1:42:33] blamed it's it it it has it has a
[1:42:36] reproach it pushes it to the to the
[1:42:38] side you have to be very strong you have
[1:42:41] to be you have to have the foundation of
[1:42:45] faith and in the word of
[1:42:48] God and all the ones that
[1:42:53] come and all the Believers that come
[1:42:55] from from all of these religions
[1:42:57] Pentecostals
[1:42:59] Baptist they blame this
[1:43:03] word and if you don't have the strength
[1:43:06] or the foundation of the word
[1:43:09] revealed it' be very easy for you to go
[1:43:11] fall
[1:43:14] away but the revealed word of the
[1:43:19] hour which creates a a a a foundation
[1:43:23] into a
[1:43:25] heart nothing can nothing can take you
[1:43:27] nothing
[1:43:29] can what I would like to say is that the
[1:43:33] Fai and the people that carry this
[1:43:37] message they're very
[1:43:44] tried and therefore it's very important
[1:43:46] that you know the encouragement of the
[1:43:48] word and and and the fellowship
[1:43:53] that it's it's very important for these
[1:43:54] for these
[1:44:03] Believers I I would like to maybe just
[1:44:06] share a few words of what the Lord had
[1:44:08] had dealt with my heart while we were in
[1:44:10] in kavod in this area of kavod which is
[1:44:13] down by the Black
[1:44:16] Sea it's a it's a new church that just
[1:44:19] formed
[1:44:25] just just as he was expressing that you
[1:44:28] know there's just it's a new building
[1:44:29] that that the Lord just rose up
[1:44:33] there it's also right now still under
[1:44:38] construction they're they're down to
[1:44:41] maybe just almost lay the floor down on
[1:44:43] the
[1:44:44] ground and even if they didn't have no
[1:44:46] floor even if they didn't have all the
[1:44:48] conditions that were perfect
[1:44:51] they insisted that we would go and that
[1:44:54] we would host services and have
[1:44:55] Fellowship because they
[1:44:58] desired they desired to have Fellowship
[1:45:01] around the word of God that was within
[1:45:04] them that they
[1:45:08] desired and and the fact that we were
[1:45:11] there and they heard about
[1:45:13] us there was a lot of visitors that
[1:45:19] came
[1:45:21] and the Lord really worked in in a
[1:45:23] supernatural wondrous
[1:45:30] way uh Saturday evening we had a a uh
[1:45:33] church
[1:45:36] service I would like for you to
[1:45:41] understand it's very hard for me to
[1:45:45] explain in a
[1:45:48] world that's educated that's that's God
[1:45:51] all that they have need
[1:45:54] of the southern part of the country in
[1:46:06] Romania so in in in that region of the
[1:46:09] country
[1:46:11] christianis you know the Believers and
[1:46:13] christianism in that area there is is
[1:46:15] really tough they they're they're
[1:46:17] they're not really open so so much to
[1:46:19] the word of God because of the culture
[1:46:21] and and all and the idolatry that really
[1:46:25] had taken place in that in that era in
[1:46:27] that area
[1:46:31] there there's there's a lot of uh
[1:46:33] Witchcraft and a bunch of you know uh
[1:46:36] things that that that are
[1:46:41] not and in that place the Lord has has a
[1:46:46] seat to be pulled
[1:46:49] out God
[1:46:51] and God God has to work there he wants
[1:46:53] to pull that seat
[1:46:57] out we had a situation in a
[1:47:00] family that they weren't
[1:47:03] Christians and the
[1:47:06] husband he was he was a
[1:47:10] drunk and you know he he you know he he
[1:47:13] was very violent and did a lot of things
[1:47:15] that you know the drunk
[1:47:19] do Saturday evening we actually prayed
[1:47:22] for this
[1:47:24] family and we brought it before the Lord
[1:47:27] in that
[1:47:31] service and we said Lord let this family
[1:47:35] be
[1:47:39] saved I said Lord you you you can do all
[1:47:42] these
[1:47:44] things because we believe this
[1:47:49] thing
[1:47:52] and even the parents of this of this
[1:47:55] individual of the
[1:47:57] son and they said that if the Lord would
[1:48:01] do something with this
[1:48:05] family they would see that it would be
[1:48:07] the hand of
[1:48:10] God and Saturday morning when we had our
[1:48:12] Saturday morning
[1:48:16] service and the wife of this husband
[1:48:19] that that struggling with
[1:48:21] drinking she came to
[1:48:23] church it was a
[1:48:26] miracle
[1:48:29] because the husband never allowed her or
[1:48:32] give her the the the freedom to come to
[1:48:36] church and for that whole Community was
[1:48:39] a a miracle that she was able to attend
[1:48:42] the
[1:48:46] service as as a matter of fact actually
[1:48:49] she brought want her baby to have it
[1:48:51] dedicated before the
[1:48:54] Lord this is the Lord this is God this
[1:48:58] is
[1:49:00] God and and God works whenever he wants
[1:49:02] her however he wants and through whoever
[1:49:05] he
[1:49:07] wants he he works in a very strange
[1:49:11] way but he works the
[1:49:14] same he always confirmed his word he
[1:49:19] always confirmed his word
[1:49:21] word and he always stood behind his
[1:49:25] word even brother Bram himself
[1:49:30] says when those 12 Spies were sent to
[1:49:33] Kad Bara
[1:49:36] okay to inspect all all the
[1:49:39] land it was 12 of
[1:49:43] them 10 of them was only able to see
[1:49:46] what their eyes were
[1:49:48] seeing but only two of them they were
[1:49:52] able to see the promise of God and they
[1:49:54] were able to bring fruits the the the
[1:49:59] evidence they were able to bring the
[1:50:02] evidence the evidence that was in the
[1:50:05] land they were able to bring
[1:50:08] back they were they brought the evidence
[1:50:10] that the land
[1:50:13] existed that God that the one that God
[1:50:15] had promised
[1:50:18] them this is God
[1:50:22] brought the evidence before they could
[1:50:25] get into the
[1:50:27] land so they rece the promise that they
[1:50:30] see this is
[1:50:33] God a lot of
[1:50:36] times we look at at the things on the
[1:50:40] materialistic side and the things that
[1:50:42] are around
[1:50:44] us God and the message the Bible and the
[1:50:47] message says to rise up at another and
[1:50:50] and to soar like in Heavenly places we
[1:50:53] are
[1:50:55] eagles we have to rise above all the
[1:50:59] problems we have to rise upon all these
[1:51:02] things that these people
[1:51:05] do because we're the Bride of Jesus
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:10] Christ and I would like to just close
[1:51:12] with
[1:51:15] this God is even working
[1:51:18] today and he's calling out all the ones
[1:51:22] that are that are elected to come out so
[1:51:25] that way that number would be able to be
[1:51:28] fulfilled I would like to read one more
[1:51:31] quote out of the same out of the same
[1:51:32] service
[1:51:35] leadership paragraph

[1:51:59] has been born again by the word of God
[1:52:01] predestinated to eternal life called de
[1:52:07] elected it will be the word of
[1:52:10] God on top of
[1:52:13] word word on
[1:52:17] word not a denominational C
[1:52:21] Creed and then a word and a
[1:52:24] Creed it says it won't
[1:52:28] work you can't have the living in
[1:52:31] it only one eternal
[1:52:35] life Jesus Christ the word amen amen

[1:53:10] me see if I can look in here um this is
[1:53:13] the church that just you know recently

[1:53:17] and like my dad was saying they they
[1:53:19] still don't have floors in there as a
[1:53:20] matter of fact while we were down there
[1:53:22] we were able to make a small donation
[1:53:24] and purchase their floors and so they're
[1:53:27] able to now install them but truly they
[1:53:30] really want to serve the Lord with all
[1:53:31] of their
[1:53:33] heart if they don't have a minister come
[1:53:36] through to preach they put a tape and
[1:53:39] they're under expectation and they
[1:53:41] listen to the word of
[1:53:43] God but they won't they'll they'll

[1:57:49] really tough just changing beds but you
[1:57:50] know God's good you do this because you
[1:57:52] love the Lord and and it's something
[1:57:54] inside of us that just likes to share
[1:57:56] the life um there next next this is a u
[1:58:01] this is um brother Christie we were
[1:58:04] going to a church that I haven't never
[1:58:06] been to yet this was the first time
[1:58:08] we've went this is a church in a town
[1:58:10] called
[1:58:11] bulgaro um a sweet little group that was
[1:58:14] there and really
[1:58:18] um the may shock you but this is just
[1:58:21] the way that God works the pillar of
[1:58:23] fire was there it was visible people had
[1:58:25] seen it it was a it was it was in the it
[1:58:28] was in that service and actually there
[1:58:31] was a sister that um came in very sick
[1:58:35] than that service she came in sweating
[1:58:38] she she came to the altar she said I
[1:58:40] don't know what's wrong with me
[1:58:41] something's going around we prayed for
[1:58:44] her and then as we were walking out of
[1:58:47] the church service maybe 30 minutes
[1:58:48] later she came to us and she said I
[1:58:50] don't know what happened but I'm Healed
[1:58:53] she was no longer sweating she was no
[1:58:55] longer whatever was going on Amen there
[1:58:59] was a
[1:59:00] word and that word was that by his
[1:59:02] stripes we are healed and that word was
[1:59:05] manifested amen so this was we ate right
[1:59:08] before we went to service this was
[1:59:10] brother Chris's house and from here we
[1:59:11] had 20 minute service and then that was
[1:59:13] the that service the next slide this is
[1:59:15] Dad this is uh brother Leon just saying
[1:59:18] his test testimony in in Arad this was
[1:59:21] on I believe Sunday
[1:59:24] morning and then the next slide is um we
[1:59:28] were just eating more food
[1:59:31] um after the
[1:59:33] service and and and Pepsi and
[1:59:38] cola um but that's just the way that
[1:59:41] Romanians like to share their love is to
[1:59:43] feed you amen next slide there was it
[1:59:47] was this brother's birthday here so we
[1:59:49] said celebrated his birthday while we
[1:59:50] were down there we sang him happy
[1:59:51] birthday we had such a good
[1:59:53] time next slide it was this is a brother
[1:59:56] Gabriel's
[1:59:58] home and then this last slide here I
[2:00:02] wanted to just say the testimony for
[2:00:04] brother Ivon many many of you might have
[2:00:09] seen him in the pictures that we've
[2:00:10] showed you before but brother Ivon was
[2:00:14] um in November November 4th he had a
[2:00:17] brain stroke
[2:00:19] and um he was carried to the hospital
[2:00:22] and he was in the hospital with no
[2:00:24] chance of
[2:00:26] living He
[2:00:29] um there was a few brothers that was
[2:00:31] texting brother Matthew and myself about
[2:00:34] praying for um for him and and you know
[2:00:39] I I believe that the whole the whole um
[2:00:43] the whole country was praying for him to
[2:00:45] get well and people from here and from
[2:00:47] other countries and out I tell you what
[2:00:50] you know as they were sending us videos
[2:00:52] and pictures this was the first time
[2:00:55] that I was able to see him but the Lord
[2:00:57] brought him
[2:00:59] back he speaks he can hear his
[2:01:03] conscience about
[2:01:04] everything um he's been a testimony for
[2:01:07] this for this church amen and and we had
[2:01:11] we had a service there Sunday night
[2:01:12] after the Sunday morning service at
[2:01:14] brother Gabriel's but we had a Sunday
[2:01:16] Sunday evening service at at his at his
[2:01:18] church chur and the Lord was really
[2:01:20] there he really moved upon the scene and
[2:01:23] spoke to our hearts it was really a
[2:01:24] supernatural service it was it was such
[2:01:27] a blessed it was such a blessed
[2:01:29] Fellowship we had together the next
[2:01:31] slide here was at his home he he brought
[2:01:34] us he cooked for us and his wife and we
[2:01:37] we just had we just had a a blessed time
[2:01:41] but that's what the message does he he
[2:01:46] he was sitting in his hospital bed
[2:01:47] reading the Bible he did didn't care he
[2:01:49] didn't he didn't care if he didn't
[2:01:51] remember he didn't care if he couldn't
[2:01:53] understand he was just sitting there
[2:01:54] reading the Bible listening to the
[2:01:56] message and the doctor says ma'am he
[2:01:59] told his wife there's absolutely no
[2:02:02] hope I'm
[2:02:04] sorry this is as far as we as doctors
[2:02:07] can go it's in the hands of the Lord
[2:02:10] this is exactly the way the doctor put
[2:02:11] it and at that point the sister said is
[2:02:15] that's when I felt
[2:02:17] comfortable like she said she said when
[2:02:21] they said that I said that brought a
[2:02:22] comfort to my heart because I know that
[2:02:25] at that point God had that last
[2:02:28] word and now he's the testimony of the
[2:02:31] last
[2:02:32] word and so God bless you we truly
[2:02:34] appreciate you and and all that you've
[2:02:37] you've been for us God bless you in
[2:02:39] Jesus Christ's
[2:02:45] name that's
[2:02:47] wonderful amen you know there's a place
[2:02:50] where the prophet of God made a mention
[2:02:52] I I can't I just have to paraphrase it
[2:02:56] but he talked about the early church and
[2:02:59] what they did with what they had he said
[2:03:01] what should we be doing with what we
[2:03:04] have because we have so much more than
[2:03:07] they do I'd like to testify haven't been
[2:03:11] to uh Romania to eat how do you say
[2:03:14] cabbage rollal samala but I've had the
[2:03:18] best Samara in the whole wide world
[2:03:20] right here in Bedford Texas so uh you
[2:03:25] you know uh I just want to testify to
[2:03:28] that because that is absolutely the
[2:03:31] truth and uh uh my Romanian neighbors
[2:03:35] have tried to kill me four or five times
[2:03:38] by feeding me to death but uh we're
[2:03:41] grateful for that you know what inspired
[2:03:44] me so much was the brothers that were in
[2:03:48] the area uh that um brother uh Stephan
[2:03:53] shared with us and I hope you understood
[2:03:56] what he said here in America everybody's
[2:03:58] a
[2:03:59] Christian it don't mean nothing to say
[2:04:03] you're a Christian you a Christian
[2:04:05] everybody's a Christian Catholics are
[2:04:07] Christian Baptists are Christian
[2:04:09] methodists are Christians everybody and
[2:04:13] the cowboy games are Christians we're
[2:04:15] Christians right we're a Christian
[2:04:17] Nation you you know and uh Christians
[2:04:21] drink beer and Christians do this and
[2:04:24] Christians do that Christians smoke you
[2:04:26] know it it doesn't matter but he said
[2:04:30] there to be a
[2:04:32] Christian is a reproach yeah because
[2:04:36] they hold a
[2:04:38] standard that's not watered down like
[2:04:43] America so when you have those Believers
[2:04:46] there and they're making a stand they're
[2:04:49] bearing a great
[2:04:51] reproach and I want you to see how
[2:04:55] far that they've gone and I I
[2:04:58] appreciated our brother uh bringing that
[2:05:01] message leadership by the leadership of
[2:05:04] the Holy Spirit those people in a very
[2:05:08] difficult
[2:05:11] environment built that church and
[2:05:14] gathered themselves together and and
[2:05:17] God's moving and
[2:05:19] uh uh you know I look forward uh to the
[2:05:22] time because uh as soon as we put this
[2:05:26] behind us we'll be able to reach out and
[2:05:29] help uh the missionaries all around and
[2:05:33] we've got some tremendous Brothers here
[2:05:36] that are on fire for the Lord that have
[2:05:39] been taught right raised right they have
[2:05:42] a a love for this message and an
[2:05:45] understanding of how important it is to
[2:05:48] stay with it amen now a lot of people
[2:05:52] hear the message but they they haven't
[2:05:56] come to the revelation of what it means
[2:05:59] to have an absolute amen you know to
[2:06:02] have the final amen the place that
[2:06:05] answers all the questions and so it it's
[2:06:09] not so much of going out and telling
[2:06:12] people that God had sent a prophet they
[2:06:14] know that they've sent a prophet they
[2:06:17] they they they've seen the pillar of
[2:06:19] fire they've seen the cloud they know
[2:06:22] the it's open but they don't always
[2:06:25] realize everything that's within it and
[2:06:29] how complete if I could use the word I
[2:06:32] don't have a better word in my
[2:06:34] vocabulary but what a complete packag
[2:06:37] amen what a a a complete
[2:06:42] allinclusive gospel this message is and
[2:06:46] you know and uh Matthew has had some
[2:06:49] tremendous opportunities uh here
[2:06:52] recently I don't know if they call that
[2:06:54] a podcast
[2:06:56] Matthew Zoom uh uh Zoom that's I like
[2:07:00] that word uh when I grew up Zoom
[2:07:04] meant you know you zoomed here and you
[2:07:06] zoomed there now it means you look
[2:07:08] everybody but they've been able to reach
[2:07:11] out to ministers uh in India of
[2:07:14] denominational ministers in India
[2:07:17] Matthew's been a sharing the gospel in
[2:07:20] uh India and uh some o opportunities are
[2:07:25] coming up to possibly go to a A yuban or
[2:07:29] how do you say that
[2:07:31] yuban close enough for an
[2:07:34] Irishman all right and so
[2:07:39] uh say it
[2:07:41] loud bistan
[2:07:47] bistan so I I know I slaughtered it just
[2:07:51] like I Slaughter your
[2:07:53] names but I'm saying when you have the
[2:07:57] right
[2:07:58] spirit and you you God is seeking those
[2:08:02] to worship Him in spirit and in
[2:08:06] truth that's what God wants and God will
[2:08:10] provide the word so that they can
[2:08:14] worship in spirit and truth so we just
[2:08:17] want to always uh uh grateful for the
[2:08:20] Lord to uh that uh we can go out and
[2:08:25] share with our brothers and sisters and
[2:08:28] I it certainly seems like as hard as it
[2:08:31] is the spirit's moving there in Romania
[2:08:35] and the brothers are going to overcome
[2:08:38] amen it's given to the Overcomer isn't
[2:08:41] it so we're certainly grateful for that
[2:08:43] to see me I hope it puts your heart on
[2:08:45] fire if if you have a burden that help
[2:08:49] that little group there and and you want
[2:08:52] to uh pray about it and and and uh give
[2:08:58] a offering to them I'm sure if you give
[2:09:01] it to Cosman he'll make sure it gets
[2:09:04] down there to those brothers and and
[2:09:07] we'll see what we can do or if you want
[2:09:10] just um mark it out on on an envelope or
[2:09:15] on an offering and just put for church
[2:09:18] and Romania and then uh we'll we'll
[2:09:21] match whatever you give and we'll put it
[2:09:24] together and we'll send uh something
[2:09:26] from our church down there to help them
[2:09:29] so any we we love the Lord do you love
[2:09:31] the Lord amen okay do you feel like
[2:09:35] there's something in your heart that you
[2:09:37] want to share this message with somebody
[2:09:39] it's been freely given freely give have
[2:09:43] confidence it it the word stands on its
[2:09:45] own and if you speak the word god to
[2:09:48] stand behind it you know there's he he
[2:09:52] won't fail the word will not fail that's
[2:09:55] one thing you you ask and the scripture
[2:09:59] says we have not because we ask not and
[2:10:03] we ask not because we're not
[2:10:06] sure in other words we don't believe
[2:10:08] that he'll do it and we don't want to
[2:10:11] have a wait and see attitude we want to
[2:10:14] be proactive if I could use that
[2:10:16] terminology Pro active Believers uh we
[2:10:20] want to speak the word we want to
[2:10:23] believe the word God can do nothing for
[2:10:25] us until we confess it first amen so so
[2:10:30] let's do it let's keep those that are
[2:10:32] sick uh in our prayers those that are
[2:10:35] needy in our prayers let's pray one for
[2:10:38] another and uh once again uh like
[2:10:42] brother Matthew said uh before our
[2:10:44] services on Sunday morning uh we'll put
[2:10:47] the prayer requests up on the uh screen
[2:10:50] here I and I guess we can put them on
[2:10:53] the screen uh so this we'll have them
[2:10:56] the prayer request up there and then
[2:10:59] then they'll have quotes that to build
[2:11:02] your faith and then you can take those
[2:11:04] burdens on your heart so don't forget if
[2:11:07] there's a prayer request that you'd like
[2:11:09] to have uh you can email it and we'll

[2:11:41] request on your heart maybe read a
[2:11:44] scripture build your faith and pray for
[2:11:46] that that
[2:11:48] a person and like the brother told me he
[2:11:52] says we learn to
[2:11:54] know that God was real by the answered
[2:11:59] prayers in our
[2:12:02] home that's right and that's something
[2:12:06] that I thought was a
[2:12:08] wonderful wonderful
[2:12:11] explanation of how to raise a
[2:12:14] family amen we knew that God was real
[2:12:19] by the answered prayers in our home amen
[2:12:23] I hope that becomes Our
[2:12:25] Testimony that we know God is with this
[2:12:29] congregation by the answered prayers
[2:12:32] that he's given us amen God bless you
[2:12:35] tonight let's stand together if if you
[2:12:38] have an unspoken request and you'd like
[2:12:40] to lift your hand up to the Lord and we
[2:12:45] remember these brothers in Romania
[2:12:49] in prayer and if maybe you have
[2:12:51] something lying ahead of you this week
[2:12:54] that you would like to Lord to intervene
[2:12:57] I know we have some uh Believers that
[2:13:00] are looking for work uh we have uh uh uh
[2:13:06] financial needs uh within the framework
[2:13:09] of the church we have health needs uh
[2:13:12] within the framework of the church we

[2:13:43] asking that you would do uh exceedingly
[2:13:46] and abundantly above what we could even
[2:13:48] ask or think so let us bow our heads our
[2:13:51] gracious Heavenly
[2:13:54] Father we heard a wonderful testimony
[2:13:57] this
[2:13:58] evening of how that light and life
[2:14:02] follows your
[2:14:03] word and father how Believers
[2:14:07] are are
[2:14:12] thrilled when The Fellowship of The
[2:14:14] Gospel comes into their
[2:14:16] presence
[2:14:18] and that they can see that there's
[2:14:21] Believers that
[2:14:23] there's men and women that love the word
[2:14:27] of
[2:14:29] God lord and I know that in this age
[2:14:33] that we live in we
[2:14:35] believe that you brought forth a
[2:14:38] scriptural promise in our
[2:14:40] [Music]
[2:14:43] day and I know the world thinks it's
[2:14:46] foolish that
[2:14:53] we've heard a messenger from
[2:14:57] God lord and I know they label us a cult
[2:15:01] and
[2:15:02] they accuse us of following a man
[2:15:09] and but father you've opened our eyes to
[2:15:12] the
[2:15:14] scriptures Lord and we see beyond a
[2:15:17] shadow of the doubt it's the actual
[2:15:20] letters written on the pages that have
[2:15:23] come to life and manifested in flesh
[2:15:27] amen Lord we see the fruits of it we see
[2:15:32] the love that It produced and
[2:15:35] generate father we see the power of the
[2:15:38] promises of God coming to
[2:15:41] pass Lord and we know it's real
[2:15:45] amen and Lord because it's so proven and
[2:15:49] Vindicated Lord we gladly bear the
[2:15:54] reproach and you said in your scriptures
[2:15:56] if we're ashamed before
[2:16:01] man you'll be ashamed of us before the
[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:06] father but Lord if we confess you before
[2:16:10] man you'll confess us before the
[2:16:13] father Lord I'd like to testify that I'm
[2:16:16] not ashamed of this gospel I'm not
[2:16:19] ashamed of the Gospel you brought
[2:16:21] through the prophet messenger William
[2:16:23] brandom I'm not ashamed of it
[2:16:26] Lord because it's
[2:16:30] life and it's the power of God for
[2:16:33] salvation from this evil Wicked age that
[2:16:37] we live
[2:16:38] in Lord and I pray that we can always
[2:16:41] keep a Meek and humble
[2:16:45] spirit that Lord we won't be judgmental
[2:16:48] of those that you haven't opened their
[2:16:52] eyes as of
[2:16:54] yet but with love father we can
[2:16:57] encourage them along the
[2:17:00] wayen father that our lives would be
[2:17:02] salty amen that they might inquire of us
[2:17:06] what is this hope that you have of a
[2:17:09] resurrection thank you Lord
[2:17:11] Jesus and father that they would
[2:17:16] thirst
