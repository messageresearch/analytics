[36:13] verse
[36:18] and it says you have the 17th verse of
[36:22] the first chapter of
[36:24] revelations and when i saw him
[36:27] i fell at his feet as dead
[36:32] and he laid his right hand upon me
[36:36] saying unto me fear not
[36:39] i am the first and the last
[36:42] i am he that liveth and
[36:45] was dead and behold i am alive
[36:49] forevermore amen and half the keys of
[36:53] hell
[36:54] and of death heavenly father we ask you
[36:58] to bless
[36:58] your word to us in your precious name we
[37:01] pray
[37:02] amen amen god bless you may be seated
[37:08] just a a short time of
[37:12] fellowship together this is uh i guess
[37:15] what they call
[37:16] easter season it's uh easter
[37:20] time in fact it just seems like it comes
[37:22] upon us
[37:23] like all of a sudden we're here
[37:27] and i was at my mom's house and
[37:31] i was driving down some of the streets
[37:33] with leslie
[37:34] where i grew up and and uh
[37:38] come across this a park where
[37:41] we all just kind of played as kids where
[37:43] the
[37:44] rec center was and this sunday
[37:47] they're having a bunny trail and
[37:51] you know and i i just sat back and and i
[37:53] i
[37:54] i thought you know
[37:58] such a wonderful time of year
[38:02] what it is that we're celebrating
[38:06] and it's been the truth of it's been so
[38:09] uh taken away from
[38:12] uh mankind that the
[38:16] the fact that god so loved the world
[38:19] that he gave his only begotten son
[38:22] that that would have been good enough
[38:25] that if i would have just known
[38:27] that uh that
[38:30] my sins were forgiven and there'd be
[38:33] nothing
[38:34] uh laid to my charge and and that i
[38:37] could have lived
[38:39] a good life by following the things of
[38:42] the lord i'd be blessed
[38:44] my conscience would be clear i would
[38:47] have
[38:47] peace and especially looking around and
[38:52] seeing all the people that are in
[38:53] turmoil and
[38:55] and the people that are depressed and
[38:57] the people that are on
[38:59] drugs and alcohol and and
[39:02] lined up to see the psychiatrist and
[39:05] and uh i could have just sat back and
[39:07] thought well look at how
[39:09] a happy i am and and
[39:13] what a great comfort in a peaceable life
[39:17] that i have that would be a reward to me
[39:20] in comparison
[39:21] to the misery that is out there
[39:24] you know i mean people can't get along
[39:27] and marriages don't last
[39:29] they seem to fall apart and out
[39:32] and if it just just be able to sit back
[39:35] and say because i
[39:36] followed the bible and i i followed this
[39:40] great man
[39:42] the lord jesus and i did what he said
[39:45] and i stayed away from hurting people
[39:48] and i stayed away from stealing and i
[39:50] kept the commandments
[39:52] the peace and joy that it gives me
[39:54] that's wonderful
[39:56] but just think he proved to us
[39:59] that there is more to come
[40:03] you know i i i like that part
[40:07] okay we've only had a foretaste of glory
[40:10] divine
[40:12] the joy that we feel and the confidence
[40:15] that we have
[40:16] it is just a just such a small
[40:20] a portion of of what laid they had
[40:24] and that's what he did on that great
[40:26] beautiful day
[40:27] you know that he rose he he you know he
[40:30] said that
[40:31] that that i i'm i'm he that was
[40:35] uh i'm alive he says i'm he that's alive
[40:39] in other words i'm not history anymore
[40:42] i'm present i'm alive i'm he that's
[40:44] alive
[40:45] and i'm forevermore i'm the same
[40:47] yesterday
[40:48] today and forever i was dead
[40:53] okay you know what i mean but i'm alive
[40:56] and uh
[40:56] and and so and fear not i i just like to
[41:01] it just made me think you know i i guess
[41:05] i would
[41:05] say that all of a sudden easter's here
[41:08] and uh i think next weekend there's an
[41:10] easter meeting and many of our
[41:13] people will be uh going over to have a
[41:16] time of easter and a time of fellowship
[41:19] and get together with other believers
[41:22] that believe that he's a risen
[41:25] from the dead that he overcame death
[41:29] hell and what is hell health's a
[41:31] separation from god
[41:33] he's overcame man's separation for god
[41:36] he brought us back into communion
[41:39] he brought us back into fellowship and
[41:41] so now we can sit back and we know that
[41:44] we're
[41:45] that all the joy that we have in this
[41:48] life
[41:48] it is just something to let us know
[41:52] that there's a greater life to come and
[41:54] because
[41:55] that he has risen from the dead that's
[41:58] the life that we're living for we're
[42:00] living for that promise
[42:03] and it just seems like the enemy wants
[42:05] to take
[42:06] this world and this life and
[42:09] swallow us up he wants us just to get
[42:15] so caught up in the burdens and the
[42:19] struggles of this life and he he just
[42:21] keeps making the struggles
[42:23] harder and harder you know i uh we were
[42:26] spending a lot of time with my mom and
[42:29] telling us you know
[42:30] of of things that it was you know when
[42:34] they
[42:34] they used to have milk bands does
[42:36] anybody ever remember a milkman
[42:39] i guess i'm probably the oldest person
[42:41] in the building
[42:42] at this evening and so i remember a
[42:45] milkman i remember the little
[42:47] quart bottles of milk and sitting on our
[42:51] porch
[42:51] in a little wire basket and getting the
[42:54] milkman and
[42:56] right before i left california we had a
[42:59] a milkman that came to our house and
[43:02] brought milk and ice cream
[43:04] and all those things now i think milk
[43:07] was 50 cents a gallon i
[43:09] i don't know what it is now i don't even
[43:12] know if you can buy a gal in a mill but
[43:14] anyway
[43:15] i bet you it's over two dollars right
[43:17] for a gallon a mil
[43:19] yeah no wonder i don't go shopping i i
[43:22] get mad at the whole store
[43:24] you know what i mean a banana for a
[43:26] dollar
[43:27] you know what i mean uh just think you
[43:30] could work a whole hour and buy a gallon
[43:32] of milk and a banana
[43:35] and and it just it you know it just
[43:38] she just seems wants to rob us
[43:42] of our joy but our joy is in the
[43:45] resurrection
[43:47] that's what houses our joy that's what
[43:51] houses our hope that's what houses the
[43:54] reason that we live
[43:56] the way that we live is because of the
[43:59] great hope
[44:00] of the resurrection and and so at easter
[44:04] i just like to read a few statements and
[44:06] just kind of ramble on a little
[44:08] bit this evening but when he proved by
[44:11] his promise
[44:13] this great conquering power that he had
[44:17] on easter so he proved on easter
[44:20] this great conquering power that he had
[44:25] so when he came out of that grave
[44:28] he proved that he had a power
[44:31] that would conquer and it was a great
[44:35] conquering power so we're not
[44:38] just honoring him for a good life
[44:42] and which he did we're not honoring him
[44:44] for the works
[44:46] and the miracles that he did that we
[44:48] could look at that
[44:50] and say he he he could heal the sick he
[44:53] could
[44:54] uh he could cast
[44:57] out devils he could do all these things
[45:00] but yet it yet it wouldn't matter if he
[45:04] still had to die
[45:06] and we we might have been able to say
[45:09] well if we followed what he taught
[45:12] and we followed the life pattern that he
[45:15] had
[45:16] and we lived by his rules and we treated
[45:20] people the way
[45:21] he treated another if we pattern our
[45:24] lives
[45:24] after his life we might be able
[45:28] to uh encompass and possess
[45:32] the love and the power to do these same
[45:35] works
[45:36] but yet our end would be the same
[45:40] we would die so we would have had a
[45:43] better life
[45:44] and a happier life and a joyful life
[45:47] and a more peaceful life than the person
[45:50] that was always looking over their
[45:51] shoulder to see if the cops
[45:53] were gonna come after him or the person
[45:56] that was always in a conflict with
[45:58] somebody
[45:59] fussing and arguing and and had a
[46:01] miserable life we'd have a great life
[46:04] a peaceful life we'd had a wonderful
[46:06] time
[46:07] living the uh and and being
[46:10] happy following the teachings of jesus
[46:13] and we might have been able to pray
[46:14] people and see great things happen
[46:17] but the final end would have been death
[46:21] the difference would have been we would
[46:22] have died happy
[46:24] and somebody else would have died
[46:25] miserable
[46:27] and that that would have been it but we
[46:30] realized that
[46:32] he had a greater power
[46:35] a greater conquering power and that
[46:38] power
[46:39] that he had was the conquering power
[46:42] that he conquered death he conquered the
[46:46] finality
[46:47] of death and even someone that
[46:50] dies now they still
[46:53] if they're not alive then they still
[46:57] have death it's just that death hadn't
[47:00] finished its course
[47:02] you understand so they die but they
[47:05] don't die you just
[47:06] leave this body so that death they leave
[47:09] this body
[47:10] and then they go face the fire that
[47:14] that is waiting for them the reward of
[47:17] their works and then
[47:18] that death and that separation of god
[47:21] finally takes its toll and they're no
[47:24] more
[47:25] so eventually they are eternally
[47:27] separated from god
[47:29] and therefore they die and that's what
[47:32] we would refer to as the
[47:34] second death so you know death has
[47:38] two parts it has the part of the
[47:42] separating of your body
[47:44] and then it has the death of your spirit
[47:48] and that's the second death and so we
[47:51] sit back and we
[47:52] realize that this great easter what this
[47:56] great easter did
[47:57] for us is that we realized that he
[48:00] had the power to conquer
[48:04] the first death
[48:08] but that would have been good
[48:12] but we wanted something that proved that
[48:16] he had conquered
[48:17] the second death and that's what he said
[48:21] i'm the one
[48:22] that liveth i'm alive in other words the
[48:26] second death hasn't had taken his toll
[48:28] on me
[48:29] and i live forever more in other words
[48:33] the life that's in me is eternal life
[48:37] not only did i conquer the first death
[48:40] but i
[48:40] conquered the second death and so
[48:44] that that's just such a wonderful thing
[48:46] to realize
[48:48] because i would hate to think that i
[48:50] lived here
[48:51] and then i got like this next death but
[48:55] i had the second death but no
[48:57] he's overcome at all
[49:00] and that's what's so beautiful about
[49:03] easter he says when he proved by his
[49:05] promise this great conquering power that
[49:08] he had
[49:08] on easter he proved that he could
[49:11] conquer death
[49:12] hell and hell's what produces the second
[49:17] death
[49:18] and the grave i am he that was dead
[49:22] and is alive again
[49:26] and alive for evermore
[49:31] and have the keys to death
[49:34] and hell and the grave what a statement
[49:38] for anybody to make
[49:40] not only did he make it but he already
[49:43] proved that he had what he claimed to
[49:46] have
[49:48] now listen to this great statement
[49:51] that he makes so when he arose and he
[49:55] came back
[49:56] and then he promised us the same spirit
[50:00] that was in me the same spirit
[50:03] that quickened me the same spirit that
[50:07] gave
[50:07] me power over death
[50:11] hell and the grave i'm going to send
[50:15] that same spirit back to you
[50:18] this is my gift to you
[50:22] the gift of god is eternal life
[50:25] through christ jesus that's the great
[50:28] gift
[50:28] that that god gave us so it's not
[50:31] just that we live right it's not just
[50:34] that
[50:34] we're preaching a morality it's not just
[50:37] that we're preaching a righteousness
[50:40] but we've actually received something
[50:42] from him
[50:43] that goes beyond this world it goes
[50:47] beyond
[50:48] this life as we sometimes we refer to it
[50:51] as a token
[50:53] another and a token is like a ticket
[50:56] it's something that
[50:57] that allows you to to get in to some
[51:00] place
[51:01] it's like a car wash you know i hate
[51:03] those car washes that give you tokens
[51:07] you know what i mean they don't give you
[51:09] quarters so you walk away with anything
[51:12] you have a token that says that you it
[51:15] it's paid for so you gotta
[51:17] use them up we went to a token car wash
[51:20] and
[51:20] we we vacuumed the car with it and we
[51:23] were done so
[51:24] we still had tokens left so we had to
[51:26] stay there five more minutes and
[51:29] and vacuum the mats and vacuum
[51:32] underneath the seat why we wanted to get
[51:34] our monies worked you know
[51:35] and uh uh because we had a token well
[51:39] that's what a token is
[51:40] it's a price paid that's right so he
[51:43] comes
[51:43] and he says that this great spirit
[51:47] this great conquering power he gives it
[51:49] to us
[51:50] and it becomes the token it becomes
[51:54] the price paid it becomes that
[51:57] that now we possess the payment
[52:01] for the second death we
[52:04] because we're all gonna suffer the first
[52:06] death and that's the
[52:08] the of the hour of the end of it all
[52:11] when he raptures his church
[52:13] and we all have that great hope that uh
[52:16] that we're here for that in that event
[52:19] what we really ought to be hoping for is
[52:21] that we have the
[52:22] faith to accept it and see it
[52:26] when it happens i think if this if the
[52:28] rapture came
[52:30] right now i think it would scare the
[52:32] gizzard out of most of us
[52:33] instead of it being something that we
[52:35] really uh
[52:37] really embraced you know whoa the
[52:40] rapture's on i've been waiting for this
[52:43] i'm actually going to change and i'm
[52:45] going to submit my body
[52:47] and my spirit to a transformation
[52:51] i'm going to step out no getting on your
[52:53] cell phone and calling your wife and
[52:55] saying sweetheart
[52:56] i won't be home for dinner i'm going to
[52:58] be raptured
[53:02] you know you would just have to walk
[53:04] right into it
[53:06] step right there it's almost going to be
[53:08] like a realm
[53:09] appears in front of you and you've got
[53:12] to step out of this realm just step
[53:14] right into that other realm
[53:16] just step across
[53:19] yes sir you know okay well you sure not
[53:21] you sure not bear
[53:22] be wanting and loving all kinds of
[53:24] things in this world you're not going to
[53:26] tell them angels
[53:28] well can i take this with me can i take
[53:30] that with me
[53:31] no can you imagine the choices put
[53:33] before you
[53:34] and now or never
[53:39] how long will you have to make the
[53:40] choice a twinkling of an eye
[53:44] just that quick that that's what we're
[53:46] living for
[53:47] that's what we're preparing for that's
[53:50] what we're
[53:51] that's what we're working towards this
[53:53] is what this
[53:54] a cry and our heart is is to overcome
[53:58] the cry in our heart is to overcome
[54:00] is for the purpose of i want to overcome
[54:04] because i want to be in rapturing
[54:06] condition
[54:07] i want to be mentally sharp for the
[54:09] rapture i want my
[54:10] spirit hungry for the rapture i want to
[54:13] be ready to cross over
[54:14] to step the divide i want to have that
[54:17] great spirit of life in me
[54:19] i want something in me that identifies
[54:22] with it
[54:23] so when it comes it it's like a magnet
[54:26] together it comes together
[54:28] and it's that last it's that other piece
[54:31] of the paper
[54:32] that just fits together and it's i'm
[54:34] gone
[54:36] and i'm out of here so uh it's it's that
[54:40] that great beauty he says now he says
[54:44] but he has already proved that he had
[54:48] what he claimed to have and that's what
[54:51] he did he said i'm i
[54:52] i'm i'm life that was his testimony i am
[54:56] the way the truth the life
[54:58] and now he comes back and he proves
[55:02] that he possessed what he was talking
[55:04] about
[55:05] and and brother bam goes on to say i
[55:08] think
[55:08] god hasten that day in other words
[55:12] bring that day to us even so come
[55:16] quickly lord jesus
[55:17] lord we want that day bring that day
[55:20] make us ready
[55:21] i'm hungry in my heart i want to
[55:23] overcome what do
[55:25] what is it that i want to overcome i
[55:27] want to overcome hell death in the grain
[55:29] i want to overcome this world that's
[55:32] killing me spiritually
[55:33] i want to overcome this world that just
[55:35] makes me old and
[55:37] feeds me corrupt food and and brings
[55:40] sickness and disease and heartache i i
[55:44] want out
[55:48] you know i really think that's what i
[55:50] i'm hearing for
[55:52] so many people they just they hear the
[55:54] stuff that's going on
[55:55] and they shake their heads and they say
[55:57] i'm just so sick of this world
[56:00] i have people that aren't maybe don't
[56:02] even have the hope of the resurrection
[56:06] like we do saying i'm sick of this place
[56:09] i'm sick of politics i'm sick of
[56:12] the world i'm i don't even want to read
[56:14] the newspaper anymore
[56:17] you know the all there is is atrocities
[56:20] going on and and you can't even seem to
[56:24] get your mind to think
[56:26] i i thought of the other day
[56:29] as many of you know my mom's still being
[56:32] on my heart from the trip
[56:34] but my mom's a catholic
[56:37] and so you know she watches the mass and
[56:41] watches catholic television and and i'll
[56:44] sit in there sometimes and
[56:46] listen to the priests talk and the nuns
[56:49] talk and
[56:50] everything and it's oh don't think
[56:52] they're way out in left field
[56:55] they're so close it would deceive the
[56:59] very elect
[57:00] it's just they happen to have mediators
[57:03] and saints they pray to and
[57:05] they think they could say the priest
[57:07] changes the body and blood and the
[57:09] pope's the vicar of christ
[57:11] well you know i i thought you know our
[57:13] prophet taught us that
[57:14] this is the age of of the woman
[57:18] and it is and i don't mean that negative
[57:21] but the
[57:22] the the true christian woman is the
[57:25] representative
[57:26] of the true church and the other woman
[57:29] is the representation of the other
[57:31] church she appeared appeared to be
[57:34] beautiful but
[57:35] there was death in her
[57:38] and so there there's a great move
[57:41] as you know in our country today
[57:45] to first of all to
[57:48] withstand the word of god and the word
[57:51] of god said that cr he
[57:52] created them male and female and male
[57:55] and female they he created
[57:57] them so that we know that god created a
[58:00] man and a woman
[58:01] and they're trying to do away with that
[58:04] now the whole idea
[58:06] of everybody being equal well let me
[58:09] tell you something
[58:10] god does not deal an equal
[58:14] equal is a sweetener
[58:18] for coffee there
[58:23] the equality of god the equality of god
[58:26] is he has no
[58:27] respecter of person
[58:32] he doesn't judge you on your personality
[58:37] if he judged us on our looks i would be
[58:39] there for sure
[58:41] but he does he doesn't he doesn't he
[58:43] doesn't judge us
[58:45] on our looks
[58:48] you know he doesn't judge us on our
[58:50] swagger and our personality
[58:52] you know i see some people walk and you
[58:55] just think that
[58:56] that they just are walking with so much
[58:58] jive you know what i mean that you just
[59:00] think that
[59:01] oh my goodness what do you why are you
[59:04] walking like that well i'm
[59:05] king of the world you know what i mean
[59:08] and uh
[59:09] uh you know so it he doesn't judges find
[59:12] me that
[59:13] he he himself doesn't judge us
[59:17] it's his word that judging us we're
[59:19] judged by the
[59:21] the word of god that's what the that's
[59:23] what it comes down to and
[59:25] and so it's not an idea of being equal
[59:29] the
[59:30] equality only comes in the fact
[59:33] that he created some vessels unto honor
[59:38] and some unto dishonor it can
[59:41] that's where it goes well so the this
[59:44] equality movement
[59:46] has not just in the political world
[59:50] but it had moved into the catholic
[59:52] church
[59:54] where many of the people that
[59:57] are in the catholic church they they
[1:00:00] believe
[1:00:01] that mary is the mother of god
[1:00:06] okay and and first of all that's wrong
[1:00:10] she's not the mother of god there was
[1:00:14] no part of mary used in the birth of
[1:00:17] jesus
[1:00:18] that's right god created both
[1:00:22] parts in the womb of mary and
[1:00:25] let him come into the world in the same
[1:00:28] path that every sinner came into the
[1:00:31] world
[1:00:32] but he was the lamb of god there was no
[1:00:35] sin or unbelief found in him and the
[1:00:38] very
[1:00:39] creation of man in in the in the
[1:00:42] physical realm
[1:00:43] was based on sin so he he overcame
[1:00:47] that sin right there
[1:00:50] showing that he could overcome every
[1:00:52] part of it
[1:00:53] and so that he came into the world and
[1:00:56] he he was sinless but every part
[1:00:58] but they believe that mary is the mother
[1:01:02] of god and therefore being god's mother
[1:01:05] she must be equal
[1:01:08] and so there there was a great movement
[1:01:11] and there's still a great movement in
[1:01:13] the church
[1:01:14] and let me tell you something about
[1:01:16] great movements
[1:01:17] what a movement does when people believe
[1:01:20] a certain thing
[1:01:21] it might get repudiated and it might get
[1:01:24] turned down but they keep prevailing
[1:01:27] and working on the thinking and working
[1:01:30] on the people
[1:01:32] until it becomes a consensus and then
[1:01:35] it's accepted
[1:01:38] that's why you've got to be anchored in
[1:01:41] the word of god
[1:01:43] that nothing moves you from the
[1:01:45] scriptures
[1:01:49] you've got to have an absolute you've
[1:01:52] got this bible has got to be
[1:01:54] an absolute and i can say it
[1:01:57] like this and by the revelation
[1:02:01] of god's word because god deals by
[1:02:04] revelation
[1:02:06] uh anybody can take this bible
[1:02:09] and somebody will come up with all kinds
[1:02:11] of different ideas
[1:02:13] but when this bible is revealed to you
[1:02:16] and quickened to you then that spirit
[1:02:20] can go through that word of god and put
[1:02:22] every bit of it together
[1:02:25] amen you
[1:02:28] you don't find this message outside of
[1:02:30] the scriptures
[1:02:32] it's revealed to you in the scriptures
[1:02:36] it get it shows you what this scripture
[1:02:40] means
[1:02:40] and now that scripture takes on life but
[1:02:43] so what they've decided was was they
[1:02:45] decided that
[1:02:46] mary was equal to jesus
[1:02:50] therefore she also is a forgiver of sins
[1:02:57] and she also is one that can make
[1:03:00] restitution and pay the price
[1:03:04] and therefore sheik now becomes an
[1:03:07] object
[1:03:10] of worship and
[1:03:14] that is paganism
[1:03:18] the very fact that they pray to saints
[1:03:21] is paganism
[1:03:23] well you say well why are we worried
[1:03:25] about the catholic church
[1:03:28] boy that's the beast that's the one
[1:03:31] that's going to control it all that's
[1:03:33] the one that's going to get the money
[1:03:35] that's the one
[1:03:36] that's going to birth the unity of the
[1:03:39] church and the
[1:03:40] unity of politics and religion coming
[1:03:44] together
[1:03:44] you know a good cruise through your
[1:03:46] church age book wouldn't be a
[1:03:48] a bad idea to really understand that
[1:03:51] all this political and church and all
[1:03:54] this coming together and
[1:03:56] and all these things that are are
[1:03:58] raising up
[1:03:59] is is all for the purpose
[1:04:02] and so they they have this great thing
[1:04:05] that mary
[1:04:06] and jesus are equal and that you can
[1:04:09] pray to mary
[1:04:10] for the forgiveness of sins and there's
[1:04:13] thousands and millions of people in
[1:04:15] service
[1:04:16] around the world going to mass and
[1:04:18] instead of praying to the lord they pray
[1:04:20] to mary
[1:04:21] they already pray to mary
[1:04:24] but now they're giving her power to
[1:04:26] forgive sins and
[1:04:28] and and hey but
[1:04:32] we sit back but think people are taking
[1:04:34] these thinkings
[1:04:36] in their mind and and so
[1:04:40] uh going back to this great statement
[1:04:42] that we said i think god hasten the day
[1:04:45] when we as christians who believe this
[1:04:48] bible
[1:04:49] can prove what we are talking about
[1:04:53] that's what makes the salt of the earth
[1:04:58] as the sister said a while ago that's
[1:05:00] right
[1:05:01] the world is looking for this salt
[1:05:05] when we can prove by our lives
[1:05:08] and by the bible that our lives
[1:05:11] are vindicating that word to be
[1:05:14] living today that is the day
[1:05:18] that we're looking for
[1:05:22] that's the day that we're looking for
[1:05:24] when our lives can
[1:05:26] prove that
[1:05:29] this bible that our and vindicate the
[1:05:33] word to be living today
[1:05:36] that that's what we want that's our cry
[1:05:38] to overcome
[1:05:39] that's what's part of our overcome i
[1:05:41] want to overcome
[1:05:42] everything in my life that's keeping
[1:05:45] this word from
[1:05:46] living in me now that so we
[1:05:50] want to uh we understood this morning
[1:05:53] just
[1:05:53] in fellowshipping that that in order to
[1:05:56] overcome we have to come face to face
[1:06:00] with the things
[1:06:01] that were desiring to overcome
[1:06:06] we've got to come face to face with him
[1:06:09] you know we can't skirt the issue we
[1:06:11] can't blow it off for another day
[1:06:14] if it's there it's there if it's in our
[1:06:17] life it's in our
[1:06:18] life there's no need starting to say
[1:06:21] i'm never going to do this again i i
[1:06:24] made up my mind that that this is the
[1:06:27] last time
[1:06:28] i'm going to do this and this is the
[1:06:30] last time i'm gonna get mad
[1:06:32] this is the last time and make this
[1:06:35] great constitution of
[1:06:37] this is it i made up my mind i'm never
[1:06:39] again
[1:06:41] no we gotta say we gotta come face to
[1:06:44] face with it
[1:06:46] we got to say here it is this is my
[1:06:49] problem
[1:06:50] i i i realize it and
[1:06:53] and you and that's something that's
[1:06:55] going on in you
[1:06:56] privately that you you're the only
[1:07:00] one that knows if everybody knows the
[1:07:04] the the side of the parts of you that
[1:07:07] are human and ungodly you do
[1:07:11] we you know when i look out here you're
[1:07:14] all in church so
[1:07:15] you know you're 99 there already
[1:07:20] and that's just from my view but you
[1:07:22] know what's going on inside of you
[1:07:24] and then we added a little bit to that
[1:07:26] this morning saying no
[1:07:27] you got to come in contact you got to be
[1:07:29] honest you got to look in the mirror you
[1:07:32] got to realize i've got to deal with
[1:07:34] this person
[1:07:35] and then we understood that overcoming
[1:07:37] is not just quitting
[1:07:38] but you've got to replace
[1:07:44] whatever it is that you're wanting to
[1:07:48] change
[1:07:48] with another work or another action
[1:07:52] or as we said this morning you've got to
[1:07:55] take up the
[1:07:56] responsibility
[1:07:59] that you left to participate
[1:08:04] in the thing you want to overcome
[1:08:06] another
[1:08:07] word for works is responsibility to take
[1:08:10] the responsibility
[1:08:12] so we're looking what we're looking for
[1:08:15] is we are we're looking or we're
[1:08:18] salty we're thirsty
[1:08:22] we're hungering after that that that
[1:08:26] day that our lives are
[1:08:29] vindicating that word to be
[1:08:32] living today that our lives are
[1:08:35] vindicating that word
[1:08:37] so we saw the message vindicated
[1:08:41] and that's what we talked about we just
[1:08:43] don't have a message
[1:08:44] but we've got a vindicated message so
[1:08:47] it's like you have two great scholars
[1:08:50] here
[1:08:51] and one takes the bible and he teaches
[1:08:53] all their doctrine and
[1:08:55] their idea of the godhead and their idea
[1:08:58] of grace and their idea of calvary and
[1:09:00] great intellectual enticing words
[1:09:02] and they build into this great picture
[1:09:04] and here comes another person
[1:09:06] now he might not be so much an oratory
[1:09:11] and he might not have be able to put all
[1:09:13] kinds of different things together
[1:09:15] things you never thought about
[1:09:17] and everything and give a great
[1:09:20] explanation
[1:09:21] but when it comes down to it he does the
[1:09:23] same
[1:09:24] works of the resurrection
[1:09:30] he prays for the sick and they get well
[1:09:32] he cast out devils he does
[1:09:34] the things he discerns the thoughts
[1:09:36] intents of the heart
[1:09:37] so now you have one that's by word only
[1:09:40] and paul said i didn't come unto you
[1:09:42] with enticing words
[1:09:43] i didn't come unto you only with the
[1:09:47] words but i came unto you with power and
[1:09:50] demonstration of the spirit
[1:09:53] so when you weigh them equally
[1:09:57] one's got proving that this word
[1:10:01] lives
[1:10:04] and and proving that it's made alive
[1:10:07] today
[1:10:08] every promise go into all the world and
[1:10:11] preach the gospel
[1:10:12] lay your hands on the sick and they
[1:10:14] shall recover there's one
[1:10:16] proving that that power
[1:10:19] is alive today so the power that
[1:10:22] overcame hell death in the grave that
[1:10:25] quickening power
[1:10:27] is now been returned back to the
[1:10:30] believer
[1:10:31] so that they can possess that same
[1:10:34] spirit
[1:10:35] that quickened him and so now we sit
[1:10:38] back and we say the same spirit that
[1:10:40] dwell in jesus christ
[1:10:42] if that same spirit dwell in you it will
[1:10:45] also quicken you it will also give you
[1:10:49] power to overcome
[1:10:54] and so we we sit back in it and
[1:10:57] and that's what we believe he says
[1:10:59] that's what we're looking for
[1:11:02] that's what we're hungering for and and
[1:11:06] i'll just go back to this this great
[1:11:08] principle of the deep
[1:11:10] calling to the deep
[1:11:13] you only call for it because it's there
[1:11:16] to respond
[1:11:20] how many years have we been in this
[1:11:22] message that we've followed this for
[1:11:24] years and years
[1:11:25] but now there's more of a cried
[1:11:27] overcoming there's ever been
[1:11:32] why because the spirit's there
[1:11:35] to respond it's the time
[1:11:40] it's the hour and so the very fact that
[1:11:44] there was sulfur
[1:11:46] remember the story of the boy in the
[1:11:48] petal
[1:11:49] there he couldn't have been craving
[1:11:51] sulfur if there wasn't a sulfur to
[1:11:53] respond
[1:11:54] the only the great reason that we've got
[1:11:56] this great cry to overcome
[1:11:58] because there's overcoming power to
[1:12:01] respond
[1:12:03] luther never cried for what we cried for
[1:12:09] wesley never cried for what we cried for
[1:12:12] pentecost never cried for what we cried
[1:12:15] for
[1:12:16] pentecost cried for a working spirit now
[1:12:19] we're we're not crying to stay
[1:12:23] we're trying to leave we're crying for
[1:12:27] the spirit
[1:12:28] that will quicken us we're crying for
[1:12:30] the spirit that will change us
[1:12:32] we're kind of for the spirit that gives
[1:12:34] us of the the
[1:12:36] the the earnest and and the seal
[1:12:39] yes sir amen amen that we
[1:12:42] possess and it's ours and we hold the
[1:12:46] token
[1:12:47] that's that's paid the price
[1:12:51] of the second death
[1:12:54] and he said that's what the scripture
[1:12:56] says in romans 8 11
[1:12:57] if this spirit that raised up jesus
[1:13:00] christ be
[1:13:01] in you it will
[1:13:04] also quicken your mortal body not only
[1:13:07] did he prove
[1:13:08] to us that he was jehovah redeemer
[1:13:12] and had power over death hell in the
[1:13:14] grave but he
[1:13:15] also giving us access to the same
[1:13:19] spirit that we
[1:13:22] ourselves can have the assurance
[1:13:26] that we too are quickened
[1:13:30] by that spirit for the spirit that
[1:13:33] raised
[1:13:34] jesus from the dead dwells in your body
[1:13:37] it will also quicken your
[1:13:40] mortal body just think what it is that
[1:13:44] we're celebrating
[1:13:46] we're celebrating the spirit that rose
[1:13:48] jesus from the dead
[1:13:50] has returned and we can possess
[1:13:54] that spirit also not just the doctrine
[1:13:58] now that's why that we we that
[1:14:01] it's not just the doctrines of brother
[1:14:04] branham that we're trying to learn
[1:14:10] but it's the spirit that performed
[1:14:14] and vindicated the word that's the
[1:14:17] spirit we want
[1:14:19] and that's because he said this simple
[1:14:21] thing he says now
[1:14:23] it's the spirit that quickens it's not
[1:14:26] the word that quickens
[1:14:31] it's the spirit that quickens not
[1:14:34] the word that quickens but listen
[1:14:38] it's the spirit that quickens
[1:14:41] the word or
[1:14:45] gives the word life
[1:14:48] gives it wings to fly
[1:14:51] gives it access it's the spirit
[1:14:55] that does that now we're saying this
[1:14:58] because
[1:14:59] so many times we we think that i get the
[1:15:03] spirit
[1:15:03] and and that's the end of it
[1:15:07] but that's not how the spirit works
[1:15:10] the spirit quickens it it it's
[1:15:13] it's the quickening power that that just
[1:15:16] keeps it coming it's something present
[1:15:20] and uh
[1:15:24] and he says so now here's a great
[1:15:25] statement that i want my minister
[1:15:28] brothers to try to understand this
[1:15:31] in the beginning god the great spirit
[1:15:35] he wasn't even god then he was the
[1:15:38] eternal one
[1:15:40] god is an object of worship
[1:15:43] he had nothing to worship him
[1:15:47] there was no angel no nothing
[1:15:50] just god alone he alone is eternal
[1:15:56] but in order to be god he had to have
[1:15:59] something
[1:16:00] worship him so he created angels
[1:16:05] being serpents and so forth to worship
[1:16:08] him
[1:16:08] this great plan began to unfold
[1:16:12] but remember you in the statue
[1:16:16] that you are in this morning if you are
[1:16:19] not
[1:16:20] in his thinking then you are not now
[1:16:24] there is some part that is
[1:16:28] in you that is eternal
[1:16:31] and eternal only belongs to god
[1:16:36] though there's some part in you okay
[1:16:40] and in god he was thinking of you
[1:16:44] sitting right here where you are now
[1:16:48] he is thinking i stood in the
[1:16:51] i stood at the pulpit this morning
[1:16:54] because he in the beginning because he's
[1:16:57] eternal
[1:16:58] and you being sons of god and daughters
[1:17:02] of god
[1:17:03] then you were in his thinking in the
[1:17:05] beginning
[1:17:07] then when the holy spirit come and you
[1:17:10] are
[1:17:10] on earth walking around here
[1:17:14] in the center way down in your life
[1:17:17] there is something
[1:17:18] you don't know what is taking place
[1:17:22] but you're hungry
[1:17:26] now that that principle it still applies
[1:17:31] you don't know what what it is
[1:17:34] but but you're hungry
[1:17:39] you don't know what it is you're just
[1:17:41] walking around here you're living right
[1:17:43] you're doing good
[1:17:44] and all of a sudden you've got this cry
[1:17:46] in your heart i want to overcome
[1:17:48] i want to go higher yes sir
[1:17:51] what's what's happening that that
[1:17:55] that was laying in you all the time
[1:17:59] but you've been in this message 15 20
[1:18:01] years and you've never felt the way you
[1:18:03] feel now
[1:18:07] there's never been an urgency we never
[1:18:10] really thought it would could possibly
[1:18:12] come to an end
[1:18:14] but now we realize this thing could be
[1:18:16] gone in a minute
[1:18:20] i know most of you don't spend a lot of
[1:18:23] time on the news and
[1:18:24] and i don't recommend it you spend a
[1:18:27] week in a room
[1:18:28] in on the news and listening to all that
[1:18:30] stuff up there
[1:18:31] will you'll be in my office asking me if
[1:18:33] you should take valium or something
[1:18:39] because it's depressing
[1:18:43] it's depressing they're worried about
[1:18:46] wars they're worried about their lives
[1:18:49] changing
[1:18:51] well you know you don't have to worry
[1:18:54] about your life changing
[1:18:56] if god's changed your life
[1:19:03] amen you want change the change you want
[1:19:07] is a change of body
[1:19:10] a change of what world you live in amen
[1:19:13] all your desires turn around
[1:19:15] everything changes in you okay so this
[1:19:19] this spirit we're just walking around
[1:19:21] here and
[1:19:22] but there's something in you he says
[1:19:25] oh i oh a wayward man or woman this
[1:19:29] morning
[1:19:29] when you're sitting here and there's
[1:19:31] something in you
[1:19:32] telling you this is right it's the holy
[1:19:36] spirit
[1:19:37] seeking you out to bring you to the
[1:19:40] knowledge of the truth
[1:19:42] of this hour that we're now living
[1:19:46] not some hour that's gone by but the
[1:19:49] hour
[1:19:50] now you understand that we're not the
[1:19:52] spirit is not
[1:19:54] moving on us to bring us to the
[1:19:56] knowledge
[1:19:57] of the hour of the vindication
[1:20:00] and the delivering of the message
[1:20:05] we believe that exactly the same way we
[1:20:09] believe that jesus walked on earth
[1:20:13] but we're not worshiping the jesus that
[1:20:16] walked on earth
[1:20:17] because he said i am he that was dead
[1:20:20] and alive forevermore that's the jesus
[1:20:23] we're working
[1:20:26] the one that's here to give to
[1:20:30] us the quickening power
[1:20:33] over death hell and the grave
[1:20:37] that's the one we're worshiping
[1:20:42] not a history study
[1:20:46] that's what we've got to say that's what
[1:20:47] the prophet god said i think we're
[1:20:49] getting too many people to church
[1:20:52] instead of the christ
[1:20:55] what is he he is the resurrection
[1:21:00] and the life that's how he describes
[1:21:03] himself
[1:21:03] i am the resurrection and the life
[1:21:06] i'm not the man that did the good works
[1:21:09] i'm more than that
[1:21:12] i am resurrection
[1:21:16] if you have me you will rise also
[1:21:19] as i rose and i overcome so will you
[1:21:23] rise and you will overcome
[1:21:26] i have prayed for you i have died for
[1:21:30] you
[1:21:31] and now i'm here to quicken
[1:21:34] or to make alive the word
[1:21:38] seed that's in you to to make it
[1:21:42] alive so it's the spirit
[1:21:45] that quickens it it's not
[1:21:48] uh
[1:21:52] it's not that he said now
[1:21:55] the statue that you're in this morning
[1:21:59] if you you're always in this thinking so
[1:22:02] you were
[1:22:02] always there and um
[1:22:05] so we we understand what this easter
[1:22:09] means to
[1:22:10] us what makes it so
[1:22:13] so beautiful and the and i'm going to
[1:22:16] close
[1:22:16] but
[1:22:20] he says now let me read this
[1:22:24] the holy now the holy spirit is here on
[1:22:26] earth
[1:22:27] looking out those individuals that god
[1:22:30] has ordained to life
[1:22:32] in this age
[1:22:37] and as soon as he finds it
[1:22:41] it does it does just like it did
[1:22:45] on jesus christ
[1:22:48] the great super son of god
[1:22:52] who redeemed us all it comes down
[1:22:55] and takes its place of abode
[1:22:58] in that human life
[1:23:02] so when it finds you and you
[1:23:06] and you see it it comes down and it
[1:23:09] takes a boat
[1:23:10] in that human life so now it's there
[1:23:13] you're possessing now notice it brought
[1:23:16] the quickening power
[1:23:18] now that quickening power that came upon
[1:23:21] jesus and quickened him to manifest
[1:23:25] every promise of the word of that day
[1:23:29] so does the holy spirit comes down upon
[1:23:32] us
[1:23:32] in this day it's not a mockery holy
[1:23:36] spirit
[1:23:38] you're not the devil mocking the holy
[1:23:41] spirit
[1:23:42] but it's the real true holy spirit
[1:23:45] it'll manifest the promises of this
[1:23:48] hour so you understand that he gives
[1:23:52] this quickening power
[1:23:54] this power that raised him from the dead
[1:23:57] he sends that power in you to take a
[1:24:00] boat
[1:24:01] but it didn't make you perfect all at
[1:24:04] once
[1:24:07] now it's abiding in you
[1:24:10] to bring the promises to life
[1:24:18] you're in it maybe you don't even know
[1:24:20] the promise is there
[1:24:22] maybe you don't even have the revelation
[1:24:25] of your
[1:24:26] position maybe you don't even understand
[1:24:29] where you fit in but because you're a
[1:24:33] son of god
[1:24:34] because you believed because you
[1:24:37] accepted the sacrifice
[1:24:39] because you've come to that place where
[1:24:41] you hungered and thirst that spirit now
[1:24:43] comes and takes its abode in you
[1:24:47] now it's there
[1:24:51] but it's there to quicken
[1:24:57] it's there to quicken the word
[1:25:00] so you have it because you've been
[1:25:03] predestinated to have it
[1:25:06] he found you and when he found you
[1:25:09] and there's something in your heart
[1:25:11] cried out that's right
[1:25:13] and you saw it you accepted that and it
[1:25:16] took its abode
[1:25:18] now it's abiding there
[1:25:21] if you abide in me and i abide in you
[1:25:25] the works that i did you shall do also
[1:25:29] it didn't say all of a sudden
[1:25:34] you're going to walk out there and start
[1:25:36] laying your hands on the sick
[1:25:40] you're not going to drive down to john
[1:25:42] peter smith and put it out of business
[1:25:49] that spirit's abiding to quicken that
[1:25:53] word
[1:25:55] in season
[1:25:59] there's many things in this message that
[1:26:01] we've read for years and we've never
[1:26:03] seen
[1:26:05] but all of a sudden our eyes are coming
[1:26:08] open
[1:26:10] we're starting to understand things the
[1:26:12] world
[1:26:13] has got in a condition to create the
[1:26:17] contrast
[1:26:18] that we can now see it for what it
[1:26:21] really is
[1:26:25] amen and that's what he said i counsel
[1:26:28] thee to buy of me i said that thou
[1:26:30] mayest see and now the eyes have of
[1:26:34] god's word
[1:26:35] the condition of the world the hatred in
[1:26:37] the world
[1:26:38] the bias the prejudice all those things
[1:26:40] that's in the world today
[1:26:42] the miserable america that's right
[1:26:47] it's true in our hearts we're starting
[1:26:49] to say hey
[1:26:50] i'm of another kingdom
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:26:54] i'm out of this world
[1:26:58] every time i get all upset about things
[1:27:00] that are going on
[1:27:01] leslie just says you know this world is
[1:27:05] not my home
[1:27:07] [Applause]
[1:27:10] and i want to say wait a minute would
[1:27:12] you shut up i want to be mean and mad
[1:27:14] and angry
[1:27:24] oh i don't want any part of it
[1:27:31] when they changed presidents i didn't
[1:27:33] change
[1:27:36] i didn't have to say a new prayer in the
[1:27:38] morning i didn't have to say a new
[1:27:40] prayer at night
[1:27:41] i didn't have to go find a new bible
[1:27:46] i didn't say oh the holy spirit i had
[1:27:49] four years ago isn't the holy spirit i
[1:27:51] need today no
[1:27:53] no nothing's changed everything's on
[1:27:56] time
[1:27:57] god has everybody in their place within
[1:27:59] the whole world
[1:28:00] the world is doing what they're doing
[1:28:04] for us
[1:28:05] [Applause]
[1:28:11] they're the ones you know the next
[1:28:14] message in line
[1:28:15] is seed is not air with the shock
[1:28:21] they pull away from us they spill us
[1:28:25] out of their mouth they don't want no
[1:28:27] part of us
[1:28:28] we don't have any part in their
[1:28:29] political world we don't have any part
[1:28:32] in their social world
[1:28:33] we don't have any part in their what's
[1:28:35] politically correct
[1:28:37] what's socially correct what's the right
[1:28:40] way to think
[1:28:40] what do you what we teach what they
[1:28:43] teach in school we don't have no part of
[1:28:45] those things
[1:28:46] i'll tell you i don't care what they
[1:28:47] teach in school as long as you're
[1:28:48] teaching your kids the bible
[1:28:50] you're teaching them jesus christ you're
[1:28:53] teaching them the commandments of god
[1:29:01] but if you don't meet your
[1:29:02] responsibility
[1:29:05] then you'll never overcome this world
[1:29:07] it'll overcome you
[1:29:11] but the spirit is abides with us
[1:29:15] so it walks with us so like i said to
[1:29:18] the brother i said
[1:29:20] you know i look at my little grandson
[1:29:23] and i i think he's he's two
[1:29:27] uh he's gonna be two this coming uh
[1:29:30] october so he's just at that
[1:29:32] age you know and uh uh you know brother
[1:29:34] brown said in the tape today
[1:29:36] he said that well you know you take on
[1:29:38] the responsibility when you have those
[1:29:40] little children
[1:29:41] little hand prints on the wall
[1:29:45] well my uh i think that my
[1:29:49] my grandson has some great ability to do
[1:29:52] artwork he's an artist because he took
[1:29:55] the permanent marker
[1:29:57] and he drew a beautiful mozart or
[1:30:00] michelangelo painting
[1:30:01] on the uh on the hardwood floor
[1:30:10] matthew wants to know what removes it
[1:30:12] and i'm saying no you ought to frame it
[1:30:15] let's cut that out and put it on the
[1:30:17] wall
[1:30:19] knew what i was saying he finally says
[1:30:22] i'm sorry dad for all the walls i marked
[1:30:24] up all the floors
[1:30:27] yeah everything i did i i i i'm sorry
[1:30:30] for all those things
[1:30:32] but you want to know something because
[1:30:35] those children
[1:30:36] are eternal when it comes time
[1:30:40] that that word comes by them
[1:30:43] in their life that spirit will be there
[1:30:46] to quicken it
[1:30:48] and to cause them to accept it
[1:30:51] that's right now they may shirk that
[1:30:55] and run away from it but all they're
[1:30:58] doing
[1:30:59] is running down a hard road that's going
[1:31:02] to produce a lot of misery
[1:31:04] but let me tell you something he's not
[1:31:07] going to lose
[1:31:07] one of them
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:13] just the way it is
[1:31:17] i got advice for every teenager you want
[1:31:20] to drive
[1:31:21] obey mommy and daddy
[1:31:25] be good because they have the keys to
[1:31:29] the car
[1:31:32] peter had the keys to hell and death
[1:31:35] jesus had
[1:31:36] the keys to hell mom and dad he got the
[1:31:38] keys to the car
[1:31:40] so keep a right attitude keep a good
[1:31:42] spirit
[1:31:43] learn to say yes mom yes dad help carry
[1:31:46] out the trash help do all the good
[1:31:48] things
[1:31:49] because they got the keys to the car
[1:31:51] that's just some common
[1:31:53] sense that i threw in i don't have a
[1:31:55] scripture for it
[1:31:56] except for if you obey your parents you
[1:31:59] have a long life
[1:32:01] now i always took that as a threat
[1:32:08] that if i didn't obey them they may end
[1:32:10] my life
[1:32:12] earlier
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:17] he said so the holy spirit
[1:32:21] are gained to the life in that legion as
[1:32:23] soon as he finds it
[1:32:27] it does like it did on jesus the great
[1:32:30] sun super
[1:32:30] god redeemed us it comes down and takes
[1:32:34] its place and abodes in the human life
[1:32:37] now notice brought brought the
[1:32:39] quickening power
[1:32:41] now this quickening power that came upon
[1:32:44] jesus
[1:32:45] quickened him to manifest every promise
[1:32:49] of the word of that day
[1:32:52] so it came on him to bring it to life
[1:32:58] so don't forget this it's the spirit
[1:33:00] that quickens
[1:33:01] but that spirit quickens in
[1:33:04] time and in season
[1:33:08] and in circumstances and in situations
[1:33:14] so it's not like you all of a sudden i
[1:33:17] have the spirit
[1:33:18] and now i'm just going to live my life
[1:33:20] just the way no
[1:33:21] that spirit's with you it walks with you
[1:33:25] and all of a sudden you come to a place
[1:33:27] in your life
[1:33:28] where you need to step higher you need
[1:33:31] to overcome
[1:33:32] you need a victory you didn't even know
[1:33:35] you needed that
[1:33:37] or all of a sudden the holy spirit comes
[1:33:40] and
[1:33:40] sprays the windex of god's word on the
[1:33:43] mirror
[1:33:44] and it wipes the mirror clean and you
[1:33:46] see yourself for what you really
[1:33:48] are and you go oh
[1:33:53] wow that's not what i was looking at
[1:33:58] but the spirits there to quicken the
[1:34:02] change
[1:34:05] to give that word that
[1:34:08] brought you under conviction to forgive
[1:34:11] that word
[1:34:12] life and wings
[1:34:15] to fly and to manifest
[1:34:20] it's not a one-time thing
[1:34:24] it's something that comes and i'll be
[1:34:27] with you even in you to the end
[1:34:31] i will lead you and
[1:34:34] guide you into all truth and
[1:34:36] righteousness
[1:34:38] i will give you i sav when you need it
[1:34:41] i'll give you white remnant when you
[1:34:44] need it
[1:34:44] i'll give you gold trident fire when you
[1:34:47] need it
[1:34:50] so you can't perfect yourself
[1:34:54] but you've got a promise that i'll not
[1:34:58] leave you nor forsake you so you
[1:35:00] know that that power that you possess
[1:35:04] that life you possess that that life
[1:35:08] will quicken you and make that word
[1:35:11] alive in you when the hour and time
[1:35:14] comes
[1:35:16] and we'll close with this
[1:35:19] deceiving to manifest the promise the
[1:35:23] hour
[1:35:24] when it fell upon luther it manifests
[1:35:28] that promise of that hour
[1:35:32] luther never prayed for the sick
[1:35:40] the promise was there he was reading the
[1:35:42] same bible that we read
[1:35:45] but it never the spirit never brought
[1:35:47] that to life
[1:35:49] here was a guy that was lighting candles
[1:35:52] saying mass believed that he was
[1:35:55] changing the
[1:35:56] wafer into the literal body and blood of
[1:35:59] jesus
[1:36:00] he was sitting in his little box and
[1:36:02] people were telling their sins
[1:36:04] he thought he was forgiving their sins
[1:36:07] that was the condition he was in
[1:36:10] and one day he read the just shall live
[1:36:12] by faith
[1:36:14] he's got the revelation of justification
[1:36:18] what gave that luther was a a church age
[1:36:23] messenger
[1:36:28] he was a catholic priest but yet that's
[1:36:31] who he was
[1:36:32] and that spirit came and
[1:36:35] quickened that portion of the word that
[1:36:39] was for him
[1:36:41] it didn't quicken all the word it didn't
[1:36:44] quicken
[1:36:45] all the word for all the ages it didn't
[1:36:47] have them speak in tongues it didn't
[1:36:50] have them do anything
[1:36:51] it just quickened the allotted
[1:36:54] word for that hour
[1:37:01] the same spirit that quickened
[1:37:05] luther was the same spirit that
[1:37:09] quickened the resurrection
[1:37:14] but it only quickened to that power
[1:37:17] it said
[1:37:21] it manifest the hour and when it fell on
[1:37:24] wesley
[1:37:25] it manifested the promise of that hour
[1:37:29] and when it fell in this day it
[1:37:32] manifests the promise of this hour
[1:37:34] and when it fell on moses it manifested
[1:37:37] the power of that hour
[1:37:39] and when it fell upon noah it manifests
[1:37:42] the promise of that hour
[1:37:43] and when it fell on jesus it manifests
[1:37:46] the promise of
[1:37:48] that hour it's the holy scripture
[1:37:51] coming down to quicken make alive
[1:37:55] those people that are foreordained of
[1:37:59] god
[1:38:00] to be in the rapture
[1:38:06] hallelujah
[1:38:10] what's he quicken us for
[1:38:14] he's not quicking us for a new
[1:38:17] manifestation
[1:38:20] of works and gifts
[1:38:24] he's not putting the cry in you to
[1:38:26] overcome
[1:38:28] for any other reason than
[1:38:31] the rapture
[1:38:34] that's the promise that lies before us
[1:38:37] not another messenger not another works
[1:38:40] this
[1:38:41] is our easter we are easter
[1:38:48] it's here to quicken i'll tell you
[1:38:54] that's the resurrection i'm looking for
[1:38:57] it's the resurrection of the rapture
[1:39:01] i don't want to be resurrected back into
[1:39:03] this life
[1:39:10] no i'm looking for the quickening power
[1:39:14] that quickens our mortal body
[1:39:18] that's a promise of our hour that's the
[1:39:22] promise of
[1:39:22] our day it's looking to quicken for the
[1:39:25] rapture
[1:39:28] that is if that true eagle
[1:39:31] he will understand the message of the
[1:39:34] hour if he's that true eagle he who have
[1:39:38] ear to hear let him hear
[1:39:40] in other words the reason that you're
[1:39:42] not
[1:39:43] looking for another pentecost the reason
[1:39:46] you're not looking for the restoration
[1:39:48] of the gifts
[1:39:49] we're not looking for a power in this
[1:39:52] church
[1:39:53] to prove that he's resurrected
[1:39:59] we're looking for the power in the
[1:40:01] church
[1:40:02] that produces rapturing faith that was
[1:40:05] revealed that's what was hidden those
[1:40:07] thunders
[1:40:08] that's what they revealed in those seals
[1:40:11] we've got to know what
[1:40:12] it is that we're hungering for what it
[1:40:15] why we're
[1:40:15] calling for the overcoming power we're
[1:40:18] calling for the overcoming power
[1:40:20] because we want the spirit in our midst
[1:40:23] that'll rapture us
[1:40:28] that's what we're after that's what we
[1:40:31] want to demonstrate
[1:40:34] that's the good news the spirit is here
[1:40:38] it's a message that calls us out
[1:40:42] and prepares us for a rapture
[1:40:45] it's not a new intellectual
[1:40:48] path uh professor
[1:40:51] teaching of the bible
[1:40:58] because when this church leaves they'll
[1:41:00] go on praying for the sick
[1:41:03] they'll go on think that being saved
[1:41:08] and they will be saved here at the
[1:41:10] judgment
[1:41:11] yes i'm not living for the judgment
[1:41:21] that true eagle it just
[1:41:24] it just comes in there it says
[1:41:28] see he that understandeth
[1:41:32] he that knoweth his place in this
[1:41:35] hour he that heareth my words
[1:41:39] and believeth on him that sent me
[1:41:44] hath present tense
[1:41:48] eternal life and shall not come into the
[1:41:51] judgment
[1:41:52] but has already passed from life
[1:41:56] unto death that's what we're possessing
[1:42:01] the works the miracles
[1:42:05] the deliverance those things are done
[1:42:08] by quickening
[1:42:13] and these things we will do
[1:42:16] if the spirit so permit but let us move
[1:42:19] on
[1:42:20] to perfection
[1:42:28] then when this new eternal life dwells
[1:42:31] in you
[1:42:32] it is the potential or the
[1:42:35] earnest of you being quickened
[1:42:39] from mortality to immortality
[1:42:44] that's how you know that's the proof
[1:42:46] because that spirit's in you
[1:42:48] so you know what that spirit's to do
[1:42:52] it didn't just come to make you miracle
[1:42:55] wonders
[1:42:58] it came to change you from mortality to
[1:43:01] in
[1:43:02] mortality so let me say this again when
[1:43:06] the spirit has found you
[1:43:09] the individual and has come
[1:43:12] upon you it is the potential
[1:43:15] of your eternal inheritance that god
[1:43:20] thought of you and made
[1:43:24] for you before the foundation
[1:43:28] of the world
[1:43:32] when it comes upon you what is it
[1:43:36] it's the thought
[1:43:40] hallelujah my goodness
[1:43:43] we've we've always made it like a third
[1:43:45] person
[1:43:47] like an anointing when the quickening
[1:43:50] power comes
[1:43:51] on you or the holy spirit comes on you
[1:43:54] it is the thought that god
[1:43:57] had of you before the foundation of the
[1:44:02] world
[1:44:03] your theophany has found you
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:11] when the spirit has found you the
[1:44:14] individual
[1:44:15] and has come upon you it is the
[1:44:18] potential of your eternal
[1:44:20] inheritance that god thought of you
[1:44:24] and made for you before the foundation
[1:44:27] of the world
[1:44:28] that is your potential
[1:44:31] like if you ask me for an oak tree
[1:44:34] and i gave you an acorn
[1:44:38] now the life for the oak tree
[1:44:41] is in the acorn but you have to wait
[1:44:45] till it grows up
[1:44:51] i'm going to keep marching because it's
[1:44:53] growing up in me
[1:44:55] it's growing he's quickening me he's
[1:44:58] giving me a call to overcome
[1:45:00] the spirits coming now to vindicate and
[1:45:03] make that word alive
[1:45:04] i feel the pull hallelujah
[1:45:09] i got the potential in me and as the
[1:45:12] word starts coming
[1:45:14] as i start coming out of the storehouse
[1:45:16] the spirit's there to quicken it
[1:45:18] make it alive give me wings and pretty
[1:45:21] soon it's going to give me wings right
[1:45:23] on out of here
[1:45:29] but it's got to grow up so do we
[1:45:34] when you receive the holy spirit of god
[1:45:36] it's god
[1:45:37] potential waiting upon you
[1:45:41] that he that has already recognized
[1:45:44] you and you are
[1:45:48] sealed by the spirit
[1:45:51] of promise of god unto the body of
[1:45:55] christ
[1:45:56] and when god looks down at calvary
[1:45:59] and saw jesus dying he not only
[1:46:02] died for his bride
[1:46:06] the body which is in the word
[1:46:09] church the church that believes his word
[1:46:12] for the ages whether it's feet
[1:46:15] body head or whatever it is
[1:46:20] what was he waiting for he'd been
[1:46:23] waiting for
[1:46:23] everything to grow up
[1:46:27] so you have the spirit
[1:46:31] but we always teach you get the spirit
[1:46:34] it's all over
[1:46:36] you don't need nothing else no
[1:46:40] you still need revelation you still need
[1:46:43] to overcome
[1:46:46] but what's the spirit there to do it's
[1:46:49] to give
[1:46:49] the word life
[1:46:53] they overcame by the word of god and
[1:46:56] their testimony
[1:46:59] and then and this is as we finish
[1:47:02] he says
[1:47:06] it's christ who was bleeding and dying
[1:47:09] and god looking upon him saw
[1:47:13] his resurrection and the church raised
[1:47:16] with him
[1:47:17] on easter
[1:47:20] oh what a great finish work now i want
[1:47:23] you to get
[1:47:24] all of this together because i've got
[1:47:28] something here a little bit i want to
[1:47:30] say the lord willing

[1:47:36] the quickening power of your
[1:47:38] resurrection

[1:47:43] then
[1:47:44] dwelling in you the potential of it
[1:47:48] and you are now on your way
[1:47:52] growing to the full
[1:47:56] resurrection

[1:48:05] into the full
[1:48:09] resurrection he is here

[1:50:14] fruit was in the seed
[1:50:18] every apple was in that seed of that
[1:50:21] apple tree
[1:50:22] but it had to grow in to the fruits

[1:50:45] what's terrible is when we get
[1:50:48] expectations
[1:50:50] and we get a plan and we think god ought
[1:50:52] to be working a certain way
[1:50:56] and and and then you get disappointed
[1:51:01] because i thought i should be doing this
[1:51:03] by now

[1:51:37] come yet

[1:51:42] already passed
[1:51:45] but it's it's the cause to make us think
[1:51:49] and remember he's the one that's in
[1:51:51] control

[1:53:48] mind to the lord and say lord i love you
[1:53:52] thank you for reaching your hand down
[1:53:54] for me
[1:53:56] lord and even when i first heard your
[1:53:59] message and i believed it in my heart
[1:54:02] that holy spirit
[1:54:04] took its abode right then
[1:54:09] and it convicted me of sin
[1:54:14] lord when i realized that all that long
[1:54:16] hair i had down my
[1:54:18] neck and everything father was
[1:54:22] was not the way that i was
[1:54:26] to be it was that spirit that
[1:54:30] quickened that word and brought that
[1:54:33] word to pass
[1:54:34] in my life the first haircut that i
[1:54:38] got way back when i was a hippie it was
[1:54:41] the holy spirit cutting my hair
[1:54:46] lord when i threw out the things in my
[1:54:50] life and i applied the token
[1:54:53] it was that spirit that was abiding with
[1:54:56] me
[1:54:56] and walking with me that created me a
[1:54:59] conviction in my heart
[1:55:01] and gave me the grace to apply the token
[1:55:04] and throw those things out
[1:55:09] lord all through the years as i've grown
[1:55:11] and i've made mistakes
[1:55:14] and i failed
[1:55:17] it was your spirit that abiding spirit
[1:55:21] that
[1:55:22] brought me back that convicted me of sin
[1:55:27] opened my eyes to see the word
[1:55:30] and then brought it to life it was the
[1:55:33] spirit that quickened
[1:55:36] and made the promise alive
[1:55:40] lord you've been there all the time
[1:55:45] and or may you haven't left us you
[1:55:48] haven't forsaken us
[1:55:50] we're just in an hour lord now that
[1:55:53] there's a deep
[1:55:54] calling for us to come to higher ground
[1:55:58] there's a call within us for more of you
[1:56:03] father we wouldn't have that
[1:56:06] thirst father if there wasn't water
[1:56:10] to satisfy lord we wouldn't be
[1:56:14] have the desire to come up higher unless
[1:56:17] there was a hire to come to
[1:56:21] and nor let us not be discouraged but
[1:56:24] let us be encouraged
[1:56:26] father let us thank you when we see the
[1:56:29] imperfection
[1:56:31] because you have something for us to
[1:56:33] replace that imperfection
[1:56:36] lord we've as we confront this great
[1:56:38] move of your spirit
[1:56:42] lord we're praying now that every member
[1:56:44] of this local assembly
[1:56:48] father that more and more are added to
[1:56:51] the core
[1:56:51] group more and more are taking their
[1:56:55] position and their place
[1:56:56] in this body or that the life of the
[1:57:00] resurrection could show
[1:57:02] father not in the pulpit but in the
[1:57:05] people
[1:57:08] that men and women in their life will
[1:57:12] know that
