can't wait for this to be over amen Amen brother Beno has a testimony amen if you could come at this time God bless you Saints oh I love that song see we sing it I want to be in that number but brother Brandon would say as a Believer you got to know that you know that you're going to be in that number so I sing I'm going to be in that number there's no wants if you don't see me you in the wrong place so when the Lord shows himself to you you got to testify of his goodness so today I guess yesterday really when I left got out of my car after class um I had left it I guess I left one of the doors open so it drained the battery in my car so then today coming to church when I tried to start the car it didn't start so I was like well Lord I want to go to church something got to give so happily the car started and I made it to church so I'm happy to be here but it wasn't easy to be here as I was driving um I don't know how fast that car would had to have been going but I didn't see him I I know I would have I would have already took my heavenly flight if that car would have hit me the way that car was moving and where I was he would have hit directly the driver's side and at the speed at which he was going it was I knew it was going to be certain death most likely on contact and uh I wish I was exaggerating but when you see the hand of the Lord move your vehicle out the way and your car doesn't get a scratch doesn't get a touch doesn't get anything you have to believe that we serve a living God and I don't believe in ironies but I believe in God appointed moments so as I was driving the song I was listening to has been blessing me for a while and in that song it says he won't fail he won't fail he'll never leave you he won't fail that bridge says I see it with my own eyes I've seen it in my own life he'll never forsake me he won't fail and if for me to not testify of what I saw with my own eyes today I'd be doing a disservice to somebody so I just share this testimony with encouragement to let you know the Lord's promises don't fail the scripture that says he protects the going and the coming back of his children I've seen it with my own eyes I've seen it in my own life and I can tell you he don't fail God bless you Saints amen aren't you glad for his keeping power amen we're certainly thankful amen amen our meetings are here so um brother Danny is in the building so we're certainly thankful and and I want to say um if you we we had uh I guess we realized that there were a couple PE couple of people that actually didn't sign up I guess they were waiting until the day off and the registration sat down so if you have not registered yet please let us know we don't want you to just show up and be unaccounted for so please let us know um if you haven't registered yet and uh remember you need to show up at 6:00 p.m. that's the start time so uh please show up on time it's going to be helpful to se everybody and and everything and and don't forget what we said last Sunday Come expecting come and and and have a desire in your heart to see a miracle to see God do something you know I know it's a banquet and it's a different format but we certainly want to come expecting and come prayed up and and you know and and do our part so God can do his part amen amen I know uh there was an email sent out uh our pastor Brother David lost his mom and we certainly want to uh uh be in prayer for the magary family I know even if it was expected it still hurts amen we certainly want to just lift them up in prayer that the Lord will comfort each and I'm pretty sure there's a lot of memories that's going on right now and we just pray that the whole process will go smoothly that God will uh certainly undertake for it amen um brother Jose writes the Believers in Mexico they've sent the greetings to the church and certainly appreciate that but Adrien uh please pray for uh Lis Armando he was rushed to the hospital with uh brain aneurism he a friend of uh my father-in-law so this is Sister Cindy's dad uh friend um we certainly want to remember him in prayer sister telini writes please pray for Anna pedroso uh uh she has a sore throat so we certainly want to lift her up in prayer that the Lord will touch her amen if you have a need upon your heart why don't you just lift your hand up to him at this moment a man you believe he's here in this building tonight Amen brother Tim Sal if we could just come and take those needs before the Lord the brothers that are taking the offering if you can come bow our heads oh Lord what a time what a time of preparation Lord not just for upcoming meetings but for this meeting Lord yes you said when you were here in the flesh take you heed watch and pray for you know not when the hour is what I say unto you I say unto all watch so I pray Lord tonight that maybe it's Eagles that have the crust built up on their heads Lord we go to the Rock and knock that crust off or Lord you can provide IAD that would clear the vision of those here tonight Lord that we might find our way the straight and narrow path Lord that you want us on Lord there's needs that have been witnessed and read and shown by the uplifted hand Lord we can't steer our way through these things as brother being testified Lord he couldn't even steer the car out of the way but Lord you saw fit to move it so Lord any of these things that would hinder Lord even physical needs can hinder Faith Lord we pray that you just come in a Great and Mighty way just absolve all the doubt the fear the ailment whatever it is Lord as our Prophet said just Lift us up in that higher realm that sick sense of Faith Lord we can look beyond the things that are seen look to the Unseen for Lord we have a provision we have a way already made just direct us to it we pray Lord Lord maybe in this service tonight Lord there'd be those that can finally break through and get what they have need of that's what we desire Lord is to have you move in a Great and Mighty way supernaturally Lord Quicken it to us by Your Word we pray Lord when your confirmation the Vindication comes through we say Amen to the word nothing can prohibit Lord for your word will not return void Grant it to us tonight Lord as we lean on you and we cast all of our burdens upon you these needs Lord just may our combined Faith Lord go to work on every need Lord just use the

father that caused you to come to this earth and bear the sufferings of the Cross because of our sins and our foolishness the fact that man didn't want retain you in their thinking and chose to go their own way but your undying care and mercy and love for us you came to redeem us Lord and not only that you sent your spirit to be in fellowship with us Lord we can't thank you we have not words we have not Spirit we have not mind to thank you adequately like the song says we we can't express our love but if you had listened to our hearts father they beat for you and the promise father that we have as this world becomes more corrupt farther away from you man standing in their own pride and thinking they can live without you father we we have the promise that you'll come and take us from this place and keep us from the destruction that's to come how can we thank you enough for that hope and that promise Lord we ask that you would bless our service tonight and when all the singing's done and the worshiping is over May each person have received something for from you that they can carry with them all the days of their lives that becomes a part of their character and a part of their nature father that your word would be their mind we ask these things this evening because we know you love us and we ask them in your name Lord Jesus in your name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated it's always nice to be in the house of the Lord and uh we're very grateful for that uh I I just want to uh as you know my uh mother passed away this morning at about 7:30 uh San Diego time about 9:30 our time and uh you know everything I asked the Lord he granted me you know I I never wanted my mother to be in a nursing home and and uh she never had to be in the nursing home and never wanted her in the hospital and she never had to go to the hospital and I I never wanted her to be alone uh when she died I I didn't want her to be alone and and uh God granted the mercy uh my mom had a good night's sleep and Sharon went in to be with her in the morning and uh my mom was there and Sharon began to sing and uh play some oldtime gospel singing and when she put on Amazing Grace and was listening and singing Amazing Grace uh my mom uh passed away to go to be the place that God had prepared for her and and I'm thankful for that uh I I I I just don't know how to thank the Lord enough uh uh you know just a year ago uh this last July I had flown my mom to Michigan and she celebrated her 101st birthday in Michigan with all her family uh we went out to a restaurant together and and she said you see that Ballroom she said that's where we had our senior your prom and uh and she got to be with her sister and all her nephews and nieces where she grew up and and uh I I'm just you know I just don't know how to say enough you know I had 102 years with my mother well I didn't have 102 years I I only had 75 of the 102 years but she was here for 102 years and and I'm trusting that I'll spend eternity with her you know my mom was a Catholic and and you know towards the end I I could tell that my mom just didn't have the confidence in what she believed to take her over and I she told she looked up at Sharon and she said Sharon I renounce all my traditions and uh you know little things like that are just the things that God does for you and uh so uh but I I want to just take this time to thank all of you for your prayers and uh your well wishes and all the texts and uh uh calls that we've gotten uh we certainly appreciate that and I know there's many of you whose parents have gone on to be with the Lord and and uh and we'll all come to that place if we T but aren't you glad we have a God that's so good to us and and I I'm thankful for the hope that I have in a Rapture in a translation whether I go by way of the Grave it doesn't matter uh doesn't mean one thing uh I just know one one thing that uh when this body be dissolved I have one waiting for me and this old coat will go back to where it comes from but I'm not going to the Grave you know you can put this old bag of bones and this old aching back ache knee ache you know face ache you can stick that in the ground and if you want to sit around and ball baby that's your problem but I'm going to be shouting and dancing on the other side and I'm not going to be feeling sorry for you one bit to be honest with you I'm not even going to look back I don't don't believe in communion of the Saints you know what I mean so uh uh don't don't get sad when I'm gone you know what I mean in fact I want you to sing when I died that that's the nicest thing that ever ever's done for you and uh that would just be happy with me and so I don't know when my time is but it's appointed and I've always lived by what the prophet of God said he said if God wants you here there's not enough sickness there's not enough Devils to take you and says if he wants to take you there's not enough doctors enough hospitals or enough medicine to keep you here and that's where we rest you know we can rest in that brother Johan we don't we don't have to worry he's got it he's got my children he's got you I I I thought thinking on my mom I thought well you know my mom brought two message preachers into the world one's a missionary and and uh you know and uh she's got three grandchild that preach the gospel and many Believers and uh so you know I just hope that God in his great Mercy takes it all into consideration he promised us that all that we love and all that loved us will be there we know there's a place in heaven that is for the bride it's a city where the lamb is the light and it's a great pyramid City and it's gorgeous and we know outside of that City there's Believers and people that receive reward and and they'll labor and life will carry on and they'll have peace and they'll come into that City and they'll pick the leaves of peace and enter in so whatever place I am be honest with you I'll be happy I made it because I had a whole lot piled up against me that would keep me not to make it but one day a man went to Calvary a kinsman redeemer and he laid a sacrifice down that could paid for all my sins and he knew everyone that I'd ever commit and they all laid with him on Calvary and they were nail nailed to that tree so I I'm not grieved in my spirit as some would I I I don't sorrow as those that have no hope uh I've never been much for all this traditional ball babying and screaming and laying on the floor uh you know that's passed down from tradition I I just think it's time that we start breaking the traditions of man because we're not a religion we're a people we're a we're a tribe we're an elected predestinated people that was called for a purpose and we have his name and we have a new name and that's what makes us live and so as you know we have this flesh and this flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and they're contrary but God put something in us that can never be taken from us and that was was his seed and he secured it by putting name on the lamb Book of Life and sealing it with his blood and you can't ask for any more than that amen so we're looking forward to our meetings uh uh brother Danny's with us to uh uh speak the next few nights uh youth banquet tomorrow and that's just for the Youth but Saturday night uh I service at 6:00 everybody's invited so uh everybody in the church is invited to that and I believe we'll have a little snack afterwards and that snacks for everybody and uh we're counting on brother Adrien making enough goodies that you'll all be filled up and then Sunday uh morning is it at 10: Sunday morning what 11 Sunday morning we'll have a service at 11: and then if anybody wants to come back in the evening and sing specials we can do that I know a lot of the young people like to sing and and so we'll just have a nice time this weekend and we want the social part of it but we really want this meeting to be a quality meeting for our souls and for our spirit and for our Direction in life and and the path that God wants us to walk and the way that he wants us to walk it and uh uh and we just pray that through the word of God and through uh times of fellowship and preaching the word that we'll be fortunate enough to find more of the perfect will than the permissive will and uh you know when I came into the message just at a young man I think I was 20 years old or so uh there was no young people I was the young people and uh uh and that's just how it was but now we've come such a long way to be able to serve our teenagers and our youngsters have Sunday school youth things so I think it's wonderful tonight we have brother Jeremy uh with us uh he's the uh only preacher that I love and hate at the same time and you know it just I just can't believe that he can sing and preach both and it wouldn't be so bad if if he just could you know sing better than me but he can preach and sing better than me so that just you know it it don't eat me up but so I've learned one thing I'm not going to be jealous I'm just going to sit back and enjoy it amen so I've asked uh uh brother uh Jeremy to come and and sing and preach for us tonight so I think he'll probably start off with sing singing and and that's good so do you love the Lord we're just going to let you remain seated he can have you stand when he reads the word for J Mary we appreciate you the work that you're doing and everything God bless you we really do love you brother and I just think your beard looks wonderful okay almost looks like mine not quite as gray that's the truth all right God bless you we're glad to hear here hallelujah well where do you go from there all right well I'll tell you what there's a song as he was singing we're going to sing this together if you don't mind key of C let's stand together I do want to get the humanity part of it out of it for myself and let you know that I am conscious of your time and some of you have to go to work so I'm not going to hold you as long as uh I want to hold you I want to hold you as long as God wants amen so we the Lord's laid something on our heart but uh since he's asked us to sing he was talking about what God how God has been faith and this song is all my life you've been faithful how many we all know this one right and I I don't want to sing by myself so let's just sing this together I love you Lord for your mercy never fails me all my days I've been heeld in your hands from the moment that I wake until I lay my head I will sing of the goodness oh please let it be more than a song right now all my [Music] life my life you have been no matter what it is all my life you have been so so good with every breath that I am a I will sing of the goodness oh I love this this verse I love your voice you have led me through the fire can you just worship Him in darkest night you were CL like no other I've known you as a father I've known you as a friend and I have lived in the goodness of God oh testify together now all my life all my life you have been faithful all my life you have been so so good with every bre that I am able I will sing of the goodness of God oh your goodness is running after Hallelujah your goodness is running after it's running after me oh your goodness is running after it's running after me with my life lay down I'm surrendered now I give you everything your goodness is running after it's running after me all my life Hallelujah all my life you have been f hallelujah thank you Lord for this all my life you have been so so good with every breath that I am able I will sing of the goodness of God oh I will sing I will sing of the goodness oh God hallelujah as Believers we have that promise that he'll be with us I'm so glad that he's with us he's in us to the End Amen I've been asked the question many times and I've even seen it even recently at home even people at on the job they say how do you how do you keep going through what you're going through and and still keep a smile on your face you know and honestly we don't have an answer that they'll understand only thing we can say is it's him and us and and that's the beauty of it it's not something that you can explain and it cannot be explained away it's just him and us and aren't you thankful for that amen that'll be all for tonight for now anyways if we can open our Bibles to the book of St Luke chapter 1 it's good to be here tonight and to be a part of the the meetings this weekend and it was a privilege to be here last year and uh now to be in a little bit just a little bit bigger of a building than what we were in last year and it's just it's a beautiful place and I know you've had a lot of work involved into it and to thank you to brother brother McGary for being a good friend he may be older by quite a bit but that's all right age doesn't mean wisdom brother Hallelujah is that good all right you can tell them at home man it's good to be with our our friend brother Danny as well and am me to come uh be with him and brother Matthew and each and every one of you tonight uh this sermon the Lord laid this upon our heart yesterday and uh I'm just going to say it's going to be an interesting title uh compared to what uh uh we were at lunch today and brother Matthew told me a sermon he preached recently and I just said Lord what are you doing and uh my my associate pastor at home brother Jr just said well the Lord has a sense of humor and I said I'm not laughing so we'll we'll get to this in a minute Luke chapter 1:30 and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end aren't you thankful for that then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth shall also uh shuh she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who is called baren very familiar verse verse here for with God nothing shall be impossible this is also important and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me what according to Thy word and the angel departed from her God bless you you can be seated this evening now we believe in this message and are blessed with actually the message itself self is Supernatural it is a supernatural message it is a powerful message the fact that you're here is a miracle the fact that not not so much that you drove here but the fact that you have been able to your your heart your eyes have been open to this message listen young people I know you might be tired right now but I want to encourage you with something you're still young you're good that's that's an encouragement but the fact that that you have in this evil age the opportunity to take this message and to be a part of this message is a miracle within itself and I I want to encourage you with this thought and it doesn't sound encouraging but our thought tonight is it doesn't take a miracle and we'll get there so just give us a few moments it doesn't take a miracle now brother Matthew said he just preached a sermon called look for the miracle toward the miracle watch for the watch the miracle watch the miracle so I am not eliminating the miracle but we want to as he as he spoke what it was about I found out that we were running in the same page now let's Mary said behold the handmade this is an expression of resignation to the will of God now it's hard for human beings to actually resign ourselves to God's will because a lot of times God's will is not our will all right but this is an expression of resignation to the will of God and of faith in the promise so this is a faith in something that was spoken to her not there was not anything that was yet seen or felt we'll get to this in a minute but to be the handmade of the Lord means to be submissive and obedient and is the same as saying I fully credit all that is said and I'm perfectly ready to obey all the commands of the Lord so when she makes this she is saying nothing else matters I am putting everything upon you all right now brother ROM and believest thou this he says and notice just as soon now she didn't wait till she was positive she was going to have this child she didn't wait till she felt life before she said anything about it she started right away testifying and telling people that she was going to have this baby when there was no signs of it yet I want that to sink in there was no signs of it God give us some more Marys he said give us more mares now don't wait for signs and wonders take God at his word and start rejoicing you see the the praise should not be waiting until something happens the praise should come before anything happens because it's not about what we see when did we get to a point in our relationship that is only by what we see I how the only way I know if God's moving is if I see something happen but the word of God told her that this is going to happen she said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word all right so notice what he says he says uh uh don't wait for signs and wonders take God at his word now we're not eliminating signs and wonders don't wait on them trust the word of the Lord start rejoicing and saying it's going to happen God said so now he says I believe if every patient in this building right now would accept it notice I love this upon the grounds of God's word that's what we're hearing tonight for to accept it upon the grounds of God's word not by the symptoms not by the the conditions around us not by what's happening in the area and and everything's falling apart we understand everything's falling apart what are we it doesn't matter what's going to happen in the election it doesn't matter what are we looking for some great hero no we're standing upon the word of God accept it upon the the grounds of God's word and believe it and start testifying and praise God for your healing now I don't want to just look at the this is healing uh so much in uh as physical healing but we deal with a lot of spiritual sickness a lot of mental sickness in the church in the body of Christ there's a lot of this that happens and because of the greatest battle ever fought which is in the mind and I'm talking about ministers fight it hello you're not just alone in this ministers fight it pastors fight it deacons fight it trustees fight it you fight it sitting in the Pew the greatest battle ever foughts in the mind and it wears you down and you get tired that's right you struggle you fight and and before you know it because of this you start looking for something to see you're looking for some big sign or something to take place because Satan's wanting you to look towards that it shouldn't take a miracle to get you to believe the word of God because the word has already been spoken the miracle has already come to pass oh let this sink in God is under obligation to answer his word I didn't finish this the meeting wouldn't close with one crippled person in here I believe that these meetings that we're going to have these upcoming meetings though there towards the youth that any person that steps into this building that they can leave completely healed listen I'm not going to limit it to anything I believe in the same power of God that was back in I believe he's greater today than he was 20 years ago you now he's the same God but I believe as a a believer of his word God help me to see help me to understand that you're here yes God is under obligation to answer his word now we understand that Miracles are a part of the Blessed word we understand that Miracles are a part of our our daily life but it is the word that is sustaining right now I I you say well brother Jeremy where are you at with Miracles I can tell you about all kinds of Miracles that have happened in my life I can tell you about uh you know about my daughter there's a miracle with my daughter how she was born and how God uh uh sealed the womb of my wife so that she could be born I believe that he's a uh he's a miracle workking God I uh just just at our meetings brother Matthew was there brother Bryce Collins was speaking we've had our house on the market for uh I mean for us it seemed like a long time it was uh least of seven eight months is what it was and nothing was happening Brother Bryce as the very end of the service began to testify about how uh uh and and I'm sitting in the back you know Pastor I'm I'm just burden it's towards the end of the service I'm praying for the people and I was listening to his testimony but I wasn't listening to it for me and so he began to tell about how he had had some land that that uh uh wasn't selling and and then uh uh uh just I can't remember the full part of it but all I know is that God miraculously came in and he just he just took God out of his word and he miraculously came in and sold those properties for brother Bryce well then he felt led to tell the testimony at another church and Arkansas and he was telling that testimony and his sister was sitting there and and she said as he was testifying they had two properties that were not even being looked at not even close to being looked at and she sat there and she said if if God could do that for brother Bryce he can do it for me and within two weeks I believe it was both houses were uh uh were under contract and sold and so he was testifying about this and I'm sitting there in the back and and all of a sudden just not an audible voice but something spoke to my heart and said and I can do it for you too well I I heard it but I didn't catch it and I sat there and I said what was that what was that and he says I can do it for you too and it just brought me under this thought I said okay Lord I don't know what that means I is it is it for my house is it for something else and I went up to the to the platform I don't know if brother Matthew remembered it or not but I I mentioned that testimony within two weeks we have it under had it under contract two weeks we had under a contract he said I can do it for you too right now my wife and sister Michelle are at home they drove home today to start packing because we have to have be packed and moved out by the ninth when God does something he does it so I'm not saying I don't believe that God can do these things but I don't need these things as Believers we should not need these things to keep us focused upon the word of God you see the signs and wonders of Miracle is an extraordinary event man manifesting divine intervention in human Affairs we know this and the signs are a part of the word of God they are written in there for us it says these signs shall follow them that are you're still with me these signs shall follow them that are you a Believer so then they will follow you the question it is the question that is here tonight is why do we see so many looking for these instead of Simply trusting him brother Brandon makes a statement in the great coming revival 1954 uh paragraph 11 he says now for just a few moments for your attention upon the great Revival that I believe that we're facing now he said the first thing God always brings warnings to the people before he sends a blessing or a judgment it's always been in the scriptures that God gives warnings or signs now we're taught in the Bible not to seek after signs because it would be a bad sign for us as a weak and adulterous generation to seek after signs but there's quite a difference in seeking after signs and then recognizing signs see a person that just seeks for a sign alone in other words Lord if you'll make it rain right now I believe that I'm saved see I don't have to ask that I'm saved according to God's word when I meet the conditions so I that that struck me as I was looking into this the the the aspect of seeking and recognizing the the word seek is to attempt or desire to obtain or achieve achieve something so you're always looking you're always seeking and and I and I'm for constantly seeking the word of God you follow what I'm saying I believe that we should be studiers of the word of God studiers of this message I believe that we should listen to the message daily all of these things but when we see uh when we look at the aspect of seeking for signs it's like we're always trying to obtain something and it's never enough it's not sustaining but if you look at the word recognizing it says whereas recognizing means to identify from knowledge of appearance or character so when the prophet of God says there's a difference in seeking and recognizing I want you to understand as Believers we're not seeking for these things but we recognize when the presence of God is moving why because of its character that's right you see that we we can't just look for the signs because we've been told in this day that there's going to be signs and wonders that are going to happen and it's going to look like the lord it's going to look like these things but we've got to recognize the character of the sign we've got to recognize the character of the word of God you see I don't I don't want to just say well I'm not going to do anything unless God sells my house listen that's not how I went down to that point I didn't care but we were my wife and I was like if it if it's not the will of the Lord then uh uh uh we're not going to sell it in fact this week uh uh we we have no we don't know where we're going to move yet and uh uh we we were going to look at a house when we got back and as soon as every house it's funny how this works but every house we' thought we're going to look at we're going to look at as soon as we try to go look at it it goes under contract I'm like okay and our realtor uh sent us a message and she said uh uh I can't remember but but basically Lord Jesus help us uh uh uh to find the right one you know open the door and I just sent her I said every time that door closes is the will of God it's not a negative thing it's a positive thing I want him to close the doors brother that I don't need to go through listen I've I've come too far to try to make something work I've come too far to try to force this into we we we don't have time for this anymore this is we're not here to try this out tonight we're not coming to these meetings to try and see if God can do something for us there is a word that will be spoken for you in these meetings and we need to come with preparation focused on the word of God I'm not here looking for a sign I listen Miracles can take place but it's not about that Miracle it's about the word of God that will get directly to my heart so it's recognizing the sign not seeking after these things it's it's being open to know that that because I'm a Believer these will follow me things will happen that are unexplainable you just heard a testimony tonight of something that is unexplainable these signs shall follow them that believe I want to go on the opposite side of it too what if something else would have happened he's still a Believer right you see I don't want to I don't want to belittle someone's faith because if I did that well then I would go back to the Dark Ages brother and I would say well they didn't have enough Faith to keep the to for those those mothers to keep the babies out of the the lion's mouth no they had enough Faith to keep standing to the very end and that's what we're looking at tonight is people that are going to stand to the very end it doesn't matter what Satan throws at them God already knows every situation so I want to be able to be so attentive to the word of God that I can Rec recogniz when it's his character oh let us let our hearts be open to recognize his character so we have been taught to recognize his presence by the character of what has occurred it's not pointing to a man I'm not looking to we can't be looking for a Ministry we're looking for the word of God because listen if we're just looking for something that is a miracle then uh then I would say there would be a lot of donkeys let's let's all follow the donkey's Ministry brother Danny because I mean that was a miracle for a donkey to talk have many's ever seen a donkey talk just giving you'all a second no hands went up well that was a pretty big deal but you see it didn't matter what what happened there I want you to understand what are we looking for all right now in this revealing in the revealing of the word of God comes Miracles and signs but without character this will bring error now I like it what brother brandom says in identification he said would you be with the popular folks who had the popular opinion as long as I belong to a church and and maybe because I danced in the spirit I'm all right maybe because I've spoken with tongues I'm all right or or maybe well we got a good pastor and I'm all right now those things are loyal I have nothing to say against that that's true but this Plan of Salvation is an individual affair with you speak speaking in tongues is a gift of God I'm not getting rid of that that's part of it dancing in the spirit is the presence and glory of God it's a part of it but for you to let your character be molded into the image of God that's a hard prayer to ask because he went through a lot of things notice I'm going to say it again but for you to let your character be molded into the image of God that he projects himself and you oh my you are his Idol walking on the earth the expressed image of him oh my now if that doesn't humble you then you're looking at it wrong to know what I've come from to know what I was to know what I've done to know my faults and my mistakes but I'm so glad he didn't see that that wasn't who I was I like the song he looked beyond my fault and he seen my need he recognized that that there was more listen I have to recognize that there's more than what I see because I hold myself back come on point it at yourself you hold yourself back from what God can do for you oh my then he projects himself oh I love that the expressed image of him now would you be willing to do that in the days of Noah or would you have been on the critical side criticizing both the prophet and his God sent message now think of it which side would you think in in notice in your present State now would you took now be honest that's what he says what would you have taken well you say well of course I I be I would be with him I absolutely well let's go back for a moment and let's just really look at the fanaticism of his message message because we know that as far well as far as We Know by this message there was never any rain so he's speaking of something brother that had not been existent by science so there was no sitting across a conver a table and conversating about rain right you ever tried to sit across the table and talk about this message to someone hello listen it's even hard where you can sit across the table with Believers hello I mean could you imagine the conversation now he was deemed brother McGary as a crazy guy I I'm sorry to put you in that but he was deemed as a crazy guy somebody who is can I just say off his rocker I mean here he is speaking of something and he's building a boat I don't think he was by any great oceans brother Danny I don't think he was by any Great Lakes now we're building a boat in the middle of nowhere expecting rain that we've never seen before in fact it's not even in the dictionary now be honest you see if we're not careful it's easy to get to play the message but yet get so close to the world that we're not questioned about the message think about it we get so close because we you know I I know your sisters you're thinking well not us you can do it too you're not the only ones that wear dresses right I understand it's it's few and far between maybe I'll just speak to us Brothers if we're not careful our life our actions our attitude is not lived in a manner to where we're question about what it is we believe what keeps holding you why are you still serving God why do you still show up to church on Wednesday night when you know you got to go to work the next day why do you still do this when everything falls apart when this one's this thing is happening this thing is happening I don't know why I'm doing it but I know that there's something what proof was there for Noah's time that rain would appear what proof do you have that the Rapture is almost here that we're fixing to be gone what proof do you have listen you cannot sit across the table and explain that proof to them we need to stop trying we need to live this word we need to live this life keep building I I I'm using different types you're just going to have to bear with me let him fix it later keep building the boat keep building up for your family let them say what they're going to say you can't explain this message think about it eight people there was family involved ined too right family involved that missed out what if it what if it was the last day things began to turn and and and and uh uh uh the the father-in-law mother-in-law was sitting at the table and they were having a conversation I wonder I I wonder if maybe they're right about this but after all these years and maybe they made that okay we're going to we're going to try to make this we're going to do this how many people sit in the church for year after year after year after year listen it wasn't Noah that closed the door it was God that close the door and he will eventually close the door that's why we've got to make our calling and election sure now it's no it's more than just coming to church and say I'm going to try it out or sitting around the table and say well let's see what happens I don't want to see what happens because when the rain starts the fall the door was already closed what was the proof what what did did we find in a scripture where there was any Miracles performed why don't you show us a miracle Noah no all I know is that he said it sir if that's not enough for you I can't help you well I tell you what if God will just Heal Me of cancer then I'll believe no no if God will just if God will just take care of this need then I'll know no he said it and I believe it he said it then I believe it it doesn't matter what is going on we can go through this life we might go through this life in a wheelchair go through this life fighting these battles but he said he'll be with us through those things listen are you is this is it worth it it was simply a word spoken to a man deemed crazy and he wasn't the popular opinion you see if we're not careful we become so desperate to perform or to see a perform performance in instead of Simply taking God at his word because we've gotten away from the word and it's not it's lost its effect in the church now we have to perform we're moving right back into if we're not careful into uh uh and to the uh the the shuck come on that's not the bride of Christ no we're not here to perform come on perform for me show me show me something give me something something Pastor give me something preacher I I I I really want to know I'm going to preach the word and if that's not enough then you're in the wrong place you see it's not about patting people on the back to try to get come on to try to make them feel good give them the word test oh my instead of s you've got to take them what is happening it is Satan doing it he's coming in the midst he's trying to stir us all up he's trying to get our attention and focus focus on something else instead of the word of God that has been given in this hour and he's keeping the word from the people because we're putting it back into man we're putting the power back into man if we're not careful and he keeps it from your mouth because now we come looking for a man we come looking for flesh when the word of God is in our midst right now before you is the word of God and you through the baptism of the Holy Ghost have the authority to look Satan right in the eye and say get thee behind me Satan that Authority is to you now I'm not against the laying on of hands I'm not against prayer lines I've seen wonderful things happen in that but if you go through the prayer line expecting something from a man you're missing it we come together with unity of the faith knowing that our faith combined Satan cannot stand against that faith it shouldn't take a miracle simply trust the word of God what if you never seen Miracle again what if you never seen blind eyes open what if you never seen the cancer fall off would you still stand upon the word of God it's our Authority it's our promise be it unto me according to Thy word it's time to trust in our calling it's time for Ministries to trust in their calling the Ministries are not the same We Don't Preach the same but we preach the same word of God I'm not here to preach like brother McGary or brother brother Danny or brother Ben wall I'm not here to preach like uh uh any any of the ministers that are here I'm here to be what God's called me to be I'm not here to sing like anybody or play like anybody or act like this church or do like this church I'm here to be what God has called me to be and God has called you in this godforsaken country if you would to be a light in this surrounding of just everywhere around you is just horror you got to show me a miracle no every day you wake up that's enough Miracle every day you let me go further in that every day you wake up with a desire to hear that message is the miracle every day you wake up with a desire in your heart to pray for somebody that's a miracle I'm not saying well I I'm not going to be that that per oh dear lord I don't know if I want to get on that I don't want to be that person never mind I'm not going to get on that I felt checked okay hey you get up here and and deal with what God's trying to do no it's it's not about a show God says that sometimes your prayers don't need to be told prayer closets are not always going to be in the Forefront of Facebook prayer closets are not only going to be the Forefront of Tik Tock come on no sometimes it's quiet time by yourself and God begins to deal with you Lord I don't know what what's going wrong with this sister or this brother but I'm going to pray for this one I'm going to pray for this one and you pray for him and you move on knowing that what placed that in your heart was not the devil that was God dealing with you to pray for someone and if he plac it upon your heart it is his word in you you say the prayer and you move on knowing that it's already done hallelujah feel like preaching just a little bit tonight trust in your calling trust in your purpose TR trust in God's timing it's hard for Humanity to trust in the timing of God because we want healed and we want healed now we want the house sold now we want the car repaired now we want the coffee now popcorn now we come to church get it over with now no trust in the timing of God I love how God slows things down because sometimes things need to be slowed down some I'm talking I'm not just talking about a slow sermon I'm not just I'm talking about sometimes we just need a slow down yes sir and listen to God come back to the house of God With A open heart and a desire to say God I want something more than just an emotion tonight I want something that'll go deep down in my heart I'm a young person and I'm fighting these battles and I'm going through these difficulties and God knows and he cares about your youth but you've got to open your heart to him and trust in him recognize that Satan has something out there for you that God has something far greater and it goes beyond what you can see it goes beyond what you can feel take him at his word you have a purpose you say well I'm not a preacher you still have a purpose you have to trust in his timing how long did Abraham wait long time listen the these are scriptures that you know I'm not teaching you or preaching anything new tonight I wish I could but I I'm not going to No it's it's already been spoken as we heard today in the message and I don't want to go beyond what God gave to our Prophet we're not we're not in we're listen we're not supposed to go beyond what God has already revealed I hope you understand what I'm trying to say there you can might you might you might not understand that and maybe you can I can explain it later but notice what brother brandham says greater than Solomon is here he says it's the same old devil that put a rag over our Lord's eyes in the palace that morning covered up his eyes and they took a stick those drunken brawling soldiers and hit him on the head with it and then passed the stick one to another and said we understand that you know the secrets of the heart we understand that you're a prophet if you're a prophet prophesy and tell us who hit you we we'll believe it then you see notice what he says there see that's the same old devil God don't clown for nobody this message ain't for clowning this message ain't for proving one man this message is for vindicating the Bride of Jesus Christ for this day what what are we trying to do and when she recognizes when the church or she recognizes who she is and Satan is doing whatever he can to get your eyes off of who you can be by the word listen not by Miracles not by prophecy I'm not against those things I I believe in those things but I'm telling you we've got to get our eyes back on to Simply trusting his word be it unto me according to Thy word I might not feel it I might not see it she didn't feel that life kicking in her yet but she said be it unto me according to Thy word and he said that devil he said now said that God don't clown for nobody it's the same old devil that said come off the cross let's see you perform a miracle that devil lives today God forbid we in our message churches get to a point where we start saying why don't you perform a miracle we get beyond the word of God when we do that listen I again I'm I'm not trying to belittle Miracles but I'm just saying come back to Simply trusting his word and be in his time let's go a step further in this Jesus never used his power to defeat Satan he defeated him by the word so you can look at how he defeated Satan and you and and the way he did it you can't you have no excuse because he did not come and say well this is only for prophets and they and and this is only for evangelists and is only for pastors because you know they have to perform a certain thing that's not how he defeated them he defeated them by the word that's been placed in your hands to not perform a miracle to not listen you say well I wish I could pray like so and so God didn't call you to pray like so and so I wish I could I wish I could just do just like this one God didn't call you to be like that he called you to be who you are now speak the very Living Word of God but I tell you you cannot do it until you're born again that's right notice he says in Matthew 4:4 and I'm just going to quote this uh but he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God right now many times we have read this and we're thinking well that's it but actually he was quoting Deuteronomy 8:3 and he says and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with Mana which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man do not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth Man live so Jesus went back to the word you don't need some special signs and wonders simply go back to the word what are you waiting for everything that you have every promise that you have is laying before you today yes amen and Satan's wanting to get your eyes off of it and try to look for something you see in this hour we we were given a prophet that would be Vindicated by what the word not by the signs and wonders only but by the word god used signs and wonders brother Brandon made the statement himself I wish I'd never performed a miracle look it up he made that I wish I would have never performed a miracle God didn't call me to do that think about these things what Drew your attention the word yeah the signs and wonders are wonderful and and and I want to tell you a way to increase faith is to go to the end of that tape sometimes and and hear that being called out that increases my faith too so I'm not against that I'm for it something about the power of God being used and if you and if you uh watch uh uh 20th century Prophet or deep call it to the deep and you start and the word has gone forth and then you start seeing how God begins to use the prophet through those uh uh through those people that come through listen it encourages my heart and I and this may not affect you but for me as a little boy there was always something that that that got me more than one of the that that just literally caused me to cry and I didn't understand it was the very last brother that went up for prayer and brother brandham says you're a minister and he wanted he was saying you were praying for a Revival he say that how what does that affect you I did not know what my calling was going to be but something drew me to that every single time you're not here for this you're here you want a Revival and listen if there is any pastor we want an old-fashioned Revival in our church now you see the problem with that is is we get scared of that word because we start to identify it with movements I'm not identifying that with anybody's movement or anybody's opinion but an old-fashioned Revival to me my heart is is the word of God coming forth cutting things out of the way and when the word of God begins to come forth the Bible said when the word was spoken they were pricked in their hearts and the pricking caused a reaction the signs didn't cause a reaction the word caused a reaction and if you look at that word pricking it's not tickling look it up sometime and I know you've said the church before and you've heard and you felt some pricking but it's the word of God thank God for the pricking word thank God for the word that'll come in and it'll be direct to your need direct to your heart it doesn't matter who the minister is it doesn't matter who God is using he knows how to get directly to your need notice what he says in the pergam church age uh he says but what do we have in this our day multitudes are working signs until we have a generation of sign Seekers that know little or nothing about the word you see I I if if this is heard if somebody comes in and hears a clip of of this what I'm preaching now they're going to label brother Jeremy as not believing in Miracles sounds like somebody just listening to a portion of the message and before you know it we now have all these nuggets that are are are slanted in the way that we think they should go but you know what I I'm going to sleep good tonight knowing what I believe and it doesn't matter what any of you think I know who I am and I know what I believe now you say what did you say that for because one of my battles has always been worried about what you think so I just punched that devil in the face I don't care what you think think I care what he thinks of me Hallelujah and what he thinks of me he's not going to let me get I'm so glad Brother David that there was a prophet that said get back in line because there were going to be times that Jeremy got out of line I'm not perfect but by his grace I can still hear a voice that says get back in line stay with the word of God it shouldn't take a miracle but if I can keep my heart open to the word of God that's right our true move of the spirit of God if they see blood oil and fire they're happy it matters not what is in the word they will support any sign even unscriptural ones but God has warned us about that he said in Matthew 24 that in the last days two Spirits would be so close together that that only the very elect could tell them apart for they alone would not be deceived let me just say something that is a very profound statement because we are living there now it truly takes the discernment of the Holy Spirit the studying of the word of God not intellectually but by his heart by his heart to be able to discern those two things because listen there there's signs and wonders out there but and it looks just like what it should look like God help us to understand Satan's not coming at you with worldly things because you've already overcome them so he's going to come at at you with something that looks so close that'll draw your attention and if you are not uh if you're not the elect of God you will be deceived but that's why I'm so glad the word of God did not leave an out for the elect she will not be deceived but it should help it that that that word the prophet what he pointed us to here should keep us so uh uh stable and so sober in these times sober think about it says how can you tell the two Spirits apart just give them the word test the crazy thing about that is is that everyone says that listen everyone says that well we've got the word we've got the word you see a lot of times we say we have the word but you want to know how you have it or not is by the character here we go back again to the character of what's going on character will always prove what word you have listen give them the word test if they don't excuse me if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one and the evil one deceive the first two Brides he will try to deceive the Bride of this last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself through Creeds or just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her well you know what this church just don't suit me yeah I would say uhoh too now this is not in the message so I'm not worried about it I'm just going to preach it because I'm this doesn't happen in the message I better repent of that it's not about what suits me and you notice how God will put you in situations that don't suit you if we keep looking for situations that suit us we're doing the wrong thing because you notice listen I we if you claim to to believe a prophet that God sent us listen to what What's Happening Here I'm going to read that again just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her but God never plac signs ahead of the word signs follow the word and when Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first can you imagine that how rude I mean don't you know how difficult it is for me Brother David I need you to do something for me prophet of God said no do this first but it's all I've got do this first you imagine can you imagine being that that woman that come in and and and Jesus loving Jesus said uh it's not for the dogs you know and or you know what I'm you know how many knows what I'm talking about I want to let that sink in that's that's a pretty potent church service right there everyone coming up and he said you're this you know you're a dog well going over to the next church this church don't suit me right that's right I'm going to ask you what you he for in the first place why'd she go to him in the first place it was it was beyond her feelings there was something in her heart that was going beyond anything else and that's why we're not in this for our feelings we're not in this to make ourselves feel better we're in this to get the word of God no matter what it takes it's not about how what makes me feel good God places Us in some sticky situations but it's for our good he allows things to come up in the church for our good because if everything was peaches and cream of course this church would just explode which I'm thankful that it's exploding but you understand what I'm saying you're with me brother scratching his head over there I don't know what's happening are we doing okay brother Davey okay signs follow the word and when Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord when she did as the word said the proper sign came come to the word I'm G to say it again come to the word and then watch the miracle so brother Jeremy's not against Miracles absolutely not but it shouldn't take a miracle for me to believe the word because it's his word spoken for me through me and to me bake the cake first have faith in God only believe which means nothing Rivals it come to the word first the seed word is energized by the spirit the greatest desire in the heart of a Believer must be for the truth that should be your greatest desire is for his word in your heart beyond anything else it should be for that word notice hady Wright said that that's the truth before anything happened she was listening to what God was doing and as far as I know she hadn't seen it she heard it and that ain't nothing but the truth and her Amen to the word brought forth the greatest gift let this be a generation that takes the book I don't want to be a generation that takes a sign we cannot just be pointed to a sign we've got to that's that listen he sent us a prophet that pointed us to the word I can't remember who said it perhaps you could help me Brother David on this but I believe it was brother Perry maybe somebody who made the statement and said we didn't know what he was saying until after he was gone talking about brother Brandon we didn't know what he was saying until after he was gone why because they were focused on the signs they were focused on the Wonders they didn't hear the word that was being spoken and then when God took the prophet off the scene then they started diving into those tapes I was sitting there and I didn't hear that hello it's like it happens many times the pastor and the local body uh uh uh they're just working and they're working and they're tilling the soil and they're tilling the soil and then brother Danny steaman comes along and he preaches the same thing and somebody comes and said I've never heard that before hello thank God for the tilling but it should be the greatest desire notice what we're Revelation 10:10 you know this you're studied up in this but I just want to encourage you with this and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings this is what we need to do today is to take this word and it's going to affect us when we eat it it's going to it's going to affect our life it's not always going to suit this flesh but when we eat it and we take it we are been told to prophesy again now this word prophesy means to utter forth to declare a thing which can only be known by divine revelation so this is not something that is just coming from a church it is not something that is just coming from a religion it is not something that is just coming from a sign or a Wonder but it is coming by divine revelation the knowledge come on come stay with me we're coming to a close quickly here divine revelation of the word of God yes eat the book eat the book eat the book eat the book every day eat the book take the word take the word take the word eat it eat it you I want you to wake up in the morning say I've got to eat the book I've got to eat the book come on young people you've got to say the same thing I know you got to go to college and I know you got your jobs and I know all these things but all these things will fade away all these things will get to a point where you can't move anymore and when you get to that point where you can't move anymore have you been eating the book eat the book eat the book come on say it eat the book eat the book take it prophesy again that word's got to come forth It's got to come from you it's not just for the ministry alone but it's for the Bride of Jesus Christ to speak it again we need to get off our camels and get into the tent that's right that's a different sermon I don't know where that came from but that felt good see what are you talking about we need to get beyond all these scenes get into that place with him close the doors behind us forget about everything that's going on around us slow down time Lord I just want want to be with you I just want to be with you I don't need no signs and wonders thank thank you for the gifts that you gave me and I'm glad that he gave the gifts he did but I need more than that I need my time with you the scripture tells us that where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered together so this is not a chicken pecking meeting hello this is a gathering around the word of God it's time where we come to a unity and I'm talking about un it's hard for a church to come into Unity much less us wondering if other churches can come together we need to get our churches our own assembly to come into a Unity of the faith where we come and we push all the differences out and as our brother said uh the traditions of man and all of these things and how we perceive it should be and recognize that you're sitting next to someone that is human just like you and they may not have the understanding that you have and you may not have the understanding that they have but God placed you together for a reason God put you in this Foxhole together the Foxhole of Fort Worth Texas and whatever part of it he put you here together for a reason not to seek after signs but recognize when the word Goes Forth something's going to happen you may not see it but something is happening even now in this building and I'm not trying to spiritualize it I'm just speaking to you the word that where two or three are gathered in his name he'd be in the midst and I know that angels are encamped about around about us I don't want to I don't want you to think that I'm just trying to to uh to bring you to such a a mental spiritual aspect I want you to know it's the word of God this his word that said by his stripes I am healed I don't have to have you tell me I'm Healed his word already said it I don't have to tell you I don't have to hear you tell me that I'm saved his word says I can be saved I don't have to tell you I don't have to hear you tell me that my children can be filled with the Holy Ghost his word says it my promise I don't need a miracle for those things I just need to take them at his word somebody here tonight needs to take this word and take God at his word quit looking for some big thing to happen get back to his word and trust him he said it I believe it that settles it it's his word for me in my time he said you you might hear me preach these messages you might see the Holy Spirit discern and do great things and perform Miracles you might pray and it would never come to pass go on your reward comes at the end you know what put it up there I want them to see this for yourself the end time evangelism paragraph 213 I want you to see this for yourself this is your promise you might hear me preach this message you might see the Holy Spirit discern and do great things and perform Miracles you might pray and it would never come to pass I'm going to stop there it may never come to pass but what did he say go on go on go home tonight get up and go to work tomorrow go to church this weekend go on anyhow your reward comes at the end hello wouldn't that be better right there yes see do Jesus a service that's the end time message that's the end time that's go on anyhow I don't cancer has nothing on me heartache has nothing on me heart has nothing on me this is not my reward this is the Only Hell the brid will see Hallelujah we've got something to look forward to hallelujah oh do Jesus a service that's the end time message he had a bride God's looking for character and then after elaser found the character glory god let me have that character oh God let me have that character and the next thing that was getting ready her to go that's the same now brother the same now the end time message is not out yonder in Babylon the end time message is here don't be looking out what does Sodom have to look forward to what does Sodom have to look forward to nothing what does the bride have look forward to we have a reward that goes beyond I'm glad that God allowed our Prophet to go beyond the curtain of time I'm so glad that God allowed us to have a prophet that would see things that we would never see but what did it do it gave us a little hope it goes beyond Hollywood's harps on clouds hello it goes beyond Hollywood's idea of what heaven is it goes beyond those things it goes beyond our imagination but one day brothers and sisters we'll come together and him and I will be the same age and that won't matter we'll run a we might not run a foot race together I don't really care as long as we're there together what's it matter anyways I want to really bring this down to this what's the greatest reward anyway a moment of healing a moment of pleasure a moment of satisfaction is God with someone more who had miraculous healings than someone who was still in a wheelchair I'm bringing it bringing it home you can have great faith from both sides to see someone that is still in a wheelchair said I know my redeemer lives I'm Healed Hallelujah I'm Healed I'm Healed hallelu I'm Healed come on I don't care what's going on I'm Healed I'm Healed that's Faith it's the same faith that someone who comes up and claims the word of God and that cancer falls off their face it's the same Faith it's the same trust in the word of God God is with both sides I want you to understand we cannot belittle one or the other God is working on both sides he's holding this body together and it is only him holding it together it's not a man it's not an apostle it's not a prophet it's no one that's holding this together but it's his word that's holding it together it's not the husband holding it together or the wife holding it together but it's God that's in the home that is holding it together hold on just a little while longer don't look for a miracle take him at his word you say well I I believe that God can heal me I've been praying for years you go on anyhow and claim your healing because his word is the same yesterday today and forever when the miracle came to hady right and she was given the opportunity you know the story she was given the opportunity of money healing right what did she take what did she take not a moment listen she she was poor she could have and healing is in the word of God I'm not belittling healing but I'm telling you what matters more just this little hickey of time of your heartache campaign with eternal uh uh happiness with God I tell you this life this life is worth more than anything else hold on Brothers hold on sisters young people don't throw in the towel you youve got to stand on the faith that God has placed in your heart if everyone sitting next to you walks away if this church falls apart you stand when no one else will stand that's the miracle standing when everyone else Falls away be it unto me according to Thy word oh Hallelujah Just Close Your Eyes for a moment I don't care what it is you're going through right now whatever your battle is whatever your heartache is the darkest thing that you're going through can you say it right now with all Faith be it unto me according to Thy word blessings will happen Miracles will happen in this message but can you sit right where you're at can you stand can you say without every with every ounce of Faith inside of you I don't feel it but be it unto me according to Thy word sometimes we're always praying to get out of something instead of sometimes always praying to get out of it maybe we need to come and say God what can I get out of this what can I get out of this situation Hallelujah Lord Jesus you see these this these wonderful people here tonight some have stood some are sitting whatever it is but I've asked them Lord to think about all these things musicians can come just play something softly now we're not looking for some great sign or wonder we we know that that's going to happen because we're Believers we know that if we take you at your word great things are going to happen we know that if we take you at your word we're going to see cancer fall off we know that if we take you at your word we're going to see wonderful things but if I never see it again if I never see the blind eyes open if I never see anyone run out of a wheelchair I still Trust You Lord this goes beyond this moment Church don't you see what Satan's trying to do he's trying to get you to to to reach after something that you can grasp that you can explain he pulls you into the Trap of explanation you really cannot explain this message and the love of it you say well I don't believe that brother Jeremy well let me just go I believe the natural types of spiritual I cannot truly explain to you my love relationship with my spouse yes you see us together we hold hands but you do not understand the Dynamics you do not understand you do not understand what we've gone through and what we've been through I could not sit across and explain to you how it is but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt I love her with all of my heart and I know beyond the shadow of a doubt she loves me with all of her heart and nothing can separate that and it's the same with the message of the hour there is no way we can truly explain that love but I know beyond the shadow of a doubt by his word that he loves me more than I could ever imagine yes I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that I love him more than I could ever imagine and it's not something I can explain but all I want is to take him at his word if nothing else happens in my life if the car falls apart if the house falls apart if everything is taken from me if I end up on the streets as it were I will still hold to him cuz I know he loves me and this moment is only just a quick moment of Life there is an eternal that's waiting for you get beyond the heart feelings get rid of the bitterness get rid of all this stuff that Satan has thrown in let God come in these meetings and change you let them come in these meetings God has something for you but you've got to let go you've got to let go and say I Trust You Lord I Trust You Lord can you say that in your heart I trust you be it unto me according to thaty word and it shouldn't take a miracle to do it it should only just take his [Music] word let's stand together
