TRANSCRIPT
========================================
watch me you're playing for now all I know is your forgiveness [Music] No [Music] Oh God [Music] let's sing it as you're fried credit give me that this take aim with grace and Majesty [Music] and that's one thing for certain let's pray this morning once again our gracious Heavenly Father Lord here we are just morning in the midst of the lady you'll see an age of people that are blind miserable wretched naked and don't know it and have a claim that they have need of nothing and Lord here we sit so needy of you Nord we just have no hope outside of you nor those that are listening in watching we just ask that you would be our portion and help us father this morning that you would take rain over any difficulty Lord in that you'd make a way for us we ask your blessings now this morning on this service in Jesus precious and Holy Name we pray amen amen lord richly bless you this morning as we yes Lord richly bless you this morning and and this has certainly become a a technical age and it's I was telling someone I said it's hard to pastor an invisible congregation and it's hard to use technology when you're not a technical person so we don't know what all the outcomes of everything is but we just know that we just go forward and that's all that we can do amen it's nice we're going to have some baptisms after the service this morning and people's hearts are desiring God and so we're really looking forward to that this morning amen if we have your Bibles this morning I'd like to turn over into the book of Matthew and read a few scriptures found in the book of Matthew the fourth chapter starting with the twelfth verse and we just like to have just a little Bible study this morning to encourage us in the hour that we're in and with all of our hearts we just trust that the Word of God is our portion and we're going to be ministering this morning out of a message called there is a man here that can turn on the light amen I just felt it was timely for this situation that we're in and we'll just take a small thought from it this morning and because that's about all that we can do is when you're little your thoughts are little and but we have a god that can multiply them amen he took a little bread and a little fish and fed thousands with it so we hope that his word this morning can feed you I know you love his word so let's turn in Matthew and the twelve and we want to read this portion of Scripture and it says in Matthew the fourth chapter in the twelfth first now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving nazareth he came in dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Seacoast in the borders Zebulon and Nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying in the land of Zebulun and the land of Neath iam by the way of the sea upon jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shallow of death light sprung up and from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand father we ask you to add your blessing to the reading of the word and we may be with us this morning amen god bless you may be seated this morning amen and if if you happen to be at home and you you have your there's a man that turns on the light I'll refer to a few paragraphs here and there but the we read not realized that the first place that light was ever spoken of was in the book of Genesis in Genesis chapter 1 and three and we see the picture that is drawn here that Jesus went to the coast and and he heard that John was put into prison and that must have been the sign to him that it was time for him to start preaching the gospel because John was the forerunner and the forerunner had been taken off the scene now Jesus was going to go out and vindicate improve the things that John had said to be true so the it was time for his ministry to start and so we realized that light that he said the people sat in darkness they they sat in the shallows and swallows of death so they were in a place that in their condition they were a place in their life that they they lacked light they were in darkness and and and being in darkness we know that that left them in a condition they didn't know which way to go which way to turn they were adrift they were just adrift and they couldn't say you can't go in darkness and and so we see in Genesis that the Word of God spoke in Genesis if get said let there be light and so that's the first time that light was spoken of and we know that in the scriptures that we understand that we know what light was because it was the result of what was spoken so the light was the vindication of what was spoken so God said let there be light and then light appeared and so we knew what he meant by light so light was the vindication of what he spoke and what he and so that's the thing that that marvelous that we see that that's what he meant when he said let there be light and you know we kind of have an idea in our mind that when he said let there be light that he created the Sun but that's really not the the truth of light and so if I could read this these great things to you that God has said this is what he said in the 60th 64th paragraph of there's a man that can turn on the light now I believe that the Sun and so forth was already in existence I believe the moon as it goes that those things were already in existence so the Sun was there the stars were there but yet the earth was in darkness so if you could picture the earth being here sitting here like this and over here was the Sun and over here was the moon but yet around all the earth was a fog there it was a Miss and it lied in darkness sort of like that if you could see the very type even with these people that sat there they were in darkness they were covered with mist they were they couldn't see clearly they didn't know what really what life was all about and he goes on he says but I believe what was here that the world was going to was going to be used and therefore and it moved in and there was fog and mist all over the earth making it dark and God said let there be light and darkness faded away and that became a cloudless sky amen so we understand that when he says light it has a deeper meaning than just a light of the Sun because the Sun was already in existence and the moon was already in existence but there was no light because of the fog that that the world sat in in the mist that they sat in okay and it's so easy sometimes for us to feel that we have light amen and so we understand that there that that was God's way of doing things he always did things that way he always uses separation if God is a separator we've heard the great message preached that God's Word calls for total separation from unbelief even in the garden isn't it funny now that they talked about separation we want everybody separated which can't be within six feet of them or separate separate separate well it wouldn't it be wonderful of man separated from sin that way amen but God always calls for separation if he's ever going to use something the first thing he's got to do is he's got to separate the light from the darkness anytime that God is going to use anything he's got to separate the light from the darkness he's going to use a people or if he's going to use anything if he's going to use any people if he's going to use any individual he has to separate the light from the darkness okay and so you know even if he wants to use a man he's got to get all the untruth out of him he's got to get all the darkness out of his life he's got to get rid of all the testimony that doesn't represent him so if God's going to identify himself with something he's got to remove all the darkness out of it all the things that aren't are ungodly all the things that would their reproach because remember the light is the representation of the word a the man so that's the way it is with God it's just that that when he says something let there be light and he's going to show forth the light and so he's going to say I'm going to I'm going to manifest myself I'm going to manifest my word I'm going to show what I meant that can't be mixed with darkness and that was the trouble with lady ousia it was lukewarm it was hot it hold it was a mixture of everything so it didn't represent what God meant when he spoke his word and that's what God does he's he when he speaks his word he brings it to pass just exactly what he's folk just exactly what he meant and the interpretation of that word is light so the interpretation of the word of God the manifestation of the Word of God it now becomes light because light and word are the same thing so when he said let there be light and that light came that was the word so the light and the word is the same thing the true manifestation of the word is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh so the manifestation of what was with God was the Word of God and that was the light of men and John expressing this in in his great epistles and and his great gospel that this light that came from God and this light was a light that separated and and Jesus even spoke those words he said I haven't come to divide he said I mean to unite but I've come to I'm good people are going to be separated because light automatically separates darkness and so we understand that that if the Sun was in existence and the moon was in existence and man laid in great great darkness well so then we also realized that that the seed was already here a marecus seed well it was there now what does the light do so the seed was there and when he said let there be light he rolled back the light and this diplays to us both naturally and the spiritually because it's the it it's a type because God was showing forth himself in nature the invisible things of God are clearly seen in the visible things around us so in the plan of nature God was unrolling and revealing the way that he does things amen we can see just through the seasons and after week we can see the resurrection in the nature of winter and the SAP and the leaves and after and those things so there's many things we could see than the zodiac in the sky that the first gospel was written in the sky so God's been manifesting himself it was one of his great purposes was to manifest himself to reveal himself to to show himself but he didn't want anybody interpreting himself he didn't need me to say this is what God is this is how he is and man did that they built totem poles they built worship trees they worshiped the Sun they carved out graven images and God said no you thought shalt not have a graven image and that means a mental graven image you can create a great image in your mind you can create a God in your mind that is not a God of the and and so that is just such a very simple understanding to understand that that the word becomes light so when God speaks his word and that word is manifested now you know this is the light Afghan so God's always been separating and that's what he does so we understand that that the seed was also here the seed was here just like in your life the seed was in you it was already here the seed was there now the light had to come and shine on that seed because the life was in the seed and what it needed was light to make that seed live because nothing can live without light both naturally and spiritually Amen you can't separate botany life from the Sun and you can't separate the spiritual seed from the Word of God it will not mill it only lives by the Word of God it only lives by the light and since the light in the word are the same thing the spiritual soul has to live by the light of God's Word a man commits flesh and blood a man does cannot supply what man has need of amen heaven and earth will pass away but my light my word my life will never pass away so the seed was there and when the light began to shine on that seed it that brought to life what that seed was supposed to be so it took the light to manifest what that seed was supposed to be so the light striking the seed the life striking the light in the seed manifested that seed and when that seed became manifested that was the spoken word what God spoke and what he meant when he said let every seed and so is it with Christ may I read this to you this is in paragraph 73 and that's the way God has today his seed is already here his word the only thing it needs is light on it and and he is that light for he is the word the word and the light is the same thing amen to you and you got to understand so the word in the life is the same thing in the light is the same thing in other words the word has life in it man the life is there it is the light of the word the life in there is the light of the word amen so that the dead-letter doesn't do anything it's the life that's in the word that's the light of that word that word shows what the word meant that's what shows what Jesus spoke when he said the things that he said amen is the life that was there the life that was in the word he said he said and the germ life lays within the grain the life is what breaks forth and brings forth the life out of the grain that's the way that Christ is in the word makes the word do what it's supposed to do amen so the life of Christ on the word makes that word do what it's supposed to do amen so when the sunlight and the life of God's Word strikes a true seed believer it's going to produce in that true seed believer what that believer is supposed to do what he was created for what his purpose was what God had in his mind in the beginning what God's thought was that he expressed so when the light the word which is the light strikes the word let there be light that was the word the light came forth and so when God speaks to the believer and speaks the word that life comes to life and that believer becomes and that word becomes what it's supposed to be it does what it's supposed to do amen and so he says it makes the word do what it's supposed to do just like the life in the grain of wheat or whatever it is makes the wheat do what it's supposed to do amen in other words it becomes wheat and it's the life that's in it all life amen so we have to begin to realize that that there's got to be something that brings life life intellect won't do that it take something beyond something from the outside even the seed itself even if it had life in it it couldn't manifest itself without the Word of God without the life and the Word of God striking the seat the world was there and the light was there the Sun was there the moon was there because I said in the beginning God created heaven and earth a man I don't know how long it took before but one day he said let there be light and the light was the removing of the darkness it wasn't creating the Sun the light removes the mist it removed the fog and now allowed the seed of God to become what it was supposed to become it took a life to bring the light 8-man and so we see that this was the way God works he says so life is only by the Word of God made manifest just think of it life only caused by the Word of God made manifest if he spoke it but if it never if it never produced s-- anything and there's if life didn't come that wasn't living word you just say let there be light but so life had to come by the spoken word it had to become by the word because oh and so the life is only by the word manifested life comes only by the word of God made manifest now listen to the statement because we're wanting to give us something this morning that gives us a sure path in where we are today he says as long as it Just's is in the book like this it still can be questioned okay so as long as it lays in letter form as long as it lays in a book like this we can question what does he mean what did he say what did he meant but what is life what is wheat what is a lion what is a bear okay you know what is water what is fish what separates as long as it lays here everybody has a right to their own interpretation everyone has a right to draw any conclusion that they want to drive so as long as it just stays here then it can be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what its spoke of being so now you see the product of what he spoke to be manifested now do you know so when Jesus preached his gospel he was preaching the gospel and he said now the spirits going to come and he's going to bring you into remembrance and their words he's going to bring to life in you everything that I preached so the world will know what it was that I was speaking so the word has to be made flesh so the word was made flesh now the flesh is being made worth so the flesh is manifesting what that he preached so it could be questioned so if he meant and then that is the light on the word that's what the word said so and then when it becomes to pass that is life in light life in life amen light bringing life life light bringing life again and so that it it has to be that way and and so whenever it's the same thing he says that when life when the life that's in the word strikes the seed the seed does what it's supposed to do if so the word can strike but until that words quickened and made alive in the believer he has just as much right to go on his intellect as anything he has a right to draw his own conclusion he has a right to his own interpretation he has a right to his own understanding but when life comes and kind of manifests the promise of that word then there's no question of what God had in mind and remember you can't grow without light not only can you can't grow without light you can't go without life and it brings to mind the which mention in this message about the the story of the young girl in Carlsbad cavern and so she was she was in Carlsbad cavern and and they went up and I have been there and you go there and and I forget how many thousands of feet but if you could ever make it the Carlsbad Caverns it is a very worthwhile trip I'm sure it's shut down now because they're afraid these amoeba is going to get down in the rocks down there or something but there's no light there so nothing can grow without light and so this we I thought about walking down and then it it's a long walk and I thought praise God there's elevators so we went in and we got our little ticket and we went down and and they do that when you get down at the bottom they turn off the light if I'm talking about darkness beyond comprehension I mean if there's no light anywhere you just can't go you don't know where to turn you don't know where the door is I mean you can start feeling your way but if you've never been there before you don't even know what you're feeling you have no orientation and amen and so you've got to have something that you draw an orientation of something that you have a relative point somewhere that you can have a reference but with no reference whatsoever you are just stumbling in the dark amen that's why God put a North Star out there and once they discovered that North Star they knew how to navigate and a spiritual person navigates by the North Star of God's Word he has the Word of God he knows that he knows by what his reference point is he knows which direction to go in and so he was there and and she started screaming out because she couldn't see she couldn't see her mama she couldn't see her daddy she couldn't see anything she was left with herself she knew she was there but she knew she was in darkness and her little brother is the story throws cried out he said sister there is a man here that can turn on the light and I thought of the world now in its present condition they know something's happening they know something's happening I mean children have a sense that something is going on I mean people know that they may not have jobs they don't know what they're gonna do about bills life is no longer the way they knew it they can't leave the house someone brought me an article that said that the most booming business at this present time is divorce attorneys I don't know why but I guess people aren't used to being with one another you know they're not used to being their home with the kids they're not used to not going to their office and having a place of escape in other words it's bringing people to places of thinking of things and considering things that they've never considered before and in other words their present-day reality has they found out it wasn't real it was a world that they had made up in their own minds a world that they were living a comfort zone that they were living in but the reality was not the depth of reality wasn't there I thought of poor sister Gayle Singh you know her sister passed away the other day from this virus she lived in New York but all her other sisters her nieces or nephews all whole families are stricken in other words like they've never had to deal with things like this before so they know that something is happening but they don't know what is happening what is happening append so it puts us in a place where they don't know where to go okay what's the next step how can I plan my future what are the things that that need to I need to do at the end so though those are questions that start this world and I thought of children are known that that's why they're wanting to be baptized they want to be right with God there's something that's in a child that knows that life has something to do with the supernatural they haven't been perverted yet by all the things of the world they still have that innocence about them that they realized hey there's got to be somebody in charge here and that's where everybody's at who's in charge who's in charge of this I know who's in charge and he the boy smoked out and said little sister there's a man here who can turn on the light I know what does light do there's a man here who can separate us from this darkness there's a man who can turn on the light and separate the darkness from the light there's a man here engineer here the one who planned this the one who put it into motion the one who developed it here's a man here that can shed light just like the man working on the carburetor the fellow was having trouble he said if you build this in two times this and five times that you do this than that and everything in room brrroom it run the guy turned around and said who are you a man he said I'm a man that can turn on the light I'm the engineer I made the thing I know what it was supposed to do and when he shed the light on it it did what it was supposed to do and when God gets in his word and the spirit gets in God's Word the word does what is supposed to do it'll never fail helped it'll never fail so he sends he always sends light because he separates light from darkness there's a man here that can separate the light from darkness there's a man here that can separate the word truth from deception so what is light light is the word manifested so when a promise is made in God's Word God said let there be in the last days the spirit of Elijah let there be Malachi 4:5 Luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 when he spoke those things and those the words that were spoken manifested then the manifestation of that word became life it became light and that light has a purpose if the purpose is to separate it just separate is to provide a manifestation so the thing can do what it's supposed to do and so what it was the light the manifest light so when the word is manifested and it becomes into manifestation or interpreted existence and all of a sudden you see what he spoke this is what he spoke here it is in flesh now that becomes light and light separates word truth from deception it separates life from death it separates kernel from spiritual it separates eternal from temporal and that's the problem with the lady OCA age it's caught up in the temporal it's got to believe that carnal blessings is a sign that God's with you it's a they begin to judge things by the flesh gods forests because we have a bigger building well look at those great big empty big buildings they've got I mean if God is not in buildings God is in his word God is in the life of his word that can manifest itself and bring something to do what it's supposed to do and if something's not doing what it's supposed to do it is in rebellion and that was God's complaint against Israel they were a rebellious nation they never kept his Commandments they never did what they were supposed to do they kept going after the world the things of the world the ways of the world and they kept trying to mix God's light with darkness God will spilled that out of his mouth that was the light so there was a man that came in our day and he had the light of the word of God because he was the word of God manifested and the word of God manifested brings light and light brings life and the word was to manifest would bring light to the true seed believer and that would produce a life in him what he was supposed to be he's to separate just like Satan told Eve Oh surely you won't die yeah you're gonna die because the word said the day you eat thereof is the day you die guess what she ate she died her death was the manifestation that the Word was truth no matter how she explained it no matter how she thought about it what was spoken was truth and when that was brought to the line of the test the word manifested that that was the light the day you eat thereof is the day you die I remember it being told to me by people who were there when brother brems spoke of I believe it was Dimas shift Aryans daughter or granddaughter I'm not remembered exactly the story but when that was spoken and prophesied hundreds and hundreds of people began to prophesy oh no she won't God will raise her up the Lord will be mighty you you are a servant of God God would never let this and on and on and on and on and on and on they went there was one problem it was thus saith the Lord and she passed away just when God wanted her to pass away just when God wanted to take her home we don't control God our lives should be where God controls us we shouldn't we believe we shouldn't be there where we're drawing our own conclusions trying to build our own futures trying to figure out the way that this is going to go or the way it should go or saying well this is what they should do hello everybody this is what they should do you know well I don't want what man wants to do I don't know what God wants to do what is God have in mind where where can I find where can I find my answer well there's a man here who can turn on the light okay and so why would man or why would we not accept the provided light it shall be light in the evening time the path to glory you shall surely find that in other words this light was a light unto our path because you can't go without the light you can't make decisions in darkness that's why people are deceived I had a few cracks in my house I would blame it on the Builder but I was the Builder so I blamed it on the earth so I hired a few fellas to come out and give me an estimate well I didn't hire him they offered to give me a free estimate and I said sure come out you know let me find out what I've got going and they measured the house and they take a bubble and they measure and they draw a great big platform out and I had three guys and and their measurements were all within a half of inch of one another once guys solution was ten to twelve thousand the next guy solution was was seven to some thousand the other guys solution was five thousand to three thousand dollar well I just happened to have a good friend he's a Muslim gentleman he's become a good friend of mine he's the number one soil engineer in Dallas Fort Worth worked for the government just he's a soil engineer I brought all the drawings over there sat him down the first thing I didn't say anything he said none of these guys charged you for this did they and I said no he says because all they're in the business of doing is putting in piers he says they don't do anything for your foundation and he went on to explain me about the earth and how it moves and how old my house was and that not nothing that they had to do was been did to do anything and I got the truth and the deception of it was is that they don't have any control over it and one of those fellows and I'll give him credit he was a Seventh day Adventist and it didn't take long he noticed Leslie and we started talking about prophecy and the word of the Lord and his take on things and we had fellowship and he finally looked at me he says you know you really don't have a foundation problem I thought or bless that guy he was the cheapest guy he said depends on how fanatical you want to get and I went there and and and Sam told me exactly the same thing now I have somebody that shines light on it and this fella knew that I had this engineer because I told them so when the light beep in the sign the truth begin to come out because that's what light does it separates the Word of God is more powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword separating the marrow in the bone if it discerns the thought in the intent of the heart so the Word of God discerns if the intent of the heart is really to follow the word and become the word not just use the word but to have that light that word become a guiding light in their life okay so why would I go ahead and go to the most expensive guy let them drill holes on my floor take up my brand new carpet do everything he does give him $15,000 when it wasn't going to do one thing for me I thought this guy is like a denomination his motive and objective his work is motive and objective is money at key and there is absolutely no guarantee he said well we'll test your plumbing for leaks how much is that four hundred and fifty dollars go down to Home Depot buy a fifteen dollar screw on valve you screw it on your hose bid you turn on the water if you watch the pressure go up and you watch it for ten minutes fifteen minutes sometimes they leave it overnight and they come back and if the pressure doesn't go down you don't have a leak 400 bucks I told I'll tell you what you let me go do all your test leaks I'll give you 150 you don't even have to do it and I'll check them all be if your house leaks they don't guarantee to fix it it's a gimmick it's a deception why would people reject true light why would we not accept a provided light that was going to bring us into truth was going to separate us from deception was going to separate the carnal in the spiritual was going to separate the temporal from the eternal separate life from darkness why would we it's not accept that and it's a beautiful thing because people live in the glare of another age it's a false light that could deceive some a false Claire a false light that's quite Satan appears as an angel of what light because the only thing that will deceive is a false light the Great Train Robbery was false lights they set up a light stopped the train they deceived them so it's a it's a false light it's a glare that we're talking about why people would reject the Word of God that came and was vindicated and proved to be the promised word that was promised it was spoken it was manifested here's the angel here's the prophet of Malachi four or five here's the angel of revelations ten seven revealing the mysteries discerning the thoughts intents of the heart manifesting the Ministry of the Son of Man here's the scripture what he promised to do I promise you lady I'll see you I promise you Gentiles I will not leave you in the deception but I will send your life it shall be life the path the glory you shall find but why would they reject it because of a glare of a false light the glare of another age now when this we've been to start this trouble I've received many songs many testimonies many phone calls from people and friends telling me of all the things that God does and this is what we do we tell how good he is God's good we tell how loving he is we tell how kind he is we tell of all the wonderful things he has done for us little testimonies people helping one another people praying for things and and God bring it to him God's sending people by all these marvelous wonderful things that God's doing he healed us he delivered us he provided for us and all of it is true every bit of it is true because that's his side of it you understand that's what he promised to do he's keeping his word that's his side of it but the very fact that he's good the very fact that he shows his rain the rain on the just and the unjust the even fact that he provides for the fatherless and Gannon and for the widow and their fliction even though he feeds the poor and he feeds the hungry and he does all those things he does everything he promised he would do they see his side of it and don't they understand that that's becoming their judgment I kept my word to you I provided for you I healed you I delivered you he did it to Israel over and over and over again and every time they would go away he'd come right back but there was a day that they rejected him for the last time and so we seek that his side of it he said I'll provide the light I'll provide the Sun but if you turn it down and you reject it and there's the fact that someone sits there with their hands raised in the air and they're feeling the blessings of God and the Shekinah glory is all around them it doesn't make it right that they've got bobbed hair it doesn't make it right that they've got are adorned and Gorda gold apparel and they're there they're painted faced the blessings of God does not eliminate the truth of his word if he doesn't it doesn't separate that could they get caught up in the glare of the blessings and reject the provided light that's going to separate them from the deception God really bless me so I can cut my hair no I will not deny that god bless them just like the lady that said God called me to preach I don't know about that but it's con cherry to his word heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away when you reject the light you reject the way that you have to go you're providing your own way you're taking your own judgement and the Word of God says away seemeth right unto a man but the end of that way is death he provided a light he provided a vindication he provided a manifestation so that manifestation could be light so we could walk in the light as he is in the light we walk in the revealed light of the age what are we gonna do in this time what are we gonna do in the midst of this trial what are we going to do how do we prepare follow the light stay with the light stay with the revealed way to live stay with the revealed look a Word of God you stay with the Word of God the Word of God will produce exactly what it said it would do and you will do what it said to do I've never seen the righteous big bread what are you going to do different brother McGary nothing I have the light I'm going to walk in that light there's a man here that can turn on the light it will guide us through all darkness no matter when it is or what it is the path to glory you shall surely find it doesn't matter God provided a light he provided a manifestation he he provided a revealed word the revealed word the manifested word becomes the light to our path it's the way we go doesn't matter what changes the light doesn't change the manifestation doesn't change the word doesn't change I don't care what plans they need to make what are we going to do we're going to follow the manifested revealed Word of God just as it was spoken and given to our age it will do what it's supposed to do keep us from deception keep us from death keep us from carnality keep us from temporal allottee what is designed to do it is designed to separate us from the Fellowship of the world come out from amongst in my people and be ye separate and I'll call you my sons and my daughter he is this separate us it's not for us not to get caught up into the deception and if it was given to as us a provided light okay and sure people can speak of all the glory and goodness of God and every bit of it is true but that's not the seed that's in you the seed that's in you is let every word of man be a lie and every word of God be true the seed that issue is your you're going to follow the Word of God and what are we going to do what are we going to do but keep following the Word of God the provided light the provided way because there's a message that can turn on the light there's a message that can show you and answer your questions and deal with your heart it's been proved to be true and it works over and over again so I I don't need to come up with something new I I don't need to be caught in the glare okay people that might claim or God's with us I don't care how if you sing like an angel and you're annoying it a man that's got long hairs a pervert see we don't want the reproach we don't want the things that separate us from the deception we don't want the things that makes us be separate we don't want the things that that puts our heart on heavenly things an eternal thing that's the hard part but when you see the light and you have a revelation of the manifested word of the hour when you have a revelation that this is the message that God since this is a prophet this is the fulfillment of those scriptures the cominius tree of the son of man appeared as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah as it was in the days of Noah every single one of those conditions have been met this word has been manifested it has come to pass exactly the way it's spoken and you realize that and you recognize that as being the light you will not be deceived by the glare if not you'll start running after the glare because there's no reproach in the glare it's all God's good God's good all the time he fed everyone that crucified Him he healed many of those that said away with him he brought light into their heart he bought deliverance cast out their Devils it's not even recorded in the book or the books of this earth the things and the works that were done by his hand how many mines he restored how many marriages in restoring how many lives he turned around the very presence of God walking amongst men and yet men rejected him because he claimed to be the son of God but he was the son of God and today they reject the light that God sent to provide for us and keep us from the deception of the angel of light and they get caught up in the glare of the goodness of God and I say yes God's good when someone tells me of all what God does I say yes God does that I'm not judging people it's not given me to judge it's given me to remove the beam out of my own eye before I remove the sliver it's given to me to make sure my life is lined up with the manifested word it's given to me that that word produce itself in me I'm not here to condemn but I don't want to get caught up into the glare and the justification of things that are ungodly and when the day comes many will say Lord Lord we did all these things he said depart from me I never knew you in other words my light and my life and my word never manifested in you for you to be what I planted I bless you sister but I didn't plant in this earth a bobbed hair gold ordained pants wearing miniskirt woman that presents her body that serves authority over the man doesn't take her position that's not the seed I plan it did the Sun Shine on you yes were you blessed of the Spirit yes but you rejected the light whether it would transform you into what I plan it that was the hard part the hard part is staying with it but it's what you are it's what we're going to do we're going to stay with the Word of God we're not going to compromise for food we're not going to compromise for permission to open church if they say you've got to change what you preach oh you can't we're not going to do it because this earth is going to pass away but that word is not gonna pass away so just remember this beautiful time of darkness that we're in people don't know what's happening but we know what's happening what's happening is there's a seed that's sitting in the light of the Sun and it's ripening into the image of Jesus Christ and one day it'll be harvested and rapture they say these are uncertain times we are certain of one thing and that is the resurrection and the soon catching away of the bride god bless you let's pray together our Lord Jesus if the believers father would go and [Music] take this little message and read through it they would see how important that the provided light that God sent tune again a vitreous x I will not leave you comfortless but I'll come again I'll be with you even in you behold I'll send to you Elijah the Prophet he'll return the faith of the fathers to the children in the faith of the children back to the father's in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when his message shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished unto the angel of leo sia write these things says the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God Lord may we not forget the revealed word that has been manifested in our day and the power of the word that you delivered us to transform us out of this world bless those at our home I wish I could see their face I wish I could shake their hand I wish I could give them words of comfort but all's I can say is hold on hold on to what God's revealed to you it'll get you through and your final blessing will be a crown of a righteousness in a robe of righteousness sitting with him in his throne judging heaven and earth oh lord help us I pray help me father father it's your flock send your spirit by touch each heart create within us a greater sincerity and a hunger for truth than we've ever had before may we not look to the right or look to the left but may we keep our eyes on you the word knowing that heaven and earth will pass away but you promised that nothing can pluck us out of the palm of your hand you promised us you wouldn't lose one of your sheep and you sheep hear your voice and another they won't follow father I don't mean this morning to Dee Christianize anybody I know they're sincere people that really love you Lord and I ask for you to be merciful I asked for you to give them light and truth and father that they have no place in the resurrection I ask that you provide a spot for them in the final judgement because they've tried to live for you but they couldn't grow without the light they couldn't mature without the life of the word it couldn't go any farther than they our Father without the words of life that were delivered to this age father may I never be judged as callous I know my heart's right I know I feel for the lost but father we can never compromise on your word never never change your word we are not given to change it but to follow it and we ask that we could hold true to it father just as pure as it was spoken that it can reflect in us we ask me to bless us now father as we prepare to baptize the two young Saints that want to dedicate your life father those that have to be dismissed we ask that you would touch them and bless them we ask these things in Jesus name we pray hey Leslie would you help them and Andrew where's Andrew would you help the brother Millie god bless you [Music] my heart to see my fallback my take to see my [Music] Here I am to worship Here I am to bow down Here I am to say that you're mine [Music] altogether lovely altogether [Music] altogether under 40 varies big shot the sky war no more tears - then they huh always miss forevermore all that happy golden true what are they whoa career see we'll be water thing [Music] when my Jesus I shall see cup on its face the water say [Music] takes me by the hand and leads me through the crowd has no water they will go away a snake [Music] there'll be no sorrow there [Music] no pain wha-ha leader [Music] with the law they will go away Oh [Music] my Jesus I shall see [Music] is ready everybody's right let's me [Music] the sorrows here Oh [Music] wonderful many times I have questions about you know when to when to baptize someone but I always decided in my heart to baptize them when they ask because I feel that a child has a lot better chance of fighting the wiles of the devil when they've made a commitment to the Lord then just sending them forth with nothing so this is her heart wanting to do what's right and I believe God will honor her and keep her and this will stand for her when she has to make a stand so that's always been my approach and and she becomes a part of us and we keep her in our prayer amen let us read in the book of Acts and it said in the 21st verse and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved he men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth Amanda proofed of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you all ye yourselves also know and as we read it says this scripture as we read on it says for David it is not ascended into the heavens when he said to himself the Lord said unto my lord sit down out on my right hand until I make thy foes thy footstool therefore let all the house of Israel assuredly that God who hath made the same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ and when they have heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost where the promise is unto you and to their children and to all that are afar off even as many as our Lord our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this up towards generation amen and we believe that our little sister has felt a call on her heart amen our gracious Heavenly Father you said to go into all the world and preach the gospel the gospel has been preached father and you said as many said come to you and repent to baptize them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and by divine revelation we know that
