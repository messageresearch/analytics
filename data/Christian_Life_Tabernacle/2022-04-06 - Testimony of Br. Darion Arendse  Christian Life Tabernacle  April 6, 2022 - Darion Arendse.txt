the themes of this earth will grow strange [Music] the light of his glory and grace [Music] your eyes upon jesus [Music] and the things of earth will grow [Music] is [Music] before we start this evening we want to give a little update on kayla bill and uh anyway caleb didn't know that he had to watch his sugar and his sugar got out of balance and it got really high and when that happens to you it puts you to sleep so he wasn't in a coma like an accident coma or a brain damaged coma but he was in what they refer to as a diabetic coma so he'll be fine he just needs to uh realize that he can't eat all the cakes and cookies and drink all the cokes and eat all the pizzas that he used to but he'll be fine in their they're getting him back uh to normal his system got out of balance they're giving him electrolytes and there gave him some insulin to bring his blood sugar down and he'll be fine in just a couple days so we're grateful for that so we understand that this evening you know many times we talk about him about the lord what he can do and what he promised to do but a lot of times we don't go on and follow up about what he has done and the promises he has kept and so this evening brother darion is going to share with us tonight all that the lord promised all what god's done in his life and and he has a tremendous testimony of his journey he's here tonight by the grace of god he was on his deathbed but god intervened so i'm not going to take a lot of time i'm going to go out there and sit with you or i can look at him and take notes of his nervousness and any mistakes he makes so we can tease them later darian has such a lovely spirit that that we all we get we tease him all the time you know his his spirit is so nice and so warm and friendly that he went out in the parking lot one service and interviewed and talked to a guy and invited him into church and the guy was out there stealing purses out of the cars but so that's just kind of the attitude that he has and and we love him he to me he's a gift from god to help me personally and our body he's got wonderful support so i'd like to introduce him at this time verdarian yeah this is our good-hearted d right here now he gets accolades that jackson doesn't get because jackson's got to sit everybody down and move people darren just he's he's kind of like a walmart greeter you know you're not gonna you're not gonna hear anything bad from him you're just gonna hear good things he makes you feel good and no even if you do something wrong he'll make you feel good you know so we love him and we're just gonna turn the service over to him now and and uh we're going to calm reverend for a couple months just to get them but we're all ministers of the gospel of christ amen and and he's he's surely proved himself to me and to you so brother darien if you want to sing a special before you can the musicians are here if not then we'll just let you go forward have the lord lead you

can stand here before you forgive me if i'm going too fast to the interpreters i know i'm not brother matthew when i saw brother matthew the other day oh okay i guess i have to wear this thing thank you pastor i appreciate that thank you brother gary appreciate it amen let's just give brother gary a hand because he has to be with us every every minister i just appreciate that all the services of the brothers and sisters um but anyway as i was saying this is just a testimony of god's grace and his goodness and his mercy toward me and my family and i'm sure you all can have that same or have a testimony similar to that i just want to be like um as you know brother branham i love that story where he says that we in the boat and the one said peter was jumped up can i say something can i say something wait wait can i say something well tonight i want to say something for the lord amen you know appreciate everyone that's here those that are live streaming it is good to be in the house of the lord he promised me two or three are gathered in his name they will be in the midst and i believe and i'm sure you all do as we've heard our pastor so many times god cannot lie he's he's he's not a man that he should lie and we're grateful that we can stand here and just worship him and glorify him in this moment you know it's uh amazing how i just enjoy listening to some of the ministers and that we have in our local fellowship and and the little things that they have that just it excites me when i hear them preach because brother david told me one time when you get so excited just rather raise your hand than jumping up and so i'll just raise my hand when you see me raise my hand i'm excited so praise the lord anyhow hallelujah amen so um anyway um i was about oh nine years old when i just my dad and a good friend of my dad at the age of 16 they were doing missions work with a another minister back then this guy dressed exactly like brother branham i told a few brothers this and uh white jacket pants and the sucker trousers and the hat the white hat and he had a gift that was undeniably god working in human flesh it was about the same time as brother bran was on the on the scene um his name was cecil gilbert but my dad always came home with these stories about how god would work the miraculous in these tent meetings that they would have up north in northern south africa and you know where um the blind would see the deaf would hear and the the squinted eyes would come straight and he said even knees would pop and legs would grow limbs would grow and hands would grow feet would grow and you're sitting there as a nine year old i'm thinking man i wish i can talk to that guy that's able to do that you know why i don't know at the time and i always i was fascinated me and my brother we were just fascinated by it and as we grew up you know we started seeing how god worked and and different things in our lives so this is just the for uh part of the the house that we're building tonight just to get to the end of where i'm going and um at the age of 14 i had my personal experience with the lord jesus christ where he brought me i remember it was a small little group of the the fellowship with brother beckett was just maybe 50 people at the time the church was still growing and i was called well the lord brought me up i don't know how i got to the to the front or to the pulpit and we prayed and and um from that day on i was a changed person from the inside out now the flesh man was still fighting because the flesh man was still an athlete the flesh man was still very smart the flesh man was still handsome had hair [Laughter] so the flesh man was definitely at war with a spirit man but god knew how to beat that out of me over time and in his best way and the way that he wanted me to grow and i remember being at school after my experience with the lord and this is i'm going to high school now and uh talking to friends and just sharing the gospel with them and how can you not see that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that there's only one baptism in jesus christ's name that you cannot baptize in the name of the father and son of god and the holy ghost i sat with my uncle it was a pentecost and i showed him i had a bottle of coke and i poured it into three glasses i said the same coke this is how jesus oh he got so upset how can you make our god a bottle of coke but the carnal man was trying to express something that he could i loved him so much i wanted him to see it but yet he didn't see it you know and he passed away um knowing the lord jesus christ but was never baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but that's okay i know i'll see him on the other side by god's grace and i'm sure there's many of you that have gone that same path or seen the same things but anyway as i grew up the lord took things away from me and slowly but surely as i matured in the wood and as i studied the word and laid in the presence of the sun more of the word opened up to me the seals were opened up and i just started looking at things from a different perspective you know my original plan back then was to be a cardiologist and i had the grades and made it in the in the top 10 percent of my graduating class from high school everything was fine and i walked away from a career in soccer and scholarships and all that and then i came here to the united states my dad they might come here we immigrated well it was a vacation at the time during south africa it was still on the apartheid so we couldn't we weren't allowed to leave the country as immigrants we could go on vacation so we came on a vacation and um we stayed that was back in connecticut you know and uh yeah well enjoy that one because that was the best part of it that the other stuff is still coming and um as the years went on we started a few businesses out there and and things went well and um i wasn't sick everything was fine i was strong i was work i was doing roofing um i was doing we had a limousine company we had a horticultural business so i was busy i was able to do all the manual labor so with the church building coming up that we're going to start real soon we trust the lord i will be putting my shoulder to the wheel i'm sure many of you will as well because there's a vision and that vision will become reality real soon we believe that and so with all that we were i was in the mindset of well we're making all this money the church is growing because the church was growing we went to about 70 80 80 people um it started to grow in connecticut and my dad was the pastor there and we would do outreach and things like that and people would just start coming in but the reason why the people came in was not so much because of the word it was more because of they were attracted to these two young boys under the age of 30 being so successful in businesses different businesses and just doing well so that was the attraction that brought them in um there's still a church there i believe brother what's the brother's name now i forget his name my brother lamb greg i forget brother jackson told me what his name was but anyway i think yes brother brewer i believe he might be up there at that little fellowship there now but um that was started but then the lord in 96 took all of that away from us you go from a a company and a business that was a very very well-off we would walk into ford and just point to the vehicles that we wanted and walk out they would deliver it nothing signed everything was done that's how strong of a business report we had but that was not god's plan for the fellowship and when he took that away it brought us back down to who we truly were sons and daughters born again called for a higher calling a purpose not for the flesh and the entertainment of this flesh but for the souls of sons and daughters of god and then we moved to ohio and during that time you all know about my wonderful wife my queen and yeah i won't go into that sister kelly might enjoy that too much but you know so we moved to ohio and the boys are born joshua and daniel and at the time i did not have my green card i didn't have any legal paperwork i just had employment authorization so i didn't have a stitch of paperwork to say that i should stay here and my attorney then his name was brian defranco i'm very good friends with him now he advised us in 2005 that we should go back to south africa now if you've never been in a situation like that let me just explain to you with ice and the ins and it's it's very real it's uh it's constantly on your mind as a provider as a husband as a dad and you have to do things that you're sometimes not very proud of but that you have to provide for your family and that gets you through body god never failed to provide in our needs during all of that time amen he was the same steli is the same yesterday today and forever and um we we went back to south africa but before we went back alana's mom sister lavona she passed away from kansa lana got there a few days too late but by god's grace she was able to go and then later that year i went this is in 2005 so now that you know that part of a little bit of my life now comes the other part so in south africa we went to the embassy there and tried to come back to the united states we didn't have our girls our beautiful wonderful little girls didn't have them yet we just had the boys and um so we went to the ambassador there and uh we started the morning real early we got there around seven when they just opened we sat there the whole day until they closed we were there first we sat there it was just me and my wife and the ambassador came out and she said there is no way that i will allow you to go back to the united states ever in your life my wife looked at me if you if you if your wife has ever looked at you with that look of loss then you know what i'm talking about she looked at me and she said what are we going to do well i'm the man i should have the answer i i don't know i have to trust the lord and you know we'll see what happens from there because the man part was still fighting the man said we can go to canada we know some believers up there we know brother briscoe uh my dad at least knows brother biscuit and some believers up there and um or we could go to mexico and then go from there but that definitely was not the plan that god had in store for us so let me get you into this part of my life in 2006 in cape town south africa while we were on a mini getaway with some of our friends of ours i started feeling cold and shivering like someone in a very severe anaphylactic shock if you don't know what it is you're just shaking like it's nobody's business and you are super cold i had about five or six pairs of socks on extra pairs of layers of pants and jackets and blankets and a fire going i could not get rid of this shiver and the cold and my wife looked at me and she noticed that my eyes and my skin looked very yellow well i thought wow it's just something i ate you know because we were on the coastline we went fishing a few days before that i ate some um mussels and scallops right off the rock so i could just pick it up and peel it out and eat it just like that so i love the ocean i really really love it i i just there's just something about it that calms me when i sit there and just listen to the waves going back and forth and yeah but that was my south diagnosis then we went i went to the doctor that monday and that's when the doctor gave me a diagnosis after a long day of blood work and they basically told me that i had five months left to live so now you're sitting there you can't go back to the u.s your wife is concerned because you're not healthy you have your two boys you have to take care of and it's just it seems like an impossible task so that reminds me of the scripture where daniel went into the lion's den he didn't stand at the corner of the lion's den or the front of the side of the he was in it and god only then came on the scene the boys in the fiery furnace the same deal the fire consumed those that even stood close to the fire didn't touch them god was already on the scene i didn't know that god was already on the scene i thought well i'm probably going to make not make it told my dad i called my cousin he said you're a doctor said hey this is my diagnosis he was like what brother david met him his name is alan and he said we got to get you stateside man we got to hit you i said how how well we prayed my father-in-law brother earl prayed and my dad then prayed on this side in the congregation and um my liver at the time was swollen about four times the normal size of a liver so if you see a liver it's about about a big sits on the side you have your the right side it just it's basically the the junkyard processor cleans everything out that you eaten and stuff and um four times outside so that thing was standing out like that there's basically nothing that they could do but put me on a very strict um severe diet now you brother brown talks about the a shadow of a chicken starved to death i cannot i can testify to that i was on a diet like that it was broth beef broth chicken broth toast no butter tuna no sauces no salt no pepper um that was my diet boiled eggs now and then not too much because it gives too much gas and yeah it was i think it was for three or four months was it longer than that lana six months i don't even remember i just knew i wanted to get out of that because hey i love to eat and i love to eat good food and that thing was oh that was rough that was really really rough and you know and it was just by god's grace that i couldn't walk from i would sit on in my father-in-law's old house he sold that house now you sat in the sofa year when you came through the front door you sat in the sofa and there was the kitchen was just a few feet away i couldn't stand up and walk by myself from that sofa to that door that piano from this pooper to that i could not walk by myself my precious wife there had to carry me and for brothers that's looking for a real genuine born again wife trust in the lord pray pray pray he'll give you the desire of your heart because he definitely gave me my desire of my heart because my wife was beyond special pick me up put me into bed pray with me she'd wash my feet you know just take care of me like a real wonderful born-again christian but also a wife a mom and yeah that was that was a very very rough time you know you you think about life and things come into real perspective real fast it's not so much about the businesses that you own the cause that you had the money that you had it's more about just can i take my next breath can i live to see another day will i be able to sleep tonight will i be able to move in the morning when i wake up then it becomes real and then the fact of the matter is where is god in all of this because you're now in the you're having your juniper tree experience as is your moment where the enemy is just pounding you day and night you don't see results of getting better you don't feel the results of getting better but yet you know he promised he promised that he'll never leave you nor forsake you he promised that he's the same yesterday today and forever and that for me is always been what carried me through when i look back to that age when i was 14 years old when that reality struck me when jesus christ came my way it changed my projection my life it was just it was just amazing it still is to this day that is what's carrying me every single day of my life so anyway long story short the ambassador that told us that we would never ever be able to come back to the united states again wrote a letter with her hand and signed it with her hand supporting my wife and myself to come back to the united states in 2007 so now you can start seeing the hand of god working and now you're not sure well i'm going back to the united states what for lord i'm a dying man what am i coming back to this united states for so in 2007 went back and then we moved from connecticut to ohio in 2009 so when i had my first medical emergency knowledge god said he'll heal you and it's never in your time it's never in the way you expect it never in the way you want it but it's in his way he's time and the way he wants to do it to show his glory you know and um 2009 is when they gave me my actual diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis i know there's many nurses in here so they know what this is about and stage four cirrhosis of the liver so i was in pretty bad shape even though my outward appearance didn't look like it i thought my wife was going to give me that picture of myself when i was a back in 06 when i was so skinny then some of the brothers would have understood but i said i was skinny hard to believe i i agree if you want to laugh that's okay go ahead and chuckle because this fat boy was skinny at one point anyway so um there's autoimmune disease where your body just attacks its own but well my autoimmune system attacks my body instead of fighting off the virus it just attacked my liver the doctors tried to find out why they did a lot of research at ohio state university and different places to figure out what it was some said it could have been something i ate that was contaminated some thought it was something i drank but nothing really stood out we did some research and it's like one in 12 14 million people get this technician some say it's hereditary no one in my family has it so how did i get it but they said nothing could be done except for a transplant and that's the organ that's affected which is the liver and me being the only one that had this disease it was to me knowing that i never drank a stitch in my life i had maybe i had my grandpa was an alcoholic on my mom's side and he um he gave a little shot glass when we were about seven or eight years old said to all the grandkids try this i could not stand that stuff i said never will i touch that stuff and that was the only time i had something like that and um never smoked he kept me from that he kept me from that because i certainly had friends that did all of that stuff and um since 2009 the doctors just was just starting to do exams and preps for surgery i was on various types of medications to help my system to just calm down get the jaundice under control the yellowness under control um and in 2009 2011 i i was i had almost died when that uh done the procedure uh colonoscopy normally causes that side effect and i had a severe fever and i had to be rushed back to the hospital with that somehow that cut my esophagus which is your third year and the toxins in my body the bile or the the the the filth got into my system and there was supposed to be cleanse my my liver that came into my system and i started to just yeah got into my bloodstream and that was a very severe reaction almost like something that you had but um yeah it's along that lines just to make it a little easier to understand you know so then that was 2011. so during that time we were planning on buying a home in ohio we weren't planning on moving there was uh my dad had started a fellowship there and um we were doing good everything was going fine and then i got sick so i had to be in the hospital in and out of the hospital every three four months i'd be so obviously that started draining on our resources finances and stuff like that savings eventually was depleted and then the lord said to my wife and myself you i want you to move you couldn't have told me that last year lord when i had money now you want me to move um so we were planning i again the flesh man said we can go back to new york i know some friends i know buddies i can start up a business i can start a company and we'll be fine that didn't settle well with me because i've learned one thing for sure watch the hand of god look to him and he'll direct your path that's what his word declares so i've he's taught me well to look to him because i don't want to make the same mistakes you learn you learn fast at school of god's hard knocks knocks you straight up and then we thought well maybe georgia maybe tennessee could have gone to a few other believers fellowships and then my work decided to send me here to texas um to houston for some um uh continued training and education at a facility out there and my my wife's sister came in a friend of ours and so we all got in the van and the work my company then paid for everything they paid for the hotel the fuel anything i would have expenses they they covered it all i watched the hand of god they paid for everything even if i called them and said while i paid this i didn't want them to pay for everything they insisted so we went to houston and we stayed at the hotel and then my aunt lives here in hearst and i told my wife i said you know we've been praying about coming this way and when we entered the borders of texas my wife and myself just looked at each other at the same time and we both at that same time felt a peace come over us so knowing that the lord had said move we weren't sure where but we had thoughts and when we came here that peace his peace overtook us and we thought okay well this is where he wants us to be maybe it's in houston so we uh tried to find out from voice of god if there were any churches in houston or fellowships and they didn't come back um it was just no responses and then my wife came to visit my auntie and hearst and she called me she said darren remember that feeling you had when we entered in and i had the same feeling i said yeah she said well i just had the same feeling you're in hearst i said well that's strange okay well find it if there's a fellowship around here and again we reached out to voice of god and they said there's quite a few churches and understandably they couldn't point you in a specific church direction because then it would look like brother they said you must go there and that's where you'll stay you've got to follow the leadership of the holy spirit at all times and we didn't know about the church here we didn't know about the fellowship here never met brother david never heard about brother david before and um yeah so when i came here to visit my aunt my wife was still here that same piece over kb so now we knew okay he wants us in texas somewhere in the area of dallas where exactly we're not sure yet so we went back up to ohio and in 2015 i got really really sick and my liver started failing you know you open up a shower and and you put a cloth there and the water just comes right on through that's how my liver was everything i'd eat or drink would just go right on through nothing got cleansed nothing got processed right so it was just a serve just letting everything go through right through so and in 2015 when i got sick my family had the flu at the same time i thought i had the flu so it was around 2 am my wife looked at me and she said i looked pale i was sitting in the bath in the bathroom on the edge of the bath and they're hunched over usually when i sit like that i'm in a lot of pain but i was hot and i didn't know how to cool down and you know with the with the liver or or some of the organs inside on the inside of your body you put your feet in the ice cold tub of ice or water and those things just seem to somehow just shrink the organs shrinks slowly but it shrinks over time and my wife asked me at the time should i should you call on 911. i said okay go ahead so in 2014 let me go back there again we had eventually moved down here we still haven't come to the fellowship here we didn't know about the church we'd gone to brother david is going to get me for this one again we went to a little baptist church here in collierville first baptist church over there and we had communion there and i took the communion and i just shook my head i told my office i said i can't do this anymore we've got to find where god wants us to be because this is not working because they're taking the body and blood of jesus christ without knowing what he really is about and um anyway so coming back to where my wife called the 911 we we eventually went to the medical city um hospital year in just not too far from here um you can see it off the highway so while i was laying there someone in the next room or the next bed at least because you're now sitting in the er they were trying to revive this person well that person had passed away while they were trying to revive him and myself and my wife just looked at each other and we both thought well that's the right place to come because they shouldn't they striking out the air man there's one gun in our mind next so my cousin came over and he's the er doc alvin and he said let's go over to baylor in grapevine he knew some people there and got me in real quick and told them what happened you know god has a purpose in everything and sister allen oh she's not here tonight she worked there i didn't know that but god has a purpose in everything we wanted to get to the fellowship hall didn't know where it was so um my wife called her dad to find out if he knew about a place of fellowship that we can go here in dallas and he said no he's never been to texas but he knows someone that knows dallas real well and brother brown's son-in-law brother george smith was at his house having lunch and he told us about brother david and the fellowship year so you can imagine our surprise it wasn't too far not even 10 minutes away we never knew but that's how god works small things that he moves in his time and uh i've never spoken to brother david at all the first service i remember having come here to was um ice met with brother matt brother matthew yeah matthew brother matt thomas i got you in the little green little porch you remember that matt you remember that and matthew was still teasing me said i said well i'm i was on my way to brother um isaac noriegas that's where i wanted to go and matthew still said why do you want to go down there this is where the world is at so you know god works he works he might he's kept that in my thought with my thought process my memory since that time for a purpose you know and um my wife eventually called brother david and spoke to him and um she of course had to first explain who we were then brother david remembers all that but you within yourself know that you have nothing you just saved by god's grace your dust of the earth and he makes these ways possible and then you know my wife spoke to brother david and and if you wonder why i'm so appreciative brother david you'll hear about it in a few minutes just give me a few minutes to calm down and settle down but david doesn't like this but it's my turn now that evening david was at the hospital never met him before normally a pastor of a church this size would send one of his deacons or someone to just go and find out who they were or just go pray with them and that's it but he came himself so i appreciate that brother david very much so that's when he also met my cousin there at the hospital sound he found out the severity of my condition i don't recall everything that happened that day as you can tell i mean this here these things my wife put together she has an excellent memory i had a memory in that long long gone you know my esophagus which is your throat pipe or the pipe that's down here from your throat down i perforated and i started bleeding top and bottom they couldn't understand what was going on and i had to perform the emergency surgery i coded and coding means you had passed away some of the nurses know what that is you just flatline and now my cousin at the time we were both getting ready to go to to to take the mcat to get into med school and he doesn't get he doesn't get shaken by much because we've seen a lot while we grew up in south africa and i saw his eyes go real real huge he was sitting across from me i knew i was in trouble because alvin never gives away what he's feeling and this time he couldn't hide it and he told me my wife to contact my sister and my brother and family to to come when i saw the look on my wife's face the concern she had i was like oh boy i'm in trouble again and all of through all of that we still had our four kids we had the girls now and the boys were taking care of the girls which i really appreciate you know i never said i can't say thank you enough to them for what they've done within our family for my wife for what she's done and now she's taking care of us and taking care of me through it all through thick and thin um she was there truly god blessed me with a wonderful wonderful wife and my cousin stayed with me then and then um we can fast forward to wednesday april the 6th 2016. now before all of that brother david had organized a blood drive with the carter blood drive system and i appreciate him for that as well he didn't have to do anything like that but yet he desired to do it and i appreciate it the believers the brothers and sisters here that helped us through that period i really really appreciate it god is my witness and my judge i thank you from the bottom of my heart you know april the sixth six years ago to this date this day um it was found that i was eligible for a liver transplant i got the call we got the call late the afternoon and around midnight i said i'm gonna go sleep i'm just tired if i'm if i'm the one that must get the transplant wonderful there was another person before me and then at two two they called and we had to leave the house at 3am so yeah it was around two that they called and said you're the one that the delivery will be given to we need at the hospital and we're doing the procedure today that is now the seventh so my wife called brother david we called brother david and sister leslie and they prayed with us so you can see the hand of a pastor a real pastor a shepherd of the flock taking care of his sheep through it all i'm not just talking about my lives i watched brother david when we started coming i was watching him and his interaction with the people he has a deep set love like he said to you on sunday to all of us at least on sunday because of his love he doesn't step up to the plate sometimes to say certain things that might be hurtful it's because he loves us so much and i thank god for that in our pastor you know and certainly appreciate how brother david and sister leslie rallied to help us out so that day i remember i was in the hospital brother david came over there and brother aaron i think brother matthew was also there a few other brothers that i can't remember if i don't remember your name forgive me i'm really sorry oh let me go back while i was in the hospital you're at in grapevine brother tommy and brother andy came to minister to me and to anoint me with oil and pray for me while i was sick there and i appreciate that as well it's really been a blessing i always when i'm sitting by myself just me and my thoughts and i can thank god for all these things that's been done it really is an eye-opener of how will they know that you are my disciples it's when you have love one for one another you know and it's beyond just words it's in action and um that day brother david still whispered in my ear he said hey don't worry everything is taken care of i told brother david i said brother david he raises me up from that operating table i'm ready if he doesn't i'm still ready because i know i've given my all to him and my family would be well taken care of by him here at our local fellowship and i thank the lord for that that i've we found a place where we can just be ourselves and be at peace and know that we're part of this end time bride about a year after my transplant i don't recall what happened on the day of the transplant i never miss my baby gabby's birthday as the only one i missed so if i always say thank you for their birthdays it's because of this very testimony because he's given me grace to see it and enjoy every one of them as they grew up and i can see the hand of god in their lives and yeah after about a year after my transplant i had another complication where the bile ducts that sits on your liver on the side of your liver there um they had to perform surgery and put a stent in it because it kept on collapsing so that would force the poison back into my body get into my bloodstream that could kill me make me jaundiced again and all that stuff so i had a tube coming out of my rib cage here and during that time i was working with with brother cosman doing the over-the-road stuff i was in i was in pennsylvania now in georgia one time sitting there in the this restaurant and the er squad came in rushing in and i'm sitting there and they um giving cpr to a man choking and i'm sitting here thinking man you're so far from home what if that happens to you and i've got a tube coming out here that i have to clean every time god knows how to break you down and and make you realize he is in charge i mean i feel sorry for uh nebuchadnezzar that i had to run around naked as an animal eat the grass and the weeds because he was fighting with god i said lord don't let me get to that point ever i can be mule-headed but don't let me get there please lord have mercy you know currently i'm on six different medications and i do get migraines because of these medications it's one of the side effects but you know i was i was sitting down the other day and i was just thinking this is um brother brown says those are demons i didn't invite them into my home i didn't invite them into my body but they do attack me and jesus christ said by stripes i've been healed so i'm grateful for the healing but i'm waiting for the deliverance of that i'm grateful for the liver but i'm waiting for the transformation of this vile body you know as part of this end time right so keep me in prayer so i can get away from those headaches i'll read a few quotes here just to end this off i thank the lord for your patience i really do appreciate it out of the book victory day preaching 63 421 the first paragraph is 178. now remember when god has counted you worthy when you have a test now don't fail this to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of god as found you found favor with god and i stop and i think and i look at that how could i have found favor with god i'm just dust of the earth was inflation nowadays i'm probably not even worth a penny and i'll continue reading here and he said and god believes that you stand the test well he believes that you stand not just me you too he believes that you stand this test how does he know that it's because he's in you he promised it you remember he did the same thing to job satan said oh yes i seen job down there just put your name in there i said i see see gary down there see jackson down there see this one and that one down there said he's not brassy chris down there see john down there okay he said he's not god said he's a perfect servant imagine that brother matthew he's a perfect servant there's none in earth like him there's nobody nobody like job he's a perfect man now he's he's my he's my pride and joy satan said oh sure he gets everything he asks for said let me have him once and said i'll make him curse you to your face said i'll just make him curse you god said he's in your hands but don't you take his life see god had confidence in job amen when it looks like everything has gone wrong god is giving you a trial he's got confidence in you he don't have to baby you around you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid you're a real christian god is giving you a test see what you do about it amen no wonder peter said these fiery trials why counting the joy it's it's more precious to you than gold i can say amen to that then another one here it is the rising of the sun preaching 65 418. start in paragraph 40. the sun it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life to bring eternal life to all god's promised seed that by foreknowledge he had seen laying upon the earth no more could the botany life live back there at the beginning without the s-u-n to bring you to life no more than today when sons of god is upon the earth he's talking about us you and me it takes the s-o-n light to bring them to eternal life he's chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world that's what we heard on sunday and wednesday he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world and on easter morning then in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time and in heaven there was a book of memory and his attributes was eating knowing that because this son of god raised it would also raise to life every sun that was for ordained to do this great time he knew it would be and what a more glorious sunrise that was hold on here let me go back okay where did it go now hold on there that was then it was at the beginning at time when it first dawned he's talking about this end time then in paragraph 196 you're resurrected right then your body is potentially resurrected look at a little seed planted in the ground it has to drink from the his foundation from his fountain the waters that pours down and as it drinks it pushes up towards him coming more like the likeness of the sea that went into the ground see the church has come that way through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost now in the blossom the spirit of god comes through that and the spirit of the world has come through the antichrist the same way if that spur this is 2 15 if that spirit that raised up jesus from the dead from the dead dwells in you oh hallelujah your body ain't subject to sun to sin no more you your desires oh here's a good dinner over here nope not for me see my desires has changed my appetite is different for man shall not live on the world are caring alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god a genuine quickened eagle lives by that amen so god bless you may this testimony you heard this evening be an encouragement to each one of you i hope it lingers around with you that god is the same yesterday today if the musicians could come brother david we certainly appreciate his steadfastness for the lord you know a lot of times as the pastor you get credit for things but when darien laid there he had rent to pay he had bills to pay he had food to buy and all the believers pitched together and they all sacrificed and to the best of our ability we were not me we we don't have no whees eyes big eyes and little ears we have us a body fitted and joined together and standing together one for another and and you know like abraham you know he wasn't going to let his nephew be taken away he hit the plowshares and turned them into swords and went and rescued his own [Music] and darion was on the edge of death even before he got word on his liver transplanted it wasn't like oh he was just waiting in line no they told them if you don't get a liver in 30 days goodbye and the body went to praying and when you have a liver transplant you don't go to work the next day you know what i mean your wife can't go to work the next day because you don't have nobody to take care of your children but the body of the lord jesus christ stepped up for one of its own amen and we got him through that hard time i didn't get him through that hard time the body got them through the hard time with their money with their prayers with their offerings with everything that they could do to get him back on his feet and by the grace of god he used us all he used us all to help our brother and all i can say is that it was him [Music] you know he moves on your heart sometimes he puts a burden on your heart for somebody he he tells you to give of your time and that's the only way that the lord has to show himself is through flesh and the flesh he chooses to show himself through is your flesh and that's why it's so important to be sensitive to the unction of the holy spirit and the sacrifice and i believe that god brought him here because he knew there'd be a body here that would join in with him and help him and his family in the time of need and and the believers did that and uh and i think that it's all to the credit of god working together in the body making the word of god come of life every member supplying the need of the other fitted and joined together and that's really what this testimony is so much about it's about god bringing him to a body that fitted and joined with him and supplied the need that he has and that gift of this body doesn't die and end with brother darien it moves on to the next case and the next case and the next case until one day we all make it together amen and like we say we're not going to leave anybody behind we'll do all that we can one for another because as our brother quoted they'll know that you are my disciples by your love one for another so let's stand this evening and is this a song you're playing that's on my thing you know go ahead take the microphone let's just bow our head in prayer and give the lord thanks and then we'll sing the song before we're dismissed let us bow our hearts [Music] and maybe as you reflect this evening maybe in your heart you'll ask your heart do i live for others do i reach down and give of myself am i aware of the people around me that are in need [Music] am i willing to trust my well-being into the hands of the lord that i can live for others because you'll never out-give the lord our heavenly father as we come before you and our brother wanted to testify of your mighty love towards him and lord there is no way that he could describe how seriously ill he was father to the point that [Music] man's scientific machines could no longer record life in his body because there was no life there to record but lord you came on the scene and you restored his life lord and you gave him a spirit that never complained never gave up [Music] lord and you've joined him with a body that fought hand in hand with him lord and we love him he's a part of us he's one of us lord and we want to be in the rapture with him we all want to go together lord we always want to have that spirit father that we love one another that we're a part of one another and when one has a burden we all have a burden and when one rejoices we all rejoice [Music] lord we praise you tonight and worship you for how that you kept our brethren how that you supplied his needs and how that you provided father someone gave life that he might have life father the families of the donor lord god we ask you bless them father because we've been blessed by that sacrifice and lord i asked father that our charity and love one for another would increase and that we would learn to understand what's important in life it's the little things and when you come to a spot that you don't have anything as our brother testified and just wondering whether you will breathe is what's important it sure lets you know what's important and father our sister alana how much she's a part of this testimony never wavering never not having faith never complaining and never giving up father when we look at this fine christian family may we understand the trials that gave them the character that they have and may we be willing father to have this character in our life that whatever path you lead us down lord jesus we will lift our hands and we will praise your name we'll give you the honor and the glory and the good times we'll give you the honor and the glory and the bad times and we will always look up for we know our redeemer liveth and we will praise him and glorify his name for he is the same yesterday today and forever i don't know this song so help me [Music] is [Music] me [Music] hey [Music]

ends lord the testimony was set before us lorded [Music] it included believers their faith and their works benefited our brother but lord you use unbelievers as well [Music] lord you move mountains [Music] i set them on detours lord that they might wind up right where you'd have them to be when we think of our own lives when we hear this testimony and realize lord [Music] often it feels we're going the long way around [Music] rather than on the straight and narrow [Music] but lord you're working out our salvation through it all lord we just ask you just continue to do so with your loving hand that you guide us and you lead us lord and you're in control and we put our faith and trust in you [Music] and lord as we go we want to glean the fields lord as our brother said you're not going

service the sanctity of it just the blessings that you've given us lord the faith that you can kindle in our hearts lord lord as we leave here we just pray that we'll be this lord built up by it

together we thank you and praise you now ask these things in the name of the lord jesus did you enjoy that tonight you know we have a lot of tremendous testimonies in our midst the things that god's done the thing that god's kept us through maybe we'll try to take a few of these wednesday nights and give different members of the body a chance that we can know one another better yes and know the hand of the lord better and build all of us up in faith so lord richly bless you this week as we go forward let's pray that god will let his light shine in us amen amen is god good amen all the time
