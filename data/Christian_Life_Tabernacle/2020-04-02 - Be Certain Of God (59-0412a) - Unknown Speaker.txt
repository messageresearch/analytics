========================================

and give who she was and something about to the Lord's blessings upon her something other in Finnish language I don't even know English let alone finish so it goes to show that God speaks in all the languages and all human beings belong to him how wonderful he is doing the exceedingly abundantly I do not wish to take too much the time but just while this is all my mind I remember some time ago at the Sam Houston Coliseum and down in Houston Texas and we were trying to had such an overflow crowd - we were trying to take care of part of them at the Coliseum and part over to raymond riches now I'm sure that the Angeles temple knows who Raymond Richie is he was a personal friend to the founder of this church and I would pray over here for our prayer line and then go over to the Coliseum and praying and one night when my brother was taking me from the prayer line I heard a little Spanish girl weeping and she would have been the next in line according to the numbers of the prayer cards I was calling and she wasn't nothing but a child of 15 years old something well my brother started pushing me on and the man that was supposed to take me but somehow something told me see that child I said I'll bring her here and they brought her over and she gave her prayer card to the man and so she came over and I began to speak to her and and she just stood there I thought she might be deaf and dumb but find out she couldn't speak English she could not understand one of English and so I asked that there was an interpreter and they got a man and brought him up for the interpretation well I asked her a few questions and she began answering me through the interpreter and then all of a sudden the vision come and I said I see before me a little girl with little plaited hair hanging down her back she's sitting by an old fireplace eating yellow corn from a cob that's being took from a kid all of which hangs over the fireplace and she's eaten too much of it she falls violently ill and she's taken to the bed by her mother and throwed in to epilepsy and then the vision left and the little girl turned to the interpreter and said in Spanish I thought he couldn't speak Spanish and the interpreter said you spoke English did you not brother branham I said I did he said well she said you spoke Spanish I said stop the recorders all along the road and they stopped and we played it back and every word was English and then we had her to repeat what I said and as long as the vision was going on she heard every word in English why here how here we ever man in our own tongue wherein we were born God is still God now when I begin to save words within myself she didn't understand that at all but the Holy Spirit speaking English was interpreted to her in Spanish God is a good God is or Robert's places him certainly is true and if we could only grasp that this afternoon that his goodness so that little finish or whatever she was last night to be sure that her faith would be recognized he called her in her own language wonderful now overseas many times we see that happen in the foreign countries that I'll be standing speaking and it will turn right back around and use my language and call people their names and everything just like it does here in their own native language that's what I call pentti kahma stuff that's a Holy Spirit now the last few nights we haven't been giving out any prayer cards for a prayer line so I believe it would be an order tonight to have a prayer line to pray for the sing all next week beginning Tuesday night we expect to go all through next week so you come out each night come praying bringing somebody with you the boys will be giving out the prayer cards and about 35 minutes as soon as the service is finished here and you who want a prayer card just remain now they all bring their prayer cards up here and give them out to anyone who wants them may the Lord at ease blessings to all that we do for we do it in his name now to our subject and to our lesson for a few moments brother David read the scriptures because I just met an old friend that's setting present this afternoon about two years ago I was up on the river of no return with my good friends the Christian businessman I'm loved to hunt and they had a new guide that year and I Connie fell in love with this man a young fella and he would I liked him there seemed to be something about him that was a little more than a cowpoke and I had met his wife she was a waitress at the restaurant at the place where we were eating up at North fork's near Salmon River Idaho and on the road back it happened to be that God let this young fella become a chum to me to hunt with me and I remember getting a good shot one morning at my elk way across the valleys and and got him very humane and this young fellow was helping me skinned him out and I was noticing him and I said to him Jim are you a Christian and I believe he said he'd long to some church or something another but there was something about him it seemed honest that night when we went in sit at the table I kept watching him while he was laying on his camp bag sleeping I passed by and laid my hand upon him and asked God to save him and today him and his lovely little wife meets me back here in the back there are both Pentecostal believers has got the Holy Ghost setting present now prayer changes things brother Gliss be oh he's so real if we just pray and then believe that we get what we asked for so that's why I had brother duplicity to read the word for me I just had to greet Jim and his wife God's give him a lovely little baby since then we're happy now brother David was reading out of the book of Kings of Elijah the great prophet and it must have been a terrible morning dry and hot there hadn't had no rain for three years and six months it was so dried hot - the world was ready to blaze into the the people were starving in the streets and there was a cry everywhere all this had been brought on because of the moral decay of the nation Israel was loved of God but when they got out of the will of God the enemy taken them over God loves his church but when we get out of the will of God the enemy takes the church over and Ahab who was king of Israel at that time and to my thinking the most wicked King Israel ever had because he married an idolaters Ebell she was a sinner and an ungodly person and instead of being a man of his own house he gave in to her and through that they had caused the nation to come to moral decay then went after brought the nation into idolatry because it they'd went after her idols it's something similar to today all the people agreed that it was all right for him to do that because the government the king and the Queen endorsed it and they was the most popular people in that nation and because the king and the Queen did it the people thought that it would be all right now that's about the picture of our country today many people just follow one another and they think because that the government has given the boost sellers license to sell whiskey that it's all right to get drunk it wrong and many times good women think because that the cigarette companies puts these pictures out on these advertisements of women smoking cigarettes and the movie stars the many of them and the popular women smoke that it's alright that's what's caused our moral decay in this nation the backbone of any nation is motherhood break motherhood you broke the back of the nation and when I've got a statistics that shows that I believe it's about 80% of cigarette smoking mother's has to raise their baby's own bottles because there's so much nicotine in their blood it will kill the baby before it's 18 months old you talk about a sabotage that's one of the greatest sabotages the nation's got and regardless of all of the warnings that the doctors put out such slogans as cancer by carload and all these warnings the people want to follow one another because it's some silly woman actress of some sort advertises cigarettes and and blows it through her nose and act smart but that's no place or no thing for a lady to do it's wrong I was passing down one of your streets here a few days ago and I seen in a barroom it said tables for ladies I don't mean to be rude I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but ladies don't go on places like that they've never had one in there I'd imagine they've never had a customer and never will because it's no place for ladies but find people sometime see those things and and see people who are up and up what we call go into such places and they think that's the thing for them to do fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty but you see that the King had said this is alright because his wife thought it was alright and then caused the moral decay and then they thought because they were prosperous no wars and so forth that that was a sign that God was with him prosperity is not always a sign that God is with you many times that's deceiving the rain falls on the just and the unjust but it's by their fruits they are known and so this nation was really corrupted and God had sent judgment upon all the preachers had been under the heavy load because the members of the church had forced them to do things I feel sorry for a preacher that's got no more God about him than to let his congregation dick to him and get him off in a rut like that I believe that we need preachers that's man that's god-fearing God sent servants who's not afraid to come back black and white white the Gospels been handled too much now with kid gloves on we need some old-fashioned preaching like Billy Sunday and John the Baptist and some old-fashioned hell fire brimstone messages again back to the people I know it's not popular so when they got away from that you see water condition the nation's got in so it it takes that brother and all that the pastor's to give in so they let the that had a social gospel no doubt and so but there was one who didn't give him there was a little old prophet in the land in that day he didn't bow down to any of their idols for he knowed that Jehovah was a holy God and he required holiness and cleansiness and decency or he know that Jehovah could not change and if Jehovah the bring the children out of Israel had to cleanse and sanctify them and when they walked disorderly according to his Commandments he placed judgment upon them he note that Jehovah was the same yesterday today and forever therefore he would not give him Oh Jesse Bell hated him and all of her company hated him but God loved and respected him because he never let down on the word of body stayed with it God give us more Elijah's in this cruel evil day of corruption that we're living in that's not a scared to preach what's the truth what the Bible says without holiness no man shall see the Lord you must be cleansed from your sins by the blood of the Lord Jesus now there was a woman in the land neither one of these people know each other but she must have been an honorable woman she must have been the type of woman that Elijah was a man because God chose that woman out of all the women that there was in Israel to entertain his prophet and he would have never chosen immoral woman they entertained his prophet and this woman was a winter woman the drought was in the land and she started out after the death of her husband she had a little baby to raise and she was struggling to try to make a living for the little fella and finally the bread begin to season it come to a place one day when she went in to look at her little fella had she seen his little sleeves out Turin she might have looked at herself in a mirror and seen that how she left the table with something on it for the baby and her own cheek bones are sticking out and her little frail looking arms she didn't mind it for herself but the little boy she was crying didn't want to see him die so finally one day she went to the meal bell and there was just one handful of meal left she goes over to the cruise to see how much oil and just about a good tablespoon full that's stood between her and death I suppose that night there was an all-night prayer meeting isn't it strange how God lets us get right down to the end of the road no doubt but she checked up said Lord God something like this I've heard you I've done all that I know how to do I've met your requirements here I've got one handful of meal and a spoonful of oil between death for my child and myself all night long she must have prayed and when the little fella would wake up turn over and say mama would you go back to the cupboard and see if there just a little bit of that bread left she'd go back cry a little and then she would come back and give him a little water to drink for she knew she could just had this little bit and it had maybe make the next day and the little fella maybe couldn't sleep good because of hungry I've been through those places no doubt but what there's many here been through those places I see my mother leave the table of the morning set back in the house and cry when she what we had on the table is some stale bread and she'd pour some coffee over to some sugar over the top of it for us kiddies and go back in the room and weep say I'm not hungry when she was hungry that's trying to go to school like that and the woman as she seen knows that crucial hour coming no doubt she checked up and said Lord I've done all that I know how to do when you've done everything that you know how to do and met every requirement that God has required that's where faith takes a hold that's where faith comes in if you've met every requirement that God required you to do then sometimes God tests your faith to see what kind of a reaction you'll have on your action or he's good at that it just lets it just proves whether you really believe what you think you believe you know it does that many times one morning there was some Hebrew children was going to be burnt up and they knew that they had done God's will and they said we're not afraid of the Kings commandment our God is able to deliver us from this fiery furnace nevertheless will not bow to his image God was going to give him a test to see what their reaction to their action would be and he let them walk right straight to the fiery furnace before he ever moved but when all of God's requirements has been met and you're certain of God that God will do it stand still there and battle do it if you sit in these meetings and you sing the Lord God move out over the audience healing the sick and afflicted and yet you seem to still have your disease and when I asked from the put hands on each other and you've made your wrongs right before him you've accepted him and you've been baptized in Christian faith and your hearts clean before him then sometime when gob delays his answer he's only wanting to see what you react by just be sure that you believe that it's God and then hold on to it don't if you've been prayed for hands laid only by believers the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe that's God's requirement and God requires you to believe his word job God let the devil test job once when job went out and made a burnt offering for his children they had a party so job note in his days what teenagers is like what they were made up of that mind that can't get settled and so job said perhaps what if my children did sin I'll offer a burnt offering for him anyhow and money was standing on that aisle free what God required a burnt offering that's all he required to confess and make a burnt offering and job no he did that and then the devil was turned loose on him and he began to kill his children destroy his goods and he had some of his church members come to him and said you are a secret sinner you've got something in your heart that you haven't confessed job but don't know that he hadn't done it he was sure that he hadn't met God's requirements and he stood and said he knowed he confessed his sins call for God to trim' search him and see if there was anything wrong see God was just waiting to see what Joba do because Satan said I'll make him curse you to your face but God said there's none like him in the earth he won't do it God had confidence anything I maybe if your healings are angered a little bit God's got confidence in you that your if you believe that the Holy Spirit the signs and wonders that he promised is being done here then accept that and hold on to it God's requirement I'm the Lord who heals all our diseases when you receive the Holy Spirit get burned again I'm the devil of against the tip Chi oh you're wearing the same clothes you look like you used to but you're sure that something happened inside of you God changed your life don't make any difference whap the devil said just get away from it because you're sure that it's God amen amen means so be it I'm sure the Holy Spirit is here now I'm sure of it and I know that what we asked we will receive it it might not come just right now but it's got to come God's promise is true we asked him for anything we don't doubt we believe that what we asked for we get because we met God's requirements giving our life to him shrink our will to him our lives our soul all that we are we have surrender to God then our heart condemns us not we can have what we asked for if he abide me and my word and you asked what you will and it shall be done unto you that's his promise just be sure that you know God and know what that's his promise someone said to me many times brother said aren't you afraid brother Branham when you go there at nighttime that maybe that angel of the Lord might leave you sometime I said sure he won't because he promised me he wouldn't do it I've got faith in God to believe in you meet that requirement that night Portland that maniac ran out on a platform to kill me you've read the story you better be sure of it then but I was sure that I wasn't trying to speak of myself when he called me a snake in the grass and spit in my face and said tonight I'm going to knock you all the way out into that audience I just stood still he weighed 250 or more Highway 128 I had to look up to him those great big giant Li arms and his teeth set in his eyes his fist drawback running towards me and the Spirit of God said because you challenge the Spirit of God tonight you fall over my feet that was God that wasn't me so he said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over and he drew his fists back to hit me and when he did I said Satan come out of the man and he fell and pinned my feet to the floor to the policeman had to roll him over my feet just be sure it's God and then hold on to it stay with it God says anything he has to keep his word just be certain that it's God take God's Word if God whispers your heart I'm the Lord that healeth thee stay with it that's God's promise God promises to give the Holy Spirit stay with it until it comes I was reading old uncle buddy Robinson's book here some time ago and he was playing Korn he said with his old mule etic and he got mad at Alec that morning because she was tramping down the Carn any on the ears and she ran off and looked at him and he said Alec I'm ashamed that I you said it looky here me preaching sanctification with the teeth full of new hair is that what a disgrace and then he got ashamed of himself and he got down in the row of corn and said if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back you'll find a pile of bones laying here then he received it be certain it's God then hold on to it she was certain she'd walked upright before God and God proved it by inviting his prophet to live with her see God confirms things so the morning was breaking the birds was beginning to sing his dog began to break she looked at the little fella again and she patted him she knelt down and said Lord God he'll be getting up in a few minutes I'll go and prepare the last thing I got and give it to him and then I'll take him in my arms and we'll die together so she went and got the handful of meal now meal was a meal offering which means Christ the word and when they ground the meal offering in the days of the Bible they used a certain bird that ground every little bit of meal just exactly the same there was no difference in it well that types this the same means Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever when God ground his life out of him at Calvary he gave it to the church that he would be the same then she goes and gets the oil the oil represents the spirit that's we while we anoint with oil it represents the spirit and she put the spit the oral and the meal together and begin to prepare it and when the spirit and the word gets together something's going to take place [Music] she was at the end so she got the word and the spirit and beginning to mix it together now it's ready for bacon she goes out in the yard to pick up two sticks did you notice the Bible said two sticks now in the old days Jimmy I guess we've done it many times ourselves you take two sticks and cross them and you put the fire right in the middle and as the sticks burn you push them in if you're camping out at night it keeps the fire going all night long pushing it in the fire was in the middle if you notice the two sticks represented the cross self-sacrifice now she mix the word and the the spirit together and was ready to put it to the fire and she goes to pick up these sticks and perhaps you just got the last one in her hand and was starting back in the house and she looked at the gate there was a gentle looking old man perhaps bald-headed and whiskers hanging down standing lean across the gate he said would you fetch me just a little drink of water she looked at even thought well I've got just about a half a gallon in the house but the poor old fellas look so thirsty I'll be willing to divide with him and she might have said yes kind sir I will get you a little water because the springs have dried up and everything all water's had dried up and she started in to get the water and he note you see God answers on both ends of the line about two hours before that the brook had dried up on top of the mountain where Elijah was he said Elijah go down to the city and keep walking until you find a woman with two sticks in her hand she's gonna feed you God does things real I've sent you down there and she's going to feed you she hasn't got nothing in the house but I'm going to feed you and he walked down the street till he seen that woman packing those two sticks and that must be her so he had to catch her attention he said would you fetch me a little water and she said I will and she's turned and started he said and just bring me a little morsel of bread in your hand Elijah's seeing that vision already know what the conditions was and she said as the Lord liveth I too knew she was a Christian and a believer as the Lord liveth I've only got just a handful of meal and a spoonful of oil that have already prepared I've dressed it got it ready and I'm taking these two sticks to make a little cake for my son and I and we're going to eat it and I see now here comes a great lesson but he'll I just said bake me one first Oh what is it there what lesson do we learn seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness make me one first and she looked she said I wonder who that is there's something about the man that seems to be i nee said break me one first and bring it and she started in to do what he said then she heard that comforting word that always comforts for thus saith the Lord the barrel of not meeting her the crew shrunk until the day that God sends rain on the earth what was it that very dark crucial moment come but God's always on the scene if you're sure that it's God if you've repented of your sins if you've met God's requirement then be sure that God will keep his promise women can only realize that God's obligated to his promise and a few various requirements if you confess your sins and you made your wrongs right and you've done everything God has required then hold on to God you've got to see daylight he's got to bring you through just be certain that it's God and he'll take care of the rest of it if you're sure that it's God some time ago I was over at a little city in Arkansas about 15 years ago not quite that long I say 12 years ago I have a terrible segregation in Arkansas and I've been into a little church and the policeman helped me in and out I was coming out of the church and I could hear someone saying Mercy Mercy I thought worries that coming from and I looked over to my left standing over to one side stood up a Negro man we're out from the white people he had his a little cap in his hand hard mercy merci and something struck me that man wants to talk to me and I said to the policeman I said I want to go over to see that man always said mr. Branum you can't do that you'd start trouble here in Arkansas said you can't do that he said we just can't let you do that I said but the Holy Spirit's telling me to go he said my brother Ram you'll start a race right so all these white people here to be prayed for and you go there their colour minister octane tout what kind of laws you got I follow a law and that law is the law of the spirit and he said go to that man and I just pull loose from him and I went over there and I heard his wife say people good courage honey the parson is coming and I got over there I said how do you do you had his hands out I guess he said is you I'm not saying this disregarding to my colored friends either you're on the radio but he had a real southern talk and he said is this you parson Brandon and I said

eyes the doctor man said he couldn't take him off they don't wrapped around the optical nerve and he couldn't take him off he said I never heard of you in my life parson Branham but said last night

brother branham to pray for you're going to get your sign he says do you please that brother Brennan I said I'd believe it with all my heart he said my home and me never told me a lie in her life and I got up and put all my clothes and my wife helped me to the bus station and we went over to the auditorium they told us you were here and we come over here and been standing here and it raining as hard as it could rain I looked at him I put my arms around him I said Lord God I don't know but somehow he's certain and I'm certain that you let his old mammy come to him in a dream that tell him that he's going to get his sight and he's so sure that he's going to get his sight Lord God let it be now and I know Lord said that he started bad in his eyes he said thank you Lord now said can you

sometime across the river yonder when we have both climbed the golden stairs into your kingdom I shall see him there because he was certain he couldn't read your word but you spoke to him by dream and by his truthful mother and he was certain that his mother wouldn't LA and if you had sent him a dream javis mother he knew that he was sure that he was to get esight I believe father that's the reason you gave it to him he moved from his bed he went into action he put his faith to work and you confirmed his faith by giving him his sight there are many sitting here Lord today maybe out in radioland
