[26:51] we bring petitions but forget our song
[26:57] asking questions like lord how or why
[27:03] or just complain about how hard we've
[27:07] tried
[27:10] but if he were to ask this time
[27:16] this might be the question
[27:20] on his mind
[27:25] don't you think you ought to worship me
[27:30] don't you think you ought to spend some
[27:34] time
[27:37] with your hands up in the air offer more
[27:40] than just your prayer and give me what
[27:44] is rightly my
[27:48] it's true i wanna hear from you
[27:53] all your questions and your every need
[27:59] give me all your doubts and fears but

[28:15] alone can go so far
[28:20] but mixed with praise he meets us where
[28:23] we
[28:24] are
[28:25] we can't just see him as a helping hand
[28:31] he's so much more
[28:33] he's the great i am
[28:37] for all his kindness he won't as much
[28:45] he only wants us to show him our love
[28:52] don't you think you ought to worship me
[28:58] don't you think you ought to spend some
[29:01] time
[29:04] with your hands up in the air offer more

[30:35] [Music]
[30:38] [Applause]
[30:42] and i'll be just one moment
[30:57] and i apologize for having used my phone
[30:58] my written notes are in another bible
[31:12] um by originally sorry i'm a bit nervous
[31:14] i'll probably cry
[31:16] um
[31:23] we wanted to give this testimony for a
[31:25] while but then
[31:27] we've been hearing such wonderful things
[31:29] from
[31:30] everyone from camp lately just um and
[31:32] timing happened actually this past week
[31:35] something else that just added to my own
[31:37] testimony that i felt um
[31:39] with the opportunity that i had to be
[31:40] here tonight that i would go ahead and
[31:42] give it
[31:44] um
[31:46] i actually wanted to
[31:48] start with a scripture uh it's in joshua
[31:50] chapter one uh it's a very familiar
[31:53] passage uh to many of us
[31:55] uh starting with verse seven
[31:56] only be thou strong and very courageous
[31:59] that thou mayest observe to do according
[32:00] to all the law which moses my servant
[32:03] commanded thee
[32:05] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[32:06] the left
[32:07] that thou mayest prosper without
[32:09] wherever so out where there's life
[32:11] without goest
[32:12] this book of the law shall not depart
[32:14] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[32:15] there in day and night that thou mayest
[32:17] observe to do according to all that is
[32:19] written therein for then thou shalt make
[32:21] thy way prosperous
[32:23] and then thou shalt have good success
[32:25] have not i commanded thee be strong and
[32:27] of a good courage
[32:29] be not afraid
[32:35] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[32:37] thy god is with thee
[32:38] i think there's whoever thou goest
[32:46] and as many of you know me
[32:49] um
[32:50] for the past six years i've been in
[32:51] college in and out
[32:53] living on campus and working
[32:55] for the most part
[32:57] and i just really want to first of all
[32:59] think
[33:00] full congregation for um many of you i
[33:02] know personally have prayed for me and
[33:04] kept me in your hearts over the years
[33:05] and just really supported me throughout
[33:07] that time
[33:10] always wonderful to come back to home
[33:11] church
[33:12] where you know you're loved and where
[33:13] you're supported
[33:15] and where you can take the pressure off
[33:17] and
[33:18] just really be in the house of the lord
[33:20] with fellowship
[33:22] and i just want to praise the lord for
[33:24] he's been so faithful and kept me
[33:25] throughout all of that
[33:28] and really for for blessing me with um
[33:31] a significant provision all that i've
[33:33] really needed uh in those six years
[33:35] especially um as some of you know from
[33:37] my undergrad experience
[33:39] i was very blessed to receive a terry
[33:41] scholarship which was a full ride
[33:43] which doesn't just cover tuition like
[33:45] some full rides it covered everything it
[33:46] covered books it covered
[33:49] all my fees even it gave me the extra
[33:50] stipends
[33:51] so i didn't have to work through that
[33:52] undergrad experience
[33:55] and so that was just a huge blessing and
[33:57] there was an interview process for going
[33:59] into it
[34:00] and
[34:02] there's actually two interviews you have
[34:03] to do and after the first one even just
[34:05] through the university selection
[34:08] coming out of that interview there was
[34:09] just
[34:12] just a piece about it because i knew
[34:14] that
[34:16] compared to all those other students in
[34:17] there
[34:19] i knew that i had something else behind
[34:20] me
[34:22] and i just
[34:25] knew that i had others praying for me
[34:27] for for what that was and
[34:29] and
[34:30] i i almost didn't i almost kind of died
[34:31] at first i was like i didn't want to
[34:32] feel arrogant and say like oh you know
[34:34] what i've got this
[34:35] just because of of the work i'd done but
[34:37] i just somehow kind of felt the lord and
[34:40] it was just you know this is this is
[34:41] going to be something that
[34:43] he's going to reward me with and there's
[34:45] something that he's he's behind me in it
[34:49] and
[34:50] something else right before my
[34:52] graduation about three weeks before my
[34:53] graduation there was
[34:56] actually a surprise
[34:57] i was three weeks away from graduation
[34:59] and doing my degree audit my professor's
[35:01] office
[35:02] which is just a process you have to go
[35:03] through to kind of say you're actually
[35:05] ready for graduation you've completed
[35:06] all your hours
[35:07] and there was um
[35:09] a moment where he's checking it and
[35:11] somehow like i
[35:13] my current job at the time is actually
[35:14] to help other students with their
[35:16] scheduling but somehow i missed it as
[35:17] well but i had 15 hours worth of credits
[35:19] that i had not completed they're all
[35:20] election hours elective hours i should
[35:22] say um
[35:24] so i completed everything for my degree
[35:25] but those elective hours and
[35:28] i
[35:29] almost broke down at my professor's
[35:30] office
[35:32] but just kind of was trying to breathe
[35:33] and just say okay
[35:35] i don't have housing i don't know if i
[35:37] can still have my funding i don't know
[35:39] how this is going to work out
[35:41] um but that day i kind of just went home
[35:44] cried a bit i called my mom said hey
[35:47] i'm going to be here for another
[35:48] semester um i immediately called housing
[35:50] called um
[35:52] and let my
[35:53] my advisor know um through the
[35:56] scholarship and it was still covered i
[35:58] was able to find housing i was able to
[36:01] take that extra time
[36:03] um and it turned out to just be god's
[36:05] timing and just that time i was like you
[36:07] know
[36:08] this may not be what i was expecting i
[36:09] was expecting to graduate three weeks
[36:11] but you know there's a reason why these
[36:13] other months are going to happen
[36:15] and so i was just kind of trusting the
[36:16] lord in that and later that semester i
[36:19] was able to get an internship um with a
[36:21] um didn't county courthouse museum
[36:23] that's up there
[36:24] it allowed me to take that time to
[36:26] really get that experience which led me
[36:28] to go to grad school
[36:30] it was just god's timing in that as well
[36:33] and then
[36:36] and of course once i actually made the
[36:37] decision to go to grad school it's like
[36:38] okay where
[36:40] and i was looking into different
[36:41] programs i wanted to go to and
[36:44] baylor ended up being my first choice
[36:46] now saying okay
[36:48] i don't have any student debt which is
[36:50] awesome but i'm going to try to go to a
[36:52] private university for my grad school
[36:54] how am i going to pay for that
[36:56] and so
[36:57] again i was just kind of trusting the
[36:58] lord so you know you've provided me this
[37:00] far
[37:01] i know you can do it again
[37:03] and
[37:04] just a few weeks after my acceptance i
[37:07] was offered a two-thirds tuition
[37:08] scholarship
[37:11] and it just kind of again felt right
[37:14] and the lord was just providing it so
[37:16] many mighty ways
[37:17] and
[37:19] um
[37:20] and then just this semester kind of just
[37:22] trying to finish thing everything up
[37:24] trying to
[37:26] kind of just direct things and um
[37:28] kind of work through the last pressure
[37:29] is okay you know like
[37:30] then like i'm fully graduating now just
[37:32] the transition to like possibly moving
[37:34] back home where i was going to be
[37:36] a job search and everything like that
[37:39] and just trying to figure out how i
[37:41] could how could pay for it all because i
[37:43] have worked two jobs through grad school
[37:44] just provide for myself down in waco
[37:47] and i was just trying to figure out how
[37:48] it all work of course i want to be here
[37:50] for jenna's wedding and for my family
[37:52] this summer
[37:54] i wanted to be able to make sure that
[37:56] i could also put my my shoulder to the
[37:58] wheel
[37:59] and
[38:01] this past monday
[38:08] i randomly got an email in my account
[38:11] saying to check my baylor account
[38:15] that there was a message and and usually
[38:17] that means okay there's some kind of fee
[38:18] you have to pay for there's something
[38:19] extra
[38:20] and so i wanted to check and make sure
[38:22] everything's gonna be good of course
[38:23] because my own graduation now is about
[38:24] two weeks away
[38:26] i didn't want that to mess with anything
[38:28] and a friend of mine had even actually
[38:30] been having some issues with something
[38:31] that had happened to her so i was just
[38:33] like you know i'm gonna go and call the
[38:34] financial aid office
[38:37] and i call them
[38:40] because i was just looking at the amount
[38:41] my count saying i don't know about this
[38:42] i don't know what this is necessarily
[38:45] but they confirmed that it was real and
[38:47] that it was
[38:48] that it was there and it was
[38:52] and then it was um it actually was not
[38:54] if a fee that i was going to have to pay
[38:55] was actually credit in my account
[39:01] and tomorrow is when it'll come through
[39:04] and it's just a it's actually a tuition
[39:06] grant
[39:07] for about three and a half thousand
[39:09] dollars
[39:11] that just randomly that i was kind of
[39:12] just one of the lucky people to get
[39:16] and it's just a total answer to prayer
[39:18] because i'm gonna be able to
[39:20] end my semester job at the at the um
[39:23] universities museum and i'm being able
[39:25] to quit my other job and move back here
[39:27] without having to worry about anything
[39:38] so the lord has just been so good and i
[39:40] can
[39:42] and i can just
[39:44] and i just can't say enough um and then
[39:47] just briefly
[39:49] on a more personal level
[39:51] uh throughout that time
[39:53] in college of course there's a lot of
[39:54] pressure a lot of things
[39:56] that if anybody has been through the
[39:58] collegiate experience knows
[40:00] it's difficult and of course being on my
[40:02] own especially for majorly for the first
[40:04] time
[40:05] i was dealing with a lot of
[40:08] questions about personal identity and
[40:10] some social anxiety and some actually
[40:11] some severe depression at the time
[40:14] and
[40:15] um and even this semester especially
[40:19] um just kind of actually from
[40:21] here to the testimonies but then also
[40:22] some of the really great preaching
[40:24] that's that's been things have been said
[40:26] it's just been
[40:27] a real
[40:28] real blessing to me personally and
[40:30] um
[40:32] i can just really praise the lord for
[40:33] relieving me of that as well
[40:36] and i'm still just going to claim the
[40:37] victory and just keep walking forward in
[40:39] it as well
[40:41] and uh but just how perfectly the word
[40:44] kind of dovetails i had another
[40:45] scripture
[40:46] uh in second timothy
[40:48] uh chapter one and verse seven
[40:52] for god hath not given us the spirit of
[40:54] fear
[40:55] but of power and of love and of a sound
[40:57] mind
[40:59] be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[41:01] testimony of our lord nor of me his
[41:03] prisoner
[41:04] but be thou partaker the afflictions of
[41:06] the gospel according to the power of god
[41:08] who hath saved us and called us with a
[41:10] holy calling
[41:11] not according to our works but according
[41:13] to his own purpose and grace which has
[41:15] given us in christ jesus before the
[41:17] world began
[41:19] now it's made manifest by the appearing
[41:21] of our savior jesus christ who has
[41:23] abolished death and hath brought life
[41:24] and immortality to light through the
[41:26] gospel
[41:28] and so i just in total
[41:30] um
[41:31] he just brought me through so much his
[41:33] personal growth him and in the word and
[41:35] everything else that
[41:37] that um i can just only say good things
[41:40] and i just want to thank everyone for
[41:42] your love and support throughout all
[41:43] this time
[41:45] and
[41:46] it just again just kind of want to walk
[41:48] forward and just testify of that and um
[41:51] to keep
[41:53] keep looking for the wonderful things
[41:55] god is going to keep doing because i
[41:56] know that he's providing for me and had
[41:58] that personal experience and i also just
[42:01] cover prayers going forward for
[42:03] a job search in the future especially
[42:04] towards the end of the summer as i move
[42:06] forward
[42:07] and
[42:09] and i just want to encourage anybody
[42:10] else like when he's your reason to live
[42:13] he'll provide
[42:14] he'll do it all that you need
[42:18] your personal healing you're
[42:20] providing financially safety
[42:22] it's brought me through having covet
[42:24] myself right before one of my semesters
[42:25] and february ice storm that was in 2020
[42:28] that was kind of a rough period as well
[42:30] but he provided and he's just been
[42:31] wonderful so thank you
[42:40] praise the lord
[42:42] amen his ways are past finding out
[42:45] amen when you think you
[42:47] that's the end of you you don't know
[42:49] what to do he will come through that's
[42:51] his promise to us amen amen

[45:58] that
[45:59] has always been
[46:02] i guess
[46:04] uh one of the scriptures that's always
[46:05] kept me going i just felt i'd like to
[46:07] read it again

[46:32] seated for a few moments for i'm not
[46:35] going to be long we're just going to go
[46:36] right into
[46:37] the communion service uh
[46:42] i
[46:44] was kind of asked a question if you
[46:46] wanted to know where i what i where i
[46:48] read from this morning
[46:50] it was uh
[46:51] in
[46:52] 311
[46:54] 1956
[46:56] god
[46:57] using
[46:58] his gifts
[47:00] and someone asked me where that quote
[47:02] was that i uh mentioned
[47:05] and brother brown tells the story in
[47:07] here it's beautiful he
[47:09] dramatizes the story
[47:12] of
[47:13] blind bartimaeus and
[47:18] how that
[47:19] barnabas
[47:21] came to the city that one day
[47:24] to beg
[47:25] and he he went to his normal place that
[47:29] he
[47:31] would sit and
[47:35] and
[47:36] beg and
[47:37] asked for alms uh to help him because he
[47:40] was blind in his family and
[47:42] he tells the story about his good wife
[47:44] and his daughter and
[47:46] and uh i i don't know nobody can
[47:49] make something come so alive like
[47:51] brother bran o'connor
[47:53] i when he says i can just see him coming
[47:56] now
[47:57] i really think he was just seeing him
[48:00] coming now you know
[48:03] just
[48:04] a way about it but he noticed that there
[48:06] was nobody there that day
[48:09] and uh
[48:10] so
[48:11] he he's talking how the crowds weren't
[48:14] there as they usually were
[48:16] in other words the people were off
[48:19] somewhere
[48:20] and and so he
[48:23] he goes on him
[48:24] and
[48:26] he comes to this part and he's talking
[48:29] about
[48:30] he said
[48:36] he comes down he says and he begin to
[48:38] think
[48:40] settling in the warm sun
[48:43] he gathered up his ragged
[48:46] coat around him
[48:48] which he could not afford a new one
[48:53] and
[48:54] he was the provider for his family
[48:57] and he thought of his family first
[49:00] before himself any
[49:02] real true dad
[49:04] will do that and husband
[49:07] any christian will think of others
[49:09] before himself
[49:12] every christian tries to put god first
[49:16] his family second
[49:20] his
[49:21] number
[49:22] third
[49:23] i've tried to make that
[49:26] a practice in my own life
[49:29] isn't that
[49:30] the way to be
[49:32] and i see him sitting there
[49:35] it was a good time he said
[49:38] to kind of
[49:39] no stirring up and down the street
[49:42] everything seemed to be quiet for a long
[49:44] time
[49:45] i don't know where everyone's at today
[49:49] but seemingly
[49:51] there's
[49:52] no one here
[49:54] and he snuggles down there in the warm
[49:58] sunlight
[49:59] and he begins to kind of think things
[50:02] over
[50:05] i do
[50:06] i just get away sometimes and i drive my
[50:09] car
[50:11] out way out into the country
[50:14] and i get back in the woods
[50:16] and turn off
[50:19] turn the key off
[50:20] and just go out and sit down on the log
[50:24] somewhere
[50:25] and just think things over
[50:27] get alone
[50:30] i said every christian
[50:32] ought to do that just get some place
[50:35] down and think things over and
[50:38] then take the time to put things into
[50:40] perspective and
[50:42] and and look at all what you're
[50:44] frustrated about and
[50:46] all that you're worried about
[50:49] and
[50:50] then how heavy the load
[50:52] is that you have on him you know the
[50:54] scripture says cast your cares upon him
[50:57] for he cleareth to you and then and
[51:00] another place he says my burden is light
[51:02] you know
[51:03] my loads like my burden is easy it's not
[51:06] a heavy thing it's not grievous to serve
[51:09] god
[51:11] and you just take the time and
[51:14] and get along with them and and think it
[51:16] over and and and
[51:19] settle down and and just and just run
[51:23] run run your life
[51:25] through your own eyes and sit back and
[51:27] look at yourself
[51:29] and
[51:30] i i found out that
[51:33] when i take time to look at myself
[51:38] i find out that many times i'm guilty of
[51:40] the very things that i'm frustrated
[51:42] about other people
[51:45] you know i think about oh such and such
[51:48] is so impatient and then the little bit
[51:51] i start thinking about it i said well
[51:53] look at me
[51:54] i'm really impatient with them
[51:57] it's not their problem it's my problem
[52:00] and and just that time together alone
[52:04] and
[52:05] you know he he made a promise
[52:08] and you know we know the promises in the
[52:10] scripture and
[52:12] and we read the scriptures and we kind
[52:15] of sometimes they become mechanical to
[52:18] us
[52:19] and we take them back into history and
[52:22] we take them into the future
[52:24] but
[52:25] they're actually
[52:27] uh
[52:28] the word of god
[52:30] is actually where you're at
[52:34] you know what i'm saying it's it is
[52:36] excuse me
[52:41] i've graduated the big bottles
[52:44] one time i told them i said well i'm
[52:46] gonna quit preaching when i run out of
[52:49] water i was preaching a meeting
[52:50] someplace i used to do a lot of those
[52:53] and i came out and they had five bottles
[52:55] of water on the platform so i guess they
[52:58] were okay with what what i was preaching
[53:00] but
[53:02] but
[53:02] the word of god is for for where you're
[53:05] at
[53:06] because we're the people that think in
[53:09] beginning
[53:10] and end
[53:11] and time
[53:12] and future but everything in god is
[53:15] right now
[53:18] there's no way that he he
[53:21] he can be eternal
[53:23] without it being
[53:24] right now
[53:26] in fact i i love what he said the color
[53:29] of your eyes the color of your hair the
[53:31] stature that you were in he saw it then
[53:35] he said he may
[53:36] not have been a million years
[53:39] until
[53:40] it manifested but it was going to
[53:44] manifest because he thought it
[53:47] and
[53:48] part of the things that
[53:51] when i was talking this morning
[53:53] is that i believe that god has a plan
[53:57] and
[53:58] and uh
[54:00] and i'm a builder and and uh we've we
[54:03] had the privilege of building many
[54:06] things and remodeling many things and
[54:09] and and i've uh i've been on many jobs
[54:12] i've been supervisors of jobs and
[54:15] charge of all the electrical different
[54:18] things in my
[54:19] uh
[54:20] the the years that i've
[54:22] been working and i remember one thing
[54:25] that we always wanted to do is
[54:28] we we wanted to see the plan
[54:31] you know um a lot of times we'll come to
[54:34] the brothers will get together to work
[54:36] and somebody will walk up to me and they
[54:38] say what's the plan
[54:40] what's the plan
[54:41] well
[54:42] uh that's what i want to do is i want to
[54:44] see the blueprint
[54:47] and it'll okay and you know you just
[54:49] don't look at the blueprint somebody
[54:51] just doesn't hold them up and say well
[54:54] here's the blueprints
[54:56] does anybody want to see the blueprints
[54:58] well just come to me and i will hold up
[55:00] a piece of paper and they're all rolled
[55:02] up about this big about that big around
[55:05] and also here's the blueprints and you
[55:07] could say well i've seen the blueprints
[55:10] but you got to study the blueprints
[55:14] because in studying the blueprints
[55:17] you see the
[55:18] plan you you see the the plan of what
[55:23] what has been
[55:24] planned out
[55:26] all the way from all this dirt that
[55:28] you're seeing out there
[55:30] all that's planned out every every
[55:33] height
[55:34] of everything is measured off the
[55:37] satellite at the so many degrees of sea
[55:41] level
[55:43] 612.3
[55:45] uh
[55:46] there's a mark out here of of our
[55:49] building it's like 6.3
[55:52] that's 613.3
[55:55] above sea level
[55:57] and our whole lot out here is all graded
[56:00] by the level of the sea
[56:03] and you say why because the sea is the
[56:05] most level thing
[56:07] there is
[56:08] now it might be tossed in turns in waves
[56:12] and everything but that's not cause but
[56:15] when everything settles down and all the
[56:18] winds are blown and and all the trials
[56:22] and all the storms and everything are
[56:25] gone
[56:26] that sea will lay flat
[56:28] and there's nothing flatter
[56:32] all level
[56:34] is leveled
[56:35] by the sea
[56:37] because those of us that know that have
[56:39] been a construction water always goes to
[56:42] the
[56:42] lowest place and then when it hits the
[56:45] lowest place
[56:47] if there's any place higher
[56:50] it'll level itself out
[56:52] it'll find till all the water in all the
[56:55] places
[56:56] everywhere is all the same level
[57:00] if you build up a dam you have to raise
[57:03] it higher than the level of the water
[57:06] then that water will seek the next
[57:08] opening the next opening the next height
[57:11] the next place it'll wind its way from
[57:14] the high places to the low places
[57:17] until it's all
[57:19] level
[57:21] and you know and i got to thinking about
[57:22] brother george in this level you know he
[57:25] just
[57:27] he wants everything balanced
[57:30] and that's the way it is with god all
[57:32] his word is level
[57:34] it's balanced
[57:36] it can be built on
[57:40] it can be built on
[57:42] that's the thing about it and and as we
[57:45] have this plan out here we have to have
[57:47] certain places higher than other places
[57:50] because we've got to get the higher so
[57:52] the water will seek that that place out
[57:56] there that it'll become level and it'll
[57:58] come off our ground but everything that
[58:01] is precision
[58:03] and and laid out
[58:05] and and part of this beautiful part of
[58:08] getting away
[58:09] with god and getting alone with god it
[58:12] allows you to make contact with the plan
[58:14] of god for your life
[58:17] and i don't mean your carnal life
[58:20] and i tried to make that a little bit
[58:22] clearer this morning
[58:24] of course you'd always like to do a
[58:26] better job than you do but
[58:29] but there the the when we talk about the
[58:33] will of god in our life and the plan of
[58:36] god in our life it isn't the plan for
[58:39] this guy
[58:41] it's the plan for this inside person
[58:44] amen when he put it in motion and he
[58:46] thought
[58:47] and and one of the greatest examples of
[58:50] that to me is is
[58:52] is both moses and paul
[58:55] you know paul was out doing his thing
[58:57] and all of a sudden the lord knocks him
[58:59] up and says paul
[59:01] it's hard to kick against the prick
[59:04] you know
[59:06] he said and he says who are you i'm lord
[59:08] he says i'm going to show you
[59:10] what things you're going to suffer for
[59:12] my name's sake you're going to take this
[59:15] gospel to the gentiles now here's
[59:17] somebody that had a completely something
[59:19] different going on
[59:21] i mean you talk about a 360.
[59:25] it's really a 180 but we always called
[59:28] it a 360 growing up
[59:30] another about face a complete reverse a
[59:33] complete change of directions it's
[59:36] because he came in contact
[59:39] with
[59:40] the plan of god
[59:42] for his life
[59:44] and the places paul did and the things
[59:46] that he did he could never imagine those
[59:51] he would have never dreamed he would
[59:53] have been on a
[59:54] ship
[59:56] you know and the storms would rise out
[59:58] he never dreamed the places that he
[1:00:00] would be the prisons the things he would
[1:00:03] suffer the power and miracles he would
[1:00:05] see the homes that he went into the
[1:00:08] church that was built at ephesus and and
[1:00:11] and all the churches corinthians and
[1:00:14] even the church in rome and all the
[1:00:16] things that were possible
[1:00:18] because he entered in to the plan of god
[1:00:22] and i believe that we're promised that a
[1:00:25] book of acts will follow this bride
[1:00:28] a book that that she will write a book
[1:00:31] of acts
[1:00:33] and and the the and we know it's not our
[1:00:36] acts it's the acts of the holy spirit
[1:00:40] it's god using and the scripture says
[1:00:43] that he departs gifts
[1:00:45] to everyone and we're talking this
[1:00:48] morning about that when god can use the
[1:00:50] gift
[1:00:52] that he placed in you
[1:00:54] not not us always using the his gift but
[1:00:58] god using the gift that he placed enough
[1:01:02] for his kingdom and the real key to that
[1:01:05] is that getting alone
[1:01:07] and that getting out on the log
[1:01:11] and
[1:01:11] sitting there and thinking it over and
[1:01:14] even beginning to wonder what are the
[1:01:17] possibilities of the things that you can
[1:01:20] do for the kingdom of god
[1:01:25] could god use you
[1:01:28] i believe he can
[1:01:31] amen i believe he can do exceedingly and
[1:01:35] abundantly
[1:01:36] above that which you or i
[1:01:40] could even ask or think
[1:01:42] i believe you could go beyond
[1:01:45] what we perceive
[1:01:47] as limitations
[1:01:49] i i i honestly believe that
[1:01:53] that we're just starting to see him and
[1:01:55] we have seen
[1:01:57] and i believe that god has been with us
[1:02:00] but i believe there's a different
[1:02:01] manifestation
[1:02:03] that that he wants because we've
[1:02:06] glorified him
[1:02:08] i believe like any husband
[1:02:10] and wife relationship i believe that he
[1:02:13] wants her to be a partake of all his
[1:02:16] glory
[1:02:17] he wants to share himself and the things
[1:02:19] that he does and that's why he said the
[1:02:22] works that i do you shall do also
[1:02:25] and and what did he do he came in
[1:02:28] contact
[1:02:29] with the plan of god
[1:02:31] and and we can always come up with the
[1:02:33] reason
[1:02:35] why we can't
[1:02:37] but i honestly say this with all my
[1:02:39] heart because it's always something
[1:02:41] that's really been burdened on my heart
[1:02:44] is is that that spirit of nicola atheism
[1:02:48] took that away from the people
[1:02:50] and
[1:02:51] it wasn't the preachers that caused
[1:02:53] nickelodeonism
[1:02:54] nickelodeon means a conquered laity
[1:02:58] it was the people giving up
[1:03:01] their plan
[1:03:04] and allowing people to form plans for
[1:03:07] their life
[1:03:10] and
[1:03:11] and i hope you can take it individual
[1:03:14] because so many people i hear it over
[1:03:16] and over again they fight depression
[1:03:19] they they fight uh
[1:03:21] the the spirit of self-esteem
[1:03:24] that they they fight such those negative
[1:03:27] things and the prophet of god said never
[1:03:30] have a negative thought he says get
[1:03:31] those negative thoughts
[1:03:33] out of your head
[1:03:35] but if if you if you'll just sit back
[1:03:38] and consider the source i i like that
[1:03:41] little saying i i i liked it when i when
[1:03:45] i saw the first time i saw it was on a
[1:03:48] little kid
[1:03:49] and
[1:03:50] it was one of those bracelets that says
[1:03:52] god don't make junk
[1:03:55] you know
[1:03:56] and i saw it on one guy that i saw and
[1:04:00] he had and i said yeah that's right i
[1:04:02] said god don't make junk but i'm not so
[1:04:05] sure
[1:04:05] that he made you
[1:04:08] you know something else has made you
[1:04:09] what you are now
[1:04:11] so if you get back to god
[1:04:14] you know what i mean that that's when
[1:04:16] things come together so i want to
[1:04:18] encourage you
[1:04:20] to realize and take it seriously
[1:04:24] that no matter how old you are
[1:04:27] now we teach our kids stuff
[1:04:30] in
[1:04:31] third and fourth and fifth grade now
[1:04:34] that
[1:04:35] is just unheard of
[1:04:37] you know what i'm saying your kids come
[1:04:39] home with math and reading assignments
[1:04:42] that and and homework that i don't know
[1:04:45] if most of the adults can do don't ask
[1:04:48] grandpa to help with your homework
[1:04:49] that's for sure
[1:04:53] you know what i mean
[1:04:56] but
[1:04:57] if if
[1:04:58] they can do that
[1:05:00] right
[1:05:01] and the world
[1:05:03] is training people
[1:05:05] they actually sit back and they look at
[1:05:08] things and they say
[1:05:10] we don't have
[1:05:11] enough
[1:05:13] doctors
[1:05:15] and then they go to schools and they do
[1:05:17] aptitude tests and they find out how
[1:05:20] many people can be doctors
[1:05:22] and then they take your score and they
[1:05:25] give it to a counselor and the counselor
[1:05:27] brings you in
[1:05:29] and says oh have you might be considered
[1:05:32] a degree in the medical field
[1:05:35] they're actually doing stuff like that
[1:05:38] you might think that you're freer
[1:05:41] than you really are
[1:05:43] but they are socially engineering this
[1:05:47] country
[1:05:51] and where do you think the social
[1:05:52] engineering's starting
[1:05:55] is starting in grade schools
[1:05:58] you know if
[1:06:01] it's starting and teaching there's
[1:06:03] differences between colors the skins
[1:06:05] there's differences between things
[1:06:08] there's all these different things there
[1:06:10] is no difference in any man we are all
[1:06:14] born sinners
[1:06:18] i never read the bible and found a
[1:06:20] yellow sin
[1:06:21] a red sin
[1:06:23] a green sin a white sin a black sin you
[1:06:27] know sin is sin
[1:06:29] i don't care where it is and god's a
[1:06:32] healer he didn't die for this group or
[1:06:35] that group or that group and so if if
[1:06:39] satan
[1:06:41] is socially
[1:06:43] engineering
[1:06:46] do you understand what i mean by social
[1:06:47] engineering they teach certain things
[1:06:50] they direct certain things they present
[1:06:52] certain things they have different types
[1:06:55] of school so that they can get society
[1:06:58] to work the way that they feel it could
[1:07:01] work well if satan is a perverter
[1:07:06] then god doesn't social engineer god
[1:07:09] spiritually engineers he's the creator
[1:07:12] of heaven and earth and he's departed in
[1:07:15] you
[1:07:16] certain gifts certain attributes certain
[1:07:20] things that are unique to you alone
[1:07:24] that he wants to use to bring to pass
[1:07:28] his will
[1:07:30] his purpose and his accomplishment and
[1:07:33] he wants us to be a part of it and so
[1:07:36] he's growing us to a place of maturity
[1:07:40] building up our faith growing in faith
[1:07:43] so we can finally come to the place in
[1:07:45] life to realize that that that god never
[1:07:48] intended us just to kind of walk in
[1:07:51] groping darkness hoping one day that we
[1:07:54] find our way but but he's actually sent
[1:07:58] to us in this day a pillar of fire
[1:08:03] the same pillar of fire that led the
[1:08:05] children of israel
[1:08:07] where he took them out of the land and
[1:08:09] led him across the desert and in and
[1:08:12] built the country and
[1:08:13] and laid down the laws and did what he
[1:08:15] had to do in in order that he could
[1:08:18] manifest to christ
[1:08:21] and then that the same lord went out and
[1:08:23] sent the spirit and the spirit went into
[1:08:25] the ground and now it's come up through
[1:08:27] justification sanctification and it's
[1:08:30] entering into maturity where it actually
[1:08:33] it's in that maturity which is the word
[1:08:35] of god the s-o-n and that seed now comes
[1:08:39] back into the full life and the full
[1:08:42] purpose for which that it was planted
[1:08:45] for
[1:08:49] now
[1:08:50] that's not the church
[1:08:53] that's the individual
[1:08:55] what makes you a church is your loved
[1:08:57] one for your other
[1:08:59] what makes you a church is not the
[1:09:00] doctrine we follow it's the love that
[1:09:03] you have one for another and the care
[1:09:05] that you have one for another
[1:09:07] and the desire in your heart to serve
[1:09:09] one another and because even the
[1:09:12] scripture teaches us that charity starts
[1:09:14] at the house of god
[1:09:17] and so if all of us we want to move up
[1:09:20] together so there's things we've got to
[1:09:22] do we've got to apply the token to our
[1:09:24] life
[1:09:26] and your young people i'm real proud of
[1:09:27] you you've you've testified you've went
[1:09:30] better to clean things up in your life
[1:09:32] to get those things out of your life you
[1:09:34] want to be delivered you want the holy
[1:09:37] ghost you want that
[1:09:38] that third person brought to life a lot
[1:09:41] of people can be anointed with the holy
[1:09:43] spirit but only the elect can have the
[1:09:46] third man resurrected
[1:09:51] okay and then that person starts to find
[1:09:53] the will of god and moves in and
[1:09:55] fulfilling a purpose you want to see god
[1:09:58] move
[1:09:59] where it's not one guy moving
[1:10:02] but he's got a many member body all
[1:10:05] carrying out oh what's that music going
[1:10:08] to be what's that symphony going to be
[1:10:10] you know what that symphony is going to
[1:10:12] be it's going to be he's the same
[1:10:14] yesterday today and forever he lives
[1:10:16] what he did
[1:10:18] he's doing today the works that he did
[1:10:21] he's now doing through his bride so
[1:10:24] let's keep pressing the mark let's do
[1:10:26] our part
[1:10:27] in praying for service uh you're maybe
[1:10:30] at church a few hours every week we come
[1:10:34] to a few services together but i
[1:10:36] certainly believe that we can take it
[1:10:40] to a much higher level
[1:10:43] but it's i can't do it
[1:10:45] you understand
[1:10:47] each of you has got to take yourself
[1:10:51] to a higher level
[1:10:52] and if you keep pursuing that i believe
[1:10:54] it'll be marvelous so let's have our
[1:10:57] communion the brothers go get the bread
[1:11:00] and the wine level let's stand together
[1:11:02] and
[1:11:06] turn for our communion reading uh this
[1:11:08] time
[1:11:10] so we don't feel it's just one account
[1:11:12] in the scriptures
[1:11:14] over to matthew the 26th chapter
[1:11:21] and i'll just read a little bit of the
[1:11:23] story here starting at the 26th
[1:11:26] the 20th verse of the 26th chapter
[1:11:30] of matthew
[1:11:35] and the 19th well that's just like the
[1:11:36] 18th first because it's such a good
[1:11:38] story and he said go into the city the
[1:11:42] 18th verse the 26th chapter of matthew
[1:11:45] and he said go into the city to such a
[1:11:48] man
[1:11:49] and say unto him
[1:11:51] the master saith my time is at hand
[1:11:55] i will keep the passover at thy house
[1:11:58] with my disciples
[1:12:01] and the disciple and the disciples did
[1:12:04] as jesus had appointed them
[1:12:07] and they made ready the passover
[1:12:10] and when the evil was come
[1:12:13] he sat down
[1:12:14] with the twelve
[1:12:16] and as they did eat he said verily i say
[1:12:20] unto you that one of you should betray
[1:12:23] me
[1:12:24] and they were exceedingly sorrowful and
[1:12:27] begin every one of them to say unto him
[1:12:30] lord is it i
[1:12:32] and he answered and said he that dippeth
[1:12:35] his hand with me in the dish the same
[1:12:38] shall betray me
[1:12:41] the son of man
[1:12:42] goeth as it is written of him
[1:12:46] but woe unto the man by whom the son of
[1:12:49] man is betrayed
[1:12:52] it had been good for that man if he had
[1:12:55] not been born
[1:12:57] then jesus which betrayed him answered
[1:13:00] and said master is it i
[1:13:03] and he said unto him thou hath
[1:13:07] said
[1:13:09] and as they were eating jesus took bread
[1:13:13] and blessed it
[1:13:15] and break it
[1:13:17] and gave it to the disciples and said
[1:13:20] take eat
[1:13:22] this is my body
[1:13:24] and he took the cup
[1:13:26] and gave thanks
[1:13:28] and gave it to them saying drink ye
[1:13:32] all of it
[1:13:33] for this is my blood of the new
[1:13:36] testament which is shed for many
[1:13:39] for the remission of sins
[1:13:41] but i send you i will not drink neither
[1:13:45] forth of this fruit of the vine until
[1:13:48] that day
[1:13:49] when i drink it
[1:13:51] it knew
[1:13:52] with you in my father's kingdom
[1:13:56] amen aren't you glad you're in the
[1:13:58] kingdom of god amen let's bow our heads
[1:14:01] in prayer
[1:14:11] our gracious
[1:14:13] wonderful heavenly father
[1:14:16] lord it's our time of communion
[1:14:19] lord in our time of communion is a time
[1:14:21] of reflection
[1:14:24] just like our prophet said would like to
[1:14:26] go out and turn off the engine and
[1:14:30] just walk out and sit on the log and
[1:14:32] just think things over get alone
[1:14:36] father this is a time when
[1:14:38] we can measure ourselves against the
[1:14:41] word
[1:14:42] we can look at our lives and
[1:14:45] we can see if there's anything within us
[1:14:48] that needs repentance to make right
[1:14:51] if we have any thoughts towards a
[1:14:53] brother or sister that is not correct
[1:14:57] and not right or
[1:14:59] whether we've gossiped or
[1:15:02] whether we've had
[1:15:03] just
[1:15:05] a spirit that looks more like a cactus
[1:15:08] than a lily
[1:15:11] lord so we we take this time
[1:15:14] as a time of reflection
[1:15:17] not just a ceremony
[1:15:19] but lord is a time of communion
[1:15:23] it's a time of remembrance of the
[1:15:25] sacrifice that you pay
[1:15:28] it's a time of the blood that remitted
[1:15:30] our sins and the stripes that healed us
[1:15:34] and the bread that represents the bread
[1:15:36] of life the words of life that we can
[1:15:40] live by
[1:15:41] father is just a time that we stop
[1:15:45] and
[1:15:48] realize what's important
[1:15:52] and we realize father that if we seek
[1:15:55] first the kingdom of god
[1:15:59] all else will be added unto us
[1:16:02] so fathers we take this time of
[1:16:04] communion this time of reflection
[1:16:07] this time of self-examination
[1:16:10] this time of purposing to make things
[1:16:13] right in our life
[1:16:15] father we we take this time to
[1:16:19] come up higher to
[1:16:21] clean our house to find our coin to
[1:16:25] to sell our fields for the buried
[1:16:28] treasure
[1:16:29] we take this time father to
[1:16:33] dedicate our thoughts to you
[1:16:36] with the great desire that we could be
[1:16:39] a more profitable servant
[1:16:41] we ask you to bless this to us now
[1:16:45] in jesus name we pray heavenly father we
[1:16:48] take this bread that is broken
[1:16:52] representing a many-membered body
[1:16:55] father and we
[1:16:58] that that word has been departed to each
[1:17:00] of us in gifts and then measure
[1:17:04] and father we thank you for it
[1:17:06] we thank you for what you did at calvary
[1:17:10] oh god i would hate to be groping in the
[1:17:13] darkness of the world
[1:17:15] not knowing what my end would be
[1:17:18] but your goodness through this bread of
[1:17:20] life your word
[1:17:23] which you are meet indeed
[1:17:26] father has opened our eyes that we can
[1:17:29] see that there's soon
[1:17:30] a time of departing
[1:17:32] and a kingdom that's waiting for us
[1:17:36] we ask you to bless it to us
[1:17:38] heavenly father this wine father
[1:17:41] that we know as we've been taught is the
[1:17:44] representation of your blood
[1:17:47] and that the life is in the blood
[1:17:50] and the life spilled out on the ground
[1:17:52] father to re show us that even this
[1:17:55] world
[1:17:56] would be redeemed again
[1:17:58] and made new father and recreated back
[1:18:01] to its original place and purpose
[1:18:04] and heavenly father this blood also is
[1:18:07] life
[1:18:08] for the life is in the blood
[1:18:10] and that that life can return back upon
[1:18:12] the believer
[1:18:14] that wine also represents the
[1:18:16] stimulation of that life returning onto
[1:18:19] a believer
[1:18:20] father that they might carry out your
[1:18:22] plan
[1:18:23] in their life father may this communion
[1:18:26] heal us
[1:18:28] raise us to a higher level
[1:18:30] make us closer to you
[1:18:32] for we ask it tonight in jesus precious
[1:18:36] name we pray
[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:48] god bless you may be seated

[1:35:38] chapter the first verse
[1:35:41] now before the feast of the passover
[1:35:43] when jesus knew
[1:35:45] that his hour was come
[1:35:48] that he should depart out of this world
[1:35:51] unto the father
[1:35:53] having loved his own which were in the
[1:35:56] world
[1:35:57] he loved them unto the end
[1:36:01] and supper being ended
[1:36:03] the devil having now put it into the
[1:36:06] heart
[1:36:07] of judas iscariot simon's son to betray
[1:36:11] him
[1:36:12] jesus knowing that the father hath given
[1:36:16] all things into his hands
[1:36:18] and that he was come from god and went
[1:36:22] to god
[1:36:23] he raised us from supper
[1:36:25] and laid aside his garment and took a
[1:36:28] towel and girdeth himself
[1:36:30] and after that he poured water into a
[1:36:33] basin
[1:36:34] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[1:36:37] to wipe them
[1:36:39] with catal wherewith he was girded
[1:36:43] then cometh he to simon peter
[1:36:46] and peter said unto him lord dost doubt
[1:36:49] wash my feet
[1:36:51] jesus answered and said unto him
[1:36:55] what i do thou knoweth not now but thou
[1:36:59] shalt know hereafter
[1:37:02] peter said unto him thou shalt never
[1:37:05] wash my feet
[1:37:07] jesus answered him if i wash thee not
[1:37:10] doubt hath no part with me
[1:37:13] simon peter said unto him lord not my
[1:37:16] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:37:21] jesus said to him he that is washed
[1:37:24] needeth not to save to wash his feet
[1:37:28] but is clean every with and ye are clean
[1:37:33] but not all
[1:37:34] for he knew who should betray him
[1:37:37] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[1:37:41] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:37:44] had taken his garment and was set down
[1:37:46] again he said unto them
[1:37:49] know you what i have done to you
[1:37:52] you call me master and lord
[1:37:56] and
[1:37:56] ye say well
[1:37:58] for so i am
[1:38:00] if i then your lord and master have
[1:38:03] washed your feet
[1:38:05] ye also ought to wash one another's feet
[1:38:08] for i have given you an example that you
[1:38:11] should do as i have done to you
[1:38:14] verily verily i say unto you
[1:38:16] the servant is not greater than his lord
[1:38:20] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:38:23] that sent him if you know these things
[1:38:26] happy are ye if ye do them amen that is
[1:38:31] a promise
[1:38:33] i can say that's thus saith the lord
[1:38:37] amen you can't say thus saith the lord
[1:38:39] unless what it is the say of the lord
[1:38:42] and he said if we would do this
[1:38:45] if we would have this attitude one
[1:38:47] towards another
[1:38:48] if we would humble ourselves and love
[1:38:50] one another even to the place that we'd
[1:38:53] wash one another's feet brother branham
[1:38:55] explained that scripture one place he
[1:38:58] said he knew brother brahms explaining
[1:39:01] the scripture
[1:39:02] what i do is not now thou knowest not
[1:39:05] but here no after he said because jesus
[1:39:07] knew it would come the time that men
[1:39:10] would no longer kneel down
[1:39:12] and i believe he said in the dirt to
[1:39:14] lead somebody
[1:39:16] to the lord
[1:39:19] and that's how humble you have to get
[1:39:21] to lead someone to the lord is to just
[1:39:24] get down right down to where their feet
[1:39:27] need washing and be their servant and if
[1:39:30] we can be like that you'll be happy you
[1:39:32] won't be happy wash one another's feet
[1:39:35] god bless you we'll be back for his
[1:39:37] worship amen if you have to go after
[1:39:40] foot washing feel free to go
[1:39:42] if you have to go now we understand so
[1:39:45] god richly bless you as we have foot
[1:39:47] washing
