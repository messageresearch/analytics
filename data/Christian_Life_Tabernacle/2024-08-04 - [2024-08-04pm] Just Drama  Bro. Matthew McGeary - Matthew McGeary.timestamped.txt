[43:47] good I have been
[43:50] blessed let's just go before him Lord
[43:54] truly we are a blessed people more than
[43:57] we could ever express or
[43:59] say we do our best Lord to use words
[44:05] to praise you and to tell you how much
[44:08] you mean to us
[44:10] Lord something in our heart
[44:13] longs to step over into eternity where
[44:17] we'll have a new body and be able to
[44:20] look upon your face
[44:23] and be able to express ourselves in a
[44:26] greater way
[44:28] we'll have all eternity to do with no
[44:30] distractions and the cares of the LI
[44:33] this life all
[44:35] gone but Lord while we're on this
[44:40] side acting out your great plan Lord we
[44:44] want to do our best to tell you that we
[44:46] love
[44:46] you not just tell you Lord with words
[44:49] but we want to tell you with our actions
[44:52] Lord we want to show you how much you
[44:55] mean to us Lord by the way we live our
[44:57] day and Lord when things get
[45:01] hard we'll be able to conduct oursel
[45:04] with joy in the midst of the trial
[45:07] knowing that Lord you've left a
[45:09] measuring of suffering for your
[45:11] people that we might get that Christlike
[45:14] character and when we go through the
[45:17] trial with
[45:18] joy it's pleasing to you Lord and Lord
[45:22] we all
[45:24] just I believe in one Accord would want
[45:27] more of that Christlike
[45:29] nature to be able to fulfill your word
[45:32] and to manifest your word to be able to
[45:35] express a greater love to you that you
[45:37] so richly deserve Lord we know it's in
[45:41] times like these in the cool of the
[45:42] evening that you would come by our way
[45:44] and minister to our heart even in a
[45:47] communion service Lord so we're just
[45:49] surrendering to you Lord just needful
[45:52] that you'd come once again and move
[45:53] amongst your people Lord that you would
[45:56] have the pre minutes we surrender to you
[45:59] now Lord and commit all things into thy
[46:00] wonderful hands the Lord Jesus Christ we
[46:04] pray amen if you have your bibles if
[46:06] you'll turn in uh Romans chapter 4 um
[46:09] Brother David will be out uh soon uh
[46:12] he's just there in the office but um
[46:16] we'll just look to the word and
[46:19] see uh what the Lord might be able to
[46:22] bring to us uh for a moment and uh
[46:29] we're just trusting in Him
[46:31] amen we're just trusting in Him
[46:34] amen we're just trusting in Him amen oh
[46:38] my now that's sounding more like
[46:40] it uh Romans 4 and verse uh
[46:50] 19 and being not weak in faith he
[46:53] considered not his own body now dead
[46:56] when he was about 100 years old neither
[46:58] yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he
[47:01] staggered not at the
[47:04] promise of God through
[47:07] unbelief but was strong in
[47:10] faith giving
[47:12] glory to God and being fully
[47:17] persuaded that what he had
[47:19] promised he was able also to perform
[47:24] amen you may be seated on also just turn
[47:27] over into Romans chap
[47:32] 12 and we'll read verse
[47:39] two Romans
[47:41] 12 and verse two would read like
[47:44] this as we heard this morning and be not
[47:47] conformed to this
[47:49] world but be ye transformed by the
[47:53] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[47:56] what is that good and
[47:59] acceptable and perfect will of God
[48:04] brother brandom would say in
[48:07] Shalom preached this 1964 January 19th I
[48:11] believe he also preached it on the 12th
[48:13] he says his word is just like a great
[48:17] Symphony how many of you have ever heard
[48:19] a symphony well everybody has now
[48:22] remember symphony is when music is
[48:24] played in a drama
[48:27] I think I have that right a symphony
[48:29] like Peter and the Wolf you remember
[48:31] that that old Story how they they used
[48:32] to I've heard that how they take the
[48:34] drums and make the little woodpecker
[48:37] pecking and Peter going out and growling
[48:40] of the wolf and tooting of the horns a
[48:43] symphony now if you don't understand a
[48:46] symphony it's a big bunch of Racket to
[48:49] you if you don't understand it you've
[48:52] got to understand what it is it's all
[48:56] done by signs and
[48:59] motions but it acts out a drama in this
[49:03] Symphony now notice the only one that
[49:06] understands a symphony is the
[49:09] composer and those who are interested
[49:12] interesting in knowing it knows its
[49:15] changes knows what takes place I like
[49:19] how he even points out that the only
[49:21] people that really know what's going on
[49:22] are those that are interested in knowing
[49:25] and as he's typing this to God's word I
[49:28] believe there's a people on the Earth
[49:30] that are interested in what God's Great
[49:33] drama is and what the Sheep music would
[49:36] say what the great conductor is uh
[49:39] telling us to do he says the composer
[49:41] knows every move from the end to the
[49:45] beginning from the beginning to the end
[49:47] did you know that the one who wrote it
[49:50] up he composes this he knows every
[49:53] little Junction if he knows every
[49:55] Junction so does the director have to do
[49:57] to direct it now how you going to twist
[50:00] your Creed in that one little miscue of
[50:04] that stick that sign one little Miss
[50:06] sign at a junction would throw the whole
[50:09] Orchestra off throw the whole Symphony
[50:12] out now you know that's true the
[50:14] composer and director has to be in the
[50:19] same spirit and I would say that as the
[50:22] composer and the director would be in
[50:25] the same Spirit we as the body of Christ
[50:28] as as the bride we want to be in the
[50:30] same Spirit we want to be in the same
[50:32] mind we want to we want to be ready and
[50:35] anticipation we want to know our part we
[50:37] want to we want to be in harmony we want
[50:40] to be in the Rhythm we want to be
[50:41] looking for the sign and for the motion
[50:43] h of when that would would would be your
[50:45] turn or you you know it's like okay
[50:47] you're waiting for your part you have a
[50:49] position you have a Ministry something
[50:51] that you're acting out a portion uh that
[50:53] you're playing in it he says that's why
[50:55] the minister and the the word of God
[50:57] God's Great Symphony he has been playing
[51:00] since the dawn of time the minister at
[51:02] the word has to not look over here and
[51:04] say I I believe this ought to be you
[51:06] ought to make it this way he has got to
[51:09] go the way the Sheep music says take it
[51:12] that's the way the gospel has to be
[51:14] preached the way the word says take it
[51:17] you know if you throw a Creed in there
[51:20] you got the whole thing messed up it's
[51:24] got to go to make the drama
[51:27] just exactly
[51:30] right and just maybe the thought that is
[51:33] on my heart uh we'll just maybe see how
[51:36] the Lord might help us here um just
[51:40] drama I just want to speak to you this
[51:43] evening on just
[51:45] drama when you think of a drama you know
[51:47] drama is something that's acted out like
[51:50] a play or it it describes a situation
[51:53] you know uh something uh might come up
[51:56] something that's acted out and I I don't
[51:58] know about you but when when I was in
[52:00] the world you know we had people that
[52:02] they would call drama queens does
[52:03] anybody ever you ever heard of somebody
[52:05] labeled a drama queen it's like man
[52:07] they're just a drama queen it just seems
[52:10] like no matter uhh what happens they're
[52:12] always uh they're always trying to stir
[52:15] something up always trying to cause some
[52:16] trouble always trying to make something
[52:19] bigger than it usually than it really is
[52:21] and and you know you can have the most
[52:23] the most little thing happen and and
[52:26] this little instance happen and all a
[52:27] sudden it's just a bunch of drama and
[52:29] they're going around and telling this
[52:30] person and that person and this change
[52:32] in the atmosphere and all of a sudden it
[52:34] just seems like man everything's turned
[52:37] into a big drama something that would
[52:39] have just been so so little and really
[52:42] not that big of a deal all of a sudden
[52:43] it's like why why are we having this I
[52:45] mean I why are we having all this
[52:47] trouble I just I thought I thought we
[52:49] were just going to go out to eat I I
[52:51] thought we were just going to go over to
[52:52] so ando's house I I just thought we were
[52:54] going to go into the fellowship hall and
[52:56] practice a song special and all a sudden
[52:58] now we're we're we're arguing like the
[53:00] disciples who's the greatest amongst all
[53:01] of us you know it's like man my who's
[53:04] going to sing who's not going to sing
[53:05] who's going to play who's not and all of
[53:07] a sudden there's this this atmosphere
[53:08] and all this stuff well you want to tell
[53:10] you what uh drama can happen right in
[53:12] the church building right in the church
[53:14] house right in the the church the church
[53:17] family I I know these things ain't
[53:19] unfamiliar to you it can happen you the
[53:21] devil's always trying to stir things up
[53:23] it's like lightting a fuse and just get
[53:25] ready something you know something's
[53:27] about to happen you know when you when
[53:29] you light the fuse of a firecracker or
[53:31] firework or something like that just get
[53:33] ready you know you know something's
[53:34] about to
[53:35] happen has anybody ever done
[53:38] it well if you light a firework you you
[53:41] you you better know what you just
[53:44] did and then you better run for safety
[53:47] you you better know what you're doing
[53:48] you better know what you just lit some
[53:50] of those things do different things some
[53:52] of them fly up they're like a rocket and
[53:55] if and they got to have a stand or
[53:56] something and and all of a sudden some
[53:58] of us you better be careful you're
[53:59] lighting fuses you're saying things and
[54:01] doing things you don't realize you you
[54:03] know it's the little foxes that spoil
[54:05] the vine all a sudden you say something
[54:06] you get out of step of the Sheep music
[54:08] you think you're going to try to H uh uh
[54:10] do something just even like our our
[54:12] pastor mentioned this morning you know
[54:14] approaches everything you might have all
[54:16] the right intentions you might want to
[54:18] might want to help the situation but if
[54:19] you come up and you approach it at the
[54:21] wrong time and not the right way uh well
[54:24] you thought you were helping but you
[54:25] just made the drama lot bigger now now
[54:27] you just pulled into the mesh too and
[54:29] and now you feel like people are picking
[54:31] sides and everything's out of whack you
[54:32] wonder what in the world am I going to
[54:34] do I tell you you want know who the
[54:36] greatest drama queen of them all is is
[54:38] it's
[54:39] Satan yeah I don't mind calling a drama
[54:41] queen because he's just always trying to
[54:43] stir things up he's always trying to
[54:46] cause problem he's always trying to just
[54:48] get into your mind and and get into uh
[54:51] uh the the workings of the church in
[54:53] your day and he's just trying to to to
[54:55] distract you and get your eyes off of
[54:57] the sheet music and and before you know
[54:59] you're so worked up and you're out of
[55:01] rhythm and you got your eyes off the com
[55:03] the composer and now uh uh maybe the
[55:05] director the minister comes and he's
[55:07] preaching the word and and now you're
[55:09] indifferent towards him he's like well
[55:10] he's just preaching on me because he
[55:12] knows about the situation and and you're
[55:14] all flustered because that good old
[55:15] drama queen is trying to sew all these
[55:17] little seeds of doubt and seeds of
[55:19] explanation and this is why he's saying
[55:21] this is and this is why this is going on
[55:23] and all of a sudden before you know
[55:24] you're fearing and you're worrying in
[55:26] and you're losing your your purpose and
[55:28] then you're getting between two opinions
[55:30] and you know what happens when you get
[55:31] between two opinions you lose your
[55:33] reason and now you really you're trying
[55:35] to wonder well who's right or they right
[55:36] or them wrong and do I got to pick sides
[55:38] and and all of a sudden you're all
[55:39] flustered and don't even want to go to
[55:40] church
[55:43] anymore
[55:45] happens all because you didn't get the
[55:47] memo that we were all going to Jason's
[55:53] Deli it can happen that easy
[55:57] oh yeah de he the devil's
[55:59] crafty I didn't get invited to the baby
[56:02] shower uh oh I just lost my
[56:06] clip right oh that was rigged you can be
[56:10] a baby shower game like well they said
[56:12] it all up they were family they rigged
[56:13] it I'm not going to church on Sunday I'm
[56:15] out of
[56:18] here you know it's
[56:20] drama it it's it's a it's a bunch of
[56:22] drama and believe it or not there's a
[56:24] lot of drama that's going on in the
[56:25] church and we get caught up in
[56:27] it and and and it can be the smallest
[56:30] little things and it's like our whole
[56:33] world is going to fall
[56:36] apart it makes us feel all nervous and
[56:39] and situations and things that have
[56:41] taken place in the past and and roots of
[56:43] bitterness and these things can start to
[56:46] if you're not careful you know I I
[56:48] something I ministered on when we were
[56:50] um just in the meetings we were talking
[56:52] about uh the multiplication of the
[56:54] spirit brother Brandon would talk about
[56:55] how uh how cancer what it would do is it
[56:58] would attach itself to a bruised cell
[57:01] and he said what'll happen as it
[57:03] attaches itself to that bruised cell it
[57:05] starts to multiply and it starts to get
[57:08] bigger and bigger and bigger and it
[57:09] turns into a growth and all of a sudden
[57:12] he says but I'm not dealing with the
[57:14] growth in the natural in the body I'm
[57:15] dealing with the life behind the growth
[57:18] because it's the life behind that growth
[57:20] that becomes mment and it's starting to
[57:22] grow and grow and grow and get bigger
[57:25] and bigger what does it do it's suing
[57:26] out all the life out of you in the
[57:28] bloodstream and if something ain't done
[57:30] it'll eventually take your life and he
[57:31] would say that the doctor can come in
[57:33] there and he can cut it out but if he
[57:35] doesn't get all of it it'll grow
[57:38] back it'll it'll attach itself to
[57:41] situations and bitterness will do the
[57:42] same thing bitterness it'll take a
[57:45] situation where you were
[57:47] hurt your hand wasn't sh shaken or
[57:50] something happened or you weren't
[57:51] invited here or there or something was
[57:53] said and you've been offended and you've
[57:55] been hurt you've been bruised be very
[57:57] careful cuz a spirit will want to attach
[57:59] itself to that and all of a sudden it'll
[58:02] start to try to grow and it'll go from
[58:05] one situation to another and uh brother
[58:07] brandom I think it's profound he would
[58:09] start to talk about bitterness when he's
[58:11] preaching I believe Christ is the
[58:12] mystery of God revealed he takes time to
[58:14] say look don't let bitterness uh uh get
[58:17] into your life he said it'll drive it'll
[58:18] it'll drive the spirit of God right out
[58:20] of your life it'll drive it from this
[58:22] Tabernacle here it'll root down like a
[58:25] sickness like a cancer like a canker
[58:27] and'll start to drive its wedge down
[58:29] into every area of your life and before
[58:31] you know you wonder why am I so
[58:32] spiritually void why why does I why
[58:34] don't I feel the presence of God anymore
[58:36] it's because there's been something that
[58:38] has attached itself to your life it's
[58:40] another life form it isn't the life of
[58:42] Jesus Christ it's a cancer it's a canker
[58:45] that's trying to eat away at you and all
[58:47] from just a little
[58:51] drama maybe maybe situations right now
[58:54] are working through your mind maybe
[58:56] you're going through a drama maybe
[58:58] you're going through something right now
[59:00] look we we want to be vigilant we have
[59:02] to realize that it can be in the very
[59:04] small things that Satan is able to to to
[59:07] distract us and to discourage us and and
[59:10] be able to to just cause a stir in the
[59:13] home and and break up the atmosphere and
[59:15] before you know it uh you're wonder
[59:17] where is the presence of God why do I
[59:19] feel the way I I I'm feeling allwe CU
[59:21] it's just
[59:22] drama it's just drama
[59:26] is everybody
[59:29] tired ready you want to go to go to go
[59:31] you it's just
[59:32] drama you know it's just you know it's
[59:35] part of life it's it it's just that's
[59:37] just the way it is and you know maybe I
[59:40] could pack this in for another time
[59:42] we're just trying to be uh faithful to
[59:45] um you know the call of God just uh uh
[59:47] uh as the opportunity was afforded to us
[59:50] but maybe we can make a little progress
[59:52] into it if that would be all right
[59:58] I'd be happy to move right into
[1:00:02] communion but you know what we're we're
[1:00:05] we're in a
[1:00:06] drama and we got to play our
[1:00:08] part that's what I was maybe thinking
[1:00:11] how a little thought on my heart and and
[1:00:13] then uh you you get called into action
[1:00:16] you're like man that's just the way it
[1:00:18] is you know it's part of the
[1:00:19] drama I just got to act out my part
[1:00:23] praise the Lord we're all here we're all
[1:00:25] showed up for the
[1:00:27] drama and every single one of us has a
[1:00:29] part to
[1:00:31] play and sometimes we need to pick if
[1:00:33] we're going to play our part
[1:00:36] right you know you got a part to play
[1:00:38] When the Sheep music calls for it are
[1:00:39] you just going to sit back and like you
[1:00:40] know what I'm GNA sit this one
[1:00:44] out hey you might you might have had
[1:00:46] some other drama happening that's making
[1:00:48] you feel that way you know what I don't
[1:00:49] want to I don't want to sing this song
[1:00:51] because they don't sing it fast
[1:00:53] enough I like it when they play it in
[1:00:56] the key of G it's just right in my
[1:00:58] perfect so I'm just going to sit this
[1:01:00] one out I like it when brother so and so
[1:01:01] sings it oh my these things are juvenile
[1:01:05] but it gets right in the church house it
[1:01:07] gets right in our car it gets right in
[1:01:08] our work workplace you know it's it
[1:01:11] reminds me of drama I was thinking about
[1:01:13] it I when I was in junior high has
[1:01:15] anybody ever been in a drama
[1:01:17] club come on let's see a show of hands
[1:01:20] in here who's been in drama club we got
[1:01:22] one hey we got we got more in here all
[1:01:25] right drama club you know I don't know
[1:01:27] how how uh how how y'all did it but I
[1:01:31] mean drama club is where you you you get
[1:01:33] together it's a class and you act out
[1:01:35] certain plays or skits or or or you you
[1:01:38] do certain uh things and and I remember
[1:01:41] you know one time uh we you'd have to go
[1:01:43] to like uh they' have events at other
[1:01:46] schools and you'd come up with some some
[1:01:49] um something to act out or play and
[1:01:51] you'd go and one group would get out
[1:01:53] there and and they would act something
[1:01:54] out and then and then you know you had
[1:01:57] to get up there and act out your part
[1:01:58] and I remember one of my friend uh his
[1:02:01] name was Ricky and and uh we were we we
[1:02:04] were in drama club together and he he
[1:02:06] was a neighborhood friend lived down the
[1:02:07] street and and you know I I don't know
[1:02:10] how we we ever got the idea to do what
[1:02:13] we did but I tell you what it wasn't
[1:02:16] about when I was in front of everybody I
[1:02:19] had my hat on backwards my pants on
[1:02:22] backwards and my shirt on backwards and
[1:02:25] my drama was criss cross going to make
[1:02:27] you
[1:02:28] jump now that might be a little too old
[1:02:30] for some of y'all but I was acting out
[1:02:32] some wannab be rap group and I got in
[1:02:35] front of all them people and I'm with my
[1:02:37] friend Ricky I'm like what am I even
[1:02:40] doing
[1:02:41] here drama it was just drama a bunch of
[1:02:45] drama I know some of y'all are getting a
[1:02:47] vigil right now like are you kidding me
[1:02:49] I was a lot younger
[1:02:52] then but you know I remember there uh
[1:02:54] you know drama you got to act out a skit
[1:02:56] and one of the beneficial things about
[1:02:58] being there is I I actually saw a a a
[1:03:00] team act out a a skit and they called it
[1:03:03] the reverse omatic and you know we got
[1:03:06] back to school and everybody was
[1:03:07] brainstorming for a good idea and I
[1:03:09] thought hey I got an idea what about we
[1:03:13] do something like you know call it a
[1:03:14] reverse omatic and it was like you could
[1:03:16] change the situ you could just rewind
[1:03:18] the
[1:03:19] situation something bad happens you just
[1:03:22] you just rewind it and and and we had to
[1:03:24] act this thing out but you know you had
[1:03:26] to you had to plan it you had to get all
[1:03:28] the materials together you had to you
[1:03:30] know you had to pick the every person
[1:03:32] that was going to play the part okay
[1:03:34] well you're going to be the individual
[1:03:36] you'll walk in and this is going to
[1:03:37] happen and you'll trip and you'll fall
[1:03:39] and you'll lose everything and then
[1:03:40] they'll steal your money and then this
[1:03:41] person's over here standing with the
[1:03:43] reversomatic and then you you react all
[1:03:45] everything in backwards and slow motion
[1:03:48] trying to reverse everything but
[1:03:49] everybody had to know their part for it
[1:03:51] to
[1:03:52] work it was a drama
[1:03:55] trying to work towards something y'all
[1:03:57] get with me maybe we'll stand up and
[1:03:59] preach to
[1:04:02] you it's a big drama you had to act it
[1:04:05] out everybody had to play their part in
[1:04:09] this this drama and so just trying to uh
[1:04:12] get something that you can relate to
[1:04:14] maybe in the natural you know if if
[1:04:16] you've been in school or you you you've
[1:04:18] seen so even in work if you're going to
[1:04:20] if you're going to have a if you're
[1:04:22] going to put together a plan and work
[1:04:25] and everybody's going to play their part
[1:04:27] you get together and say well you're
[1:04:28] going to carry out this part of the job
[1:04:30] and you have a team and marketing and
[1:04:32] all these things it all has to go
[1:04:33] together and everybody's working towards
[1:04:35] one goal and one objective and in order
[1:04:37] for you to be successful everybody has
[1:04:39] to play their part or if I can say as we
[1:04:42] are looking at maybe from the the scenes
[1:04:44] of a drama you got to act it all out to
[1:04:46] be able to play the drama y'all with me
[1:04:50] all right and brother Brandon would say
[1:04:51] now if you don't understand a symphony
[1:04:53] just reading that back it's a big bunch
[1:04:55] of it to you if you don't understand it
[1:04:57] you've got to understand what it is it's
[1:04:59] all done by signs and motions but it
[1:05:02] acts out a drama in a symphony and maybe
[1:05:05] you know sometimes we feel like our life
[1:05:07] is just a big bunch of Racket you don't
[1:05:10] understand what's going on in your life
[1:05:11] and you're looking you know I just got
[1:05:13] to say look at the Sheep
[1:05:14] music if you don't understand what
[1:05:16] you're going through and what everything
[1:05:18] is about just look at the Sheep music
[1:05:19] just look start looking into the Bible
[1:05:21] say Lord I'm going through a hard time I
[1:05:23] remember one time a sister you know I
[1:05:25] believe she was she was needing work and
[1:05:26] so she read the book of
[1:05:31] J God Honors that type of
[1:05:35] faith it it it it sounds funny but I
[1:05:38] love it she she she said I need an
[1:05:40] answer from God she looked into the word
[1:05:42] and it spoke to her God loves that kind
[1:05:45] of childlike Faith all he does is wants
[1:05:47] you to look to him I love it when my
[1:05:49] kids they come up they'll ask some of
[1:05:51] the the most simplest things or or or
[1:05:54] they'll say some of the the the most uh
[1:05:56] wonderful things and something in your
[1:05:57] heart just like my that that's just
[1:05:59] wonderful I like that God wants you to
[1:06:02] look to him he wants you to say Lord I I
[1:06:04] I don't understand what all the racket
[1:06:06] is I I'm not I can't make sense of it it
[1:06:08] just sounds like a mess my whole life is
[1:06:11] like a mess I I don't understand why my
[1:06:13] family my health and all these things
[1:06:15] are happening and if you're not careful
[1:06:16] Satan will get in there he'll try to
[1:06:18] make you worry he'll try to make you
[1:06:20] have fear he'll try to get you to look
[1:06:21] at all the symptoms and before you know
[1:06:23] you're all worked up and you're saying
[1:06:25] things that aren't on the Sheep music
[1:06:27] just get back to the Sheep music if you
[1:06:29] want to make sense of everything that's
[1:06:31] going on listen to Malachi 45 listen to
[1:06:34] your pastor read pray look into your
[1:06:37] Bible and then God will start speaking
[1:06:39] in your heart and you can start to see
[1:06:41] how the pieces are playing and lining up
[1:06:43] and you realize oh okay God now I see
[1:06:46] what you're doing in my life there's a a
[1:06:48] drama something's taking place and
[1:06:49] you're acting it out in my life but when
[1:06:51] you get your eyes off of the word when
[1:06:53] you get your eyes off the composer when
[1:06:56] you get your eyes looking other places
[1:06:57] and you start listening to the drama and
[1:07:00] everything else out in the world all of
[1:07:01] a sudden you're confused and you don't
[1:07:03] know what's going on you wonder what
[1:07:04] it's all about you say oh my goodness
[1:07:06] I'm not going to make it I'm not going
[1:07:07] to go in the Rapture I no that's not
[1:07:10] what the Sheep music
[1:07:13] says let's look at the Sheep
[1:07:16] music now brother Brandon would say this
[1:07:18] in a glorified Jesus he preached it in
[1:07:20] 55 he says that's where God builds his
[1:07:24] church every time so we're just uh maybe
[1:07:27] where this quote is coming in just
[1:07:29] thinking of in a drama everybody has
[1:07:31] their their part to play right you know
[1:07:34] I don't care whatever it is so we're
[1:07:36] there brother brandham says this he says
[1:07:38] that's where God built his church every
[1:07:41] time the only place he can build it was
[1:07:43] upon the spiritual revealed truth of God
[1:07:47] job had it I want you to
[1:07:49] notice every man that ever has the
[1:07:53] spiritual revealed truth of the will of
[1:07:56] God makes preparation for the
[1:08:00] fulfilling now I think I played that
[1:08:02] over and over maybe 50
[1:08:06] times because I love how the prophet can
[1:08:10] just pack eternity into a
[1:08:12] sentence every man that ever has the
[1:08:15] spiritual revealed truth of the will of
[1:08:18] God makes preparation for the fulfilling
[1:08:23] that is what we need Church we need
[1:08:26] exactly what he's saying right there we
[1:08:29] need the spiritual revealed truth of the
[1:08:32] will of God and when you have that then
[1:08:36] you start to make preparations for the
[1:08:39] fulfilling of
[1:08:40] it when the Bible says and Abraham
[1:08:43] staggered not at the promises of God
[1:08:45] because he was fully persuaded Abraham
[1:08:48] was making preparations for the
[1:08:51] fulfilling he was getting the baby
[1:08:52] clothes he was putting the nursery
[1:08:54] together he was was he was making
[1:08:56] preparations for the promise because
[1:08:58] something had been revealed to him and
[1:09:01] so now he was going into action because
[1:09:03] he knew the promise was going to be
[1:09:06] fulfilled just like Noah when God spoke
[1:09:08] to him he said Noah it's going to rain
[1:09:10] he didn't just sit back and say well God
[1:09:12] said it's going to rain no but there was
[1:09:14] something that was revealed to Noah Noah
[1:09:17] knew he had a job to do and Noah went
[1:09:20] into preparation for the fil fulfilling
[1:09:22] of what had been spoken now I wonder as
[1:09:25] the individual sitting in the age that
[1:09:27] we're living in have we caught the
[1:09:29] Revelation that it's later than you
[1:09:32] think look at Israel look look at where
[1:09:35] we're at we're we're 60 plus years past
[1:09:38] the prophet going off the scene and
[1:09:40] we're speaking of the coming of the Lord
[1:09:42] and the change of our bodies and I
[1:09:44] wonder are we making preparation for the
[1:09:46] Fulfillment if we're not that we might
[1:09:49] just be lacking the spiritual revealed
[1:09:51] truth of his will for our life is the
[1:09:54] reason why we dible and Dabble and we go
[1:09:56] out into the things of the world and we
[1:09:58] entertain the things that we entertain
[1:10:00] is because maybe we're lacking a little
[1:10:02] bit of Revelation but if we can say God
[1:10:04] Quicken your word to me I need a greater
[1:10:07] revelation of the call of God upon my
[1:10:09] life and the part you want me to play CU
[1:10:11] I want to get into action Lord reveal
[1:10:14] this message to me in a greater way Lord
[1:10:16] I need the spiritual revealed truth of
[1:10:19] your will of your word Lord and I know
[1:10:22] when I receive that Revelation I will go
[1:10:24] into prep preparation for the fulfilling
[1:10:26] of that but without the Revelation you
[1:10:28] don't even know how to
[1:10:32] prepare you say you say somebody's
[1:10:35] getting already you know like what are
[1:10:36] you getting ready
[1:10:37] for I don't know I'm just getting
[1:10:40] ready well if you don't know what you're
[1:10:42] getting ready
[1:10:44] for you're not going to be
[1:10:47] prepared it's you you know I think it's
[1:10:49] interesting you go to the airport and it
[1:10:52] can be winter and you see people walk
[1:10:55] well you know people have lost their
[1:10:57] mind so
[1:10:58] maybe maybe it doesn't uh mean as much
[1:11:01] as it would maybe a few years ago but
[1:11:03] you're in the airport you see people are
[1:11:05] walking in shorts and flipflops and they
[1:11:07] got a t-shirt on you're like man it's
[1:11:09] it's 15 degrees outside but they're
[1:11:11] dressing for where they're going you see
[1:11:13] the gate they're sitting at and they're
[1:11:15] going to Florida they're they're going
[1:11:16] to some tropical place because they're
[1:11:19] prepared for their
[1:11:22] destination you know when we live here
[1:11:24] in the south and you got to be careful
[1:11:26] if you're going up to North Country you
[1:11:27] better check the
[1:11:29] weather you know it feels all good down
[1:11:31] here it's 70 80 degrees and so man you
[1:11:34] pack all light and everything you think
[1:11:36] man I'm just going to bring a carry on
[1:11:37] and you look at like oh my goodness it
[1:11:39] is 8 degrees in Lima Ohio we better
[1:11:43] bring some sweaters we better bring some
[1:11:44] jackets we better prepare ourselves for
[1:11:47] the destination that we're going we got
[1:11:49] to get prepared because once you get a
[1:11:51] revelation of what the weather's like
[1:11:53] what you start to make preparation for
[1:11:55] the fulfilling of what you're going to
[1:11:57] go into
[1:11:58] right so that's what we want a
[1:12:01] revelation we want every man that ever
[1:12:03] has spiritually revealed truth of the
[1:12:05] will of God makes preparation for the
[1:12:08] fulfilling we could you know we could
[1:12:10] for the sake of time we won't go into
[1:12:12] those things but you can start to think
[1:12:14] of all the characters down through the
[1:12:16] Bible that received a revelation from
[1:12:18] God it put him to into action to fulfill
[1:12:21] the promise that was given to him when
[1:12:24] Abel found out that God required a lamb
[1:12:28] Hallelujah he made sure that he got a
[1:12:31] lamb and he offered the proper sacrifice
[1:12:34] it took preparation to be able to offer
[1:12:37] the proper sacrifice but it had to be a
[1:12:40] revelation without the Revelation you
[1:12:42] would just be just as good as Cain
[1:12:45] trying to offer your good works and your
[1:12:47] ability to God as a pleasing sacrifice
[1:12:50] and that will never
[1:12:52] work you can't be good enough you can't
[1:12:55] offer enough works you can't offer
[1:12:57] enough to God to say oh I finally made
[1:13:00] it I finally bought myself salvation no
[1:13:03] you can't buy yourself salvation because
[1:13:06] salvation has already been
[1:13:11] purchased all you do is have to accept
[1:13:15] it now just skipping for uh just to try
[1:13:19] to uh move a little quicker just you
[1:13:22] could think of all the the types and
[1:13:24] things things you could go through and
[1:13:26] brother Brandon would make this
[1:13:27] statement in the unveiling of God he'd
[1:13:29] say what is it it's the same God all the
[1:13:31] time just changing his form in morphe he
[1:13:35] just changes it the great drama to him
[1:13:38] he's acting it
[1:13:40] out so God is just acting out a great
[1:13:45] drama you know that the children uh uh
[1:13:47] you think of Shadrach mesach and Abend
[1:13:49] too here it what looks like their
[1:13:51] greatest trial it looks like uh uh they
[1:13:55] got to lose their life they're saying
[1:13:57] look if you don't bow we're throwing you
[1:13:59] into the fiery furnace but I just was
[1:14:01] thinking on that here it is you know if
[1:14:04] anybody you like a drama or there's some
[1:14:06] type of show or something you like and
[1:14:08] you know has everything builds up to the
[1:14:10] best part right it's like that's what a
[1:14:13] drama is right everything's kind of
[1:14:14] building to this climactic uh uh place
[1:14:18] in the story and everything gets to the
[1:14:20] crescendo and and and it's right at the
[1:14:23] height of the climax oh my I tell you
[1:14:25] what the the the children of Israel I I
[1:14:28] wonder how they were feeling as they got
[1:14:29] closer and closer to the furnace but I
[1:14:32] can just see God sitting back there
[1:14:33] going this is my favorite
[1:14:36] part I I've been looking for this part
[1:14:38] in the drama and because their faith in
[1:14:42] God's word they say look if he say if he
[1:14:44] saves Us Praise the Lord if he does it
[1:14:46] for one thing we're not doing we're not
[1:14:47] getting off the Sheep
[1:14:50] music right I got to stay with the
[1:14:53] composer I don't care uh if it means my
[1:14:56] life I don't care if it means my
[1:14:58] finances I don't care if it means my
[1:15:00] family my job whatever it is I got to
[1:15:03] stay with the Sheep music I got to stay
[1:15:05] in harmony with the composer and the
[1:15:07] composer was sitting back and said
[1:15:08] that's it you're just acting out your
[1:15:11] part boys keep going keep acting it out
[1:15:14] and oh my as they got to that fiery
[1:15:16] furnace there was another man in the
[1:15:19] fire oh there was that climatical point
[1:15:21] where God came down himself in the trial
[1:15:24] in the time of of the
[1:15:26] fire what was it God was acting out his
[1:15:29] great
[1:15:31] drama and I love brother Brandon would
[1:15:33] say this in Jesus Christ the same
[1:15:35] yesterday today and forever he say look
[1:15:37] at him there at the grave when he prayed
[1:15:39] at Lazareth grave he said father I thank
[1:15:42] thee that thou Hast heard me
[1:15:44] already but for these that stand by I
[1:15:47] say it just acting out in drama what God
[1:15:52] had showed to him by Vision he said I do
[1:15:55] nothing except the father shows me first
[1:15:58] that was the faith that was delivered to
[1:16:01] the Saints did the Saints keep it
[1:16:07] certainly did the Saints keep it
[1:16:11] certainly look at Paul look at uh uh
[1:16:14] Peter they were being led by the spirit
[1:16:17] of God when Cornelius was was seeking
[1:16:21] God and and what did God do he come down
[1:16:23] in a dream and a vision to Peter and say
[1:16:26] look go down to the house of Cornelius
[1:16:27] there's there there's Gentiles there
[1:16:29] that are going to receive the baptism of
[1:16:31] the Holy Ghost what were they doing they
[1:16:32] were being led by the spirit of God God
[1:16:34] was revealing his will to him Peter at
[1:16:36] first was like how in the world Lord I I
[1:16:40] can't go down there he's like look don't
[1:16:42] call that that I've called clean don't
[1:16:44] call it dirty go go on down there and
[1:16:46] Minister the gospel to him they he
[1:16:48] wouldn't preach the gospel he said can
[1:16:49] we forbid these water these that have
[1:16:51] received the Holy Spirit like us right
[1:16:54] he was acting out that part of the drama
[1:16:56] then if they were acting it out if they
[1:16:57] kept it then God's doing the same thing
[1:16:59] for
[1:17:01] you then we got to act out our part we
[1:17:04] want to be led we want to have that type
[1:17:06] of revelation we want to see God moving
[1:17:08] in his people acting out his great
[1:17:12] drama we want to get into
[1:17:15] position do you know what your position
[1:17:18] is we know that's exactly what adoption
[1:17:19] is it's the placing of sons we all want
[1:17:21] to be in our position we want to be
[1:17:23] acting out our part we want to be uh uh
[1:17:25] right there ready in in the sheet music
[1:17:27] of the composer waiting for our queue
[1:17:30] waiting for our time waiting for the
[1:17:31] Lord to say all right son now it's your
[1:17:33] turn you move you speak you
[1:17:35] do if if we're not careful we get caught
[1:17:38] up in all the other cares of life and
[1:17:39] we're not even in our our
[1:17:42] position that's something I believe as a
[1:17:44] son and daughter of God we we want to be
[1:17:46] careful say Lord I always want to be
[1:17:49] ready go God's going to have his
[1:17:52] way and and I and I think of this this
[1:17:55] story it comes to me uh we're very
[1:17:57] familiar with it when that that the
[1:18:00] mother was with this old older mother
[1:18:02] was seeing this this young mother with a
[1:18:03] baby and and she just felt compelled I
[1:18:06] got to pray for this baby it's it's fuss
[1:18:08] and it's sick and and she kept uh uh
[1:18:11] putting it off and putting it off but
[1:18:12] she just felt the Lord just kept pushing
[1:18:14] her heart and she came up said look I if
[1:18:16] you'll excuse me I know you have a
[1:18:18] prayer card I know you're going to have
[1:18:19] brother Brandon pray for you but will
[1:18:21] you just let me pray just to satisfy my
[1:18:23] conscience now we know it was the will
[1:18:26] of God for that baby to be healed and I
[1:18:29] believe it was the perfect will of God
[1:18:31] that it was going to be through that
[1:18:33] mother's heart for that young mother and
[1:18:36] that child to pray and bring forth the
[1:18:37] Fulfillment but if she wouldn't have
[1:18:39] been obedient to that sure I it wouldn't
[1:18:42] the story wouldn't have gone the way we
[1:18:43] hear it I would presume that she would
[1:18:46] have got down there and brother Brandon
[1:18:47] would have discerned and and and the
[1:18:49] baby would have been healed but because
[1:18:51] she was obedient and she acted out her
[1:18:53] part oh the Great composer was able to
[1:18:55] stand there say you know the baby's
[1:18:57] already healed because up there was a
[1:18:59] mother and God moved upon her heart to
[1:19:01] pray for your baby she's already healed
[1:19:03] what was it she was acting out her part
[1:19:05] in the great drama of God and every
[1:19:07] single one of us we got to act out our
[1:19:09] part in prayer and reading our Bible and
[1:19:11] making that phone call when that brother
[1:19:13] that sister comes on here we all all US
[1:19:16] mean we don't have some big great
[1:19:18] something to do the big great something
[1:19:19] to do is the part that God gave you to
[1:19:21] play it can be on your knees in the
[1:19:24] closet it can be your devotions with
[1:19:25] your family M moms it can be taking care
[1:19:28] of the kids doing your laundry uh
[1:19:30] preparing the food in your own that is
[1:19:32] the great drama that God's wanting you
[1:19:34] to act out that you would be a Christian
[1:19:36] example in the darkest age the world has
[1:19:38] ever
[1:19:40] seen and that's pleasing to the
[1:19:43] Lord but we want to be in position and
[1:19:46] Satan's always trying to get us all
[1:19:48] flustered always trying to get our eyes
[1:19:50] off of the
[1:19:52] promise every man that's ever ever has

[1:25:00] believe the word says it well here you
[1:25:02] are it's proven your works is proven you
[1:25:04] believe it but when you say you believe
[1:25:07] it and you don't show up to do it
[1:25:09] something's lacking you're not in your
[1:25:12] place you're not in your position you're

[1:25:29] just talking from your mouth but if you
[1:25:31] really got faith you believe it and act
[1:25:35] like it that's right put it in
[1:25:41] action put it in action he says Noah did
[1:25:44] he put it in action he went right ahead
[1:25:46] building the ark right according
[1:25:50] to the blueprint right according to the
[1:25:54] Revelation if he just went out there A
[1:25:56] lot of times if we're not careful we get
[1:25:58] ahead of God but you there's a there's a
[1:26:02] a design there's a leading there's a
[1:26:04] blueprint we have to be careful some
[1:26:07] something God put something on your
[1:26:08] heart and if you're not careful you just
[1:26:09] run
[1:26:10] out no you want to wait for the
[1:26:13] Revelation and for the leadership of the
[1:26:15] Lord on how he wants to do it how he
[1:26:17] wants you to approach it the season the
[1:26:19] time if you're not careful I mean could
[1:26:21] you imagine if Noah said oh my it's
[1:26:23] going to rain and God wants a
[1:26:24] boat you get over there Noah what's that
[1:26:27] it's a
[1:26:28] canoe we're getting out of here man like
[1:26:31] that's no that's not what nuh
[1:26:34] that's that's not what I wanted he had
[1:26:36] to wait for the blueprint he had to wait
[1:26:38] for the spiritual revealed truth of the
[1:26:40] will of God and when he had that he went
[1:26:42] into preparation for the filling he
[1:26:44] started Gathering all the materials
[1:26:46] together he started putting everything
[1:26:48] in order and he started to frame it up
[1:26:50] according to the blueprints of God and
[1:26:51] oh what a blessed people we are that God
[1:26:54] has has revealed his blueprints to us in
[1:26:56] this day and showed us look you're part
[1:26:58] of the plan this is where you you fit
[1:27:01] through seven Church ages I've placed
[1:27:02] you in all the they've they've they've
[1:27:04] acted out all their part in the drama
[1:27:06] and now I've placed you here at this
[1:27:07] time and this is what you're fulfilling
[1:27:09] I'm revealing the son of predition
[1:27:11] revealing the son of man and if you are
[1:27:13] studying and praying and you're seeing
[1:27:15] and you're seeking and you're like okay
[1:27:17] Lord I see where we're
[1:27:18] at I understand what the Sheep mus are
[1:27:21] calling for I understand what the
[1:27:23] symphony is all about
[1:27:26] but we we want to get in sync with the
[1:27:29] great
[1:27:31] composer and
[1:27:34] just just try to see how the Lord would
[1:27:36] move
[1:27:37] us here but just thinking of
[1:27:41] how to think here Israel had been
[1:27:44] believing
[1:27:46] for for a
[1:27:48] messiah and they're carrying out the
[1:27:51] letter of the law that Moses had given
[1:27:53] to them
[1:27:55] and they're washing pots and they're
[1:27:58] doing everything and they have the
[1:27:59] priest and and all of the works and a
[1:28:02] and everything they're taking the Lambs
[1:28:04] and the sacrifices and all the
[1:28:06] ordinances and everything they're acting
[1:28:08] out they're carrying out to the letter
[1:28:10] and now here comes the great composer
[1:28:13] himself God made flesh amongst him uh
[1:28:17] proving that he was who he said he was
[1:28:20] that he was the son of
[1:28:22] man he said if you you don't believe my
[1:28:25] words believe my works for they testify
[1:28:28] of who I am and here they are they were
[1:28:31] disputing with the composer he was right
[1:28:34] on time right on Rhythm right in his
[1:28:38] place right in his position he was
[1:28:40] acting out every scripture that had ever
[1:28:42] been spoken of him and here they're
[1:28:45] disputing with
[1:28:47] them they're arguing with them I tell
[1:28:50] you if anybody was drama queens it was
[1:28:51] those Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:28:55] I I you know what's profound when you
[1:28:56] think about it you know the ark had
[1:28:58] already been carried away into Babylon
[1:29:01] and they're doing sacrifices what were
[1:29:03] they doing behind that
[1:29:05] curtain hey what were they
[1:29:08] sprinkling the ark wasn't even back
[1:29:11] there The Mercy Seat wasn't even back
[1:29:14] there where was The Mercy
[1:29:17] Seat it was walking right there in their
[1:29:20] midst and here they're just going about
[1:29:22] some big play and some big Act acting
[1:29:24] like they're holy and they're virtuous
[1:29:26] and oh look at us we have Moses to our
[1:29:28] father we hold everything to the letter
[1:29:30] and here's the word is made flesh
[1:29:32] amongst them they can't even recognize
[1:29:33] the Sheep music they're totally blind to
[1:29:37] what it say same thing happened in our
[1:29:39] day according to Divine promise God
[1:29:42] comes and veils himself in a prophet
[1:29:44] performing the word showing that Jesus
[1:29:46] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:29:48] forever and everybody's just acting out
[1:29:50] of big old drama just getting all
[1:29:52] enthused speaking in tongues running
[1:29:54] around the building oh look God's with
[1:29:56] us we got a big move of God and couldn't
[1:29:58] even recognize the word being made flesh
[1:30:00] in their midst we get results don't we
[1:30:04] did you see how many people run screamed
[1:30:07] and shout it don't have nothing to do
[1:30:08] with
[1:30:10] it it has everything to recognize your
[1:30:13] day and its message to recognize what
[1:30:16] the composer is telling you to do to be
[1:30:18] in your position to be ready when he
[1:30:20] calls on you when it's your turn
[1:30:25] search the scriptures and them you think
[1:30:26] you have eternal life and they testify
[1:30:28] of
[1:30:31] me I like this we just say how the Lord
[1:30:33] would help us here just thinking about
[1:30:36] Israel and their
[1:30:37] condition and how they're just they're
[1:30:39] just going through the motions man
[1:30:42] lifeless no life it just dead
[1:30:45] works so dead and consumed with their
[1:30:48] Theology and their religion they can't
[1:30:50] even recognize God made flesh in their
[1:30:52] midst opening the blind eyes raising the
[1:30:57] dead you you open the Blind Man's eyes
[1:31:00] on the Sabbath on shabat I can't shows
[1:31:03] he's of the devil I mean how how insane
[1:31:07] can you be give glory to God how did
[1:31:10] this happen I told you and you wouldn't
[1:31:12] listen to me I was born blind and and he
[1:31:15] he he spit on my eye he put Mone on my
[1:31:17] eyes he said wash and now I can see all
[1:31:20] I know is I once was blind but now I can
[1:31:24] see you would think they'd be able to
[1:31:26] recognize the great composer is here
[1:31:28] with us oh he he he's orchestrating the
[1:31:31] greatest drama let's get in syn let's
[1:31:33] get in line but they were so blinded by
[1:31:34] their Creed they were
[1:31:36] lifeless the prophet says for Christ
[1:31:39] indeed is the life of the church she has
[1:31:43] no other
[1:31:44] life without him she is simply a
[1:31:48] religious Society a
[1:31:52] club a meaningless
[1:31:54] Gathering of
[1:31:58] people we just try to be about 15 more
[1:32:04] minutes a meaningless Gathering of the
[1:32:07] people as a
[1:32:09] corpse bejweled and dressed he says as a
[1:32:13] corpse bejweled and dressed is still a
[1:32:17] corpse so the church no matter what
[1:32:22] programs and her grace efforts might
[1:32:25] achieve without Christ she is a corpse
[1:32:30] also a Beed
[1:32:33] corpse
[1:32:36] lifeless I remember the first time I
[1:32:38] ever had to uh I was just a boy and and
[1:32:41] and uh you know I I wasn't
[1:32:45] prepared to go into that place and see
[1:32:49] my precious brother laying there uh just
[1:32:51] an older brother in the church that had
[1:32:53] gone on to see the Lord Lord but I was
[1:32:54] about 8 years old and uh I didn't really
[1:32:57] know what I was looking for looking at
[1:33:00] and uh my mom couldn't find me and she
[1:33:03] finally found me I was out in the
[1:33:05] station wagon just in a in a ball just
[1:33:07] balling because I was catching the
[1:33:10] gravity but see I didn't have the
[1:33:12] Revelation I didn't know oh that's just
[1:33:13] a
[1:33:14] shell our brother's changed he's just
[1:33:17] changed from one body to another now
[1:33:19] he's he's skipping on the Hills of Glory
[1:33:22] but you go in there and and and in the
[1:33:24] natural what do they do they do their
[1:33:25] best to doll it all up and make it look
[1:33:27] like somewhat of a shell don't they but
[1:33:30] without the life in
[1:33:33] there without life and there it's just a
[1:33:36] corpse listen to what he's saying it
[1:33:39] it's striking he says as a corpse
[1:33:41] bejweled and dressed is still a corpse
[1:33:44] if we're not careful we're just dressing
[1:33:46] oursel with knowledge just dressing
[1:33:49] oursel with
[1:33:50] religion just dressing ourselves
[1:33:54] with an idea of what we think is right
[1:33:56] and if you're not careful you're just a
[1:34:00] corpse Proverbs 21:16 would say the man
[1:34:04] that Werth out of the way of
[1:34:06] understanding shall remain in the
[1:34:09] congregation of the
[1:34:12] Dead look at these words oh just just
[1:34:16] the man that Werth out of the way of
[1:34:20] understanding shall remain in the
[1:34:22] congregation of the dead what a what a
[1:34:25] sight that the that he's saying the
[1:34:28] congregation of the Dead what a dreadful
[1:34:30] place to
[1:34:31] be and in a day when we see all this
[1:34:34] stuff about The Walking Dead and zombies
[1:34:37] and all of these things what is it it's
[1:34:39] like the devil's just showing the world
[1:34:41] a picture of of these lifeless corpse of
[1:34:44] people walking around a Congregation of
[1:34:47] the Dead oh you talk about a dreadful
[1:34:49] place but don't you realize around this
[1:34:52] nation and around the world there's
[1:34:54] church house after church house and all
[1:34:57] it is is a Congregation of the Dead
[1:35:00] they're dressed with their religious and
[1:35:02] their their thinking and all of their
[1:35:04] ideas and their Creeds they're sitting
[1:35:06] in pews all of them in a line all of
[1:35:09] them staring forward and they're
[1:35:11] lifeless it's a Congregation of the dead
[1:35:14] because they've wandered out of the
[1:35:18] way well that should behoove
[1:35:21] us friends there's only one place
[1:35:24] there's life and that's in this
[1:35:26] message if you wander out of the way of
[1:35:29] this message you become lifeless you
[1:35:32] just become a bejweled corpse with ideas
[1:35:35] and Theology and Creeds and dogmas with
[1:35:38] no life to be able to perform the word
[1:35:40] that you say you
[1:35:44] believe 1 Timothy 5:6 would say but she
[1:35:47] that liveth in pleasure is dead while
[1:35:50] she
[1:35:51] liveth I say oh God God help us Lord I
[1:35:55] don't want to be a lifeless corpse I
[1:35:57] don't want to be like the children of
[1:35:59] Israel just going through the
[1:36:01] motions I mean think about that here
[1:36:04] they're they're living the most strict
[1:36:07] life with the keeping of all of the law
[1:36:10] of
[1:36:12] Moses and they're just a bejweled
[1:36:16] corpse you get the
[1:36:19] picture and if we're not careful we come
[1:36:21] into the same condition void of the Life
[1:36:24] of Christ void of
[1:36:27] Works void of the moving of the spirit
[1:36:30] just going about our day doing what we
[1:36:33] would want to do like oh yeah I better
[1:36:34] show up for church for my religious
[1:36:36] Duty we need the spe we need that same
[1:36:39] Spirit of Life inside of us we need the
[1:36:42] life of God and there brother Brandon
[1:36:46] would go on and say speaking of I I just
[1:36:49] bypass that for time but he would say
[1:36:51] there there they're in the the the the
[1:36:54] uh Tabernacle and they're singing I
[1:36:56] believe Psalms 22 singing about the
[1:36:59] psalm of David my bones my bones they
[1:37:02] stare at them and they're singing a song
[1:37:03] and he says 200 yards away from the
[1:37:05] temple there was the true Mercy Seat
[1:37:07] hanging on the tree you talk about a
[1:37:10] lifeless bejweled corpse here they're
[1:37:13] going through all the motions and all
[1:37:15] the routine of what they that they think
[1:37:18] is making them Justified before God in
[1:37:21] their sight and yet the very everything
[1:37:23] they had a need of was hanging on a
[1:37:25] cross 200 yards
[1:37:28] away and I find many times you know that
[1:37:31] the the the devil he'll try to get you
[1:37:33] in a place and in a position where you
[1:37:36] become
[1:37:37] comfortable you become complacent you
[1:37:40] become satisfied with maybe the
[1:37:42] knowledge that you've gained and if
[1:37:44] you're not careful you start to do as
[1:37:46] the scripture says the man that Werth
[1:37:48] out of the way of understanding I say oh
[1:37:52] I don't want to be a Wanderer
[1:37:55] I want to get into the Sheep music I
[1:37:56] want to get in rhythm with the great
[1:37:59] composer I want to cry out to God say
[1:38:02] Lord Jesus I need to have you in my life
[1:38:04] Lord I need to be led by your spirit I
[1:38:07] want to act out the Sheep
[1:38:09] music this is the quote where he says
[1:38:12] that we'll just try to move through it
[1:38:14] um he said neither could they see that
[1:38:17] that was their their very God when he
[1:38:20] was hanging there on the cross and them
[1:38:22] singing the 22nd Psalms in the temple
[1:38:24] 200 yards away my God my God why hast
[1:38:26] Thou forsaken me they pierce my feet in
[1:38:29] my hands see all my bones they stare at
[1:38:31] me why hast Thou forsaken me and there
[1:38:34] the very God that they had sung about
[1:38:37] blind enough to have him tacked to a
[1:38:39] cross and didn't know
[1:38:42] it what a what a
[1:38:46] shame Ezekiel would talk about it in
[1:38:49] chapter
[1:38:50] 37 about the dry bones
[1:38:54] the valley of dry bones where life once
[1:38:56] was now there's a valley of dry
[1:38:58] bones and he comes and says it's the
[1:39:01] whole house of Israel here once was a
[1:39:04] mighty Church a mighty Army had Moses
[1:39:07] leading by a pillar of fire and Joshua
[1:39:09] leading by a pillar of fire and you had
[1:39:11] a mighty anointed king like David rise
[1:39:14] up and the wisdom of Solomon there what
[1:39:17] a what a marvelous time of Israel as it
[1:39:20] was and now you're reading in the
[1:39:22] scriptures what happened to him and says
[1:39:24] oh uh he he catches the vision he says
[1:39:26] look there's a valley full of dry bones
[1:39:28] where life once was now they're all
[1:39:32] dead he says this this is the whole
[1:39:36] house of
[1:39:37] Israel that's where Ezekiel 37 would say
[1:39:40] then he said unto me son of man these
[1:39:42] bones are the whole house of Israel
[1:39:44] behold they say our bones are dried and
[1:39:46] our hope is lost we are cut off by our
[1:39:48] parts they wandered away we're T tying
[1:39:51] that to the Sheep music what happened
[1:39:53] they they were always backsliding
[1:39:55] they're always getting away from the
[1:39:56] will of God if they would just repent
[1:39:58] and get back with the composer God would
[1:40:00] bless
[1:40:00] them some of us just need to repent Lord
[1:40:03] I'm sorry I messed up I made a
[1:40:06] mistake don't let Pride hold you down
[1:40:08] whatever you do just repent you ain't
[1:40:10] got to do pentant praise God he already
[1:40:13] paid the price for your sins just say
[1:40:14] Lord I messed
[1:40:15] up I've wandered away I feel like I'm
[1:40:19] sitting in the congregation of the dead
[1:40:20] now I don't feel the spirit of God in my
[1:40:21] life Lord I'm repenting I want to get
[1:40:23] back in
[1:40:25] harmony few more here just moving
[1:40:29] through it Jude 1111 says woe unto them
[1:40:34] for they have gone in the way of Cain
[1:40:36] and rang greedily after the heir of
[1:40:37] balam for reward and perished in the
[1:40:39] gainsaying of K these are spots in your
[1:40:42] Feast of Charity when they Feast with
[1:40:45] you feeding themselves without fear
[1:40:47] clouds they are without water carried
[1:40:49] about of winds trees whose fruits wither
[1:40:52] without fruit twice dead plucked up by
[1:40:54] the roots no
[1:40:57] hope just dead and lifeless a bejweled
[1:41:02] corpse I say God forbid that we have
[1:41:05] people amongst us living in
[1:41:09] sins fulfilling this very
[1:41:13] scripture I say oh God may your word go
[1:41:15] right now strike to the heart say Lord I
[1:41:20] realize that I have just been stooped in
[1:41:22] Tradition I am void of the spirit of God
[1:41:25] moving in my life I am so out of Harmony
[1:41:29] and Rhythm of the word I look into my
[1:41:31] life and I can see the pattern that's
[1:41:34] laying in there my UPS and my Downs the
[1:41:37] things that I listen to the things that
[1:41:39] I watched I realize I am not in harmony
[1:41:41] Lord May the Life of Christ come into me
[1:41:44] and make me live the message change me
[1:41:46] Lord change my
[1:41:48] nature Lord I need a nature change
[1:41:54] you can clean up a pig what is he going
[1:41:55] to do and a lot of times that's what we
[1:41:58] do we go from meeting meeting Church to
[1:42:00] church we get all cleaned up we feel all
[1:42:01] good and we wonder why we fall into the
[1:42:03] same things because you need nature
[1:42:06] change if you see yourself in a in a in
[1:42:08] Cycles over and over and over and you
[1:42:10] wonder what just you need a nature
[1:42:12] change I mean it's it's awesome to go to
[1:42:14] meetings and and the presence of God
[1:42:16] move and you feel so refreshed and
[1:42:19] rejuvenated but if you're not
[1:42:22] careful you get deceived into thinking
[1:42:25] that you're okay when you don't examine
[1:42:28] your life and realize you know what I'm
[1:42:29] falling into the same
[1:42:31] traps I don't really have that
[1:42:33] overcoming power that I hear the
[1:42:35] composer talk about and Lord if it's
[1:42:38] laying there in the message if you say
[1:42:40] that I can be an overcomer if you say I
[1:42:42] can be more than a conqueror Lord if you
[1:42:45] you say greater is he that is in me than
[1:42:46] he that is in the world then Lord if
[1:42:48] that's what the Sheep music says Lord
[1:42:50] then I want to get in Rhythm I want to
[1:42:52] get in me Lord I want to die out to my
[1:42:55] way of thinking I want to die out to all
[1:42:57] of my all of my mistakes and all of my
[1:42:59] failures I want to look into your word
[1:43:02] and I want to find the sheet music I'm
[1:43:04] I'm done with all the drama I'm done
[1:43:06] with all the nonsense I'm done with work
[1:43:08] controlling my life I'm done with family
[1:43:10] control of my life I'm done with the
[1:43:12] situation and politics and everything
[1:43:14] and all the fear and scare that's in my
[1:43:17] life and I'm walking on head Shields and
[1:43:19] and I don't know what's going to come of
[1:43:20] this or that and sickness I'm I'm I'm
[1:43:22] done with all I'm going to start looking
[1:43:24] into the Sheep music and if you say Lord
[1:43:27] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:43:29] them that are in Christ Jesus Lord then
[1:43:31] that's what you said and if you're the
[1:43:32] composer Lord I'm getting in Rhythm I'm
[1:43:35] getting in harmony with that and when
[1:43:37] the devil tries to bring the
[1:43:38] condemnation when he tries to bring the
[1:43:40] guilt when he tries to bring all the
[1:43:42] things that are contrary to the Sheep
[1:43:44] music you say get away from me Satan get
[1:43:47] behind me I'm saying what the word
[1:43:51] says he goes on to say but with him in
[1:43:54] her midst with him motivating her she
[1:43:57] becomes to the wonderment of all his
[1:44:00] body the fullness of him that filth all
[1:44:04] in all an't that beautiful but with him
[1:44:08] in her midst with him motivating her she
[1:44:12] becomes the wonderment of all his body
[1:44:14] the fullness of him that filth all and
[1:44:18] all with him motivating you his life his
[1:44:22] power his leading his word his vision
[1:44:25] his drama his signs his wonders him
[1:44:29] telling you this is how revealing to you
[1:44:32] his
[1:44:34] will and brother brandham says this he
[1:44:37] says and that's the reason I believe
[1:44:38] those Visions because it's always
[1:44:40] declared to me to be the truth it comes
[1:44:42] from the word then if he says it that
[1:44:45] settles it now when it's declared like
[1:44:47] that there's no more guesswork it's
[1:44:49] going to be you can't be in a symphony
[1:44:52] or in an orchestra ra or playing the
[1:44:54] song specials or singing and you're just
[1:44:57] guessing what your part is it'll be
[1:44:59] really
[1:45:00] obvious it's why it's good to practice
[1:45:02] your song specials cuz we all know when
[1:45:05] you didn't
[1:45:07] practice you're not in harmony you're
[1:45:09] not in Rhythm the piano player doesn't
[1:45:12] know when to go what
[1:45:13] key it's okay if the Lord put on your
[1:45:16] heart sing sing maybe it's part of the
[1:45:17] drama and we need to get rhythm with and
[1:45:19] say praise God you moved on that
[1:45:21] brother's heart last minute without even
[1:45:22] preparing ation glory to God
[1:45:25] hallelujah but if you had time
[1:45:29] and hey let's Get
[1:45:31] Rhythm let's get in
[1:45:34] Harmony when it's declared like that
[1:45:36] there's no more guesswork it's going to
[1:45:38] be then you hear it thus sayeth the Lord
[1:45:40] because it's beyond the human thinking
[1:45:42] it goes up in the Realms of the Lord's
[1:45:44] thinking but you're standing here just
[1:45:47] as the vine just as a branch producing
[1:45:48] the fruit that's in the vine see God
[1:45:50] uses man and man only
[1:45:53] God doesn't use Machinery God doesn't
[1:45:55] use groups of men God doesn't use
[1:45:57] organization God uses individuals
[1:46:01] always God uses you and I want to say
[1:46:05] it's your turn the street music has
[1:46:08] turned down through seven Church ages
[1:46:11] and now it's your time we've struck the
[1:46:13] seventh seal it's the coming of the Lord
[1:46:16] the drama is set and now it's your turn
[1:46:19] to act out your the curtain's been
[1:46:21] pulled the stages said now it's your

[1:46:38] drama don't leave it up to your pastor

[1:46:42] leave it up to your brothers don't leave
[1:46:44] it up to your sisters you are the
[1:46:46] individual that Malachi 45 was talking
[1:46:49] about somebody ought to here ought to
[1:46:50] say that's me I'm the individual God
[1:46:54] doesn't use groups he doesn't use
[1:46:56] organization God uses individual God

[1:47:39] cover just look into
[1:47:46] it that's the Sheep
[1:47:50] music we'll just end on this
[1:47:56] note brother brandham uh he's talking
[1:47:59] about the boy in
[1:48:02] Finland and he had had the vision many
[1:48:05] years
[1:48:07] ago and it's amazing that he they he had
[1:48:11] them write it down in the fly leaf of
[1:48:13] their Bible and they're going through
[1:48:15] Finland and they come up on that scene
[1:48:18] uh you're familiar with it I believe
[1:48:19] brother Billy here just recently went
[1:48:20] through it and here they come up on this
[1:48:23] great scene in this accident and there
[1:48:25] the boys they're all laying on the
[1:48:27] street they're all mashed up and and you
[1:48:29] can imagine the feeling there on the
[1:48:31] street and everything and how how
[1:48:33] everybody would be feeling it's such a
[1:48:34] traumatic event event and the and the
[1:48:36] prophet got to looking around he says
[1:48:38] you know what I've seen them these
[1:48:39] mountains
[1:48:41] before he said where where have I seen
[1:48:44] this
[1:48:45] before he got to looking around and all
[1:48:47] of a sudden he realized he was he was he
[1:48:49] was stepping into that vision
[1:48:53] the very word of God that had been
[1:48:55] revealed to the prophet he was now
[1:48:58] fulfilling the vision and he said
[1:49:01] brother go go get the FL look in the fly
[1:49:03] leaf of that
[1:49:05] Bible and the prophet would say like
[1:49:08] this and he said and brother uh Moore
[1:49:10] run over to the car and got his Bible
[1:49:12] and said uh brown
[1:49:15] hair uh uh brown hair brown eyes about 8
[1:49:18] years old poorly dressed crippled been
[1:49:20] mashed up by accident a rocky land said
[1:49:23] brother brandom that's it I said that's
[1:49:25] him oh my you don't know how that feels
[1:49:29] you know where you're at
[1:49:32] then that's that's what we need church
[1:49:34] is a spiritual
[1:49:37] revelation of the message of the hour
[1:49:39] and the will of God for our lives cuz
[1:49:41] then you know where you're at it doesn't
[1:49:43] matter how bad the situation looks it
[1:49:46] doesn't matter the finances it doesn't
[1:49:48] matter your health because if Satan can
[1:49:50] get you all scared and all worried and
[1:49:53] all fearful and wonder what did I do to
[1:49:55] deserve this then you're getting out of
[1:49:57] the sheet music but when you know where
[1:49:59] you're at and where you're standing upon
[1:50:01] the word of God he says you know where
[1:50:04] you're at then all Devils out of hell if
[1:50:08] he'd line everything there was in hell
[1:50:10] around it would never stop
[1:50:13] it Hallelujah he's talking about you you
[1:50:17] can line up every devil in hell to stop
[1:50:20] this bride from manifesting this message
[1:50:22] and say Satan doesn't got enough I'm
[1:50:25] Sorry Devil you ain't got enough to stop
[1:50:27] this bride from manifesting the spoken
[1:50:30] word you ain't got
[1:50:33] enough it's there it's got to happen now
[1:50:38] the only thing is just
[1:50:43] drama what a feeling that must have
[1:50:47] been now it's just acting out the part
[1:50:53] and if what what's on My Heart Church
[1:50:56] you're just acting out the drama of
[1:50:59] what's already been forseen in the mind
[1:51:01] of God you're going to make
[1:51:03] it you're ordained to make it you can't
[1:51:07] even fail because you're predestinated
[1:51:09] not to fail you can't miss it it's just
[1:51:13] a drama the race is already over you're
[1:51:16] running a race that's already
[1:51:18] finished I like those kind of races you
[1:51:22] you are already got first place you
[1:51:24] already finished you're just just go
[1:51:26] through the motions just say what the
[1:51:28] Sheep music says just say there's
[1:51:30] therefore now condemnation to them that
[1:51:32] are in Christ Jesus just say blessed is
[1:51:34] the man whom the Lord would that's me
[1:51:36] I'm running a race that's already
[1:51:38] finished why because Christ the
[1:51:40] Forerunner has already gone
[1:51:46] before I said now I remember I knelt to
[1:51:49] this side in the vision when I prayed
[1:51:52] you have to do just as you seen it and I
[1:51:54] knelt down and they all gathered around
[1:51:55] I said now watch thus saith the spirit
[1:51:58] of God this boy's life will return to
[1:52:01] him and there he'd been dead they'd
[1:52:04] taken his pulse and everything he was
[1:52:06] gone so and all mashed up like that and
[1:52:09] I knelt down and I said Heavenly Father
[1:52:12] many thousands of miles across the sea
[1:52:14] in that lovely Nation Where I Come From
[1:52:16] America I said down there that night
[1:52:18] when you moved into that room in that
[1:52:21] lovely place and told told me that this
[1:52:23] would be and I testified of it and I
[1:52:27] stood and said you'd bring it to pass
[1:52:29] and now thy servant sees the day that is
[1:52:34] to be fulfilled I said I thank thee
[1:52:36] Heavenly Father for the power of the
[1:52:39] vision and I thank thee for all your
[1:52:42] goodness and now Eternal God author of
[1:52:46] life and Giver of all good gifts I ask
[1:52:49] you to bless this scene with your
[1:52:51] presence
[1:52:53] and when the angel of the Lord began to
[1:52:55] move down I said oh holder of this boy
[1:52:59] Spirit death according to a vision that
[1:53:02] God has already showed that you cannot
[1:53:04] hold this child therefore I call for
[1:53:07] this little soul to return to him in the
[1:53:09] name of Jesus Christ and no more than I
[1:53:11] said that the boy jumped to his feet
[1:53:14] just as normal and as well as he could
[1:53:16] be just as perfect and normal and whole
[1:53:20] as he could be oh Hallelujah I I that
[1:53:24] thrilled my soul because it was just
[1:53:25] drama and I say Malachi 4:5 has already
[1:53:29] prophesied over your life he's already
[1:53:31] spoke a vision over your life that
[1:53:33] you're going in a Rapture you might go
[1:53:35] by the way of the grave but if that same
[1:53:37] spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from
[1:53:39] the dead dwell in you it's going to
[1:53:41] Quicken your mortal body Saints you
[1:53:43] can't lose I mean you you nothing can
[1:53:46] you can't nothing can stop you from
[1:53:48] winning you're not going to lose there's
[1:53:50] nothing the devil can do to stop it I
[1:53:52] said say let's get away from the fear
[1:53:54] and the scare and realize I'm just
[1:53:56] acting out the great drama of God lord I
[1:53:59] realize that you've called me I realize
[1:54:01] that you've elected me I realize that
[1:54:04] you chose me and I realize the devil is
[1:54:06] trying to cause a bunch of drama he's
[1:54:08] trying to poison my mind he's trying to
[1:54:10] stir up stuff in the church but I'm
[1:54:12] ready to kick that Old Devil out of here
[1:54:14] devil get out of the church get out of
[1:54:16] my mind get out of my life I'm going to
[1:54:19] act out the drama according to the Sheep
[1:54:22] music according with the great composer
[1:54:24] has told me and I'm going to manifest
[1:54:26] every single word of
[1:54:29] God then you can be like
[1:54:31] David in the
[1:54:33] trial no matter how hard it gets no
[1:54:36] matter what you're going through and you
[1:54:38] can say yay though I walk through the
[1:54:40] valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:54:42] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[1:54:46] rod and thy staff they comfort me thou
[1:54:49] preparest a table before me in the
[1:54:51] presence of mine enemies

[1:54:56] runneth
[1:54:58] over I'm just acting out the
[1:55:01] drama Goliath I
[1:55:04] apologize but you're you've entered into
[1:55:07] God's Great
[1:55:09] drama I've been anointed to be
[1:55:12] king that's God's plans for my life and
[1:55:15] now you are getting in the
[1:55:17] way so I'm just going to keep acting out
[1:55:20] the drama I don't know what the Goliath
[1:55:22] is in your life whatever whatever
[1:55:24] challenges are before you we if we can
[1:55:27] have a positive approach to whatever
[1:55:30] Calamity whatever trial it is and look
[1:55:33] at the positive Sheep music and and
[1:55:36] words of the composer and know that
[1:55:37] you're going to make it
[1:55:43] through spiritual revealed I want to
[1:55:46] just read that in closing how the how
[1:55:48] the prophet said
[1:55:49] that he said that spiritual revealed
[1:55:56] truth I just thought of that story of
[1:55:58] Peter
[1:56:03] cartright he
[1:56:05] said every man that's ever had the
[1:56:08] spiritual revealed truth of the will of
[1:56:09] God makes preparation for the
[1:56:12] fulfilling Peter cartright God told him
[1:56:15] hold me a
[1:56:16] Revival so what was he doing he was
[1:56:20] preparing he was washing windows
[1:56:24] he was getting ready for the
[1:56:26] Fulfillment and when the devil tried to
[1:56:30] interfere right he come up say what do
[1:56:33] you think you're doing well I'm I'm I'm
[1:56:34] washing
[1:56:36] windows what are you doing I'm going to
[1:56:38] hold a Revival he said not in my
[1:56:43] town you're not going to hold a Revival
[1:56:46] he said well God told me to hold a
[1:56:47] Revival well if you're going to hold a
[1:56:50] Revival then you're going to have to
[1:56:52] whip me
[1:56:54] first he didn't Flinch he didn't wonder
[1:56:58] he didn't start to well maybe this
[1:56:59] wasn't the will of God after all maybe I
[1:57:02] ain't the bride of Christ I got sick and
[1:57:04] I've been sick for this long now and
[1:57:06] I've been praying and you know what
[1:57:08] maybe I I really didn't have it all no
[1:57:11] no faith doesn't waver Abraham staggered
[1:57:15] not at the promise of God he was fully
[1:57:19] persuaded and Peter car right
[1:57:22] you God told me to hold a Revival and no
[1:57:26] matter whatever devil or person tries to
[1:57:28] get in the way I have a revelation of
[1:57:30] the will of God for my life he said so
[1:57:32] then if I got to go through you I'll
[1:57:34] just do that next and he got done
[1:57:36] washing the windows he pulled up his
[1:57:38] sleeves he put a whooping on him and
[1:57:39] invited him to church and he had a
[1:57:41] Revival on the man got saved oh I say
[1:57:43] that was part of the Sheep music if
[1:57:45] anything tries to interrupt what God
[1:57:47] said about your life just tell that Old
[1:57:49] Devil I'm acting out the great drama if
[1:57:51] I got to take care of this I'll take
[1:57:53] care of it next but I'm going to keep
[1:57:55] going forward in Christ God bless
[1:57:59] [Applause]

[1:58:55] believe you just keep going and it just
[1:58:58] keeps happening you know I I really like
[1:59:02] that little
[1:59:03] part you know I I Billy mentioned it the
[1:59:07] last week and Matthew mentioned it
[1:59:09] tonight when the disciples had fished
[1:59:13] all night and they did everything they
[1:59:15] could do and the Lord said go out there
[1:59:19] and fish he said when they came in they
[1:59:21] came in with their own ability when they
[1:59:24] went back out there they went back with
[1:59:25] the word of
[1:59:27] God and that makes the difference you do
[1:59:31] all that you can do and we always do all
[1:59:34] that we can do but when it fits down to
[1:59:36] it when you go back with the sheet music
[1:59:39] and you go back with obedience to the
[1:59:42] word of God you'll get the result every
[1:59:45] time because he wants receive all the
[1:59:48] glory and I just thought I I just it
[1:59:52] just touched my heart when he said the

[2:00:01] of

[2:00:18] spectacular and and you don't sell
[2:00:20] yourself short don't count yourself out
[2:00:23] you're a part of it I remember how many
[2:00:26] people came up in the prayer line and I
[2:00:28] heard the Lord say to over and over
[2:00:30] again God created you to go to heaven he
[2:00:34] made you a part of the word don't let
[2:00:37] the enemy rob it from you amen don't let
[2:00:41] him don't let him bring you down you

[2:00:57] motions of what he told you to do you're
[2:01:01] coming to partake in communion you're
[2:01:05] doing this in remembrance of him what he
[2:01:08] told us to do and and and you're
[2:01:11] fulfilling that and by it doesn't matter
[2:01:14] what your request is it doesn't matter

[2:01:31] Thy word Lord at Thy word I'll cast the
[2:01:35] net I toiled here all night I know
[2:01:39] there's no fish here the water
[2:01:42] temperature is not right there's nothing
[2:01:45] about it that will make sense but at Thy
[2:01:48] word amen how how would could you
[2:01:51] believe that Comm communion could be
[2:01:53] your healing communion could be your

[2:02:47] Paul now he received of the Lord and now
[2:02:51] now he's bringing what he received of
[2:02:53] the Lord and he knows that if they
[2:02:56] continue in this that there will be
[2:02:59] great blessings for the church it's hard
[2:03:02] to read these scriptures and believe
[2:03:04] that so many places don't even have
[2:03:08] communion just think they're missing
[2:03:11] they have all the puzzle built and this
[2:03:14] is that one last

[2:04:12] that which also I delivered unto you
[2:04:16] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[2:04:18] which he was betrayed took bread

[2:04:26] and said take eat this is my body which
[2:04:30] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[2:04:34] of me and after the same manner also he

[2:20:59] of the Passover when Jesus knew that his
[2:21:03] hour was come that he should depart out
[2:21:07] of this world unto the father having
[2:21:11] loved his own which were in the world he
[2:21:15] loved them until the end and supper
[2:21:19] being ended the Vil having now put it
[2:21:22] into the heart of Judas scariot Simon's
[2:21:26] son to betray him Jesus knowing that the
[2:21:31] father had given all things into his
[2:21:34] hands and that he was come from God and
[2:21:38] went to God he raised us from supper and
[2:21:42] laid aside his garments and took a towel
[2:21:46] and girth himself and after he had
[2:21:50] poured water into a basin and begin to
[2:21:54] wash the disciples feet and to wipe them
[2:21:58] with the towel wherewith he was girded
[2:22:02] he cometh to Simon Peter and Peter said
[2:22:06] unto him Lord does thou wash my feet
[2:22:10] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[2:22:15] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[2:22:19] know hereafter after and Peter said unto
[2:22:22] him Thou shalt never wash my feet kind
[2:22:28] of sounds like us sometimes don't
[2:22:30] it and Jesus answered him if I wash thee
[2:22:36] not thou hath no part with me Simon
[2:22:40] Peter said unto him Lord not my feet
[2:22:42] only but also my hands in my
[2:22:45] head Jesus said to
[2:22:48] him he that is washed needeth not save
[2:22:52] to wash his feet but is clean every wit
[2:22:56] and ye are clean but not all for he knew
[2:23:01] who should betray him therefore he said
[2:23:04] ye are not all clean so after he had
[2:23:07] washed their feet and had taken His
[2:23:10] Garment and was set down again he said
[2:23:14] un to them know ye what I have done to
[2:23:18] you you call me master and Lord and ye
[2:23:22] say well for so I am if I then your Lord
