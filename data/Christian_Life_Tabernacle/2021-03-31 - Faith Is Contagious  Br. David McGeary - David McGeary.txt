going to have brother david can conor come at this time and just he's got a testimony for us if he wants to come at this time amen uh god bless you sense uh i'm not good at this but i'll try i promised to god a while ago you know brother matthew had called a prayer line you know and as he was preaching there was a burden upon my heart you know i had a test in front of me that i was really shaking in front of and you know it states licensing tests that i was really afraid that i would fail and then i came to the prayer line the first thing when i looked at me he was smiling and he just i told him you know i just need prayer you know for god's to grant me the wisdom to face it because i read on the you know on the stage things where he says only 50 of people that text the test passes the test you know and i was sitting that was just like this is people that's been in this business for their whole life you know and i'm barely getting started so i was really worried when then brother matthew looks at me says you will have a high score i just like praise the lord and then he said a word of prayer and we moved on so from that night you know i just kind of went it uplifted my spirit a little bit but you know every time somebody will bring to me the report and be like this many people only passes the test you know i'm like i don't want to hear it but long story short you know this morning i woke up early morning i had an appointment to go check the test i hope you already can guess the result but then you know i just started first you know instead of revising i just started praising the lord early morning and then uh i walked into the test room you know from the moment i got into the moment i got out of the test it just felt like i didn't do anything but praise god i passed it with a very high score just like uh brother matthew said he was very high score you know i failed in 10 question out of like 90 some so it was really it was really something i'm still excited even if i don't look like it you know and another testimony i wanted to share was you know we had a men's breakfast i believe two weeks ago and you know we were calling an emergency trip back to colorado with my mom on you know some affairs that we had to finish up and we left here that saturday right after you know the meeting i was rushing we went to the airport and then we got there you know as the date went on we did everything that we were supposed to do but the sunday came in sunday morning i was driving with one of my old friends back in denver you know i was uh was going to church i was trying to meditate so we went on to picking up uh you know two of the youth that we used to pick up my brother my friend picks up and then we pick them up going to the service in the car you know there was a sister that we picked up with his brother as was going to the service in denver and then there was a there's this application for people that are diagnosed with diabetes that tells them when the sugar goes up and down and stuff so that things started ringing you know and then i was just trying to meditate just lock in and then it ranked the first time i was just like well maybe it's an alarm i didn't care and then it rang together sink in time and then i was just like sis do you need them in your alarm to wake up on sunday then you know i said it as a joke and then like she really gave me a sad look and she was just like no it's not an alarm i'm sorry it bothered you i'm actually suffering i was diagnosed with diabetes you know so that's just telling me my sugar is going up high you know and you know that was like uh you know like kind of wake up like you gotta limit your jokes you know and then i was just like i'm i said just i'm sorry within myself and i was just like we were playing the music in the car i said brother can you stop the music and i asked her i was just like because i was sitting in the front seat i was just like can you just put your hand here and we'll pray you know as the car was going on and then we said a word of prayer you know from the moment he said the word of prayer all the way till we made it to church that thing didn't ring not even once anymore and then during the service you know after the service i i walked up to i was just like how you feeling she said i felt worse at this service but nearing the end of the service i started feeling stronger and everything you know today i called i texted her in the morning you know as i was just thinking of what the lord has done for me and i thought about her i texted her i was just like so how are you doing you know she replied back to me said i know i'm not feeling at the best but i know slowly that thing is leaving me that i will still be a hundred percent where i was before that so it's just a testimony i wanted to share with you with you guys but thank god for his goodness and his kindness toward me hey man let's just sing this song i'm looking for a city the one that's not made by hands hey man i want to go to that city amen and now i'm looking for a city the one that made my hands i'm looking over jordan i see the promised land the waters will

sister ruth carrera's brother who remains in a coma i definitely want to keep time in prayer and brother jackson he's got a prayer because there says please pray for my cousin matt robinson he is

we were able to go by there and visit him today and he decided today to follow our lord jesus christ so it's just a testimony to see a fulfillment coming on his life and waiting for the lord to just do miraculous things but there's there's prayer requests that needs a healing touch this evening amen and brother branham said that if we have faith as small as a mustard seed now he said the mustard seed cannot be hybrid because it's it's the original thing and you can't you can't hybrid mustard seed so we know that we have true believers in our midst tonight that could believe for a healing touch this evening amen the brothers that are ready to take the offering if they could come at this time let's just bow our heads heavenly lord father lord we're such a privileged people to just know your truth this evening lord and lord here we are with some serious needs before you lord and for uh for a person like ours lord lord we we're thinking that it's something harder it's just a process of life but lord for you it's nothing lord nothing is impossible for you to do lord jesus so lord we're just putting our faith together with all the believers in this building lord and the ones online lord we ask that you just come upon the scene tonight lord and just have your manifested word come to life lord you're the same yesterday today and forever lord and we know that because your work says

those that have made the effort to come out [Music] stop what they're doing lord and prepare for service and or drive across town and the traffic the way it is lord come into your house because there's something in their heart that they love you and they love to hear your word and they love to worship father they know deep down inside in their heart that you know what they have need of and that you'll give them just exactly what they need something to encourage them something to lift them up something that they can place in storage father for the time of need lord we just ask you to be with us this evening we ask these things in jesus precious name we pray amen and amen god bless you this evening and let's turn in our bibles over to the romans now i i have to make a um a confession i i guess that's good for the soul is that right so um anyway i had asked a different brother to preach but things came up and he couldn't minister for us so i was sitting back with thinking of who i might get to uh take the service you know just going through my mind and so i'm sitting there at the house and leslie looks over at me and she says are you preaching tonight i said tonight i said today's tuesday she said i thought it was tuesday too so it's your fault and uh so anyway um i had a little something on my heart but you know so i'm just gonna try to dig it out of my heart tonight if i can but it's uh um we'll just trust the lord huh okay i mean you're all great students of the word i told gary i said you know what every now and then you've got to preach one that's not too good you know so but i just hope that i can express this to you this evening and it'll encourage you and bless you so if you have your bibles we'd like to read two scriptures one found in romans 1 and 17 and the other found in romans 10 and 17. so um i don't think it's a a coincidence that these scriptures are both the 17th scripture but we just trust that the word of god will be uplifting to you for herein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith it is written the just shall live by faith and god the righteousness of god is revealed from faith to faith and then if we turn over to the seventh tenth chapter of romans and the 17th verse it says so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us this evening in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may um be seated i'd like just to fellowship for a few moments i've been promising you that my sermons would start to get shorter and i hope i can keep my word tonight and keep this one and not so long but if i was the title this this evening i'd like to title it faith is contagious faith is contagious and we we um have talked a lot about uh contagion uh here uh lately and and uh uh because of what we call the plague or or whatever that you want to call it but we realized one thing that uh it it it was contagious and what contagious means is it spread by direct contact between people so you you had to come in contact with somebody that has it before you can get it and uh they uh they tried to build up all kinds of uh things to inoculate you so you wouldn't get it to put face masks on to stay six feet away from everybody because they realized it could be spread so they felt well what things can we do to uh keep it from uh spreading you know so they came up with all kinds of things to keep it from spreading you notice on all the lists they left out one thing and that was prayer you know uh they just they left out prayer you know and they they along with it they they they put the fear they attach fear with it so that uh you were afraid to get it now we're gonna say something but i want you to hold that thought about being afraid to get it that was the fear people stayed home people didn't go see people if you had it then if you stayed away from people you quarantined yourself and so that was because that was a sickness and we know that sickness is of the devil at all sicknesses of the devil in fact satan's army that's what he brings he brings sickness and death and and those are the things that he wants to but you know we're talking about faith and and faith is contagious too okay it's something that can be spread and uh if you don't isolate yourself to spread it you've got to come in contact to spread it because it's spread by contact and that's what we we said it spread from faith to faith so we realized that the scripture tells us that faith is contagious it's something that can be spread in fact the lord knew that so he told the disciples he said go into all the world and spread the gospel go out and infect people with what you have come in contact with people so they can get what you've got so because we realize that when we begin to see it that that faith is it's contagious it's spread from faith to faith and act and so with that so uh set in our hearts okay and our mind that we we realize that that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god so we understand that faith comes by a spread it's spread it's spread by coming in contact it's read by hearing and so we notice that when we're talked about this disease so this contagion of faith is is healing it's deliverance it's everything opposite of the other uh contagion this that contagion carried death this contagion carries life this contagion carries sickness this contagion carries a healing and so you notice that how these two run in parallel and how they run office the first thing that they want you to do with this sickness is quarantine yourself don't get close to nobody put a mask on your mouth so good that nobody can hear you and understand i mean i don't know about you i just have to be honest in my heart that i i hear people try to talk to me through that mask and after i get them to repeat four or five times i just have to keep myself from reaching up there and tearing that thing off their face and say what did you say you know and if you try to get closer to here they're backing up you know you know look i mean well let me tell you about this contagion the faith contagion the the faith that's contagious you don't back up hey amen you don't care if somebody gets right in your face amen if you really want them to hear it so so we we understand that faith is contagious and then first of all before you uh you you couldn't contagious or you couldn't be contagious until you had it if you understand if you don't have it you can't spread it you know so uh you know a lot of that was quite the uh controversy is that people didn't have it but yet they had to act like they did have it now in that just exactly what happens sometimes with with faith people act like they got it but they really don't have it and because they really don't have it they really can't spread it yeah you know what i'm saying so okay so therefore they're not contagious we want to be contagious we don't want to be not contagious you know this is one disease that we want to have that's one infection that we want to have we want to be infected by faith we want to have it and it's like anything anytime that they want to identify something that's contagious they give it symptoms so you can uh you can say uh oh you're doing this and you're doing this and you're doing this you know what i mean uh i i you know it's just like it got so bad that uh you know anybody that knows me knows that i sneeze uh every now and then i don't just knees once i i'm kind of a multi-sneezer and uh but if i would sneeze i mean you you the place would go silent everybody would jump back and oh is he got it is he contagious and then they look for symptoms you know what i mean i always thought that i i would like to sneeze sometime and then have all kinds of beads of sweat on my head and you have to look like you know it i make it cause i want to spread it but it wouldn't matter if i didn't have it i can't spread it and so is faith faith is a contagious but it can only be spread if you've got it you can only be spread if you've been infected look you have to get it somewhere it's got to come from somewhere it's in infected and that's what the lord did he they were there and he said now i want you to go up into this upper room and i want you to wait there until you're infected because when you come out of that upper room i want you to be contagious because faith is contagious and their very testimony shows that they were it was contagious so what i don't understand faith is contagious if you haven't got it you need to get around it so it can get off on you that's why we like to send our kids to camp because they can get in that atmosphere and people can get there and they get to praying and they get in the meeting and it's there and if it's real and it's there then they can get a good case of it amen let me tell you this contagion it's like the other contagion like the other faith if i could use it that way it it's a good sickness do you say brother mcgary you're using the word sickness for faith well the world thinks you're sick if you've got this infection of faith the world really thinks you're sick they think it's affected your mind it's affected your actions it's affected your thinking it gets can it's contagious but if you you get in that atmosphere and you get there and you're there then then it spreads and that's what you that's what you want to have happen you've got to you've got to uh you've got to understand that faith is something that can be spread if you're infected you can spread it that that's a that's the beautiful thing about it and so it's got symptoms you know what i'm saying faith has symptoms it it has things that show up if it has things that um makes a makes a difference so if you could think of it you know what i mean if you could think that that's what the lord did in your life is he came by and he infected you with his spirit and it it comes by contact that's what he said he said it's by faith to faith somebody had to go out and preach it paul went out to the gentiles and he was full of this uh of faith he was was full of in his heart and he got to a place and he was with a bunch of people that were weren't infected at all they didn't have no faith but but paul was full of it you know what i mean and he it wasn't something that he wanted to go and quarantine because he had it it wasn't something that he wanted to keep his distance because he had it but he wanted to he wanted to he wanted to be a spreader isn't that what we hear about today oh they're spreaders they're spreaders we have a joke about you know the brothers you know we call one another super spreaders oh you're just a super spreader well i don't feel sick at all i'm just i said yeah you're a super spreader well let me tell you paul was a super spreader [Applause] amen he wanted to spread what he had and i i don't know what they call it the uh center from disease control c d c you know that was that was them unbelievers all them scribes and them pharisees they were the ones that wanted to snuff it out they were the ones that wanted to put an end to it they were the ones that were trying to keep it going but not paul paul got up there and he looked for a way to spread it he got up there and said oh he says oh he said i noticed this altar here to the unknown god amen he had the opportunity now to do a little spreading amen he was going to infect some people and how was he going to infect him he was going to infect him with the word of god because the spread comes from the word of god it's spread by the word of god faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god and it comes from infection to infection from faith to faith so you understand that we talk about spreading christianity but it isn't spread without personal contact that's why they do all kinds of tests and they said how long can this disease live on a surface and they found out it can't live two or three minutes and everybody's all worried about cleaning the surface you know what i mean i always marveled you get on the airplane and everybody's sitting right next to each other they're six inches behind just six inches neck and then they come on and said oh we've wiped the plane down we sprayed this spray in there well we've already got the best yes protection so we understand that it's got to it's got symptoms it's it's got to be it it's got to be contact to spread that's why he said go into all the world and and so we we begin to see that it it's symptoms and so we we look at just take a a a thought here about you know uh what what is it how how do you spread it that's what i'd want to know so i want to know i i'm commissioned to spread it go into all the world and infect other people with your faith and so what you're wanting to do is you're not trying to pass the knowledge of it you're trying to give them the symptoms of it you want them to experience the same thing you experience you want them for to them to feel the same effect that's like when you talk about someone was sick you say did you have covet and i said yeah i believe i had kobo well what did you feel like well i felt like a dish rag for for two weeks you know i felt i was fine when i was laying on my back but the minute i got up i i didn't feel i could stand well were you did you have a fever no did you were you nauseous no no and other people say yeah i had this symptom and that's the first thing everybody does they talk about symptoms because the first thing they want to know is if you really had it or not or or you just got a tail you know what i mean but somebody that's got it got it you know it's like someone that shows up with freckles and they didn't have freckles the day before you might just consider that they got measles does that disease exist anymore or smallpox or or or something you know so that you you've got to understand that this is a time that that there is a restoration so this in the last days there's a return to the infection that our fathers were infected with and there's a people that are going to be numbered amongst those that have received the faith disease you say why do you call it a disease because satan feels it's a disease because it's what kills him okay in his eyesight we look at a sickness and we say oh this is a disease this is bad why because it's going to make me sick why it's going to kill me it's going to affect me it's going to take my livelihood away from me and now satan's back doing the same thing oh stay away from that disease because that disease kills unbelief it kills the effect that satan has it keeps him from being able to change lives so so this is a this is a real something that we've received and that been passed down yes from infection to infection from faith to faith and so we we know that that what what happened to us when we got this infection what what what what what what transpired in our lives well what happened was is that that there there was something uh that was uh that was hid so this infection is something that is real but it's hid so that's what happened there was a reality this infection this faith that infects you is real but it was hid you didn't you didn't see it but it still existed you were living your life without it but it still existed it's real and it's something that's very real but it's hid and then then when you got infected you got from faith or the revelation of god is spread from faith to faith so what is revelation it's something that's previously hid and now made known so when you think about what it is that you're spreading you're spreading the vision the eyesight the reality that takes something that's hid and now makes it known that that's what faith does faith takes that which is real that's hidden and now makes it known so it's no longer hidden and now once that they see they can't help it it's what you see because you you've got it so we're talking about our commission we're talking about going out and testifying we're talking about spreading because we know that what we have is contagious that people can get it they can catch it it can affect them the same way it affects you but if if you if you're not sure you have it then you're not sure you'll spread it but if you know you've got it then you know you can spread it and you know what you're spreading you're spreading revelation you're spreading eyes out you're spreading what you're making what was hid real that's what faith does it goes out and it takes what's hit this person doesn't know god's a healer but he's a healer to you they don't know if they're salva heaven but there's a heaven to you they don't know because you've got it and now you've got it you see it it becomes real to you now you got to remember they don't so you know we're not in the business of going around finding other people who are infected because i can infect you if you've got it this is the only disease that has a reward when you get it every other day's disease has a consequence if you get polio there's a consequence if you get the flu there's a consequence you name every disease that satan has there's a consequence this is the only disease that packs a reward not only does it pack a reward but it's the only disease that packs life every other disease packs death this disease packs eternal life it gets it now i want you to look at yourself and it realize that you've got something because you made contact with something that infected you and now you're infected and because you're infected with faith you are now an authorized spreader not only are you authorized but you're commissioned could you imagine going to school and you know that you've got a real you're really sick and if if anybody comes in contact with you they're gonna get nauseous and they're gonna faint and they're going to fall out and they're going to have to go home from school and and and the principal came to you and said i want you you're commissioned to go into this school and make all the students sick because we want to go on vacation well you'd have to get out and mingle but the trouble with that sickness is you don't feel like you want to mingle you just want to go hide but this is the only life infection that makes you want to mingle makes you want to rub shoulders makes you want to get out there and spread it so it's it's something that that is hid but now you see it it it moved from being hid to a reality to you it's now in evidence it's just as real to you as it could be and and let me say your description your description of the gospel your your description of what it is that you possess the joy the peace the longsuffering the temperance the meekness the helping hand that's there to get you through the thing that delivers you from worry okay and the joy that you have unspeakable your description of it is clear and vivid it's something so plain that that you can express it so plainly it's such a reality to you you're not groping for words you you know what it is you know when you talk about joy that that joy is so vivid to you it's so real to you that even when someone says oh you look kind of down in the dumps oh i'm sorry but down on the inside let me tell you about what's on the inside there's a peace that sir paths understand there's good joy that's deep in there everything else is on the outside all the troubles of the world are in the world again i'm in this world but i'm not of the world i don't have any control over that what's going out now but let me tell you about what though it's infected my heart that's really what's infected my life let's tell me what's got control over me let me tell you about the symptoms that are down on the inside and those symptoms are so real to you and they're so plain to you that you can express them in such a way that they can be seen just as you see it amen and it's real yes sir that's when you know you've infected somebody when they know what you're talking about they see it it's not a mantle it's absolutely something that's real it's real it's really contagious if you could look at it just like the flu just like covet 19 this this infection is john 3 14. john 3 16. yes it's real it is it's it's a reality it's not an intellectual you can never never diagnose this or try to put it in doctrinal categories whether it's god head whether it's this whether it's this doctrine or or that doctrine it just shows you're on the outside you might know all about it but you don't possess any of the symptoms it's like going to a doctor that don't got it and he says well how do you feel well if you've had it you know how i feel i feel just the way you felt when you had it they don't have it you know what they do they take some medicine to kill it but we don't kill this we want it to grow and grow and have a greater effect so because something so real to us that it it's it's so genuine and so what's another word we can use for infected how about quickened right so when you've when you make contact with someone that's got c19 what's happened is it's went from them and taken its abode in you now it's passed from them to you now you you have the symptoms you have the effects do you have it because it it it's been passed so what you we would say that oh i sat down with these people and i heard the testaments oh we had a party or we had a a a reception or we had this and somebody came with it hallelujah wouldn't you just love to have somebody come with that inspiring faith in the church someone come on fire for god someone come prayed up someone come read up because what's going to happen your cup's going to overflow it's going to get on somebody else somebody else that needs it somebody else that doesn't see it or they're not feeling it but it's so real to you it's such an expression to you it's so vivid for you that you make it so clear to them that just by your testimony just by the words that are coming out of your mouth just by what you're expressing you see and you feel the faith that you're walking in you're so you're so caught up in heavenly places that all of a sudden they see that they recognize that they feel it and they say wow this guy's got something and they inquire what's this hope that you have tell me about this where did you get it well i got it one night in a closet i got it down in the altar i got it in a church service one day the spirit was moving i was with a bunch of believers someone had talked to me and i sought it out in my heart and so it it becomes so real so let's talk about this contagious quickening power now why did everybody act the way they acted with masks on staying six feet away you know what i mean i i'm sure that when people drove up and down the street and they saw the sisters hugging one another and their brothers hugging one another they just were thinking oh no the whole world's gonna die no the whole world will live if they get what we've got look look but let's let's watch this contagion at one of the first things it takes away i'm i'm reading out of the message called easter seal and uh and it and this is what he's saying in and i'm just trying to fix uh uh pick up a spot here paragraph 120 says that look god the same when he saw jesus it it was the finished work that god finished with jesus when he said it is finished all the plan was finished so when he said it's finished in other words he said the the it's finished now it can be spread it isn't what do they call these things it's not adjectives but when they got another strain of it you know so they they say oh oh there's another strain of it there's another strain of it we might have to come up with the vaccine there's a no this is finished you get this you got it there ain't another strain there's not another thing that's going to come up there's not that's why when the ministry came in this day it wasn't a new thing it was a restoration of what he infected the or quickened the church with so i want to use the word quickened but i want to try this parallel because i want you to see yourself and then to judge yourself line yourself up to the word so you can really ask yourself have i got the disease because this is one disease you want to have you don't want to be sitting amongst the diseased spiritually or the quickened you want to be quickened so when he saw jesus he said it's finished all the work that i've needed to do was done it's a hundred percent thing what he has and the spirit he has and the life he has that's the life i'm going to put in the church this is the life that will resurrect this is the only life that'll make a difference it'll have an effect that'll produce the resurrection so when he said this is it this is finished what did he do he kept the word of god right to the end he didn't shrink from his responsibility he came face to face with the fact that he was called to die he didn't go back from it he didn't run from it he didn't come up with nothing else he went on the cross he took death didn't have to could have got an army could have got the angels but he took it and when god saw that love he saw that sacrifice he saw those attributes it was everything that he was it was a spirit of god manifested in flesh he says this is finished this is what i want to quicken the church with this is what i want to give them this is what i want to pass on so go to the upper room and i'll send it down so you can have it the same spirit and when the spirit of god come upon you and you truly are one of god's attributes that he spoke of now if you're not you'll you'll wonder and frustrated and run here and there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth sulk if you get it you're anchored okay you're not running to and fro you're solid if you are one of those the old things pass away right quick see and you become new and the plan of salvation is finished you're ready to obey every word that god ever spoke to you see for you to do so you're ready there's things he hasn't spoke to you yet but because you've been quickened you've got in you something that's going to receive every word of god that comes to you and tells you what to do because the work was finished he said if i may you're submissive to his word the contract exactly the abstract to the contract the title deed belongs to you the debts are all paid it's all struck off and as it was at the day of pentecost now let's notice the quickening this quickening spirit on other people now i told you i wouldn't speak very long and i just got 20 minutes to keep my word if i do that notice to keep in what time i said about an hour now notice this quickening power that only comes now there is a lot of mockery of it there's a lot of people that really think they've got it when they haven't a lot of people do it because they have got some false impression of what they seen others christians do so we want to make sure that we're spreading the right thing so you want to make sure you've got it so you're not spreading something that's not now notice the point here is that he said a lot of people have been infected or were contagious by something that really wasn't it because they saw other people and the people claimed it was it but it wasn't now these are this is the time church that we ask ourselves these things this is the time we make full proof of our ministry this is the time that we don't hide within our fellowship but we get personal in our heart he says satan can imperson any of that we know that and as missionaries you can see being personated shouting dancing speaking in tongues and all these things you can see it impersonated anywhere absolutely almost heathens and people who deny there such a thing as jesus christ being the son of god and they do all those things themselves but the real true quickening spirit that comes to a believer quickens him to god's word that's back to eagle food again right back to where he lives oh i wish i could emphasize that it quickened you to eagle food right back to where you live not doctrine not church not theology but that spirit quickly takes the word of god right to where you live so he's dealing with you as an individual not something you join you know when i got sick you know and leslie got sick she didn't look up at me and say do you want some of this no i'll get it myself thank you it's it's real but so what's it going to deal with so if if you join it and you join of thinking or you join a fellowship or you join a doctrine or some great orator comes in with enticing words draws you a picture and you say i i i will join that i will think that way that's an impersonation but this quickening spirit takes the eagle food because you're an eagle and it brings that food to where you're living and makes it personal to you when i look at you you can have a halo and angel wings but the spirit is not going to deal with that he's going to deal with your heart he's going to deal with your mind he's going to deal with your fears let's just carry this out he says the real quickening spirit that comes to a believer quickens him to god's word that's back to eagle food again right back to where he lives man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god now let's notice this quickening spirit as it comes upon other people like it did on the day of pentecost now let's notice pentecost how they acted and see if they were quickened by this quickening power that we're talking about right now what are we supposed to be restored back to to what they were quickened with so now our messenger says let's look at the quickening power let's look at them let's judge them let's see what they went through because now it's a model for us on the day of pentecost they were all waiting up there in themselves they were afraid remember i talked about that's the first thing about we're afraid to get it we're afraid to get it you know there's a lot of people that are afraid to get the holy ghost they want to filter it they just don't want to let it have its way whatever it does however it changes your life they were afraid the jews just what they were going the jews just what they were going to do so they got scared but what happened when this quickening power fell from heaven there was a bravery set upon them there was something and out an understanding where they wasn't so sure of it a few hours before they knowed he had died they know that he had died they know that he had risen they had talked to him on the way but what was that thing for them or was it just for he says but was that thing for them or was it just for them or or for jesus himself now do you understand what he's saying they were afraid they had talked to him they they know he would risen but the question was was it for them were they going to take possession of it that that's the thing the quickening power we know about it we know we've risen you know these things but the question you got down like was it for this person was it for that person or was that just for jesus himself so he rose up from the dead and what he was going to impart to them and quicken to them is not an anointing like pentecost teaches the baptism of the holy spirit what he was giving them was resurrection and life he was going to infect them with the same spirit or quicken in them the same spirit that rose him from the dead so it wasn't a matter whether it was true or whether it was for them or whether it was for them or was it just for jesus as yourself but when they got quickened then they knew that resurrection was for them personally now they had it now they had something that they could spread otherwise they were just telling history stories but now they possessed the quickening what like we referred to as the disease they possessed it they had got it they knew they they they they had received it they he says but here on the day of pentecost the holy spirit the abstract fell on the believer that made them part of his resurrection make him part of his make him part of his fellowship the holy spirit came and confirmed to them that they would be raised up because they were potentially raised then from cowards to brave men okay that's what keeps you where you're not afraid of the world that's right oh it's just so beautiful even the duke had to admit it nicodemus said rabbi we know that you're a teacher come from god no man could do these things you do except god be with him now we know that we recognize that so the disciples peter have even sworn in his presence all of them had forsaken him at the crucifixion but here they are now up in this upper room in the presence of god and all of a sudden here comes his holy spirit down from heaven and it quickened them what's the other word we've been saying it infected them it gave them a new symptom and what was the symptoms they were now brave and it quick and quickening took place he says in heaven and it quickened them and the quickening took place they wasn't afraid to make a witness of the message that they believed and knowed to be the truth otherwise they were afraid of it why you know that's one of the things that we've got to overcome is fear that's what's keeping us from testifying the way we should that's what's keeping us from sharing the promise because we haven't settled in that it's for us and we've come up with all kinds of things that that fear is what produced the nickelodeon spirit [Music] let somebody else do it and we're going to close here he said and of the message that they know to be the truth otherwise they were afraid of it how many presbyterians how many methodists how many baptists in the world today how many pentecostal that knows the truth and are afraid to make a stand on it i'm persuaded to wonder what was that fell on you are you a part of his resurrection would you dare scream off for some man's theory and idea or have you got the real boldness and the real manhood it takes to stand out and call right right and wrong wrong are you a part of his resurrection or are you a worshiper of a bunch of creeds are you a goer to church do you have your name on there and dead in sin and trespasses he that believes not the full word of god is a sinner those pharisees believed in many things to be the truth they said we are god's children and they were until that word was preached but when that word was preached and vindicated then they became sinners for rejecting the thing that they knowed was right and witnessed that we know that that other teacher come from god for no man could do the things that you do without god being with him i wonder today where we're at i ask you where is this resurrection finding us are you dare to step out are you dare to take god at his word if you're ordained to life you sure will do it if you're an eagle you can't help doing it there's something in you or do you want to serve a creed somewhere and say i go to church i'm just as good as you are see if you hold no birthrights you'll never see it you can't see it but if you hold the possession of that birthright you can help seeing it because it's a part of you and you're a part of it you understand it's not something that you can get intellectually you are living your life until he found you and when he found you the word of god came to you and faith came to you and it was passed from faith to faith and that faith came by the word of god and when that faith came that was the quickening power that let you know that you had in you the same life that resurrected him and therefore you're already resurrected so what are we afraid of amen let me tell you let me close with this faith is contagious you can quicken somebody else by the words of your testimony you tape david we listen to the story of david and how he killed goliath well we can just visualize that we hear the story and our faith swells up in us because that faith is contagious get in we hear that story and we visualize it and it's real to us in that faith just swells up in us the story of moses all the bible stories it inspires us and that faith well up in it now take what you've been your experience of being quickened and brought to life not to knowledge to life not not not saved in the sense of being separated from sin but saved in the fact that you've been saved from the second death that you have eternal life because eternal life is a gift of god lest any man should boast that's what you've been quickened with that's what the spirit i am the truth the life the resurrection i am the way the truth the life he told martha i am the resurrection we know he'll rise up he said i am the resurrection i bring life i quicken it echoed church i hope you got the faith disease i hope you're so full of quickening power that it gets on other people i hope you got the boldness and the bravery not to be a coward to stand up and that's our testimony that he lives and because he lives we live also amen so i didn't know i i just thought that i would tell you everybody's so worried about who's scott covet and who's god i just want to let you know that we got faith and it's contagious and we're going to infect as many people as we can come in contact with how many wants to be a super spreader amen god bless you tonight let's stand together faith is contagious hallelujah musicians can come and let us just bow our heads this evening and maybe you'd ask yourself in your heart that and you don't have that blessed assurance you're not just sure and the only way that you can be infected is to come in contact with it and you'd like to say lord i want to be quickened i want your spirit to come by my way and i want you to give me this resurrection life that you gave to the saints on that great pentecostal day when your spirit came down and lord they were cowards hiding but after they received that life and became a part of that resurrection they infected three thousand souls that day but i may not have the opportunity to come in contact with three thousand souls the lord my heart's desire is that i receive it and then i pass it along to someone that i love someone that i care for or may it be such a presence on me such a reality to me that the words of it are so vivid that they can see it and know that it's real father may i infect my children or if i said it this way father may i quicken my children may i quicken my friends may i impart this if a worldly disease can be contagious [Music] how much more a spiritual quickening and lord it spread by contact from one person to another lord i hope this evening that this is a faith building that each believer will know i've got something that i don't have to be afraid of i've got something that i can share and spread and there's people out there father who want it but i've got to give it to him and i want to stand up father i want to be a super spreader faith is contagious it's passed on from one person to another and its symptoms are evident and it brings us in a unity one with another because we've all experienced the peace and the joy that's our paths understanding lord i ask you to bless the people tonight in your precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen let's sing that song i i can't sing it very well but i like it but because i i think this is one thing that if you got covered you would say oh i was so sorry i got this but if you get this you're not sorry you've never been sorry that you got this quickening you've never been sorry you've got faith because faith's the victory right okay let's sing it like that oh i'm so glad to the world it's leprosy but you're going around saying praise god i'm a leopard do you
