[41:03] and humbled to be in your presence this
[41:05] evening to be able to worship You Lord
[41:08] to be able to gather with brothers and
[41:11] sisters that have recognized the message
[41:14] of the hour being able to have
[41:17] fellowship Lord it's such a wonderful
[41:21] time Lord we do not know how long these
[41:25] times might last Lord we we heed your
[41:29] call Lord and we see that these times
[41:31] could be taken away just in a moment
[41:35] so Lord we want to take advantage of the
[41:37] time that we have together Lord may we
[41:40] express not only our love to you but I
[41:42] love to one another
[41:45] Lord you spoke of a time that the Saints
[41:49] would cry just at the thought of having
[41:52] to not see each other for a space of
[41:54] time Lord I believe you're drawing us
[41:57] closer and closer together as that
[42:00] capstone is settling down upon the bride
[42:03] your love Lord you said that they'll
[42:06] know that we are your disciples by our
[42:09] love that we have one for another Lord
[42:12] you said love covers a multitude of sin
[42:15] Lord we thank you for forgiveness
[42:17] tonight
[42:18] we thank you for your Holy Ghost tonight
[42:21] we thank you that you're not slack
[42:24] concerning your promises we believe that
[42:27] you are here you're able that you have
[42:30] come to do something specific for each
[42:32] one of us Lord may this time not slip
[42:35] away from us in vain but Lord may we
[42:37] look with a whole heart to know that you
[42:39] are here to perform your word or we just
[42:42] surrender ourselves to you now we ask
[42:45] that by your Holy Ghost you would come
[42:46] and take complete control of the service
[42:48] more as we dealed ourselves to you as
[42:51] the hearer would yield themselves to you
[42:53] Lord to anoint our lips right there
[42:55] ears to hear more than we asked that
[42:58] you'd break the bread of life as only
[42:59] you can we ask it in your name the Lord
[43:01] Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord I mean
[43:06] if you have your Bibles we'll be reading
[43:07] out of Isaiah 55 verse 11
[43:14] man it's wonderful to see each one of
[43:17] you out to the house of the Lord maybe
[43:29] we'll just read this scripture isaiah
[43:31] 55:11 and then we'll go to Philippians 2
[43:37] 1 so shall my word be that goeth forth
[43:45] out of my mouth shall not return unto me
[43:48] void but it shall accomplish that which
[43:51] I please and it shall prosper and the
[43:55] thing we're unto I sent it that
[44:00] scripture could certainly be expounded
[44:01] upon no matter when the Lord speaks his
[44:05] word it could lay there for hundreds or
[44:07] thousands of years but it's going to
[44:09] come into manifestation and it's going
[44:12] to to make it to the one that it was
[44:15] intended for Philippians 2 1 be reading
[44:26] to verse 9 Philippians 2 1 there be
[44:31] therefore any consolation in Christ if
[44:34] any comfort of love if any fellowship of
[44:37] the Spirit if any bowels and mercies
[44:40] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[44:44] having the same love being of one Accord
[44:47] of one mind let nothing be done through
[44:50] strife or vainglory but in lowliness of
[44:52] mind let us esteem one another better
[44:55] than themselves look not every man on
[45:01] his own things but every man also on the
[45:05] things of others let this mine
[45:09] being you which was also in Christ Jesus
[45:12] who being in the form of God thought it
[45:15] not robbery to be equal with God but
[45:18] made himself of no reputation and took
[45:21] upon in the form of a servant and was
[45:23] made in the likeness of men and being
[45:25] found in the fashion of man he humbled
[45:27] himself and became obedient unto death
[45:29] even the death of the cross
[45:32] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[45:34] him and given him a name which is above
[45:37] every name Amen you may have your seats
[45:41] and just in thinking on this the
[45:46] scripture I was just just seemed like
[45:50] the Lord had placed the the scripture in
[45:53] my mind let this mind be in you which
[45:56] was also in Christ Jesus and maybe for
[46:00] an odd title tonight I just want to
[46:03] speak to you on God's time capsule
[46:05] God's time capsule as this as I just as
[46:12] the Lord placed this scripture into my
[46:14] heart and I was just meditating upon
[46:16] that let this mind be in you which also
[46:19] was in Christ Jesus those words just
[46:21] came to my heart God's time capsule and
[46:23] I I wasn't sure what the Lord was trying
[46:28] to show me and so I first had to find
[46:32] out what a time capsule was by
[46:34] definition and as I looked into the
[46:36] Webster dictionary it says this
[46:38] container holding historical records or
[46:40] objects representative of a current
[46:42] culture that is deposited as in a
[46:45] cornerstone for preservation until
[46:48] discovery by some future age and I just
[46:51] started to in my heart just started to
[46:53] see the mind of the Lord and that
[46:54] because we know that Jesus Christ is the
[46:57] chief Cornerstone and he is the word of
[47:00] God and God is there's things that are
[47:02] laying in the word that God has spoken
[47:04] there's a thought of God that he is
[47:07] expressed and no matter what it's going
[47:09] to come to manifestation and maybe just
[47:12] as I just just expound my heart to you I
[47:16] also want to maybe in the forefront say
[47:19] that you are God's time capsule be
[47:21] God has placed a predestinated seed in
[47:24] your life though you were in the mind of
[47:26] God before the time was ever even spoken
[47:28] into existence but yet God had something
[47:31] that he intended for your life to
[47:33] manifest and so there was a thought
[47:35] concerning you that he had spoken and
[47:37] now this little predestinated seed was
[47:40] sown out there in time until the
[47:42] appointed time had come and then
[47:44] everything that was within that
[47:46] expression or in that word was going to
[47:49] be manifested in the time that God had
[47:51] allotted for it and you know just in as
[47:55] we begin to minister you know we've been
[47:58] kind of thinking along the lines of
[48:01] God's secret place you know in the time
[48:03] of trouble God shall hide me in the
[48:05] secret of his tabernacle you David said
[48:08] there's one thing that I have desired
[48:10] and you're the secret of his Tabernacle
[48:13] was that holy place and you know as we
[48:15] as we minister in this direction you
[48:18] know we want to have that hunger we want
[48:20] to have that desire and that craving
[48:22] that we would come into that secret
[48:24] place because it's in there that we're
[48:26] feeding on the secret things of God and
[48:28] God is making himself known to the
[48:30] believer look this walk is by revelation
[48:33] it's not a one-time revelation it's not
[48:37] a one-time revelation but we need God to
[48:39] continue to reveal himself and continue
[48:42] for his word to unfold and we just don't
[48:45] want to to get complacent be in in
[48:49] recognizing what God has done in this
[48:52] day and then off of that alone go and
[48:56] not realize that there's so much there
[48:58] more laying before us that God is
[49:00] wanting us to manifest and just in this
[49:03] thought that I was looking at on God's
[49:06] time-capsule I started to maybe look at
[49:09] time capsules that have have been found
[49:13] and they they remember the expression is
[49:16] something that is sealed away for a
[49:18] future age and they say there's all kind
[49:21] of time capsules that are buried around
[49:23] Washington DC I guess you know that the
[49:28] thought behind it is is that you you'll
[49:30] take something if we were going to bury
[49:31] a time capsule we would maybe take
[49:33] things that we felt were relevant to our
[49:35] code
[49:35] turn to the signs of the times and then
[49:38] we would bury it in the ground for a
[49:40] future age but I'm telling you don't
[49:41] worry about burying any time capsules
[49:43] because there ain't going to be no
[49:45] future age to dig it up all right but
[49:50] the thought was I believe that Paul
[49:52] Revere he had he a plant he had he had a
[49:55] dug a hole and placed a little container
[49:57] there in Washington DC and I I from what
[50:00] I understand they felt that it was maybe
[50:02] dated or something that he had done that
[50:04] in 1795 of if I remember properly and
[50:08] and oh they they they just dug it up
[50:11] about five years ago and and they
[50:13] started to look at the contents in there
[50:15] and I believe there was like an image of
[50:17] George Washington and and there was some
[50:19] engraving that a written engravement on
[50:23] a little piece of metal that I believe
[50:24] Paul Revere was a metalworker and there
[50:27] was also I think they call it a pion
[50:28] shilling that was I think it was dated
[50:31] from the 1600s or something that was in
[50:34] there and so they could take these
[50:36] artifacts and they could look at him but
[50:38] you know they could only presume what
[50:41] Paul Revere was thinking when he put
[50:43] these things into that cornerstone uh uh
[50:45] you know why did he feel that these
[50:48] things were relative why did he feel
[50:50] that that people - 300 years down the
[50:54] road would even care but he thought that
[50:57] you know what I will I will take these
[50:59] certain items that I'm going to place
[51:00] them in there and then all these were
[51:02] discovered several hundred years later
[51:04] and then these these are experts or
[51:07] whatnot they they look at these things
[51:09] and maybe they try to piece together in
[51:10] their mind what what its relevancy was
[51:13] to the time and you know you could just
[51:15] make the type and the parallel with
[51:17] where we're going and I just was
[51:18] thinking upon a cornerstone that how
[51:21] brother branham when he was laying the
[51:23] cornerstone there and the tabernacle
[51:25] there in 1933 he also I was laying a
[51:28] cornerstone and and there on that
[51:31] morning in 1933 as we've recently spoke
[51:33] about the Prophet was caught up into a
[51:35] vision and in that vision God had shown
[51:39] him that he would be preaching to the to
[51:41] the worlds and he was at one time Eames
[51:44] in the vision he was there at the
[51:45] Tabernacle preaching he was thanking the
[51:47] Lord for the tavern
[51:49] the angel Lord picked him up and put him
[51:51] there and the big blue sky and he said
[51:53] he said he told him that that wasn't the
[51:54] tabernacle but this is your tabernacle
[51:56] because he had a message that was going
[51:58] forth to the world and as he came out of
[52:00] that vision the the the angel of the
[52:02] Lord told him read 2nd Timothy 4 and you
[52:06] know he turned and he turned into his
[52:08] Bible and you know when he started to
[52:10] read 2nd Timothy 4 and it said do the
[52:13] work of evangelist it says I charge thee
[52:17] therefore before God and the Lord Jesus
[52:19] Christ who shall judge the quick and the
[52:20] dead at his appearing and his kingdom
[52:22] preached the word and be instant in
[52:25] season out of season reprove rebuke
[52:27] exhort with all long-suffering and
[52:28] doctrine
[52:29] for the time will come when they will
[52:31] not endure sound doctrine but after
[52:32] their own lusts shall heap to themselves
[52:34] teachers having itching ears and they
[52:36] shall turn away their ears from the
[52:38] truth and shall be turned unto fables
[52:40] but watch thou in all things endure
[52:42] afflictions and do the work of an
[52:44] evangelist make full proof of thy
[52:46] ministry and all that just struck a
[52:48] chord with the prophets heart he says he
[52:50] just ripped it out the page I was out of
[52:52] his valuable and he ate me and he went
[52:54] to lay in there the cornerstone in the
[52:57] tabernacle and he put the that little
[52:59] scripture there in the cornerstone with
[53:01] maybe some other items and they placed
[53:03] it there at the building of the
[53:05] tabernacle because there at that time
[53:07] the Prophet felt you know this this
[53:11] scripture is relevant and I'm going to
[53:13] place this in the cornerstone of the
[53:15] time and I go look that was not just by
[53:18] chance that wasn't just a carnal thing
[53:20] that was done but no was in that same
[53:22] year in 1933 that there at the Ohio
[53:26] River he'd be baptizing there and we're
[53:28] familiar with this testimony that
[53:30] they're a pillar fire came was starred
[53:33] as some would call it and it spoke there
[53:36] and said as John the Baptist for and the
[53:38] first coming of Jesus Christ so shall
[53:40] your ministry for on the second coming
[53:42] of Jesus Christ and there when a
[53:44] ministry out to the world the healing
[53:46] ministry all around and around the globe
[53:49] at wit there for 10 years 20 years just
[53:52] going forth from the power and
[53:54] demonstration of showing that Jesus
[53:56] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[53:58] forever
[53:59] and as you know you think of this now
[54:02] just laying in that cornerstone there
[54:04] was that scripture second Timothy four
[54:06] and you would wonder maybe if somebody
[54:08] if if the Lord was to tarry and time
[54:11] went on and somebody was maybe doing
[54:13] something to the tabernacle who knows
[54:15] maybe it would become a storehouse maybe
[54:17] they would be tearing it down somebody
[54:19] might come upon the contents in there
[54:21] and they would wonder what all of it
[54:23] meant they would wonder why is this even
[54:25] in here but see the only way they would
[54:27] know that if the person who put it in
[54:29] there could come and tell them this is
[54:31] what was happening
[54:33] this is what I was thinking this was the
[54:35] very a hard purpose of why I placed that
[54:38] in there and that's what we've seen now
[54:40] that Christ the true cornerstone which
[54:43] was rejected the word lay in there for
[54:45] generation after generation and men have
[54:48] been pondering and pondering what the
[54:50] word meant to know they've come to
[54:52] interpretations and they've come to
[54:54] false religions and all these things and
[54:56] they've wondered and they've probed that
[54:58] what all these mysteries are laying
[54:59] there in the Bible but all I could say
[55:01] the only way we could have the true
[55:03] revelation is if the word himself came
[55:06] and he started to break the bread of
[55:08] life and it revealed the mysteries that
[55:10] was laying within the word to us then we
[55:12] would have the mind of God then we'd
[55:14] have the thoughts of God we would know
[55:16] what isn't it was we would know what his
[55:18] heart purpose was we would know what his
[55:20] planned before the foundation of the
[55:22] world and why the scriptures were laid
[55:24] in there like they were only if he could
[55:27] come and he would be the one that would
[55:29] break the bread of life and he would be
[55:31] the one to interpret the scripture all
[55:33] then we would know what the mind of God
[55:35] is let this mind be in you that was also
[55:38] in Christ Jesus as I thought upon these
[55:40] things oh I believe it's in this day
[55:42] it's at this age that there's being big
[55:45] things that have been preserved all the
[55:46] way down to this hour that the Lord
[55:48] Jesus Christ has descended with an open
[55:51] book and he has leased the seven seals
[55:53] given the bride of Jesus Christ his mind
[55:56] that you would know what to do with his
[55:58] word oh that's the day and age that
[56:01] we're living in just thinking of the
[56:04] Cornerstone they're laying in the
[56:05] tabernacle even the Prophet that day
[56:09] wouldn't know the whole meaning of the
[56:11] scripture that he'd laid there
[56:14] for there he read the first five verses
[56:16] and believe it was in 1962 God dealt
[56:20] with the prophet's heart there
[56:21] I believe Aberdeen North Carolina was
[56:26] where he was I believe about in May 1962
[56:30] I believe it was the the age of the Lord
[56:33] asked the Prophet to take a brother by
[56:36] the name of Joseph Bossier out into the
[56:37] yard and so he took this brother out
[56:40] into the yard and they were having a
[56:41] little fellowship there and brother
[56:45] Joseph said to brother Branham brother
[56:47] Branham have you ever read the rest of
[56:50] second Timothy four I believe maybe in
[56:53] pertaining to his ministry of pertaining
[56:55] to himself and brother Branham just no I
[56:59] never I never really have and brother
[57:02] Branham starts to explain there as he's
[57:04] preaching I believe present stage of my
[57:06] ministry in September of 1962 he starts
[57:10] to show that look I never I never read
[57:13] of the rest of 2nd Timothy 4 he said he
[57:16] said the first part that part that he
[57:19] had ripped out the very reason he had
[57:20] placed that there in the tabernacle
[57:22] there in 1933 those first five verses he
[57:25] says that's been fulfilled tonight that
[57:28] work has been done but oh now he was
[57:30] entering in to another part of his
[57:33] ministry he starts to talk about a
[57:35] climax in his ministry the first pool
[57:37] has gone forth the second pull his mouth
[57:39] Lord and hear something was laying in
[57:41] the word but it was laying there until a
[57:44] time that it was going to be revealed
[57:46] it was sealing that own it was a mystery
[57:49] maybe laying right there for the
[57:50] prophets life but now as it moves on
[57:52] down and his ministry is unfolding first
[57:55] pull second pull now in 1962
[57:57] oh there's coming a crowning of his
[57:59] ministry what is it it's those mysteries
[58:02] it's those Ponder's it's the loosening
[58:04] of the seven seals it's that third pull
[58:06] it's revealing trashed oh there was
[58:08] something there laying in the word until
[58:10] an appointed time it had been sealed
[58:12] away from the ages
[58:14] all the mystery that had been hidden
[58:16] through the ages but now is coming forth
[58:18] to the crowning time of the prophet and
[58:20] we know that a prophet is the divine
[58:22] learn the word of the Lord comes through
[58:25] the Prophet and that's where we receive
[58:27] the mind of Christ it's from a
[58:29] vindicated messenger that God my strips
[58:32] are ordained according to a divine
[58:33] promise of revelations 10-7 said at the
[58:36] sounding of the seventh angel message
[58:38] when he shall begin to sound all the
[58:40] mysteries of God will be finished Oh
[58:42] have you been come under the headship of
[58:44] the message that has been delivered in
[58:46] the seventh age you can know the very
[58:48] mind of God Oh hallelujah thank God for
[58:52] his promises
[58:53] thank you thought worst truth there the
[58:57] learned had gone forth God had spoke the
[58:59] word had been written there in the
[59:00] scripture some 2,000 years ago laying
[59:03] there but he said my words shall go
[59:08] forth said my word shall go forth you
[59:15] bring that up isaiah 55:11 for me so
[59:24] shall my word be that goes forth out of
[59:26] my mouth 2000 years ago it's not going
[59:30] to return to me void if I said behold I
[59:33] send you Elijah the prophet there is
[59:36] going to be a you to receive the Elijah
[59:38] the Prophet it was spoken over 2,000
[59:42] years ago all the soul shall my word be
[59:44] that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[59:46] shall not return unto me boy learning
[59:48] shall accomplish that which I please and
[59:51] what did he want to accomplish if we had
[59:55] time to go down that way God wanted to
[59:57] accomplish a bride he wanted to
[1:00:00] accomplish a bride that wasn't like Eve
[1:00:03] he wanted to have a bride that was bone
[1:00:06] of my bone and flesh of my flesh that
[1:00:08] would reject the devil's lies that would
[1:00:12] say no to all the lady you'll see itami
[1:00:14] nonsense out there tommyrot somebody the
[1:00:17] Prophet would call it all that would
[1:00:19] look to him and him the word only hey
[1:00:21] that was God's great achievement is that
[1:00:25] he would Shiva brown and how does he do
[1:00:28] it he doesn't by his word and now our
[1:00:31] part to play and it is to believe him
[1:00:33] and take him at his word and say yeah
[1:00:35] amen to every word that proceedeth out
[1:00:38] of the mouth of God that's how we live
[1:00:41] man don't live by bread alone but by
[1:00:43] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:00:45] mouth of God oh do you start to think of
[1:00:48] the things that have been spoken
[1:00:49] concerning you the things that God wants
[1:00:52] to achieve all these things we've heard
[1:00:58] for years a bride without spot or
[1:01:01] wrinkle your you justify you never did
[1:01:06] it in the first place his word has gone
[1:01:09] forth it is not going to return unto Him
[1:01:12] void it's going to be manifested in the
[1:01:16] lives that the names have been put in
[1:01:18] the Lamb's Book of Life and look when
[1:01:21] that when the devil tries to fight you
[1:01:24] on that and tries to point to your life
[1:01:26] and tries to point to you the way of
[1:01:28] living don't look at yourself you pull
[1:01:30] him right back to the word we overcome
[1:01:33] just like Jesus over time it is written
[1:01:37] it is written he said he said he doesn't
[1:01:41] say you overcome by you know what I did
[1:01:42] a really good job yesterday I did a
[1:01:44] really good job the last three months
[1:01:46] I've been a really good job the last
[1:01:48] three years you know I'm really proud of
[1:01:50] myself if you want to go to a religious
[1:01:52] a way of serving the Lord that's exactly
[1:01:55] what the devil wants to offer you
[1:01:56] he wants to beguile you in your mind
[1:01:58] into you thinking that there's something
[1:02:01] that you can do to earn salvation I'm
[1:02:03] here to tell you by the Lord of Lord
[1:02:05] there's nothing you can do to water
[1:02:08] salvation
[1:02:09] salvation is the grace of God it is a
[1:02:11] gift of God that's any market most all
[1:02:14] that is salvation so I want to tell you
[1:02:16] tonight if the Lord could just bring you
[1:02:18] some deliverance I don't care how far
[1:02:20] you've gone I don't care how far you've
[1:02:22] got I don't care the terrible things
[1:02:24] that you've done oh it's not by works
[1:02:26] that you wore salvation it is by the
[1:02:29] grace of God and what we do is we
[1:02:32] identify with the sacrifice we say Lord
[1:02:35] forgive me for the things that I've done
[1:02:36] may the bleach blood of Jesus tries to
[1:02:39] be applied to my life and when you do
[1:02:42] that you're justified
[1:02:46] what's in that's how powerful the blood
[1:02:49] is what's in you don't have to pray the
[1:02:57] same amount of prayers the sins you did
[1:03:02] sin doesn't compete with the Word of God
[1:03:06] we're not Catholics we don't do penton's
[1:03:10] Matthew yes this is for your sins today
[1:03:13] you need to pray 430 times and today
[1:03:16] you're gonna write it on the chalkboard
[1:03:18] and when you're done you're forgiven no
[1:03:21] no look that you're the reason Jesus
[1:03:24] Christ came to Calvary had even died
[1:03:26] because he placed your name of a Lamb's
[1:03:29] Book of Life
[1:03:30] before the foundation of the law and it
[1:03:32] was his whole intent and purpose to come
[1:03:35] and take your place for everything that
[1:03:38] you had ever done and when you come in
[1:03:40] contact with that bleach of the blood of
[1:03:42] Jesus Christ sin is annihilated the
[1:03:45] prophets head its goal it goes all the
[1:03:46] way back and it's stuck on your accuser
[1:03:49] oh how do you like that devil you're
[1:03:51] gonna be the one to burn in hell for all
[1:03:52] the things you thought you made me do
[1:03:54] that's the gospel oh what a victory you
[1:03:58] ever catch a revelation of justification
[1:04:00] always set your spirit free so you can
[1:04:03] just start to soar in the Havanese and
[1:04:05] heavenly places in Christ Jesus you can
[1:04:07] be freed from that burden of sin and
[1:04:09] know that if he said it I believe it oh
[1:04:12] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:04:22] well we have to stick with the word we
[1:04:28] have so much intellectual religion in
[1:04:31] this day people adding to the word
[1:04:33] people taking away from the word you
[1:04:37] know we have so much religion even
[1:04:40] inside the message with people's
[1:04:43] interpretations and they go out on this
[1:04:45] limb and they go out on that limb a
[1:04:47] brother branham said in the the church
[1:04:50] age book he said in the last stage we've
[1:04:52] come back to the capstone revelation
[1:04:54] which is the most important revelation
[1:04:56] of the Godhead in the whole Bible
[1:04:57] we've just been fellowshiping on these
[1:04:59] things and just thinking of how in our
[1:05:02] day we know that the lamb has come forth
[1:05:04] to claim the book and there he's come
[1:05:06] forth to claim the book and there's
[1:05:08] these thoughts and and my some ministers
[1:05:10] preach it this way some some maybe I
[1:05:12] preach it that way and start to to
[1:05:14] wonder and ponder adda how the lamb has
[1:05:16] left the mercy seat and as their mercy
[1:05:19] anymore and if you go back and
[1:05:20] fellowship with with brothers that were
[1:05:22] there back in the in the in the 60s
[1:05:25] there in the 70s and oh am I such a
[1:05:27] sobering time and I want to say that it
[1:05:29] should still be a sobering time but my
[1:05:32] you start to think of this of what was
[1:05:34] really accomplished when the lamb came
[1:05:36] forth for redemption rights he came and
[1:05:38] took the book that was in the hand of
[1:05:40] him on the throne that book he took it
[1:05:42] and then he opened the book and he
[1:05:44] loosed the seals thereof and you look at
[1:05:47] this what is taking place here brother
[1:05:49] Branham says in the first seal that all
[1:05:51] of these people I'll just read it here
[1:05:54] it says he's talking about them going
[1:05:57] through the tribulation now we're we're
[1:05:59] just linking this with the blood of
[1:06:00] Jesus Christ
[1:06:01] if you've pled the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:03] the bleach of that the blood of Jesus
[1:06:06] Christ annihilates sin and so in this
[1:06:10] thought here of why would the church go
[1:06:13] through tribulation the Prophet is
[1:06:14] showing that if you have pleaded the
[1:06:17] blood of Jesus Christ and you've
[1:06:19] received the truth of the hour of the
[1:06:22] blood of Jesus Christ you have been
[1:06:23] forgiven and you are justified and the
[1:06:26] argument of denominations and some
[1:06:29] churches is that know that you still
[1:06:32] have to go through tribulation with the
[1:06:34] Prophet clearly
[1:06:35] shows why would you have to go through a
[1:06:37] tribulation the tribulation is a time
[1:06:39] for purging it's a time that you go
[1:06:42] through for purging and if you've come
[1:06:44] in contact with the blood of Jesus
[1:06:46] Christ
[1:06:46] what are you being purged for and the
[1:06:49] Prophet makes this statement there in
[1:06:51] the first seal he says they thought they
[1:06:53] were under the blood
[1:06:55] he says the purging of the trial the
[1:06:58] tribulation because they're not actually
[1:07:00] under the blood backing up they say they
[1:07:03] go through the purging of the trial of
[1:07:05] the tribulation because they're not
[1:07:07] actually under the blood they claim they
[1:07:10] are but they're not that's the prophets
[1:07:14] word how can they go through a trial to
[1:07:19] purify them when the bleach blood of
[1:07:22] Jesus Christ takes every symptom of sin
[1:07:25] and stuff away from you and you are
[1:07:27] already dead and your life is hid in him
[1:07:31] through God and sealed in there by the
[1:07:35] Holy Ghost now let's just move down the
[1:07:38] line a little bit to just make a little
[1:07:41] progress the scripture says in 1st John
[1:07:43] 1:7 it says but if we walk in the light
[1:07:46] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[1:07:49] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:07:52] Christ cleanses us from all sin so it's
[1:07:57] important that you have to recognize
[1:07:59] your day and its message many people
[1:08:02] recognize the day they're living in
[1:08:04] alrigth uh denominational world and I
[1:08:07] don't even think you have to be a
[1:08:08] Christian to recognize this things at
[1:08:09] the end when people like managed the end
[1:08:12] of the world as we know it people have
[1:08:14] lost their minds we've put laws in order
[1:08:17] so that criminals could legally wear
[1:08:20] masks and loot stores and go out in the
[1:08:23] public and not be identified it just
[1:08:26] looks it just is such a strange peculiar
[1:08:29] time that we're living in but you can
[1:08:31] recognize the day you're living it but
[1:08:33] we must recognize the message many
[1:08:36] people recognize the endtime but we must
[1:08:38] recognize the light of God's gospel at
[1:08:41] the end time and just reading out of the
[1:08:43] indictment I just want to maybe show
[1:08:45] something where brother Branham is going
[1:08:48] to show
[1:08:48] as as this exodus from Judaism into
[1:08:52] Christianity as we would say that the
[1:08:55] law was a type in a shadow the law was
[1:08:58] given as a type for when the anti-type
[1:09:01] came it was a shadow and brother Branham
[1:09:04] says now and the indictment he says now
[1:09:06] in Christ is God's provided land notice
[1:09:10] how appropriate it was now showing that
[1:09:12] Jerusalem was ceasing when it wasn't in
[1:09:17] fact it was in effect until that hour
[1:09:20] the blood of the Lamb was alright until
[1:09:23] that day but now at the crucifixion it
[1:09:26] changes the old systems is done there
[1:09:32] was a new one and the lamb was at the
[1:09:36] sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb
[1:09:39] was on the ground speaking of Christ
[1:09:41] they were condemning and doing the very
[1:09:45] thing that they had to do that's right
[1:09:47] God be blessed for seeing this wonderful
[1:09:50] heavenly light in this last day so the
[1:09:53] prophets about to make a transition here
[1:09:54] he's showing how there was a change in a
[1:09:56] dispensation how the law had been given
[1:09:59] by God and it was in effect until Jesus
[1:10:03] Christ who was to fulfill all the law
[1:10:05] and condemned sin in the flesh the law
[1:10:08] was given until the time that the true
[1:10:11] lamb would come and that when the true
[1:10:13] lamb would come then there would be a
[1:10:15] changing in the dispensation he says God
[1:10:18] be blessed
[1:10:18] for us seeing this wonderful heavenly
[1:10:20] light in this day showing that there's
[1:10:22] another a change here because the
[1:10:25] churches is doing the same thing today
[1:10:26] until the hour that organization
[1:10:29] religion is condemned and proved to be
[1:10:32] sacrificing Christ lured from then on it
[1:10:35] comes the word and the word only from
[1:10:38] the old Paschal Lamb passed away and
[1:10:40] Christ become a lamb at the day of
[1:10:43] crucifixion and the day that the
[1:10:46] denomination crucified the Word of God
[1:10:49] and accepted a creed instead of the word
[1:10:52] that's the day the word come into full
[1:10:56] effect that's just been here recently so
[1:11:01] if you looked at
[1:11:02] the type here brother branham is
[1:11:03] pointing out here at this exodus from
[1:11:06] the law that here they had been the God
[1:11:09] that established the tabernacle in the
[1:11:11] temple and he'd go into the outer courts
[1:11:13] and then you could you could progress
[1:11:15] there into the holy place and then
[1:11:17] behind the holiest of Holies there was
[1:11:19] the Shekinah glory where the high
[1:11:20] priests would go once a year and atone
[1:11:23] with the sacrificial lamb for the sins
[1:11:26] of the priests and for the people once a
[1:11:27] year and that was in tight of the true
[1:11:30] lamb that was going to come but now when
[1:11:33] Christ the word hufa was fulfilling all
[1:11:35] the laws I hadn't spoken now he had come
[1:11:38] and he was there he says he was on the
[1:11:41] ground and there at the crucifixion what
[1:11:43] happened god rent the veil in the temple
[1:11:46] in the proper sense what was it doing it
[1:11:48] was showing the world the real mercy
[1:11:51] state it was showing to the people but a
[1:11:54] real mercy see look you've been doing
[1:11:56] this as a type and as a shadow for so
[1:11:59] long but now I'm tearing the balance
[1:12:02] showing you that Jesus Christ the lamb
[1:12:04] the sacrificial lamb
[1:12:05] he has come and he has paid the price
[1:12:08] for sin he is the mercy seat so no
[1:12:11] longer was the old order gonna work
[1:12:14] anymore there was no mercy on that old
[1:12:17] mercy seat because now the true mercy
[1:12:20] seat Jesus Christ had come and he there
[1:12:23] he was he was lifted up there on Calvary
[1:12:26] to draw all men unto Him there was the
[1:12:28] true mercy seat hang in there and now
[1:12:30] the Prophet is showing mine
[1:12:32] he's showing that what has happened in
[1:12:34] our day the word has come once again and
[1:12:38] proving that it's the same yesterday
[1:12:40] today and forever but there's been
[1:12:42] available of tradition there's been a
[1:12:44] veil of unbelief there's been a veil
[1:12:46] that's been put over the eyes of the
[1:12:48] people and they have not been able to
[1:12:50] see him it's been veiled to him but he's
[1:12:53] showing what happens in this change of
[1:12:55] this dispensation as he says the early
[1:12:58] guy me says the lamb was on
[1:13:00] well I could say that I see he's
[1:13:01] preaching this the lamb was on the
[1:13:03] grounds again he had come with an open
[1:13:06] book in hand to loose the seven seals
[1:13:08] there was true mercy as that capsule was
[1:13:11] descending they say grace
[1:13:13] granny's grace you never did it in the
[1:13:16] first place you are justified oh there
[1:13:18] was the truth Marcy see coming to the
[1:13:21] Gentiles revealing himself to his bride
[1:13:24] and the veil of traditions have been
[1:13:26] ripped it had been torn away and there
[1:13:29] was showing Jesus Christ the same
[1:13:32] yesterday today and forever according to
[1:13:35] a divine promise he said as it was in
[1:13:37] the days of Noah so shall it be of the
[1:13:40] days of the revealing of the Son of Man
[1:13:43] all that Scripture was laying there a
[1:13:46] long time it was laying there a long
[1:13:51] time like a little time capsule sealed
[1:13:53] up just moving right on down the time
[1:13:57] until the hour for the contents and for
[1:14:01] the truth that were locked up in there
[1:14:04] to be revealed oh thank you lord
[1:14:20] John 6:63 says it is the spirit that
[1:14:23] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[1:14:26] the words that I speak unto you they are
[1:14:29] spirit and they are alive the message
[1:14:35] that we have received it is spirit and
[1:14:38] it is life if you could look past the
[1:14:42] veil and see that it's God's word being
[1:14:45] manifested a divine promise that God had
[1:14:49] ordained that he would come to the
[1:14:51] Gentiles proving that he's the same
[1:14:53] yesterday today and forever and he would
[1:14:55] speak words of life oh he would speak
[1:14:58] words of life and he says it's the word
[1:15:01] and the word only his word is bringing
[1:15:04] forth life and Paul said in second
[1:15:06] Corinthians 4:7 but we have this
[1:15:08] treasure in earthen vessels that the
[1:15:12] excellency of the power may be of God
[1:15:14] and not of us oh we have this treasure
[1:15:17] that very things that he's speaking of
[1:15:19] the very things that the prophets spoke
[1:15:21] of the very manifestation in the very
[1:15:23] life the very Holy Ghost it's in an army
[1:15:25] earthen vessels it's in your skin oh
[1:15:28] praise God for the truth praise God for
[1:15:31] the revelation praise God that he saw
[1:15:33] fit to call my name I like how the
[1:15:37] Prophet there at spoken word as the
[1:15:39] original CD says the word is in the
[1:15:41] bride and she knows what to do with it
[1:15:45] she has thus saith the Lord or she
[1:15:47] stands still oh my we have this treasure
[1:15:50] in earthen vessels the very word that
[1:15:52] God sent the very thing he wanted to
[1:15:54] achieve in the last days there's a bride
[1:15:56] right here feeding on the word riping in
[1:15:59] the presence of the son going to
[1:16:01] manifest these very things that was
[1:16:02] spoken but we know that God is wanting
[1:16:05] to reveal the very secrets of his heart
[1:16:09] to his bride just reading out of
[1:16:13] Colossians 1:25 says wherefore I am made
[1:16:18] a minister according to the dispensation
[1:16:20] of God which is given to me for you to
[1:16:22] fulfill the Word of God even the mystery
[1:16:25] which has been hidden
[1:16:26] the ages and from generations but has
[1:16:30] now made manifest to his Saints to
[1:16:31] god would make known what is the riches
[1:16:34] of the glory of the mystery among the
[1:16:36] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[1:16:40] of glory the prophet says this was as
[1:16:43] text for christ the mystery of God
[1:16:45] revealed and reading from that message
[1:16:46] he says now God had a purpose and a
[1:16:49] hidden mystery that's what I want to
[1:16:51] speak onto the church this morning the
[1:16:53] hidden mystery of God that he had in his
[1:16:55] mind before the world ever began and how
[1:16:58] that it's unfolded itself right down to
[1:17:02] the present hour that we're living my
[1:17:04] what a statement the entire Bible just
[1:17:07] skipping down a little further the
[1:17:09] entire Bible is the revelation of God's
[1:17:14] mystery in Christ the entire Bible is an
[1:17:18] expression of one goal that God had Wow
[1:17:23] that's a big statement one purpose he
[1:17:27] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[1:17:30] and all the acts of all the believers in
[1:17:34] the Bible has been in type and
[1:17:40] expressing what God's great role is in
[1:17:43] now and the last day he has revealed it
[1:17:47] and shows it one goal let think of the
[1:17:52] emphasis the Prophet is putting here now
[1:17:55] he says the entire Bible is an
[1:17:57] expression of one goal that God had one
[1:18:01] purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:18:02] entire Bible I tell you I'd be like what
[1:18:05] age is that I want to be there if God
[1:18:09] had one goal and one thing he was one
[1:18:11] Express and all the acts of all the
[1:18:13] believers down through the whole Bible
[1:18:15] and everything was leading up to one
[1:18:16] purpose and one thing that God wanted to
[1:18:18] achieve those were all in type with
[1:18:22] God's great goal is in now in the last
[1:18:24] days he has revealed it and shows it we
[1:18:29] could stop down on a little bit to talk
[1:18:31] about what we received in our day but I
[1:18:33] just want to say this is not a way of
[1:18:35] thinking this is not something you mimic
[1:18:38] this is not something that you can you
[1:18:40] can sit down and collectively people
[1:18:42] together but this is the revelation of
[1:18:45] Jesus Christ personally to you prophets
[1:18:49] say we should pray for revelation I
[1:18:52] would encourage you to pray for
[1:18:54] Revelation and pray O God reveal this
[1:18:57] water to me there's so many things oh if
[1:19:00] I understand a thousandth of a percent I
[1:19:03] don't even know but oh god I know
[1:19:04] there's so much more for me and planning
[1:19:07] for Revelation Lord that this revelation
[1:19:09] would continue to unfold to me on a
[1:19:12] personal level Lord can reveal yourself
[1:19:15] to me but you know people will carry the
[1:19:19] message in their mind for years you you
[1:19:24] can I mean you could walk somebody
[1:19:27] through Scripture and through the Bible
[1:19:30] and through that I look there's tons of
[1:19:31] witnesses and testimonies to vindicate
[1:19:33] what God has done in this hour just
[1:19:35] depends on what you're looking at but if
[1:19:39] you can get somebody and get them to
[1:19:41] look at all these things and you can
[1:19:42] talk them through it man you get a group
[1:19:43] of people that's on fire for the Lord
[1:19:45] and everything like yeah this is what
[1:19:47] God's doing they can get excited they
[1:19:50] can actually accept the message in their
[1:19:52] mind and they will walk with it for
[1:19:54] years and then they can actually get
[1:19:57] stimulated although they can get excited
[1:19:59] they can go to the church meetings they
[1:20:01] can jump up and down I remember one
[1:20:03] brother oh man he was up on the platform
[1:20:05] and and they were rejoicing and
[1:20:07] everything is somebody through a message
[1:20:09] book and he did it through a message
[1:20:12] book and it was flying through the air
[1:20:13] and the sky was rejoicing it land in his
[1:20:15] hand and oh it took off to the hills I
[1:20:18] got the message I got the message all of
[1:20:20] the greatest thing that ever happened
[1:20:22] his life nowhere to be found
[1:20:24] he actually was stands the message had
[1:20:27] because it was something that had come
[1:20:29] on their intellect and it's something
[1:20:31] that could come on their mind and as we
[1:20:35] as I've been thinking about the order of
[1:20:37] the tabernacle the Devi said one thing I
[1:20:39] haven't desired is the dwell in the
[1:20:41] house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:20:43] life but David didn't stop there David
[1:20:46] didn't stop just welling in the house of
[1:20:48] the Lord because oh you can enter into
[1:20:50] the tabernacle there you can come in the
[1:20:53] east
[1:20:54] and then at the altar he could be in
[1:20:55] outer courts and there they were doing
[1:20:57] the just the regular in workings of the
[1:21:00] tabernacle there with the priests and
[1:21:02] accepting sacrifice and everything you
[1:21:05] could come in there it wasn't that
[1:21:06] limited many people have been in there
[1:21:09] and seen what it was like and you could
[1:21:10] look around and you could know what it
[1:21:12] was like to be there in the inner court
[1:21:13] but then as you progressed a little
[1:21:16] further if you went into the holy place
[1:21:19] all you've gone a little further now
[1:21:22] you've come into the error that the
[1:21:24] seven golden candlesticks are the
[1:21:26] priests will come in there to offer the
[1:21:28] prayers and there's the table of
[1:21:29] showbread oh you've come in a little
[1:21:32] further maybe if you want to look at it
[1:21:34] like first pull second pool but Davis
[1:21:37] said one thing have I desired
[1:21:39] it's a dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:21:41] all the days of my life were in the time
[1:21:43] of trouble he shall hide me in the
[1:21:45] secret of his Tabernacle you see these
[1:21:48] people all Miller into God but they they
[1:21:51] when they cut the the message
[1:21:53] intellectually when they thought maybe
[1:21:57] it just on their flesh and and maybe
[1:21:59] they've gone stimulated oh when the
[1:22:01] times and the troubles and the hard
[1:22:03] things come there's not something there
[1:22:05] to keep them what David said all I want
[1:22:10] to go into the secret place I want to
[1:22:12] tell you as the believer if you can move
[1:22:14] past the intellectual thinking and even
[1:22:18] move past just a little stimulation on
[1:22:20] your flashes a little hallelujah praise
[1:22:23] God revelations 10 seven and you can
[1:22:26] enter in into that secret place into
[1:22:29] that Shekinah glory where God reveals
[1:22:32] himself to you and you come into a union
[1:22:35] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:37] oh the seas can rage the students can
[1:22:42] come ona seem like you're at your wits
[1:22:44] in and you're going to die but there's
[1:22:47] an anchor you know you've met God you
[1:22:52] know you've been on those sacred sands
[1:22:54] on the backside of the desert that's
[1:22:57] where God had to take Moses but Moses
[1:23:02] intellectually we all think men well I
[1:23:05] see what God's doing
[1:23:07] flouted Moses on down the Riveter raised
[1:23:09] him right there in the house of Pharaoh
[1:23:10] he gots the kingdom and all the armies
[1:23:12] that is disposal this is just maybe a
[1:23:14] clean sweep
[1:23:15] good plan God no no God doesn't need our
[1:23:20] ability God doesn't need the help of man
[1:23:24] God said you know what Moses I'm gonna
[1:23:27] send you on the backside of the desert
[1:23:28] I'm gonna take out all of your intellect
[1:23:30] all of your reasoning all your ability
[1:23:35] so then you're dependent on me and me
[1:23:37] alone and nobody gets you to that place
[1:23:40] you know what he tells you I don't need
[1:23:42] any of your ability and I don't need any
[1:23:45] of your excuses right now but lord I
[1:23:50] can't talk I can't talk right I stutter
[1:23:51] when I talk you know I'm gonna old man
[1:23:53] look at me I mean my wife she gots a
[1:23:55] temper I mean what am I gonna go do I've
[1:23:57] seen the armies down there like I
[1:23:58] mustn't take somebody else or look I
[1:24:01] don't need your ability oh that's that
[1:24:03] what's so wonderful about that message
[1:24:04] perfect strength the perfect weakness
[1:24:06] look God doesn't meet our ability and he
[1:24:08] don't meet your excuses stop making
[1:24:11] excuses that Gamble is just giving you
[1:24:13] excuses so you don't manifest who you
[1:24:15] really are I don't care how many times
[1:24:18] you've fallen I don't care how many
[1:24:20] times you've get it up here gone your
[1:24:23] time capsule he put that word inside of
[1:24:26] you and he's protecting that seed cream
[1:24:29] all the way down to the lady Elsie and
[1:24:31] all the potential that God has placed in
[1:24:35] that seed it's being loosed in the
[1:24:37] seventh chart egg to manifest everything
[1:24:40] that has been spoken of the bride oh
[1:24:42] praise God
[1:24:44] Oh Lord oh God you might have your ups
[1:24:52] and downs you might be down and out you
[1:24:57] might feel like nothing's going right
[1:24:59] you might feel that your home life is a
[1:25:04] wreck you might feel your family life's
[1:25:06] done you might feel your jobs done
[1:25:08] that's we go through we go through
[1:25:10] seasons some longer than others maybe
[1:25:13] you feel like you've been in a winter
[1:25:14] season your whole life but as the Lord
[1:25:17] was clicking in that scripture sin will
[1:25:19] not have
[1:25:20] minion over you that is thus saith the
[1:25:24] Lord sin will not have dominion over you
[1:25:27] blessed is the man in whom God will not
[1:25:31] impute sin
[1:25:32] that's not something you did that's
[1:25:36] something he said we just believe it and
[1:25:40] watch the manifestation take over our
[1:25:42] being glory to God my when you when you
[1:25:52] realize that you're in possession as our
[1:25:55] pastor was talking about you are in
[1:25:58] possession of the promise the promise
[1:26:01] has been given to you that abstract
[1:26:03] title deed that our pastor was talking
[1:26:04] about oh when you get that when you when
[1:26:09] you have the Holy Ghost let me just read
[1:26:11] this from the Prophet he says in force
[1:26:14] then we have the privilege to enforce a
[1:26:17] plan Satan the claims that God give us
[1:26:20] for God has a law and his word is the
[1:26:25] law and God in this word made a certain
[1:26:28] claims to the church therefore we have a
[1:26:31] right to force these claims upon Satan
[1:26:35] and say give it back and he has to do it
[1:26:40] because we can take God's agent the Holy
[1:26:43] Spirit go right down on our knees and
[1:26:46] say it's thus saith the Lord he's got to
[1:26:50] give it up
[1:26:50] that's all because the Holy Spirit's
[1:26:53] there to make him do it look the Holy
[1:26:56] Spirit is the enforcer you have a right
[1:27:01] according to the word if if a brother
[1:27:04] can have this car stolen drove all the
[1:27:08] way out there for the meetings to be in
[1:27:09] the means with brother Branham if
[1:27:10] somebody stole his car they got down on
[1:27:12] their knees and they prayed and the Holy
[1:27:15] Spirit went on down the road and
[1:27:16] convicted the person that stole that
[1:27:19] color daddy I can't remember he just
[1:27:22] drove it back to a spot and got out but
[1:27:24] the car they found the car with just
[1:27:26] enough gas to get back if God can do
[1:27:28] that for a vehicle that was stolen he
[1:27:33] said we have
[1:27:34] right to save you the demo tonight get
[1:27:36] it back so what about your joy what
[1:27:40] about your peace what about the joy of
[1:27:42] your salvation that the dentist trying
[1:27:44] to rob you from I say you should say no
[1:27:47] huh get it back you can't have a devil
[1:27:50] you that's been worrying about your
[1:27:52] family and your sons and your daughters
[1:27:54] that may be seen what way would you say
[1:27:56] get it back you can't have it I have a
[1:27:58] divine promise according to the Word of
[1:28:01] God you just stay right there you keep
[1:28:03] standing upon the promises for your
[1:28:05] healing for your loved ones for your
[1:28:06] family members you say get it back it's
[1:28:09] mine the scripture says in Ephesians 4
[1:28:13] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[1:28:15] whereby ye are sealed until the day of
[1:28:19] redemption glory to God where time
[1:28:22] capsules Church we're God's time capsule
[1:28:27] there's two parts to that is word and
[1:28:30] then the receivers of that word my what
[1:28:38] a what a glorious thing maybe a simple
[1:28:42] thought I know we hear it many times but
[1:28:45] I don't about you but I need to I didn't
[1:28:47] know who I am cuz I go wandering around
[1:28:50] out there on a daily and and it can be
[1:28:53] hard but it's good to be reminded know
[1:28:57] Lord's telling you I love you you can do
[1:28:59] it it's alright I know you failed I know
[1:29:02] you made a mistake but I'm here for you
[1:29:04] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:29:05] and then who are in Jesus Christ so the
[1:29:09] devil keeps trying to heat that on the
[1:29:11] reason we have condemnation and that
[1:29:12] connection because we don't have any
[1:29:13] confidence in God just please the blood
[1:29:15] just come back just come back to where
[1:29:17] you left and that's all you have to do

[1:29:25] go slay some Giants let's go let's go
[1:29:27] get back to work as our pastor I'm
[1:29:29] looking forward to that if Lord will and
[1:29:31] if he would lead we'll just look for a
[1:29:33] place to finish here really quick but oh
[1:29:36] you realize that grieve not the Holy
[1:29:38] Spirit whereby you are sealed until the
[1:29:41] day of your Redemption look that Holy
[1:29:44] Ghost is there
[1:29:46] manifesting everything all the
[1:29:48] potentials that God has placed inside of
[1:29:50] you look you're an eternal being you
[1:29:54] know that you're in the tournament you
[1:29:55] came from God you're going back to God
[1:29:58] so I don't care the prophet talks about
[1:30:01] look you can I don't care if you bury me
[1:30:02] in the scene I don't care if if you burn
[1:30:06] me at the stake I don't care if I you
[1:30:08] feed me to the Lions if that spirit if
[1:30:11] that Satan spirit that was in Jesus
[1:30:13] Christ dwelling you it will quicken your
[1:30:16] mortal body I don't care if you're
[1:30:18] laying at the bottom of the ocean I
[1:30:19] don't care if you've been burnt at the
[1:30:21] stake or you've been fed the lives oh
[1:30:23] one of these glorious mornings you're
[1:30:25] going to rise you're gonna rise in that
[1:30:27] great resurrection when the Trump of God
[1:30:29] sounds and we're all gathered together
[1:30:31] with him in the air and for us that are
[1:30:34] alive and remain we will not hinder
[1:30:36] those that asleep why because there's
[1:30:38] something that is sealed within these
[1:30:41] vessels were sealed until the day of our
[1:30:43] redemption the Prophet says and remember
[1:30:53] this is out of the rising of the Sun and
[1:30:55] remember we are flesh of his flesh Jesus
[1:30:57] Christ we are flesh of his flesh and
[1:31:00] bone of his bones oh there's no way out
[1:31:03] of it we're going to rise that's all
[1:31:05] you're going to rise Easter means more
[1:31:09] than just a tradition it also is now it
[1:31:12] is also now for our bodies are quickened
[1:31:15] with him and we're sitting in heavenly
[1:31:17] places and this body may rot in the sea

[1:31:22] be even a spoonful of ashes but she is
[1:31:24] coming forth for the spirit that raised
[1:31:27] up my Lord from the dead has quickened
[1:31:29] this mortal body
[1:31:30] it's quickened your mortal body and we

[1:33:48] great mystery of love expressed that God
[1:33:51] and man became one see the whole thing
[1:33:54] is God in man one God a man was one
[1:33:57] there and God and man is one here see
[1:34:00] what is it being filled with his spirit
[1:34:04] him having the preeminence that's what's
[1:34:07] God's achievement that's God's purpose
[1:34:10] to do that that he might be
[1:34:12] Christ in Christ in us and all of us
[1:34:16] together one the Holy Spirit he also
[1:34:21] says in the same sermon he says notice
[1:34:24] God making himself known we're not
[1:34:28] supposed to make converts to
[1:34:29] Christianity by government this is in a
[1:34:32] group revelation we don't get we don't
[1:34:36] sit down and compare notes and say well
[1:34:38] I think this is how the first seal in
[1:34:41] that second seal unfolded and and that
[1:34:43] sounds good to me that sound good to you
[1:34:45] okay if you don't understand something
[1:34:50] keep praying for revelation don't you
[1:34:56] don't have to you don't have to try to
[1:34:58] come up with some explanation to so you
[1:35:01] feel better about it
[1:35:02] look there's things that I know that you
[1:35:05] could come up and ask me and maybe I
[1:35:07] feel a little embarrassed I say you know
[1:35:10] what brother honestly I don't know I
[1:35:14] just know what he said but I'm still
[1:35:17] praying for more revelation but I
[1:35:19] recognize what God's done in this day
[1:35:21] and I'm so thankful for says but my
[1:35:26] revelation that Christ in you as God was
[1:35:29] in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in
[1:35:32] you what God did in Christ Christ
[1:35:34] designate what songs did in Christ what
[1:35:39] science did God in Christ Christ doesn't
[1:35:41] you ask are we happy that we've just
[1:35:43] come into the outer courts of the
[1:35:45] tabernacle are we happy that maybe we've
[1:35:49] gone into the holy place I'll say no
[1:35:52] lord I want to go all the way into the
[1:35:54] holiest of holies jesus said of that
[1:35:57] game that's this day at that day when
[1:36:01] the revelation has made known you will
[1:36:04] know that I am in the father and the
[1:36:06] father in me and I
[1:36:07] and you and me when the revelation has
[1:36:10] made manifest that day you shall know
[1:36:13] that I am in the father are one I am in
[1:36:16] the father and the father in me then
[1:36:18] when the revelation comes forth then
[1:36:21] it's I and you and you and me man I felt
[1:36:23] like this then when the revelation comes
[1:36:27] forth and it's eyeing you and you and me
[1:36:29] personal to you you need that revelation
[1:36:32] to you personally
[1:36:34] it is a Lord I believe it Lord reveal it
[1:36:38] manifest I say Oh God grant us a greater
[1:36:40] revelation of your word look Paul knew
[1:36:43] Jesus Christ by what by revelation how
[1:36:49] did Peter know by revelation Peter could
[1:36:53] have said I touched him I've handed them
[1:36:55] the Word of Life I've seen him with my
[1:36:57] eyes I meet with him I fished with him
[1:36:59] but when Jesus turned to him and said
[1:37:04] Peter write Church who do you say that I
[1:37:10] am he wasn't speaking to the multitudes
[1:37:14] he wasn't speaking to the seventy he was
[1:37:18] speaking to the twelve knowing even one
[1:37:19] of them was a deadly sin Peter who do
[1:37:21] you say that I am he said thou art the
[1:37:25] Christ the Son of God and Jesus said
[1:37:30] flesh and blood have not revealed this
[1:37:32] to you but my heavenly father which is
[1:37:34] in heaven I reveal this to you the gates
[1:37:36] of Hell shall not prevail against it see
[1:37:39] was by revelation it has to be
[1:37:42] revelation just like the disciples after
[1:37:45] his resurrection think of think of the
[1:37:49] discouragement that these disciples were
[1:37:52] going through everything that they were
[1:37:54] believing for here they believed that
[1:37:58] this was the Messiah he was going to
[1:38:00] restore the kingdom
[1:38:02] and all of a sudden just like that he's
[1:38:05] taken from him and he's crucified he's
[1:38:08] been laid away a tomb they had left jobs
[1:38:13] they have left families they have left
[1:38:14] everything and they were following Jesus
[1:38:17] Christ the Messiah and what was Jesus
[1:38:22] Christ doing he was fulfilling his word
[1:38:25] and so he enrolls on that third day oh
[1:38:29] what a glorious time he had condemned
[1:38:32] sin in the flesh and now he had risen
[1:38:34] the mighty conquer that risen Oliveri
[1:38:38] comes to the disciples on the road to
[1:38:40] Emmaus and they're discouraged though
[1:38:45] the sun's here the world has resurrected
[1:38:49] and now he comes to his children there
[1:38:53] and they're discouraged and he starts to
[1:38:56] tell them fools and slow of heart to
[1:39:00] recognize the word and all the things
[1:39:02] that must have been fulfilled pertaining
[1:39:04] to the life of Christ see they were
[1:39:07] still lacking they were still needing
[1:39:10] further revelation there is still
[1:39:13] further unfolding there was a change in
[1:39:16] dispensation that had taken place even
[1:39:21] when you think about the disciples when
[1:39:23] they went fishing Lord had already
[1:39:26] appeared to him two times but here he
[1:39:29] comes on the bags that you can't
[1:39:31] anything no no I'm just throwing out on
[1:39:34] the other side all right
[1:39:36] you see maybe they would say like I've
[1:39:39] heard of that before
[1:39:41] but it wasn't until that net was filled
[1:39:44] up with fish that they realized that
[1:39:46] something was familiar and that's when
[1:39:49] something transpired that's when
[1:39:50] something clicked and the scripture says
[1:39:52] all Peter he guard himself and jumped in
[1:39:56] the water and swam all the way to shore
[1:39:58] and the scripture says they came up and
[1:40:01] gathered around yet some fish on the
[1:40:02] fire it says and the disciples Durst not
[1:40:04] ask him who it was because they knew it
[1:40:08] was Jesus why because he was failed
[1:40:12] their eyes were withholding him they
[1:40:15] couldn't recognize him in this unfolding
[1:40:17] of the word and all I've been just
[1:40:19] rejoicing on here Mary being up the tomb
[1:40:23] she'd come there to the tomb and the
[1:40:26] Lord has risen he's there he's talking
[1:40:28] to Mary and Mary all she's saying oh you
[1:40:31] tell me where his body is tell me where
[1:40:34] his body is this is all woman to sir if
[1:40:38] you're just having little does she know
[1:40:39] she's speaking to her heart
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:47] but she's lacking a little revelation
[1:40:50] she's she's lacking a battle being taken
[1:40:54] away from her eyes but when Jesus is
[1:41:00] married when the Lord called her name
[1:41:06] the man was taken away don't you realize
[1:41:10] the true name is in the Lamb's Book of
[1:41:12] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:41:14] it was feeling of my seven fields but
[1:41:20] the Lamb he had done me an accessory
[1:41:21] work and he's now he's come forth and he
[1:41:24] took the book and he's open the book and
[1:41:29] the part that said your name was in
[1:41:31] there and it was a little sing of your
[1:41:34] name
[1:41:35] you realized this message is calling
[1:41:38] your name and it's taking the valet and
[1:41:41] you're beholding the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:44] and our day
