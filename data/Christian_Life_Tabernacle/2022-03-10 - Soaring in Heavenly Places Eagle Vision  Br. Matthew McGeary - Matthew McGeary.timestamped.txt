[31:53] know that it's not in vain
[31:56] to know that you have received our
[31:58] worship
[32:01] and to know that by divine promise that

[32:48] we just ask that you'd come now lord
[32:50] we've
[32:51] we've come to sing songs and to worship
[32:53] you lord but
[32:56] it's all led up to this point lord where
[32:58] you would speak
[33:00] to your bride
[33:02] lord i know in myself i i don't have
[33:04] anything i could
[33:07] give to your bride but
[33:10] by divine promise and a gift
[33:14] i ask that you come and break the bread
[33:15] of life now

[33:26] feed my sheep
[33:28] you ask them again peter do you love me
[33:31] [Music]
[33:33] feed my sheep
[33:35] feed my lambs lord for i know that that
[33:38] is your heart's desire and
[33:39] we're here lord to receive from you now
[33:42] we ask it in jesus christ's name we pray
[33:45] amen
[33:46] amen if you'll just grab your bibles
[33:48] we'll be reading out of two familiar
[33:50] places in the scriptures we read out of
[33:52] isaiah 40 in revelations 3. we do want
[33:55] to bring you greetings
[33:57] from brother ted pacettely and the
[33:58] saints there in the prescott area
[34:00] we had an opportunity to minister for
[34:03] them as we are away on vacation to see
[34:05] aaron and elizabeth and the kids so it's
[34:07] just
[34:08] nice to be able to see family
[34:11] and it's very nice to be back with our
[34:14] family here and see each one of you
[34:16] and to stand before you so
[34:19] we just are thankful for the opportunity
[34:22] it's reading out of isaiah chapter
[34:24] 40 verse 31.
[34:35] and verse 31 reads
[34:38] but they that wait upon the lord shall
[34:39] renew their strength
[34:41] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[34:44] they shall run
[34:46] and not be weary and they shall walk
[34:49] and not faint and also if you'll turn
[34:51] with me to revelations
[34:55] chapter 3
[34:56] we'll read verse 18.
[35:06] i've really been enjoying
[35:09] uh the message of the rising of the sun
[35:12] you know it's the very the heart of the
[35:14] message if i could say it like that
[35:19] and uh my we i felt like i had to dodge
[35:22] uh from from going moving ahead in the
[35:24] book you know in the quotes there's but
[35:26] you know it's uh it's just such a
[35:28] wonderful thing to feed on the word of
[35:29] god amen
[35:31] revelations chapter 3 verse 18 it would
[35:33] read i counsel thee to buy of me gold
[35:35] tried and fire that thou mayest be rich
[35:38] and
[35:40] white raiment that thou mayest be
[35:42] clothed and that thy shame of thy
[35:43] nakedness do not appear
[35:46] and anoint thine eyes with eyes have
[35:48] that thou mayest see amen you may have
[35:50] your seats i just want to
[35:54] read a portion here of isaiah 40 verse
[35:57] 31
[35:58] out of the amplified it would read like
[36:00] this it would say but those who wait for
[36:02] the lord
[36:03] who expect
[36:05] look for and hope in him
[36:07] i pray that's what you're doing tonight
[36:09] that you're that you're hoping or you're
[36:11] you're expecting or your hope is in him
[36:14] amen that who expect look for and hope
[36:16] in him it says will gain strength and
[36:19] renew their power they will lift up
[36:21] their wings and rise up close to god i
[36:24] like that they will lift up their wings
[36:27] and rise up close to god like eagles
[36:30] rising toward the sun in that a
[36:32] beautiful illustration that that is
[36:34] painting for the believer that they will
[36:36] lift up their wings and rise up close to
[36:38] god like eagles rising uh toward the sun
[36:41] they will run and not uh become weary
[36:43] they will walk and not grow tired and
[36:46] just from pulling from that portion in
[36:48] scripture i want to speak to you a
[36:49] little bit tonight on soaring in
[36:51] heavenly places and maybe we have uh
[36:54] visited this subject before and and
[36:57] spoke about being seated in heavenly
[36:59] places but i just want to use this word
[37:01] soaring in heavenly places to bring
[37:03] forth an illustration and maybe as a
[37:06] subject
[37:07] eagle vision
[37:09] and as we maybe just lay a foundation it
[37:12] might seem we're approaching this
[37:13] subject
[37:14] uh uh maybe from from off to the side if
[37:17] you will but we just want to cover a few
[37:19] things as we work towards the way god
[37:21] would have us to go but brother branham
[37:23] would say this and be certain of god he
[37:25] would say wait now he just read this
[37:27] scripture out of isaiah 40 verse 31 it
[37:30] says wait when you have met his
[37:32] requirements that brings your faith to a
[37:34] showdown and so just just right off the
[37:38] bat everybody needs to know everything
[37:39] that's happening right now everything
[37:41] that you're going through all the signs
[37:43] of the times everything that you're
[37:44] seeing it's bringing your faith to a
[37:47] showdown he says that brings your faith
[37:49] to a showdown if you have met god's
[37:51] requirements
[37:52] i have met and you have
[37:54] fully considered it and you have done
[37:56] everything that god required you to do
[38:00] then your faith rests right there that
[38:02] he is
[38:03] be certain of god
[38:05] you know he loves to test us
[38:09] oh my
[38:10] he loves to test us
[38:13] he loves to see the reaction of your
[38:16] faith
[38:17] now keep that in in your minds as we
[38:20] move forward he loves to see the
[38:22] reaction of your faith did you know that
[38:24] god likes to see how you react when you
[38:26] say oh lord i believe you that thou art
[38:29] my savior i believe that you are the
[38:32] healer i believe that you are the one
[38:34] who gives the holy spirit and the things
[38:36] that i am requiring you are the god who
[38:39] gives it and then when you confess all
[38:41] your sins and promise god that you'll
[38:43] you'll do it if if
[38:45] if you'll he'll let you get well and
[38:47] then because it don't happen
[38:49] you run off like a coward somewhere
[38:52] god can't use that
[38:56] there's no way for him to use you
[38:58] there's no way for him to answer you
[39:01] because he only answers by faith
[39:05] then all of a sudden you go away and he
[39:07] can't answer but real
[39:09] true faith stands there
[39:12] being sure that god is be certain
[39:15] that he is now notice he said he loves
[39:18] to see the reaction of your faith
[39:22] not your flesh
[39:24] he loves to see the reaction of your
[39:27] faith paul would say in romans 8 13 for
[39:29] if ye live after the flesh
[39:32] ye shall die
[39:34] but as we read out of there out of
[39:36] revelations uh chapter 3 you know
[39:38] there's a spirit of lady osea
[39:40] that wants to to get on you
[39:43] that wants to anoint you with that way
[39:45] of thinking where you're oh riched and
[39:47] increased with goods and i have need of
[39:49] nothing you know a lot of us get to that
[39:51] place where if we're not careful the the
[39:54] cares of this life and lady you'll see
[39:56] is designed in such a way where you get
[39:58] complacent
[40:00] where you you might not feel like you've
[40:02] adapted that way of thinking but if
[40:03] you've come to a place where you're not
[40:05] really hungering and thirsting after the
[40:07] things of god and you're not praying for
[40:10] revelation and looking and and what
[40:12] hoping and expecting in him look up your
[40:15] rejection and draweth nigh you know any
[40:17] day i could be the catching away of the
[40:19] bride we realize that we just allow the
[40:22] the ways of ladies see and and and our
[40:25] jobs and our work and school just to
[40:27] lull us to sleep
[40:29] and we're not careful all of a sudden
[40:31] we're living by the flesh
[40:33] but but god is saying here god loves to
[40:35] see the reaction of your faith not your
[40:38] five senses and your efforts and and how
[40:40] academic you can be in those things and
[40:42] and whatever you do in word or deed do
[40:44] it unto the lord it's good to do all
[40:45] those things in the lord but but we
[40:47] don't want to allow the cares of the
[40:49] world to get us to a place where we've
[40:51] been lulled to sleep and the spirit of
[40:53] ladies has come unto us and that we're
[40:55] no longer esteeming the things of god
[41:01] it's easy to get complacent and
[41:03] comfortable in our condition
[41:05] i like what our pastor said sunday he
[41:07] said we have to rise above the flesh
[41:11] he said you can't think carnally and get
[41:13] anywhere with god
[41:15] i like that because a lot of us approach
[41:17] god carnally
[41:19] a lot of us approach him with with our
[41:21] ideas and our wants and our desires and
[41:24] whenever we pray but but we never we
[41:26] never come under a a holy unction and
[41:29] and come into that spirit of prayer and
[41:31] and come un under that word and into
[41:33] anointing and approach the lord jesus
[41:35] christ and and get into his presence to
[41:37] where all the carnal mind has has been
[41:40] moved to the side and now you're brought
[41:42] into his presence and you can pray like
[41:44] jesus prayed and saying uh uh you're not
[41:46] my real lord
[41:49] but thy will be done but many times
[41:51] we're just praying for our will
[41:54] we're just praying for our wants and our
[41:56] desires but we don't want to do that as
[41:59] paul would continue in romans 8 13 he
[42:02] said but if you through the spirit do
[42:04] mortify the deeds of the body ye shall
[42:06] live
[42:07] so
[42:08] the test is to put your faith
[42:12] in action
[42:14] to bring it to a showdown
[42:17] look everything that's uh uh shaping up
[42:19] right now
[42:21] is for a purpose
[42:23] everything that you see uh uh uh the
[42:25] current events and everything uh it it
[42:28] has an effect and god is is requiring
[42:31] something of the bride that his word
[42:33] would be manifested and i just want to
[42:35] say what's impressed upon my heart is is
[42:39] is how that the the the cares of life
[42:42] and and the demands of life and and
[42:44] working a job and and maybe uh the
[42:47] family life and everything and and
[42:49] paying the bills and and maybe you feel
[42:52] like church becomes you know it becomes
[42:54] a almost a tradition or a burden to
[42:57] where well i've got to make time to go
[42:58] here and i i go i got to go here and i
[43:01] just want to say that the daily grind
[43:03] can disillusion us
[43:05] to where all of a sudden we've totally
[43:07] lost a focus
[43:09] and we we've actually become carnal
[43:13] and not even realize it
[43:16] but i just but the inspiration of what i
[43:18] want to preach to you comes from this
[43:20] quote out of the rising of the sun in
[43:22] paragraph uh 261 he says we got to be
[43:25] full and prayed up with quickening power
[43:29] until the quickening power of the holy
[43:31] ghost we got to be caught away someday
[43:34] in the rapture yonder yes sir amen he
[43:37] goes on to say in 263 he goes your
[43:39] eagles
[43:41] back to the word of god
[43:43] be burly

[44:22] he says that scripture we read they that

[44:26] will lift up their wings and rise up
[44:29] close to god like eagles rising towards
[44:32] the sun oh oh what a what a beautiful
[44:35] picture that paints for the believer of
[44:37] the word that has come in our day to
[44:39] catch us and to raise us up into the
[44:41] presence of god
[44:43] you know i had an experience and maybe
[44:45] i've shared it here before that happened
[44:47] maybe some 20 years ago when i was in
[44:50] arizona
[44:51] and i was out there on at work and i was
[44:55] working in sedona and i was in what they
[44:57] call oak creek canyon it's just this
[45:00] this little creek comes down
[45:02] through these huge red rock cliffsides
[45:04] and the the pines and spruces kind of
[45:07] lace it going up it's just a beautiful
[45:09] beautiful sight to be holding i was
[45:11] doing some tree work at this resort and
[45:13] and you know in my heart i was
[45:15] discouraged
[45:17] i had made decisions as the young
[45:19] christian i was and and certainly done
[45:21] it as as as i've gotten through the
[45:23] years a little bit more with the lord
[45:24] you still make mistakes even after 20 30
[45:26] 40 years
[45:28] but in my heart you know i'd made some
[45:30] decisions and i thought i was really
[45:32] discouraged and and lunch time came and
[45:34] i remember walking down there by the
[45:36] creek side and there's a big old boulder
[45:38] and i i i kind of hopped across the
[45:40] couple found a good spot there and and i
[45:43] was just sitting on that
[45:44] boulder there looking at the river
[45:46] coming down you know the sun was shining
[45:48] upon it and the water was sparkling and
[45:50] there was some little rapids there it
[45:52] was going down it just it was just a
[45:54] beautiful sight as i i kind of then it
[45:56] kind of struck me you know as and i just
[45:58] thought but you know how well i'm
[46:00] disappointed that that i could make a
[46:02] decision or i could allow these things
[46:04] to happen you know i i thought
[46:07] you know i would i was better than that
[46:09] and and all of a sudden as i was i was
[46:11] looking at the water i noticed this this
[46:14] little bobber uh close to the bank side
[46:16] it had it gotten pulled into a little
[46:18] whirlpool
[46:20] and i was just watching that little
[46:21] bobber and and it just seemed as it kind
[46:23] of swirled around there it would start
[46:26] getting kind of out to the outside and
[46:28] looked like it was just about to break
[46:30] away back into the stream but then it
[46:31] would get pulled back in
[46:33] and i just watched that a few times and
[46:35] every single time it it got there close
[46:38] to seeming like it was gonna break free
[46:40] it'd get pulled back in and something to
[46:42] my heart said oh god that's that's me i
[46:44] feel like that little bobber there i'm
[46:46] just kind of stuck here in this
[46:47] discouragement and and wondering how i
[46:50] can make a decision like that
[46:52] and i just thought upon that
[46:54] i just a heavy-hearted i just laid back
[46:57] there on the rock
[47:00] and then i
[47:01] i i opened up my eyes and
[47:04] all of a sudden this
[47:06] big huge bird flew right over my head
[47:10] and i sat up real quick to watch it and
[47:12] and as i watched it was an eagle and
[47:15] and it just started to fly straight for
[47:17] the sun and it just kept going higher
[47:19] and higher and it kept flying right into
[47:22] the sunlight before i i couldn't even i
[47:24] couldn't even see it anymore and
[47:26] something spoke to my heart and said
[47:27] that's hit my son that's it see if you
[47:30] get your eyes off the message these
[47:32] things will happen but oh the message is
[47:34] the eagle the great jehovah eagle that
[47:37] has come and if you'll just keep your
[47:39] eyes on him it's going to lead you right
[47:41] into the presence of the son oh jesus
[47:44] christ has come in this day he has
[47:46] revealed himself to take you into the
[47:49] presence of god but when you look to the
[47:51] left and you look to the right yes
[47:54] you'll get pulled off into a little
[47:55] whirlpool and if you find yourself there
[47:58] this morning if you feel like satan has
[48:00] sunk his teeth into you he's pulled you
[48:02] off to the side somewhere you're stuck
[48:04] there in a little whirlpool i want to
[48:06] tell you that god has come here tonight
[48:09] to pull you out of that whirlpool quit
[48:11] looking at your past quit looking at
[48:13] your failures just look straight right
[48:15] into the word the lord jesus is just and
[48:18] faithful to give forgive you if you'll
[48:20] just keep your eyes on calvary
[48:24] oh this message is taking us somewhere
[48:28] the trouble is so many times we get our
[48:30] eyes off the message
[48:33] we start looking to the left
[48:35] we start looking to the right and then
[48:37] yes when we make decisions
[48:40] bad decisions
[48:42] satan wants to hold you in that pattern
[48:46] you know condemnation has a strange
[48:47] thing it'll do to you
[48:51] it'll hold you in a place of
[48:53] vulnerability
[48:56] to where if if you have fallen
[48:59] and you've made a bad decision he'll
[49:02] heap that condemnation on you and what
[49:04] it ends up doing is it holds you in a
[49:06] pattern
[49:08] to where you're vulnerable to make the
[49:10] same decision again
[49:15] but see he's just and faithful to
[49:17] forgive you
[49:18] plead the blood of jesus christ
[49:21] let's get the show on the road
[49:24] look it it already was all finished in
[49:26] his mind before this world was ever
[49:28] created
[49:29] so you might as well quit my quit uh
[49:32] being downtrodden and cash down and
[49:35] saying woe is me i can't believe yeah
[49:37] you know i can't believe you did it
[49:38] either but you know what that's not
[49:40] really who you are
[49:42] you were called to something higher you
[49:43] were called to something greater and yes
[49:46] in our faults and failures that's just
[49:48] opportunity for us to experience the
[49:51] attributes of god that's how we give the
[49:53] satan a black eye when he pushes you
[49:55] down and you make a bad decision you
[49:57] know you say my god's bigger than that
[49:59] bad decision
[50:00] my god's bigger than my faults and
[50:02] failures oh you plead the blood of jesus
[50:05] christ and you get back up and you start
[50:07] marching onward christian soldiers going
[50:10] on to battle oh like the prophet
[50:12] standing back is the bride coming into
[50:14] preview he says oh get back in step get
[50:17] back in step there's some of us saints
[50:19] oh we need to get back in step we need
[50:21] to get back in line we need to do a
[50:23] checkup in our lives and think of what
[50:25] it was like when the holy ghost came
[50:27] upon us and we first started serving the
[50:29] lord and there was such a fervency there
[50:31] was such a zeal to kick the things out
[50:33] of the house but then we become
[50:35] intolerant we start to allow things to
[50:37] come in we start to make let things be
[50:39] acceptable we come to be complacent
[50:44] we start to just tolerate the condition
[50:48] i i spoke about this
[50:50] a while back about how
[50:51] you know if something needs to be
[50:52] repaired in the home or something like
[50:55] that well if you don't do it for a while
[50:56] you just start to tolerate it
[50:59] it's like why don't you fix that
[51:03] you know take somebody else sometimes to
[51:05] come come come to the hospital like it
[51:06] really stinks in here
[51:09] but you've been living in it you know
[51:10] the pet dander so long you don't realize
[51:12] you smell like a dog
[51:15] i mean i know it's man's best friend and
[51:17] some people like that that's great
[51:21] praise god
[51:22] there'll be dogs in heaven
[51:24] but the stench won't be there
[51:29] but sometimes we we tolerate a con and
[51:31] we go long enough where we just accept
[51:33] like that's who we are
[51:35] friends no no that you are called to
[51:37] something more
[51:39] and as we've been going through the
[51:40] message our pastor have been leading us
[51:42] through this message the rising of son
[51:43] we've had a sheaf wave in our day
[51:46] the word made flesh in a bride member
[51:49] coming into that adoption of maturity of
[51:52] the spoken word and the bride will not
[51:55] stop short of it
[51:57] oh he was a first
[51:59] one to maturity
[52:03] so what does that mean
[52:05] there's more in the wheat field coming
[52:09] it is the rising of the sun what was the
[52:12] rising of the sun to do was to quicken
[52:15] the seed
[52:17] the same sun hallelujah that rose in the
[52:20] east
[52:22] it's the same sun that has risen in the
[52:25] west
[52:27] the same life the same quickening power
[52:30] taking on the flesh of a bride member
[52:32] and proving that he's the same yesterday
[52:35] today and forever not for a history
[52:38] lesson
[52:39] but to show you that you are that weak
[52:42] seed that god has called in the end time
[52:45] to come up after into that same maturity
[52:50] oh hallelujah
[52:52] that should be the hunger
[52:55] that should be the thirst
[52:57] of the believer
[52:58] as ephesians would say blessed be the
[53:00] god and father of our lord jesus christ
[53:02] who have blessed us
[53:03] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[53:05] places in christ jesus
[53:07] oh soaring
[53:09] in heavenly places
[53:11] prophet of god would would pick this up
[53:13] in christ the mystery and would say what
[53:15] are heavenly places
[53:17] it's your position
[53:19] it's the believer's position in christ
[53:23] where the believer stands in christ
[53:25] that's where you're sitted
[53:27] that's your position
[53:29] now
[53:30] are you living there tonight
[53:33] well glory to god we got work to do
[53:39] that's the purpose of the message
[53:42] that's the purpose of the prophecies
[53:44] that god has fulfilled in the end time
[53:47] was to bring you into your position
[53:52] the bride
[53:54] everything god has done it it was for
[53:56] this purpose
[53:58] i mean think about it now it might sound
[54:00] it might not seem but brother matthew
[54:02] what are you talking yes the very
[54:03] purpose of god everything
[54:06] all the acts of all the believers and
[54:08] everything that god has been doing
[54:09] through the whole bible has been all in
[54:12] types of what god wanted to reveal and
[54:15] show in the end time and on a wednesday
[54:18] evening gathered in bedford texas there
[54:20] is the bride that he had in his mind sit
[54:24] before he even created the world
[54:26] oh that might get somebody to start
[54:28] shouting and to start rejoicing that
[54:31] might say that ain't my words
[54:33] that's the words of a vindicated prophet
[54:36] you are the very reason that he's done
[54:38] all these things
[54:42] and it's because of what he's done is to
[54:45] lift you up out of the muck and mire and
[54:47] bring you into your position as a son
[54:50] and daughter of god
[54:51] and he showed us what that would look
[54:53] like
[54:56] oh verse 4 says according as he has
[54:58] chosen us in him before the foundation
[55:00] of the world
[55:02] that we should be holy and without blame
[55:04] before him in love
[55:06] having predestinated us
[55:08] everybody's familiar with these
[55:09] scriptures
[55:11] ephesians 1 5
[55:13] having predestinated us unto adoption of
[55:15] children by jesus christ to himself
[55:18] according to the good pleasure
[55:20] of his will i like this quote here
[55:22] brother branham says in christ the
[55:24] mystery says predestinated
[55:26] there's the mystery
[55:28] before christ or anything else was ever
[55:31] on earth you see his great mystery
[55:34] that he chose the bride
[55:37] knowing eve would fall
[55:38] now put yourself here
[55:41] when you hear chose the bride
[55:43] he chose me
[55:47] he chose me so many times we don't make
[55:50] the message personal
[55:53] could you i have a black bag in there
[55:55] can you grab my handkerchief out of it
[55:58] every time
[56:00] he says that he chose the bride you need
[56:02] to put your name there you just say you
[56:04] know what he chose me
[56:06] knowing eve would fall from disbelieving
[56:09] the word
[56:10] knowing that she would fall
[56:12] but he would choose a bride that would
[56:15] not fall oh you realize that's you
[56:20] he chose you and predestinated you that
[56:23] you would not fall
[56:26] that would hold to that word regardless
[56:28] of what all the rest of the world has to
[56:30] say about it
[56:32] they would hold to that word
[56:36] they are predestinated to stand there
[56:39] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[56:42] predestinated the church to that great
[56:45] glorious stand
[56:47] now who's he talking about
[56:53] when you hear that
[56:56] there should be something in your heart
[56:58] stirring
[57:00] when he says
[57:02] that he would choose a bride that would
[57:04] not fall
[57:05] that would hold to that word regardless
[57:08] what all the rest of the world had to
[57:10] say about it
[57:12] they would hold to that word
[57:14] they are
[57:16] predestinated to stand there now that
[57:19] right there liberates you of thinking
[57:21] that you have any ability in it
[57:26] he is not counting on your strength he
[57:28] is not counting on your ability he's not
[57:31] accounting on how many quotes you can
[57:33] quote he's not about counting on how
[57:36] many bible studies you can you know what
[57:38] he's counting on he's counting on his
[57:40] own word
[57:44] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[57:47] word will never pass a word pass away he
[57:50] spoke the word and predestinated a bride
[57:54] to be here in the end time and you are
[57:56] that bride
[57:59] he doesn't need your ability he doesn't
[58:01] need your faults he doesn't need your
[58:04] failures he's just asking you to take
[58:06] him at his word
[58:09] just believe what he said
[58:15] they are predestinated to stand there
[58:18] that's why you're still standing
[58:22] you think
[58:24] you're the one
[58:25] that has kept yourself all this time
[58:29] you think you're here because of your
[58:32] ability
[58:35] oh come on
[58:38] are you so foolish having begun in the
[58:40] spirit that we're going to make per be
[58:42] made perfect in the flesh
[58:45] god brought you to this point
[58:48] god is the one that's been keeping you
[58:50] god's the one that's predestinating you
[58:52] god's the one that said i'll have a
[58:53] bride without spot or wrinkle she is
[58:56] predestinated to stand there in that
[58:58] glorious stand in the end time and will
[59:00] manifest every single word that i spoke
[59:03] of her
[59:06] and what do we do we're like mary
[59:10] be it unto me according to the how are
[59:11] these things going to be
[59:13] how is this really going to happen
[59:16] well the holy ghost is going to
[59:17] overshadow you
[59:21] come on god hiding himself in simplicity
[59:25] and revealing himself in the same we may
[59:28] get some pie way off in the sky yonder
[59:31] when god is wanting to reveal himself to
[59:33] you every single day of your life
[59:36] predestinated that church to that great
[59:38] glorious stand
[59:40] where are you standing church
[59:44] you're standing upon the rock of
[59:45] revelation
[59:48] you're standing upon something that
[59:50] could never fail and that is your
[59:51] position in the word of god
[59:54] you're predestinated to it
[59:57] look everybody's playing out their part
[1:00:01] i was thinking about this and i
[1:00:03] i got pretty excited about it
[1:00:06] you know but every everyone is is
[1:00:09] playing their part in god's great drama
[1:00:13] and everything's right on time
[1:00:15] amen
[1:00:16] that's right russia and everything
[1:00:18] that's going on on over there
[1:00:21] politics and carnovich you know it's all
[1:00:23] just prophecy being fulfilled
[1:00:25] it's all just working right on time and
[1:00:27] something just came on my heart and you
[1:00:30] know in zechariah 9 9 it says rejoice
[1:00:34] greatly o daughter of zion
[1:00:37] shout
[1:00:42] o daughter of jerusalem
[1:00:45] behold thy king cometh unto thee
[1:00:48] he is just
[1:00:50] and having salvation
[1:00:52] lowly
[1:00:53] and riding upon an ass and upon the cult
[1:00:56] the full of an ass
[1:00:59] now i was just thinking about that and
[1:01:00] something came
[1:01:02] to my heart
[1:01:04] this great prophecy you see here rejoice
[1:01:07] greatly o daughter of zion shout o
[1:01:10] daughter of jerusalem behold thy king
[1:01:13] cometh unto thee isn't that marvelous
[1:01:17] but notice what's part of that prophecy
[1:01:23] there's a cult
[1:01:24] an ass a donkey
[1:01:26] that's part of this prophecy
[1:01:29] you know what i i got to just
[1:01:32] thinking about that how you know in mark
[1:01:34] uh jesus would tell the disciples hey i
[1:01:36] want you to go over here to this house
[1:01:38] and
[1:01:39] and there's going to be a cult that has
[1:01:40] never been ridden upon before
[1:01:43] no man's ever ridden upon it and go
[1:01:45] under the go over to these people and
[1:01:47] tell them
[1:01:48] that
[1:01:49] that
[1:01:50] i have need of it and i got to thinking
[1:01:52] about that little that little donkey
[1:01:54] over there
[1:01:56] you know i was just thinking
[1:01:58] that maybe their their owners
[1:02:00] had that donkey and they you know
[1:02:03] they tried to saddle that donkey up they
[1:02:06] tried to work that donkey up
[1:02:08] but you know i was imagining that god
[1:02:10] put something in that donkey
[1:02:13] that just couldn't stand it
[1:02:15] every time somebody tried to come and
[1:02:17] and put a put a saddle on that donkey
[1:02:20] say you know what we're going to break
[1:02:22] you in
[1:02:23] we're going to put you to work there was
[1:02:24] something in that donkey that just
[1:02:26] couldn't stand it that just wouldn't
[1:02:29] wouldn't uh allow them to do it because
[1:02:32] there was a predestinated moment for
[1:02:34] that donkey to fulfill
[1:02:35] and i imagine they tried to saddle it up
[1:02:38] and he's like oh i i don't want to do it
[1:02:40] i reckon that donkey started to think
[1:02:42] something's wrong with me why ain't i
[1:02:44] like the rest of the donkeys out there i
[1:02:46] see them all working and they're all
[1:02:48] going out in the field and everything
[1:02:50] why can't i be like the rest of them but
[1:02:52] there was just something in that donkey
[1:02:54] that was unsettled oh they tried to
[1:02:56] saddle that donkey with drugs and
[1:02:59] alcohol and there was something in that
[1:03:01] donkey it just wasn't satisfied with
[1:03:03] drugs and alcohol they tried to saddle
[1:03:05] that donkey with creeds and dogmas and
[1:03:07] religion but it just wouldn't hold them
[1:03:10] all the world kept trying to offer that
[1:03:12] little donkey a bunch of stuff to saddle
[1:03:14] it up and put it to work but there was
[1:03:16] just something in that old donkey he
[1:03:18] said i don't know what it is but there's
[1:03:20] just something more for my life and i
[1:03:22] was kind of thinking about it by the
[1:03:24] time those disciples showed up to that
[1:03:26] person jarred and said hey i need that
[1:03:28] donkey right there so you can have him
[1:03:32] he ain't no good for nothing
[1:03:34] he didn't fit into my church he didn't
[1:03:36] fit into my programs he never did
[1:03:38] anything for me i he would never accept
[1:03:41] my doctrine he could never see the
[1:03:43] trinity you can have them oh loose them
[1:03:46] and let them go the master has need of
[1:03:49] them and this great prophecy on palm
[1:03:51] sunday here come the messiah riding
[1:03:54] forth and there was a little donkey
[1:03:57] packing the messiah
[1:03:59] oh i get religious i feel a little bit
[1:04:01] like that donkey
[1:04:03] there's been some great prophecies for
[1:04:05] the end time but god needed a donkey
[1:04:08] well call me a donkey call me whatever
[1:04:11] you want to call me but i don't fit into
[1:04:12] your religions i don't fit into your
[1:04:14] school i don't fit into your theology i
[1:04:17] don't fit into your drugs i don't fit
[1:04:19] into your ladies here why because i've
[1:04:21] been called out of it because i am part
[1:04:24] of prophecy being fulfilled
[1:04:28] oh hallelujah
[1:04:31] oh glory to god there was something
[1:04:33] about that little donkey that just
[1:04:34] didn't understand why it was all
[1:04:35] happening
[1:04:38] oh but it was prophecy being fulfilled
[1:04:42] loose him
[1:04:44] and let him go
[1:04:46] oh that reminds me a little bit like
[1:04:47] lazarus
[1:04:49] he was dead for days and didn't have a
[1:04:51] thought coming
[1:04:53] i got to thinking about that one day
[1:04:55] about some people being down at a
[1:04:56] restaurant sitting around you know
[1:04:59] talking about current events and
[1:05:00] politics
[1:05:02] say what do you think about all
[1:05:04] but all this nonsense about this jesus
[1:05:06] so-called of nazareth that's a messiah
[1:05:10] say what do you what do you think about
[1:05:11] all this stuff that he's doing
[1:05:13] you know some people are saying he's a
[1:05:14] messiah and he's supposed to re restore
[1:05:16] the kingdom
[1:05:19] and some of them are being skeptics and
[1:05:21] being critical but you know what
[1:05:23] you know i heard i heard my
[1:05:25] my brother was sick you know and he got
[1:05:28] healed but i really never thought he was
[1:05:29] that bad off anyways
[1:05:31] and all of a sudden they start talking
[1:05:33] and say yeah you know what we we've had
[1:05:35] them them them witch doctors come around
[1:05:37] before and there's other men that have
[1:05:39] rose up and told the messiah and they
[1:05:40] looked over at this one man said well
[1:05:42] what do you think about it
[1:05:45] what do you think about it you're being
[1:05:46] quiet
[1:05:48] and i was just envisioning this hey he
[1:05:50] looked at him said well you know what my
[1:05:51] name's lazarus
[1:05:53] let me tell you a little story oh i feel
[1:05:56] like lazarus i was dead i didn't have a
[1:05:59] thought coming but it was the rising of
[1:06:01] the sun and that eagle screamed out to
[1:06:03] me and said oh though you're dead in sin
[1:06:05] and trespasses i have called you out of
[1:06:08] dark denominations i have called you out
[1:06:10] of creeds and dogmas i have called you
[1:06:13] into a resurrection into quickening
[1:06:15] power
[1:06:18] why because i've been predestinated
[1:06:21] you have been predestinated to stand
[1:06:26] that's why you're here
[1:06:29] lazarus didn't have nothing to do with
[1:06:30] that
[1:06:32] now he was dead
[1:06:37] you can't get more dead than four days
[1:06:39] dead
[1:06:41] and i want to tell you all of us
[1:06:43] were dead
[1:06:45] and you couldn't get more dead
[1:06:48] but god reaching mercy
[1:06:51] how to predestinate a seed
[1:06:54] on the inside of that body
[1:06:57] oh what
[1:06:58] what did the prophet say he said your
[1:07:00] temple your body
[1:07:02] is the temple of the dynamics
[1:07:05] although lazarus was laying in a grave
[1:07:08] for four days dead he was going to curl
[1:07:11] that body out of the grave i don't care
[1:07:14] how bad you got i don't care how much
[1:07:16] sin you're stooped in i don't care how
[1:07:18] many bad decisions you've done iran
[1:07:20] often made i don't care how bad it's
[1:07:22] gotten your vessel your body your life
[1:07:26] is the predestinated temple for the
[1:07:29] quickening power of god to resurrect you
[1:07:31] out of that situation
[1:07:35] oh hallelujah praise his wonderful name
[1:07:38] oh my
[1:07:40] yeah i might be that little old donkey
[1:07:42] but you know what
[1:07:44] i kind of i kind of got a picture in my
[1:07:46] mind of that little donkey coming down
[1:07:48] the hill with a big old smile on his
[1:07:49] face
[1:07:51] this is what i was made for
[1:07:54] all my life i've been wondering
[1:07:56] what was wrong with me
[1:07:58] you imagine as they saw that
[1:08:01] is that your donkey
[1:08:03] i thought you said no one could ride
[1:08:05] that thing
[1:08:07] yeah i mean
[1:08:08] surely that can't be
[1:08:11] oh my i feel people looked at me mcgeary
[1:08:16] don't
[1:08:17] he's serving god
[1:08:18] no
[1:08:21] he's packing the gospel he's packing
[1:08:23] them that guy
[1:08:25] that read yeah you
[1:08:28] yeah you're packing the messiah god has
[1:08:30] cleansed you he's redeemed you he
[1:08:33] sanctified you he's filled you with all
[1:08:35] he goes that you could pack this message
[1:08:40] everything working out to play its part
[1:08:45] what about your part church
[1:08:51] i want to read this out of the church
[1:08:53] age
[1:08:55] a son of god can go a long time before
[1:08:57] he recognizes that he is a son
[1:09:00] in fact a lot of true christians are
[1:09:02] like the story of the baby eagle that
[1:09:04] was hatched
[1:09:05] out under a hen
[1:09:07] you know that the eagle is a type of the
[1:09:09] true believer
[1:09:11] well the farmer took an egg from its
[1:09:12] eagle's nest and he placed it under a
[1:09:14] hen and in due time all the eggs under
[1:09:16] the hen hatched out
[1:09:18] the baby chicks got alone
[1:09:20] along fine
[1:09:21] with the mother hen but that little
[1:09:23] eagle could not figure out that clucking
[1:09:25] and scratching for the food in the
[1:09:26] manure pile he managed to make a living
[1:09:29] but he was pretty confused about it all
[1:09:32] well does anybody know what i'm talking
[1:09:33] about
[1:09:35] has anybody ever been confused about at
[1:09:38] all
[1:09:39] and you've just wondered that there has
[1:09:41] to be more to life than this
[1:09:44] but one day
[1:09:45] from way up in the air the mother eagle
[1:09:48] that had laid the egg spied that little
[1:09:50] eagle on the ground she swooped down
[1:09:52] with tremendous speed and screamed at
[1:09:54] the top of her voice for him to fly up
[1:09:56] to meet her he had never heard an eagle
[1:09:59] cry
[1:10:00] but when he had heard the scream
[1:10:02] something in him stirred and he longed
[1:10:03] to launch out toward it but he was
[1:10:05] afraid to try
[1:10:08] i think that's where a lot of us sit
[1:10:10] right now
[1:10:11] i think a lot of us are afraid to try
[1:10:18] i think a lot of us are afraid
[1:10:20] to manifest this message
[1:10:26] because it takes sacrifice
[1:10:31] it takes you
[1:10:33] to let everybody know around you all the
[1:10:35] other chickens
[1:10:36] that i identify with that
[1:10:39] you know we have young people today that
[1:10:41] have
[1:10:42] all of their social media they go to
[1:10:45] school
[1:10:46] and they have a lot of friends
[1:10:48] and their friends don't even know what
[1:10:50] they believe
[1:10:53] it's okay
[1:10:55] it's okay to be afraid
[1:10:58] let god speak to you for a moment
[1:11:02] and just because some of us have crossed
[1:11:04] over
[1:11:06] we don't know what they're going through
[1:11:10] they have it way harder than we ever had
[1:11:12] it
[1:11:16] but god wants to use your young people
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:20] and i know you might be afraid
[1:11:23] but the prophet goes on and says again
[1:11:26] that mother screamed for him to arise
[1:11:29] in the wind and follow her
[1:11:32] he screamed back that he was afraid
[1:11:37] once more she called out
[1:11:39] screaming that he tried
[1:11:42] beating his wings
[1:11:44] he hurled himself into the air
[1:11:47] answering the cry of his mother
[1:11:50] he soared off into the blue sky
[1:11:53] you see he was always was an eagle
[1:11:56] he acted like a chicken for a little
[1:11:58] while
[1:11:59] but he could not be satisfied
[1:12:01] but when he heard the call of the great
[1:12:04] eagle he came to his own place
[1:12:08] and once a true son of god hears the cry
[1:12:10] of the spirit by the word
[1:12:14] he too will realize
[1:12:16] who he is
[1:12:18] and run to the great prophet eagle and
[1:12:21] be with him forever seated in heavenly
[1:12:24] places in christ jesus that's what's
[1:12:27] happening to your heart when you wonder
[1:12:29] why you're having all that turmoil and
[1:12:31] it feels like there's a war going inside
[1:12:33] of you and you want to do what's right
[1:12:35] and you know you should separate from
[1:12:36] this all the great jehovah eagle is
[1:12:39] calling to you he's calling to take you
[1:12:42] into higher heights and to deeper depths
[1:12:44] that you might soar in heavenly places
[1:12:47] in christ jesus where you're free from
[1:12:50] the scandal of man you know
[1:12:52] your feelings it doesn't matter if your
[1:12:54] feelings got hurt but oh you're seated
[1:12:56] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:12:58] that's what the message is doing it's
[1:13:00] calling you to come up higher
[1:13:04] oh that's my desire
[1:13:06] i want to soar in heavenly places
[1:13:09] in an atmosphere where all things are
[1:13:11] possible
[1:13:13] above
[1:13:15] the doubt
[1:13:17] above
[1:13:18] the unbelief
[1:13:20] above
[1:13:22] being afraid
[1:13:23] above well they said this
[1:13:26] and they said that
[1:13:27] above
[1:13:28] hurt feelings
[1:13:30] above
[1:13:31] the scandal of man
[1:13:33] above well they should have done it that
[1:13:35] way
[1:13:36] above what i think is the best
[1:13:38] but you're now seated in heavenly places
[1:13:42] in christ jesus and i want to say it
[1:13:44] like this and from that position
[1:13:47] from that position that's where we want
[1:13:50] to make our decisions
[1:13:53] we want to make our decisions in an
[1:13:54] atmosphere of faith
[1:13:57] what he he loves to test us
[1:14:00] and he loves to see the reaction of your
[1:14:02] faith
[1:14:04] but if lady will see you in the cares of
[1:14:06] his life can pull you out of your
[1:14:08] position
[1:14:10] pull you out of those heavenly realms
[1:14:12] where you're where you're prayed up and
[1:14:14] you're in the spirit of god well yeah
[1:14:17] yeah a lot of times we do things and say
[1:14:19] things and we react in the flesh
[1:14:22] but god is calling us to a higher place
[1:14:25] where that if we're seated in those
[1:14:26] heavenly places that we could soar up
[1:14:29] there look an eagle can soar higher than
[1:14:31] any other bird
[1:14:34] he can go where no other bird can go and
[1:14:36] you know you know god likens his
[1:14:38] prophets to eagle he's the great jehovah
[1:14:41] prophet eagle
[1:14:43] and you heard the quote god god likens
[1:14:45] the true believer to eagles
[1:14:49] and so
[1:14:50] just maybe as we move
[1:14:52] in a certain direction the reason we've
[1:14:54] titled this soren in heavenly places
[1:14:56] because you are eagles
[1:15:01] the prophet would say this
[1:15:03] he said but an eagle is a special bird
[1:15:05] now what good would it do
[1:15:08] him to go way up there in the air unless
[1:15:11] he could see way off
[1:15:15] see what good does it do us to say oh
[1:15:16] i'm seated in heavenly places in christ
[1:15:19] jesus i'm the bride i'm predestinated
[1:15:22] and and we we say we're all these things
[1:15:26] but if we're lacking the vision of the
[1:15:28] word for our lives what do we really
[1:15:30] have
[1:15:33] so that's why we're dealing with a
[1:15:35] subject here about eagle vision because
[1:15:37] i want to just dig into this for a
[1:15:39] moment here the prophet would say this
[1:15:41] in communion
[1:15:44] the 65 12 12 communion
[1:15:47] if you walk into anything blindly
[1:15:51] oh
[1:15:52] i'm getting stirred up right now
[1:15:54] thank god he didn't leave his bride
[1:15:57] to walk into this end time blindly
[1:16:02] we are not wondering
[1:16:03] we are not probing
[1:16:06] oh god took the prophet off the scene
[1:16:08] years ago and still we're watching that
[1:16:11] prophetic word come to pass
[1:16:15] we're not here wondering watch when oil
[1:16:17] goes watch when russia goes for that oil
[1:16:20] watch russia it wasn't even called
[1:16:21] russia yet it was the soviet i mean all
[1:16:24] of these things oh he didn't leave the
[1:16:26] bride blind
[1:16:28] wondering what is this all what's all
[1:16:30] going on
[1:16:33] oh my you could preach a little while
[1:16:35] just right off that if you go into
[1:16:37] anything blind oh thank god for this
[1:16:39] message thank god for i said that we can
[1:16:42] see thank god he didn't just leave us in
[1:16:44] the darkest age the world has ever known
[1:16:47] just bumping around wondering where
[1:16:49] we're going
[1:16:51] no but in the darkest hour we have the
[1:16:52] greatest light that has ever shown on
[1:16:55] the face of the earth
[1:16:57] if you walk into anything blindly
[1:17:01] you don't know where you don't know
[1:17:03] where or what you're doing
[1:17:05] you can't even have confidence if you
[1:17:08] don't know what you're doing
[1:17:11] but you must understand
[1:17:14] what you are doing and why you're doing
[1:17:18] it
[1:17:20] now we're dealing with eagle vision
[1:17:24] listen listen to this eagle vision right
[1:17:26] here maybe pull you grab your bibles
[1:17:29] here paul
[1:17:30] writing
[1:17:31] to uh the philippians here
[1:17:42] you read this verse one it says paul
[1:17:44] and timotheus the servant
[1:17:47] servant of jesus christ to all the
[1:17:48] saints in christ jesus
[1:17:51] which are at philippi with the bishops
[1:17:53] and deacons so just you can gather from
[1:17:55] this right here this church had been
[1:17:57] established at philippi
[1:17:59] and and so paul would say in verse six
[1:18:01] he would say he which begun a good work
[1:18:03] in you he will perform it unto the day
[1:18:06] of jesus christ now as we go on to verse
[1:18:08] nine he say in this i pray that your
[1:18:10] love may abound yet more and more in
[1:18:13] knowledge and in all judgment that ye
[1:18:16] may approve things that are excellent
[1:18:18] that you may be sincere and without
[1:18:20] offense till the day of christ
[1:18:23] being filled with the fruits of
[1:18:24] righteousness which are by jesus christ
[1:18:26] unto the glory and praise of god
[1:18:29] but i would ye should understand
[1:18:31] brethren
[1:18:32] that the things which happened unto me
[1:18:34] have fallen out rather under the
[1:18:36] furtherance
[1:18:37] of the
[1:18:38] gospel
[1:18:40] so that my bonds in christ
[1:18:43] are manifest in all the palace and in
[1:18:45] all
[1:18:46] other places
[1:18:48] and many of the brethren in the lord
[1:18:52] waxing confident in my bonds
[1:18:55] are much more bold to speak the word
[1:18:57] without fear
[1:18:59] some indeed preach christ even of envy
[1:19:03] and strife
[1:19:05] and some also of
[1:19:06] goodwill the one preached christ of
[1:19:09] contention
[1:19:11] not sincerely supposing
[1:19:13] to add affliction
[1:19:15] to my bonds
[1:19:17] all right you you had me up to that
[1:19:18] point paul
[1:19:20] that's it
[1:19:21] i'm ready to fight
[1:19:24] let me have him who is it paul
[1:19:26] who's the one that's afflicting you
[1:19:27] who's the one that's causing this
[1:19:29] you're telling me that there's there's
[1:19:31] people that are preaching christ of
[1:19:33] contention they're not sincere and
[1:19:35] they're adding more afflictions
[1:19:38] you paul
[1:19:39] out of all people let me adam
[1:19:43] i'll go settle this
[1:19:45] you ain't gonna talk about my brother
[1:19:46] like that
[1:19:48] uh-uh
[1:19:50] you know i i was thinking about that for
[1:19:52] a little bit
[1:19:55] you know they have in combat sports and
[1:19:56] boxing and all those things they have
[1:19:58] what they call fight promoters
[1:20:00] and their job is to sponsor a fighter
[1:20:04] and find another fighter
[1:20:08] and make a fight
[1:20:11] and they have all this incentive
[1:20:13] they'll set the venue
[1:20:15] they'll get everything together
[1:20:17] and and that's their whole job is is to
[1:20:20] create a spectacle for people to watch
[1:20:22] and i was thinking about that he's like
[1:20:24] you know the devil is the biggest
[1:20:26] message fight promoter there is
[1:20:30] he's like well i'll get this brother
[1:20:31] over here he said and preach this and
[1:20:33] i'll get this brother over here and i'm
[1:20:35] going to set this venue over here and
[1:20:37] this will be his reward he'll get more
[1:20:39] popularity and i'll pay this are you
[1:20:41] kidding me
[1:20:43] because we get because we get carnal
[1:20:47] we start fighting other battles but not
[1:20:49] but i'm using this as an opportunity to
[1:20:51] show you eagle vision
[1:20:54] as we move through this scripture it's
[1:20:56] so easy maya
[1:20:58] you know it's like peter before his you
[1:21:00] know conversion you know they're coming
[1:21:02] to take jesus away they're fulfilling
[1:21:03] prophets he's like ah
[1:21:04] cut off your ear he's trying to go for
[1:21:06] his head no more you know but jesus you
[1:21:09] know hey these things have to happen
[1:21:12] you know you'll never wash my feet lord
[1:21:14] well if you don't don't watch your feet
[1:21:16] you don't know part way watch me all
[1:21:18] right
[1:21:19] you know sometimes we can be so carnal
[1:21:22] but see god has not left the bride blind
[1:21:25] in wandering around and groping in
[1:21:27] darkness but he has given her a vision
[1:21:31] and that vision is in a heavenly place
[1:21:34] in christ jesus
[1:21:36] now watch this
[1:21:38] he goes on to say but the other of love
[1:21:40] knowing that i am set for the defense
[1:21:43] of the gospel
[1:21:45] so after he said all this my if somebody
[1:21:47] was telling me you know hey this guy
[1:21:49] over here is preaching christ for
[1:21:50] contention
[1:21:51] and this one for envy and he's really
[1:21:53] making hard on this brother down here
[1:21:56] he's giving him a hard time like you
[1:21:57] know what we need to do something about
[1:21:58] this
[1:22:00] i mean would you would you be happy
[1:22:01] about that
[1:22:03] how many of you would be happy about
[1:22:04] that
[1:22:05] uh we should take up arms right we
[1:22:07] should do something to stop the madness
[1:22:11] but but but this is an ego right here
[1:22:15] that's writing
[1:22:17] in his position
[1:22:19] because you know when when you're in
[1:22:21] your position in heavenly places with
[1:22:23] that eagle vision
[1:22:24] you can see the end from the beginning
[1:22:27] and so when you're making decisions from
[1:22:30] that place
[1:22:32] some of the small little insignificant
[1:22:34] things that happen to us on a daily
[1:22:36] basis we're not looking at the moment
[1:22:40] but we're looking at the rapture we're
[1:22:42] looking at the transformation of our
[1:22:44] body we're looking all the way back to
[1:22:46] where we came from and where we're going
[1:22:49] so when that person cuts you off
[1:22:51] on your way to work
[1:22:52] oh my goodness i can't believe that
[1:22:55] person did that to me
[1:22:56] come on are you blind
[1:22:59] no wait maybe you are
[1:23:02] the test
[1:23:04] god loves to see the reaction of your
[1:23:06] temper no
[1:23:09] reaction of your faith no
[1:23:11] but if you're seated in heavenly places
[1:23:13] in christ jesus and you're having ego
[1:23:15] vision and there's that love and you're
[1:23:17] in the atmosphere and you're making
[1:23:19] decisions from that sphere from that
[1:23:21] place
[1:23:23] something he says lord
[1:23:24] maybe they're having a bad day
[1:23:27] may you bless them
[1:23:30] you know you're you're in the car and
[1:23:31] somebody starts uh going past you and
[1:23:34] what is it your foot just also gets a
[1:23:36] weight on it
[1:23:37] not gonna pass me
[1:23:43] the
[1:23:46] flesh you know if you're you know if
[1:23:48] your eye offends you well cut off your
[1:23:50] foot then if you've been
[1:23:52] i'd be standing on two stubs
[1:23:58] god's interested in those things
[1:24:00] that might sound funny
[1:24:03] but
[1:24:04] if if we're going to do the greater
[1:24:06] works
[1:24:08] i believe we're seeing them in
[1:24:09] manifestation i believe we've seen
[1:24:11] things temporary but even the prophet
[1:24:12] said you'll see things
[1:24:14] a manifest attempt temp temporarily
[1:24:16] there there's things that are happening
[1:24:17] we have testimony we've seen things
[1:24:20] god has been doing but by god's grace
[1:24:22] we'll get to a quote here a little later
[1:24:25] uh that'll just tie this all together
[1:24:27] but god's interested in those things
[1:24:31] in your daily life and in those
[1:24:33] decisions and from that heavenly place
[1:24:35] that's where we're making our decision
[1:24:37] i'm reading this portion of scripture to
[1:24:39] show you what paul would continue to say
[1:24:41] in verse 17 he'd say but the other of
[1:24:43] love knowing that i am set for the
[1:24:44] defense of the gospel what then
[1:24:46] notwithstanding every way
[1:24:49] whether in pretense
[1:24:51] or in truth
[1:24:53] christ is preached
[1:24:55] and i there and do rejoice
[1:24:59] yea and will rejoice
[1:25:03] that's eagle vision
[1:25:06] that is somebody speaking from a place
[1:25:08] in heavenly places that is seeing the
[1:25:11] end from the beginning and that could
[1:25:13] see this temporarily affliction and see
[1:25:17] these little things that are happening
[1:25:19] and seeing how maybe this one's doing it
[1:25:20] for the wrong reason and this one's
[1:25:22] doing it over there and this one's more
[1:25:24] fanatical than that one and this one's
[1:25:26] preaching it for contention and one for
[1:25:28] filthy looker and all these things but
[1:25:30] that that from that place way up there
[1:25:33] in heavenly places with that type of
[1:25:34] vision he can say you know what
[1:25:37] i rejoice that the gospel's being
[1:25:39] preached because he's free from the
[1:25:41] scandal of men
[1:25:43] free from those hurt feelings free from
[1:25:46] being pulled down into a fight or into
[1:25:49] something that you're not called to
[1:25:52] fight
[1:25:54] remember the devil's a good fight
[1:25:56] promoter
[1:25:58] and he's trying to make a lot of us
[1:26:00] fight a battle
[1:26:01] with our brothers and sisters and other
[1:26:03] things that we ain't got no business
[1:26:04] fighting
[1:26:06] the battle is the lord let's just move a
[1:26:08] little uh quickly here
[1:26:11] paul would uh be writing in second
[1:26:13] timothy 2 4 would say no man
[1:26:16] that worth entangled himself with the
[1:26:18] affairs of this life
[1:26:21] that he may please him who we have
[1:26:23] chosen
[1:26:25] him to be a soldier
[1:26:28] we entangle ourselves with so many
[1:26:30] things
[1:26:32] that we have no business
[1:26:34] getting involved in
[1:26:36] let's just keep moving
[1:26:38] i just say lord help me
[1:26:40] not to entangle myself with the affairs
[1:26:42] of the life and and get involved with
[1:26:44] all these other things that that don't
[1:26:46] have that out that you're not requiring
[1:26:48] me to be a part of i want to stay in
[1:26:50] those heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:26:53] because what does the scripture say
[1:26:54] where there's no vision that people
[1:26:56] perish
[1:26:57] the prophet said we must have a vision a
[1:26:59] vision comes to the prophets
[1:27:01] that's the word of the lord spoken to
[1:27:03] him
[1:27:05] the church we have a we have a vision
[1:27:09] we're not blind just bumping around
[1:27:12] wondering what's going on in lady osea
[1:27:15] just blind leaders of the blind know god
[1:27:18] by that revelation what this great
[1:27:20] mystery that god had in his mind from
[1:27:22] the very beginning of the world what did
[1:27:24] he say these are all things we're
[1:27:26] familiar with at the sounding of the
[1:27:27] seventh angel messenger when he begins
[1:27:29] to sound
[1:27:30] the mysteries of god should be finished
[1:27:32] i just want to read this because this is
[1:27:34] just exciting here and they would get on
[1:27:36] the home stretch we'll just uh be about
[1:27:38] another 10 15 minutes he says god had
[1:27:41] all this to himself it's a secret
[1:27:44] and that's the reason this is out of
[1:27:45] christ the mystery of god revealed he
[1:27:47] says and that's the reason there was
[1:27:48] silence in heaven for a space of half an
[1:27:50] hour and seven thunders uttered their
[1:27:52] voices
[1:27:54] john was even forbidden to write it see
[1:27:56] the coming of the lord
[1:27:58] that's the one thing he hasn't revealed
[1:28:00] yet of how he will come and when he will
[1:28:02] come it's a good thing that he doesn't
[1:28:04] know
[1:28:05] keep reading the quote now
[1:28:07] a lot of people like to stop right there
[1:28:11] he says he has showed or revealed it
[1:28:14] in every type that's in the bible
[1:28:17] therefore the entire bible is the
[1:28:18] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[1:28:21] the entire bible is an expression of one
[1:28:24] goal that god had one purpose he wanted
[1:28:26] to achieve in the entire bible
[1:28:28] all the acts
[1:28:30] of all the believers in the bible has
[1:28:32] been in type
[1:28:33] expressing what god's great goal is
[1:28:36] and now look at this and now
[1:28:38] in the last day
[1:28:40] he has revealed it and shows it
[1:28:43] and god's help we'll see right here this
[1:28:45] morning what the lord has had in his
[1:28:47] mind all along and has expressed it
[1:28:52] you know you're part of that expression
[1:28:55] everything has been in type
[1:28:57] everything all prophecy being fulfilled
[1:29:00] everything working up to this hour
[1:29:03] that you're living in right now you
[1:29:04] might feel like you're just trying to
[1:29:06] make it
[1:29:07] does anybody feel like they're just
[1:29:08] trying to survive you're just trying to
[1:29:10] make it
[1:29:12] you might feel that way but look the
[1:29:14] testing time is to show what you're made
[1:29:16] of
[1:29:17] it's to prove what's on the inside of
[1:29:19] you just like job you know god said have
[1:29:21] you considered my servant joe we know
[1:29:23] that the condition of the end time it's
[1:29:26] gotten to such
[1:29:29] undescribable condition because just
[1:29:32] like job just like god said to job have
[1:29:34] you considered my servant job and he let
[1:29:36] the condition get so bad around job
[1:29:40] but god knew what was on the inside of
[1:29:42] him
[1:29:43] there was a revelation in there there
[1:29:45] was a part of god inside of job that
[1:29:47] wouldn't quit that wouldn't back down
[1:29:49] that that revelation would spring forth
[1:29:51] god loves to test his children he loves
[1:29:54] to see the reaction of faith that is in
[1:29:57] the bride and god is allowing all the
[1:30:00] calamity russia the politics gas prices
[1:30:04] everything why because there's a great a
[1:30:07] precious word of life that has been
[1:30:09] planted in the believer and all of the
[1:30:12] pressure and all of the onslaught and
[1:30:14] everything that the believer is facing
[1:30:16] that something's inside of the believer
[1:30:19] that is springing forth into life
[1:30:23] he loves to test
[1:30:25] his children
[1:30:28] maybe if the musicians would come
[1:30:31] we'll find a place to
[1:30:33] wind down
[1:30:37] oh we love that quote
[1:30:39] as we've been going through the rising
[1:30:40] of the sun there has to come a real
[1:30:42] bride
[1:30:43] there gots to come one that has not only
[1:30:46] the mechanics
[1:30:48] but the dynamics
[1:30:51] and i just wanna maybe as we start to
[1:30:53] work towards a close here that starts
[1:30:55] with you
[1:30:58] that starts with you
[1:31:00] there's going to be a bride who not only
[1:31:03] has the mechanics
[1:31:05] and the dynamics that is you
[1:31:08] young people that is you
[1:31:09] we're we're not looking off
[1:31:12] for something in the way of yonder
[1:31:14] to come
[1:31:18] are y'all waiting for an eighth
[1:31:19] messenger
[1:31:21] are we waiting for some great ministry
[1:31:23] to come
[1:31:24] are we waiting for somebody else to get
[1:31:26] in their position no god is looking to
[1:31:28] you
[1:31:30] we're all looking off in the blue yonder
[1:31:32] for something to happen and you're the
[1:31:34] very one that god's counting on
[1:31:36] he's like no i want to manifest my word
[1:31:38] in you you're the bride you're the one
[1:31:40] that not only gets the mechanics but the
[1:31:42] dynamics also
[1:31:43] your your family
[1:31:46] your job your your life
[1:31:49] your atmosphere where you're living
[1:31:52] that's where god is wanting to manifest
[1:31:54] these things
[1:31:57] we got to get into position
[1:31:59] and i want to i'll read this quote here
[1:32:01] because it just struck me
[1:32:03] as i was thinking about all of us
[1:32:04] getting into our position you know it's
[1:32:06] like
[1:32:07] you ever get the family in the car and
[1:32:09] it's like
[1:32:10] you're waiting on somebody and it's like
[1:32:12] what is taking this along and they start
[1:32:14] running out to the car and then the next
[1:32:15] one runs in
[1:32:18] you're like wait a second here
[1:32:20] you know then they go in and then you're
[1:32:22] like well man
[1:32:23] i that's i might as well run in real
[1:32:24] quick so then everybody's back in the
[1:32:26] car and no one's ever in their position
[1:32:30] it's like everybody's loading the car
[1:32:31] there's no driver the driver's in the
[1:32:32] car and the car is not loaded
[1:32:35] you know what does it do to get
[1:32:37] everybody in there and their position
[1:32:38] and there's no dynamics
[1:32:41] listen to this brother branham says this
[1:32:43] and humble thyself
[1:32:45] this might sound like a group thing but
[1:32:47] it's very individual
[1:32:51] we look at this watch to find out what
[1:32:53] time it is
[1:32:55] unless that every instrument in that
[1:32:57] watch is coordinating
[1:32:59] one with the other
[1:33:00] we'll never know the correct time is
[1:33:02] that right
[1:33:04] and that takes all of us
[1:33:06] all together
[1:33:09] if we want to see the third pool
[1:33:12] really do something for god
[1:33:15] it's coordination
[1:33:16] with every one of us together
[1:33:19] to humble ourselves before god
[1:33:22] and confess our wrongs
[1:33:24] and pray and believe god for these
[1:33:26] things
[1:33:28] now that's a serious call to the church
[1:33:31] maybe you can lightly place something or
[1:33:34] set your wings to the woods of faith
[1:33:40] friends we're all longing for it
[1:33:42] we all want to see it
[1:33:46] but but but i wonder when you when we
[1:33:48] see needs in the church
[1:33:50] and we've been praying for things for a
[1:33:52] long time
[1:33:55] do any of you ever start to turn over
[1:33:57] leaves in your own life
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:02] or do we just let our brothers and our
[1:34:03] sisters continue in sickness and keep
[1:34:06] living
[1:34:08] our life
[1:34:11] your attitude towards the work can knock
[1:34:13] somebody out of their healing
[1:34:19] friends if we're going to do this we're
[1:34:20] going to do it together
[1:34:23] [Music]
[1:34:25] ain't none of us going to be left behind
[1:34:28] this rapture isn't going to go without
[1:34:29] you
[1:34:31] i don't care if you're living in sin
[1:34:32] right now and you got some worldly
[1:34:34] boyfriend or some worldly girlfriend and
[1:34:36] you don't ever know how you're going to
[1:34:37] be delivered maybe you're bound to
[1:34:39] pornography or maybe you're doing drugs
[1:34:41] or alcohol but there's something
[1:34:44] in your heart
[1:34:46] that knows
[1:34:48] that's not who you are
[1:34:52] as a servant of god i declare to you you
[1:34:55] don't
[1:34:56] have to stay like that any longer
[1:35:01] i don't know how much longer this show
[1:35:03] is going to go on
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:06] but we're doing it together
[1:35:10] and there's needs in our body there's
[1:35:12] people that we're believing to be healed
[1:35:14] i want to see the supernatural
[1:35:17] i want to see the third pool
[1:35:19] i want to see the spoken word i see the
[1:35:21] sheep wave i see the rising of the sun i
[1:35:25] say oh god bring me into my position
[1:35:29] i want to soar in heavenly places i want
[1:35:32] that eagle vision

[1:35:38] position where where i'm just left to my
[1:35:40] carnal mind and my carnal thinking but i
