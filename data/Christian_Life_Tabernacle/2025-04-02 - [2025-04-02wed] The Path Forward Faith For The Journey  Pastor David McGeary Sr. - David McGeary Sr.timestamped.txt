[25:50] just come and take these knees before
[25:51] the church.
[26:02] [Music]
[26:09] Let's just approach him
[26:11] together. Heavenly Father, Lord, we do
[26:15] come before you with grateful hearts,
[26:17] Lord. And we want to tell you thank you,
[26:19] Father, for your blessings, for the good
[26:22] reports, Lord. And Lord, if not for your
[26:25] grace and your love that's in our lives,
[26:27] Father,
[26:28] we would be so lost without you, Lord.
[26:31] And we just want to come before you with
[26:34] thanksgiving, Father. And Lord, that it
[26:36] would create a boldness in our hearts to
[26:38] know that truly you're for us, Father,
[26:41] and you desire good things.
[26:43] And Lord, you know what's on the heart
[26:45] of each person that's been gathered
[26:47] together here.
[26:48] And Lord, you're mindful and you care.
[26:51] And Father, we ask that our faith would
[26:53] rise up to believe that that's right.
[26:56] You have a provision for us and that
[26:57] your word is for us and that we would
[26:59] accept it. And Father, to put that upon
[27:02] our lips and to speak it and give you
[27:04] the glory, Father, that you desire and
[27:07] Lord, we commit the needs to you, our
[27:10] brother Darien. Father, that you would
[27:12] grant them favor, Lord, in the
[27:14] interview. And Lord, you're a provider.
[27:16] And yes, Lord, we're just trusting in
[27:19] you.
[27:20] And Lord, there's I know a hunger in
[27:23] each of our hearts,
[27:25] Father. And you've told us that blessed
[27:28] are they who hunger and thirst after
[27:30] righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[27:33] Lord, may your glory just touch each
[27:36] one,
[27:37] Father. We commit it all to you and ask
[27:40] that you'd be glorified. And Lord, just
[27:44] thinking of the camp. Lord, you knew
[27:46] there was a time as a young
[27:48] man, Lord, and to thank my brothers to
[27:51] go to minister at the camp, Father. Yes,
[27:53] Lord. Lord, just may your grace start to
[27:55] prepare a way, Lord. This was a heart of
[27:59] rebellion. Lord, I didn't want to go to
[28:01] that camp,
[28:03] Lord. But it was better that you would
[28:06] start a work,
[28:08] Lord. Lord, you're the same yesterday,
[28:11] today, and forever. Father, Lord, may
[28:13] you just be merciful to each young
[28:16] person's
[28:17] heart. And may you make a way, Father.
[28:21] We just commit it to you in the mighty
[28:22] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[28:27] You are the
[28:30] [Music]
[28:33] healer, healer of my heart.

[37:21] Lord
[37:24] forever. Amen. Let us pray.
[37:28] Father, where else can we put our hope?
[37:34] You alone are the creator of heaven and
[37:37] earth. You alone know the beginning from
[37:40] the
[37:41] end. Father, you alone created the plan
[37:46] and order the footsteps of the
[37:49] righteous.
[37:54] Father, to whom else could we
[37:57] go? For you alone have the words of
[38:00] eternal
[38:01] life. We just ask you to bless us
[38:04] tonight, Father.
[38:06] And as the
[38:09] world seems to hold less and less
[38:12] thoughts of
[38:14] you, the world seems to have less and
[38:17] less desire to acknowledge you.
[38:24] The church world
[38:26] is serving social issues
[38:32] and but yet, Father, we believe there's
[38:35] a people that want your will and your
[38:40] way. Let us be among those that are
[38:43] numbered, Father, that want to feast on
[38:45] your word.
[38:47] ask you to touch each heart tonight and
[38:49] bless each person. May they just rejoice
[38:53] in the good things of God and and just
[38:57] leave this place with their heart lifted
[39:00] up more confident in their
[39:04] election, Father, more determined to
[39:07] walk the straight and narrow. We ask it
[39:10] in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. And amen.
[39:14] God bless you tonight. Nice to be in the
[39:17] house of the Lord and to fellowship
[39:19] around God's word. If we have our
[39:22] Bibles, let's just open up. Uh I'm going
[39:26] to try not to be
[39:28] long and
[39:31] uh so what I'm so you can just sit there
[39:35] anticipating the end of the sermon. You
[39:39] know, when's this going to end? When is
[39:41] this going to end? You know what I mean?
[39:43] and uh and maybe it'll it'll uh be a
[39:49] blessing.
[39:51] Uh so I'd like to just read uh
[39:59] uh let's just read from uh the gospel of
[40:03] James and we just want to read the 27th
[40:07] verse and uh then a few verses in the
[40:12] second
[40:16] chapter in James 1 and 27.
[40:19] 7 says this pure
[40:23] religion and undefiled before God and
[40:28] the father is
[40:30] this to visit the fatherless and the
[40:34] widows in their
[40:37] affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[40:41] from the world.
[40:43] My brethren, have not the faith of our
[40:47] Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory,
[40:51] with respect of
[40:53] persons? For if there cometh unto your
[40:57] assembly a man with gold ring and godly
[41:01] apparel, and there come in also a poor
[41:05] man in vile reignment, and ye have
[41:09] respect to him that is that that weth
[41:15] the gay clothing, and say unto him,
[41:18] Sitest th out here in a good place, and
[41:21] say to the poor, Stand out there or sit
[41:25] here under my
[41:27] foottool and ye are then partial in
[41:31] yourselves and are become judges of evil
[41:35] thoughts. Hearken, my brethren, my
[41:39] beloved brethren, have not God chosen
[41:42] the poor of this world, rich in faith
[41:46] and hes of the kingdom which he had
[41:50] promised them that love him. But ye have
[41:54] despised the poor. Do not rich men
[41:57] oppress you and draw you before the
[42:01] judgment seat. Do not they
[42:05] blaspheme
[42:06] that worthy name by whom ye are called?
[42:12] If ye fulfill the royal law according to
[42:16] the scriptures, thou shalt love thy
[42:18] neighbor as thyself. Do ye well. But if
[42:23] you have respect to persons, you commit
[42:26] sin and are convinced of the law as a
[42:31] transgressor. And whoever shall keep the
[42:34] whole law and yet offend in one point is
[42:39] guilty of all. Amen. Our gracious
[42:42] father, we ask you to bless your word to
[42:45] us this evening. In Jesus precious name
[42:48] we pray. Amen. Amen. and God bless you
[42:51] tonight. You may be seated. We certainly
[42:56] uh trust that the Lord is blessing you
[42:59] and and you enjoy to be in the house of
[43:01] the Lord tonight. And uh we just have a
[43:06] little thought uh on our heart just uh
[43:11] maybe you know just kind of a
[43:13] evangelistic and and just some uh
[43:17] Christian principles. And if we had a
[43:20] title, uh, we'd like to call it, uh, the
[43:24] path forward, faith for the journey. And
[43:29] we've been talking about the path
[43:31] forward. And and the reason for that is
[43:36] is that it it's on my heart. Uh, several
[43:40] messages that our our messenger preached
[43:43] to it. One of them that he ministered to
[43:46] us was going beyond the camp.
[43:49] and and we can never forget that we are
[43:52] on a journey. We're pilgrims and we're
[43:56] strangers or we're seeking a city to
[43:59] come. So we're we're always hungering
[44:03] and thirsting after righteousness. We're
[44:07] we're always desiring in our heart to
[44:10] have more of God and to go uh further
[44:15] with God. In fact, th the whole purpose
[44:18] of of us being here tonight is to draw
[44:22] closer to God. That that this the
[44:25] scripture says, "If you draw nigh unto
[44:28] me, then I'll draw nigh unto you." And
[44:32] and so we see that that God is looking
[44:36] at us and just your effort to be here
[44:39] tonight pleases the Lord because he sees
[44:43] that you're here because you want to
[44:46] draw closer to him. And I think that's
[44:49] what we want to do. We want to draw
[44:51] closer to him. We want to know, are we
[44:53] on the path? Are we going forward? And I
[44:57] think that means a lot. I look at myself
[45:00] sometimes and I look back over and I
[45:03] say, "Well, I haven't gone as far as I
[45:06] want to." You know what I mean? And and
[45:09] what do we call it when you shrink back?
[45:12] when when you were you kind of were kind
[45:15] of in a good place at one time and then
[45:18] things sent you topsyturvy and all of a
[45:22] sudden you seemed like you've fallen
[45:24] back and and we say, "Oh, I've backslid
[45:27] or I've went backwards." You know what I
[45:30] mean? And and but it doesn't matter. You
[45:33] just get back up and you keep going
[45:36] forward. And so what what we don't want
[45:40] to do is we we don't want to set up a
[45:43] camp. And and what I mean by that is we
[45:47] finally get what we believe and we
[45:50] finally get what we teach and we finally
[45:53] get our dress code down and we finally
[45:55] get our church order down and we finally
[45:58] get everything set in a place and
[46:01] everybody's got their spot and their
[46:03] position and everything's kind of in
[46:07] order and and we know what we believe
[46:10] and so we're just going to sit back. You
[46:13] know what I mean? and and let everything
[46:15] just happen around
[46:18] us. And that's a condition that we don't
[46:22] want to get
[46:23] into. We all we want to be constantly
[46:26] listening to his voice. We we're we're
[46:30] ready for service. You know, we're we're
[46:33] here, Lord, what would Lord have me to
[46:36] do? Uh you know, we're we're seeking a a
[46:40] path forward. We're seeking more of him.
[46:42] We're seeking uh uh to draw closer to
[46:46] him. And we got to believe that there's
[46:48] more of him for us to
[46:51] know. Now, wouldn't it be sad if I
[46:53] walked up those steps and I came here
[46:56] and said, you know, I know all about God
[46:58] that there is to
[47:01] know. I'd just pack my bag. I just get
[47:06] up and say, "If here you that's where
[47:09] you're at and you know all there is
[47:12] about God to know
[47:14] adios." Well, you know, some people have
[47:17] that idea towards the word. You know,
[47:21] they've studied the Bible. They know the
[47:23] Bible. They know everything that's in
[47:25] the Bible. They know what Peter taught.
[47:27] They know what James taught. They know
[47:29] what uh Corinthians taught. They know
[47:32] the scriptures. They know all the
[47:34] verses. and and they know everything
[47:36] that there there is to know. You know, I
[47:38] I I've seen men that you start a
[47:41] scripture and they'll finish
[47:45] it. In fact, I'll be honest with you. I
[47:48] was in a service one time with brother
[47:50] Roy Borders and I was sitting there and
[47:54] brother Roy was preaching at the church
[47:55] and brother Roy started a a
[47:59] scripture and the man in the audience
[48:01] quoted it before he
[48:05] finished. Now Royy's been in a lot of
[48:07] meetings, brother Roy. So he he thought
[48:10] he'd put the guy to the test. So I
[48:12] watched him just take his Bible over and
[48:15] just flip it over here and he'd start
[48:17] reading someplace else and the guy
[48:18] finish
[48:21] it and then he'd flip back over here. So
[48:24] you know the one that really gets in the
[48:26] book of Revelations. Oh, he just fixed
[48:28] over Revelations and and the guy
[48:31] finished it. The guy knew the
[48:35] book. Now, why he knew the book is
[48:38] because I think he spent a lot of years
[48:41] in a little square room studying the
[48:45] book
[48:46] and he memorized the
[48:49] book and and so uh we took the man to
[48:55] the to the bus depot and and me and uh
[49:00] brother uh Ray Robson, we took uh the
[49:03] brother to the to the bus depot to get
[49:06] him a ticket. And we come to find out
[49:09] that he took his uh he had a ticket to
[49:13] Flag and then he changed bus and Flag
[49:15] and went down to Phoenix and he he took
[49:17] his ticket and he uh he hawkked it and
[49:22] sold it to somebody and then got a
[49:24] little bit of spirits to uh hold him
[49:28] through, you know. So he he wasn't in
[49:29] the best spiritual condition, but yet he
[49:33] could quote every scripture.
[49:36] And so finally Rey was so curious. He
[49:39] said, "Uh, where where are you coming
[49:41] from?" He said, "I'm coming from Wyomi."
[49:44] He says, 'Well, what were you doing up
[49:46] there? He says, "I was in an insane
[49:50] institution." And we said, "Well, what
[49:52] what were you doing in the insane
[49:54] institution?" He says, "Well, they put
[49:57] me in there for trying to commit
[50:00] suicide." And he said, "I don't know why
[50:02] they did that. I only tried it once.
[50:08] And that always stuck with me. Not not
[50:10] the humor of the story, but how could
[50:13] that he he he
[50:16] he
[50:17] knew the
[50:19] scripture and yet the letter
[50:25] killth and it's the spirit that good
[50:29] gives life. So you could you could set
[50:32] up camp.
[50:34] You know what I mean? You could get what
[50:36] what we believe. And we have we have the
[50:38] things we believe about water baptism.
[50:41] We have the things we believe about the
[50:43] Godhead. We have the things that we
[50:45] believe about the opening of the seals
[50:48] and the church age. And those are
[50:49] wonderful things to fellowship around
[50:52] that they they uh they throw your
[50:55] soul. I I love listening to it. Brother
[50:59] Ben's been working with me the last
[51:01] couple days and and he would put on
[51:04] brother Brandham's tape. He's listening
[51:06] to Brother Bram's tape and and you know
[51:08] I I'm just attracted to that voice. So I
[51:12] start following him around, you know,
[51:14] because I want to keep hearing what
[51:15] Brother Bram's saying. Finally, I said,
[51:17] "Ben, will you stay still so I can hear
[51:19] what he's
[51:23] saying?" See, we want to be moving.
[51:26] We want to be moving
[51:28] forward
[51:31] spiritually. We there's a path before us
[51:34] to go forward and and what is it that we
[51:38] we want to go we want to go uh forward
[51:42] in? What what is it that we want to uh
[51:46] we want to
[51:48] experience? We know we want to make the
[51:50] rapture, right? That's our that's that's
[51:54] a goal of our path. But there there's a
[51:57] journey to get
[51:59] there. You know, it's people don't even
[52:03] a seed. We understand that when a seed
[52:06] is planted, there's a journey for that
[52:10] seed. There's a path that that seed's
[52:12] got to take. Every seed's got a path
[52:16] that was predestinated within it. You
[52:19] know, a a a tree grows different than a
[52:22] corn stock and and a wheat stock. And
[52:26] it's got a path it goes. It's got
[52:28] certain ground that it it germinates in.
[52:31] It's got certain weather conditions that
[52:34] cause it to be pollinated. It It's got
[52:37] to find its
[52:39] path. It's got to find its
[52:42] journey in order for it to produce the
[52:47] fruit. And we want to be
[52:50] fruitful because the tree that's
[52:53] unfruitful is heed down and cast into
[52:56] the
[52:57] fire. The fig tree that didn't produce
[53:02] fruit. It was cursed in a type show
[53:06] showing us and the scripture tells us be
[53:10] neither unfruitful or
[53:12] barren. Well, we have to understand
[53:14] there's a path towards that.
[53:17] There there there's things
[53:20] that that you do for the journey in
[53:23] order to receive it. We just don't sit
[53:26] there and hope for
[53:30] it. We lay for ourselves a pattern of
[53:33] good
[53:35] works. We pray with without
[53:39] ceasing, seeking the face of the Lord.
[53:44] We believe with all our hearts. We
[53:46] believe that there's more of God.
[53:51] And and I I guess that we would sum it
[53:55] up in this journey that we don't want to
[53:59] walk this journey on our own. We want to
[54:02] walk it with him. We want him to be with
[54:04] us, him to be beside us because he
[54:07] promised it. I'll be with you even in
[54:10] you till the end. Well, we want to have
[54:13] that experience.
[54:15] We want to be blessed like that. We want
[54:18] to be more like
[54:21] him. And so, uh, I think that
[54:26] our final desire is that we want to be
[54:31] partakers of his
[54:34] nature. And we know his a his nature is
[54:39] summed up and manifested in his
[54:42] attributes.
[54:45] You know, we we know that he's
[54:47] merciful and we know that he's kind. We
[54:51] know he's our
[54:53] provider. We know that he's our
[54:56] counselor, our prince of peace, our our
[54:59] mighty
[55:01] God. And we just don't want to sit there
[55:06] and and he praises on them and say,
[55:10] "He's a mighty God.
[55:14] He's the creator of heaven and
[55:16] earth. But but we want to
[55:19] participate. Lord, counsel
[55:23] me. Lord, supply my
[55:27] need.
[55:29] Lord,
[55:30] uh you have
[55:33] wisdom and and you you're gentle and
[55:37] you're longsuffering.
[55:39] And we want to enter into the fellowship
[55:43] where the attributes that he
[55:46] possesses, we're in fellowship with
[55:49] those attributes and
[55:52] partakers of those attributes. I want to
[55:56] experience his
[55:57] attributes. Now, I know what it's like
[56:00] to have him show
[56:02] mercy. I know he's a healer.
[56:06] And I and I I I rejoice in the times
[56:09] that that that I felt his healing hand.
[56:13] I I just don't want to sit back and say
[56:16] he's this and he's
[56:19] that and and he and worship praise, but
[56:22] I want to participate in what I'm
[56:25] praising him
[56:27] for. Just like the word of God. I just
[56:30] don't want to read it because it's the
[56:32] word of God. I want revelation of it. I
[56:35] want it to speak back to me. I want to
[56:38] see what it
[56:41] says. And all you Bible readers, you
[56:44] know, when you started out, you marked
[56:46] certain
[56:48] scriptures and then you went on and you
[56:50] got a different color pen and a
[56:53] different color pen and and then you
[56:56] read something and you say, "I've read
[56:58] that chapter a hundred times and it
[57:00] means something different to me today."
[57:03] Why? because it's living word.
[57:07] You don't want to kill
[57:11] it. You don't want to kill it with
[57:13] creeds. You don't want to kill it with
[57:16] your
[57:17] ideas. You don't ever want to kill it
[57:20] thinking you already know what it
[57:23] means. Because I believe that the word
[57:25] of God never changes. But you change.
[57:30] And as you change, that word ministers
[57:33] to your
[57:37] change. And we should be
[57:42] changing. That's the idea about the
[57:45] journey. It's a journey of
[57:48] change. It It's a journey of
[57:51] transforming.
[57:53] As our messenger said, he said in uh I
[57:57] believe it was who who is this
[57:59] Malchisedc? He said it was a metamorphe.
[58:02] It was a the transl
[58:06] transforming going forward like the
[58:08] caterpillar and the stages of it. And he
[58:12] talks about the stages of the weed. He
[58:14] talks about the stages. We talk about
[58:16] the seven church age stages. What is it?
[58:19] It's a journey. It's a change.
[58:24] It's a
[58:25] path. We're going
[58:28] forward. So, first of all, we got to
[58:30] know that we're trying to go
[58:34] forward. We're not trying to
[58:37] stop. We're not trying to see who can we
[58:40] get in agreement with us. That was the
[58:43] problem that the children of Israel had.
[58:46] God told them, "Don't stop. Don't talk
[58:48] to those people. Don't mix with those
[58:50] people.
[58:52] If you use any of their water, if you
[58:54] use any of their land, pay them for
[58:57] it, but keep
[59:00] going. Keep
[59:03] moving
[59:05] and and you know, don't don't let
[59:10] anything discourage
[59:12] you. And so we're talking about a
[59:17] faith for the
[59:19] journey because we're gonna have to have
[59:22] a special kind of
[59:24] faith because after all we know one
[59:27] thing that if if the same spirit that
[59:30] was in Christ Jesus dwell in us that's
[59:33] what's going to quicken our mortal body.
[59:39] And James is speaking
[59:42] here. He's speaking about the idea of
[59:47] respective
[59:48] persons. Well, the whole principle is is
[59:52] that you don't have respect of persons.
[59:56] Well, you you don't have respect of
[59:59] situations
[1:00:00] either. There's our God can do anything.
[1:00:04] There's nothing impossible for him. And
[1:00:07] yet we have the things that we think God
[1:00:09] can do and the things that were not sure
[1:00:13] he can
[1:00:15] do. And it's the same
[1:00:18] thing. We have faith in regards to
[1:00:22] certain things and not faith in regards
[1:00:25] to other things. Part of our problem is
[1:00:28] is that not your problem. Excuse me.
[1:00:31] You're all saints, but I'll mark myself
[1:00:34] as the chiefest of all sinners. The part
[1:00:37] of my problem is is that I think there's
[1:00:41] only certain areas that I use
[1:00:47] faith. I don't need faith on the job.
[1:00:51] I I I got a contractor's card and I as a
[1:00:55] licensed electrician and and you know I
[1:00:59] I've got a utility contractor's license
[1:01:02] and I'm registered in three or four I I
[1:01:05] don't I don't need faith for that.
[1:01:10] See I have a
[1:01:12] respect. Most all of our
[1:01:15] faith all of what we feel that we have
[1:01:18] to have faith for is always comes down
[1:01:22] to healing.
[1:01:27] We need faith for spiritual advancement.
[1:01:31] We need faith so it's not with respect
[1:01:35] to persons.
[1:01:37] In other words, we can believe for with
[1:01:39] somebody that
[1:01:42] believes. I remember we first came into
[1:01:44] the
[1:01:45] message. Well, the first people we
[1:01:48] wanted to share the message with was the
[1:01:50] UPC people cuz they look like message
[1:01:53] believers. They got so tired of hearing
[1:01:55] about Brother
[1:01:57] Brano. You'd run up to them and say, "Do
[1:02:00] you believe in Brother
[1:02:01] Brano? You got a long dress on. You got
[1:02:04] long hair.
[1:02:07] you know, so oh, you know, they were all
[1:02:08] nice. Oh, yes, we heard of Brother Ram.
[1:02:11] It was a a had a great ministry. Thank
[1:02:14] you very much. And we couldn't go no
[1:02:19] further because we we had a respect. But
[1:02:23] yet some
[1:02:25] sinner, you know what I mean? Somebody
[1:02:27] that uh you know was on a street corner
[1:02:32] wasn't doing so good. you know, we we
[1:02:34] wouldn't sew a seed
[1:02:36] there because we didn't have no
[1:02:39] faith. And therefore, our faith became a
[1:02:44] respector of
[1:02:46] persons and and we let so many things
[1:02:50] keep our faith from working. Now, we're
[1:02:53] talking about a faith that we're going
[1:02:55] to need to have on this journey. And so
[1:03:00] that faith has got to become
[1:03:04] unencumbered. We can't let everything
[1:03:07] Satan throws up at
[1:03:09] us take our faith away from us.
[1:03:13] So that's why James said that what we've
[1:03:16] got to do is we got to keep
[1:03:19] ourselves unspotted from the
[1:03:23] world. We we've got to incorporate
[1:03:27] holiness in our life.
[1:03:30] We've we've got to we've got to
[1:03:33] steadfast
[1:03:35] resist
[1:03:37] temptation and and resist the the lust
[1:03:40] of the flesh and the lust of the eyes
[1:03:44] because those are things that that rob
[1:03:47] your
[1:03:49] faith because then you put yourself
[1:03:51] under
[1:03:52] judgment and now you even have respect
[1:03:55] of persons towards you and you don't
[1:03:58] feel that you can
[1:04:00] freely partake of the promises of
[1:04:05] God. And every bit of
[1:04:08] faith is based on
[1:04:11] promise. So, I'd like to read this
[1:04:13] statement to you that I was chasing
[1:04:16] Brother Ben all around the house
[1:04:20] uh trying to hear. And this is from uh a
[1:04:26] reaction to an
[1:04:30] action. So God's
[1:04:33] watching, how we
[1:04:37] react. And in this sermon, he talks
[1:04:39] about how God tests us, how he loves to
[1:04:43] test us. Brother Ram preached that many
[1:04:45] times. Be certain of God, understanding
[1:04:48] those things. But I I love what he said
[1:04:51] here. This is the story of Elijah and
[1:04:54] the meal offering. And it's the story of
[1:04:57] this. I'll just read it. When Elijah one
[1:05:00] time at the school of
[1:05:03] prophets had come up there and they sent
[1:05:07] some of them men out from the school and
[1:05:10] they didn't know the difference between
[1:05:12] wild gourds and and peas.
[1:05:18] Now, brother Bram says some
[1:05:21] prophets, you know,
[1:05:23] but he could say
[1:05:26] that. But he picked up a a lap full of
[1:05:30] wild gourds and throwed them into the
[1:05:33] pot and one of them screamed out,
[1:05:36] "There's death in the
[1:05:38] pot." Now listen, Elijah's now going to
[1:05:42] start describing faith.
[1:05:45] Elijah said, "Don't get
[1:05:53] excited." Our messenger said, "Don't get
[1:05:57] excited. Be still. Know that I'm God."
[1:06:03] No matter what the storm
[1:06:05] rages, no matter how high the billows
[1:06:09] rage, no matter how dark it seems to
[1:06:14] get, faith will stand
[1:06:17] there. You understand? Because as we go
[1:06:19] farther down this
[1:06:21] road, you get farther away from the
[1:06:26] camps, you get farther away from
[1:06:29] everybody's comfort zone. You've got to
[1:06:32] have a personal comfort in God's word.
[1:06:35] You have to have a perfect You have to
[1:06:37] have your own perfect connection with
[1:06:40] the voice and with the word of God and
[1:06:43] with the spirit of God. You got to know
[1:06:46] you have the Holy Spirit. You've got to
[1:06:49] know that you're forgiven. You've got to
[1:06:52] know that he walks with you. You got to
[1:06:54] know he promised you he wouldn't leave
[1:06:57] you nor forsake you.
[1:07:00] So no matter how bad he can paint the
[1:07:02] the picture,
[1:07:06] you know, the picture isn't what
[1:07:08] controls your life.
[1:07:11] You know what controls your life is the
[1:07:13] promise.
[1:07:17] That's what we live by.
[1:07:21] By these exceedingly great and precious
[1:07:24] promises, we're partakers of divine
[1:07:32] nature. This is a beautiful
[1:07:37] story. There's death in the pot. And
[1:07:40] Elijah said, "Don't get excited."
[1:07:44] He went and got a handful of meal and he
[1:07:47] throwed it into the pot and said,
[1:07:50] "Eat." Why? When Christ is put
[1:07:56] in
[1:07:59] death. When Christ is put into
[1:08:02] death, it don't matter when there's
[1:08:05] death. What? The wages of sin is what?
[1:08:08] Death.
[1:08:12] Right?
[1:08:13] Sometimes you're you're if if you don't
[1:08:16] feed, you'll starve.
[1:08:22] It doesn't matter if you I it don't
[1:08:25] matter what
[1:08:26] sickness you may have that's trying to
[1:08:30] take the life from you. And he says,
[1:08:33] "But when
[1:08:35] Christ is put into death, life comes in
[1:08:40] instead of death.
[1:08:43] I don't care how far you're gone,
[1:08:49] how low you've sunk,
[1:08:53] how immoral you are, how degraded you
[1:08:58] are, how sinful you are. When Christ
[1:09:03] comes into the heart, death fades away
[1:09:07] and life comes into the same place. from
[1:09:11] death in the pot to life in the pot.
[1:09:14] Hallelujah.
[1:09:19] That's part of the what we're going to
[1:09:25] need for the faith to complete the
[1:09:31] journey that if we put Christ into the
[1:09:34] situation, if we put the Lord into the
[1:09:37] situation, he'll take that situation and
[1:09:40] bring it to life.
[1:09:44] the life you want to live. You wouldn't
[1:09:47] be here tonight if you didn't want to
[1:09:48] live. Right.
[1:09:51] You say, "Well, I'm just here because
[1:09:52] I'm afraid to go to hell." Good enough.
[1:09:58] Wise. I'll take a church full of people
[1:10:00] that are afraid to go to
[1:10:03] hell. I'd rather have that than somebody
[1:10:06] just thinks that they they're so set on
[1:10:08] going to heaven that the word of God
[1:10:10] won't even put them under conviction.
[1:10:14] I'd rather have that little sinner boy
[1:10:16] saying, "Father, forgive me for I have
[1:10:18] sinned." than a house full of scribes
[1:10:20] and Pharisees saying, "Oh Lord, I've
[1:10:22] done this and oh Lord, I've done that."
[1:10:24] Why? He come to the poor of this world,
[1:10:27] rich in faith.
[1:10:30] He came to the sick, to the
[1:10:32] brokenhearted.
[1:10:36] Which one of us here isn't a sinner
[1:10:38] saved by grace?
[1:10:41] Oh my. I'll have you all to know that
[1:10:45] since the day I come out of my mother's
[1:10:47] womb, I never broke one promise, never
[1:10:50] told a lie, never stole anything, never
[1:10:54] said one bad thing about
[1:10:58] anybody. I'd be wearing my halo, but
[1:11:00] it's just too
[1:11:04] big. There ain't none of us like that
[1:11:08] yet.
[1:11:10] We'll draw conclusions about one
[1:11:13] another. We'll look at one another's
[1:11:15] lives. We'll we'll we'll think this
[1:11:17] person has faith and this person don't
[1:11:19] have faith. This person knows more about
[1:11:21] the message for so we think that they
[1:11:23] they're more apt to have faith than a
[1:11:25] miracle. And we build all these
[1:11:27] statuses. We build all these statuses.
[1:11:30] We build all these conditions. We build
[1:11:33] all these fake images. And none of it
[1:11:35] has to do with us.
[1:11:40] It has to do with putting the meal in
[1:11:42] the
[1:11:43] pot. Putting Christ in our lives.
[1:11:48] So how dark you fall, how big of a
[1:11:52] mistake you make, no matter how deep
[1:11:55] you've
[1:11:56] stumbled, if you let Christ,
[1:12:02] it'll put life back in your life.
[1:12:08] You say, "Well, I've done the same thing
[1:12:09] five times." You know what Jesus said?
[1:12:11] He said, "Forgive him 70 times 70." I'll
[1:12:14] tell you one thing I know about him. I
[1:12:16] don't know very much, but I know one
[1:12:18] thing. He practices what he preached.
[1:12:25] You got to have confidence.
[1:12:29] So, and if your heart condemns you,
[1:12:32] God's greater than your heart.
[1:12:37] So to have the faith to go forward, we
[1:12:40] know we're going to have
[1:12:41] to work real hard on keeping us spotless
[1:12:46] from the
[1:12:49] world. Cutting off the avenues that
[1:12:53] Satan gets to us in. Uh cutting off the
[1:12:57] sin that so easily besets us. Satan's
[1:13:00] got a punch coming and you got to
[1:13:03] protect that. You got to do what you
[1:13:05] can. You don't if someone drags you
[1:13:07] down, don't walk with them. Don't
[1:13:09] fellowship with them. Don't be around
[1:13:11] somebody every time you come back you're
[1:13:13] angrier and hotheaded and all
[1:13:18] mad. Just be
[1:13:20] polite. Bow
[1:13:24] out because you want to be
[1:13:26] right. This is the kind of
[1:13:29] faith we're going to need for the
[1:13:31] journey.
[1:13:34] Not a faith that's that is
[1:13:38] temporary, right? Not a faith, but it's
[1:13:41] got to be a faith that that you can't
[1:13:44] bluff. Now, you can't bluff it. You got
[1:13:47] to have it. You can't bluff it. Satan
[1:13:50] knows when you're bluffing. And he also
[1:13:53] knows when you've got it. Your heart
[1:13:55] condemns you not. And you're a
[1:13:58] Christian. You have a right to every
[1:14:01] promise that God made in his book.
[1:14:07] So
[1:14:09] you So what we're trying to bring out
[1:14:12] here tonight is that
[1:14:18] faith only comes by the word of
[1:14:23] God. So faith has to have a resting
[1:14:26] place, right? So, so faith is based on
[1:14:31] what promise you
[1:14:35] have. And we'll go to that here in just
[1:14:37] a moment and try to close. You have the
[1:14:40] right to every promise in this book.
[1:14:42] It's yours. No matter what the
[1:14:44] consequence is and what the outcome, you
[1:14:49] don't look at that. You look at the
[1:14:52] faith that God give you to the
[1:14:57] promise, then it stands there. Nothing
[1:15:00] will move it. It's the faith that God
[1:15:04] gives you to the
[1:15:07] promise. Now, sometimes we take faith
[1:15:11] and think it's something that we muster
[1:15:14] up like like strong will.
[1:15:21] You ever eat a meet a child that they
[1:15:24] just get
[1:15:25] stubborn? I ain't going to move. I ain't
[1:15:28] going to eat
[1:15:31] that. They'll just say no and they'll
[1:15:33] scream and they'll
[1:15:35] holler. You know what I
[1:15:37] mean? And and they've planted their foot
[1:15:41] down and nobody knows how to move that
[1:15:44] child.
[1:15:49] They just they're just
[1:15:51] stuck. Well, we know how to move a
[1:15:53] child. Spare the rod and you lose the
[1:15:58] child. I don't believe in beating kids.
[1:16:01] I believe you can spank them.
[1:16:03] Reasonable. But sometimes kids just
[1:16:05] needed enough to be able to
[1:16:13] go. I remember one time uh Davey took a
[1:16:18] a slingshot and and and so he took that
[1:16:21] slingshot. I hope I don't get you two
[1:16:23] guys mixed up, but he took that by the
[1:16:26] rubber and he swung it and that thing
[1:16:28] went out and bap and stabbed him in the
[1:16:33] head. And my dad really give him one and
[1:16:37] told him really
[1:16:40] uh really put it on him real
[1:16:43] hard and then after about 30 40 minutes
[1:16:47] he'd come in
[1:16:48] and you
[1:16:50] know and he sat next to grandpa and he
[1:16:53] says well grandpa I love
[1:16:59] you. That's the attitude.
[1:17:03] Lord, if I'm wrong, correct me.
[1:17:06] I want to be right.
[1:17:11] It's not going to change who you
[1:17:15] are. But if your heart condemns
[1:17:18] you, if it does not condemn you. So,
[1:17:22] let's on the journey going forward. You
[1:17:24] want the promise, you've got to make
[1:17:27] sure that you're meeting the
[1:17:28] qualifications for the promise.
[1:17:31] Confess, make right, bring forth meat
[1:17:35] meant for, you know, apply the
[1:17:38] token. Move those things out. Bring them
[1:17:40] under control. Purpose in your mind. I'm
[1:17:43] not going to read this stuff. I'm not
[1:17:45] going to watch this stuff. I'm not going
[1:17:47] to go do this. I'm not going to go do
[1:17:49] this. God, I surrender.
[1:17:55] lead me back
[1:17:59] because he wants to.
[1:18:03] He wants to be one with you. Father, may
[1:18:06] they be one as we are one. But if not,
[1:18:10] then we become respectors of persons. In
[1:18:13] fact, we even become respectors of
[1:18:18] ourselves. Oh, I'm not good enough.
[1:18:22] But he said, "No matter how low you are,
[1:18:26] no matter how degraded you are, you put
[1:18:29] Christ into
[1:18:31] death and life will take its part." So
[1:18:36] we we don't want nothing that's
[1:18:38] fake, you
[1:18:40] know. And when real faith catches the
[1:18:43] vision, it can't keep
[1:18:48] silent. No, I say, excuse me. And when
[1:18:51] real faith has caught the vision, it can
[1:18:53] keep
[1:18:54] silent and rest
[1:18:57] calmly because it knows it's going to
[1:19:00] happen.
[1:19:02] Don't
[1:19:03] forget
[1:19:08] that. It don't have to be stress. I
[1:19:13] believe I believe I'm going to make this
[1:19:16] happen. you know, I'm going to have such
[1:19:18] positive faith and and such
[1:19:22] No, what's the vision? It's in his
[1:19:26] hands. It's his
[1:19:29] promise. Your faith is in
[1:19:32] what? What he
[1:19:34] promised. And I'm gonna just read a
[1:19:37] couple more statements and and just hope
[1:19:39] that when it's all said and done, we can
[1:19:43] understand we're talking about a kind of
[1:19:46] faith for the
[1:19:49] journey. Not a temporary faith for a
[1:19:54] circumstance. Not a temporary faith for
[1:19:58] a challenge.
[1:20:00] Not something that we we've that we is
[1:20:03] called into action by desperation, but
[1:20:07] in every day believing that every
[1:20:11] promise in the book is mine. And every
[1:20:15] promise in that book applies to me. And
[1:20:19] I have a a I'm
[1:20:21] entitled to every promise in this book.
[1:20:27] No matter what it is, I'm entitled to
[1:20:33] it. But sometimes we get such respect to
[1:20:37] persons that we don't even believe it's
[1:20:40] entitled to
[1:20:42] us. We take ourselves out of the
[1:20:45] equation. And it's good for everybody
[1:20:47] else but not me. If it's good for
[1:20:51] anybody, it's good for you. because
[1:20:54] God's not a
[1:20:55] respector of persons. And he says,
[1:20:59] "Don't forget that faithful rest with
[1:21:02] perfect assurance." No matter what the
[1:21:05] storms are
[1:21:07] saying, how contrary it looks. Faith
[1:21:11] rest with assurance.
[1:21:14] Faith can take it and stand upon a
[1:21:19] rock. Look into a grave or into the
[1:21:23] waters where a lovely little chunk of
[1:21:27] your own heart has been buried. And
[1:21:31] faith can look across the sea to him
[1:21:34] that said, "I am the resurrection and
[1:21:37] the life." Faith rests assurance.
[1:21:44] So, so we see
[1:21:47] how in
[1:21:50] important it is
[1:21:53] because there's something about faith
[1:21:57] that we've got to understand that faith
[1:22:01] has two
[1:22:04] parts. And too many
[1:22:06] times, you know, it's like an
[1:22:09] epoxy. You know, we I was in the
[1:22:12] painting business for a while and we
[1:22:14] have the paint there and he I sent a man
[1:22:17] to the paint store and he took two part
[1:22:21] A's and he got on the job and he put
[1:22:24] those part A's in a bucket and he mixed
[1:22:28] them up and then he rolled the whole
[1:22:30] floor, showroom
[1:22:33] floor with part A
[1:22:40] and 6 hours. It wasn't hard. So, we put
[1:22:44] some heaters in there overnight. It
[1:22:47] wasn't
[1:22:48] hard. Somebody got to the job before us
[1:22:53] and of course he thought they painted
[1:22:54] this yesterday and he walked out across
[1:22:57] it and he got out in the middle and it's
[1:23:00] a sticky gooey mess. He left out a
[1:23:04] part. And if you leave out the
[1:23:07] part, it doesn't
[1:23:11] solidify, if I could use the the thing,
[1:23:14] it doesn't
[1:23:17] hold. So, we So, we want a faith for the
[1:23:22] journey, a faith that doesn't have to be
[1:23:24] worked up, a faith that's at rest, a
[1:23:28] faith that has confidence. One of my
[1:23:31] favorite scriptures is that if he
[1:23:33] started the work, he'll finish it.
[1:23:36] That's a promise. I can rest on that. I
[1:23:40] can hold to that. I can believe in it.
[1:23:43] No matter how low I get, I can look up
[1:23:47] and grab a hold of that
[1:23:51] promise. I can't rescue myself, but he
[1:23:54] will rescue me by his promised word.
[1:24:00] cuz we have the faith of Abraham.
[1:24:04] We believe that God's able to perform
[1:24:07] that which he promised.
[1:24:13] You can't create a promise that God
[1:24:15] didn't make and then expect him to do
[1:24:20] it. He gave us every promise we need to
[1:24:25] make it.
[1:24:27] And that's what faith does. It links up
[1:24:29] to the promise. I'd like to close with
[1:24:34] this quotation.
[1:24:38] And
[1:24:40] and he
[1:24:42] says, "And the
[1:24:45] spirit and the spirit Jesus told the
[1:24:48] woman at the well." He said, "The time
[1:24:51] has
[1:24:52] come when God seeks people that will
[1:24:56] worship him in spirit and in
[1:25:00] truth." That's the word with the spirit.
[1:25:07] Some people has the word, other has the
[1:25:11] spirit. But when you get spirit and
[1:25:14] truth
[1:25:15] together, something has got to
[1:25:21] happen. Let us read
[1:25:24] farther. And it was just a little bit,
[1:25:28] just a little bit, but it was all she
[1:25:32] needed.
[1:25:34] God, let this sink deep into the
[1:25:37] people's heart. When the prophet of God
[1:25:39] makes statements like that, let it sink
[1:25:41] deep. I my antennas go
[1:25:46] up. In other words, it's he's saying
[1:25:49] this is something the people need. It's
[1:25:52] not just a healing service. It's not
[1:25:54] just an evangelistic service. It's
[1:25:57] almighty God speaking through his
[1:25:59] prophet messenger giving the church what
[1:26:03] they have need
[1:26:06] of and we don't want to take part of
[1:26:10] it. We got to have it according to
[1:26:14] formula spirit and
[1:26:17] truth. Some people have the
[1:26:19] spirit they don't stay with the word.
[1:26:23] Some people have the word and they don't
[1:26:24] have no life, no
[1:26:26] spirit, nothing to make put the word
[1:26:29] into action, nothing in their lives that
[1:26:32] lets them anchor on that promise till
[1:26:35] they feel the reality of that promise
[1:26:39] coming to pass in their life and they
[1:26:41] know they're a partaker of the divine
[1:26:44] nature of God because that attribute is
[1:26:47] manifesting in their lives.
[1:26:51] We're entitled to
[1:26:53] that. That's God's promise for us.
[1:26:56] That's what he wants for us. For you to
[1:26:59] partake of divine nature and have divine
[1:27:02] nature alive in your life. He don't care
[1:27:06] about your
[1:27:08] religion. You can't be religious enough
[1:27:10] for
[1:27:11] him. You can't be righteous enough for
[1:27:16] him. Our righteousness is as filthy
[1:27:21] rags. But you can have a heart for
[1:27:25] them. David had a heart for him. A
[1:27:28] friend of
[1:27:31] God.
[1:27:33] Abraham. Look at these
[1:27:35] guys. Their lives seem to be in
[1:27:38] shambles. But the only thing that beat
[1:27:40] on their hearts, they wanted him.
[1:27:43] So he he says he
[1:27:46] says so she only had a little bit of
[1:27:49] meal and a little bit of
[1:27:54] oil.
[1:27:56] Now the prophet God wants this to sink
[1:27:59] in. It don't matter how
[1:28:06] much if you have
[1:28:08] faith the size of a mustard seed. We've
[1:28:14] heard that parable over and over again.
[1:28:16] But we're never satisfied with mustard
[1:28:18] seed faith. We want to we want to make
[1:28:22] up our own big faith.
[1:28:27] He don't need your faith to do
[1:28:32] anything. The only faith that he's
[1:28:34] looking for is not a faith that
[1:28:37] produces, but a faith that believes.
[1:28:42] This is
[1:28:43] true. God made the
[1:28:46] promise. The promise is to me. He's able
[1:28:50] to keep
[1:28:51] it. He's able to change me. He's able to
[1:28:55] change the circumstance. He's able to do
[1:28:59] exceedingly and abundantly
[1:29:03] above what I can ask or
[1:29:06] think. Oh, then you start resting. Hey,
[1:29:10] the Lord has this. And so he says this.
[1:29:14] He says, "But it was all she needed.
[1:29:18] God, let this sink deep into the
[1:29:21] people's heart. You may be down to your
[1:29:24] last
[1:29:25] handful. I've heard people say, "I don't
[1:29:29] have very much faith, Brother
[1:29:32] Brandham." But
[1:29:35] what but what you
[1:29:37] got, if it's real faith, mix it with
[1:29:42] God's word and look what it will
[1:29:49] do. See, you have faith.
[1:29:52] But you got to mix it with the
[1:29:54] word. You've got to take that faith and
[1:29:58] find a promise
[1:30:02] and take that promise out of the word of
[1:30:04] God and personalize
[1:30:07] it. If you just have the
[1:30:10] faith and you don't have the spirit and
[1:30:13] the
[1:30:15] word mixed
[1:30:18] together, then it's not complete.
[1:30:22] It's got to be
[1:30:24] mixed. I go continue and close
[1:30:28] it. You may be down to your last
[1:30:30] handful. I've heard people say that,
[1:30:32] Brother Bram, but what you got if you
[1:30:35] real faith mix it with God's word. Look
[1:30:38] what he'll do. You say, "Well, Brother
[1:30:40] Brandham, I've been to every
[1:30:44] doctor, been at every clinic. Oh, I've
[1:30:47] joined church for my sins and I've done
[1:30:53] this. I can't
[1:30:55] help what all you've
[1:30:58] done. What little
[1:31:01] faith. You got enough faith to be out
[1:31:05] here tonight. Then mix that with the
[1:31:08] word and get
[1:31:11] ready. She stirred it up together.
[1:31:14] That's the only thing between her and
[1:31:17] death. That may be the only thing left
[1:31:21] for you tonight. Between you and death
[1:31:24] is what little spirit that you can
[1:31:28] muster up in your heart to believe it.
[1:31:32] Mix it with God's eternal word. And when
[1:31:37] she
[1:31:38] did, I can see her put her little ragged
[1:31:42] curtain back and look in and the little
[1:31:45] boy holding his little stomach. Mother,
[1:31:49] are you ready to cook the little
[1:31:53] cake? And and uh and she stirred it up
[1:31:57] together. That's the only thing between
[1:32:00] her and death. That may be only thing
[1:32:02] left for you tonight.
[1:32:05] between death is what little spirit you
[1:32:08] can muster in your heart to believe it.
[1:32:09] Mix it with God's eternal word. And when
[1:32:12] she did, I can see her pull the ragged
[1:32:14] curtains back. The little boy holding
[1:32:15] his stomach. Mother, mother, are you
[1:32:18] cook the little cake? Yes, dear. Just a
[1:32:21] few minutes. Mother's mixing it up.
[1:32:24] Mother's breaking into two. And you take
[1:32:28] half of it. Oh, honey. And we'll take
[1:32:30] care of that. And what was it now? The
[1:32:34] word and spirit mixed together. And you
[1:32:39] know the rest of the story. She walked
[1:32:42] out there and she heard the
[1:32:46] voice. Give me to
[1:32:48] drink. Give me to
[1:32:51] eat.
[1:32:52] So what was her story?
[1:32:56] See, we don't if we get into the spirit
[1:33:00] of
[1:33:03] it. You see, everything that we're
[1:33:07] involved in has two
[1:33:12] ends. Don't forget, no matter what your
[1:33:14] problem is, there's another
[1:33:17] end. God works on both
[1:33:22] ends. He works on both ends.
[1:33:26] Don't forget there's another end. Don't
[1:33:28] forget there's another
[1:33:32] part. God's already
[1:33:36] working. He's already working on the
[1:33:38] other side. He made the promise. He's
[1:33:41] already working to fulfill it.
[1:33:45] He wants you to take what little faith
[1:33:47] you have, what little spirit you can
[1:33:50] muster up and mix it with his word,
[1:33:54] knowing he's on the other
[1:33:57] end. He's working on your
[1:34:00] behalf. You say, "Brother McGary, you
[1:34:02] don't know how afraid I am." It don't
[1:34:04] matter. His word promised to cast out
[1:34:06] all fear.
[1:34:08] You can say, "I'm afraid of this, and
[1:34:11] I'm afraid I'm going to get sick, and
[1:34:13] I'm afraid I have that." Don't let that
[1:34:16] rule your life. Take that
[1:34:20] promise, take that desire in your heart,
[1:34:24] mix it with the eternal word of
[1:34:26] God. Find yourself a promise to anchor
[1:34:31] that faith
[1:34:32] to because you've got to mix it with the
[1:34:36] word. It's got to be mixed together.
[1:34:39] Faith for this journey has two
[1:34:44] parts. It has what your spirit can
[1:34:47] muster and the word of God. It's got
[1:34:50] truth and life. Truth and
[1:34:54] spirit. Spirit and truth. And when they
[1:34:58] get mixed together, it produces the
[1:35:02] result. And if we need faith for this
[1:35:04] journey, we've got to be absolutely
[1:35:08] assured of two things. One, it's by the
[1:35:11] promises of God that we're partakers of
[1:35:15] his attributes. And he promised he
[1:35:18] wouldn't lose a one. And that's what our
[1:35:21] faith is. Our faith is I can be a
[1:35:25] partaker of divine nature. I can be a
[1:35:28] partaker of his mercy. I can be a
[1:35:31] partaker of his kindness. I can be a
[1:35:33] partaker of his justice. I can be t
[1:35:36] partaker of his
[1:35:38] forgiveness, of his
[1:35:40] strength, of his
[1:35:43] deliverance. All that he
[1:35:45] is, he is for
[1:35:49] me. And I'm going to believe what he
[1:35:52] said. And I'm going to put all that I
[1:35:54] have into it. Doesn't have to be a lot.
[1:35:58] just a little bit that makes you reach
[1:36:03] out and seek for that word to hold on
[1:36:07] to. Remember, he's alive and he's
[1:36:12] working on the other end. So, this faith
[1:36:16] for the journey is a long range faith.
[1:36:19] It's not a shortterm faith. It's not a
[1:36:22] faith that you have to uh just get up to
[1:36:27] get something
[1:36:29] done. It's not a faith that you got that
[1:36:32] you got to
[1:36:33] rev. It's a
[1:36:35] resting
[1:36:37] assurance that every promise in the book
[1:36:40] is mine. Every chapter, every verse,
[1:36:44] every line. He called me and I answered.
[1:36:50] I confess my sins. He was just and
[1:36:53] faithful to forgive
[1:36:58] them. And if I stray, he'll leave the
[1:37:02] 99 and come find
[1:37:05] me. If I get prodal, I know in my
[1:37:08] father's house there are
[1:37:11] servants that are living better.
[1:37:15] and I'll come to myself and I'll return
[1:37:18] to my father's
[1:37:20] house and the father will kill the
[1:37:23] fatted calf for you. He'll put the robe
[1:37:26] of all his promises on. He'll restore
[1:37:29] you to your sunship and your
[1:37:32] daughtership. He'll take you back for
[1:37:34] what you were with him eternally. And
[1:37:37] we're going to need this kind of
[1:37:39] faith. A faith that's so sure. A faith
[1:37:43] that's relaxed. to face that steadfast.
[1:37:46] We're going to need that kind of
[1:37:48] faith for this journey. So the path
[1:37:53] forward is the faith for the journey.
[1:37:57] Let's don't go forward without
[1:38:00] faith. Without it, it's impossible to
[1:38:05] please God. Amen. It's simple.
[1:38:09] Take what's in your heart, mix it with
[1:38:12] the eternal word, and watch what God
[1:38:15] will do. God bless you tonight. Lord, be
[1:38:17] with you. Bill, could you lead us some
[1:38:20] some
[1:38:27] worship? Amen. I tossed in.
[1:38:38] Amen. Mixing our faith with his word
[1:38:41] that he may work for
[1:38:45] us. Bless. See, blessed
[1:38:50] [Laughter]
[1:38:52] assurance Jesus is
[1:38:58] mine. Oh, what a
[1:39:03] forest of glory divine.
