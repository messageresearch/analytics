amen good to be gathering the house of God this morning and I want to welcome everyone and we turn around and welcome someone this morning amen all our visitors we're certainly happy to have you with us God bless you but have your seats as we invite brother Mike for us so I'm reading this month thank you good morning I uh I'm always impressed every year when people embark on reading through the Bible in a year I've never been very good at that I usually make it a chapter or two and next thing you know I'm going down this way and going down the next way I don't know how anybody is able to read through the Bible in a year I guess I read all over the Bible every year it's the same thing happened to me as I was kind of going through Psalm 5 we're going to read that this morning and you know it's a beautiful prayer really of David but what what caught my attention as we read that this morning is what David was asking for in his prayer you know we go before the Lord we have things we lay before him in prayer and asking for certain things asking for guidance asking for leadership but what's interesting in Psalm 5 is what he was asking for and it starts out give ear to my words O Lord consider my meditation hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my God what he's asking for is that his words that has meditation that the voice of his cry would be something that he could hear you know I got to thinking about that give ear to my words consider my meditation hearken unto the voice of My Cry so he said it this way in Psalm 19 14 he said let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord you know I began to wonder what are my words what is my meditation what is the voice of My Cry and is it something he can hear is it something that's acceptable that he can receive you know there's a certain sound that he's looking for he only hears what he's listening for an acceptable sound you know James said in 4 verse 3. he said you ask and receive not because ye ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lusts there are many examples in scripture of the Lord not hearing of the Lord not inclining his ear of the Lord not hearkening or that the meditation of the heart was unacceptable but there is an acceptable voice an acceptable meditation something he can hear something he can consider you know David's prayer was that his words might be something that he can hear that his meditation might be something he could consider you know one of the things that we've read before in the scriptures several times as we've gone through this is that David was a man after God's Own Heart in other words his heart his desire his passion was the same as God's they had the same heart the same desire the same passion you know and when I read a scripture where David is asking that his words might be something he can hear or that his meditation might be something that he can consider or that the voice of his cry might be something he can hearken to the question is is his desire of his heart match that of the Lord something he can hear and receive just kind of going through that and you know what's our meditation we read in Psalm 119 a few weeks ago verse 97 oh how I love thy law it is my meditation all the day the word being his meditation the man who was after God's Own Heart you know is our meditation is my meditation on my need on my burden on my frustration or is it on his word you know whenever we have worry or fear or doubt it's an example it's a it's this clue that we might be meditating on the wrong thing you know instead of meditating on what he said we meditate on what might happen you know we pray all the time lord If It Be Your Will do this or if it Be Your Will do that but you know how many times do we stand on what we know to be his desire and declare it that our heart matches his heart you know it's not about us convincing him to share our desire it's about us about our desire matching his what words could we say that are acceptable something he can hear outside of his own word because his desire is his word you know in James 4 when we read that ye ask and receive not because he asked amiss that you may consume it upon your lust it's an example of not having his desire but our own or our desire isn't a match and as we read Psalm 5 we're going to see David listing some examples of things he can't receive well he does consider his word in Matthew 21 21 Jesus said this verily I say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if he shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive and what's the basis of our faith of Faith his word you know the flip side John 5 19 the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for whatsoever things he doeth these also the son likewise verse 30 I seek not mine own will not my own desire but the will of the Father which hath sent me or in other words it's thus saith the Lord or keep still what is the words what is the meditation what is the voice of our cry does it match his desire is it his word you know it got to such a place with Jesus that when Peter said you know Lord If It Be Your Will let's build this great work let's do this great religious thing but when the Lord spoke in Matthew 17 5 he said this this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him you know and I got to thinking about that there's such a place where one can get to where they're so connected with the heart of God and what the Lord wants done with his word that instead of us asking that he would hear our words he would be able to say hear your word because it matches his you know and I thought as I started reading that you know Lord I pray that I could get to such a place that the things that I say could be in such alignment with your heart that you could say hear him this is my beloved Son what he says what he asks for what his meditation is matches mine you know that was the prayer that I had as we pray like David did Lord may my words be something you can hear may my meditation be something you can consider you know I just we can go ahead and stand as we start to read Psalm 5. isn't that even what the ministry of Malachi 4 was sent to do to restore the hearts of children to the fathers to make the hearts match that our desires would be the same as his you know my prayer would be that Lord with my words would my meditation would My Cry match your desire so much that you can say this is my son hear him it matches my heart let's just read that together Psalm 5 just a shorter Psalm this morning give ear to my words O Lord consider my meditation hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my God for unto thee will I pray my voice shalt thou hear in the morning O Lord in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and will look up for thou art not a God that hath pleasure and wickedness neither shall evil dwell with thee the foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers of iniquity Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man but as for me I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy and in thy fear will I worship toward thy Holy Temple Lead Me O Lord and thy righteousness because of mine enemies make thy way straight before my face for there is no faithfulness in their mouth their inward part is very wickedness their throat is an open Sepulcher they flatter with their tongue destroy thou them o God let them fall By Their Own counsels cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions for they have rebelled against thee but let all those that put their trust in thee Rejoice let them ever shout for Joy because thou defendest them let them also that love thy name be joyful indeed for thou Lord will bless the righteous with favor wilt thou Compass him as with the shield amen thank you amen God bless you have your seeds [Music] oh yes I spent Infinity [Music] [Music] [Music] true in my

this morning in your word unfolded to us father I pray in Jesus precious and wonderful name amen amen God bless you may be seated this morning we have a couple announcements to make and so I want to make the most important one first if uh if we could do that this morning we we'd like to announce uh to you that uh rather true donae and sister veronique omadi would like to announce the engagement of their daughter Grace to Brother Joseph gindu and they are here with us this morning so where are you [Applause] now I called them I call them Joseph gin don't but but he did so they are but anyway I I really I really like brother Joe stuff and I I really think they're a marvelous marvelous fit together and I'm so happy for them both I've laid them down the One requirement he understands that and we had wonderful Fellowship so I I'm really thrilled and they both come from wonderful families and a lovely expression of who that they are and what they're going to be together so I just really uh I'm really happy amen so kind of Thrills my heart you know they go and also I have the second important announcement to announce to you this is a building so after the three and a half years fighting the city of Bedford we have our we have our building permit and we'll be starting construction very soon again parents are going to have to be very uh watchful of your children um also this month we're going to start installing the landscaping and the sprinkler system and we're going to have to wait till the very end of March to put in the grass but Lord willing by the first of April will be able to have the kids go out and play on the grass out there and we'll start be able to move them out of the parking lot and we will start construction and and we just need to keep them out of those areas so with your help we're going to do it I am not going to sing a special and and I don't know what you sing for an engagement that you know but anyway we appreciate our musicians and everybody for playing for us we I'm excited about the word this morning the only thing I'm not excited about is my inability to bring it the way that it needs to be brought but with your help you you understand you've got to read between the lines you've got to pull it out you've got to fill in the blanks and I I trust if we could do that this morning it would be a blessing to us we have been studying the God of this evil age and the purpose in our heart of studying that is so that we could recognize him recognize what it is that he's trying to accomplish what it is that he's doing and how that he's doing it we realized he was doing it through science education and civilization and he wanted to be worshiped the way that God was worshiped in fact he wanted to exalt themselves above the stars and the angels of God he wanted to exalt himself above the message that God would bring down Through the Ages he wanted to set up on the throne of God and be worshiped as God and in our study of that we wanted to come to the understanding that millions and billions of people are worshiping him and don't know it we saw that he's also very religious and he appears as an angel of Light and our wisdom as children babes cannot discern between good and evil and right and wrong that's why you have to go to Little Johnny and go no no no no no don't do this don't do that you're trying to teach them what's right and wrong you're trying to teach them the discipline of following which is right the discipline as us as Believers as staying with the word and so we we saw those things and we looked at those things because if we realized we're going to have to identify him because we understand that there's two things that make the church strong and an invincible Army that's one when they recognize the enemy in every single one of his tricks amen and withstand him and then when you can withstand them you can see them you can know what he is even though he appears as an angel we know Martin the great uh a messenger and and Saint Satan appeared to him act and said Martin it's me the Lord Jesus and he said Fall Down and Worship me and Martin stood back and uh uh and it was a religious feeling no doubt and there was an anointing no doubt but he noticed one thing he noticed that he was wearing a crown and that identified him because he was trying to exalt himself as king above the Stars and so he said wait a minute that's not what the word of God said the word of God said we would crown him so if he recognized them and he said get behind me you deceiver you know what I mean okay and so I would like to think and I'd like to wish in my heart that every single one of you would be free from Satan trying to influence you but I can't say that because the word of God says that Satan is like a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour I would like to be there with you to fight every single battle for you but I cannot crawl inside of your mind and that's where your battle is right so you have to fight the battle you have to do the war but I know one thing the one thing is is that we have access to the best weapon there is and that's God's word that's what he gave us to fight our battle with is his word God's word is what prevails I I cannot solve all the problems I would love to come up with solution for every marriage problem for every personal problem for every demon there is I'd like to be able to sit down and do those things but God didn't provide me to be the way to do that he provided his word at Faith in his word is the victory I've had people I I couldn't even save my own children I would have if I could I I would have loved to have been able to to do something that would cause them to be saved but I did have a promise and the promise was if I waited raised them up in the way that they should go that they had returned to it and I just can only leave that into God's hands look this morning we have to understand that we are in a world that's changing it's changing rapidly and it's not changing for our betterment and there's going to come a time when we that we will not be subject to it they may turn this into a big storehouse we have been warned that that's a possibility they make they may try to keep us from preaching the gospel that we preach because it's not sociably acceptable to to what Satan's Eden is and the the true word of God does not worship Satan what worship Satan is a lie because he's the father of lies and there's no truth in him so when someone preaches the false gospel they are telling a lie oh Satan loves that he worships that is wonderful he loves the lie but the truth is the only thing that sets you free is the truth okay and and you say well what are we being set free from we're being set free from idolatry by worshiping a false god and by worshiping Satan because the very first commandment is I am the Lord thy God Thou shalt not have any Gods above me he has got to be absolutely the number one thing in our lives he doesn't share his glory he doesn't share his position he doesn't share his truth he's sovereign he's the creator of Heaven and Earth he is he's the all in all the I am and everything will return back to him and anything that's not a part of him will not remain so Satan knows his time short so he's trying to manifest all his glory as quick as he can I like what the prophet of God said people are buying tickets to be able to travel in space and and spend money to go up and maybe go to the moon the prophet of God said I want to go so far past the moon hey I want to go so far beyond that don't you want to go in back to Eternity from where you came so with that understanding this morning we spent a few weeks reading I hope you went through the book yourselves as we read it we found out that the word of God has identified the God of this evil age and he also preached a parallel sermon called Satan's Eden where this world is under a complete different set of laws because of sin the law of sin and death the world Reigns but now we we're looking for something greater is if we can identify the God of this evil age we also want to identify the true God of the True Believer we want to be able to identify him we want to be able to know him so in doing so this morning we are going to go down that path and I was this sermon and message came to me in my heart the other day uh from the brother's breakfast and I encourage you Brethren when when we have the breakfasts to come out and if we won't fit in that back room we'll move these pews and chairs and we'll set up in here or eventually we'll find a place but come out but I was so moved the other day at the breakfast and I was particularly moved by a brother Tim Seiler what he expressed to the brothers and I I saw it sitting there in the word and it it it touched my heart and what the brother said and so I this morning we're going to play 12 minutes of the message and I thought this was such a beautiful title title the message messenger gave it Christ is identified the same in all ages so he's identified the same in all ages so it's important that we understand how that he is going to identify himself and what is the biggest issue today you hear about identity theft the world cannot help but testify to the gospel what we have going on today is spiritual identity theft trying to steal the identity of the True Believer and to try to give them a false identification but we want to find out by the word of God what the true identification of God is and what the believer identifies so if you're part of him then what he is you are so you have to have the same identity in God's word old man's come up with all kinds of the different identities and anointings signs everything but remember God is identified by who he is and what he is and he is the word so in our in our uh lesson this morning we'll let the the scriptures that are being read be the scriptures that that we read so let us stand together now brother Mike if they've given you that and we're going to turn to paragraph 46. in the message Christ is identified the same in all generations 4 15 64. 4 15 64. and I know some of you might have devices I don't like that word device I think d means the so it's the vice but anyway if you have those um you're welcome to turn to it to read along we'll have it on the board to read along if you have the message in Spanish I don't know if the paragraph parallel closely but you can look it in Spanish or French or whatever language you have and uh follow along till when we stop so we're going to listen to this and I want to read the very first thing now listen closely as we read this precious word listen closely let's listen closely this morning just for a little bit and see if we can find something in these next 12 minutes that really can mean something to us I believe it's there don't you you get what you're looking for amen look to God's word it'll feed you this morning thank you brother Mike go ahead please Hebrews 1 and then Hebrews 13 and we give it the fifth verse and read the eighth inclusive God who is sundry times and divers manners speak in times past and to the fathers by the prophets has in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he has appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world who being in the brightness of his glory in the end expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his promise when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right hand of the Majesty on high now Hebrews 13 5. let your conversations be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may fully say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do and remember them which have rule over you who has spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith followeth considering the end of their conversations Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever let us bow our heads for prayer while we have our heads bowed and our hearts also is there a request and you would like to be remembered that you would like to say it so much to God while this meeting is going on God I have a great need Remember Me Lord remember me I'm here for a need Lord our heavenly father we are approaching thee and that all-sufficient name of the Lord Jesus knowing this that he said if you ask the father anything in my name it'll be granted and we're so happy to know that Lord that we had this assurance that when we asked anything in his name has been heard of God and we pray father tonight my request that both my hands up I I ask you heavenly father to answer each one of these requests there's no doubt there's people there that their loved ones are unsaved and they have sickness and and maybe domestic troubles financial troubles and all gods the old world is certainly sick all over and we were looking for your coming Lord where I'll be a great A Thousand Years Millennium and we're we're the righteous Will Rule and reign with Christ we're looking for that hour we're trying to live like that that this is the time that we're seeing the last generation upon the Earth and we're waiting for his coming we pray father that you'll save every soul that's savable in this country while this meeting's going on granted father then when the meeting's over if we miss him May there come a Revival throughout all the churches and hurry and Lord come we see the earthquakes again of breaking up the Earth and diverse places and man's heart failing fear perplexing and distressed and Nations and we're just at the end time we think of the Great Earthquake the other day and never was one like it only 1900 years ago on another good Friday when Jesus had been rejected by the world the Earth shook all over God is rejected again the Earthship the other day in hills and mountains fell in cities collapsed and water dashed in the air and the whole world what would it be when you return Lord no wonder they cry to the rocks in the mountains let us be ready for that great going home time father Grant every request for we ask that in Jesus name amen and to be seated especially I want you to listen hear the time in and be just as reverent as possible especially while we're speaking because if you don't get the words what we have to place in each night then you come to the platform not knowing what you're coming for you must understand you must come with an understanding and that's what Christ wants us to come and if you have to have faith in what you're doing and if you don't you're just going time in a haphazard I hope so it'll never happen it can happen see you can't have faith if you're going like that you must thoroughly know what you're doing and know what's going to happen yes then then you you're positive then that it's going to happen now remember don't forget our theme is and our text that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now my text subject for tonight is Christ is identified the same in all generations now the Bible said he sustained yesterday today and forever and we want to know how he could be I would recognize him if he's here just as he was any other time and we'd like to know how he is recognized Among Us because so many people have so many different ideas about him see each one as an individual try to draw up our idea about Christ what he was what he looks like and and how the psychologist has painted the picture like Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 and and salmon and different ones but see we don't really look like that so we can never understand or what do you look like and uh by just a painting of some pictures therefore somebody would come on the platform or among us and have scars in his hands and nail prints and Thorn Prince on his forehead and fleeting I see that that wouldn't be Christ because when he comes ever I shall see him and every knee shall bow and that body Returns the Earth again see but what why could he be the same yesterday today and forever then he would have to learn now what what he is a bias uh say maybe the Lutheran people here what's your conception of him well they'd say we we have him at our church or I don't doubt that but he's this and then maybe turn over to the Baptist people and then they'd have a little different idea and I turned to different kinds of the Full Gospel people like the Assemblies of God the FourSquare the Pentecostal United and the the different uh branches of it each one might have a different idea about it each individual in there might differ but we've got to have something if we can come to some conclusion or we won't know to where where we're going I think the thing that would settle that would be the word of God regardless of our Queen needs in our thoughts the word of God are ought to settlement so therefore some of them claimed that he was a to some people he was just simply a great organizer he organized a body of 12 Apostles he was a great organizer as far as we know he ever organized nothing he never did a thing like that he was just he was the manifestation of God is God in Christ reconciling the world to himself he was expressing what the father was in himself he he said I do always that which pleases the father and I and the father one the father dwells in me when you see me you've seen the father in other words Express God the spirit so much anyway he and the father it wasn't a robbery for him to be the same person now we find in your some think he was a philosopher he was a philosopher there's no doubt about that but he was more than a philosopher some of them thought him to be a prophet he was a prophet true the Bible said he was but he was more than a prophet some of them said he was a teacher never a man taught like this he was a teacher but he was still more than a teacher see some of them say he was a good man but he was more than a good man he was a good man but he was more than a good man and when it's all summed down he was gone so even there was nothing less or nothing more it could be nothing more forced but he was he was God manifested In the Flesh and believed on in the world and Seed up in the glory and set at the right hand of the father now if we find out to get the real expression of him we John in the first chapter of John he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now in the beginning that's where time started when eternity broke down into time now after a while time comes back into eternity of course time is eternity too but time is a lot of space and that's the way the only thing we know is inches and yards and miles and figures and so forth but that's nothing to God you don't have no time he is always he's eternal and he's the only source of eternal life there is is in God our Father he's Eternal himself now therefore if we have eternal life we have part of God in us and God in us if he isn't then that's the only way you can have eternal life it isn't something that was manufactured and then given to you by some Creed or you lived into it you uh grew into a better man or a better woman it's God himself in you just like you're part of your father you're on Earth you're part of your heavenly father and what you are you're the attribute of his thoughts of you before the foundation of the world you're expressed he had to breed it in and everything to get what you are to make you what you are and when we pleaded then this year so many people ride life's Road looking through a rear view mirror especially I don't mean says to hurt Phoenix but many of our women there always went past about 30 years old they want to go back and and be a young girl again and get 50 they still want the same thing not only that but the man too but anybody who looks through a rear view mirror is going to wreck up somewhere you can't drive the road through looking through the rear view mirror but I believe watch Paul said forgetting those things that are in the past I've pressed towards the mark of the eye calling in Christ see don't look what you were look what you're going to be I I was remarrying an old couple one time they're taking their vows over there's 83 and 84 years old a piece they'd give them the full down and I I felt crazy just a young fellow as I was then trying to my old man had been married about 60 years him and his wife and just taking the bow and they were just as much in love as they ever was and he had a long beard and I said to him I said to her I said what do you think about it well I asked him first I said what do you think about why your wire long beard he said I think an old man my age should have a wrong beard I said to her what do you think about it and she said well she said anything John does it just fine so and um and I said well it's quite a difference he sent you a murderer said you know the Lord's been good so Jesus as pretty as she ever was said you know as she gets older my sight gets dimmer so that was that was really sweet I hope my wife thinks the same thing and I feel we all feel that way about it so but then they found lies they found how to live it you see there it is what we say we'd all like to go back I don't know if you realize how much was in there well let's just look a little bit this morning and uh and see uh if we can glean from these great words that were spoken to us and and find our ourselves this morning and he told us to listen closely and be reverent as possible and I think that's important in any time you want to hear from God that you've got to listen close you got to hear them and you've got to be reverent and and look past uh the the carnal things around us that are here uh to distract us and really in our hearts seek out to the word of God and and I believe that and I believe this with all my heart and I know I've shared it with you but for you to better understand me I believe that a prophets made a profit that that there's no way for a man to groom himself to be a prophet because there's uh no fact like he said eternal life we just read it is not something that you can grow into or something you can achieve by being a better man or a better person if you had eternal life you've always had eternal life if if you are a part of God you have to be a part of God you understand that you can't all of a sudden become part of God because now you've increased what God is do you understand so if you have eternal life you always had eternal life he knew whom he was and we we people say well I I received eternal life what you really got was the Revelation that there was eternal life in you that you found something that you identified with you heard a deep calling to a deep but you couldn't call for that deep unless there was something in there calling for it so the eternal life that was in you was calling for identification you didn't know it as life when you were growing up you knew it as conviction you knew it as a feeling there was something inside you that caused a conviction but later on through hearing the gospel and the preaching of God's word you come to know it was him amen you begin to know it was him and you began to know him in the flesh you knew him by conviction you knew him by sin you knew him by that and then as you grew you begin to know him as spirit Spirit life when you received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and and you became one with that word so we found out it's not something it's something that we've always had to have to be a part of him so when you understand it that way oh I didn't get eternal life in other words I didn't have it now I've got it well God couldn't do that you understand you have to be you'd have to have that Eternal if it was eternal life it had to be him in him in the beginning and therefore that's why we understand it to say we if you were a part of God you were always part of God and those that you all of a sudden didn't show up and say here I am God and God says oh I'm going to give you part of me no you had to be there in the beginning you for all he foreknew he did predestinate and then Justified and glorified and sanctified so we we we have that principle down going forward so what we were talking about this morning is how do we identify him how do we know without being deceived that he's Among Us when you have the God of this evil age presenting himself as God and he has a church he has a bride very religious now you know I didn't make that up right hey you you heard it and and I hope that in your life that if you spend a few hours here on Sunday that you would learn how to enter into the ministry and enter enter into what's being said and why the tapes are being preached and it's just not some obligation you know for some part of your religious cycle but that you would be able to identify God in the midst Among Us by his word and so let's see how he began to approach this and I I don't mind if you put up the paragraphs as we go this is paragraph uh 56 he said the Bible said he was the same yesterday today and forever now that's become way too common of a phrase to us I think it's something that we ought to deeply meditate on and that we all that we should think deeply on and I love how our messenger approaches it he says he says forever and we want to know how he could be that's a question in itself we want to know how could he be the same yesterday today and forever another is quick when a person in the Old Testament was moved upon by the spirit of God in sun-dried times and by diverse manners the spirit of God spoke to our fathers how could what God was speaking to them and what their experiences be and what they said be exactly what Jesus was because now he speaks to us through his son who was the word of God that's a great question how could he be and we find that as he spoke to us here we find that in John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God it was the same God all the way through it never changed it wasn't different he he wasn't somebody else it wasn't three different moves of God it wasn't three different persons of God it wasn't a trinity God the Father one person God the son another person God the holy spirit this person and and one day it's God one day it's the spirit one day it's the word you know people do that right today they have the Bible they have the message and they have the spirit and when they want the spirit they follow the spirit the spirit led me to do this I was led to the spirit the spirit you know a sister will get anointed in the spirit told me to preach the spirit told me that this or the spirit moved on me and I did this it don't line up with the word Paul said if you speak in tongues he said let there be an interpreter other words remain silent in the church oh but the spirit moved it's the spirit the spirit see they got a separate person in the spirit and then they'll say well brother Branham said brother Branham said brother bam said heck and they'll they'll they'll they'll put their own twist on it and it's fine and they'll say what brother Bram said this is what the Mets he said and not regard what the scripture says or not record what the spirit says and then somebody else will take the Bible they said well the Bible says they look that they don't regard the messenger and they don't regard the spirit and they cut a built-in Trinity hear me we got a trinity in this message we got Trinity thinking Trinity ideas but watch how our messenger unfolds it to us these aren't three different things they're exactly the same thing every single one of them is completely in harmony because it comes from the same Source the same voice the same eternity there's not one difference between one and the other because these three are one you never understand the Bible you'll never understand who you are and you'll never know where you're going with Trinity thinking when you think you can be anointed by the spirit to lead you to do something contrary to the word of God you are deceived you're deceived if you come up with an idea out of your Bible that you don't think the messenger taught you are deceived or if you think you can take your Bible improve whether the message is the word of God or not you're fooling yourself God's church is built on one thing and one thing only and that's divine revelation it's God revealing to you just showing you that this is the word of God this is the word of God and the spirit is the word of God and they're the same person then you can move forward he says we've got to understand that let's see why he's going to tell us why we're going to have to understand he says how could it be how we would recognize and how we'd recognize him so how could he be and how could we recognize him so how are we going to recognize him people want to know where he is they want to know if he's moving he wanted to know if he's amongst us that that's what people come to me all the time that get someplace where's a lot of excitement going on and they they come back and they question me well I'm here to answer it this morning I don't care about their words Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words but I came to you with the power and the demonstration of the Holy Spirit every single Joyride that a person goes on you go on it it scares you you've got your spine you know you're on the Cliffhanger or the Rocket Ride or whatever when you get back on the ground and you come to this your senses you're right back on the ground right in the same condition you were in before you took a big ride now you might get addicted to that right I've seen kids come off that thing and run right back around and get on it again run right back and get it on there I'm looking at it I've got to go down to the restroom down over here and hit my stomach back in the shape and I'm not even on it but they got to have that high they got to have that up let me say something the message you're told he says never become so spiritual you're of no earthly value all right now let's phone because we want to identify them we spent two weeks three weeks identifying this devil around us do you understand so my question is if we can see the devil how can we see God that's what I want to know how do I know that God is in the midst of this body of believers not necessarily this building but I want to be able to identify God in the midst of this body of Believers and to be able to say this is God God is here God is moving and it's him now we just heard him say a lot of people have an idea a lot of them have an identity a lot of people have something that they conclude that is he said if I would go to a church they would say God's in our church and he said you could even go down through all the different branches and there be something so this is what he says in this same paragraph he goes on to say how do we recognize him and if he's here just the same was in any other time so how do we recognize him if he's here just the same if he was in every other time then like to know how he is recognized among us don't do no good if we can recognize him down the street you know what happens every time somebody comes up with a new flavor it gets a following you know if somebody came up with purple pumpkin ice cream there would be a purple pumpkin ice cream following and people flock to it I don't want to flock to this I don't want to flock to that because my sheep know my voice and another they won't follow so it's important to you as an individual that you can identify him amongst your fellowship and him in your life so this is what he goes on to say he said he talks about he said you can't know him by a painting well we have the Huffman's head of Christ here because we understood that the messenger told us when he saw him in the field I believe it was he said standing there he said when he turned around there was a face like no face that I had ever seen there was love like no love I've ever experienced it was like his eyes were they could just look through you we don't like that part [Music] um no sir we like people looking at the outside the Lord looked past my flesh you're not going to judge me by my flesh anyway look into my heart you know you take the Heart of Stone and put in a heart of Flesh Change My Heart Lord change my thinking so we we find out he said you can't know him by that and everybody's got a different idea of what he is he said you can't know him by a picture or you can't you he says or different ones you can't know him by different understandings you've got to be able to identify him yourself amen you surely don't want to end up with my idea of something aren't you glad God give us an absolute so we can get rid of our ideas I can't convey to you my revelation I can I can only preach to you my revelation you understand that I would love to be able to preach to you brother Brandon's revelation I don't have brother brahm's revelation I have the Revelation that God gave me and I hope in Fellowship it matches up with the revelation God gave you but don't take it second hand that's the problem with the church is secondhand Revelation they never pray through they never go listen that's why I believe in listening to the tapes not only can your personal life because God deals with the Earth the church the world the church and the individual the same way so God did he sent a message to the Earth he sent a message to the church and he sent a message to the individual and the message is the source of everything we teach everything we stand for it's the original the spoken word is the Original Seed what was spoke in the beginning in a way of a true Prophet is to be to be lip to ear with God that he can speak to you God's thoughts many times those thoughts are in the form of Prophecy sometimes those thoughts are in the way of Correction sometimes those thoughts are going back to where you were how can God go back because he was there when it happened oh Hallelujah I remember the prophet of God one time he says I can just see Lazarus I can just see Jesus coming out of the mountains and he's hungry I've been to where they said those mountains are and if you travel North in a little West you come into Nazareth they have a spot that's what they call it you point way up in those mountains in Israel overlooking Jordan and they say that's the mount Temptation up there that's where Jesus and Satan had it out he says I'm going to go down and he says I can just see Jesus coming out and going down and picking up his friend Lazarus and them going down to the river where John was and been down to the spot where they said John was and I thought my wouldn't it be something just to be able to see that unfold just the way it was you know how you do that because you're a part of Eternity I hope that drops in that's what makes something divine that's what makes something Supernatural because it's part of Eternity so he says you gotta you've got to recognize it he said he says so if he shows up with nail scars hands you're not going to buy that so this is what he says let's let this settle in just a moment this morning I'll move quickly he says but what why could he be the same yesterday today and forever see we have to learn now what he is what he is I would love to go back and spend some time how he described what time is it's just a little space in eternity time is part of Eternity it's just a space we're just in a space don't let this space defeat you this is the Captivity of Satan is to be caught in this space of time that's what he doesn't want you to break free from is the effect of time The Changing Times trying to keep up with time he wants you to get caught up in the importance of this piddly 70 80 years that God might give you here and trade that for eternity what if the prophet the man if he gaineth the whole world and loses his soul get your great big ribberings doctor LPG ABC David McGarry here sir would you please stand up I have come into your presence that's touch and such I I like old brother Jess Trammell you didn't know brother Jess but brother just trim will use something else he's gone on to be with the Lord but I remember a bunch of brothers were talking one day and they said and they got talking about some somebody you know oh I don't know it was Babe Ruth or somebody they got mommy he said he said I don't know no Babe Ruth he never helped me and no Revival I like that I don't know these things I don't want to be like you know that's a sin in the Bible immunization to imitate to emulate something to look at a hair do and say ooh that looked good on me well I know Herod looked good on me but I lost the Strand I ain't lost to one that's right don't get caught up don't get caught up in this space of time that's what he's trying to get us back to out of this time back to Eternity Hallelujah don't let go let your sickness steal it from you don't let your finances your troubles to mess it don't let nothing steal eternity from you tune in you've been given the greatest resource that any Generations ever had the returning of Jesus Christ failed in flesh doing the same Works he did when he was on Earth 2 000 years ago and we can't recognize it because the messenger says there's too many fingers pointing elsewhere I'm learning to take the criticism like he plays tapes because he can't preach okay fine preaching ain't worth a cent if it don't have no word in it the very source of all truth to this generation and they won't even play their his voice and their Church go there if you want you'll starve to death and not know it thinking you have need of nothing and not knowing thinking you're prospering thinking you're rich in the spirit and not knowing it I'll say it well it can take me off YouTube or not you will not make it without the guide of this message through this dark hour that we're in and as a man I do not have the ability nor do I want the responsibility somebody already took that for me he said I'll have to give account for every word we had another man that was in that same Spirit he said be followers of me as I am of Christ so we got to know what he is we understand that right so we're moving to something quickly here and I don't mean to defend myself but you can't have a you can't have your own conception and everybody's trying to give us today some sort of conception and identification of how do we identify him in our midst now if it's going to be him it has to be a word identification not an anointing identification not a movement identification not a sensation identification you can't go somewhere and have chills run up and down your spine and say that's God in fact you can't even say that the storm clouds above you mean God's against you or the sunshine above you means God's for you you find your identity in one thing and that's the promise that God gave you in your work every promise in this book is mine every chapter every verse every life every promise in this book is mine every chapter every verse every line everything the Spirit came the spirit never came to speak of itself but to bring us in remembrance of all things that he said oh that's the word are you with me I don't want to be mad at the Devil and make you think I'm mad at you we love this word but understand now we're just trying to build just in this few little sections that we went through I'm sure every single one of you gleaned this out of this paragraphs we just read as you were sitting there I know you saw all this so just bear with me I'm a little slower than most of you so he said he said you have all he said I've talked to all kinds of different Foursquare gospel people all kinds of people each individual there's many different but he says listen to this we've got to have something that we can come to some conclusion or we know won't know to where were going you know the trouble of most of these movements are they don't know where they're going yeah yeah they don't know where they're going to end up they don't know what the next thing on the agenda is they won't they won't know what's going to happen the next service I can tell you what's going to happen the next service the word of God's going to be preached what William Branham taught is going to be fed to us so we can get a personal revelation for ourselves oh no you say what's the next Jersey it's going to be exactly what God's will will be you can't say that well then if I can't say that then I can't say the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord have confidence in them if God be for you who can be against you he's not against you he's not trying you God doesn't tempt any man he defeated the tempter he set you free if God before you who can be against you I surely don't want God against me that's a losing battle he finally told Paul Paul it's hard to kick against the prick son you're a church days messenger persecuting the church ain't gonna work so what did he do he went back on the back side of the desert and he searched the scriptures concerning the Messiah and he saw Jesus Christ standing in the word the same yesterday today and forever fulfilling every prophecy that was spoken of him he said when he did that he could come out there and write the book of Hebrews explaining who this Melchizedek was oh this message is so wonderful so wonderful so let's just read we're just reading here so we don't know where we're going and I think the thing that would settle that would be the word of God regardless of our Creeds and our thoughts the word of God ought to settle it then I'm just gonna so many little things you go back to listen to it but I want to pick up on something that that stood out so very much to me he said if we don't get this absolute down then we won't know where he's going right so we've been over this so many times so this is what we realize paragraph 63 he was the manifestation of God that's what he was so he was everything the word said he would be is that correct it was God in Christ reconciling the world to himself he was expressing what the father was so everything that Jesus did he was expression of what the father was right so we we we see that and we we see that he said and we knew that because he said these simple things I I always do that which pleases the father he said I do nothing unless the father has showed me he said to Philip he who hath seen me have seen God so if we know what his identity was what was Jesus identity one he did only the will of the father and what the father showed him therefore in doing that he was one with the word what identified him if he was the prophecy that was prophesied of him coming to pass he was that that uh enmity between her seed and satency he woke the heel that was to be bruised there's what is it 660 some prophecies I forget the number somebody's figured it out concerning him and what he fulfilled he said I didn't come to do away with the law I've come to fulfill it every jot every Tittle every drop his identity was not his signs and wonders that was his Vindication his identity was the Fulfillment of the word that was spoken of him because he could have done all those signs and wonders but if he didn't identify and fulfill that word he wasn't what the word spoke of oh hear me it Vindicated them right but he had to do those things because the word said he would do those things that he'd bind up the Brokenhearted that he'd heal this he would do that he'd set the captive free that was part of his identity that's why he said to him if you can't believe me for my word the best thing at least believe me for my signs and wonders because they testify of me but you can't separate them you can't take signs you can't take wonders you can't move to the spirit speaking a tongues prophecy and all those things and separate it from the word of God and end up with him oh May that set so deep if somebody's preaching the gospel without the message of this age they're preaching to you a historical gospel or a fantasy future there's one reality of the word of God in this generation and that's the message that God Vindicated and sent to this generation because God does nothing unless he first it looks delivers it and speaks it to his servant the prophet so the first way you can identify whether it's God or not did it come by the way that God provided if it don't come by the prophet it isn't God's way [Music] the church for Seven Ages has just been preaching what Paul brought they couldn't put it together so God had to send another Prophet to open the seals that that the Mysteries could reveal so we could finally understand who we are I'm getting too long man but I love I can't I love it I love it I love it my friend always says that to me all right so let's move on so we know about this eternally right but Paul says this now and this is where I want to end up this morning because we're talking about he's he laid something in for in US for us to identify now just to add some side like he's sitting talking to a group of people in Tampa Bay and he says you've got to know where you're going another is he's telling me you guys don't know where you're going okay he's saying you can't live looking back let's just stay here just first man let's read it paragraph paragraph 73. so we already know right by bro all of us know the seed's been bred in US any question with who you are that your name's on the land Book of Life that's not what we're trying to settle anymore what we're wanting to know is how can we identify if God is in our midst because if you can't identify him here you better run to some place that you think he is you would be better off and the body would be better off you would no need walking out of here every day saying criticizing that doesn't help nobody well because this Paul said forgetting those things that are in the past I press toward the mark of the higher calling in Christ Jesus see don't look at what you were look at what you're going to be now that's the trouble right there people trying to identify him by Looking Back they see what he has was in another age they look back to Pentecost and they say where are all the Miracles where are all the gifts where are all the signs this is this is what we used to be this is what we were we're looking back we got We've Got The Look Back how the spirit moved you asked they're looking back now you can't do that in your personal life because if you look past the blood you don't want to go into the sea of God's forgetfulness and try to find something that God don't even remember because if you go dig it out of there and you pick it up again to God he already forgive it and it don't exist and you're stuck with it in your mind am I too gone because if your crock pot's gonna boil over we got at least another 30 minutes save me some so they're looking back so we find out what happens to the church they come up to a certain place they don't know where they're going so if you don't know where you're going you go back to where you come from else you're just wandering around in circles looking this way looked in that way I know there's a big taste out there for these things you think I'd preach this way if I didn't know where I was standing you'd think I'm afraid of this message it's the power of God if the battle come down and I stood before an intellect and I stood before a big name or whatever it is you don't think I know what God's Gonna back he's going to back the voice of this messenger every time I'll just shrink down like this and I said I said what he said I said what he said you didn't shout no I didn't jump you didn't run around the church no I didn't run around the church you didn't have a prayer line where everybody fell out no we didn't have a prayer line where everybody fell out but I've seen prayer lines I've seen prayer lines where Jesus Christ himself was standing there and they walk up and he's there and he begins to talk to him and he says you feel something right now a real warm feeling all over you it's him there was a prayer line where somebody fell out how many of those were it was hat Oregon right a big old bully stood up there he fell out they were in the presence the most anointed presence that's been in this generation Way Beyond the personal anointing of an individual that was Emmanuel the crater of Heaven and Earth the one that could go back the one that could go forward the one that could stand there and say I take every spirit in this building under my control in the name of Jesus Christ look at that prayer line there's your example of a prayer line there's your example of the movement of the spirit you know what's happened we don't hold that in esteem anymore you see this picture here that's what man thinks that is the closest picture you'll ever see to Jesus Christ in your whole life that's the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel it's the same Pillar of Fire that John saw this ending up here it's the same Pillar of Fire that Jesus said when he left this Earth he went back into the logus of God and they won't even put it up in their Church they're too ashamed of it you're not gonna you're not gonna forget it I know the leader of this age all I can say the prophet of God said it was more than a teacher okay it's more than a man it was more than a prophet I hope you caught it so we're going to close up you ready for clothes but I haven't I haven't even showed you my sermon yet have I if you could walk out right now and be happy I'd walk out of here at the question mark what in the world were you talking about huh because I promised we could identify him that's a bold statement isn't it I'm on the line the prophet get on the line all the time he'd say you know I'm waiting for something and then you talk about Africa and he'd talk about this he'd talk on he talked he says you know I'm waiting for something but he had a promise right he said if you were sincere I'd be there and all of a sudden he'd say he's here he's here he's here this morning standing in his word because he said wherever two or three people are gathered together he'd be there the trouble is we don't know how to identify him because we don't know who he is and somebody's offering us other identifications Satan can interpret every gift of the spirit except the Fulfillment of the word this is oil a lot of people anoint with oil the oil don't heal you it's the faith in the word that heals you all right so let's let's get this beautiful thing down so we find out that they're looking back the reason they look back is because they don't know where they're going or they won't accept where God is taking them right how many can identify that spirit in the first Exodus where are you taking us we had we had oil and garlic and and in Egypt we'd have the task Masters but at least we have the spirit that's what people want today they want to be stuck with all the task masters of the world they want to be stuck in time as long as they can have what they had hear me they don't know where they're going so they're going back to Pentecost because as a seed matures the shut pulls away from it Pentecost was a carrier it carried the true pure word that went into the ground Pentecost was carrying Christ the anointed word all the way till that seed matured so as the as the message been been preached over the last 50 years that seed inside of that Chuck has been maturing it's been growing in stature it's been growing to the perfect Willow it's becoming subject to the message that it's been hearing been now in this final stage comes the ripening of the Sun the coming of the Capstone when it finally gets to that final maturity of that word seed they they all of a sudden manifest Pentecost they go into emotionalism and sensationalism and Leadership of the spirit they reject the peer leadership of the word of God they go back to their Trinity thinking the Bible's just the same the spirit moves the word of God they they don't look at any of them being an absolute this Bible and message are not two different things the Mysteries didn't come outside this book they were laying in this book it took the way that God does something I'll not do nothing I won't speak to the people no more I'll speak to my prophets it took the prophet to put this and this and let us know where this was pointing where it was taking it where he was going they don't know where we're going because they don't have the messengers in absolute no more they won't play as tapes they won't put the pillar of fire in their Church you say are those are are those requirements no they're not requirements you don't have to have it in there but you still have to believe every word he says I just don't know why anybody's ashamed of it um don't worry my sheep know my voice and another they don't follow you don't have to change the voice of The Voice to get the person to hear it that ego never changed its scream it scared the fire out of those chickens but he wasn't a chicken to begin with this message is the only way of Escape if you don't get in the ark you're going to drown it's the only place of safety so we're going to finish they don't know where they're going so they look back so and and that's what happened so the question is we he's identified by his word so Jesus was identified that God was in their presence and he was God by the word that he fulfilled that's the only way he's identified by the word that he's fulfilled now I want you to offend just 10 minutes with me right now open your Bibles to John 17. and this is the word of God telling us where we're going how do we know that God's in our midst how do we know he's Among Us because he's doing what he said he would do in our age right so we know that he identified himself now he wants to be identified in his church but he can't be identified in his church any other way that he was identified he was identified by fulfilling the word so if the bride is the bride who she claims to be she will have to have the same identification as her husband and people are trying to give you an identification of another age but let's go back you say can you take that from the Bible yes sir same is it the spirit same the spirit of God came to bring you into remembrance now let's listen very closely may I set the setting Jesus has just had communion with the Saints is that right now he's been betrayed and he's went to the garden to pray he knows what's lying ahead of him the burden was so great because it was the burdens of the sins of the world we're going to be upon him nobody else could pay it but him if he didn't do it mankind was lost he couldn't do it as God because then he couldn't have done it for us he wouldn't have been a Kinsmen Redeemer the pressure is so great on him the knowledge of what lies ahead of him because he knew the scriptures they'd pierce his side his nails he'd have a crown so much was the burden that he's sweating in blood now he's going to ask the father what he wants his ministry to accomplish John 17 is Jesus's testimony it's the testimony of his faith you've all heard perfect Faith right if he believed who he was why can't we believe who we are oh let's just read this together and then we'll close put yourself in the scriptures this is Jesus speaking these words spank Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee that that The Hours come glorify your son that thy son Also may glorify thee how many want to join in that father glorify me that thy son and daughter may also glorify thee as thou hath given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as doubt hath given him okay these this is this is where he's going this is how you identify him this is what he's accomplishing and this is eternal life that they might know the the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hath sent every single one has a that it's a purpose I'm going to Calvary that they might know you I'm going to Calvary that you might be glorified now in order for us to identify Christ in our midst we would have to identify the word that he spoke manifesting in flesh so this would be how you would know as we keep going I have glorified thee on the Earth and have finished the work which thou giveth me to do and now O Father glorify thou me with thy own self and with the glory which I had with thee before the world was who else taught that your name was in the Lamb's Book of Life here he is what you think brother Brandon preached a different message than Jesus did no he was the word this is what he came to the church the message wasn't against you it was for you it was to bring you out of Egypt he's preaching to us now same Jesus same son of man bailed in a different flesh saying father that they might have the glory that I had with thee in the beginning he's preaching to the church church that you might have the glory that you had him in the beginning that's how you know whether he's among you or not is whether he's fulfilling the word that's spoken of you not some Sensation from another age I glorified thee on Earth what verse am I on what six okay I have manifested thy name unto men which thou giveth me out of the world thine they were oh who came and told us if you ever had eternal life you always had thine they were you were his you were his here's our messenger in our day preaching John 17 to us because it's the identity of his ministry what he taught now the only way you're going to find out whether he's in the midst of the church or whether he's among us if the things we continue to read are coming to pass that simple call me a simpleton that just happens to be where God's hid that's read we're trying to rope thine they were and thou giveth them me and they have kept Thy word what did he give them who was he the word you gave them me the word and they kept that word you identify the church by its obedience to the word of God you identify him in your midst by obedience to the word of God if you love me you will keep my Commandments now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hath given me are of Thee oh that one's tough everything he gave us they recognize it in this day him standing here in this day everything he gave us was of him you go someplace and they don't agree everything that he was givenness is of him I don't care what they do not the identity he's not among you if he's among you every bit of the word that he givesness you know it's of him that's how you know he's amongst you how he's identifying himself in his church proves whether he's with them or not I'm trying to make this simple but am I am I clear let's keep reading and we're going to be closed here but it it's beautiful let's just keep going here he says for I have given unto them thy Words which thou giveth me they weren't his words they were Eternal words he didn't speak anything less the father showed him he only spoke what the father told him to speak can you see him standing in this age the first fruit preaching the word of God for I have given them The Words which thou giveth me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me Glory I saw him I believe that God sent him I received the words as they were spoken I believe they came from God everybody wants the faith restored that the disciples have they don't want the faith they want the works without the faith but that's what they did he's identifying his boots then father they believed you sent me they believed the words I said and the belief the words that I said were from you now do you believe that when he showed up veiled in a body of a messenger you believe it was the same word you believe it came from the father do you believe the father gave it to him oh now you're starting to get the foundation of whether he's amongst us or not don't let anybody take it from you let's go I pray for them I pray not for the world he didn't pray for everybody he knew everybody wouldn't be saved he knew it was only them that the father hath given him don't join yourself up to something that's not you how can two walk together unless they agree how can you serve two masters can you imagine me preaching at the Baptist church on Sunday and then coming here and preaching the message on another day and having two Messengers you would know where you were going you couldn't preach the Full Gospel you couldn't preach against things that's what happens in people's lives they get a mark on their life and they'll avoid the gospel that has anything to do with that Mark foreign delivered from cigarettes if you're delivered from cigarettes cigarettes don't bother you you don't have to avoid the crowd because somebody's smoking there and you you're going to go I gotta have some of that you don't sit there battling whether or not you're kind of puff if you've been delivered you've been delivered if you're still taking drugs you're not really don't want to preach against drugs if you're still doing things you don't want to preach against them if you're still a hot head you don't want to preach against being a hot head the word but you you know preach the word whether you're guilty of it or not it'll set you free so let's just read we're just getting started you can leave if you want you have my blessings I pray for them I don't pray for the world but for them which thou hath given me for they are Vine now I could almost jump up here so you understand this is you also because he said I also pray for them who believes on their word let's just keep following he says and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them how do you know he's amongst you is he being glorified in you and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou hath given me that they may be one as We Are One how do you know God's in our midst if we are becoming one as he is one are we becoming him are we becoming the word is there a transformation taking inside of you the power to transform it's not judged by any external thing you know that he's in our midst because he's fulfilling what that he promised we would be so we're not looking back we're reading this morning what he said we would be now is he doing that is he bringing us to what he would be if he's bringing us to what we're going to be then we know he's with us because that's what he does but they may be one as we are one well I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those thou hath given me I have kept none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition that the scriptures might be fulfilled he was the Fulfillment of scripture you are the Fulfillment of scripture and now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world what that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves it's wonderful that this joy that he had might be fulfilled in us do you say well I don't have that that's what you're going to be don't look back look at where he's taking you look at where you're going they don't know where they're going we know where we're going we're going to an invisible Union we're going to one we're going to where what He Is We Are we're going to the manifestation of the word he's taking us someplace it's where we're going it's not whether we arrived right as we understand that he's taking us to Perfection he's taking us to Oneness he's taking it so if he's taking us to the Fulfillment of the word then he's identified in our midst and Among Us amen that's how you identify whether he's among you or not is whether these things that he asked for are coming to pass let's just keep reading that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves that's a promise to me I have given them Thy word and Thy Word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not thou shouldest take them out of the world but thou shall keep them from the evil is God keeping you from the evil I have a battle with it it's a promise fight for it fight for the promises of God the battles in your mind take the weapon of the word you understand what I'm saying this morning church you don't measure it by any other thing but by the word of God is the word of God what he spoke that would be of a bride is he taking you there I say yes I say yes he's taking me to that perfect union he's taking me there are you there I don't care whether I'm there I'm not looking back to what I was I'm looking to what he promised I would be that there would be an invisible Union and as he was so are we in this world I believe it with all my heart that's how you tell if he's in our midst he keeps going they are not of the world even him as nighth not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth are you Sanctified by the spirit if it's the word are you Sanctified by the spirit without the word no way you're not everybody wants spirit but they don't want word but the word can't change the word is stuck with its identity because it's eternal the word is what always was and always will be he's bringing you back to Eternity don't be sidetracked then he goes on he says as thou hath sent me to the world even so I have also sent them into the world and for their sake I Sanctified myself for what that they also might be Sanctified through the truth that you might also be sanctified neither pray for our for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word Hallelujah every promise is right here for me that they may also be one that they all may be one all those everybody even those that believed on his word that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I envy that they also may be one in US that the world may believe that thou hath sent me every that is where you're going every that is where he's taking you every that is the work that he's doing in this day the seed had to go into the ground it had to come up now what he prayed for and what he died for is now starting to manifest in a bride and she's becoming the word She's Not Looking Back she's looking to what that he said he would accomplish and they know that God's in their midst because the truth is taking them there I believe this is where the message is taking us they may be one in us that the world may know and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as We Are One you know God's in your midst if you're becoming one as he is one if you are becoming one and Legend how do we know God's in our midst how do we identify him because he's doing what he said he would do Paul even said it I mean yeah he said leaving again those things of laying on of hands of speaking in tongues and the which we will do if God so perfect but let us move on to perfection be ye perfect as he is perfect we're the word Satan's whole program is to discredit the word but we're promised in his word so I know that God is in by midst that he's among us if he's doing what he said he would do if he's bringing people into that Union if he's giving Joy if he's doing these things which we read all these that's then I know he's there I don't judge it by anything other than the what the word you say well what happens if I'm missing one ask and it shall be given seek in you shall find knock and it shall be open invite me in and I'll come sup with you and I will give you all these Vats because that's the evening meal that they may be one even as We Are One i in them and vowed in me I am them thou in me that they may be made that that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hath sent me and hath loved them as thou hath loved me is he accomplishing that I say yes I say yes this is what I see in you this is what I see in the body loving one another becoming one with the word becoming one together I see him in you I hear Spirit In You I see a real Church that's interested in the real word that wants him to identify them himself in them but that's how I know God in his midst not a wind blowing through now and then not a response to music not a response to a style of preaching but my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow don't condemn yourself because of the battle of your flesh you have a promise of Deliverance you have a promise of Victory take that word and take that word and say father let this word live in me I take your word it's my promise I will be free from this slave I'll be free from the lust of the flesh I'll be free from the pride of life I'll be free from the lust of the eye amen the word of God came to set us free the truth sets us free give me my identity back quit robbing my identity my identity is I'm one with the word and the word lives in me and as he is so am I in this world that's what we're about I don't care if there's if you want to run praise God run jump don't jump no higher than you're living but until these that's are happening this is the identity of God moving in our midst I would love to tell you something else but I can't I'm imprisoned to this message I tried to disprove it when I first heard it every way in the book every way you could think of I tried to disprove him I'd listen for a little bit and it'd just tear me to pieces and I'd fight it and I'd fight it and I'd fight it it didn't say no it can't be because I thought I knew God real well until I heard good morning friends and I heard him thought to be and I knew I didn't know God the way he knew God and I thought oh my am I lost because I heard Peyton ISM versus Christianity and I thought I'm a pagan this man said I'm a pagan but I knew he knew what he was talking about it was a terrible battle and I wondered if I'm lost I wonder if I was going to hell and then I heard when love projects and I thought oh God this is just your love for me because I was wrong I was going the wrong way I had wrong doctrines I had wrong thinking I had the wrong approach you say do you have it right now no I'm not perfect but I know I'm moving to Perfection because it's the promise of his word and that's where the word is taking that's where we're going we're not going back to Pentecost he didn't say back to Pentecost he said back to the word Back to Eden don't let somebody Sidetrack you and say Lo he is here and though he's there oh he's in this movement he's in that movement I remember somebody saying where are all the Miracles where are all the Miracles where are all the gifts that's all where are all the Miracles where are all the gifts where's all the excitement where's all the worship it better be in your heart because if you're just getting into a building you might as well go to a bar that's what they do they play music and they all get in the spirit that's not what it is it's you know him not by a picture but you know him by what he's changing you into you know him by where he's taking him you know him because you know he's perfecting you he's perfecting your heart he's perfecting your mind he's molding you into an image of himself you know he where he's taking you because he's taking you into the Fulfillment and the protection of the word you know he's amongst you when he's doing what he said he would do and we'll finish father I will that they also whom thou hath given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou have given me for thou loveth me before the foundation of the world o righteous father the world hath not known me but I have known thee and these have known that thou have sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will to glare it that the love wherein thou have loved me may be in them and I in them that's what I want to be identified by amen let's grow in that love let's grow in that image let's grow in that obedience every one of you has an opportunity to sit down and listen to this voice and let God take you into the perfect image of his son God bless you I'm sorry I've kept you brother Billy [Applause]
