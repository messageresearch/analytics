our lives to be drawn closer to thee lord god because as long as we remain on this earth there's a weight there's a gravity that holds us down but father may we be set free this morning in your spirit to worship your lord in spirit and in truth let him that have an ear hear what the spirit was saying to the church in this day lord lord we committed all to you lord god and pray that you would have your way lord in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray this morning amen amen amen welcome to the house of the lord we're gonna invite brother mike to come and do all strawberries this morning i want to welcome all the visitors and you can turn around and shake the hand of somebody and tell them god bless you welcome to the house of the lord amen good morning a little bit of a uh thin crowd this morning it must be summer vacation i know that we've got some meetings going on in amarillo i know we got of course we want to remember the mcgeary's as they are enjoying a significant event in their uh mother their grandmother's life so just pray that the lord will be with each and give them safety on their way home and on their journeys we want to turn to psalm 119 this morning we're going to go ahead and pick up starting in verse 105 and you know as i was reading that there was a statement that david made which sort of caught my attention at least it's in verse 11. it says this thy testimonies have i taken as in heritage forever for they are the rejoicing of my heart thy testimonies thy word have i taken as in heritage forever i thought that was an interesting choice of words that david used you know and it struck me the approach that he took a heritage inheritance is something that's typically given handed down and yet david says that he's taken taken the word his testimonies as and heritage you know webster defines heritage as a property that descends from an heir something transmitted by or acquired from a predecessor something possessed as a result of one's natural situation or birth it's an inheritance something passed down something given the person that's receiving it you know typically has to do nothing to receive it it's just because of who they are they receive it and yet david says i have taken it as an heritage there were two things that caught my attention with that first of all he's describing his inheritance his heritage as the word and second he's taking it that way taking the word as his inheritance you know when the lord told the children of israel back in exodus 6 8 about this land that he was giving them as an heritage as a possession he said i will bring you in unto the land concerning that which i swear to give it and i will give it you for inheritage i am the lord that land wasn't heritage it was it was an inheritance a defined position a very specific possession but they still had to take it as an inheritance the entire book of joshua describes them taking their inheritance something that belonged to them all the way since genesis 12 7 when the lord had promised it to abraham but it wasn't until they looked at that as their inheritance as their possession that they were able to take it even though it was always theirs even though the word was always true it wasn't until they actually began to receive it to take it as something that belonged to them were they able to receive it you know david said in verse 11 here thy testimonies thy word have i taken as in heritage you know it's one thing to believe the word is true but it's quite another to say it's mine it's my possession it's my inheritance i have a right to it isaiah 54 17 is a familiar scripture to all of us it says that no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper in every tongue that shall rise against the unjudgment thou shalt condemn we all believe that that's a wonderful verse but very rarely do you hear someone finish the verse it says that this is the heritage of the servants of the lord that's the important part not only is it a promise but it's your possession see the thing is is there's a difference between taking something that's just offered a gift and something that is yours to begin with there's an empowerment there's a boldness there's no there's no you know reluctance to take it at all oh that's mine as opposed to is that for me really right there's a difference somebody gives you a gift it's like you shouldn't have for me real i'm not worthy of that but if it's yours to begin with oh there it is you see the difference take it as and heritage you know that's why it is you know the thing is when it's your thing your possession no matter what evidence is presented no matter what argument is put before you no matter what the voices say you cannot be removed from the fact but that's mine no more than they can with your house that's my house doesn't matter what the evidence says doesn't matter what the voices say that's mine see that's why it is whenever the devil comes against someone the first thing he tries to do is tell you well the word is true but that's not for you separate you from your inheritance because the moment you realize that that's yours no voice can shake you from the fact but that's mine amen taking thy testimonies as in heritage look at the approach that david took it struck me as you know even the news you've got this you've got this stunning development going on in in the ukraine where you have this tiny nation that's able to withstand one of the largest militaries in the world why because they know their possession they're giving everything for it and they're able to overcome an enemy that would seek to dispossess them from what they know is theirs taking the word as an heritage you know the thing is is there's nothing you can do to deserve it there's nothing you can do to you know become qualified for it it's already yours but do you take it as in heritage or are you naming something else as your inheritance you know my inheritance is this worldly thing or this whatever the case may be it's the word but you got to take it as such you've got to receive it as such that's mine oh there it is right you know the scriptures are full of examples of the inheritance that we have ephesians 1 is a great place to start it says in verse 11 in whom christ the word we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that whole chapter that whole book is about the inheritance that's already yours you know even brother branham compared the book of ephesians to the book of joshua which was the book where someone took the inheritance that was already theirs first peter 1 3 and 4 talks about how he has begotten us again to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you what what does not pass away what does not fade away the word heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away you know you can't make yourself worthy of it it's already your possession no more than you can make yourself worthy of the home that you have or the car that you have or whatever's in your pocket and it just was i was struck by the approach that david took to thy testimonies the word i have taken thy testimonies as in heritage oh it's mine there it is and i would encourage you this morning is you know we read this and you know certainly as we hear the word this morning to approach it from the perspective if i'm learning about the inheritance that's already mine tell me more it's mine you know use it don't let anybody tell you otherwise no matter what the evidence says take the word as your inheritance let's read that portion this morning we'll just read those few verses starting in 105 thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path i have sworn and i will perform it that i will keep thy righteous judgments i am afflicted very much quicken me o lord according unto thy word except i beseech thee the freewill offerings of my mouth o lord and teach me thy judgments my soul is continually in my hand yet do i not forget thy law the wicked have laid a snare for me yet i aired not from thy precepts thy testimonies have i taken as an heritage forever for they are the rejoicing of my heart i have inclined mine to perform thy statutes always even unto the end hey man god bless you you may have your seats let's sing that song this morning we're we're marching to zion amen come we that love the lord and let our joys be known joining us [Music] around

card and then she said she couldn't clear me because my blood pressure was high so i was like now you got to check it again because like you had to have made a mistake and then i started thinking to myself like the devil put thoughts in your head like oh your dad had high blood pressure so maybe like you know it could be like hereditary or whatever and then it could be passed on but that's just the devil trying to steal my draw honestly and then she says you'll check again in five minutes and then like i was waiting in the room and i said a short prayer and then i asked i told god i said i

first doctor that i checked i said i had the heart murmur she came and checked it and then she was like she was shocked too because like she heard it at first she said it was loud but like she didn't hear it anymore so she caught a third doctor in and like there was three of them just putting stuff on my chest and like you know i was like i mean i didn't think it was that serious but all right and then what's the card and then what's because she like she cleared me and she was like yeah you're good like i guess we just made a mistake or whatever and i was like i mean yeah i didn't make a

today amen certainly thankful and all those that are out we want to remember them and amen let's open our bibles in revelation chapter 5. i trust that you're excited to be gathered in the house of god no better place to be than to be here let's start from verse 1. revelation chapter 5 and verse 1 it says and i saw in the right hand of him i sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals it says and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seal thereof and no man in heaven no man on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book needed to look there there on and i wept much it says because a man but no man was found worthy to open and and to read to read the book needed to look thereon it says and one of the elders said unto me whip not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals the seven seals thereof and i be held and low in the midst of the throne and in and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood the lamb as as it has been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which was seven spirit of god sent forth unto the earth and he came and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four the fourth and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them of them harps and golden vials full of orders of it says odors which were the prayers of the saints and they sang a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof thou it says for thou has was slain and has redeemed us back to god i had redeemed us to god by the blood to out of every kindred every tongue every people and every nation it says and now is made unto unto our god kings and thou has made us unto our god kings and priests that we shall reign on the earth and i beheld and i heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the numbers of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and ten thousand of ten thousands it says and thousands of thousands it says saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain that was slain i was slain to receive power and reaches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which we which were in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i say blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that seated upon the throne and unto and unto the lamb forever and ever and the full beast said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth forever and ever amen let's just bow our heads our gracious father we're so thankful to be gathered in your presence we pray that you bless your work to us you bless your word to us this morning as we look to you we ask that you may just speak to us lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen man god bless you have your seats amen i every believers of this message that verse of the scripture means so much to us because it tells us of what is it that we have been called to and just go over again it says and the elder said unto him whip not behold the lion of the tribe of judah and the root of david has prevailed to open the book we realize that he has been found worthy because he was the one who gave his life and now he was coming to take the book and i would just want to concentrate on the verse here we said as we read here it says aimed on verse 9 and it says and they sang a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou were slain and has redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred tongue and tongue and people and nation i want to take for title this morning just for a few minutes we try not to be too long a new song that's my and and and my inspiration is the song of the redeemed and i trust you part of the redeemed this morning i trust you understand that you are part of those that have been called out to the from the world we are part of those that have been redeemed we have been we are part of those that the lamb shed forth his blood and he has brought us out of this world he's brought us into a place and he's given us his song a new song to sing and that we have been called and i can say this morning we have not been called to sing like the world sings but we have been called to sing a new song and i want to say this you you have to realize as he's saying this a a new song is the description of what just has just happened a description of what took place here comes this lamb and he gave his life and he was slain before the foundation of the world and now the action actually takes place and he shed he shed forth his blood and verbanim gives such a a a a vivid description of what's happening it talks about how that when i look and there was no one worthy no one found worthy to even look upon the book and and what was happening and he says then one of the elders says weep not for the lamb is worthy and then he says and i look i look upon the throne it says then it was the lamb he says he was there was still shaking because he has just given his life and he was there a bloody lamb he said and then he came forth and he took the book and when he died when he taken the book what ranam says that john was crying and then he says someone told him he says well john was crying because he thought he was not worthy that john was not worthy of course john was not worthy of course no one was found worthy but when amanda says no but i believe john was crying because he knew the importance of that book he knew that if no one took that book everything that god had died for everything that had been done was going to be lost and therefore john was crying because he understood the importance that by taking that book everything was going to be brought back in the condition it was before and i believe as there are believers of this message we are called to understand these things because this is the revelation of what we are living for this is a revelation of what we are here for now uh just if i for as an introduction i would like to say this morning you know the the we are we are called to be reminded of the time that we are living in we we as believers we always have to be reminded of the glorious times that we are living in you know prabhanam says this is the greatest age of all the ages he says that if there was a time i was asked to be to come forth in a time it says i wouldn't pick any other age but i will come to this age you know because as as we are sitting here it's important we understand the greatness of the age and it's important that we also take the benefit of the age because if we don't understand the greatness of the age then we don't know how to uh to live the moment that we have been given if you don't understand the importance of something then it's hard for you to give your all to understand it it becomes hard for you to uh to make sure that you get all that you need to get for that particular age so believers of this message it's important it's important that we are always reminded that the time we are living in to know that this is the time where god is trying to bring his people back to the beginning where god is here for the promise of the restoration where god is here to do what he promised he will do in the end time now we understand here we are we could say uh uh uh the this is a a very troubling time for the unbeliever we and we have been told that the the situation out there we are promised it's never going to get better it's going to get worse and worse it's a very uh uh worst time for the unbeliever and we are even told that it's only going to get worse and worse this is the best time that the world will ever be in we understand that as we move forward it will only get worse and worse so we can see and understand that that's true that's uh a promise in the scripture and and the scripture also tells us that sin will continue to abound oh my you you you hear and you see the things that's happening out there you you hear those things out there some of them the they cannot even enter the ears or the understanding anymore uh you you get to a place where men don't know what's a man or what's a woman the definition of what a woman is is lost people debate what a woman is it's a crazy you that the cup of iniquity is filling up it's going to get worse and worse and that we don't have to worry about it but as a believer i want to say to us this morning god has also chosen this time to be the greatest time that's ever been in the in mankind's history you say well how about the cross because barbados calls it the greatest event that's ever happened and i'm here to tell you the cross happened the cross happened and god gave his life the resurrection happened so we can have the time that we have today without the resurrection we wouldn't be where we are so it's not a matter of comparing but it's a matter of understanding that god is building up upon what he did on the resurrection day is building up from the life that he has given us he hasn't stopped there he's bringing us somewhere and we can also say that this is the culmination of the plan of god what he's been working on since the beginning of time so as sin abound as all of this is about the devil is coming and trying to reap heaven and god is saying i will wait until the devil brings this world unto his feet until the devil takes the whole world and he makes it his until he owns the fairy world until his eden is at the very best i will wait until he does that then i will come to bring my promise to pass he didn't say well i got to do this quickly otherwise the devil is going to mess it all up no he lets him do whatever he wants to do you want to pour it in pour it in pour it in pour it in are you done you've poured it enough i was thinking about even what our pastor was talking about with the uh elijah or standing on mount carmel oh he let them he says just go ahead and they dance and they did all that they needed to do and all of that but when it came time he came he says now i want to show you that this is not a fluke i want you to take barrels of water and put it upon and pour it on they got it so wet that they were convinced that is there's no way that fire is going to light it up but it was at that time that god decided to bring his word to come to pass and i'm telling you the same showdown is happening today god is waiting for the devil to pour it on and pour it on and put on that he won and after he's done all of that god showed up and said i'm going to call my bride in this particular time what a glorious time we are living in we should never forget these things we are not like any other churches we are not like pentecost we are we live in a time where god has taken all that was good about any other church you add the first the second the third the fourth you take all of them you combine all of them together god has done that plus more oh we live in the time where it's important for us to seize the moment of the hour that we have been given it's not a time where we behave just like any other people and we conduct ourselves just as we have to seek that which has been given to us we have to look for the manifestation of it we have to hunger for it we have been given something precious we have to keep it we have to protect it you have to keep it in our heart we have to look for that which was promised to come to pass it's our promised land we heard it on wednesday it's been given to us now look at the children of israel being given the promised land but you read some of them stayed on the other side of jordan they looked at it and said oh this looks good enough for me huh i'm not going over there and moses was thinking yeah they are joshua's saying well we we're supposed to help one another you know because we're not going to conquer the others if some nations decide to stay behind but guess what they look and they was just satisfied with what they saw with our eyes but the true believer is never satisfied with what he says with their eyes a true believer want everything god has given them they want to possess it all not just for themselves they want to possess theirs they want to help their neighbors they want to help the other one they want to help the other one they want everything that was written about them they want to have it and i hope you want that this morning don't be the kind of believer who's just satisfied with a little bit you know i don't need to understand much just this is enough and you know i don't need no if the prophet said it if the word says it i want to know it i want a taste of it i want to i wanted to be part of me that's the kind of belief i want to be this morning so yeah there you are and and it was a time where the lamb has taken the book and he has opened it as we read the scripture the lamb who gave his life and now it was time for him to come and to claim his possession it was a time for him to to for that which he had died for the purpose was to return us back to the original position and i thought about giving the psalms and and the testimonies and everything when when god reveals to you something when god and i'm saying when you read it in the word and it's been opened to you god wants us to seek for those things he the the reason he shows you is so you can hunger for it the reason he opens your eyes to see is you can look for it and when he does it you got to go for it and i hope this morning we are longing to see those things and now what about them says this and this isn't a message redemption by power if i i'm just setting up the foundation so we can get somewhere in the message redemption by power he speaks and paragraph 116. i'll just jump a little bit it says now we are always pointing out we are always pointing out how wicked the world is getting if you can find it and just post it out there especially in 54 redemption by power paragraph 116. it says we are always pointing out how wicked the world is getting he says but we fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time my brother my sister we're not getting weak we're not getting fainted and we are not losing the battle the right today is a lot stronger than what the right was ten years ago a true believer is much it's it's like caleb he says i'm 80 years old i'm old he says but i'm here right now even though the ages caught up with me but at least as far as my spirit is concerned i am ready to fight than i've ever watched before when we receive the word of god it creates something in us it creates a purpose we become more determined as we move along now if you find yourself regressing something is not right if you find yourself losing interest you need to go check up but but a true believer it gets stronger as is moving forward he says we point out how wicked the world is getting but we fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time it says she's rising up she's standing on the field oh she's a little flock but brother god is with her is that she's going triumphant just as certain as christ rose from the dead amen god it says god's church shall never fail it says the gates of hell shall not prevail against it he says showed their they'll be against it but they cannot prevail the church is going to triumph through the blood of jesus christ to the victory march he says i'm positive of this one thing that god will have a church without spot or wrinkle or blemish amen i'm so happy about it and let me say this when random was preaching his message he was not concerned that oh i got to be around so i continue to preach it so i can encourage the people he knew he had the word of god and he knew that the word of god will perform that which he promised he will do he knew that when the word will go forth as long as there's a believer to believe that word remember we are not in this church by knowledge because we read the book and and because we understand what he's trying to say and all those things now the members of this church that is talking about they are elected members chosen elected to be here for the church so therefore the word that elected them the word that predestinated them to be there will keep them stronger we'll keep them overcoming will keep them growing in other words i'm trying to say it's important that we don't sing the song of the world we as believers we cannot be preoccupied by what the world is going is doing our song cannot be my goodness i thought it was going to be worse it's getting worse again a song cannot be oh my goodness i don't know how i'm going to pay my bills tomorrow a song cannot be my goodness this sickness i'm not sure when it's going to end that's not the song we have been given that's not the song we have been given to sing the song we have been doing to sing is the lamb is worthy and let me say this to you if the lamb is worthy there's nothing that you can go through this morning that the lamb is not already taken care of as believers we have to be aware i thought our pastor what he preached like last sunday just touched my heart he says he talks about your testimony and he speaks about your confession we are confessing the word as believers but what i'm saying is a believer cannot have a negative testimony it's not part of him it cannot come out of his mouth that's not who he is now i know the flesh presented presents a lot of opportunities for us to do that the flesh you walk up and the bones are aching and you know and all those things happening and just getting you ready to say something and a kid will just come by and just get ready to say something and the phone will ring and some all the condition around us is calling us for us to sing the wrong kind of song but the believer's song is not coming from outside it's coming from the written word that they've been given thou are worthy imagine you woke up and everything seems to just have broken loose and the devil is on your case and all of that and all you do is just lift your hand and say oh i know the lamb is worthy i know i'm going through this but the lamb is worthy i know he has opened the book for me i know i seen my name in there i know what he has done for me my brother my sister the the reason why we are singing or sitting here this morning is because the lamb is worthy and he has done it for you so he can give you a song to sing this morning what song are you singing this morning you know it's amazing i was thinking about it i thought you know it's amazing the description and and the way things happen in our life i just realized i'll never be able to finish or get to where i want to get but that's all right you know the things just happening you know at work and you know they'll give you so many projects and you're working on and everything and and and my goodness you put so much effort to get something done and it takes you sleepless nights and everything and you finish it and and you get to where you're gonna talk about it or say that it's done and everything and and the moment you finish everybody all that's great what's next five seconds of appreciation oh how about the other one i haven't even started rejoicing i haven't even had a chance to real oh i believe as believers that's not what we need to be god does something for you and you turn what's next no god wants you to rejoice to sing a song of praise to tell him how wonderful he is god i i was born in sin and shepherd iniquity and you got me out of the streets and i wouldn't have a life if it wasn't for you i'm here because you allow me to be in the congregation of the saints and oh god my song is a song of praise and whatever happens to me i know you already sealed me unto eternal life and this flesh can die you can get sick and whatever happens to it i don't care as long as you are with me oh that's the kind of song i want to sing this morning that's the believer's song that's what we have been called to sing we are not being called to say what the world is saying all the economy inflation and all of this and now those things affects us as human but when all is said and done you have to remember what your song is so i want to say this morning though we have the word and the revelation and is more is what's giving us for us to sing we are growing in virtue and as the bride of the end time and perhaps we'll touch on some of these things later we are not here to get weaker and weaker we have not been called to manifest darkness we have been called to sing god's song of praise we have been called to manifest the mysteries of god in the end time what the lamb has done oh this lamb is so worthy let me tell you my buddy my sister is so worthy that no one else was found worthy and everything that happens to us goes back right to that because if the lamb was not worthy then there's a fault that could be fined with us but if the lamb is worthy then it's accounted for everything now let me just move on uh we'll get to some of these things it says now i was uh reading and and and reading what is uh referred to as the song of moses and and and as a background yes the children of israel after they've been in bondage for 400 years now the promise was given to them through abraham that your children will go on to bondage for 400 years and but then i'll bring him up with the mighty hand and everything and all the things and now i want just to set the scene for you i want you to imagine here they are and and standing there before the red sea and the enemy's coming and god opens the red sea and and they walk through the land and the tri-land and they go over to the other side and then when they cross over to the other side this is referred to the song of moses now i want you as you listen to this i want you to take it in reference of what god has just done for them listen to me a song is just not words that someone puts together and everything its song has to be a reflection of a work that's been done a song is something that you are testifying of what god has just done a song is you identifying with the works that was just done for you and so yes what moses is singing now in exodus 15 if we can start from verse one it says then sung moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord it says in this fig saying i will sing unto the lord for he had triumphed gloriously the horse it says the horse and his rider has as he drowned into the sea it just happened right it says now you can see he says the lord is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation he just did it it says and he is my god and i will prepare him an inhabitation my father's god i will exalt him all the heard about the god of moses of isaac and and of jacob and all the things all its mighty acts and everything now they could say those things but yet it had not become a song for them yet that could repeat those things but yet he had not become a reality yet all but once god makes it a reality it becomes your song god gave me a song this morning i want to praise you like the people that i want to sing like moses said give me a song to say do something in my life change me bring about the change that i need bring about the revelation that i need so that i can sing a new song for you now it says the lord is the man of war the lord is his name he says pharaoh chariot and his host and he cast into the sea his chosen captain are also drowned in the right sea the depths have covered them it says they sunk unto the bottom of the as a stone is that somebody that knows about a god like that oh the enemy will come to the right hand and to the left hand but the lord is the man of war he says thy right hand oh lord it says he's become glorious in power thy right hand o lord has dashed a p at pieces of in pieces the enemy it says in thy greatness in that excellency thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee oh my brother my sister this is the song of the redeemed this is a people god is not interested let me say this god is not interested of praise that he had not given satan will take that god don't want you to come here this morning and talk about salvation sing about salvation when you have no idea what salvation is about god don't want you to come here and talk about healing and don't know what healing is all about deliverance when you don't know what deliverance is about now he is calling you is he has a song but for you to sing it he wants to give you the revelation of it this morning he's not casting you out he's calling you he said you heard them sing you heard him shout now come here i'll give you the same words so you can sing the same song oh a song the praise to the lord oh i just never finished this it says and in thy greatness it says and in thy greatness and in our excellence thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sent ascended thou sentest forth thy wrath which consumed them it's as subtle it says and with the blast of thy nostril the waters were gathered together it says the flow stood upright as a hip and the depths were were concealed and the heart in the in the heart of the sea it says the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide this poll oh my they already plain of what we're gonna do they already talked about how they were gonna take them and what they were gonna do with them and it says all my laces it says i will divide this point my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them it says thou didst blow thy wing it says the sea covered them they sang they they sank as they sank as lead in the mighty water he says who is like unto thee oh lord among the gods my brother my sister we have a song to sing this morning if god has never done anything for you this is your opportunity this morning for him to give you a song so you can know him like your parents know him so you can know him like the prophet knew him so you can know him like no one else before oh my he says who is like unto thee oh god oh lord among the gods who is like thee glorious is glorious in holiness fearful in praise doing wonders thou stretched it out thy right hand the earth swallowed them it says thou in thy mercy has led forth the people which thou has redeemed it says thou has guided them in thy strength unto the holy habitation he says the people shall hear and be afraid think about this as part of the song when god is doing this he's doing this now but he's already warning your future enemies think about this he's already warning your future enemies so when you sing the song the enemy hears the song and says what kind of god is that oh he said oh he opened the right sea and he swallowed them now remember when he talked about when he came to jericho people in jericho they heard those songs they heard what god had done with other nations they had heard about this greatness about all that he could do and just by hearing they were fearful before even one wall could start so when god gives you a song it's not for you to keep it for yourself you meet someone who's sick i know i forgot i don't have the power to heal you i don't have the power to do anything for you in fact i don't even have the power to change you but i know a god and he can come and i can speak his word you can receive his word and receive the same thing that i receive that's the song of a believer that's the song of the overcomer he has given me a song he has put praises on my lips david says one place how shall i sing if you destroy me if these things don't happen what will i say if god doesn't save me how can i sing of his salvation but oh if he saves me i'll let the whole world know it says the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall be shall take hold of the inhabitation of palestine they hadn't even gotten there they hadn't even gotten there already the fame of this god had already reached and done the work that he was supposed to do before that's why when he says go go forward he says i have taken i have taken the land i have taken the land but i call you to go so what he wants you to do he wants you to understand you are not the one that's fighting the battle he the the very testimony that he surrounds you with is the very victory that goes with you so all he wants you to do is repeat the things that he has done so that the things that he has done move forward before you to take care of what you needed in the future i mentioned it last time i preached here but there's a thing called the i just i don't know where i got it i just it just came to me it's the wilderness mentality and that's always to appreciate the past more than the present it's it's always talking about the past being more glorious than the future it's always focusing on oh i wish i had that i wish this i wish that and never having the realization of what god is doing and what he's going to do he says then the dukes the dukes of eden shall be amazed the mighty men of moab tram it says trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canon shall melt away fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over oh lord till the people pass over thou it says shall pass over which thou has had purchased it says that shall bring them in plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance we heard about that this morning in the place o lord which thou has made for that for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary o lord which thou has established it says the lord shall reign forever and ever for the horse for the ho for the horse of the philis the pharaohs went in went in with his chariot with his horsemen into the sea it says the lord brought again the water of the sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea it says and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took the trembling in her hand and all the women went out after her with the trap with the trembling it says and with a dance and miriam answered them singing yeah the lord yeah to the lord for here triumph gloriously the horse and his rider had drawn in the sea repeating the same verse that's what the believer testimony is how do you win somebody to the lord when your own testimony or your own song is doom and gloom oh you know i remember when i was in the well you know but now i don't do those things anymore you know i i remember this and but you know i don't do those things you know if it wasn't for the lord as i go by i don't mean that kind of song i want to hear the song of praise you know the song of praise when he started even when i was born it says even in my mother's womb before i was conceived i was still in the world but yet there was a desire i was still there so i would do this but then i won't have peace and this will have well it was still the song even in your unbelief you just didn't know that it was a song but when you come to the other side the whole song become clear now i can see why this happened now i can see why that person told me this now i can see why this happened over here why it's the song of your life and let me say this tonight the song that god has given you in the same time it's not a temporary song it's not a song that we're gonna change just here it's a song for eternity it's it's the only song we're to sing forever it's the only saying when the angel gathers we sing what's up or when they redeem it says we'll sing redemption stories we'll sing songs that the angel have no idea they cannot join the song they don't know what the song means they just look in amazement why because we have been given a portion of the course that only us can seem i'm not even halfway so we'll try to end somewhere and then pick it up tonight now what about him says he says now those egyptian task master had drove the people to do things that they were burdened to do and after they looked back in the red sea they found them everyone drowned therein no wonder that moses sang a new song amen no wonder moses sang a new song he sang in the spirit and miriam picked up the tambourine and began to beat the tambourine and run down the banks and dancing it says oh if that and an old-fashioned holy ghost meeting i never seen one it says that's right and the daughters of israel followed her doing the same thing they had overcome they had overcome and you are sitting here because you are an overcomer you are here because you've overcome the world you are here because god has done something for you in other words what that which was just a promise in the book that which was just written that is going to happen when god makes the manifestation of that becomes a reality to the believer it becomes a new song when that which was promised when that which was written when god takes his word and makes it real to you when it takes and it gives you the revelation of it not the words of it the revelation of it it becomes a new song to you amen now he says this listen it says and the man never know what is what it is to live a victorious life until he is completely overcome you know what it is you're just singing somebody else's song you're just repeating the words that somebody else said now i know we can go a whole hot line right now but let's just skip here we talk about music we talk about those things the idea is not so you just like the tunes the idea is the identification the idea is the identification is there anything in there that connects it's not the beat you know i i joke that without the beat i can't do anything you know when the musicians come up here you know if you if you're sitting closer i mean i'm just stamping because i gotta get the beat but what is your song this morning is your song this morning is god giving you a song if you don't have asked him to give you one this morning said god i i my song is only halfway my song my song is only a quarter i can only sing about your salvation but i haven't experienced the other side yet i don't know what it means to be this and i don't know what it means to be a positioned son why don't you come this morning and just give me a song why don't you come this morning and just reveal yourself to me why don't you come and give me a new song remember the song is the same person it's not another group that cross over and sing a different song no it's the same people and one time they would get and one time they were not worthy to sing the soul at one time they couldn't even answer the word the next moment after what the lord has done it gives them the ability to sing the song ask him for a song this morning we're not here to to call out one another or to expose one another that the purpose of preaching is not so one can feel the shame no but the purpose is so that when you don't have when you lack that god can come this morning and provide whatever we are like and and i i just said lord i'm lacking this morning i need a song to sing i need to polish the word of my song and i sing it for a while and now it seems like i've had it crushed on it and it's not coming out perfectly come and clean me this morning so the words of the song can be more powerful again if the musician could come we'll just continue tonight i'm sorry i've only i have 20 pages so there's no way we're gonna david says in psalm it says psalm 144 it says my goodness and my fortress my fortress it says my high tower my deliver and my shield in whom i trust whom subdued my my people under me it says the lord is what is what is a man the lord what is a it says what is a man that doubt taketh knowledge of him that taketh knowledge of him or the son of man that thou maketh him account that make it account of him he says man is like vanity his days are as shadow pass away it says bow his heave vow it says bow thou heaven oh lord and come down touch the mountain they shall smoke it says cast forth lightning and cast and scatter them shoot out an arrow and destroy them send thine hand from above read me old and deliver me oh it says deliver me out of that great the great waters it says from the hand of the strange children here is david he's calling out for a song it says god i need a song to sing i i need you to do this i perhaps that's what you need this morning i need you to give me a song to say i need you to get my enemy right out of me and now in verse in verse 8 it says i will sing a new song unto the lord upon a sultry of in a nest in an instrument of 10 string i will sing praises unto thee it says it is he that giveth salvation unto kings who delivered david his servant from the hurtful sword oh accounting for the story of goliath we heard it on wednesday oh yeah they are after david has overcame they sang a new song they added words perhaps a song existed by now they had a new course they could come back and say oh yes david it says saul came and killed thousands but david tens of thousands of thousands oh it's the song of the lamb he wants to sing it through you this morning it's not even your song it's his testimony coming out through you but he has put it on your lips so you can sing it give me a song to sing don't ever try to be a believer who sings something they don't know if i can help this morning don't ever try to add a wrap things you don't understand ask him for a new song we
