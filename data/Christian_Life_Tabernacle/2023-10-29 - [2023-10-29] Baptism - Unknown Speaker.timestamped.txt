[5:03] it's just a blessing to be in the house
[5:05] of the Lord again and to um see what God
[5:09] can do in the life of
[5:11] someone um this young
[5:15] sister she um texted me when I was in
[5:19] Cameroon um she said I want to get
[5:22] baptized I tried to not discourage her
[5:26] but I wanted to know really if she was
[5:29] wanting to do it and I just kind of
[5:32] delayed and so I told her I'll see you
[5:34] on Sunday and we'll go to church and see
[5:37] if we can get to baptized but yesterday
[5:39] I just landed in Cameroon and I called
[5:41] her and I said I'm going to come talk to
[5:44] you some more and when I got to her home
[5:47] she said the Lord had told me something
[5:49] was going to happen Saturday I said well
[5:52] what what is it she said I want to get
[5:54] baptized tonight I said I can't do it
[5:57] tonight I said I don't I don't even know
[5:59] the area I don't know anywhere around
[6:01] here just I said let's go to church
[6:03] tomorrow I said what you want to go to
[6:04] church I want to go to brother David's I
[6:07] said well tomorrow we're going to talk
[6:08] to Brother David and then we'll see if
[6:10] we can get you baptized she said okay so
[6:13] we came to church this morning and when
[6:16] I heard bir David was sick I said oh my
[6:18] goodness Lord how we going to do this
[6:21] and so we got out of church she caught
[6:23] me right of the door she said you didn't
[6:24] see me I said I did I said just give me
[6:27] a second let me call here David and so
[6:30] when I got to the corner and I called
[6:31] Brother David I said I explained I said
[6:33] Brother David this is a young sister
[6:34] she' been coming she went away from the
[6:37] Lord and she's felt conviction to make
[6:38] her life right to come back to the Lord
[6:41] and she wants to get baptized he said
[6:42] call her to Billy get her in there the
[6:45] pool's ready get a
[6:46] baptized and so when I told her I said
[6:49] David said we can go ahead and get you
[6:51] baptized she said my stuff's in the
[6:53] car and so um it's just a blessing for
[6:58] me to see what God is doing doing in her
[7:00] life and to thank God that God is still
[7:04] calling God's still
[7:06] transforming God still saving and I told
[7:10] her yesterday I said I can relate with
[7:12] you because I was born around the
[7:14] message and I I I back I went away all
[7:17] the way I said but God was good to me
[7:21] that he came and brought me back and I
[7:23] said I'm thankful that God is calling
[7:25] you back and anything that I can do I
[7:28] said I would do it to him help you and
[7:30] so I just thank you all for being with
[7:32] didn't know everybody was going to be
[7:33] here and she herself didn't know but
[7:36] there has to be Witnesses someone has to
[7:39] see to testify and so I thank God for
[7:42] what he's doing for her
[7:43] today my sister Sephora NOA I want to
[7:47] read what the word of God has said in
[7:50] the book of Acts chapter 2 2 and from
[7:52] verse 37 it says this now when they
[7:56] heard this they were pricked in their
[7:58] heart and they said unto Peter and to
[8:01] the the rest of the Apostles men and
[8:03] Brethren what shall we do then Peter
[8:07] said unto them repent and be baptized
[8:10] every one of you in the name of the Lord
[8:12] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[8:15] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[8:18] the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto
[8:20] you and to your children and to all that
[8:23] are far off even as many as the Lord Our
[8:27] God shall call
[8:29] that's the word of the
[8:40] Lord my sister no do you accept the Lord
[8:45] Jesus Christ as your personal
[8:47] Savior and is this a choice of yours
[8:51] personally
[8:58] okay
[9:03] okay my
[9:06] sister uh by virtue of your confession
[9:09] and acceptance the Lord Jesus Christ as
[9:11] your personal savior we baptize you in
[9:14] the name of the Lord Jesus
[9:20] [Applause]
[9:28] Christ
