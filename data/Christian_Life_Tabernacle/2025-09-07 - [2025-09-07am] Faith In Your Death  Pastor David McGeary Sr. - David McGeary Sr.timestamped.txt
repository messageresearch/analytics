[22:47] just lift your hand out to him this
[22:49] morning. Amen. He knows your heart.
[22:51] Amen. The most important thing is that
[22:53] so that he knows and we come together as
[22:56] one people. We could pray in faith that
[22:58] the Lord will certainly hear your need
[23:00] this morning. Brother Tim Saler has a
[23:02] message for us if you could come at this
[23:05] time. Um and then after that, we'll the
[23:08] brothers that are collecting the
[23:09] offerings will come and we'll do that.
[23:11] Amen.
[23:14] God bless you.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Good morning. Morning. I greet you in
[23:18] the name of the Lord Jesus. Welcome
[23:21] to the house of God this morning. Uh
[23:23] just a little bit of housekeeping
[23:25] regarding Sunday school activities.
[23:27] Today is the first day of Sunday school.
[23:28] As you probably realize, you got your
[23:30] children in. Um
[23:34] we'd like you to have them in anywhere
[23:35] from 9:30 up until 10:00. Uh after
[23:39] 10:00, we're going to close the doors
[23:41] and class will begin and bring your
[23:43] children on in if you're if you're past
[23:45] that time. Um a couple things we need to
[23:48] take care of is that all the classrooms
[23:53] uh other than class times are off
[23:56] limits. So, if you need to take your
[23:57] child out and there's not enough space
[23:59] and overflow and you go into the to the
[24:01] fellowship hall for feeding your
[24:04] children or letting them get their
[24:05] energy out or whatever, they don't go in
[24:08] the classrooms. They're not lockable,
[24:10] but we don't want you in the classrooms,
[24:12] especially the open classroom that we
[24:14] have to use in the edge of the
[24:16] fellowship hall. There are probably
[24:18] tables out, work being going on.
[24:23] That's not for use of entertainment for
[24:25] the children. We don't need scribbling,
[24:26] writing, all the decorations. Teachers
[24:29] work hard and putting those things up.
[24:30] So, we need that's off limits as well.
[24:32] Okay. Uh there's a supply room and
[24:35] that's for Sunday school only. So, we
[24:37] don't go in there to get crayons and
[24:39] paper so they can write on that kind of
[24:41] thing. Um so, please respect that and it
[24:46] will be monitored. Uh, also as you go in
[24:49] the fellowship hall to the left, there
[24:50] are a couple tables there of lost and
[24:53] found items and it's starting to grow
[24:57] and we need to get those out of there.
[24:59] So, if there's any items you think you
[25:01] may have lost, Bibles, clothing items,
[25:06] barrettes, everything you put in your
[25:08] hair, everything, it's all accumulated
[25:09] over there. So, that's going to be going
[25:12] away if no one claims it. It'll be
[25:13] donated or or taken out. So, if if
[25:16] you've lost anything, you're welcome to
[25:19] go search through and find your items.
[25:22] Um,
[25:23] I just I want you to know that, you
[25:25] know, we we highly regard your children
[25:28] and responsibility that we have. Um,
[25:33] Jesus himself told Pilate, he said,
[25:37] "Everyone that is of the truth heareth
[25:40] my voice."
[25:42] And I think
[25:44] as our brother prayed this morning,
[25:48] when the minister comes, we want to see
[25:49] the person of Jesus Christ
[25:52] &gt;&gt; manifested in his word. And if we
[25:55] realize each one of us have the same
[25:58] vindication, same manifestation that we
[26:00] have to live out in our lives. Okay? Our
[26:02] Sunday school teachers work hard on
[26:04] prepping the the information and we feel
[26:07] like we want to give them the very truth
[26:09] and they grow into the grace and
[26:11] knowledge of the Lord Jesus. It's a
[26:13] present day Lord Jesus that we're trying
[26:15] to express.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; So Lord bless you in these efforts. If
[26:19] you have any questions and if you
[26:20] haven't registered your children, please
[26:22] register them. Uh they're very welcome.
[26:25] Uh we'll get them on the list and uh and
[26:28] get them in Sunday school. Any questions
[26:31] just see me after or sister Melinda
[26:34] whatever you have need of we'll try to
[26:35] provide Lord bless you
[26:40] he's asked me to to pray over the
[26:43] request I do that as well so let's all
[26:45] just bow our heads
[26:49] our gracious and kind heavenly father
[26:51] truly Lord
[26:53] we want to manifest you in everything we
[26:55] say and do and Lord as a heavenly father
[26:59] &gt;&gt; you have oversight
[27:00] You have control. You have dominion. And
[27:03] Lord, we come as your children. Lord,
[27:05] submit ourselves.
[27:07] And ask Lord
[27:10] humbly that you would do for us, Lord,
[27:13] what we have need of. Lord, you wouldn't
[27:16] turn us away. And Lord, you know our
[27:19] needs, the earnings of our hearts, Lord,
[27:21] the the the cry,
[27:24] Lord, of even our spirits this morning.
[27:26] Lord, we pray that you'd fill in every
[27:28] gap, every missing piece. Lord, we might
[27:31] be complete and whole when we leave this
[27:33] place. Lord, we realize this by the
[27:35] preaching of the word, Lord, that we
[27:37] step up a little higher. We come to more
[27:39] grace, more knowledge, Lord, by the very
[27:42] truth, Lord. You express it to Pilate
[27:46] yourself, Lord. When you're here in the
[27:48] flesh,
[27:49] Lord, he said, "I find no fault in this
[27:52] man."
[27:54] And Lord, we can't find any fault
[27:56] because you were the perfect sacrifice.
[27:58] And Lord, if we'll accept that and apply
[28:00] it to our lives with the blood of
[28:01] Christ, we can also walk before you and
[28:04] be perfect. Grant it now, Lord, as we we
[28:08] just endeavor to serve you and lift you
[28:10] up, Lord. Bless the tithes and the
[28:12] offerings that are collected, Lord. Any
[28:14] needs or requests in the hearts of the
[28:16] people, Lord, may you just complete the
[28:19] work in them. We grant it now in the
[28:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[28:24] Amen. Amen.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; You were the world in the beginning,
[28:36] one with God, the Lord most high.

[43:14] like you in every way,
[43:18] full of your love,
[43:21] full of your compassion, full of your
[43:23] power. And yet, Father, every bit
[43:29] our kinsmen
[43:33] and he sacrificed, Father, in ourstead
[43:38] to set us free. We ask you to bless us
[43:42] this morning as we fellowship around
[43:45] your word and and
[43:49] just share our heart with the people
[43:51] this morning, Father, that they have a
[43:55] full understanding of my heart and the
[43:57] direction that
[44:00] my heart is leading me, Father, that
[44:03] they can make a choice if this is the
[44:05] path they would choose to go. We ask you
[44:09] to bless them and help us this morning.
[44:13] And may your presence be here, Father,
[44:16] for those that need you, Father. We're
[44:19] all needy, but Father, there may be some

[44:26] that you would come by and show your
[44:28] mercy and goodness to them. We ask these
[44:31] things in Jesus precious and holy name
[44:35] we pray. Amen.
[44:38] Amen. God bless you. If you have your
[44:40] Bibles this morning, we're going to turn
[44:42] to um
[44:45] uh we're going to read quite several
[44:47] different scriptures this morning, kind
[44:50] of maybe like in a little of a Bible
[44:53] school uh type lesson. Uh and so we're
[44:58] going to start with Romans 6 uh uh verse
[45:02] chapter 6, 6 and 7. But I just want to
[45:05] make a a little uh clarification.
[45:10] Um this morning uh uh during our youth
[45:15] meeting, they they made an announcement
[45:17] about an upcoming meeting in Carolina.
[45:21] And I just want you to know they they
[45:23] played that video without my knowledge.
[45:26] and the and uh cuz I I want you to know
[45:30] we're not against the meeting or against
[45:33] any ministry. But um we don't really
[45:37] promote any other preachers or
[45:39] ministries here but brother Brandham. I
[45:42] just want you to know that and we you
[45:47] know we don't want you to go to a
[45:50] meeting
[45:52] because
[45:54] of the food or the facility
[45:59] &gt;&gt; or the preachers.
[46:01] We want you to go because you've prayed
[46:03] about it. and you feel led by the Holy
[46:06] Spirit. And uh uh I I am going through a
[46:14] uh I guess my age, you know, I'm seeing
[46:18] such a trend and such a move to
[46:22] modernism.
[46:23] It is I down more. All right. Maybe hear
[46:28] hear me better now. Okay. All right. So
[46:32] we're going to uh uh such a trend of of
[46:36] entertainment
[46:38] and modernism, you know, so uh you
[46:42] everything's got to be some sort of uh
[46:45] picture or some sort of video.
[46:49] And in fact, they even have uh what do
[46:52] they call AI
[46:55] Brother Brandham movies?
[46:58] And that's just not the way it was in
[47:00] the beginning.
[47:02] And this whole age that we're living in
[47:06] is a is a going back age and and the
[47:10] curse of the age. I think brother Paul
[47:12] or one of the brothers here preached on
[47:14] it was about modernism
[47:16] and everything's getting so modern. And
[47:20] so Satan has always used the eyes
[47:25] to attract.
[47:27] Remember when Eve saw the fruit, she saw
[47:32] that it was a good it was appealing to
[47:36] her eye. Now the word doesn't appeal to
[47:41] your eye. It only appeals to the seed
[47:46] &gt;&gt; that's in you.
[47:48] So, you know, when we start bypassing
[47:51] that, so I should be able to come up
[47:53] here and say, uh, November 12th, 13th,
[47:57] and 14th, we're having a our annual
[48:00] meeting, uh, Brother Ray will, and we'll
[48:04] be ministering. Uh, uh, uh, father and
[48:08] son by the grace of the Lord, Lord
[48:10] willing, and, uh, we just want you to
[48:13] know about it. I would hope that the
[48:16] Holy Spirit would come down and say,
[48:19] "You need to go to that meeting or or I
[48:22] want to be there." You know what I mean?
[48:24] But if I put a buffet up here,
[48:28] you know, show the barbecue,
[48:31] you know what I mean? and then show all
[48:33] the activities and you know show then
[48:37] then now you're dealing with
[48:42] what's motivating your choice.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; You you you you see what I'm saying? So,
[48:49] I'm not against any of that, but I'm
[48:51] just saying that we've got to find real
[48:53] clarity
[48:55] within ourselves
[48:57] of what motivates our choices, what's
[49:01] stimulating us, what's speaking to us.
[49:05] And
[49:08] as a pastor, you know that uh
[49:12] that we're concerned because this is the
[49:16] age of many, many voices. And there's
[49:19] just so much coming at you. And
[49:22] everybody wants you to make a decision
[49:25] or a judgment. And a lot of things you
[49:27] don't have to make a decision on. Just
[49:30] ignore them is the best thing. But
[49:33] anyway, I sorry I kept you standing, but
[49:35] I'm going to keep you seated for a long
[49:37] time. So, we're trying to balance it
[49:39] out.
[49:40] Let's open our Bibles here, and I'll
[49:42] find my scripture uh here in in Romans.
[49:47] um uh sixth
[49:50] um chapter of Romans and we'll read our
[49:54] scripture and we'll start our Sunday
[49:57] school uh lesson today and um
[50:06] so as we read we'll go we can might as
[50:11] well just start at the first verse of
[50:13] Romans. It never hurts to read our
[50:15] scripture.
[50:17] What shall we say then? Shall we
[50:20] continue in sin that grace may abound?
[50:25] God forbid.
[50:27] How shall we that are dead to sin live
[50:33] any longer therein?
[50:37] Know ye not that so many of us as were
[50:42] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[50:46] into his death.
[50:50] Therefore, we are buried with him by
[50:53] baptism unto death.
[50:57] that like as Christ
[51:00] was risen up from the dead by the glory
[51:05] of the Father, even so are we also
[51:10] should walk in the newness of life.
[51:15] For if we have been planted together in
[51:19] the likeness of his death, we shall be
[51:24] also in the likeness of his
[51:26] resurrection.
[51:28] Knowing this, that our old man is
[51:32] crucified with him, that the body of sin
[51:36] might be destroyed,
[51:39] that henceforth we should not serve sin.
[51:44] For he that is dead is free from sin.
[51:50] God bless you. You may be seated this
[51:52] morning.
[52:05] you know, in in
[52:09] the most
[52:11] all of uh Brother Brandham's sermons and
[52:16] messages and dealing with the church and
[52:20] preaching to the church, he always tries
[52:24] to get the church to go back to the
[52:27] beginning. So go back to where it
[52:30] started. Uh even when you want to get
[52:34] renew your life in the Lord Jesus and
[52:38] maybe you've gone through a period of
[52:40] backsliding.
[52:42] You've quit reading your Bible. You've
[52:44] got involved in the world. Uh maybe
[52:48] you've you've drifted and you've got
[52:50] cold and informal and and you're you're
[52:55] you're just not serving God the way that
[52:58] it satisfies your heart. I'm sure we've
[53:00] all been there. Uh if if a man says he
[53:04] hasn't sinned, he's a liar. You know
[53:06] what I mean? But but what we do is you
[53:10] say, "How do I get back to that?" Well,
[53:13] you have to go. So you want to get back
[53:16] to where you were, you got to go back to
[53:19] where you left them.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; And and so as the church began to
[53:24] progress, we know that the church in the
[53:27] beginning at Pentecost, the the church
[53:30] was formed at Pentecost. The the
[53:33] disciples were gathered in an upper
[53:35] room. They were uh afraid
[53:40] uh their they had given their lives and
[53:44] changed the way that they were living
[53:46] and they left what they were doing and
[53:49] begin to follow and help in the ministry
[53:52] of Jesus Christ. They they went out made
[53:55] announcements. They went out praying for
[53:57] the sick and going to different towns
[54:00] letting everybody know that he was here
[54:03] on the earth. The ministry was moving.
[54:06] People were coming into the ministry to
[54:09] uh to be to see him. 5,000 showed up.
[54:13] His disciples helped feed them. So, they
[54:16] had given their lives to the to the
[54:19] ministry. And then when all of a sudden
[54:23] he was taken from them and they were
[54:26] astonished that he didn't resist
[54:30] that he didn't fight back. you you know
[54:33] what I mean? Uh that he didn't call
[54:36] 10,000 angels like that song. He could
[54:39] have called 10,000 angels. And and Jesus
[54:43] said that to Pilate. He said, "If my
[54:45] kingdom were of this world, my armies
[54:48] would have come and fought for me, but
[54:51] my kingdom is not of this world." And uh
[54:55] so when they went out and they were in
[54:58] the upper room, Jesus told them, "Go
[55:00] there. Come back here. stay there and
[55:03] wait because I am going to visit you. I
[55:09] will send you another comforter. And and
[55:13] a lot of times people get that word
[55:16] another mixed up. It's I'm going to send
[55:19] you a comforter in a different form. You
[55:22] know what I mean? There's not another
[55:24] God. But God is immorph. He takes on
[55:28] different form. So he he was with him.
[55:30] So he said, "I'll be with you even in
[55:33] you till the end. I will come again that
[55:36] where I am, you may be also." So when he
[55:38] said in the upper room, he said, "I'm
[55:40] I'm I'm going to send you another
[55:42] comforter." He says, "I'm going to come
[55:45] to you in a different form. I'm here
[55:48] with you in the flesh, but now I'm going
[55:51] to show up. It's going to be me
[55:55] in spirit form.
[55:57] It's going to be me, and I am going to
[55:59] empower you. I am going to come down and
[56:03] meet with you and fill you and you are
[56:07] going to experience the experience of
[56:11] the inddwelling presence of my spirit in
[56:15] you.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; And so they went to the upper room and
[56:19] they prayed and all of a sudden clothing
[56:20] tongues of fire broke up. They knew that
[56:23] he was there. They they they knew it was
[56:27] him and they knew they were filled with
[56:30] his power and his strength. They had
[56:33] just received the same power that raised
[56:37] Jesus from the dead. If the same spirit
[56:40] that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in
[56:43] you, it will also quicken your mortal
[56:46] body. So now they were there. They were
[56:49] afraid. They were there in their belief,
[56:54] in their faith, in their strength, in
[56:58] their decision. But now they had no
[57:01] confidence in that.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I'm going to strengthen
[57:07] you. I'm going to come again and be with
[57:10] you, even in you to end. I will come in
[57:14] another form, another comforter. I you
[57:17] I'm with you now." And you find comfort.
[57:20] but I go away. But you will know I am in
[57:24] the Father and the Father in me and I in
[57:27] you.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; So So he he was laying that out to us.
[57:33] And that was the beginning of the
[57:36] church. That's what the church was built
[57:38] on. It was built on the the spirit of
[57:44] the Lord Jesus Christ, the same spirit
[57:46] that raised him from the dead coming and
[57:50] dwelling in a believer.
[57:53] And there was a pathway to that.
[57:56] And and on the day of Pentecost that it
[58:01] was obvious to those that were there
[58:05] witnessing that that something had
[58:08] transpired,
[58:10] that there was something there that was
[58:13] different. And they inquired, "Men and
[58:16] brethren, what must we do? What we hear
[58:20] you speaking in our own tongues? People
[58:22] are getting well. Your your your
[58:25] presence is here. We sense that. Uh we
[58:28] thought you were drunk, but you were so
[58:30] moved in the spirit and you you quickly
[58:33] referred us to the scriptures. This
[58:36] these men are not drunk as you suppose.
[58:38] But this is what was prophesied by Joel
[58:41] that I'll pour out my spirit upon my
[58:44] sons and daughters. And and and there
[58:47] were those there that saw it.
[58:52] And remember, there's always seers and
[58:55] nonseers.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; There's always believers and
[58:59] non-believers.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; There was people that were caught in the
[59:04] middle. They didn't know what to
[59:06] believe. They wanted to believe it, but
[59:08] yet they felt the pull of the
[59:10] unbelievers. They felt the pull of
[59:12] believers. And they always remained in
[59:15] that constant flux. uh the scripture
[59:18] even say choose this day whom you're
[59:21] going to serve but as for me in my house
[59:24] we'll serve the Lord. So that decision
[59:27] has never left man. Man always finds
[59:29] themsself caught between those two
[59:32] places. Uh it's very difficult. Many
[59:36] believers sometimes have been involved
[59:38] in churches and false doctrines and and
[59:41] all kinds of things. They've built their
[59:43] lifestyle in it and then their eyes are
[59:46] opened and and it's a terrible battle of
[59:50] leaving those things which are behind
[59:53] and moving forward into something new.
[59:56] Even when you leave sin and you leave
[59:59] the world, it you've got so many
[1:00:01] friends, so many habits, so many ways of
[1:00:04] life, so many lifestyles that that it's
[1:00:07] difficult to make that transition. But
[1:00:11] but so in the beginning
[1:00:14] that was the beginning of the church and
[1:00:17] our messenger always continually. So
[1:00:20] even when they asked Jesus the great
[1:00:22] question about marriage and divorce
[1:00:26] uh and they wanted to know his answer to
[1:00:29] them was it wasn't so from the
[1:00:33] beginning. So let us go back to the
[1:00:37] beginning and if we go back to the
[1:00:40] beginning then we can understand
[1:00:44] what is transpiring
[1:00:46] and so that's where my heart is. You
[1:00:50] notice I last Wednesday night we played
[1:00:54] the the uh video that the full gospel
[1:00:58] businessmen had put out. They were
[1:00:59] trying to raise funds and and send the
[1:01:03] prophet of God to Israel. They thought
[1:01:06] that that they would convert the Jews.
[1:01:08] Um and of course, Brother Brandham
[1:01:12] evangelistic heart doing the work of
[1:01:15] evangelists.
[1:01:16] He said, "Yes, I I would I think this
[1:01:18] ministry would help bring many Jews to
[1:01:21] the Lord."
[1:01:22] But then, as you know, the Lord spoke to
[1:01:24] him and said that God's got a plan for
[1:01:26] them. and uh and his being the Elijah
[1:01:31] that he was, there was a portion of him
[1:01:34] that felt that plan. And so if I I would
[1:01:39] interject a lot of things here, but I I
[1:01:42] I believe this message will go to
[1:01:45] Israel. You you and uh so because it's
[1:01:49] the truth.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; So um you can go run with that wherever
[1:01:55] you want. So, uh, but I'm pretty happy
[1:01:58] with what I see. So, um, but so if we go
[1:02:03] back to the beginning, so this is what I
[1:02:08] I want to kind of make sure that you
[1:02:12] understand because nowadays
[1:02:17] everybody's trying to either want you to
[1:02:19] be for or against you. Are you against
[1:02:22] this? Are you against that? Am I against
[1:02:25] shouting in the church? No. The Holy
[1:02:28] Ghost can shout all he wants. If he
[1:02:30] wants to use you to shout, I'm all for
[1:02:33] it. But I don't really care for your
[1:02:35] shouting.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; So, it's got a completely different
[1:02:42] sound.
[1:02:44] It's got a one one.
[1:02:47] Yeah, I won't go there. All right. I'm
[1:02:50] I'm I'm all for worship. Don't let
[1:02:52] anybody ever think I don't want you to
[1:02:54] raise your hands, praise God, let tears
[1:02:58] uh come down. Yeah. You know what I
[1:03:01] mean? If it's the spirit of God moves on
[1:03:03] you, um then we want that to be there.
[1:03:07] You know, we we want it to come to you
[1:03:10] spiritually. We don't want it to be
[1:03:13] produced.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; We want it to be bore. We want it to be
[1:03:18] because of the spirit, because of the
[1:03:20] opening of of your heart and the move of
[1:03:23] the spirit of God on you. So, we're
[1:03:25] we're not against this, we're not
[1:03:27] against this or against that or for this
[1:03:31] way and for that way. uh we just want
[1:03:35] what's truth
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; and and so we and and so that's why I I
[1:03:42] wanted to go back
[1:03:45] to the beginning and I think a lot of
[1:03:48] times you've got to go back to the
[1:03:50] beginning to understand where you are
[1:03:52] now. You you don't know how far off
[1:03:55] course you are unless you understand
[1:03:59] your starting point.
[1:04:01] And that's what was so beautiful about
[1:04:03] the north star, you know, is that the
[1:04:06] north, the evening star, and the morning
[1:04:08] star were the same star. You could
[1:04:10] always know where you were at by that
[1:04:14] star, but you had to go back to that
[1:04:17] star to get your bearings.
[1:04:21] So, you know, if you're lost, in order
[1:04:24] to get your bearings, you know what your
[1:04:27] bearing is? your direction, your
[1:04:29] straight line. You have to go back to
[1:04:32] the beginning to know where you started
[1:04:36] from in order to get the straight line
[1:04:39] to where you're going.
[1:04:42] And and so you and and there's no other
[1:04:47] way but God's provided way to do that.
[1:04:52] And and I I've been in the message now
[1:04:56] for so many years. I don't think that
[1:04:58] matters. I'm being constantly reminded
[1:05:01] by everybody around me that I'm one of
[1:05:04] the elders now, you know, and I think
[1:05:07] that's totally debatable.
[1:05:10] But um uh this thing may have a lot of
[1:05:13] years on it, but this thing in here is
[1:05:16] just getting started. So, uh, uh, and
[1:05:20] I've seen a lot, you know, I have
[1:05:23] there's most all the ministry that I
[1:05:26] started out with, the guys that
[1:05:28] preached, the guys that were in brother
[1:05:30] Brandon's meetings. I was very fortunate
[1:05:32] as a young man coming into the message
[1:05:35] and right around 1970, right in that
[1:05:39] four or five month period in there to
[1:05:42] meet most of those gentlemen. And I I
[1:05:46] noticed they all had a certain nature
[1:05:49] about him because the prophet of God had
[1:05:52] an effect on him.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; The way that he was had an effect on him
[1:06:00] and just the the prog the progress of
[1:06:06] things. And so that's why the I I I
[1:06:11] played this the tape Wednesday night
[1:06:13] tonight. Uh we hope you come back. I I I
[1:06:16] don't know what u event is going on this
[1:06:20] evening. Uh why you wouldn't come back.
[1:06:23] Uh um we've offered to buy your gas.
[1:06:27] We've offered to get your lunch if you
[1:06:30] need it. But for for whatever reason, or
[1:06:33] maybe you just don't like Sunday night
[1:06:35] church. That's all right. You can
[1:06:38] doesn't matter to me. here. If you don't
[1:06:41] like church, uh uh I understand. You
[1:06:45] know what I mean? Uh I go to a lot of
[1:06:47] church, you know what I mean? So, but
[1:06:52] we're going to play this evening the
[1:06:55] film
[1:06:56] from Washington DC called The Deep Call
[1:07:00] to the Deep. That's around the time of
[1:07:03] Congressman Upshaw's healing and and
[1:07:06] those times. And the reason for that is
[1:07:09] to remind us and bring us back to the
[1:07:13] beginning.
[1:07:16] You understand that? To bring us back to
[1:07:19] the beginning so we can understand what
[1:07:22] was our foundation. What were we built
[1:07:25] on? What what was what where did we come
[1:07:29] from? And we're gonna look at that
[1:07:32] through the eyes of the scriptures this
[1:07:35] morning. And we're gonna and if you want
[1:07:38] to get a a wonderful message that has a
[1:07:42] lot of what I'm talking about in it,
[1:07:45] it's the sermon called marriage and
[1:07:47] divorce.
[1:07:48] And so
[1:07:50] we know that in the beginning God
[1:07:54] created the heaven and earth. Is that
[1:07:56] correct?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; In the beginning. And and as he formed
[1:08:00] the earth, he separated the earth and he
[1:08:03] separated light and darkness. And we
[1:08:06] understood right from the beginning that
[1:08:08] God was a separator. He always
[1:08:11] separates. He always separates light
[1:08:14] from dark. We know that he's doing that
[1:08:16] today. He's doing that this morning.
[1:08:20] There's some of you that are living in
[1:08:22] darkness and the wages of sin is death.
[1:08:24] And what God wants to do is separate you
[1:08:27] from that darkness and bring you into
[1:08:30] the light. So God uh he he he trying to
[1:08:34] deal uh with that because he wants to
[1:08:38] separate you from darkness. He wants to
[1:08:41] he's a separator from life and death.
[1:08:44] The wages of sin is death. The gift of
[1:08:47] God is eternal life. So we know that
[1:08:49] God's a separator. That's what he does.
[1:08:51] He's continually separating. He doesn't
[1:08:54] stop separating. What man thinks is that
[1:08:57] man made one separating decision. I I've
[1:09:00] separated from this. I'm done
[1:09:03] separating.
[1:09:04] Now I'm going to continue in my own way,
[1:09:07] my own thinking, my own judgments, my
[1:09:10] own way of doing things. And they they
[1:09:12] they feel because they've made one
[1:09:14] separation that that's the end of it.
[1:09:18] No. Uh God continues to separate all the
[1:09:23] way from the day that he separates you
[1:09:26] from this mortal body and this mortal
[1:09:29] world. And so there's final separations
[1:09:33] and the great judgment of the separating
[1:09:36] and of the sheep and the goats will be
[1:09:39] the final separation. The final
[1:09:42] judgment. He says, "But until that day
[1:09:45] with before the church is caught up in
[1:09:47] the glory, there's going to be one more
[1:09:49] great separation and that's separating
[1:09:52] the sheep from the goats."
[1:09:55] And so we know that that separation
[1:09:59] is there. So in the beginning, God
[1:10:02] separated it. And then God created a
[1:10:06] son, Adam. Adam was the first son of
[1:10:10] God. He was a living soul and that's
[1:10:13] what he was. He was the son of God. And
[1:10:16] so we know we put him in a garden. And
[1:10:19] we know the story. We go back to the
[1:10:22] angels that that saw God's plan. And
[1:10:26] Lucifer looked and saw what God's plan
[1:10:30] for redemption was, what God's plan for
[1:10:34] a kingdom was, what God's plan for a
[1:10:37] people was.
[1:10:40] The kind of nature that he wanted th
[1:10:43] that people to have, the kind of spirit
[1:10:46] he wanted those people to be in, the
[1:10:49] kind of personality that he wanted them
[1:10:51] to have, their nature, their life, their
[1:10:54] heart's desire, their mind, their
[1:10:56] thinking. And Lucifer saw that and
[1:10:59] thought, "What a waste."
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? He said, "No." So
[1:11:06] he he he
[1:11:09] deceived
[1:11:10] threearters of the heaven. God knowing
[1:11:14] all allowing all this we won't go there
[1:11:17] because he felt that he could build a
[1:11:21] better kingdom.
[1:11:23] In other words, God wasn't going to use
[1:11:25] mathematics.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Yet every star, every molecule is the
[1:11:29] most fabulous mathematical
[1:11:32] genius that you would ever see.
[1:11:36] You could find God in mathematics.
[1:11:38] Einstein found God in mathematics.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And and and and
[1:11:46] God wasn't going to use science.
[1:11:50] You know what I mean? And yet there was
[1:11:52] so much science there that Satan knew
[1:11:55] how things work, what chemicals will do.
[1:11:58] Uh you you remember he he was a a great
[1:12:01] angel. He, you know, and God wasn't
[1:12:04] going to use that and he wasn't going to
[1:12:07] use any of these things. He he wasn't
[1:12:09] going to have a civilization
[1:12:11] here. And Satan thought, you built all
[1:12:14] this sky, you built all this great
[1:12:16] thing, you put this great earth there,
[1:12:17] you have all these me chemicals in it,
[1:12:20] you have all this knowledge, you have
[1:12:21] all this math, you have all this
[1:12:24] science, and you're not going to use any
[1:12:26] of it. What a waste,
[1:12:31] you know, because
[1:12:34] he he knew that if man done those things
[1:12:36] that they could become like gods,
[1:12:40] but it wasn't what was in God's heart.
[1:12:44] Wasn't what God wanted to be.
[1:12:47] He He didn't want to be a scientist.
[1:12:51] God didn't didn't want to build a
[1:12:54] civilization. God wanted to be a father.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that how do we pray? He
[1:13:02] didn't say our our scientist,
[1:13:05] you know, our our great cultural
[1:13:09] thing. He said our father. And so Satan
[1:13:13] left that.
[1:13:17] And he decided and was cast out.
[1:13:22] And then he found his way back into the
[1:13:24] Garden of Eden.
[1:13:26] And we know that
[1:13:29] Satan now is the father of lies.
[1:13:35] He's the father of all lies. He's a
[1:13:37] liar.
[1:13:39] Okay? So if it comes from Satan's mouth,
[1:13:43] it's a lie,
[1:13:46] you know. And I'm not going to throw all
[1:13:49] attorneys under the bus. That's what
[1:13:51] they say about a lawyer. How do you know
[1:13:53] if a lawyer's lying if he moves his
[1:13:55] lips? Well, that doesn't apply to
[1:13:58] lawyers. It only applies to one person,
[1:14:01] and that's the father of lies. Because
[1:14:03] there's no truth in them. The reason
[1:14:06] there's no truth in Satan, he still
[1:14:09] believes his own deception.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He still believes he can rule.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; He still believes he's going to have a
[1:14:18] kingdom. He still believes he's going to
[1:14:21] exalt himself and sit on the throne that
[1:14:24] he felt belonged to him.
[1:14:27] And when God chose to manifest himself
[1:14:31] in a simple Galilean by the name of the
[1:14:34] Lord Jesus Christ, he thought that was
[1:14:37] absurdity.
[1:14:39] But God had a plan. And Satan never
[1:14:42] could understand that part of God's plan
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; because God was gonna reveal it himself.
[1:14:52] And so we know that that Satan was the
[1:14:56] father of
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; all lies.
[1:15:01] And you are the result of the first lie.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Now you say,
[1:15:12] Not me. Uhhuh.
[1:15:16] You
[1:15:19] you in this
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; is a result of a lie.
[1:15:26] The scripture expressed it this way. We
[1:15:28] are all born in sin,
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; shaped in iniquity,
[1:15:36] and came into the world
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; speaking lies.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:15:45] Why would somebody come into the world,
[1:15:50] just a child,
[1:15:54] no reason for nothing, and you say,
[1:15:58] "Johnny, did you get in the cookie jar?"
[1:16:02] And he'll be holding a cookie.
[1:16:05] He's got chocolate chips all running
[1:16:08] down his face. He's got crumbs on. No,
[1:16:12] not me. I'm not didn't get in the cookie
[1:16:14] jar.
[1:16:17] And he
[1:16:20] having no knowledge of even what a lie
[1:16:23] is, he speaks a lie. You say, "Well, he
[1:16:27] came into the world speaking lies." He
[1:16:30] came into the world speaking lies
[1:16:32] because that's the nature he received of
[1:16:37] the father of lies.
[1:16:41] And we know going in that the reason for
[1:16:44] that was is because of serpent seed and
[1:16:47] that lie and that act that brought us
[1:16:51] all into the world. We received the
[1:16:54] nature of that lie.
[1:16:58] You understand that? the nature that
[1:17:01] that we received that that uh that that
[1:17:07] lie uh uh uh well we are a result of
[1:17:12] that lie and and uh and what does a lie
[1:17:16] do? A lie withholds the truth.
[1:17:21] We could say it's a perversion of the
[1:17:23] truth, but it wi withholds the truth.
[1:17:27] The lie withholds the truth. And when
[1:17:30] Satan got Eve and interjected that lie,
[1:17:35] now the truth was withheld from
[1:17:38] everybody.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; And the truth didn't show back up until
[1:17:45] it was prophesied to show up. And one
[1:17:48] came on the scene and said, "I am the
[1:17:50] way, the truth, the life.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; No man comes to the father but by me.
[1:17:58] And so because of that lie uh we all got
[1:18:03] an earthly father
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; and the nature of sin.
[1:18:11] So we're born with this nature.
[1:18:14] And so like I was fellowship with Gary,
[1:18:16] brother Orlando, a few of the brothers.
[1:18:19] So and we were talking and so the
[1:18:23] we we were born to our natural fathers.
[1:18:26] Now, I didn't pick my parents.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; You You know what I mean? I mean, if I
[1:18:33] if I would have looked over the catalog
[1:18:36] of parents and they could have picked a
[1:18:39] parent, I would have looked down and,
[1:18:41] you know, I think probably uh uh you
[1:18:44] know, great names were would come up,
[1:18:47] you know, uh maybe uh very wealthy
[1:18:51] people and that lived in really great
[1:18:54] places. But I didn't pick my parents.
[1:18:58] God picked them.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; But I didn't know that
[1:19:04] that the lie hid that from me. The lie
[1:19:08] hides the truth. And so we we we grew up
[1:19:13] uh visiting with brother Gary. I said,
[1:19:15] "Gary, you I think that Gary was born
[1:19:18] somewhere in Texas here. I I know his
[1:19:21] parents live in Weatherford now. I don't
[1:19:23] know what much about before, but uh but
[1:19:26] his dad was a mechanic, a a good
[1:19:29] hardworking fella and and he chose where
[1:19:32] Gary lived.
[1:19:34] He taught Gary what food to eat because
[1:19:39] he put it on the table. And yet when
[1:19:42] you're hungry and you eat something,
[1:19:46] the memory of the satisfaction of that
[1:19:50] hunger becomes a part of you. If if you
[1:19:54] wanted scientific and understanding,
[1:19:56] it's an endorphin.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; It's a something your body generates to
[1:20:02] cause good feelings. And that's what
[1:20:06] people do. They they they they get
[1:20:08] addicted to the endorphine. They get
[1:20:11] addicted to that that chemical that is
[1:20:15] created. So they go through certain
[1:20:17] actions that create that chemical. So
[1:20:20] they can get that feeling and it leads
[1:20:22] to drug addiction. It leads to sexual
[1:20:24] addiction. It leads to uh uh alcoholism.
[1:20:28] It leads to a lot of things. It it's
[1:20:31] created there. It's part of the lie.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; So we found out that that we were born.
[1:20:38] And so he Gary became what he did
[1:20:40] because his father taught him maybe
[1:20:43] certain pizza or certain food or certain
[1:20:46] way to drink coffee. You know these all
[1:20:49] these different ways that were
[1:20:51] presented. You know I go in places and
[1:20:54] people like hot stuff. They like bitter
[1:20:56] stuff, sour stuff. And I thought, how
[1:20:59] how in the world did you ever get a
[1:21:00] taste of that? Well, when they were
[1:21:02] sitting at the table starved
[1:21:05] and mama stuck some sour old junk in in
[1:21:09] their mouth, to them it was like,
[1:21:11] "Hallelujah.
[1:21:14] This is great.
[1:21:16] This satisfies me." And they have a
[1:21:19] craving for it. They long for it. They
[1:21:22] They desire it. Okay, they're raised
[1:21:25] with it. So now they're being formed and
[1:21:29] molded by our earthly father or by our
[1:21:34] natural nature. We've got this nature.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; We've got it from our from it was passed
[1:21:41] down to us through genes through through
[1:21:44] uh being taught culture taught. It's not
[1:21:47] inherited. So you know my political
[1:21:51] views, my work views, my work ethic was
[1:21:54] all taught to me by my father. What it
[1:21:57] meant to work, what it meant to do this,
[1:22:00] how how I thought. So much of that was
[1:22:03] taught to me by my earthly father
[1:22:07] and became. So I got that nature of my
[1:22:11] father, my natural father. We have that
[1:22:16] nature. We were born that with that
[1:22:19] nature. So we we came into our this life
[1:22:25] with that nature.
[1:22:28] And so but that is not our true nature.
[1:22:35] But that nature came from a seed.
[1:22:40] Do you understand that? It came from the
[1:22:42] natural seed of my father to the bedding
[1:22:45] ground of my mother.
[1:22:47] And through the design of of God's plan,
[1:22:52] it formed me. And because of that
[1:22:55] natural seed, I I was birthed to my
[1:22:59] father and my mother. And now they
[1:23:02] raised me. They brought me up in their
[1:23:05] values, their culture. I was raised a
[1:23:08] Catholic.
[1:23:10] That couldn't I didn't know anything. I
[1:23:15] was raised a Catholic,
[1:23:17] but I wasn't a Catholic,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; but I was raised one. I pursued it with
[1:23:26] everything that I had. I pursued being a
[1:23:29] Catholic, even to the consideration of
[1:23:33] of being a priest, you know, I I thought
[1:23:36] that was the way to go. And so I pursued
[1:23:40] the that
[1:23:43] nature, that natural part of me. But
[1:23:46] there but that wasn't who that if I
[1:23:53] could say that that's a nature I'm born
[1:23:55] with. But and that came from a seed.
[1:24:00] But remember, a lie
[1:24:04] hides the truth.
[1:24:09] And then when the gospel came,
[1:24:13] it was the revelation to you
[1:24:17] that you are not
[1:24:21] really
[1:24:24] stuck
[1:24:26] to that seed or nature.
[1:24:32] Okay?
[1:24:34] That's what Jesus said. I'm the truth.
[1:24:38] My sheep hear my voice
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; and another they will not follow.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; And so the reality was that not only did
[1:24:51] we have
[1:24:53] and were living by the seed
[1:24:57] of our parents in the natural realm of
[1:25:02] five senses.
[1:25:04] Unless you have some form of um I want
[1:25:09] to use a word uh I don't want to use the
[1:25:11] word defect. I don't want to use the
[1:25:13] word handicap. I maybe that one of your
[1:25:17] sensuses wasn't developed and maybe you
[1:25:20] only have four or five you and you make
[1:25:24] all the adaptions. That's not the point.
[1:25:26] The point is that those those
[1:25:30] inner emotions and their outer emotions
[1:25:33] all came from the flesh and they rule
[1:25:37] over you.
[1:25:40] Okay? So you're married to them
[1:25:45] without
[1:25:47] your knowledge.
[1:25:49] You you you you have a union with them.
[1:25:53] You're in union with them right off the
[1:25:55] bat. When you grew up, you were in union
[1:25:58] with a lie.
[1:26:00] If you mean, you were you were born a
[1:26:03] liar, right? You came into the world
[1:26:06] shaped in iniquity. You did things that
[1:26:09] weren't right. You were married to that
[1:26:12] nature. You're stuck with that nature.
[1:26:14] You were born with that nature. And that
[1:26:17] nature ruled over you.
[1:26:21] You were ruled by that nature. That
[1:26:23] nature had control of you. And then
[1:26:27] Jesus wanted to come and tell you that
[1:26:31] you have another seed in you.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; That was the original seed.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; That was the seed that God put there
[1:26:43] from the beginning. That seed is in you.
[1:26:47] So you say, "Well, am I two persons? my
[1:26:50] two personalities. No, you you you
[1:26:53] you're ruled
[1:26:55] by that nature.
[1:26:58] So you and that nature are one
[1:27:02] now.
[1:27:05] And
[1:27:06] by the laws, you're married to that. So
[1:27:09] I want you to understand that you're
[1:27:12] married to that nature. Whether you use
[1:27:14] I know people that are so sweet all the
[1:27:16] time, but if a certain thing happens and
[1:27:18] they get in a certain place, somebody
[1:27:21] plugs in the buzz saw,
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:26] you know, and then when they're all
[1:27:27] done, oh, I'm so sorry. You know what I
[1:27:31] mean? Oh, well,
[1:27:34] just the nature
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; you were married to that.
[1:27:40] But the gospel comes to let us know that
[1:27:44] that nature
[1:27:46] can die.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And so if you want to know what I would
[1:27:51] title my message this morning, it's
[1:27:54] called Faith in Your Death.
[1:28:00] Faith in your death.
[1:28:05] I hope you understand that
[1:28:08] because you've got to understand that
[1:28:12] that nature has died.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And if you're still battling the nature,
[1:28:20] then it's not dead yet. Now, you if
[1:28:24] you've killed a lot of the old man,
[1:28:27] don't stop until you kill all of it.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Okay? Now I want just to read some
[1:28:35] scriptures with you and then I'll close
[1:28:38] up uh here with you. So we just read
[1:28:44] Romans
[1:28:45] uh six and and and seven. He says,
[1:28:50] "Knowing this, knowing this, right, that
[1:28:55] our old man is crucified with him,
[1:29:00] that the body of sin might be destroyed,
[1:29:06] that henceforth we should not serve sin.
[1:29:10] For he that is dead is free from
[1:29:14] sin.
[1:29:16] So we have to have faith in our death.
[1:29:20] We we don't put a lot of times we talk
[1:29:22] about we fa we don't want to put our
[1:29:24] faith in in an evangelist. We don't want
[1:29:26] to put our faith in a church. We we
[1:29:30] don't want to be put our faith in what
[1:29:33] our eyes sees moving in a midst of the
[1:29:37] people. You have to have faith that you
[1:29:41] have died.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; You have got to know that some place in
[1:29:47] your life, your nature has made a
[1:29:51] change.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; You didn't add religion to your nature.
[1:29:56] You didn't add good works to the old
[1:29:59] man. It's not good works controlling the
[1:30:02] old man. That my brother who spent many
[1:30:05] years in aa Uh that was always our
[1:30:09] biggest argument is he he didn't believe
[1:30:12] an alcoholic could be healed.
[1:30:16] He believed he could be controlled.
[1:30:20] You know what I mean? That
[1:30:23] and people think, well, I can quit using
[1:30:26] drugs or I can quit doing this. I can
[1:30:29] quit any
[1:30:31] time that I want to. But that doesn't
[1:30:34] mean it's dead. It means it's under
[1:30:37] control.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; It's been caged up.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; And if it's caged up, it's continually
[1:30:45] trying to find a way to get out.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's going to want
[1:30:53] to kill you.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's like a death oath it takes
[1:31:00] when you close it up. I'm going when I
[1:31:03] get out of here, I'm going to get you.
[1:31:06] I'm coming for you. I'm I'm I'm going to
[1:31:09] I'm I'm going to get alive. He'll work
[1:31:11] long range plans. He'll do all kinds of
[1:31:14] things. He'll try to get you, but that
[1:31:16] he's caged up, but he's not dead.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; So, you you I hope you understand where
[1:31:22] I'm going. You've got to have faith in
[1:31:25] your death
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; that my heart no longer has a desire for
[1:31:34] these things.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; It's not I know it's wrong and I'm going
[1:31:39] to stay away from it. No, I I believe
[1:31:42] me, I I I don't have cigarette smoking
[1:31:46] caged up.
[1:31:49] I don't desire a smoke. You know, I I
[1:31:53] when I somebody lights up a cigar, I
[1:31:56] don't go.
[1:31:59] Oh, I can't smoke.
[1:32:01] Oh, I made up my mind. I wasn't going to
[1:32:04] smoke. I'm serving God. I'm just not
[1:32:06] going to smoke. No. When a cigar lights
[1:32:10] up and I go and the next thing I do is
[1:32:13] go,
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; sorry for the graphics.
[1:32:18] No, it makes me what? Sick.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; I have no desire for it.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; So I can say to you, cigarette smoking
[1:32:28] is dead to me.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Alcohol is dead to me.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? I don't want to
[1:32:37] drink.
[1:32:38] I just don't want to drink.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; It's not that. Can you drink? I suppose
[1:32:44] I could go through a long litany of
[1:32:46] scriptural research and probably come up
[1:32:48] with a dozen reasons why I could drink a
[1:32:50] little wine for my stomach. Say,
[1:32:52] "Everybody that ever has done that has
[1:32:55] always had a stomach ache ever since I
[1:32:57] met them."
[1:32:59] Their stomach just continually bothers
[1:33:02] them.
[1:33:03] Boy, I'm more my stomach. I tell you
[1:33:06] what, I got Oh, you going? Yeah. And
[1:33:10] before I eat this meal, I got to have a
[1:33:12] little wine for my stomach's sake. You
[1:33:14] know what I mean? Well, you know, if
[1:33:17] they ever got healed, the stomach, I
[1:33:19] guess the drinking would go right. So,
[1:33:22] but I have no desire to drink.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Now, that but those things are dead to
[1:33:29] me and I have faith that those things
[1:33:31] are dead. But there's still a lot of
[1:33:33] things that are trying to resurrect.
[1:33:39] Maybe not all my nature
[1:33:43] is killed.
[1:33:47] Maybe there's a lot more that I can go
[1:33:51] forward.
[1:33:54] So let's turn to Corinthian 2
[1:33:56] Corinthians 5:17.
[1:34:16] We Let's go back just to the 14th verse.
[1:34:26] Well, I got to read 13 because that's
[1:34:29] just my nature.
[1:34:31] I I read the Bible backwards.
[1:34:35] He says, "For whether we be beside
[1:34:38] ourselves, it is to God, or whether we
[1:34:42] be sober,
[1:34:44] it is for your cause." For the love of
[1:34:49] Christ constrained us,
[1:34:52] because we thus judge
[1:34:56] that if one died for all, then were all
[1:35:00] dead.
[1:35:03] and and that he died for all, that they
[1:35:09] which live should not henceforth live
[1:35:13] unto themselves,
[1:35:15] but unto him which died for them, and
[1:35:18] rose again.
[1:35:20] Wherefore henceforth know we no man
[1:35:24] after the flesh. Yay, though we know
[1:35:27] Christ after the flesh, we now
[1:35:31] henceforth know we him no more.
[1:35:36] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[1:35:40] is a new creature.
[1:35:44] Old things are passed away, and behold,
[1:35:47] all things are become new,
[1:35:51] and all things are of God, who hath
[1:35:55] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:35:58] Christ, and hath given to us the
[1:36:02] ministry of reconiliation.
[1:36:05] So we know that we we see here that if
[1:36:09] any man be in Christ, he is a new
[1:36:13] creature.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; So Paul just talks to us here about the
[1:36:17] death of the old man. This man is dead.
[1:36:22] All things become new to us. Now if you
[1:36:25] don't if you're not have confidence in
[1:36:28] that death and faith in the death, then
[1:36:31] then things can't become new to you.
[1:36:35] That's right.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Because this old you're afraid of your
[1:36:38] old nature.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; You You can't go on thinking, "Oh, I I'm
[1:36:43] afraid that this will pop up."
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; You know, if you're healed, you're not
[1:36:50] afraid it's going to pop up. You know,
[1:36:52] it's gone. You know it's dead.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; So, I'm talking about a nature.
[1:37:00] There's a nature that we got that we
[1:37:03] were married to and the only way we can
[1:37:06] be divorced from that nature is if it
[1:37:09] dies. There's not a rit of divorcement
[1:37:13] that you can give to them. That means
[1:37:16] that thing is still living but you are
[1:37:19] not participating in it. But we have got
[1:37:23] to build our faith on death.
[1:37:28] My Christian faith is built on death.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; I I I believe that he died
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; for my sins.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; That his death
[1:37:44] is what paid the price for my sins. I
[1:37:48] have to have faith in his death.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; His death was the payment for my sins.
[1:37:56] If I don't believe he died, then I don't
[1:37:59] believe he died for my sins, therefore
[1:38:01] my sins. That's what he said. If we know
[1:38:03] him after the flesh, then no more. You
[1:38:05] know, so we've got to understand that
[1:38:08] our faith is built on his death. And our
[1:38:12] life, our new man, our new creature, our
[1:38:16] new nature is based on his resurrection.
[1:38:19] Amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; So, you have to have faith in his death
[1:38:24] before you could have faith in the life
[1:38:27] of the resurrection coming into you.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; You've got to have faith that you're
[1:38:32] dead
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; and that you have a right
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; to the new life
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; to be a new creature
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; cuz the old creature's dead.
[1:38:47] that it's so fundamental, but it's
[1:38:50] something that's slipping away from the
[1:38:52] church and I'm going somewhere. So,
[1:38:54] let's just read Ephesians 4 and uh
[1:39:00] Ephesians 4 and 20.
[1:39:13] See if I
[1:39:16] had this right.
[1:39:26] He says, "But if ye have but ye have not
[1:39:30] so learned Christ,
[1:39:33] if so be that ye have heard him and and
[1:39:37] have been taught by him, as the truth is
[1:39:42] Jesus,
[1:39:44] that ye put off concerning the former
[1:39:47] conversations of the old man, which is
[1:39:51] corrupt,
[1:39:52] according to deceitfulness,
[1:39:58] and be and be renewed in the spirit of
[1:40:01] your mind, and that ye put
[1:40:05] on the new man,
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; which after God is created in the
[1:40:11] righteousness and holiness.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. that the old man is dead
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; and you put on the righteousness of the
[1:40:21] new man.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; You You understand what Satan's done?
[1:40:26] He's got in the middle of everything.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Then he's watered everything down. He's
[1:40:32] polluted everything. He's presenting all
[1:40:35] kinds of new stimulation,
[1:40:38] all kinds of new attractions, all kinds
[1:40:42] of things that are pleasing to the eye.
[1:40:45] If and they and we just read in the
[1:40:47] scripture, if you've heard him,
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; and everything's trying to move the
[1:40:53] visuals,
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; fantastics,
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; it's all becoming entertainment.
[1:41:07] And now our faith is starting to get
[1:41:09] built in our senses.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; On feelings
[1:41:16] and our faith should be in our death.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; I know that I died here.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; This is where I quit drinking.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; This is where I quit smoking. This is
[1:41:31] the day I threw it out the window and I
[1:41:33] never ever went back there today. I have
[1:41:36] total faith
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; that that was the end of it for me.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; You don't drive back by that spot and
[1:41:46] roll down your window and look up and
[1:41:48] say, "I wonder if it's still out there.
[1:41:51] It's been five years, but you know, I
[1:41:54] still have the memory of it."
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; No. by the renewing
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; of your mind. By the washing of the
[1:42:03] water of God's word,
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; you guys know I I I died. I have faith
[1:42:10] in my death.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; You've got to have faith
[1:42:15] in your death.
[1:42:17] We we read here uh we could go to uh
[1:42:21] second Corinthians back to Corinthians
[1:42:24] uh four and and uh 16.
[1:42:45] We'll go start with 14.
[1:42:50] Where we go? We might as well go to 12.
[1:42:55] So then death workketh in us, but life
[1:42:58] in you.
[1:43:00] We have the same spirit of faith,
[1:43:03] according is written, I believe, and
[1:43:06] therefore have I spoken. We also
[1:43:10] believe, therefore speak, knowing that
[1:43:13] he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[1:43:17] raise us up also by Christ Jesus, and
[1:43:22] shall present us with you. All for all
[1:43:27] things are for your sake,
[1:43:30] that the abundant grace might
[1:43:34] might through the thanksgiving of many
[1:43:38] rebound in the glory of God.
[1:43:41] For this cause we faint not, but our
[1:43:45] outward man perish,
[1:43:48] but the inward man is renewed day by
[1:43:52] day.
[1:43:54] the outward man perish. Now, we know
[1:43:57] Paul's in affliction. He's suffering.
[1:43:59] He's saying this outward man's dying.
[1:44:01] But this inward man,
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; he's got faith
[1:44:06] in what transpired in his life on that
[1:44:11] road to Damascus.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, Agria, I was not disobedient to the
[1:44:17] heavenly vision. I would that you would
[1:44:19] be even as I. Now he's suffering
[1:44:25] for
[1:44:27] his death and then he can start making s
[1:44:30] statements like if we suffer with him
[1:44:33] will reign with him.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; He's he's confident. He knows his
[1:44:38] experience. He's knows his calling. He
[1:44:40] has faith in his death.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; And I I wonder if we really started
[1:44:46] getting real because we really want to
[1:44:48] go forward, don't we? We want to get
[1:44:50] back. God provided a way for every
[1:44:53] believer to meet him. And that's under
[1:44:55] the shed blood. The shed blood is death.
[1:45:00] [Music]
[1:45:09] man died,
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; showing us that this fleshly body and
[1:45:15] the nature that came with it can also
[1:45:19] die
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; and that a new creature can be
[1:45:23] resurrected in Christ Jesus. All things
[1:45:26] become new.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; All old things have passed away
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; and all things become new.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how can they become
[1:45:37] new?" because the other thing has passed
[1:45:40] away. It's died.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; We've got that. Let's just read a last
[1:45:45] scripture, then I'll close.
[1:45:48] We're just laying this down as some
[1:45:50] seed. Galatians 5 and 24.
[1:46:23] And they that are Christ have crucified
[1:46:26] the flesh with the affle afflictions
[1:46:31] afflictions and lust. For if we live in
[1:46:34] the spirit, let us also walk in the
[1:46:37] spirit.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Once again is the reference
[1:46:45] to
[1:46:47] death.
[1:46:48] Faith in your death.
[1:46:56] You've got to have faith
[1:46:59] that that old nature
[1:47:02] has died.
[1:47:05] Now, I just going to make a transition
[1:47:07] here and just be honest with you.
[1:47:11] When I first came into the message,
[1:47:15] almost everybody that was in the message
[1:47:17] had come out of Pentecost.
[1:47:23] They all spoke in tongues.
[1:47:27] They all
[1:47:29] had great emotional movements of the
[1:47:32] spirit. They all felt that tongues was
[1:47:35] the evidence of the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:39] They they had different ideas of
[1:47:42] baptism.
[1:47:44] uh but they all basically felt that the
[1:47:48] evidence of the Holy Spirit was a
[1:47:51] sensation.
[1:47:54] That's how they judged it. Therefore,
[1:47:58] they used whatever method they could use
[1:48:02] to create that sensation.
[1:48:06] Music started to become a big part of
[1:48:08] it. certain songs emotions were done in
[1:48:13] a lot of different ways. Some of it was
[1:48:16] creating the the tear.
[1:48:20] You know,
[1:48:21] my mama
[1:48:24] said to me,
[1:48:26] "Son, is on her deathbed. You take this
[1:48:30] gospel to the lost.
[1:48:33] Mama,
[1:48:35] I've never let you down."
[1:48:39] Why? you're already emotional.
[1:48:41] You're getting sucked right in.
[1:48:45] They worked on emotion
[1:48:49] and then they started using
[1:48:52] greater songs to create joy and emotion.
[1:48:57] But they were always driving to a
[1:49:01] feeling,
[1:49:02] to a sensation,
[1:49:04] something that their senses
[1:49:08] that the old man could attach to.
[1:49:13] But if that old man is dead,
[1:49:17] it can attach to that.
[1:49:20] So if the seed of your first father, the
[1:49:25] one that brought you here is dead, the
[1:49:28] only seed that remains should be the
[1:49:31] rece seed of your heavenly father. Now
[1:49:34] once this one is dead, this one can now
[1:49:38] live
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; and it's got to grow. So everybody came
[1:49:44] out of Pentecost and there was
[1:49:46] excitement in one way and nobody wanted
[1:49:50] to be a part of it because they knew it
[1:49:52] was based on sensation.
[1:49:55] So they were hungry for what that he
[1:49:58] taught
[1:50:00] because there was a stark evidence.
[1:50:03] Brother Van didn't run from one end of
[1:50:06] the stage and I'm not against the guys
[1:50:08] that want to run from the stage. I'm
[1:50:10] jealous. you you know what I mean? And I
[1:50:13] maybe covered a little more ground in my
[1:50:15] younger years, but that's not my point.
[1:50:19] But my point was it was driven by the
[1:50:22] sensation.
[1:50:25] And so none of the brothers that I came
[1:50:28] out with, none of them they they didn't
[1:50:29] want to lean that way because they
[1:50:33] leaned to the example that they had. Be
[1:50:35] ye followers of me as I am of Christ.
[1:50:39] They were very conscious because they
[1:50:42] sat there and we watched it in the
[1:50:44] meeting the other day on the tape and
[1:50:47] you'll see it again tonight. The
[1:50:49] mannerism and the spirit here is God in
[1:50:53] his the most powerful anointing that's
[1:50:56] been on the earth since the days of the
[1:50:58] Lord Jesus Christ just standing there.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, I see you. You've got
[1:51:05] heart trouble."
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I I I see a black sheep.
[1:51:10] It's a lie.
[1:51:13] Somebody's told a lie on you and it
[1:51:16] stirred up your church and your pastors
[1:51:18] got polio. They said you were a witch.
[1:51:27] Nobody jumped out.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Nobody come flying out. Didn't you see
[1:51:33] anybody come flying out of the seats?
[1:51:39] No, everybody was in shock,
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; you know, because what they knew. If he
[1:51:45] knows that about
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; her,
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; what does he know about me?
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Remember we read that quote
[1:51:54] out of in his presence, he said there
[1:51:57] would be such a holy hush on the
[1:51:59] audience that people would get out of
[1:52:01] the prayer line and come to the altar
[1:52:03] and make things right.
[1:52:06] I just wanted you to see the mannerism
[1:52:09] in which the word of God was being
[1:52:13] presented.
[1:52:15] Now, I can't duplicate that. Nobody can
[1:52:18] duplicate that. You've got to be
[1:52:20] yourself.
[1:52:22] So, when when it came out, but then what
[1:52:25] happened is is the message began to
[1:52:28] spread.
[1:52:31] younger people that weren't in the
[1:52:33] meetings
[1:52:35] came out of Pentecost
[1:52:38] and they brought their Pentecostal style
[1:52:40] of preaching
[1:52:42] to the church
[1:52:47] and the people were attracted to it.
[1:52:52] They had that way of emotion.
[1:52:56] They had more word to study
[1:52:59] and they begin to do it and they begin
[1:53:02] to create
[1:53:05] something that's very obvious to me that
[1:53:08] they would read a quote
[1:53:11] with emotion
[1:53:13] and the people would respond.
[1:53:19] But yet you could read the quote
[1:53:23] or play the quote. Yeah.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Nobody jumped out of their seats.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Nobody came down and stood up in front
[1:53:30] of you and went.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; They didn't do it.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; You notice I came down out of the Just
[1:53:49] wanted to let you know it killed me, but
[1:53:52] I made it.
[1:53:57] A new thing started to rise up.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; A new group of ministers came in. They
[1:54:03] were out of Pentecost. They brought
[1:54:06] their Pentecostal style with them. It's
[1:54:08] all they knew. I'm not against it. It's
[1:54:09] great.
[1:54:11] But the people weren't responding to the
[1:54:13] word.
[1:54:15] You could play the quote.
[1:54:18] I want you to be aware of this because I
[1:54:20] want you to totally understand as a
[1:54:22] pastor, you don't have to sit under this
[1:54:25] ministry.
[1:54:28] We got enough preachers in here, they
[1:54:29] can go start their own thing.
[1:54:34] But I want you to know for clear
[1:54:38] the way
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; and and the response was more towards
[1:54:44] the emotion than towards the word
[1:54:46] towards the feeling because that's what
[1:54:48] our nature is given to.
[1:54:54] And so then another generation came
[1:54:59] of ministry rose up and they saw the
[1:55:03] result of this style of preaching and
[1:55:07] they all began to take on this style of
[1:55:10] preaching and now it became a style
[1:55:14] and the style is promoted greater than
[1:55:18] the word.
[1:55:21] Watch this style of preaching. will show
[1:55:23] you the style of preaching. This style
[1:55:25] of preaching. This style of preaching.
[1:55:27] Now, you you can't have my style of
[1:55:30] preaching out because I bore you to
[1:55:32] death.
[1:55:36] And I and I don't want to be
[1:55:37] entertaining.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; What I want to leave you with is the
[1:55:42] truth.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Then a whole another group of guys and
[1:55:47] they're and now they're they're all
[1:55:49] imitating the other style.
[1:55:54] And how far is it going to get away if
[1:55:57] we keep going on?
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; So that's why we played those things.
[1:56:07] And I'm going to read a statement so you
[1:56:10] understand that what I'm seeing I'm
[1:56:13] seeing us getting farther and farther
[1:56:16] away
[1:56:18] from
[1:56:19] what
[1:56:21] was presented to us in the nature
[1:56:26] in the personality
[1:56:28] in the approach
[1:56:31] and the mental thinking of our messenger
[1:56:34] to the church.
[1:56:37] That's why that we play tapes
[1:56:41] is so that you can hear his message.
[1:56:44] You can sense his manner. You can see
[1:56:48] his emphasis.
[1:56:50] You can be identified.
[1:56:54] Now I want you to see the importance of
[1:56:57] why it's important to identify
[1:57:01] with
[1:57:03] the mannerism
[1:57:05] in which God presented himself
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to read
[1:57:14] a quotation. You can put it on the
[1:57:15] board, brother.
[1:57:18] Well, it's all I I don't have a quote a
[1:57:22] paragraph in the book I'm using but it's
[1:57:25] out of the rising of the sun
[1:57:31] and you know brother Bram talks about
[1:57:33] who is the son of man in the beginning
[1:57:36] was the word and the word was with God
[1:57:39] and the word was God and the w word was
[1:57:42] made flesh and dwelt among us and all of
[1:57:45] the teachings that we have
[1:57:48] we have and confirmation of the word of
[1:57:52] God by the word of God by signs and
[1:57:55] wonders. We see today in the book of
[1:57:59] Luke here that we quoted Luke 17:30
[1:58:04] uh 17:30 and Malachi 4 and the different
[1:58:09] scriptures that we are acquainted with
[1:58:12] that the word again is waved over the
[1:58:15] people that the dead traditions of man
[1:58:20] and the son of God is alive again with
[1:58:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost among
[1:58:26] amongst us and is given us life
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; as Christ was the first one to raise
[1:58:38] from all the prophets and so forth
[1:58:44] all through types in many places. He was
[1:58:48] the first fruit of those who slept
[1:58:52] in the bride coming of Christ coming out
[1:58:56] of the church.
[1:58:58] There will have to be a sheath wave
[1:59:01] again in the last days. Oh my. You know,
[1:59:05] a lot of people talk about the bride
[1:59:07] coming of Christ, but they left out the
[1:59:09] sheath wave.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; They left out the sheath wave. Now hear
[1:59:17] this. You hear a lot the bright coming
[1:59:19] of Christ.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Read it all.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; The bride coming of Christ was based on
[1:59:33] a sheath offering.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Based on a sheath offering. Let's
[1:59:41] continue to read
[1:59:43] so you understand. I'm not against the
[1:59:46] shouting.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not against the emotional preaching.
[1:59:51] I'm against you grabbing on to it and
[1:59:55] having faith in it and not having faith
[1:59:57] in your death.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; It's not a substitute for you dying.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Now, if you're happy that you're dead,
[2:00:11] then I'm with you.
[2:00:14] If you're happy, if you're dead, let
[2:00:16] them know. If you're happy and you're
[2:00:18] dead, let them know. I'm so happy that
[2:00:21] I'm dead. I'm so happy that I'm dead.
[2:00:24] I'm going to go to heaven instead.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; I ought to get that song I wrote the
[2:00:32] other day, Sister Rebecca. Right. You
[2:00:34] got that?
[2:00:36] All right.
[2:00:37] He says, "As Christ was the first one to
[2:00:40] raise from all the prophets, two types
[2:00:42] and places, he was the first fruit of
[2:00:45] those that slept. In the bride coming of
[2:00:47] Christ, the coming out of the church,
[2:00:49] there'll have to be a sheath wave again
[2:00:52] in the last days." Oh my. Waving of the
[2:00:56] sheath. What was the sheath?
[2:01:01] The first one to come to maturity.
[2:01:04] The first one that proved it was a wheat
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; that proved it was a sheath. Hallelujah.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you see what I'm talking about.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; It was waved over the people. And the
[2:01:22] first time there will come forth for a
[2:01:25] bride age for a resurrection out of the
[2:01:29] dark denominationalism
[2:01:31] will be a message.
[2:01:33] that the full ministry of the word has
[2:01:37] turned back again into its full
[2:01:43] full power and being waved over the
[2:01:47] people by the same signs and wonders he
[2:01:51] did back there. Because I live, ye live
[2:01:56] also. Speaking to his wife,
[2:02:03] Because I live, ye live also.
[2:02:07] What a resurrection that was. What a
[2:02:10] resurrection this is. To be quickened
[2:02:13] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[2:02:17] by God's quickening power. He was waved
[2:02:21] to
[2:02:22] waved to them. The word which he was was
[2:02:27] waved back to them on the day of
[2:02:30] Pentecost. The word made manifest and as
[2:02:34] I said it is to be waved again in the
[2:02:38] last day.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; So now the resurrection life and all
[2:02:43] that was based on the sheath offering
[2:02:47] which was what? the first one to come to
[2:02:50] maturity, letting everybody else know
[2:02:54] we're going to come to that maturity.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Now, you can't bypass the maturity.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; You can't bypass the ripening of the
[2:03:07] sun.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; And then you know what? He goes into the
[2:03:11] very next thing he talks about the
[2:03:13] Cadillac, the automobile because the
[2:03:15] sheath offering was the spark to the
[2:03:19] gasoline.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a a Holy Ghost anointed
[2:03:24] baptism because the prophet of God
[2:03:27] taught the mystery of this age was to
[2:03:30] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:32] without a sensation.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; What was it?
[2:03:39] It was the revelation of your death
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; and that a new seed,
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; the seed of your father,
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; the seed that he put there before the
[2:03:53] beginning of time, had the power within
[2:03:58] itself by the germination of the spark,
[2:04:02] the sheath offering to bring itself into
[2:04:05] what it was predestinated to be.
[2:04:12] You know what the sheath offering was
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; it was the manifestation of you.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; It was showing you what you were because
[2:04:28] he was the first son
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; to come to maturity.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; And we're leaving that out.
[2:04:38] We're removing that from our gospel.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; We're removing his voice.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; We're removing his example. We're
[2:04:46] removing his mannerism. We're removing
[2:04:48] his conduct. And we're substituting it
[2:04:51] back with the emotions of Pentecost.
[2:04:56] You can have it.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not going there.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; There's death in the pot.
[2:05:09] You have the sheep offering waved over
[2:05:12] you.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not that guy.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; No preachers that guy. No style of
[2:05:19] preaching.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; No songs, nothing. It's fine. Deal with
[2:05:25] the emotion part, but separate it. Have
[2:05:28] faith in your death.
[2:05:31] Don't let those things resurrect and old
[2:05:34] feelings and old emotional religion.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; I am who I am because he said so.
[2:05:51] were built on what he said
[2:05:56] and he we just read it in the last days
[2:05:59] the one that comes to maturity Malachi
[2:06:01] 4:5 who was this it was none other than
[2:06:04] the word
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; a human body flesh born in sin just like
[2:06:13] us having the word of God veiled in it
[2:06:17] and standing there it was the unveiling
[2:06:20] of God it It was the nature of the
[2:06:23] original seed being presented to you
[2:06:27] that you could sit there and see not,
[2:06:30] oh, that's what I should be. Oh, I'm so
[2:06:33] terrible. I'm not dead yet.
[2:06:37] But no, I can be.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; I may not do that work, but that's my
[2:06:44] nature.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; That's the way I think.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; That's the way I believe. That's the way
[2:06:51] I make my determinations on my
[2:06:54] decisions. That's the way I process
[2:06:56] information. That's my heart's desire.
[2:06:59] This is what I I I I am motivated to
[2:07:03] become because that's what God waved
[2:07:06] over me. He didn't wave Pentecost over
[2:07:09] me. He didn't wave all kinds of
[2:07:11] preaching. What he waved was the
[2:07:14] ministry of Malachi 4:5 and God's
[2:07:17] servant prophet William Mary and
[2:07:20] Brandham. And I say we need to go back
[2:07:22] to that.
[2:07:37] what he waved.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; He didn't wave a bunch of young
[2:07:42] evangelisms.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't wave a bunch of old pastors.
[2:07:49] He waved Malachi 4:5.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30,
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:7.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; That's what he waved.
[2:08:04] If you can hear me,
[2:08:06] you can hear him.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; You say, "Do you believe in press play?"
[2:08:13] Yes, sir. I believe in press play. The
[2:08:16] only thing they did is they added one
[2:08:18] word. They said, "Just."
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; And that's what Satan did in the
[2:08:24] beginning. He added what? One word.
[2:08:35] If we know we're dead,
[2:08:38] then we know we'll be risen with him.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; So if you know you've died
[2:08:46] when something else starts to pop up in
[2:08:48] your life, start killing it.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Start starving it.
[2:08:56] Be aware that sin creates sin for a
[2:09:01] season brings pleasure.
[2:09:04] I don't want to sound like a
[2:09:05] psychiatrist or a psychologist, but it's
[2:09:08] a known fact that it's the endorphins
[2:09:14] that sometimes that sensation of fear or
[2:09:18] that sensation of challenge. You know,
[2:09:21] why does a guy go down the highway 110
[2:09:23] miles an hour miles an hour on his back
[2:09:27] tire?
[2:09:29] I'm more afraid than he is.
[2:09:32] I get a real rush when he goes by me.
[2:09:38] But it's it's creating a sensation
[2:09:42] in him that he's hungering for. And
[2:09:46] pretty soon certain music, certain
[2:09:48] songs, you start attaching to the song.
[2:09:54] I I'm going to finish this morning.
[2:09:57] You go back to the 40s and the 50s and
[2:10:00] you watch anybody who sang, they all
[2:10:04] stood at the microphone.
[2:10:06] They were what we called kuners, right?
[2:10:09] Frank Sinatra,
[2:10:19] right? No, the big band, you know, they
[2:10:23] were all there.
[2:10:25] You might say, "Oh, you're preaching
[2:10:26] awful carnal." No, I'm talking to the
[2:10:28] carnal.
[2:10:30] Remember,
[2:10:32] the carnal mind is immity with God,
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; but the spiritual mind is life. They all
[2:10:38] stood there.
[2:10:43] You know when that all changed?
[2:10:46] When Alvis Presley
[2:10:50] started coming, he went to Congo and he
[2:10:54] learned how to dance.
[2:10:56] And then he brought it back and put it
[2:10:58] on the American stage, you know, doing
[2:11:02] all his stuff and
[2:11:08] And
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; everybody ate it up
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; and it all went wild
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; and it's been going wild
[2:11:18] ever since
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; and now you got I guess they call them
[2:11:22] headbangers and all this you know it
[2:11:26] wasn't way it was
[2:11:29] no he just keeps getting more
[2:11:31] sensational and more attracted to
[2:11:34] emotion and more attracted to sensation.
[2:11:38] So if God didn't give us an example,
[2:11:42] we would have been taken all over the
[2:11:44] place.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; So we know that we've got to be divorced
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; from our first nature.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can be divorced
[2:11:58] is for it to die.
[2:12:03] You can't write it a divorce.
[2:12:06] It's got to die.
[2:12:09] Now, he wrote the church
[2:12:13] world a divorcement.
[2:12:16] He indicted them. He told them, "You
[2:12:18] don't represent me. You don't stand for
[2:12:22] me. You don't preach what I preach. You
[2:12:25] don't resent ex resent me in any way. It
[2:12:30] ain't a rock concert.
[2:12:32] We go to our meetings now, they're
[2:12:34] fullfledged all blowing on
[2:12:38] rock concerts,
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Christian rock concerts.
[2:12:45] It's nothing to do. He's divorced it.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; He's put it away. He's not has any part
[2:12:53] of it.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; He's not even in there. He's on the
[2:12:57] outside
[2:12:59] trying to get back in.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; But at least we know his sheep, my
[2:13:04] sheep, hear my voice.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; So what was the voice to us in the last
[2:13:09] day? What did God give us? He gave us a
[2:13:12] sheath offering. He put a ministry that
[2:13:16] he promised in the word to be there so
[2:13:19] we could look,
[2:13:21] we could hear, and we could know
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; that this was him.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; This is out, brother Mike. This is out
[2:13:35] of marriage and divorce.
[2:13:37] Um,
[2:13:40] paragraph 258.
[2:13:53] I better not go there. I'd open another.
[2:13:54] Let's just start with 258.
[2:13:58] He says,
[2:14:01] so
[2:14:02] he's talking, if we just to lay it, he's
[2:14:04] talking about in the Bible, people that
[2:14:07] refuse to receive the the seed of their
[2:14:10] husband, how that they were put away. It
[2:14:13] says, but we don't aren't going that
[2:14:15] way. He says, "So, so is it with the
[2:14:19] church that refuses to become
[2:14:22] pregnantated in the age that we now live
[2:14:28] in?"
[2:14:32] Now, you keep, we all talk about being
[2:14:34] impregnated with the word, but he's
[2:14:37] wanting to let you know something. He's
[2:14:39] talking about you got to be impregnated
[2:14:41] with the age
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; you're living in.
[2:14:46] The word for the age,
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; he said through the age that we now live
[2:14:56] in to bring forth children of
[2:15:00] this age.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; How do we know what the children of this
[2:15:08] age looks like?
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; He was waved in front of us.
[2:15:14] Yes, sir.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; This is what he looks like.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; This is what he acts like.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; This is how he talks. This listen to
[2:15:23] this quote closely.
[2:15:28] And believe me, this sermon this morning
[2:15:30] is going to get a lot of push back,
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; but I don't care.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; I have faith in my death.
[2:15:43] If I have faith in my death, I have
[2:15:45] faith in my resurrection.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "In the age that we now live
[2:15:53] and to bring forth children of this age,
[2:15:56] we are not Lutheran.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; We are not Wesley's.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Neither are we Pentecostals.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; We've got to be the children of this
[2:16:11] age.
[2:16:14] through the pregnancy of the word of God
[2:16:18] to bring forth a child of this
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; age.
[2:16:27] I I wanted to lay down the age, you
[2:16:30] understand? So you don't get confused.
[2:16:33] It's not Christianity.
[2:16:40] This is different.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; This is a different crop,
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; a different seed.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; We've died to the old man.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; We've died to that other nature. Now,
[2:16:56] our father's seed
[2:16:58] is coming to maturity.
[2:17:02] one was matured in front of us that we
[2:17:05] know that we're that's where we're
[2:17:07] going.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; We fight off the bugs. We fight off the
[2:17:12] pestilence. We fight off the drought.
[2:17:14] And we keep growing. We keep growing.
[2:17:16] Amen.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; To bring forth a child of the age, the
[2:17:21] seed child,
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; not our father, natural seed child, but
[2:17:29] the seed child, the other seed, the real
[2:17:33] us. We've died to the father, our
[2:17:36] natural father that taught us everything
[2:17:39] that we are. Gave us our personality,
[2:17:41] gave us our nature, gave us our food,
[2:17:44] gave us our clothes style, gave us our
[2:17:46] skin color, gave us our nose, gave us
[2:17:48] our eyes. We're dead to that.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a new seed.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Our father's seed. It doesn't matter
[2:17:58] what the ground is. It's the seed that's
[2:18:01] important.
[2:18:04] Now that seed is coming to maturity.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; What sparks that life and brings it to
[2:18:10] life was the wave offering.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; That's what brought it to life. And
[2:18:15] every single one of us, those that were
[2:18:18] in Pentecost when his ministry came,
[2:18:21] they came out. They started coming out.
[2:18:23] We don't want to go back.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Honest. You've got to have faith in your
[2:18:34] death.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; The seed child. Amen. I hope you
[2:18:45] understand. Couldn't be pregnant. No. So
[2:18:49] what did he do? He put her away in
[2:18:51] divorcement. That's right. But see,
[2:18:54] Dareth put him away. He put her away. He
[2:18:58] went right on revealing his word to the
[2:19:01] body and vindicating him
[2:19:05] same by himself.
[2:19:12] He did it by himself.
[2:19:15] How was he? What was he doing it by?
[2:19:20] you know Malachi 4:5
[2:19:25] vindicating him saying by himself his
[2:19:28] children begin to kind of look more like
[2:19:32] him
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; because it's fully maturing
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; or they become children of the word not
[2:19:42] children of the church
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; children of the word and the bride will
[2:19:47] be a lovely little lady of the word,
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; unadulterated,
[2:19:53] not touched by any man's organization,
[2:19:56] any man-made theory. She'll be pure,
[2:20:00] unadulterated,
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; bride of the word. Amen. Amen. I hope
[2:20:06] you get that out on the air. She will be
[2:20:10] the pregnant daughter of God.
[2:20:19] What pregnant her?
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; What pregnant this whole age?
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; What pregnant the true church?
[2:20:30] It was that little man
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; that stood there and said, "You're not a
[2:20:35] witch."
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; That wasn't William Brandham.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; That was the bridegroom
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; veiled in flesh.
[2:20:47] proposing
[2:20:51] and finding his bride.
[2:20:58] We can't go forward without it.
[2:21:03] There's no substitute for it.
[2:21:06] No tremendous style of preaching. Paul
[2:21:09] said, 'I didn't come to you with
[2:21:10] enticing words,
[2:21:13] but I came to you with the power and the
[2:21:16] demonstration
[2:21:18] of the Holy Spirit.
[2:21:21] I didn't come to you
[2:21:23] with entertainment.
[2:21:28] And it's not entertainment.
[2:21:30] It's becoming entertainment.
[2:21:34] And if we don't face up to it,
[2:21:37] we don't call it exactly what it is
[2:21:42] and we don't say, "Wait a minute. We're
[2:21:45] not against people. We're not against
[2:21:47] churches. Anybody can worship the way
[2:21:49] that they want. If they don't want to
[2:21:52] play tapes, that's their business.
[2:21:55] If they want the gifts operating within
[2:21:58] their church, that's their business.
[2:22:02] You understand?
[2:22:04] But I've got to know what I've died to.
[2:22:11] And I have to know what has resurrected
[2:22:14] me in this word.
[2:22:18] And it's not a secondhand revelation.
[2:22:23] I don't know about brother Brandham
[2:22:26] because somebody told me about brother
[2:22:27] Brandham
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; or somebody told me what brother
[2:22:31] Brandham taught.
[2:22:33] or told me a story about brother
[2:22:36] Brandham.
[2:22:40] I know what brother Brandon taught
[2:22:42] because I listened to him.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; I heard testimonies of them from men
[2:22:52] that knew him that didn't know each
[2:22:54] other.
[2:22:56] I saw the effect of his life and his
[2:23:00] nature on men. And I saw the same effect
[2:23:04] of the people that sat in the presence
[2:23:07] of God and what it did to them and how
[2:23:11] that they were and the reverence they
[2:23:14] had to this message and the reverence
[2:23:18] they had to the absoluteness
[2:23:21] of this ministry.
[2:23:25] It it was phenomenal.
[2:23:28] And I see a great drift
[2:23:35] And you know, and so I I I I'm
[2:23:42] you know, we I guess we use that saying
[2:23:44] stuck between a rock and a hard place. I
[2:23:46] don't want you to have hard feelings
[2:23:48] towards anybody. I'm not trying to keep
[2:23:51] you away from anything. You can go to
[2:23:53] any meeting you feel led to go to. You
[2:23:56] can You got the internet. I've never
[2:23:58] told you not to listen to no preachers.
[2:24:01] You've got to do you have you can do all
[2:24:03] that you want.
[2:24:05] But don't pursue entertainment.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Don't forget really where the spark
[2:24:13] comes from. It doesn't come from music.
[2:24:17] It doesn't come from anointed preaching.
[2:24:21] It comes from the sheath offering. Amen.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; And if long as we can re keep those
[2:24:27] things, we can stay in balance,
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; you know, and if
[2:24:34] you know, I mean
[2:24:37] I've learned to live with the reproach,
[2:24:41] you know, I the reason I play tapes
[2:24:43] because I can't preach and you know and
[2:24:46] he ain't the preacher he used to be.
[2:24:49] Well, to be honest with you, I don't
[2:24:50] want to be the preacher I used to be.
[2:24:53] I hope I've grown up
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; a little bit. They refer to me as the
[2:24:59] ice cube preacher
[2:25:03] that I just want to pour water
[2:25:06] on the church.
[2:25:08] They say, "Oh, he doesn't allow the
[2:25:10] anointing
[2:25:12] in his church."
[2:25:16] Well,
[2:25:17] I do.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; When they said that, I said, "Amen.
[2:25:23] That's true.
[2:25:26] They don't allow the anointing because
[2:25:28] the anointing's on the tapes.
[2:25:32] But I want you to be aware that you
[2:25:34] personally
[2:25:37] have to have faith
[2:25:40] that you've come out of the world,
[2:25:44] that you've died,
[2:25:47] and that there's a seed in you that your
[2:25:51] original father.
[2:25:54] My father, Morton EMTT McGary, was not
[2:25:57] my original father.
[2:26:01] He was the method and means which God
[2:26:04] brought this body into the world. And he
[2:26:10] raised this body and taught this body to
[2:26:14] think and eat.
[2:26:16] But because my heavenly father had put
[2:26:20] another seed in me,
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; that seed had to be germinated
[2:26:27] because it was the seed of God.
[2:26:31] And that could only be
[2:26:34] pregnant or brought to life by the word
[2:26:38] of God. I wasn't born in Luther's age.
[2:26:42] If I was, Luther would have brought me
[2:26:46] to justification.
[2:26:48] I wasn't born in Wesley's age. If I was,
[2:26:53] Wesley would have brought me to
[2:26:55] sanctification.
[2:26:57] I wasn't born in the restoration of the
[2:26:59] gifts.
[2:27:01] If I was, the gifts would have been
[2:27:04] restored.
[2:27:06] And there's a big movement to recit the
[2:27:08] gifts back in the church, which fine.
[2:27:15] If you, some of you feel you have gifts
[2:27:17] and you want to get together, we'll put
[2:27:18] a night a week and you can come here and
[2:27:21] pray till the spirit of God comes on you
[2:27:23] and give your prophecy.
[2:27:26] And if it doesn't come to pass, you'll
[2:27:28] stand up in front of the church and
[2:27:29] confess that you had an evil spirit.
[2:27:33] That'll make sure you know your gift's
[2:27:35] real.
[2:27:38] But we're not that.
[2:27:41] We're the children of this age.
[2:27:46] Brought to life by the messenger of this
[2:27:49] age, by the word of God for this age.
[2:27:54] That's what
[2:27:58] why we're taking
[2:28:00] the path.
[2:28:03] is not anti- anything.
[2:28:08] I if you go to a meeting, I want you to
[2:28:10] have a good time. I want you to worship.
[2:28:12] I want you to rejoice. If you feel like
[2:28:15] running and shouting, running and shout,
[2:28:17] have a hallelujah.
[2:28:20] But just know
[2:28:22] that's what it is.
[2:28:25] But this
[2:28:27] is your life.
[2:28:30] You say, "Why didn't you hold up the
[2:28:32] Bible?" The same thing
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; just takes,
[2:28:38] you know, if you had Wesley here and you
[2:28:42] lined up the word with his message, you
[2:28:45] get sanctification.
[2:28:47] If you had Luther here, you get Luther.
[2:28:52] If you have the messenger for your age
[2:28:55] here, you'll become a child at this age.
[2:28:58] Amen.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; That's what keeps your target.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; That's what keeps you straight.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; So, I just want you to understand that
[2:29:08] and and see it that there's another seed
[2:29:12] in us.
[2:29:15] And that seed of our fathers dead and
[2:29:18] we're risen again in Christ Jesus, made
[2:29:21] new creatures by the word of God. So if
[2:29:25] the old guy is bugging you, kill him.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Tell him, "Wait a minute. I'm dead to
[2:29:31] you.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; You are a ghost.
[2:29:35] You are from the past.
[2:29:38] I'm not letting you in. I'm not opening
[2:29:41] the door for you. I have no part of you.
[2:29:44] I'm going to turn back to my father."
[2:29:48] If you've been prodal, go back to your
[2:29:51] father. But if you don't return to you
[2:29:54] can return to your first father and
[2:29:56] he'll take care of you. Which of you
[2:29:58] having a child that would ask a loaf of
[2:30:01] bread and would give him a serpent?
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; But you better find your heavenly father
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; because everybody that's of their
[2:30:10] earthly father dies.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Everybody that's at their heavenly
[2:30:14] father lives forever. So God bless you
[2:30:18] this morning. Think on these things.
[2:30:22] Meditate on these things.
[2:30:25] Don't be down on yourself.
[2:30:29] But look up and ask yourself, I believe.
[2:30:33] Let the life of Jesus Christ come into
[2:30:36] your heart. And let us become more like
[2:30:40] him. As we m mature, we become more like
[2:30:44] the sheath offering, more like the first
[2:30:47] fruit, more like the sun. Sen has been
[2:30:52] shining on us and we become more and
[2:30:55] more of a Christian. So, let's stand
[2:30:58] together. Musicians, come. It's a little
[2:31:01] late. It's 12:30. Um, again, this
[2:31:05] evening, you know what we're going to
[2:31:06] do. We hope you come out and enjoy it
[2:31:10] with us. We're looking and seeing the
[2:31:12] nature, the mannerism, and the first
[2:31:15] fruit and and and I believe tonight is
[2:31:20] our communion service. So, uh we'll
[2:31:23] we'll just it takes about an hour to
[2:31:25] play the film and then we'll have
[2:31:28] communion. So, is everybody good with
[2:31:30] that tonight? Okay. I hope you enjoy it.
[2:31:32] Did any do you enjoy Wednesday night?
[2:31:34] Those of you that were here, wasn't it
[2:31:36] nice? A man told us, he said, "You know,
[2:31:38] I never heard seen that and heard
[2:31:41] Brother Brandham with my own ears
[2:31:43] before." He said, "You played that just
[2:31:45] for me." He said, he sat there and wept
[2:31:48] the whole service. Cuz he finally
[2:31:51] learned English and he could hear it for
[2:31:53] himself and watch it
[2:31:56] and know that that was life and life
[2:31:58] amnet. If you don't know the Lord Jesus
[2:32:02] and you want to know the Lord Jesus,
[2:32:05] it's very simple.
[2:32:08] Just ask.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; And you shall receive.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's such a thing as life,
[2:32:15] eternal life, I'd like to experience it.
[2:32:21] If you know the way you're living's not
[2:32:23] right
[2:32:26] and you'd like that way to pass from
[2:32:29] you, you repent.
[2:32:32] Tell God you're sorry.
[2:32:34] Be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:32:36] Jesus Christ for the remission of those
[2:32:39] sins, the washing away of your past,
[2:32:44] and you'll be resurrected by the spirit
[2:32:46] of God in your life. You believe that?
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; I can you put those words up for me? Uh
[2:33:00] you you thank him for the cross.
[2:33:02] You thank him for his death
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; that you could die. Hallelujah. Are you
[2:33:08] glad you got eternal life?
[2:33:11] You should be know you should know
[2:33:12] you're full of eternal life. Oh, I I
[2:33:15] I've got faith that I've dead and I've
[2:33:18] risen with him. I'm so happy. Help me
[2:33:21] sing it.
