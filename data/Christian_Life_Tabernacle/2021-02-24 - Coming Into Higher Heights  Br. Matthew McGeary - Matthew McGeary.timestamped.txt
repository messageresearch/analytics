[39:47] day that will be
[39:48] well we're just thankful to be here in
[39:50] his presence let's just turn in our
[39:52] bibles to john
[39:54] chapter one
[40:04] it's nice to see so many out to the
[40:06] house have gone
[40:10] pray that the lord would just come and
[40:13] break the bread of life
[40:14] amen and we're just going to read
[40:19] john chapter 1 and
[40:22] such a beautiful chapter um
[40:29] maybe we'll just start at verse 35 it
[40:32] says again the next
[40:33] day after john stood and two of his
[40:36] disciples
[40:37] and looking upon jesus as he walked he
[40:40] saith
[40:40] behold the lamb of god
[40:44] as i just read that there in the back it
[40:45] struck me you know as as
[40:47] as the disciples received john's message
[40:50] introducing the lamb when you receive
[40:53] the message now you become
[40:55] a carrier of the message and what are we
[40:57] saying in this day
[40:58] behold the lamb we're introducing people
[41:01] none other than to jesus christ the same
[41:03] yesterday today and forever and the two
[41:06] disciples
[41:07] heard him speak and they followed jesus
[41:09] then jesus turned and saw them following
[41:12] and saith in him what seek ye
[41:14] they said unto him rabbi which is to say
[41:16] be an interpreted master
[41:17] where dwelleth thou he saith unto them
[41:20] come and see
[41:21] they came and they saw whether he dwelt
[41:24] and abode with him that day
[41:26] for it was about the tenth hour and
[41:28] you'll see that the disciples are going
[41:30] to repeat this
[41:30] jesus told them to come and see and
[41:32] you'll find out when the disciples go
[41:34] to their brothers and go to start
[41:35] witnessing they go they also say the
[41:37] same thing come and see
[41:39] you know you might not always have the
[41:41] the right words or be able to articulate
[41:43] things
[41:44] too well but one thing you can tell your
[41:46] your your friends and you tell your
[41:48] family members and those in the
[41:49] communities
[41:50] come and see and they came and saw where
[41:53] he dwelt in abode with him that day for
[41:55] it was about the tenth hour
[41:57] one of the two which heard john speak
[41:59] and followed him was andrew simon
[42:00] peter's brother he first findeth his own
[42:03] brother simon and sayeth unto him we
[42:04] have found the messiah
[42:06] which is being interpreted the christ
[42:08] and he brought him to jesus and when
[42:10] jesus beheld him he saith thou art simon
[42:12] the son of jonah thou shalt be called
[42:14] cephas
[42:15] which is by interpretation of stone the
[42:17] day following jesus would go forth into
[42:19] galilee and findeth philip
[42:21] and saith unto him follow me now philip
[42:24] was of
[42:25] bethesda the city of andrew and peter
[42:28] philip findeth nathanael saith in him
[42:30] we have found him of whom moses and the
[42:33] law and the prophets did right
[42:35] jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and
[42:38] nathanael sayeth unto him can there be
[42:40] any good thing come out of nazareth
[42:42] philip saith unto him
[42:43] come and see jesus saw nathanael coming
[42:47] to him and saith in them behold an
[42:50] israelite indeed in whom is no guile
[42:53] nathanael sayeth unto him whence knowest
[42:55] thou me
[42:56] jesus answered and said unto him before
[42:59] that philip called thee
[43:00] when thou wasted under the fig tree i
[43:02] saw thee
[43:03] nathanael answered and said unto him
[43:05] rabbi thou art the son of god
[43:08] thou art the king of israel and jesus
[43:10] said unto him
[43:11] because i said unto thee i saw thee unto
[43:14] the fig tree
[43:15] believeth thou thou shalt see greater
[43:18] things
[43:19] than these and he saith unto him verily
[43:22] verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall
[43:24] see
[43:25] the heaven open and the angels of god
[43:27] ascending and descending upon the son of
[43:29] man heavenly father
[43:32] we have read your word lord now we're
[43:34] just asking
[43:36] that the interpreter the holy ghost
[43:38] would come
[43:40] lord and that this word would be opened
[43:42] and revealed to your people
[43:44] lord and myself as a man there's nothing
[43:46] that i can do
[43:47] but even in that lord i know by reading
[43:49] the word your people are blessed
[43:51] we pray that you just come break the
[43:52] bread of life now in jesus christ's name
[43:54] we pray
[43:55] amen amen you may have your seats
[44:00] man i just want to fellowship with you a
[44:02] little bit out of that
[44:05] those last couple verses there i wanted
[44:07] to read maybe a little
[44:09] leading up to it just to get the setting
[44:11] but it says jesus
[44:12] answered and said unto him because i
[44:15] said unto thee
[44:16] i saw thee under the fig tree
[44:19] believeth thou thou shalt see greater
[44:22] things than the
[44:23] these and so i just in the in brother
[44:26] branham in referring to this scripture
[44:28] i just want to read out of a greater
[44:30] than solomon is here
[44:33] he says nathanael being an ordained man
[44:35] to eternal life he said rabbi thou art
[44:37] the son of god the king of israel
[44:39] he said blessed art thou see because i
[44:42] told you this you believe
[44:44] you can see greater things than this see
[44:47] he's ready then
[44:48] to move up into another sphere
[44:52] he'd see greater things that you'll be
[44:54] able to see the angels descending and
[44:56] ascending upon the son of man
[44:59] now because he was coming into higher
[45:01] heights
[45:02] and that's what i want to speak to you
[45:04] for a subject
[45:05] this evening is coming into higher
[45:07] heights and i just even believe it's
[45:09] something that's maybe been voiced in
[45:11] our heart and as
[45:12] fellowshipping with the brothers you
[45:14] know i believe the church and the body
[45:15] were on the cusp
[45:16] of great things i believe we're on the
[45:19] cusp of a unity and a love and such a
[45:22] oneness
[45:23] with our lord and one another looking
[45:24] upon the needs i'm just in great
[45:26] expectation for the things that god is
[45:28] doing amongst us
[45:29] just seeing how people get into action
[45:31] and hearing the testimonies
[45:33] because we're coming into higher heights
[45:35] we're seeing more of his word the
[45:37] promised word
[45:38] being manifested in each one of our
[45:40] lives
[45:41] he says if you that's just accepted
[45:43] christ by justification
[45:46] accept him by sanctification and clean
[45:49] up your life
[45:50] so now the prophet's starting to
[45:52] identify the journey we go through many
[45:54] people come to a place of
[45:56] justification but we don't want to stop
[45:59] at justification he's saying now if you
[46:01] if you believe in jesus christ
[46:03] you that believe now believe him for
[46:05] sanctification and clean up your life
[46:08] you're still smoking watch what happens
[46:10] how much different
[46:11] you look back to justification you who's
[46:14] standing justified and never receiving
[46:16] the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:17] step up into that sphere then look back
[46:20] down at the rest of it see
[46:21] just keep walking till after a while you
[46:24] get so light you could just
[46:26] walk on up in the rapture amen i believe
[46:29] that's what every one of us is doing is
[46:31] we're believing the word of god
[46:33] i meant to greet my my aunt louisa back
[46:35] there it's good to have you
[46:37] amen it's she's always a blessing to us
[46:39] she she comes over to say hi and we're
[46:40] wondering where she is and she's in the
[46:42] laundry doing the laundry
[46:44] you know she comes over to visit and
[46:46] she's such a such a help
[46:48] you know i think we should all have a
[46:50] heart like that
[46:53] looking on the needs and the simple
[46:55] things everybody wants something big
[46:57] great to do
[46:59] sometimes just doing the laundry for
[47:00] somebody going to help
[47:03] clean up their house that's the love of
[47:05] god being shed abroad in
[47:06] your heart we love you amen and uh just
[47:10] coming into higher heights
[47:11] you know we we we that's what we're
[47:13] believing for on this journey
[47:15] and we're all believing for a body
[47:16] change we're all believing to go into a
[47:18] rapture
[47:19] but you know sometimes we make it so
[47:21] complicated
[47:22] sometimes we we just give ourselves into
[47:25] so much thinking about it the prophet i
[47:26] love how he just makes it
[47:28] uh so simple here wherever you're at no
[47:30] matter where you're at in the journey
[47:32] keep looking into the word of god and
[47:34] keep believing for that
[47:36] and god is going to bring you into
[47:38] higher heights as he's telling nathanael
[47:40] here
[47:40] why did he say this because you're
[47:41] you're coming into higher heights and
[47:43] all he said
[47:44] he said nathanael you believe you
[47:45] believe because i told you
[47:47] that i i saw you under a fig tree uh
[47:50] that you believe these things he says oh
[47:52] just stick around a little while and i
[47:54] feel like that with the message oh my
[47:56] you you hear the message and
[47:58] and something your heart is stirred and
[48:00] you believe all that god
[48:02] sent a prophet i say stick around a
[48:03] little while you believe because the
[48:05] message called your name
[48:07] you believe because the discernment of
[48:09] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[48:10] i say stick around a little bit you
[48:12] believe because of that oh just stick
[48:14] around you're going to come into higher
[48:16] heights
[48:16] there's going to be a greater revelation
[48:18] and a greater manifestation
[48:20] as you feed upon this word of god oh
[48:22] line upon line precept upon precept
[48:25] that word is starting to be materialized
[48:27] in your body
[48:28] you're starting to put on this word
[48:29] you're starting to doing yourself
[48:31] in the modern modest apparel of the word
[48:35] oh wow you're coming into higher heights
[48:37] in jesus christ
[48:39] thou shalt see greater things than this
[48:42] don't stop there
[48:43] don't stop where you're at there's more
[48:46] for you i marvel at how nicodemus came
[48:49] there and he came to him by
[48:51] by night you know and he says uh uh he
[48:54] goes
[48:55] master we know speaking maybe for the
[48:57] the sadducees and the pharisees say
[48:59] we know that thou art a master come from
[49:01] god a teacher come from god
[49:03] because nobody could do these things
[49:05] let's go be with him
[49:07] he had a knowledge of the truth but was
[49:09] he willing to be his disciple
[49:12] was he willing in the face as with our
[49:14] pastors uh uh
[49:16] we we just went through the message
[49:17] ashamed i believe we could maybe say
[49:19] that he was ashamed to be identified
[49:22] with jesus christ
[49:23] because of what what would his uh a
[49:26] church-going friend say what would the
[49:27] people in the neighborhood say
[49:29] here here was a he was a a teacher
[49:31] himself and
[49:33] and maybe a leader amongst the people as
[49:36] jesus would later say and
[49:38] but he he was ashamed to be identified
[49:40] with him
[49:41] the prophet would say that he wasn't
[49:44] willing
[49:45] to have self-denial and renounce the
[49:47] things around him
[49:49] he was ashamed maybe so and and i say
[49:52] how many times are we ashamed to speak
[49:54] up for what we believe
[49:56] when the when the situation presents
[49:58] itself
[49:59] and maybe something in your spirit that
[50:01] vexes you
[50:02] oh you know that can be an opportunity
[50:04] for you to tell somebody about jesus
[50:06] christ
[50:09] to be identified with the word
[50:12] we want to take advantage of those
[50:14] opportunities and
[50:16] and let our light shine that we wouldn't
[50:18] be like
[50:19] this nicodemus who said well we know the
[50:22] message is true
[50:24] we know god sent a prophet and and we
[50:27] have an understanding of it
[50:29] but yet are you taking the message from
[50:31] the prophet
[50:32] and are you living it in such a way
[50:34] where you're following it
[50:36] that you are the message where people
[50:38] can look at your life and know that
[50:40] you're different
[50:41] or are you just kind of blending in like
[50:43] a chameleon and
[50:44] and there's not even really any way to
[50:46] kind of uh differentiate you between
[50:48] your coworkers and the people at school
[50:51] do you kind of just talk about the same
[50:53] things and and kind of just go with the
[50:55] flow this way or that way
[50:56] i wonder if it's because we're ashamed
[51:00] you know when we start to fellowship
[51:02] with somebody or or you start to talk to
[51:04] somebody in business or maybe
[51:07] you're at the store or something and a
[51:09] conversation picks up
[51:11] i'm always looking for where's my spot
[51:15] how can i turn this to jesus christ i'm
[51:18] looking for something to be said and
[51:20] your prophet showed how simple it was
[51:22] you could be talking about the weather
[51:25] you know my can you believe how this
[51:26] cold snap come in and everybody's
[51:28] talking about global warming we've never
[51:30] seen
[51:30] temperatures this cold you know and you
[51:32] can start talking about the end times
[51:34] and
[51:34] and oh how people are all worried and
[51:36] such and a wreck and start to see what
[51:38] their hope is and what they're looking
[51:39] for
[51:40] and you can start to tell them about
[51:41] your hope what your peace is oh were you
[51:44] worried no i really wasn't worried
[51:45] because i knew the lord would take care
[51:46] of me
[51:47] he's always seen me through every time
[51:49] i've had a need every time i've had a
[51:51] trouble
[51:51] and you just start talking about the
[51:53] things of god i believe that's the type
[51:54] of
[51:55] of attitude that we should have that's
[51:57] the kind of stance we should have where
[51:59] we're always looking for an opportunity
[52:00] to say come and see
[52:03] now we can give an answer for the hope
[52:05] of why we're here
[52:07] oh maybe you should ask yourself the
[52:09] question why are you here
[52:11] you're here to be a witness you're here
[52:14] to testify
[52:15] you're here to manifest the message
[52:20] and in that message of shame the prophet
[52:21] starts talking about how it's a calling
[52:23] out time
[52:25] it comes a time that you have to come
[52:27] out and stand for the word
[52:29] we're there it might come at great cost
[52:33] with all the political movements and
[52:35] social justice movements
[52:38] you know i believe many people are so
[52:40] bound by fear
[52:42] if i'm going to speak up or say this
[52:45] amongst my peers you know will the
[52:46] targets be turned on me
[52:50] will i become a a a victim
[52:54] of their justice
[52:57] you know jesus christ was a victim for
[53:00] our justice
[53:03] there was a penalty for sin there was a
[53:06] penalty for all the wrong things that we
[53:08] ever did and god demanded justice for
[53:10] that
[53:11] but he came down he he became like one
[53:14] of us
[53:15] born in a manger that he might be one
[53:18] who could be touched by the feeling of
[53:19] our infirmities and he took himself
[53:21] and he had power to lay this life down
[53:23] in power to take it up again
[53:27] for us i say the least we could do is
[53:31] testify of him because he'll see you
[53:35] through
[53:36] just in that text the prophet used
[53:40] mark 8 36 says for what shall it profit
[53:43] a man
[53:45] if he shall gain the whole world
[53:48] and lose his soul or what shall a man
[53:52] give in exchange
[53:53] for his soul whosoever therefore shall
[53:56] be ashamed of me and of my words
[53:59] and this adulterous and sinful
[54:00] generation of him also
[54:03] shall the son of man be ashamed when he
[54:06] cometh
[54:07] in the glory of his father with the holy
[54:09] angels
[54:10] and the prophet makes a statement he
[54:11] goes he talks about as our pastor so
[54:14] beautifully brought out
[54:15] you know why would he be ashamed of you
[54:18] prophet says because you're claiming to
[54:20] be his when you won't follow him
[54:23] when you won't follow his word that's
[54:26] why he'll say on that day depart from me
[54:28] you does of iniquity i never knew you
[54:31] oh my i say lord jesus if i'm claiming
[54:35] to believe this message i want to follow
[54:37] this message with all of my heart
[54:39] we're having some fellowship with the
[54:40] brothers and we started talking about
[54:42] iniquity you know iniquity
[54:44] is knowing what to do and not doing it
[54:47] and many times we we think that um
[54:50] you know we we think of iniquity and i
[54:53] know not to do things that are wrong
[54:56] but it's not limited to that iniquity is
[54:59] knowing what to do that can be the right
[55:02] thing
[55:03] that could be you know what the lord's
[55:04] doing with my heart to pray
[55:07] the lord's putting on my heart to call
[55:08] this brother
[55:10] and and we put it off that's iniquity
[55:15] now as as we're we're growing and we're
[55:17] maturing in the words we're not dealing
[55:19] with those ways of the flesh
[55:21] we're not going out in the world we're
[55:22] not drinking and smoking and
[55:24] by god's grace you're cleaning up your
[55:26] life where you're not uh
[55:27] so involved on the internet and you have
[55:29] all the social media accounts and it's
[55:31] just demanding of your time we've
[55:32] we've preached on those things many
[55:34] times but i pray that you're coming to a
[55:35] place
[55:36] where you're shut in with god that
[55:38] you're in a secret place
[55:40] where the world's shut out and you've
[55:42] come in behind the veil in that secret
[55:44] place
[55:44] where you're having communion with him
[55:46] and all the world just seems so
[55:48] far away that you're in that type of
[55:50] fellowship and that type of communion
[55:52] that now as you're walking the footsteps
[55:57] of a righteous one are ordered of the
[55:58] lord footsteps of a good man are ordered
[56:00] of the lord all those
[56:01] those that are the sons of god they're
[56:02] led by the spirit of god i say oh god
[56:04] lead us today
[56:06] lord lead me today who would you have me
[56:08] to witness to
[56:10] lord help me to be the right father and
[56:12] the right husband
[56:14] help me to say the right word tell me to
[56:16] respond in the right way
[56:18] help me to to be a help around my home
[56:20] help me to treat my colleagues and
[56:22] and help me to be a light to those that
[56:25] are in darkness
[56:27] and now you're walking with that heart
[56:29] and with that anticipation
[56:31] and that action comes on you to witness
[56:33] all
[56:34] you're in tune to the spirit say yes
[56:36] lord
[56:37] i'll go there but when we put those
[56:39] things off now
[56:41] we know to do it but we don't do it but
[56:44] now what what what god is wanting to do
[56:46] he's he's fine-tuning us to get into a
[56:48] position
[56:50] where we can be as we've seen a one who
[56:52] came to matured in our day
[56:54] uh uh who would miss an airplane to be
[56:57] obedient to the still small voice
[57:00] who in the face of certain death would
[57:02] speak to him and say go back
[57:03] up the mountain knowing that it would be
[57:06] death to go back up there
[57:08] but he was sensitive to the still small
[57:10] voice i know that's
[57:13] on the gift of a prophet but we have the
[57:15] same calling to be sensitive
[57:16] to the word of god we have the same
[57:18] calling to be sensitive to the still
[57:20] small voice
[57:20] we have the same calling to be led by
[57:22] the holy spirit
[57:24] just as the prophet was led by the angel
[57:26] lord just like the prophet was led by
[57:27] god
[57:28] you are also led by god you are led by
[57:31] the holy spirit don't sell yourself
[57:33] short
[57:34] don't let the devil try to corner you
[57:35] into such a position
[57:37] where you have no say about it and
[57:39] you're just a little lowly and
[57:40] and god's not using you god is using you
[57:43] if
[57:43] you're in the house and you're raising
[57:45] your children and you're washing dishes
[57:47] keep washing dishes for the glory of god
[57:49] you're doing something for the kingdom
[57:51] and you keep looking at how god can use
[57:53] you to minister to your children
[57:55] and minister to your husband and
[57:56] minister and when you go to the grocery
[57:58] store to the delivery man i don't care
[58:00] what it is let your light shine
[58:02] that's your calling and it's a great
[58:04] calling
[58:06] amen we don't want to be found
[58:10] having that type of iniquity
[58:13] where maybe we get like a nicodemus
[58:16] where we know
[58:17] we know the message god sent a prophet
[58:21] i got my wednesday i got my sunday you
[58:24] know i feel pretty good i
[58:26] i got everything right in order you know
[58:29] i
[58:29] i go through my work day i make my money
[58:31] i pay my bills i come to the house of
[58:33] god they make me feel better they
[58:34] predestinate me
[58:36] you know and i i can't miss it for
[58:37] nothing you know and i just
[58:40] i got a good a good religious thing
[58:41] going
[58:43] but you know sometimes if you ain't
[58:44] going through some trials sometimes it's
[58:46] very little rub
[58:48] if the devil ain't after you you've
[58:50] heard it said maybe he got you
[58:52] maybe we're just getting a little too
[58:53] comfortable maybe maybe the reason why
[58:55] things just kind of are flowing so easy
[58:57] go is because you're not doing anything
[58:59] for the kingdom
[59:00] but let's just step out on faith and
[59:02] start doing something for the kingdom of
[59:03] god and watch the devil show up on the
[59:05] scene
[59:06] but that's all right because greater is
[59:07] he that is in you than he that is in the
[59:09] world
[59:11] but we want to be sold out oh
[59:14] we we want to we want to believe god
[59:16] with all of our heart we don't want to
[59:17] be ashamed
[59:20] and that message the prophet talks about
[59:21] we don't we don't know the devil no
[59:23] apology
[59:24] you don't know your co-workers no
[59:26] apology
[59:28] uh brother jackson tells uh uh the
[59:31] testimony of a girl he witnessed to and
[59:34] she started cleaning up her life
[59:36] and started uh doing it herself with the
[59:39] message and living right and dressing
[59:41] right
[59:41] and and she came home just just the way
[59:44] she was dressing
[59:45] i believe her her dad told her i would
[59:47] rather see you drunk and passed out than
[59:49] wearing a skirt
[59:53] i mean a dad saying that but her
[59:56] life was convicting him it it it was her
[1:00:00] own life
[1:00:01] because she was starting to feed upon
[1:00:04] the word and the word was starting to
[1:00:05] have an effect on when the word starts
[1:00:07] to have an effect on you
[1:00:09] it starts to have effect on those around
[1:00:10] you
[1:00:12] just start feeding on the word take take
[1:00:14] it beyond just a hearer of the word but
[1:00:16] a doer of the word
[1:00:18] and watch that word start having an
[1:00:20] effect on the people around you you're
[1:00:21] going to apologize to him
[1:00:24] just because you're living the word how
[1:00:25] many times have you just being who you
[1:00:27] are
[1:00:28] people think you're being judgmental i
[1:00:31] haven't even said nothing what are you
[1:00:32] talking about
[1:00:33] what do you mean i'm just being
[1:00:35] judgmental you don't have to apologize
[1:00:36] about that
[1:00:37] jesus christ didn't apologize
[1:00:40] he didn't come and apologize for being
[1:00:42] the word made flesh but no when they
[1:00:44] took offense
[1:00:45] with what he said he says does that
[1:00:47] offend you
[1:00:48] lest you eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:00:50] you'll have no part with me oh
[1:00:52] they're with the multitude they went to
[1:00:53] thousands like we can't handle this
[1:00:55] he didn't say i'm sorry i'm sorry god
[1:00:58] sent a prophet
[1:01:00] you know i'm i'm sorry this is the light
[1:01:03] of the hour and the scripture says as
[1:01:05] you walk in the light as he is in the
[1:01:06] light we have fellowship one with
[1:01:07] another
[1:01:08] and the blood of jesus christ shall
[1:01:09] cleanse you from all your sins and start
[1:01:11] to tell them about all the religious
[1:01:13] systems and everything they're a part of
[1:01:15] and that demons can travel in the name
[1:01:16] of the father son and holy ghost
[1:01:18] not the name the lord jesus christ but
[1:01:20] in titles
[1:01:21] he didn't apologize for it
[1:01:25] no he said does that offend you what
[1:01:27] about when you see the son of man
[1:01:28] ascending up from what he came
[1:01:32] unless you start manifesting the word oh
[1:01:35] that's
[1:01:35] i mean it's going to happen social
[1:01:38] justices and
[1:01:39] and people and neighbors and all that
[1:01:41] you keep manifesting this word you're
[1:01:42] going to be offended somebody but you
[1:01:44] don't need to apologize for it
[1:01:47] well we need to apologizes to him
[1:01:51] for not being a proper ambassador for
[1:01:54] not being a proper representation
[1:01:56] for allowing iniquity to rise up in our
[1:01:58] lives where we let the things of god go
[1:02:00] by
[1:02:00] so often be faithful in the little
[1:02:04] things
[1:02:05] god help us help me lord to be faithful
[1:02:09] in the little things
[1:02:10] we want to see all the big things
[1:02:14] we we want to see manifestations of big
[1:02:16] things in our life but we got to be
[1:02:18] faithful with the little things
[1:02:22] how many times we say it over and over
[1:02:24] about starting the day out right
[1:02:26] putting one foot on the bed saying
[1:02:27] praise god for another day
[1:02:30] and get on your knees and go to a prayer
[1:02:32] but what happens
[1:02:34] that cares of lives and demands
[1:02:38] all of a sudden something starts to take
[1:02:41] that place
[1:02:43] one thing leads to another that's
[1:02:45] iniquity
[1:02:47] because we know to give him the first
[1:02:49] place
[1:02:51] we know to seek him first the scripture
[1:02:54] says seek ye
[1:02:55] seek him early and you shall find him oh
[1:02:58] so many blessings and so many things
[1:03:00] that have been given to us but we're
[1:03:01] letting the little things
[1:03:03] fall out the wayside we're letting the
[1:03:05] little foxes that spoil the vine
[1:03:07] but oh let's not allow that iniquity to
[1:03:09] start adding up in our life let's get
[1:03:11] right with him
[1:03:12] say you know lord it might be just a
[1:03:14] wednesday night but that's right
[1:03:15] i remember what it was like when i got
[1:03:17] out the revival meetings i remember what
[1:03:18] it was like when i got out of camp
[1:03:20] i remember what it was like when i
[1:03:21] traveled down to the men's meeting i
[1:03:23] knew what it was like when i had that
[1:03:24] fire burning on the inside of me
[1:03:26] and i just felt like i'd come into a
[1:03:28] higher height but you know i've gotten a
[1:03:29] little
[1:03:30] complacent now i i feel like i'm not
[1:03:32] even expecting when i go to the house of
[1:03:34] god
[1:03:34] oh how many times we can be rightfully
[1:03:37] so we we get
[1:03:38] uh so an expectation when we're having
[1:03:40] special service we get
[1:03:42] so an expectation of when we're going to
[1:03:44] the house of god and maybe it's a
[1:03:46] minister you have confidence in
[1:03:47] oh there's such an expectation you come
[1:03:49] expecting to receive something from the
[1:03:51] lord
[1:03:52] i say oh can't we wake up in the morning
[1:03:54] and have that type of expectation
[1:03:56] to know that we've entered into a love
[1:03:57] relationship with none other than jesus
[1:04:00] christ
[1:04:00] and know that we can speak to him and
[1:04:02] commune within the scripture says
[1:04:04] pray without ceasing oh god
[1:04:08] let that be manifested in our lives
[1:04:11] that we can pray without ceasing that we
[1:04:14] could have such a communion oh
[1:04:16] just think of it have you ever met a
[1:04:17] little child that had an invisible
[1:04:19] friend
[1:04:22] and they're just talking to him oh my
[1:04:25] no me and sam we're going to go over
[1:04:26] here we're going to do who are you
[1:04:28] talking to
[1:04:30] maybe we ought to just get so fanatical
[1:04:33] maybe we ought to just start praying so
[1:04:34] often without seeing some people like
[1:04:36] who are you talking i'm talking to the
[1:04:37] lord
[1:04:39] not ashamed i can introduce
[1:04:43] you to him you got an invisible friend
[1:04:46] well yep
[1:04:47] you might not see him but the scripture
[1:04:48] says if you are born again
[1:04:51] oh that's the way you can see the
[1:04:52] kingdom of god look people think you're
[1:04:54] a fruitcake
[1:04:55] they think you're a nut because they
[1:04:56] can't see the things you see
[1:04:58] but blessed are your eyes that you can
[1:05:00] see these things
[1:05:01] because you are born again and you can
[1:05:03] see the kingdom of god
[1:05:05] oh let's get to a place where we're
[1:05:07] praying without ceasing
[1:05:09] that way when the emergency call comes
[1:05:14] that way when the need comes does
[1:05:16] anybody know somebody that's a prayer
[1:05:18] warrior
[1:05:20] i know a prayer warrior i'm gonna tell a
[1:05:22] little story on sister genie
[1:05:24] so many times in the early years there
[1:05:26] in the church we'd be in the church
[1:05:28] we'd stay after an old sister genie she
[1:05:30] just she'd be praying she'd just pull me
[1:05:32] right in the presence of god
[1:05:34] she'd just be praying and praying or
[1:05:36] fervently praying oh
[1:05:37] it taught me something and i'd like to
[1:05:40] get
[1:05:41] i like to give her a little a rose and
[1:05:43] let her know she's been such an example
[1:05:45] to me
[1:05:46] and i've seen a fervent prayer and i've
[1:05:48] seen such an example and it's courage me
[1:05:50] that oh we can live in such a place and
[1:05:52] such a communion
[1:05:54] that we can change the atmosphere in the
[1:05:56] room that we can even pull our brothers
[1:05:58] and sisters that are around us
[1:06:00] that are having a hard time and they're
[1:06:02] not breaking through to the presence
[1:06:03] although we're at such a channel we can
[1:06:05] be saying all right brothers all right
[1:06:07] sisters let's go
[1:06:08] let's go i'ma start doing my part i'm
[1:06:10] gonna start worshiping in the service
[1:06:13] it starts in the pre-service
[1:06:17] you know you ever go watch a football
[1:06:19] game or
[1:06:20] you you imagine if the guys woke up and
[1:06:22] put on their pads and ran out on the
[1:06:24] on the field you talk about a wreck
[1:06:28] the people would be running everywhere
[1:06:30] would be the athletic trainers and the
[1:06:31] doctors because everybody would be erect
[1:06:33] they'd all be broke and
[1:06:34] pulled this hamstring and broke this and
[1:06:36] broke that
[1:06:38] hey i kind of feel like that you know
[1:06:40] pre-service
[1:06:42] just get our mind right create an
[1:06:45] atmosphere
[1:06:47] say lord we're doing spiritual battle
[1:06:50] i got brothers and sisters that are
[1:06:52] coming in here that are in bondage
[1:06:54] they have broken hearts they need
[1:06:56] answers lord and i'm here
[1:06:58] i'm here to lay it all on the altar lord
[1:07:00] and start to to call upon you to come on
[1:07:03] down and create such an atmosphere here
[1:07:05] all that when they break through those
[1:07:06] doors there's just a change in the
[1:07:08] atmosphere
[1:07:09] oh it just feels a little bit different
[1:07:11] feels a little bit
[1:07:12] different before what what's happening
[1:07:14] there's people that are preparing to do
[1:07:16] spiritual warfare
[1:07:17] and then all the song leader comes up
[1:07:19] and and the musicians that have already
[1:07:21] struck the chord and there's a unity now
[1:07:23] and the body starts marching forward
[1:07:25] onward christian soldiers
[1:07:27] marching on the war oh doom devils are
[1:07:30] on the run
[1:07:31] you start praising jesus what happens
[1:07:33] jesus comes near
[1:07:36] and then your brothers and your sisters
[1:07:37] are maybe down in a funk or they're down
[1:07:39] in a valley
[1:07:40] oh you can reach down and pull them up
[1:07:42] into the presence of god and get them
[1:07:44] the victory
[1:07:46] get in such an atmosphere that when the
[1:07:48] word starts coming forth
[1:07:51] we're not just wondering if we you know
[1:07:54] shut off the coffee pot and did i send
[1:07:56] out that email
[1:07:58] we get halfway through the service
[1:08:01] hardly getting anything out of it
[1:08:06] no faithful in the little things
[1:08:11] start taking advantage of our
[1:08:13] opportunities
[1:08:16] start knowing that god is with us
[1:08:20] god is here and he means business would
[1:08:24] god
[1:08:24] do we do we believe that jesus christ is
[1:08:26] here
[1:08:28] when he comes on the scene he come to do
[1:08:29] something
[1:08:32] so you can even start forming that in
[1:08:33] your heart of your need
[1:08:36] now what you're battling now what you're
[1:08:37] going through jesus christ has come
[1:08:39] he's come here to speak to your need we
[1:08:42] don't know apology to the devil we don't
[1:08:43] owe
[1:08:44] an apology to the world we don't know oh
[1:08:46] apology the deacons oh you're holding
[1:08:48] order in the church you don't know an
[1:08:49] apology
[1:08:50] you keep staying at your poster do your
[1:08:52] job that's what you're here for
[1:08:54] god bless you you don't have to i
[1:08:56] apologize i know people get their
[1:08:58] feelings hurt and
[1:08:59] we have to do the best we can to let
[1:09:00] them know the way we do but you don't
[1:09:01] have to apologize
[1:09:04] let's keep uh oppressing the battle
[1:09:08] manifesting this word paul says for i am
[1:09:10] not ashamed
[1:09:11] of the gospel of christ for it is the
[1:09:14] power of god unto salvation
[1:09:17] to everyone that believeth
[1:09:20] just think of that not ashamed
[1:09:24] of the gospel to think that our brothers
[1:09:27] and sisters
[1:09:29] they were stoned fed the lions
[1:09:34] they were sold asunder they were
[1:09:37] crucified they were burnt at the stakes
[1:09:40] whom the world wasn't even worthy of
[1:09:46] maybe they'd be with their
[1:09:49] family out there in the arena
[1:09:54] maybe say in the words of their lord and
[1:09:56] savior greater is he that is in me than
[1:09:57] he that is in the world
[1:10:00] say daddy i don't understand i don't
[1:10:02] understand
[1:10:03] either sweetheart but greater is he that
[1:10:06] is in me than he that is in the world
[1:10:08] oh it looked like foolishness it looked
[1:10:10] like weakness to the world
[1:10:13] but what a strength to be able to
[1:10:15] believe god in the face of death
[1:10:21] to be able to take god at his word
[1:10:24] in the face of all the testimonies of
[1:10:26] the doctor saying
[1:10:28] you're sick and there's no way you're
[1:10:30] ever going to be different
[1:10:34] i remember just here recently god bless
[1:10:36] our brother john bill who
[1:10:38] starting the journey of mourning the
[1:10:40] loss of a mourning and
[1:10:42] the loss of his wife and
[1:10:45] we were there up there for the funeral
[1:10:47] and we were sitting around at the table
[1:10:48] and
[1:10:49] we had we had fervently prayed and that
[1:10:52] god would heal her and take her out of
[1:10:53] the bed and
[1:10:54] we're believers that's what we do
[1:10:58] and the lord saw fit to take sister
[1:11:01] donna home and
[1:11:02] we were there just after the viewing we
[1:11:06] went out to get a bite to eat
[1:11:09] we were sitting there and he battles a
[1:11:10] little uh
[1:11:13] varticulitis or something like that and
[1:11:15] i just
[1:11:16] heard his son saying dad should you go
[1:11:18] to the hospital
[1:11:20] and i thought oh my are you okay he's
[1:11:22] like i'm gonna be all right i'm gonna be
[1:11:24] all right
[1:11:26] and i said would you like me to pray for
[1:11:28] you
[1:11:29] he says yes i'd like you to pray for me
[1:11:31] and as i got up to go pray for him there
[1:11:32] that little devil was
[1:11:34] like you're gonna go pray for a man
[1:11:37] who you've all been praying for his wife
[1:11:39] and and it wasn't the outcome you were
[1:11:41] looking for
[1:11:43] but i thought you know god bless you
[1:11:45] brother john being a testament he didn't
[1:11:47] change
[1:11:48] his attitude towards the word it didn't
[1:11:51] change his stand for the gospel
[1:11:53] but he said yes brother matthew pray for
[1:11:55] me because prayer changes things
[1:11:57] that's what a real believer does in the
[1:12:00] face of death
[1:12:01] in the face of all adversary it doesn't
[1:12:03] matter what it is
[1:12:04] you're going to stand upon the word
[1:12:06] because it's the truth no matter what
[1:12:07] the outcome is
[1:12:09] he said i am the lord i heal all of your
[1:12:11] diseases by his stripes
[1:12:13] we are healed that's thus saith the lord
[1:12:15] and heavens and earth we'll pass away
[1:12:17] but that word will never pass away
[1:12:21] well that's what we do as believers we
[1:12:22] believe
[1:12:24] just thinking of those precious brothers
[1:12:27] and sisters who laid down their lives
[1:12:31] in the face of death cleaving to god's
[1:12:34] word
[1:12:37] and i wonder maybe many times
[1:12:40] we feel like that in our own lives
[1:12:44] we're believing for a promise
[1:12:47] we're looking for an answer
[1:12:51] and we're wondering lord
[1:12:55] why am i not seeing the results lord why
[1:12:58] am i not seeing your promised word being
[1:13:00] manifested in my life
[1:13:03] you believe you know you believe
[1:13:06] the devil can't shake you from that
[1:13:09] but you just can't you're just wondering
[1:13:11] what's going on
[1:13:13] when is it ever going to happen when is
[1:13:15] this promised lord
[1:13:17] how is that ever happened for me
[1:13:20] you know you're in good company because
[1:13:22] king david was in a straight one time
[1:13:26] you know god had called him from the
[1:13:27] sheepfold
[1:13:30] just the the readiest of the boys there
[1:13:32] out tended to sheep and god had called
[1:13:34] him
[1:13:35] and he had anointed him and the spirit
[1:13:36] of the lord came upon him and he was to
[1:13:38] be king
[1:13:40] but you know it didn't go exactly like
[1:13:42] david would have thought
[1:13:44] if it wasn't before long here david was
[1:13:46] he was held up in some caves
[1:13:48] and here his own king saul is after him
[1:13:51] the guy that
[1:13:53] he had blessed with his songs and
[1:13:54] created an atmosphere for and
[1:13:56] and was trying to help me be a help to
[1:13:59] him and and
[1:14:00] bless him and now his own kings after
[1:14:02] his life and the philistines are on the
[1:14:04] other end
[1:14:05] they're chasing him down his own
[1:14:08] home bethlehem is is now under siege
[1:14:13] oh yeah you're king what kind of king
[1:14:16] are you david
[1:14:17] you king of the cave
[1:14:22] you know how many subjects do you got
[1:14:24] over here
[1:14:25] you got a few hundred guys you've got a
[1:14:27] few outcasts that are following you
[1:14:28] around some type of king you are
[1:14:32] you could see how david had received a
[1:14:34] promise
[1:14:35] but there in the midst of that word
[1:14:37] being manifested in him he was going
[1:14:38] through valleys he was going
[1:14:40] through a time of uncertainty
[1:14:44] but just thinking of those those men
[1:14:46] that were with david
[1:14:48] what i love about that as the prophet
[1:14:51] alludes to
[1:14:53] he said that those men knew
[1:14:57] who was going to be king he knew that
[1:15:01] they knew that the anointing
[1:15:03] was on king david so they knew as long
[1:15:07] as they were with king david
[1:15:11] they were going to be in the kingdom and
[1:15:13] i say as long as you have jesus christ
[1:15:15] in your heart
[1:15:17] it doesn't matter what goals or what
[1:15:19] comes
[1:15:20] as long as you have him with you it
[1:15:23] doesn't matter where
[1:15:24] you are you might feel like you're
[1:15:26] kicked way back in a cave
[1:15:27] you might feel like you're kicked back
[1:15:29] to this side but just like those men
[1:15:31] they knew that they were with the king
[1:15:33] and as long as you know you're with
[1:15:34] jesus christ the prophet of god would
[1:15:36] say we know who is going
[1:15:38] to be king does it matter who is going
[1:15:40] to be president
[1:15:41] i know who's going to be king he will be
[1:15:44] king and i know it takes something to
[1:15:45] stand
[1:15:46] but god help me to shut my eyes to the
[1:15:48] denominations and everything else
[1:15:50] and look to the spiritual sight yonder
[1:15:53] that is
[1:15:53] the coming king i'll serve him if it's
[1:15:57] death
[1:15:58] let me die if it's my family
[1:16:01] it's my loved ones if it's my
[1:16:03] denomination
[1:16:05] it's everything let me serve him this is
[1:16:08] the attitude
[1:16:10] that our brothers and sisters had when
[1:16:12] they went into those arenas when they
[1:16:13] were burned at the stake
[1:16:14] they weren't ashamed if it's death lord
[1:16:18] if it's in your name i'll go to the
[1:16:20] stake
[1:16:24] families of six and eight ten
[1:16:28] women with children being pulled from
[1:16:30] their bellies
[1:16:33] knowing that if they profess the name of
[1:16:34] jesus christ
[1:16:36] it would be their death
[1:16:40] are we ashamed are we embarrassed
[1:16:46] would you go into that arena
[1:16:49] will you testify will you start letting
[1:16:53] your light shine
[1:16:57] will you kids at school you young men
[1:16:59] and young women
[1:17:00] go to the colleges now and realize that
[1:17:04] that's your your
[1:17:05] your betting ground one planteth one
[1:17:08] water but god gives the increase
[1:17:11] start seeing a revival at the high
[1:17:13] schools why not a revival in
[1:17:16] elementary school
[1:17:20] if he's going to do it it's going to be
[1:17:22] through you
[1:17:24] i'll say to him that's the warriors of
[1:17:26] god
[1:17:27] like it was with david that had their
[1:17:29] hands on their sword walking
[1:17:32] anytime they had their hands on their
[1:17:34] sword walking anytime that's the way
[1:17:36] god's warriors
[1:17:37] walk ready i want to walk ready amen
[1:17:44] i say keep coming to church
[1:17:48] keep doing the things you know to do
[1:17:51] keep
[1:17:51] following after the word of god keep
[1:17:54] having people over for dinner keep doing
[1:17:56] the things that you know
[1:17:58] to do keep walking with god what did the
[1:18:02] prophet say you keep walking
[1:18:04] and you get so light that you could walk
[1:18:06] up into a rapture
[1:18:08] what did he not do he walked with god
[1:18:10] and he was not
[1:18:13] i say just keep walking
[1:18:16] keep washing the dishes keep doing the
[1:18:19] laundry enoch
[1:18:21] keep going to work and testify in enoch
[1:18:25] keep doing the things that you're
[1:18:26] already doing brad in one of these days
[1:18:30] one of these days you're going to be not
[1:18:32] you're going to be gone you're going to
[1:18:34] be out of here and it's in those little
[1:18:36] things
[1:18:37] that god is accomplishing great things
[1:18:41] just in reading that text he said verily
[1:18:43] verily i say unto you hereafter
[1:18:47] you shall see heaven open and the angels
[1:18:48] of god ascending and descending upon the
[1:18:50] son of man
[1:18:53] just walk until you get so light you
[1:18:55] could just walk up in the rapture
[1:18:57] i love this portion of scripture because
[1:18:59] here
[1:19:01] jesus is referring to jacob's ladder in
[1:19:03] genesis 28.
[1:19:07] this phrase that you'll find out it is
[1:19:10] seeing angels descending and ascending
[1:19:12] upon the son of man
[1:19:14] if you go into genesis chapter 28 you'll
[1:19:16] find that
[1:19:17] here uh jacob isaac had called jacob but
[1:19:20] he said now
[1:19:22] jacob i want you to go get a wife
[1:19:26] but i don't i don't want you to take a
[1:19:28] wife like esau did of these canaanites
[1:19:32] he didn't want jacob to take a wife like
[1:19:35] his denominational brother did
[1:19:38] mixing the word of god and
[1:19:41] his wives that he took were a vexation
[1:19:44] to his soul
[1:19:45] and to his wife and so he said look
[1:19:48] don't take your wife of one of these but
[1:19:50] i want you to go down and take a wife of
[1:19:52] the house of laban
[1:19:53] your uncle and so jacob now he's
[1:19:58] following what his father has asked him
[1:20:01] to do and now he's
[1:20:02] he's moving out and going towards that
[1:20:04] land he's going to go find himself a
[1:20:06] wife
[1:20:07] and on his way down there he's going to
[1:20:10] to camp
[1:20:11] out and just so happens that night he
[1:20:13] grabs a
[1:20:14] a stone and he's going to lay down for
[1:20:17] the evening and he makes a a stone his
[1:20:19] pillow and
[1:20:20] jacob has a dream and he
[1:20:23] starts to have this dream and he and it
[1:20:26] says that he dreamed and behold a ladder
[1:20:28] was set up on earth
[1:20:30] genesis 28 verse 12
[1:20:34] and the top of it reached to heaven and
[1:20:36] behold the angels of god ascending
[1:20:38] and descending on it and behold the lord
[1:20:42] stood above it
[1:20:43] and said i am the lord god of abraham
[1:20:45] thy father
[1:20:46] and the god of isaac the land wherein
[1:20:48] thou liest to thee will i give it
[1:20:50] and to thy seed and when he had woken
[1:20:53] out of that place
[1:20:55] oh he just said oh this is a dreadful
[1:20:57] place this is a fearful place
[1:20:58] eddie he he he got some oil and he
[1:21:00] anointed the stone there and he called
[1:21:02] that place bethel
[1:21:04] which means house of god and i just
[1:21:07] thought oh how amazing it is here
[1:21:10] jesus christ just standing before
[1:21:11] nathanael saying
[1:21:13] oh i believe you believed because i i
[1:21:16] knew that you were under the fig tree
[1:21:18] but greater things than this will you
[1:21:20] see
[1:21:21] and here now the house of god jesus
[1:21:24] christ the word made flesh
[1:21:25] is standing there telling nathanael
[1:21:27] these things that he's going to be
[1:21:28] taking him into higher heights
[1:21:30] and now here jacob is in this in this
[1:21:32] dream he's anointing the stone and say
[1:21:34] oh this is like the house of god
[1:21:36] god spoke to me god came down and he
[1:21:38] confirmed the promise
[1:21:40] that he gave to my dad he confirmed the
[1:21:42] promise that he gave to my grandpa
[1:21:44] and i say if you have been grown up in
[1:21:46] this message and you've been believing
[1:21:48] this message i say you pray
[1:21:50] and have god come down and confirm this
[1:21:52] promised word to you personally
[1:21:54] don't take no second-hand revelation
[1:21:57] get it for yourself the prophet said oh
[1:22:00] you you're ashamed because you don't
[1:22:02] know what you're talking about
[1:22:03] you need to know what you're talking
[1:22:04] about meet him one time and you'll know
[1:22:07] what you're talking about
[1:22:10] so now jacob's going to continue on and
[1:22:13] he goes out to
[1:22:14] his until laban and a lot transpires
[1:22:18] there he gets married and
[1:22:19] now he's he's leaving with his two wives
[1:22:21] and children
[1:22:23] because he really you know he was a
[1:22:25] shyster
[1:22:27] and he pulled a fast one over on his
[1:22:29] father-in-law and
[1:22:30] robbed him of all of his cattle and so
[1:22:33] now he's going back home
[1:22:36] you know and he's going to find himself
[1:22:38] maybe in a a in a
[1:22:41] a squeeze like david was he starts going
[1:22:44] home and now all of a sudden
[1:22:46] laban and all his workers and servants
[1:22:49] they're all coming after him on one side
[1:22:51] and now he's getting closer to home he's
[1:22:53] like well you know you saw really don't
[1:22:55] like me either
[1:22:57] and 400 of esau's men come up on one
[1:22:59] side and camp on one side now jacob's
[1:23:01] like all right
[1:23:02] i'm doomed what am i going to do
[1:23:06] let's see jacob got desperate
[1:23:10] in it interesting how god could make
[1:23:13] promises to us but we let him so easily
[1:23:18] slip
[1:23:20] he gives us promises that he'll never
[1:23:22] leave you nor forsake you
[1:23:24] he said all my peace i give unto you
[1:23:26] come unto me all ye who are heavy laden
[1:23:28] and i will give you rest
[1:23:31] so how often how easy it is we let those
[1:23:34] promises slip
[1:23:35] so that when the cares of life and maybe
[1:23:38] challenges and things arise we we get
[1:23:41] all worked up
[1:23:43] here jacob is he he starts to get
[1:23:45] desperate he starts to call on the name
[1:23:46] of the lord
[1:23:48] and there he wrestled with a man i
[1:23:50] believe that's
[1:23:51] where a lot of us need to get to
[1:23:54] we need to wrestle it out with the angel
[1:23:56] of the lord
[1:23:58] because it was in that place it was in
[1:24:01] that place where
[1:24:03] jacob wrestled it out there with god
[1:24:06] he got the blessing he said i won't let
[1:24:09] you go
[1:24:10] till you bless me we're a blessed people
[1:24:14] i can't think of a people on the face of
[1:24:16] this earth that are more blessed than
[1:24:17] you
[1:24:18] god has blessed us he's blessed us with
[1:24:21] a message he's blessed us
[1:24:22] with his promises and i want to read
[1:24:24] this out of isaiah 43 he says but now
[1:24:26] thus saith the lord
[1:24:29] that created the o jacob
[1:24:32] and he that formed the o israel fear not
[1:24:35] for i have redeemed thee i have called
[1:24:38] thee by thy name thou art mine
[1:24:43] when thou passes through the waters i
[1:24:45] want to focus on that word right there
[1:24:48] when thou passes through
[1:24:51] anybody ever felt like a stick in the
[1:24:52] mud
[1:24:54] like i'm not going anywhere i've been
[1:24:57] trying
[1:24:58] and trying and trying but i don't seem
[1:25:00] like my prayers
[1:25:02] are are getting higher than the bedroom
[1:25:04] ceiling
[1:25:05] i want to encourage you because the
[1:25:07] scripture here say when thou passes
[1:25:09] through the waters
[1:25:11] i will be with thee and through the
[1:25:13] rivers
[1:25:14] they shall not overflow thee when thou
[1:25:17] walkest through the fire
[1:25:19] thou shall not be burned neither shall
[1:25:21] the flame kindle upon thee
[1:25:24] when thou pass it through look you're
[1:25:25] going somewhere
[1:25:28] if i can just encourage you in that
[1:25:30] regards you're going somewhere
[1:25:32] you're not here stuck in a rut you're
[1:25:34] not just here uh uh
[1:25:36] trying to uh keep it together trying to
[1:25:38] hold it together he goes no but i have
[1:25:40] chosen you
[1:25:41] i have formed you fear not i have
[1:25:43] redeemed you
[1:25:45] oh what does it mean to be redeemed it
[1:25:48] means to be
[1:25:49] brought back you want to know where
[1:25:52] you're going
[1:25:53] you're going back to where you are with
[1:25:55] him in the very beginning
[1:25:57] i have redeemed you look when you when
[1:26:00] you plant a seed into the ground
[1:26:03] how do you know what that seed is going
[1:26:04] to look like
[1:26:06] well if you got it from an apple tree
[1:26:09] you get a seed from an apple you know
[1:26:13] what that seed is going to produce
[1:26:16] you're going to get apples so maybe we
[1:26:19] can just read a scripture here
[1:26:20] and really encourage you
[1:26:24] but the scripture says in galatians 3 16
[1:26:26] it says now abraham now to abraham and
[1:26:28] his seed
[1:26:30] were the promised maid he saith not into
[1:26:33] seeds
[1:26:34] as of many but as of one seed and thy
[1:26:38] seed
[1:26:38] which is christ now
[1:26:42] that was the promisee which was jesus
[1:26:45] christ
[1:26:46] and in john the promisee christ says
[1:26:51] john 12 24 he says verily verily i say
[1:26:54] unto you
[1:26:54] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:26:56] ground and die
[1:26:58] it abideth alone but if it die it
[1:27:01] bringeth forth
[1:27:03] much fruit
[1:27:06] now what is the fruit he's talking about
[1:27:11] you are his offspring jesus christ the
[1:27:15] original seed
[1:27:17] except he would die and go in the ground
[1:27:19] he would abide alone but because of that
[1:27:22] now
[1:27:22] he's bringing forth sons and daughters
[1:27:25] of god
[1:27:26] where does the fruit come from it comes
[1:27:29] from the seed
[1:27:32] where does the word come from
[1:27:35] where does the seed come from comes from
[1:27:38] the word
[1:27:40] and the spoken word is the original seed
[1:27:43] so where did you come from where were
[1:27:46] you in the very beginning you were in
[1:27:48] the mind of god and that's why the
[1:27:49] prophet would stand there and say
[1:27:51] you literally are the spoken word seed
[1:27:54] bride
[1:27:56] that's who you are where did you come
[1:27:58] from you came from the seed
[1:28:01] where did the seed come on the seed came
[1:28:03] from the word
[1:28:04] and the spoken word is the original seed
[1:28:07] that's where you came from
[1:28:08] you are those literal spoken word seed
[1:28:11] bride
[1:28:13] you are the fruit of the original seed
[1:28:16] the very offspring of god
[1:28:19] and if god has a son he's a god son he's
[1:28:24] a
[1:28:25] a miniature jehovah
[1:28:29] the prophet says redeem means to buy
[1:28:31] back it restores to the original owner
[1:28:34] god by his death the shed blood brought
[1:28:37] back his own he brought back this
[1:28:40] he bought back the spoken word seed
[1:28:42] bride my sheep hear my voice
[1:28:45] word and they follow me you always
[1:28:48] worship i love this
[1:28:51] you never were a pig or a dog turned
[1:28:54] into a sheep
[1:28:57] why the devil hates that one you mean i
[1:29:00] didn't have nothing to do with it
[1:29:02] no you always
[1:29:05] were a son or daughter of god
[1:29:08] you weren't you weren't a sinner or a
[1:29:12] non-son of god who happened to one day
[1:29:15] say i'll take you up on the offer
[1:29:18] you always were a son
[1:29:21] he said you never were a pig or a dog
[1:29:23] turned into a sheep
[1:29:25] that is impossible for every kind of
[1:29:29] life
[1:29:30] produces the same kind and there is no
[1:29:34] change in species now we're talking
[1:29:37] about the original seed
[1:29:39] jesus christ then
[1:29:42] what he was you are
[1:29:45] there's no change in specie as we were
[1:29:48] in the thoughts of god and then
[1:29:50] expressed in the flesh
[1:29:52] there had to come a day when we would
[1:29:55] hear his voice the word
[1:29:57] and hearing that voice become aware
[1:30:00] of our father calling us and recognize
[1:30:04] that we
[1:30:04] are the sons of god we heard his voice
[1:30:08] and we cried out as did the prodigal son
[1:30:11] save me oh my father
[1:30:13] i am returning to thee i say maybe
[1:30:16] that's what some of us just need to do
[1:30:18] here we just need to repent we need to
[1:30:21] say oh
[1:30:21] lord jesus forgive me save me o my
[1:30:24] father
[1:30:25] i have found myself in places that i
[1:30:28] never should have been
[1:30:30] i have found myself doing things that i
[1:30:32] never
[1:30:33] should have done but now o lord i am
[1:30:35] calling upon your name and i am
[1:30:37] returning to thee
[1:30:41] oh that's all it takes it's for his son
[1:30:47] just think of this now we just read that
[1:30:50] scripture in isaiah 43 thus saith the
[1:30:52] lord that created thee he that formed
[1:30:54] thee
[1:30:55] o zion o bride put your name in there
[1:31:01] go on and put your name in there brother
[1:31:03] jackson
[1:31:04] put your name in there brother banks go
[1:31:08] ahead and
[1:31:08] put your name in there
[1:31:12] say oh thus saith the lord that created
[1:31:14] thee he that formed me
[1:31:17] o zion oh matthew
[1:31:20] oh jackson o banks fear not for i have
[1:31:24] redeemed thee i
[1:31:25] have called thee by thy name thou art
[1:31:27] mine so when thou
[1:31:29] through the waters when you go through
[1:31:32] the trials and the tribulations
[1:31:35] when you go through the time of lost
[1:31:36] loved ones when you go through the time
[1:31:39] of being broken up when you go through
[1:31:41] the time of that one who you are
[1:31:42] interested in and he's you started to
[1:31:45] give your emotions
[1:31:46] and your time to it and you just thought
[1:31:48] they might be the one for you
[1:31:50] and it seems all sudden it's broke up
[1:31:52] and you're all hurt you don't know what
[1:31:54] you're going to do with your life
[1:31:55] oh he's with you remember you're passing
[1:31:58] through now
[1:31:59] he's not going to leave you in that
[1:32:01] condition but he said i will be with you
[1:32:03] because he's bringing you through your
[1:32:05] trials
[1:32:06] he's bringing you through your
[1:32:07] tribulations
[1:32:09] and i want to say it's not so much about
[1:32:12] where you were
[1:32:14] or what you're being brought through but
[1:32:17] i want to say it's all about where
[1:32:18] you're going
[1:32:20] oh some of us can identify some of us
[1:32:22] were in jail
[1:32:23] some of us might have been in the crack
[1:32:25] house some of us might have been doing
[1:32:26] drugs out on the street
[1:32:28] some of us might have been in a
[1:32:29] religious system some of us might have
[1:32:31] been in the catholic church
[1:32:32] some of us might have been called out of
[1:32:34] pentecost some of us might have been
[1:32:35] called out of the ballrooms
[1:32:38] i want to say it's it's not so much and
[1:32:40] we praise god for every testimony
[1:32:44] because he shows us his grace he shows
[1:32:47] us his mercy
[1:32:48] how that loving hand can reach down to
[1:32:50] the lowest steps
[1:32:52] oh i can save a sinner such as i
[1:32:56] but we might not all have in common of
[1:32:59] the place he reached down and got us out
[1:33:01] naturally now spiritually we all can
[1:33:03] relate we are all born in sin
[1:33:06] we all needed a savior and god rich and
[1:33:08] mercy within that great love wherein he
[1:33:10] loved us
[1:33:11] oh we have that all in common but i know
[1:33:13] it might not be able to have the same
[1:33:14] testimony that you have
[1:33:17] am i not being in the places that you've
[1:33:19] been
[1:33:20] i might not have been able to identify
[1:33:22] with that but one thing we can identify
[1:33:24] with
[1:33:24] i might not come from where you came
[1:33:26] from but we're all going to the same
[1:33:29] place
[1:33:31] you know you look on a map and it says
[1:33:33] you are here
[1:33:35] that's what the word of god does is it
[1:33:37] shows you where you're living
[1:33:40] sometimes we just need to know where
[1:33:41] we're living
[1:33:44] as we read that opening quote
[1:33:48] if you're living under justification
[1:33:50] there's more for you
[1:33:52] you're living under sanctification
[1:33:54] there's more for you
[1:33:57] we don't look down if you have something
[1:33:59] you need to make right if you need to
[1:34:00] confess your faults
[1:34:01] one to another if you've been living
[1:34:03] under bondage if you've been living
[1:34:04] you watched the power of god you you
[1:34:07] exposed that devil
[1:34:10] i said you this is the word about you
[1:34:13] confess your faults one to another
[1:34:16] you expose that devil that's been
[1:34:18] keeping you in bondage
[1:34:20] and you take god at his word by the
[1:34:22] laying on the hands and by prayer
[1:34:24] you watch you be delivered are you
[1:34:26] ashamed of that though see that's what
[1:34:28] holds us so many times
[1:34:29] we're ashamed to take god at his word
[1:34:32] and we'll stay in the conditions that
[1:34:34] we're in
[1:34:35] but no let's we're not looking down on
[1:34:37] anybody oh we're all wretched sinners
[1:34:40] saved by grace
[1:34:42] you can come up to me and confess the
[1:34:43] most worst
[1:34:45] uh a thing that was ever fathomable but
[1:34:47] oh we're all looking through the eyes of
[1:34:49] the blood
[1:34:50] said oh brother if that's where you're
[1:34:52] at let's get you delivered
[1:34:54] as long as you're living defeated it's
[1:34:56] not helping the body
[1:34:58] get delivered so you can be in the game
[1:35:05] oh we're going somewhere
[1:35:09] we can stand and say i came from god
[1:35:12] but i'm going back to god we'll find a
[1:35:15] place to
[1:35:16] wind this down
[1:35:21] we'll just ask the musicians to come
[1:35:29] i love this quote out of the countdown
[1:35:33] says we've come to the age of astronauts
[1:35:36] we've moved out of the airplane age
[1:35:39] we've got more power now
[1:35:42] the astronaut age has come in what is it
[1:35:45] we've come into a spiritual age of
[1:35:47] astronauts
[1:35:48] going above it's the same spirit only
[1:35:51] more power
[1:35:52] only lifting higher can go higher see
[1:35:55] more
[1:35:56] believe more be more like christ
[1:36:00] lifting higher look you got complexes
[1:36:04] let's lift higher you're in bondage
[1:36:06] let's lift higher
[1:36:08] if you've got odd in your heart if
[1:36:09] you've got a root of bitterness
[1:36:12] come on saints let's rise above it
[1:36:15] this is the age of astronauts spiritual
[1:36:18] astronauts where we're moving up
[1:36:20] above all the things of the world
[1:36:24] not the automobile not the horse and
[1:36:26] buggy maybe
[1:36:29] set your wings to the winds of faith
[1:36:32] it's called the eagle age in the bible
[1:36:37] god calls us prophets eagle age we
[1:36:39] realize over in the bible we find a
[1:36:41] malachi 4 that will promise that in the
[1:36:43] last days now
[1:36:44] he likens his prophets to eagles
[1:36:48] he calls himself eagle he's the great
[1:36:51] jehovah eagle
[1:36:53] he's able to achieve to himself a bride
[1:36:56] he's going to
[1:36:57] in the last days be able to get a bride
[1:37:01] that the ministry that's so exactly that
[1:37:04] like a man as a wife has become one and
[1:37:06] when jehovah gets his people like him
[1:37:10] it's happening you're coming up higher
[1:37:14] oh you've believed this far but you're
[1:37:16] going further
[1:37:19] jehovah gets his people like him then he
[1:37:22] lives in his people
[1:37:24] they are one it fulfills the scripture
[1:37:28] oh you realize that you're fulfilling
[1:37:29] scripture
[1:37:31] just as jesus christ come to fulfill the
[1:37:34] old testament
[1:37:35] and john stood there said behold the
[1:37:38] lamb of god
[1:37:39] jesus christ the son of man ministry has
[1:37:42] come and
[1:37:42] tabernacled himself and made the word
[1:37:45] made flesh again
[1:37:46] and he's saying behold the bride behold
[1:37:49] my body
[1:37:50] the word made flesh with a ministry just
[1:37:53] like mine
[1:37:56] oh it fulfills the scripture exactly
[1:37:59] what he said in saint john 14 12 he that
[1:38:01] believeth on me
[1:38:03] the works that i do shall he do also
[1:38:05] also fulfills what jesus said would take
[1:38:08] place
[1:38:08] as it was in the days of sodom so shall
[1:38:11] it be at the coming of the son of man
[1:38:13] now is the astronaut age
[1:38:16] and the astronaut sees things that the
[1:38:18] horse rider automobiles or airplanes
[1:38:20] neither see
[1:38:22] he goes higher airplanes still down here
[1:38:27] oh justification is down here
[1:38:32] let's move up to sanctification
[1:38:33] sanctification down here
[1:38:36] let's move up to the gifts and operation
[1:38:39] down here let's move up into the
[1:38:40] revealed word the person of jesus christ
[1:38:43] let's move up higher bouncing around in
[1:38:46] the clouds and having blowouts and nip
[1:38:48] downs and everything else
[1:38:50] but he goes beyond the clouds of creeds
[1:38:52] and denominations
[1:38:54] moves on up into the heavens
[1:38:57] on away from everything the astronaut
[1:38:59] age
[1:39:00] we are living in the national age just
[1:39:02] as sure as god has testified by the
[1:39:03] natural happenings here
