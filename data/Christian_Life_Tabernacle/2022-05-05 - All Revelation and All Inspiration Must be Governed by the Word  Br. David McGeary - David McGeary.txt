Description:
All Revelation and All Inspiration Must be Governed by the Word
Br. David McGeary
May 4th, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

gracious father lord that's what we need is a surrender father just a great revelation in our heart that you have a will and father you have a way and that you have a plan and that you order the footsteps of the righteous father you nothing can pluck us out of your hand and you have something that you have for us and if we could just find that is our heart's desire we ask you to bless us tonight as we fellowship around your word in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you just grab your bibles and just open it real quick to the gospel of saint john and we just read the first couple verses of the gospel of saint john it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in jesus name we pray amen god bless you may be seated you know i want to take tonight as an opportunity i guess to say to reestablish and make sure that we understand a principle of god before we go forward i remember one time that a a a friend of mine he was going on a hunting expedition and uh the in the brochure and the information the guide had sent him he said uh the mountains are steep well he never really sought that out to really have a real understanding of what steep is and where he was going the mountains are steep like steep you know not like steep or steep but like this kind of steep and when he got back he said you know i should have done more research on what steep is and so i i so i just thought in my heart i thought sometimes it does this good to do a little bit of understanding and research about going forward and we know that the spirit's been moving and that people are being getting inspired and people are getting revelation but i want to bring us into remembrance tonight of something so that we hold it dear and then we have this principle as we go forward because we've been talking about god speaking to us by burdens we've been talking about god opening our hearts up to to have us have a desire to do something for god and and so uh with all that laying in front of us i think it's real important that we understand how we proceed or how we go forward uh you know someone talked me the day he says well we're doing all this but what's the order of it in other words how does it have to process what has to be done first what has to be done second you know and there's the order and there's a process to everything that's done and we have to remember that god has an order and god has a process of how everything that needs to be done and satan never changed what god wanted to do in essence but what he did he changed the process or he perverted it or he changed it and therefore because of the change it never reaches the exact completion it's like doing a recipe and leaving out one small ingredients you know what i mean it might taste okay you might get by with serving it but in all reality it's not really what it was supposed to be and and we don't want to come up short so i just want to review this with you we'll go into it more i chose to speak this sunday because i'm not going to be here this this coming sunday i'm going to be with my mother and celebrate a mother's day with her and i hope i have another opportunity but i've got to look at each opportunity like it's my last but so we're doing that and and then i'll be um i'll be back and preach the next wednesday and the following sunday uh brother ron peterson is going to be here with us uh that is the 15th so uh brother ron will be here ministering for us so if you can make special arrangements i know a lot of us aren't able to come back in the evening but maybe if we have enough ahead time up that we'll make a special effort to come back sunday evening this sunday that brother ron's up with us he's a long longtime friend of mine i will say this disclaimer out front that you'll hear stories and they may not all be true and i'll guarantee it they will be slightly exaggerated and and i know when ron starts to think about us being on this platform together there will probably be tears come to his eyes and he'll probably cry a little bit but it'll be worth it all so i think you really enjoy brother ron and you might find out some things about me but it's only through his perspective that it doesn't it doesn't mean it's reality at all so i don't really have a title but if if i was i would say that all inspiration and all revelation must be governed by the word okay and and now today and and and it is important that a person has an experience and i know coming from camp and that's what camp is for we preached a message called going beyond the camp using what the prophet of god preached but you have to go to camp before you can go beyond the camp and you heard i'm saying so a lot of times because young people and their battles with the world and most of the time uh when you have a meeting like that they're dealing with the battles they're dealing with satan they're dealing with satan's influence on your life they're dealing with the pulls the struggle the spirits that are pulling at you trying to bring you to an an experience but uh and so there's a lot of emphasis that is placed on the experience and so we're ministering tonight because you need to have a guide after the experience and what's going to be your guide for after the experience and so uh and we're going to play 27 minutes out of a message called doing god a service without it being his will and i'd like to read this little statement out of masterpiece and and tie the two a little bit together before we go further it says in the masterpiece in paragraph 118 but you can't hide a germanized seed okay it's got to come forth because why the great sculptor is on the job he's going to build again he the seed went down the word but the great sculpture's on the job and you can't hide it so how many leave the great sculpture still on the job amen he's still carving away at me you know what i mean but that and it can't hide so there's going to be things about the genuine church the genuine bride that has characteristics about her that become identifiable now today there's a lot of move in the spirit not just in the message but in the world because a lot of people are led here led there i i god told me to do this god told me to do that now there's got to be a way to discern that you you understand and there's got to be something that god's given you to make choices by something that's apart from feeling you understand because numbers and groups of numbers create a lot of feeling a lot of kids do things that they never would do alone wrong things they know that's wrong because they get caught up in the crowd two or three are doing it or four or five and so they lose their personal identity they take on the identity of the group they participate in a group activity and then they suffer as an individual you know what i'm saying so uh i have to say as a pastor i'm extremely proud of our congregation i mean my buttons pop wherever our we go and i think part of the reasons we are what we are because we listen to tapes and we put the words of the prophet first so what we're talking about tonight is is that and we'll listen to a little bit and i'll make a few comments but we're talking about what must govern okay you know what govern means it means direct control be in charge of what must be in charge of your inspiration what must be in charge of your revelation what pathway should you take after you've had an experience and so we want to establish these things because it'll make you smarter better uh christians and so if god's on the scene and the masterpiece is working those that he's dealing with will have this characteristic okay it'll be one of the things that they know that you've had a genuine experience that you are his child because you do it the way the father does it so we're going to start in paragraph 26 and and i and by no means am i trying to shorten the message or cut up the message or chop the message up but the prophet of god said you read a portion of it you go back and read it again so the the message is available to you uh to listen to all of it there's more in this message than the part that i'm going to play but i want us not to be established in a second-hand revelation i want us to be established in the things that the prophet of god said so what he's going to talk about is how you go about something and when you have an inspiration and you have a revelation how do you go forward with it you know what's my next step okay i got this great idea i really want to do this i feel led to do it i have a holy unction i feel inspired that is not what governs you that may be what motivates you that may be what drives you that may be what stimulates you but it's not what controls you what controls you is the word so let's listen to this 27 minutes and uh then we'll just talk about it i i it's a teaching it's just a time we don't have to have a revival every time we come together you know what i mean we don't have to shout the roof off we don't have to kick the walls down to be christians you know what i mean we can be solid as a rock take the word and go out i've sat down with people to eat and every bite is mmm and then they eat some salad this is so good and and they're just absolutely having some kind of jubilee you know and i'm thinking every meal give me a break all you want to do in life is eat you know i wish i didn't have to eat it's a waste of time but anyway so we can be solid in the word right anchor take it in our heart know it's a fact no it's the truth don't it is what it is we don't have to show any emotion on it but yet it's the rule of law everybody thinks they've come out of the law no we're under a law we're under a different rule of law and that's what we're talking about we're talking about the law of inspiration and revelation being governed by the word i hope you enjoy this next 26 minutes we'll finish up and we won't be too long god bless you don't you love listening to your prophet aren't you glad you have him to guide you and that god in his wisdom created an instrument to store the food up in the storehouse amen that's the storehouse that's where the food is is in those sermons so god bless you as we listen we're in the end time now the lord bless you richly i get started on that and forget about time we're going to fade quick pretty quickly into eternity anyhow and now in saint mark the seventh chapter and the seventh verse to bring a text to this subject that was just read in first chronicles 13 to make a text for this i want mark 7 7 in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrine the commandments of man now i know nothing but the message the lord has given me and that's all i can speak on and now i'm going to speak on a subject this morning which i thought would be good and tonight i want to speak on meat in due season if the lord willing spiritual food and due season and how to receive it now you know this morning trying to do god a service without being the will of god god is sovereign and we see here what david done in the scripture reading of first chronicles 13 and he was his intentions were good but god does not [Music] give us merits on good intentions there's only one way to serve god that's by doing his will at his command and god being sovereign there's no one to tell him what to do or how to do it he does it the way he knows the right way to do it and that makes me feel good and that ought to make all of us feel good and i'm sure it does for one would have it coming this way and one have it going that way and one the other way but one great thing again about god he's not left us now without knowing what's the truth and how to do it he wouldn't be just to punish us for doing something that we didn't know how it was going to be done and then let us stumble into something he's not that kind of a god he's a god that speaks the word and expects his children to believe it and therefore he knows what's best and when to do it and how to do it we have our ideas of it but he knows and then if he set up a system that what he's going to do and didn't tell us what was going to happen and how it was going to happen then we stumbling at it would be would be justified in in our stumblings or trying to do something each one would be justified but there's only one way and that is his word and another thing david here we see that in his heart he wanted to do something that was good he had no bad motive or no bad objective but the house or the ark of the lord was away from the the people and he wanted to bring the ark of god back to its place so the people would consult god about the things that they wanted instead of of just letting it go we what if brother blair and the father this little boy said well too bad child just got hurt killed i guess just something happened but they went quickly to god what the little lady and her husband minister of the gospel a few nights ago or days when that little lady had that bursted spine that just stood up the doctor said she'll be paralyzed all her life what if the husband she had said well honey we'll just uh console ourselves to that but quickly they've done something about it it went to god how many things in the bible could we refer to of how when people get in trouble get to god well then in them days they had only one meeting place where they could meet god and that was at the ark under the blood that's the only meeting place yet under the blood the mercy seat was sprinkled to give mercy to the worshiper or the asker when he come to ask the petition of god god had a special routine the way you had to go to about that and he wouldn't accept anything else you wouldn't accept any other provision just the way he fixed it recently i just preached on a message many of you know about it that only one provided place that god meets the worshiper the place that he said i'll put my name if we can find the church that he put his name in then we got the place he said i will not bless you in all the gates just the gates that i put my name in i'll put it in one place and you've got to meet me there that's the only place i'll meet you and we found out through there where he put his name that's the only place that he meets the worshiper and his name with jesus christ god name is jesus christ jesus said i come in my father's name every son comes in his father's name and he came in the name of the father and there's not another name under heaven given among men worse called methodist baptist presbyterian church of christ whatever it might be done is only one meeting place that god meets man and that's when he's in jesus christ only place and all these old things back here are the old testament type that i want you to clearly understand it now it's a sunday school lesson i've got some scriptures and notes written down here now i thought that this would help you to understand as all the old things happen for examples to us now we find that god had a way of doing things but david just being blessed of god like he had to become king he just thought that he would just do something for god anyhow and he never went about it in the right way we noticed god reveals his word in his own predestinated season now how can martin luther annoyed about the message today how could the presbyterians how could martin the catholic church know martin luther's message how could john wesley of note luther's message how could wesley a note the pentecostal message or how could the pentecostals know this message see he reveals it in his seasons because it is a seed and as it grows and matures he reveals himself like the heat of the sun to open up when it's tender and young bring it out of the ground the seed then give it its leaves in another stage of the sun hot sun will kill it if it's the ripening seed a ripening time so he regulates the sun and regulates nature to meet his word he regulates the church the predestination of the bride to meet the season that they are living in even nature itself tells us today as we see the nations breaking the earth sinking in the handwriting is on the wall we see the church in the states it's in we see the bride in the states she's in and we know by nature that the church is getting ready to leave what a glorious time it's a time that all the prophets long to see this hour now he reveals his word only in its season martin luther read the same bible we did wesley read the same bible martin luther did pentecostals read the same bible we read jesus read the same bible that the pharisees read but they had trying to keep the corn in an early stage when it was ripening they failed to see their hour now david has done the same thing here god reveals this word in the season and to whom he chooses to reveal it to god chooses who he reveals it to he chose that before the foundation of the world all of his doings were foreknown by him hidden from man he just reveals him as he will it is his chosen season his chosen person and he never did choose a party or sec it's a chosen person how he does it who is it that will dare to correct him and said our lord you made a mistake by putting this man in the ministry this man doesn't believe like we believe who's going to tell god he's wrong in it it would take somebody that's a little more of a delinquent than i am to telling that he knows what he's doing he knows who to choose and who not to choose what to do and when to do it no matter how much we think that a certain person is qualified to do a certain job god knows who's qualified for the time in the season or the time and the right time to do it and the real true christian the real true believer in god waits upon the lord for these things wait on your ministry if you feel the call be sure that it's god be sure that it's right be sure that it's timely of what you're saying the bible said they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with the wings like an eagle they shall run and not be weary if they walk do not faint notice david king of israel just anointed samuel poured all upon him and he was chosen of god to be king of israel and david got this revelation to bring the ark of the lord up to the city of david now there's nothing wrong but you see david went at it wrong now it looks like if a man like that would get a revelation a great man like god's chosen king the greatest king that ever lived on earth outside of christ our guest was david because uh christ is the son of david now the greatest man freshly anointed coming from the very presence of god got a revelation to do something for god and wanted to do it for god but the revelation was wrong now that's a great thing you know deal with our subject trying to do god a service without being called to do it notice david got the revelation and notice it was not the prophet nathanael that got the revelation it was david the king that got the revelation neither was nathanael consulted about it he never asked nathanael but did you see her in first chronicles he consulted captains of thousands and captains of hundreds he never consulted nathanael he consulted the people and he consulted also the priests and the theologians of that day the scribes and the theologians david consulted first said if it this be a god let us go down and bring the ark of the covenant of our god up into the city and let us consult god before we do things but said in the days of saul they left off consulting god by the the the ark yurim your thundum they left off doing that david said now let's get back to god all of us let's get back to the right thing let's go down and get the ark and bring it here bring the presence of god in other words into the city let's hold a revival let's bring the people back but he got the revelation which seemed to be good but it wasn't the will of god instead of asking the source that he should have asked he consulted his captains because he just become king and he followed that line of thinking that his chief captains and his great man then he went into the church nominal and asked that they could have the revival the priests the scribes the captains of thousands the captains of hunters and he consulted them what's this the will of the lord and they said it was but you see he failed to ask the main resource that god always deals through he failed to get it now his intention was good his motive was good his objective was good to bring a revival in the city bring the people back to god but he never consulted the way god told him to do it see even all the people agreed in the priest and that the king was right they needed the ark back in the city now they needed the presence of god they needed a revival but god had not promised to reveal his word in its season to the peoples he never promised to reveal it to the king in the season god doesn't change a bit he didn't promise to do that no matter how sincere what good motives and what good objectives and how people want those things and see the need of it there is a will of god to be carried out in these things that's what i want to drive down tight for i want to make this soul that you have to see it if if the spirit of god dwells in you and that's the reason i'm lingering so long here not taking you people's time on a telephone and on the hook up but i want you to see it if you run out of time then get the tape that there no matter how much is needed how much everybody agrees that it's needed how much that that is the truth there's yet one thing to find out is that the will of god how many believes that's timely amen okay now there is so much there right and that's that's what we want to do he says this is a sunday school lesson uh this is a thing this is a thing that we've got to make sure that uh that uh there's there's a way to go about about it there's something that has to be consulted and and everything's got to be uh checked out you know and it it's like uh the prophet of god said you know they said uh well that's the you know that's the way uh the priest did it you know so i i just want to read this now instead of playing it but just to continue on with what brother branham's saying this is paragraph 93 if they can find that and put it out so there's something that brother ben kept referring to and it's consulting right he asked this group and he asked this group and he asked the people and he asked that and he asked that and he consulted with captains he consulted with this but he never consulted with the source that god had which was nathaniel he never asked him because what does nathanael had the ability to go to god and talked it over with god and bring an answer and if he would have talked to nathanael he would have went about it the right way so remember his desire was what good his revelation was true but he went about it the what the wrong way is it possible there's a wrong way to do the right thing that's a paradox isn't it but if you build anything on shifting sands right if it's not built on the right foundation it won't stand you know and a lot of people have received blessings and they've received experiences and then they've went and tried to build their christian existence going forward on that feeling you know okay remember we talked about weaponizing it right well the only way you can ever weaponize it is to make it something that lasts and there's only one thing that lasts and that's his word look you know i if i could just have some way within me to express to you and and as a pastor and have an understanding is that we need to be led by god's word not our idea of god's word not our interpretation of the scriptures not our conclusion get three or four guys to conclude together and say yes this but to be able to go back to the source and have it anchored in god's word so listen as we just read this i think the brothers can put it up there he said he says now now close now close listen let's listen close don't miss this now see the first thing when they consulted the priest consulted the dignitaries consulted the military consulted the congregation the neighborhood to get together for this great meeting to come they failed to do it right they didn't consult god and by doing so not going back and see what time it was now this is something we don't really do very often is consult the hour you know some things aren't appropriate you understand if your house is on fire you don't try to move the bedroom furniture right you go grab your documents you go grab whatever pictures that you hold dear that things that are irreplaceable but you don't get a hold of things that are that are replaceable because you haven't consulted the hour and a lot of people don't consult the time now things you know things may have been okay in a different day in a different hour you know what i'm saying but now things are in a different light so things what maybe people could got away with before and we could relax on before we've got to consult the hour so we certainly can't be consulting the nominal christian world right what songs they're singing how they're worshiping you know why because they're worshiping they're going forward like they're going to live forever they don't believe jesus might show up tomorrow they don't believe they have to take inventory they don't believe they have to apply the token they don't believe the holy spirit's going to look in their closet to see what they're storing up they're not they don't know what kind of things they wear and the styles they wear and everything you know and and and you got to remember that the words the word culture is of man every culture the way the japanese people dress the way the chinese dress the philippines the indians uh uh the africans the americans all of that has got to conform to god's word there is no public opinion outside of god's word certain cultures wear tight dresses certain cultures wear dresses with pants you know but it's still got to come back to the word of god it's not given for us to make determinations god knows what's right god knows what's best god knows what he's doing god laid down the plan okay so you've got to understand he has got the answer and we'll read those quotes right before i close tonight but he says so they they consult every they consult everything but they didn't consult god and by doing so not going back to see what time it was oh brother listen what time are we living in consult the time consult the hour why are things as strict as they are in the message of the hour why are things as precise as they are in the message of the hour why is the word so steadfast in the message of the hour because this is the hour that satan appears as an angel of life and he gained access to the name of jesus christ at the nicaea council and he's been building up to this day building up to this day using scriptures using jesus name using everything to build a system to say it's god's will and everything but even a revelation and an inspiration has to be governed by god's word when i say god's word didn't brother braham just say they all read the same bible it's the revealed word that governs the revealed word said in the last days i'll send you malachi 4 5. i'll send you elijah the prophet so he can turn your hearts back to the hearts of the father and what did our fathers do they all read the same bible the scribes and pharisees did but they saw by revelation the fulfillment of the word for the hour what your hearts are turned back to is the revelation of the fulfillment of god's word for the hour so now you see by divine revelation you have a path a pathetic voice to consult oh but we still consult the preachers i'm happy if you come to me for counseling it makes it a lot easier with me if you've prayed about it and looked and found out what the prophet of god said about it because if you come with me all we're going to do is try to find out what the prophet of god said about it because i got confidence in this word right here so let's just read as we're reading on listen what's the age what's the hour that we're living in it's not time for these things that they're talking about hmm they've passed judgment is on hand now you can see it breaking you remember the rock on the mountain judgment hour you remember the revelation or the vision of the bride just keep her in step don't let her get out of step and and just think of it because as we read it says here now notice upon the shoulders of the priest and david and the and all the priests that really ought to have known better but what was it the priest should have known better the scribes the theologians should have known better because the word of god said not to do that but what didn't they do they didn't consult it and today when they want to say oh jesus christ isn't the same yesterday here forever that's mental telepathy that's this that or the other thing they failed to see the promised word oh that was a day gone by let me tell you something that's happening in this message right now they don't want to sing songs the way the prophet sung it they don't want to have church the way the prophet done it they don't want to dress the way the prophet have done it they feel there's a new revival a new spirit this new revival that we're experiencing will take us back to this word it'll take us back to what the prophet of god said it'll open our eyes to what the prophet of outside that it's not built on feelings it's not built on emotion as wonderful as the testimonies are if you don't know how to go forward with that testimony and govern your inspiration and govern your revelation by the message of the hour god's revealed word you'll get in a wreck and then you'll wonder was my experience right and you'll go through this whole great big doubt battle and you could have saved yourself a lot of trouble i sat down watching some people play cards the other day and they all had their cards fanned out and have a bunch of chips on the table and they're playing and they changed the color of the chips they changed the picture on the cart i didn't yell at them i just said i certainly if i was you guys i'd find out what the prophet of god said about it christians bowling now in the message how many of those just be honest how many knows what brother brown said about about bowling and bowling alleys he said it's one of the most foul places more evil spirit and that's where a lot of adultery goes on we're going to go bowling that's cool let's all do it we're all young people we're all together we're all going to have fun bowling great what did the prophet say well why is he against poland i don't know he knows he knows why it's the hour it's the time a lot of this music that that we have to deal with it's new now listen to what david says here watch how he follow down he says he said he said he says and today when they say oh jesus christ isn't the same yesterday and forever other words it's not the same word it's not the same message okay he says that's mental telepathy that's this that the other whatever they say in others it's not just mental telepathy it's what brother branham didn't know about what we'd have here today he didn't know we'd have cell phones he didn't know we'd have computers jesus knew and he still preached the gospel he preached why is that because it's done by revelation and what's revelation governed by the word okay he how many times your brother man says how can you say it's the holy ghost when it doesn't line up to this word and then to explain it to everybody he preached anointed ones at the end time which were people that were led by revelation led by inspiration but they weren't governed by the what the word i've had a lot of good sisters probably most of them preach better than i do god told me to preach they preach the socks off there it's not god's will it's not his word well i'm inspired you may be i'm anointed you may be but inspiration and revelation is governed by the word it doesn't govern itself now do you remember what the prophet said would it be right for i'll read it just close up on reading that i want you to understand there's a reason why god does everything that he does the reason he sent this message if the reason he preached every sermon he preached the way he preached it the way he put his sentences i'll go as far because that even the way that his the prophet the way his mouth is formed to speak words is of god he says david said oh well now wait a minute upon the shoulders of the priest that was back when moses come out sure we'll put it on a new cart today i got a revelation of it you see it so the the one thing that we're talking about is in everything you make consult the hour and consult the profit if you don't get something to be able to consult the hour look at what time we're in there's a lot of things that are lawful but they're not expedient for our growth they're not expedient for our preparation for a rapture they're not expedient to give to give our time to to give our effort to to give our prep time to they're not expedient you consult the hour i really believe that if if we could get young people to get the revelation of consulting the hour the amount of time they spend playing video games would dissipate rapidly if they had an understanding of a standard that they needed to meet in a in a position that they needed to come in you know what i mean what i'm saying is you can't always do everything fighting against the devil you know you don't need the holy ghost to get free of the devil that's not the only reason you get the holy ghost because you've been haunted with demons and you've fought with demons and that's great that's what the holy ghost is for it's to cast those demons out but now those demons are cast out what's going to guide you how are you going to make the next decision how are you going to grow forward how are you going to build on that experience you going to go pack the ark in on some shoulders or or on a cart the revelation was right bring the ark but the revelation had to be governed by the word the inspiration was great i feel inspired to do this i inspired to talk to this person i inspired to do that do you want to know something you got to go back you got to run that through god's word you got to go back to how the prophet of god said you go about it i'm not ashamed to follow a man especially this man because everything i've seen in the last 72 years has failed i've seen ministry and interpretations and people flow down the river of time like like everything and every time you go back to their demise is they built on an inspiration they built on a revelation that got pie in the sky one fella was out in the water one day and the sun clouds broke and a beam of light come down on him and he had this thought and he built everything on that thought and he went and led hundreds and hundreds of people into a interpretation of the seals book and it was never based on the word it was based on experience it was based on an inspiration it was based on and then they preached that inspiration inspiration is inspiring i know people that if i would allow in this pulpit they could come and inspire you and you'd all sign up for amway they would convince you that you could do more for god if you were a part of amway and you weren't lazy and someone could provide you a way to do something for god just by simply talking to your neighbor not only could you build the church you could share the gospel and you'd be signing up for amway the trouble is amway ain't the way god provided to preach the gospel television isn't the way that god provided to preach the gospel oh there's people that want to get a television show because what's not happening they're not understanding that they've got to consult new songs new music new games you know a lot of the stuff that goes on of the mixing of the boys and girls now we're getting mixed volleyball games mixed softball game mix this mix that you know there's a lot of reason there's separation you know there's a lot of compromising situations in certain things you know and i'm not i i don't want to become a high priest where i'm the interpreter of the law you know i think i think there's a lot of things that you you can do consult your mothers consult the other the elderly sisters and when i say this i don't mean elders like elderly because i'm going to say consult sister leslie if you don't know how to dress or if something's appropriate or if your shoes are appropriate or if your hair produce appropriate you know what i mean and and and there's a a lot of things that are starting to go on because we're failing to go back and run things through the abcs you know hair plating is starting to become a thing you know what plaque thing is it's where they weave things into their hair and and different ornaments and different gold and things and they start weaving them in their hair nobody says it almost doesn't matter anything this is a new generation this is a young generation you know they we do all those things i don't want the new generation it's too late for me to be popular i'm going to face the judgment that what he said it's too late for those things they they don't recognize they they don't recognize the hour that we've we've passed that already do you know what a community what they what our room it's not time for these things that they're talking about they may have been okay but not now so we're talking about going forward and i'm just closing with just a review of some of the things that he said so you know if it's anchored down in our hearts real good god is sovereign and we see this is paragraph 29 reading it again god is sovereign and we see here what david done in the scripture reading in first chronicles 13. his intentions were good we're not governed by what intentions now someone might have a good intention and everybody wants to jump on board but listen what he said but god does not give merit on good intentions there's only one way to serve god that's by doing his will and his commandments command and his by doing his there's only one way to serve god that's by doing his will at his command in other words doing his will the way he commands it to be done you know there's a way to correct somebody in the scripture you go to them in private you pray first you remove the beam right you regard what he's doing as a sliver as a minor thing you go to him not to condemn him but to draw him out of the flames to catch him you go in the right spirit and if he don't come then you go take somebody else with you love hides a multitude of sin okay he said and god being sovereign there's no one to tell him what to do or how to do it he does it the way he knows the right way to do it and that makes me feel good and it ought to make all of us feel good and i'm sure it does for one would have it coming in this way and one would have it going that way and one going that way and the other way in other words what kind of mess we would be in if god wasn't sovereign and didn't have a way to do things and then what would draw us off i'm telling you when some of the doctrines that's come around in here they were running the walls they were praising god they were shouting it was the greatest thing the rapture was going to happen in the morning but nobody ever went back and found out what the prophet of god said about it and the scriptures family states study to show yourself approved find out what brother branham said about it don't just go because the crowd's going that way that that's you've got to be careful that you don't come under my influence because i'm just as fleshly as anybody and and you know the only benefit i have is that god's obligated to you somewhere down the line to correct me and get me straight if you're praying for me if you're filtering it if you read something in one of these books or you listen to a tape and you've studied a message or you read it and you find out my goodness brother david said just the opposite and you hold me up in prayer and say lord make this right or you come to me and say brother what does that say about that and the light bulb goes off in my heart it says oh i was leaning too much on this and now here this puts it in balance and then we can come forward but you understand the importance when i say the word i just don't mean this the bible this kills but the living spirit right everybody read the same bible but there was a living spirit that came out of the bible and spoke the portion of that word that was revealed to our day right we understand that all right so he said he says he knows the right way and that makes me feel good now we go down and jump here he said and another thing paragraph 32 and another thing david here we see that in his heart he wanted to do something that was good so this is not guidance for sinners this is guidance for people that want to do something for god how many of us came out of camp wanting to do something for god how many of us came out of camp wanting to live better how many came out of con camp inspired and with revelation now we want to take that and totally understand god's got a way for me to do what's on my heart god's got a way for me to testify god's got a way for me to live god's got a way for me to confront my someone that's done me wrong god's got a way for me to make things right god's got a way he knows the way let's consult him and seek out the answer and do it his way i've seen it a lot of times where people get the idea to confess your faults one to another and a whole congregation will get worked out and the people start standing up in church confessing his fault it's not the way god does things and they've got a whole church hating each other by the end of service because everybody spilled the dirt on everybody i'm telling you inspiration and revelation can lead you into a lot of places you don't belong if you don't learn to govern it by the word he says now let's listen here in paragraph 35 well then in them days they had only one meeting place where they could meet god and that was was the ark under the blood that's the only meeting place is under the blood the mercy seat was sprinkled to give mercy and to the worshiper to the asker when he come to petition god and god had a special routine the way it had to go about that he wouldn't accept anything else he wouldn't accept any other provision just the way he fixed it so that in that day that was their provision they had a certain way of doing things god's never given up the right to do things his way right and aren't you glad he's revealed to us that and that's what we're talking about okay and and he says here he says now notice in paragraph 39 we notice god revealed his word in his own predestinated season right he says he reveals it in the season because it's seed and it grows and matures he reveals himself just continuing on to 46. like in the heat of the sun it opened up and when it's tender young and bring it out of the ground the seed then give its leaves in another stage of the sun the hot sun would kill it if it's the ripening seed or ripening time he regulates the sun and regulates nature to meet his word he regulates the church the predestinated bride to meet the season that they're living in i mean these things are fabulous fabulous what the things he's saying in other words we think man it's a fire you know he regulates it he's got the season regulated he knows just how much sun to apply he knows how much inspiration to give you because you're still growing you're still maturing he gives you a place where you have a counselor a prince of peace a mighty god he's got all this beautiful things laid out for us but just think of that isn't that a beautiful statement he says he regulates the church in other words he hasn't taken his hand off her he hasn't taken control inspiration in revelation is not a ticket to run out on your own it's got to be back brought back through the word now you take that revelation and that inspiration and you put the word to it now you've got a weapon buddy because you're standing on a promise isn't that right like healing are you healed when you have no more symptoms are you healed when you're not sick anymore why are you healed you're healed because it's written it's written by his stripes we are healed it's written so what's your evidence that you've been healed the evidence is that he took the stripes right he was striped he was beaten right he was whipped was he not why did god allow that for him to be whooped or beaten or scourged the bible calls it for one reason only that you could be healed your evidence of healing is that the scourging took place and it is written therefore it's an evidence of things you're hoping for that you haven't seen how do you know you're healed brother david you're still sick how do you how do you know you're i don't i i'm not i know i'm healed because it's written by his stripes i haven't seen it yet true and i'm hoping for it true but i have an evidence that it's coming the fact that it's here or not here does not change the fact that he was scourged that's history and he was only scourged for one reason was that you could be healed and the story simple it is written it is written that governed jesus was he hungry yes could he be a stone turn stones into bread yes could he have cast them stuff down from the temple yes but what was he governed by the word how did he respond it is written so when you get an inspiration and you get an in revelation take it back to what is written then you can say it is written when he came up talking to those guys he says wasn't it written that the son of man must suffer and then in three days rise up isn't it what written isn't it written why do you think there's 1100 tapes why do you think they're stored up why do you think they're preached the way they preached and the order they're preached in and how they're so full of nuggets so we can go and the spirit searcheth the deep things even the deep things of god so we can find where it is written paul told then he study the to show thyself the proof find out what the word says about it the inspiration's wonderful the revelation is wonderful but it's got to be meticulously carried out according to god's word and that's what he says here he says he and then this again and 42 now he reveals his word only in its season martin luther read the same bible we did wesley read the same bible martin luther did pentecostal reads the same bible re-read jesus read the same bible that the pharisees read but they had trying to keep the corn in the early stage when it was ripening they failed to see their hour let's don't keep cap in the early stage as the prophet of god recalled it of the cycle of revival and then another revival and then next year another revival you who got prayed for you should never have to go in that type of prayer line again not if you know how to go forward in god's word you accept what he did for you he separated me he freed me i'm here now at this meeting i'm here in every church service to hear god's word to make intercessions for those who don't have his word to pray that the spirit of god will fall on somebody who doesn't have it but i know that my footsteps are led by the lord how does he lead by his word he says and so we don't want to be held back in early stages we want to grow as a church we want to mature i'm not going to be here sunday so you're getting sunday whether you like it or not i'm just sorry i'm the way i am who is it that will dare to correct him say now lord you meant you made a mistake by putting this man in the ministry that's one of my favorite quotes this man doesn't believe like we believe who's going to tell god he's wrong in it it would take somebody that's a little more uh how they say it's going to take somebody that's a little more of a a delinquent than i am to tell him that he knows what he's doing he knows whom to choose and whom not to choose what to do and what not to do no matter how much we think that a certain person is qualified to do a certain job god knows who's qualified for the time and the season or the time and the right time to do it you know he's leading up to the five must a real christian a true believer in god waits upon the lord for these things wait on your ministry if you feel a call be sure that it's god be sure that it's right and be sure it's timely of what you're saying and we've that's a good place to stop there's a lot of preachers a lot of people preaching but their message isn't timely it's true but he what did he say make sure that your message matches up with the time that is what god's trying to tell the church how would you like if i took the next year preaching malachi 4 5 there's a promise of a prophet there's a promise of restoration we're moving god's moving he's bringing people in but we can't let people come in with inspiration and revelation and let them change the basic fundamental truth of the message of the hour and the way things are conducted according to god's word and don't get mad at me if you think that i'm throwing a bucket of flames on somebody that seems to be on fire because i know something about god i don't know a lot but from experience i know that god will line you up with his word and it's hard to kick against the prick and the harder you fight the harder he squeezes and he'll take the breath out of you if you're his he stopped an airplane to get a prophet to a woman standing on a fence he'll do whatever it takes for you but he's never going to do one thing outside his word and this isn't on tape that i know of it it's all on tape in different ways but my friend has gone on to be with the lord doug mccues shared it with me he said brother david brother ben told me this personally he said brother doug i don't care how much you how much you fast you can fast tell your skin and bones i don't care how much you holler you can holler till you have no voice i don't care how much you pray you can pray and cry till there's not another tear in your eye he says i don't care how much you do god's only going to do for you what he said you're going to do for you don't ask god to change his mind about the word let's ask god to reveal his word so we can do it his way i think god's moving i think we're going to encounter a lot of new believers that don't understand everything that are going to inject all kinds of their ideas all kinds of the ways that they would do things all their inspirations all their revelations all the things that they're seeing i'm happy for that but if you've got an absolute you're not moved by the inspiration you're not moved by the revelation because all inspiration and revelation must be governed by god's word it's a great message to listen to but i just i really wanted to share that with you that have come out and that are moving forward in the lord especially a young christian i wish that i could have got associated with the understanding of what it meant to have the messenger of the hour to be my consultant and all things a lot earlier in my experience it would have saved me a lot of dumb things that i did that i really thought were super and i thought i was saving the world and i was spinning my wheels and wasting time and one example or one instruction from the messenger straightened me out and we all have equal access and it doesn't change for me or for you it's all the same god's sovereign he does it his way let's find that way let's do it his way and you'll be successful in your inspiration you'll be successful in your revelations you'll be successful in your intentions you'll be successful but when you create a program for yourself and you imagine the outcome is going to be a certain way and you don't filter it back through god's word you'll find out it never turns out the way you thought it would it always turns out the way god's word said it would god bless you keep me in prayers i go see your mom i cover your prayer the brothers just well i'm trusting that we'll have this back part of the parking lot open sunday and we've they've already talked to you about some people parking down the street just be real careful to listen to the instructions of the deacons follow their instructions even if you don't think it's right if you have a complaint come to me and if i think your complaint is just or i like you i'll write you up a parking pass okay so otherwise let's let's let the brothers help us with our situation especially on may 15 where we're expecting some people to be coming in from out of town we're going to have to give up some space and do some things but we can do it can't we if we do it his way if we do it in his spirit and we do it by god's word we'll never fail we have an evidence right it is written it is written god bless you let's stand together musicians come and we'll sing i feel like traveling on how many feel like traveling on i want to i want to travel on and i want to travel up i want to go
