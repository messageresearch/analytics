Description:
That's Me!
Br. David McGeary
October 2, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

15th chapter you know Annie Joy I felt bad I didn't have you come up and have your picture taken with everybody I'll make it up to you I'll have a special photo session just for you anyway let's turn to this scripture I thought it was wonderful I enjoyed having sister Eleanor with us and at the dedication today that was wonderful uh I like to read this little scripture just make a few comments this evening and read a statement to us to encourage our hearts and to kind of build along the line that uh we were speaking of this morning so in the 15th chapter of Genesis uh uh these words are spoken and this is the 13th verse of the 15th chapter it says and he said unto Abram okay we'll start with the 12th verse and when the sun was gone down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo a horror of great Darkness fell upon him and he and he said unto Abram no absuredly that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years so also and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward they shall come out with great substance Heavenly Father we ask you to place your word in your precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated you know that's uh that's a tremendous prophecy there that the Lord spoke to Abraham and and telling Abraham that that thy seed he and you look at all the great uh things that he's talked he walked with Abraham he gave Abraham a promise Abraham didn't have the son then God's going to give them a son and then he says thy seed they're going to be in us a foreign land a land that's not theirs and they're going to be afflicted for 400 years and they're they're going to be brought and they're gonna I'm gonna judge that nation and they're going to come out with great substance and I I just thought in my heart and I don't know how to express this I don't want to take long because of communion but God makes a prophecy and yet that prophecy is fulfilled by human beings God's word has got to become flesh in order for it to manifest no no prophecy or no promise can set in space and you look at this great prophecy he said that another place he spoke about him being delivered by a mighty hand and and so you look at all the things that had to fall in place for this prophecy to be fulfilled first of all they had they had to go into Egypt and out of Egypt and there had to rise up a pharaoh that didn't know each one of those people are playing their part in the Fulfillment of this prophecy so here's a prophecy that's been spoken now in order for that prophecy to come to pass because God can't lie that there's got to be there's got to be players if I could use that term there's got to be uh people that are are called and positioned and placed circumstances have to arise this prophecy absolutely set the course of history all history now concerning the children of Israel and and concerning uh uh Abraham's seed has all been now a course has all been set and in order for this course to be set if everything had to fall into place everything had to fall into line a lot of times we think that we're just drifting and that that we're just going through life and all the things that are happening that are going on and happening around us now are are not uh uh are are just without a form they're without void they're not making any sense there's lawlessness everywhere there's there there's a crazy thinking on every hand fellowshipping with the brother at lunch today he said he said the greatest thing that everybody's talking about in Europe the brother is from the Netherlands and he was saying that the big conversation all through Europe is now gender identity and and they teach it in the schools and and uh uh a gender X and it's uh for those that are don't want to identify with one or the other and you think all this is is is is uh uh uh what what's going on we ask ourselves what's happening he said my daughter 11 year old daughter came home from school and she said Mama how do I choose between being a boy or a girl how do I make this choice and he's sitting back he says well how did you have that question now so you you know that we're that we're in some of the strangest times that we ever had but you understand that that the reason that we're in these times because he said as it was in the days of Sodom and it was in the days of Gomorrah so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man you understand a lot of he he didn't okay it's it's not necessarily the coming you know what I mean but the revealing of them we're in the day that the ministry of the son of man and the word that was spoken through the prophet messenger is being revealed but the condition is here because it was prophesied to be here as it was in the days of Noah and we know that the scripture says they were married and given into marriage they went to and fro they traveled they did those prophecies are all here and we find ourselves in the prophetic condition that's prophesied and and so you you sit back and you go back it in Genesis and we find out that everything that was prophesied in every seed that was sown in Genesis they were they were first sown in Genesis it's okay all the seeds that were sowing in Genesis we find out through the ages they've all come to fruition they've all they've all blossomed and now they're we're sitting in the day that we're in the hour of all the manifestation of these things taking form so nothing's out of kilter everything has to be a just perfect according to God's word so we find out that out of this prophecy many scriptures were fulfilled because the word of God says that I'll send you a prophet like an unto Moses and so Moses had to come up we know he was the type so how are the children are going to come out of bondage out of Affliction and come out with great substance how is God going to bring this to pass that he's going to bring this fast with one he's got to have a proper child born he's got to have a deliverer born because he's got to have someone that's going to go there and deliver them with a mighty hand so that prophecy now has got to take on a form of Flesh somebody has to rise up and and be brought on the scene in order for this prophecy to live through their their being and become manifested and made known this if this if this never took form it would have never been fulfilled it can only when it takes form becomes flesh and is lived out that's when it's fulfilled it's okay it wasn't it the prophecy how are they going to come out with much substance I think that's amazing they they be pillaged Egypt I mean they they they borrowed money that they had no intention of paying back they did they took everything they took plants seeds uh trees everything I love the movie The Ten Commandments when they start coming out their camels are packed though they didn't have anything but they left just exactly the way this scripture said it would be for the conditions were right God created the conditions he had to raise up for Moses he had to do great signs and great wonders because they were going to come out by a mighty hand with Great Signs and great ones there had to be one that rised up that would be a type of the Savior so everything in its place everything has to come in its position everything has to come in its order because God uses man to fulfill his prophecy somebody has to come down to fulfill that great prophecy and the conditions had to be there to fulfill this prophecy we realize there's a prophecy that says this eve will not be like the last Eve this eve won't fall but so but she's got to be in Eden she's got to be faced with the Devil she's got to be faced with science in education she she was faced with the tree of knowledge and but we know the doctrine of serpent seed it wasn't no apple another word Satan was offering him his science his wisdom what he knew about the order of man what he knew about things that's what he was going to educate her God didn't need education because God was going to do everything by his word but Satan wanted that he wanted to have a the uh dominance he wanted to have a kingdom he wanted to have it Eden and he wanted to Reign and he wanted to sit on the throne and take the place of the stars of God all those things were prophesied now we find ourselves in the condition because God had to have an Eden condition in order to have a true bride now who's God using to fulfill that look down through scripture look at the scripture that says uh a virgin shall conceive well that's a great prophecy a virgin shall conceive there had to be a Mary there had to be somebody that came along that was in flesh that was a a virgin that was going to conceive that prophecy had to be fulfilled through a person that prophecy had to be made manifest through flesh look at another great scripture I like this one let's look at Ephesians 5 and and uh Ephesians 5 and 27. here it comes there it is Ephesians 5 and 7. or are we let's go just go up a couple verses let's get 24. therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wife be to her own husband in everything husband love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word we even heard this morning that we Clinton so he's going to have a church without spot or without wrinkle he's going to wash that church with the with the cleansing of his word so there's got to be somebody a person you understand somewhere some human being some recipient of This Promise in order for that to be made manifest there's somebody that's going to be washed and cleansed by the washing of the water of the word there's got to be somebody that's there for that to happen to you so there's there's nothing that's spoken without there being a recipient on the other end to receive that promise and make that promise come real so we find out that God has got to use the believer in order to make the word come to pass he always uses Believers to make his word come to pass you say why are you sitting here because he said he would have a bride without Spa without wrinkle without blemish he said he would have a called out people a chosen people a separated people so there's got to be somebody that's called out there's got to be somebody that's been separated there's got to be somebody that was forgiven no I'm gonna put mines out there I'm going to write my name in that spot I'm not going to just let it go to anybody else or whosoever will I'm going to lay claim on it because if it's got to be it's got to be made flesh it's got to be real it's got to be for somebody why don't I step up and say that's for me I'm the one that's been elected to fulfill this you say well how do you know you're elected because I heard it you have an ear to hear Let Him hear Behold thy stand at the door knob anyone that opens up I'll come in and sup that that's somebody somebody in this last day is going to sit down and eat the evening meal with them [Applause] who's gonna I'm in it open I'm going to put myself there okay I'm going to look out and see I'm in the time of the Fulfillment of the prophecy it's the time that there's going to be a people without spot without wrinkle without blemish there's a Time there's going to be a people that have been ear to hear there's going to be a time that he's going to knock and be on the outside of the church you say how do I know I see it I see him on the outside of the church I see the Sodom condition I see that as it was in the days of Noah I see the great falling away I seen man's Hearts being sheared with the hot iron I see those things I see those things those things are made known for me but they're not made known for me to for me to uh acknowledge they're making their landmarks to me they're signs to me they're they're they're they're warnings to me it lets me know wait a minute what other things are supposed to happen in this age there's supposed to be a called out people for my name's sake I hear that who is that that's me that's me you say well I'll title this sermon that's me I'm the one he spoke of I'm the one that's receiving this promise who's that promise for it's for me who's that word for it's for me who's going to step up and live this life it's for me let's just read a few more verses he says he says he that might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of his word that he might present it to him present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish who's that who is that it's me it's you I never you you say I I hear this I see this I recognize this well we know that it's hid from the eyes of the wise and proven and revealed unto babes such it would learn so when you see those things you've got to understand that's part of of what goes with your election you're elected to hear you're elected to see you're elected to receive the Revelation nobody else notices it I mean if there's actually people you you that you talk to and that they say oh you know everybody's talking about inclusion let's let's include everybody God never includes everybody all right I I'm not I'm not I'm not talking about inclusion I'm talking about separation he didn't say he was going to save everybody he said he was going to neglect the people he's going to call out to people he's going to separate a people he was going to have a people for his namesake call out a people for his name say it's not we don't change our attitude towards anybody because a love of God is shed apart in our heart by the Holy Spirit but we recognize that we've been marked and identified as different can't help it because I'm the recipient it's me he called out it's me Mary had to come to the place he said a virgin shall conceive and when the angel appeared under her he says she she she wondered she says how is it going to be I know not man he he says the the spirit of God is going to move upon you what is going to conceive to you is going to be of the Holy Spirit she said let it be done unto me according to your will let it be me another she was saying it's me Lord I'm the one that's going to receive this you called me you said every I'm I'm willing to take my position I'm willing to take my place it's me I'm not gonna I'm not gonna walk in the Realms of the uh of the man's thinking I'm not going to get be given over to to what the trend of the day is what the popular thing is I realize that you're going to have uh you've got you're going to have a bride an elect lady without spot or wrinkle and I meant that's what I hear that's what I'm going to identify this is me this is my calling this is my election by by his calling and by his election I'm the flesh that this promised word is going to be manifested in and let me say this and I hope my words can get across what I'm saying it is not going to be fulfilled apart from you it is not a philosophy it is not a idea like like a a political idea or a or a thought where people take on a certain thought or that's a philosophy or a certain method it's not a thought it's not a method it's it's not a way a lifestyle it's not a Christian lifestyle it is actually a substance faith is a substance it's the evidence I'm the evidence foreign it's not an idea it's it's manifested flesh who is it it's me it's me I mean that song Our Sister Heather used to sing I'm she it's me it's it's not something it's not an idea it's not a trend it's actually real human people that have accepted the word and it's manifested and they actually become that word made flesh the conditions right for it the hour of Prophecy is right for it it's been spoken and it it takes to be manifested and remember every time that God does a great move it's in the it's in the Realms of deep dark and unbelief when Noah built his Ark it was in a great time of unbelief the you know when when he went in the days of Sodom it was a great time of unbelief when they were called out in the great time of unbelief Lord being called out in a great dark time of unbelief and and you're called out in a great dark time the darkness and the unbelief is prophesied to be here in other words he he in order to have you stand out as different as you to stand out in order for you to be a true manifestation of the light there had to be a darkness and we know it's a time that's neither dark nor cold it's lukewarm and it's the most deceptive age that there's ever been so the darkness is actually appearing in the form of an angel of Light that's how deceptive it is the darkness itself and the evil itself is appearing in a Pale Horse a an angel of Light uh it looks like Mankind's doing good it looks like they're trying to reach out to everybody include everybody not let anybody feel ever say ever so uh uh different in everything it appears to be good but it's darkness and the scripture says that God had given them over to a reprobate mind because they no longer wish to hold God into their thinking and that's what's happened to our country amen they don't want to have they don't want God in the picture anymore but someone's going to stand up someone's going to believe someone's going to say what's right in the face there's somebody that's elected to do that and are you gonna join me and say it's me it's me I'm going to stand for what's right I'm going to stand I've heard the voice I've heard the shout I've heard the Trump I know the coming of the Lord is at hand I know now the wedding supper is going on the that were that the marriage is taking place there's an invisible Union happening between between his elect lady that individual men and women are entering into a union with the revealed word of God for the hour they're becoming one with it they're putting all their stake on it the even though the world's crying out oh you're falling occult you're lost it's going to cause you trouble they're willing to say Lord I've I've anchored everything that I am in this word because it speaks to me it's me I'm that word made flesh it's a communion like that it's a relationship it's it's it it it it comes down to that it's no longer it's no longer something that can play around in your mind it's got to drop from your mind into your heart and from into your heart into your flesh that faith that revelation has got to take on substance and the substance is the flesh is the word made flesh you say where's the substance of the message somebody show me the message somebody show me what's the message show me the message I don't say well brother Branham taught this brother Branham taught that no he want to see the message I'll show you the message it's in flesh it's substance it's got form it's got voice it's got It's got will it's got power it's got might it's it's not a teaching it's not a Doctrine it's not a religion it's a people [Applause] it's somebody that's real and it's me God's always used Believers to prove his word always use Believers to prove his word Moses believed that the pillar of Fire on the Mountain he believed he was going to go down there and deliver Egypt with a stick give me a break where are you going Moses going down to defeat pharaoh oh yeah that was a kook in flesh that was a Madman insane can you imagine him telling his wife load up we're going to Egypt but guess what he was that prophecy he was the Fulfillment of the vision and the prophecy that God spoke that they'll come out of Egypt with great substance I'm going down to get God's children and bring them out of Egypt with great substance their bank accounts are going to be filled they're going to be loaded up they're coming out of that land with great substance why because God said so he told Abraham he prophesied it he spoke it now I am that Deliverance the Deliverance was enough wasn't a myth it wasn't a political movement it was a flesh it was in flesh it was in form it was substance it was faith in substance the faith was the Revelation made flesh Pharaoh took his place Egypt took his place there had to be a pharaoh raise up that didn't know the children of Israel so they could be afflicted they had to be there 400 years there had to be a Moses rise up that was going to go down and deliver him with a mighty hand all because the word had to become flesh you know why we're here in this ugly Wicked insane crazy gone mad world because this Eve has got to stand for the word this Eve is not going to believe his lie this Eve is going to be real she's not a church Eve she's not a building Eve she's not a teaching Eve she's not a philosophy Eve she's not a movement Eve she's not she's a flesh Eve the bride is in flesh and I hope you join me in saying it's me it's me I'm the bride I'm the elected Bride for this age I the one that's been called in this age I'm the one that's been separated in this age I see my position I see my election I believe I've been called for this purpose for this cause I have come into the world why are you here you're here to be bride I don't care whether you're doctors lawyers nurses uh whatever job that you have computer scientist or or whatever you are that's not what I've been here for you can do what you want to do do all that's in your heart to do but when it comes down to what you're called to be you're called to be bride and I'd like to and that's what we're communing with that I'd like just to read this statement to you you can put it up on the board it's paragraph uh uh one uh paragraph 119 we'll start there improving his word and we'll just read a few paragraphs I I like it on the board because I'm not a very good reader can you find that okay oh it's the it's the one that's preached in uh 19 uh 60 uh three August 16 1964. August 16 1964. paragraph 119. we have it there I Fez all right no matter what how close you cut you are to Jordan no matter what your circumstance is if you could only hold that promise of God in your heart God will will prove it that it is so in the midst of all unbelief he still prove it to be so yes he does it and circumstances doesn't stop him he still will do the same as he did then notice it was by his Believers that he proves his word by it's by his Believers that he proves his word by what are you believing you're believing that you've been elected to receive this word promise and make it come to pass he's going to prove this word to be true by you somebody's going to prove it to be true right he uses his believer well didn't we just hear this morning can't you believe that you're the believer that he made you've got to believe that election you've got to say it's by me that this is going to be proved you need a Deliverance maybe you've got a spirit that bothers you you can say wait a minute he's a deliverer of spirits and I'm the person that he's chosen to manifest that he's a delivery in this attribute is going to be manifested in me I'm the attribute of healing amen I'm the attribute of forgiveness I'm the attribute of Mercy received who is it Mercy isn't out there somewhere Mercy's here Mercy's here I am Mercy I'm the proof of Mercy I'm the faith evidence of Mercy faith is the evidence of things hoped for not yet seen when does it become evidence when it's manifested in flesh it's not hearsay it's evidence I've seen it I know it's real it's it's it's how real is it as real as it gets to me someone can tell you that's hot and you say okay that's hot touch it then you know it's hot is he full of Mercy ask for it you'll get it because he said he would do it circumstance don't stop them you say I'm pretty deep I'm pretty bad I'm pretty away from God that don't matter circumstance don't stop it does it he went into the lowest hail to preach the gospel no you're elected to receive it let's just finish and we'll have communion as the brothers are are getting ready I gave the deacons double duty they have to set up for Community Sunday school and then set up for foot washing I thought we'd see if we could do it um but anyway so we were that he says that he said no he says notice it was by his Believers that he proves this word by he can only prove his word not by unbelievers it's only by the believer that he can prove his word there's only one way that he can prove that the prophecy has been fulfilled is to have a human being believer to fulfill it in so the minute that we get the idea that even this message is not this message is not a teaching it's a revealing of the Bride of who she is if I could say it this way by the by making clean of the word that I preached to you has made you clean it's washed the unbelief away from you and it's it's calling you into an existence into an Evidence of what that you you've hoped for and believe so no longer is this message the teaching of William Branham it is the teachings that William Branham revealed made flesh and therefore calling a bride and producing a bride into existence each of us taking our place in existence and and you're always going to hear one thing from Satan it's not you oh he won't deny that it's somebody but it ain't you that's always been his thing oh sure it's somebody but it ain't you it ain't you and what's my answer you're the father of Lies there's no truth in you therefore it is me who is it it's me who's the bride it's me who's going to believe this message it's me I'm the one it's me where is it made flesh where is it real show me a Believer it's me he proves his word by the believer who is that believer it's me I'm the one that's the believer I'm the one he's going to prove his word by I'm the one that's going to be a part of the Bride he's going to have a Rapture how many believes he's going to have the Rapture who's going in the rapture it's me I am the rapture it's no longer in teaching it's no longer in theory thought it was spoken in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh were you in the beginning were you in his thoughts were you in his thinking did he know where you'd be here the color of your hair the color of your eyes your statue everything about you he knew all that did he know you were a Believer now you've been made flesh I don't really care too much about what my flesh is but as long as that believing seed is in there I'm okay if I didn't get the right body here I'll get the right one there I'm convinced that it's me let's just read and finish and we'll start communion he says no matter he said he can only prove his word not by unbelievers it's only by Believers that he can prove his word no matter how much the rest of them claim to be oh I believe brother see if you do God will prove it so because we look and see the others how can we say then see it's by the True Believer that he proves his word not by those who say they believe but by those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word how does he prove his word by making it come to pass God doesn't need his word interpreted does he how does God interpret his word by bringing it to pass now we always take that quote and we look at it in some fulfillment of promise you're the greatest promise of the age the greatest promise of the age is the bride the greatest promise of the age is an elect lady that is not is going to be an eve that says no to Satan and takes the Rapture that goes back to Eden that's how he does it he interprets his word by bringing it to pass where is he going to bring it to pass in me I'm her now he had the Believers the old crop had died off the unbelievers who said we couldn't take it he led every one of them perish why every one of them but believers who was left Moses had been taken into Glory the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness it was the children it was their children they were the only two that crossed over that was the Believers Joshua and Caleb they was the Believers they was the ones that crossed over it's only it's the only way God can do it is by his believing children you believe that all right his Believers was the ones that done it he used them to cross over with I want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers and then in order to have Believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see it he's got to predestinate this to this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did you did it get you did you feel it did you see it did you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated it it to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated it in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestinated anything to happen in his word he had to prove all of his word to be so and when he predestinates anything to happen and says it'll happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time Hallelujah who is that seed it's me foreign were this made flesh you say well that was said in 64. It's Made flesh today 400 years ago he told Abraham they were going to come back out of the land with great substance he had to predestinate every believer he had to predestinate Joshua and Caleb he had to predestinate them Moses he had to predestinate a pharaoh he had to put everything in his place in position and he had to put his Believers there too just like you that's why you're called that's why you're here that's why you're elected that's why you're in the most wicked deceitful age there ever was so he could prove that this eve will not be like the first year to prove that he does have a church without spot or wrinkle that he does have a people that are his workmanship in Christ Jesus for ordained under good work and it's it's not a Bible teaching it's real people real flesh made word in the beginning the word was made flesh now flesh is being made word he and when he predestes anything he says can he come over and predest anything to happen he had to prove his word to be so he predestined anything that happens since it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's going to be there going to be a Rapture she's going to be there he predestinated it by his foreignology therefore nothing's going to stop it amen [Music] there's going to be a bride he predestinated it he elected it he called it who is it it's me why don't we change the name of our church to me Tabernacle it's me it's me I'm the one he's talking about I'm the one this word spoke of be it unto me according to Thy word amen my brothers are I hope that they're ready for communion I don't know but let's stand this evening and let's open our Bibles see if I can find my so yeah I forgot my communion chapter I thought it was in Corinthians all right so it is here it is yeah 11 23. you put yourself right in all these great scriptures for I have received the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same men are also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged and when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto come the nation and the rest will I set in order when I come God bless you let us

knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end and supper being ended the devil having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he raised from supper laid aside his garments and took a towel and girdeth himself after that he poureth water into a basin and begin to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherein he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knoweth not now but Thou shalt know hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou hath no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not to save to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and taken His Garment and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and ye say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the sermon is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen at such a wonderful time everybody anybody want to be happy go wash one another's feet amen God bless you we'll meet
