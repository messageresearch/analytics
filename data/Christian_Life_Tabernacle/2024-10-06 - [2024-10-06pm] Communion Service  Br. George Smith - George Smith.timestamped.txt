[23:47] [Applause]
[24:00] may the Lord bless you it's like a I'm
[24:02] gonna give like a little testimony I'm G
[24:04] to make it like so short I'll try to be
[24:07] short um it's about um everything
[24:10] started like two and a half years ago
[24:13] when I first came to with you guys to be
[24:16] among you and uh so when I came here you
[24:20] know the message became like something
[24:23] like so different than the way that I
[24:26] used to see the message and um that
[24:29] impacted my life and probably my my wife
[24:32] can say the same thing and my kids my
[24:36] family and um so we went to Mexico after
[24:40] we we moved with you guys and um at the
[24:44] same time my mother-in-law went through
[24:47] through such a rough times and um so we
[24:51] went and visit him and my when we were
[24:53] driving back my my wife had a you know
[24:56] she was like feeling like so bad
[24:58] about the family you know her two
[25:01] sisters and uh my mother-in-law and she
[25:04] had a burden on her heart and um so we
[25:08] came back and she wasn't feeling good
[25:10] you know I think she had a some sickness
[25:14] that the Lord healed her uh through
[25:17] prayer but I remember one time she came
[25:20] to the altar to get pray for and uh she
[25:25] came exactly to be prayed for for the
[25:28] the sickness that she had right but at
[25:30] the same time she had that burden on on
[25:32] her heart about the family so whenever
[25:36] that she came by you know our our pastor
[25:39] the first thing that that he tell her is
[25:42] like you don't have to worry about your
[25:44] family you know the Lord already opened
[25:46] a door for them so take that out of your
[25:49] mind you know just keep praying for them
[25:51] and you don't have to worry about him
[25:52] you know the Lord already opened a a
[25:54] door for them away and uh so we went
[25:58] that happened like in the spring and
[25:59] then we we went back in summer and
[26:03] um the Lord you know like he moving a
[26:07] how you say miraculous way uh over there
[26:09] and uh I remember I was uh we were
[26:13] having fellowship with my with my
[26:16] sister-in-law and um and one thing that
[26:19] I want to mention she was addicted to
[26:21] smoke since she was since she was 12 and
[26:25] then now she's like 33 and uh
[26:28] that night I remember you know the Lord
[26:30] moving a super a supernatural way or
[26:33] natural way and uh she got delivered out
[26:37] of that condition and uh you're not
[26:40] going to believe uh this but you know
[26:42] she used to to do her eyelashes and you
[26:47] know her her her was she had a how you
[26:50] say c c her or something like that you
[26:52] know where CH cut the her and uh she
[26:55] used to wear shorts like this short over
[26:57] here and and uh since that night since
[27:00] that night without uh you know like made
[27:04] any special prayer or anything like that
[27:06] you know the Lord changed her at that
[27:09] night and uh you know I remember our
[27:13] pastor he started preaching like you
[27:15] know oh he preached I think the uh end
[27:19] of the year he preached with no books uh
[27:22] no Bible and no tapes and uh you know
[27:26] that really impacted my life and uh so
[27:29] when we when I was listening to our
[27:32] pastor about all the the things that we
[27:34] was been preaching and everything that
[27:37] really impacted my life and I'm like
[27:40] okay you know like I'm not going to try
[27:41] to convince anybody you know to come to
[27:43] the message or to believe in the Lord
[27:45] Jesus or whatever you know Lord just be
[27:48] you through through us and uh so the the
[27:51] Lord put that burden in my heart after
[27:54] that to come back and um and Ministry to
[27:57] them so I came back and I talked to our
[28:01] pastor and brother Cosman and uh I told
[28:04] Brother Cosman you know and I really
[28:05] appreciate and I'm doing this because
[28:08] he's over here uh because I don't want
[28:11] to do it after he's not in here you know
[28:13] and I told Brother Cosman like the third
[28:16] time that we went over there I told him
[28:18] hey I think we have to make a report to
[28:20] the church and he's like no you have to
[28:21] do it because this is the Lord doing
[28:23] through you so you have to do it
[28:25] yourself and I'm like no you know all
[28:27] this is new to me so I can't you know
[28:29] like it's like I'm so shy and I I can do
[28:33] this you have to help me and then we let
[28:35] time pass by and we never done it but I
[28:37] think it the Lord has uh he the time for
[28:41] everything right so we went me and
[28:44] brother Cosman and then uh he started
[28:46] preaching and everything and so there is
[28:49] one family that came to the Lord that's
[28:52] my sister-in-law and my her husband and
[28:56] then they had three uh uh three
[28:58] daughters one is like eight 19 18 and 15
[29:03] and then whenever they came to the
[29:05] message they're like you know what like
[29:08] okay it's okay for you to change your
[29:10] lives and whatever but we don't want
[29:12] nothing to do with the Lord uh we don't
[29:14] want nothing to do with that stuff for
[29:16] right now I mean probably we'll change
[29:17] by later so the Lord is like so
[29:21] marvelous that uh like four months ago
[29:24] or five months ago they one of them
[29:28] longer longer than that one of them came
[29:30] to the church to the to the church and
[29:33] uh since then you know the three little
[29:35] girls and and them are in the message
[29:38] now and they don't stand for nothing
[29:40] else but the message and one one other
[29:42] thing that I want to mention my pastor I
[29:45] talk to him about it and then he's like
[29:46] hey you know what don't don't don't put
[29:50] anything that you have in your mind you
[29:52] know like just teach him teach him the
[29:54] message and the Lord will do the rest
[29:56] don't put anything any of your thoughts
[29:58] and and whenever you're talking to them
[30:01] so the Lord did uh you want to help
[30:03] me I don't know if you can you put the
[30:07] pictures so they can see brother it's
[30:08] like a little report so you know that
[30:10] the what the Lord did in Mexico that's
[30:13] uh uh Juanita and um the husband it's uh
[30:18] Tony and my sister-in-law B by the side
[30:21] of my wife and my brother-in-law and the
[30:25] by the by the end and um so they they
[30:29] came they start they started coming to
[30:31] church uh two weeks ago they were hard
[30:34] Harding their hearts but finally they
[30:36] came to the to the message uh with the
[30:39] other testimony about the other family
[30:41] this is one family and the other one is
[30:43] another family can you put the other one
[30:46] brother and then uh brother Tommy and
[30:49] Brother Joseph Gordon the Lord put on
[30:52] their hearts to to come and testify
[30:54] about what the the Lord did on their
[30:56] lives and he was uh such a good time
[30:59] that we had and then they Rejoice on the
[31:02] testimony that they share over there so
[31:05] that's uh my the one that is by my wife
[31:09] that's my sister-in-law the one that
[31:11] that used to be smoking since she was 12
[31:14] and the Lord changed her completely and
[31:16] that's my the husband by the end that's
[31:19] Tabo and uh
[31:22] Mario so can you help me brother come
[31:26] and say come and say something I could
[31:27] like so
[31:31] nervous come
[31:34] here I mean he knows more right I'm I'm
[31:41] sweating I I figured I can get away from
[31:44] having to be up
[31:45] here yeah so I'm doing all this you know
[31:49] as a recognition or respect for brother
[31:52] Cosman and how the Lord uses
[31:55] him um and I really appreciate
[31:57] appreciate him and I'm I'm going to miss
[32:00] him a lot you know I just want to thank
[32:03] thank him and uh sister hly and the
[32:05] family CU When I first came to the
[32:08] church they really opened their hearts
[32:09] not only him but you know brother Andrew
[32:12] brother uh Chris a lot of you guys and I
[32:15] really appreciate you but I'm doing all
[32:17] this as a respect for you what the Lord
[32:20] has done in your life and your testimony
[32:22] you know for everything that the Lord
[32:24] has done so you want to say something
[32:27] you want to share something
[32:29] yeah you know um Jesus Christ is the
[32:32] same yesterday today and forever uh
[32:34] we'll try to be really short but you
[32:36] know brother Jose had a burden upon his
[32:39] heart to bring this message to his own
[32:42] family and this message you know just
[32:45] like he was expressing and he was told
[32:47] by our pastor it's not a Doctrine it's
[32:50] not something that you just try to go
[32:52] teach and just create disciples by just
[32:54] trying to go give them a letter and then
[32:56] try to train them in certain ways to
[32:58] live according to this message but it's
[33:00] actually a life that is lived before
[33:02] them and and they've already been a
[33:04] testimony in Mexico before we even
[33:06] arrived there because every time they
[33:08] would go they would give books and they
[33:10] would stand and and share testimonies
[33:12] and they would be able to sit around the
[33:13] table and talk about the goodness of God
[33:16] and God was already moving upon their
[33:18] hearts so you know when we started
[33:21] joining the burden with brother Jose we
[33:23] just went there to encourage the family
[33:25] and I can say this Jesus Christ can pres
[33:28] make his presence in a small little room
[33:30] if you're just sincere and you're you're
[33:32] ready to receive him and uh we've had
[33:35] some wonderful times the Lord really has
[33:37] uh blessed brother Jose to continue to
[33:41] be there for him and and um you know
[33:44] even um the drives we did a few drives
[33:48] down there you know it's not easy to
[33:49] drive 10 hours to Mexico and take things
[33:52] and you can go through the pictures um
[33:56] but you know this is this was ao's place
[33:58] this is the brother-in-law of brother
[34:00] Jose and this is where we gathered and
[34:02] just fellowshipped really that's all we
[34:04] did we just fellowshipped and talked
[34:06] about the word and we would just enjoy
[34:08] one another's Fellowship you know this
[34:10] world is not a world where they love
[34:14] anymore you know when you sit around the
[34:16] table these days with worldly people
[34:18] they don't want to talk about Jesus
[34:20] Christ anymore they talk about rumors of
[34:22] wars and wars and all these things and
[34:24] all the fears that are in the world and
[34:26] all these other things and what it does
[34:27] it shakes the foundation and all of a
[34:29] sudden now it's just bringing fear
[34:32] within the people when when you stand
[34:33] around talking about Jesus Christ it
[34:36] does something to the believer and it
[34:38] gives him hope it gives him faith
[34:40] knowing that whatever may come Jesus
[34:42] Christ will be there for us amen because
[34:44] that's the life that we live in so
[34:50] um so that's uh Tabo and uh Sarah my
[34:55] sister-in-law and the uh uh one of their
[34:58] two little girls you know the one that
[35:00] is by my sister-in-law and the other one
[35:03] with the glasses and my mother-in-law so
[35:06] the Lord is sing you know every every
[35:08] member of the body of Christ you know
[35:11] just like brother kman was saying you
[35:13] just have to be yourself and and be
[35:17] available for the Lord to use you you
[35:19] know like you don't you don't have to
[35:22] wait in your time is on his time that's
[35:25] right and uh I think that's
[35:28] yeah I think that's all I wanted to
[35:30] mention and uh just want to thank you
[35:32] all for all your All Your Love uh and I
[35:36] want to sing this song it's called in
[35:39] Spanish uh what a miracle is to have a
[35:43] family in Christ uh because that's what
[35:45] we are I think brother uh David said it
[35:49] in the morning you know when when we
[35:51] when he was uh presenting I don't know
[35:53] how you said uh little William that no

[1:02:30] amen let's pray
[1:02:35] father we are told all things that we do
[1:02:39] we do in that
[1:02:43] name because there's a life and there's
[1:02:45] a
[1:02:48] person that
[1:02:51] stands behind that
[1:02:54] name who said you ask anything of my
[1:02:57] father in my
[1:03:00] name and he will grant
[1:03:05] it Lord we're not
[1:03:08] worthy to speak your
[1:03:14] name it's a name above all
[1:03:18] names and we have not words in our
[1:03:21] vocabulary to give you the honor and the
[1:03:25] praise that that you
[1:03:27] deserve but we thank you for it and we
[1:03:31] thank you for the power that that name
[1:03:34] has and the hope that it gives
[1:03:38] us and we call upon it one more time
[1:03:42] this
[1:03:43] evening we call upon you Lord in your
[1:03:47] wonderful name to be with us and we ask
[1:03:51] these things in that name the name of
[1:03:54] our Lord and savior
[1:03:56] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God
[1:04:00] bless you for a moment may be
[1:04:06] seated I just want
[1:04:09] to um just take a moment we have a a
[1:04:14] special need this evening that I I was
[1:04:18] praying in the back about what time to
[1:04:20] address it but I just feel this is the
[1:04:23] time to handle it
[1:04:26] you know I I I like what Billy said he
[1:04:29] said you know some people can sing and
[1:04:31] some people make noise but if your
[1:04:33] heart's
[1:04:35] sincere behind what you sing that's
[1:04:38] music to God's
[1:04:40] ear you can sing like an opera singer
[1:04:44] but if there's nothing there and no
[1:04:48] experience or no identity with the
[1:04:52] words um it doesn't matter but when the
[1:04:56] spirit in the heart it's music that's
[1:04:59] true music of worship not in the measure
[1:05:02] of men but I I you know cuz I would hope
[1:05:06] when I sing it's music to the Lord it
[1:05:09] might be noise to you but it's music to
[1:05:12] him praise God so we're thankful for
[1:05:15] that you
[1:05:18] know faith is an amazing thing amen it
[1:05:22] can do all things it can move
[1:05:26] mountains it
[1:05:29] can change
[1:05:31] time but faith has a place that it has
[1:05:35] to rest has to have a place to Anchor
[1:05:39] it's got to have something to hold on to
[1:05:42] you might be rushing down the river in a
[1:05:47] flood
[1:05:48] and you know we hear the stories all
[1:05:52] time people survived night and day they
[1:05:55] hung on on to a branch or they hung on
[1:05:57] to a rope or they hung on to something
[1:06:01] and and that's what faith does faith
[1:06:04] gives you that something to hang on to
[1:06:08] and tonight we have a
[1:06:11] need
[1:06:13] um we want to pray for a
[1:06:16] baby
[1:06:18] and a little baby can't have
[1:06:23] faith but our messenger told us he said
[1:06:26] you have to have faith for that
[1:06:29] child you have to have faith for that
[1:06:31] child which means that God will honor
[1:06:34] your faith you may not be a part of the
[1:06:38] situation or you not may not be a part
[1:06:40] of the struggle or you might not feel
[1:06:43] the pain and the heartache of this the
[1:06:47] situation itself but your faith can make
[1:06:51] a difference if a bad attitude could
[1:06:54] change a a service whether someone gets
[1:06:58] healed or not then maybe the right
[1:07:00] attitude could do the same
[1:07:03] thing you know what I mean it could it
[1:07:05] could have the same effect and so I want
[1:07:08] to call upon your faith tonight because
[1:07:11] a friend of mine i' I've known her for a
[1:07:13] long time you know seven and she's uh
[1:07:18] sister Kendall's daughter and her
[1:07:21] husband are here and they have a baby
[1:07:25] together
[1:07:26] and
[1:07:28] and they diagnosed that
[1:07:30] baby with a bad
[1:07:33] heart and I know doctors always try to
[1:07:37] prepare us for the worst but God's word
[1:07:41] prepares us for the possible amen yes
[1:07:45] sir and and it's got
[1:07:49] the it it's like our sister saying it it
[1:07:53] changes things am makes things different
[1:07:57] and if God doesn't
[1:07:59] undertake for this child they want to
[1:08:01] just take it and put it on life support
[1:08:05] and let it finish its
[1:08:10] days and that's where faith comes in
[1:08:14] amen that's where the believer comes in
[1:08:18] you know you don't want to be a believer
[1:08:20] that sits back and just hopes and waits
[1:08:26] for something to
[1:08:28] transpire that's not faith faith is
[1:08:32] people who are willing to stand up and
[1:08:34] confess God's word yes they're able to
[1:08:38] say there and says this is what I
[1:08:40] believe the result will be of my
[1:08:44] prayer because if you don't testify of
[1:08:47] it God can do nothing for you that you
[1:08:50] do not
[1:08:53] confess and so I wanted to I'm going to
[1:08:57] ask them to come up and and we're going
[1:09:00] to pray for this
[1:09:02] baby but you know our
[1:09:06] whole
[1:09:08] reason to believe is based on God's word
[1:09:13] and I say God's word I don't mean a
[1:09:15] written bible I mean the word that he
[1:09:19] gave us
[1:09:21] himself I will do this by my
[1:09:26] Stripes you are
[1:09:28] healed you know and Peter said it this
[1:09:31] way he says by these exceedingly great
[1:09:36] and precious promises we are partakers
[1:09:40] of divine
[1:09:42] nature we can hang on to
[1:09:45] faith and we're not hanging on to our
[1:09:48] faith we're hanging on to what he
[1:09:52] said we believe what he said amen that's
[1:09:56] what our faith is it's not in ourselves
[1:09:59] it's not in our feelings our faith is in
[1:10:02] what that he said he said so that
[1:10:06] settles it if he I I like our messenger
[1:10:09] said if God told me George Washington
[1:10:12] was going to raise from the dead and he
[1:10:13] said it I would tell the world to be
[1:10:17] there because it's based on what he said
[1:10:20] well not only do we know what he said
[1:10:22] but we have a history and a record of
[1:10:25] him keeping this
[1:10:28] word so our faith is
[1:10:31] built on these
[1:10:34] promises faith is not a test to
[1:10:38] you can you believe this or can you
[1:10:41] believe that that's not faith faith is
[1:10:43] something that you hear the
[1:10:45] word and you know it's true and it's so
[1:10:49] true to your heart that you're willing
[1:10:52] to make your decisions based upon it
[1:10:57] that's this word that brother George has
[1:10:59] been preaching to us about not a
[1:11:02] movement not what's going on but Jesus
[1:11:04] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:11:07] forever and so our faith is built on
[1:11:09] this in Hebrews 11 and one now Faith is
[1:11:13] the substance of things hoped for the
[1:11:16] evidence of Things Not Seen if we can
[1:11:19] believe his word I know that that word
[1:11:22] will perform that which I haven't seen I
[1:11:26] don't have to wait to see it to believe
[1:11:29] it I believe what he
[1:11:32] said that's what my faith
[1:11:35] is and it's like a a man you know when a
[1:11:38] man's in his
[1:11:40] calling that calling produces fruit if a
[1:11:44] man's out of his calling no matter how
[1:11:47] hard he works it
[1:11:50] won't but we're
[1:11:52] called to lay our hands on the S
[1:11:56] and they shall recover we are
[1:11:58] commissioned to go into the world and
[1:12:01] preach the gospel and that these signs
[1:12:03] shall follow them that believe the
[1:12:06] prophet of God says that's the evidence
[1:12:08] of the church
[1:12:10] amen when it's not a doctrinal belief
[1:12:13] but that word is made real in the lives
[1:12:16] of the people and that they see the
[1:12:19] fruits of their prayer because they
[1:12:21] believe that God hears their
[1:12:23] prayer l lukewarm is Wai and
[1:12:30] see you know this this is the proof of
[1:12:33] the Ice
[1:12:36] Cube It's not the singing and the
[1:12:40] shouting it's the signs that
[1:12:45] follow it also says in Hebrews
[1:12:48] 138 I know you know these scriptures but
[1:12:51] they mean so much to you in an hour in a
[1:12:55] time like this Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ
[1:12:59] is the same
[1:13:02] yesterday and today and
[1:13:06] forever he said suffer the little ones
[1:13:08] to come unto
[1:13:09] me come unto me all ye that are heavy
[1:13:12] laden and I'll give you rest those are
[1:13:16] the things that he said go into the
[1:13:18] world Lay Your Hands on the sick and
[1:13:20] they shall recover do you believe he
[1:13:22] said that are you a believer
[1:13:25] do you believe that will work for you in
[1:13:28] your prayer not me not a preacher but
[1:13:31] you the
[1:13:34] believer the two or three of us that are
[1:13:36] gathered together here it also says in
[1:13:42] Peter the 5th chapter and the
[1:13:45] seventh 1 Peter 5 and
[1:13:50] 7 it says casting all your cares upon
[1:13:54] Him for he carth for you do you believe
[1:13:59] God cares for this little
[1:14:02] baby you know where that heart condition
[1:14:05] comes from it comes from the
[1:14:14] devil and you might make the
[1:14:19] difference might be a little sister
[1:14:21] praying in a
[1:14:22] balcony it might be one of you teenagers
[1:14:25] that's heart's moved might be a mother
[1:14:28] that has a little
[1:14:30] baby that would reach up and Touch the
[1:14:33] Hem of His
[1:14:35] Garment they're not quote unquote
[1:14:38] message
[1:14:39] Believers as we might
[1:14:44] feel but God doesn't judge that he
[1:14:48] judges the
[1:14:50] faithful the little baby has no choice
[1:14:56] King David once said I was cast upon you
[1:14:58] Lord for my mother's
[1:15:00] womb here I
[1:15:02] am you put me
[1:15:04] here what can I do and here's this
[1:15:08] little
[1:15:09] baby it's got one
[1:15:11] choice in fact it doesn't have a
[1:15:17] choice either faith will save
[1:15:21] it or it will die
[1:15:26] I hate to be so
[1:15:29] Stark and I would like to be
[1:15:33] kinder but that's the
[1:15:35] truth of the
[1:15:39] matter and I think we take things way
[1:15:41] too
[1:15:43] lightly but the prophet of God said
[1:15:46] there's healing in
[1:15:49] communion and we've come tonight to take
[1:15:52] communion so I believe the faithful are
[1:15:56] here the others might not feel its
[1:16:01] importance but you're assembled here to
[1:16:04] take communion and along with that
[1:16:08] communion comes
[1:16:10] healing so I'm going to ask seven and
[1:16:13] your husband if you'd bring your baby
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:38] I forgotten your
[1:16:41] name brother George would you come pray
[1:16:44] with me would you turn around show your
[1:16:47] baby what your
[1:16:49] name
[1:16:50] Ezra Ezra
[1:16:57] his life might lie in your
[1:17:03] hands we're going to place him in the
[1:17:06] hands of our Lord and
[1:17:09] savior would you join in us in
[1:17:15] prayer tell the people
[1:17:31] he he is not gaining weight um he's
[1:17:34] losing weight and he won't keep anything
[1:17:38] down
[1:17:39] really
[1:17:41] um and he's not building muscle to be
[1:17:45] able to sit up like a seven-month-old
[1:17:47] should or um he won't stay awake for
[1:17:51] longer than an hour at a time so they're
[1:17:54] running a few test on him to see what's
[1:17:57] going on but they've kind of given us
[1:17:58] the worst
[1:18:00] diagnosis um
[1:18:02] so
[1:18:11] yeah let us
[1:18:13] pray our gracious loving
[1:18:18] father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:22] Christ we rebuke the sick
[1:18:25] that has struck this
[1:18:28] child Giver of
[1:18:30] Life Giver of
[1:18:33] Hope purchaser of our
[1:18:37] healing and our
[1:18:40] Salvation we call upon you in the
[1:18:42] wonderful name that we sang of the name
[1:18:46] of
[1:18:47] Jesus father we believe that you spoke
[1:18:51] it we believe that your word is true
[1:18:55] and we claim this healing of this child
[1:18:59] tonight father that through this child
[1:19:01] this family might come back to the
[1:19:04] Lord that others could look at their
[1:19:07] lives and see that you are still the
[1:19:09] same yesterday today and
[1:19:15] forever and that your light and your
[1:19:18] gospel has never
[1:19:21] changed that what you did yesterday you
[1:19:23] will do today
[1:19:25] and where else could we
[1:19:28] go you alone have the words of life and
[1:19:33] the words of life that you spoke were by
[1:19:36] his stripes we are healed and father we
[1:19:40] accept that word as the foundation of
[1:19:42] our faith and we believe for this child
[1:19:46] in jesus' name we pray amen amen
[1:19:59] God bless
[1:20:02] you it's good to be back in the house of
[1:20:04] the Lord
[1:20:06] tonight and it is a special night of
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:11] communion and we're not going to speak
[1:20:12] long but we hope to speak something that
[1:20:15] will be a blessing to
[1:20:18] everyone and
[1:20:20] um you know throughout the Book of Acts
[1:20:23] as we went through it
[1:20:27] carefully they were glad to have the the
[1:20:30] the
[1:20:31] Miracles just don't speak in that name
[1:20:34] put that name
[1:20:36] aside stick with the traditions of the
[1:20:38] fathers because for thousands of years
[1:20:41] we've quoted our prophet and blah blah
[1:20:44] blah and they had problems because this
[1:20:47] new new thing was coming but this was
[1:20:49] only the manifestation of the promises
[1:20:52] that they had memorized all those years
[1:20:55] and so in our study we found many many
[1:21:00] truths and the fact is that uh every
[1:21:04] Revival produces
[1:21:06] twins it's produced twins in our time I
[1:21:10] have very dear friends that I walked
[1:21:14] with that I have communion with etc etc
[1:21:18] and then one day the light went
[1:21:21] out and they went another way scripture
[1:21:25] says if you've been here and you partook
[1:21:28] and you've enjoyed and you walk away
[1:21:30] it's a one-way street I'm not going
[1:21:33] after him that's not God's will this is
[1:21:36] all about equal opportunity you had your
[1:21:38] choice and so you know most of the
[1:21:41] Believers back in the book of Acts there
[1:21:43] in chapter 6 and 7 they loved brother
[1:21:45] Steven brother Steven was in a he was an
[1:21:49] um an evangelist and many miracles that
[1:21:52] happened but there were certain people
[1:21:54] that rose up to dispute to argue with
[1:21:57] the man of God who in their right mind
[1:21:59] would want to you know argue with the
[1:22:02] man of God but they do they do today and
[1:22:06] they did back there and
[1:22:09] so when they saw that they couldn't out
[1:22:11] argue him that they says here uh they
[1:22:14] were not able to resist the wisdom of
[1:22:17] the spirit which he spake what' they do
[1:22:19] then they did just like they do
[1:22:22] today money under to their table didn't
[1:22:25] start in Mexico it didn't start in
[1:22:27] Washington started clear back here in
[1:22:29] the Bible they suborned they they put
[1:22:32] money under the table and said for these
[1:22:35] people you know if they get the money
[1:22:36] then I want you to go say we've heard
[1:22:38] this man speak Blasphemous words against
[1:22:40] Moses against God a bunch of nonsense
[1:22:43] stuff that wasn't true but they got
[1:22:44] money so they're doing it you know and
[1:22:48] so um when they when they couldn't when
[1:22:51] they see that this didn't work they
[1:22:52] bribed some other people so back based
[1:22:54] on these allegations that these people
[1:22:56] were
[1:22:57] saying the the religious police grabbed
[1:23:01] Steven must be some truth you know where
[1:23:03] there's smoke there's fire so they
[1:23:05] grabbed him and they took him in and
[1:23:08] there was confusing accusations you know
[1:23:11] uh repeating
[1:23:13] misquotations yeah we've got in the
[1:23:15] ministry we've got to be very careful
[1:23:17] how we present things because people go
[1:23:19] out here yeah I heard him say no you
[1:23:22] didn't no you lied
[1:23:25] we speak truth amen so the repeating
[1:23:28] misquotations little pieces of the
[1:23:30] message in the wrong order you know out
[1:23:32] of Harmony and so they had problems but
[1:23:35] you know God's man was confident he knew
[1:23:38] that God had called him just like
[1:23:40] Brother David knows that God called him
[1:23:41] here the people that left well have a
[1:23:44] nice day we're having Church you know
[1:23:47] and so in in chapter 6 and verse 13 they
[1:23:50] set up the false
[1:23:51] Witnesses and uh we've heard him say
[1:23:53] these bad things they're in front of a
[1:23:55] council they're in front of very
[1:23:56] important
[1:23:58] people and all in the council looking at
[1:24:01] stepen they saw his face as it was the
[1:24:04] face of an angel that should have been
[1:24:06] the end of the argument right there if
[1:24:08] this man looks like an angel then
[1:24:11] something's not right these accusations
[1:24:14] can't be true so the main man he says um
[1:24:19] uh sir are are these things true well
[1:24:22] when you give the man of God a
[1:24:23] microphone it's going to go on for a
[1:24:25] while you know and from there he
[1:24:27] launched that into the deep water and um
[1:24:30] he um gave him a very good history
[1:24:33] Lesson by
[1:24:36] Revelation in chapter 7: 51 it comes
[1:24:40] down to the fact that um and you stiff
[1:24:43] neck numb circumstan and heart and ears
[1:24:46] you'd always resist the Holy Ghost as
[1:24:48] your fathers did so do ye they're
[1:24:51] they're just it's in their blood that's
[1:24:53] what they're going to do regardless you
[1:24:54] see which of the prophets have your
[1:24:57] fathers not persecuted and so forth and
[1:25:01] it goes on down here and um and when
[1:25:04] they heard these things so here's the
[1:25:06] man of God speaking nothing but Truth by
[1:25:09] Revelation no Bible no nothing just
[1:25:12] speaking when they heard these things
[1:25:14] they were cut to the heart they nasted
[1:25:17] their teeth we're going to get this guy
[1:25:20] being filled with the Holy Ghost he
[1:25:22] looked up steadfastly into heaven
[1:25:24] and he saw the glory of God he saw Jesus
[1:25:27] at the right hand of God and he said
[1:25:29] behold I see the heavens opened now this
[1:25:32] is a live you know Vision he's telling
[1:25:35] them
[1:25:36] about I see the heavens open the Son of
[1:25:39] God standing there and they cried with a
[1:25:41] loud voice and stopped their ears and
[1:25:44] they ran upon him in one Accord and they
[1:25:46] threw him out of the city and out there
[1:25:48] they stoned
[1:25:50] him and they took their coats off and
[1:25:53] their backpacks and they laid it down at
[1:25:55] this man's feet now you watch this stuff
[1:25:57] we're going to go Stone this man who do
[1:25:59] you think this little guy was over here
[1:26:01] it's about a 18yar old man named
[1:26:04] Saul to be a good Pharisee you got to go
[1:26:06] through training from 14 to 40 so he's
[1:26:09] in training he's just watching the stuff
[1:26:11] he's not throwing any
[1:26:13] rocks and so they stoned him and he's
[1:26:16] calling come on God he said Lord Jesus
[1:26:18] receive my spirit and he kneeled down
[1:26:22] and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not
[1:26:24] this sin to their charge and he fell
[1:26:27] asleep the death of the first martyr
[1:26:30] this didn't come to us on a silver
[1:26:33] platter it came through much
[1:26:36] suffering okay so this is the first
[1:26:38] mention we have of
[1:26:39] Saul and he
[1:26:43] um he was a a bad boy we could say
[1:26:47] because he was persecuting the Lord's
[1:26:51] elect this man was so ingrained with
[1:26:54] with his prophet's words Moses said now
[1:26:57] they jumped over a few things but Moses
[1:26:59] said Moses said and so when Steven is
[1:27:04] killed well then the people hey this is
[1:27:08] getting pretty serious here so it took
[1:27:09] this persecution of the Lord's people um
[1:27:13] for them to leave Jerusalem we better
[1:27:16] get out of here we might be next you
[1:27:17] know but God had a plan because over
[1:27:20] here in acts: 18 he said and you'll be
[1:27:22] my Witnesses here in Jerusalem in
[1:27:25] Samaria and Judea and to the end of the
[1:27:27] Earth Marco Polo hadn't been born yet
[1:27:30] they didn't know the Earth was around
[1:27:31] and there was people over there their
[1:27:33] world was very small they knew where
[1:27:35] Spain was and Rome they'd heard about
[1:27:38] India stuff coming over but they didn't
[1:27:40] know how it was going to happen they
[1:27:41] didn't have SUVs they didn't have planes
[1:27:42] they didn't have boats had nothing you
[1:27:44] know had boats but but how's it going to
[1:27:46] happen well people start leaving they
[1:27:48] start taking the gospel where they're
[1:27:50] going so this Pharisees Saul was one of
[1:27:52] the main troublemakers standing for the
[1:27:57] traditions of the fathers this is what
[1:27:59] we have for thousands of years and we're
[1:28:01] not going to put up with anybody coming
[1:28:03] in here saying there's something better
[1:28:05] this is it now they had memorized a
[1:28:08] large portion of their Bible but they
[1:28:10] couldn't visualize the
[1:28:15] manifestation so I don't have any time
[1:28:16] for this say what he said well let's
[1:28:18] let's let's see what it manifests into
[1:28:21] you know if you tell me that KFC is good
[1:28:23] food
[1:28:24] but I see you ding your your skeleton
[1:28:27] well then you're not a very good
[1:28:30] advertisement you know so let's see the
[1:28:32] evidence you know so um here he is
[1:28:36] bringing persecution on the early church
[1:28:38] and in Saul's own words he says I was
[1:28:41] bringing Havoc I was bringing problems
[1:28:43] to the to the early church Havoc means
[1:28:45] trouble confusion God is not the author
[1:28:48] of confusion so the death at the death
[1:28:51] of Judas scariot the church leaders that
[1:28:54] we got a vacancy here let's uh let's see
[1:28:56] let's let's vote on this and let's see
[1:28:58] and pray well they chose a man on the
[1:29:00] front row that paid ties good man yeah
[1:29:02] that'd be a good replacement that wasn't
[1:29:04] God's choice no you know and so um uh
[1:29:10] this this man that was arresting people
[1:29:15] taking them to court miss you know with
[1:29:18] mis uh quotations and things seeing
[1:29:21] people die he was a Pharisee and train
[1:29:24] but it was God's choice brother brand
[1:29:28] said if it was up to us Americans we'
[1:29:29] have never pick Saul not in a million
[1:29:32] years bad boy that he was killed grandma
[1:29:34] and all those things you know but God's
[1:29:36] choosing is a little short hook-nosed
[1:29:39] sarcastic high-tempered Jew
[1:29:42] whoa it doesn't sound good does it
[1:29:46] no and uh he's the one's dragging
[1:29:48] converts into into court and watching
[1:29:50] them be put to death people just like
[1:29:52] you and they what what the reason was
[1:29:55] because they love the Lord Jesus they
[1:29:57] gave their life for
[1:29:59] Jesus you see just like I said all
[1:30:02] through the book of Acts it wasn't a
[1:30:03] matter of whether the people were healed
[1:30:05] or not well y's healed man you know laid
[1:30:07] on the C there for 38 years and now he's
[1:30:09] jumping up just don't mention the name
[1:30:13] Jesus even the enemy knows where the
[1:30:15] power
[1:30:16] is and today we have people that brother
[1:30:19] Bram said brother Braham said okay well
[1:30:23] we got we got places in the Bible where
[1:30:25] where this um uh this uh people they
[1:30:29] were casting out demons and they were
[1:30:31] doing things and they said yeah in the
[1:30:33] name of the of the god that Paul
[1:30:36] preaches and so the demon spoke back to
[1:30:39] him well now wait a minute I know Jesus
[1:30:42] I know Paul or who you
[1:30:46] guys we don't want to be over there do
[1:30:48] we we want to be with the right side of
[1:30:50] things so anyway Paul is you know he
[1:30:54] he's Saul was his you know his Jewish
[1:30:56] name Paul is his Roman name and he's
[1:31:00] he's getting some influence here he's
[1:31:02] he's he's a bad boy so far but you see
[1:31:06] then he's
[1:31:07] converted and God knows what he's doing
[1:31:10] so we're going to jump over a few things
[1:31:12] here because not going to preach the
[1:31:13] whole part of the U book of Acts but you
[1:31:18] see when you don't understand how God's
[1:31:20] going to do something that looks
[1:31:22] impossible oh Lord why why that's not
[1:31:25] your position to ask why your position
[1:31:29] yes Lord I will be done we'll walk
[1:31:32] quietly so always remember the sign that
[1:31:36] of Psalms 46 uh 10 be
[1:31:40] still I'm God got to figure it out don't
[1:31:43] need your opinions you all got chicken
[1:31:46] brains
[1:31:48] relax so God
[1:31:51] doesn't um need our opinion
[1:31:54] he only needs our obedience that's all
[1:31:57] he wants just obey we got such a simple
[1:32:01] message only believe don't get any
[1:32:04] simpler than that amen so here's young
[1:32:06] Saul zealous government agent looking
[1:32:09] for those that are not complying just
[1:32:12] like the people that come around here
[1:32:13] once in a while check the lights are too
[1:32:15] bright or you know Park cars are Park in
[1:32:17] the wrong place that's their job see
[1:32:19] who's not complying with the rules you
[1:32:21] know that was S no guard for human
[1:32:24] rights no profiling no problem and if
[1:32:27] you even looked at you were part of the
[1:32:28] way but one day he's on his road to
[1:32:32] Damascus from Jerusalem that's 130 Mi
[1:32:36] Northeast and so it's probably 4 day
[1:32:39] Journey who knows they're on Horseback
[1:32:41] and he's going along with his helpers
[1:32:44] got his you know government issued
[1:32:47] uniform on and um if he found anybody
[1:32:52] that closely resembled as part of the
[1:32:56] way like sisters dressed right or men
[1:32:59] with a proper haircut anybody that
[1:33:01] looked like a
[1:33:02] Christian he didn't stop and ask
[1:33:04] questions and you know all your history
[1:33:06] you look like it you're going with me so
[1:33:09] he's on his way to Damascus because he
[1:33:12] had already begged the high priest give
[1:33:15] me orders I got to go get these people
[1:33:16] he didn't wait for the mail to come he
[1:33:18] went and begged for him so he's got
[1:33:20] these arrest warrants and he tells his
[1:33:23] story through the book of Acts but we
[1:33:24] put it all together here it was a bright
[1:33:26] hot sunny day like today but about
[1:33:30] 120° and he's going along on his horse
[1:33:32] they're Mo moving along they're getting
[1:33:33] close to Damascus and U it's about noon
[1:33:38] and all of a sudden there's a much
[1:33:39] brighter light appeared now the Noonday
[1:33:42] Sun's about as bright as it gets much
[1:33:44] brighter light appeared Shone all around
[1:33:46] them and knocked everybody off their
[1:33:48] horses okay such a bright light they're
[1:33:51] very confused they're fear less
[1:33:54] Commander the Pharisee in charge of the
[1:33:56] anti-christian campaign is now faed down
[1:33:58] in the dirt oh this doesn't look too
[1:34:01] good and uh his uniform is all dirty and
[1:34:05] it looks like he's talking to himself we
[1:34:07] really got a
[1:34:08] problem they all Saw The Light they all
[1:34:11] fell off their horses and they all heard
[1:34:13] a sound but only Saul heard the voice in
[1:34:17] the Hebrew tongue thank you God speaks
[1:34:20] to you in language that you can
[1:34:22] understand that's why I gave you brother
[1:34:24] Dave for for pastor language you can
[1:34:27] understand and
[1:34:29] so um he said the voice said Saul Saul
[1:34:33] why are you persecuting me now Saul
[1:34:35] hadn't been persecuted anybody in
[1:34:37] particular just anybody that looked like
[1:34:38] a Christian
[1:34:41] okay because they acted like Christians
[1:34:44] and he said well Lord who are you and so
[1:34:48] what's this all this bright light and
[1:34:50] everything I am Jesus of Nazareth the
[1:34:53] one that you have been persecuting along
[1:34:55] with all my people and immediately what
[1:34:58] do you think he flashed in his mind the
[1:35:01] death of Steven back there because when
[1:35:03] that happened he's a young man over
[1:35:04] there watching the stuff but he's
[1:35:06] watching that young man die and he falls
[1:35:07] on his knees and he goes
[1:35:09] down and if you haven't seen the movie
[1:35:11] that Hollywood put out a few years ago
[1:35:14] Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ they stick
[1:35:17] right with the scriptures wonderful so
[1:35:19] anyway he remembered the Steven's death
[1:35:22] and immediately he's totally disarmed
[1:35:24] it's the end of the road I'm faced down
[1:35:26] in the dirt bright light hear this voice
[1:35:29] from heaven and he had to yield
[1:35:32] completely amen and
[1:35:36] so he um you know had given up he
[1:35:40] couldn't go any F farther and so he's um
[1:35:46] now what do you want me to do uh okay so
[1:35:50] I I see that you're you've got me arise
[1:35:52] and go into d Mascus and that's a whole
[1:35:55] other story we're not going to go into
[1:35:56] it but you know the fact is that he
[1:35:59] preached for many years Paul traveled uh
[1:36:03] about 10,000 miles in 30 years and he um
[1:36:07] he had a lot of converts he had a lot of
[1:36:10] you know uh Ministry going on but in the
[1:36:17] in the chapter um 20 I believe it is uh
[1:36:20] he's already been to several places
[1:36:23] remember he didn't have a white stallion
[1:36:26] didn't have an SUV didn't have a bicycle
[1:36:30] he
[1:36:31] walked maybe on a horse sometimes but
[1:36:34] now
[1:36:36] um he's over in the city of traz chapter
[1:36:40] 20 and the early churches were
[1:36:43] specifically warned against submitting
[1:36:46] themselves to the bondage of any
[1:36:48] legalistic Obedience of Sabbath days in
[1:36:51] other words that's the way the Jews did
[1:36:52] it now remember that's all they had
[1:36:56] Jesus said over in I think Matthew 10 go
[1:36:58] only to the house of Israel because the
[1:37:01] scripture says he came to his own his
[1:37:03] own received him not so they've been all
[1:37:06] the early people were Jews Jewish
[1:37:08] Believers but now that the gospel has
[1:37:11] come they didn't want to continue in
[1:37:13] those same Traditions they wanted
[1:37:15] something a little different okay and so
[1:37:17] these early churches voluntarily chose
[1:37:20] the first day of the week as an
[1:37:21] appropriate time for fellowship and
[1:37:23] worship ship in remembrance of the day
[1:37:26] our Lord arose that's what we call
[1:37:29] Resurrection Sunday you know so that's
[1:37:31] recorded in all the Gospels it was a new
[1:37:33] day new people new
[1:37:36] creation and the observance of the first
[1:37:38] day of the week is in many of the early
[1:37:40] writings even ireneus in the second
[1:37:43] Church age so here's Paul having
[1:37:45] communion service with the Saints and
[1:37:47] traz in chapter 20 of Acts and um uh if
[1:37:52] you read the story carefully it looks
[1:37:54] like they're in a bit of a hurry and we
[1:37:56] don't know what time they started church
[1:37:58] but the fact is that he's leaving the
[1:38:00] next day he's got a lot to say he's
[1:38:03] God's messenger of the hour the very
[1:38:05] eager disciples they wanted to hear
[1:38:07] everything he had to tell them and um
[1:38:10] and at midnight he's still preaching so
[1:38:12] we're not going to go that far but just
[1:38:15] warning you we do have scripture so in
[1:38:18] verse 8 of chapter 20 we have the fact
[1:38:21] that and there were many lights in the
[1:38:23] sheer chamber I love the book of Acts
[1:38:25] got all the details they didn't have
[1:38:27] these kind of Lights okay we didn't have
[1:38:30] these kind of Lights a few years ago but
[1:38:32] they didn't have lights they had torches
[1:38:34] on the wall fire that produces heat it's
[1:38:39] midnight people are getting
[1:38:41] tired and so says here in the upper
[1:38:44] chamber and they sat in the window now
[1:38:47] they're on the third floor and there's
[1:38:50] no screens there's no glass there's just
[1:38:51] open windows and there's a man sitting
[1:38:54] in the window and he fell asleep in
[1:38:59] church imagine that y'all didn't invent
[1:39:02] that either did
[1:39:04] you hey I have fallen asleep in
[1:39:07] church I was in Trinidad where it's 90°
[1:39:10] every day we had early you know Sunday
[1:39:13] morning immediately we go to this big
[1:39:16] Feast oh we got to go we got to go
[1:39:18] because there's another church over
[1:39:19] there three about a thousand people got
[1:39:22] to go well here I'm sitting on the
[1:39:24] platform 95° out and I just filled up I
[1:39:29] fell
[1:39:31] asleep just human so he fell asleep as
[1:39:36] Paul was long preaching went to sleep
[1:39:39] and he fell out of the third floor and
[1:39:42] he's dead on the
[1:39:44] pavement yeah it
[1:39:46] happened and Paul went down fell upon
[1:39:49] Him braced him trouble not no he's okay
[1:39:52] life is in him and when he therefore was
[1:39:54] come up again so they came back up the
[1:39:55] third
[1:39:56] floor and they had
[1:39:59] communion even until the sun came up and
[1:40:02] then he
[1:40:04] left all through the the Bible all
[1:40:07] through the New Testament through the
[1:40:08] book of Acts we have they had communion
[1:40:10] in in the chapter two I think it is they
[1:40:13] met every day because Jesus has just
[1:40:15] told them do this in remembrance of me
[1:40:18] we have no scripture to uh remember his
[1:40:22] birth
[1:40:23] oh but America has made a big deal out
[1:40:26] of it we we going to De grandkids got to
[1:40:30] have presents and a lot of times they
[1:40:32] don't wait till
[1:40:34] Christmas
[1:40:36] anyway scripture commands us to remember
[1:40:39] the Lord's
[1:40:41] death and we have songs we have
[1:40:44] scripture we have prophets
[1:40:47] preaching and where there's no mention
[1:40:50] of the Cross where there's no mention of
[1:40:52] the blood you got a dead church we have
[1:40:55] to keep that before the people that's
[1:40:57] why this cross is up here that long part
[1:41:00] that's your prayer life that's your
[1:41:02] responsibility if you keep your prayer
[1:41:04] life straight God will take care of the
[1:41:08] horizontal and so that's why it's
[1:41:09] important to stay
[1:41:11] balanced and so those are the few words
[1:41:13] I wanted to share with you from the book
[1:41:15] of Acts to let you know that God is real
[1:41:19] and we're not going to preach long
[1:41:21] because I know some people are tired we
[1:41:23] just want to make it real to you let you
[1:41:25] know that God still is on the throne
[1:41:28] it's still important to to observe the
[1:41:31] um Lord's Supper because to be a
[1:41:34] Christian okay first there's I'm a
[1:41:36] sinner so you repent and you're baptized
[1:41:39] okay now you you're looking more like a
[1:41:41] Believer but then you got to be here
[1:41:43] with your presence you got to show up
[1:41:46] can't you send in your tithe money well
[1:41:47] you got to be here and you got to take
[1:41:50] communion that constitutes a member of
[1:41:52] the church
[1:41:53] all others well thank you very much but
[1:41:56] uh you know you're missing a little bit
[1:41:58] something so we want to proceed into the
[1:42:01] communion
[1:42:02] service we're going to uh stand together
[1:42:05] and read from the book of First
[1:42:07] Corinthians all the brothers bring out
[1:42:09] the elements but you see um Paul wasn't
[1:42:14] present at the Lord's Supper in John 13
[1:42:18] he received it by Revelation so
[1:42:20] therefore our Prophet says
[1:42:23] lay everything aside seek Revelation
[1:42:26] that's more important than anything so
[1:42:28] in 1 Corinthians 11:23 I have received
[1:42:31] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:42:33] unto you in other words I brought you
[1:42:34] the Revelation that the Lord Jesus the
[1:42:37] same night in which he was betrayed he
[1:42:39] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:42:41] he break it and said take eat this is my
[1:42:44] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:42:47] remembrance of
[1:42:48] me after the same manner also he took
[1:42:51] the cup when he had SED said saying this
[1:42:54] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:42:57] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[1:42:59] remembrance of me in other words these
[1:43:01] these are things we do remembering his
[1:43:04] death until he
[1:43:06] comes for as often as you eat this bread
[1:43:09] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:43:11] Lord's death until he comes wherefore
[1:43:13] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:43:15] the cup of the Lord
[1:43:17] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:43:20] and blood of the Lord but let every man
[1:43:21] examine himself that's that's why we're
[1:43:23] here to examine okay Lord is there
[1:43:25] anything lacking is there anybody I
[1:43:27] spoke evil to examine yourself you see
[1:43:31] um and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:43:34] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:43:36] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:43:38] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:43:40] Lord's body for this caused many are
[1:43:43] weak and sickly among you and many sleep
[1:43:46] they've died for if we would judge
[1:43:48] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:43:51] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:43:54] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:43:57] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:43:59] when you come together to eat t one for
[1:44:02] another If any man hungry let him eat at
[1:44:04] home in other words don't come here
[1:44:06] hungry and and you know this isn't
[1:44:07] sandwich time no and brother brandom had
[1:44:12] a a tradition of his own that after the
[1:44:16] communion service you don't stand around
[1:44:18] LLY gag and talk about baseball you have
[1:44:21] the communion service the foot washing
[1:44:24] you get in your car go home if the
[1:44:26] children need a little something just he
[1:44:29] he wouldn't eat after that not till
[1:44:31] midnight and a lot of times he was
[1:44:32] leaving town but um you have food at
[1:44:36] home that she come not together unto
[1:44:38] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:44:41] order when I come so those are the
[1:44:43] instructions set for forth by Paul and
[1:44:47] are the brothers bringing no so if you
[1:44:50] come up we'll pray over the elements
[1:44:57] Bread's already been baked
[1:44:59] and and broken we're going to pray over
[1:45:02] the elements Heavenly Father we thank
[1:45:04] you for this occasion we can be here
[1:45:06] together we thank you Lord for faithful
[1:45:10] followers faithful deacons faithful
[1:45:13] Ministry Lord we therefore now bless
[1:45:15] this bread that it might be
[1:45:16] encouragement and strength and healing
[1:45:19] to the people's body we've come in faith
[1:45:22] believing Lord likewise we have the the
[1:45:24] wine that's been prepared we pray that
[1:45:27] you would bless it may this be a blessed
[1:45:30] occasion there's healing in the cup help
[1:45:33] us now we ask in Jesus name amen amen
[1:45:39] okay one other thing is they're getting
[1:45:41] ready bringing the people
[1:45:43] up
[1:45:45] um in Jeffersonville it's a small Church
[1:45:49] 400 maybe squeezed into a smaller area
[1:45:53] and so one of the Believers one of the
[1:45:56] members had a neighbor the neighbor was
[1:45:58] the Church of Christ they have a whole
[1:46:00] different program so the believer said
[1:46:03] to the Church of Christman his neighbor
[1:46:05] hey come on church with me kept asking
[1:46:07] him to come well finally the brother
[1:46:10] said fine I'll go with you tonight well
[1:46:12] it was communion night oh and see we
[1:46:15] have closed communion where it's only us
[1:46:17] or open communion if you say you're a
[1:46:18] Believer you can partake so he comes up
[1:46:23] well by the time he gets up here to take
[1:46:25] his
[1:46:26] communion brother Neville says to
[1:46:28] brother brandham uh brother brandham

[1:46:33] embarrassing so brother brand says we'll
[1:46:36] just pray so the Church of Christ man he

[1:46:42] so he's you
[1:46:44] know he's watching while they're praying
[1:46:47] and his testimony was that while brother

[1:58:41] put into the heart of judas's scariot
[1:58:42] Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing
[1:58:46] that the father had given all things
[1:58:48] into his hands and that he was come from
[1:58:50] God and went to God he rised from supper
[1:58:53] laid aside His Garment took a towel and
[1:58:56] girded
[1:58:57] himself after that he poured water into
[1:59:00] a
[1:59:01] basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:59:04] feet he had never done this before
[1:59:06] apparently and to wipe them with the
[1:59:08] towel where worth He was GED and he came
[1:59:10] to Simon Peter you know Simon had a bit
[1:59:12] of a mental problem he talked at the
[1:59:14] wrong time he came to Simon
[1:59:17] Peter Simon already saw what he was
[1:59:20] doing and uh Peter said to him
[1:59:23] Lord you you're washing my feet and
[1:59:27] Jesus said what I do now you don't
[1:59:30] understand but you will know soon after
[1:59:33] and Peter said to him you'll never wash
[1:59:36] my feet Jesus answer answered if I wash
[1:59:39] thee not thou H has no part with me so
[1:59:42] then Simon he just couldn't find balance
[1:59:45] you know he said well Lord then not miss
[1:59:48] my feet but give me a bath wash
[1:59:50] everything
[1:59:52] and Jesus said he that is washed needeth
[1:59:54] not only to save his wash his feet but
[1:59:58] is clean every quit and you're clean but
[2:00:00] not all because he knew that you know he
[2:00:03] knew who should betray him therefore he
[2:00:05] said you're not all clean so after he
[2:00:07] had washed their feet and had taken his
[2:00:09] garments would sit down again he said
[2:00:12] unto them do you know what I've done you
[2:00:15] all call me master and Lord and you say
