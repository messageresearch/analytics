moving on it and as the word goes forth that he may just come and speak to our hearts and that he may move on the way that he never moved before amen certainly welcome everyone in the house of god this morning we're going to invite brother mike for our psalm reading and our prayer this morning amen who certainly welcome all our visitors everyone god bless you this morning amen [Music] [Music] let's go ahead and bow our heads welcome him in our midst father we come before you this morning just so grateful for every opportunity we have to come into your presence father as the song says we you are very much welcome in our midst the whole purpose of our gathering lord is that we might be present with you and have fellowship with you and hear from you and to sit at your feet lord to learn of you and to become more like you and we want to just commit the service to you lord that you would have your way in every heart lord that the word that goes forth would be according to your will lord that you be present in our midst in every aisle to touch every heart and to meet every need lord you know every need that's come through that door and lord you already know every victory that's going to walk back out lord we commit the service to you once again that you would have your way in jesus name amen good morning we're going to go ahead and turn back over to psalm 119 this morning and there's a verse in there it started in psalm 119 verse 97 and the verse 97 has this makes a statement it says oh how love i thy law it is my meditation all the day and then it says in verse 99 i have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies are my meditation you know i got to thinking about that statement my meditation and it raises the question what is my meditation you know unfortunately like so many statements or words or whatnot that have become overused and kind of corrupted in our day whenever somebody says the word meditation it draws up pictures of something like sitting cross-legged on a beach with your palms together maybe some new age music you know the mental exercise that corporate america asks you to go through that's good for your mental health or somehow associated with an eastern religion or new age you know but meditation is quite simply what it is that you meditate on you know webster's dictionary defines meditate like this to focus one's thoughts on to reflect or ponder on something and there's different synonyms that it often will come up with the words that mean the same thing and here's some of the statements to chew on something to contemplate to consider to weigh or turn something over in your mind to mull it over here's a word i like ruminate which is the same word that's used to describe sheep that are chewing the cud meditate what is my meditation what am i meditating on what do i dwell on what do i have my mind on what am i chewing over right now or yesterday or tomorrow you know whatever the answer to that question is that is your meditation you know strangely enough the word meditation is only used six times in the scriptures only by david and only in the psalms and twice is some that we just answered but some that we just read but here's here's a verse psalm 5 1. it says give ear to my words o lord consider my meditation amen so david is actually asking the lord to look on to consider to observe the thing that david is meditating on here's another one psalm 19 14 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight well that's that's an interesting statement the question is i wonder how much of my meditation is acceptable in his sight something he can accept what am i chewing on what am i turning over in my mind what am i dwelling on is that something he can accept you know paul said in ephesians 5 that we should walk as children of the light proving demonstrating what is acceptable unto the lord is my meditation acceptable is what i meditate on is what i dwell on is what i'm chewing on acceptable you know what you meditate on has an effect you know there's a meditation that is acceptable to the lord but what is my meditation am i meditating on my circumstance am i meditating on my problems am i meditating on all the things that could go wrong in my meditation do i lay awake at night thinking about all the possible outcomes of my situation is that my meditation is my meditation the project i need to get done is it my education is it my career is it my favorite ball club and how well they're performing is it the news of the day social media gossip culture whatever it is is that what's occupying my meditation is my meditation acceptable to the lord you know what i like about psalm 119 here in verse 97 is it describes what an acceptable meditation is it says verse 97 oh how love i thy law it thy law thy word is my meditation all the day thy word is my constant meditation all the day that means there's no room for anything else the lord told joshua in joshua 1 8 this book of the law word shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night your constant meditation this is acceptable meditation that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written thereon for then then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thou shalt have good success joshua was told not to meditate on the battlefield but on the word not to meditate on the battle or the struggle but the word you know acceptable meditation is being totally committed totally focused totally chewing on the word a exclusive diet eat the book all of it let nothing remain until morning you know there's an effect of exclusive meditation on the word it says in verse 98 99 and psalm 119 that we're just about to read thou through thy commandments thy word hast made me wiser than mine enemies for they are ever with me i have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies thy word is my meditation the effect of meditation total meditation on the word is overcoming every enemy and being smarter than even the experts and it isn't because that you're going to have an answer to every question it isn't because you're going to study and have a scripture ready for every possible thing that might come up or or be able to mentally conceive jesus said in luke 21 when he was talking to his disciples settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which your adversaries shall not be able to gain say or resist there's a difference between meditation and study right doesn't mean that you're going to have the answer to every possible outcome but here's what it does mean by being in a condition of constantly chewing on constantly dwelling on constantly thinking on the word doesn't matter what the need is or what the circumstance what circumstance arises or what step you need to take the moment you need to take an action for the moment you have a decision that is presented or an action that needs to be taken you'll be so influenced by the constant meditation on the word that the answer will come forth the step you need to take will be taken the decision you need to make will be apparent because your sole focus will be the meditation on his work so what is my meditation what am i chewing on you know am i meditating on the battlefield or the nightly news or is this book of the law not to part out of my mouth let's just read that section of psalm 119 verse 97 to 104 this morning let's read that together oh how i love thy law it is my meditation all the day thou through thy commandments has made me wiser than mine enemies for they are ever with me i have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies are my meditation i understand more than the ancients because i keep thy precepts i have refrained my feet from every evil way that i might keep thy word i have not departed from thy judgments for thou hast taught me how sweet are thy words unto my taste yea sweeter than honey to my mouth through thy precepts i get understanding therefore i hate every false way amen oh this is the day this is the day that the lord has made that the lord has made oh i will rejoice and i will rejoice and be glad in is [Music] this is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] this morning [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music]

a very common song but the the part that i really loved says that we have kingdom authority that flows from his throne onto his own and i was thinking about the story brother branham gives of the police officer who didn't have very much power but the authority that he had would stop the traffic and last weekend uh the tape we listened to spoke of how the church has all the power but now the

oh [Music] amen [Music] hey man anybody want to go back no no no i can't believe where he's taken us from let's bow our heads in prayer this morning our gracious heavenly father lord we just approach your throne today and ask that you lift our hearts and our spirits father that you be with the many of us that are on vacation at this time and traveling father may they enjoy your presence where ever they are father those of us that have gathered here this morning father may we feast on your word may we feel your presence father would you minister to us what that we have need of father in our spirits in our minds in our bodies lord that your presence would be manifested father by your tender hand of mercy father we just commit this time into your hands lord and once again ask you to forgive us our trespasses father the failures that we have but our confession is that they're under the blood and they're thrown in the sea of god's forgetfulness to be remembered no more so we stand up this morning knowing that you've invited us to your table and father may we come with an appetite this morning that we could have the fullness of what you have for us today ask you to bless each one now in your precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles and you would turn with me to the book of romans in the um the 10th chapter of the book of romans and we want to read there uh before we read our scriptures we just want to wish john and christina a safe trip they're going back to riverside to help with the health of her parents for a season so as they go there and and are there for we don't know how long of a period of time but we want to keep them in prayer and then brother paul he also uh i believe is returning back to brazlerville to work he's in the neurology field and he's a a national commodity and they don't want to let him go so um we're just praying that the lord will open it up and then soon he'll be able to be here with us uh for that and then i leave for my mom's hundredth birthday you know i'm real proud that my mom's a hundred but it it kind of lets everybody know how old i am and uh you know i i feel good i feel good and i i hold on to that and my i believe my mom's a testimony to it they did a heart surgery on my mom i guess almost 15 years ago and they asked her says why do you want to give her heart surgery you know and it was a traumatic thing we went through her heart became hard as a rock we were there we prayed for her she got through every one of those doctors have been gone to meet their reward but mom's still alive so we're grateful for that so we're gonna go do that and then what before we read our scripture i certainly apologize to you for the conditions that you're having to deal with i hope the white dust doesn't track in your carpets and your cars but wipe your feet real good and here in a few weeks the parking lot will be ready and finished and it it'll be good we're going in the right direction so let's have faith amen you love the lord this morning we just want to fellowship with you this morning and i hope that it can be some real words of encouragement to you but let's read in romans the 10th chapter and and i have several titles for my sermon this morning so in the titles you can place it uh the what i like to call it is the simplicity of speaking the word the simplicity of speaking the word and then another title i would call it would be the manifestation of my confession and finally made ready by my confession so let us read the scripture here it says what but what say it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thine heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning we we know that god is hid in simplicity he's always chose that way of doing things he hides himself in simplicity and he reveals himself in the same and so in uh seeing that and thinking that in my heart i know that a lot of times there's a lot of emphasis put on this statement of speaking the word like you speak the word and you're going to make something happen and i think that's our a tendency that causes us sometimes to press an issue and you can't you can't force god to do anything and and but i think we have a great hearts desire to have god do something for us and god can only do for us what that he said he would do for us you know you can't ask god to do something that he didn't promise to do but you have a right to everything that he promised you have a right to it so we want to talk a little bit and and read to you and then we're going to play some a portion of tape because we want to talk a little bit about confession and the power of confession because confession is the way that a believer speaks the word you know it's not making up something in your mind and walking up to this piano and saying if you had faith you know uh you could uh speak to this uh piano and move uh that piano that's not what god promised he didn't promise that now we take that scripture and we say uh well he said if thou could believeth in thy heart thou could say to this mountain be moved or you could say to this tree be plucked up and uh and put in the sea but you have to understand that that wouldn't be in your heart to do that you understand in other words the purity of my heart the purpose of my heart the motive objective behind it is that you've got to even for your healing the prophet of god said that you've got to have a reason why that you want to be well now that that's quite a a quite an approach that that it's very simple you'd have to have a a reason for for doing something there's got to that reason has got to be generated from what's in your heart because a man believeth in his heart unto righteousness and that's that thing that we're going to end up with on the backside of our sermon this morning is the fact of the individual of our faith what it takes as an individual so we're talking about that we have a great desire to be ready i think that we should come to that realization that there is something that we are getting ready for we're not living to die we're dying to live we die daily daily we confess our faults daily we look at ourselves and we desire in our heart to be better and your heart is always what's going to finally speak out what's in your heart many people have come and asked for advice and not that i have advice to give or that i have any wisdom to share but because that i'm a pastor and they they they have respect of the office so they'd come in and they would say should i do this or should i do that and you find out that you could say no but they're going to do what's in their heart to do even the scripture said uh when when speaking he said do all that is in thine heart and and so there there's got to be a place in our heart that there's a real desire and and the real something that speaks out because what's in your heart is really what you're going to confess and confession is done in a lot of different ways you know just your very actions is a form of confession so i'd like to uh take a statement here and so we're talking about confession and confession is uh we make ourselves ready by our confession that that's the the way that our uh our very preparation for the christian life that we're going to live it comes from our confession so if i could say it like this that we are we are we can't go forward looking back there's no good in telling what that you were that's right if you you can't go forward on what that you were now we give our testimony and we say that this is what that i was but what we're confessing is what we are that's what our confession is and to go forward when you begin to think of going forward if if i could just express this in my lack of education but you're you're you're speaking what that you're going to be you're confessing where you're going you're not confessing where you've been you know uh you know you could say i've been here i've been here i've been here i've been here i've been here you can give all of a litany but when you finally get down to it you'll come back to where you are so i've been here okay but where am i that's where i've been but now is where i i all where i've been brings me to where i am now now the question is where am i going now to say that i'm going to go there i have to confess that i'm going there i'm going here and that's in the natural we would do that so if we could understand that in the spiritual it's the same thing you've got to confess where you're going you've got you've got to confess because your confession is what makes you ready and let's read a few statements and and and so that we can anchor up this down uh quickly this morning because i i believe that in in knowing these things and understanding these things and the power of your confession and understand that there is a part that you've got to play so in the simplicity of speaking the word people think that speaking the word makes it like it's some extra uh terrestrial uh power that you've got that you're going to you're going to uh speak the word and it's some mighty thing but the the the the the simplicity of speaking the word is so beautiful how does the believer speak the word that would be the question how do i get the faith to speak the word i i've seen it and i i've heard so many times in the uh the preaching of the gospel we get excited about speaking the word because it's a promise that's given to the bride she'll speak the word but what is she really doing when she speaks the word she's confessing what he said she's not creating new words she's believing what he said now in believing it this is what we we will point out here is that that belief cannot be held within and ever have it manifest that's right right because it's it's the manifestation of our confession is what we confess or speak i speak the word i confess the word and now that's what translates into the simplicity of the manifestation of the word and that's how i make myself ready i want to get ready the only thing that can make me ready is what the word of god look let's listen as brother brown he unfold these things he says somebody says how does divine healing does it does it last all the time now this is this is some real food for thought it lasts just as long as faith lasts and salvation lasts the same way just as long as faith lasts when you feel that you're not saved anymore you're not saved for it's by faith are you saved through grace and that's right now we're talking about the power of confession and the simplicity of speaking the word and and the the ability to overcome and make yourself ready by what you confess we know we speak of of seeing a well man and walking into it well you kind of confess the well man you have to confess what that you're going to be if you continue to confess what you are you will stay right there but you confessed and by speaking the word of confession you're actually moving forward and making yourself ready he said he says that's right when you come to the altar what do you do you confess your sins and ask god to forgive you and then in your heart now get it in your heart you have to believe that he has forgiven you is that right you have to believe that well if you don't believe he's forgiven you're going to stay right there and keep confessing and confessing year after year after year confessing confessing running to the altar you're not going forward and you're not getting ready you're stuck i think that you're stuck right there if you don't accept it and you don't believe it he said said you have to believe that he has forgiven you is that right you have to believe that then you walk away from the platform and then you have to confess it first then you are saved you can't keep it under a bushel you will lose it right now how many people have waited they believe that god's done something for them but they don't want to confess it till they see it then they're no longer confessing to their faith it's no longer faith it's no longer faith then then what it is is oh i've seen it we don't walk by sight we walk by faith now let's just follow this simplicity of speaking the word the simplicity of speaking the word we get this idea of speaking the word at some ministerial giants that speak the word the simple child can speak the word he said he said if you keep it under the bushel basket you'll lose it right now you've got to confess it and tell everyone that you're glad now what if you walk outside and somebody says there's nothing to it you just got excited at the altar how many christians on here let's see your hands all right oh my hundreds percent i believe all right each one of you god saved in the same way by faith each one of us is same the same way every single one of us god convicted our hearts we were sorry for our sins and we accepted that not by our righteousness for our righteousness as filthy rags we accepted it because he said so we accept his word in our heart and then we confess that word or speak that word in simplicity confessing what that he has done for us and say that i'm saved now when you speak it that is now what you become you become saved [Music] because you've got to speak that that's the simplicity of speaking the word you made yourself ready by your confession but if you keep it under a bushel basket you'll lose it because you got to speak it the simplicity of speaking the word it's so simple i get embarrassed sometimes i think i'm going to come up and and we're so trying to be caught up into the mysteries but he said if i speak with the tongues of mens and angels and understand all the mysteries and have not charity it profiteth me nothing so you understand god can do things for you but they're not on unprofitable they're not profitable and they don't manifest because it's the manifestation of your confession we'll just read these statements i hope they just grab hold of you he said he says each one have we been saved the same way by faith you could come here and cry and pray and pray and cry all this week and next week and a month and you'd be still be a sinner until you accept him by faith okay so if you're coming every month right and you're at the altar saying i'm a sinner i'm a sinner i'm a sinner what are you you're confessing where you are you understand there's a difference if confessing where you are but by faith you're confessing what you're going to be he's like he said you until you accept the face is that right it's not your crying that saves you it's your faith that saves you and when you accept it you believe it and somebody says let's see if you look any different why you still got brown eyes you're just the same as you was you can't show nothing that you are saved you're only testifying of the unseen what is faith it's the evidence of things hoped for but not yet seen so abraham it was imputed to abraham for righteousness because he confessed what he was going to be the simplicity of speaking the word this simplicity when you rise up from the altar when i rose up from the altar i still had all my records i've still had a a very portrait in my place of bob dylan that was painted by an artist it probably would have been worth thousands and thousands of dollars now they came in and painted it on my wall and everything and when when i i got saved i didn't look saved everything that was around me was unsaved because i lived in an unsaved world but how was i going to change the world how was i going to make myself ready i couldn't go in there and make myself ready till i confessed it nobody could see that i was saved i looked like the same hippie i dressed like the same hippie i still lived in the same psychedelic dungeon i still had all my hippie stuff everywhere but i remember calling my cousin up and saying tommy i got saved i'm gonna paint that my walls he said don't paint that portrait he came over and took a skill saw and cut this great big gigantic portrait out of my wall at first evidence that's right my confession started to manifest because i started speaking today of speaking the word i'm saved i'm not going this way no more i'm not going to do this no more i'm going to be different and then my confession began to manifest the portrait was gone the music was gone all the psychedelic things were gone the paraphernalia was gone so eventually what took place my confession began to manifest i could start back and i could see the manifestation of my confession because it was the simplicity of speaking the word we're confessing the unseen i'm not confessing what i am i'm confessing what god promised i could be that's what i'm confessing i'm confessing i'm an overcomer i'm confessing that there's grace to overcome he says you're only testifying of the unseen your faith says you're saved then what do you do you believe you're saved then you say you're saved then you act like you're saved then you associate with those that are saved and it works righteousness you know nobody wants to go through the process anymore you confess with your mouth because those that believe are not ashamed the word is even nigh in your mouth but you confess it unto righteousness and you can and you believe in your heart under righteousness is that what the scripture says he says then you you act like you're saved and it works righteousness because that's what your heart's desire is your heart's desire is to be free you want to be free confess it's a profession of your faith he said and then everybody knows you're saved isn't that right well he was wounded for our transgressions and by his stripes we were healed jesus third hebrews 3 1 is the high priest of our confession now any one of you scholars knows that the word profession is translated the same as confession he's the high priest now here it is get it now and you won't even have to come here to be healed you'll be healed right where you're sitting i believe it's possible now for people in this building to be healed right right now i've seen it i've seen the time when there wasn't a wheelchair left in the building and not a a crutch or a blind or deaf person of where thousands were sitting one night was speaking and they've seen a miracle performed by god they just accepted it right there and there wasn't a caught wheelchair or nothing but the what was emptied and they walked out then the delia illinois v-a-n-d-a illinois that's right in a big tent meeting now here's what it is friends see if you can get it if you're a christian because you believe that you're a christian now let's just hold that because we're just going to keep building here because we want to understand i want to get done with this we'll listen to 30 minutes of tape he said he said he said because you believe you're a christian and it's all settled because he's the high priest of your confession he's what is the high priest he's the administrator of your confession you confess it he performs it he said now notice he's the high priest of your confession you get what i mean what you confess you are that's what you are so that's how you're made ready by your confession you might say i'm not ready don't be stuck there lord help me get ready i'm going to do what it's necessary to get ready i'm going to get rid of this i'm going to do this by god's grace i'm going to i'm going to overcome you start confessing what that you're going to be and now he's the high priest that's going to administer your confession and he closes here and this particular tape broke off and there's not any more after these statements he says you get what i mean what you confess you are that's what you are any man will never live any further or any higher than what he believes he's living you talk about moving up you talk about coming to higher ground you take a man that's talking about drinking all the time he talks about drinking he thinks about drinking he drops right down into that category and becomes a drunkard a man that's always thinking vulgar things and looking at vulgar things he thinks of vulgar things he reads vulgarity he will become what he confesses let's go on and read a few more statements because you we where i want you to tie the service together in your own self this morning the simplicity of speaking the word is not some fantastic changing something in the natural realm because these signs follow them that believe you change what you are you make yourself ready by your confession you can't look in the mirror you're going to see what you see in the mirror but if you can look in the mirror and say you know something i'm not what i want to be i'm not what i should be but i'm not what i used to be now you've got a confession that he can act upon and move forward you you're confessing and by your confession you're making yourself ready it ain't my works it's not my power it's not by might it's but by my spirit saith the lord we we begin to confess i i confess i believe the word of god and i confess the spirit of god can convict me of sin and change me i've just initiated the process of change i have spoken to the unseen i'm not i'm not testifying to what i see faith is the evidence of things hoped for i'm hoping in my heart that i'm going to become a good better christian have more love of the spirit have these things and therefore the simplicity of speaking the word let the love of god be shed abroad in my heart by the holy spirit you want more love confess you want more love this is out of a message called law now paul speaking here of the valley or the shadow rather of the law being a shadow of good things to come could never make the worshiper perfect so oh that excites me in other words you can do all the good works and everything that you want and keep every rule and pay all your tithes and and all your offerings and do everything and it'll never make perfect there's only one thing that can make you perfect and that's the word so when you confess that he can make me perfect you've made your first step to being perfect then he goes he says then he goes on to show what the perfection is it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people today they say well i'm weak my faith is not very much i am he says i am not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language then see you must never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i am saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart do you believe in divine healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts and everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it why because you're going to be what you confess you understand your confession is your first move to perfection it's your confession that's going to make you ready can you imagine always going on i'm not a very good christian i'm not saved i'm not that i'm not that well i'm real guilty of that i do it all the time you know i'm not very good preacher i don't can't do it i'm not very smart and i forget that stuff i say what the prophet says that makes me one of the greatest preachers on earth i don't have to be the greatest preacher you understand but i know that when i meet the throne i'll meet my judgments but i am not going to be condemned for what i said or what i shared let's put it that way i'm going to say what he says and share that he said never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when you start that you don't don't entertain it well you say i can help the thoughts from coming well that's like the farmer that said he couldn't stop he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he sure could stop them from roosting why if they roost you're going to confess it so that's so that's the a good thing see you can help the thoughts when they come but don't don't don't entertain them just pass it on no sir jesus is my savior all things are mine by god i'm going to keep them i'm going to testify of them and god can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you see he's the high priest of our confession is that right hebrews 3 he said that he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us what we accept and believe and confess your confession is what's making you ready i'm a member of the bride i believe the end time message of the hour i believe there's deliverance i believe there's healing i believe there's overcoming power lord i don't like this habit i have i believe you're gonna deliver me i don't like the weakness of my flesh but i believe that through your strength i made perfect i can do all things through christ jesus who saved me not by my spirit lord not by my strength lord but by your spirit now you're confessing and by your confessing your the simplicity of speaking the word you have actually spoke the word concerning yourself and what you're going to be and what you're going to become if you confess where you are or confess where you've been you're not moving forward but your confession is what makes you ready and and you're made ready by your confession because you'll see your confession manifested this is in proving his word paragraph 2 15. the bible said that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever he says he's a high priest sitting there making intercession upon our confession we have to confess it first before he can be a high priest because he only intercedes to our confessions what's the high priest remember he went in all the people would lay their hands on the calf they would all confess their sins and then they would bring that calf and they'd slaughter that calf and they'd offer that calf up so then that's what the high priest did he went and made the intercession based on what the people confessed and what they were looking for god that's what he went in to represent now someone that didn't confess someone that didn't lay their hands on the calves someone that didn't make the offering he couldn't make no intercession for that and it's the same he can't change the way he does things he's not going to intercede on anything you don't confess because he wants to identify himself with you he wants to be identified with your confession so when you the simplicity of speaking the word you speak the promise you confess the promise now he's got something he can identify with he becomes the interceder he carries out and manifests your confession and then you have the manifestation of your confession you people are looking for manifestations without confession but it's the simplicity of speaking the word he says he's the sitting there make intercession upon your confession we have to confess it first because he only intercedes on your confession is that right minister brothers he only intercedes upon our confession what we confess that he is what he has done for us not what he will do he has already done it that's what you're confessing that's why it becomes the manifestation of your confession we have to confess that he's done it he was wounded for our transgression by his stripes we were healed remember sis when the lord come down that's the only thing he said by his stripes i'm healed just keep testifying to it that's the truth do you feel it no does it look like it no but what are you testifying too i'm testifying to the unseen i'm testifying that faith is the evidence of what that i'm hoping for and i haven't seen because he's the high priest that's going to work upon my intercessions he says and he's sitting at the right hand of the father making intercession upon his death burial and resurrection hallelujah there he is even now lord whatsoever ye ask the father god will do it for there he sets his majesty sitting by the side of the father at the right hand of him upon their making intercession upon anything that you'll ask him and confess that he's done it he'll confess it before the father how many know that's what jesus taught over 13 places he makes this statement if you'll confess me before men i will confess you before the father what are you doing when you confess the word what are you doing when you confess a promise what are you doing when you say by his stripes i am healed you're testifying of him and if you're testifying of him he's there to make intercession of the to the father on behalf of your confession now he becomes the high priest and god responds only to what you confess that is the simplicity of speaking the word it isn't this great big bride that's going to rise up you know what i mean and it's going to go change things because we're not confessing we're confessing to what he's already done that's what we're testifying to he's already sent the messenger we're just testifying that there's life in the words that he speaks there's revelation there's spiritual food and disease and there's more there to eat if you don't think there's any more food in the message to eat then you're not going to look for food you're not going to find food if you don't believe there's no more revelation for you in there there's going to be no more revelation for you if you don't believe there's any hope then there's no hope but when you cry out and you confess he's faithful and just to hear your confession up there making intercession upon anything that you ask him and confess he's done he'll confess it before the father what more do you want wow think of it all i have to do is confess his promise believe in my heart not hide it back not puddle under a bushel basket but confess what he's done now he's up there talking to the father the father of all light what more do you want say lord i accept you as my healer i'll never say nothing else but what i'm healed from now on amen that settles it he can't do nothing for you till you first confess it he's the high priest of our confession in that case not even your faith and even couldn't be faith until you confess it you've got to accept faith believe it and confess it that it's already done because faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen amen amen and he makes this statement whatever you confess that he that he is to you that's what he confesses before the father from whence he shall come in his power so we trust that that's a foundation what time is it nobody knows what's great hallelujah acts 10 after 10. glory because i want to play 30 minutes of a message and this is like a segue or we're going to change gear because we talked about your confession and we talked about your confession making you ready and we talked about your confession being manifested these next few minutes and we'll close right after brother brown speaks billy will come up and lead songs this is brother branham explaining to you your individual responsibility to make yourself ready okay now you make yourself ready by your confession you confess you step into it you've changed he's made intercession you grow and become more spiritual more like christ by your confession now you've got a responsibility individually today to make yourself ready is everybody good for just 30 minutes 30 more minutes so there's more years than nays the nays can leave because we want a house full of faith don't we amen you can get up and stretch you can do these things with church i'm talking about hidden secrets hidden secrets that the prophets laid down we went all the way from 50 all the way to 65. him saying the church is made ready by their confession they change by their confession watch what comes out of your mouth never never never make a negative confession you're throwing poison in the pot let's renew our minds by the washing of the water of the word so if i this is this this morning i want you to take this to heart what he's saying because he's talking about the lay member he's talking about the christian he's talking about the responsibility we're starting on paragraph 92 of the secret uh i think it's called the secret the sudden secret going away of the church god bless you this morning i hope it's not too late for you lord richard bless you steve so good to see you my brother god bless you god's going to fix that that's the word of the lord thank you oh what we need today is a calling together of getting ready i'm not depending on the preacher but you as an individual before god make yourself ready for the coming of the lord to escape all this corruption amen no matter what they call you and what action they take that doesn't change god one bit god will do it just the same he's defending and waiting on us oh my some people say well i go to church on sunday morning i listen to our pastor which is a fine preacher that's good i appreciate that then you are the america the world whoever it is but it takes more than a good message from the pulpit it takes your life it takes you to get ready in revelations the 19th chapter and the seventh verse the bible said that speaking of the bride of christ she has made herself ready she made herself ready and you as a member of this bride you've got to make yourself ready some time ago a minister was preaching in and there was a man who had been attending his church for oh quite a lengthy time and he came that morning up to the altar and he said pastor i now wish to give my a testimony and my surrender to the lord jesus which i have done last night and the pastor said well uh i am sure glad to hear about that john to know that you have decided to finally come and give yourself to the lord because we don't want to hurt your feelings but we know that you have been very wicked and we know you have mistreated your family you've gambled away your money and you drank it up and live a horrible life and your family went without and it gives my heart joy this morning to know that you have come forward now and going to surrender yourself to the lord jesus to become a different person to serve him he said thank you pastor he said then just what uh i want to ask you something what sermon did i preach or what text did i use these are what song was sung in the church in the hymns that made you so decide to do this and as the man looked at him in the face with the tears running off his cheeks he said pastor it was none of your sermons though as good as they were it was none of the choirs singing are the specials though as good as they were he said then would you tell this congregation why you have made this decision he said i work with a man who is a christian and i've said everything to him i've called him a holy roller i've called him a religious fanatic and everything and it doesn't bother him a bit but he lives such our life till finally in my heart all along he has what a place that i want to be like that man and that's the reason i asked him to lead me to christ i wanted the christ that he serves you see god does work through the pastor to get his church ready he works through the songs to get his church ready and he works through you to get his church ready if your pastor would fail and continually to fail you'd hunt you another pastor quickly you would do that if your choir didn't sing right or your souls wasn't right you would say to the director the one who has the music don't let them sing them or they just make me nervous to sing but what about you as an individual how do you fail in your daily living how do you tally up with god what god says for you to be a shining light that sets on a hill no one can pass that way around your way without knowing about jesus what type of life do you live one of those types of mean and souling and aggravating and different or can you speak of the peace and the love that you have found in christ she has made herself ready i was showing you the wickedness and the time would not would fail me to go through the ages and show that each time i can babble on the night of the rioting and dancing and drinking and so forth and what happened and down to the age has been that way in every age god's had thunderbolt prophets and signs and wonders to condemn the thing in the midst of all popularity and stand alone for god not only that but what if i would speak of the time of little stevens not a prophet not a pastor the member of the body of christ how that this little fellow stood before the sanhedrin council that morning and spoke out to those who were condemning him and said you stiff necks uncircumcised in the heart and ears you do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do you he wasn't a pastor you can't expect your pastor to do it all you can't expect your trusty board to do it all or your deacon bored you've got to make yourself ready it's an individual affair and remember his coming is so sudden that the church will go in the twinkling of an eye and if we see sin on every hand and judgment pending in the battleships of god's wrath coming how we escape this signs are appearing jesus is coming and great wonders are being done every mild post is pouring towards his soon appearing and it will happen in a moment how are we standing this morning as we take inventory if we should be spoke to this morning and the lord jesus should descend from the heavens this morning with the shout and the trump of god would we be found ready as a church body amen would we be found ready as an individual to join with those who are raised from the dead who have proven themselves ready no matter whether we are ready or not the lord jesus will come just the same at the appointed time we must be ready and we must do it now it is no time to wait we must redeem the time and be ready some time ago a story just before closing that struck me as i heard it many many years ago this secret coming of the lord secret going of the church watch there'll be two in the field i'll take one and leave one there'll be two in the bed i'll take one and leave one showing that the coming of the lord will not be just at any certain corner but it'll be universal one will be in the field working daytime the other in the bed sleeping on the other side of the world it'll be a universal rapture and it will come with the shout with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god shall sound in the dead christ shall rise and shall be caught away secretly oh i love that the great bridegroom coming into bride got herself ready waiting for that secret moment that she doesn't even know herself but she's ready and dressed and waiting for it we see signpost in the world that she's ready for judgment we see signs and wonders in the church great things taking place what kind of people should we be ready at the moment or we don't know when he's coming be also ready for you know not one minute or hour your lord does come be ready for you can't get ready then for he said you could not how many of you all perhaps have read of the virgins some were wise and some were foolish virgin means purity they were all good people every one of them virgin sanctified vessels of god but those who had oil in their lamps went in and the others was left out they were all virgins every one people that you couldn't put your finger on for anything wrong they everyone believed in the coming of the lord they were ready to go meet him but some of them let their oil go out don't let that be your case keep oil in your land oil is the spirit the holy spirit never let it drain from you when you feel your love dying away your sincerity to christ into the cause quickly go to him who has the fountain of oil and by for yourself a filling of the holy spirit our nation gone morally corrupted and ruined our politics corrupted and gone our leaders oh god what could we do about you put a good man in and he comes out of crook there's only one we can bring now that's the lord jesus amen let's make ready for his coming amen i want to tell you a little story that i heard some years ago in the close this sudden quick rapture of the church now you say certain things will take place then i'll make ready make ready now i've just related to you of pearl harbor and in many places where they refused to hear the warning they refused to listen to it nothing was left but divine judgment upon the people now all that will not go in christ will be under god's wrath and divine judgment please don't let that happen to you no matter what the brandon tabernacle ever turns out to be don't you let it be you you be a servant of christ no matter what the church world does you be a servant of christ it's not up to the branham tabernacle neither is it up to any other church it's up to you as an individual to be ready at the coming of the lord you must be ready i must be ready i sweep my own steps it's up to you to sweep your steps leave mine alone me leave yours alone you've got to make your garment ready that was a great rancher and he owned a mammoth big ranch way in the northern part of colorado near the mountain section as you all know i done a little ranching in my life of riding and so forth one of my calls to god was sitting on a stair of old texas wheel spurs with a rifle laying on the saddle and a pistol on my side when i heard down the trees boy sound like a boy said adam where are you when i looked up towards the stars and hearing old slim an old cowboy from over texas blowing through a comb with a piece of paper down at the cross where my savior died it was down there for cleansing from sin i cried there to my heart was his blood applied glory to his name i pull the blanket over my face and tried to hide myself cause god was looking down in those hills it's on one of those ranches where the great packing companies buy their cattle run them into the mountains and then bring them out at their calves they're born in the fall of the year and brandon and set off some of the old herd and the steers and so forth and go ahead into the accumulate their great uh herds of cattle and on this certain ranch the owner are the caretaker what we call there the top the foreman he had about five daughters they were all beautiful women young single and there was a little lady there which was a cousin to these girls that her father and mother had both deceased and she was brought over there to be uh to live with her her uncle and those girls they wasn't those fancy type of frilly fractional and and um and they just took this poor little girl and they just treated her like she was some animal all the hard work poured right on her she washed the dishes she cleaned up she fixed the bunk she she had to do it all and they just stayed around with polished fingernails and manicure the stuff on their lips and all fixed up you know just pressing and especially did they do this when they heard that from chicago the big packing company who owned the outfit his young single son was coming to visit the ranch how did they dike out in good clothes and did they dress and make ready for his coming and each night the conversation be they were going to ban this young man and marry him who would then they would own the ranch themselves for the sun would fall air to all so they made themselves ready so you see there is a ready to be you make yourself ready by joining church or something that ain't all that's required you got to have oil in your land amen just your dressing saying we'll build a big church we'll belong to a better denomination we'll we'll get on a pipe organ to the lord we'll make plush seats that is what god requires righteousness is what god requires in his son christ jesus that's the garments for the bible said the white clothes which he is adorned in is the righteousness of the saints amen so she these girls thought they would make themselves ready for the coming of this young man of course that poor little cousin that reminds me of an office cast somewhere you can appreciate her she was a beautiful woman but oh my she was a nice little girl but she was not even considered among them not as a relative now that's about the true picture of the real church today before the denominations not even considered a bunch of inner denominations a bunch of outcasts so the poor little fellow just went ahead working and when the young man arrived they didn't know it but he come looking for a wife he was sick and tired of the city girls who just stayed all dolled up and oh you know hung around the bar rooms and uh rolled around in the cadillacs and the the different things they they were just sick and tired of it he thought i'll go out west and haunt me a real girl that'll be a real mother to my babies and somebody who'll not hang at all the sewing circles and and the societies and things but it'll just be a real mother what did he find when he got there but the same thing that he had condemned in chicago i wonder if the lord jesus will find a church just a denomination just by name a church the world in the land not ready to go oh they got fined frocks you got the biggest churches the biggest this and all these things but god don't want that he wants you as an individual they may have the best pastors they may have the finest deacon boards but he wants you with all hell he's coming to catch that early ride away and as he this boy looked upon him he was disheartened and that night they were having something on the order in them days it's been a long ago they called the charleston which is just like a rock and roll and they were going to throw one of those big parties many you people remember that old charleston dance they did back when i was a kid when i was out there and so they were all had their little black and white clothes on you know to do the oh it was called charleston's and black bottom that's what they were calling and they had them two-tone clothes and they were going to do these dances and but this boy was sick of that stuff he was hunting for a real girl so he slipped out other party he's watching him he went in to look at him so is another son that i know of another son will come to your church your son of god he'll come there he'll look around he'll see your fine dress he'll he'll know that you're a good member but he's looking for something different from this irregular trend of church so as he looked around after all he's so discouraged he walked out the door and going back walking in the moonlight towards the bunk house he heard somebody kind of humming and he looked around and here went this little girl with a great big pad of dishwater way in the night barefooted to throw the dishwater out and as soon as he saw her something another said that's her that's the one so he put himself in a way and when she that's when she come back along the crowd fence well he was standing there and she almost fainted he said how do you do and he said what's your name and she told him her name and it was the same name of the boss of the ranch said then i can't understand how that this is that your father said no i'm just the cousin you see my father and he were brothers i've got the same name but i uh that's the voice you might have the name of church might have the name of bran tabernacle or methodist or whatever church you go that isn't it friend see it's something different it's your character that's what god's looking at you might be methodist you might be baptist you might be presbyterian it's not that it's character that god looks at not just earthly character but holy spirit character these signs shall follow them that believe said jesus in the 16th chapter of saint mark she was so gotten that that he would speak to her even and she held her little head down and she ran into the house he was there for a week or two and he looked all around everywhere and he never said no more but he kept watching her and the night before he left he used to leave the next morning that storm another big party and he watched for her he couldn't find her he knows she'd had to do the dishes and so forth so the dirty work and all could be thrown off that's the way the real church of god has to take it sometimes the dirty work all the scandal names of all of the things that need to be thrown at it she's a great speckled bird all the other birds gather around and flock at her that's all right her name's on the lamb's book of life she'll spread her great wings someday for a flight she's ready and speckles meant the blood of christ sprinkled on her you've read it in your book the bible and this boy caught the little lady that night coming out he said i've watched you no one knows it by myself he said i've come out here looking for a wife and all that i have ever seen you meet the requirement how did she feel the big man's son asking her now if she would be his wife just imagine how those girls must have felt when they looked out the window and saw holding hands with that little despised cousin the man if they tried to vape with all their big fine flocks and frills and carrying on and he said will you marry me oh she said sir i'm not worthy that's the way the real church feels about it i'm not worthy i can if i can just wash your dishes it'll be all right are you willing to take that place could you wash the dishes from the supper would you be willing to be called fanatic or would you be willing to be taken away with the lord's dispatch you are you willing are you willing at your work to be marked there's a man he's a religious fanatic because he won't drink he won't smoke he doesn't dance he doesn't run with women there's a woman that keeps her head down she walks like down to the town she's not she won't join our circles are you willing to take the way make yourself ready for the coming of the lord if you have if you do you'll be waiting for him to come you'll joy at his coming it won't be a dreadful thing it'll be the most gracious moment that you can think of the coming of the lord all those that love his appearing so when he left he told her he'd be back at a certain time so when you begin to see there's a winner so when you begin to see those trees begin to budge on earth that mesquite and stuff begin to take on new life said that i'll be back about spring time i understand i couldn't say it was true but the girl only got about a dollar and 75 cents a week for her labor but she saved every penny of it why she was getting ready for the wedding that was to be she was saving her money for her wedding gown or he said we'll be married right here at the ranch when i come again she saved her money all year she was happy she didn't mind washing the dishes she didn't mind ironing the clothes or sweeping out the bunk house i want more she was engaged to the boss of the ranch why do we care what the world says a real christian why do we care if we have to be just just despised and rejected blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth the boss's sons are coming one day and we're going to a wedding supper what difference does it make to us if you love his appearing after it was all the days passed the little daughters the little cousins made fun of her danced around her and done everything else but said you poor silly kid do you not know if he why he was just like all other man he was just teasing you but the son of god doesn't tease except a man be born again he will in no wise i don't care how good you look how much church you belong to what your status is in the country you might be a politician you might be in the federal government you might be in the catholic presbyterian any church you want to be but it's except the man be born again you'll not enter and these signs shall follow them that believe i'm only quoting his word finally when the hour come she began to see this the buds began to come on the trees she knew he'd be there at any time and he said i'll try to make it just it's sundown so he can be married and hurry off and every evening at sundown when she she'd go and get make herself all ready get her little wedding garment out and wait at the gate and these little cousins come and laugh at her and make fun of her and said you poor silly ignorant child now think that the the man who owns is a president or other of the company and his boy would marry a dishwasher he was looking for virtue not clothes he had enough money to buy all the clothes that's necessary god don't care how big your fancy things you have he owns everything in the world it's all he wants virtue he wants something that's real and so finally one evening while she would stand there and they were laughing and making fun of her and telling her she was silly all at once they heard some hoofs of prancing what happened across the hill come above board uh buck board's a little wagon open top very popular in the west and the horses all jingled and everything coming across the hill from this carriage and stopped in front of the gate and she run she said i knew you would come that's to be the church someday she threw herself in his arms and he said darling i have had a man stationed on this range since i let you last year has brought me a report of everything that you've done god's got a man stationed in this tabernacle this morning he's called the holy spirit he knows the secrets of your heart he knows everything that you've done or what you think he tells the father everything that you do he brings the message back and forth he said and he has told me that you waited and you worked and you've labored patiently waiting for me to come now you've been a slave for a long time but now your slave days are over i have brought along the minister right under this rose trellis you become my wife he kissed her but the wedding ring on her finger and picked her up and set her in the backboard with his arm around her and drove off to find this new big palace on outer drive in chicago the selected of the nation where she could live as his bride why she was ready she lived and been the kind of a woman that he wanted it happened just the despair of a moment and that sudden secret coming of the lord the world don't know what's going to happen but we do it's at hand don't be like the young lady that stripped the clothes from in pearl harbor you'll go down in disgrace be like the one who made yourself ready and kept her virtues and was waiting for the coming of the lord because it'll be secret and sudden while you think of those things let's bow our heads to him who will come hallelujah amen isn't that wonderful this morning and it's not looking for how well you could do and what you have and what you don't have he's able to supply all that we have need of this morning he's looking for character let's all stand this morning
