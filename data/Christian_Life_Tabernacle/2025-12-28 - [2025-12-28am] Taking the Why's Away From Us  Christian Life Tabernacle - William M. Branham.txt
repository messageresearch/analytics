Description:
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
December 28th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[music] Let all [music] we come to worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] I trust we're all happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning. You may turn around and welcome somebody. We'll have brother Orlando come [music] and open our service in a word of prayer. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads. Father, we come to you this morning, Lord God, on one accord, I believe. Father, you said in your word, Lord God, where two or three are gathered in your name, there is in the midst, Father. [music] So by that, Lord God, we welcome you, Lord God. We commit this service to you, Lord, for all the things that we've been through, Lord God, from from from that time up until this time, Lord God. [music] We have an expectancy, Lord, today to receive more of you, Lord God, that we may decrease, that you may increase [music] in our lives, Father. Let everything that be done here today, Lord God, be done in decency and in order, Lord God. Not to lift up man, Lord God, and an idea, Lord, but your word, Lord God. For you said in your word, if you be lifted up, that you'll draw all men unto thee, Lord God. So, Father, that together, Lord, we lift up your name, Lord God. For your name is above every name, that at your name every knee shall bow [music] and every tongue shall confess. We confess it before you today, Lord God, with an expectation in in our hearts, Lord God, that you'll bring it to pass. We love you today and we thank you once again. In the [music] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Hallelujah. As as you're standing, we'll just turn to a [music] psalm reading. We'll read out of Psalm 30. We'll read it together from the 1st all the way to the 12th. &gt;&gt; I will extol thee, oh Lord, for thou has lifted me up and has not made my foes to rejoice over me. Oh Lord my God, I cried unto thee and thou has brought me healed me. Oh Lord, thou has brought me up my soul from the grave. Thou hast kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit. Sing unto the Lord, oh ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. For his anger endureth but a moment, and his favor is life. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning, and in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. Lord, by thy favor thou has made me my mountains to stand strong. Thou didest hide thy face, and I was troubled. I cried to thee, O Lord, and unto the Lord I made supplication. What profit is there in my blood? When I go down to the pit, shall the dust praise thee? Shall it declare thy truth? Here, O Lord, and have mercy upon me. Lord, be thou my helper. Thou hast turned me my mourning into dancing. Thou has put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent. Oh Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever. Amen. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. [clears throat] Let's just sing that song. I shall not be I shall not be moved. I think it's an F.

Truly, you are a wonderful father, Lord. And we ask that today [music] that through your word we might become better children and better [music] servants of your great name. We ask you to bless the people this morning. May their hearts be lifted up. Father, [music] as we leave this mark in time, the year [music] 20 25, Father, we're going to leave that behind and go into a new year. But, Father, may our hearts and our zeal be new for you. We ask for your blessings [music] now. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. You may be seated this morning. We're going to have a baby dedication this morning. And also, we'd like to uh uh welcome our [snorts] our guest uh today, Brother Francois and Susan Lupricar. Their daughter and granddaughter are here. So, brother, where you at? Stand up for us so we can all don't There they are. They're from the They're from the great country of Switzerland and that is a absolutely gorgeous place. And everybody likes Switzerland. They're known for their chocolate and watches and their believers. And then we have Eli and Kendall with us today. And so we're we're just grateful for everybody. Did you all have a good Christmas? &gt;&gt; Are y'all wearing your new Christmas clothes? I'm wearing my Christmas tie today. I got a tie for Christmas and I I'm I'm grateful for that. And uh I asked some of the brothers if they got the sports car they wanted and nobody got the sports car they wanted. But but we got a better gift, didn't we? We got the son of our Lord. And and and that's that's what's the most marvelous part about it. and and uh just it's the love of God. God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and then along with that came eternal life and every benefit for everything we need he's here for us. So uh we're just grateful for that. We're going to dedicate this morning uh uh brother Eli and Adriel's daughter Hannah Ka. And if they're here, if you would come up and and you know, I I like I like Hannah in the Bible. [music] &gt;&gt; She It's just such a great story. [snorts] If you ever want to be inspired, [music] read the second chapter of First Samuel. That's Hannah's prayer to the Lord. And she's talking about how great God is. And Hannah's name [music] means uh it means grace or favor. And uh so it's really wonderful uh to be named after [music] such a wonderful Bible character. Amen. Thank you. Hold her up. So, I'm let &gt;&gt; pray. Father God, we are grateful for this gift of life you have given us. It is written the brought to you little children and you bless them. This morning we come before you to dedicate Hannah. We ask you to protect her from the things of the world. May you be a portion. May you help her walk according to your word throughout her journey on this earth. May you protect her from sicknesses and grant her eternal life. We grant we we hold this baby this morning by your grace, a grace we do not deserve. Please help us to raise according to your word. As it is written, teach your children the way they should go. When they are old, they will not turn from it. Father, we thank you for this privilege this morning and ask all this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our gracious father, what a marvelous namesake that Hannah's named after. Father, a prayer warrior, one that poured out her heart before the Lord with faith. And Lord, when she received what she had prayed for, she dedicated Samuel back to the service of the Lord. Father, it's a marvelous story of faith and dedication and perseverance and sacrifice. Father, may all the characteristics of the great namesake be placed in her. Father, may she be a shining light. Father, may her life produce fruit in life. We ask you to bless the parents, Father, as they raise her, Father. May they always keep you before her. May they always teach her the word of God. We ask your blessings on them now as they journey in life. and we ask you to keep her and encamp your angels about him. We ask it in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Isn't it the Lord wonderful? Amen. How wonderful he is. I've taken a couple days off. So I' I've asked Matthew to preach for us this morning. Uh uh Billy's away in uh preaching. Brother Paul's going to be uh he's going to be going to uh out to uh Brazerville. And so we want you to pray for him. He leaves in this in January. So there's a lot of things uh going on, you know, but the world's changing rapidly. The worst part about it is it's moving farther away from the word of God and it's getting harder and harder to stay just with the truth just the way it's spoken. And you know the one thing that Satan does, he always tries to discredit the word of God that it won't work. But the word of God works. It'll never fail. it it it's it's forever ever true. Uh it endureth forever and God keeps his word. &gt;&gt; So, you know, we always talk about leaving one year and going into a new year and it's good to to steadfast in your heart to uh serve God. Uh we also have other people that are in town for the wedding. We want to greet all our visitors and everybody this morning. Keep us in prayer. I'm looking forward for the Lord to do wonderful things in the days ahead. I I believe the supernatural is our portion. It's our life and that God can do for us exceedingly and abundantly above what we can even ask or think. So hold that faith there. Let's let's this year forward. Let's go. Faith is the key to the door and we really want that to be. So, brother Matthew, if you'd come at this time and musicians, thank you very much. Just ask Matthew to break the word of the Lord for us this morning. I appreciate his help today. God richly bless you. Amen. Why don't we all just It was a tiny simple stable. All beaten [singing] and [music] warm. Hardly a place [music and singing] for a king to be born. He didn't choose some place [music] special to reveal his majesty. So I know if I'll [music] give him control, he'll be [singing] born in me. Let your [music] word be born in the manger [singing] of my heart. [music] Let it live in me. [singing] Let it star [music] live inside this house of play. and [music] mold it every day. [singing] Let your word be born in the [music and singing] manger of my heart. Next verse. will outwardly [music] I'm nothing but much to behold my heart [music] for his word to unfold if [music] I'll just yield [singing] this vessel and let him have his way [singing] from glory on [music] to glory he'll change me day &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; I hear [music] you for [singing] in the [music] manger of my heart. May [singing] be [music] let [singing] this house [music] away and hold it every day. that [music] you were born in the [singing] manger of my heart. Lord Jesus, we're just thankful that [music] we can be gathered together into your presence. And Lord, to be with brothers and sisters of precious like faith [music] and to have visitors with us, Lord, we just want you to be their portion. Lord, as we're still in what the world would call holiday seasons, Lord, we know a prophet told us that every [music] day is Christmas, Lord, and we want your word to be born into our heart, and to our lives, and into manifestation, Lord, into the things that we do, and [music] that we say, that we could give you honor and glory, Lord, that men might see our good works and they might glorify you, Lord. That it's not something that man can do, but it's the very word taking on flesh in your many [music] membered bride body. Lord, we love you. We just thank you, Lord. I'm incapable in myself to be able [music] to take your word and to uh divide it to your people. But if you would come, Lord, and you just [music] take the bread of life and rightly divide it as the sheep have need of it, Lord, I know it'll be a blessing and encourage them along the way. [music] Lord, whether it's chastisement, rebuke, correction, encouragement, deliverance, [music] Lord, we've come to the house of God that you would have your preeminence now. Lord, we just welcome you here just to have your perfect will and way in the service. We surrender [music] to you now. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. [music] Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, we'll be reading out of Luke chapter 2. Amen. It's it's just good to see uh the visitors here with us and we've come to know and love and uh also, Brother Eli and Sister Kendall, it's good to have you with us. Just dear friends of ours and uh many in for the wedding. So, we're just uh in in great expectation for what the Lord would have for us this morning and uh just see what the Lord will do. Luke chapter 2 and we'll be reading verses 8 through 18. I I almost uh want to read the whole chapter. Um you know how the word is. Uh but it says, "And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid." And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." Ain't that wonderful? And this shall be a sign unto you. Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace and good will to men." And it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into the heaven, the shepherds said one to another, "Let us go now even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us." Isn't that wonderful? And when and they came with haste, I like that also. And found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, now watch this. When they had seen what was spoken in manifestation, when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child, and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. Amen. We ask a blessing on the word. You may be seated. Amen. Just still in maybe what we would call a holiday season. and with our our pastor ministering on Christmas, we're just in maybe that uh line of thought and that channel. And brother Brandham would say and why it had to be shepherds, which would be uh the source of my inspiration. He says, now I it's he says why this great event was revealed to shepherds. That would be kind of an outstanding thing for us. I have some scriptures written here and a few notes that I will try to run over to explain to you why to the best of my knowledge and maybe then after this that the Lord with his grace tonight will take the wise away from us. But mo most all of us I suppose at one time or another has wondered why that the greatest event of all times was revealed to shepherds. Why was it revealed to shepherds and not to the theologians of that day? They were the one that were trained to hear it. And why did it come to pass? Why did it come and bypass the rich and come to the poor also? Why did it bypass the learned and wise and come to the humble and unlearned? There's a few questions of why in this. And I want to pull from my inspiration where brother Brandham says, "And maybe then after this, the Lord with his grace tonight will take the wise away from us." I I want to minister to you on the thought of take the wise away from us. Not W, but Wy WHs, taking the question, if you will, or taking the Y away from us. And you know, I hope everybody had a good Christmas. You know, may maybe maybe some of you had a hard Christmas, but you know, you got some gifts, some you like and some you love and some that don't fit and some you don't know why. Like, why why did they get me this got me a spatula? I ain't planning on cooking. You know, sometimes that's the way it is with with Christmas and gifts and a and you know, you you people go they make an effort and and they they buy you something and sometimes you might you might might wonder why why did they get me this or or or or or even what is this thing? But I just wanted to point out one thing that is important is you want to appreciate the gift. You know, because people take time and they take effort and it's and it's a sacrifice and there's a cost and there's a thoughtfulness. And that word appreciate means to grasp the nature, the worth or the quality or the significance of. And and I want to just say the greatest gift that was ever given was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And and and it's not that uh Christmas isn't about Santa Claus and all the tinsel and and all the bright lights and the commercial things that they've made it today. Uh because we know that a prophet has shown us, but that's pagan. that's that's ha and and he said you ought not to teach your kids those things because you know you teach them that you're going to have to correct it and you're going to and and if you have to correct them say well it was all a lie you know there's no thing such thing as Santa Claus he said you better watch out because they might think the same thing about Jesus Christ you see we got to be very careful the things that we teach and the things that we we pour ourselves into and the time and attention we give it and the credibility &gt;&gt; with the songs we sing and and sometimes we think they're innocent and sometimes we think they're nice and it's the holiday season, but here a prophet says it's pagan. &gt;&gt; Well, come on. I'm preaching to believers. &gt;&gt; And we know what a prophet taught. &gt;&gt; You know, we we know what the season's about. You know, every day is Christmas to the believers. So, some people take it off into legalism and they can't even uh uh slow down. And I'll tell you what, if the world's going to slow down and take a week or two off uh that we can have time with family and and and express our love to one another and take a little moment a a and reflect on the greatest gift that ever was given. Hey, I'll take that because I got a revelation. I know every day is Christmas, so you might want to criticize and tell me, "Well, you're giving presents and you're doing this." Well, yeah. Yeah, that's okay. I'm just glad the world's going to slow down for a little bit that I can take a little time, but every day is Christmas to me. So, so, so you want to criticize and be legalistic about it. Well, well, I want to tell you, if you've ever received the greatest gift that was ever given, that gift is so powerful. It's not limited to a holiday. It's not limited to a weekend. It's not limited to a Sunday. It's not limit limited to a Wednesday, but the greatest gift that ever was given was the Lord Jesus Christ. And I say, "Oh Lord, let your word be born in my heart and in my life." &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would say this and why it had to be shepherds. He said, "The name of Jesus Christ spoke life into a dead baby. What ought it do to a church that claims to be born again?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, we we know the story about how how the angel came unto uh uh Mary and and and and said, uh uh behold, thou hast found favor with the Lord and and you're going to be with child. And how how can these things be? He says, "Oh, the the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you." And that thing that will be conceived in you. Oh, it's Emmanuel. It's Jesus Christ. That's what his name shall be called. And and she went over there and and testified to Elizabeth who had been with child for six months with the with the prophet John, right? Y'all know the story. And and what happened at the mention of the name? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He says, "The name of Jesus spoke life into a dead baby. What ought it do to a church that claims to be born again? And we sit as sour as the bumps on a pickle and let such things go on and afraid to raise and testify your convictions and condemn all this nonsense. Make Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. It's Christmas time. Get out these Santa Clauses and stuff and away with that nonsense of commercializing wherever you heard about Santa Claus in the Bible. It's a Roman mythology. There's nothing at all. There's no such thing. Don't teach your children such nonsense as that when one day you'll have to tell them that it was all a blind story. Then you've lied to your child and it'll hurt your testimony about Jesus Christ. You'll say, "Well, maybe it's the same thing. Put Jesus Christ uh he said, "Put Jesus Christ, the great shepherd prophet, back into the Christmas where it belongs." &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. We ought to give the word and give God the preeminence and and put Christ, the great prophet shepherd back where it belongs into the first place in our life. It ought to be the very thing that we're living for, the very thing that we're thinking about. We ought to wake with aspirations of pleasing him. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; We that that's oh yeah, it's a holiday season. It's Christmas time. But every day ought to be Christmas. We ought to be living for the Lord. We ought to be living for Jesus. We ought to be thinking, "What can I do for him? Lord, lead me. Lord, guide me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother David, he read that quote about uh uh uh uh you know how how that that the old um uh what what do they call it? Were they wearing uh I'm trying to remember what the what they call those people the way they dressed uh uh back then in the 50s and 60s. But he said, you know, they they they wear leotard legotards and leotards and all these things and and these baggy clothes and and you know, they just sit around and they just uh just do anything that they they want to do and they just they let their minds travel and and you know, they just lay around and be lazy or they if they want to do something, they do it. If they don't want to do do it, they they don't do it. And brother Brandham said in that message, he he he said, "You have no right to do that because you're not your own. You are bought by deity." Jesus Christ, the son of God that was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm reading a prophet. Feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel okay to to to to say amen to the word of God. You are bought by deity. &gt;&gt; You are you are bought with a price. Jesus Christ laid down his life for you. As the pope would say, I am redeemed. Bought with a price. Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody asked you just who I am, tell him I am redeemed. Oh, you are bought by deity. just to think the very price that paid for your ransom, the very price to set you free and deliver you from your sins. You were bought by deity. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "We ain't got no right just to lay around loosey goosey and do whatever we want to do and dress any kind of way we want to dress and act any kind of way we want to act. You are bought with a price. You are not your own. You are bought by the blood of deity. Jesus Christ made flesh and come on this earth to hang on a tree that you might live. Talk about a Christmas message. Talk about a great gift that you who were once in bound and in sin with no hope and no way of escape. You were in bound to drugs and alcohol and addictions. Oh, but God sent the greatest gift that man has ever known. The man named Jesus Christ. And he wasn't only born in a manger, but he was hung on a tree on Calvary to pay the price for your sin &gt;&gt; that you might be delivered. &gt;&gt; You were bought by deity. &gt;&gt; Well, it shows the worth. &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. I can't understand it. But when you go to buy a gift, what do you do? You make an exchange. And you got to deem the thing that you're purchasing worth the value that it's asking. &gt;&gt; Come on. You can buy a house and it'll go down in value. You can buy a car and it'll go down in value. You You can buy it clothes and it's going to wear out. But when Jesus Christ paid for you, you were bought with deity. It doesn't lose its value. It doesn't lose its worth. You are bought by the blood of Jesus Christ. You want to know how valuable you are this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You were bought by deity. &gt;&gt; You want to know how much you're worth? &gt;&gt; The great creator of heavens and earth &gt;&gt; thought so much of you. [applause] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will take their place. I will become a man. I will become a kinsman redeemer and I will lay down my life. I will purchase the whole field that I might buy that treasure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are that pearl of great price. &gt;&gt; You were bought with deity. Don't let no devil try to tell you you don't matter. &gt;&gt; Try to tell you you don't you're not worth anything and and nobody notices you in church and and you come to church and nobody shakes your hand and nobody invited you over for Christmas and you had Thanksgiving all alone. I don't care if you have every Christmas alone, every Thanksgiving alone, every birthday alone. You were bought by the blood of Jesus Christ. You are not alone. He said, "I'll be with you, even in you until the end. Let the world mock you. Let the world scorn. Let everybody go this way and that way. But one thing I am sure of. I have been bought by deity." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is hot up here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bought by deity. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you though, that's how much God thought about you. &gt;&gt; How much do you think about him? &gt;&gt; He laid down his life for you. &gt;&gt; How much do you think of him? For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him might have should not perish but have eternal life. John 15:13 says, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you." Uhoh. &gt;&gt; How much do you think of this price? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching Bible. I'm preaching the message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If ye are my friends, if you do whatsoever I command you, henceforth I call you not servants. For the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth, but I have called you friends. For all things that I have heard of my father, I have made known unto you. I just love it. I I can't help it. But when it comes on and you're listening to the prophet and he says, "Friends, oh, it has a certain ring to me." When he starts to break the seals, he says, "I no longer church call you church. I call you bride." Why? It wasn't revealed to the theologians and the denominations of the world, but this truth has been revealed to the lonely, the meek, and the humble. &gt;&gt; I say, "What a gift." &gt;&gt; The gift of eternal life, the gift of faith, &gt;&gt; the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a gift. Brother Brandham said continuing in that message says the highest of heaven came down to make himself known to the lowest of the earth bypassing all between to make himself known to common herdsmen coming to give these common herdsmen the greatest message of all times. There had been many great messengers. We would think of Noah in his day and the prophets and the great priests and so forth had been had been in the days gone by the great learned man, kings, potentates, monarchs. But here he comes with the greatest of all the messages. &gt;&gt; What was the message? &gt;&gt; Messiah is here now. &gt;&gt; I say what is the message? Messiah is here now. While the church world is looking for event, some event to take place in the future, God has come and revealed himself to his bride. And what is the message of the hour? He is not dead, but he is alive. He is not just coming sometime in the future, but [screaming] Christ, the word has come and he is right here present amongst us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I wonder what kind of appreciation should we have. &gt;&gt; To think that all the patriarchs and all the apostles and the disciples and all those through the church ages look towards this hour that we are now living when the word has become flesh and the flesh is becoming word and a member bride body. [screaming] Christ is here now. Oh, you can look at me like a mule at a new new gate. But that's the message of the hour to declare that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I'm not looking into the past of what he only did. And I'm not just looking into the future, but I can recognize this present present tense among us right now. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may we have the right appreciation. grasp the nature, the worth, the significance of Calvary. But you know, imagine this this great message. Who was it revealed to? Bunch of shepherds. &gt;&gt; Shepherds, nobody thought of the shepherds. &gt;&gt; The shepherds, they were unlearned. &gt;&gt; You know, you go out and see those shepherds, you know, they they sleep with the sheep. They they walk the hills with them. And you want to know who their friends and their companions are? &gt;&gt; Sheep. &gt;&gt; They'll walk miles and they'll roam the field and they'll lead their sheep into pastures. &gt;&gt; All alone walking alone. That's what a pastor does. Many times he stands alone. And everybody wonders why is he doing the things he's doing? Why is he going this way? Because he stands alone with God leading his sheep into greener pastures. All right. &gt;&gt; They start to laugh like the sheep and &gt;&gt; you know they smell like the sheep and &gt;&gt; they start to, you know, they don't really, if I can almost say it, they dress like the sheep. They need to stay warm and they're going to hang out with them and and here the greatest message that was ever declared [snorts] was revealed to shepherds. Well, why? Well, he wouldn't come and not to the great big organizations and to the great big churches and and to everybody that had it figured out and and the big uh uh you know, they they had the synagogues and all these things and and they were trained right and and they had an ear to hear and and they were studying all all the all the all the the the the Old Testament and the law of Moses and everything in there. And if anybody would have been trained and anybody should have saw it, but brother Bannon points out that their teaching had them leaning the wrong way because of their organization and because of of their learning. They would very they would miss the very message of the hour. Christ born into a manger. Why? It had to be shepherds. You know, a shepherd wouldn't he wouldn't worry about going into that stinky manger. Come on. &gt;&gt; And I say that's one thing about God's children. They they they don't mind going where the word is. &gt;&gt; I don't need some orchestra. I don't need some polished choir. I don't need some big church. I don't need some big programs. I don't need somebody to babysit my child. What I need is in the word. And if it's in a manger, let me go into a manger. If it's down on the street corner, let me go to the street corner. But I want to tell you, I want to be where the word is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why did it have to be shepherds? Brother Brandham shows how he never revealed it to the educated or the religious people of the day. He says in paragraph 76, he says you they would say you've you've been bewitched by some evil spirit that caused you to say such. You wonder why you get the looks that you get when you tell tell the people that God sent a prophet &gt;&gt; and that Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10 1-7 has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; That's right. Somebody's bewitched you &gt;&gt; and I wonder if we've become afraid to share it &gt;&gt; with the greatest message that has ever hit the planet and God has revealed it to you and we're afraid. &gt;&gt; These shepherds, what did they do? They went declaring to all Christ is here. Dirty, stinking, illiterate shepherds. They weren't worried about their reputation. They didn't have no reputation. They weren't worried about what man thought of them because they were out there with their sheep. But one thing they knew, it had been declared to them that the Messiah is here. I say if you appreciate and have caught a revelation of the message of the hour, there ought to be something in your life declaring Christ the Messiah is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've been bewitched by some evil spirit that caused you to say such. &gt;&gt; Yet it was according to the word of God. And they were too blind to see it because their theology had blinded them. What a tragedy. Caught in such a place in such a mess as that. What? Caught. Here's how he's saying. Caught in such a place and such a mess as that. This was in a stable. You mean in Jeffersonville? Can any good thing come out of Jeffersonville? &gt;&gt; Out of a muddy swamp? &gt;&gt; Out of a no education. &gt;&gt; Not even seventh grade. Barely illegitimate. Come from a family of moonshiners. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; H what a [screaming] tragedy. &gt;&gt; Caught in such a place and such a mess as this in a stable when they had a beautiful place for him to come. They had everything fixed up for him to come. And to think that he would come down and go and not bring their teachers the message &gt;&gt; and would give it to a bunch of unlearned shepherds &gt;&gt; and then bring his own son and have him born in a stable. &gt;&gt; A common livery stable. Well, in a manger of hay. Why? It couldn't be so. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't believe it because it was so humble. &gt;&gt; You know, many times a gift can be unrecognized. &gt;&gt; Underappreciated, &gt;&gt; devalued, even unused, which I need to repent to my brother David. He bought me a very very nice uh h cooking kit to to to cook these steaks to perfection. And I haven't used it. But you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go home and use it &gt;&gt; cuz I want to appreciate and I do appreciate that gift. I haven't gotten around to do it. But you know what? Hey, maybe under a little conviction. I should have showed my appreciation. I I should have already broke that thing out and I should already cooked him and his wife some steaks and brought them over. So, David, I really appreciate that that you got for me. And how long has it been? He got that for me a year or two ago. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I'm preaching on myself a little bit. They they say that that billions go unused in in gift cards. &gt;&gt; Billions go unused in gift cards because what happens is is somehow we lose the value. There's not the appreciation. Maybe you don't understand what it can do. &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't understand the purchasing power. Maybe you thought it was just $25, but they but they really put $2500 on there and they're waiting for you to go to the store and buy your little $25. And they said, "Here's your receipt. You you you you still have $2,425 left." And you'd be like, "Whoa, if I would have known that, I would have went to the store a lot sooner." What about the message of the hour? Do we even understand the benefits? Do we even understand the value? Do we even understand the purchasing power of the message of the hour? It'll give you your family. It'll give you your children. It'll give you [screaming] your health. It'll give you salvation. It'll give you deliverance. It'll give you your heart's desire. &gt;&gt; Why? Because [screaming] it's Christ. Christ is here. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; He said it's so simple. That's how the wise always overlooks it. It's so simple. It confounds them. &gt;&gt; They look for God way out there when he's right here. &gt;&gt; See, they're looking for something way yonder &gt;&gt; when it's right here with them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; Christ risen from the dead. &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever. I want to tell you, he is not dead. He is alive. He is right here present with us this morning. He is not way out there somewhere yonder. He's not somewhere out there in the future. But Christ, the word [screaming] is present right here, right now. This morning, I say, why don't you open up your heart and receive them? Why don't we start showing the appreciation and the love and the worship and the thanksgiving? &gt;&gt; You know, when my kids get something they like, you know what they do? They shout, &gt;&gt; they scream, &gt;&gt; they say, "Thank you. I always wanted this." I say, when the greatest gift that was ever given unto man is being read out and delivered to the church, there ought to be something in your heart saying, "Amen. Thank you. Glory to God. That's me. That's mine." [screaming] &gt;&gt; But it's one thing to say you thank you and you got it. It's another thing to use it. and to put it to use. &gt;&gt; A lot of people say they believe the message, &gt;&gt; but it's not an action. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. You still wearing those same old clothes. &gt;&gt; I got a brand new suit. I got a brand new car. Glory to God. God sent a prophet. Well, why are you still wearing the same things? &gt;&gt; Why are you still driving the same car? Why you still dancing like the world? Why you still wearing makeup? Why you still cutting your hair? &gt;&gt; I wonder if it's because we don't value. We don't have an appreciation. We really don't know what we got. But what we need is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Christ is here. &gt;&gt; John 15:16. You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you &gt;&gt; and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. &gt;&gt; These things I command you that you love one another. &gt;&gt; Oh, how we should value &gt;&gt; one another. &gt;&gt; Look on the needs of one another. It's amazing how we give attention to those things that in our own carnal thinking we deem valuable. Like this is, you know, this is, you know, I'm going to keep preaching on myself. My mom got me a little travel tie thing and I I was like, you know, maybe I could use this. And I found out how much it cost. I said, I'm going to use this. I realized the thoughtfulness and the time and the sacrifice and what the cost was and how thoughtful it was and I I looked at it again like you know what and it made me press a little harder. I was like absolutely and I realized it it was a very meaningful and a gift that I could very use. But you know what's amazing what we give value to &gt;&gt; we got a house full of people who were bought by deity &gt;&gt; and we give our time and attention to the things of the world. You've spent more time on Instagram and Snapchat than you have with the house of God. &gt;&gt; Well, these things I command that you love Instagram, that you love Facebook, that you love the Cowboys. &gt;&gt; I don't know who would do that. &gt;&gt; Are you following? Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the things you love are the things that you give your time and attention. You know, time is purchasing power. &gt;&gt; What are you purchasing with your time and your attention? &gt;&gt; You purchasing h [screaming] I did it. I conquered the game. &gt;&gt; I beat a bunch of unknown people out in the universe that I'll never meet. I'm a hero. Mom, Dad, guess what? I'm number one on Minecraft. Minecraft that you're talking about that old Atari game where you hit like you tried to avoid the bombs. Remember it show the little numbers? Oh, number four. That means there's four minds around this one. I I I was at I was at a restaurant one day and this guy was driving a Lamborghini and so I got to talking to him a little bit and he and he said uh and he said uh he goes, "Yeah, man. No, no. I I got this many followers on my channel. I got millions of followers. I'm ranked this, this, and this. And he goes, "Yeah, I make millions on my my channel." He goes, "On Minecraft?" I went, "You make millions playing that little Atari game?" He's like, "No, that's mind sweep. I'm talking about mine. I didn't know what he was talking about, but to think the people pour out their time and their value to hitting some little dup. &gt;&gt; One hour, two hour. Doop, doop, doop, doop, doop. &gt;&gt; I'm tired. Um, &gt;&gt; and Jesus himself began. Lord, it's been a good day. &gt;&gt; Where's your value? &gt;&gt; Where's your appreciation? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What about those of the household of faith? Galatians 6:10, "As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men." Does anybody know what the rest is? Especially, &gt;&gt; unto them who are of the household of faith, &gt;&gt; but it makes me think there's a coming a day where Jesus is going to stand there. They're say, "Where did you get your scars?" in the house of my friends. And I think many of us are wounded, many of us are beaten, many of us are crying, many of us are hurt. Where where where have you been hurt the most? In the house of my friends. When we when we let politics and we we we let we let opinions and we let favoritism and we let oh this should be done that way and that should be done that way and we develop grudges and insecurities and complexes and we start to get divided and when somebody wants to step up and do something they think it's all selfish motive and they're just trying to promote themselves. I want to tell you that's the devil. &gt;&gt; Come on, help me preach this morning. We're supposed to be a household of faith that loves one another and especially unto them who are in the household of faith. &gt;&gt; What does Paul say in 1 Corinthians 12? I'm talking about being bought by deity, right? He says, "And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable &gt;&gt; upon these we bestow more abundant honor." So just remember the next time you think I can't even that so and so I mean my goodness gracious I can't even stand. They are just a, you know, every time they do it, there's just this and that. I can't stand to be, you know, they're just, I'm telling you what, they're my least favorite person. There's your calling card. &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to buy them a gift. &gt;&gt; Oh, I did it not say bestow unto them more abundant honor. &gt;&gt; But we got our clicks, we got our crew, we got our friends, &gt;&gt; and we we go out of our way to exclude people. We we make we make excuses &gt;&gt; to cut people out. &gt;&gt; We we we we were real we're real careful on how we organize an event because we don't want certain people to know. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I'm right where I need to be this morning. I told you the time uh one time where a brother coming uh flew into town and he said he said, "Oh, brother Matthew, I just got into the airport and I'm on a layover a little bit and I was wondering if you had some time for fellowship." And I was really busy. I didn't have any time. And I I said, "Well, brother, I I can see what I can do. I got a lot lot going on right now." And I I said, "Uh I I I'll let I'll let you know." I hung up the phone and that still small voice said, "If it was Brother Tom Ray, you would have dropped everything you were doing and ran and picked him up." I went, "Oh, &gt;&gt; ouch. Oh, &gt;&gt; because what was I doing carnally? I was putting value on what I cherish as a friendship." But God is calling us to a higher calling. He's calling us to the capstone of love that looks beyond our wants and our desires and our little circles and looks on the knees of one another. Says, you know what? We ought to include so and so. They may be having a hard time. They don't have any friends. Let's let's pull somebody in because I want to tell you, if we don't pull them in, somebody else will. There's a whole world of wolves [screaming] waiting to devour our young people and our children and our young married couples. I say let's get the Holy Ghost back in the church and in the congregation and start showing one another love. &gt;&gt; That is right. &gt;&gt; We bestow more abundant honor and our uncumbly parts have more abundant comeliness. For our comely parts have no need. But God hath tempered the body together, hath given more abundant honor to the part which lacked. &gt;&gt; So whoever here you thought you were the least We bestow the most abundant honor upon you. &gt;&gt; And whoever you think deserves the most abundant honor, well, those who exalt themselves shall be abased. &gt;&gt; And those who humble themselves shall be exalted. &gt;&gt; That there should be no schisms. Why? That there should be no schisms in the body. What is the schism? Yell it out. &gt;&gt; Division. &gt;&gt; Division. That there shouldn't be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for only your inner circle. For only those that make you feel nice, warm, and fuzzy. For only those that get your jokes. For only those who liked you on Instagram. for only those who gave a thumbs up to your favorite store. No, having the same care one for another. &gt;&gt; Look, friends, it's going home time. &gt;&gt; This is capstone hour. &gt;&gt; This is rapture hour. And and I want to say there's a striking drift from the very core values and character in life of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You know, we would start to question speaking about this message by the help of God. Take the wise away from us. Why does so and so do that? Why do they act that way? Their kids are always like, I I wonder why. What's going on at the house? You know, maybe it's in the church. Why does brother David do the things that he do? Why do the deacons always do that? Well, I want to ask you, why don't you do what the deacons ask you to do? &gt;&gt; It's striking to me that the deacons put, I'm going to let it go. We should we should we should uh uh my goodness, we should have a love of God in our heart and we should be humble and obedient. And you know, if a brother asks you something, my Bible tells me if they asked for your for your coat to give them your cloak also, we can't even honor you if they asked you to sit down somewhere. &gt;&gt; I have you to know I pay more tithe than you. &gt;&gt; Well, what are we doing, church? [crying] &gt;&gt; We maybe all these questions. The question is, why are you acting the way you're acting? &gt;&gt; I say, oh God, take the wise away from us and give us the love of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; May the gift of God be shed abroad in our hearts. May &gt;&gt; may it replace the wise with compassion and love, &gt;&gt; understanding and forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me okay this morning? &gt;&gt; Because we have a lot of questions sometime. Why did so and so do that and why this and why that? Why don't we have some love and compassion? And why don't we go into prayer? Why don't we seek the Lord and seek what God is trying to do and how he's trying to mold our character and maybe allowing situations and things to come in as an opportunity for you to be Christ to somebody. That's what I always say when a when a problem pumps comes up and there's some situation and and this person's mad at this person and and Joey shoved Sue and Susie and Susie uh talked back to to to the deacon and and all this stuff and you know what it ends up doing? You know, not only do the kids get hurt, but the kids are going to move on. And you know, they're going to be a different age in one year. They're going to go from being a little girl to driving a car. And all that little stuff in the parking lot's going to be all over with. But you want to know the people who are still stewing over it? &gt;&gt; The parents, &gt;&gt; broken fellowship, not inviting people over anymore, shunning them and scaring them, not even not even having the love of God enough to look them in the eyes &gt;&gt; and shake their hand and say, "Sister, I love you." &gt;&gt; Brothers, be able to Somebody's offended you, you go the other way. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, some of us need to repent &gt;&gt; because we claim we got the love of God in our life. And and sure we do, but there's some areas in our heart and there's some avenues. I say there's a door in your heart and we need the Holy Ghost to come walk through those doors and in all those rooms and to those areas that you shut off from the Holy Ghost. And we need a real repentance, a real shaking, and getting back to the love of God. Well, come on, church. Let's have church this morning. Don't sit on me. It's time to go in a rapture. &gt;&gt; First Peter 4:8 says, "And above all things, have fervent charity among yourselves, &gt;&gt; for charity shall cover the multitude of sin. Use hospitality one to another without grudging. Oh, I tell you what, the Holy Ghost knows how to talk. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll go shake their hand. I'll go make it right. The Bible says if you have a lot in your heart, I I'll go make, you know, if I got to invite them over, if I got to do this, &gt;&gt; No, he's not asking for legalism. &gt;&gt; He's asking for love. For God so loved the world, a dirty, rotten, stinky, &gt;&gt; sinful, no righteousness, but God so loved the world. &gt;&gt; And if that love be in us, ought not we love one another, and above all, have fervent charity among yourselves. Okay, moving on. speaking on this thought around the Christmas season. You know, a gift, you know, you want it to be useful. It solves a problem. It helps with a task. It doesn't do any good if you don't use it. Cuz sometimes if you don't know how to use it, you need to read the directions. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You you you need to open it up. You need to look at the manual. You know, I was installing some some some volume knobs. at my house and and uh you know the thing wasn't quite matching up and and I took the screws out where that were holding on uh the little fake plate on there or whatever the little cover you know and I tried to put the new one in and and uh it didn't wasn't lining up correctly and everything and I was like man I well I guess I can use the the two that were covering the other one to get it in there but I need to go get two more and maybe I'll paint the paint them white so it doesn't stick out and and you know what I called I called my good buddy Dylan to come over and help me a little bit you know and And uh he come on over there and he's like he was looking at he goes well you know he's like uh he goes yeah those go in right there but you need two two other two other screws right here. I was like yeah you know I mean I I thought he was like well they should be in the box. They should be in the box. He grabbed the box. He opened up the box. He looked in the box. He goes they're right here. Here's exactly what you need. I got to thinking about that. You know what? Uh many times we're looking for all these things and we're trying to solve all these problems and I got to go down here and I got to do this and I need a job raising and and I need a new car and and I need to do this and and we're trying to solve all these problems. But I want to tell you all you do is got to look in the box. Just look into the greatest gift that God has ever given you. He gives you the message of the hour and I want to tell you everything that you have need of is right there in the box. There's your joy. There's your salvation. There's your peace. There's your healing. There's your deliverance. There's your Holy [screaming] Ghost. There's your sanctification. Come on, somebody help me preach this morning. Everything that you have needed has been given unto you by a vindicated prophet according to Malachi 4:5. Declaring Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. We just need to look into the box. Now, we're to our text. We only got one service this morning. Everybody feeling okay? &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 2:17. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; That's all right. I'm having a good time in his presence. &gt;&gt; I know where I'm standing. I know whom I have believed in and I am persuaded. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not worried about politics. I'm not worried about favoritism. I'm not worried about my what may come in one week or two week. I'm not so much even worried what's happened in the past because oh I'm so thankful that Christ Jehovah has taken the wise away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; While other people are worrying and they're wondering and they're sitting on the word and they can't have joy and they can't have peace and they can hardly express themselves. I wonder why. But I wonder if there's a people that's gotten so far away from their wants and their desires, they ain't worried about why. They're just worried about is he here? And we have a messenger that has declared he is present right here this morning. He is in the building. So I don't care about it. I just want to worship him. I just want to praise him. I just want to say amen to the word. He has taken my wise away. He has answered my questions. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 21:17 it says, "And when they had seen it, they made known to Braon the saying which was told them concerning this child." Oh, hallelujah. God has given us a message. &gt;&gt; And this is where you'll find everything that you have needed. The prophet of God said this. He says, "Because the angel that gave them the message, they found it just exactly the way the angel said it would be." And it's just in the place where the angel said it would be. What a thing that had must have been to them. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're catching catching the message, but I want to tell you it's everything the prophet said it was. &gt;&gt; And I have found everything that he said to be exactly thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; What about you? Or or is it just tradition? &gt;&gt; Is it just rules? &gt;&gt; Is it just a I have to? &gt;&gt; This message is exactly what the angel said it was. What do you have need of this morning? What is your heart's desire? What are the questions in your heart? What are you going through? I want to tell you, it's everything. Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. This isn't just some history lesson. This isn't just some some something that that that that oh that happened, you know, 60 years ago and and now we're just sitting around waiting for the coming of the Lord someday. Oh, if that's where if that is the condition you are in, you have missed the message of the hour because the angel, what was he saying? What was he telling those shepherds? Look, go there and you will find the word made flesh exactly where it said it was. and a prophet of God come showing and telling they search the scriptures and then you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me if you're looking for something coming in the future then you're missing what he's doing right now &gt;&gt; he goes on to say may I now introduce my Christmas message and while I'm closing out Jesus Christ the same today and forever it's that same lamb he's just as much the lamb today as he was then. He's just as much here as he was there. For his word is the same. Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I am in the midst of them. That's exactly what he said. He never changes. He's God the word. He never changes. Still giving his sheep and feeding them by his shepherd prophet. His sheep food first, not to theologians, to his sheep. I want to say this morning, if you have questions and he has the answers. &gt;&gt; If you have wise, I I just this is what's on my heart. If you have wise and you're wondering why, he will take the wise away from you. &gt;&gt; Well, why shepherds? Why Bethlehem? Why? Why a manger? &gt;&gt; Why do you keep saying, "Brother Brandon, Brother Brandham, Brother Brandon? Brother Brandon goes on. He said, "He commissioned shepherds." He says, "Not the wise and trained, but shepherds." It's a strange thing, isn't it? But there's got to be a why somewhere. There is a why. And now there got to be an answer why. And no man knows the answer save God. He's the one that knows the answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; And maybe just in turning a little corner here as we start to move towards a close by the help of God, I I think many times we might have questions and and we might wonder why and and why do things have to be this way or or why has it h had to happen this way? And you know, ought to say that God knows you've had a hard year. God knows you've had a hard life. God knows that you've had a hard time. And and maybe you're asking God, why? Why did this have to happen? Why why [screaming] are things this way? But you know, it's in the wise that can cause a lot of damage. &gt;&gt; I was listening to the life story yesterday and brother Brandham was talking about it's just amazing how he was telling the story uh and he goes, you know, I was just out there working for for the for the the the uh the uh electric company, the public company. He said, "I was out there, you know, and I climbed up those those lines and and I was just singing, you know, uh, praising the Lord and I and I looked out there and and I saw the poles kind of making a a little shadow of a cross and reminded me of my savior kind of shaking there on the cross and I was thinking, "Oh, on a hill far away." He said, "Oh, oh, there's that old rugged cross, Lord. You you died for me on that cross. It was my sins that put you there." and he was worshiping God and then it caught into his heart and he got to thinking about his his wife that had passed away and his little girl and he said, "You know, I could see maybe God taking hope from me." But my little Sherry honey, I just couldn't understand why would he do something like that. And he got to thinking. He started to ask God why. Why did this have to happen? And he said, "You know what?" He said, he got so worked up asking God why. He said, "I just can't take it any longer." He said, "Sherry, honey, uh, daddy's coming to see you." He took off them rubber gloves and he laid his hands on those electric lights and he fell down. He come to himself on the ground and he said, "Oh, if it wasn't for a predestinated gift in my life, I would have been gone a long time ago." Oh, hallelujah. I say, "What about you? What about you? It's because that predestinated gift of God on the inside of your life. You'd have walked away from the message a long time ago. You would have ODed a long time ago. You'd be an alcoholic in some insane institution, you'd be dead and six feet under. Oh, but the grace of God that he placed a gift of faith inside of you that can say amen to the word. You got an ear to ear. And I say if you got an ear to hear, you ought to shout. You ought to praise God. You ought to thank him for the greatest gift that man has ever known. The message of the hour, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. He is right here, right now. You ain't got [screaming] to ask why this and why that. Christ is here. &gt;&gt; He come to himself there and he realized I've done lost my mind. &gt;&gt; I've done lost my mind. He goes, I'm just going to go home. I'm just going to go home. And he he tried to commit suicide. And it's amazing to me that people, you think that you're not predestinated and your name's not written on the Lamb's Book of Life because you've had suicidal thoughts. That's a lie from the pits of hell. &gt;&gt; If our own prophet had such a hard time, he tried to commit suicide not once but twice. It goes to show we go through hard times. But it goes to show there's a greater power than your own. You can't take your own life cuz God is keeping you. He's watching out over you. He said, "I know my thoughts that I think of you." That's a peace not of eel to bring you to an expected end. You got an expected end, church, because you've been bought by deity. Oh, I'm feeling pretty good. What a Christmas message that Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Says he went home and he was he couldn't take it anymore. He was staying at his mommy there with little Billy and he got something in the mail. It was Sharon's believe she was six months old when the Lord took her home. He got a little something in the mail, a little savings, a count of seven cents for his little girl. &gt;&gt; He said, "I can't take it anymore." He starts to say how somehow he went into a vision. He went on somewhere and he was walking down some road and down some trail and and there was a little wagon schooner there and it had a broken wheel there and he said, "That represents my family. It won't run anymore." And he was there walking and all of a sudden this beautiful little girl, beautiful girl said, "Hi, daddy." He said, "Hello. Hello. How you doing?" He said, "It's me, Sharon. You?" He said, "You're you you know known me on earth as your as your little Sherry." He said, "But he said, we're all grown here." He said, "Sherry, that's you." He said, "Yeah, I'm going to wait here for Billy. You go on up. Mom's mom's looking. Mom's waiting for you up at the house." And he said he ran just as hard as he could go and he got up there and there was hope. He said with her long hair hanging down and her gown, he said, "Oh, I missed you. I've I missed you so bad. Me and me and Billy are so lonely." And he she said, "Oh, don't worry, Billy. &gt;&gt; We're better here than we were there. &gt;&gt; Please don't worry anymore." He looked around. He found that old chair that he had worked and saved up and and little and Hope was trying to save money so they wouldn't uh take his own own chair. And and Hope said, "This is your house. This is your chair." And brother Brand said, "Oh, Brandhams don't have homes. We we we're vandabons." He goes, "Oh, but here you do, honey. This is your home." &gt;&gt; And you see what I feel in my heart God was doing is hearing this. Why? Why was tormenting him and God took him &gt;&gt; in another place? He took him beyond the curtain of time. God was taking his prophet. He wasn't just doing that for the prophet. He was doing it for you. &gt;&gt; He was doing it for you. You might have lost a family member. You might have lost a loved one. They might their lives might have been taken in such a tragic way. And that why can eat at you and rob you of your joy and rob you of your peace. Oh, [screaming] but God has sent you a message to take you beyond the curtain of time to let you know everything that you love and everything that you hold dear, it's going to be there. Don't you worry anymore. You don't have to worry. You don't have to wonder why. What does this message do? It takes the why away. And it gives you a faith to believe that all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a message. What a Christmas. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; As we close out another year, &gt;&gt; I pray God would take away the wise, take the wise away from us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They'll get you so worked up, &gt;&gt; get you all frustrated. &gt;&gt; Why did this happen? Why did that happen? But Jesus said in Matthew 11:28, he said, "Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you. Alert of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light." No more worry, no more wondering. I know some hard things have happened in your past. Scars, hurt, home life situations, but God has sent a message to let you know everything's going to be okay. &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry. I I know I know it's hard. I know there's trouble everywhere. How how can how can you live a overcoming life in Satan's Eden? How how can you young men over overcome all the strip teases and the modern trends of the day? And and how can you possess your vessel in sanctification and honor? And how can girls carry themselves in holiness and bodice and following the commandments of the Lord given through a vindicated prophet uh to declare that he is not dead but he is alive and he is living in a people. H how can you do him? Oh, brother Matthew, there's so much trouble. There's so much wickedness. Oh yes, but we have heard a message. We have heard a shout, &gt;&gt; the Lord descending. And what did he say in Psalms 27:5? He said, "In the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock." Oh, glory to God. We have a revelation that the message of the hour is none other than Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. Don't let the test, don't let the trial try to make you question your calling and your position in Christ. &gt;&gt; The scripture says our trials are worth more precious than gold. The prophet of God said it's a testing time. It's one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested. For all children of God are tested and tried. I say then if God can take the wise away from us. &gt;&gt; Some of us struggle over and over with the question if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost or not. And you keep looking for some some type of evidence. I want to tell you the evidence is do you believe? And I and I'm not pointing to some false teaching out there that has come into the message where if you just say I believe it, I got it. know I'm what I'm trying to say. It's beyond your senses. It's beyond your emotion. If something in your heart believes that the word of God is true and in obedience to that word, you've went to a watery grave. God has given you a promise. If you repent of your sins and you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And God is not a man that he should lie. Then you should stand upon that promised word. And every time that devil comes lying to you, say, "Devil, back up in the name of the Lord, I got a divine promise. I had repented of my sins and I got a promise. Whether I got it yesterday, whether I got it today, whether I get it tomorrow, I got it because I am of the faith seat of Abraham. And the promise is just as good as the manifestation. Oh, I'm feeling pretty good because I'm going in a rapture. I am going [screaming] in a body chase because I have heard from my theophony. I have heard the [screaming] message of the hour. Come up higher, John. Come up higher. We have been set up upon the rock of revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I say it's time to move into our position and our calling. &gt;&gt; I could stay there a while, but I'm running out of time. I was fellowship by brother David about Hebrews first five chapters of Hebrews uh showing Paul's laying out there Christ and and and laying out the law uh through Moses and and showing how that they received the word but it wasn't mixed with faith and it didn't profited them anything. &gt;&gt; And he comes and tells the people y'all y'all should y'all should be teachers but you you need milk. It's amazing to me we have people who believe this message and are getting married and still dancing like the world, &gt;&gt; still wearing makeup. &gt;&gt; I'll go ahead and say it. Your wedding should be your opportunity to declare to the world that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; That is, sisters, that is one of your greatest platforms &gt;&gt; to declare the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "You want to see what somebody's made of? Let the pressure come." And they give into culture. They give into movements. &gt;&gt; They're influenced by Instagram &gt;&gt; on how they should represent the message of the hour. I got to be out by a creek. I got to be on a pond. It got to be these big trees. &gt;&gt; That's not how my Lord came. &gt;&gt; And you deserve something better than my Lord. Look, I ain't trying to tell you not to have a nice wedding, but what I'm telling you, don't put the world first. Put Christ first. Put the message of the hour first. Wear your hair, Lord. Get those makeup off of you. Wear your glory. &gt;&gt; This dancing and modern trend of them heathenistic rituals. &gt;&gt; Shame on us. &gt;&gt; When you ought to be teachers, you need milk. &gt;&gt; Pastor has to come up and tell us what the Holy Ghost would look like in a believer's life when you should have the Holy Ghost declaring what it looks like in your life. You can look at me crosseyed all you want, but I know where I'm standing and I know whom I believe in and I am persuaded. Search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me. &gt;&gt; He is not dead. [screaming] He is alive. Living in you, living in you, living in you. Oh, but he goes he lays all that down and says, "When you ought to be teachers, you need milk." &gt;&gt; But oh, he turns over into chapter six. He says, "But let us go on into perfection." &gt;&gt; He said, "Strong meat belongs unto them that are of full age." &gt;&gt; Oh, it doesn't belong unto the Methodist. and the restoration of gifts. And &gt;&gt; but strong meat belongs to my friends, to the bride who can grow up in the restoration of what God was building back. And then when he comes and says, "Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood, oh Lord Jesus Christ, will you go also?" Where else would we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. When people are running away from this message and they're letting down their standards and they're letting the world coming in and they're drifting in their music and their modesty and their dress and in their weddings and their music, I want to tell you there is a bornag again bride of Jesus Christ who's been baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost and they will hold the standard of the world high and high and lifted up. If you lift Jesus Christ up, I will [screaming] draw all men underneath. Where is he? He is in you. He is in his bride. [screaming] Your wedding might be the very thing that calls the last one in &gt;&gt; or sends the last one out. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Well, we're here. I'm sorry. I even got a wedding coming up. Praise God. The Lord knows what we have need of. &gt;&gt; I'm saying that because I here recently I was at a wedding and I won't go into it. But one thing I know, I know what the word of God produces. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know them by their fruits, &gt;&gt; not their gifts. I don't care how loud you jump, scream, talk in tongues, how much you prophesy, how much you can do back flips, and run across the tops of the pews. I want to tell you, you know them by their fruits. &gt;&gt; Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, kindness, brotherly kindness, all those things. Just a few more minutes as we work towards a close. Prophet of God said just speaking on this this this quote struck out to me. Y'all doing okay? We feeling all right? &gt;&gt; We we got no uh evening service. So we just take our time here working towards a close, but it won't be too long. But it's just speaking about this moving into our perfection. We we ought to be a full age. Our lives ought to be teaching and instructing others &gt;&gt; when when when we we see we're lacking and we still need the sincere milk of the word to teach us as babies when we should be so much further down the road. This bride is a mature lady. &gt;&gt; She's been impregnated with the word. She's coming in invisible union. We're right there on the thresh of stepping over into the change of our bodies. And you're trying to tell me we're over here uh uh uh uh uh with well why you know why can't we listen to that and why can't we listen to this and you know I think it'll be okay and it's just one time it's just it's just for this it's just for that. &gt;&gt; No I I don't I I never found anywhere in the Bible or in the message where the Holy Ghost was wishy-washy. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost ain't the Holy Ghost six days a week and on the seventh day. It ain't the Holy Ghost 364 days a year. No, it the Holy Ghost 247. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we ain't lining up, we just need a good old repentance. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said this in talking about moving into our position and calling about 101 15 more minutes. This is and God doesn't call a man to judge him without first warning him. He says, "If you went to work for a man and he gave you a job on a ranch or something or another and you just went out to the barn and just sat down out there and say, "Well, see, you must go ask him what he wants you to do and then do it." If you're working for a man, find out what your duties is. And then if you're if our life on this earth here, then we should go to the one who put us here. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I don't have to ask where do I go? &gt;&gt; Do I go to this church or to that church? Put us here and say, Lord, what would you have me to do? What must I do? Why am I here? If it's to be a housewife, dishwasher, whatever God wants you to do, then you do the very best that you know how to do it. &gt;&gt; No matter how little, &gt;&gt; no matter how little it is, you must do it. &gt;&gt; You wonder why people are acting the way that they're doing. You wonder why they they do these things. You wonder why it lacks the sanctity, the holiness, and the character. Is there not hearing with understanding? Brother Brandham shows us the difference. He that heareth my words, not just hear intellectually because he gives the parable. He gives the type says you can go out there and the drunkard be in the same service and say, "Hey, did you hear the preacher?" And he say, "Yeah, I heard him." But there's no understanding to do what the word said to do. And I say a lot of us are hearing but where is the understanding? Because the understanding will be reflected in your character. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That that's that's why we see the things that we see in people's lives is because they need a greater revelation. John 14:15, Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commandments." Why do we see transgressing? Why why do we think there's a lack of revelation? There's a lack of love. John 10:27, he said, "My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." Just moving now towards the end, he's just in this message why it had to be shepherds. How how he bypassed the uneduca, bypassed the educated. And here he's using these uh uh uh uh uh shepherds. They they they smelt bad and they they they they looked they looked bad and they they hung out with all the sheep. But the prophet of God is pointing out something. He says all they needed to do was to know the sheep. And he's starting to show a great parallel here about our great shepherd. And this is where we'll we'll move along these lines to a close because Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd and the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep." And brother Ben says this. He says, "And the great prophet shepherd, Jesus did it himself. I laid down my life. No man takes it from me. He was the great shepherd. The great prophet shepherd. No man takes it from me. I do it myself." Notice it didn't gradually come. It come in a minute. The great shepherd himself took our guilt and smoked himself. Took our sins and laid it upon himself. No wonder, the poet wrote, "Mid rendering rocks and darkening skies, my savior bowed his head and died. The opening veil revealed the way to heaven's joys and endless day. He said that secret had been in God's bosom all these years, covered by his right hand. Jesus, the great shepherd, took it upon himself our guilt for us. The scripture says in Isaiah 53:5, we're talking about Christmas, but he was wounded for our transgression. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. There ought to be such a thanksgiving &gt;&gt; to think that all of our sins and bad living and every bad decision that we've ever made and the ones you're going to make, it was all laid upon Christ. And to think the very word came and was born and laid in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes, it looked so insignificant. How could any good thing come out of Nazareth? And yet it was exactly what the word said it was. I asked you, what about the message of the hour? Oh, it's not popular. It didn't come to the theologians. Oh, but it bypassed down to what would be called an illiterate, uneducated man by the name of William Brandham. But God gave him a message. And what is that message? It's a message of deliverance. is to take us in an exodus out of this uh terrible dark and dreadful world into a body change and into a rapture. And I'll just close reading this out of the book. Oh, just speak just thinking about the iniquities, all of our iniquities been laid upon them all. Brother Brandham says this. He says, "The believers whose names were written in the book of life, predestinated from the foundation of the world, it was finished that very minute that Jesus said it was finished. He, that great shepherd, had come for his sheep. It was finished. God's right hand was pulled from his bosom, smitten. Then on Easter, he returned it. Amen. Raised up again uh raised up again to his bosom and extended it down to you and I in the form of his word to redeem us back to the original garden from which sin took us from. &gt;&gt; I'm reading the prophet. Help me out. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll take my time. We'll start over. The believers whose names were written in the book of life predestinated from the foundation of the world. It was finished that very minute that Jesus said it was finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He that great shepherd had come for his sheep. &gt;&gt; It was finished. &gt;&gt; God's right hand was pulled from his bosom, smitten. Then on Easter, he returned it. Amen. raised up again to his bosom and extended it down to you and I in the form of his word to redeem us back to the original garden from which sin took us from. Oh, to think we have received a message that's taken us back to a garden of Eden condition before sin was even ever conceived. &gt;&gt; Now we're in the three-fold mystery purpose of Christ. Christ the mystery of God revealed what? Christ revealing himself. Christ having the preeminence in his bride. And what was the third three-fold? To take us back to an Eden condition. &gt;&gt; He said the hidden secret of his great heart was revealed by a prophet shepherd. It was revealed by a shepherd. Prophet shepherd. No wonder the mountains jumped and shouted on that day. No wonder the sun hid its face and screamed for joy. No wonder all the all nature broke loose. The wind shook the trees until they shook and shook and joy and jumped. They seen the prophet shepherd on the mountain redeemed every name on the book of life. Oh, you're redeemed this morning. &gt;&gt; And they seen that their own nature was redeemed. They screamed and jumped and the world went into an earthquake and the mountains rent and the rocks fell out and the sun went down and everything taken place. Like any meeting, when the shepherd reveals to you, it's finished. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I pray that the revelation would strike somebody this morning. It take away the wise. Why did this have to happen? Why did that have to happen? Maybe I'm not the bride. If I was the bride, why? I wouldn't have come this way. My family wouldn't be like this. I wouldn't have a broken home. Why this? But I want to tell you, if you ever catch a revelation that the message has been sent to you, behold, I send you Elijah. Oh, I pray that you would open up your heart and by faith say, I believe it. It is finished. There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin. If God before us, who can be against us, oh, praise the Lord, it is finished. You don't have to worry. You don't have to ask why. You just have to say, "I am the pride of Jesus Christ. My neighbors reink on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. So, I am going in a rapture. Boo, devil, get out of my way. Every promise in the book is mine. I'm going in a rapture. I'm going to get my healing. I'm going to get my family. I'm going to get my kids. I'm going to get everything that God has ever promised me because it is finished." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I've seen jumping spells and joy spells, but there was nobody hurt. The mountains rung down, the sun went down, and everything took place, but there was nobody hurt. And I've seen meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the joy of the Lord filled the congregation. They stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their [screaming] voice for the glory of God. I never did see anything disorderly. They was always right in order &gt;&gt; because &gt;&gt; their friends were doing it &gt;&gt; because it was the popular thing to do. because I wanted to fit in with the youth group. Because I wanted the people to think that I I had a revelation of the message. &gt;&gt; No, you can do that, but you'll go right back to loose living. You'll go back to your country music. You'll go back to your Instagram. You'll go back to your old friends. You'll go back to all those things. But I ain't mad if you try. Give it a try. And if you find out it don't hold on, you need to get it for real. I never did see anything disorderly. They was always right in order because they had recognized that their name had been written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. The great prophet shepherd had brought them the message and they were delivered. Hallelujah. Christ has sent me a message by divine promise according to Malachi 4:5. And I am free. I am delivered. That's why I shout. That's why I scream. There ain't no drug. There ain't no religion. There ain't no alcohol. There ain't nothing that got a hold on me. I'm free. I'm delivered. That's why I shout. That's why I scream. That's why I have a good time. I never did see anything that was disorderly because I got a revelation that my name is written on the Lamb's book of life. Boo, devil, back up. I'm free. It is finished. I say, "Why don't the love of God fill the congregation? Give them praise. Give them honor if the musicians would come." [applause] &gt;&gt; I say, "We ought to appreciate the message of the hour. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, it is finished. &gt;&gt; Have you seen that your name is written on the Lamb's book of life?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't need no morphine shot. &gt;&gt; I don't need no pills. &gt;&gt; I don't need no AA. &gt;&gt; I don't need no counseling because I've already had a conference. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. What we need this morning is a conference with God on the back side of the desert in the presence of the pillar of fire, that burning bush. And that's what the message came to declare to you. Christ is risen. Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Oh, why don't you praise God? Why don't you tell him you love him? Why don't you show your appreciation &gt;&gt; for his greatest gift? &gt;&gt; Say, why don't you tell him you love him? Why don't you talk to him for a moment? &gt;&gt; Why don't you rejoice? Why don't you praise God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, go ahead a little bit. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I think it's all right to tell them, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." &gt;&gt; Lord, I've gotten excited about Christmas gifts. I've got excited about uh uh things. But oh, God, one thing I want to get excited about is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I was made for more. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, tell me this. &gt;&gt; If you hold your voice, &gt;&gt; the rocks will cry out. But ain't no rock going to take my place. [music] &gt;&gt; Ain't no tree going to take my place. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show my appreciation. &gt;&gt; I'm going to cry out and say, "It is finished." &gt;&gt; Why is it finished? Cuz Jesus Christ paid your ransom. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; But as we sing the song, oh the thought that was on my heart, take the wise away. You were made for more. You were made to manifest the message of the hour. I know who I am. [singing] [music] Cuz I know who you are. The cross of [music and singing] salvation. ation was only [music] chosen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; for [singing] free and I [music] have a future and it's worth living. Oh, you know who I [music and singing] am cuz I know who you are. [music] The cross of salvation always [music and singing] now I am chosen. [music] Oh free and forg. I have [music] a future and it is worth [music] the living. Why? Oh, [music and singing] I was taking away. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So why would I shame without [music] my [singing] way? I was faithful. [music] I know I [music] am cuz I know who you are. [music] You cross the sales. [music and singing] [music and singing] [music] I am a future. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; is worth [music] [singing] my [singing] [music] [singing] [music] my sh [music] [singing] my way. I know I am. I [music and singing] was faithful. Brother Brandham starts to close out his message and he says, "Now, if you've been listening to something, [music] another's pulled you away from the real true shepherd that'll lead you to the word, the Holy Spirit. You do not have the experience and you do not have the witness of the Holy Spirit in your life. God is one. God is the only one that has eternal life &gt;&gt; and he is eternal life." Amen. &gt;&gt; And anything that had a beginning has an end. &gt;&gt; And if you're just a member of a church, it had a beginning. &gt;&gt; You're born of the word, then you become a son of God. And your name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. [music] And you, the color of your hair that you have, the color of your eyes, you have, the stature that you're in. [music] Oh, see sometimes we ask why. Why me? Why this? Why do I look like that? Why is my nose so big? Those wise wishing things were different. But look what the prophet's letting you know. Oh, I say the message takes away the wise and it gives a faith &gt;&gt; because what my heart's desire is to show is that we have questions and not all your questions are going to be answered. Job could have had a lot of questions, but one thing he received was a revelation. &gt;&gt; He no longer had to wonder why. He just said, "I know that my redeemer liveth. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." Oh, it took away the lies. I say, "Oh God, my heart's desire this morning is God takes away the lies and gives revelation." &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He said, "God seen you before the foundation of the world, and he's seen you a human being like you are. And though there come a million years yet, there's nothing can keep you from coming back to that [music] perfect image &gt;&gt; that God ordained for you &gt;&gt; in the beginning." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How do you know? My sheep &gt;&gt; hear my voice. &gt;&gt; And a stranger they will not follow. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. There's nothing that can [music] stop it. Well, some glad [singing] morning. Wow. [music] [music] Heat. [singing] [music] Heat. [music] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You are happy. [singing and music] [music] [singing] Yeah. [music] Heat. [singing] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; My [music and singing] heart stop. [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; When we redeemed our &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I watch I will shout and I will sing praise the [music] Lord with [singing] my I am thinking we are high on the [music] holy Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. [music] Heat. Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Let's [music] think of it. Amen. The angels [music] will hallelujah. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I I think that's just what we needed to end the years. A good evangelistic message &gt;&gt; to get our minds back on the things that matter. [music] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? This is a this is a the hour of salvation. Right. &gt;&gt; I I thought as I [music] as Matthew was preaching, I went back to what I mentioned in the second chapter. Hannah says this. She says, "And Hannah prayed and said, my heart rejoicth in the Lord. My horn is exalted in the Lord. [music] My mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And and then she goes on, there is none holy as the [music] Lord. &gt;&gt; There is none besides thee, neither is there any rock like our God. Talk no more [music] so exceedingly proudly. Let not arrogance come out of your mouth. For the Lord is a God of knowledge, [music] and by him actions are weighed. &gt;&gt; Oh my. [music] This is a a a woman praying to the Lord. Listen to that great [music] knowledge and wisdom. The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumble [music] are girded with strength. [music] They that were full have hired out themselves for bread, and they that were hungry seized. So the barren hath borne seven, and she hath had many children, [music] is wax feeble. The Lord kleth and maketh alive. He bringeth down [music] the grave and bringeth up. The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich. He bringeth [music] low and he lifted up high. He raised up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the [music] dungill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory. [music] For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and he hath sent the world upon them. That's your God. He liftth you up. [music] He's mindful of you. You know, when your heart's stirred up and you [music] and the word of God comes, it it's it's there to cut the things that are ungodly &gt;&gt; out of our lives. And if it it's not given just so that we can repent. Repentance is necessary [music] and good. But it's that you can get into a relationship with the Lord and you can start walking daily with him on your hearts and him on your minds knowing that this is not our home and that you can become mindful of every action for the Lord weighth your actions and it becomes a consciousness. [music] a Christian consciousness. And [music] that's what Christianity is, is let this mind be in you that was [music] in Christ Jesus. We only have one service today. Our next service is New Year's Eve and it's good at I believe it's starting about 7:00 7:30. We'll have fellowship in the fellowship hall. We'll have food and and fellowship and then we'll come over for service &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh starting around 9:30 10:00. Then we'll have communion. But take this morning the things that were said and weigh them in your heart and ask yourself, what thing should I [music] apply the token to &gt;&gt; and what things should I enlarge without condemnation &gt;&gt; because the price has been paid. you can go forward and be more Christlike. I saw these little family on the front pew here and I thought they're some of the nicest behaved children I've ever seen that you might not think so but but they really did wonderful. I I was really impressed. [music] I wanted to say that to you. God bless you. It's a hard place to sit and they did really wonderful. Don't miss the part of the message too about loving one another, &gt;&gt; having no respect of persons &gt;&gt; and letting the love of God be shed abroad in your [music] heart by the Holy Spirit. Let's be real reflectors [music] of the message we have. I I believe that was a strong theme [music] this morning. What does your life reflect? Who are you identified with? Who what light does your light shine on? &gt;&gt; And here we've got the greatest message. [music] &gt;&gt; And we ought to live and give oursel to it. As Hannah in this scripture, you know the story of Hannah. [music] She didn't bring her son to the temple until he was weaned. Go. When he was finally weaned and other she wasn't nursing him, he was potty trained. She brought him to the temple and she left him there for God's service because she promised God, "Lord, if you'll do this for [music] me, I'll give this son to your service." And that son turned out to be Samuel, one of the greatest prophets in God's Bible. If you give your life to God, &gt;&gt; his benefits to you are exceedingly and abundantly above that which we can even think. And I know Matthew encouraged those of you this morning [music] who haven't given your life to the Lord, go back. Those of us that have backslid, let's rededicate our lives back to the Lord. We're going into a new year. I thought this evangelistic [music] service this morning was just what we had need of. Let's reive our lives and [music] and rededicate our lives to the Lord and remember [music] it was by the blood. &gt;&gt; I like to sing that. There is the blood that. So this morning [music] when you think about it, think that what he said. You were paid for by deity. [music] That's a pretty strong thought. You could say, well, David McGary gave his life for me. And that might carry [music] a little bit of weight, but when you can say deity, [music] &gt;&gt; I was purchased by God. &gt;&gt; And if you can take that faith, [music] you can look at Satan [singing] and say, "You've got no hold on me. &gt;&gt; I am going to overcome. &gt;&gt; I'm going to overcome these [music] problems. I'm going to overcome these things. And it's a mind battle. But if you'll walk with him every day, [music] you'll touch the hem of his garment [singing] every day. You'll pray to him [music] every day. You'll read your Bible every day. I implore you to [music] put on a tape &gt;&gt; and listen. God will speak to you. &gt;&gt; You'll find yourself lifted up. You'll be like Hannah. My mouth is enlarged over my enemy. You know what that means? In other words, I'm speaking to my enemy. He's [music] not speaking to me. My mouth is enlarged over [music] my enemy. &gt;&gt; I'm telling my enemy. He's not [singing] telling me. Why? Because I rejoice [music] &gt;&gt; in the salvation &gt;&gt; of the Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. There [singing] is a blood [music] that made my way. [music] [music and singing] &gt;&gt; That was for you. &gt;&gt; Think of it. My sins [music] were my sins &gt;&gt; for God. [music] &gt;&gt; They're forgotten to Christ. [music] His precious [music] blood. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; I define [singing] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] I love you. [music] [singing] And he's coming [music] back. &gt;&gt; He's coming back. [music] It [music] is the [singing] holy power [music] to [singing] &gt;&gt; purchase my deity. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; can you just say pour down on me this morning, [music] &gt;&gt; oh Lord, [music] because he [singing] [music] [singing] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Hey, Heat. [music] [music] [singing] sing [music] [singing] that he's coming back for. &gt;&gt; He's [music] coming back for you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Happy New Year. I hope you can all join us [music] next Wednesday night. Live for God. &gt;&gt; Live for God. Cut the things of the world away one by one. Just chop [music] chopping them off and live for God. Confess with your mouth. Speak it out every day. Lord, I'm living this day for you. I'm turning my life around. I'm going to take this word. I'm going to be a Christian. Lord, I'm not going to let you. My mouth is enlarged over my [music] enemy. God bless you. Go in peace. Amen. Amen. You love him this morning. Is he good? [music] &gt;&gt; When's he good? &gt;&gt; All the time. God's good. God bless you. Go in peace. Let's sing it as we go. Oh, if you're [singing] walking to the valley and the shadow all [singing] around. Oh, do not fear. [music] He will guide [singing] you. He will keep you safe [music] and [singing] he promised to [music] never leave you for you and his word [music and singing] is true. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; will [music] is [music] the light will shine. God is good. Oh, God is good. [music] Oh, I like it. Oh, we worship for our [music] worthy fil [music] his holy spirit. Now [music] we can [singing] [music] love his everlasting and his mercy. We will [singing] never [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] is [music] shine. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hey [music] girl. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hello. [music] Hello. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music]
