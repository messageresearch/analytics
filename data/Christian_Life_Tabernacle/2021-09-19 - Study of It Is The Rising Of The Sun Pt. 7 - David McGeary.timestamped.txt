[46:10] [Music]
[46:13] lord you
[46:14] are such a provider
[46:16] [Music]
[46:18] you know where you
[46:21] want to take us
[46:22] [Music]
[46:24] or many times we have other plans but
[46:28] you so patiently
[46:30] place your hand on our lives to bring us
[46:32] to where that
[46:34] we have
[46:36] to be and one day you'll eternally take
[46:38] us from here
[46:40] that's what we long for we ask you to
[46:42] bless us tonight as we
[46:44] sit and fellowship around your word
[46:48] in the wonderful and precious name of
[46:50] the lord jesus christ we pray
[46:53] amen
[46:54] amen god bless you tonight let's let's
[46:58] turn back again to our scripture
[47:00] in malachi 4 and and just read that
[47:03] again and
[47:04] we're reading it uh
[47:07] that scripture
[47:08] uh just to
[47:12] you know
[47:13] again
[47:15] add that light to that statement that
[47:17] was read
[47:19] he said well how can the bride come
[47:22] and fail to manifest everything
[47:26] was promised of him
[47:28] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[47:31] the bride
[47:33] but when he did everything even to prove
[47:36] it
[47:37] by raising himself up from the dead
[47:40] afterwards
[47:41] then
[47:43] and then don't the bride have to do the
[47:46] same thing
[47:47] we have to be exactly what the word
[47:50] said
[47:51] she should be in these last days
[47:54] don't she have to return
[47:56] through malachi
[47:58] 4
[48:00] don't you have to be manifested like it
[48:03] was in the days of sodom
[48:06] don't the world have to be just exactly
[48:09] like it is isn't these things a perfect
[48:13] identification of the word of god made
[48:16] known to us and so we read here it says
[48:19] behold
[48:20] i will send you elijah the prophet
[48:23] before the coming of the great and
[48:25] dreadful day of the lord and he shall
[48:28] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[48:30] children
[48:31] and the hearts of the children to their
[48:33] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[48:36] with the curse father we ask you to
[48:38] bless us this evening in your precious
[48:41] name we pray amen amen god bless you
[48:44] this morning
[48:46] i guess that uh most of us got that
[48:49] quickening power this morning and are no
[48:51] longer with us
[48:53] and uh
[48:54] and uh but that's okay
[48:58] but we're here
[48:59] and i don't know any place i'd rather be
[49:03] you know so
[49:05] we'll just rejoice maybe they knew we
[49:08] were going to listen to a little bit of
[49:09] tape tonight and
[49:11] and
[49:12] but you know it
[49:14] even with us preaching this morning we
[49:17] wouldn't have anything to preach without
[49:20] this
[49:22] you'd be hearing what's on every street
[49:25] corner
[49:26] everywhere
[49:28] but
[49:28] see i i i
[49:30] i feel that
[49:31] you know it it's hard because
[49:34] we have so many ideas
[49:37] that's been put in our heads for so long
[49:40] that part of what god has to do is
[49:42] filter everything out
[49:45] you know and he put had to put paul on
[49:47] the back side of the desert
[49:50] to get everything out of him he had to
[49:51] put moses
[49:53] in the wilderness just to filter
[49:55] everything out because you know you have
[49:57] certain things and they become
[49:59] definitions
[50:01] to you and then you use those thoughts
[50:05] to
[50:06] so you use your thoughts to hear
[50:09] and and that's why it has to be beyond
[50:12] what you hear it has to be understanding
[50:15] by
[50:16] revelation
[50:17] and that you know as we're we were uh
[50:21] you know reading so we read malachi and
[50:23] ev everybody mostly reached that
[50:26] scripture
[50:27] and thinks that he's talking about being
[50:29] restored back
[50:31] to
[50:32] to
[50:32] the pentecost
[50:34] when
[50:35] they went into the upper room
[50:38] and and really if if you notice when
[50:41] they went to the upper room jesus had
[50:43] told them something basically he told
[50:45] them go out and do the works that i do
[50:48] because the works i do you shall do
[50:50] also. he said go out there and forgive
[50:53] them of their sins
[50:55] you know who's you know i mean what you
[50:57] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
[51:00] and what you lose shall be loosed and
[51:03] and you you cast out devils and whose
[51:05] sins you forgive they shall be forgiven
[51:09] that is absolutely
[51:11] him himself
[51:13] passing on all the authority he had to
[51:17] them
[51:18] and we know that satan took that into
[51:20] the ground so a lot of times when we
[51:23] think about being
[51:26] you know being restored we just look
[51:28] like going back to the apostles but this
[51:31] restoration goes way
[51:33] farther back
[51:35] amen because
[51:36] what
[51:38] what
[51:39] the restoration of what pentecost
[51:42] was or what people think happened
[51:45] at the upper room
[51:46] that's been tried to be duplicated and
[51:49] duplicated and manifested in so many
[51:52] different ways but this
[51:54] original
[51:56] can't be duplicated
[51:58] it doesn't go back any farther
[52:01] so we understand that we're not talking
[52:04] here
[52:05] about
[52:06] we're talking about justification
[52:08] sanctification baptism of the holy stone
[52:12] ghost but this is a step beyond that
[52:15] and this is what this message is it's
[52:17] more
[52:18] than just those three steps those three
[52:21] steps is what brought the church to the
[52:24] place to receive
[52:26] what was elected for them
[52:29] amen i tell you it sure is a comfort to
[52:32] me to sit back and finally
[52:34] really realize that
[52:36] he had me in his mind
[52:39] before the foundation of the world and
[52:41] the only reason i'm here is because he
[52:44] thought me and put me here
[52:46] and he made known to me
[52:50] amen i didn't figure it out
[52:52] i wasn't sitting in my
[52:54] chair one day reading my bible and read
[52:56] malachi 4 5 and said oh you know there's
[52:58] got to be a prophet coming this day no
[53:01] something showed up
[53:03] a light showed up and and there was a
[53:05] manifestation and a work done in the
[53:08] flesh and and we saw it
[53:10] and when we saw it meant something more
[53:13] to us
[53:14] than it did to somebody else when i
[53:16] first came into the message
[53:20] i remember going up to uh
[53:23] we are as you know we had a little
[53:24] commune
[53:26] and we went up to uh
[53:29] a place
[53:30] up the coast a little bit because a man
[53:32] wanted to talk to us about
[53:34] brother branham so we were very
[53:36] interested in so we went up and we went
[53:38] in his living room and we were all
[53:40] sitting there together and i can just
[53:43] visual it today
[53:44] and he came in and he had a picture of
[53:47] the pillar of fire
[53:48] and wow i mean i just lit up
[53:51] like a thing and he threw it on the
[53:54] table
[53:55] and in front of me and he said i've
[53:58] never seen such a fake
[54:01] in all my life
[54:02] and and you know i'm only like 20 you
[54:05] know 20 years old
[54:07] and you know but uh
[54:10] you know
[54:11] and i i just don't know how to
[54:13] express it anyway i just sat there
[54:17] and i literally saw
[54:19] the the ceiling of his house and
[54:22] everything caving in
[54:25] on him
[54:26] like from an earthquake and it wasn't
[54:28] just a day or two later that i listened
[54:30] to choosing of the bride
[54:33] but to him it meant nothing
[54:36] but for some reason it meant something
[54:38] to us
[54:40] and i you know i i appreciated again
[54:43] that the men's breakfast it was such a
[54:45] wonderful time of fellowship many people
[54:49] have grown up in the message but god
[54:52] always has a way
[54:54] of taking it to you personally
[54:56] where it it it it just comes down to
[54:59] where you see it and and then you see
[55:02] what maybe your parents saw maybe you
[55:05] see more than what your parents saw they
[55:07] may be they may be in a different hour
[55:10] of labor than that you've been in but
[55:13] you're in a wonderful time so this is
[55:16] something that
[55:17] it we're not talking
[55:19] about
[55:20] something that
[55:22] has happened
[55:24] we are in the happening
[55:27] you understand that that that
[55:31] that addition
[55:32] that the part that's added to
[55:36] the baptism of the holy spirit to that
[55:39] word to that third pull that
[55:42] distribution of of
[55:45] the the
[55:46] your abstract
[55:48] in other words who you were in his mind
[55:51] or the foundation of the world it's
[55:53] being presented to us and can you may
[55:56] not be there uh
[55:58] yet but but
[55:59] just keep going
[56:02] you understand he'll get you there
[56:04] and if if he comes before you reach that
[56:07] place he'll bring it with him
[56:09] amen he'll finish the work in you
[56:12] and so alls we can do is just is is take
[56:16] one step at a time
[56:18] press for the higher calling that you
[56:20] know let our light shine
[56:23] walk in all the light we have
[56:25] receive correction from the holy spirit
[56:28] as he brings it to be humble
[56:31] you know the zeal for this age is be
[56:34] zealous and repent you know to say
[56:37] you're sorry to make things right
[56:40] but don't ever let satan rob you in
[56:43] other words he can try
[56:45] to take your title from you but you can
[56:48] just remember i've got an abstract
[56:51] that's going to back this title up and
[56:53] when and i'm waiting for it to arrive in
[56:56] the mail and when it does
[56:58] you are never going to be able to set
[57:00] foot on my land again
[57:03] amen so we're just going to listen uh
[57:06] uh to i think it's about 28 minutes
[57:10] and
[57:11] so we're going to listen to what that
[57:13] we've heard
[57:14] and then he's going to
[57:16] uh
[57:18] well brother brahma is going to begin to
[57:20] mention
[57:21] um
[57:22] uh
[57:23] people
[57:24] in the scripture and he's pointing it as
[57:26] see look at what it did
[57:29] on them
[57:30] and and we we've got a great
[57:33] great uh
[57:34] law of god that's been shared with us if
[57:37] god ever does
[57:39] one thing one way he's got to continue
[57:42] to do it
[57:43] if anybody's ever approached him
[57:47] on a certain ground and in a certain way
[57:50] and he gave them a certain answer if you
[57:54] approach him on that same ground you
[57:56] will get identically the same answer
[58:01] amen it may be customized
[58:05] to you
[58:06] personally but the end result is the
[58:09] same he's not improving
[58:14] i like that
[58:15] you know god's not
[58:17] improving he's he was what he was he's
[58:20] the i am not the i will be or the i was
[58:25] he says i am everything that we are
[58:28] came from him
[58:30] and that's why he's alpha and omega i'm
[58:32] the beginning of it i'm the end of it
[58:35] i'm the beginning of you and i'm the end
[58:38] of you
[58:39] i like that i come from god
[58:41] i go to god amen what a glorious
[58:45] resurrection so
[58:47] let's just enjoy uh the word of god i i
[58:50] i sit here this evening and i think you
[58:52] know
[58:54] we want to
[58:56] we want to build a little bigger
[58:58] building and
[58:59] and
[59:01] i we listened to
[59:04] a
[59:05] statue of a perfect man in in the first
[59:07] paragraph in the statue of a perfect man
[59:10] brother brown begins to talk about all
[59:12] the trouble that he's having getting the
[59:16] to the
[59:17] church remodeled he said we bring it to
[59:19] him and they send it back and we take it
[59:21] to somebody else and they tell us no and
[59:24] they send it over here well
[59:26] i i got a note from my uh our civil
[59:29] engineer who's working with the city he
[59:32] says we've got everything down he said
[59:34] but now the fire marshal is uh
[59:38] changing his mind
[59:39] from what he told us originally
[59:42] and he wanted
[59:44] they agreed to have 25 foot
[59:47] turn radiuses
[59:49] and
[59:50] so
[59:51] but now the fire marshal wants to go
[59:53] back
[59:53] to 30.
[59:55] and but i just think that we've got that
[59:57] problem solved we were going to have a
[1:00:01] we're talking with the trustees and the
[1:00:03] deacons about it but we were going to
[1:00:05] put a balcony in but i really don't
[1:00:07] think that's necessary we can add those
[1:00:10] balcony seats on the main floor and have
[1:00:13] the building look a little more
[1:00:14] comfortable and not so gigantic
[1:00:17] and
[1:00:18] we still will be able to see 400 people
[1:00:21] so
[1:00:22] you're going to feel awful little in
[1:00:24] that building
[1:00:25] so you're going to have to come right up
[1:00:27] front
[1:00:28] and get right in because if we scatter
[1:00:30] all out
[1:00:31] over that but maybe god will just start
[1:00:33] moving on more harm
[1:00:35] amen i i
[1:00:37] i was really moved
[1:00:39] this morning
[1:00:40] with the uh
[1:00:42] people that have come up from prayer and
[1:00:44] it was people that i've never seen
[1:00:46] before but the they were really moved by
[1:00:50] the spirit of god the spirit of god was
[1:00:52] really touching hearts
[1:00:54] uh he was
[1:00:55] doing for him a lot of times i'll ask
[1:00:59] what
[1:01:01] people are praying for but i didn't feel
[1:01:03] to ask because i knew he was here and he
[1:01:07] knew
[1:01:08] and the scripture says that he knows
[1:01:10] what you have need of even before
[1:01:13] you act so
[1:01:15] it you know if you if it didn't seem
[1:01:17] like i wanted to hear what you had to
[1:01:19] say i just felt in my heart he already
[1:01:22] knew it and and if he knew it before you
[1:01:25] even ask it
[1:01:27] i'm kind of out of the picture
[1:01:29] and i want to be out of the picture i'm
[1:01:31] trying to live to get out of the picture
[1:01:34] if you know what i mean but i know
[1:01:35] you'll certainly enjoy this if you have
[1:01:38] a way to read the message or you can
[1:01:41] read it on the board or if you have
[1:01:43] something in i believe we're going to
[1:01:45] start it
[1:01:47] paragraph 225
[1:01:50] and
[1:01:51] we're just going to pick up
[1:01:53] uh
[1:01:55] there and uh
[1:01:57] and uh
[1:01:58] and listen for uh
[1:02:01] the did i say
[1:02:05] did i say 225 yeah 220 yeah 225 and
[1:02:09] we're just gonna listen from there about
[1:02:12] 28 minutes and then we'll just
[1:02:16] uh just point out a few little things
[1:02:18] maybe that step out up to us and
[1:02:21] and
[1:02:22] we'll move forward so keep me in prayer
[1:02:25] for next weekend
[1:02:27] i'm preaching sunday morning
[1:02:30] a brother i
[1:02:32] believe ron lilly's going to be speaking
[1:02:36] there at the meetings and
[1:02:38] i think it's uh
[1:02:41] brother ben beard i believe is preaching
[1:02:44] and
[1:02:45] and then i have sunday morning so
[1:02:48] you're welcome to come
[1:02:49] if you would like
[1:02:51] i think billy will be here brother randy
[1:02:53] will be out of town on on
[1:02:56] vacation i guess winning souls in ohio
[1:02:59] matthew and cosmin will be
[1:03:01] in romania so
[1:03:05] billy can do too
[1:03:06] and
[1:03:08] it'll be good amen
[1:03:10] it's always been a blessing for my soul
[1:03:12] i'm excited about what the lord has i
[1:03:16] really am i
[1:03:18] it's just that
[1:03:19] uh i believe we we've tried and tried to
[1:03:22] press ourselves into this place but i
[1:03:25] think it's coming exactly according to
[1:03:28] his timing that people are re really
[1:03:32] you're actually going to see
[1:03:34] miracles in your works and things that
[1:03:37] you've desired manifesting
[1:03:40] and it's not going to be a big show he
[1:03:44] said this was done
[1:03:46] kind of in a secret place you know what
[1:03:48] i mean that god god put it all before
[1:03:51] the people and they rejected it now it's
[1:03:55] for those that accepted it so
[1:03:57] enjoy this little 28 minute site to me i
[1:04:00] love listening to tapes i i honestly
[1:04:05] listen to tapes by myself
[1:04:07] but then when i listen to them sitting
[1:04:09] here with you there's a whole another
[1:04:12] added richness
[1:04:14] to it and it makes me feel a part of
[1:04:17] something that is real just not me
[1:04:20] listening to a tape the word but when i
[1:04:22] listen to it with you it makes me feel
[1:04:25] part of something that's greater
[1:04:27] than than anything so god bless you uh
[1:04:30] this evening as we enjoy
[1:04:32] god's word thank you
[1:04:36] the quickness power wasn't only in their
[1:04:39] soul but it was all over them
[1:04:43] and not only the dynamics come into
[1:04:45] quicken but it quickened the mechanics
[1:04:48] you see what i mean they were so quick
[1:04:50] and until their tongues began to speak
[1:04:52] in another language
[1:04:54] they were so quickened by the power of
[1:04:56] the resurrection of christ until they
[1:04:59] laid their hands
[1:05:01] they were so quick and with quickening
[1:05:03] power to when they laid their hands up
[1:05:04] on the stick they got well
[1:05:07] they're quickened your mortal body man
[1:05:11] they were healed by laying on their
[1:05:12] hands
[1:05:14] and the spirit clicking their
[1:05:15] fellowships together with god so they
[1:05:18] also were so quick and into the presence
[1:05:20] of god until when a person died and
[1:05:23] their soul and goal it called him back
[1:05:24] to life
[1:05:28] sorry
[1:05:29] i'm feeling religious
[1:05:31] that's right
[1:05:34] not only was his resurrection for
[1:05:36] himself
[1:05:38] but
[1:05:39] whosoever will
[1:05:41] to this predestinated season that the
[1:05:44] men are quickened christians are more
[1:05:46] about they lay hands on the sick they
[1:05:48] recover they prayed in the spirit of
[1:05:50] salvation call the dead back to life
[1:05:54] that's right
[1:05:55] quicken their immortal body and if it
[1:05:58] comes into you if it be so
[1:06:01] now you can say it so
[1:06:02] but if it be so these signs follow them
[1:06:05] it quickens your mortal body it'll
[1:06:08] quicken you now notice it put them into
[1:06:11] the presence of god why it was the
[1:06:14] spirit of god that raised up jesus from
[1:06:15] the grave
[1:06:16] and the spirit of god are given that
[1:06:19] eternal life comes from the greek word
[1:06:20] if you look up zoe which moves it
[1:06:23] through you
[1:06:24] and then quickens their even their mind
[1:06:31] how can you say that that spirit dwells
[1:06:34] in you
[1:06:36] though you've done everything that you
[1:06:38] thought was right here's your evidence
[1:06:40] when you got it or not
[1:06:42] if the spirit
[1:06:44] that was in christ is in you
[1:06:47] it also
[1:06:49] quickens you to the word
[1:06:51] for he is the word
[1:06:53] and if it contrary quickens you away
[1:06:55] from the word then it isn't the spirit
[1:06:57] of
[1:06:58] christ sure what you've done
[1:07:02] until that moves you in the word my
[1:07:04] sheep hear my voice and they shall live
[1:07:06] by every word
[1:07:09] every word i was talking about today
[1:07:12] my own mother
[1:07:13] she's going on now
[1:07:15] and she was a very odd woman
[1:07:17] and she was you know about
[1:07:19] the indian and she was um but in there
[1:07:22] she was a person who didn't dream
[1:07:24] but i don't think she don't have four or
[1:07:25] five dreams all of her life but every
[1:07:27] time she dreamed the dream
[1:07:29] it was true
[1:07:31] she had a dream it was true
[1:07:33] i remember one time i first started
[1:07:34] preaching many years ago we're living
[1:07:36] right up here on the road right just
[1:07:37] above yours
[1:07:39] i was preaching higher this church
[1:07:41] she dreamed the dream that i was
[1:07:42] standing
[1:07:43] here by the side of a three step
[1:07:47] and i was standing preaching to
[1:07:48] everybody that they must walk up these
[1:07:50] three steps
[1:07:52] before they hit the highway
[1:07:54] and on the highways a little
[1:07:56] pearly likes white line run right into
[1:07:59] the
[1:08:00] the doors of heaven to the pearly gates
[1:08:02] and that pearl had been stretched out to
[1:08:04] the top of these steps
[1:08:05] if that ain't my message exactly today
[1:08:07] justification of sanctification
[1:08:10] and i was saying that a person has to
[1:08:13] come by these three steps to be able to
[1:08:15] walk that highway
[1:08:16] and said that there was a lady came by
[1:08:18] now you know what kind of shoes people
[1:08:20] wore 35 years ago
[1:08:22] was the lady come by i have a great big
[1:08:24] pair of the occasion to wear today spike
[1:08:25] your shoes
[1:08:27] and she come by and i said wait my
[1:08:29] sister you can't walk that highway there
[1:08:32] and i said you you can't be here
[1:08:34] and she said
[1:08:36] she said
[1:08:41] i'll show you i can be justified
[1:08:42] sanctified and deal with the holy ghost
[1:08:44] still walking
[1:08:45] and she i just let her go couldn't do
[1:08:47] more about it couldn't stop her and she
[1:08:48] jumped up on the highway to look back
[1:08:50] the sister said yeah i told you she
[1:08:51] started to run up and she you know what
[1:08:53] the bible says in isaiah fifth chapter
[1:08:55] that it has outstretched necks
[1:08:58] they have to pitch over see
[1:09:02] missing as you have to accurate
[1:09:05] missing as you go making a tinkling with
[1:09:07] her heels
[1:09:08] the daughter's design in the last thing
[1:09:10] and she started up that highway just as
[1:09:12] hard as she could run and eduardo bro
[1:09:14] got narrow in there she started reeling
[1:09:16] missing like that and off she
[1:09:19] mother said the harvest scream that i
[1:09:21] ever heard in my life was that woman
[1:09:22] falling into those flames and smoke
[1:09:24] going down down like that i turn around
[1:09:26] said see
[1:09:28] she just obeyed everything but one word
[1:09:34] everything but one word sure then it
[1:09:36] costs the women can be saved sanctified
[1:09:38] and deal with the holy ghost
[1:09:40] and then faith
[1:09:44] man shall not live up read along but by
[1:09:45] every word
[1:09:48] and she failed and i said see she went
[1:09:51] on in all right but she she failed to
[1:09:53] listen
[1:09:55] tell her what was ahead
[1:09:57] and he's wrote the gospel by the
[1:09:59] disciples apostles and doctrine
[1:10:00] doctrines apostles and prophets and so
[1:10:03] forth and
[1:10:05] they won't listen now lord this
[1:10:06] quickening power is zoning
[1:10:08] bringing the word the mind that was in
[1:10:11] christ
[1:10:12] within you then
[1:10:14] i'm trying to show you that you when you
[1:10:18] uh
[1:10:19] raised when god raised jesus from the
[1:10:21] dead he raised up you also
[1:10:24] and also quickened your life with him
[1:10:27] you are now quick in the life although
[1:10:29] banned you were but an attribute in his
[1:10:32] thoughts
[1:10:33] but god had saw all in him at the finish
[1:10:38] see when god looked down upon the body
[1:10:40] the spirit left him in the garden
[1:10:41] against him and he had to die a man
[1:10:43] remember friends he didn't have to do
[1:10:45] that
[1:10:47] that was god
[1:10:49] god anointed that flesh which is human
[1:10:51] flesh
[1:10:52] and he didn't if he went up there as god
[1:10:54] he never died that kind of death thank
[1:10:56] kill god but he didn't have to do it but
[1:11:00] remember he
[1:11:02] went there with you in him
[1:11:06] see
[1:11:08] god had never separated the bride
[1:11:10] from the groom yet
[1:11:13] so when god looked down upon the body of
[1:11:16] christ he saw both male and female
[1:11:19] it was all redeeming that one body
[1:11:22] see
[1:11:24] they are one
[1:11:26] same same word
[1:11:28] the same word spoke of the groom speaks
[1:11:30] to the rhyme
[1:11:31] well how can the bride come and fail to
[1:11:33] manifest everything was promised of him
[1:11:36] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[1:11:37] the bride
[1:11:38] but when he did everything even to prove
[1:11:40] it by raising himself up from the dead
[1:11:43] afterwards
[1:11:44] that don't the group the bride has to do
[1:11:46] the same thing has to be exactly what
[1:11:48] the word said should be in these last
[1:11:49] days
[1:11:50] don't you have to return to knowledge
[1:11:52] before don't you have to be manifested
[1:11:54] like what's the days of sodom don't the
[1:11:55] world have to be just exactly like it is
[1:11:58] isn't these things a perfect
[1:11:59] identification of the word of god made
[1:12:02] known to us my friends
[1:12:04] i know i'm keeping a long time 15
[1:12:06] minutes just so dinner but maybe i'll
[1:12:07] get super damn but notice looky here
[1:12:10] what a perfect thing it is i don't know
[1:12:12] when to sing against me look notice it
[1:12:15] but god foresaw
[1:12:17] the bride
[1:12:19] in the room
[1:12:22] hallelujah
[1:12:24] see to save his wife like adam
[1:12:26] he had to go with her
[1:12:29] i didn't know what he was doing
[1:12:31] he didn't know what she was doing
[1:12:33] but adam walked out with his wife
[1:12:35] see and jesus took his wife's place
[1:12:39] and became sin for her remember he
[1:12:42] became you he stood your punishment
[1:12:46] that you might stand in his place he
[1:12:49] stood in your place
[1:12:50] that you might stand in his place
[1:12:53] what a love
[1:12:55] what a fellowship how can we unite how
[1:12:57] can we do anything but love him friends
[1:12:59] uh she could stay on ours but let's move
[1:13:01] on apart
[1:13:03] like
[1:13:04] uh the pentecostal experience today and
[1:13:07] the coming of the holy ghost in this
[1:13:09] last days as promised is like the
[1:13:11] abstract
[1:13:13] to a title these
[1:13:15] see
[1:13:16] now you can get a title sure
[1:13:19] okay you can get a title to a place but
[1:13:21] that's still gonna say it's yours
[1:13:23] no sir somebody way back energy come in
[1:13:26] and put a claim on it
[1:13:27] but when you get an abstract
[1:13:32] shows that everything is ever against it
[1:13:34] is struck off
[1:13:36] coming back from the foundation is that
[1:13:37] right
[1:13:38] and when a man
[1:13:40] has said that he believes the word
[1:13:43] and then when the holy spirit comes it
[1:13:46] is the abstract to the title
[1:13:49] and that gives you permission when you
[1:13:50] have that abstract then every bit of
[1:13:53] that belongs to you and everything's on
[1:13:55] it belongs to you
[1:13:58] hey and that gives us the abstract when
[1:14:03] the holy ghost comes upon this titled
[1:14:05] eve
[1:14:06] that god saw by god for the foundation
[1:14:09] of the world and put a name on the book
[1:14:11] of life but was born to a man and woman
[1:14:13] and subject to sin and guilty of sin
[1:14:16] but when i believed on it i received the
[1:14:19] deed but when the holy ghost come it was
[1:14:22] the abstract
[1:14:24] that everything against me whether my
[1:14:26] mother done it my father done it my
[1:14:28] grandmother done it like a little
[1:14:30] epileptic childhood prayed for a few
[1:14:31] minutes ago to come to you from the
[1:14:33] grandparents therefore if she fell down
[1:14:35] and upon the child i said but when the
[1:14:38] abstract has come
[1:14:40] it struck off omitted everything
[1:14:44] i'm uh
[1:14:45] abstract foreign

[1:14:50] and as sure as the spirit that raised
[1:14:53] christ from the dead i have an abstract
[1:14:55] deed that i'm part of that body with the
[1:14:58] abstract of the holy ghost making that
[1:15:01] body of word lit up just exactly like it
[1:15:03] did in him

[1:15:07] the abstract
[1:15:08] all my sins are struck out all your sins
[1:15:11] are structured
[1:15:12] by the blood of jesus christ and the
[1:15:14] holy ghost has come as an abstract to
[1:15:18] the title deed that god give me by grace
[1:15:20] by foreign

[1:15:30] and i'm alive forevermore had the keys
[1:15:32] of death and hell

[1:20:29] he had a testimony that i haven't one
[1:20:31] time failed his word
[1:20:33] he got the full of the quickness power
[1:20:36] when the dynamics hit him on that
[1:20:37] mechanic he didn't even have to die he

[1:21:09] to do i've done it and become so full of
[1:21:12] dynamics or or mechanics until when the
[1:21:15] quickening power struck in the mechanics
[1:21:17] it inflicted him right up he walked on

[1:26:32] if you'd read matthew i've got a
[1:26:33] scripture matthew 27 51 you can write
[1:26:36] part down
[1:26:37] when all those back there
[1:26:40] that believed that he would come
[1:26:42] the bible said here after he come they
[1:26:45] were sleeping in the ground
[1:26:47] quickening powers up on and they were
[1:26:49] part of him than satan
[1:26:51] they were part of him because they
[1:26:53] believed on him potentially they had
[1:26:55] that life through the sacrifice of a
[1:26:58] sheep of propitiation which could never
[1:27:01] bring spirit of sheep back up on the man
[1:27:03] how about now with the spirit of the man
[1:27:04] got himself up on this earth
[1:27:06] how much more quickly power do we have
[1:27:09] but through the propitiation our sin was
[1:27:12] offered a lamb and type
[1:27:15] what we have is not the type that's the
[1:27:17] antitype
[1:27:19] what are we scared about
[1:27:22] and those fellows who only had a tight
[1:27:24] party to his resurrection and went down
[1:27:27] into the grave with it and job back
[1:27:29] there under his great stream ah
[1:27:33] everything tucked away from him the
[1:27:34] devil said let me have him i'll make him
[1:27:36] curse you to your face
[1:27:38] and then he broke through he said don't
[1:27:39] you think his lies and he said he all
[1:27:42] but take his life and his wife even
[1:27:44] turned against him set her breath and
[1:27:46] become strange to him in other words you
[1:27:48] should have nothing to do with it she
[1:27:49] doesn't seem to love him anymore just
[1:27:51] pushed him away job you're miserable
[1:27:53] watching his cursed god and i said you
[1:27:54] talk like a spiritual
[1:27:57] oh
[1:27:58] he held right to what he had now he's a
[1:28:00] prophet
[1:28:01] he said i am not a sinner
[1:28:04] i have offered the provided sacrifice
[1:28:08] amen he knew where he was standing he
[1:28:11] was on the word no matter what the other
[1:28:13] says is right there at the word then
[1:28:15] that great tremendous hour says you
[1:28:17] speak like a preacher it says the lord
[1:28:20] gave the lord taken away while blessed
[1:28:22] be the name of the lord said i come in
[1:28:24] this world without anything i'll come
[1:28:26] here and drink it go out the same way
[1:28:28] blessed be the name of the lord that
[1:28:30] night broke out and falls as kids stated
[1:28:32] poverty stricken and us friends all
[1:28:34] turned against these church members
[1:28:36] everything else scraping himself was a
[1:28:38] and what a miserable wretched
[1:28:41] still he helped in that word he was an
[1:28:44] eagle
[1:28:45] oh my you can't keep the film over his
[1:28:46] eyes all the time
[1:28:48] no no
[1:28:49] all it was standing on that word
[1:28:52] what happened the sky shield back
[1:28:55] the thunder is beginning to roar
[1:28:57] the lightning began to flash and job
[1:28:59] looked up at salvation said i know my
[1:29:01] regime were living
[1:29:03] in the last days he'll stand up on this
[1:29:05] earth and go after the skin worms has
[1:29:07] destroyed this body bones and all that
[1:29:09] quickness
[1:29:11] will be there
[1:29:12] i'll see god for myself whom i shall see
[1:29:15] for myself my eyes shall behold and not
[1:29:17] another is that right
[1:29:19] go after my reigns be consumed within me
[1:29:22] though answer the skin worms that's in
[1:29:24] my body now will destroy it you know
[1:29:27] skin worms don't come to you that worms
[1:29:28] already in you
[1:29:30] your own skin once you realize that
[1:29:32] put you in a coffin and put it air tight
[1:29:34] the bugs are eating up just the same
[1:29:36] because they're in you
[1:29:37] you are just a bunch of bugs to begin
[1:29:39] with on the inside though the skin worm
[1:29:42] my skin worms destroys me my flesh yet
[1:29:45] in my flesh i'll see god
[1:29:48] and on that resurrection morning
[1:29:51] all right
[1:29:53] hallelujah
[1:29:54] matthew
[1:29:56] this great writer of 2751
[1:30:00] said after he is resurrected from the
[1:30:02] dead
[1:30:03] that the old testament sanctions
[1:30:07] many of those that slept in the dust the
[1:30:09] earth comes up
[1:30:12] and entered into the city and appeared
[1:30:15] that quickening power
[1:30:17] still on the bones of elijah when there
[1:30:19] wasn't no more bones
[1:30:21] still on job but he won the spoonful of
[1:30:22] dust that's in his body but the quickest
[1:30:24] power was still there
[1:30:26] if this
[1:30:28] spirit that raised up jesus from the
[1:30:30] dead dwelling he'll also quicken your
[1:30:32] mortal body don't just quickly now say
[1:30:35] oh i wish i lived back you're living a
[1:30:36] better time
[1:30:38] now if you all i see you're putting out
[1:30:39] in scripture all right put it on first
[1:30:41] thessalonians 4 16
[1:30:43] notice
[1:30:45] how beautiful see
[1:30:47] in the
[1:30:48] the saints
[1:30:51] then that sleep in christ will god bring
[1:30:53] with you see saints in the grave
[1:30:56] resting like elijah
[1:30:59] some like elisha was see
[1:31:02] some of them be quickened some will be
[1:31:04] taken some will be in the grave they
[1:31:06] will go with it the trumpet of god shall
[1:31:08] sound
[1:31:10] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:31:13] and we which arrive and remain
[1:31:15] shall be caught up together with them to
[1:31:17] meet the lord in the air
[1:31:19] the quickly power on the living the
[1:31:20] quicken power on the dead
[1:31:22] see that same quickness power of god
[1:31:25] presented in both of these prophets look
[1:31:27] at their names are almost the same
[1:31:30] elisha
[1:31:32] elijah
[1:31:35] see the pride in the group
[1:31:42] one of them is mr jesus killing his
[1:31:44] history
[1:31:46] almost the same
[1:31:49] between
[1:31:51] he and she
[1:31:52] elijah and look how's representing here
[1:31:55] now elisha was taken up in the rapture
[1:31:58] represents the church
[1:32:00] or elijah and elisha
[1:32:04] rested until the resurrection
[1:32:06] see it's just like a bird needs two
[1:32:08] wings to balance itself
[1:32:10] the church was represented right there
[1:32:12] in those two prophets for we which alive
[1:32:14] and remain to the coming lord shall not
[1:32:16] hinder them which are seen for the
[1:32:18] trumpet of god shall sound both wings
[1:32:20] shall come against you
[1:32:21] and we will fly away
[1:32:24] fly away because what in the living are
[1:32:26] dead that
[1:32:28] quicken power still is
[1:32:35] it just gets better
[1:32:39] but you know
[1:32:40] if if we keep getting on it getting
[1:32:43] better and better there will be less and
[1:32:45] less of us
[1:32:48] hey amen
[1:32:50] amen isn't that good
[1:32:52] i mean
[1:32:55] it is a one in a million
[1:32:58] you know remember it gets narrower and
[1:33:00] narrower
[1:33:01] but you know there's a a few little
[1:33:03] things that
[1:33:05] uh that stood out to me and i know if we
[1:33:08] had to have fellowship there's a lot of
[1:33:10] things that
[1:33:11] that stood out to you but
[1:33:13] you know how that we surely pamper
[1:33:16] ourselves huh and didn't you like that
[1:33:19] you know the skin worms don't come to
[1:33:21] you the worm is already in you
[1:33:24] your own skin worms did you ever notice
[1:33:27] that
[1:33:29] put you in a coffin
[1:33:31] and put it airtight the bugs will eat
[1:33:33] you up just the same because
[1:33:37] they're in you
[1:33:39] you are just a bunch of bugs to begin
[1:33:42] with on the inside what what you know
[1:33:46] what a reminder
[1:33:48] you know what i mean we worry about this
[1:33:50] but if this earthly body be destroyed we
[1:33:53] have one waiting for us you know this
[1:33:56] corruptible will put on incorruption and
[1:34:00] you can't escape the corruption
[1:34:02] okay it's it's in you you know but what
[1:34:04] a wonderful
[1:34:06] uh what a wonderful statement i i just
[1:34:08] thought that was and i liked a couple of
[1:34:11] these other little statements we won't
[1:34:13] keep you along tonight
[1:34:15] at all but i
[1:34:17] i thought uh
[1:34:20] it was pretty wonderful
[1:34:22] he said in obedience this is paragraph
[1:34:24] 259 he said in obedience to god if you
[1:34:27] have never been baptized in the name of
[1:34:30] jesus christ do it
[1:34:33] and watch the quickening power pick you
[1:34:36] up then
[1:34:38] amen isn't that exactly what the word
[1:34:40] said he said if you were baptized the
[1:34:42] name though that you shall
[1:34:45] you know what i mean that god's eternal
[1:34:47] you're the only one that dealings with
[1:34:50] months and days and everything a
[1:34:52] thousand years is this close to god a
[1:34:55] thousand years is but a day
[1:34:58] you know what i mean it's just
[1:34:59] nothing you know
[1:35:01] we just say oh i've been going so long
[1:35:03] and so long you're not out of god's mind
[1:35:06] and remember you're eternal
[1:35:09] so god's got eternity
[1:35:13] to finish it
[1:35:15] you know we think well if you don't have
[1:35:17] it done by september you know 28th i'm
[1:35:21] doomed don't
[1:35:22] no that that don't even exist
[1:35:25] in him
[1:35:26] it's already finished
[1:35:28] he already saw the finished
[1:35:31] work
[1:35:32] amen so we're already sitting in
[1:35:35] heavenly places
[1:35:37] that's when when that said we we try to
[1:35:40] say well we've already sitting there and
[1:35:42] you look at yourself says i don't feel
[1:35:43] like i'm sitting in heaven well that's
[1:35:45] just like he said let there be light
[1:35:49] the light's there
[1:35:51] so he's already spoken you of being
[1:35:54] sitting in heavenly places however he
[1:35:56] chooses to manifest that that's what
[1:35:59] makes him
[1:36:00] sovereign he says oh church of the
[1:36:02] living god
[1:36:03] paragraph 261
[1:36:06] we can't stand around here on little
[1:36:10] sugar tits that are
[1:36:12] nursing around here today we've got to
[1:36:16] be
[1:36:16] full
[1:36:17] and prayed up
[1:36:19] with kicking power
[1:36:21] until the quickening of the holy ghost
[1:36:24] we've got to be caught away someday in
[1:36:27] that rapture yonder yes sir amen oh my
[1:36:33] amen so you just you know what you've
[1:36:35] got you've got a
[1:36:38] realize you understand we got to realize
[1:36:40] that something now is being offered to
[1:36:44] us
[1:36:46] through
[1:36:48] the word
[1:36:50] that was stored up
[1:36:53] okay so you you can approach the
[1:36:56] storehouse as being something that's
[1:36:58] already been spoken and already been
[1:37:01] done
[1:37:02] because you got to remember everything
[1:37:05] that jesus manifested was stored up
[1:37:10] it was all prophesied
[1:37:12] and it was all stored up and that's why
[1:37:15] he said search the scriptures
[1:37:18] for they are which testify of me
[1:37:21] i have not let one jot one tittle one
[1:37:23] prophecy unfulfilled
[1:37:26] go look at it they speak of me i've done
[1:37:28] everything that was prophesied of me to
[1:37:32] do
[1:37:34] and and if that was
[1:37:37] true
[1:37:39] for him
[1:37:41] then it's got to be true for you
[1:37:44] the same scriptures that spoke of the
[1:37:46] groom spoke of the bride
[1:37:49] you understand so what did jesus do he
[1:37:52] went into that room at 12 years old
[1:37:56] and sat down with those scribes because
[1:38:00] he didn't want their interpretation
[1:38:03] he was looking where did it say this and
[1:38:06] where did it say that i i i can see him
[1:38:09] sitting there but where did it talk
[1:38:12] about
[1:38:13] bethlehem
[1:38:17] right and so they said bethlehem right
[1:38:19] here a star david out of bethlehem
[1:38:22] he said where did it speak of nazareth
[1:38:25] you see where did it speak of egypt
[1:38:27] where did it speak of this where did it
[1:38:29] speak of that so if you go to proving
[1:38:32] his word he says that he went and
[1:38:34] searched the scriptures and saw
[1:38:36] everything that the scripture spoke of
[1:38:39] him and he believed it he identified
[1:38:43] with it
[1:38:45] so god did it the same way
[1:38:47] he received the word
[1:38:50] as a man
[1:38:52] and that could let him know that he had
[1:38:55] that eternal identity with him
[1:38:59] see satan that's why satan wants a
[1:39:02] trinity
[1:39:04] because if he can make him a third
[1:39:07] a second person then that's something
[1:39:10] you can never obtain
[1:39:17] but you were in him
[1:39:20] eve was in adam but she wasn't separated
[1:39:23] if god ever did one thing one way he's
[1:39:27] got to do it again so we were in christ
[1:39:30] but we weren't separated
[1:39:33] so now we're being separated out right
[1:39:35] we're beginning we're coming and what
[1:39:37] are we
[1:39:38] doing we're hearing everything that was
[1:39:42] prophesied of us
[1:39:44] coming and that's what he said aren't we
[1:39:46] seeing it today didn't the world have to
[1:39:49] be this way didn't this have to come
[1:39:51] through malachi 4 5 i will restore saith
[1:39:55] the lord so it's all right there for us
[1:39:58] but
[1:39:59] it's it's not a workup
[1:40:05] it is solid
[1:40:07] and
[1:40:08] as straightforward and as down to earth
[1:40:11] and as real as it can be
[1:40:14] amen
[1:40:16] i'm telling you you just come to a place
[1:40:18] one day you're tired of yourself
[1:40:23] you just don't want to be what you are
[1:40:26] you want to be him
[1:40:28] you want to be like him you're you're
[1:40:30] crying to be him you want to be
[1:40:32] different you find yourself hungering
[1:40:35] and thirsting after righteousness it
[1:40:38] just it's burning in your heart
[1:40:41] lord i can't go on like this i've been
[1:40:43] in and out and up and down all my life
[1:40:47] i'm i'm tired of i'm done with it i i'm
[1:40:51] surrendering all
[1:40:53] i'm laying here i'm going to believe it
[1:40:55] i'm going to follow it i'm going to walk
[1:40:58] with it
[1:40:59] this is what i want
[1:41:03] the question's gone
[1:41:06] where can we go lord
[1:41:08] doubt alone hath eternal life
[1:41:13] you know he talked about the eagle he
[1:41:15] said he don't
[1:41:17] her around
[1:41:18] he don't run after this meal and that
[1:41:20] meal he's he's after fresh manna
[1:41:23] and i'll tell you
[1:41:26] there's
[1:41:27] more fresh manna
[1:41:30] i've been reading this for 50 years
[1:41:33] come on
[1:41:35] think of it
[1:41:37] how many in here are over 50.
[1:41:41] why about five six of you
[1:41:46] i've been reading this message longer
[1:41:49] than 95 of you've been born
[1:41:56] over and over again and let me tell you
[1:41:58] something it's richer today than it's
[1:42:02] ever been
[1:42:03] [Music]
[1:42:06] i've read the bible but you know
[1:42:08] something i was promised it would become
[1:42:11] a new book
[1:42:14] okay and so many people are reading an
[1:42:16] old book
[1:42:20] because it's all been hid but brother in
[1:42:22] the next little party talks about the
[1:42:24] quickening power in our day and the
[1:42:26] seven seals and it's it's good
[1:42:29] but we'd be here until midnight
[1:42:32] okay and and and so it it it is just
[1:42:36] marvelous this is so rich and and so it
[1:42:39] it
[1:42:40] when we understand that
[1:42:42] that so people are scared you know
[1:42:46] they keep wanting to get people to get
[1:42:48] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:42:50] and he already told you what the
[1:42:52] evidence of it is that's
[1:42:54] right it isn't a sensation
[1:43:00] but this is
[1:43:01] beyond
[1:43:05] you know it's like
[1:43:07] getting a
[1:43:08] a house you know
[1:43:10] it's like i grew up in my mom's house
[1:43:14] you know my mom and dad's house i grew
[1:43:16] up there and everything i go there i
[1:43:18] call it my house i go to my room i sleep
[1:43:20] in my room i can come and go it's my
[1:43:23] house right but one day
[1:43:25] i'm going to take possession
[1:43:27] of that house
[1:43:29] not me alone you know
[1:43:32] but
[1:43:33] my other siblings you know what i mean
[1:43:36] and then then we can all fuss and fight
[1:43:38] over everything i i'm glad i'm where i'm
[1:43:40] at right now
[1:43:42] you know i think i don't want any of it
[1:43:45] you know what i mean you guys take the
[1:43:47] stuff
[1:43:48] i don't need more stuff i'd like this
[1:43:50] picture i'd like that picture you know
[1:43:53] but other than i have at it
[1:43:55] you know
[1:43:58] but it it becomes yours
[1:44:01] and that's what's so beautiful and so if
[1:44:04] he just he's talking about these stuff
[1:44:08] you know he and he he talks about
[1:44:12] he says
[1:44:14] uh
[1:44:16] he says there's no strength in that
[1:44:21] he says now
[1:44:23] we are trying
[1:44:24] we are tired
[1:44:26] of such stuff as that
[1:44:29] paragraph
[1:44:30] 263 we are tired as such stuff as that
[1:44:36] do you understand
[1:44:38] when you be when you become part of this
[1:44:41] you can when prophet god says we're
[1:44:42] tired of stuff like that he said you put
[1:44:45] yourself right in there i'm tired of all
[1:44:48] this baby
[1:44:50] you know and all this pacifying i'm
[1:44:53] tired of always having to be petted and
[1:44:57] and pampered and put in the hot house
[1:45:00] you know i'm tired of having to run to
[1:45:03] the all turk every service i want to
[1:45:06] rise up i want to be strong i'm tired of
[1:45:10] stuff like that well
[1:45:12] that's the very sentiment
[1:45:15] that's in our heart
[1:45:17] because this word has got to come to
[1:45:20] pass somewhere
[1:45:22] because everything that was spoken of
[1:45:24] him has spoken of you
[1:45:26] he said
[1:45:28] he says get back
[1:45:32] your
[1:45:33] eagles
[1:45:34] back to the word of god
[1:45:37] be burly
[1:45:43] in other words don't be weak
[1:45:46] and sickly
[1:45:48] you know
[1:45:51] there's a timidness a meekness is not
[1:45:54] not a timidness in the shyness you can
[1:45:57] be strong and bold as a rock and still
[1:46:00] be meek
[1:46:02] that's in other words being meek means
[1:46:04] you consider the other person's weakness
[1:46:07] you consider their problems you take
[1:46:09] into consideration they don't know what
[1:46:11] you
[1:46:12] know they don't have what you have
[1:46:14] you're not a bully
[1:46:17] you know a lot of people who use the
[1:46:19] gospel they like to bully people
[1:46:22] with the gospel they don't want to give
[1:46:23] anybody credit for having you talking
[1:46:26] with somebody that wants to talk to you
[1:46:28] about god they want to talk to you about
[1:46:30] god because they got a hunger for god
[1:46:33] you know what i mean don't try to blast
[1:46:35] everything they got
[1:46:37] and just tear them down like they don't
[1:46:39] got nothing
[1:46:40] you know what they'll know right quick
[1:46:42] they don't know you ain't got nothing
[1:46:44] they aren't going to want what you've
[1:46:46] got
[1:46:49] anyway
[1:46:50] so jeff agrees with that
[1:46:54] he said be burly
[1:46:56] nothing can hurt your feelings
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:06] come on wouldn't don't you want that
[1:47:10] my goodness i got more feelings than i
[1:47:13] can stand
[1:47:16] everything offends me everything in this
[1:47:18] feeling feeling this just saying
[1:47:19] something feelings that he
[1:47:22] feels he leaves

[1:47:55] break my bones but names will
[1:47:58] never hurt me
[1:48:00] you know and then you say a bunch of
[1:48:02] ugly things about the person
[1:48:06] because you wanted to what
[1:48:08] hurt your feelings
[1:48:11] nothing can hurt your feelings
[1:48:13] therefore you're free
[1:48:15] from all the scandals of man

[1:48:42] it brings more love
[1:48:44] and more quickening power
[1:48:47] wouldn't that be different if you just
[1:48:49] couldn't wait for somebody to criticize
[1:48:51] you
[1:48:53] please come say something bad about me
[1:48:56] i'm going to get more love and more
[1:48:58] quickening power

[1:49:04] lovely way to live
[1:49:06] oh amen
[1:49:10] brings more love amen and quickening
[1:49:13] power caught away into the heavenlies

[1:49:19] done flew above
[1:49:22] the chickens
[1:49:23] way up yonder in the heavenly places in
[1:49:27] christ jesus
[1:49:30] oh
[1:49:31] amen
[1:49:32] and then 265 that same quickening power
[1:49:36] that we have right now see
[1:49:39] it will quicken your mortal bodies isn't
[1:49:41] that right it's the quickening power he
[1:49:44] talked about philip so he's talking
[1:49:46] about all these people that
[1:49:49] this spirit
[1:49:50] moved on them
[1:49:53] well
[1:49:56] it ought to create in us we we don't
[1:49:58] want a duplicate of their actions
[1:50:04] you see that's what that that what do
[1:50:06] they call that cloning
[1:50:08] or copying
[1:50:11] i don't want to be
[1:50:13] caught away some someplace because i
[1:50:16] don't need an evidence
[1:50:19] you understand what i'm saying i don't
[1:50:21] need an evidence i don't have to speak
[1:50:23] in tongues to know that i have the
[1:50:24] spirit i don't have to
[1:50:27] i don't have to be caught someplace up i
[1:50:30] don't have to be stoned like stephen i
[1:50:32] don't have to be that but what i want is
[1:50:36] i want what he wants for me
[1:50:39] how do you want to quicken me how do you
[1:50:42] want to use me
[1:50:43] that that's what i'm hungry for i i
[1:50:46] don't need to read this book i don't
[1:50:48] need to go build an
[1:50:50] ark as we shared at the brothers
[1:50:53] breakfast then we got the ark
[1:50:58] we've just got to get in it
[1:51:01] it'll take us it comes through malachi
[1:51:04] for
[1:51:07] amen so
[1:51:08] that same thing so
[1:51:10] so many times we look back and we say
[1:51:13] i'm looking for this
[1:51:16] well
[1:51:16] that was for then and and we we know
[1:51:19] that message won't work today
[1:51:22] in other words we want a power that
[1:51:25] works in the circumstances that war
[1:51:28] we're in
[1:51:33] i don't know if the people in the days
[1:51:36] of luther could have handled today
[1:51:39] but you were created to handle it
[1:51:43] he put you here in this age because he
[1:51:46] elected you to be here
[1:51:49] you were chosen to hear this
[1:51:52] and manifest this they all
[1:51:54] wanted to live in this age
[1:51:59] because they knew that this age was the
[1:52:02] age that the abstract would be returned
[1:52:05] back to the opening of the seals
[1:52:08] he said it's this same thing and then
[1:52:11] we'll just
[1:52:13] look over here paragraph 269.
[1:52:17] talking about elijah and he just gave us
[1:52:19] the types of the old and the new and the
[1:52:22] same quickening power that's on the dead
[1:52:24] so aren't you glad you don't lose that
[1:52:26] quickening power so even if if you step
[1:52:30] out of this body
[1:52:32] you're just in that resting place
[1:52:35] because they they can't be made perfect
[1:52:37] without
[1:52:39] you
[1:52:40] it takes both sides to fly the
[1:52:43] bird so to speak
[1:52:46] i like it
[1:52:48] he says now that
[1:52:50] fellow picked up
[1:52:52] that robe
[1:52:53] a type of the church again
[1:52:56] see picking up the robe
[1:52:59] now he done twice the miracles
[1:53:03] which is a type of christ and the church
[1:53:06] see
[1:53:07] greater work shall you do than these
[1:53:10] because i go to the father
[1:53:13] he didn't mean greater as in more
[1:53:15] powerful
[1:53:16] but he meant greater in greater number
[1:53:20] of manifestation
[1:53:22] you know and he said
[1:53:24] elijah done four he done eight see
[1:53:28] how he was a double doubled the power
[1:53:32] because
[1:53:33] he
[1:53:34] asked
[1:53:35] for it
[1:53:41] you know
[1:53:44] when when you listen to life's story
[1:53:47] and and you listen to the prophet of god
[1:53:50] in all that he went through and all that
[1:53:53] he suffered
[1:53:54] when it all come and done
[1:53:58] what he asked god was that he could
[1:54:00] serve him with his whole life
[1:54:04] all he wanted to do
[1:54:05] was give his whole life
[1:54:08] you know i i don't know what i would
[1:54:11] have done i i thank god that i wasn't
[1:54:14] put through what he was put through but
[1:54:16] i know one thing that he'll put nothing
[1:54:18] upon us that we can't bear
[1:54:20] i just want to be able to bear what he's
[1:54:23] put
[1:54:24] on me with graciousness
[1:54:27] like job
[1:54:28] i don't want to sit on a
[1:54:30] on a dung heap
[1:54:32] with a bunch of boils
[1:54:35] with leslie sitting there telling me how
[1:54:37] stupid i am
[1:54:43] i mean it you know i i don't want to say
[1:54:46] i'm a job
[1:54:48] i don't want to be a job
[1:54:50] i just want the good part
[1:54:56] you know but god made him to suffer that
[1:55:00] and he put it in him he's not going to
[1:55:02] put upon anything upon you
[1:55:04] if you bear if your mind is on his mind
[1:55:08] and you let this mind be in you he will
[1:55:11] take you through whatever comes upon you
[1:55:16] you know i i i don't need to be anything
[1:55:19] else than what
[1:55:21] i am
[1:55:22] just let me be a good what i am
[1:55:27] be the best christian i can be
[1:55:29] nobody can take your place
[1:55:32] you know i just think about that great
[1:55:34] symphony orchestra you know we have
[1:55:37] people that
[1:55:38] that play instruments and things and and
[1:55:41] they're not playing anybody else's part
[1:55:44] but they're apart
[1:55:47] you know and and i like the symphony i
[1:55:49] like to go to the symphony
[1:55:51] i i just enjoy it so much i don't know a
[1:55:54] thing about music
[1:55:56] you know what i mean i don't know why
[1:55:57] that guy's standing there swirling that
[1:55:59] stick around
[1:56:00] but i guess it has some sort of meaning
[1:56:03] but i enjoy it and what i marvel at is
[1:56:06] one guy sat down
[1:56:08] and wrote that music for every single
[1:56:12] one of those instruments and
[1:56:15] understood
[1:56:16] that when it all came together it would
[1:56:18] sound
[1:56:19] like this you know
[1:56:21] and i had
[1:56:23] two friends that were
[1:56:25] just you know concert pianist and
[1:56:28] they were friends with rubenstein the
[1:56:30] great
[1:56:32] jewish composer and conductor and on the
[1:56:35] dumb was a mud fence when it comes to
[1:56:37] music
[1:56:38] you know and i mean i remember one day i
[1:56:40] looked at the piano player and i said f
[1:56:43] and everybody started laughing because
[1:56:45] they know i don't know what f is
[1:56:49] just a letter in the alphabet you know
[1:56:52] i got a lot of them in school that's why
[1:56:54] i took that letter i was familiar with
[1:56:57] it
[1:56:59] but
[1:57:00] it
[1:57:01] all they do is they play their part
[1:57:04] and they play their part when it's their
[1:57:06] turn to play the part
[1:57:09] now could you imagine some guy running
[1:57:12] around in the orchestra and and all of a
[1:57:14] sudden somebody's praying he comes
[1:57:16] running over there you know i mean he's
[1:57:18] going to play that part and he jumps out
[1:57:20] of the chair and runs over and grabs the
[1:57:22] fiddle and starts playing that part and
[1:57:24] he just runs over here bangs on the runs
[1:57:27] that push the conductor away starts
[1:57:30] going like this you know what i mean
[1:57:32] what would it be
[1:57:34] it'd be chaos
[1:57:36] nobody would be hearing the music
[1:57:39] all they would be seeing is the
[1:57:41] musicians completely out of order
[1:57:44] but i love those people then they come
[1:57:46] to that part and then the flute players
[1:57:48] are done they all put that thing right
[1:57:50] there and they sit there like a bunch of
[1:57:52] stones you know i look around see if
[1:57:54] anybody's going to scratch their nose or
[1:57:56] wiggling oh they won't wiggle you know
[1:57:58] they sit right there you know
[1:58:01] and then they put that thing up
[1:58:03] i think man they had sore necks than
[1:58:05] people you know what i mean and then
[1:58:06] sometimes they take their hands down
[1:58:08] this thing's sticking out of them like
[1:58:10] that i think they practice that
[1:58:13] you know but you love it
[1:58:15] because when it's all in its place
[1:58:19] it's a beautiful music and the whole
[1:58:22] thing wouldn't sound beautiful unless
[1:58:25] each person did their part
[1:58:31] and see we've all got to be in this
[1:58:33] together
[1:58:34] it's it's a beautiful time and so
[1:58:38] let me tell you
[1:58:40] i i think maybe some of you have been
[1:58:42] through it where they send your kids
[1:58:44] home with an instrument to see which one
[1:58:47] that they want to play they used to do
[1:58:48] that they made they don't do that no
[1:58:50] more but you know you come home with a
[1:58:52] trumpet or a tuba you know and you'd
[1:58:55] blow that around the house for a while
[1:58:57] until you finally said i want to play
[1:58:59] this
[1:59:00] you know what i mean well god's got
[1:59:02] something in this word for you
[1:59:07] don't look at nobody else don't compare
[1:59:09] yourself get into this message
[1:59:12] until you see that music was flowing out
[1:59:15] of you and you play that part to the
[1:59:18] world you play that part to the people
[1:59:20] you meet you let the music of the gospel
[1:59:23] sing out of your heart and and your
[1:59:27] that next part will come just like me
[1:59:30] going to that barber i don't know who
[1:59:32] left those two books
[1:59:35] you know
[1:59:36] but here i go to a barber i led of the
[1:59:38] lord to go to that barber shop to that
[1:59:41] lady and somebody has been there before
[1:59:43] me and left her two of brother branham's
[1:59:46] sermons
[1:59:48] i didn't know whether to think he beat
[1:59:50] me to it
[1:59:51] or what
[1:59:53] you know what i mean but i thought
[1:59:55] to me that was like praise god
[1:59:59] there's something happening here
[2:00:03] and like i said i don't even know if the
[2:00:04] brother goes to our church
[2:00:07] she told me she's a really nice man a
[2:00:09] lovely man he had long hair and somebody
[2:00:12] gave him some money to come get a
[2:00:13] haircut
[2:00:15] so whoever that fella is god's moving
[2:00:18] well
[2:00:19] i don't have a standard set for him
[2:00:23] you know i don't know he may have had
[2:00:25] dreadlocks for all i know
[2:00:27] it don't matter you understand
[2:00:30] i gotta see the god in everything
[2:00:34] amen
[2:00:35] that's like you said wait till the sun
[2:00:37] comes up and you'll see god everywhere
[2:00:42] anyway because he asked for it
[2:00:44] greater things
[2:00:45] than this
[2:00:47] that i do
[2:00:48] shall you do
[2:00:52] see
[2:00:53] but he was so full of the quickening
[2:00:55] power and everything till he done all
[2:00:58] these double what elijah done more than
[2:01:01] he did and notice
[2:01:03] he lived a life
[2:01:05] on up until about 80 or 90 years old
[2:01:09] he had got old and died he died and then
[2:01:12] he talks about the quickening power
[2:01:15] on them and then paragraph 277 i thought
[2:01:18] was beautiful
[2:01:20] he is alive forevermore the same
[2:01:22] yesterday and forever hebrews 13 8
[2:01:26] notice messiah the anointed one so is
[2:01:29] his bride
[2:01:31] the messiahs
[2:01:33] the anointed one
[2:01:38] again
[2:01:41] this is present tense
[2:01:44] this message is presence 10. its
[2:01:47] messenger had delivered his message
[2:01:50] he done exactly what he was
[2:01:54] told to do
[2:01:55] he left the way that god wanted him to
[2:01:58] leave i don't believe he's dead
[2:02:03] he may not be in this body but if this
[2:02:06] is true they're still that quickening
[2:02:08] power
[2:02:10] it's still that god is still the same
[2:02:13] and what that he spoke
[2:02:16] he spoke of us and so what's transpiring
[2:02:19] is transpiring present tense
[2:02:23] and my heart's desire
[2:02:26] is that
[2:02:27] i know we're at many different levels in
[2:02:30] this church many different
[2:02:32] cultural backgrounds many different
[2:02:34] teaching backgrounds
[2:02:36] many different financial circumstances
[2:02:39] that god is dealing with every heart in
[2:02:43] every life
[2:02:44] and with great patience we've got to to
[2:02:47] wait on one another but remember all the
[2:02:51] perfection is already in him
[2:02:54] and he'll depart that perfection in his
[2:02:56] time and in his season as long as we can
[2:02:59] love one another stay in the unity of
[2:03:02] faith understand who our absolute is you
[2:03:06] understand
[2:03:07] brother random is not our absolute but
[2:03:10] were followers of him as he was of
[2:03:14] christ because that's the way
[2:03:17] that god chose to bring it
[2:03:21] so we look past
[2:03:23] you know in other words you don't refuse
[2:03:26] the letter because of the mailman
[2:03:30] but if you refuse the mailman you'll
[2:03:32] never get the letter
[2:03:37] if you won't let him come on your
[2:03:39] property you won't let her come in your
[2:03:40] life you'll never get the message that
[2:03:43] he's passing and that's why if you say
[2:03:45] in this day and age that this is
[2:03:47] beelzebub when the holy spirit comes and
[2:03:50] does these things to say one thing
[2:03:52] against it there's no forgiveness in
[2:03:54] this life or the life to come because
[2:03:57] you stop the mailman
[2:04:00] at the
[2:04:01] sidewalk
[2:04:05] and you won't
[2:04:06] let them deliver
[2:04:08] the message
[2:04:09] but i'll tell you if you ever take the
[2:04:11] message he delivered and read it
[2:04:15] you're going to be looking for him to
[2:04:16] come up that walk every day
[2:04:21] and i know there's more in there
[2:04:23] and i we're just on the verge i don't
[2:04:26] know if you noticed this morning many
[2:04:29] people came up for prayer this morning
[2:04:33] people i've never seen before
[2:04:35] and the spirit was moving on them i mean
[2:04:37] they were broken god was doing something
[2:04:40] working in their hearts and their life
[2:04:42] people were claiming things
[2:04:44] and
[2:04:45] that's where it starts
[2:04:46] because they ask
[2:04:48] when you ask for that quickening power
[2:04:51] that quickening power will respond you
[2:04:54] have not because you ask not and you ask
[2:04:57] that you can't come up and ask
[2:04:59] and not be believing but when you come
[2:05:01] up and believe in don't you understand
[2:05:04] because you were with him at calvary
[2:05:06] everything that he claimed at calvary
[2:05:10] you have permission
[2:05:12] to claim
[2:05:14] oh i could go preach that over and over
[2:05:17] and over again
[2:05:21] it's all struck off
[2:05:24] you don't have to sit there and say oh
[2:05:26] well i did this last week i can't pray
[2:05:28] for this i got to go get this right now
[2:05:31] praise god gloria he took it
[2:05:34] and and i wanted to say this in closing
[2:05:37] because i think it's so important
[2:05:40] the life that we're living in when
[2:05:42] america turned down god back in the
[2:05:44] early 50s
[2:05:47] and i i i many of you know the quote he
[2:05:49] said i think was it 57 he said this year
[2:05:53] 56
[2:05:55] he said this year they're going to
[2:05:56] choose
[2:05:58] and america turned down god
[2:06:00] and brother brahm's message even though
[2:06:02] it went out it wasn't going out to the
[2:06:04] church world anymore it was only going
[2:06:06] out to the elect
[2:06:08] that we receive it and only the elect
[2:06:10] are going to be a participant in the
[2:06:13] resurrection
[2:06:14] that was spoken but because america
[2:06:17] rejected there's a lot of messed up
[2:06:20] situation
[2:06:23] marriage situations children born out of
[2:06:26] lead all those things and all these but
[2:06:29] this
[2:06:30] supersedes
[2:06:32] all that
[2:06:35] he said just like that child that got
[2:06:37] that epilepsy from their grandparents he
[2:06:39] said this supersedes all that so this
[2:06:42] can set you free
[2:06:44] so don't let your past
[2:06:48] keep you
[2:06:50] from receiving what god wants
[2:06:54] to give you
[2:06:56] amen if you're sincere he knows you're
[2:06:58] sincere
[2:07:00] and if he wants to try your faith
[2:07:03] it pleases him
[2:07:06] to try your faith
[2:07:08] thinking not strange at the trying of
[2:07:10] your faith thinking not strange that the
[2:07:12] fiery darts the enemy think it's not
[2:07:14] strange the trine of your faith is more
[2:07:16] precious than gold
[2:07:18] because it work is patience and let
[2:07:20] patience have a perfect work it's a
[2:07:22] beautiful gospel and and
[2:07:25] uh you know
[2:07:27] lately just being personal with you
[2:07:30] uh
[2:07:31] you know i i i've been listening
[2:07:34] uh
[2:07:35] to the gospel i like listening to
[2:07:38] alexander scorby and and the way that he
[2:07:41] preaches it it's just it's made it come
[2:07:44] alive to me in a different way than when
[2:07:47] i read it you know just myself and then
[2:07:50] to me it was scriptural too he that
[2:07:52] heareth the word so i thought i'd maybe
[2:07:55] kind of get in on some of that blessing
[2:07:57] there you know what i mean
[2:07:59] and uh but
[2:08:01] this gospel is marvelous
[2:08:04] amen
[2:08:05] think these are letters that paul wrote
[2:08:07] and the things he's saying in there
[2:08:10] and they're good fall in love with this
[2:08:14] and it'd really be
[2:08:16] wonderful so lord richly bless you
[2:08:19] we'll be here wednesday night and then
[2:08:21] we're headed to missouri thursday and
[2:08:24] and let's keep them in prayer that god
[2:08:26] will bring them a pastor
[2:08:29] somebody that'll really take care of
[2:08:30] them and love them
[2:08:32] and
[2:08:34] go
[2:08:36] through
[2:08:38] with them
[2:08:39] and
[2:08:40] i know it's hard because it's hard to
[2:08:43] please everybody
[2:08:44] you know and i'm sure everybody has
[2:08:48] their idea but i'm sure that the lord
[2:08:50] knows
[2:08:51] so we just let us pray for them
[2:08:54] too so lord richly
[2:08:56] bless you uh this week and if you can be
[2:08:59] back wednesday night have a prosperous
[2:09:01] week

[2:09:04] your good works might glorify your
[2:09:06] father in heaven
[2:09:07] don't be afraid to ask people if there's
[2:09:09] anything you can pray for
[2:09:11] you know don't be afraid to take on
[2:09:13] their burdens you are the last
[2:09:16] glimpse that they're ever going to get
[2:09:19] of the real church

[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:14] i can appreciate the things that were
[2:20:16] said tonight when i
[2:20:18] first started serving the lord there was
[2:20:21] many situations in my mind that i didn't
[2:20:22] know if i could overcome
[2:20:24] even from
[2:20:26] my parents being married thinking about
[2:20:28] when they got married to when i was born
[2:20:30] did the dates line up
[2:20:32] you know i'd i'd come into church and
[2:20:34] i'd see the seiler family 20 years ago
[2:20:36] and i'm like man that family's perfect
[2:20:39] you know what i mean that's when they
[2:20:40] all had all the little kids there and i
[2:20:41] just thought man i'm never going to be
[2:20:43] able to attain to something like that
[2:20:44] you know and then you hear the the
[2:20:46] message tonight and it's like no matter
[2:20:47] the past no matter the things that come
[2:20:50] up no matter what your parents did no
[2:20:51] matter the things that
[2:20:53] the traits that your dad gave you all
[2:20:55] those things can be overcome
[2:20:56] so i just appreciate that
[2:20:59] and just being being set free you know i
[2:21:01] can really testify that even as brother
[2:21:03] david said
[2:21:04] serving the lord 50 years and seeing
[2:21:06] these messages you know it's just it's
[2:21:08] like now we're receiving that abstract
[2:21:10] several of us were fellowshipping out
[2:21:11] there and that word is just becoming
[2:21:13] real so i just i thank the lord for
[2:21:15] everything that he's doing
[2:21:17] let's just go to him in prayer
[2:21:19] heavenly father lord we come to you
[2:21:20] tonight
[2:21:21] we can truly appreciate the word that is
[2:21:23] being spoken lord we know there's things
[2:21:26] that were preached back in the 40s and
[2:21:27] 50s and 60s and maybe at that time not
[2:21:30] everything was being seen but you knew
[2:21:32] that there would be a time that it would
[2:21:33] be striking the hearts of your people
[2:21:36] lord and that it would be anchoring in
[2:21:37] and we see that loved ones coming in we
[2:21:39] see prodigals coming in we see people
[2:21:42] being witnessed to at work and coming
[2:21:43] off the street and being baptized lord
[2:21:46] we see things that are are going
[2:21:47] downtown in the inner cities lord we see
[2:21:50] brothers being sent out we see this
[2:21:52] message traveling around the world lord
[2:21:53] and we're just thankful that we're a
[2:21:55] part of it lord we know each of us has
[2:21:57] situations in our lives and in our
[2:21:59] families lord but you're more than able
[2:22:01] to overcome all those things lord and
[2:22:03] sometimes we get caught in our flesh and
[2:22:05] in our mind and we try to piece things
[2:22:07] together what help us just to put those
[2:22:09] things away may we be focused on your
[2:22:11] word and may we concentrate lord and
[2:22:13] know what you have for us lord is going
[2:22:15] to get us to the end lord we even said
[2:22:17] it yesterday we might not be where we
[2:22:19] where we first started off lord and what
[2:22:21] we want to be lord but we know we look
[2:22:23] back and know that we're not what we
[2:22:24] used to be we're growing in your word
[2:22:26] and we thank you for that we commit all
[2:22:28] things into your hands we ask these
[2:22:30] things in jesus name amen
[2:22:33] amen
