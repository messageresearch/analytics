father lord we take the token father that you've given us lord we hold it up now to you father and ask you that you'd forgive us lord for any sins and iniquities that we have committed father that we approach you with a clean heart lord and we know there's nothing good within us lord you look upon us lord through the blood of your sacrifice so father lord we ask you to remove anything lord that's in our hearts or in our minds father lord that we can focus upon you lord we raise this token we ask you lord do we know that there's healing lord when you're in your word lord we know that there's forgiveness in it lord we know that there's direction in it for our lives father lord we take this now and hold it up before you father as we sing lord to praises to you father lord god with a clean heart father as the word is brought forward lord let it come within our hearts lord and not just sit dormant father but spring up a newness of life lord we ask this in jesus christ's name amen hey man god bless you we're going to invite brother mike to dole so i'm reading i mean you're happy to be in the house of the lord this morning hey man turn around and shake the hand of somebody tell him god bless you tell him wake up amen good morning we're gonna look at psalm 22 this morning you know as we read this this morning it's uh it's hard not to read this chapter and think about that hour on a cross you know just outside of jerusalem where one was offered up and a debt was paid the sin question forever resolved reconciliation performed many of the verses that we're going to read here they show up again in fulfillment it's almost like a preview or a foreshadowing of a day that would one day play out on calvary you know verse 1 opens up with my god my god why hast thou forsaken me those are the very words used by jesus as he cried out in his final moments on the cross in matthew 27 46 verse 7 describes one being left to scorn it's as they shake the head which is exactly how the scorners were described in matthew 27 39 as they reviled him it says in verse 8 he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him which is almost word for word what the scorners said of him in matthew 27 43. of course verses 14 to 18 describe you know a state of being poured out like water of being thirsty of every bone being accounted for and his garments being parted and gambled over it struck me as i was reading this how every aspect of the position that everything fell into place on that day had already been laid out in the word hundreds of years before it took place once the word was spoken it was just a matter of time before everything began to fall into place and assume its position as the word had spoken you know it it couldn't happen any other way you know once the word goes forth it begins to set in motion whatever chains of chain of events is necessary for things to take up the positions that the word has spoken of concerning them and so here several hundred years later as david is crying out word is going forth that is already beginning to set in motion a manifestation you know once that word goes forth all things find their place to line up with that word but what's interesting is when you read psalm 22 which we will hear in a minute david has no idea that he is speaking forth word that will ultimately play out on a hill hundreds of years later you know there's no mighty visitation from the lord where he rises up and says thus saith the lord and begins to he's trying to hear from the lord he's in a desperate hour he's in a dark hour he's surrounded and has run out of answers and run out of options and has been crying out to the lord and is hearing nothing to the point where he's like have you forsaken me you know it's interesting that it's out of that that the word is going forth in psalm 22 1-2 it just kind of shows you the desperation it says my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why are thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring oh my god i cry in the daytime but thou here is not and in the night season and i'm not silent so the very word which began to set things into motion and to position things for a day at calvary was spoken in an hour where he himself was trying to hear something from the lord he didn't even know that he was word was going forth out of his life as he's waiting to receive something for his need for his hour it didn't feel like word was being spoken by david it felt like he was in a forsaken in a desperate place but everything and everyone that had a part to play at that day at calvary could owe their position to what was spoken during that dark hour of desperation you know i got to thinking about that the whole time that david was waiting for a word from the lord to meet his need word was going forth out of his life that was setting in order putting things into position according to the word and he didn't even know it it made me wonder how many times do we find ourselves in an hour of need in an hour of desperation where we're crying out to the lord to hear an answer to get a visitation to be delivered of our circumstance and yet we have no idea what kind of word is pouring forth out of our life as we're going through that circumstance you know i wonder if david had not gone through that dark hour if the word had not been spoken that ultimately played out on calvary you know it says that in second corinthians 3 2-3 we are written epistles read of all men our lives if they are truly word and flesh are ordered of the lord in such a way so that his word is going forth out of our lives whether we know it or not even in our desperate hour you know and sometimes maybe we're not getting what we need when it seems like we need to hear from the lord because the word that our life needs to speak hasn't finished speaking yet and you know what's interesting is that like so many of david's prayers in verse 22 there's a sudden turn where all of a sudden he receives his answer the lord finally comes on the scene and the whole rest of the chapter is him praising the lord for him coming on the scene but not until the word that needed to come forth out of his life had come forth out of his life and when that finished speaking then he got the answer to his name you know and it made me wonder sometimes as if there's a witness there's a cry that needs to come forth out of our lives in our darkest hour in our hour of desperation in our time of need and there's something that the lord wants the words to finish speaking out of our life and then he'll meet the need then he'll come along and be visit you as you need to but the word has got to finish being spoken out of your experience out of your circumstance so it just kind of struck me as i was looking that let's consider perhaps if we find ourselves in an hour like that then maybe the word hasn't finished speaking in our circumstance and when that word has gone forth you'll receive your answer you'll receive the word you need when the word that needs to be spoken has come forth out of your life so i hope that's kind of an encouragement to you but it struck me as i was reading this and seeing the word played out in david's trial that the lord has control of everything and at the end of the day it's his word that will be made manifest so let's read that together psalm 22. there's a lot more that can be said here but let's read starting in verse 1 my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why aren't those so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring oh my god i cry in the daytime but thou hearest not and in the night season and am not silent but thou art holy oh thou that inhabitest the praises of israel our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver them they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the people all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him but thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me hope when i was upon my mother's breasts i was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god from my mother's belly be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help many bulls have come past me strong bowls of beishan have beset me round they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a roaring lion i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou hast brought me into the dust of death for dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet i may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture but be not thou far from me o lord o my strength haste thee to help me deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the dog save me from the lion's mouth for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns i will declare thy name unto the brethren in the midst of the congregation will i praise thee ye that fear the lord praise him all ye the seed of jacob glorify him and fear him all ye the seed of israel for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted neither hath he hid his face from him but when he cried unto him he heard my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation i will pay my vows before them that fear him the meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the lord that seek him your heart shall live forever all the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the lord and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee for the kingdom is the lord's and he is the governor among the nations all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him and none can keep his his own soul a seed shall serve him it shall be accounted to the lord for regeneration they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born that he hath done this amen i

everything into your hands and ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you amen amen man i trust you're excited to be in the house of god this morning amen let's stand we'll try not to be long this morning let's open our bibles in genesis chapter 32. now let's start from verse 18 it says then shall thy say then thou shalt say they be thy servant jacob it is a is it is it a present it's a it's a present sent unto my lord esau and behold also he has behind us and just for reference this is uh when uh eso is getting ready i'm sorry jacob is getting ready to meet esau and so now he's come to a place where he finally has to meet all the wrong that he had done in his life and it was a reckoning day it's a day where he finally gets to pay for all that he's been running after everything that he's done and everything that he did everything was coming down to an end and now he's trying to devise the final plan what am i going to do what exactly is going to happen so he divides his family he divides the flock so they can send it perhaps if the first group gets get caught the second group can go around and he's trying all manner of things just to try to get out of it and so 19 and he said and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when you find him and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us and i was telling them to tell he's servant so he's really trying really hard an inside servant is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see him i will see his face for adventure that he will accept he will accept of me so he went so so went the present over behind before him and he himself lodged at night in the company and he rose up a rose up that night and he took his two wives and his two woman servants and his 11 sons and passed over over the four jog jawbook and he took them and send them over the brook and send over and send over that he had and jacob was left alone now he's left alone finally is by himself and there wrestled the man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his tie and the hollow of jacob's tie was out of joint and as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou blessed me amen i just trust this morning we can have that kind of perseverance that kind of drive as a believer said i will not let you go until you bless me and he said unto him what is thy name he said jacob and he said the name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as the prince had thou power with god and with men and it prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i prayed thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou do ask after my name and he blessed him there and jacob called the name of the place pineal for he had seen god face to face and for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved let's also turn in isaiah chapter 6. we're going to start from verse 1. it says in the year in the year that usia died the king that king uzziah died i saw also the load sitting upon his throne high and lifted up and his strength filled with temple abbavi stood the seraph above above it stood the seraph and each one had six swings with twenty covered his face with twenty covered his feet with twenty did he fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord the holy is the lord of hosts though it says the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that crieth and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is worries me for i am undone because i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from the from off the altar and he had laid it upon my mouth and said lo this had touched that lip that lips and thy iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged also i had i heard the voice of the lord saying who shall who shall i send who shall go for us then i said here i am here am i sent me let's open one more place in first corinthians chapter 13. we're going to read from verse 9. it says for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child when i become a man i put away childish things for now we see through glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then i shall know even as i am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of this is charity amen may the lord that blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats if i may for a few moments i would like to speak this morning on from jacob to israel a changing character from jacob to israel a change in character now we we know that as believers we we know that the seed of god within us is desiring to see the manifestations of god we we desire to see god manifested we desire to see the promise of god each and every day manifested in our lives i can i can say we can even say even as much as we see the fulfillment of the prophecy in the time that we live in when we look at the world's condition we see everything we see those things happening we are taught even in the message a believer's desire is to go in the bible in the scripture for us to find the promise that pertain to us as the world is getting in his condition we know the bride is also getting in the condition and we desire to see those things come to pass we we can take it down and say within our daily lives within our families within our relationships you know these things that happens in these difficulties these challenges that we face every day and we'd like to see god move within our lives we like to see him heal the sick we like to see him deliver our children we like to see him even ourselves being delivered from certain things that we struggle with all of that is part of the christian life that we live in and is always the need to see god it didn't matter how many times we see him we want to see him more it's a desire within the heart that constantly wants to see god more and more and more regardless of how much we know today we want to know him more than we knew him yesterday we want to know him tomorrow more than what we know him today and barbara makes an interesting statement and i hope we can connect us together with that it says it says man is always trying to find out where he comes from how did they get here and where he's going and that's the whole of man when we summarize what man is all about that's what it is where do you come from how did you get here and where are you going and we always try to find an answer to that question and he says but the thing about it is the one who can answer the question is the one who put him here in the first place so in other word if you're trying to find an answer for your question the one who can answer the question is the one who put he who put you here in the first place the same god who placed us here he's the one who has the answer he's the one who knows how all of this supposed to play he's the one who holds the mystery of all of it he's the answer to all needs and as we come close to him he gets to deliver to us what the answer is by revelation and we walk with him daily it's not a one-time contact and everything is done but he wants a constant contact for every need that we have we go back to him and he answers according to his word now i want to say this makes the statement he says this he says he makes the statement he says he says that man he says may the lord may the lord blessed his word and i think it's the most striking scripture he talks about the scripture that we read in isaiah i believe he says we find out that in the presence of god man records recognizes themselves as sinner man recognizes themselves as sinner in the presence of god and and and and in another place but brenham talks about how that there's never been a man who's come face to face with god and remain the same you never come into the presence of god and not change why because the very change that we're looking for is within the presence of god if we have a need for something we come into the presence of god if we need a change we come into the presence for everything that we have need of the presence of god brings the result or it brings the answer to men's question it says no man has ever seen god face to face and stay the same we we don't uh uh uh uh come to a place where we see god in fact i was thinking about you know but ed testimony talks about being in with what run i'm in the car he talks about the presence of god coming in the car and he says after he left he says he looked at his face his face was changed and everything he asked him he says i feel like dying every time he comes around why because that's the presence of the god that we are serving that's what he is when we look when we think of god when we think about his attribute when we think about his greatness within the small flesh we cannot contain his presence we cannot even stand before his presence it's not made for this flesh to be able to stand before god so he says he recognized himself when man comes before god he recognized himself as sinner it says that we may feel a little good when we are out in different places and if we feel like we're pretty good people but when but when we ever come into the presence of god then we see how little we are he continues on and he says standing not long ago this is in a message's presence standing not long ago with a friend of mine i had the privilege to lead to christ's birth call and i believe this is if i recall my mind served me properly this is the one the story about the mother dear that that manifested the characteristics of what a real genuine mother was and now caused him to to he was trying to shoot the doe and then when he looked at the mother dear come around and he come and his life was changed it says up in nuance for hunting partners we're standing in a cold brook fall of uh adorat it says in such a great mammoth fall it says and i take my family last year up there and i i i took it i took it way back off the road we have it says we have to hike back there and to get it to get to it and when we seen the blue green water pouring with such mighty power out of the out of the mountains and gushing down over the rocks and and bert stood there and looked at me and he says geez billy gee billy he said it makes me feel so little it says in he measured about a quarter of an inch of his finger and he says that's right bird now it says that that was all that he know of getting into the presence of god he's seen his creation he see his creation so this here is this man standing and looking at the creation of god looking at the at the fall and looking at the nature looking and realizing and saying oh how huge this is and and perhaps we can recall from our own experiences where we've been to a place uh whether it be a mountain top a waterfall or a place where it just seemed uh you know i remember uh being a niagara fall just looking at the how huge the waterfall was and and looking at the people down there you realize that men cannot do this this is beyond man man cannot achieve this this is nature at its best and god created this god made this to be this way god made it so one can look at him and enjoy it and realize that this is not men that can do this and the most important thing is for you to look at it and realize that there is a presence of god it wasn't just made for men to just go and and go and do things the way they would like but the the the the the truth about it is it was made so one can look at it and come into the realization of how god great god is that come to a place where you realize that god is not a man or he's not a son of man he's not a man he doesn't think like we are he doesn't dwell in the things that we do he doesn't do things like a mortal will do but this is god he has the power to change things and when he makes things it's beyond our understanding you you it's very important that we always come to a place where we realize that as we are here because barbara makes a statement he says the reason why men sin is because they feel they are not in the presence of god it's because they feel they are far removed from where god is but when you come to the realization when you know the sun is shining it's god the sun rise it's god it's raining it's god when you come to a realization that everything when i look at the bird i see god everything i look when i look at nature i see god then you would know that you are constantly and always in the presence of god amen the thing about it is man is trying to remove himself from god he's trying to get himself to a place where he can uh i think he's by himself he can enjoy his life and do things the way he wants but god is constantly there watching there's not david said there's no place i can run to the end of the earth you are there he speaks in psalm he says when i was carelessly bought and and in my mother's womb when my members were imperfect you were there it says when i go down in hell you are there there's no place where you can run away from god there's not a place where you cannot feel the presence of god he's the creator of all the heaven and the earth and he wants you to know that regardless of where you are and i can talk about physically i can talk about spiritually regardless of where you are god is there with you god is not in this building as per say god is here is everywhere because he has the ability to see we have brought him here when we go home god is at home when we go to where god is at work it's just us coming into the realization that his presence is with me he walks with me he talks with me he wants to communicate with me he wants to impart something to me i just need to make contact but he's there there's not jonah cried from the belly of the well and god heard him from down there so the presence of god is conscious constantly and continually with us he continues on and he says oh i wonder the men i wrote how great they are if you didn't look at one night and look up at the stars how far they are away and a few months ago brother fred and brother wood and bro and i standing with brother uh uh mcnally brother mcnelly out in arizona desert it says we was measuring train one star how close it was to another it says uh with millions of and billions of miles away it says they didn't look they didn't look they didn't look over a quarter of an inch from each other then we began to think according to science the scientific proof of that those stars are probably further away from each other than we are from them so now i want you to think about what he's talking here it continues on it says then we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is oh my proud of my sister and and and why is this important because within the life's challenges within the life that we live in it's very important that everything is measured to its appropriate scale we cannot confuse and come to a place where we ever think well i think my life is too messed up or my life is too complicated that things are so complicated that god cannot come and solve it that that is making god immortal that is making god and bringing him down to your level that is bringing taking god and trying to fit him within your own mind but what he would like to do this morning is for us to come as we are it didn't matter what your background was it didn't matter what you did it didn't matter what your situation was you bring it to him and he will take care of him because he has many times trying to show us within the scripture that the things that concern him are far above what we can understand what our mind can conceive and everything about us what he wants us to do is to trust it within his hands and know that he has the answer to our problems it says we realize how little we are and we realize how great he is and how close it says how close we coming into the presence in we're coming to the coming we're coming to the coming of his presence somehow another he's he's always thrown a great effect upon people to come into the presence of god we've seen time and time we've seen time in the mystery when we would see the presence of god coming to such a place and he would bring a person up and reveal the uh he revealed the life to them and called their sin they call their sins all kinds of immoral act and bring and bring such a holy hush among the people till they drop out of prayer line before they even come to the beco to come to be prayed for and run to the altar and get right god before they can get right with god before they can come into his presence there is something about coming into the presence of god is causing things to happen we've seen people laying in cost in in cost and structures in other words the area is the presence of god always brings a change the presence of god is there to bring about the transformation we said no one has ever come into the presence of god and remained the same the scripture tells us no one can come into the presence of god and remain the same person and continue to do the same person what the presence of god is here to do is to take you and change you from a jacob and change you into israel what the presence of god is here to do is to take the seed we say the seed was in the ground with this fleshly ground that god placed it in but the seed was made so that when he comes into the presence of god that the light will strike the seed that it will be changed from just being a seed and stain a seed into the manifestation of its fruit so it can manifest something for god so it wasn't made so the seed can remain a seed but it was made so that the presence of god the atmosphere that it created the presence of god that the holy unction that god that he creates when his spirits come down is there to produce life and that's why it's important that we desire the presence of god if you whatever you have need of this morning only the presence of god can bring it to you if you desire healing the presence of god is yet to provide it you desire the deliverance the presence of god is here to deliver whatever we have need of when you come to church this morning and i was wondering did you come oh brother david is not there i just come to hear about the billy oh oh i hear to hear from the david that's not gonna help you that's not gonna do you no girl because man cannot give to you what you have need of what we need is to be elevated and say i have showed up this morning with expectation i didn't come to hear what that man has to say but i'm here for the word of god and i will latch on to the word of god and i will receive what i have because we receive according to our expectation it's the presence of god that brings things it's not a man he has nothing to do with a man he all has to do with the presence of god if we can come this morning realize this is we we have a ritual per se the you know there's the song that has to go there's the the part of the offering and will take the offering because it's part of worship and everything but don't let that stray you away don't let don't ever be a believer that can say well i pay my tithes i go to church and i do this and therefore i'm satisfied if you are in that state you will miss a lot of things about god why because when we wake up in the morning i don't know about you there is something within my heart that says i desire god today i know i'm a failure without him i know i couldn't say anything right without him i couldn't do anything right with him i know i need his presence oh my brother my sister the scripture speaks about in the old testament there was aaron's uh rod that was taken the rod was lifeless there was no inch of life within the stick it was all drained out and taken out but that rod was taken and placed back into the presence of god it produced fruits and if we desire fruits this morning that same presence can bring it to us this morning so now we read the scripture we read the scripture in isaiah here is isaiah he comes in but random talks a little bit about him how that his life he said this king had been so good to him and and he he had so much faith in this king and and and the things and and yet the king died and yerry was and and he didn't he he just trusted him so much and here he is he says he's taken up and and he's in the place and he began to look and and he's taken to this place he looked at all the seraphins and they have six wings and they two they cover the face and to their feet and with to the flu and they came around and and such a holy place and they began every time they would speak or say holy holy holy three times and they will take a step and the pillars will shake oh my just think about such a presence my brother my sister we have to realize what kind of god we're serving i think sometimes our mind gets dimmed out and our mind gets uh brought down and and we think so little we think in in such a constraint and everything the things the reality of who this god is and everything that he is about him it will take eternity for us to understand it everything about this god will take us eternity because we only know him as he unfolds himself as he reveals himself to us so here he is and in his glory it says the glory of the of the lord filled the temple and as it takes a step the whole place just shakes he realized the first thing you realize it says woe is me woe is me you know it's it's so contrary to the carnal human understanding of coming into the presence of god people will go to church and and play all kinds of worldly music and scream and shout and and do all kinds of things and come and say oh i was in the presence of god i want you to think about that this morning the church world will play rock and roll music that will stand up all kinds of instruments and reproduce everything that the world is doing and and then come home and say oh did you feel the presence of god but yet the description of a prophet i want you to think about this this is one of the greatest prophet in the bible who wrote 66 chap chapter who wrote almost the entire bible who the one who said who talked about the messiah coming one who talked about the bride and and the new jerusalem and all of this great prophecy and all of this standing before the presence of god and all he could think of is woe is me i tell you this flesh was never meant to be in the presence of god there's no uh there's not enough holiness you can put up on it to bring it before god what it takes is he him inviting you and i want you to realize that the only way he could come is when one of the serpents provided away he gave him a call of fire for him to put that's how he could even speak oh my prayer my sister the only way we can speak in this generation is because god provided a way for us to speak back there he is and he realized oh woe is me in other words when the presence of god comes the first thing that he does it will convict you and will convict you of sin and that's why people run away from it people don't want to be in contact with god because they know every little thing that they do they will get conviction so they run away as far as possible the first thing that he does is bring conviction if you're not living right he'll show you you're not living right if you're not acting right it will show you you're not acting right if you're anything any variation i want you to think about this missionary who thought that he had done so great things and and here he is and he's standing and he goes they open the name it says your name is not in the book it says oh you have to appeal to the white throne judgment and then it goes there and it says oh as i got closer he got lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter what is it the presence of god it's it's a purifying presence it's something that cleans you it's something that makes you whole it's something that makes you what you're supposed to be don't run away from it run to it in the garden of eden there were the chairmans that were protecting you away from it but now that way it's been made open so we can run to it and i want to say this this morning without the presence of god we are all dead the only way to live is to go into that presence you say it's going to kill me let it kill you let it kill the human at your wall let it kill the worldliness that you have let's kill everything because after he's done killing you he will resurrect you [Applause] the thing that we struggle with is we run away from the very thing that's supposed to save us we run away from the thing that god has provided we are okay with somebody just standing and giving us scriptures we're studying the bible studying just you know oh the scripture says do not lie well you know i'll try my best not to lie you know and the scripture says do this and do this you try to practice it within yourself i'll tell you this morning when you come into that presence you have no need of no man reminding you because what that presence does to you is permanent it takes away the desire christianity is not a practicing of something that you go to school and you educate yourself christianity is a person who's come in contact with god and you're standing there knowing that i can only do this because god allowed me to do this he blessed the desire within my heart i'm living this way because he allowed me to live this way he's made something for me and i cannot let anything comes within my way we struggle because we don't surrender fully to his presence so this missionary stands there evangelist in the presidency got staring it says if you ever told a lie it said well at first i was pretty sure of it but then when in front of that presence everything begins to magnify everything becomes to be a reality you realize i must have said things and i said things that were just not a hundred percent true i said i i went i did things that were just not a hundred percent he come to the realization if you ever stole is that ashrae i didn't stole i didn't steal anything but yet within that presence the magnification of who he was because of who god was not because of who he is but because of who's whose presence he was standing in he come to the realization i did that but that's not the end of the story i want you to realize that that same presence that made that it says as the judgment was getting ready to be pronounced he heard a voice he said father when he was down there he stood for me and i'll stand for him and i want to say this the only way we get is to get into his presence that's how he's going to stand for us when we get into his presence when we let him take the wilderness away the reason why we struggle with what we struggle is because we are in this flesh but i tell you what you take this presence into that presence that presence will take this place and bring it under subjection that presence will take this flesh and change it and here is isaiah standing and realize i'm a man of unclean lips i dwell within the unclean lips people and then it says how do i get to be accepted here i am how do i is there any any chance for me but yet within that presence there was a call of fire provided for him now i want you to listen but when him is saying he's talking about that he says he says and isaiah when he says the great thirst and perhaps he was schooled he was probably a good edu uh he was it was he had a good education and marvelous conception of god as and he had he he had he had the priest and uh he had heard the he had the priest and he had been in the temple and he was raised and believer a believer it says but you see you see he had never come face to face with it before and i want to say this it's not how educated we can get in the message it's not how many quotes we can know it's not how many things we can recite but the real answer to the question is if you come in contact with the face-to-face god of that message and and i'll say this this sounds very uh simple but you realize that's where the life is that's why people will struggle at the most is people come to a place where they are content with just reading the bible they're just contending with reading the message but they're not looking for that god to come in contact with them and make the things which they are reading come a reality now any man can read the books any man can read the tapes in fact some have read it and they've called it of the devil what makes the difference is god coming to you and showing you and making this world a reality to your life i'll take that over anything you take religion god is not interested in religion god is not interested in us just building a body and calling ourselves christian life tabernacle god is interested in individuals who knows who he is because that's what life is i i want to know god i want to come in contact with him i want his life to be my life i want the things which i do to just not be some type of instructions but i want to do them because i'm coming in contact with god and that has been revealed to me to be the truth and he says and he never come face to face with it before and he says his desires was right so it's not about the desire he wanted to be right but he just he just he just had an educated side he just had the educational side he had he had the feel the theological side of it but when he had gotten there in the temple that day and he seen the cherubians waving the wings uh the the wings even as you even know what sin was and it stands in the presence of god they had covered the holy face and stand in the presence of god and the prophet cried out woe is me i'm undone i'm a man of unclean lips i'm a it says all my theology theology and stuff i've learned all the my marvelous conception that i have of god it says my face i'm i'm face to face with it now he says i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell with people on clean lips all the teaching of laws and things that they had done had never reached to the place to where he comes in the presence of god and seeing god with his own eyes theology is not gonna bring you there education is not gonna bring you there it says and and these trials when he was sitting up on high in heaven and there was a face to face with a face professor with reality he cried i'm unclean i'm i'm off on clean lips and i dwell among unclean people and then it was the cherub and took the tongues and the coal of fire from the altar and it touched them unclean lips and turned him from a coward or from from educated man a teacher a to a teacher i'm sorry to a prophet that the word of god could speak through now what makes the difference here he is saying what makes the difference what changed him was the fact that the chairman took the qualifier placed it upon his lips that's what changed him from who he was to who he became it took him from education into the other place it took him from just one that was learned and i knew that went into the temple and and and did all those things to one that would come and become the mouthpiece of god and the prophet he said sure while it was in the presence of god it says it was something different the thirst that he had had had reached a place then till he was filled within let me tell you friends i don't care how much church you joined how many how many names you put on you you put you put how many names you put on it says which is a way to go whether you are sprinkled baptized of whatever you are until you meet that person jesus christ that's the only thing that will that will that's the only thing that will really satisfy yeah yeah he is he's calling us and saying do you need to be satisfied do you desire this morning to be satisfied i said i want to be satisfied and the only thing that could be satisfied at first is for us this morning to come into the presence of god when the word is coming forth when the word is coming for when god has made himself known for you to come into his presence when he has made his promise when he said what he's gonna do in this generation you need to take that promise walk it back to him and say i need you to make this promise real to me and have that god come face to face with you that's the thing that satisfy we we oftentimes this doesn't satisfy we run to the other one this doesn't satisfy we run to another one we we try to satisfy this with this and that with this and and we run into a confusion or a person comes and oh you want to be a christian but yet you still want to be in the world you want to dress like the world but yet you want to be a christian so now you get to a place where you begin to compromise well you know i will do a little bit of work but i won't do all of it because i still need to serve god also oh my i tell you we are men of unclean lips all we need is to come into the presence of god because once the desires is changed then you don't have to worry about the outside the outside will follow why because when that thirst is satisfied when you come to a place where you know i've sold everything i've left the world i don't desire anything in the world i don't desire what it has to offer because the end of it is death i don't desire what the world is doing there's nothing in the world that attracts me once you are attracted by this living god then only your life can manifest the things which you are confessing the scripture says we are the light of the world but the thing about it is as our pastor was saying wednesday what we are manifesting is contrary to what we believe there seems to be a conflict we know within us there is a genuine desire to manifest christ within us we know for ourselves i know within myself that i desire to serve god that i desire to do well i desire to do this i desire to do this but yet i find myself doing this what's satisfied the only thing that can answer that satisfaction is to meet the one who placed the desire in there in the first place the more you meet with him the more the worldliness is stripped out of you the more you come in contact with him the more his desire becomes your desire the more you come in contact with him the more the worldliness gets away why because worldliness cannot enter into his presence why because the worldly desires and all those things cannot enter into his presence his presence is holiness his presence is perfection his presence is all those things as as you come closer the closer you get the more you are transforming to his image he says emotion won't do it he says you might jump up and down and shout and as long as you as long as you want to and you might run up and down the floor you might speak in tongue as much as you want to and then things and them things and and holy and good it says i i don't say nothing against that but until you meet that person that satisfy that satisfying portion that something that takes every fiber of your body not by emotion but by satisfaction he says and any and and and why we want to take it says why do we want to take a substitute when there is a genuine baptism of the holy spirit that satisfies every fiber it says in the longing of a human soul then standing right in the face of death like the great apostle paul all death wears your sting and grave where's your victory but thanks be to god who gives the victory through the lord jesus christ it says that's the experience brother that's satisfying the holy spirit hush thus he says that holy spirit thirsts in you it satisfies it you don't have to do anything else about it yes it cleans the lips it's the experience that cleans the lips it's the one that brings the cleaning that we have need of it's the only thing that brings us into the image of what we are looking for now i i didn't i i just i was just asking uh within my own self i said uh it becomes very important because we said men's nature but random says is to run away from god's presence and and the reason why we ran away i said is because we do not want to come and and be exposed you know but talks about a time where you know it says people will come in the prayer line and they would have to get out and go confess the sin before they come because they're going to be exposed and and i wonder within ourselves i began to ask myself i said if we got into a place where we are just satisfied with what we have you know as long as we can come to church the minister ministers and we receive and and and then god and and then we go we don't want any other manifestation except what we already have we we don't want thing to be called out of the door we don't want things that we have hidden within our heart to be exposed not necessarily exposed on the pulpit but we don't want we get to a place where we are comfortable within the measure of what we have received and we want to grow just that way stay that way and we don't want anything to disturb that now we i it's very important we realize in the economy of god the church is called into a higher manifestation in the economy of god the bride is called to come to a place where she can do the greater works where she can uh uh uh come and and be able to identify the two uh uh scripture the two spirits within the framework of the church and be able to withstand the evil one and to follow god she's called into the manifestation of christ in the end time and she's even called to a place where she can become the final voice and the only way we get to become the final voice it's not by education it's not by just being content if we desire more of god it means there's more of god to fill us with if we desire more of god it means there's more of god to be manifested the body of believer was made to be a place where we can come in here each one with a testimony of the great things that god has done within our daily lives and and talking to one another and realizing that god is working among us it was meant to be a place where a sinner can walk in and be convicted and be changed now before we can get to the sin or be changed we ourselves have to get ourselves into a position where we've come so close with his presence that he can manifest himself whichever way he chooses we we we have it we have to come to the place where we realize it it would take just as much as we'll get to it just as much as he took a backside of the desert for moses just as much as he took a backside of the desert for jacob just as much as he took a backside of the desert papal it would have to take a backside of the desert for each and every one of us not the congregation not within the body but each individual having gone to a back side of the desert having gone to a closet where god has been made real to you that's why the preaching of the word is not a place where we just come and you know one comes and he says things that you never heard before that was never the intention the intention was that we come here back for fellowship of what god has been doing in your life in his life in his life in the other person's life we come together and god is able to speak to us all why because each individual have been talking to him but the negolidium spirit is the one that texts people and he says you have to do nothing no effort don't even get in his presence because you'll die just stay away and let the preacher do all the talking and let the preacher do all they're doing in fact don't even testify don't even go out and let your light shine you just come as a sinner and every time your sin will be forgiven that's not the church that god is building the church that god is building it was not just peter on the day of pentecost in fact the scripture says about philip who was also there who was transported in another place what did that it was god moving in the midst the scripture says there were three thousand oh if we can record what each three thousand of them had done and what they had come in contact with the power that was manifested in their life there's not enough place in the book for us to put it why because it was god working in his people and it's the same way today with the revealing of the word and the end time we are being brought right back into that same condition so the same god can do the same thing he says when the first man as soon as he had sinned and done something wrong when god came into his presence oh he coming to the presence of god adam he could not stand in the presence of god he ran into hi and and hide himself in the bush and try to cover himself with fig lifts because he knew he knowed that he was standing in the presence of jehovah the creator that was the reaction of the first man and after he had sinned he tried he could not hide because he was standing it was it was tender yet sin had not took hold had not took hold of it as a root into his people's heart today but he was very conscious and he was standing before that he was standing he was standing before his creator now he hid himself with a bush bushes and and would not come out and could not come until god had made a preparation for him he said this is in the message's presence it says psalms 6 and 8 it says david said now i want you to to see the wisdom in what he's saying here david said i have set the lord always before me he says that's the thing that's a good thing to do psalm 8 16 8 i have set the lord before me so i could not be confused about it he wanted to be conscious of his presence so david said i have sent the lord always before my face and now i david has set the load before my face always to be conscious of god's presence it says wouldn't be wouldn't that be good a good lesson for us tonight to set the lord before our faith so we won't so we'll be conscious of his presence put him first why put him first before you why then you won't sin when you are realizing that constantly you are in the presence of god oh my the reason we do it is because we fail to realize his presence here he's saying put him before you and remind yourself constantly in whose presence you are standing remind yourself within yourself i'm standing in front of god it don't matter whether i'm at the end of the earth so wherever i am it didn't matter whether i was at home at my job at school wherever i am the lord is always before me i couldn't do this because the lord is always before me why you make him a reality it's not because think about this if that's not the case then it's just the god of the book that you've left at home it's just a god that you come meet when you come to church it's just a god that you meet when you go in the gathering of the saints it's not the god that you take into your home it's not the god that you take to work you take everywhere because if it's the god that you take everywhere then you consciously have to be at a place where you realize i have always said the lord before me is before me right now is protecting me is guiding me is taking care of everything about me he says when you realize god is around you will watch what you say when you realize god is around you will watch what you say it says and a man when he thinks god is gone he cusses he will he will lust after women he will he will still he will cheat and lie he'll do anything when he thinks god don't see him but bring him into the presence of god he'll stop it right there the secret is the presence of god it changes us don't be afraid of it invite it every day when you walk up in the morning god i need your presence today when you go back at night god i need your presence wherever you are at your job at school it says god your presence without your presence i'm done without your presence i'm nervous i don't know what to say without your presence my mind is shot i'm confused and everything but when your presence is here i'm comfortable oh i tell you i recall the deeper call unto the deep yes the prophet just trying to put words together and talking about story some of them don't seem to make sense and everything but when the presence came into the building he said he's here and then after he came he says i take this building and everybody under my control why because he knew god was there with him oh if we can live life knowing that god is with us who can be against us who can stand against us it's not that he's against you is that he's there to take care of you it's there to protect you is there to take care about things concerning you is that to make sure that his promise is real when you run away from him you're running away from your deliverance he says but bring him into the presence of god and stop it right now and david said i have always put the load before me that's a good thing no wonder god said he was a man after his own heart it says man will do anything when he thinks god is not isn't near but when he realized god is near did you ever notice a sinner let a godly person let a godly person walk up he'll quit cursing if that ever happened to you you have a person and just running the mouse and everything and you just say you know you say perhaps you know i remember in my case i just said do you speak english is that all that you use is that all the vocabulary are you having and somebody else translated to him he's a christian and that was the end of the story don't be afraid don't be afraid and you didn't do it to post and show something you just want to be reverend you just want to make sure that the person realizes that you're not there by yourself there's somebody else with you and that person cannot stand that kind of language and that person that's with you cannot stay in that kind of environment so it's time to change the environment oh i tell you my brother my sister will live below our privileges and our privilege is to we are called to be sons and daughters of god that can change the atmosphere the prophet tells us now think about this the word is a seed the prophet tells us and the seed needs the perfect atmosphere in order for it to come up so the word all you need to do is just create the atmosphere all you need to do is just that's why i like that song it says take the name of jesus with you just whisper it just begin to mumble it within your mouth and just begin to say words and everything it will bring his presence why because he promised he will be dead well i'll tell you when i can't figure out what i'm doing and everything i'm doing just failing i just began to sing and you're like it's technology yeah god can help me if i can't figure it out i call upon his name if i don't know what i'm doing i call upon his name why because it's the privilege that's been given to you as a believer what is your privilege your privilege is you can call upon his presence to come into your location to come into the hospital to come into wherever you are the doctor said what they want to say that's good that's what they've said but i'm not done yet i need to call upon the master of circumstances to come and assist me why because i'm his child and i'm his daughter it's the privilege we've been given don't run away from it but one of them says it's the greatest privilege ever given to immortal is to walk with god to walk with him amen and he's here this morning desiring to walk with each and every one with you desiring to touch you to grab your attention to grab those attention to grab your attention he's desiring to come this morning to convict us of all the things that we do wrong to let us know that those things we're not supposed to do but when he's done convicting his year to give us the strength and the spirit in order for us to go out of here overcome us god has got the whole package he's just not got one side of things where he leaves you on your own and he convicts you and lets you cry until you cry your eyeballs out but it's here to provide what you have need of in order for you to walk out of this building and say i was doing this but now i'm changed why because i met god god spoke to me god could be speaking this morning to other people it's noise oh but let it be to you this morning that i'm hearing from god he's talking to my soul he knows what i have need off so i want to say this we're not going to get there by some form of theology we and i thought about this how many have you ever worked for somebody and yet you don't talk to them how would you know what to expect you to do that's right how do you receive your instructions of what you're supposed to do that day how can you work for someone how can you be in contact with someone but yet you don't communicate you don't come in contact with them that's the religion of the world i'll tell you that you asked me where is that it's all over the world it's every church around the corner people they go they receive they go they read the bible and they said oh god has talked to us and they go back home and they think that's the end of the story no he's got to come and make the bible a reality let me emphasize that why because intellect will fail you knowledge will change we know today more tomorrow we don't know even with the things we know we forget but the presence of god if someone has ever come into the presence of god it's not something you can ever forget you know i was thinking you know it's like one being in a car accident or being in a near-death experience it's something the moment you begin to talk about it it takes you right back into the circumstance you can remember every detail about what happened oh my brother my sister if we have that kind of memory for the things of the world how much more when god comes around you how much more when god wants to speak to you i tell you when he speaks it's something within your heart you know i did that because god told me to do it and it's not about how long we've been in the message oh how many services we attend even though that will cause you to do that but the real deal here this morning is i need to come face to face with him i need for everything i have need of i mean everything that i have need of i have to take it to him and he has to talk to me i have to take it to him and he has to speak to me i want to say this this morning i was uh just as i was thinking about this it just came to my mind i was thinking about david and i was thinking about david and and i thought this morning what's the reason why we have to come face to face we said it's because his presence is changing us this presence is perfecting us it's prep his presence is giving us purpose why we're even here where do i come from how did i get here where am i going he's answering the question every day by coming into his presence but i want to say this also and this is not by no means all that there is to it i want to say this this morning it's very important because he knows what lies ahead and you need to come to him so this morning he can equip you with what you need for the journey oh it just down on me i begin to think about david there he is one who was anointed to be king anointed just a little boy as shepherd it was not by accident that he was a shepherd boy that was a calling from his father it was not by accident that the bear came by his way it was not by accident that the lion came by his way all of that was preparation for what was to come if you had david he had no clue about what was happening he just knew this happened and god helped me he knew this happened and god helped me but god knew that there were going to come a goliath next so he had to prepare him for the journey ahead and then for him to prepare it david had to come face to face with this god and god delivered him therefore he can stand when he's going to fight golight and said i have met god and i know what i'm talking about there was a bear that came on my way that god showed up there was a lion that came on my way that god showed up and the same god who showed up over there he sent this prophet to anoint me for me to become king and if the anointing is a true anointing then this goliath means nothing he knows what's ahead and we are here this morning being prepared for the rapture oh my brother my sister we are here in preparation for that great day so in order for us to be prepared for what's to come we need to meet him here and him preparing us for the event giving us what we have need of dressing up with what we have need of so that when we get to that day we are equipped for the journey amen we can't make the journey ourselves and it's going through just the personal experiences in the bible and how that it changed those people and he gave them the ability for them to fulfill the promise for their age or for their season it took them coming face to face with god i want you to listen in the message faith it says how little was for abraham after he had endured after and seeing him was who was invisible how after he met god and had an experience after of talking face to face with god that he could call those things which were not as though they were what did that the experience the meaning face to face it says for he had an experience he had talked to god face to face that's what we need is a personal experience with a living god he moves on he talks about moses he says how that moses having 40 years of religious training by his mother how having 40 years of military might in his hand of how to whip a nation how to conquer and he taken god 40 years to take it out of him but once out there in the wilderness alone one day he came face to face with god in a burning bush he was better equipped in five minutes after he had talked with god than the 80 years of schooling he had done five minutes he was well equipped then all the 80 years i'll take the five minutes take the eight years i'll take the five minutes god just for five minutes if you can this morning just drop my my way touch me this morning i i want my life to reflect the message that i believe i don't want to act like the world i don't want to dress like the world i don't want to think like the world i don't want any part of me to be worldly i want to reflect a hundred percent the word of the hour what do i need i need five minutes i need five minutes god i need you to rip everything away from me that's off the world i need you to change me i need you to because that's the only way you become a testimony a testimony is not you reflecting your own life but it's something that god has done and it's no longer reflecting that person but it's god reflecting himself through when the woman at the well went and say i i have seen a man who's told me everything i had done within my mind i'm asking myself they all knew it they already knew it anyway but what the reason why he was saying it is because something different had happened to him and they could see it they were able to see that this is different what she's talking about is different yes we know about her life yes we know but the way she's talking about it what she's expressing right now is different from everything that she's expressed before we we cannot be stuck on jacob all the time and and jacob and his inability his conliness and and and the things that he was able to do there's got to come a time where we've met god face to face it's no longer jacob that's on display it's it's israel that's on display but it says god is a separator god is calling for total separation and the separation is not even us making up the separation but the separation is the fact that you receive god within your heart calls the separation from everything else in other words they don't mix your heart doesn't desire the things that you desire anymore but how can we say that we receive god and still stuck in in jacob amen and our life everywhere we speak it's jacob we see every time we do something is checkup that's manifested every time we try to do something it's jacob it's jacob the only way to kill jacob is to bring him into the presence of an angel bring him into the presence of this living god and let jacob die my brother my sister i tell you death is a wonderful thing because once you die he will resurrect you and your desire will be changed you will have a perfect hatred for the things of the world he says he he says he was a coward dying a thousand death and after meeting god he wished he had a thousand lives to die for christ he was ready to go there was nothing that could stop him though he had no army though he had though his education had no it was no good for him he couldn't fight he was he had no sword he didn't have any warriors any chariot back back with him as far as i as far as the waldis knew it but he would come face to face with god as an experience it says who had an armed angel of all the eternity and standing by him and moses went his way down with his wife on the straddle of of of this little old mule and a long it says in the long whisker hanging down i believe that ten thousand times ten thousand ten thousand times ten thousands of angel rode down those dusty roads with him he had an experience when you have an experience it's no longer about you you can ridicule yourself you could do all men can say all that they want to you everything they can talk and call you all kinds of name but random says you are it's a dead man they punch you when you punch a dead man he doesn't respond but if they punch you and see if you want to reply that means you're not dead yet if somebody says something to you you want to reply it means you're not dead yet if something happened you you're working out oh man i'm gonna get him i'm gonna really gonna get him back that means you're not dead yet we need to die we need to die and the only way to die is to come into his presence in closing i was thinking about jacob now i want you to realize the circumstances surrounding him but random says and uh for the sake of time i won't be able to read all of it jacob pretty much had all his life built on lies he lied his daddy his great his father-in-law figured out a way to get more goats than his father-in-law you know figure out how to kid he could get his brother to surrender no doubt he was i mean he spent all his life just working for the day that he so is going to say you know just take it he just waited i don't know how many times they tried before that time bone a shyster a splendor the scripture says here it comes in and gone and had a family and all those things finally his day of reckoning was at the end he had to come and meet all the past all the wrong that he had done because remember he was trying to go back to his country the angel told him to go back he said he needs to go back so now he's coming back to where it all started where all the lies everything and here is he is at the final minute trying to divisive in a plan by which it can save even half of his family if he so decide to kill them finally he has a moment where he's alone and the scripture says he prayed he said oh god of my father isaac he said you're the one that told me to go it says he realized that he was in desperation he needed to come face to face he realized that what he had even his own plan that he devised was not going to be sufficient for everything that he had done even his own plan was not enough to save him now he had to come face to face with god and the scripture says that he came and he was by himself and it says a man came and he began to wrestle with him he began to wrestle with him all night he began to pray he began to intercede he began to cry out he began to call he began to look by all means to save his life how can my life be said what can i do he began he was ready to give up everything if if esau was to offer him you just come i'll kill you and leave your family alone he would have taken it that's how desperate it was he was looking for a way he send his family and he's he's like he's tried everything he needed god to come to his assistance and the scripture says that he came and he prayed and he began to wrestle with this man and they wrestle and the wrestling and the day's about to break and the man the angel said the man says and it says and he wrestled all night and when he looked like the day was coming to break it says let me go i pray and jacob wouldn't let him go you see he was serious about something he touched the hollow of his eye of his uh tie in order for him to stop him but jacob that was not enough to stop him he wrestled with him he wrestled with him he says i won't let you go until you bless me do we get to that place do we go face to face and wrestle with god with every promise with every scripture with the promise with with whatever his promise says whatever our circumstances it says god i'm staying here i'm here until you bless me he wrestled with him and in verse 26 it says and let it says let me go for the day breaketh and i said i will not let thee go except that bless me. now i want you to think and ask yourself a question what kind of blessing was jacob looking for he had the cattle he had the family he had money he was not a poor man what kind of blessing was he looking for he was looking for a blessing that all his worldly good could not give him he was looking for something that none of what he had gone so far with was good enough his children was not good enough his wives were not good enough his cattle his servants everything none of it was good enough he needed something more amen so he said and he said now i think this is very profound when he says i won't let you go until you bless me his next question is what is your name what is your name it said my name is jacob in other words i'm the supplanter i'm the liar i'm the cheater i'm the conniver i'm all of these things he confessed what he was the presence of god brought him to a confession of what he really knew about himself and it's only after he confessed his weakness and everything about him then the next verse he said and he said unto him and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel and why for as a prince thou has power with god and with man and it prevail now i i the reason why i i just i'm saying this so slowly is because i really want this to sink it's in his presence that these things can happen it's not within our own minds we can't make ourselves something we're not when we come before him we tell him who we are we tell him what we've done we tell him i'm wrong we tell him all those things and he is the one who's giving a new name and here he is changing his name before even any manifestation could come because why because the new name was going to come with new manifestation why because the new name was going to come with a new character why because the new name with the name jacob he could have never power with god and overcome with the name jacob he could have never done anything right with the name jacob he was going to continue to be what he was but with the new name that he was given israel he was able to extend and be able to produce what god wanted him to produce so yeah he was and he said his name and and after that he said the name shall be no more jacob but israel has thou power with god and prevail and jacob asked him he said tell me i pray i pray thee thy name and it says wherefore is it that thou asked after my name and he blessed them they blessed them there and jacob called the name of the planet and i want to say this this morning in closing it's very important that we have a place or we have the awareness of the presence of god within our lives that there's a place where we can go and talk with god there's an awareness god is walking with me in the things that i'm doing because why it takes its presence for it to bring the change that we have need of it takes his presence to change us into the things that he would like us to do he came in this last age he gave us a new name but the only way we can bring the manifestation of the bride name is we have to come into his presence in fact it says that we have to be one with him he's saying that the harmony has to exist he says that he know that for the name to be manifest we have to come to a place where there's a union where we've known him we've come face to face why because he's the only one who can tell you what the name means i mean let's stand this morning says he says now he had divided the land and there were 12 tribes to divide it by it says now what if he had some picked up the the the pats and what if he had a tribe of god better than he did the tribe of ephraim the tribe of joseph better than he did judah but he didn't do that he didn't do it that way he divided it according to the word revealed by his spirit he divided it according to the tribe and notice notice he had done it by revelation by discernment by discernment of god's spirit in it he says each of those hebrew mothers giving giving birth to those babies called their name and each their name each of the name has a meaning jacob when he was born being a twin she called him supplanter but when he had gotten overcoming power and wrestle with an angel god changed his name from jacob to israel it prince the name has a meaning to do with your life when peter fisherman over had overcome by his faith in jesus he said your name is simon but i'm going to call you peter which is a little rock [Music] it changes you and it says and it changes you your name has something to do with it and your placement in life [Music] now i want you to realize that joseph had a joseph but jacob had a different placement in life but he couldn't get there as long as it was jacob [Music] he was to be the father of nation and do great things and all those things he was to be there and and and become one a princess powered with god and out of him and and how that the the the tribe and how the view of the children can come and all those things but none of that could come until he was changed and i want to say this it's very important we realize we cannot move into the blessings or in the place that god has placed for us in the place where god has called us to be unless we accept this name change this dying to ourselves this coming face to face to an angel this touching i want to say this when jacob where here is jacob physically speaking he had less of an art to win when he meets esau why because now he's even handicapped by meeting the angel [Music] the angel touches him and he touches the hollow and he goes back worse off physically speaking but oh my just like the angel said his name was no longer jacob but it was changing to israel and he stood there knowing that jacob had already died i'm going to meet esau as israel he knew that he was no longer jacob going there he didn't go over there he didn't matter what happened to him what mattered to him is he met the angel what mattered to him is he met god what mattered to him that he knew that he was changed he was no longer the same person that he used to be but my sister what matters to us is not what people think about us it's not what we were or what we can do as a human and everything what mattered this morning is i've come into the presence of god my life has been changed i'm no longer the same person you can call me all you want to you can say all you want to i know this is not the same person that you're meeting right [Music] and the same god who changed the name the same god will fight your battles the same god who changed your name the same god will take care of the circumstances the same god who changed you the same god will take care of all your needs [Music] the challenge is it seems like we want to keep our names we want to keep doing what we're doing he's saying no i want you to die there's a new name that i have for you and in the new name it's i've given you a new name but it's for me to come into that name and manifest what i need to manifest through you let's just my head this morning our gracious father we're so thankful lord for everything you do for us lord from the bottom of my heart this morning this is just not a sermon to preach and do but this is a desire of my heart lord that lord that the old me may die lord lord that i may die and receive the new name lord lord i'm tired of seeing myself and looking at myself over and over over and over [Music] but lord you say that if i come face to face with you lord that you'll be able to kill it and bring it anew and i pray this morning father that you do it according to your word oh god lord that if there be any desiring this morning that would die to ourselves and be born a new lord and father your prophet said it's not the new isn't it's not the old made over but it's a new creation everything about it is brand new nothing of it reflects the old one that's what we desire low this morning to be brought into such a presence where this man can be killed every day this man can be killed and die every day where we can rise every day father in the newness of christ help us father lord that we can stay in your presence every day to cause about the change that we have need of we love you we commit everything we are to you and ask those things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen let's just sing that as brother cosman come this morning amen [Music] jesus your grace [Music]

world can satisfy jesus oh jesus [Music] is [Music] amen what a wonderful service this morning i i was just thinking as brother billy was preaching this morning the importance of of his presence in our life because this presence at the asthma it's the atmosphere where our seed could grow you know you can have the sun you could have the seed in the ground but unless it's that proper atmosphere for the seed to take place and the rain to be able to fall on the ground and soften the ground and the sun when it shines upon it now the seed could produce the manifestation and not only any any manifestation but it's it's no longer i that liveth but it's christ that liveth inside of me how many people could how many of you could say that this morning that is no longer i that lives but i want christ to live inside of me and when i leave this place i can take this atmosphere with me i can take this presence with me and we can profess marxist mark 16 doing this in his name because we carry his name amen i have this on my heart this morning sister laura if you want to just come sing the song for us uh my redeemer lives i was just thinking of the words when brother billy was talking about the sun and the sea and how he puts things in in orbit and how things just are so beautiful in his eyes hey man let's just sing this morning [Music] who taught the sun where to stand in the morning who told the ocean [Music] where to hide till evening whose words alone can catch a falling star i know [Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] my is [Music] justify [Music] one more time oh the very same [Music] to bring [Music] [Applause] is [Music] one more time [Music] is [Music] [Music] my [Music] and pour your spirit out on me fall just like the rain saturate my thirsty soul come and fall afresh on me fill my cup again [Music] and heal my heart and make me [Music] lord i seek you help me find [Music] find my triumph broken thirsty [Music] far away from [Music] me [Music] saturate my thirsty soul come and fall afresh [Music] for your spirit [Music] just like the rain [Music] my thirsty soul come and fall [Music] heal afresh heart and make me holy [Music] i remember the darian if you just wanna come dismiss us this morning amen [Music] heavenly father we're humbled grateful father that you spoke to us this morning in the way that you did

god we know it can change any any circumstance if you went down to death hell in the grave and took the keys from the enemy lord how much more can you do that for us help us lord as we take home this little liquor fire that you've provided once again for us this morning to be reminded lord god for even through this day that lord you are with us and you promised you'll be with us even in us you'll
