========================================

just a little late sometimes someone was buying very violent not it had to go at that time policy were very very bad and drove all the way from Michigan sheriff to call and so forth that they were very very bad now let's sort of be alright nothing cool everything's under control and select fine when the lord comes in everything's under control he didn't he is so good to think of his goodness and his mercy but what he means to uh how precious is his crazy well we tried to start saying that we would take the first three chapters of the book of Ephesians I think we got the first three words or the first three something they have we didn't get very far but maybe tonight we can bitch'll along a little further now I want to say that I am NOT a Bible student by long ways and a long way from being a theologian but I love the Lord and I love deserving and someone just emergency said just before we go on now a little girl and the hospital in lowland all the best specialist has given her up she's dying now and asked requests for this child as Christians it's our duty to though our heads now for prayer our gracious Lord is not only our duty but it is our privilege and it is our desire that we bow our heads tonight as a church as a group I've called out believing people here tonight to teach thy word positionally placing us into the body that were we belong and where we can work fitly together as members of the body of Christ and now it is called upon us to go immediately to God and each of us father's think set of what if that was our little girl how arts would burn and hurt within and we would call to the churches to immediately have prayer and some Father's heart is burning aching Lord made that great person all the Holy Ghost come just now to that Father's heart take away every shadow of doubt and every ache and let him know that our God and there's no disease can stand in our presence when dodgy buying Commission has been carried out by the church and our people and as through the week we praying senseiess Sunday I have taught on these ways are these means of prayer we do not have very much of a weapon as far as it looks to the world but this little slingshot is deadly when it's held in the fingers of faith o Lord may our prayers like home that death yonder thats hanging over that child and may it be shattered the darkness gloom voice in the bedside of that infant - that baby or child little girl may the great light of God's presence shine upon it may it come from that hospital of well child God we know just across the river our loved ones wait and it is glorious but we love our little ones and we pray Lord that for your glory that you'll spare the life of that child we as your church rebuke that death and say stand still yonder and you can't take that child because we claim it's right for the kingdom of God Satan grant these things Lord to go straight to the mark as we direct them in the name of Jesus Christ our Savior amen can we believe I don't know what I could do if I wasn't a Christian I just wouldn't want to stay any longer there's nothing to live far only to get other stains is the best that I know now tonight we want to just start a little background of our previous lesson and I will try to read the cause the entire chapter if I can tonight so Sunday morning I'll have to maybe push in both Sunday morning at night all right to try to get in this setting of what I want the church to see oh it's glorious to find your position and no one can do anything unless you know properly what you're doing what if you were going to be a have an operation and that was a young doctor that had just come from school that you had never had an operation before yet he was young and handsome and his hair was combed slick he was dressed very fine Natalie and everything and he said I've sharpen the knives and Oscar Isaac all the tools and things but you'd have a little funny feeling about that I really have an old doctor went through that operation many times before before I want to be cut on I want to know somebody not just out of school I want somebody with some experience and the best experience wanted I know to call on tonight is the Holy Spirit he's God's great physician and great teacher and is back drowning my message tonight still from Sunday sermon that yeah is they rejected Samuel with the word of the Lord and accepted Saul the son of quiche and rejected Samuel which represent the Holy Spirit because he only spoke as a spirit led him to speak and when he called their attention to it he said remember I've never said nothing to you in the name of the Lord but what the Lord brought it to pass neither have I walk misbehave early before you and no one can accuse me of sin I Jesus said it we can condemn me of sin he and he said again that I have not come to you and begged you for money and so forth I've tucked nothing from you but all that I have said has been for your good that I brought to you from the mouth of the Lord and all the people give witness that's true all that's true but still we want to have a king we want to be like the rest of the world now tonight our scripture is dividing the book of Ephesians is the book of Joshua of the New Testament it's dividing up and setting in order the overcome one hour just a background for a few minutes to get a place before we start reading beginning with the third verse now we find life Sunday night that the God in the Old Testament had made Israel a promise of a land of rest because they had become Pilgrims and wanders and they were in a land that wasn't theirs God had promised to Abraham that his soul journey his seed would sojourn for 400 years and a strange people be mistreated but boss and he had bring them out into a goodly land that was flowing with milk and honey and now when the time of the promise drew nigh God raised up someone to bring them to that land I mean into place not who that one watt knows who that one was Moses notice a very very real type of our one that was given to bring us to the promised land Christ now we have a promise because who our promise is spiritual rest where there's was physical rest and so they was coming to a land that they could say this is our land we are no more wanders we settle down this is our land and here we have rest we'll plan our car our vineyards and we'll eat from our vineyards then when we pass home we'll leave it to our children oh how we could go into the land of it there are laws of inheritance like the OMA Ruth Boaz bring all that back how a brother in Israel how did he must anything that he had lost must be redeemed by a kinsman oh how beautiful it would take weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks we'd never leave this chapter you're going to it we just tie the entire Bible right into here right into this one chapter and all I just love to study it we used to take it and take it for a year and a half but never leave a boat just stay right with it now but it was such a great thing that's the inn how it was that an inheritance in the land that no one else but a close kinsman could redeem that inheritance now let me just jump over a little token here that I touched on in the night to you mother how many of these prayed for your loved ones lost all right there you are again see your inheritance think Paul told the Roman said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved you've got faith enough for your own self to be safe have faith enough no matter how wayward that four years of a girl is they'll be saved anyhow God somehow if he has to lay him on their faculty in your hospital dying they'll be saved God promises the inheritance when they shall be there said Isaiah oh they're all Springs with them they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the Lord all got a little spot I hope I can get you tonight for you just burning in our oh that comes back to that but now on forward then did you notice Moses that great miracle performer that's brought down Israel down through the land and brought him up to the promised land but did not place their inheritance to them he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but Joshua divided the land to the people that right and Christ brought the church up to the place the were their possession made to them was given to them just the Jardin to cross but the Holy Spirit is the one who sets the church in order the Joshua of today putts the church in its order giving to each one gifts places position and he is the voice of God speaking to the inner man that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit how do you get that much of it now we're getting over into the book of Ephesians how the same way he's positionally placing the church where they blow a Josh we placed them in the natural and now the Holy Spirit is placing the church positionally in the land that's a in the position that they belong in their inheritance now the first thing he starts off here he addresses his letter Paul which we're going to find out H allows that all this mystery was revealed to him not in a seminary not by anything audience but it was a divine revelation all the Holy Ghost that God gave Paul knowing that the mystery of God he said that have been here since the foundation of the world had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit amongst the people were setting each one in order setting the church in position now the first thing Paul starts out here to tell the people is to get all the remember this is to the church not to the outsider it's the mystery and riddles to a man never able to understand goes over the top of his head he does no more know about it - nothing but to the church it's honey in the rock it's joy unspeakable it's a blessed assurance it's an anchor of the soul it's our hope and say it's a rock of ages' out of man oh it's everything that is good or heavens and earth will pass away but God's word shall never pass away but the man outside of Canaan knows nothing of it he's still wandering not saying it he's not a good man I don't say that I don't say the man even in Egypt's not a good man buddy until he has come over into this procession and the procession that the promise that was given to the church is not a natural iron but a spiritual and for we are a royal priesthood a holy nation then in this royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people called out elected chosen set aside the whole world is dead on the outside and we are led by the spirit sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God not a man but by the spirit all in love the whole thing is bundled up out this has been tried to be taught on many times no doubt what great theologian says struck a lot deeper than I could but the thing I want to try to get to you is this that a man that is in Christ with the Holy Ghost can bear with the man when he's wrong long-suffering gentle patient he's sweet humble faithful filled with the spirit never negative always positive he's a different person not just the man that we once had it if we shall if we had a US Methodist or when we shout if we was in the land that's good it's alright hopefully that's you then the Pentecost will come along speaking with tongues they had everyone spoke of towns had it I'll be there too but still we found out there's a lot didn't have it yet outer we are now coming to this great history that's been hidden since the foundation of the world and now being revealed in the right stage to the sons of God you believe that to be true that sons of God are manifested before we even go anywhere let's turn over to Roman's eighth chapter just a minute let me read you something see if this is this coming up to what I'm speaking of you now we go get Romans eight the nineteenth verse of the of the eighth chapter of Romans for the earnest expectation the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God with earnest expectations the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation see the manifestation what is the manifestations making known the whole world the Muhammad's over here they're looking for all right we're here these people we dad's up through had a mighty rushing wind we've had thunders lightnings with at all blood we've had all kinds of things but we fail to hear that little still small voice that attracted the Prophet the rest are all browning them walked out said here my lord see how the whole creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestations are the sons of God now Paul is going to first place the church exactly work its belong now just to get the background let's read again all an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints that's just sainted ones which are at Ephesus and the faithful in Christ Jesus I so the class won't forget it how do we get in Christ do we join the church to get in Christ do we make your profession to get in Christ do we be immersed in water to get in Christ how do we get in Christ first Corinthians 12 chapter for by one spirit one capital SBIRT which is holy spirit we are all baptized into the promised land in this promised land everything belongs to us in the promised land seed for the Cullens think everything in the promised land when Israel crossed over this Jordan into the promised land fall down everything I remember in this promised land that don't mean that you're immune from sickness that don't mean that you're immune from troubles but it does spell this oh thank you it says this that it's your just rise and take it what and remember the only way that Israel is the man is what's in got the camp that's the only way we can ever lose a victory it's for seeing to get into camp something wrong somewhere when Athens stole that where Jeanette Babylonian garment scene that's in the camp and the battle went wrong you give me this father's Church tonight this group of people perfectly perfectly in the promise of God with the Holy Ghost walking in the spirit I'll challenge any disease or any of fiction or anything this area's ever Joe Lewis there is in the country with all of these infidelity and all the unbelievers that there is to bring any sickness or affliction in this storm it'll walk out of here perfectly old yes sir God gave the promise all these stain of unbelief can keep it away now we're going to get down to what this little stand is after awhile now that are in Christ Jesus grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ is a Christ when we are in Christ we have spiritual blessings outside of Christ we have sensations in Christ we have positive blessings not make bleach not shams not put on but as long as you're trying to say that you're in the promised land or not your sins will find you out and the first thing you know you'll find yourself thrown in and all as we call it in the world gone down you'll find out that you haven't got what you're talking about but when you're in Christ Jesus he's promised you heavenly peace heavenly blessings heavenly spirit everything is yours you're in the promised land and in full possession of everything a man how beautiful all let us study according as he has chosen us now here's where the church stumbled so bad according as he has chosen us in him in whom Christ we find out not a vacuum and Genesis added revelations revelation 17:8 that he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world now the word Amira's a Nixon foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him having predestinated us now I want to stop on that word of predestination now predestinated isn't safe I'll choose from there I won't choose brother dealers that isn't it it's the foreknowledge of God that node which one would be right and which one wasn't right so about for knowledge God knowing what he was going to do he predestinated by his foreknowledge to make all things work together for the good to them that love God that he might in the e age that is to come in one which is Christ Jesus let me draw you a little illustration here it's good we go back I bet I talked on a little bit Dylan I just struck it in Genesis the first chapter 126 when God called his name the Lord God it's in the Word of L Li Elohim which means this self existing one there was nothing else existed for him there was no air there was no light there were no war sighs there was no world there was no nothing else it was God and God alone hello Li L owe him now he made that inside all that was attributes which means that he was a inside of this great l li elohim was on after viewed r8 so you know what an attribute is all right let me say it like this or the nature that's oh the little feller will forget it I'm one of the little feller that get it that way inside of him was the nature to be a father but he self-existence dream nothing for to be a father by and now down inside of that was something else that he was God and a God is an object of worship but he was self-existence él ella ella ella him so there was nothing to worship him inside of that he was a savior there's nothing lost to be saved inside allowed he was the healer now do you get the picture so his attributes his nature Purdue's what is today some people say well why did God to stop it in the beginning he's a cruel-hearted a brute said Joe Louis that's wanted condemned Joe are jackhole think that he's just a crew heart and brute there's no such a thing is gone if there was such a thing you'd be a oh I just told him all kinds of names see but it's just because he might have a lot of knowledge up here but he ain't got nothing down here that's resetting this word tells it years and he's hid it and these mysteries has been hidden now remember the Bible said since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God to display them to the church you get it down I stopped on the story just a little bit or I'll bring I'll go to my next stop till get this I remember all through the ages of Moses back to the ages of the Prophet back to all ages they've waited until this latter days for these things to be displayed according to the scripture drive for it to be revealed to the sons of God why from the lost until like the pier maidens I have said building kosher closer closer as I've often made this remark and said God made three Bibles the first one he put it in the sky the zodiac Jefferson's zodiac what is the first figure in the zodiac the Virgin wopsle a sticker in the zodiac Leoline he come the first time to the Virgin he comes a second time as the Lion of the tribe of Judah in a sea he made the next one in the pier means back in the days of Enoch on the major pyramids and they major my don't understand it but to the wars where these stupid to all their needs for so long and could major the distance of the wars you're one of the major to now come across the King's Chamber and as this spear made went up we could not build it with everything that we got today we couldn't build it it's built right up like this to a point and the stone on the capstone never was found they never did put a cap on top of the pyramid I don't know whether you know it or not the big peer made of Egypt had never had a top stone on why the capstone was rejected Christ the headstone thing was rejected but as we grow from the Lutheran age Baptists age Methodists age Pentecostal age will right up to the capping stone now waiting and longing for that tapping stone to sit down the building's complete and not you ready to scripture the stone was rejected course we realize that was talked to the Solomon's Temple but the rejected stone has become the chief of the corner but I'm saying this only to make a picture to you now and in the Bible we're living in the last days the top of the pyramid the cross species of the cancer age in the zodiac in the time of the coming of the over line in the capping stone and in the days all the manifestations all the sons of God [Applause] you what we're at we're right at the end time how many's gonna read the paper this week what fruits all Sam said yeah well they're ready so are we oh really draw a day if the Christians could only realize the day that we're living in mine why do you think the writer of this book that's seen it and see where it would be manifested in the last days waiting and groaning for those sons of God to rise in the last days without power of the Holy Ghost at the index page they'll reveal the secret things for the foundation of the world to bring it up now let's go back into the foundations of world again you get a revelation to see if we were riding on I hope I don't make myself sacrilegious by calling God Papa but I want to say it that way showed you understanding pop Papa wanted some children so what did he do he said let there be angels and they come around me oh that's fine they worship him then he was God the attributes never he was el y el Ella Elohim self-existence nothing but he him the first thing come around with angels that angels could do to more than worship it couldn't be lost so they couldn't be sick they were mortal bees so he couldn't display his healing power he couldn't displayed salvation so then before that after that he said we'll make something tangible so he made her earth and when he made the earth he made all the creatures of the earth and then he made man everything that come up out of the earth starting off with a a Polliwog or jellyfish just the form of flesh floating on the water starting from there to from that to a frog which is the horse type of life that we can find the claim as the Frog high type is human being from the Frog who started to the lizard from the lizard on and on and on and every pond the Holy Ghost begin to breathe life come again great life and the first thing something come up in the image of God that was a man nothing has ever been never was never will be created any more anything higher than a man because a man is in the image of God see then man when he made his first man now when he made his angelic piece he made man created either a male and female all in the same unit he was both man and woman fiendish and masculine when he made Adam and put him in flesh remember in Genesis 1 he made man and woman and in Genesis 2 there was no man yet to till the soil flesh man the old man that could take a hold of anything and till the soil that yet there was a man in His image and God is a trying see he made the first man mantasy they have created Heat damn now when he made the first man I remember all together he had it in his mind and Sunday night I went to that of our word is a thought expressed God thought how he could be God how he could be worshiped how he could be a healer hi could be his Savior and his soon as he spoke the word it was finished forever Oh if these sons of God master good holy lay hold of that word like that when God speaks the word is absolutely he might awaited chronology says that our archaeologist and all they claim it may be the world with millions and millions of minute I don't know we're part of in trillions and trillions of years I don't know how long it was God does not exist in time even he has not one minute less time than he did when he spoken today he is still guarded there so cavity I never knew that like that so the other night another morning rather eternal no yesterday no tomorrow it's all now German or war I am NOT a lodger I will be it's eternal I am always now but he wanted to put things in time he had to make something to worship so his attributes produced this then he made the man then in this man he looked lonesome so non to show now his great mine why he had a picture of the Christ in the church he tough not a different piece of clay and made a woman but he took from the side of Adam a rib and took from the spirit of Adam the feminist and put it in the Sharia when you see a man that acts like assistant is something wrong and when you see a woman would act like a man there's something wrong there's something wrong they are two different spirits all together but together they make one unit these two are wrong so he made woman and man and they never wash to be old never die never get grave never they eat they drank they slept just like we do but they never know what's in love now I bought a pass right here for another lesson sometime on the seed of the serpent which they asked me to recall that let me see somebody come show me something different but I will know now well then after all this then when since idioms what takes place way off yonder above a million hundred million miles there's a space that be and that is perfect a gobble love every time you make a step this way it narrows an inch and you know how little it would be time it got to the earth it's the shadow of the shadow of the shadows that's what you have that's what I have a shadow of shadow of shadows of a Gothel love there's something in you there's something in every woman the other past twenty and something that ever man in your past twenty that was long to remain you've only got five years that's from fifteen to twenty after twenty you start dying but from 15 you're just an adolescent child so there and then you mature it up to your 20 and 8 to 20 or you said this is good a man you just say that but you're not you're dying and you're burning away no matter what you do God made you up let age but then you're going to die now what happens now you start died but in there there's something in you that says I want to be 18 again I wanna ask you something what if you was born five hundred years ago and you remain 18 years old until today if you would be an antique well your ideas are 500 years ago before the Pilgrim Fathers ever come over here and you were a young lady with that kind of idea why you'd be better off just went ahead and got over there five hundred years see there's something wrong you say well right now I feel pretty good for the family oh I'm 18 I'm 16 I feel good honey let me tell you something how do you know that your mother's a living at this minute if she's not in this church how do you know that your boyfriend didn't get killed just a few minutes ago or your a girlfriend how do you know that in the morning there won't be a corpse in your house how do you know you're going out of the church tonight alive it's such an uncertainty there's nothing certain if you're 15 12 19 75 or 90 there's everything's uncertain you don't know where you're standing but yet you longed to go back to 15 18 what makes you do that now if you go back to 18 and remain there and never be sick and never be you'll have to have other people with you because you'd outgrow it see people go on in other ages and you'd be an antique you'd be worse than you would be if you went or with them but there's something you call us ready to be there that's that little a gospel that little shadow that makes you something about here now the other night or the other morning at 7 o'clock when the Holy Spirit by His goodness and His grace taking me from this body I believe I believe yes or no I don't say and entered into that land and saw those people and they were all young and I've seen the prettiest people I ever seen in my life and he said to me some of them was 90 years old they're your converse no water they're screaming my brother in our brother now that is a celestial bomb that when we die we don't become a miss we become a body if we had ever one died if the atomic bomb would blow us up at this minute and five minutes and how we'd be shaking my mother's hand [Applause] carrying on and clarifying guys yes sir brother and sister Spencer sitting here I guess one of the oldest couples in here would be 1820 years old I'd be a young kid with this hesitation be dissolved we have one already waiting final little baby drops from its mother as a natural birth its little bodies are twisting in those legs of jumping and so forth excuse the expression you young women but when it does it's got life muscles or jerking but when it comes to the earth the first thing it catches its breath and there is a spiritual body of nature to come into that baby right man it'll take it's the road in route against its mother's best and begin to nurse if it didn't do that the milk would not even come down Jever knows the cat when it's born as soon as they can get a strength milk it on his face who tells it walks right around to some other such route around and starts nursing ah ah when this earthly body is brought here there is a spiritual body pretty far and as soon as this [Applause] [Music] Welli tabernacle of our habitation be dissolved there is one waiting honor just as soon as we step out of this room we step into that one one with the water cold red water don't hang no need of a drink of water one that don't eat the dust of the earth but their justice real Incan yield and shake hands and just loving everything is perfect and that body is waiting honor is part of it the Shriya you begin your eternal life right here at the altar here's where you start eater you start eternal life right here then you are born again son of God ever and then when you die you begin when your death strikes you in this body and the heart quits beaten and the mortal wheels begin to stand still that little shadow that was the shadow of the shadow and one second it becomes a shadow of the shadow then the next becomes the shadow then the next two becomes a little treacle then the next it becomes a creep then this becomes a rhythm the ocean and after while you're standing in the presence of your loved one any other clothes in the garments of a celestial body that you know one another love one another you've come back to man and young woman again it waits there until the coming of the Lord Jesus and some days that glorified body of this I remember that is a celestial body not a glorified a celestial body and someday that celestial body will leave heaven with Jesus far say listen to you for that confess lines the fifth chapter or first Thessalonians fifth chapter one of the other I'll say to you I would not have you eat your present concerning those that are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe I died rose again the third day even so those asleep in Christ will God bring with thee for we say this unto you by the commandments of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not birthday at our hinder the best words hinder those which are asleep for the office of the Lord shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first these celestial bodies come down and put all earthly glory by bodies and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of rod and shall be caught up together with them [Music] I will not drink of the fruit of the binary the war until I either the new with you in my father's team and the wedding supper for the three and a half years the Antichrist finishes up his reign the whole world is destroyed the chooser called out Joseph makes itself known to the Gentiles or to the Jews remember when Joseph made himself known to the Brethren that it wasn't one Gentile present when he set you

Bar this fella uh we we all just killed our brother Joseph the Jews senior they have made a mistake now in Christ when he's making yourself go to him and Joseph was so full he had to eat nearly so he dismissed his wife and his children and all the guards and everything else and sent him to the palace exactly right and then in the presence of the Jews he said I'm Joseph your brother [Applause] brother and then they fell and beginner Trimble said now we know we'll get it because that we killed our brother we said we killed our brother nice great king he said God did it for a purpose to save life that's exactly the reason God did it to save us Gentiles but the Gentiles was in the past be rejected all these brother Joseph he took all the bride and the bride wasn't it I'm not a Jew all right now were you getting to now after we put on this glorious bond and the free age that is to come when this glorified body this celestial body has been made a glorified body you get one of me now

nothing could I do there is a thing I produced look he predestinated me he called me he chose me I never chose him he chose me he chose you he chose all of us we didn't choose him jesus said you didn't choose me I chose you he said no man can come to me except my father cause he first and all the father's given me will come to me and none of the outs that prints on tradition it fulfilled the Scriptures see seven all the father's given me will come to me I won't get to lacing them and I never got all this I got started on this ship let me hurry up I gotta get this up right here just right quick nine we hurry I got to get back to this adoption just a minute oh when you forgive me just for just for a minute let's get this your son these people are always in George's your hook this for the money bless their hearts now I better Georgian in Texas and wherever you're from listen to this fifth less linger on in a few minutes having predestinated us unto on to what does the word on to me the word unto it means that something we're coming to unto I have going on to the founders I'm going on to the chair I'm going on today I he predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself our courting is is drawn good pleasure of his will how much pleasure whose pleasure wasn't whose goodness his own his own good pleasure of his own will now what is adoption ah let me get this now I don't know whoo I won't have time to get this but I'll here then she's a question you can hear ask me a little later on sometime in a message stomach listen your adoption is not your birth your adoption is you're placing when you were born again john-117 of youth when we are born of the Spirit of God we are sons of God but we were three destinated here's what I'm trying to get you to for this sons of the last day you see today see we were predestinated to on to adoption oh here we are I this what her spin across go a little they say I got born again praise the Lord I'm totally good your child of God that's right but yes daddy what I'm talking about see you were predestinated unto adoption adoption is praising a son I'm too close to that called thank you told me that I get too close which came here in the back I am see a child how many know the rules of adoption the Old Testament look a son was born I believe I got into some determine what is that GU members 14 oh uh uh struck on it oh yeah I got here he him hearing of the adoption of children now in the Old Testament went on what a child was born in a family he was a shy when he was born because he was born of his parents he was a son all the family and heir of all things now but this son was raised by tutors the Galatians if chapter 72 25th verse all right he was raised by - razor teachers now for instance divide a son born now say I'm the father and that's reasoning that King James come and ever thought that riddle for funny in the King James Version said in my father's house as many mansions a house many mentioned see really in the in the days of the Bible translated for King James a house was a domain in my father's domain is many mansions not in a house mansions but he was called the father of this domain they had it very biblical in the Bible that's what it is want a father had a great big dog major farm or something others he had a bunch of people living over here water bottle the layin yet some little deer things here goes to the end stop taking care of fuels and different safety you just had a big Kingdom and he got on his little donkey he rode around each one to see now they get along the sheep shearing everything like eating their time you can hear me a walk waiting there oh gotta stay back here can you hear me alright now here watch erode away and went away trying to to take care of it is his kingdom so now he won't that son is going to be heir of everything and he's God he's there and when we reformed in the kingdom of God by Jesus Christ we're era heaven joint heirs with Jesus because he took our place he became us sin that we might become him righteousness see he'd become me that I might become him see joint heirs with me alright and I remember that to each one of them I'll remember God predestinated you by for knowledge that you coming to this everybody understand raise your hand God bye for now predestinated you to come to the promised land what is the promised land for the Christian today it is raise up your hand if you know the promise isn't to you and to your children the same that our forum and it shall come to pass the lace8 say if God that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters and 28:18 priests it must be upon precept line upon line here a little bear little hole face of that watch good all with salmon lips and other tongues lot speak to this people and this is the rest is the rest [Music] the Sabbath land but I said that they should enter in June and for all this they would not hear hear see

that's right yes sir he's got eternalize DVD cyst on that tree of life from the Garden of Eden now see these people come up so close the universe in Hebrews six not going back to that but in Hebrew six these people once made for takers comes up close and it's tasted of the heavenly gift they sit around they sing Healy's done they've seen people in the power of God they see my taste but they

Son of God afresh and counted the blood of the Covenant or what they were sanctified with our own to church leaders sanctification that's good as far as it goes but you don't go far enough yes sir the

and drink beer and tells jokes it go on and carry all I got and call themselves members of church while they will take something like that and refuse the leadership of the Holy Ghost why the Bible said the Word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword of the heart thoughts of them are and if we love the world all the things of the world the love of God's not even in us they are called pure Josie [Music] and a few there will be there to find it many won't Kootenay on that day and center in the kingdom said Jesus with Abraham Isaac and Jacob but the chore of the kingdom to be chased out

all come around and said I want everyone to know that this is my job now I doubt myself I want anyone to know from henceforth that his names are dressing up a special dress on you and I want you to know and his name is just as good on any checks mommy miss ha ha ah stop him into my family although he's been my son since he was born since he received the Holy Ghost he's been my son but now I'm going to place him positionally in authority he fires his fog you say to this mountain don't doubt your heart but believe that what you said will come too fast you can have what you said the adoption is that they adopted the Sun Aintree had proved to be a everybody ever is by embracing a son now God did the same thing to his son we took Jesus up old man Transfiguration he took Peter James and John up there that's three witnesses of the earth there is Jesus Moses and Elijah God up on the mountain there they stood up the mountain and first thing you know they look and Jesus was going five before them that why titles as description what do you do he dressed me in the robe of immortality and he said its remit shine like the Sun that night and a cloud or shattered then Peter John then fell over face and then look and there's tipples there's no Elijah talking to me and Moses have been dead on a buried in an unmarked grave for 800 years and Elijah took a chariot ride to heaven 500 years talking do see he had taken Jesus up to see them to see what was all about see they're showing these things do they talk with him had a conversation with him there as soon as that Peter looked back again and the Gora fication was all for Jesus they seen Jesus only and a voice come from that cloud said this is my beloved son names yeah yeah that's it adopted our place son now that's what God is trying to get the Pentecostal church in the book of Ephesians see do you understand dr. pol the causes get you late see the kid is getting sleepy and I wanted to get down here to this verse I hear but I can't do it Joe the 13th first see the lacework CEO by the holy ghost of promise will get that funny look now what brings our Stephen Howard kept by this but now - please how are you your first born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost let me know that all right the next you are predestinated unto thee while adoption what is that your predestinated unto the play scene Oh sister Scott up in distance actually wound up moving a teaching going around somewhere in the world around different parts of countries I've heard of it Lots that Jesus is here order is walking around in a body becomes easy does this that's a lot this Holy Spirit here and he is trying to place his church to get his church in order placed it in the promised land so they could either solve it all the enemies to me drove our Manassas can take kids and I can't have a healing service for the half of the one that I brought and preached the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and Trinitarian present said oh he's old Jesus only I can't go where heaven is on human half of divine Healy's all right in charge the miracles of the Lord and say well I'll be better bands a prophet but let me tell you something as long as the Spirit is on him and he's discerning he's the Lord servant but his teaching is right it's no good whoever heard of such tommyrot [Applause] either God or is no God these are all God a nun God that's way it but how you gonna head Manassas won't keep his grounding if it won't keep Israel the multi pens down they're all run out here with the bliz scenes and all but we have been born by the Holy Ghost all of us is that nice why don't we be born to predestinated an edge of these born we are predestinated unto the adoption to be placed in the body of Christ you see what I mean what is the body of Christ some are apostles some are prophets some our teachers some are evangelists and some are pastors is that right we're taught to others get some tongue interpretation of tongues wisdom knowledge miracles working and miracles all these different gifts and I wasn't do they practice that a little bit one let it run loose just like I don't know one one raise up speak in tongues daily we're talking preacher be free to make all the calls of our is that if the preacher hands you all with his message be annoyed then it beats it all back sire Steve is because you're not talk about the spirit of the prophets are subject to the property God is the author of confusion I'm standing here on our ministry or the dawning of God no matter how much you want to speak with tongues you hold your pjs God spinachy-- there you speak with tongue it can't be just some repeating of scripture called God said don't use vain repetition but it's a message directly to somebody asked me one time put your finger on one time that's the Holy Spirit every round of the discernment told somebody repeat the scripture over and over it told him something that was wrong with them and something they have done and something that they must do or something had to happen or something like that is that right so is speaking in tongues and interpretation if there's one in the church that speaks with tongues another interpretive let us say this will raise up and speak with tongues and this brother you're giving interpretation then God's with you but how are we going to do it this way see it's just half hazard in point no placing at all now that's the Ephesians are trying see they miss that these are innocent we are predestinated unto the adoption of stuff imagine we're born in the Spirit of God sure and see the Holy Ghost we cry Abba Father hallelujah door that gobblers I try for children but we can't get no word we can't whoop duplicity look at Billy Graham stand over here that Muhammad is grooving look at that go stand down you're nuts eight years at Church of Christ shaking hands with baby is down there and take his hand I supposed to be a Christian and shaking hands with the devil like Joe Louis's a free thinker and even cussed God and said there wasn't such a thing is there God any how to begin with and things I get in a church they called himself a Church of Christ shaking hands with him and taking it sides of it's better Jack goal and the Pentecost was many a McGinty will never preacher our lamp order stood toe-to-toe with him said jump bend down your power there we are where it can't be played Ephraim don't want to stay I'm gonna do a car oats is your part to raise you just for third sheep when you're supposed to herd cattle God wants to place the church tell the thing about still got that goatee nature but but but but but but but thanks you can't tell him that's right is not true then you can't place the church see the church is forced to be predestinated unto the adoption of children where on man God can take a man and adopt him into the family give him something at first try that and see if it's right the Bible said tribe experience this man claims a certain things try and see if it's right if it's the right move right with them and say Lord send us something else keep moving see just keep moving never taking claims then you're going to see the Church of God beginning gets place then when the Philistines will go to pack enough the shorts of wall Carroll go down phases of the wars the guards will be missing that's right when the church begins getting to its mighty power when we have an Ananias and Sapphira you'll see we had a holy church stands together into this power positionally place the sons of God opted into the family of God powerful church standing areas glory that's what he's coming for see how far we are all brothers you can't even get together on scripture any man any man that tasty water baptism in the Bible in the name of Jesus Christ he's either blind or something and that's where the big five oh I'll tell any person that will bring me any scripture where anybody was ever baptized in any other name besides the name of Jesus Christ in the new church are these bad guys then the other way you had be baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ to get the Holy Ghost you come show me there's not go such there's no such a commission when Jesus said over there go ye therefore teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost neither one's a name none of them Peter turn right ten days later said repent be baptized every one of you name of Jesus Christ for the remission sins and everywhere in the Bible and then here was someone baptized down there some other way but John just some to repentance Paul said you got to be rebaptised again you got coming in alright we did that times are great holy man Johnny baptize Jesus I this is the gospel this is a fear of God person to be revealed to me I'm an apostle of the Lord and about angel from heaven comes and preaches anything else I me read that the Bible said if an angel Paul said if an angel from heaven said anything else Bishop Archbishop Pope overseer whatever he may be if he preaches anything else besides this that I preached unto you let him be accursed there's no we have no such custom to that culture you just is just no such thing you wait and then fancy why is it people can't see that why is it people won't don't believe that see somebody hears it predestination exactly oh the father has given me come to me hi exactly all the father has given me will come that will come to me what's about me trying to find here here we all right let me just read this first and then I'll tell you about all the things this is the very message on preach tonight here's what Paul said on predestination for water baptism Jesus name the Holy Ghost baptism the setting in the church and so forth here's what he says I'm Marvel telling these Galatians that you're so soon move from him they called you under grace cry I am so ashamed in other words that you let somebody come here twist you away from that aren't you another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ prevents the real gospel of Christ but what I remember it was Paul that constrained every person that had not been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to come and be bad guys over again in the name of Jesus Christ I mean over I adore this Paul that said these secrets have been incidents the foundation the world had been revealed to him that we were predestinated to be the sons in the other was Paul look at what he said but though we are angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse just don't say I don't agree with you mysteries let it be a curse let me read the next verse as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that we have already received let M be a curse right now brother sister if it was God the other day and I say that hoping not a river that taken me to see this little I get excited I don't get to get inside I just get blessed preaching I get to beside myself not keeping your tone oh you're sleepy and tired but o if you if you could only know how I want you over there and when I once I say this again when I only said I said it would do he said would you like to see what the end is and I'll look back and see myself laying there on the bed surely you've known me long enough to know that I'll tell you the truth I want to ask you something is Samuel said before the annoyance on have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord but what was true is that right always have I ever come begged you for money or anything like that never have have I ever did anything but tried my best to lead you to cry exactly now they want to say I'm a mental telepathy you know super sentient perception is of course them things has got to ride the Bible said they would as Jamison Jamis whispered Morgan they did further the same thing Moses is so they come to a showdown but remember jammies and jammies could not heal they could not heal make a brain plagues but not take them away see all right now God is the healer God's Word remains true I have tried to be honest with you I've tried to tell you the truth for about 31 years I've stood this pulpit off and on for 31 years and someday may leave go to glory to try this pulpit there's been a wife a daughter father brothers a whole baby right across there precious friends I've watched your casket in the flower bed here and know someday that mine will be too that's true but sincerely from all my heart I attend you with all my heart I believe I preached to use a true gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ I believe that you should be baptized every one of you name of Jesus Christ and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and whenever you do it'll bring to you a joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience faith and the other day what happened to me on that horny I don't know I can say yes whether I was here at my body and you see the vision a were lost taking away from here over there I don't know I can't say all the thing I know that I I was always afraid of dying that little place of thing but not phrases Jesus would come get me now I weren't afraid of that well I didn't feel that but if I bleach and just be a little missus flying out to the hair but I see now and I've seen those people they were real yeah and they were people who once associated me here on earth even to my first wife she wasn't my wife she was my sister she never called me her husband she called me her darling brother there was no sex no feelings of that type it couldn't be it was perfect it was sweetness it was perfection I'm wondering I don't know I'm wondering is that what she sees before she left the earth when she was young in a hospital when I call her and she said Billie you had breached it you talked about it but she said you don't know what it is she said I have no more desire I wonder if that's what it is is that godly saintly old man of FF Bosworth who stood in this moping who's preaches me around different parts of the world all air fare
