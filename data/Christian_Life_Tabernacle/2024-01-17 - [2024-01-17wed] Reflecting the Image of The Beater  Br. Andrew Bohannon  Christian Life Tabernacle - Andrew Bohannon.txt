the your hand move on his sister and Lord that you could touch her and Lord bless all the services the word that would be spoke tonight into your faithful hands in Jesus Christ name amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles and you want to turn with me we're just going to go into a little thought that the Lord put on my heart and then we'll start there in Exodus really been happy with uh the way the Lord's moved on the ministry you know it's it's uh it's just an amazing thing to see how God's Building us up in his word amen in Exodus we're going to go to chapter uh 25 and we'll start in verse 16 we'll read through to 22 amen EX Exodus CH 25 and verse 16 it says this and thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee and thou shall make a mercy seed of pure gold two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half of the breath thereof and thou shalt make two cherums of gold of beaten work Thou shalt make them in the two ends of the mercy seat and make one cherubin on the one end and on the other gerbon on the other end even of The Mercy Seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof and the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high covering The Mercy Seat with their wings and their faces shall look one to another toward The Mercy Seat shall the faces of the cherubims be and thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat above upon the ark and in the ark Thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee and there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from Above The Mercy Seat from between the two cherubim which are upon the Ark of the testimony of all these things shall I give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel amen we also want to read in job and in job 23 you know I was just thinking about you know in trials and testings you definitely think about job and his patience and how he definitely um you know went through some trials and I know we're going through some trials amen you know just want to encourage your faith you know we're all going through some something and if you're not you might want to see if you're even you know put into the Battle of service yet you know it's just one of those things it's a guarantee as a Christian soon as you make your stand for God all the devil's guns are trained on you so we think it not strange but here in job 2 uh3 it looks like we'll start there in uh verse 10 he saids says but ye know the way that I should take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his step his ways I have kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desires even that he doeth for he hath performed the thing that is appointed for me and such things are with him therefore I'm troubled at his presence when I consider I'm afraid of him for God maketh my heart soft and the almighty trouble me because I was not cut off from before the darkness neither was he covered the darkness from my face and one more scripture if you don't mind we'll read in John chap 12 John 12 we'll start there in verse 20 this is um after the supper of of Bethany Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead and they uh had a service for or a meal a supper and Lazareth was at the table uh Martha was serving and Mary brought the big old pound of this Spike nerd and made this great testimony how she uh washed his feet with this Spike nerd and Jesus and and some of his disciples they saw this they heard it and they kind of marveled and and Judas you know he came to that place where he said you know this could have been uh uh you know sold and given to the poor and you know it was it was something that was on her heart to do for the Lord and you know it was uh you know something that caused a reaction from Judas to run out and now you know because the scripture says he was a thief and you know my you just think about all these wonderful scriptures but here he comes in the triumphal entry and um we'll pick it up here in the story it says and there was certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast and the same came therefore to Philip which was of bedda of Galilee and Desiring him saying sir we would see Jesus Phillip cometh and tth Andrew and again Andrew and Phillip tth Jesus and Jesus answered in saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it but he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it until eternal life if any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man Shall Serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause shall I for this cause unto this hour father glorify thy name then came a voice from Heaven saying I have glorified it and will glorify it again and the people therefore that stood by heard it they said it thundered and others said an angel spake to him and Jesus answered and said this this voice came not because of me but because for your sakes now is the Judgment of the this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and if I if I be lifted up from Earth will I draw men unto me amen we trust the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats you know it's um real special to be a a assembled together and to be a part of a body you know where God can come and he can he can strengthen us as a body you know this is not a oneman Ministry this is every part every person doing their part we all have to come prayed up we all have to come with the expectation we all have to repent we all have to do what's right in the sight of the Lord you know and one of the things that I I just I was so grateful for and and I just appreciate everybody's testimon and something that stood out to me on watch Night Service is you know our brother Roger was saying that you know this is a year of Victory you know and I really believe that with all my heart there's things that are are burdening people but I believe victories around the corner you know and I believe that faith is our Victory amen if if we could just get down hone down and lay everything else to the side and cry out for faith that's what God Said through his prophet he said more than anything we should pray for Revelation amen and I say sometimes Lord you know I just kind of get into the routine in my prayer life and I just kind of you know go about what I think I need but if I'll just go back to what the prophet said and just pray for Revelation amen and so one of the things that I realize is you know a lot of times we just say like with the testings and the trials enough's enough you know I just don't really want to be in this season anymore and I love how David Avid junr said don't despise the season that you're in I really appreciate that because you know there's a lot of times where you're going through something and you're just saying I just want to get on the other side of this I don't want to have to go through this struggle but listen Church there's no shortcuts with God we must endure while we have time we must take the word of God and pray God the spirit to Quicken The Word of Life to us we must hold forth to the Word of Promise and I was thinking about how you know it's in the times of testing it's in the times of trial that God can become a reality you know it's it's in those valleys of decision you know just like job said there he came to that place where he was going through a lot but there was something inside of him that he knew he come God's provided way he knew he came from he he walked according to what the sacrifice that God said that he must keep he kept his commandment he kept his word and that was his stand and his testimony he says when I come out of this I'm going to come as pure gold he's identifying himself with deity that's what gold is representative of you know I just before I get too far going I just wanted to share kind of the inspiration of what I wanted to share with you but this was out of a message called the reproach for the cause of the word and when Matthew was preaching um Sunday a couple evenings ago he mentioned you know like what Lord put it on his heart what are you looking at and um you know he' referred to when brother brandham um you know those seven vision Visions or the seven dreams and then he ended up having it and he came to a place you know our Prophet suffered a lot you know he talked about in this message how that the the power of God Came Upon him and I don't think we could ever understand or Con in our mind how he suffered but the man came to a place where he was numb all over and and you know we just have to believe it by faith that he was a special built birth to bring us a message you know and and as he was sharing some things out of this message it began to encourage my heart because just like those Greeks they wanted to see Jesus you know and and you and I want to see Jesus not a historical figure not a something of the past but we want to see a present tense God because he's the same true am am in verse uh or excuse me in in paragraph 77 out of the reproach for the cause of the word brother brandham launches out and he says now God has a time and a reason for that time now I want you to personalize this in your life to fulfill his works all his Works God knows just EX exactly what he's going to do we don't we just have to we had to receive it as he gives it to us but he knows and there's nothing going wrong with what he's planned to do it has to all come out about there has to be sometimes rugged and hard things to only bring out the real true nature of an object you know rain is born out of the jagged ragged lightning stro thundering skies and if we didn't have rain we wouldn't live but you see what it takes to bring rain thunder lightning flashing anger and out of it comes rain that's good you know I want a Revival you know sometimes it takes the jagged lightning the the hard trials the squeezing out the pressing you know you just grab an orange and say Asher grab this orange and squeeze this Orange what's going to come out of that orange orange juice so sometimes you get a you get pressure and get squeezed on and then you begin to realize there's God in here I I wasn't even thinking to respond like this but that was Christ in me that was Christ in you you begin to see ah if it wasn't for this trial how would I see Jesus how would I see the same God the same Messiah still contacting and preserving Humanity it's not his will that man would perish he I would that all would be saved that none would be lost my think of it but it takes that to bring the rain we must die rot corrupt smell go back to the dust of the Earth in order to bring forth new life it takes the pounding of gold turn it over and over back and forth pounding until all the dross is taken out not because it shines because iron pyite what you know is fool's gold shines like real gold but you put them together you set them out one side and you can hardly tell them apart but put them together and you can tell it the beater always has to beat until he can see his own image reflecting in the gold and God sets a time and a p purpose for everything that he does there's nothing that just hap just accidentally to those who love the Lord and are called according to his calling we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because he cannot lie he said that it was so and everything has its time its season and it has its way and God is behind every move and sometimes you think everything's going wrong it's up to us right those things are put on us trials and wonderings it's testings to see how we will react to an action you know and I begin to think about this and I begin to ponder and the Lord just you know if if I was going to title the the message to you tonight I would title it you know reflecting the image of the beater you know and sometimes if it was if it was your decision or mine if you're anything like me I would not choose this beating right you know so so it's like as I begin to ponder how many times we Tred to run from the things that God's placing on our lap but if we'll just embrace it and not despise it then God he he will bring about what he promised amen you know I'm so grateful that God has provided a way for me to be in fellowship and it's the same way anybody comes in Fellowship right we don't have the corner on the market as it were you know if if you'll look to what Jesus Christ did and the work that he performed that's God's provided way of Fellowship that you know God said if you'll repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the birth the Holy Ghost amen isn't that wonderful right you know I just thought it would be good to run through and go through a few scriptures I I was amazed while I was studying just going through the scripture there's so much stuff that just begins to open up and you you just like praise God there's so much in the word of God for us and you know I think you know it it's it's Times Like These that you know if we can let go of some things of the world and just really show the Lord how much he means to us you know I I think this is an hour where you know God is looking for worshippers who will worship in spirit and in truth right and and we have the truth but a lot of times we are in another Spirit like my mind's so geared on uh something else you know we we're looking and we're feeding on this and we're feeding on that and it it occupies the real estate in our mind and so as much as we want to we're in the spirit of that and it takes really like you know I was just going through something with my eyes and something led me to realize that you know cuz everything in the natural types the spiritual and and you know a lot of things that has happened in technology and the world as Humanity not just us but it's targeted on us because the devil don't want you to come into maturity he's afraid of you you are on his Hit List he doesn't sleep he's come to church he's wanting to knock your your legs from under you he's wanting to punch the air out of you he does not want you to have that communion and fellowship with Christ where it'll be the same love it'll be the same hope it'll be the same Faith it'll be the same God moving in human flesh again it doesn't matter how old or how young what your problems are turn your eyes away from your problems and let's turn our eyes upon the Lord you know and I realized we do a lot of looking down you know right but the scriptures admonished us to look up when you see that day approaching you know there's a lot of struggles right there's a lot of things going on in this world that you just want to shrug your shoulders and look down but for the believer I say let's look [Music] up I this is something something very simple but this is something that the Lord dealt with my heart and I just said Lord help me I didn't bring my phone out here but I'll just use this can't use that but I I'll just say like for example if this was my phone a lot of times when we look at our phone we look down we're looking down and I believe that's a trap of the enemy so that you won't fulfill the scripture and not only s scientifically people are starting to come doctors are starting to come to this understanding that there is a blockage of blood flow from the head to the body there's a blockage of blood flow a Life Source there's too much toxins in our minds there's not enough time for it to release because we're looking down too much we need to let our head be lifted up stop looking at that device give it a rest let's look up to the promis giver if you have a gift in your life don't squelch it by looking at somebody else's gift that sold it to the world we want to look to Jesus Christ he's the author and finisher of our faith right we're not going to find it on some YouTube video we're going to find it in the promised word of God in the message of the hour let's look up Saints I was looking there's these these arteries and there's these veins there's like a jugler vein and a carded artery one sends the blood up the other one sends the blood back down and this is just this is just the way God fearfully and wonderfully made the body but there's a devil that knows you better than you know yourself he knows what you like he knows what what I like and he knows how to lay a snare and he entices he he he he throws a little this and a little of that and you taste it and you're like my that's just my taste that's just my flavor matter of fact get that at 70 degrees why don't you I mean we're guilty like a little inconvenience they didn't do it my way you know but the devil knows and that's just to get us red up in the carnal side but Jesus Christ is here to say I've given you a new birth I I have given you something that will declare some satisfying something it'll be like that woman at the well she'll come to that realization it'll be a reality like nothing else my people are under these pressures because there's too much toxins you know a man is not he wasn't made to die he wasn't made to feed on this kind of garbage and we're pouring it in pouring it in and we're not giving it enough time to detox what we need to do is let go we need to let God deal with our hearts why you know this is the thing that we can either humble ourselves to the realities of God or be humbled amen sometimes God will allow sickness because he's like look you're going astray I had to snap the legs of the one because he was taking a worldly way away from the shepherd amen you're his you ain't getting away right how much suffering do we want to go through I mean there's a measure of suffering that we're all going to go through because we're his but praise God I wasn't I wasn't saved to to just run off and do my own thing that never satisfied I tried it for years it just left an emptiness but praise God when he came in and I learned how to yield oh my how many can testify to it when you learn how to yield it brings forth a peace and a joy and a contentment I mean can can anybody say man when you've been used by God for somebody's soul my there's like Boo devil out of here you know it's like to see someone pass from Death to life there's no greater miracle I mean we love to see the sick who who who have been badly and healed but my when when your life had been submitted to God in such a way that God said I want you to go over here you you can just drop the mail off and then while you're there you say why would that person just oh excuse me ma'am you drop something and she just begins to tear up and all of a sudden you say you know there's a there's a God and he cares just a simple word you have a life inside that somebody you can change their whole world because of what's inside of you the life that you have bubbling within is a Fountain of Living water it's just will we contaminate that and just let it just be part of everyday life Lord let it not be in my life this is out of the church age book Ephesians Church age um this this is paragraph 55 he says so there they are full of the Holy Ghost and faith on fire with the fire of God holding forth the word of Truth and there he stands back them to back them up I think of it not one believer of any age never cried in his heart oh that I might be back there the first age when the apostles first went were sent out there is no need to look back look up Behold Him who is even walking in the midst of the churches throughout all the ages Behold Him who is the same yesterday today and forever who never changes in his essence or his ways where there where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in the midst not only is there in in his midst as a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is my he's in the midst of us and he's the life and sustainer and Giver of all good gifts to the church Hallelujah who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks how meaningful are those words when viewed in the light of the scripture which describes him as Christ who is our life for Christ indeed is the life and of the church she has no other life without him she is simply a religious Society a club a meaningless Gathering of people as a corpse bejweled and dressed is still a corpse so is a church no matter how her programs and her gracious efforts might achieve without Christ she is a corpse also but with him in her midst with him motivating her she has become The Wonder of all his body the fullness of him that filth all in all and this is the very hour that he is walking in the midst in the the in the last AG's golden Candlestick what he was as he walked in the first age he is even now in this last age Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever aren't you glad about that to be able to become the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filth all in all amen you know whenever I like to see if you know my tie matches or something sometimes I'll look in the mirror but mostly I ask my wife but but you know that's just what we want to do is look into the word of God and see if that Spirit man is looking at the right thing you know a lot of times all we see when we look at ourselves is we see failure and faults and shortcomings and problems and different things but I want to say this let's look to what he's saying about you about me about us with him motivating us now in this is um kind of a lengthy reading but I I feel it's important so in 57 says the seven golden candles sticks the the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to end ending she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifest the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God yes sir how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we accept it by faith for God has spoken it but not only is the candlesticks of gold it is of beaten gold handcrafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints which this the spe which is was were spirit-given outside of her Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever a people beaten and purged as the bride of Christ Jesus Christ surely she is filled up with sufferings that Christ had left behind her goods are despoiled her life is in Jeopardy she is counted as sheep for the slaughter she is killed all the day long she suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she cause hert others to suffer worthy of the Gospel is the lovely bride of Christ and as the gold is malleable wherein brass will break with its beating the gold of God will bear her suffering for the Lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and joy Forever by the trials and the testings of this life amen I think those are wonderful scriptures you know to encourage our faith that you know when you're going through something God's he's with us right you know I think about Moses he says you know hey you're going to go out there and he goes well if I'm going to have to to do all of that I ain't going unless you come with me if you're going through something and God knows that you got to go through it to get to that beaten goal that he can see his own reflection in my I don't want a shortcut I say God just walk with me you said you were walking in the midst of the church I believe it I am a recipient of that reality so I'm going to take this trial I'm going to take this thing and watch you make it a blessing there's no other thing cuz God's work his works are perfect he knows what we have need of my yeah I'm going to have to try to skip a little bit maybe yeah let's let's go right here and say in in ' 62 the first age suffered great persecution it had the works he had to work hard to preach the gospel and shed forth truth their High Calling in life was to serve God and when their hope in life were blighted they were patient and committed all to him who had promised the Everlasting recompense in heaven for what they had given up for on Earth and in 64 says no matter how just or upright a Christian is before the public or how gracious he is to his fellow men doing not but good let him confess Christ as the Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the Holy Ghost in tongues and prophecies healings and miracles and he will be condemned the this faith that we believe when you testify of it you will be condemned that's right think it not strange but the good thing is is when you're persecuted for his name sake there comes power so don't be don't be fearful fear not the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God and because it can overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells persecution and trials are natural normal part of a Christian Life there is only one thing that you can do about them there's only one thing commit them all to God judge not and leave the outworking and the final judgment to him Lord this is your word amen I believe it thou c not bear them which are evil and thou H has tried them that say they are Apostles and are not and found them Liars these Ephesians believe that God God's people ought to be holy according to this verse they took steps to keep the body unleavened from sin most evidently the uh apostasy had already started sin had entered into the church but they were obedient to the words of Paul when he said to put away the wicked from among them they were a separated people they had come out of the world and they were not going to let the world enter in among them they wouldn't put up with the sin in the church Holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life amen Lord help us you know I just I just thought as I was going through that with my eyes and it just you know a lot of times we pray and we even doubt our own prayers you know we go through and God he promised he said that I will lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness and a lot of times the things that we're struggling and going through are stuff that we've we're we're just bearing fruit of stuff that we've swn into the world right I mean pressures the cares of life you know all of these things cuz God saying like I have provided the way of life for you and yet he's standing there with the medicine and he's trying to give it to us and yet we it's just because we have an adversary and he tricks us but I help help me Lord to take the medicine yes you know and God allows us to see certain things and when we go through things hardships and trials it's like praise God praise God you know I just um you know it just really dawned on me how Jesus in in John here in chapter 12 and kind of lost track of time everybody feeling okay you know it's one of those things that you know we just we can't have enough of God so we just keep pressing on but you know I just thought about how that you know sometimes we go through trials and testings because God is waiting to see your reaction you know do we even give God a chance sometimes we just react like this is instinctual slap me I slap him back you know that's just reaction but God what he's trying to bring us to is the stature of a perfect man this is the place where he wants to dwell he wants to abide in every circumstance every situation and so we're going to go through different things difficulties and trials because what he's trying to do is come into Oneness with us that was his desire from the beginning is that he can take your eyes and look at the right things he can take your hands and be in service for the right things he can take your feet to go to the right places he can use your heart to speak the word in season that'll change somebody else's life no matter your hurt no matter your heartache no matter your difficulty or the strain that God can come by his your way and he can say I have a servant that is willing to lay His Garment to the side and take up mine and that I could speak amen isn't that your desire I say Lord help heal my eyes give me that kind of vision every moment amen amen you know there in chapter 12 I I just I thought about it and uh brother Brandon preached a message um I believe it was called the uh I identified Masterpiece of God you know God has identified his Masterpiece and you're included in it you might not realize it but God has included you in that Masterpiece and one thing that just it just woed my heart I said God yes that's what I want I want that kind of Victory but Jesus when Philip and Andrew you know they were the ones that God was dealing with them before when there was 5,000 and he asked Philip and Andrew he says hey you know look at all these people just hey go over there and get them to sit down sit down like man he's like he he was going to put them to see what kind of reaction they would have and he says uh you know what about the food like Andrew and Philip like we're outnumbered here you know it's like math ain't working you know and that's what God does with us sometimes he wants you to see where you're looking at something through the eye of human understanding but he's he's he's seeing your reaction if you'll let your faith loose for a moment and let him come in and say I can do exceedingly abundantly what you can think or ask and so Philip and Andrew they say well and he knew I don't know exactly where that is but I'll just paraphrase it for now but you know so they had this experience where all of a sudden now they're handing stuff out and they're witnessing they're experiencing something where this reality that they had a hunger inside now they've seen it they are ey Witnesses of it am and so all of the sudden God now he's got some witnesses that are being used these Greeks they were Scholars they had a wisdom and all this kind of stuff they want to see Jesus and so Philip and Andrew they're consult let's go we're taking them to Jesus and a lot of times people just think well we just got to get them to church but he's saying get them to Jesus and you don't have to go to a building to get people to Jesus you just have to go back to where you met him he's right there in your heart the power of God to turn them loose is the same power that came and now opened the door to Liberty for you and me praise God let's not forget get that it's not hey come on hey I want to see him fulfill the word of God but my like if that salt could ever contact why they were okay and so Jesus he's standing there and he says as they're coming to him you you would think oh you know he's going to show them something he says except a corn of wheat Dy it abideth alone can you imagine those guys going what is he talking about and some of you might be saying the same thing what is he talking about well I just want to tell you how it struck me you know he died he did his part he raised from the dead and I believe that God's calling us to be more consecrated more dedicated to to be able to lay our life down like he said to do if any man come after me let him deny himself it's so easy to take the attitude and the approach this is what I believe and I'm I'm holding to that and I believe that but if it ever becomes something more to where it's now it's not I that liveth but it's Christ in me now now we're talking about something that people want to see they don't want to see all of our Doctrine because the letter kth but the spirit the spirit giveth life and I say just as others would come and they would want to see Jesus how are they going to see him how are they going to see Jesus they're going to see Jesus in you in me who Who Am I who are you I look back at some of the things that I come out of huh I say God you could take anybody you can just take dust and make it thus but my think about it he chose you and the way that you look at yourself and your situation but he's not looking at that we want to look through his eyes and see us the way he sees us but it'll come through self-sacrifice really in order to really come to that place where I believe that I'm Desiring and I believe the Church of God is Desiring yes is to see Jesus we must come to that death and I know a lot of times we we say you know I've given my heart to the Lord I've relinquished everything but I believe it's like Paul said I Die daily I'm not satisfied with what I did yesterday the yielding the crying out the purging I say God what do you have for me today I want to be sensitive God is doing something every single day not just in the church service every morning his mercies are new you can come to the Fountain alone say God you have a word for your servant you know sometimes I believe it's just you know maybe we haven't seen his glory you know I know it changed the prophet Isaiah mhm he he testified he he he realized I'm a man of unclean lips I dwell with the people but oh my once he seen the train fing and all of those angels and he said wow I it changed him I mean he he you get into that presence and you fall over as a dead man but praise God that you're still alive because God has something more for for us to do you know you see the world going off in darkness but if any man will come after me let him deny himself it's one of the hardest things to do is to die and rot my you know he said this and and um to just trust in the Lord Lord in Victory Day this is amazing brother brandom says this in 1962 on April 21st in Victory Day I was listening to it today and I just thought my goodness this was just a service at someone's home like at the introduction you can hear dog barking and some you know hey quiet down you know it's just in someone's home you know we're we'll probably end up having services in people's homes before this thing get there's some trouble Wat to be to be experienced I mean we got to take we got to redeem the time we got to get serious there's people inside the church that need a new birth God is allowing stresses and pressures that we can get serious and cry out and pour out before God and say this is my brother this is my sister I can't make it without you we're in this together let's lay everything to the side but this Victory Day brother brandham speaking of he says this and I'll pick up in um well I don't have the number but he says now there was a dday and then there was a V Day the dday was when they went in to fight the V Day is when there was a peace signed you know and I thought about that you know and and you know D D day this is dday It's Time to fight you know you think about Jacob you know Jacob he had that fight with the angel of the Lord you know and he fought and he wasn't going to stop fighting until he received that touch from the Lord he might have not wanted to fight if he knew the result at the end of it but it changed his walk he he got a name changed he had power after that and that's what the resurrection power can't come upon a Believer until he dies amen we must die die and rot and smell and corrupt to ourselves our own thinking our own attitudes so that it can be Christ the sweet humble Life of Christ now in 139 it says it seems like Christian Life if a fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ the Christian life seems like it holds many disappointments but those disappointments are God's Divine will happening for us now it don't seem like it would be that but it's God's way of doing things so along went Abraham and he finally came to the very then you see being so loyal more loyal more testing see so he brought him right back now remember remember when God has counted you worthy when you have a test now don't fail this to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found you you found favor with God and God believes that you'll stand the test you know we need this Faith praise God God sent a prophet messenger at this end time that's saying the same thing that Paul said said this is the mercy of God before judgment this is this is what brings the healing to our understanding and our eyes I believe that you remember he said the same thing to job Satan said oh yes I see job down there said he's not God said God said he is a perfect servant there's none in the earth like him there's nobody like Jo job he's a perfect man now he's my pride and joy that's you your test your trials God has confidence he's put the test on you because when you come out of that it's going to be a beaten work for his glory it's going to be a testimony that others can say Divinity has flown through that place not only has it flown through it but it's abiding my my you know I just you know one of the things that you know I think that has been such a good thing about dealing with trials and difficulties you know you go through uh personal battles and a lot of times personal battles you know you just keep them personal it's between you and the Lord and so one of the things that I realize is sometimes when you contain those personal battles and those struggles you know it it tries to eat at you and so what what I I love I love is when brother Brandon preached that day on Calvary he says now look away and look what Calvary did for you if you haven't had a victory day you need to go to Calvary you know and and and you know Calvary is representing the cross and you know but what did it mean what does Calvary mean to you personally I think if we can't answer that question I think we should go to Calvary and let God answer and settle the question because if we don't look to the Cross see that was what the provision was in the Old Testament when they were being the children of Israel were being snake bitten you know the tactic of the devil is still snake biting people through these different devices these different influences these different pulls to to to tantalize our attention but these snake bites if there was people that wanted to escape from the leprosy or from the sting of the the Serpent's hiss they can look to a Brazen cross that God had lifted up in the wilderness to let the people go free said said if you will look to the Cross look to that you will live take your eyes off of well I got into this and I got snake bit you're not strong enough to take that poison from yourself but God has a toxine God has a holy ghost the hour has come to repent if you haven't been baptized be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let it be settled and when you come into the struggle and the trial you can take the fruit of God's word into your bosom and say I know my redeemer liveth and in the last day I will see him for myself this is the last days we want to see Jesus amen you know I'll just go to [Music] Isaiah 53 for a moment you know if it wasn't for the prophecy of Isaiah speaking you know how would we understand how would we believe scripture says in 53 who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the dry ground Heath no form nor comeliness and when we see him there was no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he ha bore our griefs and carried our sin our sorrows yet we did esteemed him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed am all we like sheep have gone astray and we have turned everyone to his own way we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord had laid upon him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before for his shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from the prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put on him he had put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and as the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied but his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquity therefore I will divide a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he had poured out his soul unto death and he had numbered with the transgressors and he bore the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressor you know and I just thought that's you know something that we need to revisit regularly you know sometimes I you know we we go through things and we agonize we suffer we go through things but if we could ever see what it really cost right if we could ever meditate you know I know there's a principle as a Christian if you'll think on the Lord and think what he's done for you you'll find that he'll come around your way because as you're thinking on him those other thoughts will start to melt away and I think it would be good for us to visit this in other scriptures thinking about you know how brother brandom you know he said I don't remember what scripture I think it was vict day but he was talking about how when The Gunshot went off and blew his leg out and he was in that place of you know they had given him some kind of anesthetic and it like pierced through his spine and his heart rate was going so low and I just you know I think he said like he gave he gave like a a testimony to God like you know if you know I can't remember out if this time I didn't print the the quote but you can listen to his testimony brother brandham suffered but he came to that place he was a beaten work for us it was unto the Lord a sweet smelling Savor but it was an example you know we don't want to just look and say oh our our precious brother and what he did and you know our Lord what he did but what was the cause it was for you so that you can have an example to follow to take courage to take heart in the hardships in the pressures you know and thinking about when he came to that place and then he you know something happened he was able to live and he just said you know I don't know how to do I do I pray right you know like am I put oh he didn't answer me because I didn't put my hands right or or I didn't say the right word this is helping somebody this is stored up food amen sometimes we go to prayer and we can't hardly think about anything but if we'll just focus God you hear my voice because I have an atoning blood I've come your provided sacrifice this is the only way that man can make peace with God and be justified right you were wounded you took this punishment for me and I know you hear my voice it's just a precious thing that you know I just recommend going and listening to brother brandom's testimony when he came to that dark place and he he draws strength from it and um my mind's kind of going blank on how it exactly went but you know you think about Paul you know I was looking in the book of Acts 17 I know many of y all know the scripture and are familiar but when Jesus revealed himself to Paul or Saul he says you're going to suffer many things for my name's sake but I have a work for you to do God has a work for you to do and in preparation for that work there's going to be a struggle but without the struggle there's no overcoming without the trial there's no victory there's got to be a dday a day of fighting let's rise up let's take the word of God we got the sword we got the full armor let's go to battle against the enemy that's trying to make us lukewarm trying to make us soft amen it's time to fight if we want Victory it's time to fight we're not compromising we're not settling I don't want to just say oh God Rapture rapture rapt it's time to fight the rapture's coming when it's coming but there's brothers and sisters it's time to fight we want victory victory's in sight God is with us let's rise and fight amen shall we stand as we invite the musicians you know it's going to require a death it's going to require self-sacrifice for this revival to come amen how many in here tonight would say Lord I want this revival I want this life of Christ to be living in me yes you want to join me and say I want to be like Jesus let's sing that song together to be like Jesus amen to

through life J Pro to GL [Music] I to be like you amen amen you know before we invite brother Billy and maybe we can sing thank you for the cross I I wonder if there's somebody in here that knows that they're in Covenant but maybe feels like they're Samson they can identify with Samson they were commissioned to rise up and fight against the enemy but something blinded your eyes and something's now trying to Mock You the enemy's trying to accuse you but if you can say just once more Lord if you can say Lord if you will just come by my way tonight just once more give me the strength to fight I can take these pillars that are binding me I can take these chains and I can punch them down because I've been raised for this I've been born to fight this enemy doesn't have dominion over me that's right has no right I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God right true are you willing to pay the price are you willing to die with your enemy so that Resurrection can come if you want prayer if you desire that you want to come you believe that God will do this for you you want to make a public stand and say God I believe it and I want to die with my enemy you're welcome to come for prayer as

manifestation of Jesus Christ today what he promised he will do amen he was the first of that generation he was the first of his own race but the seed had to go in the ground he had to go and rot he had to go and die otherwise he abides alone in order for him to bring another another race he had to go down you can't you have to go down you have to go down in order for the old you to die and the new you to come up amen that's the hardest part we got to die to ourselves and we got to die to the things of the world our own ideas our own thinking on how it's going to do it what he wants to do oh that we may rise in the Glorious Lord Jesus Christ the word manifested for this hour Lord I don't want nothing except what you want me to be you know when when those disciples when they came out when they say silver and gold if i n they knew what they have they didn't have any doubt I want to be the same way I don't want to go out of here say I don't know if I got it if I have no I want to just like they looked at that that man at the beggar and they said That's which we have that I miss know that I have it it's leading me it's guiding me I'm walking by it that's the desires of a Believer not not to be one that just everything seems to be a far of and I'm always trying to get to it no no he wants to dwell in us he wants to his life to live in us that we may manifest his very fruit not by our own doing but him manifesting I like that quote that our brother read he said in her she's she's what he is but then in her is manifested everything that he is all his glory is manifested he died so she can be what she is amen amen so if you have a need on your heart amen he's certainly here this tonight to just make his word a reality to you we we have to to to come by faith we have to know it's ours we can't come begging we have to know knowing that this is the promise of the hour this is what he said he will do to those that believe and I'm here as a believer I'm here to partake of the promises of my time just like he did it is the same yesterday today and forever if he did it that time he's going to do the same today because he hasn't changed amen let's just bow our heads our gracious father we're so thankful for your word Lord and father it seems like each day you have a portion that's just right for what we have need of and to lift us up and to comfort us and Lord to give us another step forward and to put energies just in our spirit Lord that we may continue this battle Lord God and truly we leave by the word of God and I pray L father what our brother brought out and and the word that he brought tonight father in each heart represented here tonight father we want the manifested word the Lord Jesus Christ himself fighting all battles we know you do living in us we know you do walking with us we know you do Lord that as our brother said that we may pray for more Revelation Lord Lord not necessarily to see new things but to just see what you already done Lord and what you continue to do sometimes it's just we are blind because of the world and the things that we are surrounded by Lord give us eyesight tonight Lord if we can just this Bible will open up up to us through an understanding of what you already accomplished for us and and not just what you did yesterday but what you do today and every moment every time we work up the the the things that you save us from the things that you have you fought you fight for us every moment and every hour Lord we are so thankful Lord we want to commit ourselves to you Lord those that came up for prayer Lord help them and I believe it's the hour where the need for that manifestation is near Lord and that you may give each and everyone a measure of yourself Lord that we know that we are walking with you and not by ourselves bless our brother Andrew Lord and just comfort him and lead him oh Father father just refill him even as his poured out of himself Lord and the word that you have revealed to him Lord and we partake of it tonight and we are thankful that you have used our brother Lord and remember our pastor Lord and sister lesle and be with them and bring them back safe and father for those that couldn't be here Lord we remember them bless them and be with them oh God and Father make a way that our hearts be burning that every time these doors open that we may be gathering your presence to know that you are here to keep your word true those that are sick and Afflicted you are the mighty healer you are the doctor of all doctors Lord we pray that you touch and you heal Lord as we are you said that healing is the children's bread Lord and that we may have it Lord and know that it's always there present every time we need it Lord be with us I pray Lord and be
