[31:38] to you right now and say lord
[31:40] we're gonna praise you in the storm lord
[31:43] we see darkness all around us we see a
[31:46] world that's decayed and cankered with
[31:48] sin
[31:49] lewdness and an antichrist spirit that's
[31:52] moving his eden into position
[31:55] but oh god we see that on one side but
[31:58] we look to the other side and see that
[32:00] there's a
[32:01] new testament church that is rising up
[32:04] with the same power
[32:05] and life and resurrection that you
[32:07] possessed lord that you have sent into
[32:09] the believer in this hour
[32:11] and lord we know that we possess
[32:12] everything that we have need of because
[32:14] we have you
[32:16] we have your revealed word of the hour
[32:18] lord we've put in all of our faith
[32:20] and all of our trust in that word and
[32:23] that word alone lord
[32:24] we're not going to look to the right
[32:26] we're not going to look to the left
[32:28] but we have our eyes on christ the word
[32:30] and christ alone lord
[32:32] and we're in that great expectation for
[32:34] what you are doing
[32:35] lord we're not discouraged by the things
[32:37] that we see around us in a way that
[32:39] would cause us
[32:40] to take a step back lord but it causes
[32:42] us to take a step forward
[32:44] knowing that you are with us lord and
[32:46] you're willing and more than able to do
[32:48] above
[32:49] what we could even ask or think lord we
[32:51] just love you we commit this time of
[32:53] fellowship to you
[32:54] all those that have gathered together
[32:56] the needs lord those that are not able
[32:58] to make it those might
[32:59] be streaming online lord we're just
[33:02] committing everything into thy wonderful
[33:03] hands down
[33:04] we ask it in your precious name the lord
[33:06] jesus christ
[33:08] amen amen praise the lord
[33:11] you have your bibles we'll be reading
[33:13] out of matthew chapter 10.
[33:16] and i believe we have a baptismal after
[33:19] service we're going to be baptizing
[33:22] little benjamin we're gonna have to call
[33:25] him little brother benjamin
[33:28] but we're we're happy for that we'll be
[33:30] reading out of matthew chapter 10 verse
[33:32] 32.
[33:34] it's good to be back in the house of the
[33:35] lord with each of you
[33:38] on a wednesday night and we
[33:41] we just just want to talk to you for a
[33:44] little bit
[33:45] i don't presume will be very long
[33:49] but just a little something the lord put
[33:52] on my heart and just pray that it would
[33:53] be a blessing
[33:55] to you man just keep our
[33:58] pastor in prayer he's he's weary in body
[34:01] just
[34:03] doing some labor work and whatnot so
[34:06] he's just a little weary but i just keep
[34:10] him in prayer
[34:13] matthew chapter 10 verse 32.
[34:25] whosoever therefore shall confess me
[34:27] before men
[34:28] him will i confess also before my father
[34:31] which is in heaven
[34:33] but whosoever shall deny me before men
[34:36] and will i also deny before my father
[34:38] which is in heaven
[34:40] think not that i am come to send peace
[34:42] on earth
[34:45] i came to send i came not to send peace
[34:49] but a sword i think many many uh
[34:54] preachers or ministers maybe even in the
[34:57] denominational world and this
[34:59] come as you are gospel forget that jesus
[35:02] christ didn't come
[35:04] necessarily to bring peace but he came
[35:06] to bring a sword
[35:07] and just listen to these words for i am
[35:09] come to set a man
[35:11] at variance against his father
[35:14] and the daughter against her mother
[35:18] and the daughter-in-law against her
[35:20] mother-in-law
[35:23] and a man's foes shall be they of his
[35:26] own
[35:28] household why this is already
[35:31] a gospel an invitation to be a part of
[35:33] something that doesn't sound too
[35:34] desirable
[35:37] he that loveth father or mother more
[35:40] than me is not worthy of me
[35:42] and he that loveth son or daughter more
[35:45] than me is not worthy of me
[35:47] and he that taketh not his
[35:50] cross just focus there
[35:54] and he that taketh not his cross
[35:57] and we're going to have a cross to bear
[35:59] church
[36:01] my cross might not uh look to appear the
[36:04] same way
[36:05] that your cross might be brother brandon
[36:07] mentions at one time about
[36:09] a moses and his wife's support that was
[36:11] his cross
[36:12] that he was bearing
[36:17] and he that taketh not his cross and
[36:19] followeth after me
[36:20] is not worthy of me amen we just ask a
[36:23] blessing on the word you may be seated
[36:28] we also just want to read out of matthew
[36:30] chapter 16.
[36:33] you're reading verse 24.
[36:49] then jesus said unto his disciples if
[36:52] any man will come after me
[36:54] let him deny himself and take up his
[36:57] cross
[36:58] and follow me for whosoever will save
[37:01] his life
[37:03] shall lose it and whosoever shall lose
[37:06] his life for my sake
[37:08] shall find it for what is a man profited
[37:12] if he shall gain the whole world and
[37:13] lose his own soul
[37:15] or what shall a man give in exchange for
[37:17] his soul for the son of man
[37:19] shall come in the glory of his father
[37:21] with angels
[37:22] and then he shall reward reward every
[37:24] man
[37:26] according to his works verily i say unto
[37:29] you there be some standing here which
[37:31] shall not taste
[37:32] death till they see the son of man
[37:35] coming
[37:36] in his kingdom amen and just
[37:40] maybe pulling from
[37:43] that verse there matthew chapter 16 24
[37:47] he says if if any man will come after me
[37:50] or if any man will follow me
[37:52] and these this just stuck out to me he
[37:55] says let him
[37:56] deny himself take up his cross
[38:01] and follow me so there's a denial of
[38:04] yourself
[38:05] we're going to have to deny ourself and
[38:07] then there's a cross
[38:09] he always says take up your cross
[38:11] there's a cross
[38:13] that we are going to bear and so we deny
[38:16] ourself we take up our cross
[38:18] and we follow him and just in even
[38:21] reading the scriptures that we have read
[38:23] you know this is completely contrary to
[38:26] human nature
[38:28] to deny yourself um you know and
[38:32] and to take up your cross and and to
[38:35] follow him you know
[38:37] we rely on our human nature relies on
[38:39] our
[38:40] our five senses and touch taste sees
[38:43] smell and our conscience memory reason
[38:45] and affection
[38:46] and all of these things that we can
[38:48] contact our earthly home that we see by
[38:51] and that we understand by
[38:53] and what the word is saying here all of
[38:55] those things that
[38:56] that you use to contact this earthly
[38:58] home all of those things
[39:00] that that you depend on i want you to
[39:03] deny
[39:05] those very things that are contacting
[39:07] your earthly tabernacle
[39:09] the very things that appear to be an
[39:10] absolute to you
[39:13] the very things that you would you you i
[39:15] mean look you see something that's green
[39:17] it's
[39:18] it's green you can't you can't tell me
[39:21] any other thing and then you think of
[39:23] family and you just even think of the
[39:25] patriarch abraham and the hebrew
[39:27] childrens of certain ones
[39:28] where they were they had to deny the
[39:30] very self-preservation that they're
[39:32] the very thing that would even preserve
[39:34] them or keep them there was something
[39:36] that was beyond that
[39:38] there was a sick sense there of faith
[39:40] that could look to god's word and deny
[39:44] the reasoning of the mind deny the
[39:47] condition of the age and so we're just
[39:49] maybe
[39:50] looking uh down a path as we would go
[39:52] that way because
[39:53] you know you just think about the age
[39:55] that we're living in everything is
[39:57] governed by the carnal mind and
[39:58] if it feels good do it and if oh it's
[40:01] it's an age of people's rights and
[40:03] and you know if if you want it you can
[40:06] have it and if somebody's in your way oh
[40:08] oh my if they're keeping you from it
[40:09] they're an offense to you and
[40:11] and all they're they're just so selfish
[40:13] and they have their own objectives and
[40:14] their
[40:15] their own goals and agendas and and but
[40:18] we're called to deny ourselves
[40:24] we operate by another kingdom we operate
[40:27] by faith we operate
[40:29] by revelation we operate by the spirit
[40:32] of god
[40:32] and so we're not depending on those
[40:34] faculties
[40:37] but i say that's the challenge
[40:40] we say we're not depending on them
[40:44] but too many times we are
[40:47] it's hard to be an eternal being
[40:53] living in this little old pesthouse
[40:56] shaking off some spiritual amnesia
[40:59] because the world that's set around us
[41:02] is designed to just
[41:03] keep that spiritual amnesia on you it
[41:06] wants to keep contacting the flesh and
[41:08] contacting your mind
[41:10] and stimulating you in such a way so
[41:12] you're engaged with the five senses
[41:15] you're engaged with your conscience and
[41:17] your memory and your affection
[41:19] and so you're in a position to where
[41:21] those are the things that are engaging
[41:23] you
[41:23] and that you're that's controlling you
[41:25] and and you're using these things to
[41:27] navigate through the day but oh there's
[41:28] another sense
[41:30] there's another kingdom there's another
[41:31] leading there's another spirit
[41:33] that we need to tap into and that needs
[41:36] to be the first place and the priority
[41:38] it needs to be
[41:39] what's on the control tower that's
[41:41] governing us and moving us into action
[41:44] at verse 25 said for whosoever shall
[41:47] will
[41:48] save his life shall lose it
[41:53] this is contrary to to mankind
[41:57] that doesn't even make sense
[42:00] what do you mean lose my if i lose my
[42:01] life i already lost it i'm going to save
[42:03] it if i lost it
[42:07] that's in the natural but whosoever will
[42:10] lose his life for my sake there it is
[42:14] look you can you can lay down your life
[42:16] for a family member you could lay down
[42:17] your life in battle you can lay down
[42:19] your life for your country
[42:20] and all how we appreciate veterans and
[42:22] the self-sacrifice that they laid on the
[42:24] altar of freedom
[42:25] we appreciate that we honor that but oh
[42:28] if you haven't laid down
[42:30] your life for jesus christ you're going
[42:32] to lose it
[42:37] oh we got to we got to take up our cross
[42:40] how do we take up our cross how do we
[42:42] die daily
[42:45] how do we deny ourselves
[42:49] the prophet said every believer that
[42:50] comes to christ must come to the same
[42:52] cross
[42:53] of self-denial
[42:57] you'll find that we just want to maybe
[42:58] move down that channel a little bit
[43:01] of self-denial and denying ourself
[43:04] because
[43:05] you know i'm just a young and i i
[43:08] haven't been serving the lord that long
[43:09] by god's grace i believe that
[43:12] um i believe i'm seven days from what
[43:15] would be what i would call my
[43:16] anniversary
[43:17] i'll be have having served the lord for
[43:19] 21 years
[43:21] and i have to admit i've i've looked
[43:23] forward to that because
[43:26] if the lord would tarry of course
[43:27] because i
[43:29] i was 21 years old when i gave my heart
[43:31] to the lord
[43:33] and so i i just have to say it i've been
[43:35] waiting for that little tick over the
[43:36] clock be like
[43:37] i've been serving god longer than i was
[43:39] in the world
[43:42] but hey that's just in the carnal realm
[43:44] i came from god
[43:46] i go back to god look at the thief on
[43:49] the cross how long was he serving god on
[43:51] the earth
[43:55] oh and we we think we can figure it all
[43:57] out and we look at works and how good
[43:59] you can
[43:59] you can follow this or explain that what
[44:01] about the thief on the cross
[44:03] can you imagine you can you imagine that
[44:08] you know i often think about how he just
[44:09] maybe appeared over there on paradise
[44:11] and coming to the saints of god they're
[44:12] like who are you he's like look out he's
[44:14] coming
[44:15] who's coming the messiah the savior what
[44:18] do you mean he's coming where did you
[44:19] see him he was hanging on the cross next
[44:21] to me
[44:22] oh you you know i can't believe it he
[44:25] was a sinner his whole life and
[44:26] and he had never even served god at all
[44:29] oh praise god there was a thief on the
[44:31] cross because if he could make it in
[44:33] it gives me a little hope that i can
[44:34] make it in because it's not by our own
[44:37] merits it's not by what you have done
[44:38] but it's because of what he did
[44:44] and just thinking on this self-denial
[44:46] let's just read here in math
[44:48] in mark chapter 10.
[44:52] just maybe a little bible study
[45:01] mark 10 17.
[45:06] let's pick up the story of the rich
[45:07] young ruler and when he was gone forth
[45:09] into the way
[45:10] there came one running annealed to him
[45:12] and asked him good master
[45:15] what shall i do that i may inherit
[45:16] eternal life
[45:18] and jesus said unto him why call us thou
[45:20] me good there is none good
[45:22] there is none good but one that is god
[45:25] thou knowest the commandments
[45:27] do not commit adultery do not kill do
[45:29] not steal
[45:30] do not bear false witness defraud not
[45:33] honor thy father and thy mother
[45:35] and he answered and said in a master all
[45:37] these i have observed
[45:39] from my youth i'll give them the benefit
[45:41] of the doubt
[45:44] then jesus beholding him loved him
[45:49] and said in him one thing thou lackest
[45:53] go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast
[45:57] and give to the poor and thou shalt have
[45:59] treasure in heaven
[46:01] and come take up the cross and follow me
[46:04] now i want to
[46:06] point out i believe that jesus was
[46:08] identifying his cross
[46:10] the one thing that he had to do
[46:14] to be able to follow the lord to
[46:16] surrender all
[46:17] jesus christ identified look the one
[46:19] thing that you lack
[46:21] and i pray by the preaching of the word
[46:23] that something can be identified in our
[46:25] life
[46:26] where maybe there's a lacking or
[46:28] something that we can have
[46:29] a greater surrender that we can come
[46:32] into the position
[46:34] and to the adoptions of sons in this
[46:36] hour
[46:37] one thing thou lackest and if we can now
[46:40] just allow the holy spirit and by the
[46:43] word of god come forth
[46:44] and we can start looking at your not
[46:46] look at that i've observed everything in
[46:48] this word and in this message from my
[46:50] youth
[46:51] well i i've i've i've i've been i've
[46:54] been in it a little bit a while i've
[46:56] been feeding on a little bit of
[46:57] a while and i got all this but no let's
[47:00] let's look past
[47:01] all that say lord what do i lack
[47:06] and he was sad at that saying and went
[47:08] away grieved for he had great possession
[47:11] and jesus looked round about and saith
[47:12] unto his disciples
[47:14] how hardly shall they that of riches
[47:16] enter into the kingdom
[47:18] of god see the price was too much for
[47:22] him
[47:24] one thing thou lackest is the price
[47:28] too much for you in your self-denial
[47:32] now his self-denial was his riches it
[47:35] was
[47:35] his accumulation of wealth but that's
[47:37] not maybe the self-denial that you're
[47:39] faced with
[47:40] not all of us have houses and lands and
[47:43] have all of these things but oh one
[47:45] thing thou lackest
[47:49] oh he refused to do it the prophet says
[47:52] and forsaking all but that's exactly
[47:54] referring to this very story says but
[47:56] that's exactly what god
[47:57] requires forsake all and follow
[48:00] him that's god's requirement we've got
[48:03] to do it
[48:04] sometimes we've got to forsake our very
[48:07] thoughts
[48:08] if our thoughts about anything is
[48:10] contrary to god's word
[48:11] we've got to forsake our own thinking
[48:13] and follow him
[48:15] and the only way we can follow him is
[48:17] follow his word
[48:18] obey it and god's request and god's
[48:22] requirement is that we forsake
[48:23] all and follow him now
[48:27] this this is gonna be a very simple
[48:30] thought as we
[48:31] move along here and certainly something
[48:34] that could be directed towards the youth
[48:36] but i i think in our and maybe in the
[48:38] maturity of a believer
[48:40] and knowing how much more of the word
[48:43] there is for us
[48:44] and seeing uh uh the the manifestation
[48:47] of the word
[48:48] in the prophet of the age life and what
[48:51] level of maturity
[48:53] that brought him to and seeing the
[48:55] anguish and the agony that our lord and
[48:57] savior had to come to in the garden
[48:59] in his own self-denial i believe there
[49:02] is something more that we can give to
[49:04] him
[49:09] but in doing so we find out sometimes we
[49:12] have to forsake our friends
[49:15] many times that's a hard thing to do
[49:19] now many people when they first come
[49:21] into christ and being filled with the
[49:22] spirit
[49:23] maybe now listen this is just a scenario
[49:27] and this scenario will fit a situation
[49:31] that maybe you have been in or that you
[49:33] are facing
[49:34] might not have the same exact
[49:37] description but maybe like a woman that
[49:38] has been
[49:39] uh you know some kind of a party they've
[49:42] been going to
[49:43] going to every certain night and where
[49:46] they've been playing
[49:47] bunco in the neighborhood
[49:51] acquainted with all the neighbors and so
[49:54] forth
[49:55] and belong to certain societies
[49:59] in the neighborhood and they go play
[50:02] bonco and these women you know
[50:04] no is going to say something about it
[50:07] they're not going to understand it but
[50:08] yet
[50:09] you have to forsake that thing because
[50:12] it's not right to gamble to play cards
[50:15] and you've got to forsake that if you
[50:18] follow
[50:19] christ he's identified friends and in
[50:23] our opening text he's uh it's going to
[50:25] set you at variance maybe with your
[50:26] father with your mother with your
[50:28] brother
[50:29] you're going to have to uh uh some of
[50:31] the societies and the communities that
[50:33] you're a part of and now
[50:34] uh there's societies and communities
[50:36] that are online and
[50:38] and certain interests and and and maybe
[50:40] uh there's groups that you have
[50:42] certain interests that you fellowship
[50:44] around and oh
[50:45] it just appears to be so innocent but i
[50:48] i want to
[50:50] say that if we're denying ourself there
[50:52] should be
[50:53] some reproach or some cross
[50:56] of the gospel in that society you're a
[50:58] part of
[50:59] they should know where you stand but the
[51:02] problem of it is the reason you're not
[51:04] bearing a cross
[51:05] in your little secret society is because
[51:07] you're not displaying
[51:09] the very life of jesus christ because if
[51:12] you were there would become a rub
[51:14] there would become something that would
[51:16] would convict
[51:17] the individuals that you're having
[51:19] fellowship with it
[51:20] and something inside of them would start
[51:24] to want to shun you and want to move
[51:26] away from you
[51:27] because the light that you're bringing
[51:29] forth is shining upon the darkness
[51:31] of their heart and it's making them feel
[51:33] uncomfortable and they will start
[51:34] persecuting you
[51:36] they'll start reviling you but oh
[51:39] you just fit in so easy so nicely
[51:43] you're just a good neighbor they don't
[51:45] know what you believe and everybody
[51:47] likes you
[51:50] that's not what we're called to
[51:54] this just comes to mind we know
[51:57] all the father has given me will come
[52:01] but you know there's a reward every man
[52:03] is rewarded for his works
[52:05] and i'm reminded of the story of the
[52:07] sister uh who was
[52:09] in the balcony i believe it was and she
[52:11] saw a young mother carrying around a
[52:13] child
[52:14] and and the holy spirit kept telling her
[52:15] pray for that child
[52:18] they even had a prayer card now could
[52:21] you imagine like
[52:22] who am i she has a prayer card she's
[52:24] going to speak to the man of god
[52:27] the discerning the thoughts and intents
[52:28] of the heart who am i and
[52:30] and the spirit kept moving upon her
[52:34] and she finally followed the unction of
[52:36] the holy spirit
[52:37] now this is just brother matthew's
[52:38] thinking if she would
[52:40] not have followed the leading of the
[52:43] holy spirit
[52:44] i believe it was god's perfect will for
[52:46] that child to be healed
[52:49] and the story might have been a little
[52:50] bit different as brother branham
[52:52] discerned the scenario maybe would have
[52:54] never even
[52:55] uh mentioned it and who knows how many
[52:57] times a scenario like that might have
[53:00] presented itself where that you have a
[53:03] prayer card or some need it's like well
[53:05] we'll just let them go to the pastor
[53:06] we'll just let them go to the man of god
[53:07] i'll go to the hospital and i pray
[53:09] and something on your heart is telling
[53:10] you just call the brother
[53:12] just call the brother just go lay hands
[53:14] on him
[53:16] why because who is it greater is he that
[53:18] is in you than he that is in the world
[53:20] and so this sister here under that
[53:22] answer she prayed
[53:23] for that child the child was healed and
[53:25] the prophet picks that up and says your
[53:27] child's already
[53:28] healed because that sister up there uh
[53:30] obeyed the leading of the holy spirit
[53:32] but yet if she would not have obeyed the
[53:34] leading of the holy spirit
[53:36] as you know like i said this is just my
[53:38] way of trying to say it
[53:39] the child would have been healed through
[53:41] maybe a permissive will
[53:43] because what it appears to me that that
[53:45] was the lord's will for her to follow
[53:47] the leading of the lord
[53:48] and lay hands on that child and so
[53:52] we have a responsibility to be the light
[53:56] to be the witness to surrender to god's
[53:59] leading
[53:59] in our communities in our homes and our
[54:01] life in our workplaces
[54:03] that we might harvest those seeds that
[54:06] might be spread out there
[54:08] and even in that you know that the
[54:10] prophet said
[54:11] my the prophet said that jesus christ
[54:15] the third pool of his ministry was what
[54:18] preaching to the lost
[54:21] your effort is not in vain you might
[54:24] just be
[54:24] preaching to the lost but it's necessary
[54:28] it's needful our lord jesus christ did
[54:31] it
[54:31] and that same life is in the bride and
[54:33] it very well might be
[54:35] that you are preaching to souls that are
[54:38] lost that souls that are in prison
[54:42] we're called to do it but oh oh how
[54:46] joyful it is one day you're working in
[54:48] the warehouse at walmart
[54:50] and you're being alive and somebody
[54:52] inquires about the hope that lies within
[54:54] you
[54:55] and you've been preaching to a dark
[54:57] warehouse for 12 years
[54:59] and no one's ever responded to the light
[55:01] and you've taken the persecution
[55:04] you've taken the rebuke in one day a
[55:06] seed comes out of it
[55:08] it's worth it all i'm referring to
[55:12] brother jackson and brother gary's
[55:13] sitting back there
[55:14] oh we got to preach the word yes it
[55:17] comes
[55:18] with a cost you've got to take up your
[55:21] cross and follow
[55:22] him
[55:29] we could maybe just to move a little
[55:33] faster we won't take up
[55:36] some examples there in the old testament
[55:38] as we just move
[55:40] a little quickly now but in thinking of
[55:42] abraham
[55:44] abraham was called he believed he
[55:47] trusted god
[55:49] you would have thought that was it okay
[55:51] god give me his word i got the promise
[55:54] all right i'm waiting lord he receives
[55:58] the promise
[56:01] and then he tells him now take the
[56:03] promise you've been waiting for and go
[56:05] up on a mountain
[56:07] and kill it
[56:10] look this this message
[56:14] and this gospel defies
[56:17] all logic i was fellowship with a
[56:19] gentleman in time he goes well you know
[56:21] i mean
[56:21] when you when you think about it the
[56:23] bible and everything it it
[56:25] typically it makes sense it's the better
[56:28] way
[56:28] i'm like no it doesn't make sense he's
[56:31] like what do you mean
[56:32] god told abraham to kill his son
[56:36] that doesn't make sense because we're
[56:40] we we can't make sense of it that's why
[56:43] god has given
[56:44] us a sixth sense that is by faith and by
[56:47] revelation because without that you're
[56:49] most miserable
[56:53] hebrews 12 6 says for whom the lord
[56:56] loveth he chasteneth
[56:58] and scourges every son whom he receiveth
[57:01] if he endure chastening god dealing with
[57:03] you as sons
[57:05] for what son for what son is he whom the
[57:09] father chasteneth us not
[57:12] look every son that cometh to god must
[57:14] be first tested
[57:16] you got to be tried you got to be child
[57:19] trained
[57:20] yes sir amen
[57:24] it's part of it look we've been
[57:27] predestinated unto adoption
[57:29] we know that the whole world is groaning
[57:31] and waiting for the manifestation of the
[57:33] sons of god
[57:35] so there has to be an individual work
[57:37] and something that god is wanting to
[57:39] accomplish
[57:40] in your life we can't be looking around
[57:43] at the whole church body
[57:46] and you know i was fellowshipping with a
[57:48] brother here not too long ago about the
[57:49] nine spiritual gifts and operation of
[57:51] the church
[57:52] the prophet said it i believe it
[57:55] and we don't believe it by a handing
[57:57] down of gifts but i believe that
[57:59] each one of us were a body that's fitted
[58:02] and joined together and each one of you
[58:05] are possessing an
[58:06] attribute of everything our pastor has
[58:08] been talking about you possess an
[58:10] attribute and a character and it's
[58:12] something that's in you
[58:13] that will provide and minister to the
[58:16] body in its season or in its time or in
[58:18] the maturity
[58:19] when you come into your position
[58:22] i can't look around and be discouraged
[58:24] that oh you know
[58:25] uh this isn't happening here this isn't
[58:27] happening there i got to worry about
[58:29] this guy
[58:30] i got to worry about denying myself
[58:32] because i mean look we come to church
[58:34] and the church house just two times
[58:36] a week what about the rest of the hours
[58:40] throughout the week
[58:42] that you're out there toiling in the
[58:44] things of the world
[58:45] everybody wants to come under the church

[1:00:14] world's against him
[1:00:16] well if we ever live in an hour where
[1:00:19] the whole world

[1:00:21] against you

[1:00:26] it's the grace of god
[1:00:28] you keep preaching this gospel it might
[1:00:30] happen you might end up on the news

[1:00:49] if i have to lose
[1:00:50] my life for his sake hallelujah oh if
[1:00:54] that's what it comes to if it comes to
[1:00:56] the government
[1:00:57] shutting down the doors as it comes to
[1:00:58] me having no career if it comes to me
[1:01:01] losing my home

[1:01:06] it i will follow him
[1:01:07] as for me and my house we will serve the
[1:01:10] lord this bride won't be shut up
[1:01:12] she's going to be taken up
[1:01:14] [Applause]
[1:01:15] we got to live this word we got to speak
[1:01:18] this word we got to be the word
[1:01:22] hey we're we're we've we're being
[1:01:24] restored back
[1:01:28] and not to
[1:01:35] lord help us
[1:01:39] look the world is
[1:01:42] god is allowing the world to set up in
[1:01:45] the exact
[1:01:46] condition that he knew it would be in
[1:01:49] to manifest what he has been planning
[1:01:52] since before the foundation of the world
[1:01:55] oh he predestinated you to be here
[1:01:59] to be the super church to be the super
[1:02:01] race
[1:02:02] to be that bride that's predestinated
[1:02:05] not to
[1:02:06] fall in the face of all
[1:02:09] ungodliness in the face of the most
[1:02:12] wicked age that's been here
[1:02:14] since time began god has allowed it to
[1:02:18] get to position
[1:02:19] i believe it's a look away to jesus uh
[1:02:21] brother branham says it's december
[1:02:23] 12 29 63 says i know i now know what the
[1:02:26] third pull is
[1:02:27] and what it does it does he says you
[1:02:29] might notice a little stepping back in
[1:02:31] my ministry
[1:02:32] you might see me looking back waiting
[1:02:34] for something to happen to manifest
[1:02:36] he says but we got to wait for this over
[1:02:38] here to catch up
[1:02:40] now this is just little matthew's of
[1:02:42] thinking and i'm reminded of how abraham
[1:02:45] was told
[1:02:46] god told him that your people will
[1:02:47] sojourn in a strange land
[1:02:49] for 400 years but the time of
[1:02:52] deliverance will come
[1:02:53] but it's not yet because the iniquity of
[1:02:56] the amorites are not
[1:02:57] full and i believe it's in uh uh the
[1:03:00] seat shall not be aired with a shuck i'm
[1:03:02] not sure but brother brahman says
[1:03:03] we're waiting for the iniquity of these
[1:03:06] modern ammonites
[1:03:07] to fill up it's not full yet but i say
[1:03:10] to take a look around it looks pretty
[1:03:13] full to me
[1:03:15] and he said there will be a moses and
[1:03:17] there will be a message
[1:03:19] to take his children in an exodus and
[1:03:21] into a rapture
[1:03:23] oh how blessed we are to be living in
[1:03:25] the time
[1:03:26] of the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:03:31] oh my but you know what
[1:03:34] we're not we're not at the big taking
[1:03:37] chunks and blocks off of the
[1:03:38] the masterpiece you know there comes
[1:03:42] down that time where
[1:03:44] as brother random preachers the
[1:03:45] masterpiece and the great sculptor he
[1:03:48] gets down there and
[1:03:49] but when it comes to the eyes when it
[1:03:51] comes to
[1:03:52] shaping out the ears and the eyes and
[1:03:54] everything oh
[1:03:55] it's just that little fine-tuning
[1:03:59] maybe i could say it like that a little
[1:04:01] self-denial
[1:04:04] where we start looking at our personal
[1:04:06] life
[1:04:07] we start looking into what we're doing
[1:04:09] with our time
[1:04:11] and how we're praying and how we're
[1:04:13] redeeming the time
[1:04:15] and realize that those are the things
[1:04:17] that jesus christ is interested in
[1:04:22] david says in psalms
[1:04:29] i don't think i finished out the quote
[1:04:37] we'll just start here if we didn't where
[1:04:38] is our arnold one winklers
[1:04:40] in this world again today where's men of
[1:04:42] integrity where's men with spirit
[1:04:45] they're so wishy-washy and garmed up
[1:04:47] until they don't know where they stand
[1:04:49] god let me stand with the principles of
[1:04:52] one man as a minister
[1:04:54] the word of jesus christ for heavens and
[1:04:56] earth will pass away but it shall never
[1:04:57] fail
[1:04:58] on this rock i'll build my church the
[1:05:00] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[1:05:02] it
[1:05:02] david in psalms 139 verse 23
[1:05:06] says search me oh god
[1:05:09] and know my heart try me and know my
[1:05:12] thoughts
[1:05:13] and see if there be any wicked way
[1:05:17] in me and lead me in the way everlasting
[1:05:22] i want to say that there's more that i
[1:05:24] can do
[1:05:28] maybe maybe you're there
[1:05:31] but i'm i'm looking at myself now
[1:05:34] through the lens of self-denial that's
[1:05:37] maybe what the burden of my heart
[1:05:39] is is that we'll look through that lens
[1:05:41] of self-denial
[1:05:43] and look at what more can we do
[1:05:46] there's a greater humility there's a
[1:05:49] greater
[1:05:50] surrender there's a greater sincerity
[1:05:54] that the bride of jesus christ must
[1:05:56] obtain
[1:05:57] as that capstone is settling down upon
[1:06:00] us
[1:06:00] it must be perfect love
[1:06:06] and yes we might see it exhibited in
[1:06:08] moments
[1:06:10] or maybe if i could speak for myself i
[1:06:12] see the change
[1:06:14] i see the supernatural i see the holy
[1:06:16] spirit
[1:06:17] of the molding and the shaping and all
[1:06:20] how glorious it is and the more he molds
[1:06:23] and the more he shapes and the more he
[1:06:25] reveals oh
[1:06:26] i see there's so much more to go and so
[1:06:29] much
[1:06:30] more in me that needs to die out to come
[1:06:32] into that position
[1:06:33] of adoption and come into that placing
[1:06:35] of the sun
[1:06:38] that's the important thing we're not
[1:06:39] playing church we're not part of a lodge
[1:06:40] we're not part of some religion
[1:06:44] we're not some some group
[1:06:47] like like israel was just because you're
[1:06:50] a part of it and born in it by
[1:06:52] by you know by by natural reason no
[1:06:56] this is an individual relationship with
[1:06:58] jesus christ where he
[1:07:00] personally chose you to manifest his
[1:07:03] spirit
[1:07:04] in you in the last age and there has to
[1:07:07] be something in you that's hungering and
[1:07:09] thirsting for that word to be manifested
[1:07:12] i'm not satisfied i've got to have more
[1:07:16] i got to die i want to see him
[1:07:20] and him alone when i wake up till i go
[1:07:23] to bed let me see
[1:07:24] jesus christ in me
[1:07:29] oh because that's where communion is
[1:07:32] that's where fellowship
[1:07:33] is that's where in that self-denial you
[1:07:35] come so
[1:07:36] in love with him to everything you think
[1:07:39] of
[1:07:40] everything you breathe everything you
[1:07:42] desire it's all him and him alone
[1:07:45] god bring us into that place
[1:07:48] sometimes it takes a squeeze takes trial
[1:07:53] it takes tribulation it takes the
[1:07:55] condition of the age to bring out the
[1:07:57] character
[1:07:58] in the gold takes a little fire
[1:08:02] takes a little trial takes a little
[1:08:05] bearing across takes a little
[1:08:08] persecution
[1:08:13] job this great warrior prophet was a
[1:08:16] mighty man in his day
[1:08:20] no doubt
[1:08:25] that he had been brought up and had
[1:08:26] served the lord all his life
[1:08:29] i lived had lived such a gallant life to
[1:08:31] the people
[1:08:33] all had respect for him but he come to a
[1:08:36] place
[1:08:36] to where he calls it here being tempted
[1:08:39] of the lord but i'd like to use the word
[1:08:41] being tested
[1:08:42] by the lord and truly
[1:08:47] maybe you're wondering why you're going
[1:08:48] through what you're going through right
[1:08:50] now
[1:08:52] maybe you're wondering why 2020 has to
[1:08:54] be the way it is
[1:08:56] you know i i uh i i you know i don't
[1:09:00] mind testifying over 2019 was a very
[1:09:03] difficult year a challenging year
[1:09:07] uh for for me and my family and
[1:09:11] and you know i uh and god given me a son
[1:09:13] and that name
[1:09:14] you know uh meaning victory and and the
[1:09:17] grace of god you know i was looking to
[1:09:19] 2020
[1:09:20] and saying you know 2020
[1:09:23] you're a victory well i got a little
[1:09:26] through the year and i was reminded that
[1:09:28] you can't have a victory without a
[1:09:29] battle
[1:09:30] and 2020 has been a battle it's been a
[1:09:34] test
[1:09:34] but you can't have victory without a
[1:09:37] test
[1:09:39] and truly every son that cometh to god
[1:09:41] must be first
[1:09:42] tested tried child trained
[1:09:46] and then if the testing gets hard and we
[1:09:49] think it's
[1:09:50] too hard and won't listen take heed
[1:09:53] then he said we become an illegitimate
[1:09:55] illegitimate child
[1:09:58] and not a child of god because there's
[1:10:01] nothing
[1:10:02] can move a real born-again
[1:10:05] child of god away from his parents see
[1:10:09] he's part of him you can no more deny it
[1:10:14] then you can deny yourself go ahead and
[1:10:17] tell me i'm not a mcgeary
[1:10:20] go ahead and tell me that are you coming
[1:10:22] away too late
[1:10:24] go ahead and tell me i don't act like
[1:10:25] one i can look in the mirror
[1:10:28] and i can see uh that i look like a man
[1:10:31] i look like my daddy
[1:10:33] you know i'm reminded at one time i was
[1:10:36] sitting in church in arizona and they
[1:10:37] had one of the side doors like this but
[1:10:39] it was glass
[1:10:40] and but it was blackened out and i was
[1:10:43] sitting there and i was praying before
[1:10:44] the service
[1:10:45] and i looked up and i was so shocked i
[1:10:47] said in the reflection i saw my dad
[1:10:50] i'm like what's my dad doing here and i
[1:10:52] look back
[1:10:53] i'm like that's me because i saw myself
[1:10:58] in the reflection oh hallelujah isn't
[1:11:01] that just the same thing that happened
[1:11:02] to you
[1:11:03] you were out there in the barnyard of
[1:11:05] sin you were out there living out in the
[1:11:08] world
[1:11:08] and there was something inside of you
[1:11:10] that was crying out
[1:11:12] for more and all of a sudden that mother
[1:11:14] eagle
[1:11:15] come over the barnyard and screamed out
[1:11:18] to you
[1:11:19] and called your name and all of a sudden
[1:11:21] you looked up
[1:11:22] you looked around he looked up you hey
[1:11:24] that's me i
[1:11:26] identified with that why it was calling
[1:11:28] your name
[1:11:29] because that's where you came from
[1:11:32] oh there's something in you that
[1:11:34] identifies with the word
[1:11:36] you can't shake me from it
[1:11:40] you can you can try to become a magiri
[1:11:43] all you want
[1:11:44] you can study himagiri you can you can
[1:11:47] mimic a magiri
[1:11:48] but there's only two ways that you can
[1:11:50] be a magiri
[1:11:51] you got to be born one or married one
[1:11:54] and i want to tell you the bride of
[1:11:56] jesus christ the only way
[1:11:58] you can be proud of jesus christ is
[1:12:00] because you were born
[1:12:02] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:12:04] the world
[1:12:05] with that wedding band at predestination
[1:12:07] and you are married to jesus christ
[1:12:10] oh you can mimic it all you want
[1:12:14] but all the mimics all the impersonators
[1:12:16] when it gets down to real tough living
[1:12:19] when it gets down to the persecution
[1:12:21] when it gets down to bearing your cross
[1:12:24] they don't have the ability to do it
[1:12:26] because it's not
[1:12:27] who they are all but you you're going to
[1:12:30] crest every wave
[1:12:32] you're going to crest every storm
[1:12:34] because it's who you are
[1:12:36] and it's not that it's you it's christ
[1:12:38] living in you
[1:12:40] oh thank you jesus hallelujah
[1:12:51] oh praise the lord
[1:12:58] oh my when you're born of him
[1:13:01] your party the same life that was in the
[1:13:05] bridegroom tree
[1:13:07] is in the bride tree so then everything
[1:13:10] you do
[1:13:11] declares him now that sounds and looks
[1:13:15] good on paper
[1:13:17] that gets us all excited but i i i'm
[1:13:20] talking about self-denial
[1:13:23] because all that seed in there gets to
[1:13:25] hopping it gets to jumping
[1:13:27] it gets all excited about the word and
[1:13:29] then now i gotta live it
[1:13:32] and then i start looking there's this
[1:13:34] other me
[1:13:36] oh there's this other cross there's this
[1:13:38] other dead man you gotta pack around
[1:13:43] and you gotta start bringing that guy
[1:13:45] into subjection
[1:13:47] you're called to it you have the
[1:13:49] potential to do it
[1:13:51] but oh there has to be such a
[1:13:53] self-denial
[1:13:56] timothy said in second timothy 3 12
[1:13:59] oh my just think of it
[1:14:02] the prophet would always say if you had
[1:14:05] the spirit of beethoven
[1:14:07] you'd be able to play the piano you had
[1:14:10] the spirit of an artist or painter you'd
[1:14:11] be able to paint
[1:14:14] if you have the spirit of a gangster i
[1:14:16] love how brother brandon uses that you
[1:14:18] say you'd be packing a gun
[1:14:20] if you had the spirit of a mechanic i
[1:14:22] tell you what's wrong with your car
[1:14:24] and if you have the spirit of jesus
[1:14:26] christ these
[1:14:28] signs shall follow them that believe my
[1:14:30] name they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:14:32] they shall recover
[1:14:33] my name they're going to cast out devils
[1:14:36] right because it's the same life second
[1:14:39] timothy 3 12 says all
[1:14:41] that will live godly in christ jesus
[1:14:44] shall suffer
[1:14:45] persecution and the prophet said if
[1:14:49] you're not
[1:14:50] suffering persecution for christ's sake
[1:14:53] then there's something wrong the devil
[1:14:57] if the devil ain't after you he's got
[1:15:00] you
[1:15:02] now i'm wanting to encourage us
[1:15:07] and i'm wanting us to take a step up
[1:15:09] higher
[1:15:10] because we know we've we've been
[1:15:13] delivered from sin
[1:15:14] we know we've been changed but i'm i'm
[1:15:16] wanting to speak
[1:15:18] from the place that's on my heart is
[1:15:20] that there's more
[1:15:22] that we can give and there's more that
[1:15:25] we can surrender
[1:15:27] and there's areas in our life that may
[1:15:30] be the reason why you're not struggling
[1:15:32] there or the reason
[1:15:34] you're not having uh to keep your guard
[1:15:36] up is because
[1:15:37] maybe he's already got you so i just
[1:15:40] want to bring that to your attention as
[1:15:42] we keep moving because
[1:15:44] we're talking about we got to deny
[1:15:46] ourselves we got to deny the flesh
[1:15:48] and when you do that there's going to be
[1:15:49] a cross to bear there's going to be
[1:15:51] persecution
[1:15:55] i mean look you might you might lose
[1:15:58] your job
[1:15:59] you might get kicked out of your school
[1:16:02] you might not be able to afford your
[1:16:03] mortgage
[1:16:04] and and pay your bills because the stand
[1:16:07] you make or the job you didn't take
[1:16:09] because it conflicted
[1:16:12] with the spirit man the inward man
[1:16:16] but if it's for christ's sake
[1:16:19] he'll i've never seen the righteous
[1:16:21] forsaken or
[1:16:22] baking bread and i tell you the prophet
[1:16:25] of god said if you do it for him
[1:16:28] oh he'll reward you a thousand times
[1:16:30] over
[1:16:31] and i challenge you and i've seen it
[1:16:33] time and time and time again in my own
[1:16:36] life
[1:16:36] where i didn't have the ability i didn't
[1:16:39] have the funds i didn't have the means
[1:16:41] and every time he was right on time but
[1:16:44] it wasn't my
[1:16:45] time it was his time and i say oh just
[1:16:47] keep waiting upon the lord those
[1:16:50] who wait upon the lord shall mount up
[1:16:52] with wings
[1:16:53] like eagles
[1:16:56] jesus said in that verse 26 he said for
[1:16:59] what
[1:17:00] what is what is a what is a man profited
[1:17:04] if he shall gain the whole world and
[1:17:05] lose his soul
[1:17:09] and just looking at jesus's words here
[1:17:11] in luke 22 42
[1:17:15] he said father if thou be willing
[1:17:19] remove this cup from me nevertheless
[1:17:23] not my will but thine
[1:17:26] be done now just pulling some things
[1:17:29] together one thing thou lackest
[1:17:32] i say lord show me where i'm lacking let
[1:17:36] me pray
[1:17:37] like david said and say search me o god
[1:17:40] know my heart see if there be any wicked
[1:17:43] way in me
[1:17:44] i just pray that you could take that to
[1:17:46] heart look it's
[1:17:47] we don't have to have it all figured out
[1:17:50] he's not requiring you to be perfect
[1:17:52] within yourself
[1:17:53] you're going to have shortcomings you're
[1:17:55] going to have failures you're going to
[1:17:56] have
[1:17:57] places where it doesn't add up but he
[1:17:58] wants to be the difference
[1:18:00] let him be the difference oh say lord
[1:18:03] i've been struggling with this
[1:18:05] time and time and time again but lord
[1:18:08] here i am
[1:18:09] you're dealing with my heart lord and i
[1:18:11] want to resolve this i want to give it
[1:18:13] to you lord i want to deny my pride
[1:18:15] i want to deny myself and i'm willing
[1:18:18] lord for you to come in and take control
[1:18:23] you know a lot of people say they're
[1:18:27] bearing the cross but really they're
[1:18:29] just living out the letter
[1:18:32] and the letter killeth but the spirit
[1:18:36] is what giveth life and just in thinking
[1:18:39] of that
[1:18:41] you know i was thinking about ananias
[1:18:43] and sapphira
[1:18:45] they were all going to the same church
[1:18:48] they were all gathering together in 1104
[1:18:50] central drive all coming in and and
[1:18:53] paying their tithe
[1:18:56] doing doing what appeared
[1:18:59] to be like the rest of everybody there
[1:19:02] in the the new testament setting there
[1:19:04] all of the the disciples and the
[1:19:05] converts of the lord they were selling
[1:19:07] everything they had and they had all
[1:19:08] things in common
[1:19:10] well ananias and sapphira decided that
[1:19:13] you know what
[1:19:15] we'll jump on the bandwagon it looks
[1:19:18] good
[1:19:19] it looks right so let's go ahead and
[1:19:21] sell
[1:19:22] sell out sell off our lands but let's
[1:19:25] keep back a little bit
[1:19:28] let's not go all in
[1:19:31] and so they tried to appear
[1:19:35] to to be a bona fide believer and when
[1:19:38] they came and placed their works
[1:19:41] before the lord peter said why
[1:19:44] why are you lying to god was it not
[1:19:48] yours when you possessed it
[1:19:50] now i i say to you if you are holding
[1:19:54] back
[1:19:56] you're not fooling anybody you're not
[1:19:59] fooling god peter said there he says
[1:20:02] ananias why is satan feel thine heart to
[1:20:05] lie to the holy ghost and
[1:20:07] keep back part of the price of the land
[1:20:11] one thing thou lackest is to
[1:20:14] forsake all to sell all
[1:20:18] now we're driving to a point here with
[1:20:21] with areas in our life where we need to
[1:20:24] deny
[1:20:25] our own interest our own
[1:20:29] times that we we appease ourselves
[1:20:32] and really allow christ to come into
[1:20:34] those areas
[1:20:38] you know the prophet and in christ the
[1:20:40] mystery of god revealed he said why you
[1:20:42] hunger why do you thirst
[1:20:44] he said god's wanting to reveal himself
[1:20:47] to you he's wanting to give you this
[1:20:48] this great revelation at the end time he
[1:20:50] said but you let so many things get
[1:20:52] out of you he said you let your wife you
[1:20:55] let your children you let your job
[1:20:57] you let your church you let your pastor
[1:21:00] all of those things can take it out of
[1:21:02] you and if i could just
[1:21:03] uh uh just bear my heart personally
[1:21:06] before you
[1:21:07] as you know the lord opened the door for
[1:21:09] for for me by his grace to minister the
[1:21:11] gospel
[1:21:12] something tomorrow i said lord may i
[1:21:13] never allow that to appease
[1:21:15] my desire for lost souls may i never
[1:21:18] stop
[1:21:19] uh testifying in the markets and on the
[1:21:22] street corners
[1:21:23] because i feel that i have now satisfied
[1:21:26] something else but i say oh god i don't
[1:21:29] want to to allow church or church order
[1:21:32] or just our duty here
[1:21:34] to appease something that he's calling
[1:21:36] us to do more out there
[1:21:41] we don't want to just uh uh uh be given
[1:21:44] into that
[1:21:46] but we're hungering and thirsting for
[1:21:54] more
[1:21:57] samson gave his strength
[1:22:00] to god to use but he didn't give god his
[1:22:03] heart
[1:22:04] he gave his heart to deliah delilah and
[1:22:07] he gave his strength to god
[1:22:08] but you've got to surrender soul body
[1:22:13] spirit strength everything you are to
[1:22:16] the will of god
[1:22:17] become a prisoner to him you're going to
[1:22:20] be somebody's prisoner
[1:22:22] you don't belong to yourself you're
[1:22:24] somebody's prisoner you're either a
[1:22:26] prisoner of the devil
[1:22:28] knowing this truth and won't surrender
[1:22:30] to it
[1:22:31] i say god god help us
[1:22:35] if you're trying to serve this message
[1:22:38] by intellect and in yourself it'll drive
[1:22:42] you insane
[1:22:45] and then you go to try to figure out the
[1:22:47] quotes and try to figure out everything
[1:22:48] and one minister says it this way and
[1:22:50] the other says it that way and then you
[1:22:51] listen to the tape and you think you got
[1:22:52] it and the prophet says it a completely
[1:22:54] different way and you're like
[1:22:56] i know of a a a minister who was a
[1:22:58] pastor in this message and i believe the
[1:23:00] reason he had
[1:23:01] mental breakdowns is because he was
[1:23:03] trying to pastor a church in this truth
[1:23:05] and didn't have a revelation of it and
[1:23:08] he
[1:23:08] eventually succumbed to it but we got a
[1:23:12] you're either a prisoner of the devil
[1:23:14] and i say this he was a prisoner could
[1:23:15] you imagine
[1:23:17] that responsibility knowing this truth
[1:23:20] and won't surrender
[1:23:21] to it or a prisoner to the world and
[1:23:24] surrender to god
[1:23:24] it's one or the other you're either the
[1:23:27] devil's prisoner to sin or you're god's
[1:23:29] prisoner to righteousness
[1:23:30] you're one or the other
[1:23:33] and just where i want to maybe work
[1:23:35] towards a close here
[1:23:36] is you have to know your enemy
[1:23:40] you got to know your enemy in james 1 14
[1:23:43] it says but every man is tempted
[1:23:46] when he is drawn away of the devils
[1:23:50] no no they got it up there when he is
[1:23:53] drawn away
[1:23:54] of his own lust you mean
[1:23:57] i got i got my own cross and i got my
[1:23:59] own lust
[1:24:00] you mean there's things that i got to do
[1:24:03] i got a part to play but every man is
[1:24:06] tempted when he's drawn away of his own
[1:24:07] lust
[1:24:08] and enticed then when lusts have
[1:24:10] conceived
[1:24:11] it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is
[1:24:13] finished bringing forth death
[1:24:15] look your greatest enemy is your
[1:24:18] self and as we work towards our clothes
[1:24:21] here that's why we're just laboring
[1:24:22] there on self
[1:24:24] denial but you're tempted and drawn away
[1:24:27] by your own lust and i think the problem
[1:24:30] of it many times is
[1:24:31] we run out into the world we're going to
[1:24:34] go be the the bride of jesus christ
[1:24:36] we're going to go witness and we're
[1:24:37] going to
[1:24:38] go testify and work man we're we're
[1:24:40] watching everything that's going on in
[1:24:42] the world and all these movements and
[1:24:43] everything that's going in the political
[1:24:45] scene
[1:24:45] and we go into the stores and and ladies
[1:24:47] you'll see us just flashing its signs
[1:24:49] all around and everything and my we got
[1:24:50] our head down
[1:24:51] but if you have forgot who your greatest
[1:24:54] enemy is you better watch out
[1:24:57] because your greatest enemy is yourself
[1:25:00] and i'm reminded of how jesus when he
[1:25:02] was in the garden there in gassimity
[1:25:04] he was praying there and just think of
[1:25:06] the agony
[1:25:07] and oh my this here he's coming to this
[1:25:10] place
[1:25:10] of of of surrender and he's in such
[1:25:13] agony till
[1:25:14] his sweat is turning into blood and he
[1:25:16] comes to his disciples
[1:25:19] and he said watch and pray
[1:25:24] rise and pray lest you enter
[1:25:27] into temptation
[1:25:31] just marvel at that phrase there as
[1:25:34] jesus is
[1:25:35] surrendering us all and and forsaking
[1:25:38] his
[1:25:39] own will and denying himself
[1:25:42] that's where it said in matthew 10 33
[1:25:44] but whosoever shall deny me before men
[1:25:47] him will i also deny before my father
[1:25:49] which is in heaven
[1:25:51] and i just in closing want to
[1:25:54] you know it's it it might not be too
[1:25:56] difficult
[1:25:57] to go out into the community to go to
[1:26:00] the store
[1:26:01] might not be too difficult to come to
[1:26:03] the church house
[1:26:05] and to profess christ's name and to be a
[1:26:08] good example but you know
[1:26:09] where the hardest time it is to do that
[1:26:13] if you deny me before men you know that
[1:26:14] includes yourself
[1:26:17] i'm speaking personally this is how the
[1:26:18] lord is dealing with my heart
[1:26:21] oh you can you can go out there and and
[1:26:24] and be a good example you can go out
[1:26:26] there and live a christian life but what
[1:26:27] good does it do
[1:26:29] if in your private time and in your life
[1:26:31] and in your family
[1:26:32] and how you deal with your wife and your
[1:26:34] children and how
[1:26:36] you witness around your personal area in
[1:26:38] your home
[1:26:39] if you are not exhibiting the very life
[1:26:41] of jesus christ in everything you do and
[1:26:44] everything you say
[1:26:46] then you're denying do you know you can
[1:26:48] actually deny him
[1:26:51] by not denying yourself you know i
[1:26:54] worked really hard today i come home
[1:26:56] you know and man i just need to blow off
[1:26:58] some steam i'm just going to relax i'm
[1:27:00] just going to look at the news i'm just
[1:27:02] going to play a game i'm just going to
[1:27:03] do
[1:27:04] things that are lawful
[1:27:08] but not expedient but do you realize in
[1:27:10] that
[1:27:12] i believe god is calling for something
[1:27:14] more
[1:27:15] a greater surrender
[1:27:20] a greater dying out we'll just keep
[1:27:23] moving here paul said we
[1:27:24] we we gotta mortify the deeds of the
[1:27:27] flesh in romans 8 13 if they could
[1:27:29] bring that up if you live after the
[1:27:31] flesh you shall die
[1:27:32] yes sir but if you live through the
[1:27:35] spirit
[1:27:39] i had to hand write that down there and
[1:27:41] i can't read moan writing but if you
[1:27:43] through the spirit do mortify the deeds
[1:27:45] of the body
[1:27:46] ye shall live
[1:27:51] jesus said behold i send you out into
[1:27:54] the world sheep amongst wolves
[1:27:58] but what i'm what i'm admonishing is
[1:28:01] you know we got to be wise as a serpent
[1:28:03] and harmless as a dove
[1:28:07] let's not forget about this guy we got
[1:28:10] to recognize the ground that we're
[1:28:12] standing on when we go into the world
[1:28:14] the world when we go online when we go
[1:28:16] to school when we go to the store
[1:28:18] look this is this is satan's eden
[1:28:22] it's rich it's increased with good it's
[1:28:24] uh uh you know
[1:28:26] they're rich and don't need of nothing
[1:28:27] but what was the admonishment
[1:28:33] and knoweth it not that you're miserable
[1:28:36] blind poor wretched and naked
[1:28:39] and i i believe what god is just really
[1:28:42] wanting to press
[1:28:43] is that there's areas in our life where
[1:28:46] we have allowed the five senses and the
[1:28:49] conscience
[1:28:50] memory and affection to come into such a
[1:28:53] way where we don't even know that the
[1:28:55] devil has a stronghold in your life
[1:28:58] and i'm going to use a very specific
[1:29:01] example
[1:29:02] and i pray that this is the burden of my
[1:29:04] heart maybe some would call it a
[1:29:06] hobbyhorse of mine but i just
[1:29:08] something i just struck my heart it was
[1:29:10] saturday night
[1:29:11] uh while i was in ohio it was two in the
[1:29:13] morning and something just
[1:29:15] struck me on my heart about who
[1:29:18] are you following
[1:29:24] who are you following overcome means to
[1:29:28] recognize the devil
[1:29:30] at every one of his tricks so
[1:29:33] the devil is being exposed
[1:29:38] and that's what the word said he said
[1:29:39] you don't know and i counsel
[1:29:42] of thee to buy me gold tried and fired i
[1:29:44] counsel of thee to buy of me i sav
[1:29:46] i pray by the word now coming that we're
[1:29:49] receiving i save
[1:29:51] and i just want to point this out the
[1:29:53] you know the internet
[1:29:54] now influences you to make a statement
[1:29:57] it wants you to give your approval
[1:29:59] it wants you to make a decision or take
[1:30:01] a side
[1:30:03] like like do a like i like or i follow
[1:30:08] it seems so innocent because you seem to
[1:30:11] appear so
[1:30:12] anonymous but i wonder if the things
[1:30:16] that you're liking
[1:30:17] and the things that you're following if
[1:30:18] it was physically
[1:30:20] standing before us would you get in line
[1:30:26] would you
[1:30:30] brother what do you what your thumb
[1:30:32] you're liking that
[1:30:34] and i did a little uh
[1:30:38] i wanted to see and i i was with my wife
[1:30:41] and i looked into some of these things
[1:30:43] that
[1:30:43] that people are using you know you like
[1:30:47] you follow or you give it a thumbs up
[1:30:49] it's there to engage your interaction
[1:30:52] and i went on this platform because i
[1:30:54] wanted to see what it was and it's
[1:30:56] called uh
[1:31:00] completely mind blank on it i know i got
[1:31:02] a written sound somewhere
[1:31:05] instagram went on instagram
[1:31:09] and oh my
[1:31:12] i i went on there to to see and and you
[1:31:15] know i i
[1:31:16] uploaded it here and and i mean it's
[1:31:18] just like a oh it's
[1:31:20] it's just a social media platform you
[1:31:22] know that you can
[1:31:23] i guess connect with people so i hit the
[1:31:26] explore button
[1:31:27] and oh my lands
[1:31:30] that that was uh that was i was like
[1:31:32] okay that's pretty wild
[1:31:33] so i i googled uh
[1:31:37] why would you know there's no
[1:31:40] interaction why would all these
[1:31:41] suggestions be there
[1:31:42] and it said in snapchat what you have to
[1:31:45] do if you're receiving images
[1:31:47] and and and people's social activities
[1:31:50] and and
[1:31:50] and platforms and their look everything
[1:31:53] you can think of is on that
[1:31:55] if you want to go type in a believer's
[1:31:57] name because you want to connect with
[1:31:59] him it's going to give you a
[1:32:00] recommendation of a bunch of nonsense
[1:32:02] you don't want to see
[1:32:04] now i'm talking about self-denial and
[1:32:07] recognizing your worst enemy
[1:32:10] and so i researched and said what you
[1:32:12] have to do
[1:32:14] is you have to click on the image then
[1:32:16] you have to select
[1:32:18] that you don't like the image to not
[1:32:21] receive any more suggestions
[1:32:24] what a trap of hell
[1:32:32] and so if i'm going to clean up my
[1:32:34] portfolio
[1:32:36] i'm going to have to go to the strip
[1:32:38] cheese club to see if
[1:32:40] it's not in me are you kidding me
[1:32:44] no i'm being i'm being forthright with
[1:32:46] you now and i believe as believers we're
[1:32:48] fooling with things we have no business
[1:32:50] with
[1:32:51] and if we are expecting the coming of
[1:32:53] the lord why
[1:32:54] are we dealing and dallying with the
[1:32:56] things of the world
[1:32:57] that are trying to destroy your soul
[1:33:01] now listen to this oh like or a follower
[1:33:04] just please if you can give me your
[1:33:05] attention here as we we just finish out
[1:33:09] a like or a follower thumbs up rate it
[1:33:12] but it wants you to engage with the
[1:33:13] interaction

[1:34:45] on a specific area of our life by
[1:34:48] cultivating a habit
[1:34:53] hey i'm guilty i woke up in the morning
[1:34:57] to look at my time and my thumb presses
[1:34:59] the google button
[1:35:00] okay what are you doing you're also
[1:35:03] you're scrolling at the news you haven't
[1:35:04] done prayed you haven't read your bible
[1:35:05] you haven't done nothing now works
[1:35:07] calling
[1:35:07] and all of a sudden you're going out in
[1:35:09] the world defiled and you totally forgot
[1:35:11] who the greatest enemy was was yourself
[1:35:16] now i'm getting down home because it's
[1:35:17] going home time
[1:35:19] and some of this stuff we've been
[1:35:21] fooling with is nonsense
[1:35:22] and we wonder why there's sickness in
[1:35:24] the church we wonder why we ain't got no
[1:35:26] victory we wonder why there's not
[1:35:28] certain things in manifestation
[1:35:30] it's because we're not living out the
[1:35:31] word of god
[1:35:33] i'm preaching to myself so much so
[1:35:39] that if you have 10 minutes before your
[1:35:42] ride
[1:35:43] arrives the apps you habitually reach
[1:35:47] for
[1:35:47] are probably all listed above
[1:35:51] oh my are we guilty
[1:35:56] you want to be entertained youtube you
[1:35:59] want to capture a moment
[1:36:01] instagram or facebook you want to talk
[1:36:04] with a friend
[1:36:05] whatsapp or messenger and so on
[1:36:09] one of them has been able to engage
[1:36:12] users
[1:36:12] and get them to keep coming back so
[1:36:15] often that it's now
[1:36:16] second nature to them
[1:36:21] oh this this this might be juvenile
[1:36:25] but this is reality listen this is
[1:36:28] exposing the devil
[1:36:30] they were bragging about this of what
[1:36:33] they've been able to accomplish in
[1:36:35] satan's eden is getting believers
[1:36:39] to use their apps and their technology
[1:36:41] as second
[1:36:42] hand nature self-help got it under
[1:36:46] control
[1:36:47] self-help go here i need this i need
[1:36:50] that
[1:36:52] where's the lord in this whole picture
[1:36:55] every one of them has been able to
[1:36:57] engage users and get them to keep coming
[1:36:59] back so often
[1:37:00] that it's now second nature to them
[1:37:03] this author i thought it was striking he
[1:37:06] was from israel
[1:37:07] moved here when he was three years old
[1:37:08] and wrote a book named hooked
[1:37:12] once a habit is formed the user is no
[1:37:14] longer considering whether they should
[1:37:16] open an
[1:37:17] app they check the app every day
[1:37:20] automatically without thinking much
[1:37:22] about it
[1:37:24] and that's the secret to their success
[1:37:26] these are the apps that users
[1:37:29] return to every day whether they're
[1:37:31] conscious about it
[1:37:32] or not
[1:37:35] knoweth it not maybe if the musicians
[1:37:38] would come
[1:37:41] benjamin you can get ready for the
[1:37:42] baptism
[1:37:46] an app what is an app short for
[1:37:49] the name application
[1:37:53] application the definition of
[1:37:54] application is the action
[1:37:56] of putting something into operation
[1:38:00] well man you know what i i've been
[1:38:02] allowing the five senses my conscience
[1:38:04] memory affection to put me into action
[1:38:06] for the wrong thing
[1:38:09] i've been engaging maybe in the apps or
[1:38:11] i've been engaging in the news i've been
[1:38:12] engaging in the technology i've been
[1:38:14] interacting with the world around me and
[1:38:17] it becomes
[1:38:17] second hand nature i'm just gonna check
[1:38:20] the whatsapp i'm gonna check the
[1:38:21] instagram
[1:38:22] i'm gonna check the news i'm gonna check
[1:38:24] the entertainment and you're not even
[1:38:25] checking while jesus sits there with
[1:38:27] dirty feet
[1:38:30] because we're so busy engaging with lady
[1:38:33] aussia
[1:38:42] paul said that the word came in power
[1:38:46] as well as voice now i'm looking to the
[1:38:48] other side now
[1:38:50] if apps and applications and technology
[1:38:55] can move people and put them into action
[1:38:59] and cause a response out of them and be
[1:39:02] a part of satan's eden
[1:39:05] you see how easy it is just the press of
[1:39:07] a button
[1:39:08] god got some beat you don't even have to
[1:39:11] press a button you just got to call his
[1:39:12] name
[1:39:14] pray without cece
[1:39:17] i got 10 minutes before my ride comes
[1:39:19] lord
[1:39:21] what would you have me do you think
[1:39:24] brother branham when that plane came
[1:39:26] down in memphis
[1:39:28] he was on snapchat twitter instagram
[1:39:33] youtube
[1:39:38] he was listening for that whirlwind
[1:39:42] i tried to take the human humanity out
[1:39:44] of brother branham
[1:39:45] but i'm i am talking about an example
[1:39:47] who came to a place of adoption and
[1:39:48] maturity
[1:39:52] if we could just finish
[1:39:55] the word preach actually demonstrated
[1:39:57] itself let me just start that oh paul
[1:39:59] said that the word came in power as well
[1:40:01] as voice
[1:40:02] the word preached actually demonstrated
[1:40:04] itself like a flaming cutting sword that
[1:40:06] went to the conscience of men
[1:40:08] and like a surgeon's knife it cut out
[1:40:10] the disease
[1:40:11] and set the captives free everywhere
[1:40:14] those early believers went they went
[1:40:16] preaching the gospel
[1:40:18] word and god confirmed that word was
[1:40:20] signs following
[1:40:21] the sick where hill devils were cast out
[1:40:23] and they spoke
[1:40:24] in new tongues that was the word in
[1:40:27] action
[1:40:27] that word has never failed in the mouths
[1:40:29] of believing christians
[1:40:30] and in this last age it is here stronger
[1:40:34] and greater than ever in the true word
[1:40:37] bride
[1:40:38] oh little flock you little minority hold
[1:40:41] on to the word
[1:40:43] fill your mouth and your heart with it
[1:40:45] and someday
[1:40:46] god will give you the kingdom
[1:40:50] let's stand
[1:40:53] friends this message has come to put you
[1:40:55] into
[1:40:56] action it's come
[1:41:00] that deep calling to a deep
[1:41:05] you know prophet said that many men have
[1:41:07] set out to conquer
[1:41:09] he starts speaking about napoleon and he
[1:41:12] said at the age of 33 he sat down and
[1:41:15] wept
[1:41:16] because there was nothing else to
[1:41:18] conquer
[1:41:19] and he became an alcoholic and died
[1:41:24] but he said you know what he never was
[1:41:27] able to
[1:41:27] conquer himself
[1:41:33] praise god we got the answer because you
[1:41:36] are called
[1:41:37] you are more than an overcomer and what
[1:41:39] does it mean to overcome
[1:41:41] recognize every trick of the enemy
[1:41:47] but there was another young man who come
[1:41:48] into the world one time
[1:41:51] he died at 33 and he conquered
[1:41:54] everything that could be conquered
[1:41:56] when he was on earth he conquered
[1:41:57] passions pride he conquered sickness
[1:42:00] he conquered devils when he died he
[1:42:03] conquered death when he arose he
[1:42:04] conquered hell
[1:42:06] he went up in and conquered everything
[1:42:08] that was against mankind
[1:42:10] the winepress of god and crushed it down
[1:42:13] and conquered death
[1:42:14] hell grave sickness formalities
[1:42:16] everything else
[1:42:17] and overcome it all and rose on the
[1:42:19] third day and conquered all the
[1:42:21] atmospheres above
[1:42:23] and cut the myths between god and man
[1:42:26] and connected heaven
[1:42:28] and earth together glory oh my there he
[1:42:31] stands the mighty conqueror
[1:42:33] since he ripped the veil into there he
[1:42:35] is he has the keys of both death
[1:42:38] hell hanging on his side fear not
[1:42:41] laid his right hand upon him and raised
[1:42:43] him up
[1:42:45] by the power of his right hand said
[1:42:46] don't fear i'm he that was
[1:42:49] and he that is and shall come i'm the
[1:42:52] first and the last i'm
[1:42:54] he that lived and died and is alive
[1:42:56] forevermore amen
[1:42:57] oh lo behold the mighty conqueror lo
[1:43:00] behold him in plain view there he stands
[1:43:02] the mighty conqueror since he rent the
[1:43:03] villain too
[1:43:05] oh he cut every obstacle from human
[1:43:07] beings
[1:43:08] that they might be connected like in the
[1:43:11] garden of eden
[1:43:12] i was going to choke it out but i'm
[1:43:15] going to say it
[1:43:16] now this is this is my whole
[1:43:20] punch to get into self-denial
[1:43:25] man i'm going to say it man is
[1:43:26] omnipotent
[1:43:28] you don't believe that but he is a man
[1:43:32] fully surrendered to god is omnipotent
[1:43:35] did he not say in mark 11 22 whatsoever
[1:43:38] things you say
[1:43:38] and don't doubt in your heart it'll come
[1:43:41] to pass
[1:43:42] you can't you can have what you said
[1:43:44] what happens when two omnipotents meet
[1:43:47] when god and man comes together to
[1:43:49] omnipotence something's
[1:43:51] got to shake whatsoever you say with
[1:43:54] that creative power omnipotence of god
[1:43:56] knowing that he's promised it and said
[1:43:58] it in his word it creates a power
[1:44:01] that goes out yonder and brings things
[1:44:03] to pass
[1:44:05] something got to shake you know what's
[1:44:06] shaking
[1:44:08] you can't be shook but all the
[1:44:12] unbelief and maybe you haven't been
[1:44:15] denying yourself
[1:44:16] as this word keeps coming all of that
[1:44:19] unbelief has to shake
[1:44:21] and you might as well surrender to it
[1:44:23] and just in saying this last thing
[1:44:26] i was thinking about the prophet of god
[1:44:29] and
[1:44:29] thinking about jesus
[1:44:35] you know
[1:44:38] i was thinking about the third pool and
[1:44:41] speaking the word and brother branham
[1:44:42] speaking squirrels into existence
[1:44:45] and there up on the mountain he spoke to
[1:44:48] the storm and i thought you know that
[1:44:49] doesn't sound
[1:44:51] doesn't sound hard you just speak the
[1:44:54] word
[1:44:55] but what it took to get to that place
[1:45:00] was a full surrender you saw a man stand
[1:45:03] there and god tell him
[1:45:06] go up there and die certain death
[1:45:09] and he had been molded in such a way
[1:45:11] where he was willing to have self-denial
[1:45:13] and lay down his life for his sake
[1:45:16] and say lord if it means my death
[1:45:20] i will follow you and be obedient to
[1:45:22] your word
[1:45:23] and it was through that molding of his
[1:45:25] character brother man talks about when
[1:45:27] he lost his baby and his wife there
[1:45:29] and the devil came he was right there
[1:45:32] buffing it at him and he was just there
[1:45:34] to give up but there was something that
[1:45:35] came from somewhere
[1:45:37] the inward man praise god we have the
[1:45:40] inner
[1:45:41] inward man if we can just deny ourselves
[1:45:44] church deny our our self-gratification
[1:45:49] i had that definition written down of
[1:45:51] self-gratification how
[1:45:53] the impulses and it's so easy to allow
[1:45:55] these five senses
[1:45:56] to gravitate to the things of the world
[1:45:58] saints if we got ten minutes
[1:46:00] if we got five minutes when we wake up
[1:46:04] secondhand nature being the things of
[1:46:06] the world and the bride of jesus christ
[1:46:09] i believe the devil's been exposed
[1:46:12] and i believe i realize we we can have a
[1:46:14] little bit more self-denial and
[1:46:15] surrender
[1:46:16] as we're coming up into that stature of
[1:46:19] a perfect man what are we playing
[1:46:22] oh sir
[1:46:30] [Music]
[1:46:38] oh
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:55] oh just why don't you lift your hands to
[1:47:06] them
[1:47:14] oh just let him search your heart i know
[1:47:17] we have a baptism but
[1:47:20] just look to the lord if there's
[1:47:21] something to surrender surrender
[1:47:26] yes lord
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:41] set me free
[1:47:50] oh search me
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:56] you just want to lift your hands to the
[1:47:57] lord
[1:47:58] [Music]
[1:48:01] maybe as they softly play we'll just say
[1:48:03] a word of prayer
[1:48:13] maybe if you want to lift your hands as
[1:48:14] we'll just say a word of prayer as we
[1:48:16] close the service
[1:48:18] for the baptism there's something in
[1:48:20] your heart that you feel that you could
[1:48:22] surrender
[1:48:24] there's something more that you feel you
[1:48:26] can give why don't you just go ahead and
[1:48:27] lift your hand to him
[1:48:29] just have a moment of prayer heavenly
[1:48:31] father
[1:48:33] as we just close this service in prayer
[1:48:35] we're just looking to you now as they
[1:48:36] softly play lord
[1:48:39] just say lord if there's something in my
[1:48:41] heart if there's something in my life
[1:48:44] there's some wicked way in me lord if
[1:48:46] i've allowed the things of the world to
[1:48:48] come in and take
[1:48:49] a place in my heart that i could
[1:48:51] surrender to you lord jesus
[1:48:53] i'm now willing lord to lay it all down
[1:48:56] at your feet lord
[1:48:58] i'm just asking that your holy spirit
[1:48:59] would come lord
[1:49:01] fathers we have to go from the building
[1:49:03] and go our separate ways lord jesus
[1:49:05] may this not just be something that
[1:49:07] would pass by but
[1:49:09] may have produced a life-changing action
[1:49:12] in us
[1:49:12] to where you can come in lord into areas
[1:49:15] that you should have
[1:49:15] had the preeminence all along but may we
[1:49:18] just surrender it to you lord
[1:49:20] may we find ourselves when we wake up
[1:49:23] not reaching for our phone
[1:49:25] uh second nature to reach for our phone
[1:49:28] lord but
[1:49:28] may we reach for our bible may we get on
[1:49:32] our knees and pray
[1:49:34] lord when we have a need arise in the
[1:49:36] family may we pray
[1:49:38] lord when something comes up and we
[1:49:40] don't know how to do it all it might
[1:49:41] seem so
[1:49:42] carnal but we can always ask you lord
[1:49:45] we realize we come dependent on the
[1:49:47] things of the world and on the ways of
[1:49:48] the flesh
[1:49:50] we're not a part of this kingdom lord i
[1:49:52] believe you've opened up my eyes to
[1:49:54] realize how the enemy
[1:49:56] so easily can come in so deceitfully and
[1:49:59] and make a stronghold in our life and we
[1:50:02] don't even know it
[1:50:04] lord we're surrendering ourselves to you
[1:50:06] now and giving you the preeminence
[1:50:08] that you so rightfully deserve lord we
[1:50:11] commit the people to you now
[1:50:13] we commit the baptism to you lord if
[1:50:15] there's anyone here lord
[1:50:19] it's just unsettled in their heart lord
[1:50:21] may they know that
[1:50:23] in the name of jesus christ they can be
[1:50:25] delivered
[1:50:27] they just confess their faults and
[1:50:28] confess their sins and repent
[1:50:30] they can be baptized in the name of the
[1:50:32] lord jesus christ and receive the power
[1:50:34] of the holy ghost
[1:50:35] that will fill every fiber of their
[1:50:37] being we love you lord we thank you for
[1:50:39] this time in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:50:42] amen
[1:50:46] i have a maker
[1:50:52] here for my heart
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:18] is
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:32] me
[1:51:38] [Music]
[1:52:00] no matter where i
[1:52:03] go
[1:52:04] [Music]
[1:52:07] he knows my name
[1:52:14] he
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:28] when i called
[1:52:57] benjamin came in and he
[1:53:00] asked me to baptize him and i said well
[1:53:02] benjamin went up i
[1:53:04] don't baptize you he says well i'll go
[1:53:06] to another church to get baptized
[1:53:10] amen i thought well that's what i that's
[1:53:13] what i want to hear
[1:53:15] amen in other words i want to be
[1:53:17] baptized if you don't do it
[1:53:20] i'll go someplace else amen
[1:53:24] so we know benjamin wants to be baptized
[1:53:29] so we're going to read in the book of
[1:53:30] acts and
[1:53:33] it says now when they heard this they
[1:53:35] were pricked in their heart
[1:53:37] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[1:53:40] apostle
[1:53:42] men and brethren what shall we do
[1:53:45] then peter said unto them repent and be
[1:53:48] baptized
[1:53:49] every one of you in the name of jesus
[1:53:53] christ
[1:53:54] for the remission of your sins
[1:54:00] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:54:02] holy ghost
[1:54:04] for this promise is unto you and to your
[1:54:08] children and to all that are far off
[1:54:12] as many as our lord our god shall call
[1:54:15] and with many other words he did testify
[1:54:19] and exhort saying save yourselves from
[1:54:23] this upwards
[1:54:24] generation then they that gladly
[1:54:27] received
[1:54:28] his words were baptized the same day
[1:54:32] and they were added unto them about
[1:54:34] three
[1:54:35] 000 souls amen
[1:54:39] brother branham they asked brother
[1:54:41] branham and he said
[1:54:43] you know suffer the little children that
[1:54:45] come unto me
[1:54:47] and he said when you feel it on your hat
[1:54:50] your heart
[1:54:51] you act upon it when you
[1:54:54] when it moves upon you
[1:54:57] and so benjamin's felt moved upon to be
[1:55:01] baptized he wanted to be baptized
[1:55:04] and so he's asked to do the right thing
[1:55:08] and we never deny our children the
[1:55:10] opportunity
[1:55:12] to do the right thing and that's which
[1:55:16] is right
[1:55:16] so i'm going to baptize benjamin
[1:55:20] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:55:23] because
[1:55:24] he has asked in his heart to do it
[1:55:28] and we believe it so benjamin if you'll
[1:55:30] step over here
[1:55:32] and we're gonna pray our gracious
[1:55:35] heavenly father
[1:55:39] benjamin in his heart has to be baptized
[1:55:43] in your name
[1:55:45] he wants to take the first step
[1:55:49] into serving you and doing what's right
[1:55:53] so father we're happy to do that now
[1:55:56] so according to the scriptures to go
[1:55:59] into
[1:56:00] all the world and baptize them in the
[1:56:02] name of the father
