amen this is our last opportunity until december to have your picture taken i mean also our meetings are going to be here pretty soon and because there's probably some wondering we're going to have it or not and men are certainly planning to have our meetings it's going to be a november 12th 13th and 14th and the second weekend in november it's certainly closer and want to do all our preparation necessary preparation so we can be here amen amen you know those have always been a blessing to us amen who certainly pray that god will guide us so we'll have our friday night service there's going to be a luncheon there's reservation being made for the gym place that we rent for the youth and we're going to have a saturday night service and sunday morning and a singing service on sunday night amen amen but darian writes he has an unspoken request it says that his will be done so we certainly pray that god will give him his heart desire but a gary morris has an unspoken request he'd like to be remembered for also when i remember by the author he texted me this morning he asked that we remember him in prayer i want to continue to remember but orlando pray that god will be with him and bring him back safe amen if you have a need upon your heart this morning just leave your hand up to him amen the brothers that are taking the offerings if you could come amen but a reindeer if you could just come and take this before the lord and sing as a special amen god [Music] [Music] god bless you this powerheads heavenly father lord just once again we come humbly before your throne father humbly lord and yet boldly lord underneath the shed blood of your son the lord jesus christ lord we have many needs amongst our body lord we're a needy people father but even as we heard in the song that we had just heard and sang together father that if it wasn't for the battles and the trials lord lord you use those to reveal yourself to us and show us that you're mighty god that you are the mighty conqueror lord and that you've made us overcomers through thy blood lord and by by your word oh god we just pray right now father that all the different needs lord that are in the hearts of your people that you'd minister them in your perfect way o god lord may you just come on the scene and make yourself known to your people lord jesus lord to show yourself mighty amongst your people oh god that you're the only living god lord and we'll be sure to give you all the praise and glory and honor for all those things father lord as we get ready for the word to come forth father we just pray that you would get us all out of the way the speaker the hearer lord that there wouldn't be any hindrance lord to the movement of the holy ghost throughout the congregation this morning lord and we just ask that your perfect will will be done father we just as you bless the tithes and the offerings lord may they go for the furthering of the ministry lord and for your kingdom father we just ask that your perfect will be done today in the name of the lord jesus christ amen i just had this song on my heart it's a old one you probably know it it's just a really simple song but i just kind of had it on my heart for the last couple weeks here so we'll sing this song it's uh jesus paid it all [Music] i hear the savior sake thy strength indeed is small child of weakness watch and pray find in me thine all in all jesus paid it all [Music] to him my old for sin had left a crimson stain he washed dead white as snow lord now indeed i find thy power and dine alone [Music] jesus paid it all all to him i owe for sid [Music] [Music] before the throne i stand in him complete jesus died my soul to save my lips shall still repeat oh jesus paid it all [Music] had left a crimson stain he walked

unmeasurable [Music] we could look at how many times that we've forsaken you and been drawn away to our own desires [Music] how we've tried to run but father you seek us out you gently lose back into your presence you forgive us our sins and you comfort us and you restore us back in your way and you love us and you give us promises that you'll never leave us nor forsake us lord how could that ever be put into words [Music] how could we ever have the ability to show our appreciation to you the things you've given us and lord were many times even as ashamed approach you but yet you beckon us you say come and enter the throne of my grace and ask abundantly father there's many today that are suffering and they have loved ones that are suffering and father they call upon your name and they lay before you day and night and father we ask that you would bring to them the desires of their heart grant to them the things that they ask for we ask you to help us and be with us today in jesus precious and wonderful and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you uh we'll read our scripture and then we'll go ahead and start let's turn in our bibles to uh matthew the seventh chapter and uh we have a baptism after service uh sister and tonya i believe that i hope i pronounce that right are you here sister somewhere i don't know back there in the back all right god bless you we're anxious to see the lord bless you this morning also we've had some families that have come and we don't have a church membership and we don't have a book and the directory is not joining the church sorry it doesn't mean anything that but that we have a a a place that we can have your picture and if we see you and then we can go through the book and and say oh that's this person and maybe help us it's just for fellowship okay or maybe somebody's come on your heart and you want to pray for him and call him so it has nothing to do with basically the church or anything other than it's just a tool of fellowship for you so uh if if you don't want to put like pertinent information in there like your birth date um you feel you've had too many of them or or you don't want to put your address or phone number that's fine too but your picture helps with your name because it helps me and i've been trying to learn everybody's name i've got about six or eight of them down but i'm a slow learner but anyway uh i i'm not going to say your name's right so you forgive me but i think it's uh uh hero and magda and a chassis or jose or something close to them you have to i i'm the proof of that you have to have grace but anyway can you kind of wave your hand where you are i know you're maybe you're in the bat there's right over here they're believers in the message and they're we're happy to have them in our fellowship and they're understand english speak a little english but you know who knows every word they say hallelujah aren't you glad we could have these different singers and and sing and then also i believe it's the ventura family at claudine oscar carlos joshua and maril linder i don't know i said your name wrong but i didn't write the book of life so you're safe god wrote the book are you where are you can you you're in are you in here you're in the back okay god bless you so much your family uh i just trust the lord jesus blesses you and and we try to provide the best interpretation we can and we're certainly interested in you and your needs and so uh each of you especially our spanish-speaking people if you could get by and greet them and become friends and fellowship and then help us as we want to serve god let's read these scriptures this morning it says therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do did i give you the right verse saint matthew the seventh chapter the twelfth verse again saint matthew the gospel of matthew it's on page 1147 in my bible so matthew the 7th chapter and the 12th verse therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do even so to them for this is the law and the prophets you know man has taken that and put it in a saying do unto others right but this is what the scripture says it says it's the law and the prophets and a law is something that governs things so if everybody would follow this our world would be in tremendous harmony he says enter ye in at the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth the destruction and many there be which go in there at but straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it and also let's turn over to matthew the 22nd chapter and the 14th verse it says for many are called but few are chosen let us pray our gracious heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us this morning in jesus precious and wonderful and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated well i left my notes at home and so i tried to re-scratch them and i left them in the back so maybe i'm not going to preach with any notes so if i wander a little well that's fine i i we're trusting this morning that you love the lord and we're going to make a few comments and then we're going to listen to a little portion of the message one in a million and the thing that struck me about this message is election and uh the great uh um beauty of it and it's it's it's wonderful to be chosen or to be picked i i learned that early in life because i was always the last one picked i was not very tall i i most of my grade school days i was about five six inches shorter than i am now and i remember we would go to the community center or to the lot of what we would call the for pickup games you know or anything and in basketball i was you know the last one chosen and i always counted before i stood there because i always wanted to make sure that i wasn't the 11th person because if i was the 11th person then i knew that i would not be picked so i always looked around and and found a place and i'd get picked i wouldn't get the ball but i could run up and down and pretend that i was playing and i learned that you know it was something to be chosen we have a word that we use for it and it's called election and election is is something that you don't have control over i remember standing there and i didn't have control over anything and but when it came to baseball and football i could do pretty good at that so i always tried to be the captain so i could pick and i knew for sure that i would make the team and i didn't win many games when i was captain because i always picked from the the least people to the most you know and i always wanted to be like that i always wanted to have feelings for other people and this is the law and and the the prophets that as you would have others do unto you okay that so you'd want men to treat you to treat others and it it becomes something that it is a a wonderful thing that heals a lot of wounds in our life and a lot of heartaches in our life just the simple things of doing god's word are such a blessing to us but election as i i thought on this and i wrote down that election is a wonderful privilege yeah to be chosen it's called it's all a wonderful thing to be elected and it has its benefits there's so many benefits that go with being chosen and in in our what we're speaking of this morning the benefits of our lives and being chosen by god is to think that there's one that loved us enough and saw something in us that he chose in his life to pick us and impart to us eternal life there's a great scripture if we could read it and turn to it found in hebrews uh the third and uh verse of the uh of the second chapter of hebrews and and they it speaks this word it says it we'll just start with the first verse it says therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed now we're talking about election the benefits and the price or the cost of election therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard least at any time we should let them slip now so this is a a responsibility that goes with being elected and chosen we we don't want to feel as we speak a little bit this morning before we play 30 minutes we don't want to feel that election doesn't have a price you understand it doesn't have a participation it doesn't have something that comes with it that is uh the responsibility that comes with it can be neglected uh we too often enter into the thinking that i'm chosen i don't have to play you know i've made the team how many times have i seen someone that would maybe be on a team and many of you have been able to play sports and things and and the person gets injured or somebody can't show up or they become ill and you've been you're on the team but if you don't if you don't study the book and study the plays and are a hundred percent prepared then when you get called to duty you understand you're not there to be able to do what you have been elected or chosen to do so you haven't been chosen to the bride to be on a team you haven't been chosen to ride the bus that that's not what you've been chosen for you've been chosen to have a duty and like we said one of those duties is to do unto others as you would have them do unto you but you're not elected and you're not chosen with the idea in mind that that's the end of it it's the beginning of it when you were chosen you were chosen a sinner but then the spirit of god went moving on your life to build you into the statue of a perfect man and that is what your calling is is to to be molded and shaped into the images of christ jesus that we might be conformed into his image and so their election is not the end it's the beginning we have kind of turned that around a little bit and we felt that i've been elected it's over no you've been elected it's just begun you now become the lump of clay on the potter's wheel and and you've submitted yourself to the hand of god that he might mold you into the vessel that he had in his mind when he grabbed grab that lump of clay but many get on the wheel and they start saying this is what i want to be and this is what i want to be and this is where i want to go and this is what i want to do and our lives begin to change the pattern of god's word that's the biggest curse of denominationalism is they can't have fellowship one with another and he goes on to say here he said that we should let him slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just replicant of reward you reap what you sow right you sow to the flesh you'll reap of the flesh you sow to the spirit you'll reap of the spirit and paul's pointing to something here because he's talking to the church and he's talking to the believer and they he wants us to understand the beauty that comes with being elected he says how shall we escape if we neglect so great of salvation which act the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard them god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will for unto the angels hath he not put into subjection the world to come thereof we speak so just think of the the the the beauty of election and paul speaking to us now you can't i'm i'm gonna point to a little something so just bear with me for a moment he's saying it angels heard of it and and uh and and it was called and we've got to be careful that we don't let it slip because there's a just recompense for the reward of what that we do and i know that we want to feel that i'm chosen so i'm going to be there but even the lord teaches is watch every man how that he builds no other foundation can be laid than that which was laid by the lord jesus he says so watch what you build because if you build wood and hay and stubble orc if you build otherwise he says your works are going to be tried and they'll be tried by fire and some will enter in by the fire by which they are tried so i don't want to have all that i done be consumed because i failed to take my election serious i didn't give it the value and the understanding that it really it was due never the fact that i deserved any of it but just to think that what that we're talking about today is not an election to history and chosen to look back on the history and to look at the the books and the chronicles and the at the signs and the wonders and come to the conclusion that jesus was the son of god and he was a true figure therefore i see that and i will follow that and i will believe that that places it into my hands i can choose to read i can choose to study i can choose to derive from the word of god the things that i feel are appropriate for the lifestyle that i choose and if i search enough i'll find other people that look at things the way that i look at it that have come to the same conclusions that i have come to and i will begin to flock together and we will discuss our thinking and we will build our thoughts and we will come to our conclusions and we'll begin to share those with others and we'll begin to build and we'll have a consensus and then we'll decide of what ways that we sh we choose to worship and what songs we choose to sing and pretty soon we've built something that's man-made we've got something that's man-made and then our question would be what are we elected to are we elected to what that we have built or are we been elected and chosen to for god to mold us and make us into that which that he would choose for us to be we are his workmanship in christ jesus foreordained unto good works that we should walk in them so just to establish this morning that we are not elected to a past tense many are called many have heard the calling and they've looked back and now we've got churches on every corner and groups of men in man's teaching those are those which are called they heard the call and they responded according to their thinking in their heart in their mind i call them brothers fellow christians i i was raised a catholic catholics were always given under good works and charity they always embrace the poor they always tried to take care of their own and i know i don't believe what they teach and i don't believe the that the pope is the vicar of christ and i don't believe that the body uh the bread that they pray and it turns into the literal body or the wine but though i don't believe those things i can't acknowledge that and fail to acknowledge that they're they're given to good works and and that's what they propagate they propagate doing good and forgiving and and taking in all wonderful characteristics but we also know that satan appears as an angel of light and so the call is one thing the election is another thing the choosing is something else in other words our choice isn't given as uh just uh uh i choose you now go do what you want the the very choice itself is because the chooser has a purpose in mind if it was just a calling this morning then we could have chosen any number can i take off my code thank you here thank you billy we could have chosen any number of of the places that are on the hills we could have went anywhere and entered in to the fellowship of good works feeding the poor helping the homeless which all things are good we would have we could have had fellowship with all those things but that's not what we are chosen for we are chosen for an electric purpose a particular and peculiar people chosen and elected for a specific work a present tense he's chosen us not to know him in history but to know him in his present work he chosen us not just to choose how we will duplicate and choose to perform his teachings but he's chosen us that he himself could be the performer now as we turn to listen i want to just see if i can find this statement to read to you he said yeah i don't know why it's not in front of me but he says he says it oh we'll just listen to it but what i want to say is is that the it is man was given to believe every word of god not just not just a portion of the word of god but every word of god and so so it's given he said if what was the test talking about israel we're going to listen to this and when we read this i want you to listen to it he says what was the test they all drink in the same rock they all eat the same spiritual manna as we're eating this morning but the word test proved them when it come to the time of canis barnea when they started over into the promised land and they could not go over until they were tested by the word and so the test became the word now your test is your election that's your test it's your election and so you can't prove your election by anything else other than the election itself so so i'm elected one in a million now how can i go to the 999.000 and get any any approval or or any proof or any uh any acknowledgement because they're not chosen they're not elected so i can't look to anything other come on amen for the test or for my proof but the word itself that's the only place i have to go i can't prove to anybody that i'm chosen i'm elected i'm chosen you've heard a word sent forth by a message the church world they accepted the works they accepted the manna but the word was the test so when it came down to malachi 4 5 and luke 17 30 being the word all the word not just one word but all the word that was rejected so they can eat all the manna they could partake in all the blessings they could do all the work but to reject one word and when it came down to receiving what god was doing in the generation that they lived in they couldn't accept it because they weren't chosen to accept that but you're elected now would you neglect such a great salvation now i'm going to put what's on my heart if you were one in a million and you possess something you were the only one that knew okay so maybe you have the let's go carnal maybe you have the formula that everybody needs to be free from the common cold how much more responsibility falls on you you're the one in a million you're the one that's chosen and elected you have the words of life you have the gift of life your responsibility doesn't diminish because of your election you still feed the poor you still visit the homeless and the fatherless in their affliction you still lay hands on the sick that they recover you may be one in a million but that's what you're chosen to be is you're chosen to be a light that shines in darkness we're not chosen to come together and put our arms around one another and say i'm chosen you're chosen but i i got to accept the responsibility that i possess not a history gospel but i present a present tense by election life amen and i'm called that that life might live amen and that's individual there's so much i'd like to say but i just would like to say it this way and i want to read this so if the brothers would get ready this this message is one in a million it's three different times that he preached three different segments i i don't understand how it was all working i want to find out and brother madam says this we're not going to listen to this he says and the second morning he says now so many times we press trying to get to this that or the other i guess see it's these signs shall follow the believer i didn't say if they would pray for the sick if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover we must have faith ourselves in what we're doing we must have faith in ourselves in what we're doing what are why are we one in a million and i'm not trying to do math here that's not the point of it all right you're out you're out i'm in so you know that that's the only it's it's the expression and the understanding that you are an elected chosen person and that you've got to have confidence in that election because he's given to you something that nobody else can do but you and he said it's not praying for the sick it's laying hands on the sick so the desire in understanding our election is to understand that we've been called and chosen and if we can have faith in that that's what's going to put us into action that's what's going to make it real to us but if you don't have confidence in that you can't weigh it by works i hope i can express this but you've got to accept it by the very election itself the only thing you have to go by he said so he chose me i know he did i'm not going to neglect neglected but i hoped this morning that that can be expressed a little bit so we'll just go forward in this uh and if we're gonna pick up on paragraph 27 this is the third time that brother branham comes to the pulpit this day he's done two radio stations and now he's doing another thing there's another crowd downstairs he's upstairs speaking to i guess a smaller group of people and but this is the next message in the series that we've been going through and i believe it so just think the responsibility of election the price is the reproach the benefit is eternal life let's just listen for a moment and we're certainly extending this invitation to you to come to the embassy hotel tomorrow afternoon to be prayed for and not only that but to bring the ones that sinners and those who are backslidden if we just have a prayer for the sick and we do see god constantly doing great miracles but that secondarily the main thing is to be saved filled with god's spirit which i'm going to speak to you about just in a few moments here and the sufficiency how that we must be filled with god's spirit and divine healing usually draws an attention to people and brings them in the presence of god when god does something that they know is un well it's not understood we cannot mechanically show how it's done god does it in his own great way then that attracts the attention of the people to know that there's a presence of a power somewhere that can do something as beyond human understanding and that causes them to look to the lamb of god and always divine healing i've been told and i believe myself that about between 60 maybe and 70 percent of our lord's ministry was on divine healing and he did that to attract the people then when they were there he said accept you believe i am he you will perish in your sins now divine healing is a great drawing card to get people to look to the lord jesus and dr f f bosworth which many of you was a friend to and knew him and his start at paragraph 42 if we could just jump to 42 through 77 this is the second session and it's only about five minutes long but we'll just we want to go to paragraph 42. and start there and this is brother branham ends the second radio broadcast and now he's starting the third session well this is three times for me up here you know it was just told that we got the vacate the building in about 12-14 minutes or something and the management said is on the other floor then they can't serve any meals our meals lengthened out we have many courses you know so we're very very glad that we've had this great spiritual gastronomical jubilee you know i would call it this morning here with this fine bunch of man i'd like to to make mention that we are the services again tomorrow afternoon over at the embassy now we will be praying for the sick there and expecting god to meet with us and i've come to put in my part my ministry into making all that we can this meeting to be a success not a success because it's our meeting a success of people finding jesus christ that's the success any meetings no matter how much we praise god how many great things that we see him do how many times he speaks to us in the spirit and so forth unless there's something accomplished some souls brought into the kingdom and uh brother shakira and i we just made a real statement just now about what he thought about these days that we're we're living in i truly believe that with all my heart that we're living just at the closing time just in a just in the evening shadows the sun is far advanced and when we see things taking place the way they are today why it's hard telling what another generation would bring a few days ago just let me give you a little insight something they made an analysis throughout arizona where i live of all the schools that gave the children unknowingly to them a mental test and guess what including high schools and and grammar school there was 80 percent of the children suffering with mental deficiency seventy percent of them was television watchers the evils just slipped up on us and we don't you wonder why it comes you can hear the voice of god screaming out against it yet here we we find ourselves webbed into it let me give you a shocking something see not all this sayeth unto me lord lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father his will is his word we can be ever so religious have great time shouting jumping in these meetings which we're i don't i don't want to be critical but i have a duty to do to god and that duty is to be sincere and to say what he wants me to say [Music] and i'm i'm certainly grateful for the california chapter who's bore with me and my convictions if i don't speak my convictions i'm a hypocrite i'm not i'm not even honest with you and if i can't be honest with you how will be honest with god because i'll see you and talk to you of course we do to god too but we got to be really sincere and honest with one another we are certainly in a a horrible horrible age and did you ever stop just let me give you just a little analysis not all that saith unto me lord lord will enter therein but the one that doeth the will of my father jesus said on earth man shall not live by bread alone but by every word every word not just now and then a word but by every word it was one word misbelief by gods of god's commandments that caused death sorrow and ever sickness and heartache to miss god's word one word if he taken the human race into death by this misbelieving one word surely surely but he said it would happen satan said surely it won't but it did so we've got to keep every word of god and if the human and all this suffering and things that went on the human race by misconstruing or are misbelieving one word how we going back by missing one if it's cost all this price even the life of his son many are called fear chosen many are called few are chosen i can't take a text from this but because we haven't got time but just to leave something with you let us think of i went one day with brother chicarion you know where this high breeding cattle and i've seen the the in the laboratory where brother shakarian taken me in and they a dipped uh in the spirit of the male cow uh just a little like a little instrument of matched stem and tuck up a bunch of that spearing and put it under this glass that magnified it hundreds of times and there was little germs jumping in that and that sperm which we know the germ comes from the male and the egg from the female and i asked the chemist there i said what's that making that little jump like he said that's uh that's little bulls and calves see i said in that little drop he said yes i said perhaps then in the entire sperm there would be a million of them he said oh yeah now watch close now when this great thing takes place there's one egg waiting for one germ out of that million and there's no one can tell which germ that is or which egg that is if you watch the natural birth it's more of a mystery than the than the virgin birth because in the sperm there's one in there that's predestinated to live and the rest of them will die and it isn't the first one meat it's the first one that comes together with the egg maybe the egg may raise up from the back of the sperm in the middle of the sperm the germ may do the same they the germ crawls into the egg and little tails drop off of it and there starts the spine there's only one and that whole load of a million that's going to make it only one and that's determined by some unknown force to man that you're everyone alike every one of those germs are just a light same thing in an animal same thing in man it's determined where it's going to be boy girl red-headed black-headed or white it's determined by god all of them look the same naturally but there's one in there that's ordained to life one in a million yet all of them alike when israel left egypt there was approximately two million people left at the same time every one of them heard the message of a prophet every one of them saw the pillar of fire every one of them was baptized to moses in the red sea every one of them shouted in the spirit beat the tamarins and run up and down the bank with maryam when moses sang in the spirit they everyone drank from the same spiritual rock they everyone eat fresh manna every night every one of them but there was two made the land one out of a million what was the test they all drinking the same rock they all eat the same spiritual manners were eating this morning but the word test proved him when it come to the time of cadiz barnea when they start over into the promised land and they could not go over until they was tested by the word and all the the other 10 came back and said we can't make it the people are like we're like grasshoppers to them they're great walls cities the opposition is too great but joshua and caleb's still the people they said we're more than able to do it why god said before they left the promised land i've given you the land i'll give it to you it's yours but there were one out of each million there's approximately 500 million so-called christians in the world today and each day ends a generation and now what if the rapture would come today and 500 people universally would be taken in the rapture you never know or even see in the paper of them going and the coming of the lord is a secret coming you'll come and steal away you'll be such a minority go just like it was in the days when the disciples asked jesus why does the scribe say that that elias must first come he said he's already come and you never knew it did you ever think what the people did they went right on believing that elias was coming and he was right among them and they didn't know it so would it be in the coming of the son of man he'll do with him just the same thing the spirit of god is here well what are we going to do with it are we going to eat manna and so forth and not continually move up as we grow did you ever notice a seed as the reverend pitts was speaking a few moments ago and how seed goes into the ground many seeds are there in the ground when god moved up on the water with the light and light brought forth the first uh presence of god spoken light came by god's word and god's word is the only thing it still brings light and when the waters went back the seed is already in the earth and the light only brought forth the seeds that remain with germ in them come forth god making his creation and now on easter morning there was another light struck the earth when the holy spirit was given and it's given to bring life to those seeds that god by his foreknowledge knew that would be here on the earth as he knew the first natural seed he knows where the spiritual season your body was laying here right down on the earth when god first brought the earth into existence we are part of the earth we were laying there and by his fore knowledge he knew exactly who would love him and who would serve him and who would not his foreknowledge tells that if it doesn't then he isn't god he can't be god without being infinite and if he's infinite he knows all things so you see people making their blunders they stumble at it they run at it they think this and that but it doesn't work right we see it but there is a working right that's to find god's perfect will and standing in what god calls you for as brother jack said a few moments ago about down here at the the persian square all the confusion one this away in one that way and about the theologians and so forth that you want to know some theology go down there i guess that's just about like it is in the hyde park in london i was down there everybody has his own idea it's a it's a conglomeration of of a modern-day world in babylon but did you notice as as brother pitts went on with his lovely message this morning to us as he began to walk out of the park there he found a little easter lily in the midst of all the confusion as he brought it to us that had no way to say yes or no it was a life of god shining in it in the midst of all the confusion it was there in its radiance because god had ordained it to be there in the midst of all the conflict no one was noticing it they didn't see the spiritual application of it and so easily today amongst all of our great gatherings and groups and churches and denominations and so forth one pulling this away we must be baptized be presbyterian we must be this side of the other in the midst of all of it there is a growing flower there is a power of god right among us being raised right up in the midst of all of us let's just stop and behold it a few minutes and watch it this week and see it unfold right before us we believe god will do it don't you i see it we ought to be downstairs but now so let's pray each one of us dear god when we bow our heads in thy presence we are feel that we are so insufficient to ask but you promised us that if we would come you would not turn us down and these rude statements that's just been made by no means to be a doctrine one out of a million but just to kindly remember or you said straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there will be that'll find it or many are called but few are chosen o eternal father send the gospel light across this city through this coming week of convention and if there be any seed somehow by your own great wise province like trying to illustrate it in the spurn of the male and female may they roll into the convention may the holy spirit give them life we realize that the time is perhaps later than we think it is we pray god that as we come here just believing that maybe there is something here that could be done that would help the people or or catch that last sheep we know when the sheep fold is full then the shepherd will close the door as it was like in the days of noah when the last member of the family was brought in god closed the door and they beat and pounded but it was too late dear god they had the opportunity you said i am that door to the sheepfold and how striking the song from the poet are not ninety and nine enough for thee but no there was one more he might be a little black sheep or he might be a little nobody might be the little her he we don't know where they are but that last one must come in and then the door will be closed oh god who knows all things search our lives this morning and send us wherever that we could go that we might find that last one that the door will be closed and the shepherd inside with the sheep granted lord if there be that one here today if that one that's supposed to come in all the father has given me will come to me and no man can come except my father has drawed him and if there be a tug or a little feeling that this might be the hour for somebody here in this audience here are downstairs or wherever they may be may they answer yes lord i am that little wandering one that's wandered away it's fallen off all my life i i felt that i should come but today i'm hanging on the side of the feet i can't go up or down i can go no way oh may the great shepherd come reach down with him their hands and bring that one safely in place it up on his shoulders and bring it safely back maybe there is one here laura that's sick in a similar condition that the doctor said there's nothing can be done he tried hard to rescue it but he could not rescue it it's beyond his reach there's there's nothing that he can do his medicine or his knife cannot get to it oh lord there's nothing too far for your great arm and your word is your arm so we pray dear god that this morning while we are talking to thee that thou will reach down and pick that one up that's sick it cannot help itself out of the reach of all scientific uh matters away from the doctor may they be healed granted lord as we think of david as he was given a charge over a few sheep just a few but one day a bear come in and got that one little sheep and tuck it out and would have eaten up like a cancer would eat up a body our huge line but david not too well equipped with a a rifler and not a swordsman but with only a slingshot he went after that sheep and when he found the animal that was about to kill the little sheep he slewt with the slingshot just a simple little weapon with a piece of leather and a string and but he had confidence in it we have no great genius among us lord we're simple people with a simple little prayer but we're coming this morning after father's sheep that woman that has walked the streets miserably smoking cigarettes trying to find peace through this cigarette that man who has smelt the glass and tried to set it back but the enemy holds him tight that boy or girl that's tried to do right i just can't find strength to break away from the wrong thing we come in the name of the lord jesus to claim that sheep this morning we defy the enemy because it's a simple thing a slingshot of prayer but we're coming to bring that one back to the father's home that we might give an account of those things that's been committed to our hands may the power of god now strike faith down in the hearts of the people and may that lost soul return this morning may the temptations of this life turn him away let him go may he find himself safely upon the master's shoulders being carried back to safety again we asked it in jesus name amen now just from that this morning i hope that you were able to listen and understand that all that he's talking about the responsibility those souls that's us that's what we're taking up that's what our calling is that's what our election is that we understand it rejoice in it and we're blessed in it and don't don't count for slack what god's done for us and the duty that lies ahead of us so we'll just stop there this morning i i probably most of you know me well for some reason i'm not feeling very well this morning i don't know what happened i just got here at church and i gotta just lost a lot of strength but i know it's somewhere like the hairs on my head you know what i mean and i hadn't lost it i just wasn't able to find it but the fact that you're chosen is so beautiful don't don't think it and the world don't even comprehend what you are but you shine your light amongst men so i believe at this time that our sister uh is going to be baptized and uh brother joseph uh gordon and brother uh cosmine are gonna baptize her this morning so if you would go get ready and it cost me if you could get a sister to help the sister be baptized we're grateful for that and some of you may have to go you might have dinner to prepare or something so we'll stand together at this time and you're if you if you do have to go don't don't feel bad we understand that so if you'd like to just slip out at this time and and then we'll say a word of prayer and then those of you that want to stay for the baptism that would be wonderful so if you have a need on your heart this morning and you'd like to lift it to the lord he said the word is the arm of god and the exceedingly great and precious promises are how that we know him and we partake in his divine nature one of the benefits of election is the promises the price we pay is the reproach and rejection of the world one of the blessings of election is a blessed assurance that all things work for the good and that heaven and earth may pass away and will pass away but his promise will never the price we pay is we don't succeed in the world as others succeed the price we pay is that he's come to the poor of this world but they're rich in faith the price we pay is we don't have fellowship with the world or the thinks of the world we're oddballs they view us as self-righteous and stuck up and know it all we don't know at all but we know the one that does know it all and we believe what he says is true i'd gladly bear the reproach of my election for it hasn't even entered into the hearts of men the things that god has prepared for them that love them we look through a glass darkling that's part of the reproach but one day we'll come face to face father our sister has heard the gospel today they've gone out to the different places and she's heard that baptism is in the name of the lord jesus christ and that word father pricked your heart [Music] she knows you're real and she's come to be baptized that she can partake in the things of life you said the holy spirit was sent to find that seed and bring it to life father i pray this morning in her baptism that all that you would have for her begins to unfold in her life father may she know her sins are forgiven [Music] and lord if she's wanting to leave one life may you give her a life to replace it i just ask that you be mighty in her life father those that have come out to the house of the lord today father we just listened to what might not be considered a great sermon maybe this morning but that's not what we put our confidence in lord i put my confidence this morning that you deal with each heart and i trust father that you go way beyond this vessel of flesh and that something that was said this morning will have an eternal effect bless those that have to go father prepare meals do whatever that they have to do may you go with them father and may your word be their portion father i ask these things as a pastor father for his sheep and i know that's an office that you created that we could be intercessors and father so i pray that though the sermon this morning was maybe not of great enticing words but may the life and benefit and intercession for the people may it be a portion that they realize in their heart i ask you to bless us now in jesus precious name we pray amen as brother billy sings i don't feel bad if you have to go but if you can stay we certainly love the fellowship god bless you are dismissed if you need to go [Music] me oh [Music] i'll come running [Music] after me [Music] oh [Music] i'll come [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] i am [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] my hope is [Music] when fears [Music] my comforter [Music] all fullness [Music] oh [Music] the wrath of god for every single [Music] his body [Music] is is [Music] [Music] this is [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] till they return [Music] [Applause] amen that's sister antonio you know her testimony is very beautiful because you know she heard the voice and uh we met sister antonia about two months ago at the at the camp called ronda in downtown dallas and uh that was the first time we have met her she had uh met brother randall and and that's kind of how we got into introduced and the next few times we were out there you know we kind of felt the pull on our heart to just play this message to the people there and it was the message called thirst so we brought a little speaker box and just put it out in a little circle area there and just played the message and you know the next few saturdays we went by and finished the service and she really had a thirst and uh some hard times have come they had to move from that camp because somebody had bought that property so then they went and and found another place where um they're staying at now and again this is another testimony but brother joseph had miraculously found him i believe he was with brother joe on that one saturday and so two saturdays ago we were just kind of out there fellowshipping around the word and uh you know we were wanting to let him know that you know we can't just call ourselves christians unless we stay in the word and we were talking about the word and you know baptism come up and whenever she heard baptism she said i want to do that i want to do want i want to change my life i want this old antonia to go down in the grave and i want this new life and uh we explained to her about baptism she's heard the prophet and uh she wants to commit herself to the lord and what a beautiful message that brother david preached this morning one in a million yes and we know that because she heard that voice today she wants to die and resurrect in the name of the lord jesus christ do you want to say anything sister antonia yes i'm going to die in a couple of seconds and i'm coming back the all me is dying and the new me is coming back so i'm a i just a person but when i come back i'm going to be in a family [Music] because every one of us right here right now we are a family so i want to become a heart with that family amen so and i'm going back yes i'm a just a person but i'm coming your sister amen all right [Applause] so we're going to read out of acts 2 38 verses 37 to 41. and it says and when they have heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brother and what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remissions of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words that he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this unworth generation then they that were gladly received his word were baptized and the same day were added unto them about 3 000 sister antonio yes you've heard the call yes and now the bible says to go preach the gospel unto all the world and baptize them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost and peter with the divine revelation the rock comes and says that the name is the name of the lord jesus christ the name above all names yes so this morning we just want to baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ and then the lord will give you this gift it's a free gift and this gift is the holy ghost so this morning we just baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen let's all stand and sing victory's mind this morning [Music] is is oh [Music] victory oh [Applause] oh [Applause] is me is [Music] is and is is [Music] oh me [Music] is [Music] you
