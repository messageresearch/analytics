brother David [Music] may you strengthen him and just show him your favor in all things that he may always be a blessing for your people bless all the ones that work with him bless this church oh Lord [Music] as we see the pastor always leading every day to the word for either let it be anchored in our hearts as we commit ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen as you're still standing ah let's take our Bibles the relief the look in a Book of Luke said chapter 7 17. it was a long form of diversity eventually we'll start from verse 28 about the University of entries we'll start from the 28th verse and then we'll go all the way to Luke 18. uh liability but the Bible says I'm glad to even treat uh defeat versus okay likewise starting from Luke 17 and 28 it says likewise also as it was in the days of Lord they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built but the same day that lot went into went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even that shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed it says in that day he uh he which was upon the house top and his staff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him let him likewise not return back remember Lord's wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it I tell you in that night there shall be two two men in one bed and one shall be taken and another shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field one shall be taken and the other left and they answered and said unto him where Lord and where it says where Lord and he said unto them whatsoever whatsoever the body theater will be the ego be gathered together and then we'll read 1850 seven and eight and shall not shall not God avenge his elect which cry day and night unto him though he belong with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth Lord bless again your word to us may you open it up for us Lord we know that the letter killeth but it's a spirit that giveth life may you let the spirit of your word let it come and and bring us to life Quicken Us in the few words that we're going to read in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats I believe we're all happy to be gathered in the house of God tonight from the scripture we just read they said the Lord I placed on my heart to speak on a little subject [Music] which is the last part of the eighth verse that we read of Luke 18 God refused to love you when the son of man will come shall he find faith on Earth we know when we want to talk about faith there's a lot of things to say um because faith is the very foundation for the Christian walk [Music] the Bible says without faith we cannot please God foreign talking about faith we could talk about faith for months and months and in many different ways and it's by faith that we are gathered here tonight it's by faith that we all know that we are Sons and Daughters of God it's by faith that we believe that God loves us that God is able to give us everything that we ask of him amen and sometimes even above what we can ask you because he told us to seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness and all the others will be given unto you remember and he didn't say that as seek first the kingdom of God then ask other things which means whether we ask or not if we have seeked the kingdom of God Phil every time that God finds that we have a need he will give it to us I was really blessed lately foreign for me I had a desire to be sitting back there and continue to listen I felt fit for me to be up here tonight when the son of man comes shall we find faith on Earth when we talk about the son of man the Republic tells us that when Jesus came with three sons names and Son of David he presented himself so many times as the son of man because the son of man for Jesus says it's a prophet as they killed because he himself calls uh Ezekiel son of man so when Jesus came on Earth he was the son of man because Jesus was the the fullness of the godhead yeah and when brother talks about the signs of the son of man he starts from the time of Abraham he says it was when God himself created a body he got into that body he created two other bodies she took two angels with him they went to visit Abraham it's a sense that the country providers and the sign was when he had his back turned towards the tent where Sarah was is and to know what was happening with Sarah when when she was in the tent a gentleman and God himself continues when he came in the body of Jesus we know that Jesus was the fullness of the godhead he poured into Christ it could kiss it and everything that Christ was he poured into his church into his bride okay and when Jesus came on Earth he himself manifested the sign of the son of man because he was when he's when he was in front of Nathaniel to say that behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile he could have seen Simon and he said Simon son of Jonah when he was in front of the Samaritan woman he could look at her and say how many husbands she had a a Jew for this line every time that God did this the objective the the goal the motive was to raise up the faith to those that were in front of him that you will certainly have a son with your wife Sarah above Nevada in his own heart they said yes [Music] who's this who's coming to bother me you have a son is there anything impossible to God is there anything that's impossible to God and to assure Abraham he said why your wife Sarah who's behind me why did she laugh Abraham understood that the one who was standing in front of him was more than a man that the promise will come to pass it because the one who was in front of him was able to discern his thinking the same God who did it with Abraham he did it with the Jews because we see he did it with Nathaniel he did it with Simon son of Jonah he did with a woman at the well and we know the story of the Samaritan woman the woman this woman who couldn't stay with others because she was a woman who didn't have a right a good life and certainly she was always waiting for everybody to go before she can go to the Wells who was able to tell her everything that happened in her life he said I see you are a prophet it is and we know the Messiah will come and when the Messiah will come he will do the same thing Jesus said I am just the contact of this woman with Jesus from procedure he changed this prostitute woman an evangelist woman because she went back into the city she couldn't say that I'm a prostitute I can't say whatever um she forgot that she was a prostitute that she had no right to testify of God to anybody but she was in contact with something that was able to transform her life is that Transformers that transformation of her life she made her a witness she went back into the city the Bible says that many came to Jesus according to them because of a testimony of a prostitute when you know you and I the that for Jesus and the dead people she was no longer a prostitute for Jesus supposed to she was never a prostitute because the Bible says two circular place that all that he has called he has Justified he said it means it forgiveness he has forgotten the past because she came in contact with the son of man to do the same thing with the Gentiles with the Nations that we are and he promised at the end time he said what happened in the time of Lord [Music] will be likewise in the son of man revealing in a revealing of the son of man and we see today when we look at the world and the way it is if you look at it in the corner to look just on the Lord the whole context of War at the time of lot was is in front of us we see all the sin that existed in the time of Noah where the Bible says you the son of man they saw that the daughters of men were attractive and they took them as wives today women are exposed as merchandise a former Express University and they they expressly dress in a manner that's that that that that that's just exposed them and all of that to push yourself is to cause the son of mans to fall the son of Gods to fall what happened in the time of Lord we see that man went into homosexuality it's what we see today we're trying even to impose other nations to accept those things it becomes almost like a world a world uh a world order it seems like it's something normal that has to be legalized when Obama went into African countries and it was uh championing the homosexual things continues when he was president that President told them if you like me to bring those things up you will first have to accept that you become my wife and he took two homosexuals and he put them in jail I said I'll get you out the day that you will produce a son for me because for God loves the man gets married to a woman because they have to produce something but today so contests [Music] but what happened in the time of lot is what we see it means if in the natural you see those things come to pass or turned a lot in the time of life it was the time where God was revealing himself to Abraham so there was a people who was set aside here the Predator they were predestinated to receive God himself it was the group of Abrahams that's why when God is extended his grace to you to hear the message God loves you regardless of your weaknesses regardless of what what challenges you have persevere the Bible says is rich in Mercy if God tells us humans donations we have to we have to forgive 70 times 70. don't remember how much more himself we have no reason to leave this message to go away from this message regardless of what's happening to us because that was the the question or the the inquiry of Jesus Jesus looked at our time he says the son of man will come but when he will come shall he find faith on Earth well people believe his message well people hang on to his message amen because we know that the purpose of this message there's only one purpose is to get us ready to go meet to go meet our Lord to go in the rapture to go to meet the Lord that's why when we want to talk about faith does the contests in the context of faith in conjunction with the son of man it goes above the faith that we have that we have for the need of healing because Faith the faith to have the Divine Healing someone who's impure who's not pure can receive a faithful healing and God did it with the Jews he did it with the Samaritans he promised to do it with us also and we know that God brought it to pass in the ministry of William Branham and say what was happening with someone made a difference but the difference is in the time of Abraham God created a body he got into it but in the time in the time of Jesus God created a body in the womb of Mary and he used that body that was his own body but in our time God took one of us so he can Manifest this ministry of the son of man if the first body would ever happen it was Elohim himself if the second body with Jesus said that remember God himself in the human body but in our time Leisure system some looked at it differently the others went and trying to figure it out to say that William Branham also said you is God says they asked a question about around them uh in question and answer number two uh it's preached on uh August 23rd 1964. uh paragraph 291. the question is paragraph 291 two zero one two two zero one yeah now well that's a good question very good I'm not the son of man um that's quite a difference Jesus Christ was as was the son of man the future the Son of God the son of man the son of David Allo I don't want to be I don't want to call myself anything but your brother I am your brother a consideration and you just regard me as brother billfully or whatever you want to do exactly or not that's that's fine the trivia that's Dandy what you believe keep it to yourself you see paragraph 105. was I the son of man is and here it is I believe that the son of man was or was the pillar of fire the son of man no no foreign could not bear sin is not this is Anointed ones at the end times it says I am not a son of man it is I am just a person who's standing there when the son of man is manifesting himself to manifest the sign of the son of man am says in the super sign it is paragraph 177. I've come among you as your brother that's all I ask you to do then in this time [Music] God sent the prophet to manifested to manifest the sign of the son of man and we know this message is to get us ready for the rapture Abraham when we go back to Abraham when he manifested the sign the sign of the son of man to Abraham transformation the Bible says he changed Abraham and Sarah Sarah who was an older woman she was made a beautiful young girl capable of seducing a king so she could be taken as a wife but quality definition because she became young again God changed her God changed Sarah trumpet in the Feast of trumpets the last sign that Abraham ever sinned before the promised sign before the promise uh sign came what was it formed the network God in the form of a human being that could discern the thoughts of a man of a people in the answer of one man not a dozen hustle of one man no matter how many impersonations they had one is and he discerned the thoughts that was in there now it says what and then next thing happened Abraham and Sarah turned back to a young young man and woman it is paragraph 296. observation watch Sarah was an old woman Villa people the Bible says her womb was Abraham's life was dead in him his seed is that right now remember Abraham Abraham his seed was dead 40 years later Eli is 35th he had seven sons by another woman what did he do he changed the bodies notice what happened immediately she turned back to a lovely young woman showing in there portraying what he was going to do with to the Royal Seed of Abraham to receive the son that's been promised she turned back to a young look they went down she's fair and beautiful it is going to marry her is that right the old grandma is and and then all other pretty girls down there Mimi [Music] what happened the trumpet of God shall sound for it shall shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first a new body and which we which are alive remain shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye hallelujah hallelujah and shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air the second is the secret has been made known the seals are open God had to manifest the son of man in our time but that's the god of prophet because these bodies cannot go in the Rapture so for us to go in the Rapture God has to do like he did with Abraham in the time of Abraham that he may change this bodies with the Dead if we don't believe this message if we don't believe what the son of man has brought in this time we will never receive the change of body faith on Earth so we have to believe the message we have to abide in the word we have to accept the word that it's the spoken word to choose that was in the beginning that that spoke the word everything in existence it's the same spoken word that has the ability to change our bodies body new day so we have to have a a faith that's needful is that's why I was saying it doesn't stop till the faithful healing alone natural natural life but our faith has to be raised up Jesus until we get the rapturing faith the faith that will do so that our body can be changed in a question and answer on the Holy Ghost Jesus said to this mountain and you've heard talk about the things that have taken place that's the ministry that we are entering into news we are way up the road now soon coming of the Lord the Lord Jesus and we've got to have rapturing faith in the church that could be changed in any moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go Vietnam when a son of man will come shall he find faith on Earth if we don't have this Faith we're not going to go he says but don't worry he'll be there he'll be there and when the power of this church Rises it will bring its Brothers the power of this church Rises will bring its Brothers the power of this church will bring the other brethrens then there will be a general resurrection and we are looking forward to it to do it we are looking forward to it we have to receive the word it means the same God in the beginning who spoke the words who manifested his attributes he's able if we come back to his word we don't need other things the word of God just the word of God and this word will interpret itself the interpretation was there was light and if God said okay that in the evening time there will be the manifestation of the son of man okay sister Minister and it's this ministry that will get you ready the bride for the Rapture and it's this ministry that will bring us to the necessary phrase for the transformation of our bodies don't worry about it just believe that the word the message whatever else God himself will take care of yourself whatever remaining is that's God's problems it's not you a nice problem it's not your problem my sister whatever God is and when God is asking you is to believe is to believe how is he going to do it I don't know but he told me if I believe the messages that he will give me this Faith he will give me the opportunity to have my body changed so that I can go in a Rapture to meet him because he promised he gave him a Minister's complain a complete Ministry to to bring us all that was necessary to have worked do you have this rapturing Faith that's why as Brother David was saying the last time listen to the message listen to the tapes read the the the message come to church you hear what the pastor is preaching God is raising up your faith the Bible says the faith comes from the hearing it is and what we hear from the word of God don't don't go away from this presence there's not a strong part in the weak part everything that God gave us through the ministry of William Branham and this is important for the Perfection of our body do everything oh you know everything you preached before 63. before that was the seals that was really not the message from when brother Branham started preaching July played the piece of the songs God called them since his birth there was the pillar of fire you know he told us the pillow fire logos it was the logos and it's the anointing from his birth says that pillow fire was there everything is said from the beginning with the revealing of the seals it's to give us the faith says I sure is this the the is this the sign of the end foreign 417. [Music] it says I don't know I don't know I'm only honest with you as my as my brothers I don't know is this is this the time limited the Mysteries are all finished has the sounding as a sounding all over is that really them seven Thunders fixing fixing to utter out something that the little group that is gathered together will receive a rapturing faith affected to go in the Rapture when he comes for will be changed as quick as those angels came in a moment in a twinkling of an eyes and shall be caught up together with those that are that had slept but I sleep to come to meet the Lord in the air he said he says again in the first seal paragraph 75 is coming fourth seven seven mystery standards that's not even written at all that's right is your Quack and I believe that through those those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in the order in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith on effect because what we've got right now wouldn't be able to do it says something new we've got to step further said we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing Divine Healing hardly we got to have enough Faith to be changed and in a moment and in the twink in the in a sweeped out of the earth and we'll find that we'll we'll find out after a while the Lord willing find out where it's written so when Jesus was talking about it when the son of man will come will they find faith on Earth says that the Lord that the Lord Jesus will come three times the first time he came to save us to die as a savior foreign and foreign so they can Reign on Earth they don't like Jesus and then Jesus was here uh questioning or asking questions about the second coming but if they were very important because he was coming to take away a bride and he's saying before I can come to take away the bride that he will send forth a son of man Ministry so they could get the bride ready but when the son of man will come will he find faith on Earth foreign faith we've seen it before it's not our our efforts God told us is to believe you're told to believe this message to believe the word it's up to him before just a moment before I come I was talking about ability we're talking in reality the word is simple if we just take the word we have everything that the word says all the benefit that God has promised in this world and if when when it comes to where we go away from the world the only thing that's needed is to come back to the word and you will always grip to get the same benefit of the word because God has promised says I'm going to go towards the end the spiritual food in due season paragraph paragraph four he says and I want you to to get built up now foreign the faith of this hour so you see it's not the same Faith that's the denomination half the faith of this hour the faith is it's going to take more faith than it ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken up and and so we want you to believe they want us to believe that we believe tonight and in all that you have seen and heard I'm going to repeat so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard we want you to have faith in all things that you have seen and heard the word that you have heard preached is the signs and the Wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all of that together in your heart and considerate whether if that be God or not God wants us to believe magazine that we accumulate all of this together in our heart s and it says that we may uh whether that we may uh you know see if it's God or not but we know it's God we know that it's God who spoke to us in the same time we know that it's God who brought us the revelation of his word you know when Jesus was on Earth one day he asked a question to his disciples what do they say about the the that I am tell prophet he said well some says you are such Prophet that you are Elijah that you are this that's the circulation that was that was what people were saying I remember there was years years ago there was a Jehovah Witness who gave me one of those little pamphlets the title of it was who do you say Jesus was I sat down with them I said that's a good question I said one day Jesus asked the same question to his disciples he started off by saying what do others say what do they say about the son of man you don't say come true so it's like you asking me a question what do you think that Jesus is I'll give you my answer but I will do like Jesus did and you to amen you yourself what do you think of Jesus now there was a silence it was Peter who stood up he said you are Christopher Jesus the son of the Living God and and Jesus was telling you are Simon you are Peter it is and it's on this the stone that I will build my church and it's on this Revelation that that who Jesus is that the church is built upon it is even the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it on the church that's built upon the revelation of Jesus of Jesus the one who knows who Jesus is that Jesus in the same time where has come to visit us he sent us a message he confirmed the message he Vindicated the message himself that if we have faith in the message certainly one of these days our bodies will be changed that the Rapture will not take place [Music] because we have not recognized our position yet to receive this message and to believe this message with all our heart to have that faith for the Rapture that the Lord may come and find us the musician can come says in the Super Signs paragraph 160 167. we find out in the Bible that the last sign before the promised Sun arrived it was a super sign Jesus said as it was then before the promised Sun arrives again that super sign will come on Earth again I declare to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ it's on earth now not only that but if the truth is but it's it's right here among us tonight the resurrected Jesus Christ it cannot fail eternally it's an eternal sign it can never be changed Heaven and Earth will pass away but that will never change certain Eternal Perpetual it's an eternal sign Everlasting sign manifested God manifested in the human flesh Joseph God made himself known in human flesh do you believe that to be the truth with all your heart do you believe it is don't shut yourself up like a turtle in a shower if there is any turtle in you take the shell out listen let the Holy Ghost come in [Music] I believe that God has done as much as he's going to do is the action of the church or either we're going to be lost God gave us all his secrets God has given us has given us all this Plan of Salvation privilege we are privileged people like we heard we were in in this evil age that the God of this evil age is the devil but God has shown his grace to us because it's an evil age but for a group it's the most glorious age come to Judas when the God of this evil age is is acting on a group of people [Music] we want the God of this glorious age that he may work on us that he may pull us close to his word but he may increase the love for his word in our hearts that he may pull us to him because certainly [Music] If We Hold Fast if we keep this message as true as he changed Abraham and Sir everything as real as he changed the prostitute woman [Music] it's real it's this message has the power to change us [Music] may the Lord bless you know let's bar ahead [Music] Lord Jesus Christ [Music] we love you we want to tell you that we love you certainly that we have not expressed it this much but we want to love you even more [Music] when we see the things that's happening in the world [Music] we will also in the world but you extended your grace even when we didn't deserve that Grace you loved us what we are and love when we're unlovable you attracted us to this word foreign [Music] [Music] place for us we want to hide ourselves in here we want to give ourselves to you [Music] we want to give our being to you [Music] that you may do with us whatever you will we give ourselves to you Lord [Music] I give my brother I give you my sister oh Lord how we want to Rejoice that day when you will come how we would love to see one another on the other side and to Rejoice at the end where we will never have to to separate from one another we will always be in your presence oh we'll cry oh God because of that father that you may imprint this message in our
