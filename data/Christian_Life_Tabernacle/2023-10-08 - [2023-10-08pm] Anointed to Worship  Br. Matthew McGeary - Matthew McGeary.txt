that are under siege that time of horror and distress for them yes God said he save a Remnant and he blinded them the original children of God that he might allow the gentile people to come in that's right but they have to receive their Messiah and brother brand taught us if you know if you want to know what time it is look at God's time piece that's Israel amen there's an unsettling there's war real war going on we don't know what the future holds for us we know that that six seal pouring out that tribulation time said the bride would be gone as our brother mentioned this morning many prophecies can happen in a rapid succession we need to prepare our hearts but let's remember them in prayer this day and this night our gracious and kind Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once again

you come and dwell in these temples made with hands what a type oh Lord Jesus Lord heard your Prophet say then truly we are deity lord it's hard to accept and realize but Lord we've been set aside

that are spoken here there's thankfulness Lord in answered prayer but Lord there's many needs yes Lord we sometimes get confused Lord and Lord we fight Satan when we've been taught to just to declare the word and just leave him alone brother Ram said you keep kicking that serpent or that snake he will bite you but Lord we just condemn him put him under our feet and walk on in the service of the

our bodies Lord certainly we might not know if it would be tomorrow morning or several years but we want to have a love affair with you Lord that we live like it's coming right now because you are here Lord your word has been opened up the seals have been opened and we're in a union with you Lord so we may we just lay aside every weight and everything that would so easily be said us Lord may we run the race with patience Lord just giving you everything that you deserve surrendering our life to you Lord as we just want to surrender ourselves that you could come Lord just take the vessel and the word and break the bread of life to your sheep we ask it in your name the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen praise the Lord if you have your bibles if you'll turn in Deuteronomy chapter 16 if if we haven't already mentioned it we bring you greetings from Brother um Dany and the Saints there in uh Florida we had some uh wonderful services with them and just such a great group of people I think if you're ever out uh that way you should you should uh even if you have to go a little out of your way you ought to go be in fellowship with them because I really felt at home and it's it's just good to come in contact with brothers and sisters of precious like Faith where you just feel so welcomed and we just had a good time amen just reading out of Deuteronomy 16 and verse 2 it says Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flock and the herd in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there we just ask a blessing upon the reading of his word you may be seated also if you'll just turn in your Bibles to John chapter 4 and verse 19 this would be out of any story in the Bible uh brother Brandon would use this story I would I don't think it's even a question more than any other um story in the Bible and so and I could say it can never be used um too much that's right I can never hear it too much I can't read it too much uh every time I'm identified in it every time it it breaks me up every time I see myself it's just such a perfect h h a picture so let's just read that out of John 4 uh 19 it would uh read like this and the woman said unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship and Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father you worship ye know not what now think of that that sounds kind of offensive you don't know what you worship think of it you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipper the true worshipper I like that I want to be a true worshipper when the true worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such let me catch my for the spirit and Truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman said unto him I know that when Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us these things and Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and Marvel that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest with her think of that here they come they're wonder what in the world is he doing talking to this Samaritan and the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and saith to the men come see a man which told me all the things that I ever did is this the Christ and I just think what's so beautiful about the picture here she is in that condition and now she's standing face to face with the word made flesh and as it discerns the thoughts and intense of her heart here here the word telling her look you don't even know what you worship but the hour is coming and now is where the true worshipper shall Worship in spirit and in truth and as the word was going forth under her and as as her heart was being discerned I just I I just imagine the pictures completely changing here here he's telling her you don't know what you worship but now as as he starts to discern the thoughts and intents of her heart and she's w Wait a second is this not the Christ and he says I am e now she knows what to worship now she's running back into the city here she's been shot by the city she came and says unto the man of the city look no doubt there could have been people in that presence that despised her and maybe one she had relationship with but she's coming back regardless of her past regardless of situations because now she's come face to face with the Messiah and now she knows where the word is at it's in Christ it's in the Messiah is this not him is this not the Messiah for the father seeketh such to worship those that worship Him in spirit and in truth and just reading out of perfect Faith the prophet would say the Bible said in Acts 2 that Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God Anointed with the Holy Ghost went about and done great works and things see that God manifest and proved that he was in this man and now we become Anointed with that same spirit anointed Messiahs Messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he is not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself there becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same God in the same word is making the same manifestations there's nothing left for us to do but believe it and believe that it is substance and that creates a perfect faith I love how the prophet just boils that down and makes it so simply he says there's nothing left to do but just believe it and that creates a perfect Faith we're we're we're trying to manufacture and and try to come up with a perfect Faith he's just telling you to believe the word that's going forth and as you receive the word you become the word just believe it and as you believe it that creates the perfect Faith you want to go in a Rapture you want to go in a body change believe the word believe the message faith comes by hearing the word you want a body change you want to be pleasing to the Lord just believe it there's nothing left for you to do but believe it because as you receive the word as you believe the word you become the word you are the word you're the word being made manifest you're expressing the word the same finds the same wonders we don't have to look back 60 years 70 years to know that God is among us we're a house full of Miracles we're not a dead church this CH church is alive with the same manifestations we we have Divine Miracles represented amongst us we don't have to look to the Flesh and into a a sick body to wonder if the Supernatural is amongst us we thank God for Divine Healing we thank God for healing in our bodies we thank God that he said by my stripes you are healed and we know that we are healed we accept that we believe that but I say oh we our body can be healed and it will become sick again but but what about the soul oh could there be a greater Miracle than one that was lost in sin and didn't know his way and didn't know what to worship and then God came and called you he came and changed you he came saved you oh you became born again and filled with the Holy Ghost and now the same life that was in Jesus Christ is now living in you declaring he is not dead but he is alive oh that's a miracle and we just want to maybe speak to you if God will help us along the lines of anointed to worship all right anointed to worship you're I want to say you're being Anointed with something I mean you you just you look at this world and and and the and the pressures and everything that's pressing in you're you're going to be Uh something's going to rub off on you you're going to be anointed by something we know there's only two Powers there's the power of God and the power of Satan and it's just whichever one you want to connect yourself to you know I I I I like how a brother brandom said one time he he said you know Satan voted against me God voted for me now who are you who are you going cast your vote to I he said I voted for Jesus a long time ago you know you you you don't realize it but many times we vote with our time and our decisions and the way we conduct ourselves yes thank God we're predestinated and our name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life but but as Sons and Daughters you know those I love I rebuke and I chase and we have to go through a learning process we got to be child trained we got to be spanked we got to be talked and uh taught and you you don't realize a lot of the decisions and the things that we spend our time doing you're linking up with the wrong anointing you wonder why you find yourself in a peculiar situation and you give into a besetting sin or something like that is because maybe you're not walking in the spirit you're not you're not using the discernment and you're not connected to the word you're not walking in that spirit and in truth anointed to worship giving God praise and giving him glory uhhh following after John 5:19 I do nothing but the father shows me to do we find ourselves walking down Pathways and deviating here or there and then we find ourselves giving our time and attention to thing and what are we worshiping right Paul taught us whatever you yield your members to that's what you become subject to that's what that's what you're surrendering yourself to you know Paul would speak about in in in in the scriptures he would say Redeeming the time because the times are evil that redeeming that that word is a powerful word it it it's speaks of a purchasing power that by your time you're you're actually purchasing and making that time yours but Satan's wanting to to to trick you and confuse you and he's wanting to give you substitutes and he's he's wanting to distract you and offer you things that you would make these decisions and actually give your time and attention to the things of the world but we got to redeem the time we want to link up to the supernatural I want to be I want to be anointed to worship him in spirit and in truth look look at the religious world yeah they're all anointed to worship and they can do a pretty fine job of it they can create an atmosphere you know they can they can get a moving and a stirring but if there's no word what's the benefit and maybe you know uh brother Brandon if you you do a study out on on true worship he would even speak of yeah yeah they they it's true worship they're they're sincere it's true worship but but if they're not a predestinated seed and if it's void of the word then really what are they worshiping because we know Satan appears as an angel of Light so we need to be careful you're going to be Anointed with something I I want to be Anointed with the Holy Ghost I want to I want to be anointed to worship Him in spirit and in truth and just in laying a foundation brother Brandon would uh this text we took was out of God's chosen place of worship he says notice the second verse uh here in Deuteronomy 16 Worship in the place that I have chosen now you must worship God he said in the place that I have chosen not what someone else chose but what I have chosen we we many times want to choose the place we want to choose the hour we want to choose the time we want to be the leader we don't want to be the follower the place that I have chosen not what somebody else chose but what I have chosen now if God chose a place it behooves us then to find out what he said about it and where it is I want to find it Hey listen to The Prophet well if the prophet wanted to find it I want to find it says I want to find it because truly I want to worship him we are all here tonight to worship him well I just want to say if you didn't know why you came here tonight you came here to worship him and I don't know how you worship but you don't have to worship like I worship and that's the beautiful thing about God's economy because a big bouquet of roses and and and N none of us are likee brother Brandon we even talk about a thumb print you know none of us are likee you don't have to worship like me and I don't have to worship like you but one thing I want to tell you I want to worship God with all of my heart I want to worship him with all of my soul I want to worship him 100% I don't want to be 80% I don't want to be 50% but if the prophet of God said we came here tonight to worship then I want to worship him I want to worship him with everything that's in I want to give my all I I want to give my all to the word I want to get behind the word I want to give him glory I want to give him praise I call his presence to come down amongst us I want to see the sick healed I I want to see the Lost saved I want to see his power manifested Among Us I've come to worship Him in spirit and in truth I want to see the same signs I want to see the same wonders it doesn't get old to me something in my heart is longing and yearning for the supernatural I want to live in the Supernatural I want to see the supernatural I want to see demon Spirits cast out I want to see limbs grown back I want to see it all because it's my inheritance I'm not going to stop short I'm not going to back up I'm not going to give up it might be a Sunday night with just a few of us but I come to see God I come to see the supernatural I come to see him sweep through the building it doesn't need to be a packed house it doesn't need to be a convention all it needs to be is two or three where I am gathered I'll be in your midst to perform my word what did you come to see what did you come to do tonight I come to praise the Lord I come to worship Him in spirit and in truth ain't no Rock going to take my place yeah sometimes as a preacher I can get discouraged oh it's it's it's Sunday night and a lot of people are out of town and there's just going to be a few of us you know you know you can start thinking like that but there's something else on the oh I'm going to have church it's the people of God we have the greatest thing that ever struck the planet Earth and I'm going to go give my all I'm going to preach my all I'm going to amen my all I'm going to sing My All I'm going to love with my all because he's worth it now you can get behind it or you can get away from it but the prophet of God said the problem is either Believe it or you don't you're either for it or you're not I say it's time to get with it let's get into action I don't want a halfway worship I want a worshiping with everything that's in me with all my heart and soul oh I like how the prophet of God said it like this he said I'm so thankful my name is on the book tonight wrote by the blood of Jesus Christ and wrote by his blood across it pardoned oh my you'll think I'm a Holy Roller after a while sure enough but brother when I think of the blood of Christ that pardoned my book of sin when I think of the blood of Jesus Christ that pardoned my book of sin and throwed it in the see of forgetfulness it makes me get happy and rejoicing I love him with all my heart if the old time power of God that's saved me and has kept me through the age I love him with all my heart tonight and I take my stand with Paul of all in the way that's called heresy so I worship the god of my fathers I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is a power of God un salvation to those that believe oh isn't that marvelous you ever get down and out why don't you start thinking about that start thinking about the blood start thinking about your name being written on the Lamb's Book of Life think about that book of sin and in his own blood he wrote a crosses had pardoned when I start thinking about that I start rejoicing I start getting happy do you do you realize what what you had waiting for you a burning hell misery and torment because you deserve it well maybe let me talk to myself then because some of you are like wait a second we were all born in sin I don't care if you grew up uh Lily white on a message Pew and you you you you you you read your Bible every single day and you've come to every church and you prayed and you hold Bible I don't care you're a sinner and you need the blood of Jesus Christ to forgive you for your sin doesn't do good enough just to go to church and I believe you can have the same experience you don't have to go out there and be marred in the things of the world and and go out there and taste sin and and go out there and see what it's all about to know what it means to be redeemed oh that's just a lie of the devil oh all this stuff I hear people delivered of I think I'll just look into watch up what youing up to you're going to be Anointed with something you better watch out you'll see something the devil put the hooks in you sin is a it's a steep a slippery slope you think you can just step off there a little bit I'll just see what it's all about you take one little step and you're like well I mean I'm just looking and all of a sudden you'll be looking back up a a a 40 mile Cliff wondering how in the world did I ever get down here just like brother Bram tells a story about his friend that was that was walking by and heard the music she had been delivered she had been set free but she just was curious oh I wonder if who it is over there and and maybe maybe what they're doing I'll just take a peek and before she knew it she was out on the dance floor in the arms of another man she come down I believe to the prophet's house banging on the oh oh Bill oh Bill oh Bill he's like what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong and she tells him the story that hey you you think that story is just there for for for just for for happen stance that's for you that story is for me it's a warning telling me son don't you stop for one second that's all it takes that that's all Satan's trying to do is to buy that time and to rob you to drop a seed in there to sew a seed uh to draw you and entice you away by your flesh and When sin is conceived it bringeth forth death none of us are exempt from that maybe you've you've you've come a little bit further but may we say like Jesus that I sanctify myself for their sake just because you can handle it doesn't mean somebody else can I I don't want to go go down these lines but the the way that we dress is very important we we don't just want to be borderline because we can be borderline how many bracelets do you need to wear anyways how many necklaces you got to wear anyways you're not satisfied with the color of your hair that God gave you there's pressure there's pressure you know you can get into I did a whole study one time on what they call good hair do you realize there was a pressure Upon Our precious uh African-American sisters on their hair go go back in look and study the good hair they weren't allowed in certain places because they they didn't want their natural hair but we don't want to talk about these things but then the pressure of the West has robbed some of our sisters to think that the hair God gave you isn't good enough I rebuke that Spirit one time I heard a sister tell I'll show you what long hair is just sit them all back there and and the girl with long hair has long long I rebuked him I said don't you tell me that some of my sisters from Africa their hair might only be an inch long but I said it's long and flowing in the glory of God because not a scissor has touched it that is long hair that is uncut hair that is pleasing to my Lord that's worshiping the father in spirit and in truth he you don't think you think I don't know what I'm talking about no I I've heard this one of my customers told me they got sick and tired of the pressure of how my hair should be and she said I just wanted to be free from it she's not no believer that's the pressure of the age that that we're living in It's Your Glory on it be proud of it wear it it's what God gave you now if and I'm not speaking about adding or doing the things some do if you if God has dealt with your heart and you're comfortable with that we know there's there's places for that God bless you don't don't let Satan try to turn things but what I'm talking about is it's not be living under the pressure of society that you have to look a certain way we all want to be accepted by co-workers and by by uh by by our schoolmates and everything what about God what is he desire what does he want when's it have you ever stood in the mirror and looked in the mirror said Lord is this pleasing to you if you did some of you wouldn't sh should be preaching pring this maybe on another service night but some of you wouldn't show up that way maybe it's a little more pastorial forgive me I'm just taking my Liberty because something in me there ought to be a liberty to worship Him in spirit and in truth not a pressure from society not a pressure from denominations not a pressure from the church but a pressure of the love of God of pressing down upon your soul that you want to love them that you want to please them that you want to worship them with everything that's within you look at our text here just moving along woman at the well she didn't know where to worship how to worship but he said the hour cometh and now is I say oh God May the hour come to me May the hour be now for me Lord that I might worship you in spirit and in truth have I been doing it by uh uh uh by by just responsibility have I been just uh doing it out of obligation but something changed when that seed was quickened come and see a man see when the word starts to discern the thought and intent of the heart when it tells you where you come from where you're going come on anybody know what I'm talking about put on any tape I don't care what it is listen the word's still a discerner it'll find you where you're at if you're listening turn it on say Lord tell me where I'm at where I'm going and where I come from just open up your ears and start listening to words of discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart he's the same yesterday yesterday today and forever he'll show you things that were he'll show you things that are going to come he doesn't only show you where you're going but he shows you how to get there oh do you know how to get there well I think we read the quote a little earlier just said believe it that's some of the challenge some of us were struggling with what to believe the word has said about you oh yeah I think we'd be a lot further along than where we are the things that we struggle with some of the attitudes and things in the church that we deal with you know the the the the wrong attitude can knock somebody out of their healing here we are right here in this congregation brother Matthew you shouldn't say it I'm going to say it some of our attit udes are hindering the move of God what did he say the unconfessed sin of you Believers you Believers didn't say you Sinners didn't say you that have come to the house of God that need to be prayed for and delivered and filled with the Holy Ghost he said the unconfessed sin of you Believers can cause this church to bitter L fail now I want to Worship the Lord with all of my heart I want to worship Him in spirit and in truth so if there's little things like this we got to make right let's make it right let's get the show on the road I I I want to I want to do my part I want to be anointed to worship God in spirit and in truth and say Lord if there's anything in me that is not pleasing unto you Lord I'm ready for a body change I'm ready to go in an exodus Lord I I'm ready to get out of here I'm ready to do all that you've commanded me to do and if there's something in my heart if there's something in my life that isn't pleasing you Lord here I am I'm laying myself open I'm laying myself be and when you see schisms and things going on through the church maybe we ought to look inwardly and wonder Lord is there something I could have done is there a way that you could have used me and was I not sensitive to your holy spirit that I could have been part of the solution maybe God would bring you into prayer and he'd bring you upon your knees we can differ upon Creeds we can differ upon man-made theories you can go to a Methodist Church you can uh you have to be a Methodist a Baptist or a Catholic but when once you're baptized into Christ and become a member of his body there is no differences the middle walls of partition is tore down and you are free because you are in Christ and you worship God in spirit and in truth and when you are in Christ Jesus it's God's plan for you to worship Him in Christ Jesus it's God's plan for you to worship Him in Christ Jesus the middle wall of partition's been tore down you're free to worship are you free are you free to praise him it's God's plan for your life to worship Him have we gotten so bottled up have we gotten so much pressure in our lives hey you tell me you're free why don't you tell your face you're free I'm free praise God I'm free why don't you act like it you don't have to tell a drunk to act like he's drunk ain't got to do it excuse me sir are you drunk yes I'm drunk well I can't tell Will you act like it well come on brother Ram said Revelation and stimulation is the same way you say you got a revelation and you believe the message and you're free you're free to worship him in the middle of wall a partition has has been broken down and come to the house of God to worship him tonight but we're so Bound by our ideas and the way we want things and the things we got to do tomorrow and it's Sunday night and I'm tired and and and Ma the preacher he I wish he would just really break the word down it's so simplistic he never really preaches anything in my in my realm this is all elementary yeah is it well why don't you finally get with the program so I can move on I'm I'm not the problem but I am the problem because I'm My Own Worst Enemy we got to possess the vessels and sanctification and honor and sometimes we got to remind ourselves listen here bag of bones I'm going to worship God I'm going to go to church and I'm going to like it I'm going to go to church and I'm going to give him glory I'm going to go to church and I'm going to amen the preacher yeah you want to amen the ball game and you want to stay home and you're tired and you want a fancy car and you want a fancy house and you want to do all those things I rebuke you pack ofon I'm going to go to church on Sunday Sunday night and on Wednesday if it cost me my job if it cost me my house I don't care what it is because I'm free I'm free to worship my god I've been anointed I am an anointed Messiah to live out this word to shine forth the resurrection of the hour oh that sounds like freedom to me everybody chasing a carrot you can barely pay the bills so you get a raise and you increase your car payment you finally get a raise and get a better job so you get a bigger house you give more to the world than you do to God huh car payments go up mortgage goes up tithing stays the same I don't know where that come from it was for somebody I want I want Liberty I I forget his name now it escapes me but you go you go read it and it was uh there when America was fighting for Independence he said what are we going to do are we going to wait until a soldiers at every single one of our houses are we going to wait until we're in shackles to finally say well we should go ahead and fight he said I I'm resolved Give me liberty or give me death I said we ought to come to that place where look Give me liberty and if I ain't going to have it I'm going to die fighting for it I'll die fighting for my family I'll die fighting for my kids I'll die fighting for you I'll die fighting for this message I'll die for this message if it cost me my home if it cost me my job if it cost me my business I will give all for him because he's worthy of giv all that is Liberty oh Hallelujah them saints of God that stood there in the in the coliseums then they said renounce your God they were so free Hallelujah they were Anointed with that Ox anointing babies being ripped out of mother's stomachs their Glory being tired and set on fire was that enough to bring them captive many walked away many renowned them because they were not free they were in bondage to fear they were in bondage to the condition of the age but there was a people that was seated in Heavenly places that were holding on to that word though you slay me Lord I trust you they gave their bodies to be burnt that was Liberty that wasn't bondage I say oh God if they could do it there I can do it here if I if I'm living in the hour where the word has been opened up and it's the it's the greatest age that that's ever struck the Earth Lord that I can give my all to serve you the middle wall of petition has been torn down we're free to worship and free to praise him that's God's plan for your life is to worship Him we'll try not to be too long you pull a little harder maybe the faster we'll go and we can get out of here free to worship him I'm not talking about denominationalism worship you know Cain had that down to the letter he built that beautiful altar but if we're not careful we're doing the same thing we build our programs we build our works we build our routine we build our habits and we get comfortable around that but Jesus said in vain do they worship me teaching the uh doctrine of man for the Commandments of God Amen in vain do they worship me with with their lips they give me praise but their hearts are far from me I say oh God lord never let let me never get to that place Lord when I find myself in just the routine and and and where I've allowed a routine or for a pattern of go of Good Works to be a substitute for coming into your presence to be a substitute for crying out for Revelation for being a substitute to seek in your face God uh check my life help me call me Lord may I Surrender away from those things and find myself longing oh God come to me in this hour Lord speak to my heart Reveal Your word to me Lord correct me where I'm Wrong Am we got people that live live any kind of way they want to live and call themselves Christians dress any kind of way listen to any kind of music we have people that call themselves Believers I'm not to be the judge but I I think it would scare us if we knew how many would stand on that day and see depart from me you doers of iniquity I never knew you I I I think it'll be surprising I pray it wouldn't be any amongst us but my Bible tells me it' be so close that it would deceive the very elective possible that be it apart from a predestinated seed oh thank God for predestination thank God for his grace thank God for his Mercy thank God for his love thank God for his protection thank God for his power thank God for keeping me thank God for for loving me thank God for reserving a seat up there for me in heaven well when I get to thinking about it I get to rejoicing it makes me happy it gets me excited I know what I was I know where I came from but oh the grace of God prophet of God would say this in the patmas vision then the most most of them go to church on Sunday that is good but even there they have no idea of how to approach God and to worship Him Jesus said that true worship was in spirit and in truth John 4:24 but what kind of worship can you get in a church that knows so little of God it puts up Santa Claus at Christmas and bunnies at Easter where did they get that they got it from pagans and made it a part of the church doctrine but when one turns to the Lord there it is that doesn't have to be out there right here right here it can be in this service but when one turns to the Lord and is filled with the Holy Ghost he ceases from all such things he has a rest in his soul he really begins to live and love God and worship him does anybody know what that's like you really begin to live you really begin to love God you really begin to worship him I I would say that if if if the message if the word of God feels like its rules and regulations and and you're constantly doing your best to abstain from lust you're you're constantly doing your best uh uh to to dress right you're you're constantly uh uh you know it's like a struggle and and and you're you're always breaking the rules and then you're always feeling condemned and then you always need to be prayed for and you always need to be encouraged and and you're on this big roller coaster that's not living if you if you're under the sound of my voice and you're going through that type of Lifestyle I want to say there's more for you God bless you for fighting God bless you for struggling but you don't have to struggle with those things there comes a place where you can turn to the Lord and old things pass away and All Things become new and you're born and filled with the spirit of God and now you can worship Him in spirit and in truth there's a real Liberty you can say I am free I'm really free to worship I'm really free to praise him I'm really free to give my all I don't worry I have to worry about the fashion trends I don't have to worry about my friends I don't have to worry about social media I don't have to worry about what they say about me at work Lord I'm going to live this message with all of my heart Lord and what becomes me becomes me but you are with me I am not alone because you are with me Lord every step of the way there's your Liberty that's real living that's a real worship unto the Lord you got to be anointed an anointed Messiah with the word coming alive in you to be able to live that out in this age David said in Psalms 99 verse 9 exalt the Lord oh God and worship at his Holy Hill for the Lord our God is holy God has a provided place of worship but you got to get there first well that sounds different there's a provided place of worship you got to get there well it's not enough to just know where it is it's not enough enough to say you know what it is you got to get there amen God has a provided place but you got to get there you got to get under the blood you got to get under the message you got to get under the word of the hour that's your protection there's the only provided place of worship is under the shed blood of Jesus Christ where is the shed blood it's in this word it's a bleeding bloody word where is The Mercy Seat it's where Christ is it's where the word is if you walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and Hallelujah and you got to get under the message you got to get under the word you got to get under the blood because there's where Fellowship is there's where Unity is there's where forgiveness is is under the blood there's been no other place provided but it's under the blood look the the letter kth but the spirit give life Moses brought the law Moses brought the lad but the spirit bringeth life the spirit of Prophecy which was the spirit that Paul had which was the spirit that Christ had which was the spirit of Elijah when you get under the spirit Hallelujah when you get under the spirit of Elijah that that's where restoration is that's where Resurrection is the latter kth what did Elijah do what did Elijah do they spread forth themselves upon the dead and the dead came back to life because they were under Elijah you got to get under the message that's where there's life under that prophetic word where else you going to worship where else is their truth what is there outside of Malachi 4:5 you don't even know how to approach him is he two Gods three Gods Oneness what is he how do I baptize you don't even know what you worship but the hour is coming and now is that I will restore sayth the Lord all that the P worm all that the C worm everything I will restore sayth the word it shall be light in the evening time this day this scripture is fulfilled oh I want to worship Him in spirit and in truth hallelujah can these Dry Bones live can these Dry Bones live thou knowest Dry Bones no life it was a valley of dry bones can these Dry Bones live I don't know they look pretty bad they look

Grace I got salvation I got the Holy Ghost I got Rapture I got the change on my body I got my family I got my daughters I got my son I got everything that I have need give me Jesus oh let that Revelation strike you well we just invite the musicians cuz I might not get in a channel like this we won't stop oh Hallelujah you like you start living in that place start getting to where John was where John was once weeping but his weeping and his crying was changed to rejoicing oh the most Sublime act in scripture why John saw his name on the book when I get to thinking about that I get excited I start to worship God bless you musicians don't don't play right away but we've been anointed you don't have to back up you don't have to sit down don't tell me Church etiquette you tell me how somebody's supposed to act when the Dead's raised you want to tell me if if one of my kids was dead and they got raised up out of the grave and I started dancing and screaming and shouting and running around you say brother that's out of order I tell you what's out of order is you not recognizing that that which is lost has come home that which is dead is now alive slay a fatted calf bring a robe let's have a party where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty I've been anointed to worship my Lord I've been anointed to give him praise I've been anointed to give him my life I've been anointed to give them all things cuz he's worthy of it bless his wonderful name kid under the blood kid under the message I like this if I haven't said something that'll make you happy maybe the prophet can say something things that are to be so how can you do it through anything else brother br's talking about how how are you going to be married to a perfect God how are you going to be married to the perfect Son of God how are you going to go in a perfect Rapture how are you going to go in a perfect body change how you going to go to a perfect place there's a perfect place that's calling you you know that Perfections calling your name come up come up Perfections calling you you know what that means that means there's perfection in you Hallelujah there's perfection in you Perfection is calling to Perfection it's in you all ready we just got to peel some layers of onions off yeah but you know what happens when you peel an onion you cry but that's okay let's start peeling the onion it's okay to cry it's okay to weep it's okay to Rejoice it's okay to praise God if you want to fit in bring an onion to church man God really moved on that Brothers shut what's that in your bag don't look at that I'm making an onion sandwich after church but when you've been anointed David didn't have to be talked up the prophet came the prophet made a visitation came down to the eighth one first one no second one know third fourth fifth 6th seventh where the word was excommunicated out of the age I didn't mean to make that type you forgive me we can have some fellowship on it though but David was anointed David was a type of Christ David was anointed for the job the prophet said you will be king now all David had to do is accept that I mean maybe he went home and went dad brothers forgive me forgive me I know I'm the youngest I know you're my dad and all but something kind of happened out there yeah we kind of know that he rejected all of us what happened we already know what happened well I I he anointed me do you know what he did it for David didn't have to wonder the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David he was anointed for the job so when The Lion and the bear came he slew it God was training him so when Goliath come out there he was like Hey I'm anointed for the job bring your sick don't scare me bring the demon possessed don't scare me bring your worst problems I've been anointed for the job you've been anointed for the job you're an anointed Messiah shining forth the resurrection these signs shall follow them that believe perfect love cast out fear you don't have to fear cancer you don't have to fear sickness you don't have to fear the demon oppressed you don't have to fear anything because you're living in love in a love relationship in a love affair moving quickly to a close how can we do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from sins that's right the blood of Christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride in amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin unad adulterated she never sinned in the first place amen she was trapped in it there's nothing left for you to do but believe it do you believe it you're forgiven you never did it in the F it's time you act like it there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus now you're starting to live when you start believing what he said then you can get past your mistakes and your failures and really start to love them really start to worship him really start to give him praise really start to accept what he did for you really start to move into that third pool and start to have an expectation for the Greater Works because you know Lord it's not what I did it's what you did if you forgave me if you put it all in the sea of God's forgetfulness if you said I'm without spot and I'm the sinless blameless bride of Jesus Christ Lord then who am I who am I to say it's not so Lord I believe you and if you can do that then certainly you can perform your will in my life yeah you say you don't feel anointed give me three minutes don't time it we've been about 50 something minutes we'll we'll be closing quickly maybe you don't feel like it I know we all go through that do anybody ever not wanted to go to church sometimes you know you let the flesh talk and then you got to slap it I really don't feel like going to church shut shut your mouth boy yeah sometimes your flesh will start talking but what you don't want to do is let it keep running its mouth you say hold him up I know you're tired boy but Christ was more tired than you he went from The Upper Room walked all the way down in the garden of cimity his blood separated blood come out of his head he didn't never even sleep then was dragged into this cart and that car was beaten was fogged then I had to carry a cross up calary I think he was tired the least I can do is make it to his house got a fancy car and a nice suit with AC yeah when you start looking at the other way you kind of feel a little foolish foolish I got it pretty good you need to get your act together you little softy you call yourself a rugged Christian really I'm preaching to myself a little bit that's all right oh my I I don't want to be bound to the ways of man I don't want to be bound to this flesh I want to be free but it's in the times you don't feel like it it's in the time of Despair it's in the time of the trial that you've been anointed to worship look at Paul and Silas they had been beaten and thrown in jail and I'm guessing they didn't have padded chairs they were in a Roman cell they had been beaten they had been flogged they they had uh uh ankle uh bracelet chains around them they were chained to the wall and what did they do they begin to praise and worship the Lord oh Hallelujah you know there's power in worship there's power in your praise and in their Despair and in their trial look Abraham said look uh y'all stay here while me and the lad Go In Worship that didn't sound like a pretty worship service he was going to sacrifice his son but it's in the times when it's not pretty it's in the times when it's rugged it's in the time of Despair when you allow that anointed word word within you that says by his stripes I'm Healed I will praise the Lord and what does the scripture say while they were giving him praise it says and suddenly I like that word and suddenly maybe you just need to start praising the Lord and worshiping the Lord in your condition in your despair your sickness and your trial maybe it's in that condition in that place for your family for your loved one for whatever why don't you just start praising the Lord worshiping the Lord and then suddenly there was an earthquake and the bands and the bonds and the walls were shaking and the jail Cil doors came open all because of their worship unto the Lord maybe if you can play something softly you've been anointed to worship I think if anybody has been anointed to worship it's the Bride of Jesus Christ has your name been written on the Lamb's Book of Life have you been pardoned have you been forgiven have you heard from your theophany are you caught away in the Rapture cycle do you have the promise of your family come on did you not believe for years when the promise was he not faithful year after year after year you prayed and believed and believed and was God not faithful he's faithful I think he's worthy of Praise I think he's worthy for us to tell them how much we love them I got one last [Music] quote now Mary could have waited till she had some kind of sign that she was going to be mother and you could wait after the meeting's over until you feel that you could move your crippled leg just a little better or you could hear a little better out of that deaf ear or the cancer seemed to be that it wasn't bothering you so much that's not taking God at his word this the last quote let's focus in here that's not taking God at his word to take take God at his word is to hear his word and accept it and start rejoicing with it oh Hallelujah you don't have to wait for sensation you don't got to wait for a feeling you ain't got to wait for a doctor's note all you got to do is hear the word accept it and start rejoicing with it we could see 500 rush to the altar tonight which would be a good sign that the Revival is going to break we don't have to have 500 at the altar we just have to take God's word for it and start rejoicing something will happen somebody just need to start rejoicing that brings the word to life as we water it with praises what makes a seed grow water what makes the word of God grow is the Praises of God when Jesus told them to wait in the upper room the city of Jerusalem until they were endued with power from an eye that word fell on their ears they was in the temple continually praising God day and night what was they doing watering that promise and all of a sudden Hallelujah there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting the word was being watered and

come from that cancer start watering the word L riy tonight here is a testimony that God heals cancer he heals cancer he heals all of our sicknesses thousands times thousands of infallible proofs oh that we've seen but what you got to do you got to start watering the word with your Praises you've heard the word you believe the word maybe the thing that you haven't done is start rejoicing with the word why don't you start rejoicing right now for the promise you've already accepted start watering it with praise I'm going to have a baby I'm going to have a baby why he promised it I'm going to
