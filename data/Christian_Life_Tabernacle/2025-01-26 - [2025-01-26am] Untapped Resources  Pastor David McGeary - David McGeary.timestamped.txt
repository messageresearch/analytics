[34:33] Lord Lord we just take this time during
[34:37] the service to bring the tithes and
[34:41] offerings before you
[34:43] Lord we thank you that you've given us
[34:46] an opportunity to give
[34:49] back lord you gave all yes and you ask
[34:54] just a little Lord of these Earthly
[34:56] things that you've blessed us with to
[34:57] show our love back to
[35:00] you so Lord we thank you for this
[35:02] opportunity to give Lord and we know
[35:05] that when we give with a loving heart
[35:07] and obedience to your word Lord we could
[35:10] never outgive you Lord may it just
[35:13] become a greater Revelation in our heart
[35:15] Lord of what it truly means to give and
[35:18] we know Lord that you'll take these
[35:20] tithes and these offerings and Lord
[35:23] you'll use it to further your
[35:25] kingdom and Lord those that don't have
[35:29] or those
[35:31] that feel the strain Lord may they just
[35:34] fully surrender to you and your word and
[35:36] know that just like that lady who gave
[35:40] the
[35:42] might she gave the greatest Lord even
[35:44] though it looked like she gave the least
[35:46] but you recognized and you saw it Lord
[35:49] and
[35:50] so you wrote of her and she was blessed
[35:54] so Lord we commit those tithes into thy
[35:56] hands Lord and also as we come before
[35:59] you Lord there's many needs
[36:02] and spiritual and
[36:06] physical but father when you went to
[36:10] Calvary and you said it is finished Lord
[36:13] and we can look into your word and know
[36:15] that by your stripes we are already
[36:18] healed we've been taught Lord
[36:21] to want to have a purpose for healing
[36:25] Lord I think of certain ones that are
[36:26] sitting in our mid Lord they've been
[36:28] believing for certain
[36:31] promises Lord and think of Hannah how
[36:34] she purposed that Lord you'd give her a
[36:37] child and her purpose was that that
[36:39] child would be given unto you Lord all
[36:42] of the healing and everything that we're
[36:44] believing for we give it unto you father
[36:47] for a wellbody we'll serve you with all
[36:49] of our heart Lord for our lost loved
[36:52] ones that'll come into the kingdom Lord
[36:53] that they'll give you all of their heart
[36:55] Lord there's many needs Lord and we all
[36:58] by faith want to start walking into that
[37:00] well body father not to just be well to
[37:02] serve the world Lord but to be well to
[37:05] be a great witness Lord to be well to
[37:08] further your kingdom Lord we're not
[37:10] believing for Natural Things Lord we're
[37:12] believing for the supernatural Lord that
[37:14] you would have your will and your way
[37:16] Lord for we know that Divine Healing is
[37:18] just the earnest of the body change Lord
[37:21] and soon and very soon we're going to be
[37:23] changed in a twinkling of an eye Lord to
[37:25] meet you in the air Lord so may we start
[37:28] living for that father may we wake up
[37:30] with that purpose upon our heart a
[37:33] purpose of serving you Lord a a purpose
[37:36] of of giving all to you being a true
[37:38] lamb that's led by your spirit Lord I
[37:40] think of uh brother Joe Green a minister
[37:43] who's had a heart attack Lord you've
[37:45] already moved on the scene and he's
[37:46] stabilized but yet Lord we lift him up
[37:49] before you again Lord we just love you
[37:51] father we're looking for a great move
[37:53] lord of the supernatural in our midst
[37:56] this morning not something that that
[37:58] could be gauged by the senses Lord but
[38:00] something that's gauged by Faith Lord
[38:03] that this mind would be in US Lord that
[38:05] we can we can move into a realm into the
[38:08] supernatural into Heavenly places which
[38:10] is our position father where we can
[38:13] possess all things Lord for we know that
[38:15] this is the hour of the Overcomer this
[38:18] is the hour of the bright age Lord and
[38:20] may we just believe for it all Lord
[38:22] knowing that you've made it all
[38:23] available to us Lord we pray and just
[38:26] give all things to to you now thanking
[38:28] you giving you the praise Lord may may
[38:31] we just even start to praise you now for
[38:33] the manifestation Lord may we start to
[38:35] praise you now for the healing may we
[38:37] start to praise you now for the the
[38:39] prodical sons and daughters that are
[38:40] coming home may we start praising you

[48:12] star and you loved us and you claimed us
[48:16] and you said this is
[48:20] mine father you brought us here that we
[48:23] could come to know you and love you and
[48:26] serve you
[48:28] and be what you would have us to
[48:33] be father may we
[48:36] just become so humble in that love that
[48:40] you have father May the love of God be
[48:44] shed abroad in our heart by your Holy
[48:47] Spirit we ask each one this morning
[48:50] Father that you would meet their
[48:53] particular need their particular
[48:55] challenge
[48:57] father that you would stand with them in
[49:00] battle for we have an enemy that goes
[49:04] about like a roaring line that seeking
[49:08] whom you may devour but we have this
[49:11] promise that he who is in US is greater
[49:15] than he who is in the world we ask you
[49:17] to bless the people this morning in
[49:20] Jesus precious and wonderful name we
[49:23] pray amen amen
[49:27] God bless you we uh as you open your
[49:29] Bibles uh it it turn uh to Ephesians the
[49:35] fourth chapter uh we do have a couple uh
[49:38] small announcements
[49:41] um that we'd like to make if um
[49:46] um and uh so some of the things that uh
[49:52] we want to do if you would help us now
[49:56] we we we need your help so that uh you
[49:59] got to realize that so um if you could
[50:04] come when you come to church you know
[50:06] come in as far as you uh can to the
[50:09] front and sit and uh fill in any spots
[50:14] that you can do and and help us um um so
[50:18] just make it easier and uh for that and
[50:23] uh for everybody so we'll give you that
[50:25] and also um what we want to do is we
[50:29] want we don't want to have any
[50:32] eating in this uh building so mothers if
[50:37] you want to give your children cookies
[50:40] or peanut butter sandwiches or hot dogs
[50:43] or in church uh go over to the
[50:48] fellowship hall so the fellowship hall
[50:50] will be open for uh feeding children so
[50:56] so like in the nurseries don't don't
[50:59] feed your kids and that we have a
[51:02] nursing nursery for nursing mothers but
[51:04] when your kids are old enough to eat and
[51:07] chew and then go over into the uh uh
[51:11] Fellowship Hall they'll have a table set
[51:13] up over there you can go in there and if
[51:16] you want to sleep um no more sleeping in
[51:20] the fouryear so if you uh come and you
[51:24] need to take a a nap during service if
[51:28] you would go over to the forer I mean
[51:31] over to the fellowship hall and you can
[51:35] uh lay your head on the table and sleep
[51:38] over there I think that's a wonderful
[51:41] [Music]
[51:43] compromise don't you so you can still
[51:46] come to church and
[51:50] sleep I I think that's
[51:52] great I think that's as kind and as
[51:55] gentle now now George Smith he said he'd
[51:58] throw a a level at you or something but
[52:03] I I won't call you out or nothing so you
[52:06] just cooperate you come to church and I
[52:08] really don't want to be in here it's I'm
[52:11] really tired so I would rather lay down
[52:15] I said well praise
[52:16] God just go next
[52:19] door and lay your head on the table and
[52:22] and and there you said I I want to eat
[52:25] I'm
[52:27] go next door and eat that's what it's
[52:29] there for we put it there for
[52:33] you and I think that's wonderful so if
[52:37] you would do that if you would help us
[52:39] in that that way we can keep uh the
[52:44] house of the Lord
[52:47] uh uh for worship and and the word of
[52:52] God so let's just read this uh uh this
[52:56] verse in uh Ephesians the 4th chapter
[53:02] and
[53:04] um and and this uh just kind of rose up
[53:09] on my heart here just a little bit ago
[53:11] but uh it fit in with the some of the
[53:14] things that I'm been on my heart it says
[53:19] I therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[53:24] beseech you that ye walk worthy of the
[53:30] vocation wherewith ye are
[53:34] called great scripture so that's what
[53:36] we're all here striving to do this
[53:39] morning is to walk worthy of the Gospel
[53:43] is your life
[53:45] worthy of the
[53:48] Gospel with all liness and meekness with
[53:54] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[53:58] love I want you to notice there again
[54:02] the unity the forbearing one
[54:05] another one another you're going to find
[54:08] out there's a lot in the word of God
[54:10] about one another forbearing one another
[54:15] in love endeavoring to keep the
[54:20] unity of the
[54:23] spirit in the bond of peace peace so we
[54:28] see that there is a
[54:30] Unity of the
[54:33] spirit so we see there there's
[54:38] Unity there is one
[54:42] body one
[54:44] Spirit even as ye are called in one hope
[54:51] of your calling so we all have one hope
[54:55] of our
[54:57] calling uh one Lord One Faith one
[55:04] baptism one God and Father of all who is
[55:09] above
[55:10] all and through
[55:13] all and in you
[55:17] all somebody told me that proof that
[55:21] Paul was a
[55:24] dexon and in you all
[55:27] so but unto every one of us is given
[55:32] Grace according to the measure of the
[55:36] gift of
[55:38] Christ and he says and wherefore he said
[55:43] when he ascended up on high he led
[55:47] captive captivity and gave gifts unto
[55:51] men Our Father we ask you to bless us in
[55:54] your precious name we pray amen you may
[55:57] be seated this
[56:01] [Music]
[56:11] morning my a heart's desire if I could
[56:15] uh Express that you know somebody was
[56:18] talking me to the other day and um they
[56:23] were uh they made the comment they said
[56:26] uh brother McGary you're a Visionary and
[56:30] uh I didn't
[56:32] know what that that meant or what they
[56:35] they were
[56:36] saying and uh because I'm not one to
[56:40] have like what people would think of
[56:42] Visions you know what I mean so ma
[56:46] automatically in my thinking I would
[56:49] think that you have a vision you know
[56:52] what I mean but what they what they say
[56:55] is simple is that some people can look
[56:59] at something and
[57:02] visualize and see something in its
[57:06] place like I can take a set of
[57:10] blueprints and it might be just lines
[57:13] and everything but I can actually
[57:16] visualize it or I can see it or I if I
[57:21] when we uh built this building uh we
[57:26] knew what we wanted to accomplish we
[57:29] could see what it was going to look like
[57:32] what it was going to be like what we
[57:34] tried to do so that's something that you
[57:38] have in your heart you're you're you're
[57:41] made that way uh and some people they
[57:45] they can draw things and you know what I
[57:48] mean and so they can put it in
[57:52] visually um but you you just have that
[57:56] and so you find out that your life is
[57:59] driven by you you see a picture in front
[58:02] of you what that it is you want to build
[58:06] what that it is that you want the result
[58:10] to be and you can see the result ahead
[58:13] of you and you're driven to uh the
[58:19] accomplishment of that result so uh it's
[58:23] becomes a drive in you you look
[58:27] and you know you see a piece of property
[58:30] and and cuz I'm a builder and I said
[58:33] that you know I want to build a house
[58:35] here and I got what it looks like and I
[58:37] sit down with the guy and we draw it and
[58:40] I said put this here this and we want
[58:43] this and and it's just it's very Vivid
[58:46] to me and very real and in my heart you
[58:51] know I I was thinking that the last uh
[58:55] year
[58:56] just the other day uh we finished uh
[59:00] with the little building in the back and
[59:02] we finished with the uh Pavilion now
[59:06] alls we have is just a couple little
[59:08] sidewalks to build and and and we're
[59:12] done and the vision of the
[59:16] building is
[59:19] complete so I thought well you know
[59:22] there's not much to build eventually I
[59:26] like to put in a fire nice fire pit in a
[59:28] fireplace and and another little place
[59:31] you know and and and that's down the
[59:34] road but now we've accomplished this and
[59:37] my vision then I I noticed my vision was
[59:42] turning to no longer the
[59:46] building but a vision of the
[59:50] inhabitants of the
[59:53] building what is it that
[59:56] we want to be uh what is the
[1:00:02] desire uh that we have uh for the body
[1:00:09] of Believers what body do we want to be
[1:00:13] what is it what is it that that uh your
[1:00:18] the vision that I have and and uh that's
[1:00:23] driving me and I begin to uh begin to be
[1:00:28] so moved to the fact that uh first of
[1:00:33] all I want our characteristic to be that
[1:00:36] we love one another amen that that uh
[1:00:42] there's something that I believe that
[1:00:44] God is is Desiring and that he wants uh
[1:00:50] uh for the church and I'd like to just
[1:00:54] uh maybe uh
[1:00:58] read this to you because it kind of
[1:01:00] expresses the vision that I have so
[1:01:04] there's something that I see in the word
[1:01:06] of God and I want it for us I want us to
[1:01:11] be this kind of people I want us to be
[1:01:15] this kind of church I want us to have
[1:01:19] this kind of atmosphere this kind of
[1:01:22] care one for another and I want it to be
[1:01:25] the the the love and the care that's
[1:01:29] from the word of God and I want us to
[1:01:32] really be
[1:01:34] established in the scriptures and in the
[1:01:38] word of God to have scripture and to
[1:01:41] have uh they have the the substance of
[1:01:46] the word of God and and for above that
[1:01:50] we want to be a people of faith and
[1:01:54] without faith is impossible to believe
[1:01:57] God and we just don't want a couple of
[1:02:00] people having faith we want everybody to
[1:02:04] have faith we we we want to be one body
[1:02:08] one mind one God above us all one God in
[1:02:12] us all you know and and uh with this
[1:02:17] care one for another with this a feeling
[1:02:20] apart we don't want anybody to feel for
[1:02:24] any instance that
[1:02:26] that they're not a part of the body
[1:02:28] because of their age because of their
[1:02:31] look because of their background we
[1:02:34] preached a sermon in Africa called the
[1:02:37] Journey of the seed and we wanted the
[1:02:39] people to understand it doesn't matter
[1:02:42] where you come from or or or the ground
[1:02:45] that's not what's important it's the
[1:02:48] seed that what was important and and so
[1:02:51] it could be in any kind of ground so
[1:02:54] your background might be terrible that
[1:02:56] doesn't keep you from being a part of
[1:02:58] the body you know you you you may uh not
[1:03:02] be the most
[1:03:05] uh I don't even know how to say it
[1:03:08] because you know people are so body
[1:03:11] orientated anymore you know what's
[1:03:14] beautiful and what's not and all this
[1:03:17] but we don't want looks to to be able to
[1:03:20] determine you to be a part of the body
[1:03:23] we want our part of the body to be
[1:03:25] because our hearts are in one mind and
[1:03:29] one Accord with one
[1:03:32] calling and and with one goal and we we
[1:03:36] talked about that last week a little bit
[1:03:38] about how that uh that uh uh teamwork
[1:03:43] had all these qualities then we talked a
[1:03:45] week before about success in the
[1:03:48] individual has all these qualities and
[1:03:50] we found out every single one of those
[1:03:53] is in the scripture because the body was
[1:03:57] something that God had
[1:04:00] instituted you understand so you're
[1:04:03] you're you in order for you to really
[1:04:06] please God you have to be the
[1:04:10] institution that God made you as an
[1:04:15] individual and follow the scriptures of
[1:04:19] success for your individual success and
[1:04:23] then God poked that individual members
[1:04:26] in particular put them in a body and
[1:04:30] then that body has got the
[1:04:34] function together with one
[1:04:38] Accord we have to come in the right
[1:04:42] Spirit we've got to come in the in one
[1:04:45] Accord
[1:04:47] believing that that we're hearing the
[1:04:50] word of God believing and and and having
[1:04:54] faith and and so the this Unity that the
[1:04:59] Lord is that the vision that's on my
[1:05:04] heart so we've built the building now we
[1:05:07] have a vision for the
[1:05:10] occupancy we couldn't really work on the
[1:05:14] occupancy until we had the building to
[1:05:17] put the occupancy in to to to work on
[1:05:22] and and I need working on so this isn't
[1:05:24] just you this is
[1:05:27] us you understand it's not uh it's not
[1:05:31] uh we only have one I
[1:05:34] am you know the rest of us is we
[1:05:38] are yeah and so this is what he is and
[1:05:41] so this is what the prophet of God is
[1:05:43] and this is just one little statement
[1:05:46] out of the message um uniting time and
[1:05:50] sign but he said God is uniting his
[1:05:53] bride
[1:05:57] she is coming
[1:05:59] together from the East and the west from
[1:06:03] the North and South there is a uniting
[1:06:07] time and that's on right now what she
[1:06:11] uning
[1:06:13] for the
[1:06:15] Rapture Hallelujah that's right right so
[1:06:19] we what's what is the one hope of Our
[1:06:22] Calling The Rapture amen what is our
[1:06:26] vocation to help one another make
[1:06:30] it right amen God's getting her ready
[1:06:35] yes sir uniting what is she uniting with
[1:06:40] with the word for all the heavens and
[1:06:43] earth will pass away but my word shall
[1:06:45] never pass away she's uniting herself
[1:06:48] with thus saith the Lord regardless of
[1:06:52] what any denomination or anybody else
[1:06:55] says she's uniting herself she's getting
[1:07:01] ready well you know we've always thought
[1:07:04] of getting ready I've got to get ready
[1:07:06] I've got to get ready you know well you
[1:07:11] know how that
[1:07:12] is but how about he said
[1:07:18] she is getting herself ready
[1:07:23] we are getting ourselves ready
[1:07:26] we as a church so what our vision is is
[1:07:30] we want to be a ready Church a ready
[1:07:35] people that there be no sissons among
[1:07:38] you no divisions among you no bitterness
[1:07:42] among you no gossip Among Us no big eyes
[1:07:46] or little ears but in one mind in one
[1:07:49] spirit and one Accord they all came
[1:07:53] together and when they got there they
[1:07:55] were endued with power from on high and
[1:08:00] and so and and we're going to talk about
[1:08:02] faith and we're going to talk about
[1:08:05] power that that's what we want to have
[1:08:09] we want to be a church of faith and
[1:08:11] power that's our vision but there's a
[1:08:14] way to get there and she's made herself
[1:08:17] ready and so he's uniting her and
[1:08:20] putting her on a course and she said she
[1:08:24] she's getting ready why she is the bride
[1:08:29] that's right and she's
[1:08:32] United herself with her
[1:08:35] bridegroom and the bridegroom is the
[1:08:38] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:08:40] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:08:43] God and the Word was God and the Word
[1:08:46] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and
[1:08:49] the church and the
[1:08:51] bride and the word is
[1:08:53] becoming one
[1:08:56] until every word itself is working out
[1:09:01] the works of the
[1:09:07] bridegroom okay
[1:09:09] now this isn't a me
[1:09:14] challenge see we've always made it a a a
[1:09:18] you challenge you get yourself ready you
[1:09:22] you you you you and everybody's doing
[1:09:25] their own
[1:09:27] thing and and there's no you know that's
[1:09:31] not the beauty of it the beauty of it is
[1:09:34] when we as a body unite
[1:09:38] ourselves with the
[1:09:41] word and we are all of us in here
[1:09:48] together performing the desire of the
[1:09:53] bridegroom that's your
[1:09:56] takes makes it beautiful don't it and
[1:09:58] this is so he says it he
[1:10:02] says word itself and is working out the
[1:10:07] work of the bridegroom amen you see it
[1:10:11] the
[1:10:12] uniting not no more join the church not
[1:10:17] no no more of this but flee from
[1:10:23] everything and tith to Jesus Christ see
[1:10:27] it's the uniting time God uniting his
[1:10:33] bride
[1:10:35] together bringing it back to just
[1:10:39] exactly uniting the words of his
[1:10:46] promise right so I mean that's a great
[1:10:51] vision now we want to absolutely delve
[1:10:54] in
[1:10:55] and that's what we've been doing for the
[1:10:57] last week this is a
[1:10:59] vision of people that love one another
[1:11:02] care one for another have their hearts
[1:11:04] and Minds on one another so our our
[1:11:07] question now is how do we get
[1:11:10] there how do you have that
[1:11:14] Unity how how do we come in to that a
[1:11:21] place where when you walk into the
[1:11:24] church you're not walking with complexes
[1:11:27] you're not feeling you're being judged
[1:11:30] uh you're you're you you you you're not
[1:11:33] wondering about what people think you're
[1:11:37] not wondering if you're a
[1:11:41] part I mean it's it's even better than a
[1:11:45] having a a ticket to an
[1:11:49] event you know we we we like classical
[1:11:52] music I couldn't tell you A C from a d
[1:11:55] but I loved going to classical music I
[1:11:58] love to watch the orchestra brother Ram
[1:12:00] talked about the
[1:12:01] orchestra and you I had tickets for a
[1:12:04] long time and I knew where my seat
[1:12:09] was and I could walk in that front door
[1:12:13] of that place my shoulders
[1:12:18] back I'm a
[1:12:21] member of the symphony Society
[1:12:27] of Fort
[1:12:28] Worth
[1:12:30] I have
[1:12:32] tickets well I had to pay for those
[1:12:35] tickets okay so just to be honest I
[1:12:38] bought the right to do that but somebody
[1:12:42] else bought the right for us to do
[1:12:46] it but I could walk down and take my
[1:12:50] seat and sit right there and enjoy every
[1:12:55] bit of what was being presented and I
[1:12:58] could stand up at the end and go bravo
[1:13:08] bravo how could sit in there and be
[1:13:10] moved to
[1:13:12] tears
[1:13:14] why I had a
[1:13:18] right and that's our goal we don't want
[1:13:21] to leave any one
[1:13:24] behind we don't want anybody to don't
[1:13:27] feel that they're a part of this we want
[1:13:31] everybody to know they're called
[1:13:33] everybody to know they're elected and
[1:13:36] everybody to know that they've been ued
[1:13:38] with power from on
[1:13:43] high and this scripture keeps rolling
[1:13:46] through my heart and my life and it's
[1:13:50] found I I think it's St John 5 and 24
[1:13:55] course I'm I'm not I should have it
[1:13:56] memorized by now but it says herein is
[1:13:59] the love of God made
[1:14:02] perfect as he
[1:14:05] is so are we in this world not so am I
[1:14:11] so are
[1:14:15] we now can you imagine every single one
[1:14:18] of us caring one for another members in
[1:14:22] particular fitted and joined together
[1:14:29] no no doubt if you had a bad
[1:14:33] week you know I got a place of Refuge I
[1:14:37] got a body of Believers I'm going to get
[1:14:39] there I'm going to walk in the church
[1:14:41] and I'm going to make my spirit right
[1:14:43] father forgive me I'm going to cry ABA
[1:14:46] father I'm going to confess my sins and
[1:14:49] he's going to be faithful and just to
[1:14:52] forgive me
[1:14:56] and I can place myself under the blood
[1:14:59] of the Lamb cleanse from all
[1:15:02] righteousness I can get in the spirit
[1:15:04] and say Lord I'm here to pull I'm here
[1:15:07] to push I'm here to be there for my
[1:15:09] brother and sister I'm here to cor to uh
[1:15:13] uh have the right atmosphere and to be a
[1:15:18] contributor to the body of
[1:15:23] Christ we want to get rid of these
[1:15:25] things you know we don't want you know
[1:15:28] we don't want people coming to the house
[1:15:29] of God and sitting down and then after
[1:15:33] word say you know the brother didn't
[1:15:35] even recognize
[1:15:39] me oh I
[1:15:41] didn't well the reason I didn't is
[1:15:44] probably because somebody above me
[1:15:47] didn't amen when you come in here with
[1:15:50] that kind of attitude or that kind of
[1:15:53] atmosphere
[1:15:56] if you get under conviction it's not
[1:16:00] he's putting me under conviction he's
[1:16:02] stepping on my toes well maybe your toes
[1:16:05] are too
[1:16:09] long maybe you need a
[1:16:17] pedicure you know what I mean so you
[1:16:20] don't say oh he said you say Thank you
[1:16:23] Lord I Want to Be Right
[1:16:25] right every son and daughter is
[1:16:28] chastised thank you Lord I know brother
[1:16:30] doesn't know me he he doesn't know me
[1:16:33] from anybody else this is you talking to
[1:16:36] me Lord okay this everybody in here
[1:16:39] loves
[1:16:41] me everybody else is is remembers that
[1:16:45] they were
[1:16:46] saved from sin
[1:16:50] also that's what he says it says if you
[1:16:52] don't have these things you forgot that
[1:16:55] you too once were saved from
[1:16:59] sin and and and we don't we come out of
[1:17:04] our
[1:17:05] shells we come out of our own individual
[1:17:08] Little Lives of just trying to pay our
[1:17:11] bills and and we start to come to the
[1:17:14] place that we we understand our life and
[1:17:18] the part of the puzzle that we are a
[1:17:20] part of is bigger and above this world
[1:17:27] and God placed
[1:17:31] you where you are for a
[1:17:34] purpose that's right and and it's
[1:17:39] imperative for the Fulfillment of the
[1:17:42] word of
[1:17:44] God for the
[1:17:48] preparation of the
[1:17:50] Rapture for us to come into this Unity
[1:17:54] when one with
[1:17:56] another don't count yourself
[1:17:59] out so that's my
[1:18:04] vision and we want to start pursuing
[1:18:09] that
[1:18:10] road of a church that's in Union with
[1:18:13] one
[1:18:14] another and every member is filled with
[1:18:19] the
[1:18:21] power of the Holy
[1:18:23] Spirit and they have the
[1:18:26] faith to use
[1:18:29] it and so we want to play for you this
[1:18:37] morning uh 15 minutes just 15 minutes
[1:18:42] out of the message perfect
[1:18:46] faith and we're talking about a
[1:18:52] condition of the called to deciples
[1:18:56] hallu okay so these men were
[1:18:59] elected and
[1:19:02] chosen okay then that's what the
[1:19:05] scripture says you didn't choose me I
[1:19:08] chose you so anybody who's in here and
[1:19:12] you think you're in here by your own
[1:19:14] free will really it don't work that
[1:19:20] way right you know it might be for some
[1:19:24] but but for the
[1:19:26] elect you understand they they're the
[1:19:31] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:19:33] by the
[1:19:34] Lord so if God leads you someplace else
[1:19:40] if you were to leave this body to go
[1:19:44] someplace else I would want you to be
[1:19:47] everything in that body that you were in
[1:19:51] this body that's right
[1:19:55] so wherever you were you represent the
[1:20:00] unity that you have in Christ Jesus so
[1:20:05] our
[1:20:06] election is sure and the scripture says
[1:20:10] make your
[1:20:12] election
[1:20:15] sure okay this is where we find the
[1:20:19] disciples in this story they prayed for
[1:20:22] a leopard and nothing
[1:20:25] got
[1:20:27] done and the bo the father brought the
[1:20:32] child to Jesus and said your disciples
[1:20:37] couldn't do
[1:20:39] it and the reason they couldn't is they
[1:20:42] were
[1:20:43] in a
[1:20:46] condition so it's not the question today
[1:20:49] whether he
[1:20:51] can we all know he can can that's right
[1:20:57] how many understand that there's nobody
[1:21:00] in here that doesn't believe that God
[1:21:02] can do
[1:21:04] anything we believe that but it's not
[1:21:09] that he can he wants to get the he can
[1:21:13] to the you
[1:21:19] can okay that's what and he wants you as
[1:21:24] an
[1:21:25] individual to know that that is your God
[1:21:32] given
[1:21:36] right not
[1:21:39] earned but he
[1:21:41] elected Chosen and given and he departed
[1:21:46] gifts unto men he led captive captivity
[1:21:51] captive and he gave gifts unto men so
[1:21:54] this this is where we're picking the
[1:21:55] story up G and the prophet of God of the
[1:21:58] next 15 minutes is going to talk about
[1:22:02] positioning he's going to talk about
[1:22:05] faith he's going to talk about a few
[1:22:07] little things and then we just going to
[1:22:10] just go just a little bit out of here
[1:22:14] and and let's start rising
[1:22:19] up I I I think it might be in here that
[1:22:23] he makes this statement right uh in the
[1:22:25] beginning uh see if
[1:22:29] he if this is the one but there's a
[1:22:31] place that he says the church has got to
[1:22:34] pull itself up by its
[1:22:37] bootstraps amen so God bless you this
[1:22:40] morning uh uh let's go forward and this
[1:22:44] is where I wanted to be last week and I
[1:22:47] know I got a I I started trying to cover
[1:22:51] a few things but I'm back on track
[1:22:56] so enjoy this uh next 15 minutes as we
[1:23:02] uh uh listen to our messenger trying to
[1:23:06] build in
[1:23:08] US perfect faith that we can be a
[1:23:11] perfect Church in perfect unity and God
[1:23:15] bless
[1:23:17] you I I want you to get this now we the
[1:23:21] church has got to lift itself in the
[1:23:24] power of God how we're too close to the
[1:23:27] end now and I believe the church is in
[1:23:30] condition where we can teach it a little
[1:23:32] deeper things and rub some of this make
[1:23:35] belief out see you get into something
[1:23:38] real see it's got to be something that
[1:23:41] you
[1:23:43] know if you say U uh brother brandom uh
[1:23:48] that isn't a light yet I know it's a
[1:23:52] light how do you know it's I'm looking
[1:23:55] at it well how do you know you could be
[1:23:58] wrong my sight has always declared to me
[1:24:01] that that was life see and that's the
[1:24:04] reason I believe those Visions because
[1:24:05] it's always declared to me the truth
[1:24:07] because it comes from the word amen then
[1:24:11] if he says it that settles it now when
[1:24:13] it's declared like that there's no more
[1:24:15] Guess Word it's going to be then you
[1:24:18] hear it th fath the law see because it's
[1:24:22] it's Beyond in human thinking it's up
[1:24:24] into the reals of the Lord's thing but
[1:24:27] you're standing here just as a Vine just
[1:24:30] as a branch producing the fruit that's
[1:24:32] in the vine see God uses man and man
[1:24:36] only God doesn't use Machinery God
[1:24:38] doesn't use groups of man God doesn't
[1:24:40] use organization God uses
[1:24:43] individuals
[1:24:45] always now Faith is the substance and by
[1:24:49] it we understand all those things to
[1:24:51] done it's not a it's not a inag ination
[1:24:55] it is a substance especially perfect
[1:24:58] Faith that's what I'm talking on tonight
[1:25:00] getting to perfect
[1:25:02] faith it is not an imagination now other
[1:25:06] that people come say oh I got all Faith
[1:25:08] oh I sure have or you stand here for
[1:25:10] this see see your your very actions
[1:25:14] prove that you haven't got what you're
[1:25:16] talking about see if you had Faith then
[1:25:19] what you stand the prayer line for see
[1:25:22] what do you do these things for see if
[1:25:24] you had perfect Faith you'd look right
[1:25:26] straight at God and believe it and walk
[1:25:28] away you would you would have no need of
[1:25:31] coming into a
[1:25:32] prayer you'd have no need of these
[1:25:34] things because your faith is done made
[1:25:36] it so am see what would be the use for
[1:25:40] me saying I got to put a shirt
[1:25:43] on I got a shirt on how do you know you
[1:25:46] got a shirt on well I see it feel it and
[1:25:50] I know it's there well that's just how
[1:25:52] real that when perfect Faith takes the
[1:25:55] whole there you don't need no more
[1:25:58] praise God it's already done you know it
[1:26:00] hallelujah how do you know it Faith
[1:26:02] tells me so amen that's it see do you
[1:26:06] get it now what I mean that's perfect
[1:26:08] Faith now other words I'm venturing out
[1:26:11] well I'll go the Bible say call the
[1:26:13] Elders let them know pray over I know
[1:26:15] I'll go and you said well I'm going to
[1:26:17] be he see you're making yourself if
[1:26:19] don't watch how you go to make yourself
[1:26:21] just just worked out then when he pass
[1:26:24] you you say oh I I still don't feel see
[1:26:27] there he was you didn't have faith your
[1:26:31] genuine faithful do it right there your
[1:26:33] your genuine faith will make it so real
[1:26:36] to you that look at that little woman
[1:26:38] with the blood issue she said if I can
[1:26:41] we're going to stop for a moment uh the
[1:26:44] books didn't line up so we're going to
[1:26:46] go back and find uh where that it is
[1:26:50] that we want to start okay so we can can
[1:26:55] follow it through cuz if he's going to
[1:26:57] be way ahead of me and uh then I'm
[1:27:00] really going to be
[1:27:02] stuck you know what I'm saying because
[1:27:06] uh but so we'll just we'll just we want
[1:27:08] to get it right and uh uh get it so uh I
[1:27:13] I sometimes uh some of the books don't
[1:27:16] line up in the paragraphs so it's not
[1:27:18] the brothers in the back's fault so uh I
[1:27:22] think Gary's back there with the book
[1:27:25] and he's going to get them U uh to the
[1:27:28] right spot on on the tape so anyway one
[1:27:33] of the things that we want to entitle
[1:27:37] our sermon this morning is untapped
[1:27:41] resources so uh that's where uh the
[1:27:45] where that we're going is with untapped
[1:27:48] resources the things that are available
[1:27:52] to us that were not
[1:27:55] using and uh so just to jump ahead while
[1:28:00] they're getting ready uh to say it this
[1:28:03] way so uh we know that all things are
[1:28:07] possible that's that's what that we want
[1:28:11] to understand is that all things are
[1:28:14] possible and and uh uh and uh so he he
[1:28:19] makes this statement in
[1:28:21] Hebrews uh if we could just read this in
[1:28:25] Hebrews uh uh 5 and and uh uh
[1:28:31] 14 he says he
[1:28:34] says he in 13 He says for everyone that
[1:28:39] useth milk is
[1:28:42] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:28:45] for he's a babe that's right right but
[1:28:48] what this is where we're wanting to go
[1:28:51] but strong meat belongeth to them
[1:28:54] that are full of
[1:28:56] age right even those who by reason of
[1:29:02] the use have their senses exercised to
[1:29:06] discern both good and evil for by the
[1:29:10] reason of
[1:29:12] use have their
[1:29:15] senses
[1:29:17] exercised so did you did were you able
[1:29:20] to find that spot
[1:29:24] so you you've got it right where so uh I
[1:29:28] didn't hear then wait till I get my book
[1:29:31] back so I can U make sure that uh it it
[1:29:36] follows along I I'm still blind in one
[1:29:40] eye so you're going to have to bear with
[1:29:42] me for a
[1:29:46] while it the paragraphs line up with
[1:29:48] David okay they line up I did it's my
[1:29:51] fault then all right so uh this is what
[1:29:55] I wanted to make sure I want to get this
[1:29:57] now the church has got to lift itself up
[1:30:00] in the power of God we are too close to
[1:30:03] the end now I believe the church is in
[1:30:07] condition where we can teach it little
[1:30:10] deeper things and rub some of this make
[1:30:14] believe out and get in get into
[1:30:18] something
[1:30:19] real and and so uh we wanted uh we
[1:30:24] definitely wanted to to uh lay that in
[1:30:28] there and then this is another quote
[1:30:31] right before we'll just pick right back
[1:30:32] up where they were you guys bear with me
[1:30:35] he says now faith is based on
[1:30:37] forgiveness and then as we said this
[1:30:40] morning trying to get the church into
[1:30:42] the place to where we could really see
[1:30:46] Apostolic times moving among us and
[1:30:50] that's what we all hunger and it's just
[1:30:54] Ling right at the door we see it but we
[1:30:58] want to see more of it we want it to to
[1:31:04] we want it such a
[1:31:08] flow that it will help it'll be a help
[1:31:12] to us and flow out to
[1:31:18] others okay so yeah you forgive me for
[1:31:21] the interruption the Lord forgive me
[1:31:24] uh for the interruption and but I never
[1:31:27] want to interrupt the prophet so uh
[1:31:29] thank you brother it's my fault God
[1:31:31] bless
[1:31:38] you I want you to get this out we the
[1:31:42] church has got to lift itself in the
[1:31:45] power of God how we're too close to the
[1:31:48] end now and I believe the church is in
[1:31:51] condition where we can teach it a little
[1:31:53] te things and rub some of this make
[1:31:56] belief out see you get into something
[1:31:59] real see it's got to be something that
[1:32:02] you
[1:32:04] know if you say um uh brother brandom uh
[1:32:09] that isn't a light yet I know it's a
[1:32:13] light how do you know it's a light I'm
[1:32:16] looking at it well how you know you
[1:32:18] could be wrong my sight has always
[1:32:21] declared to me that that was life he
[1:32:24] and that's the reason I believe those
[1:32:25] Visions because it's always declared to
[1:32:28] me the truth B it comes from the word
[1:32:30] amen then if he says it that settles it
[1:32:34] now when it's declared like that there's
[1:32:36] no more guess where it's going to be
[1:32:39] then you hear it thus sayth the LA see
[1:32:42] because it's it's beyond the human
[1:32:44] thinking it's up into the Realms of the
[1:32:46] Lord's thinking but you're standing here
[1:32:49] just as a Vine just as a branch
[1:32:52] producing the fruit that in the vine see
[1:32:55] God uses man and man only God doesn't
[1:32:58] use Machinery God doesn't use groups of
[1:33:00] man God doesn't use organization God
[1:33:03] uses
[1:33:04] individuals
[1:33:06] always now Faith is the substance and by
[1:33:10] it we understand all those things to
[1:33:12] done it's not a it's not a imagination
[1:33:16] it is a substance a especially perfect
[1:33:19] Faith that's what I'm talking on tonight
[1:33:21] getting to perfect faith
[1:33:24] it is not an imagination now other just
[1:33:27] people come say oh I got all Faith oh I
[1:33:29] sure have well you stand here for see
[1:33:33] see your your very actions prove that
[1:33:36] you haven't got what you're talking
[1:33:37] about see if you had Faith then what you
[1:33:40] stand the prayer line for see what do
[1:33:43] you do these things for see if you had
[1:33:46] perfect Faith you look right straight to
[1:33:48] God and believe it and walk away you
[1:33:50] would you would have no need of coming
[1:33:52] into a prayer life you'd have no need of
[1:33:55] these things because your faith is done
[1:33:57] made it
[1:33:58] Soul see what would be the use for me
[1:34:02] saying I got to put a shirt
[1:34:04] on I got a shirt on how do you know you
[1:34:07] got a shirt on or I see it feel it and I
[1:34:11] know it's that well that's just how real
[1:34:14] that when perfect Faith takes a hold
[1:34:17] there go you don't need no more praise
[1:34:19] God already done you know it hallelujah
[1:34:22] how do you know it Faith tells me Soul
[1:34:24] amen that's it see do you get it now
[1:34:27] what I mean that's perfect Faith now
[1:34:30] other words I'm venturing out well I'll
[1:34:33] go the Bible say call the Elders let
[1:34:34] them know pray over I know I'll go and
[1:34:37] and you said well I'm going to be he see
[1:34:39] you're making yourself don't watch how
[1:34:41] you go to make yourself just just worked
[1:34:43] out then when he pass you you say oh I I
[1:34:46] still don't feel see there you was you
[1:34:49] didn't have faith your genuine faith
[1:34:52] will do it right there your your genu
[1:34:55] faith will make it so real to you that
[1:34:58] look at that little woman with the blood
[1:34:59] issue she said if I can only touch the
[1:35:02] border of His Garment I'll be made well
[1:35:04] and as soon as she did it she said she
[1:35:07] felt within herself that her blood
[1:35:09] issues
[1:35:11] stop she actually believed it and when
[1:35:15] she touched it to prove that stop stop
[1:35:19] Jesus turned and said who touched
[1:35:22] me that's perfect faith and that same
[1:35:26] perfect Faith tonight will touch Jesus
[1:35:28] Christ just as it did then the woman
[1:35:31] come with a perfect faith for that time
[1:35:35] now now we see at first the disciples
[1:35:40] didn't have this perfect Faith they
[1:35:42] didn't have it because they had Christ
[1:35:46] walking with him but then afterward
[1:35:49] Christ was in that amen and so you see
[1:35:52] it's hard then I have this perfect faith
[1:35:56] without the Holy Spirit it has to bring
[1:36:00] it it does now you say the disciples
[1:36:03] didn't have perfect Faith No or they had
[1:36:05] an epileptic child there that they were
[1:36:08] trying to cast this devil out of him and
[1:36:10] they couldn't do it and the father seen
[1:36:13] Jesus coming and he said we have brought
[1:36:15] my son to to your disciples and they
[1:36:19] could not cure him see and afterwards
[1:36:24] the disciples asked Jesus saying why
[1:36:27] could not we cure him and Jesus said
[1:36:30] because of the lack of faith am of your
[1:36:34] unbelief that's right because of your
[1:36:37] unbelief that's I remember they had the
[1:36:41] power Jesus had given them power to heal
[1:36:45] the sick to raise the dead and cast out
[1:36:47] Devils just a few days before that yeah
[1:36:50] they had the
[1:36:51] power but not the Fai to use the power
[1:36:56] now there's the Brandon Tabernacle
[1:36:58] there's the church the bride today the
[1:37:01] holy spirit is here with the power amen
[1:37:04] but you haven't got that Faith to mve it
[1:37:08] amen see what I mean
[1:37:11] amen amen it takes Faith to move it here
[1:37:16] I got a shell that I hand loaded I know
[1:37:19] what it you by Ballistic like the word
[1:37:22] but I've got to fire the gun the fire
[1:37:25] has to get to the powder the powder's
[1:37:28] got the power but got to have the fire
[1:37:29] to light it off and the same thing that
[1:37:32] pow is in the
[1:37:34] Shell but it needs ba to charge it and
[1:37:38] throw it
[1:37:40] out that's what it takes see perfect
[1:37:44] Faith to ignite the power of the Holy
[1:37:47] Spirit which we have now since he's come
[1:37:49] upon us amen Faith to ignite the seed
[1:37:53] great things is to the faith something
[1:37:57] that presents it to you with a heart
[1:38:00] full of joy you walk into the sick room
[1:38:02] knowing exactly what you're going to say
[1:38:05] walk in there and know what's going to
[1:38:06] happen something's already been revealed
[1:38:08] and you know it you walk in in the name
[1:38:11] of Jesus Christ rise up from there just
[1:38:14] say the Lord there you are that's
[1:38:17] perfect Fai if there' be 10 million
[1:38:20] people standing there say it wouldn't
[1:38:21] happen you know it's going to Happ many
[1:38:23] because you know it it's going to happen
[1:38:27] regardless what anybody else says you're
[1:38:28] the one got the
[1:38:30] faith good you imagine
[1:38:32] Joshua he called the Elders of Israel
[1:38:35] together and said uh brethren we are the
[1:38:39] Servants of the Lord I would like for
[1:38:41] you to say ask the Lord if to be all
[1:38:43] right if uh if he give us a little more
[1:38:46] sunlight see and hold a son a little
[1:38:49] while no he had need of it without
[1:38:53] prayer without anything he had need of
[1:38:56] it and he just commanded the
[1:38:59] son he said stand
[1:39:02] there I have need and I'm in the service
[1:39:06] of the Lord and he sent me over here to
[1:39:09] do this job and I'm doing the best I
[1:39:12] don't know how the enemy is routed and
[1:39:14] they're out in here if I let if sun goes
[1:39:16] down they'll get together and cause me
[1:39:18] more trouble so stand
[1:39:20] still as soon you hang there amen he man
[1:39:24] she hung there for 24
[1:39:28] hoursall now if the world's turning it
[1:39:30] holds it up and the sun stay in the
[1:39:32] place and it don't run what happened
[1:39:34] then amen that's right now you make
[1:39:37] yourself an
[1:39:38] Infidel if you say this and then if you
[1:39:41] don't you show do fo of science cuz they
[1:39:43] say the world stop and drop now what if
[1:39:47] you say God's word's not right then
[1:39:48] you're
[1:39:50] inent but it happened that's the main
[1:39:53] thing
[1:39:53] I don't know the mechanics of it but it
[1:39:56] happened I don't know the mechanics of
[1:39:58] the Holy Ghost but I know it fell on me
[1:40:01] I can't tell the mechanics of it but I
[1:40:02] know the blessings of it that's all I
[1:40:05] care to know about is the blessings of
[1:40:07] the Holy Ghost and mechanics Hew say
[1:40:10] that's his secret this boy cannot be
[1:40:12] healed because the disciples had power
[1:40:15] Jesus gave them power to heal all manner
[1:40:17] of sickness to cast out Devils to
[1:40:20] cleanse the lepers and to raise the dead
[1:40:22] yes amen he gave them power but they
[1:40:26] didn't have faith to operate the power
[1:40:28] that they had and then they questioned
[1:40:30] Jesus and said well now why couldn't we
[1:40:32] do it now remember they had the
[1:40:36] word and the Word was flesh thing and
[1:40:40] the word told them I give you power
[1:40:43] amen
[1:40:46] amen I give you power and they had the
[1:40:50] power but they didn't have faith to
[1:40:52] operate the word that was in that amen
[1:40:56] see what I mean yeah
[1:40:58] but Jesus had
[1:41:01] it he was the word and he had faith that
[1:41:04] what he said would happen amen said oh
[1:41:08] bring in
[1:41:09] here how long will I suffer
[1:41:13] yet he had Faith with his power how did
[1:41:18] he he said I can do nothing in
[1:41:22] myself why he relied
[1:41:25] upon what he was he relied in knowing
[1:41:29] that he was the word and he had faith in
[1:41:33] God who made him the word he was God the
[1:41:38] word and it was in him that giving Faith
[1:41:41] because he understood his
[1:41:43] position he known what he was because
[1:41:46] the scripture had said he was it and
[1:41:49] you're every scripture Tien to prove
[1:41:51] that he was exactly what the script
[1:41:53] scure said he would be and he knew what
[1:41:56] he was therefore he relied upon what God
[1:42:01] had made him amen and if he did that
[1:42:05] then can't we rely upon what God made us
[1:42:08] as
[1:42:09] Believers these signs shall follow them
[1:42:12] that believe Hallelujah he had faith and
[1:42:17] what he was and if you are a Believer
[1:42:20] you have faith in what you are you are
[1:42:23] believer and if you got faith in God the
[1:42:26] Bible says over here and if our U if our
[1:42:31] hearts condemn us then we can't have
[1:42:33] faith but if our hearts don't condemn us
[1:42:36] then we have faith we have confidence
[1:42:39] towards God if you want to read that
[1:42:41] found St John 3:21 I got the scripture
[1:42:43] written down there now
[1:42:45] notice St I mean 1 John 3:21 uh notice
[1:42:50] if our hearts condemn us not then we
[1:42:52] have confidence towards God but as long
[1:42:55] as you're doing things that's wrong you
[1:42:57] can't have confidence towards God so you
[1:43:00] see you can you automatically know that
[1:43:02] you're wrong you automatically put
[1:43:05] yourself back here a sinner by knowing
[1:43:08] that you're wrong but when your heart
[1:43:10] don't condemn you and you know you are a
[1:43:12] Believer and there's nothing between you
[1:43:15] and God you can ask what you will and
[1:43:17] know that it'll be given amen because
[1:43:20] it's the word that's given to you just
[1:43:22] like it was to those dis time now the
[1:43:23] only thing you have to do then is have
[1:43:26] faith in what you
[1:43:28] are amen have faith in what the word
[1:43:31] says you are and Jesus had faith in the
[1:43:33] word of God that said what he was it is
[1:43:36] written of me didn't David in the Psalms
[1:43:39] and the prophets and all of them speak
[1:43:41] of him I am the bread of life that come
[1:43:43] from God out of Heaven amen I am the
[1:43:47] Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I
[1:43:50] am all these things I am that I am
[1:43:53] and he knew with that perfect faith that
[1:43:56] he was the anointed Messiah that the
[1:43:59] spirit of God was upon on him he said
[1:44:01] now I myself do nothing but it's my
[1:44:04] faith in God and God was in him the word
[1:44:07] made manifest and when the word of God
[1:44:09] comes in you it's made manifest or you
[1:44:12] are a Believer see and a Believer is the
[1:44:16] faith of God that moves in you you like
[1:44:19] that am I like when you I like teaching
[1:44:22] before the how to what faith really is
[1:44:26] knowing who he was without a shadow of
[1:44:29] doubt he knew he was the son of God he
[1:44:33] knew
[1:44:34] it for the word
[1:44:37] identifi the word of God identified who
[1:44:40] he was he said if I do not the works of
[1:44:44] my father then don't believe me but if
[1:44:46] if I don't do them Works don't believe
[1:44:48] me but if I do then believe the works
[1:44:51] for they are the Manifest word
[1:44:54] promise or if you can just wake up to
[1:44:56] that a
[1:44:57] minute you see the word itself identify
[1:45:02] who you are and he said who can condemn
[1:45:05] me of sin in other words who can show me
[1:45:09] that my life and my Works don't fulfill
[1:45:12] exactly what Messiah should
[1:45:14] do nobody can say nothing for he was and
[1:45:19] he had Faith to believe that whatever he
[1:45:21] said it would happen then he turned
[1:45:23] around and said the works that I do
[1:45:24] shall you also a little while the world
[1:45:27] seeth no more yet you shall because I'll
[1:45:29] be with you even in you take no thought
[1:45:32] what you shall say for it's not you to
[1:45:34] speak it's that father that dwelleth in
[1:45:36] you he's one does the speaking and it's
[1:45:38] not me it's the father that dwelleth in
[1:45:40] me he doth the
[1:45:42] work see what I mean now the
[1:45:46] identification of a scripture Christian
[1:45:49] these words said Jesus these sign shall
[1:45:53] follow them that
[1:45:55] believe now how can you call yourself a
[1:45:57] believer of people and deny those words
[1:46:01] am how can you call yourself a Believer
[1:46:04] and deny any of this
[1:46:06] world you can't do it you're not a
[1:46:09] Believer therefore SS can't follow
[1:46:12] because you just accept what you want to
[1:46:14] believe and let the rest of it you want
[1:46:15] don't believe it but you got to take the
[1:46:18] whole thing and believe that's amen and
[1:46:20] when you truly believe not make believe
[1:46:22] but really believe then these signs
[1:46:23] follow them that believe oh could you
[1:46:26] compare Christians today with them
[1:46:28] Christians of Longo how them disci
[1:46:31] walked in the power of the spirit moved
[1:46:33] by the Holy Ghost to go just a prisoner
[1:46:35] as I preached on the other night a
[1:46:37] prisoner to the word and will of God he
[1:46:39] couldn't even move until God moved would
[1:46:42] you like to see a church rise like
[1:46:45] that it's going
[1:46:49] to it's got to come not trying it's it's
[1:46:52] on this road now I believe for the word
[1:46:56] identified identified himself what he
[1:46:59] was and the same word identifies us see
[1:47:04] if a man loves me he keeps my
[1:47:07] Commandments and if he says he loves me
[1:47:09] keeps not my Commandments that's all of
[1:47:11] them he's a liar the truth not even any
[1:47:15] you say well I don't believe well then
[1:47:17] that you're just not a Believer that's
[1:47:18] all if the Bible said so that makes it
[1:47:21] right amen
[1:47:23] Eternal what the Bible says is the truth
[1:47:30] no did you all digest all that and
[1:47:33] believe every word of it well then go in
[1:47:36] the
[1:47:39] Rapture that's pretty good okay simple
[1:47:44] that we just just this is what he
[1:47:48] said and he said he said oh could you
[1:47:51] compare a Christian today day with them
[1:47:54] Christians of long
[1:47:56] ago right and what are we to be returned
[1:47:59] back to the Faith of Our Father the
[1:48:04] confidence Jesus told them you have not
[1:48:07] chosen me I have chosen you they had
[1:48:11] confidence in that Silver and Gold Have
[1:48:15] I None but that which I have I give to
[1:48:18] you they have confidence in that they
[1:48:23] accepted their position they accepted
[1:48:28] who that they were and they accepted
[1:48:32] what that he had done for them it wasn't
[1:48:38] based on any of themselves is that was
[1:48:42] based on what he said and and then he
[1:48:45] just so this is where we're headed he
[1:48:48] says Longo how them disciples walked in
[1:48:53] the power of the spirit moved by the
[1:48:57] Holy Spirit to do it just a prisoner as
[1:49:02] I preached the other night a prisoner to
[1:49:05] the word and the will of God he couldn't
[1:49:09] even
[1:49:11] move until God moved him wouldn't you
[1:49:16] like to see a church rise like that
[1:49:22] amen wouldn't you like to see a church
[1:49:26] rise like that I
[1:49:31] would you know all of us start applying
[1:49:34] the token to our homes all of us
[1:49:38] starting apply the token all of us up
[1:49:41] get up in the morning and start our
[1:49:43] there with prayer all of us reading our
[1:49:46] Bible making Melody to hymns and songs
[1:49:50] in our heart you you know what I mean
[1:49:53] letting the joy of the Lord fill our
[1:49:57] lives you say wait a minute you know it
[1:50:01] it just seems anymore that our our
[1:50:05] gospels become so negative it's all
[1:50:07] about
[1:50:09] struggle we don't care about struggle
[1:50:12] we're
[1:50:14] Overcomers it's given to him that over
[1:50:17] comes let the struggles come right we've
[1:50:21] got the strugg Le
[1:50:25] solver you know think it not strange at
[1:50:29] the fiery darts of the enemy think is
[1:50:32] not strange when since when did we get
[1:50:34] to the place
[1:50:36] that we need the bed of ease to be our
[1:50:43] Vindication Samson he he all of a sudden
[1:50:48] a thousand
[1:50:49] Philistines show up oh the Phil are upon
[1:50:55] you he just grabbed whatever he could
[1:50:57] get a hand on right and believed God and
[1:51:02] went to slay in
[1:51:07] Philistines and when one of those
[1:51:09] Philistines shows up in your life step
[1:51:12] back and say you Philistine I had a
[1:51:16] brother that knocked one of you out you
[1:51:19] old Goliath I had a brother that knocked
[1:51:22] one of you out I am a part of the word
[1:51:25] of God I am the Church of the Living God
[1:51:29] I've been called of this hour to knock
[1:51:32] you
[1:51:37] out well Satan knew that he had a long
[1:51:40] range plan the prophet of God said Satan
[1:51:42] had a long range plan on you he threw
[1:51:45] his hooks in you maybe when you were a
[1:51:47] child got an addiction on you got a
[1:51:51] complex on you got a temper on you got
[1:51:55] to mess with your
[1:51:58] brain well you know people that don't
[1:52:01] have what we have go to psychologist
[1:52:05] they go to
[1:52:06] psychiatrist they go to the medicine
[1:52:08] cabinet they do everything that they can
[1:52:12] and I say do
[1:52:15] it but if you ever come to the
[1:52:19] place and you're laying on that couch
[1:52:23] and all of a sudden it Dons on you wait
[1:52:25] a minute that's a
[1:52:33] devil and I'm a Son of
[1:52:38] God and in my father's house are many
[1:52:41] mansions I'm going to get out of this
[1:52:44] couch even a servant in My Father's
[1:52:46] House lives better I'm not going to be
[1:52:49] under this no more I'm going to go to my
[1:52:51] father
[1:52:53] and I may say father will you receive me
[1:52:56] and what did he do he restored him back
[1:52:58] as a son with full power and authority
[1:53:02] and a
[1:53:07] robe this is what he
[1:53:09] said wouldn't you like to have a church
[1:53:12] rise up like that it's going
[1:53:15] to going back it's got to
[1:53:20] come is that right
[1:53:22] it's on the road
[1:53:26] now well it might have taken us 20 years
[1:53:29] to get
[1:53:32] here because we've tried
[1:53:35] everything to produce
[1:53:38] it instead of letting it
[1:53:41] happen and his
[1:53:44] time in his season by his word We've ran
[1:53:49] after this movement We've ran after this
[1:53:51] movement
[1:53:53] we've tried to call down this anointing
[1:53:56] and we've tried to call that down
[1:53:57] anointing we've tried to produce we
[1:53:59] tried to produce we tried to produce but
[1:54:02] the Sheep Bears
[1:54:08] wool so they had the
[1:54:12] power right so we understood that they
[1:54:17] they had the power but they didn't have
[1:54:20] the faith to use the
[1:54:24] power you think that we have the
[1:54:29] power let just talk about power for just
[1:54:32] a second there's a lot of definitions of
[1:54:36] power but one of the definitions
[1:54:40] that
[1:54:42] that I like let me see if I can find it
[1:54:45] right here
[1:54:46] quickly power is the cap capacity
[1:54:52] or ability to
[1:54:56] directly influence the behavior of
[1:55:00] others and the course of
[1:55:05] events that's what power is power has
[1:55:09] the ability to
[1:55:12] affect the course of
[1:55:14] events power has the ability to affect
[1:55:19] the behavior of others when that
[1:55:22] epileptic came up to Jesus and and was
[1:55:26] casting his uh self in the fire when the
[1:55:30] demons came up when leprosy came up the
[1:55:34] he had the
[1:55:36] power to change the course of that
[1:55:43] event or the he had the capability of
[1:55:49] influence the behavior of the
[1:55:54] person now just think of
[1:55:57] that power apart from character is
[1:56:04] satanic right but Power with
[1:56:08] character real power with character
[1:56:11] really to affect someone's life or the
[1:56:15] course of events for the right purpose
[1:56:23] by exercise of
[1:56:25] discernment knowing the difference
[1:56:28] become of Good and Evil by reason of
[1:56:33] exercise that you can
[1:56:36] actually know that you can have an
[1:56:39] effect on a person's
[1:56:46] life now that's the kind of Faith he's
[1:56:49] talking about
[1:56:55] Faith
[1:56:57] Masters every
[1:57:04] circumstance it Masters the
[1:57:06] circumstance it doesn't matter what the
[1:57:09] circumstance
[1:57:11] is
[1:57:14] Faith activates the
[1:57:17] power to change the course of events
[1:57:26] amen that's what it is now he's you say
[1:57:30] well he said individual it is
[1:57:32] individuals it's you have got
[1:57:35] to have your faith your power you've got
[1:57:40] to to to possess
[1:57:44] it and then you take what you are and
[1:57:49] the Holy Spirit fits and joins you to
[1:57:52] together with other believers of like
[1:57:57] Faith because if two or three of you
[1:58:00] agree on any one thing it'll come to
[1:58:05] pass so now it becomes it becomes the
[1:58:09] the the
[1:58:11] recognition that you've got the
[1:58:14] power well it's a whole lot of
[1:58:17] difference if you don't know you've got
[1:58:19] the power first of all you've got to to
[1:58:22] know you've got the power before you can
[1:58:25] find the faith to use it you can't have
[1:58:28] faith to try to move something you don't
[1:58:31] believe you
[1:58:37] have I don't care what it is see the
[1:58:40] first thing that Satan does he says
[1:58:42] power is is all you know all things are
[1:58:46] possible right so the first thing we
[1:58:49] think is sickness
[1:58:54] demon right we don't think about daily
[1:58:57] circumstances in our
[1:58:59] lives we don't think about the
[1:59:03] ability the the power to master Mass
[1:59:08] Master every
[1:59:10] circumstance to be aware of
[1:59:13] it just to be aware of it
[1:59:17] right to be aware oh this person I'm
[1:59:19] going to go visit this person and you
[1:59:21] know maybe you got an interview man this
[1:59:23] guy's a he's a real Hornet's
[1:59:26] Nest praise God you're aware right
[1:59:31] right what do you know about hornets
[1:59:34] nests you don't poke the Hornets
[1:59:40] Nest let them Buzz around thank you Lord
[1:59:44] be still thank you Lord know that I'm
[1:59:48] God right you're in control that's right
[1:59:51] God's with
[1:59:53] me I don't have to compromise I don't
[1:59:56] have to change if God wants me to have
[1:59:59] this job I'll get this
[2:00:02] job if it's my heart's desire the Lord
[2:00:06] said he'd give me my heart's desire
[2:00:08] that's right all these other things you
[2:00:11] master the
[2:00:17] circumstance but you've got to know that
[2:00:19] you've got the power to do
[2:00:25] that Jesus knew he had the
[2:00:29] power but do we know that we have the
[2:00:34] power I'll just read some quick
[2:00:36] scriptures here to you and these are uh
[2:00:42] just to let you understand that the
[2:00:46] disciples and and our fathers before us
[2:00:50] they believed Timothy said for the God
[2:00:53] hath not given us the spirit of fear but
[2:00:56] of power and of love and of a sound
[2:01:03] mind that that's our
[2:01:08] description he said but he said acts 1
[2:01:11] and8 but you shall receive power after
[2:01:13] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[2:01:16] and you shall be Witnesses unto me both
[2:01:19] in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samar
[2:01:22] and the utmost parts of the
[2:01:25] earth Philippians 4:13 I can do all
[2:01:29] things through Christ Jesus who
[2:01:31] strengthens
[2:01:32] me not we don't even do the little
[2:01:38] things we've got so bigm
[2:01:42] minded and so
[2:01:45] spectacular that we don't even let faith
[2:01:48] and power work
[2:01:52] in our daily
[2:01:54] life we should be living by the power of
[2:02:00] God we live by
[2:02:03] faith we live by trust we live by what
[2:02:09] every word of God that proceedeth out of
[2:02:12] his mouth that's what we live
[2:02:15] by we we're not called to be afraid of
[2:02:18] the paycheck we're not called to be
[2:02:21] afraid afraid of the society we're not
[2:02:24] called to be afraid of the
[2:02:29] government we're called to believe yes
[2:02:32] sir in fact even above that we've been
[2:02:36] chosen to believe faith is our
[2:02:41] inheritance we're joint hires with
[2:02:47] him but we just just for a little bit
[2:02:51] this morning morning we'll close
[2:02:57] quickly so he he goes on to say here he
[2:03:02] says I can do all things through Christ
[2:03:04] Jesus who strengthened me enemy and
[2:03:07] nothing shall
[2:03:09] be any means hurt
[2:03:12] you nothing by any means will hurt
[2:03:17] you oh my goodness can you actually
[2:03:21] think all of a sudden you all the camps
[2:03:24] of there's chariots and kings and armies
[2:03:28] all around you and you look up and say
[2:03:31] oh Master what are we going to
[2:03:37] do open his eyes Lord open this boy's
[2:03:44] eyes there's more with
[2:03:47] us than is with
[2:03:49] them Glory
[2:03:53] amen and the boy's eyes get open and
[2:03:56] there's Chariots of Fire everywhere well
[2:03:59] I know if he would have been like me I'd
[2:04:01] have sat back and wait for the
[2:04:05] battle right but God works in what
[2:04:09] mysterious ways they just walked right
[2:04:13] through them
[2:04:18] unrecognized
[2:04:20] see faith
[2:04:22] just walks it
[2:04:27] believes the these
[2:04:30] things it's it's all about you he died
[2:04:34] for you it's about you being his son and
[2:04:38] his daughter it's why the prophet again
[2:04:41] says you know someone asked me what the
[2:04:43] other day says did I offend you and I I
[2:04:46] just simply say if you offended me you
[2:04:49] know it
[2:04:53] I don't have to know
[2:04:56] it for it to be off
[2:05:00] fence we don't we don't if I stole from
[2:05:04] you and you never found
[2:05:07] out right did I still
[2:05:14] steal if I never miss
[2:05:18] it well I guess he didn't miss it I
[2:05:21] guess it's mine
[2:05:25] no you you know if you do wrong he said
[2:05:29] you know if you've done wrong and you
[2:05:32] know if you've done wrong you can't have
[2:05:34] confidence well aren't you glad that he
[2:05:37] gave us away confess your sins go to the
[2:05:42] Lord cry ABA father and he confess your
[2:05:46] sins and he'll be what faithful and just
[2:05:50] to forgive them right there's no
[2:05:55] need burying something when there's
[2:05:59] something to fix
[2:06:04] it I I I remember having a a problem I
[2:06:07] just I couldn't figure out what it was
[2:06:10] so I I went to the doctor and the doctor
[2:06:12] noticed
[2:06:14] something oh you've got this little
[2:06:16] thing here I said oh and they said here
[2:06:20] put this
[2:06:22] and it fixed
[2:06:24] it you know I just thought how long did
[2:06:28] I deal with that not understanding what
[2:06:32] an easy fix it
[2:06:36] was why bear the
[2:06:39] conviction why bear the
[2:06:41] shame why don't you just go to the
[2:06:45] altar because God has a chosen place of
[2:06:48] worship it's under the shed blood make
[2:06:52] it
[2:06:53] right healing is based on
[2:06:59] forgiveness if someone offends you if
[2:07:01] your spouse offend you if your husband
[2:07:03] offend you if you've done wrong in your
[2:07:05] life you've done wrong in your marriage
[2:07:07] get together
[2:07:09] repent forgive one
[2:07:15] another because healing is based on
[2:07:19] forgiveness faith
[2:07:22] is based on
[2:07:24] forgiveness you can't have faith until
[2:07:28] you're
[2:07:29] convinced that he's forgiven
[2:07:34] you and he died for
[2:07:37] you not that he died for
[2:07:43] sin I'm sorry
[2:07:47] Jesus died for me amen
[2:07:53] amen well I was yet a
[2:07:58] sinner wait a minute I wasn't even born
[2:08:00] yet but while I was yet a sinner why he
[2:08:04] knew what I was he knew where I had been
[2:08:07] he knew what I would do he knows my
[2:08:09] weakness he still knows my weaknesses
[2:08:12] but praise
[2:08:15] God he who is in me is
[2:08:19] greater I can't
[2:08:24] overcome I've been chosen to overcome
[2:08:27] I've been elected to
[2:08:29] overcome I am a what Overcomer who's it
[2:08:34] given in this age to the Overcomer I
[2:08:36] will grant to him to sit with me in my
[2:08:39] father's house to sit with me in my
[2:08:41] table and we'll Su
[2:08:44] together you've got an
[2:08:47] Avenue to make it right
[2:08:50] power first Corinthians 4:20 for the
[2:08:53] kingdom of God is not in word but in
[2:08:57] power the kingdom of God is the ability
[2:09:01] to
[2:09:02] affect the course of
[2:09:05] events and the lives of those around
[2:09:10] us that's what he raised the church up
[2:09:15] for go into all the world and get these
[2:09:19] Devils yes sir off of my
[2:09:25] children go into all the world and let
[2:09:27] them know that they that by my Stripes
[2:09:32] They're
[2:09:33] healed and those that
[2:09:36] believe shall be
[2:09:44] saved I don't ask God in the morning
[2:09:46] Lord give me a list of who I should
[2:09:48] witness to today because I don't want to
[2:09:50] have no failures
[2:09:52] H go into all the
[2:09:55] world preach the gospel to every
[2:10:04] creature and those that
[2:10:06] believe shall be
[2:10:09] saved I have the power to do that
[2:10:13] yes prophet of God said in that day at
[2:10:16] Calvary the church has the power to
[2:10:19] impart eternal
[2:10:25] Life religion and
[2:10:29] denominations has taught God's people
[2:10:32] throw it on
[2:10:35] him throw it on if he wants it done
[2:10:38] he'll do
[2:10:42] it no let this mind be in you that was
[2:10:48] in Christ Jesus
[2:10:53] that you thinking not of yourself but of
[2:10:55] the well-being of the person that's why
[2:10:59] the church is motivated by love and love
[2:11:04] and faith work together so in other
[2:11:07] words we say I want to have faith but
[2:11:10] what I want to have faith but Faith
[2:11:14] activates the
[2:11:18] power so do I have the power
[2:11:22] power once I come to the established
[2:11:28] fact that the word of God has given the
[2:11:33] believer the
[2:11:36] power they have the C
[2:11:40] capacity and the
[2:11:43] ability to make a
[2:11:46] difference in people's
[2:11:49] lives to change the
[2:11:51] atmosphere to change the attitude and to
[2:11:55] change the outcome prophet of God says
[2:11:58] these things in C I went into the house
[2:12:00] and the wife was all upset and I said
[2:12:02] honey sit down I'll do the dishes change
[2:12:05] the what whole
[2:12:08] atmosphere and thus change the course of
[2:12:16] events no need getting upset yeah
[2:12:21] I I'm Irish it's real easy for me to get
[2:12:24] upset and
[2:12:26] frustrated I find out though if I bite
[2:12:29] my
[2:12:30] tongue things turn out
[2:12:32] better now my tongue's been awful sore
[2:12:39] lately but you know wisdom is a better
[2:12:41] part of
[2:12:45] valor it's
[2:12:50] that and God hath both raised up the
[2:12:53] Lord and will also raise us by his own
[2:12:59] power finally my Maran be strong in the
[2:13:02] Lord and in the power of His
[2:13:07] might and he said unto me my grace is
[2:13:10] sufficient for thee my strength is made
[2:13:13] perfect in weakness most gladly
[2:13:16] therefore I would rather glory in my
[2:13:19] infirmities that the power power of
[2:13:22] Christ might rest upon
[2:13:28] me this power is
[2:13:31] yours Jesus identified himself where in
[2:13:36] the
[2:13:37] word is that right he read the
[2:13:40] scriptures and said that's me the little
[2:13:44] boy looked in the mirror and he said
[2:13:46] Mama that's me are you looking in the
[2:13:50] scriptures this
[2:13:53] morning and saying that's me or is there
[2:13:57] a
[2:13:59] question now the only question we heard
[2:14:02] the prophet raise up is
[2:14:05] that you're either doing something wrong
[2:14:09] you've done something wrong and it's
[2:14:12] become a block to
[2:14:18] you but he said
[2:14:22] if you'll confess your faults that's
[2:14:25] right he'll be just and faithful to
[2:14:30] forgive you don't want to go create a
[2:14:33] fake
[2:14:36] religion I know churches where the
[2:14:39] pastor's been divorced and remarried and
[2:14:43] his congregation is
[2:14:45] full of people who are divorced and
[2:14:48] remarried and if a person go in one
[2:14:51] church if they get divorced and
[2:14:53] remarried where do you think they go
[2:14:56] they move up right there you don't have
[2:14:59] to live like that right right you read
[2:15:02] marriage and divorce we made mistakes
[2:15:05] Lord I made a mistake it's all over I'm
[2:15:07] never going to do it
[2:15:10] again and go
[2:15:14] on live like a Christian live a
[2:15:17] Christian Life don't live in the past
[2:15:21] have
[2:15:26] faith in other words faith comes from
[2:15:28] one place and one place alone and that's
[2:15:32] the word of God that's the only place
[2:15:35] that faith comes from if there's no
[2:15:38] other place that faith comes from I just
[2:15:40] want to read it to you real quick just
[2:15:44] as just to lay it down is he
[2:15:48] says he says
[2:15:51] and it comes to you by hearing the word
[2:15:55] of God and that alone Faith cometh by
[2:16:00] hearing the word of God and that alone
[2:16:05] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[2:16:10] word of God that puts it back to where
[2:16:14] your faith then is not in some
[2:16:17] individual it's not in a man who is that
[2:16:21] individual you who is the man you it's
[2:16:26] not in an organization it's not in a
[2:16:28] group of people it's in God because God
[2:16:31] is the word and your faith is in God
[2:16:36] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[2:16:38] the word the only place you're going to
[2:16:41] get Faith is by listening to what that
[2:16:44] word
[2:16:47] says that's it
[2:16:55] power Ephesians
[2:16:59] 3:20 now unto him that is able to do
[2:17:04] exceedingly and
[2:17:07] abundantly above all that we ask or
[2:17:10] think according to the power that
[2:17:16] worketh where
[2:17:22] he's going to do all these things but
[2:17:25] he's got an
[2:17:28] accordance how is he going to do
[2:17:33] it we we've oh forgive me and then you
[2:17:38] can all go home and pray for me that I
[2:17:39] get my mind
[2:17:42] back all this time we've
[2:17:47] been well he'll do it he'll do it I'm
[2:17:51] going to wait here till he does it till
[2:17:53] he does it wait a
[2:17:55] minute that's not what we just heard we
[2:17:59] heard
[2:18:00] that now it was in
[2:18:06] them now the spirit was in
[2:18:10] them now the power was in them he's
[2:18:15] going to do all things is that right
[2:18:23] he's going to do all things according to
[2:18:26] the power that worketh in us the power
[2:18:30] is there it's been given to us right we
[2:18:35] got to settle that
[2:18:38] right this can be
[2:18:42] accomplished this can be
[2:18:46] done now I need something to rise up in
[2:18:50] me
[2:18:51] that is going to make the power that's
[2:18:55] in me go to work and change the
[2:18:59] circumstance faith has got to have a
[2:19:02] resting place and the only place they
[2:19:05] get that faith is from the word and once
[2:19:08] it's the
[2:19:11] word it you now have the
[2:19:15] power but now you have the word
[2:19:20] that gives you the
[2:19:23] authority to
[2:19:25] activate the power remember the
[2:19:29] policeman he stands up in front of the
[2:19:34] car he can't stop that car raising his
[2:19:38] hand but he stops the car by what the
[2:19:43] power and authority that's been given
[2:19:47] him why do you cast out the devil by the
[2:19:51] power and authority that was given to
[2:19:54] you by the word of
[2:19:59] God he can't sit out in front of that
[2:20:02] car and said does my uniform
[2:20:06] fit is my badge on
[2:20:10] right you don't have
[2:20:16] time you got to it's got to be
[2:20:18] instantaneously

[2:20:25] life get out of
[2:20:27] here take your hand pray for
[2:20:33] somebody we've got the

[2:21:55] power of
[2:21:58] God okay read it more and more and
[2:22:04] more we've got the
[2:22:08] power now we've got to start lining the
[2:22:11] things up we've got to line our life up
[2:22:21] we've got to build our
[2:22:23] faith to activate the
[2:22:28] power I love this
[2:22:31] statement and I better invite the
[2:22:35] musicians because if I don't I won't
[2:22:47] stop he says
[2:22:50] and when the word of God comes to you it
[2:22:53] makes manifest you are a Believer and a
[2:22:58] Believer is the faith of God that moves
[2:23:03] in
[2:23:06] you the believer is the faith in
[2:23:11] God that moves in
[2:23:14] you do you believe God can do all
[2:23:18] things amen do you believe there's
[2:23:21] anything too
[2:23:23] hard sir for
[2:23:26] God do you understand what he's trying
[2:23:28] to say when you believe and you know
[2:23:31] it's the word of
[2:23:33] God that word activates the power that's
[2:23:39] in you you don't sit there like a bump
[2:23:43] on the log
[2:23:45] saying I'm not going to do a thing
[2:23:53] no faith
[2:23:56] acts if not you just become a hearer of
[2:24:00] a word and not a
[2:24:03] doer of the word you see it in the word
[2:24:07] of God you know that that Authority's
[2:24:10] been given to
[2:24:12] you because you've identified your life
[2:24:16] as a Believer like Jesus
[2:24:18] did the deciples finally realized that
[2:24:23] they were called they went to the upper
[2:24:26] room they had that
[2:24:28] experience they knew that was the word
[2:24:31] of God and they stepped out and said
[2:24:34] Silver and Gold Have I
[2:24:36] None but that which I
[2:24:39] have the power that he gave me the
[2:24:42] authority that he gave me I am going to
[2:24:47] exercise that power and authority
[2:24:50] because I'm
[2:24:53] confident that I am a son and daughter
[2:24:58] of
[2:25:01] God and I've been
[2:25:04] given the
[2:25:07] commission from the father to

[2:28:59] Believers right where they're at they've
[2:29:03] touched the Hem of His
[2:29:05] Garment that's what he said and to prove
[2:29:08] that he touched the Hem of His
[2:29:13] Garment he turned around and said who
[2:29:15] touched me how many times in the prayer
[2:29:19] line
[2:29:20] in the discernment did you see brother
[2:29:22] Braham said who did he
[2:29:26] touch who did she touch they had already
[2:29:31] activated the faith that God could
[2:29:37] confirm they had already been
[2:29:41] touched they already touched the thing
[2:29:44] and God called them out and let them
[2:29:46] know you've your named such and such you

[2:30:28] discernment to be the
[2:30:32] Believers we've got the word of God that
[2:30:36] discernment has led the church
[2:30:39] astray into following after all kinds of
[2:30:42] gifts all kinds of foolishness all kinds
[2:30:44] of stuff when all the
[2:30:47] time the kingdom
[2:30:50] is within
[2:30:53] you and your faith comes from the word
[2:30:56] of God and if you know he's a Healer
[2:30:59] this morning you can take Hebrews 138
[2:31:03] and you can say I believe
[2:31:07] that and that scripture is going to
[2:31:11] activate the power that's in
[2:31:17] me that I will be healed by by the power
[2:31:20] of His might that dwelleth in
[2:31:26] you that's the church that's the
