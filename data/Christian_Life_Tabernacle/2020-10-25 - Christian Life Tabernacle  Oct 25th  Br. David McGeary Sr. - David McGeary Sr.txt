he's the path that's all i [Music] amen our gracious heavenly father we certainly ask you to bless us this morning as we just fellowship around your word in the precious name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated thank you sarah for playing for us today sister sarah played for us today and uh we uh would just like to explain just a moment the reasons uh why that we've taken these last few services off a couple weeks ago it was brought to my attention that several people within the congregation were beginning to have flu-like symptoms and where john could you get the back doors for me please and uh uh and because they were having um these symptoms we didn't know uh who was in contact with whom and we didn't know exactly uh if it was flu or uh covid19 or exactly what it was so we've been told and we're we can only go on things that we're told so and we know that those things that we are told change rapidly but basically they say that there's a couple week period in which people can catch it so we didn't know who had contact with who we didn't know how many people in the congregation may have been contact in contact with the people that were sick a few of them tested a positive but they had no symptoms whatsoever others tested negative and so we just felt if we took two weeks off then any cases that would have come up or any new cases or anybody that was sick we'd give it time to manifest and then they could do what they needed to do without causing any spread or any uh passing along and we always try to do these things if you're sick and you're not feeling well stay home the scripture says call for the elders the church and they'll come anoint you with oil and they'll pray for you so okay you know if you have a child that's sick i know you love to go to church and that's one of the biggest burdens of having children is that they take your care and they take your time and you can't always do the things that you would like to do because of your children and sometimes they get sick and it's better that you don't bring sick children to church and because they make the other children sick and and so if you're not feeling well and you're sick then be in consideration for others and so we're still practicing what we've believed to practice according to our compute community so we do the things we do because we're part of the community our church is in bedford and we're part of bedford and so uh we still want to continually wash our hands you know wear face masks if if you feel like you need to i can't enforce face masks but they feel the word face mask if you try to keep with social distancing you can keep try to sit together in family groups when you come to church sit together in family groups that it less exposure and uh so it doesn't seem like any new people have contacted any sickness and everybody just seems to be doing well in that regard and we've not had any real serious sickness whatsoever i tested and i tested negative and uh and we've had other people test negative so if you have any questions uh and you'd like to come to church and you're worried just go take a test and if you come back and you're negative just feel free to come to church if you're feeling fine you don't have any symptoms feel free to come to church we'll try to have service again next sunday if you're still a little nervous then feel free to stay home and pretty soon things will change i think for the better but i just felt it was the right thing for me to do and not knowing and wanting to keep everybody safe and mostly the people that have problems are elderly people who have pre-existing conditions it's not very hard on young people but so we just postponed everything and i hope that you uh still are faithful to service i hope that you do stream the services and know what's on our heart and know what's on the brother's heart and so next sunday we'll uh try to pick up and if something happens again uh we might repeat this procedure over a pin and with limited seating we might go back to 50 percent or something like that if we don't have any problems we're just going to forge forward by faith amen so there's not there's not um much else that i know what to do it's just one of those things i just don't know how to express it to you but let's go ahead and and we'll take a moment and and study the word of god if uh if if we could do that i'd like to turn in the book of samuel if you would stand the first samuel for the word of the lord and i just have a little thought on my heart and a word of encouragement if i i may and uh and i this is a a great a little scripture and it's the wisdom of the lord through sam uh the lord speaking to samuel so many times we look on the outward appearance of things but god doesn't judge by the outside he judges by the inside so let's just read this little scripture for a text and then we'll just share the word of the lord with you a little bit this morning and hope that it's an encouragement to you and bringing it down to our day but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart amen heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated i'd like this morning just to if i could say that that god looks on the inward man he looks on the heart of man that he knows what's in man's heart and and how that man is made up and uh and so you know god uh looks and upon man and you know a lot of times we feel that god doesn't isn't watching and the prophet of god said in the word of the lord speaking to us he said that man does the things that he does because he feels that god's not watching but we know the angels of the lord they go to and fro across the earth marking them that sigh and cry at the abominations that see the way that the world's going and how that they're depressed if i could use that word and how they're discouraged and and how that they tremble in their spirits at the iniquity that is was upon the face of the earth and if it was uh just became a burden and i think that we all sense the pressure of the things that are taking place in our world and in our country and though we're we're not we're in this world but we're not of this world and we have many times we feel the pressure wondering what effects will these things have on us is our religious freedom at stake is we've already watched the things that we held dear the sacredness of marriage we've seen that been taken from us and i noticed that many of you heard this week the announcement of the pope now there are 63 million catholics in the united states of america my mother is a catholic and my family's catholic my relatives i come from a catholic background and as the catholic faith they believe that the pope is the vicar of christ in other words he's on earth instead of the lord jesus he's the holy one they they his his title is holy father and and they they hold him in that esteem that he speaks and when he speaks he has infallibility so he's infallible when he speaks that's the honor that they've bestowed upon his office and they hold him in that regard and this week you know that he made a declaration that marriage between the same genders is acceptable in civil court in other words he says it's it's okay if you do it in the court as an legal natural marriage it's not something that we will do in the church but we will still recognize it outside of the church and uh of course to me that's a compromising you know in fact to me it's against the word of god but you have the the the vicar of christ you have the person that they consider to be the head of the free world the head of the great mother harlot and all her daughters and you know what happens they will follow suit so in other words we've watched the we've watched uh our country uh change where now uh marriages are fine and uh so many other things that a morality have changed over the years and it brings me to uh a great a scripture and we're going to read some scriptures and have a little bible study this morning but in genesis the sixth chapter and if we read in genesis the sixth chapter it says and the lord said my this is the genesis sixth chapter and the third verse i'm sorry genesis the sixth chapter and the third verse and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man. for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years and there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god come into the daughters of men and they bear children to them and the same became mighty men which are of old men of renowned and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thought of his heart was only evil continually now if this ever was a day of imagination it's now and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and creeping things and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord now in the midst of all this wickedness there was one that found grace in the eyes of the lord may i could say it this way noah was elected and chosen he was made the way that he was made in order to obtain his righteousness in order to obtain favor and god with god he he was made that way and if we go look then at the 6 the 17th verse and the lord had told noah to build a ship a boat that we call an ark and the 17th verse says and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and everything that is in the earth shall die amen and when we see here that noah heard this message you understand to know this was a prophecy okay he it wasn't a note in history he was telling noah build this boat you have found favor in my sight follow my instructions follow my word build this ship because thus saith the lord i'm going to make it rain it's going to i'm going to flood it didn't say he was going to rain he says i'm going to bring a flood upon the earth and destroy all flesh now no noah was elected to receive that prophecy he heard that message you understand god gave him a message and he heard that message and the message was i the iniquity has been filled in my sight i'm not going to allow man to live in this way in this condition i'm going to destroy him and so that was the message and and noah received and he heard that message now he didn't care what was happening in the world around him he lived by the message that he received that's what he lived by now can you imagine what was going on during that time all those years that he preached man was prospering man the world was changing the iniquity was taking on the in form in government in laws transgressions became lawful uh serving uh many gods became norm and that civilization was going on getting farther and farther away from god but noah had heard that that god was going to destroy it now he so he was chosen to hear that and he received it in his heart in fact he was created to receive that message he received it in his heart he was created to hear it he was created to receive it and he received it in his heart he didn't need science he didn't need to send the weather balloon up he didn't need science he didn't need he he didn't uh he didn't need anything to receive that message that message didn't come to him from an outside source it came to him directly and it came into his heart because he was created to receive it now you think why did he receive it and nobody else did because he was chosen because god looks upon the not the outer continents but he looked upon the heart he had found favor with god and god had extended him to the message and and he was created to receive that prophecy now i want to hold that part he wasn't created to have his eyes opened to something that was in existence his eyes weren't open to something that was present in hid his eyes were opened to prophecy not what was not what is but what is going to be he received a message of prophecy in his heart he didn't need to rely on visual evidence he didn't have to have clouds he didn't have to have wind he didn't have to have lightning he didn't have to have any proof he received it and he he lived and he worked towards the fulfillment of that prophecy and you know the revelation that was in him was greater than the doubt of the world and it was greater in the flood amen the word the word that was in him the prophecy that it was in him and given to him he was the fulfillment of that prophecy he was actually that prophecy that word manifested he was that word he became that word what was prophesied to him he he he lived that prophecy he lived because he knew there was going to be a flood he preached to him repent god's going to destroy get ready enter into the ark and they laughed at them and they mocked them and they scoffed them they thought everything's just going to go on the same but he was a recipient of the prophecy and because he lived the prophecy he became the prophecy and he became the fulfillment of the prophecy he was the fulfillment of the prophetic word the word became flesh in him you look at moses i love these bible stories because we have been such a christian nation for so long but we're no longer a christian nation only in word only but moses was chosen and like if we go to exodus the the 12th uh exodus the uh third chapter and the 12th verse and and and i hope that i can start moving toward what's on my heart and exodus the third chapter we know that moses was chosen of god we don't have to go through the story we know he was a proper child we know that he was preserved and elected and chosen but then we come here and we find that that moses was driven out of egypt and he's on the back side of the desert and he turns aside because he sees a burning bush and when he gets to that burning bush we see that god speaks to moses and moses knew that his life was chosen there was something in his heart that he wanted to do it he tried to slay an egyptian he tried to bring things about his own way he tried to use his military might in his political strength and all those things that went past and went on before but now moses comes to this burning bush and the bush tells him he says i have elected you and chose you to deliver my children now i want you to notice this prophecy and he said certainly i will be with thee and that was moses's question they're not going to receive me who am i you know all his weaknesses and you know your weaknesses isn't uh an excuse before god no neither is your stature or your continents but god looks on the heart and so he looks at moses and moses says who am i i can't do it it can lord says moses i'll be with you in other words my strength is made perfect in your weakness i'm with you i'll be with you now he giving moses a prophecy and moses was wondering if he can fulfill this prophecy and like many times you wonder if you can be the bride but you were chosen to be the bride and and he'll be with you that's so he he says here he says any in the 11th verse moses says unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hath brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain amen that word was living in him and he was the only one that could fulfill that word now think of that word he goes into pharaoh and he's got one prophecy and that prophecy is the token to him you think it was the stick you think it was putting the his hand in the thing all those things were signs the speaking of the of the flies and the fleas and the turning of the water and the hail and all those things all those things is what god had to do to bring the token to pass because the prophecy was you will take these children and serve me on this mountain that was what he gave moses as a token that was what was that's what the prophecy was that moses had in his heart that was the word that he received you will bring the children out of egypt and worship at this mountain amen he was the only one that could fulfill that prophecy he was chosen to fulfill it he was elected to fulfill it he was the only one that could fulfill it so it didn't matter what stood between him and the mountain because the prophecy in him the word in him he was that prophecy made flesh i've got to go and i've got to bring the children of israel because it's thus saith the lord the children of israel will serve him in this mountain all the things he did the things he had to do he spoke it because he had a prophecy living in him that had to be fulfilled he had received the word of the lord concerning him and the children of israel he had become that word that word was made flesh in him he went up the pharaoh let my people go okay go over here and work him he didn't say worship in the desert bring my people back to this mountain for they shall serve me here that was the token that rang in moses's heart that was the prophecy that drove him he had received a promise that the children would worship at that mountain and so it didn't matter what happened it didn't matter what happened around them it didn't happen that pharaoh withstood them it didn't happen that the laws of the land were against them none of that mattered he had a token a covenant a token another that the price was paid this is your token moses this is the token to you that the price is paid to deliver the children of israel out of egypt and bring them to this mountain in worship my word's a token and moses put that on display let my people go and there he was so it didn't matter what was happening around him it didn't matter that pharaoh resisted it didn't matter the brick count went up it didn't matter the people were turning against him he had something in his heart he had a prophecy that he was living he had a word that he became part of him in that prophecy became one him in that token became one so it didn't matter what happened around him he knew there was a mountain and he knew he had to worship god and serve god on that mountain with the children of israel oh would you be so thrilled if you knew that something lied before you and that's what you were living for because there was an event that set before you that had been promised to you that was a token to you amen i go away to prepare a place for you if it were not so i would not told you so but i will come again and receive you that where i am you may be also that is a token to you moses didn't care what was in front of him the red sea he didn't care what was behind him pharaoh's army he only knew what was in him and the prophecy that was in him the word that was in him he that was in him was greater than all the armies of israel he that gave the prophecy was able to fulfill the prophecy in moses moses stretched out his hands the sea opens the children go up hard he closes his hands and i love that verse in the scripture i wish i'd looked it up and wrote it down but he said the armies of egypt which you fear shall be no more that prophecy was fulfilled in moses the prophecy the token that was in moses was greater than anything that was in the world you understand moses received the message he received the message from god noah received a message he received a message from god and the message that he received is what overcame the world the word in him was greater the prophecy in him was greater than the world that was against him and the same with moses what such a beautiful thing i think of david if we turn in first samuel the the 16th chapter and the 13th verse we had just taken our text from above that samuel 16 13. it says then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord come upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to vermont and you know it when you re you remember the the story and he says in the first verse the 16th chapter and the lord said unto samuel how long will thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from reign over israel fulfill thy horn with oil and go i will send thee to jesse thy brethren for i have provided me a king amongst his sons amen what what a a wonderful uh revelation of david's election he wasn't going to be kingly he was going to be ready and fair yeah and but god did it rejected the outward continents and he accepted the inward continents and so we find david now david was anointed to be king so there was a prophecy concerning his election because he was chosen i have chosen me a king out of the sons of jesse my choosing my election and david was out there tending sheep and he passed all the sons by and samuel sitting there going wait is this all your children i have a prophecy i have a word of the lord that i have chosen a son surely there's got to be one more and they all look at him and say well sorry but it can't be that guy out there there's no way it could be him do you ever feel that way about yourself that's how moses felt no way it could be me that's how the brethren felt about david no no way it could be him but it's his choosing he chooses the vessel some to honor some to dishonor he creates and chooses whom he's going to give the message to and depart the prophecy that was a prophecy david will be king david goes there he's anointed king from that time on david was king of israel whether anybody liked it or not he was the king of israel now can you imagine david when he comes up to goliath and david wasn't afraid goliath because he heard a message goliath was like g19 in flesh not c19 g he was there and what was he doing he was defiling the armies of the living god who's whose army was that it was his army he was the king he was god's king over israel exo david comes up before goliath and he had heard the message he was to be king the prophet was in him he was that prophecy made flesh oh i hope that i can just let this sink in that prophecy has got to come to pass prophecy has to be made flesh every prophecy in the old testament concerning the messiah was made flesh and dwelt among us so he goes up to goliath you think he's afraid of goliath why shakes his big spear i'm going to put you on this tree and the birds are going to eat your eyes out david's sitting there wait a minute i got a token a prophet came and he gave me a message and he anointed me with oil and i'm to be king he had a token in him he had a prophecy in him in fact he was that prophecy made flesh that word had become flesh he was the flesh of the prophecy i will pick a king i have chosen a king that he was that word made flesh it wasn't an open-ended office wasn't something anybody else could arise to he was the only one that could fulfill that word too many times we approach the scriptures like whoever decides that the fulfillment is based on our decision the fulfillment is based on election and so here he is you think he's afraid of that giant no he was the word of prophecy the word of prophecy was in david and the word of prophecy that was in him what was spoken of him if i could just express this to you the strength wasn't in ruddy david his strength wasn't in the slingshot this strength wasn't in how nimble he was or how quick he was his strength was in the word of prophecy that was in him the word of prophecy that was in him was what was greater than goliath it was a token to david he had this prophecy and he was that elected chosen one that god said that he would make a king made flesh that's what gave him the victory it was the word of prophecy in him that was greater than the giant hallelujah you can't look at the outside continents you can't look at the outside man you got to look if you got the token if you've got the promise david heard the message you're to be king just think of that they oh you're up here because you're a naughty boy no sorry brothers i'm up here because i'm king of this army what did david do when he met goliath you know what david did he acted like a king that's how he acted he acted like the king of israel the prophecy that was given in him manifested through the flesh and the king went out to protect his country hallelujah that was his token that was his defense what god spoke of him was his victory not the circumstance how would you like to be army of that bunch king of that bunch acting like cowards but he was king he was made king he was prophesied king and here shows up prophesied word are you guys afraid of him who is this uncircumcised philistine that defies the army of the living god what was that speaking it was the prophecy speaking it was the token speaking it was what he was speaking the prophecy made him king and when he meant the challenge he meant the challenge not as a shepherd boy but as king of israel oh sons and daughters of god have you received the message have you received a prophecy have you received the promise i like daniel let's turn to daniel the third chapter of daniel in the 13th verse daniel is absolutely a wonderful read now don't try to figure it all out because those dreams and visions are something but i love this i just love to look at this and and see it and and just read it and so we know the story leading up to this that nebuchadnezzar made an image a statue and he ordered that when the sound certain sounds were made that everybody was to bow down and we picked up the story in the third chapter of the book of daniel and the 13th verse then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach meshach and abednego you know a lot of parents use that to get their kids they say shadrach meshach and to bed we go it works then they brought these men before the king and nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true o shadrach meshach and abednego do not ye serve my gods no worship the golden image which i have set up now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet the flute harp shack butt palestry and dolce mir and all kinds of music ye fall down and worship the image which i have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of the burning furnace and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands which god would you want to have been servant huh and shout at me second of nabednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fur furnace fiery furnace but and he will deliver us out of thy hand o king but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve the gods nor worship the golden image without have set up hallelujah now i want you to notice something they may not have had a prophecy but they did have a prophecy the prophecy was the commandments of god thou shalt not worship any god i am the lord thy god thou shalt not worship any god that was their commandment when they went into captivity daniel and shadrach meshach and abednego they purposed in their heart not to defile themselves and remember the story the the master of the guard who was the chief eunuch who was in charge of their well-being he came to him and he said you guys aren't eating the king's meat i'm afraid you'll start looking sickly and pale and if you guys don't look good i'm going to be killed they said we won't need it i want you to see their resolve i want you to see their dedication to the word the word at their time was the law the ten commandments that dwelt in them the words of the prophecy of mount sinai dwelt in them the law of moses dwelt in them they lived by it it was their life and they said no just give us i think this pasta see some sign of porridge or meal i don't know exactly what it was he said we'll eat that for 10 days and after 10 days they looked better than the rest of them they were flush and they were fat and they had great hunk continents about them so the guy he said he's off the hook he just gave them the food and they hate the way they ate and so now they're not afraid to answer why they had the commandments of god in their heart o king live forever but i'm not going to break that which is in my heart i'm not going to compromise even if my life depends on it this is what i believe this is what i live by this is what i die by this is my moral fiber this is my structure this is who i am i am not going to compromise on the word and may i say say this that obedience to the word that was in them the prophecy that was in them the word that was in them the obedience that was in them was greater than the fiery furnace no matter how dark it looked the message that they received that god had commanded them not to bow down to another god they had no circumstance where it was right for them no provision was made for them they stuck with the word why did they stick with it because the word was in them and the obedience that they had to the commandments was greater than the fiery furnace and then look over at the 24th verse of the same chapter the third chapter and then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three bound into the midst of the fire didn't we cast three guys in there fully clothed everything didn't we throw him in there and they answered and said unto the king true o king and he answered and said lo i see four men loose oh my wouldn't you like to been a part of that revival shadrach meshach walking around with the fourth man let me tell you you have that fourth man because that fourth man goes with the prophecy he is the prophecy and when you and the prophecy become one he's always there he is the word they were the word they were the manifestation of the fulfillment of the word of the lord for that day in flesh they were the commandments on in flesh they came off the tablet of stone and became manifested in flesh and that word in them was greater than the fiery furnace he says lo i see a fourth man walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth man is like the son of god hallelujah do you understand just the obedience to the prophecy and becoming one with the word was able to overcome he who is in you is greater than he who was in the world you say well if god didn't come speak to them the word spoke to him the commandment spoke to them they had that in their heart they wrote it upon the tablets of their heart they meditated upon it day and night they were obedient to that word they were that word he couldn't destroy them without destroying the word that's your relationship that's where you're saying let's look at daniel let's go to the sixth chapter i want you to see how that receiving the message and receiving the word and receiving the instruction and receiving the commandments is receiving the prophecy so you know the story i believe the king's name is is darius at this time and um and so his men they kind of um his uh uh what do you say is counselors they say oh king we want to make a great day and a great honor and lift you up as the great king and and the motives and objectives of their heart are totally wrong but they said let it be that for 24 hours or whatever that no man makes no petition of no god or no person or anybody but the alone you're going to have soul sovereign authority well let me tell you something god doesn't give up his authority you may think satan's in control but he's not god doesn't give up his authority the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord nobody's supposed to pray nobody daniel hears it what do you think he does he goes opens the window he kneels down and he turns his eyes towards jerusalem because the word of god said if the children of israel turned their hearts and their eyes to jerusalem that god would hear their prayer do you think daniel's given that up he's got a prophecy he's got a word he received a message now he becomes that message manifested in flesh now that prophecy is going to be fulfilled because he's in the time of trouble he's got to kneel down and he's got to pray and he throws us off the windows open and he looks to jerusalem and he looketh unto the lord from whence cometh his help they come to the king and say daniel prayed do you know the king spoke on his behalf he tried to argue with them do you have mercy he hated what he'd done and they held the king they said oak darius you know the laws you wrote the laws you know you can't take it back and they held his feet to the fire and then you you reap here in the 16th verse of the sixth chapter then the king commanded they brought daniel and cast him into the den of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thy god whom thou serve continually he will deliver thee the life that was in daniel the keeping of the word that was in daniel was greater than the king's decree in fact even the king recognized it oh daniel surely your god will spare you and then you you read it the king fasted all night he was distraught he couldn't sleep and first thing he spent the whole night the 18th first then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were any instruments and music brought before him and his sleep went from him then the king arose very early in the morning and went in hastened unto the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel and the king spake and said to daniel oh daniel servant of the living god is thy god whom thou service continual able to deliverly from the lions then said daniel unto the king o king live forever oh wouldn't you like to be so secure in your heart that that was your feeling through this world all around us my god has sent his angel and he has shut the lion's mouth that they have not hurt me for much as before him innocently was found in me innocence was found in me and also before thee o king i have done no hurt isn't that thrill you that that word and that righteousness and that lack of fear and calling upon the name of the lord just obedience and believing and following the message of his hour how it was greater than the lion's den he went into the den they went into the fire noah went into the flood but we have a promise that the lord delivereth us out of all our afflictions it it's to understand that he heard the message he received the word of god he received that there's no other god to serve there's no other truth there's not three gods there's no other baptism there's no other evidence of the token but obedience to the word of god he what they weren't taken apart from every anointing and led this way and led that they they were steadfast in their heart not to defile themselves with the gods of babylon that was a power in a strength that was in them that was greater than anything in the world just your consecration to the word of god is greater than the world he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world and in closing this morning didn't you receive a message didn't i receive a message every single one of these messages prophecies were given to people and then manifested in their flesh and the prophecy was fulfilled through them they were elected to receive the message they were elected to become the message and they were elected to overcome by the prophecy that they manifested in flesh that's the way god always does it may i read this from the message proving his word now i want you to notice this is proving his word paragraph 122 and i i believe it was preached in let me tell you the date that it was preached in case you want to look at it it was 8 16 64. paragraph 122. he says now i want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers and then in order to have believers to meet that word so he had to have he had to have no to be there to receive the message and meet that word of destruction to provide a way of escape he's got he's got the to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did it get you do you feel it do you see it do you understand it that's what's happening today he's predestinated it to do this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated in malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestinates anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so and when he predestinated anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's going to be there going to be a rapture she's going to be there he predestinated by his foreknowledge there's nothing that's going to stop it look what's going on i'm in i'm astonished it's what's going on i'm astonished that they're they're they're legalizing full late term abortions i'm astonished the opening the prison doors i'm astonished at all those things but isn't didn't we receive a message didn't we receive a message that is it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man didn't receive a message as it was in the days of sodom they were married and given into marriage and don't even marry at all wasn't it prophesied didn't we receive the prophecy didn't we receive the message that perilous times shall come that men shall be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god not wishing to retain god in their knowledge that he turns them over to a reprobate mind don't you understand we've received the prophecy we've received the message and what was that message i have elected and chosen a bride she will be there there will be a rapture nothing's going to stop it you see it's the message prophecy living in us that's a deliverance from this world the message in us is greater in the world around us our deliverance is the rapture that's what we've been set aside for that's what we've been called out to we cannot stop what's happening i don't care if it's a republican or a democrat remember this satan appears as an angel of light a person might line up with every single bit of my political views and what i think ought to be done and what i don't think should be done but the word of god said don't look upon the continents of it god judges the heart we only have one set of eyes and that's the prophecy the prophecy is our democracy will not last the prophecy is that america is going to go into total rune the prophecy is this world will be destroyed that's the prophecy but along with that prophecy i'll not leave you nor forsake you you will not see the destruction that's going to fall upon the face of the earth because i will not let my bride go through the tribulation we've got a prophecy and if we're living by that prophecy and that prophecy is made manifested in our flesh then that very prophecy becomes a deliverance from the very thing we abhorred there's only one event left and that's the rapture of the church you're not going to stop it we're not going to stop it in fact when you think about it there's a whole movement in the world it's called the reset movement in other words man started down this course and of course they're going down science things are going to destroy the world they think they're going to starve to death they think they're going to pollute to death they think disease is going to come and they said we've got to stop the world and the direction that it's going and we need to reset our thinking we need to change everything we need to change the cars we're driving we need to change the buildings we're living in we need to change what we eat we've got to do this we've got to do that well i pray tell you you better consult the message that god sent forth because god's done with america he's done with the world and there's only one thing that's waiting is a judgment and if you hear the message you'll hear the ark of escape and the exodus to come out from amongst my people and be separate they're not resetting nothing their congress isn't going to change anything their president's not going to change anything and they're not going to change anything because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord and the prophet of god said if god doesn't destroy this place he'll have to raise sodom and gomorrah from the sea it's over it's over that's what nebuchadnezzar thought about shadrach meshach neve that's what darius thought about daniel you look at gideon gideon had the word of the lord kid and said oh who am i just go to judges the sixth chapter in closing see if i can find judges real quick the sixth chapter in the 14th verse book of judges let's start with the 12th verse and the angel lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valor and gideon said unto him o my lord if the lord be with us why then has all this befallen us and where be his miracles which our father told of saying did not the lord bring us up out of egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the lord looked upon him and said go in this might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee take that to heart we've been sent to be the burning light of the message that there's a rapture and a deliverance coming and it's in the ark of god's word and he said unto him o my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my father's house and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man surely you're my bride surely i'm with you surely i go with you to him that overcometh i will give to set with me in my father's throne didn't matter how little gideon's army was he had a prophecy he had received a message and that message was living in his heart and he became that message he became that prophecy and he was that prophecy manny manifested in flesh and we have a message and that message was to call out a bride to restore the faith of the fathers to the children and the faith of the children back to the fathers we have a promised word in our day an elect word a prophecy that's manifested in the flesh and we know that that prophecy that is in us and the word that is in us that word will rapture us out of the prophesied destruction that's fixing to hit this earth you think gideon was afraid what did he rely on he relied on the message you shall save israel we rely on the message come out from amongst them my people and be ye separate and i will come again and receive you that where i am you'll be also as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of sodom and gomorrah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man in the voice of the day of the seventh angel the mysteries of god should be finished behold i stand at the door and knock whoever opens up i will come into him and sup with him we have a message that will be fed will become one with the word and we'll be raptured and taken home aren't you glad that you've heard the word aren't you glad you've become a part of it aren't you glad that he lives and because he lives we live also don't forget the prophecy church the prophecy is we're going home the prophecy is will be raptured the prophecy is if we go to the grave the grave won't hold us down we'll rise first and we'll meet him together in the air ever to be with our lord don't be dismayed at the iniquity that's forming around us we have a message that we're going home god bless you let's stand together billy if you could come and lead us in a song sister sarah thank you so much for praying god bless you at home uh don't be discouraged don't worry he that is in you the prophecy that is made flesh in you he said he would have a bride he would call her out there you are sitting at home listening sitting in the church building it's been made flesh and what's been made flesh in you is greater than the iniquity that's around us in the world and just like the prophecy delivered every other believer it's the same today he predestinates the seed to be there there will be a bride nothing can stop it there will be a rapture it will happen why because the prophecies been made flesh and dwells among us and he who is in us is greater and he is in the world let us pray our gracious heavenly father we have come to the hour of the fulfillment of thy word [Music] lord when america has spilled me out [Music] they no longer wish to retain you in their knowledge [Music] they put on a religious covering they act like they may be so moral and so right [Music] but yet we see the days of sodom and gomorrah and the days of noah so vividly around us and we know there's only one way of escape [Music] is that we become the prophecy of a bride made flesh that we become the prophecy of a rapture made flesh and we live by that word like daniel and shadrach meshach and abednego we accept the challenge like gideon did we live righteous in the wicked world
