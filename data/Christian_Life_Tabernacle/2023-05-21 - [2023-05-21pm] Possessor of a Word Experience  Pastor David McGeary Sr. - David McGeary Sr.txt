Description:
Possessor of a Word Experience 
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
May 21, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

that you've done we ask you to be our portion this evening father that our hearts might be anchored strong we ask you to bless us now in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless you let's open our Bibles this evening um and certainly enjoyed the word this morning and the move of the Lord and we want to just talk a little bit along some lines there to help us we want to turn to scripture Matthew the 12th chapter the 43rd and 45th verse of Matthew the 12th chapter and look 43 and 45 of Matthew the 12th chapter and okay my page is stuck together here here they are it says all right all right let me see if I got it right here Matthew 43 yeah right okay okay it's a 42nd verse and it says 30 43rd verse the 12th chapter when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walked it through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none because then he said I will return unto my house from which I come out and when he has come he findeth an empty swept and garnished then go a thief and take this with him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last date of the man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated foreign I don't know exactly how to go about uh saying what's on my heart but um what I'd like to talk about is how that we can keep our experience Deliverance in healing what's what's the secret to keeping it and and I think if we can just go for a moment and understand how the spirit works and then we could see our our place in it because I love services like this morning that when the Lord offers uh that through the word of God his delivering power act and so you you hear a message and it stimulates your heart because maybe you're in a like our brother brought this morning maybe you're in a place where you're down he's called it being in a season and and so you hear a a tithing of gladness and you hear uh the word of God being expressed to you and you hear those things and it causes in you a great joy and a great stimulation and you're glad to hear it because it's good news hey I'm not stuck here God cares you know this isn't the end of the matter God's in control so it it brings to us a hope and it brings to us a sense of well-being or Deliverance that I don't have to stay here and and so when when we're moved upon uh a lot of times then we will go to be prayed for and uh and the the presence of the Lord will come and it will it'll bless us and we we have that blessing in in our lives and and so we feel like God's done something for us but if it's not taken a step further that's what we want to talk about how can we hang on to that experience and and so we we we understand we've been taught uh we have such a great uh teacher in our messenger Not only would I say that we saw the love of God on display projected to us uh we saw that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever and we saw that all things were possible I think that's what our hope comes in is that no matter how dark it looked or what dark the dark decision it it seems like we've made or the consequences the gospel comes and tell us I'll take that and throw that in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more you can have a fresh start so the spirit moves and and so I just wanted to bring this out in just a couple because it's so simple and I don't want to be long can I but I want us to understand that we get lost in the transition and so this is what the prophet of God says in the Easter seal he says now we notice it's the same spirit that raised him from the grave that dwelleth in US now how could that be the spirit that raised up God Jesus from the dead has dwelt in us and we just listen to a wonderful tape on that didn't we Perfection now there's nothing we can do but a perfect gift came and it was the perfect sacrifice for whatever that we have need of and because he became a Kinsmen Redeemer now his Spirit can return back on the believer and so we we have that now he says the spirit he says now it's the spirit that quickens not the word that quickens now when he said when we're talking there the word we're not talking about the word the person Jesus we're talking about the scriptural promises they don't quicken in themselves in other words you read the promise right so you read the promise I'll forgive you of your sins I'll I'll deliver you I'll do this I'll do that I'll do this Peter says by these great and precious promises we are partakers of divine nature so we have that scripture uh written there and that's what the preaching of the Gospel does it comes along and it brings to your remembrance that scripture okay do you remember that that that's your promise and that's something that's spoken of you but that's not what makes it alive and this is what he goes on to say he said now it's the spirit that quickness it's not the word that quickens just reading it doesn't Quicken it you understand just seeing it's there and doesn't Quicken it it takes an outside force is it something to move on you and to to bring that scripture to you by revelation and now you take it as this is this pertains to me actually it's been quickened to you and Quicken means that it's been made alive right so now the spirit that quickens is not the word that quickens is the spirit that quickens the word or gives that word life now there's our key point tonight gives he says gives it wings to fly gives it access it's the spirit that does that now so we're wanting to talk about the experience how we can hold on to it look in our lives what takes place if we find ourselves in a time of need we find ourselves we all go up and down we all black tie we're all on the mountain and in the valley and everything and we go through those things in the word of God extends to us hope and then the spirit comes along and quickens that to us and he makes it alive and he makes it so that that we can grab hold of it and so when when the spirit it when it IT quickens it and it becomes alive now though this is where what we've got to transform Ed into because you understand that the season as our brothers spoken for in this season that we're in is we're moving past being recipients but we're being possessors so uh to become a possessor of Deliverance and not just a recipient so that promise is always there it's always there for you every time you're down every time you're sick every time you sin that healing's always there for you every time that that you you backslide that Deliverance is always there for you but we want to how can we move past always always being of the recipient of it every time that we need it and now become the possessor of it so it's always there for us foreign you know what I mean he can always go drink from that fountain drink from that Fountain but this is a time that where that Fountain no longer wants to be on the outside where you're drinking from it every time you need it but now it becomes something that you own you have the the secret to that is we don't want to be because I see it over the years is that the Lord will once again let us know that he wants to deliver us he wants to heal us he's a mighty God and we all rejoice in that praise God my God can do anything we have a god that is above all power and and almight and we take hope in that and and then we run we run to that Fountain and we get that deliverance and we're temporarily if I get use that word we're delivered and we feel that Deliverance can we feel that joy we feel that weight lifted off of us we feel that burden come from us we've had a real genuine experience but how do you hang on to it okay well how does it transform from being something that you could just received something that's just blessed you something that's just anointed you to now where it becomes something that you have that you possess Ed okay because you'll never go back you'll you'll never go back for that same thing over and over and over and over and over again because it's like the it's like the the the the Deliverance fountain or The Cloud of troubles and the clouds of Trials and the worries of life and the cares of Life choke up our choke out the vision of it and then the word of God comes and opens the fountain to us again and then we run in there and we take a drink and we Rejoice we're glad we praise God we feel that but then we go out from that and it's not long those same clouds come in again okay and we find I'm returning back I'm returning back I'm returning back what does the believer have to do in order to connect that Fountain doesn't get clouded over because it's something that he has that can't be taken over it changed your life like our brother talked about this morning I loved it how how the seasons they come upon us different times and different season comes upon us but can those seasons have an effect on you but there Comes A Time in the believer's life where no longer are those Seasons governing him he's governing the seasons he's a Mystic he walks in a world by him off he's in control of every situation in every circumstance and there is this thing isn't getting me no more amen it's bit me a hundred times and I've ran through the fountain a hundred times and God's delivered me a hundred times but now I'm I want to come to the place where I don't go there anymore I really want to come to the place where I don't go there for me anymore but I go there for somebody else because I've I I've grabbed the hold of what it is that he's doing that's because old people go to the fountain at the end and they they they partake of the they partake of the blessing they play take of the water they partake of the Tree of Life freely they partake of it but they can't grab a hold of it and it's okay if I could just uh say it this way because when they go there and they hear the word of God it inspires them and they say I want that I want some of that I need that but they never really understand what it is they got they felt it they felt the effect of it it moved on their heart and it's gone and praise God praise God but you can't stop there you understand you can't say I I got I got delivered I got healed you got to know what was it that you got what was it what happened what has taken place then when you can grab a hold of that and you know what it is then you can possess it but you can't possess something that you don't know what it is you know it was a Feeling you know you know the result of it do you know how you felt full of fresh air and fresh breath how many's experience when a ton of bricks is lifted Alfalfa yeah why it's wonderful but if I was to say to you what happened well we've got to get past the place we say I don't know God just did it because God doesn't do things like that God only does what he says he would do God keeps his word he said so that settles it look a Believer has got to be able to go back because that's faith so when you hear the word you respond if you'll come and we'll lay Mark your hands on you you'll feel forgiven you've you'll be healed you'll be made well and the believer comes up and they experience it they have the results of it and they go off the platform rejoicing because they no longer feel the way that they felt they feel the burdens lifted and everything but you they can't identify what has taken place what did he just do now you will say he delivered me I say no I say it's beyond that he fulfilled his word so if you if if so if you don't know what if you don't know what happened to you then then that's what causes you to to go back and forth back and forth back and forth because you don't know what did he just do what has transpired what has taken place what was this and when I know what it is then I can grab a hold of it and I can possess it when you don't know what it is you can't you can't take it you can get the benefit and it is wonderful but how would you like to go from where you felt it do you have it you know and and and if you have it then it's with you always to do the same thing over and over and over again you have it now it's like it's like it's like uh a medicine you know you take a medicine you take the medicine every time you're sick but if you possess that medicine and every time that sickness arises that medicine's already there because you possess it so it's always on the spot it's always on the spot it's always there doing exceedingly and abundantly for you above what you can even ask or think it's not something you got to go searching for because it's not something you've got to be told about you you've heard it once you understood what it is you take possession of it now you always have it present tense with you and it'll continue to do always for you what it did the first time you understand where I'm going and that's because because you know what you got you know what you got you know what happened you know what's come to pass so God he only brings to pass his word Peter said by these exceedingly great and precious promises we become partakers of divine nature look when when so when you receive something of him the quit the spirit is quickening that word to you giving that word wings and making that word come alive what we have to know is what word did he just make come alive because Faith final resting place is the word of God this is in God in Simplicity for faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen and Faith takes its final resting place on the word of God there is where it Finds Its resting place you understand it's the resting place of God's word so faith is the resting place is God's word so when something transpires in your life you've got to come to the realization and bring yourself to the spot that you study the scriptures because in them there's a life so you know what scripture just got fulfilled in me what was that when they laid hands on me and I got well you've got to be able to take that back and find the scripture the Elder shall lay their hands on me and we shall recover they shall anoint me with oil go into all the world preach the gospel Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover when you experience that you've got to take it back to the word of God and you've got to say this is my resting place because this is what just has come to pass the scriptures have been fulfilled in me not an experience the experience is wonderful it's the it's what brings that word to life you can't you can't feel the presence of God without having experience I mean it's It's Supernatural but when it when you when you can come back and you can look at it and then you can say you can say this is the scripture that has been fulfilled it says now that word has been made flesh in me now you've got something to Anchor to that won't go away now you can possess that I own that I'm not talking about the experience the experience was wonderful I'm not talking about the emotion it'll make you emotional I watched a little uh news clip uh a very seldom have some of these things that happen that just moved me because the person involved is so genuine when is the time because I believe his name was brother Mike the man that got shot by the policeman the policeman literally was trying to take his life can he got up in the courthouse and he told the judge I want this court to know I've come to know the Lord Jesus Christ I totally forgive this man and that got me the other clip I saw and I don't even mind if you go look it up there was a police officer in Dallas here oh oh I guess it was a few years now that she's came home from work and she got off on the wrong floor to open the door to his her apartment thinking that it was her apartment and there was a gentleman in there and they they she she shot him and she was convicted of murder and I know there's a great disputing and all that female police officer but at the sentencing hearing the brother of the gentleman that was shot took the stand and he said okay was bitter I was full of hatred but his grandmother talked to him and he sat on that stand and he told that lady he says I don't hate you I forgive you I'm sorry this has ever happened to you and he looks up at the judge and he says your honor may I give her a hug the courtroom's in shock and the murderer they said it was murder I'm not put judged with that I don't think she intentionally meant to kill him but they felt with her training she should have not done that Eric and the brother of the person embraced in that courtroom and they cried on one another's shoulders that got me that was something that was genuine that was true forgiveness because someone that really genuinely forgave from their heart and wanted to show compassion can sympathy for the the the person that got themselves in a circumstance that was going to ruin their life forever because now she had to live with what she had done it was I watched it become flesh it no longer was something that was just on the paper a real genuine forgiveness when I saw Mike forgive that okay it no longer was just a written scripture about something now I can actually sit back and see it playing out in human form in flesh and when you receive a Deliverance you look receive a healing can you do you receive an experience that is not the experience in itself it's the word being made flesh that's what you've got to go back and anchor to that's what gives you the ability to take possession of it not because it's an experience because experiences fade they go away they're seasonal how many of you have shouted and just rejoiced five weeks later you're not running around shouting and rejoicing because the scripture says can in John 3 5 and 6. Saint John 3 5 and 6. and if you want if they have it on board if you want to read it it says Jesus answered and says verily verily I say unto thee accept amen be born both of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit all if we could just come to the place we could separate our flesh from our spirit when we can do that then our spirit can take control of the flesh and it takes can control of the flesh by the word because Satan's battle is in the mind but the only weapon that God has given us to defeat Satan is his word and that's what the spirit does it quickens that word it makes it alive now it if it don't return back to you as the word being fulfilled then you've anchored in the experience but the experience is just the result it's not the cause the word was the cause the promise was the cause that's what you've got to see that you possessed you you now possessed that word promise because it was manifested in you and it became flesh in you that's what you see because what you felt will go away but if you know it was the word and you know it was the promise being fulfilled and you know what God did for you and you know what he did and you know how he did it now that becomes yours for eternity because Faith doesn't rest in the experience it doesn't rest in the healing it rests in the word because it's the evidence of things hoped for not seen so when you experience it which I love the experience I'd hate just to have some dry boned word experience that ain't no fun I like to see the devil defeated I don't like the guy I don't think he likes me but that that's not connect I don't walk away and say oh I was blessed well the rain falls on the just in the unjust or while that was wonderful and you're so happy what he did you understand what I'm trying to say you've got to take it back to where it can rest or where it can stay where it'll always be there because now it's your possession God fulfilled this scripture in my flesh Heaven and Earth will pass away but his word will not pass away that's no longer something that I experienced it though I experienced it but now I've taken it back to the word and now it was the word may flesh in me now I have that now as being a part of me I'm a possessor of it God fulfilled this scripture in this flesh right here take that from me you can't but if you don't take it back to the word to Anchor you now you start chasing the experience why because you name you've never laid hold of it it's like an Elusive Butterfly you felt it you've seen it you want more of it you want more of it you want more of it but if you know that that scripture is in you it's always there to be quickened when you need it you've already got the letter you've already got the token you've already got the ticket you don't got to go back up to the ticket counter and say I need another ticket I gotta take another trip no it's been settled why has it been settled not by the experience but by the word that was fulfilled that's where Faith rests it's the Promise by the promise we're partakers of the nature you can be a partaker of the nature but if you don't know what promise brought that to pass you have no identification that's when Jesus meant Satan he never said get behind me I've got the power ah he said it is written it is written let's just finish the scripture read a couple more it says can't enter the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit of spirit Marvel not that I say ye must be born again the wind bloweth wherever it willeth can thou hearest the sound of it but cannot tell from whence it cometh or for where it goeth so is every man that is formed of the spirit those things come and go we don't go by feeling do we did you feel it it's what did you believe it what do you believe you believe what he said if he said so that settles it if you if you received your healing and you've been revealed to you that you're healing you might rejoice in the season of your healing but sure enough Satan's going to come back like that unclean spirit and he's going to knock trying to get back in now what did God give you to keep him out not the feeling you had not the rejoicing that you had though if you got it you would rejoice praise God Shout say hallelujah but when you're done with the experience can you're done with the joy make sure you're Anchored In God's word this is what he said this is what's come to pass this is the scripture that God just got done fulfilling in My Flesh and I know Heaven and Earth will pass away but this word will not pass away got to get back to the word that's what there's so many people that go through experiences and they go through meetings and they go through these things and they know it's God and they Rejoice it's God and they worship God for it but they've never been able to take it back and find it in the scriptures search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are which testify of me now you're becoming a possessor you're possessing that gate of the enemy he can no longer come through that gate because you have a scriptural fulfillment of the word lock in that door Hallelujah I'm telling you church it's word he is the word he was the word made flesh and when that promise scripture is fulfilled in you now you're that word made flesh and so no matter if you're sick as a dog you can say by his stripes I'm Healed the Lord delivereth me out of all my troubles he's my healer his thoughts towards me are good you take the word but if you've got to see it as being the word you've got to have the Revelation that that is what just happened to you what happened to you was that word coming to pass in you it was quickened and made alive for it says give the spirit it's the spirit that quickens so you know that that spirit came down on you and you felt it and it quickened that and made it alive you got the results now the question is what did he just do why leave that unanswered if that's unanswered you don't know where it came or what it did or what happened but when you can come back and get that scriptural Foundation when you can stand on it and said what happened to me was the word was fulfilled in me that's what I possess I possess the Fulfillment of the word because that won't pass away can that good he goes on to say look it's beautiful he says now the weed alone is just a wheat but when the quickening life gets into it into the wheat then it gives it life and we which are once death made in the image of God yet dead in sin and trespasses there's some way God had to get this quickening life into your mortal bodies I'm talking about your body so that quick knee life had to come in your body and now so you know what it is what just happened to me I felt something I was blessed I rejoiced I was happy which is true but take it that step further I've been quickened the words been made alive so now me and the word become one that's the invisible Union of the pride in Christ them recognizing that God is quickening the word that they are in them and it's coming to life and they know it's the word and they're resting on the word because that's its final resting place what I just experienced was not the experience itself though it was wonderful I've just experienced the scripture coming to pass in my life and be mating real therefore me and that scripture are one and I've just had an invisible Union with the bridegroom and the Heavenly bride oh I love it he said you know we could go to another great scripture of course we know the one in Peter that's always there how about did we read John 5 John 5 uh 37 38 and 39. and the father himself who hath sent me hath borne witness of me and ye have neither heard this voice at any time heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have you have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not they were blind search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me ye will not come unto me that ye might have life oh Church that's what moves us into the next level where Pentecost they rejoice in the experience but they couldn't anchor to the word of the hour but now can you imagine when you put those both together praise God now you're worshiping for his word you're worshiping him for what he really is cannot kiss an anointing that falls under Justin on you not just a spirit that can be so close it would deceive the very elective possible that you have a pure identification that this was the word that came to pass but you got to search the scripture see we have we go through something and it's wonderful a brother comes up we pray for you and and we we say you're healed go for it and you feel it you walk away and then all of a sudden you're in dry places and because you didn't search the scripture and anchor that to a resting place where you could always know it's there and always have it and always refer to it yeah you start missing the experience so you hunt The Experience down the prophet of God said you run from revival to Revival to Revival I love the story of the newspaper boy it come up and he said he said Barbara said you believe you're healed he says I believe I'm Healed go your way you're healed and he's back in the prayer line three or nine nights later and he says I still can't see he says I thought you told me you're healed I thought you said the word of God said by your stripes I'm Healed now he no longer took it from what he felt he took it to the word so now it didn't matter how he felt because he had a precious promise and because of that word he was going to be a partaker of that divine nature so he didn't give to the word through the experience he got to the experience through the word and that's what lasts because now you're no longer going from recipient to recipient to recipient or when you see people that just come to the altar time and time again every time the atmosphere gets to a certain place the atmosphere causes the movement but if it could ever take that experience to the word they would never have to return there because they already possess it it's already in them it's on the spot they don't have to go up there to get it they got it what happens when I sin don't say you don't sin we've all sinned it come short of the glory of God any man who says he sinneth not a liar but we have a petitionary so when you know that in the word right and you make a failure you cry Abba Father and you confess your sins and he's faithful and just to forgive your sins you don't have to run to the confessional Spirits in you convicting you of sin you become a possessor and not a recipient is that communion that's coming to the church where flesh the word was made flesh now flesh is being made word because they have an experience and then they take that experience back to the scripture they identify it in the word they know what scriptures was just fulfilled they know what word that just came to pass in them now they know that them in that word are one father may they be one as We Are One oh my God makes me want to go read John 17 and run around the block I think I can make it because it's word it's him he did it you've got you've got evidence you've got evidence the words the evidence they can say well I don't see you don't I don't see no I don't see nothing happen on on you right there that has come to pass in me I've experienced that scripture that word has made meat and flesh I am now one with that word I am that word it's happened it's real but if you don't take it back hear me if I if I've experienced something in the 50 years or so that I've been in this message is that I've seen people come in and out up and down run to the altar run back try everything in the book because they've never found a scripture to identify their experience I'm not saying do away at the experience find it in the word can if you can't find it in the word then which one's wrong then the experience is wrong kids nothing wrong with having a bad experience if you can filter it out of your life but if you don't take it to the word you take this great bit untrained experience remember the beautiful quote Matthew read us the lady come up in the prayer line and he said sister could you be still just a minute she's going praise God hallelujah God's A Healer I'm so glad to be here thank you Jesus and everything and he said lady could you be still I want to contact your spirit what did he say search the scriptures you don't listen to him you don't come to me that you might have life she just kept going on she wouldn't be still she kept shouting the Lord so brother remember just prayed to her and walked away she said you know she probably had cancer and is dead tonight why because she wasn't taught right she was taught it was the experience and the emotion if you would have taken it to the word then she would know I have the word the word is my ticket to the throne if you come up to be prayed for or you come up for deliverance and you don't have a word ticket a token you don't have a promise to present him that he's obligated to and if it was just the emotion of the preacher or the Bible story that brought you there you'll have an experience but it won't hold and I want you to be able to hold on to these experiences hold on to these expressions of Joy hold on to these deliverances Hulk to hold on to these things I want you to know I've had a word experience and every time you come to that word that experience will boil up in you it's a Fountain of Living Water it's always there because you're not a recipient you're a possessor you possess it it it's yours it's it's wonderful you have it and that's the only thing Satan's trying to keep you from is you identifying yourself in the scripture he never wants you to be able to say this scripture and me are one because once you become a part of any Scripture you've got eternal life I'm the word the word was made flesh now flesh is being made word if you get blessed in the spirit and you would be emotional praise God go back and tie it to the scripture what scriptural promise just came to pass in my life because if you don't you're traveling in a foreign land without ID you're just you're going to go from Pillar To Post anytime the enemy appears as an angel of Light you're on board but our case is not for the things of the world our taste is for God's word God's word gives genuine experience if you have an experience take it back to the word Peter said these men they were they they spoke in tongues they were blessed he says should we forbid them water seeing that they've already had the Holy Ghost they took the experience back to the word made it a fulfill word experience now it could never be defeated do you know where your strength is you know how to hold on to your experiences to your healings to your deliverances take them back and anchor them in the word so you know I've got word for this so many people don't have word he even told Peter I mean Timothy study the scriptures study this scripture make full proof of your ministry by studying God's word find the scripture that produced your experience and that experience will never leave you don't find the scripture you'll keep looking for the experience because it's elusive it blows it moves it comes as it will and it comes as it goes and so I thought some of you had some wonderful experiences this morning and I'm happy for that but I don't want it to go away I don't want you to be back in the dumps again in six months I don't want every time the pain comes in your body you don't think it happened the first time but God's word is what eternal it never passes away find your experience in the word of God how many knows the prophet taught that got to line up to the word if it don't line up to the word The Experience goes not the word but when you can get the two of them together that's a chord that's not easy broken and so that's what my heart's desire for you is is that when you feel the move of the spirit you you feel an unctioning of the Holy Spirit you feel a quickening or a revelation what is the number one thing every true bride messenger does takes it back to the word the way of a true Prophet is he takes everything back to the word so don't be afraid of the experience if you can line it up with the word and once you do you got it forever once you know you're saved you're saved I'm sorry it ain't my fault I got saved it might be a different way you have not chosen me I've chosen you that you might be fruitful and that your fruit right might remain and what so everything of your ask of the father in my name he'll do it that's the maturity that we're talking so I'm all for all the of course we're going to build some room at the church and then you can do cartwheels down the aisle as far but but when you get down to the end of that aisle I want you to stand in front of me and said that was Luke 17 49. that's what you just saw you just saw Isaiah 3 4. I'm just making these up you understand you didn't see me you didn't see any motion you saw word made flesh William Branham was word made flesh you didn't see a hillbilly Kentucky preacher you saw Malachi 4 5 Luke 17 30 Revelations 10 7 you saw scriptural word made flesh and because it was word you saw the promised results of that word so when you see the word you'll get the promised results of that word if you go dancing around with a tambourine you come back up and say I'm dancing like Miriam dance down the beach Genesis such an exodus that'll stop a critical path who's going to say anything against the word of God because it's life in life eternal and oh I tell you that's the one thing Satan can't handle he can impersonate anything but God's word it's simple don't misunderstand me because what you have he said I gave you fruits that your fruit might remain I want you to have something that sticks with you forever Paul said I'm speaking in tongues and more than you all I think it's wonderful I think it's all good if you've got word for it but if it's generated by somebody else's experience is second hand so we want to go past the initial preaching is to bring you the good news now it's your part to take the good news identify it and take possession of it so you can say I and the word are one and now we're getting into that invisible Union we're getting into that Capstone because Jesus says it's been freely given freely give now you can impart that scripture now you can impart eternal life because you've had that day on Calvary where the spirit of your sacrifice has returned back in you and he's quickened to you the word that he has just made alive in you and now you know that you and the word are one that's the greatest thing in the world Church there's there's nothing like it search the scripture read what the prophet of God said find yourself in the word find your experience in the word and when you do it becomes eternal and you'll never lose it but too many people lose it because they haven't tied it down you got me is it simple I want to make it simple and I want you to possess every joy that you have ever had Satan can steal from you everything that's not word because it's his but what's word is God's and ye are God's Little Children fear not because it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom God bless you tonight Lord be with you [Applause] percent and aren't you thankful for the word amen where would we have been if we didn't send his word and reveal it to us amen old gift those of us flowing oh and from a place called Calvary oh and there is here foreign [Music] [Music] otherwise [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh baby [Music] just came thank you all about this fall forward [Music] foreign [Music] all right I worship you I worship all you are here [Music] I worship you I worship you for when you are here [Music] I worship you oh I worship you always [Music] my God that is [Music] foreign [Music] really I worship you oh yeah [Music] oh I worship you always [Music] that is [Music] Jesus [Music] oh promise [Music] remember to Dylan if you're just coming to close our service tonight God bless you Lord I'm just thankful for the word that came forth tonight Lord on how to not just get Deliverance but keep it Lord that's important Lord It's lord it's just an important word that came forth tonight Lord I pray that it met the needs of the congregation Lord and I pray that they would go home and be able to find themselves in the scripture Lord to be able to identify themselves with the scripture that's so important Lord to be able to find our identity in the word and Lord we just ask that you bless everybody as they leave the sanctuary Lord give us safe travels back home Lord and we're just thankful for all of your blessings Lord we're thankful for the word that came forth this morning as well Lord we ask that you would protect brother Timothy as he goes to Germany Lord just be with him there Lord bless his ministry Lord we're just thankful for him Lord who assess your blessing on the rest of our time here Lord in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen amen amen don't forget the announcement this morning so if you uh you have time during the week or in the afternoons and you want to come and help there's always something to do amen so God bless you where this message God is good all the time amen oh if you walk around [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all the time [Music] God is good so God is good all the time [Music] thank you thank you thank you [Music] thank you foreign foreign [Music] foreign thank you foreign [Music] foreign thank you thank you foreign [Music]
