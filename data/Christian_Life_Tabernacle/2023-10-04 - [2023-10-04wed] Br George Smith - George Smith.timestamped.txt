[35:46] don't
[35:47] know my name is George Smith I come from
[35:51] Tennessee you may be
[35:55] seated
[35:59] it's a privilege to be with you again I
[36:01] was here last year and I've been in many
[36:03] places we're not going to go through the
[36:05] travel log but um I was in Australia a
[36:09] couple weeks ago and um glad to be here
[36:13] tonight and we trust that everybody can
[36:16] understand either English or the
[36:18] translation and um I would like to um
[36:21] say that a long time ago in
[36:25] 1964 brother brandom said that if things
[36:28] go on the way they are right now now
[36:29] whatever he was focusing I don't know
[36:31] but the confusion there was back then he
[36:34] said if things go on the way they are
[36:36] right now in 50 Years it'll be total
[36:39] idolatry Total
[36:43] Insanity now some of you didn't live
[36:45] that long but I have and from 2014 till
[36:50] now it's been Total
[36:53] Insanity everything is upside down it's
[36:56] not going back to normal no I didn't
[37:00] bring the level but you can imagine you
[37:01] see the cross down here see the cross up
[37:04] there well it's level okay and the the
[37:08] way to keep things level is the long
[37:10] part of the Cross is your prayer life if
[37:13] you put forth the effort and speak to
[37:16] the Creator he will help the other part
[37:19] to stay level so with this Total
[37:22] Insanity that we've got going
[37:24] on uh it breeds
[37:27] confusion now all of us you know we live
[37:30] in this 21st century and we see the
[37:32] confusion we try to make sense out of it
[37:35] it's impossible it's confusion so when
[37:38] you see a confusing issue you go the
[37:41] other way because you cannot fix it
[37:45] you're not smart enough you're not a
[37:47] prophet you cannot fix it so stay off
[37:50] the internet and don't think that you're
[37:51] going to help those people they're going
[37:53] to the hot place and they're not coming
[37:54] back so get your s ready for the Rapture
[37:58] that's
[37:59] simple and God is not the author of
[38:01] confusion that's the other power there's
[38:04] only two things there's God and there's
[38:07] Satan and you have a choice to make you
[38:11] see that's why you come to church and um
[38:14] so we're all about balance yes things
[38:16] have to be balanced these nice cars will
[38:18] get out
[38:19] here if one tire is not balanced you get
[38:22] a lousy ride if one valve isn't right
[38:25] all of it's got to be Bal balanced and
[38:28] so we've got four steps to to achieve
[38:31] balance and you've probably heard them
[38:33] before but you're going to hear it again
[38:35] because if I only come once a year then
[38:37] you probably
[38:39] forgot you have your Bible okay this is
[38:42] God in printed
[38:44] form you never put anything on top of
[38:47] your Bible no Prophet said that so you
[38:51] read at least one chapter out of your
[38:54] Bible every day start starting tonight
[38:58] one chapter you read one page out of
[39:00] your church age book and I don't want to
[39:02] hear no excuses we got some extra we can
[39:04] sell
[39:06] you and you listen to a minimum of 20
[39:08] minutes of the Prophet preaching and I
[39:12] don't want to hear no excuses you got
[39:14] lousy traffic here you're stuck don't
[39:17] start screaming at the other drivers CU
[39:19] you're all in the same
[39:21] line listen to The
[39:23] Prophet or you can also pray so those
[39:27] are the four steps you read your Bible
[39:29] read Church age book you listen to the
[39:31] prophet and you pray now you do that
[39:33] every day because see you've got 16
[39:35] hours in the day free right you're
[39:38] supposed to sleep eight hours so those
[39:40] 16 hours you can carve out a little
[39:43] piece to um do these things and you will
[39:48] have a more Balanced Life God will bless
[39:50] you God will bless the church and you'll
[39:52] have a better
[39:54] attitude okay
[39:57] now we're all aware of a lot of things
[40:01] going on in
[40:02] Israel this is God's program you don't
[40:06] have to take sides you don't have to act
[40:07] ugly or feel bad at anybody just watch
[40:10] it happen it's going to be very
[40:13] interesting it's going to be very long
[40:15] it's going to be very hot we had a trip
[40:18] planned for uh December but we cancel it
[40:21] because you can't take people into a war
[40:24] zone and so we know people over there
[40:26] we've talked to them they're fine right
[40:28] now but um we just hope that our leader
[40:32] that's over there now doesn't say too
[40:34] much because every time we try to tell
[40:37] Israel how to run their business we have
[40:39] a natural disaster because God's
[40:43] watching and so um he will take care of
[40:46] them there's going to be people die but
[40:49] this is war it's going to
[40:51] happen Okay the other announcement that
[40:53] I must bring to your attention uh
[40:56] my brother-in-law Billy Paul has been
[40:58] very very sick for many months he's been
[41:02] suffering with pancreatic cancer now his
[41:05] desire was that nobody know and just
[41:07] kind of slip away well it's not going to
[41:10] happen you know it's Billy Paul so he's
[41:13] now in the final stages he's in Hospice
[41:17] his wife has turned him loose Lord thy
[41:20] will be done so there's a lot of stuff
[41:23] on the internet but the truth is he's
[41:25] still alive but he won't last long so
[41:28] pray for his wife L pray for the
[41:31] family uh we don't know the mind of God
[41:34] we can only take one step at a time
[41:36] headed to the resurrection and stay
[41:38] balanced you can't I can't emphasize how
[41:41] important that is so tonight we're going
[41:43] to open our Bibles into the book of Acts
[41:47] and I know some of you oh we're going to
[41:48] study acts yeah we're going to study it
[41:50] again I ran into a real good preacher
[41:52] the other day he said I've never I've
[41:55] never studied the book of Acts you you
[41:57] can stay seated we're going to go
[41:58] through it slowly yeah stay seated we're
[42:00] not going to read the whole chapter but
[42:02] we're going to start with Acts chapter
[42:04] 10 and um uh this is the foundation this
[42:08] is this is where it all started this is
[42:10] our our church you know and in chapter
[42:13] nine we have where that Peter had been
[42:16] um over there and raised the dead her
[42:18] name was Tabitha also Dorcas same name
[42:22] and then it says that he stayed a few
[42:24] days with a man called Simon the Tanner
[42:27] this man tanned hides they used to do it
[42:29] right here in Fort Worth many years ago
[42:31] maybe they still do tan hides they use
[42:34] them that was his job and so while he's
[42:37] resting a few
[42:38] days meanwhile 40 Mi North in
[42:42] cesaria uh up the coast there was a
[42:44] gentile man a Believer man called
[42:47] Cornelius now Cornelius was in charge of
[42:50] the Italian regiment could could have
[42:53] been as many as 600 soldiers he was an
[42:55] important man
[42:57] and uh he had a vision from the Lord
[42:59] about 3:00 p.m. and his name was called
[43:02] from the other dimension now that if
[43:04] that's never happened to you well it
[43:06] might happen today or tomorrow but if
[43:08] your name is called from the other
[43:09] dimension you tend to pay attention it's
[43:12] happened to me so chapter 10 and verse
[43:15] three it says here he saw a vision
[43:19] evidently about the 9th hour which is 3
[43:21] p.m. and uh an angel of God coming into
[43:24] him saying unto him Cornelius there's
[43:26] his name called okay so it's pretty uh
[43:29] important and he looked on him he was
[43:32] afraid and he said what is it Lord and
[43:35] he said unto him thy prayers and thy
[43:37] alms are come up before Memorial before
[43:39] God and now you need to send three men
[43:43] that'll say it a little later you need
[43:45] to send these men to japa which is down
[43:47] south and call for one his name is Simon
[43:51] his last name is Peter and he gives him
[43:54] the address he's with Simon the Tanner
[43:56] his house is by the Sea why would why do
[43:59] you need him he shall tell thee what
[44:03] thou oughtest to do he had to have a
[44:06] preacher to expound to him the word of
[44:08] the Lord okay so now we know what side
[44:12] I'm on good so verse S he sends three
[44:15] trusted men down to japa just as the
[44:18] angel told him they took off they
[44:20] traveled through the night and they
[44:22] arrived about noon the next day okay now
[44:26] where's Peter he's up on top of the flat
[44:27] roofed house because it's cooler up
[44:30] there there's a breeze and he's up there
[44:33] meditating and
[44:35] um uh it was quiet and so downstairs
[44:39] they're fixing lunch so in verse 10 you
[44:42] know he's getting hungry while they're
[44:43] preparing lunch he's taken into a vision
[44:45] a supernatural experience because a Seer
[44:49] a prophet lives in two
[44:51] Dimensions okay now these things are
[44:53] important and they're in the message
[44:55] they're in scripture we're not making
[44:56] anything up so a Seer and a prophet same
[45:00] thing they live in this Dimension and
[45:02] they live in the other dimension but
[45:03] they're right here see if brother
[45:04] Brandon was here he could truthfully say
[45:07] that he sees 500 people here when
[45:10] there's only 161 maybe whatever so they
[45:15] they see more people they see angels and
[45:17] so forth and so he's in this having this
[45:21] experience and uh it's very natural for
[45:24] a prophet to enter into this
[45:26] Dimension and uh it's like when there's
[45:28] a when there's a construction zone you
[45:30] know they put up a plastic fence or
[45:32] something and to keep the nosy people
[45:34] out but a prophet can look over the
[45:36] fence and he sees what's going on now
[45:38] the challenge is how much of this do I
[45:40] tell them and what words do I use that's
[45:43] his Challenge and so it's his vision is
[45:47] for him and he will decide how and when
[45:50] he interprets it to the people you
[45:52] see so verse 11 and 12 gives us the the
[45:57] the vision that he saw just imagine a
[45:59] king-size sheet tied at the Four Corners
[46:02] it's coming down it's got all these
[46:04] animals in it okay all kinds of animals
[46:08] and um the fact is that God gave the
[46:10] Jewish people very strict dietary
[46:13] laws that's too bad he didn't give it to
[46:15] the to the Gentiles CU we might you know
[46:18] have be a little healthier but he gave
[46:21] these dietary laws to the Jews and um it
[46:25] was things they could eat things they
[46:26] should not eat and here's God showing an
[46:28] assemble with all these mixed animals
[46:31] he's showing something to his um uh
[46:34] Prophet the man with the Keys of the
[46:36] Kingdom and only he knew the
[46:40] interpretation if it was left up to us
[46:42] we'd have a 100 different
[46:44] interpretations but the interpretation
[46:46] was the Gospel is for everyone you know
[46:48] no more of this separating things and um
[46:51] it's not just for the Jewish people
[46:53] because see the the early church was
[46:55] mostly Jewish people Jesus told them
[46:57] only go to the house of Israel only only
[47:00] to our people and now here the things
[47:02] are changing okay and so um these laws
[47:06] were so ingrained in the people from
[47:08] from a child on up you do this you don't
[47:11] do that that this just the way they live
[47:13] it's a way of life there's still people
[47:14] today they have certain pots they can
[47:16] cook this in and other pots for this
[47:19] they have like two kitchens almost and
[47:21] so uh when we're over there you don't
[47:24] have the the product of the animal and
[47:27] the animal itself in other words if
[47:29] you're going to have if you're going to
[47:30] have brisket there's no butter for the
[47:32] corn there's no milk for the coffee you
[47:34] can't have the two together it's just
[47:35] one of their laws and so this is so
[47:37] ingrained in them that Peter what's he
[47:40] do you know he he he was converted he
[47:43] had he had the keys and he was full of
[47:45] the Holy Ghost he still had that mouth
[47:47] problem I'm sure nobody here has that
[47:50] same problem but you know he had it so
[47:52] in verse
[47:53] 13 the angel says to him r why Peter
[47:56] kill and eat and he says no no no I have
[48:00] never done such a thing no there's the
[48:02] common and the unclean and so forth and
[48:05] the voice spake to him a second time get
[48:07] a second chance Peter what God has
[48:09] cleansed don't you dare call it common
[48:12] God is in control not
[48:14] you and this was done three times okay
[48:18] so the voice speaks to him you know
[48:20] Peter pay attention this is not a debate
[48:23] this is serious three times
[48:26] and then division opened and closed and
[48:29] disappeared and Peter got the message
[48:31] okay so he's still arranging these new
[48:33] ideas it's this new order in his
[48:36] mind and these visitors show up at the
[48:38] gate downstairs they're knocking on the
[48:40] gate so then the Lord speaks to him he
[48:42] says now look you need to get yourself
[48:45] together get your hat on or whatever and
[48:47] go down because I sent three men to look
[48:50] for you and and they're looking for you
[48:52] so get down there okay so he goes down
[48:54] he opens the gate I I'm the one you're
[48:57] looking for how can I help you it's
[48:59] right there in your Bible and so they
[49:01] explained how God spoke to their
[49:03] commander and he was warned of God so he
[49:06] invited him in and um they uh they came
[49:09] in they spent the night the next day
[49:11] they started walking 40 miles probably
[49:14] nobody here walked 40 miles but you know
[49:16] some people do some people run well I
[49:19] don't run you know me and David we like
[49:21] a leather chair and
[49:24] so so they start walking and uh they um
[49:29] they got to uh they got to cesaria the
[49:31] next day and Cornelius was there waiting
[49:34] for him yeah and he called all his
[49:36] relatives in his close friends I mean he
[49:38] believed the vision you know stand for
[49:41] this guy he's going to tell you what you
[49:42] need to do so he calls all his friends
[49:44] in his
[49:45] relatives and when Peter came through
[49:47] the door this Fearless commander of you
[49:50] know all these soldiers he goes down on
[49:52] his knees wow this is really happening
[49:55] yeah
[49:56] and uh he falls down on his knees to
[49:58] worship this man of God the very person
[50:00] that the angel told him about you
[50:03] probably would too I mean a vision it's
[50:05] coming to pass well but see the thing is
[50:07] genuine Servants of God do not accept
[50:10] any kind of
[50:12] worship a birthday card is one thing we
[50:14] don't worship you know and so um of any
[50:18] kind so here's the man of God the
[50:20] spokesman for the Lord the man of the
[50:22] keys he had been used of God for many
[50:24] miracles that's true even raising the
[50:27] Tabitha a few days before and um even
[50:30] though Peter had made some mistakes
[50:32] argued with Jesus argued with the angel
[50:34] he was learning
[50:36] balance okay that's what he was learning
[50:40] it was hard but he was learning and he
[50:42] was teaching others this is the early
[50:44] church they had no New Testament their
[50:46] Bible was the Old Testament and at that
[50:49] time it was a 200y old translation and
[50:51] that's what they quoted and so the early
[50:54] church Peter Paul the rest of them they
[50:56] had a similar Ministry such as William
[50:59] brandom in the sense that they came and
[51:02] they said look all this that you guys
[51:03] memorize back here it's coming to pass
[51:06] this day these scriptures are being
[51:08] fulfilled now it was hard to turn the
[51:11] corner they've been used to this they've
[51:13] been used to you know the same same same
[51:15] but it's time to turn the
[51:17] corner and so that's where we're at
[51:19] tonight we're turning the corner we're
[51:20] headed towards the Rapture you have an
[51:23] opportunity to get ready the ones that
[51:26] decide to stay home watch TV they lost
[51:28] out but you're here so may God bless you
[51:32] so when he got inside there's all these
[51:35] people and the first thing he said was
[51:37] over here in verse 28 he said um you
[51:41] know that it's unlawful for me being a
[51:44] Jew to keep company with you of another
[51:47] nation that was the they had strict
[51:51] segregation the Americans you know we've
[51:53] decided in this day and age yeah we're
[51:55] going to just have seg you know
[51:56] integration well it's not worked out all
[51:58] that great especially in the world and
[52:00] the Believers it's different but over
[52:01] there they had this strict
[52:03] segregation and uh you couldn't even no
[52:06] those those are Heathen we're the people
[52:08] of God okay and um so from the vision
[52:12] before you know he had already had the
[52:14] the interpretation you know it's illegal
[52:16] for me to be here we have segregation
[52:18] but God has showed me a better way so he
[52:21] was expanding his comfort zone you see
[52:24] and you see God God gives the vision or
[52:26] the experience to the prophet and only
[52:29] the prophet can also provide the
[52:32] interpretation now I've been in this
[52:34] over 50 years and I know a lot of people
[52:37] that have spent their life they've
[52:39] wasted their life they've wore out the
[52:41] pencil sharpener they wasted their
[52:43] children figuring out prophet's Vision
[52:46] forget it it's the prophet's Vision God
[52:50] will give us what we need at the hour
[52:51] that we need it not a minute before you
[52:53] see so there's the sheet full of animals
[52:56] and God has shown me a better way nobody
[52:59] would ever figure it out it's his vision
[53:02] see so the prophet is the anointed
[53:04] vessel we're simply the repeaters you
[53:07] know declaring the manifestation of the
[53:09] prophet's prophecy brother B said it's
[53:12] coming to pass you see so same thing
[53:15] with Israel today all that's been
[53:17] prophesied God is in charge he doesn't
[53:19] need our opinions the sign says Be
[53:22] Still I'm God I got to figure it out
[53:24] don't need your opinions
[53:26] okay
[53:27] so um he doesn't acquire require
[53:31] opinions we can only be yielded flexible
[53:34] available and through human beings he
[53:37] will accomplish his perfect will and
[53:39] manifest himself to a dying generation
[53:42] we don't have to wear a sign no just be
[53:45] a Christian Billy Graham said when the
[53:47] Gospel of Jesus Christ is presented with
[53:49] authority quoting from the very word of
[53:51] God he then takes that message and
[53:53] drives it supernaturally into the human
[53:55] heart see that's where the the pastor
[53:58] gets a lot of his headaches he studies
[54:01] he sacrifices he preaches and people
[54:03] still dress the same they still do the
[54:06] same because they don't come to church
[54:08] correctly you come in here yielded yes
[54:11] Lord whatever you have to say I'm ready
[54:13] but we come in here with ideas you know
[54:15] it's got to be this way right no God
[54:18] will drive it into the heart we can only
[54:20] speak it you see okay so once he cleared
[54:23] the air you know Jews meeting
[54:25] Gentiles verse 29 why did you send for
[54:28] me H great question verse 30 and
[54:32] Cornelius said now four days ago you
[54:34] know I had this vision and so forth he
[54:36] relates to the whole deal and uh so they
[54:39] were totally ready for whatever he had
[54:41] to say they were prepared whatever
[54:43] they'd never heard of this this is a new
[54:46] message but an angel appeared you know
[54:49] and um so he uh he says we're ready no
[54:53] Prejudice no preconceived ideas whatever
[54:55] God has we want it so Peter preaches to
[54:58] a humble home meeting to Gentiles for
[55:02] the first time up to then only Jews okay
[55:06] so in 10 verses he gives the entire
[55:08] gospel message simple to the point look
[55:11] at verse 40 for example so he's talking
[55:14] about Jesus Christ all through here
[55:17] excuse me and God him God raised up from
[55:20] the on the third day and showed him
[55:22] openly now see nobody had ever heard of
[55:24] a res Resurrection before this this the
[55:26] first they hear about it now the Jews
[55:29] that were you know in the synagogue and
[55:31] had it all figured out and it's got to
[55:32] be this and this and this they were
[55:34] against this organized religion was
[55:36] against the message of the
[55:38] day but he says and showed him openly
[55:41] not to all the people thank you but unto
[55:43] Witnesses chosen before of God even to
[55:47] us who did eat and drink with him after
[55:49] he rose from the dead very interesting
[55:52] so you see God controls all the details
[55:56] 42 and he commanded us to preach unto
[55:59] the people and to testify that it is he
[56:03] which was ordained of God to be the
[56:04] judge of the quick and the dead to him
[56:06] give all the prophets witness that's why
[56:08] brother Brandon could say all through
[56:10] the Old Testament is Jesus Christ if you
[56:13] didn't see it go back and read it again
[56:15] so he's saying the same thing all the
[56:17] prophets give witness that through his
[56:20] name that's the key right there through
[56:23] his name whosoever believeth in him
[56:25] shall receive remission of
[56:28] sins okay so that is a very important uh
[56:32] point there through his name and um
[56:35] hopefully we'll have a study on that
[56:37] later but you see we have people today
[56:41] carrying the King James Bible carrying
[56:43] the tablet carrying the the spoken word
[56:45] books they're in pulpits tonight in
[56:48] certain places of this country and other
[56:50] places proving to the people that Jesus
[56:52] wasn't God oh they they got it figured
[56:55] out they're taking the deity out of the
[56:58] name of Jesus Christ and putting it over
[57:00] here in this teaching and that whatever
[57:03] doomed for failure it's happening okay
[57:07] but it's very important and so you see
[57:11] and um manifested in speaking different
[57:13] tongues magnified God even before they
[57:16] were baptized all the legalists had a
[57:18] problem because you're supposed to
[57:19] believe and they baptized then the Holy
[57:21] Ghost God can do
[57:23] anything am you know when I when I
[57:26] listen to the news I'm surprised that
[57:29] the sun comes up the next day cuz this
[57:31] whole thing could blow up in the next 30
[57:32] minutes it's that close so God can do
[57:35] anything you see and verse
[57:38] 47 is where that um uh let's see here
[57:42] Peter says now can any man forbid water
[57:44] that the should not be baptized which
[57:46] have received the Holy Ghost as well as
[57:48] we so he's remembering just a few days
[57:51] you know who knows I'm you know we don't
[57:53] know the time frame but it's it's
[57:54] shortly after the day of Pentecost and
[57:57] yeah that that happened to us here it is
[57:59] again Now can anyone forbid baptism and
[58:02] he commanded them to be baptized in the
[58:04] name of the Lord then prayed them they
[58:07] could stay there a few days okay so as
[58:10] you read through the book of Acts
[58:13] because you're going to do it right
[58:15] right yeah so you're going to read
[58:17] through the book of Acts you're not
[58:18] going to find any place that they
[58:21] repeated the red letter uh uh words of
[58:24] Jesus of Matthew
[58:26] 28:19 but they took the revelation of it
[58:29] in the name
[58:31] of see and that's why it's always in the
[58:34] name of the Lord like it says here okay
[58:38] so uh he uh he's with these people and
[58:42] um we uh we're going to go into chapter
[58:44] 11 because you know we got to wait till
[58:46] the traffic dies down before we can go
[58:47] home anyway we might as well be here
[58:50] stuck in traffic
[58:51] right so in chapter 11 and the apostles
[58:54] and Brethren that were in Judea heard
[58:56] that the Gentiles had also received the
[58:58] word of of God okay they didn't have
[59:00] cell phones they didn't have Telegraph
[59:03] they had nothing but somehow the news
[59:05] got there before Peter got there they
[59:07] heard what happened at cornelius's house
[59:10] and they should have been rejoicing to
[59:12] see the further fulfillment of Acts 1
[59:15] and8 you shall be my Witnesses here in
[59:17] Jerusalem or judia Samaria and all the
[59:20] way to Bedford Texas that's right the
[59:24] gospel didn't come in a parachute
[59:26] somebody came over here on a horse
[59:28] brought the gospel and we're rejoicing
[59:31] you know we got air conditioning we got
[59:32] nice seats and don't anybody think about
[59:34] going to sleep cuz I will get
[59:38] upset okay so um but see they were
[59:43] humans just like us they had religious
[59:46] segregation they had religious ideas
[59:49] even though they knew Jesus Christ and
[59:51] so forth you see the church is like a
[59:53] hospital nobody checks your credit card
[59:55] at the door nobody says if you got the
[59:57] right papers it's a hospital everybody's
[1:00:00] welcome visitors whoever and the gospel
[1:00:04] the word coming from the pulpit will
[1:00:07] make you comfortable to stay and get
[1:00:08] straightened out or chase you away we
[1:00:11] don't do that you know physically so um
[1:00:14] all are welcome and um so you see John
[1:00:18] 3:16 is still part of the word of God
[1:00:21] it's not just Billy Graham's message
[1:00:23] nobody is getting out of here
[1:00:25] without being born again receiving the
[1:00:28] Holy Ghost otherwise you'll stay for the
[1:00:29] tribulation okay it's just that simple
[1:00:32] because it says for God so loved the
[1:00:34] world now up to there it's the Pope's
[1:00:36] favorite scripture oh God so loved the
[1:00:38] world oh bring them all in doesn't
[1:00:40] matter what they look like what they're
[1:00:40] doing no no that he gave his only
[1:00:43] begotten son that whosoever believes oh
[1:00:46] they got to do something yeah believe on
[1:00:48] him should not perish but have
[1:00:50] everlasting life God loved us sinful
[1:00:53] creatures so much
[1:00:55] it's no small thing for God sent not his
[1:00:57] son into the world to condemn the world
[1:00:59] you know the club beat down everybody no
[1:01:01] but that the world through him might be
[1:01:03] saved it's God's provided way he that
[1:01:06] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[1:01:08] that believeth not is condemned already
[1:01:11] why because he has not believed what
[1:01:14] that God sent a prophet it doesn't say
[1:01:15] that has not believed the name of the
[1:01:18] only begotten Son of God you must
[1:01:21] believe you must take it serious Okay so
[1:01:25] verse two Peter you know arrives back in
[1:01:28] Jerusalem to face a scorching rebuke by
[1:01:31] some of the more narrow-minded
[1:01:33] Believers I'm sure you know a couple
[1:01:36] somewhere and since the news arrived
[1:01:38] first they had all their arguments ready
[1:01:42] their favorite quotes were underlined
[1:01:43] highlighted Peter was simply wrong
[1:01:46] there's just no other way about it you
[1:01:47] know in verse three you actually went
[1:01:50] into the house and you ate with those
[1:01:52] heathens what's wrong with you Peter
[1:01:55] Peter had the keys he had the Holy Ghost
[1:01:58] yet they're condemning him because he
[1:02:00] wasn't following the rules that they had
[1:02:01] figured out you see so when Peter you
[1:02:05] know he told his side of the story in
[1:02:07] detail it's verses
[1:02:09] 4-8 um you know he tells the whole story
[1:02:12] about you know this man had div Vision
[1:02:14] send men to chop and so forth now look
[1:02:16] at Verse 18 of chapter
[1:02:18] 11 and when they heard these things they
[1:02:20] held their peace oh so they heard the
[1:02:22] other side of the argument they calm
[1:02:24] down down and glorified God saying then
[1:02:27] hath God also to the Gentiles granted
[1:02:29] repentance unto life yeah the doors open
[1:02:31] for the Gentiles now okay so it gets a
[1:02:35] little better so we are over here in the
[1:02:39] 21st
[1:02:40] century we call ourselves Believers
[1:02:42] because we believe all the word we don't
[1:02:45] put any butts and no that's not right no
[1:02:48] there was an ark there was people going
[1:02:50] through the desert we're not doing that
[1:02:51] today because God's got his word section
[1:02:53] off into pieces we're over here in the
[1:02:56] back of the book where we're getting
[1:02:58] ready to go and all the signs around us
[1:03:00] are obvious you see and so we don't want
[1:03:04] to be like you know cafeteria Christians
[1:03:06] just take the the chocolate just the
[1:03:08] little pieces we like but we believe all
[1:03:10] the word you see and um uh brother Bram
[1:03:14] told us that the word all Dov Tales
[1:03:15] together and if it doesn't then read it
[1:03:18] again you can't go wrong reading your
[1:03:20] Bible this is our guide book you see so
[1:03:25] the angel that appeared to
[1:03:28] Cornelius um he could have told him the
[1:03:30] whole story he could have wrote a wall
[1:03:32] here coration you do this and this and
[1:03:33] this and this no he said go down there
[1:03:36] find this man bring him he'll tell you
[1:03:39] what to do yeah says right here verse 14
[1:03:43] I believe it is uh he shall tell thee
[1:03:45] the words whereby thou and all thy house
[1:03:49] shall be saved so they were ready they
[1:03:52] want to be saved they want they want to
[1:03:53] get with the program
[1:03:54] and you see God has put it in his word
[1:03:58] over here in Romans chapter U where is
[1:04:01] it chapter
[1:04:02] 10 uh the the plan that Noah the Baptist
[1:04:06] and everybody else they got it down path
[1:04:08] but it's for us also just because we're
[1:04:11] up here in the top of the pyramid we
[1:04:12] can't just throw part of it away no in
[1:04:15] in Romans 10 verse 9 if Thou shalt
[1:04:18] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:04:20] and shalt believe in thine heart that
[1:04:23] God hath raised him from the dead you
[1:04:25] will be saved simple formula verse 10
[1:04:29] for with the heart man believeth into
[1:04:30] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:04:32] confession is made into salvation for
[1:04:34] the scripture says you know in their old
[1:04:36] Bible whosoever believeth on him should
[1:04:39] not be ashamed and you're probably
[1:04:40] wondering where that is that's actually
[1:04:42] in Isaiah 28:16 okay says here for
[1:04:46] there's no difference between the Jew
[1:04:47] and the Greek that's what they were
[1:04:49] dealing with then so there's no
[1:04:51] difference between the American and the
[1:04:52] Mexican and the one from Congo and one
[1:04:55] from Canada no it's God over a whole
[1:04:57] thing you see that's why it says here
[1:05:00] for there's no difference between these
[1:05:02] for the same Lord uh over all is Rich to
[1:05:06] all that call on his name so for
[1:05:09] whosoever shall call upon his name on
[1:05:11] the name of the Lord shall be saved well
[1:05:13] that sounds good so far but how shall
[1:05:15] they call on him in whom they have not
[1:05:18] believed you got to you got to
[1:05:20] believe okay then we got to back the
[1:05:22] truck up a little further how shall they
[1:05:24] believe in him whom they have not
[1:05:27] heard so that's why these brothers going
[1:05:29] to Mexico my country yeah I was born
[1:05:31] down there um they're going to announce
[1:05:34] the gospel you see how shall they
[1:05:36] believe on whom they have not heard and
[1:05:38] how shall they hear without oh there it
[1:05:40] is preacher in the
[1:05:44] Bible I mean I didn't write the Bible
[1:05:47] but if we don't speak what it says how
[1:05:49] do we expect any blessing you you can't
[1:05:52] go north and get to San Antonio it
[1:05:53] doesn't
[1:05:55] work you got to go by the book okay and
[1:06:00] how shall they preach except they be
[1:06:02] sent as it is written how beautiful are
[1:06:04] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[1:06:06] of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good
[1:06:08] things okay so these people in cesaria
[1:06:12] were chosen of
[1:06:13] God uh they were elect of God but they
[1:06:16] needed help and God provided the help
[1:06:18] they needed it was his way his timing
[1:06:22] always every time on time now everybody
[1:06:26] here came to the knowledge of the Lord
[1:06:29] at a different time we all didn't come
[1:06:31] the same day and there's things said
[1:06:34] today maybe You' never heard before
[1:06:36] you're going to go out when you hear it
[1:06:37] again oh that's what brother George said
[1:06:39] so there's a time of accepting you see
[1:06:44] and God knows what you need when you
[1:06:47] need it that's why he calls you to
[1:06:49] church that's why you're building this
[1:06:51] new church which is beautiful and it's
[1:06:53] going to be lovely and I'll be back but
[1:06:56] for now here we are we're enjoying the
[1:06:58] service and God knows what he's doing
[1:07:00] now um because of you know a lot of
[1:07:04] things going on today I want to share
[1:07:06] five quotations with
[1:07:09] you the first one is uh the angel of God
[1:07:13] 1947 where brother Bram says now God
[1:07:15] could have sent the angel down just like
[1:07:17] here he sent the angel to Cornelius the
[1:07:19] angel could have told him the whole
[1:07:20] story no doesn't work that way he could
[1:07:24] have let the angel come himself but
[1:07:26] instead of that he sent an angel to
[1:07:28] speak through the voice of a man God
[1:07:30] always used man for his work is that
[1:07:32] right he doesn't use organization so
[1:07:34] forth or Mechanical Devices he uses
[1:07:37] men and Sunday school teachers and
[1:07:40] people's Godly lives you know okay 1950
[1:07:43] God and his people God does not fall on
[1:07:45] denominations God Falls not God does not
[1:07:48] fall upon Mechanical Devices the Holy
[1:07:50] Spirit fell on
[1:07:52] men I know you get tired of it but you
[1:07:55] remember when we were in school
[1:07:56] repetition oh and you finally caught on
[1:07:58] well that's what we're doing here
[1:08:00] conference 1960 God came down and the
[1:08:02] Conference was held how The Church Must
[1:08:04] Be run must it be run by a bishop
[1:08:06] organization some mechanical device how
[1:08:08] must it be run there was 120 in the
[1:08:10] emperor room that's where it
[1:08:11] started uh 1962 Behold a greater than
[1:08:14] Solomon God doesn't take an idol he
[1:08:17] takes a man and if a man will prostrate
[1:08:20] himself in the presence of God God then
[1:08:22] puts himself in that man amen and the
[1:08:24] man becomes a living creature that God
[1:08:26] is living in not a dead Idol but a man
[1:08:29] God never used Idols he always used
[1:08:33] men get it in God doesn't use Machinery
[1:08:37] Mechanical Devices he uses men okay so
[1:08:40] those few people out there that only
[1:08:42] want to hear what he said after 63 uh in
[1:08:45] God in Simplicity in 63 he always works
[1:08:47] in Simplicity but God in the beginning
[1:08:50] could have made the son to preach the
[1:08:52] gospel because I don't know if you
[1:08:54] noticed if you get up early enough the
[1:08:56] sun comes up right on
[1:08:58] time never
[1:09:01] fails and the scientists have figured it
[1:09:04] out to such a degree that they know when
[1:09:08] there's going to be an
[1:09:09] eclipse 30 years ahead because it's they
[1:09:12] can depend on
[1:09:13] it it doesn't depend on whether you know
[1:09:16] it feels like it or not the sun is
[1:09:17] always there the Moon is always there
[1:09:20] but God didn't use that or the winds or
[1:09:22] an angel he ordained men for that
[1:09:24] purpose and he never changes it so every
[1:09:27] believer listens to God's Prophet that
[1:09:30] that's our whole life I've been working
[1:09:32] with brother R's words for over 50 years
[1:09:34] and just get it in in in Spanish to
[1:09:36] where people can understand it well you
[1:09:38] know you remember the four steps I gave
[1:09:40] you but it doesn't require somebody from
[1:09:43] headquarters now on this day at this
[1:09:45] time you push the button that's
[1:09:48] organized religion that's not the way
[1:09:51] God operates I'm sorry you know so let's
[1:09:54] move on to more pleasant things here so
[1:09:58] here's the main man you know the man
[1:10:00] with the keys he's having a home meeting
[1:10:02] just a few people exactly like on the
[1:10:04] day of Pentecost and you know Jesus told
[1:10:07] them in in John
[1:10:08] 14:25 these things have I spoken to you
[1:10:11] being present with you but the comforter
[1:10:13] which is the Holy Ghost whom the father
[1:10:14] will s in my name he shall teach you all
[1:10:18] things and bring to your remembrance the
[1:10:20] things I told you we need the holy ghost
[1:10:24] in our life it's not optional not if you
[1:10:26] feel like it not if the you know stars
[1:10:28] are just right no you need the Holy
[1:10:31] Ghost so when the narrow-minded
[1:10:33] Believers heard the whole story they
[1:10:35] quieted down wow this is for everyone
[1:10:38] not just us because the master told him
[1:10:40] in Mark 8:34 who Serv will come after me
[1:10:44] and deny himself take up his cross and
[1:10:46] follow me the gospel is for whosoever
[1:10:49] will that's right there's no segregation
[1:10:51] with God you know he knows what he's
[1:10:53] doing doing okay so God knows who the
[1:10:56] elect are I don't know who they are now
[1:10:59] I hate to tell you but the fact is
[1:11:01] there's three kinds of Believers in
[1:11:02] every group of people I see some people
[1:11:05] going to sleep back there where's my I
[1:11:07] didn't bring my
[1:11:08] level I might throw
[1:11:13] something but there's three kinds of
[1:11:15] Believers in every crowd I don't know
[1:11:17] who you are we're all fine right here
[1:11:21] but when you go out of here and you're
[1:11:23] drinking coffee and probably eating too
[1:11:26] much pie or
[1:11:27] something yeah baldheaded preacher and
[1:11:30] that baldheaded
[1:11:32] Pastor you know all those kind of
[1:11:35] comments they won't know who you are
[1:11:37] yeah so don't worry about the person
[1:11:39] next to you who are you you see okay so
[1:11:44] God knows who the elect I don't know who
[1:11:45] they are you know we cast The Net God
[1:11:47] puts it in their heart okay so meanwhile
[1:11:50] in verse
[1:11:51] 19 we focus on those that were scattered
[1:11:55] after the death of Steven and if you
[1:11:57] remember we covered that before but
[1:11:59] these people saw that people getting
[1:12:02] killed for following this way so they
[1:12:04] picked up stuff and they they went to
[1:12:07] other places to raise their family um
[1:12:09] they traveled far away they went to
[1:12:11] Lebanon course you see their world was
[1:12:13] very small Marco polar hadn't been born
[1:12:16] yet they they didn't know it was a round
[1:12:18] ball out here and the people over there
[1:12:20] no they they the world was small so they
[1:12:23] went far away to Lebanon 120 Mi North
[1:12:26] they sailed all the way over to Cypress
[1:12:27] 150 Mi they went up to Turkey which is
[1:12:30] Antioch 300 Mi they went seeking
[1:12:33] someplace less dangerous to raise their
[1:12:35] family and um when they settled they
[1:12:38] settled in an a a Jewish Community you
[1:12:41] know and um they started testifying yeah
[1:12:45] where didd you come from what happened
[1:12:46] to you what's going on down there so
[1:12:47] they started testifying and um uh they
[1:12:51] stayed with their own own kind but you
[1:12:53] see see from chapter 2 we learned that
[1:12:56] Jews were
[1:12:57] everywhere because you see on the day of
[1:13:01] Pentecost Jesus told them now you guys
[1:13:03] need to go up to the upper room and wait
[1:13:05] until he didn't tell them how many days
[1:13:08] he didn't tell them exactly what's going
[1:13:09] to happen you'll know it when it happens
[1:13:11] so there they are 10 days but they
[1:13:14] didn't know how long so day one two and
[1:13:16] so forth at the same time there's people
[1:13:19] gathered in Jerusalem from all these
[1:13:21] countries because in the old Testament
[1:13:24] we had seven different Feast occasions
[1:13:27] throughout the year and on three of
[1:13:29] those occasions all the male Believers
[1:13:32] must come to Jerusalem and you know
[1:13:35] worship it just so happened that there
[1:13:37] was an overlay while these 10 days are
[1:13:38] going on these six days are going on too
[1:13:41] and so when the 10 days are up they're
[1:13:43] all still there and they come out and
[1:13:45] they're speaking languages that these
[1:13:46] people understand because in the church
[1:13:49] their Bible is in Hebrew so they all
[1:13:52] spoke Hebrew all for all over the world
[1:13:54] they still do but they spoke the
[1:13:56] language where they come from so they
[1:13:58] were at least
[1:13:59] bilingual and so when these guys come
[1:14:02] out of the upper room stumbling around
[1:14:05] and speaking this other language
[1:14:07] somebody there were 16 different
[1:14:08] languages they were speaking and they
[1:14:10] heard him in their language but with a
[1:14:12] Galilean accent it's like when people
[1:14:14] come from Canada you know you know they
[1:14:17] didn't wasn't born here and so they had
[1:14:19] this accent and that was what was going
[1:14:21] on on the day of Pentecost okay
[1:14:24] so um some of them spoke Greek they in
[1:14:28] verse 20 Cyprus is still Cyprus uh
[1:14:31] sirene is now Libya and of course these
[1:14:34] places are in in the news all the time
[1:14:36] and let's see what it says in verse 21
[1:14:39] of chapter
[1:14:40] 11 um for if God spared not the natural
[1:14:44] branches take heed lest he also spare
[1:14:47] not thee and so God was blessing the
[1:14:50] testimonies all you have to do is let
[1:14:52] your light shine you don't have to put a
[1:14:54] sign out Believers live here or whatever
[1:14:57] you know the people from from out in
[1:14:59] Salt Lake City they got the little sign
[1:15:01] you know Elder so and so Elder are you
[1:15:03] kidding me the 21 years old and um yeah
[1:15:07] you've seen them do you realize that
[1:15:09] those those people that are that are
[1:15:11] going out like that they say they're
[1:15:12] missionaries they go some foreign
[1:15:13] country for two years their family has
[1:15:16] to put up $10,000 for that to happen in
[1:15:18] the first place it's ridiculous so all
[1:15:21] you got to do is let your light shine
[1:15:22] naturally God will do the
[1:15:25] supernatural because every piece of the
[1:15:27] puzzle is important God knows where it
[1:15:29] belongs okay so when the apostles at
[1:15:32] Jerusalem heard about the Revival in
[1:15:34] these far away places they sent Barnabas
[1:15:37] now Barnabas is the son of encouragement
[1:15:40] and that's what he did he went to
[1:15:41] encourage um let's see here where we at
[1:15:44] verse 11 chapter 11 verse
[1:15:48] 23
[1:15:51] uh no but anyway he he went over there
[1:15:55] to encourage them and they um they had
[1:15:58] great time in the meantime Paul went
[1:16:00] back to his place entire SST to be his
[1:16:02] family and then uh uh Barnabas went to
[1:16:07] find him and they
[1:16:11] um they uh were they came back to to
[1:16:15] Antioch and they were with the Believers
[1:16:18] there had a great time and the Believers
[1:16:22] were first called
[1:16:24] Christians at Antioch you know and
[1:16:28] reason I can't find it I'm still here in
[1:16:29] Romans yeah in Acts chap 11
[1:16:35] 26
[1:16:37] um and when he found him he brought him
[1:16:39] to Antioch and it came to pass the whole
[1:16:42] year for a whole year they assembled
[1:16:43] themselves with the church and taught
[1:16:45] much people and the disciples were
[1:16:46] called Christians first at Antioch you
[1:16:49] see so the term church was first used
[1:16:53] over in chapter 8 Saul made Havoc of the
[1:16:55] church and other places but these were
[1:16:58] simply local Gatherings of Believers of
[1:17:01] like Faith they didn't have a building
[1:17:03] like this oh they in their home under a
[1:17:05] tree in the park whatever only in the
[1:17:07] 4th century did the church mean did the
[1:17:10] word mean a building you see so in
[1:17:13] forming a church these early Christians
[1:17:15] did not drop out of society and you know
[1:17:17] go off and have a commun someplace um
[1:17:20] they didn't form congregations that
[1:17:22] competed one another for members it was
[1:17:24] a radical powerful New Concept driven by
[1:17:27] the power of the Holy Ghost which
[1:17:28] dominated their lives a holy ghost was
[1:17:31] obvious you see and so the people in the
[1:17:34] street called them Christians because
[1:17:36] they live the life of
[1:17:38] Christ can they say that about you
[1:17:40] wherever you go tomorrow oh there goes a
[1:17:43] Christian or there goes somebody that
[1:17:44] stole some money or that guy stole the
[1:17:46] other guy's wife you know no Christians
[1:17:49] you see and like the methodists you know
[1:17:52] why they call call a Methodist because
[1:17:54] they came along and established a
[1:17:56] methodical way of worship it was there
[1:17:59] was a method so they called a Methodist
[1:18:01] and just like here at first it was a a
[1:18:04] word of uh derision you know oh those
[1:18:07] Christians but it stuck because they do
[1:18:11] live the life of
[1:18:12] Christ but I think I mentioned once
[1:18:14] before in the Catholic Church there's a
[1:18:16] certain saint that some of you remember
[1:18:19] Francis of a remember that okay so
[1:18:23] Francis of AIS was a Italian priest he
[1:18:27] preached the gospel brother brandom said
[1:18:29] so and so one of the things he said
[1:18:32] preach always use words when necessary
[1:18:36] yeah like when you're driving when
[1:18:38] you're shopping when you're in
[1:18:41] school you got to love those that don't
[1:18:43] love you that's when they know you're a
[1:18:45] Christian you know so they were called
[1:18:49] of the way uh in the beginning they were
[1:18:52] mostly Jewish but here to Antioch it was
[1:18:54] Multicultural there was all kinds of
[1:18:55] people so it was no longer enough to
[1:18:57] call them Jews Greeks or Romans they had
[1:19:00] a central theme Christ and that was at
[1:19:02] first kind of a put down but um it
[1:19:05] caught on and the church in Antioch was
[1:19:09] growing and from Jerusalem it came down
[1:19:12] prophets to visit him you know one of
[1:19:15] them was called agabus and he gave
[1:19:17] warning that a famine was coming see a
[1:19:20] prophecy is something serious it's not
[1:19:23] the Lord is coming and no it's got to be
[1:19:24] something really serious and so it did
[1:19:28] come and you can check history and read
[1:19:30] about Emperor Claudius Caesar the fourth
[1:19:32] emperor of Rome very bad ruler and
[1:19:34] during his time there was a famine and
[1:19:37] that's when he expelled the Jews and
[1:19:38] some of the Christians from Rome but in
[1:19:41] the first show of Brotherly kindness
[1:19:43] that we have in the Bible the church at
[1:19:45] Antioch sent missionary money to up to
[1:19:49] Jerusalem okay by the hands of Paul and
[1:19:53] uh Barnabas to the Saints in Judea that
[1:19:56] were hurting now these people lived
[1:19:57] their Christianity it wasn't just you
[1:20:00] know me and know God bless you and see
[1:20:01] you later no they actually shared they
[1:20:04] actually sacrificed for each other you
[1:20:06] know and like brother Ram says eternal
[1:20:08] life is living for others so that others
[1:20:12] can see Christianity in action you know
[1:20:16] and it wasn't just quoting and arguing
[1:20:18] but they really cared for one another
[1:20:20] and the Word was manifesting in their
[1:20:22] lives and the followers and Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] was alive they could actually you know
[1:20:27] they didn't have their Bible to quote
[1:20:28] from but Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:20:31] today and forever we are in the Forever
[1:20:34] part now we we passed yesterday pass now
[1:20:37] it's today so he was very alive in the
[1:20:41] first century because people believe and
[1:20:43] totally yielded to the spirit of God
[1:20:46] John 13:35 says by this shall all men
[1:20:50] know that you're my disciples because
[1:20:52] because you go to a certain nice Church
[1:20:54] up on Central Avenue because you all
[1:20:56] Drive nice cars no because you have love
[1:20:59] one to the other they notice that
[1:21:02] because they don't have that they speak
[1:21:05] about nonsense and they have their
[1:21:06] parties and their stuff but when they
[1:21:08] see people that actually care for each
[1:21:10] other actually send money to the foreign
[1:21:12] field to help those people those people
[1:21:15] really care so um do we have time for a
[1:21:19] few more
[1:21:21] verses yeah there's no fee in the
[1:21:23] parking right if the Rapture yeah if the
[1:21:26] Rapture comes good yeah okay so chapter
[1:21:29] 12 this is
[1:21:31] interesting chapter 12 says now about
[1:21:34] that time well all this is going on over
[1:21:36] here that we just talked about Herod the
[1:21:38] king stretched forth his hands to Vex
[1:21:41] certain of the church that means put the
[1:21:42] pressure on them make their life
[1:21:44] miserable that's what Vex means okay so
[1:21:47] this King Herod there's seven different
[1:21:50] family members in the herodian family in
[1:21:51] Scripture it's another study they were
[1:21:54] all
[1:21:55] anti-god evil backed by headquarters in
[1:21:57] Rome this here is head uh Herod agria he
[1:22:02] was feeling all powerful you know his
[1:22:05] normal arrogant self full of himself and
[1:22:08] thought it would be pleasing to his
[1:22:09] Jewish subjects to put some pressure on
[1:22:12] the
[1:22:12] Christians H verse
[1:22:15] two and he killed James the brother of
[1:22:19] John with a sword and see we've heard
[1:22:21] about it this week week how they've
[1:22:23] beheaded people over there okay it
[1:22:26] sounds terrible but there's no suffering
[1:22:29] instantly you're dead heads on the
[1:22:32] ground and that's what they did back
[1:22:34] here they've been doing it for centuries
[1:22:37] and
[1:22:38] so uh this is John uh James the brother
[1:22:41] of John the two sons of Zebedee and this
[1:22:44] is now the fifth persecution of the
[1:22:45] early church so from history James son
[1:22:49] of Zebedee was a fisherman by trade when
[1:22:52] Jesus called him and his brother to uh a
[1:22:54] lifetime of ministry okay as a strong
[1:22:57] leader of the church James was
[1:22:59] ultimately beheaded at Jerusalem the
[1:23:01] Roman officer who guarded James watched
[1:23:04] and was amazed as James defended his
[1:23:06] faith at his trial later the officer
[1:23:09] walking beside James to the place of
[1:23:11] execution overcome by conviction that's
[1:23:15] Holy Ghost conviction he saw this
[1:23:18] man you know defend the faith yes I will
[1:23:23] not recant I will stick with the truth
[1:23:25] and he's his job is to you know walk
[1:23:28] beside him so they're walking to the out
[1:23:30] there where they're going to execute him
[1:23:31] overcome by conviction he declared his
[1:23:34] new Faith to the judge and knelt beside
[1:23:36] James to also accept beheading as a
[1:23:40] Christian these people were not playing
[1:23:43] Church it wasn't convenient it was the
[1:23:47] end cuz once your head comes off you're
[1:23:50] finished I don't know if you've seen the
[1:23:52] film
[1:23:53] but there is a u it's on DVD and so
[1:23:56] forth Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ very
[1:24:00] very close to scripture it was in the
[1:24:02] theaters even so in verse three when
[1:24:05] Herod saw this action what cutting off
[1:24:07] heads was popular with the followers it
[1:24:09] made him look good you know he decided
[1:24:11] to go for the main man the one with the
[1:24:14] keys and so he probably heard some of
[1:24:16] the testimonies how God protected his
[1:24:18] people and look at
[1:24:20] 12:4 and when he had apprehended him so
[1:24:23] he arrested he sent guys out okay arrest
[1:24:25] that one with the keys he put him in
[1:24:28] prison and delivered him to four guonian
[1:24:32] of soldiers to keep him intending after
[1:24:35] Easter to bring him forth to the people
[1:24:39] okay so he's arrested Peter got him in
[1:24:43] prison and it's a big word there but it
[1:24:45] means 16 soldiers now these weren't
[1:24:48] soldiers like this guy on the front row
[1:24:50] now these soldiers probably look more
[1:24:51] like Billy
[1:24:54] wellfed you know work out every day you
[1:24:58] know right he wish he
[1:25:02] did they were tough looking guys 16
[1:25:05] soldiers to watch one
[1:25:07] preacher see how that worked
[1:25:10] out so here's Peter in prison and uh now
[1:25:14] at the meantime while he's in prison
[1:25:15] down in John Mark's house they got a
[1:25:17] prayer chain going at 24 hours while
[1:25:20] they're praying you know and so he's in
[1:25:22] prison and he's chained on either side
[1:25:25] to two of these soldiers so there's two
[1:25:27] of them and there's 14 more guarding the
[1:25:29] gates okay and so here's God's main man
[1:25:33] sleeping in the Roman prison chained
[1:25:34] between two big soldiers and um they um
[1:25:39] uh on a certain day after the weekend
[1:25:41] after Easter and so forth Herod you know
[1:25:43] worked into his busy schedule to have
[1:25:45] Peter come up for execution take his
[1:25:48] head off but just hours before dur
[1:25:52] during the night Peter's sleeping there
[1:25:54] soundly he's not squirming and no he
[1:25:58] knows God's in control and so he's
[1:26:02] sleeping soundly chained between these
[1:26:04] soldiers and all of a sudden an angel
[1:26:06] appeared in a bright light yeah and the
[1:26:09] angel touched him barely touched him
[1:26:12] woke him up get up quickly chains fell
[1:26:15] off but the solders stayed asleep the
[1:26:18] chains are still on the soldiers only
[1:26:19] they fell off of him so he gets up
[1:26:22] they're all still asleep he gets up and
[1:26:26] uh the angel says in verse 8 get dressed
[1:26:27] put on your sandals put on your coat
[1:26:30] follow me so he's following the angel
[1:26:32] through the prison he looks back and
[1:26:33] there's those two soldiers still asleep
[1:26:35] they're going out and um they go to the
[1:26:38] Iron Gate it opened by itself past
[1:26:42] another gate and they get up out to the
[1:26:44] street and they go up to the corner and
[1:26:46] the angel
[1:26:47] disappeared yeah look at verse 11 of
[1:26:49] chapter
[1:26:50] 12 and when Peter was come to himself he
[1:26:54] said now I know of assurity that the
[1:26:56] Lord has sent his Angel and has
[1:26:58] delivered me out of the hand of Herod
[1:27:00] and from the expectations of the people
[1:27:03] of the Jews okay so he made his way down
[1:27:06] to the house where they were
[1:27:08] praying remember 24/7 boy they are
[1:27:11] serious Lord help our brother he's over
[1:27:13] in that filthy prison we need him he's
[1:27:15] your servant and they're just man
[1:27:16] they're praying we don't know how many
[1:27:18] people but there's probably a dozen or
[1:27:20] more and so um he's out there knocking
[1:27:23] on the gate you know out at the street
[1:27:25] he's beating on the gate they's busy
[1:27:27] praying but there was one girl named Roa
[1:27:30] and she was uh one of those people
[1:27:32] that's always busy you know serving the
[1:27:34] coffee or the tea and you know
[1:27:35] somebody's got to clean up the mess and
[1:27:37] she was kind of praying silently but
[1:27:39] anyway she was busy and um so she she
[1:27:43] hears the knocking and she goes to
[1:27:45] respond and she hears Peter's voice but
[1:27:49] she goes back to tell them Peter's there
[1:27:51] he's he's right
[1:27:53] outside now honey you're just excited in
[1:27:57] fact you're
[1:27:59] crazy she insisted argued with him okay
[1:28:02] maybe it's his
[1:28:04] Angel they were so busy praying so
[1:28:08] concerned but without enough Faith to
[1:28:10] believe for an answer how many times
[1:28:13] have we been there Lord you know I need
[1:28:15] that ,000 and you keep keep hey okay you
[1:28:18] said it God heard you the first time now
[1:28:20] wait for the answer
[1:28:22] so we get so caught up in the dos and
[1:28:24] the don'ts mechanics of the word we fail
[1:28:28] to see the uh the
[1:28:30] Fulfillment so we and we get really
[1:28:32] upset when people can't see things our a
[1:28:36] little narrow peculiar way this is the
[1:28:38] way it's going to be we don't step back
[1:28:40] and look at the big picture you know so
[1:28:43] meanwhile Peter's out there beating on
[1:28:45] the gate hey folks you know I'm here and
[1:28:47] um and so finally they opened the gate
[1:28:50] they saw him they're very surprised
[1:28:53] wow what are you doing
[1:28:55] here well You' all been
[1:28:57] praying oh my so he came in he gave a
[1:29:00] brief testimony well meanwhile back at
[1:29:02] the prison now the sun's coming up you
[1:29:04] know kind of some confusion and they
[1:29:07] really got worried okay 12 and verse 19
[1:29:11] and when Herod had
[1:29:14] uh you know called for him and they
[1:29:17] found him not he examined the keepers so
[1:29:20] 16 guys and commanded that they should
[1:29:23] be put to death well why is
[1:29:26] that well because see not believing in
[1:29:30] the Supernatural he didn't believe in
[1:29:32] Supernatural and with no good
[1:29:34] explanation the guards must have let him
[1:29:36] go it has to be their fault the preacher
[1:29:38] got
[1:29:39] away and so all their heads came
[1:29:43] off I mean that's the way they did
[1:29:45] business back
[1:29:46] then so verses 20- 23 you know Herod had
[1:29:51] a lot of difficulties with the
[1:29:52] administration there were complaints so
[1:29:55] he took some time off went down to his
[1:29:56] Seaside home we can still see part of it
[1:29:59] when we go over there and uh he he
[1:30:01] scheduled a certain day dressed in his
[1:30:04] best outfit and he's going to speak to
[1:30:06] his people you know and so he was a real
[1:30:09] spokesman they were so proud of their
[1:30:11] leader his tremendous abilities and they
[1:30:14] said it's like God speaking to us not
[1:30:16] just a man he was very proud and
[1:30:19] arrogant and indeed anointed with a
[1:30:22] spirit look what happened in 12 and 23
[1:30:26] and immediately the angel of the Lord
[1:30:27] smote him because he gave not God the
[1:30:30] glory and he was eaten of worms and gave
[1:30:33] up the ghost now see we're all sitting
[1:30:35] here comfortably the air conditioner is
[1:30:37] just right everybody had supper
[1:30:39] everybody had coffee see this guy he
[1:30:42] died and the the worms start eating him
[1:30:46] amazing so we don't play around with God
[1:30:49] never play around with God you see um
[1:30:52] now there's a a testimony and those of
[1:30:55] you that remember but uh I think about
[1:30:58] four or five years ago there was a a man
[1:31:00] over in Congo and he was at one time he
[1:31:03] was a good gospel preacher but see he
[1:31:05] got out of balance and when you get out
[1:31:07] of balance you're going to have problems
[1:31:09] and he got out so out of balance he
[1:31:11] started teaching that William Brandon
[1:31:12] was greater than Jesus Christ he out of
[1:31:15] balance and he started preaching that
[1:31:17] stuff and so one day he's out there
[1:31:20] preaching it and he takes the the the
[1:31:22] picture of Hoffman rips it and Stomps on
[1:31:25] it
[1:31:26] yeah he said and if I'm not telling the
[1:31:29] truth may God strike me dead and down he
[1:31:32] goes dead right there so they they
[1:31:35] picked him up and trying to get him to
[1:31:36] his village to B you know bury him and
[1:31:39] the worms were already eaten him they
[1:31:41] had to bury him on the way yeah that
[1:31:43] happened in our our time just like this
[1:31:45] back
[1:31:47] here God says in Exodus 34:14 Thou shalt
[1:31:50] for Thou shalt wor worship no other God
[1:31:53] for the Lord whose name is jealous
[1:31:55] that's something you can take home with
[1:31:57] you one of God's names is
[1:32:00] jealous he's a jealous God Deuteronomy
[1:32:03] 4:24 for the Lord thy God is a consuming
[1:32:05] fire even a jealous
[1:32:08] God Isaiah 428 I am the Lord thy God I
[1:32:12] am the Lord that is my name and my glory
[1:32:14] will I not give to another neither any
[1:32:16] praise to graven images it's real
[1:32:19] serious Galatians 6 be not deceived God
[1:32:23] is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth
[1:32:26] that will he will also reap for if a man
[1:32:28] Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh
[1:32:30] reap corruption but he that sth to the
[1:32:32] spirit shall of the spirit reap life
[1:32:34] life Everlasting so as humans we make
[1:32:37] choices every day you're looking at one
[1:32:40] person I'm looking at all the different
[1:32:41] colors and you know you all decided what
[1:32:44] color to wear some wor High some didn't
[1:32:47] some didn't even comb their hair so I
[1:32:48] see all that you know so we made choices
[1:32:52] but you made the right choice you came
[1:32:54] to hear another portion of the word of
[1:32:56] God yeah we need to line up you know so
[1:33:00] we must get in the spirit of God giving
[1:33:02] God all the honor because other people
[1:33:04] made other choices you know so I'm
[1:33:07] thankful that you all made a sacrifice
[1:33:09] you said hey it's important yeah it's
[1:33:11] real
[1:33:12] important and so when I come back and
[1:33:14] we're in that other church I want to see
[1:33:16] it
[1:33:17] full okay so when we finish chapter 11
[1:33:21] Saul and barab us you know taking the
[1:33:22] missionary offering to the Saints in
[1:33:23] Jerusalem and here at the end of chapter
[1:33:25] 12 they came back and they returned to
[1:33:28] Antioch so that is our scripture lesson
[1:33:31] for tonight we hope somebody got
[1:33:33] something out of it that you can take
[1:33:36] something home if it's not in your
[1:33:38] language if it's not plain we're wasting
[1:33:41] time and so you all of you have the
[1:33:44] church age book that we uh put out with
[1:33:47] the paragraph numbers and so forth I've
[1:33:49] done the same thing with the seal book I
[1:33:51] have a few with me we're going to send
[1:33:53] more but it's in a more readable fashion
[1:33:57] may God bless
[1:34:04] you it makes you want to bring it to
[1:34:06] yourself individually don't it you know
[1:34:09] and the the secret is the prophet of God
[1:34:11] said that this bride should have a book
[1:34:13] of Acts written behind it but that takes
[1:34:17] it's not the church like the group
[1:34:21] because God don't deal with groups he
[1:34:23] deals with individuals but it's every
[1:34:26] individual consecrating their life so
[1:34:30] the Holy Spirit can move and lead them
[1:34:34] and then he's the great conductor and he
[1:34:38] takes all the little parts that he leads
[1:34:40] you puts them all together and then you
[1:34:43] start seeing the supernatural working
[1:34:46] amongst us without any one individual
[1:34:50] getting the credit and him getting all
[1:34:52] the
[1:34:53] glory but it's like we're all
[1:34:57] pieces of a puzzle and he's putting
[1:35:00] those pieces of this puzzle together and
[1:35:03] dealing with each of the heart and if
[1:35:05] each of us would play our part he'll
[1:35:09] draw the picture and so we really do
[1:35:13] that we'll get some of the uh seals
[1:35:16] books uh and get them into the library
[1:35:19] so you can be able to pick them up
[1:35:22] uh through the library you just need to
[1:35:25] talk to Juliet and then she can work all
[1:35:29] that out with you out of the library you
[1:35:32] love the
[1:35:33] Lord amen remember the carnal mind is IM
[1:35:38] with God but the spiritual mind is life
[1:35:42] and and if if you can believe all things
[1:35:46] are possible let your mind embrace the
[1:35:49] supernatural let the holy Spirit bring
[1:35:52] it alive in your life and make the word
[1:35:55] live and you for your own personal self
[1:35:58] will be able to look at the book of Acts
[1:36:01] for these signs shall follow them that
[1:36:04] believe the believer doesn't create them
[1:36:07] they simply follow a spirit filled life
[1:36:12] full of love full of
[1:36:15] enthusiasm not ashamed of the
[1:36:18] Gospel amen because it's the glory of
[1:36:21] God it's the way of Salvation and we're
[1:36:25] not ashamed of it God bless you tonight
[1:36:27] let's stand together and have a word of
[1:36:30] prayer let's just bow our heads and
[1:36:34] maybe you just look at your life right
[1:36:38] now and ask
[1:36:43] yourself do I see God moving in my
[1:36:48] life do I see myself growing growing
[1:36:52] and increasing in the knowledge of Jesus
[1:36:56] Christ because the scripture says that
[1:36:58] you might increase in the knowledge of
[1:37:00] the Lord
[1:37:01] Jesus do you have
[1:37:05] Revelation for Faith
[1:37:08] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:37:11] word of
[1:37:13] God and ask yourself is he alive in my
[1:37:16] life am I moving
[1:37:18] up am I growing am I involv D am I
[1:37:22] hungry am I thirsty for the things of
[1:37:26] God do I want to see the angels of the
[1:37:29] Lord that are promised to be encamped
[1:37:32] about them that believe do I want to see
[1:37:35] them working on my behalf and come out
[1:37:38] of the carnal mindset and get into the
[1:37:42] spiritual realm where you can say in
[1:37:44] your heart all things are possible
[1:37:47] nothing can pluck me out of the palm of
[1:37:50] his hand and if he had started a good
[1:37:52] work in me he'll finish it the end my
[1:37:56] sheep hear my voice and another they
[1:37:58] won't
[1:37:59] follow and you've purposed your life to
[1:38:02] be based upon what the scripture said
[1:38:06] not
[1:38:08] circumstances not fears and fiery darts
[1:38:12] of the
[1:38:13] enemy but you've rested in the Eternal
[1:38:16] Word of God and that's your hope that's
[1:38:20] your trust
[1:38:22] that's the hope of glory Christ in us
[1:38:24] the hope of glory and if the same spirit
[1:38:28] that dwelt in him dwelleth in US it too
[1:38:31] will Quicken our mortal bodies and Lord
[1:38:34] that's what we want we don't want to
[1:38:36] talk about
[1:38:37] it we want to know it we want to feel it
[1:38:41] in our lives we want to see the love of
[1:38:43] God shed abroad we want to see the love
[1:38:47] that comes from our heart as it strikes
[1:38:49] others we want to see the effect of this
[1:38:53] love we want to see the effect of our
[1:38:55] candle being
[1:38:57] lit we want to Fe see the effect of us
[1:39:00] being
[1:39:01] salty we don't want to leave it on the
[1:39:03] Shelf we don't want to leave it in our
[1:39:05] home we don't want to leave it in church
[1:39:08] but we want to go out for no man lith a
[1:39:12] candle and set it under a basket or a
[1:39:16] church but he sets it on the hill that
[1:39:19] the light might shine that we could
[1:39:22] glorify Our Father by our good work Lord
[1:39:26] might we purpose in our hearts to get
[1:39:28] involved in
[1:39:30] Christianity involved in the scripture

[1:39:37] as our messenger so has guided us back
