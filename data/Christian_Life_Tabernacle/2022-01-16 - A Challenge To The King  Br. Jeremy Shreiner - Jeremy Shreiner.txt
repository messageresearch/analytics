to hearts even through the internet lord we know that we thank you for being able to be out here today to be in your presence lord and while there's a grave need lord jesus that we've heard father a man by the name of salazar lord and father according to science according to this realm and the extent of the laws of this realm father they've given up on him lord father we just pray lord jesus that you could that you would come on the scene father on his behalf and give him a chance lord jesus said and not only another chance at life but a chance at new life lord jesus [Music] just hate to think

we're told of christ jesus father lord when we come into your presence lord we often don't have the highest expectation that we should have lord to think of it like we've inherited a department store as our messenger told us and he said if i had inherited a department store i'd certainly want to go in there and see everything that belonged to me lord and i pray father that you'd lift our expectations father that we could ask for big things and have faith to believe for big things lord and not just walk out with some little thing oh he spoke to me about this or he talked about a sermon that i was reading the other day but oh god may we father believe you for bigger things than that lord help us to leave here with a a greater presence of you in our life that we may have an atmosphere a father about us by thinking on these things and keeping you in the center of our [Music] being father that what we're looking at may emanate out from us father and we could have an atmosphere that can change situations and even in circumstances that don't go our way father we can have a anchor in our heart that says though these things are going this way it's well with my soul because i'm more than a conqueror through you lord mother we just ask you to bless the remainder of the service bless the man of god lord jesus may you father reach his hand into that golden bowl of man and father and pull out just the thing father that we need to hear tonight and help him to deliver it father in your spirit and the power and demonstration of it and give us hearts to receive we ask in jesus name amen [Music] amen let's just sing that as sister laura comes to bring it special lord my heart can grow so far away and go [Music] god [Music] the reason [Music] here [Music] [Music] shackled by a

father as we come before you lord we're so grateful again for this time of fellowship around your word lord the songs that have been sung the worship atmosphere that we feel in this place lord we're just so grateful god again without you lord where would we be father we're so thankful of the scripture though it's used many times even in small settings where two or three are gathered in your name there you are father there's many here tonight lord jesus but we want to make sure that we're here in your name father we ask that you just move in every heart and every life lord that again as we give ourselves to you lord to speak to us father for only you know the battles that we're going to face this week you know the struggles that we're going to go through god you know the joy times father you know the sad times and lord being a believer father being in service to you you never leave us unprotected father you always warn us of what's coming ahead we might not know the exact thing father but lord we can look back and know that before every test and every trial you were there father through the word through the ministry god just speaking to our hearts giving us words of wisdom father to help the battle that we're about to face tonight god we again ask that you would just help us in that manner lord we thank you for each and every one that is here bless this church abundantly and i give myself to you now again in jesus name amen let's just do that again that uh hold me hold me close let's sing that again me close let your love surround me [Music] and draw me to your side [Music] [Music] your spirit is beyond [Music] i know you could simply say well i'm here aren't i it should be enough but no seriously you're here i'll just be glad to be here amen glad to know that he is here amen that if i'm here he might as well be here we might as well worship him we might as well have a good time in the lord and you know we might as well say lord if i need something more if i need a change in my life lord here am i be it unto me according to that word amen hallelujah while you're standing let's open our bibles to the book of daniel hallelujah we we didn't really have this plan for the second part so we were really getting a hold of god this afternoon again to try to find the mind of the lord and this is a something that i spoke probably a couple years ago at home and just really started jumping out at me and we're going to find this in daniel chapter 3. i didn't do the greetings this morning but greetings from amarillo texas our local body there we're so grateful to have the work of the lord there and god's just been doing wonderful things for us and i know he has been here and this year we're going to be as it would be celebrating our 50th year there in amarillo texas and we're just so grateful for the work that god has done there and we're just glad to be a part of it hallelujah daniel chapter 3 verse number 15. now if ye be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet the flute and the heart the sack but the sultry dulcimer and all kinds of music you fall down and worship the image which i have made well but if you worship not you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace i love this part and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands oh my lord begin to speak how many wants him to speak now shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we're not careful to answer thee in this matter we don't need to pray about this oh my if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thy hand o king but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up amen god bless you you can be seated this evening if i could for a few moments of your time just send you on your way with some encouragement tonight i this thought is entitled a challenge to the king a challenge to the king so a word the word challenge simply just means to call out to duel or combat now i want us to understand this more this evening for a few moments that it was not the three boys the three hebrew children that were challenged it was god they had nothing to do but trust in him tonight i want you to know that you are not the ones being challenged satan wants to think that it's all on you it's all your decision but if you are called of god the challenge is to god because he's the one that is calling you so again it had nothing to do with them it had everything to do with faith in god now listen to what brother branham says here it says and it became them to do their duty and to leave the event with god they had no need to go into an extended vindication of their conduct for it might be presumed that their principles of conduct were well known so i want you to know it it was up to god and not to them it didn't matter the outcome what mattered was it was up to god and they had to rest in that so when you face your trials this week when you face your life this week when you face whatever it is i want you to know that it's not up to you it's up to god because if you keep putting it all on yourself that you have to do this you have to make you have to make these decisions no you simply have to have faith in god we sing the song have faith in god what's the point of singing having faith in god when you're trying to do it yourself when you're trying to make sense of it all listen the three of your children said we're not gonna we're not gonna think about this we're not gonna have a conversation amongst ourselves and if you were to really look back they really had no self-help book they didn't have no answer they didn't have something to look back to like you and i have today we can point back to the word of god and we are surrounded by such a great of cloud of witnesses they didn't have that they just trusted in god that whether it was whether it's to the fiery furnace or whether he was going to take him out of it didn't matter it was all up to god what was about to happen and that the king did not have control so i want you to understand that as i continue with this commentary said which is indicated by the passage is that their minds were made up that their principles were settled and well understood that they had come to the deliberate determination deliberate determination as a matter of conscience not to yield obedience to the command that the result could not be modified by any statement which they can make or by any argument listen to this in the case you see satan loves to get in an argument with you see you were not built to argue with satan jesus didn't argue with satan he just said it is written that was not an argument are we met we're not you are as a believer you are not built to argue with the enemy you simply speak to the speak the word of god to that enemy so it doesn't didn't matter the outcome they knew that god was in control and they were not anxious about the result we are nothing but a bunch if we're not careful anxious americans anxious worldlines anxious about what's gonna happen next no it doesn't matter what's going to happen lord the challenge is not up to me the word has been challenged and the word will always stand the challenge look at the great passage it was read by your pastor this morning with the with the blessing of the child the lord is my shepherd i shall not walk i shall not lack there's nothing that i'm gonna lack now now listen to this great truth now give me 10 million dollars 10 million sounds like a lot of money but one reversal of fortune it'll scatter it but give me a spiritual hold on the divine assurance that the lord is my shepherd i shall not want i am set for life i cannot go broke with the with that stock in my hand i can never be bankrupt with that security you can climb the stairs of your old creaky house you can go and lay up and on the old bed and you can cover yourself in the cold of the night with the breeze blowing through the cracks of the house and you can look up to the stars in the holes in the roof and you can have confidence that god is in control why because you're not lacking you are a believer it it doesn't matter about the natural things the lord is your shepherd oh my you will sleep peacefully why do we stay up why don't we why are we turned is because of the things and cares of life but i want you to know the challenges to the king and the king has called you oh my so it's not for you to worry about if you were called when satan comes against you he's not coming against you he's coming against the calling and you don't have to worry about it god is already going to get you through think about this in daniel 6 16. as we go to hear verse 16 then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him into the den of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thy god whom now serviced continually he will deliver thee i like it how the unbeliever said that come on believers and a stone was brought up and laid upon the mouth of the of the den and the king filled it with his own signature and with the signature of his lords that the purpose night might not be changed concerning daniel then the king went into his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of music brought before him and his sleep went from him you see he wasn't a believer so he was worried he didn't know the calling i want that to sink in now no you say well that's great he was doing those things he was doing this no he didn't know that he didn't have con you say well here before brother jeremy verse 16 he said he knew he could deliver him well if he really meant that why was he not sleeping that night why was he stressed out well let's let's look at the story i mean he wasn't the one in the dean of the lions oh my then the king arose very early in the morning and went into haste in the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel and the king spake and said to daniel oh daniel servant of the living god is thy god oh my whom thou serve us continually able to deliver thee from the lions then said daniel there's the answer unto the king o king live forever my god hath sent his angel and has shut the lion's mouths that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocency was found in me and also before the o king have i done no hurt again the challenge was made against the prophet of god and this time in the manner that even the heathen said i know you'll be delivered now the heathen said he would be delivered but yet he worried and he fretted and he wandered all night and then the next day when he went and talked to daniel he cried out with a a lamentable voice he had no confidence and he wasn't even in the den of lions brothers and scissors i want you to know that even in the den of lions you are in complete control god is in complete control of your life look at what brother branham said in looking at the unseen he said joshua looked at the unseen and walked around the walls believing it would happen it all depends on what you're looking at our brother mentioned tonight about expectations you see what did we come expecting what were we looking at they were looking from the walls down at the israelites they were looking at them as nothing i perhaps some of the israelites were looking at the walls wondering what god could do but still they obeyed the word of the lord sometimes you know you don't have a scientific answer of how that wall is going to fall down but if god said keep walking around and you keep walking around that mountain you keep trusting in the lord i don't know how it's going to happen i don't know when he's going to show up all i know is that he told me this was the truth all i know is that he said keep doing this so i'm going to keep walking around these walls they can make fun of me they can call me names that all of these things can happen but somehow how do you know why because he brought me through this he brought me through that has he ever brought you through the jericho walls no but i know that he has never let me down once and so no matter what circumstance as we get back to that again from this morning no matter what it is if god has called you to it he is faithful to see you through it but you gotta and so it was the unseen that he was looking at oh i'm going to keep reading he said when they told daniel the lions then ready for you daniel looking at the unseen node that there was an angel of fire who stood between him and the lions that same pillar of fire that led the children of israel later for remembering animals afraid of fire when that pillar of fire stood between daniel and the lions the lions went off and meowed like kittens and laid down by faith the unseen daniel wasn't afraid of the lion think about the thoughts that god has for you the thoughts that the enemy has for you and what do you choose to listen to tonight jeremiah 29 11 for i know the thoughts that i think towards you say the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you here it is you know this matters more than anything else an expected end god didn't wake up in the morning i'm surprised can i he's the one that said this morning i'm surprised at this hippie he didn't do that he knew his calling he knew his calling and he has an expected end brothers and sisters if you can stand in that peace and in that confidence that you he has an expected end for you there's nothing that satan can do then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart you know not just when things are going wrong but every day of your life you're searching you're giving everything to him and you know how many times have you been told that you cannot do it you know you ever you know a young person maybe none of you are this way but you know once some young person is told they can't do it they're like challenge accepted i can't hit 250 you watch i'm gonna hit 250 yards oh that's a golf phrase sorry i'm gonna hit 300 no they what do they do they're challenged there's a mentality inside of in a sense of the human nature to accept the challenge but i want you to know you don't have to accept a challenge no god it's he that is being challenged when satan comes and says you're going down he's not challenging you he's challenging god as brother branham says and why he says i solemnly believe with all of my heart that christ will heal every person that wears those handkerchiefs there's no doubt in my heart i do not doubt god said it so why could i stand here and challenge in africa half a million people or india rather in africa thousands times thousands of witch doctors and all kinds of superstitions come forth and prove your god don't you be afraid jesus is still jesus god is still god there's not enough devils in torment that can challenge his word and nothing can withstand when unadulterated faith rests upon listen what he says any promise god gives it's the truth it'll stand through every fiery trial so you have to come right back to the very word of god you cannot come back to a church theology you cannot come back to a denominational idea or a non-denominational idea it's got to fall back upon the word of god and there is not a devil in hell that can stand against it you've got to let that you think about david what david had enough david had enough one day first samuel 17 26 and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god that word defy is to taunt and to blaspheme he had enough david had enough that the word of god kept being challenged and so god used a little ruddy fella that no one cared for everyone left for what are you doing here you don't belong here you little ruddy guy get back on the other side get over there where where the sheep barely care for you no no god called a little ruddy guy that had an anointing in his life that everybody else had forgot no one else could see what about the anointing in your life tonight you say well i've been told this and i've been told i don't care what you've been told by the world i don't care what religion has told you what has god told you it is not you that are being challenged you don't have to prove nothing that's what this whole thing has been about the last 10 or 20 or so many years is to prove the message no it proves itself it vindicates itself by bringing itself to pass and you are the vindication you don't have to prove it yourself oh my they said you can't prove divine healing and no such thing as that and and all like this said the opposition is too great and things like that but who is that uncircumcised philistine who will challenge the word of god that's right who is he who is this devil who is this doubt who is this fear come on whatever it is in your life this thing that's trying to challenge the word of god oh you see what it is sometimes you think you're being challenged to see if you're really a believer or not and and sometimes it begins to bring doubt inside of us yes you're going to be tested you're going to be tried i get that but i want you to know that it's not heaped upon you to handle yourself a minister can't do it himself a pastor cannot do it himself william branham could not do it himself it had to have the word of god that power within sight of him and you you've got to have that word other than that you're going to keep trying to prove that you're going to be different you can't do it on your own there is so much of god release to us in this day if we could just tap into it if he is the same then it's time for us to to look at that word and say lord if you are the same then i'm going to claim this word i'm going to claim as we heard again tonight everything in this store i'm going to claim every promise i it's not just every promise in the book is mine and again leaving it to a song but it is mine the word of god is mine freedom is mine if the son has set you free you are free indeed that means that yes even though you're going to have those temptations and they're going to come your way you have an anointing and a power to be able to rebuke him what did jesus tell his disciples he said pray that ye enter not into temptation notice he said enter you see that that didn't mean that temptation was not going to come their way i want you to know that because you're still here you're still going to have temptation but jesus said don't enter into it temptation's going to let's let's just throw this out there fear will come your way but then you have the choice whether to trust the word of god and not allow yourself to enter into that fear so just because fear comes doesn't mean you've entered into it you just speak to that mountain and be thou removed just because doubt may come or or question or whatever it may be may come doesn't mean that you have stepped into it no that is time to speak to that thing but do not enter into it don't allow yourself to be overcome by those temptations because you're still going to go through them as long as you're in this life you're still going to be tempted you're still going to be tried but you're an overcomer how many is overcomers tonight hallelujah amen i'm not going to hold you along so just bear with us i know it's sunday night but hallelujah anyhow someone said the other day a minister talked to me and said oh it's such a blessing brother branham oh i've seen the most patient people laying in wheelchairs and said god wants them to be sick he lets them be sick so he can show his blessings i said then if that's the truth then jesus christ defeated the very purpose of god when he come to earth he healed everyone he come in contact with him like i do right oh brother that's too thin see it just don't work you just might as well face the fact that you don't believe the bible and just say so and that's all because or either afraid to step out and challenge god to his promise like elijah did you say oh i'm afraid to challenge no if there's something inside of you and you know that healing is there for you you know that deliverance is there for you when you step out and speak it you are not just challenging yourself you are pointing right back to the word of god oh my aren't you glad that we have an anointing we have a power today oh my first kings 18 36-39 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said the lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art the god in israel and that i am my servant and that i have done all these things at thy word you see as soon as you leave this word you have no no foundation to challenge god he said i've done this at thy word hear me o lord verse 37 hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou hast turned their back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench boy when god does something he does it right listen when he gives you his all when he give when he saves you he fills you with the holy ghost it's not haphazard it's not just all maybe a little bit today no he wants to pour himself upon you when he does it he does it right and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god you see what is the point of this what is the point of ministries the point of ministries is not to point back to the minister the point of churches is not to point back to the church the point of a prophet is not to point back to a prophet but everything is to point to christ when you look at william branham he's pointing us to christ when you look at your pastor he's pointing to christ when you look at worship we're pointing back to christ everything has to go back to him as soon as we start absorbing worship we're right we're absolutely in the wrong i didn't even have to finish that sentence you already knew the answer why because you're seasoned you understand that so we cannot it's not about me how many knows that old song coming back to the heart of worship it's all about you lord it's all about you see this is not a disrespectful challenge this is not a challenge that is to better our carnal self we we're not here to challenge the word of god so we can out quote each other outlive each other bless god i'm a better message person than you no you've done messed up no god everything is about you i'm challenging that word why because i know that by your stripes i'm healed i know that i have been set free i know that i'm not that old person anymore every now and then that old self tries to rise up but again that inner holy spirit that anointing pushes it right back down where it belongs oh my be not conformed romans 12 2 be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind what that you may prove that you're at the right church that you may prove that you're at the right no i'm not speaking against churches i'm just saying it's not about that oh man i'm in the right i'm in the right i'm in the right i'm in the right before you know it's all about me me me me oh it's all about him you've been called to this area you've been called to this assembly by the grace of god and now you are not conformed to this world not to prove that this is the right spot or this is the right but to prove that god has called you here listen to what it says what is good and acceptable and perfect will of god why are you in this area why are you in bedford texas why are you at this church why are you following this pastor why because you've been called to prove the perfect will of god to fight together not against one another amen if we're only a church if we only become a church pointing to the clouds and healings of the past well what can the people see today if we're only pointing yes we have a great cloud of witnesses but what about the actions today these signs shall follow them that belief oh my don't fall asleep on me yet listen to what he says here in the in the patmos vision and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and set captives free everywhere those believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and god confirmed that word with signs following the sick were healed devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride aren't you glad to be named that hallelujah oh little flock you little minority listen to what he says hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it can i say it again that's the cry of the prophet hold on to this word fill your mouth and heart with it take the book eat it let it become you oh my and knowing now romans 13 11 and knowing the time do you know the time i didn't ask natural time and some of you were like i do hurry no i know the time it's later than you think however you want to take that that's up to you it's high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than we believed oh i'm not just talking about that first salvation i'm talking about that moment i'm talking about resurrection i'm talking about breaking free from these chains out of this world completely it is now time so i challenge you to take the word of god i challenge you to take god at his word take god at his word tonight no more stepping back and saying what if who now you've got to change it who is this uncircumcised philistine you weren't trained to fight goliath or so you thought you weren't trained to go in front of those battle scarred as it were veterans or so they thought they were but while they were hiding in the shadows and afraid and in fear god was dealing with a little minority a little body that said there's something wrong with this there's something wrong i don't have to come to church this way i don't have to i don't have to go home this way i don't have to let my house have this bad feeling inside of it i don't let that i don't have to let my job get to me like this i don't have to let these circumstances rule me who is this uncircumcised philistine that is coming at me no you have an anointing of god inside of you a backside of the desert experience something that that that won't you can't even use saul's stuff because you've already got something that's been proven again they want you to prove it you don't have to they're challenging the god that called you so trust in the lord tonight i speak to you that i i want you to know who says the days of miracles are past it doesn't matter what they say i speak to you this morning o king of this world no matter what it is to you this evening o king of this world you have no power over this church you have no power over our minds you know how you have no authority over us oh my this for psalms 24 6 this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face o jacob lift up your heads all ye gates and be lift up your everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle have you forgotten church who's on your side have you forgotten who has called you walk out of them doors tonight with your spiritual head held high that no matter what satan throws you away he's not challenging you he's challenging the king that has called you and god's in control don't but he think it i want you to tell you can't lose sight of your king there is a touching i was reading this the other day and it just kind of really blessed me so maybe it'll bless you and perhaps our brother knows it because of where he comes from or whatever he said he came from you'll figure it out irish is that what it was thank you i almost said the wrong one i probably would have been thrown out there is a touching fact related in the history of a highland chief of the noble house of mcgregor who fell wounded by two balls at the battle of the pres uh preston pens seeing that seeing their chief fall the clan wavered and gave the enemy advantage the old chieftain beholding the effects of his disaster raised himself up on his elbows while the blood gushed in streams from his wounds and cried aloud i am not dead my children i am looking at you to see you do your duty these words revived the sinking courage of his brave highlanders there was a charm in the fact that they still fought under the eye of their chief it roused them to put forth their mightiest energies and they did all that human strength could do to turn and to stem the dreadful tide of battle and there is not a charm to you o believer and the fact that you contend in the battlefield of life under the eye of the savior wherever you are however you are oppressed by foes however exhausted by the stern strife with evil the eye of christ is fixed lovingly upon you i thought of how that just just the thought of that man lifting up his l or lifting himself by his elbows though gushing out with blood but crying out to his to his fellow soldiers and saying i still see you how that allows them to keep fighting and then turn the tide i see how much more for us believers tonight to know that yes he paid the price he gave his life but he has come back in power and his loving eye is upon you every moment no matter the pressure that you're facing no matter the battles that come your way his loving eye is upon you oh man a man that's ever received the holy ghost don't care whether he begs for bread brother branham says or not does it make a difference to him why because he's a heaven-bound creature he's got no ties here at all that's right he don't care let them come let them go what may let them criticize make fun lose your prestige what do you care you're on your road to glory hallelujah your eyes are set on christ and you and you're on your road you don't care what the world says that's what the holy ghost is it's a power come on i believe there's some people that know what i'm talking about tonight it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's a sign oh my he says it's the assurance that god has received you that's why you consider tonight and say it doesn't matter what comes my way god's in control i've been sealed i've been set free i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man yes i'm tempted but i don't long for that old life temptations come my way but there is something inside of me that says get thee behind me satan oh my why because there isn't a power inside of you it's not a sunday morning power only it's not old sunday night power only it's not a wednesday night power only it's not a meeting power only but it's an eternal power that has been with you and it's in you and it'll be all the way to the end oh lord i believe help my unbelief you ever been in that position lord i believe help my unbelief you don't want to leave this you don't want to walk into the world but there's times you go through those moments of that you trust god you but there's still some doubt lord i believe help my unbelief i know you can do it lord so speak it you say you have the holy ghost speak it listen to this in matthew 8 8 the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth unto another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel you say well that's talking about jesus wait a minute you are right but where does your authority come acts 1 8 but you shall receive power not before after that the holy ghost has come upon you not after just an uh a fleshly anointing but we're talking about the change and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in judea and samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth you shall receive power what is that power it's authority to speak to any mountain in your life authority to speak to any problem any circumstance to pray for your children to pray for your husband to pray for your style your wife to pray for your church authority to be able to speak to it you've been given authority church you say well i have to wait on i listen i have definitely four praying laying on of hands that's not what i'm saying you have to understand that we cannot just wait only for that if you have the holy ghost you have the power and authority to speak to whatever demon comes your way well brother david's probably sleeping right now i better not call him yet i'm just going to sit here and let this demon torment me until i can get a hold of him no sir no man you just get a hold of god and you begin to rebuke that demon with every with that anointing that's inside of your life that's that's that's what i'm trying to say but then there are times that you've got to call the the elders of the church it's scriptural i get that but don't forget the power that god has given you to be able to speak to the mountain yourself to be able to claim the word for yourself to not just wait upon this event or wait upon this evangelist but god has given you the power of the holy ghost to be able to speak to that tormentor and say you can't torment me any longer you can't hold me any longer hallelujah that's where your authority comes let it be more than just only believe you see how we've sang that song for many years only believe all things are possible but it's time that we begin to speak it and let it come alive i want us to i want to just read that i actually didn't didn't put that scripture here but i'm trying to remember from remember from my memory about i have believed therefore have i spoken see a lot of times we get caught up in the believing part but we believe and then wait we need to believe the scripture then says it says it twice once in the old testament and then it refers back to it in the new testament i have believed therefore have i spoken so if you're believers tonight you're not just sit sent to just sit here in this pew and just believe only and just to wait and just so i wonder no here it is thank you we have we have in the same spirit of faith according as it is written so they're referring to what it said in the old testament i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak so when we sing only believe all things are possible only believe we must not just get stuck in a rut that we're just singing a song and wondering if god's going to move but we must speak it into action speak life speak life to yourself remove the stone away so god can call about oh my this is not your challenge we're coming to a close but this is putting the word of god on display and this is our moment this is our moment not to prove ourselves but to vindicate his word i am not here tonight just to vindicate myself whoever would be ministering we're not here to vindicate ourself we're here to point to the word of god let the word of god vindicate itself by bringing it to pass again i i we we could try to pump up i like what brother jr said many many years ago he said i can't i'm not here to pump you up he said it's hard to pump up a ball full of holes man i'll still never forget that i said boy that's the truth lord maybe we need some passion tonight i have believed do you believe tonight what is it that you believe you know it's sometimes easy to believe for someone else oh i believe that you can be healed i believe you can be set free oh i believe but what about you what about for yourself what about this thing that's been coming at you your whole life do you believe that god can set you free do you believe that you can walk away from these things that have been bringing you right back to the same path all the time where satan has said this is the way you're always going to be aren't you about tired of hearing that i say lord i don't want to hear that anymore i believe that you can set me free therefore i'm going to speak it i have been set free by the blood of the lamb we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed why because the challenge is not to us the challenges to the king and the king if he has called you he is faithful to see you through and he will see you through the end when satan comes against you i want you to remember you don't have to do it on your own you are not here to prove it to me you are not here to prove it to the pastor you don't need to prove it to your parents you don't need to prove it to your spouse just trust in god walk in faith and keep moving forward as we said this morning keep the momentum going keep walking in the word of god keep seeking the word of god keep asking god give me more of your word reveal more to me i've got to get rid of myself so i can have more of you the more you let go of yourself the more god you can have the more you let go of your thoughts the more word you can get inside lord i surrender my thoughts i surrender my mind i surrender my opinion i surrender my ideas god fill me with your word saturate me with your presence why because he's given you authority to do so authority to speak to that enemy authority to speak to cancer authority to speak to whatever ailment that you may have but healing comes in many different forms healing of the mind as we know what is the greatest battle ever fought i'm so glad that we god gave us a prophet that allowed that he used to expose this maybe you didn't need it but i did because it was this mind that told me i didn't need to live anymore it was this mind that i allowed this the enemy to come in and tell me that i was better off brother david dead i was better off i was better off that my parents were tired of me i was better off the church wouldn't need me as a young person i remember hearing it constantly berating me telling me and i will remember grabbing a knife and putting it up to my chest and holding it just wanting to push it in and something inside says you can't do it and the mind said you're not man enough but something inside said you can't do it see there i don't know if you understand the paradox of that there was a war raging you basically know who won you're not seeing a ghost here you this this is me in the flesh but whatever suicide spirit came upon me it was an anointing of god i couldn't overcome it myself whatever this came upon me listen from my birth i will i'll never forget i know you know this testimony from the moment before i was born the doctors told my mom and dad that i needed to be aborted that i was going to be nothing but a vegetable that i was going to be nothing but uh and not only that when that didn't work they said if i was going to be born they would kill my mom she would not make it now the doctor it was her family doctor our family doctor and he seemed to care for him and he wasn't a man for abortion but he said you're going to die nancy if you don't do this he won't have he will he won't be able to have any motion he won't be able to have anything he's he's not going to be any good and it'll kill you you need to let him go but they said again i'm here so you know the end of the story i'm like i'm like never mind i'm just giving god the glory i'll if nothing else i'm just thankful to be here but they listen to god and when they listen to god guess what i did just so y'all know i used that same family doctor till he died every time i went in i said guess what i'm alive i'm alive the devil didn't get me i'm alive and he would always laugh and chuckle at me he said i know you are i can move my arms yes i know you can it doesn't matter well well you're going through this sickness but it doesn't matter i'm alive and i'm just here to remind you the same god that brought me there the same god that'll bring you through hallelujah you need to remind the enemy tonight i'm still alive i'm not dead why because there was something inside on the inside that said don't make that decision don't take that turn something keeps holding me hallelujah it's an anointing on the inside that you can't explain to the world don't try to explain the holy ghost because it's something that's unexplainable but it's an anointing inside that holds you when everyone else says it's it it says one more step when everyone says you you've crossed the line that inside spirit says one more step one more step one more step one more battle one more trial one more day one more moment you keep pressing satan comes and says it's it you hear that anointing inside take another step and every step you take are footsteps of possession everything that satan thought that he he was going to stop you from getting your living and breathing today testimonies you say i don't have a testimony yes you do satan doesn't have me i am a child of the living god he thought he did guess what boo you devil the challenge is not to you it's to the king that called you i'm just gonna tell you in my simple language i'm not very much theologized he's got this he's rolling up his sleeves even now he's ready to fight for you it didn't mean that you're going to sit on the couch and become a couch potato he didn't give you armor just so you could stand up in a museum and say look i got the armor no you're going to have to fight but he's with you and he's done rolled up his sleeves for that thing in your life that battle of that problem he's there ready to fight for you but it's time that we just look to our general tonight say lord here am i i'm here for service if he called you you're gonna make it let's stand tonight hallelujah now what have you heard today with this doesn't matter god's got this what he said here means more than anything that this mind has told you it said you were worthless you you there was nothing for you no it doesn't matter what that says what this says speak to the mountain speak with authority well if it be the lord's will perhaps i could possibly rebuke doubt no you become the kitten no there's got to be an anointing inside of you it doesn't have to be loud it doesn't even sometimes have to be spoken with these lips but let it come from here god you've got this i've made mistakes i know i have i've done things that i shouldn't have done but you're the one that called me uh don't don't take me wrong here but i'm gonna say it's your fault lord that i'm here you gotta put up with me lord hallelujah and you know what he wants to put up with you he wants to take you by the hand and he wants to take you all the way he didn't bring you that song he didn't bring you this far to leave you he didn't teach you to swim to let you drown he didn't build his home and yet to move away that's the god that i serve i want to leave you tonight with this i want to encourage you you keep pressing tabernacle of bedford is that what your church's name christian life tabernacle hallelujah close [Music] you got the drift keep pressing [Music] come on look at your neighbor and say press on oh did you mean it come on press on press on brother press on sister you've been called by the king no matter what the enemy says you've been called by the king i don't care what mama says what daddy says king jesus has called you press on do it one more time press on press on press on we're not giving up the fight we're not throwing in the towel tonight we're moving forward in the name of jesus i'm praying for you will you pray for me i'm praying i might not know you by name but i know you're by heart and i'm praying for you and if the lord carries i'll see you in a month at some youth meetings and what are we going to see then we're going to see more victory but if the lord doesn't tarry i'm going to see you on the other side i'm going to see you sitting in your chair that your name's already on hallelujah it ain't musical chairs up there where we have to figure out where we're sitting your name's already there oh come on close your eyes now and let the let the holy ghost anointing come in i want you to see your name in that chair see your name there that's my name devil you can't take me no one can take me from the palm of his hand i am his and he is mine god you know this church i pray for them with all of my heart now lord bless every heart and courage every soul tonight lord lord encourage him lord there's many battles there's many trials that they are facing god there's heartaches that they're going through there's pain and agony lord lord many things that they are facing but lord you are with them you are with them lord and that's the greatest comfort that we as believers have it's that you're with us through it all and you have given us the power and authority to not let circumstance rule us but we just keep our eyes on you now bless every heart we pray in the name of jesus can you just lift your hands and say thank you jesus mean it from your heart thank you jesus oh maybe satan comes now and says but what about this just say it again thank you jesus he's brought you this far a christian life tabernacle he's going to take you first he's going to take you all the way to the end don't you walk away young person don't you walk away father and mother don't you give up the fight don't you get discouraged trust in the lord he is here he is with you and he will see you all the way through it just hold to him let's sing it hallelujah something keeps holding me [Music] let him do this [Music] come on now it's already there [Music] is [Music] it's a reality [Music] amen did you enjoy that tonight amen the battles the lords amen you know i i thought as our brother was ministering you know i love it when the word of god comes alive and you know there's a great scripture and we say it all the time it's probably one of the scriptures that repeated most in our life but [Music] and it says now faith is the evidence of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen i just want to shed some light on that tonight for your victory to go straighter it was made so real to me today when you're in a battle in a court fight or in any kind of battle you've got to predict present your evidence to win [Music] if you don't present your evidence then the supposition is that you're guilty and and the prophet of god made a statement he says god can do nothing for you until you confess it first [Music] he can do nothing for you till you confess it first now we say we believe and and if we believe as our brother said tonight if we really believe and god's really fighting our battle for us then we have the evidence of what has not yet been seen it's not what's been seen that's our evidence our evidence is what produces the result of not sick not lost not guilty and if if you take this great word of god tonight and our prophet said you know god can do nothing for you unless you convince confess it first god can do nothing for you until you present the evidence of that faith that the confession of your faith is where healing comes from and that so moved me this morning because our brother stood here and he in the face of everybody said this is their evidence that was their case and they presented their evidences the doctors presented their evidence science presented their evidence civilization presents their evidence psychology presents their evidence psychiatry presents their evidence but he's that waymaker and our evidence is it's not my battle it's god's battle and he said and that settles it [Music] you'll never have a victory till you present the evidence you'll our brother said tonight he says the presenting of your evidence is speaking that which you hoped for and then it came substance by your word if god never said let there be there would have never been substance came from the speaking of the word faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you present your evidence it gains substance and comes forth in a reality so take this inspiration from today i think we're all inspired today to live a more active life in the gospel to stand up against the negative things that have tried to flood us and and this side tracked and the questions in our heart and mind and settle it once or else as for me and my house we're gonna serve the lord as for me i'm going to serve the lord satan will never believe he'll never quit lying because he's the father of all lies and there's no truth in him he will remain ever a liar and his end is the lake of fire we just quit listening and when we do this is what we hear amen this is life to us tonight amen let us just take a moment bow our heads if if you have a special request on your heart tonight and something that you'd like to do something you'd like to present to the lord somebody you'd like to lift up into the to the lord tonight and place them on the altar of your heart before god some need something you believe with all your heart tonight and you'd like to bring it to him may you just speak it tonight first to him and then to the world of what he's going to do for you let us just lift our requests up for him maybe it's victory maybe it's overcoming power [Music] maybe it's answers to questions we just lift our hands before the lord before we're dismissed tonight our gracious heavenly father lord have we been inspired that the battle is yours as we've been taught to cast our cares upon you for you careth for us as you told us that your [Music] yoke is light lord your burdens are not heavy that that your mind is full of good thoughts towards us and we realize that if god be for us who can be against us and all the great encouragement that we've got from your word lord with that faith in our heart we bring these desires before you this evening asking that you do exceedingly and abundantly above what we can even ask or think we believe these things with all of our heart we know lord that we've just got a few more days of journey here we know that it can't go on much longer [Music] we've seen everything that's been spoken slowly coming to pass lord and we now lord we know it's time for us to look up for our redemption draws nigh it's time just to hold more firm than we've ever held firm it's time for us to hold tight and as our brother so spoke to us it's time for us to press on press on amen we believe it let's sing this song tonight is our great hope our dismissal song this evening as you go your way just remember every day there's coming a day you don't have to worry ever again our day's coming brother matt it's just saith the lord hallelujah amen oh there is god [Music] foreign [Music] will be shall see [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] amen [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] the promised [Music] glorious days [Music] you
