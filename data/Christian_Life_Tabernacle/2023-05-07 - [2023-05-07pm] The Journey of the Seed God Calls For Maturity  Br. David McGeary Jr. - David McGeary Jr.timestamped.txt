[27:27] it's my
[27:29] grace
[27:32] at your wings
[27:35] amen
[27:40] Faith's a gift of God so he blows those
[27:43] great Winds of Faith to us and we're so
[27:48] grateful for that
[27:49] amen you know tonight I've asked the
[27:54] David Jr to speak for us I thought when
[27:58] Billy said we have Brother David come
[28:00] out there
[28:02] he definitely could have got that right
[28:04] and
[28:06] you know
[28:07] I watched AV over the years and
[28:10] he's always been a minister
[28:14] he's always prayed for the sick he's
[28:16] always sat down and counseled the
[28:19] Brokenhearted he's always tried to share
[28:22] the Lord wherever he can go and
[28:26] and uh I I think that anybody can be a
[28:31] preacher
[28:33] but it's hard to be somebody that just
[28:35] ministers and I believe he has a lot of
[28:38] love for God's people
[28:40] and for uh the church and a lot of
[28:44] experience and behind the years that he
[28:48] spent in this gospel so we've just asked
[28:51] him to come this evening and share with
[28:53] us what the Lord's put on his heart so
[28:56] let's sing that last verse again as As
[29:00] We Worship the Lord this evening amen
[29:03] [Music]
[29:06] amen
[29:07] oh watch the eagle
[29:10] [Music]
[29:16] does not struggle
[29:23] [Music]
[29:38] [Applause]
[29:40] said
[29:44] to the winds
[29:49] oh you can fly
[29:52] in a
[29:54] minute
[29:57] do not struggle
[30:01] it's my grace
[30:04] [Music]
[30:13] amen
[30:15] let's just go before him
[30:17] gracious Heavenly Father we're here
[30:19] because you're the voice that's called
[30:21] us Lord
[30:22] each of us has a portion of faith that
[30:25] we've been made responsible for lord
[30:28] it's because our ears have heard the
[30:30] gospel and Faith's come by that hearing
[30:32] and it's leading us on a path it's a
[30:35] journey Lord and we just want to fill a
[30:37] ship around those things Lord for we
[30:40] believe you're we're your children
[30:42] Lord we're the Seed of Abraham and the
[30:45] Lord as such it were a special called
[30:48] out separated people
[30:50] father there's a Heritage that's ours
[30:53] Lord and there's an adversary that
[30:56] doesn't want us to take possession of
[30:57] those things
[30:58] father so we just ask that you'd come in
[31:01] the Simplicity of your word that you'd
[31:02] be each of our portion we commit
[31:04] ourselves to you
[31:06] father you know our frame
[31:08] Lord and we know you care
[31:10] above
[31:12] what we could even imagine
[31:15] you're so mindful of each one
[31:17] Lord and I just ask that you would deal
[31:19] with each heart seek the Lost
[31:22] Minister healing the precious name of
[31:25] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray
[31:28] amen
[31:29] well I know I'm pretty common to a lot
[31:32] of you and maybe some as we've grown
[31:34] maybe not so common
[31:36] but I feel I would take the opportunity
[31:39] to at least apologize to all the parents
[31:43] they've always had to say don't do as
[31:45] Davey do
[31:50] so
[31:52] and if I was to give Davey advice you
[31:55] know it may be to floss the teeth you
[31:57] want to keep and
[31:59] you know wear your retainer if you have
[32:01] braces but I really don't want to hear
[32:02] me tonight
[32:04] I have no desire for that so if we just
[32:07] turn in the word to Galatians 3
[32:10] a portion of scripture that uh
[32:16] want a fellowship on
[32:22] in 3 verse 8 and I may back up but
[32:26] the core of it
[32:32] is there
[32:35] Galatians 3 and verse 8.
[32:40] we'll just wait for it to
[32:43] be displayed
[32:49] we'll move on
[32:51] and the scriptures foreseen that God
[32:53] would justify the Heathen through faith
[32:56] preached before the gospel to Abraham
[32:59] saying in thee shall All Nations be
[33:02] blessed
[33:04] you know as the Seed of Abraham I think
[33:07] it's something when we look back to the
[33:09] father of our faith
[33:11] he was preached the gospel you can be
[33:14] seated well just Fellowship in the Lord
[33:16] from there
[33:18] amen
[33:20] you know I I Marvel at this book of
[33:23] Galatians especially when you when you
[33:25] see how you know Paul would come
[33:29] and Minister it and he would start out
[33:31] in chapter three he would say oh foolish
[33:33] Galatians
[33:34] and uh I I uh and you you come through
[33:38] and he sums it up you get to the end he
[33:41] calls us the Seed of Abraham
[33:43] and the faith you know in Romans 10 it
[33:46] talks about hate how faith is delivered
[33:49] is by the preaching of the word and
[33:52] here's Abraham receiving a promise that
[33:54] he had to believe in faith he actually
[33:56] receives it in in Genesis 12 if we would
[33:59] turn there but
[34:01] the reading I actually like is where he
[34:05] expresses the promise more in 18 and
[34:08] we'll turn there too but in chapter 12
[34:11] of Genesis 1-3
[34:14] he would read it now the Lord said unto
[34:17] Abraham get thee out of thy country and
[34:20] from thy Kindred and from thy father's
[34:22] house and unto a land I will show thee
[34:24] and the Seed of Abraham is always on a
[34:27] journey
[34:28] it's a there's a get thee out and I it
[34:32] doesn't matter where you're at if you're
[34:34] a Seed of Abraham and you're going to
[34:35] follow the leading of the seed that's in
[34:38] you there's a crying for maturity that
[34:42] that is in the seed and if there is a
[34:44] thought that I would would share it
[34:46] would be the Journey of the seed God
[34:49] calls for maturity
[34:51] and that's what I would would pray that
[34:54] each one the Lord would allow you to see
[34:56] is that you know we're not just born
[34:59] mature and and maybe even understanding
[35:02] all things but brother Branham and many
[35:05] times would take the time to tell us
[35:07] what it would mean to be uh born again
[35:10] and and that your Journey's begun and we
[35:13] know that type was a type of the
[35:15] promised land when you crossed over
[35:16] Jordan you went into the promised land
[35:19] the scripture even talks about how the
[35:21] Lord didn't just deliver the land of all
[35:23] the beasts that inhabited or the
[35:26] inhabitants of it he said the Beast
[35:27] would come in but there was a process by
[35:30] which they would go in and take the land
[35:32] and it was even an exercising of their
[35:35] faith because each tribe had been given
[35:37] an allotment and there was a portion and
[35:39] it was for them to take the land and the
[35:44] all these things are given to us as an
[35:45] example
[35:47] the the thing that's probably the most
[35:49] significant and why I I would believe
[35:52] that
[35:53] the time of Abraham you look at the
[35:56] ministry it it's the perfect type of a
[35:59] gentile
[36:00] receiving a dispensation of Grace the
[36:04] promise to Abraham was not a conditional
[36:06] Covenant
[36:08] it was an unconditional Covenant and and
[36:11] invert that's what I like about Verse 18
[36:14] of Genesis
[36:15] Jesus the voice of God to Abraham which
[36:19] we know is Christ telling him shall I
[36:21] hide
[36:22] that thing which I do it from Abraham
[36:26] already predetermined
[36:28] and and that's what I see what I read in
[36:31] the book of Galatians
[36:33] here's this prophecy that all the
[36:35] nations the heathen
[36:37] and
[36:38] there's a pleading
[36:40] with the Galatians
[36:43] to not
[36:45] lose the Liberty
[36:49] that they have
[36:52] they're not justified by the law
[36:56] and
[36:58] such a precious righteousness we have
[37:00] our joy is our strength so you just pray
[37:03] for me
[37:05] you know if the waters get troubled
[37:06] we're just gonna press through
[37:08] I remember one time I was asked to lead
[37:10] songs I cried the whole time through it
[37:15] all right
[37:17] you know but when Sons precious to you
[37:19] it really it it should be felt if if
[37:23] it's not felt you should bury it and and
[37:26] the there was a Zeal of Abraham
[37:30] he was always getting stronger in the
[37:32] faith
[37:33] now the so many things could have worked
[37:36] towards condemnation of Abraham you you
[37:39] go through it yet none of those things
[37:42] are accounted to him because there was a
[37:44] Zeal he had for the promise he was given
[37:47] and that is what was counted to him to
[37:50] righteousness and you're the Seed of
[37:52] Abraham
[37:54] you know I
[37:55] the devil's crafty I I doubt that he
[37:58] came to any of you and said did you mix
[38:01] your Cottons and your linens today
[38:06] did you drink any milk with your meat
[38:10] did he did he really go to you and plead
[38:13] the true love the law no
[38:16] no
[38:17] but we're not but he would
[38:19] condemn you by the law and that's when
[38:22] you read the book of Galatians that
[38:24] here it is being pled on our behalf
[38:28] that hey you're not under the law
[38:32] amen
[38:34] now if you're the Seed of Abraham you
[38:37] don't love the things of the world
[38:41] amen
[38:43] now that's your heart
[38:46] your flesh is always going to condemn
[38:48] you we're in this world your flesh is of
[38:51] this world but have you been born again
[38:53] of the Seed of Abraham do you have a
[38:56] love for the things of God in you
[38:58] amen right so there's your justification
[39:01] that Life of Christ in you
[39:04] crying out for maturity
[39:08] don't let anything paralyze your growth
[39:12] [Music]
[39:13] that's where the Pentecost where
[39:16] everything fell is
[39:18] the growth
[39:20] that they're called to
[39:23] and you know by God's grace we could
[39:25] maybe Fellowship around
[39:27] what that growth looks like because
[39:29] there's a journey
[39:31] if you even look at the children of
[39:33] Israel
[39:34] coming out of Egypt
[39:37] there's a point in time where there's
[39:39] some that don't go over the Jordan
[39:41] they set up camp
[39:44] they didn't enter into the full Promised
[39:46] Land
[39:48] you know and that's given to us as an
[39:50] example where we would behoove ourselves
[39:53] and brother Branham says that was
[39:54] Pentecost
[39:56] now you would think
[39:58] that partaking in the outpouring of the
[40:01] holy spirit that that wouldn't be it but
[40:03] he said what showed that they did is
[40:05] they set up camp they they separated
[40:08] themselves
[40:10] with things that was important to them
[40:15] it's just where their priority was
[40:18] it wasn't that there was more to be had
[40:21] but they found it more important to find
[40:23] fault
[40:25] and to draw circles
[40:31] and that's that's us
[40:35] you know
[40:37] that's the sad part
[40:40] is you know but if it cuts it's all
[40:43] right
[40:45] sorry
[40:48] this is uh Jehovah Jireh
[40:50] in 61.
[40:53] oh 209 I think it's a little before
[40:56] paragraph 27. now when did Abraham's
[40:59] seed lose this Great Fellowship
[41:02] when they went down into Egypt they
[41:05] never lost his Covenant
[41:07] he lost his Blessing and that's what I'm
[41:10] trying to get to the people tonight the
[41:12] Pentecostal church has lost its former
[41:15] blessing there's something wrong we know
[41:18] that anybody that ever read the history
[41:21] of the church knows that there's
[41:23] something wrong with the church now you
[41:25] haven't lost your Covenant but you lost
[41:27] your blessing come back to the promised
[41:30] land come back to the word come back to
[41:32] Christ
[41:35] this is
[41:37] take this to our hearts stop looking
[41:40] saying our denomination is bigger than
[41:42] theirs
[41:44] they're old buzzards roosting and worse
[41:48] something
[41:49] stop doing that
[41:51] come back to the Lord Jesus come back to
[41:54] the real Church reach out your arms for
[41:57] every Fallen brother
[42:01] amen there you are come back
[42:04] God hasn't taken his Covenant away from
[42:07] you but your blessing is gone because
[42:10] you've gotten worldly went out in the
[42:13] world been a flirting with the world
[42:15] then you're out of the promise but the
[42:18] Covenant still holds
[42:21] only thing you have to do is come back
[42:25] amen
[42:27] and when God made his Covenant with
[42:29] Abraham remember it was unconditionally
[42:32] and God called you not because you was a
[42:35] good person
[42:36] thank you Lord amen
[42:39] but because unconditionally he called
[42:41] you and by his grace he gave you the
[42:44] Holy Spirit right faith is a gift of God
[42:48] lest any man should boast
[42:50] amen but that's another thing of the
[42:54] seat of Abraham if you look at Abraham
[42:56] when in in Genesis 18 when he says what
[43:00] I should hide that thing from Abraham
[43:02] that which I doeth he was about to go
[43:04] down to Sodom and judge him
[43:08] and you see a nature of Abraham when he
[43:11] starts to plead
[43:16] and he isn't
[43:18] yeah
[43:21] they think they are right but if they
[43:24] studied the message
[43:26] if they heard what quotes are important
[43:28] to me
[43:29] you know
[43:31] that that's not the attitude of a Seed
[43:34] of Abraham
[43:35] it's pre-adventure Lord
[43:38] pre-adventure
[43:39] maybe they just
[43:41] haven't got the revelations
[43:44] what's the nature that's being displayed
[43:46] the nature of Abraham doesn't say Lord
[43:49] consume him with fire
[43:52] it doesn't call for judgment it calls
[43:54] for Mercy it calls for
[43:57] a long suffering
[44:00] calls for Grace
[44:04] so
[44:05] we're the Seed of Abraham amen
[44:08] that's our fellowship
[44:11] and as the Seed of Abraham I believe
[44:13] we're being called to maturity
[44:15] there's a maturity that it has to come
[44:17] to there's a journey of the seed as you
[44:21] look at it I I feel that in some ways
[44:26] what happens is when you mature there's
[44:28] an expectation you have of others
[44:30] sometimes and we and we lean into that
[44:32] but we have to allow for the same growth
[44:34] there has to be you know you put the the
[44:38] corn seed in the ground and you let it
[44:40] grow
[44:41] I think sometimes we just want popcorn
[44:45] we want that instant hey just have a
[44:47] sensation you know just have an
[44:50] experience or or just you know what pet
[44:52] my religious IQ and just let succumb to
[44:55] my influence I just want to see my
[44:58] influence exercised in your life and we
[45:00] don't want to see a true spiritual
[45:02] growth
[45:04] and that's because really it a lot of
[45:06] times
[45:08] you know
[45:09] it's just a matter of having confidence
[45:11] in the word of God to perform that which
[45:13] it's sent to do be still know that I'm
[45:17] God it's one planet one watereth
[45:21] and David Jr gives the increase
[45:27] right where's all the glory go I really
[45:30] appreciate what our Pastor said this
[45:31] morning it's whose Church who's leading
[45:33] the church
[45:34] really when it comes down to it who's
[45:37] leading the church are we playing church
[45:39] is the confidence that we have is that
[45:42] all we sees the humanity
[45:44] we're called out they're playing Church
[45:47] a lot of places
[45:48] they're living in a light for another
[45:50] day they're not going to ever come to
[45:52] the maturity but we have seen a sheath
[45:55] wave offering
[45:56] we're gathered around the promised word
[45:58] of full maturity
[46:01] and there's things in that I this is the
[46:04] thing that would behoove us
[46:06] where we're at right now
[46:08] we're being called to a land that we've
[46:11] never been to before
[46:15] and if you don't feel that call check up
[46:20] because I ain't seen anybody having a
[46:22] body change yet
[46:25] and we've had people step over and
[46:27] they've received it but we're going to
[46:29] be translated
[46:30] has anybody gone this way before
[46:33] but Abraham was called out to go sojourn
[46:37] in the land
[46:38] that's we've received that promise just
[46:42] as he received a promise we've been
[46:44] asked to believe that you're going to
[46:46] receive a body change how
[46:49] because this message that's come has
[46:52] provided
[46:54] a prophesied bride amen
[46:57] we live in the day of a voice
[47:00] amen
[47:03] amen things that are to be
[47:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ in this
[47:10] hour not what he was in another hour
[47:13] what he was now the Bible expresses
[47:17] it's growing in the bride
[47:20] to the full stature
[47:23] is it growing
[47:27] is it growing that that's Lord let it
[47:30] grow
[47:31] and by letting it grow
[47:35] is something stunting the growth the
[47:38] promise of the life of the seed is that
[47:40] it will produce
[47:42] he's you know these are things that God
[47:44] said Let each seed bring forth of his
[47:46] kind
[47:47] you haven't been bored of a
[47:48] denominational seed you haven't been
[47:50] born of the will of man you've been born
[47:52] by the word of God the the this message
[47:56] is more precious to us than we realize I
[47:59] it you we we were just fellowshipping
[48:02] the other day someone looked up what the
[48:04] world wants you to do to be a minister
[48:08] it's completely Godless guidance
[48:13] it's like they turned it in to
[48:15] Academia
[48:17] it's like a process like do this do that
[48:21] in no place does it even say like
[48:25] receive the Holy Ghost be led of the
[48:27] spirit I mean like God's out of it
[48:31] right but that's not our heritage
[48:34] this is all God this is his doing this
[48:38] isn't what man's done
[48:41] but uh amen
[48:44] to the full stature therefore if the
[48:47] corner wheat of Christ had fall had to
[48:49] fall on the ground so did the bride this
[48:50] is the bride from every age had to fall
[48:52] into the ground through the Dark Ages
[48:54] any grain that goes into the ground must
[48:56] die or it can't produce itself reproduce
[48:59] itself and the great church that he
[49:01] establishes on the day of Pentecost by
[49:03] the sending of the Holy Ghost had to
[49:05] suffer Mart of them had to go into the
[49:07] dirt into the Earth in the dark ages to
[49:09] bring forth again in the age of Luther
[49:11] and to come on out to the full stature
[49:15] of the Bride of Jesus Christ for though
[49:18] this last day
[49:20] there was Brides through every ages we
[49:23] know that they received the word for
[49:25] their day but you know in in each day
[49:28] there was people who received the word
[49:31] for their day and as there was a
[49:33] blending of a dispensation they walked
[49:35] forward in the light
[49:36] they didn't stay
[49:40] there and when you
[49:43] put the period That's What brother
[49:44] Branham said Pentecost did that was
[49:46] wrong so they put the period
[49:48] well we've spoke in tongues period
[49:51] well we've done this period and we've
[49:55] got such a beautiful message of truths
[49:58] and I don't care what the truth is it's
[50:01] the truth but if that's where you put
[50:03] the period at
[50:06] you're dying
[50:08] you're not walking in the light you
[50:11] haven't come to full maturity and
[50:13] it's not that those things aren't true
[50:17] but if they separate you from your
[50:18] brother
[50:23] I mean we don't you really don't want to
[50:25] be judged by the law
[50:29] I mean that's that's the thing then yeah
[50:32] you're going to judge yourself
[50:35] don't do it
[50:37] there's no worthiness
[50:40] as soon as you open that up you can't
[50:42] put it back in
[50:43] if that's what he says he said if you're
[50:46] gonna
[50:47] you're a debtor to the whole law
[50:51] You've Lost Your Blessing you've just
[50:53] made yourself a debtor to the whole law
[50:55] you know the law is there to make guilty
[50:58] everybody else but there's somebody
[50:59] could go in and eat the show bread
[51:02] there's a liberty that the bride has and
[51:07] it's it's real and it's because there's
[51:10] nothing could be laid to her charge but
[51:12] as soon as she takes herself out from
[51:14] underneath that and starts trying to
[51:16] crucify someone else
[51:19] don't do it now let our righteousness
[51:22] shine
[51:23] you know let's not do sinful things let
[51:27] you know what I'd rather you show my
[51:29] Liberty by the things I don't do
[51:31] that I'm not in bondage to them
[51:35] right I mean I I in junior high seen a
[51:41] kid we play this game called quarters
[51:44] don't want to give anybody any bad ideas
[51:45] I've given enough of those I won't maybe
[51:48] go into too much details
[51:50] but you know people would start this kid
[51:52] would lose his shoes
[51:54] and it was it was like the next time he
[51:56] was going to win
[51:58] and I've seen that demon of gambling on
[52:00] somebody
[52:02] it was the next time I'm gonna get it he
[52:05] had it bad
[52:06] I'm just a kid but it was a demon you
[52:09] could see the influence on him
[52:11] I I use that I don't know if anybody
[52:13] struggled with that but I don't I've
[52:16] never had to battle that
[52:18] but if I knew someone I took advantage
[52:21] of people at that time that had that
[52:23] problem I'll admit it Lord forgive me
[52:26] but you see what I'm saying the Liberty
[52:28] I would have to be able to flirt with
[52:30] that thing and not be in bondage to it
[52:33] why would I do that in front of someone
[52:35] who's in bondage to it
[52:38] do you really love the person
[52:41] so you know it's not that all things
[52:43] don't have a there's a liberty it's like
[52:46] Brother David says you could play
[52:48] football you could do those things you
[52:51] know but if that's what has consumed you
[52:55] you know if that's really where your
[52:58] love's at then you've missed it
[53:01] and and be careful that your meat
[53:03] doesn't offend your brother because
[53:04] there's some things that that some
[53:06] people do have bondage to
[53:09] all right you know there's there's a
[53:14] there's an innocence a lot of times when
[53:16] people are messing with things because
[53:18] they don't understand the extent to
[53:19] which they go
[53:23] and if if you listen to The Godly
[53:26] discernment of your parents or some some
[53:28] people who know that protect you from a
[53:30] lot of Heartache because you're flirting
[53:33] with the with bondage that you don't
[53:35] that you're not in
[53:37] right I mean the Lord wants to keep you
[53:38] from it
[53:40] and there's a chastisement and a
[53:42] correction
[53:43] you know there's a something
[53:47] and we'll just go here
[53:49] predestination is is a blessing
[53:53] it the devil hates it because it tells
[53:56] them where he's going
[53:59] and we love it because it tells us where
[54:01] we're going
[54:02] I mean Jesus said I go to prepare a
[54:04] place for you
[54:06] hallelujah amen so
[54:11] we we take that
[54:13] and it's true
[54:14] here's the destination
[54:16] but you're a seed
[54:19] what what fruit do you what inheritance
[54:21] do you want to have when you get there
[54:24] how much fruit do you want to bear
[54:27] do you want to just show up and you have
[54:28] the talent nothing that what fruit do
[54:30] you want to bear in that Journey those
[54:32] are the choices you make
[54:36] now I trust the Lord that the promises
[54:38] he has the things that were meant for
[54:40] evil God will use to the good we have
[54:42] promises we fortify ourselves in but
[54:45] people have pierced themselves through
[54:46] with many Sorrows because they've loved
[54:48] the things of this world
[54:50] and they've been they've tantalized
[54:52] things and I would say by the grace of
[54:55] God
[54:57] put away those things they don't
[55:00] sin will keep you longer than you want
[55:02] to say stay
[55:04] it may seem Innocent but you know you
[55:07] know if it ain't right
[55:09] it don't even need to go into specifics
[55:12] you know the Lord could
[55:16] just stay away from it you know there
[55:18] was something we learned over in Israel
[55:21] they have a concept to approaching the
[55:23] law
[55:23] they said they they put barriers so
[55:26] we've we I've heard the scripture that
[55:28] you should not boil the kid in its
[55:30] mother's milk
[55:31] and that's we find that in our our Bible
[55:34] in the levitical laws and that the kid
[55:36] being a goat but Cosman got told that he
[55:40] couldn't bring a drink into the the
[55:42] hamburger joint because the guy came up
[55:45] and this is a young teenage kid
[55:48] says what's in the cup
[55:51] it was like coffee did you add cream
[55:54] yes get out
[55:56] if you're in a restaurant and we serve
[55:58] meat we don't want the milk with the
[56:01] meat so they Amplified the law they said
[56:04] we'll put a barrier just to avoid even
[56:07] the possibility of you
[56:10] having meat with milk we'll we'll avoid
[56:13] the very appearance of evil
[56:16] don't be drawn away of worldly lust amen
[56:21] just
[56:24] get rid of the whole thing
[56:26] if amen avoid the appearance of evil
[56:30] I'll say this there's protection in the
[56:33] law and doing those things until you get
[56:35] the Holy Ghost to Legion so to follow
[56:37] the letter of the law
[56:39] amen
[56:42] amen
[56:43] but as we journey I
[56:46] found one of the things that was
[56:48] exciting to me
[56:50] is that
[56:51] the Lord understands where we're at he
[56:53] understands the maturity of our faith he
[56:55] actually understands the challenge that
[56:57] we face that's why we've been given a
[57:00] a witness
[57:01] such a great witness that's why we have
[57:03] a message to restore the faith
[57:06] is because it has the ability to produce
[57:09] the life
[57:10] and you know we have been given this
[57:13] Natural Life to even better understand
[57:15] our spiritual growth there's things that
[57:17] when you were a child
[57:19] you probably didn't understand that you
[57:21] look back at now and they make perfect
[57:23] sense
[57:25] as a Christian in the Christian Life as
[57:28] a in the walk that we have we're going
[57:30] to come to the place where the things
[57:33] that we've talked about as being Eternal
[57:35] become a reality
[57:38] we step over to the other side brother
[57:40] Brandon said it's a world world
[57:42] we're going to live there
[57:46] amen
[57:48] that's our that's our heritage
[57:52] want to take this quote
[57:55] that said Abraham and his seed it's a
[57:58] 6104-23
[58:03] and he eats just speaking of I believe
[58:06] what what I said about growing he says
[58:08] and that's what we are now think about
[58:10] it
[58:11] what's that going to be what's the world
[58:14] where we can pass from Glory why when we
[58:18] take a scope and we a scope and see 120
[58:22] million light years space that ain't 1
[58:26] 16 of an inch in eternity
[58:29] amen I mean we can't even put a chart or
[58:32] a graph up here to explain you could
[58:34] take the best telescope you have and
[58:36] look a billion light years out
[58:39] and you can't even measure that as a
[58:41] sixteenth of an inch in eternity we
[58:44] can't understand those things now if
[58:46] anybody come talk to me later
[58:50] I'll enjoy I'll listen Hallelujah Glory
[58:54] but Jesus come from Heaven to Earth in a
[58:58] thought amen he's that that he's that
[59:01] close to you now
[59:05] amen we could step from this into the
[59:09] Eternal presence of God
[59:11] he could catch you just like that he's
[59:14] the Seeker of those who are lost amen
[59:17] he's denied them of a broken heart
[59:21] and you know what the best category is
[59:23] lost in a way right because if you don't
[59:25] know where you're at you qualify
[59:29] he's seeking you
[59:31] so if you didn't know where you were at
[59:33] in your spiritual growth you could say
[59:35] Lord you're seeking me
[59:38] you're coming for me
[59:40] Hallelujah
[59:42] and when he finds you
[59:45] there ain't nothing like the hand of
[59:47] Jehovah
[59:49] no there ain't
[59:52] amen
[59:54] maybe there will be a time where I could
[59:55] Fellowship around some of the things the
[59:57] Lord's brought me through
[59:58] but I can't hardly think about him
[1:00:00] without crying
[1:00:02] I'll tell you that he's been so good to
[1:00:05] me his his grace his long suffering his
[1:00:09] goodness and if I could tell you I I
[1:00:11] would say
[1:00:13] it you know he loves you more than you
[1:00:15] realize
[1:00:17] maybe I'll share one experience is
[1:00:19] pretty profound
[1:00:21] never could explain it I was my dad was
[1:00:24] remodeling a house out in Grapevine
[1:00:26] and uh you can take that
[1:00:32] but uh you know I it was I was around 18
[1:00:35] years old I was going through a hard
[1:00:37] time I was pretty broken-hearted for
[1:00:38] various reasons can't
[1:00:40] remember why but I know our emotions
[1:00:43] sometimes can be bigger than we are
[1:00:46] and uh
[1:00:48] in my heart I was asking the Lord
[1:00:51] why those things are those ways
[1:00:54] and a young kid probably about
[1:00:58] seven or eight
[1:01:01] runs down the fence line mountain and
[1:01:03] working in a backyard it's the
[1:01:05] neighbor's yard
[1:01:07] and I'm pulling cable out of the house
[1:01:09] I'm walking electric cable I'm pulling
[1:01:11] it so I've walked away from the house
[1:01:12] just pulling a long run
[1:01:14] and the kid runs up and he's shouting my
[1:01:16] name and I've never seen the kid before
[1:01:18] didn't know him he says David
[1:01:21] so I'm like trying to make sure I'm
[1:01:23] hearing
[1:01:24] my name
[1:01:26] by the third time he says it I'm just
[1:01:28] like yeah
[1:01:31] I mean he had me
[1:01:33] and he said Jesus cares how you feel
[1:01:37] and I said what
[1:01:39] and his mom was yelling at him from the
[1:01:41] house and I stood there like
[1:01:44] is this some kind of prophet
[1:01:50] you know what just happened
[1:01:53] but he cares that much
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:58] we'll just turned it over and
[1:02:01] to Brother David and pray the Lord be
[1:02:04] your portion and just encourage you
[1:02:05] along the way God bless you
[1:02:08] [Applause]
[1:02:17] thank you
[1:02:19] amen
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:25] I enjoyed that
[1:02:29] to know the things that matter
[1:02:32] you know what I mean that's I think
[1:02:35] that's the thing to Value the things
[1:02:38] that you really have
[1:02:40] just to think that our portion is the
[1:02:43] love of God
[1:02:44] the Forgiveness of our sins
[1:02:47] the commitment that he's made to
[1:02:50] each of us
[1:02:52] that in no wise would he forsake us
[1:02:56] that nothing would pluck us out of the
[1:02:58] palm of the hand his hand I guess as
[1:03:02] David spoke I just thought in my own
[1:03:05] self how
[1:03:06] easily
[1:03:08] I forget the simple things
[1:03:11] when the confusion
[1:03:13] comes all around
[1:03:15] just go back I never chose him he chose
[1:03:18] me amen
[1:03:20] I didn't find him he found me
[1:03:23] amen I didn't save myself he saved me
[1:03:27] amen I can't do one thing for my
[1:03:30] salvation
[1:03:32] okay so he would have died in vain
[1:03:35] and if we could love one another we're
[1:03:37] in the love that he loved us
[1:03:41] and if we could give to others
[1:03:43] everything that he gave us
[1:03:46] and it's got to go beyond our tent
[1:03:49] you know just it's that let the light
[1:03:52] shine I just feel in my heart that
[1:03:55] that's something that I want I believe
[1:03:57] God's going to have a real Church
[1:04:00] and that Capstone is really coming
[1:04:02] deeper and deeper into our hearts and
[1:04:05] into our lives to do those things let's
[1:04:09] stand this evening if the brothers would
[1:04:11] go prepare the communion
[1:04:27] like what they might
[1:04:30] communion scripture here
[1:04:34] and we'll turn into
[1:04:36] First Corinthians the 11th chapter
[1:04:40] you know this is a great opportunity
[1:04:43] when you commune with somebody in you
[1:04:46] talk with somebody
[1:04:48] um
[1:04:50] when I meet my friends that my old
[1:04:53] friends and
[1:04:55] my friends that I've had for years and
[1:04:58] years and years
[1:04:59] one of the things that's always a part
[1:05:02] of our conversation is what we call
[1:05:04] reminiscing
[1:05:07] do you remember when it used to be
[1:05:09] simple
[1:05:10] do you remember when there used to just
[1:05:13] be a few of us
[1:05:14] do you remember when things weren't so
[1:05:17] complicated
[1:05:18] do you remember when you knew everybody
[1:05:20] in church and everybody's name and and
[1:05:24] everybody was in diapers
[1:05:27] you know and now we've got
[1:05:30] children and grandchildren and
[1:05:33] and you reminisce
[1:05:36] when I meet an old buddy from high
[1:05:38] school or someone that I went through
[1:05:40] the message with
[1:05:42] you could reminisce I was visiting with
[1:05:45] brother
[1:05:47] Ron Peterson the other day and we
[1:05:49] started reminiscing all the different
[1:05:52] things we went through the time that I
[1:05:55] got locked out of my home and I had to
[1:05:59] spend time on his at his house that
[1:06:02] evening and
[1:06:03] and of course I was giving him a hard
[1:06:08] time we showed up it was rainy and dark
[1:06:10] and cold and had no place to go knocked
[1:06:14] on his door he gets up and
[1:06:16] and comes to the door and hears me and
[1:06:18] Leslie standing there with Sharon and he
[1:06:22] said man we don't got no place to go
[1:06:25] and he says well come on in and he gave
[1:06:27] us a spot on the floor to
[1:06:30] sleep on I kind of wished he'd give me
[1:06:33] his bed
[1:06:35] I let him know that all the time
[1:06:38] and and we he threw some blankets on the
[1:06:42] floor and we're on the floor and
[1:06:44] that morning last week he cuts up she
[1:06:46] was just a had a few diapers and they
[1:06:48] went to their washing machine and she
[1:06:50] washed the diapers we had only cloth
[1:06:53] diapers in those days
[1:06:54] for any of you young mothers you know
[1:06:58] but and all her diapers just came to
[1:07:01] pieces and just and she was standing
[1:07:04] over the washing machine crying as she
[1:07:06] pulled her diapers they were just
[1:07:09] shredded and Sandy came up and said well
[1:07:13] I have some diapers and and you know you
[1:07:17] you talk about those times
[1:07:20] and what you're doing is you're
[1:07:21] communing
[1:07:23] you're talking about all the things that
[1:07:25] got you to where you are
[1:07:27] all the things we've been to Ron has a
[1:07:30] church in Phoenix I have a church out
[1:07:32] here but remembered all our Boyhood days
[1:07:35] cutting Timber together and stacking
[1:07:38] logs and all the stuff that we went
[1:07:41] through that brought us to where we are
[1:07:44] that's communion
[1:07:46] and we talk about the battles he's
[1:07:49] fighting with his daughter and and and
[1:07:52] and encouraging one another
[1:07:55] in the Lord that's what you do with
[1:07:57] communion
[1:07:58] you go to the Lord and you think about
[1:08:00] where he brought you from
[1:08:02] when he talked to David he said David
[1:08:04] remember you were just in the Sheepfold
[1:08:07] and I raised you up and made you a king
[1:08:10] I was lost out in the world and you came
[1:08:13] found me and you talk it over with them
[1:08:17] and you
[1:08:19] reach out and tell you touch that great
[1:08:22] love vein that he has for you and you
[1:08:26] put him first in your mind and you put
[1:08:29] all that he done for you and how good
[1:08:31] he's been to you and all that he saved
[1:08:34] you from and you let that begin to
[1:08:38] come up in you and you tell them that
[1:08:41] you love them
[1:08:42] and that you're thankful
[1:08:44] and you're having a communion you have
[1:08:46] regrets
[1:08:49] that's why he died
[1:08:51] he died to take your regrets away the
[1:08:54] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:08:59] he took this suffering that we could
[1:09:01] have peace and we can have it abundantly
[1:09:04] in him by his stripes we are healed and
[1:09:09] we think of the promises that communion
[1:09:11] this is what communion is it's our time
[1:09:14] to reminisce and to fellowship and to
[1:09:18] commune with what a great God we have
[1:09:21] and as our brother spoke tonight that we
[1:09:23] purpose in our heart
[1:09:26] that we'll love with the same love that
[1:09:28] he loved us
[1:09:30] we'll forgive with the same forgiveness
[1:09:32] that he forgave us we'll turn the other
[1:09:36] cheek
[1:09:39] just like King David when he left the
[1:09:41] city and they began to speak spit on him
[1:09:44] he says no he says don't
[1:09:46] you know the Lord
[1:09:48] you know and just give everybody the
[1:09:52] benefit of the doubt I think the
[1:09:55] pressure that the world's trying to put
[1:09:57] on us will find out someone's got the
[1:09:59] pressure all in control and it's the one
[1:10:02] that loves us
[1:10:04] Amen Let us read for I have received of
[1:10:06] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:10:09] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:10:11] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:10:14] bread
[1:10:16] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:10:19] and said take it this is my body which
[1:10:24] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:10:27] of me remembrance reminiscing
[1:10:31] remembering me
[1:10:33] and after the same manner also he took
[1:10:36] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[1:10:39] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:10:42] this D as often as you drink it in
[1:10:46] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:10:48] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:10:51] show the Lord's death till he come
[1:10:54] whereforever whosoever shall eat of this
[1:10:57] bread and drink of this cup of the Lord
[1:10:59] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:11:03] and the blood of the Lord
[1:11:06] and if I could just add a little bit
[1:11:09] it's not that your life's mistake free
[1:11:13] you know that you haven't failed
[1:11:16] because you can repent and he's faithful
[1:11:19] and just to forgive you
[1:11:22] but if you come to communion with malice
[1:11:25] in your heart
[1:11:26] and hatred in your heart and bitterness
[1:11:29] in your heart after all that he forgave
[1:11:33] you of
[1:11:35] okay that's what you don't want to
[1:11:38] defile not the failures of your flesh
[1:11:44] but if you've got bitterness or you've
[1:11:46] got malice or you've got ought against
[1:11:49] somebody don't take communion till you
[1:11:51] make that right
[1:11:53] if you failed his grace is sufficient
[1:11:57] for you
[1:11:58] you repent of that you purpose in Your
[1:12:01] Heart Lord help me overcome
[1:12:04] you do what David said tonight you find
[1:12:08] the things that are causing it and you
[1:12:10] walk away from it you build a wall and
[1:12:13] you close the gate
[1:12:15] and then come and partake the main thing
[1:12:19] is don't partake with hatred or
[1:12:21] bitterness that defiles the very love
[1:12:25] that caused him to lay down
[1:12:28] his life
[1:12:32] he says but let a man examine himself
[1:12:37] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:12:41] drink of that cup
[1:12:43] examine yourself I'm wrong Lord that
[1:12:46] wasn't right I'm sorry I'll make it
[1:12:48] right
[1:12:49] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:12:52] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:12:54] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:12:57] body
[1:12:58] once again to the malice hatred not
[1:13:02] looking on that person the way God looks
[1:13:04] upon him not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:13:07] for this caused many are weak and sickly
[1:13:10] among you in many sleep for if we would
[1:13:13] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:13:17] but when we are judged we are chasten of
[1:13:19] the Lord
[1:13:21] that you we should not be condemned with
[1:13:23] the world
[1:13:24] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:13:26] together to eat Terry one for another
[1:13:29] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:13:31] home
[1:13:32] that you come not together unto
[1:13:34] condemnation
