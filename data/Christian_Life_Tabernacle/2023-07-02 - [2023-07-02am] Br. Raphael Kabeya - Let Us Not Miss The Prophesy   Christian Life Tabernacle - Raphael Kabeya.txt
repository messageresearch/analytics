[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] let's stand together this morning and open our service with prayer and uh Let It Be Your Song leader this morning so you're going to get a really old fashioned uh song service and uh but we just trust that it'll it'll be good as we prepare our hearts for the word of the Lord you love them this morning you know that he loves you amen that's the that's the most important part of it is that you know that he loves you then you know that he first loved you amen so that's the that's the part that we we love the most that as we open our service in prayer this morning we do want to remember we have a couple special requests I believe sister Clarice is headed towards Congo we want to remember her in prayer and then sister Alicia's honoredando's sister is uh in a coma it's a diabetic coma and usually you come out of those fine but we just pray that that her diabetes will go away and that she can get it under control and that God will be merciful anybody else have an unspoken request this morning he wanted to lift your hands he knows what you have need of but he wants you to make it known so when he answers it you have Fellowship together let us bow our heads in prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we come before you this morning with requests on our hearts and we have needs father in our lives and father our sisters traveling father and brother Matthews away preaching rather Cosman and his family Lord in Romania other members of our church vacationing

love you father there's something in our hearts that call for you love Lord we love to hear your word we desire that you speak to us and you lead us in New Height help us father we ask you to bless us now this morning in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen God bless you may be seated this morning as brother Mike comes in and brings us the psalm this morning we just trust that it'll be uh your portion as brother Mike's coming we want to remember that Labor Day weekend but we have youth meetings that everybody's invited to uh Friday evening at seven Saturday at six and Sunday morning at 11 followed by a six o'clock singing and brother Danny steaman will be ministering for us so we're certainly looking forward to that we don't usually announce things this early but nowadays time's going by so quick that it'll be here before you know it the following weekend will be in Phoenix ministering for whether Ron Peterson he asked me to do that and uh we're keeping his family in prayer and then in October um the seventh I think or somewhere in them there will be in uh in Cloverdale for brother uh Tom or ambrother at biscal so keep us in prayer brother Mike God bless you this morning always good to hear the word of exhortation my brother bless the Lord be with you today thank you when I put it on I could barely see so I'm glad it but it worked out good morning you know maybe it's uh just me but there are certain phrases that you know people use in casual conversation that I kind of walk away thinking you know maybe maybe we should think about that a little bit more before we say things like that you know one of those phrases that you hear quite a bit is when people say you know they say this will happen or they say this is what's going on or they say this is what it's like they say this and they say that and I always want to stop a minute and say wait a minute who's they let's let's you know sometimes it's used as a statement of Authority or truth and you know if words or thoughts expressed let's take a moment and think who's whose thoughts are these and let's get down to who's the they and they say and I was thinking about that as I was reading Psalm 129 this week and just kind of was going over in my mind and it's a different kind of chapter but it it starts out with this statement in verse one many a Time have they Afflicted me from my youth May Israel now say many a Time have they Afflicted me from my youth you know I thought about that as I was reading and I said wait a minute who's they we can find the answer in verse 5. it says them that hate Zion they those who hate Zion have Afflicted me from my youth who's that who hates Zion you know most people don't even know what Zion is you know most people are honestly clueless to the work that God is doing you know it says in verse 2 May Israel now say you know and I was reading that you know we tend to make this about a historical people or a geographic place the people who are descendants of Abraham and followers of Moses and those who may have historically hated them for political or religious reasons but you know Paul made clear in Romans 2 28 he said for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly no no neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God see Israel is not about a nation or a race but it's about a people with another kind of identifying characteristic and Paul goes on in Romans to describe that as being that Faith seed that Abraham had it's also not about following the religious teachings of Moses as Jesus told his told the Pharisees in John 5 or had he believed Moses you would have believed me for he wrote Of Me so Israel are those who share that same Faith seed as their father Abraham people who have their faith people they're revelated people they're people that have been awakened quickened by him who is the word of life as we've seen so many times in the psalm before Zion is not a geographic place on a map but it's that dwelling place where he dwells with his people that place of cohabitation where word is with word in Fellowship again that place that Jesus went to go prepare for us in John 14. so when we read this scripture they have afflicted me from my youth they that hate Zion you know how many of us can honestly say that you know we frequently encounter people who afflict us because we believe in having fellowship with the Lord I mean we occasionally encounter people who react negatively to us but continuously from our youth because we have fellowship with the Lord and yet as it says in Psalm 129 many a Time have they Afflicted me from my youth that's the testimony of those who are called Israel see how can people around us hate something they don't even recognize what's going on so what what is this who are they you know in his final words to his disciples before he went to the cross which that's just a wonderful portion of scripture to spend time in is those Final hours which Jesus spent with his disciples he said in John 15 18 if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because you are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you John goes on to say in first John 2 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is of the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world in James as always is most to the point he says in James 4 4 ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that friendship with the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God do you know what the definition of enmity is according to Webster hatred in other words the scriptural definition of hating the Lord is loving the world if Israel are those who like Abraham could be counted a friend of God and Zion is that place of Fellowship where God dwells with his people and of course friendship with the world fellowship with all that the world is that is hate of Zion as Jesus said no man can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you see they that hate Zion are not people all that is in this world that from our youth continually has that pull on us continually afflicts us continually tries to get us to find an alliance somewhere with a cheap alternative to that fellowship and that cohabitation to which we who are Israel have been called to replace the fellowship that he offers us with a worldly replacement many a Time have they all that is in the world Afflicted me from my youth May Israel Israel now say many a Time have they Afflicted me from my youth but I like this yet they have not prevailed against me I wonder if that's anyone's testimony this morning instead of them prevailing against me remember Jesus told Peter one day on Matthew in Matthew 16 Upon This Rock Revelation that Faith seed will I build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it we want to go ahead and stand this morning we're going to read Psalm 129 he says in verse 4 the Lord is righteous he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked I think we can say Amen to that those cords have been cut and they have not prevailed against me so let's just read that little Psalm together psalm 129. many a Time have they Afflicted me from my youth May Israel now say many a Time have they Afflicted me from my youth yet they have not prevailed against me flowers plowed upon my back they made long their furrows the Lord is righteous he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion let them be as the grass upon the house tops which withereth afford groweth up wherewith the mower filleth not his hand nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom neither do they which go by say the blessing of the Lord be upon you we bless you in the name of the Lord amen God bless you may be seated if you turn in your song books to number 28 feel my way every day with love amen isn't that what it's all about

to judge this church beneficiary benediction that they may benefit of the great things of redemption no but get us out of the way and bless us by Your Word because outside of your word we have nothing else in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may have a seat for a moment how great you're all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ my wife also joined me to greet you all uh [Music] I have to be honest with you or to be honest with you that you have a wonderful Church in Bonnie Lee's a wonderful Church and sample a fidelo prophet because God has given you a wonderful gift that's simple to the prophet MO SES honestly without a flattery I appreciate Brother David McGarry a profound he he brings the word holding on to the prophet in a simple but deep manner and I believe if you if you support the cause honestly God will do a lot of wonderful things among you um you know the the sun rises in silence but it does a lot of great work and I don't think it's a lot of noise or a lot of agitation that will do something for the people of God just the word of God and in this age do you see Revolution God revealed himself in Simplicity in using a simple man a envelope in coming here the last time I was telling Brother David I was very tired and com and you stop I didn't feel like standing up and preaching because I do a lot of work back home in Congo [Music] I would like this morning to give you the opportunity to see what we are doing before we get to the word you know I'm getting older Museum but I have a lot of Burden for the the souls in The Villages where people don't go that often because God has his children everywhere they are just not in big cities the in villages there are also children of God unfortunately Village one time I took a brother from here in the village back from Canada back in the village he preached under a tree and they were very happy to do that because that's what I do so I have a few images that I'd like to show you before we could get to the word on a technique let me show you the first image no that's not the first one but that's all right sassy cities okay that that image right there is a church that's about 140 kilometer from brazzerville it's a village when we get there there's a lot of people they're very enthusiastic you could see it's just a hanger with roof on top you can go to the next let's go to the next one I went to bless the wedding it was a couple of months ago it is 239 kilometers from Brazos we can go to the next one Village this this Village is named it's uh the village where the president comes from president that's the church we started over there there's a lot of people that come to that church people love the word they love this message because this message is different from denominations you can go to the next one which is the capital economic capital of Congo the museum we also have a group of people there is we were renting the place we already found the place that we're gonna we're starting the construction and you can go to the next thank you learn some Brazil verses in Brazil this is when he came to visit us so this is the main church it's my headquarters video and the next one is a video clip to show the the the new church that we are building thank you so yeah principal that says the the road yeah we started May 1st 2021 didn't even 2021. [Music] many people are asking when it's going to be the dedication we are trying to finalize all the work because at our old church there was no parking place [Music] it was a little bit difficult because people had to go park at the neighbors places so we're still working on it from May 1st 2021 we're still building and God is helping us move little by little looking [Music] um don't forget to please pray for those that are working with us because God hears prayers [Music] this is because those are tiles that we're already about to be placed in the sanctuary a portion of the times you see the Mason and you see that that's the main sanctuary [Music] we don't have any anything on top yet [Music] it's a little bit difficult for me to rest that's because in the inside the The Villages they call me foreign we have to go and help with the people's food people you have to pray for people even here from here they will call me I have to stop and and and and and answer and pray and see the work that we are trying to do we want to be we want you to pray for us I think that's good enough that's what all we wanted to show we can read the word second Peter chapter 1 verse 19. it's on the chair on the chair please we have also a more sure word of Prophecy we're unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light thy shineth and dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your heart session particularly knowing this first that no prophecy no Prophecy of the scriptures is of any private interpretation curves for the prophecy came not in the old time by the will of men by the holy man of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost the Lord had the blessing to the reading of his word our gracious father we just read as every man would read when you put us out of the way that you may take control and bless us this morning in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen have your seat [Music] a title this morning I want to title it let's not miss the prophecy let's not miss the prophecy is in a few or what uh in um I will start off by saying the prophet says this is we can we can we can be in this Accord we may not agree one with another a person there is nobody personally Young there's not two people with two minds exactly the same two two in the fingers together two of the fingers together the same person there's not two people with two two identical noses I believe that you have a brother that you don't have a nose like mine I told you this morning that you have a wonderful Pastor who brings you a word according to the prophet is I I cannot try to be like him because it's a person different from me but we have one thing in common it's Jesus Christ it's me that is saying this God has made us all different that's where I love the greatness of God that of the billions that they are in the world they are not two people that look alike because no one can do identical things like God can do everyone is every digital print is different from another remember even on my hand they are not prints that digital prints that looks the same that's why our God is really infinite as he knows all those things there's nothing that he doesn't know about you then God has made us different we have have to agree to that is is useless to try to imitate one another or imitate somebody or to want somebody to act like you everyone is different it don't sit but sit particularly and this particularity we are forming a Unity but I am one is the same with the body of Christ if we can understand that we're going to be patient with one another we're going to work together we're gonna uh complete one another in our differences but as I said moment ago there's one thing we have in common and that's Christ that's what we have in common he died for all of us and we are all under his blood says that's what makes a perfect Unity there's no way to that to make the churches that will be won we don't we're not looking for the unity of the churches we are looking for the unity of the faith regardless of what church you belong to we have the same faith in the message of the hour and then we have to take the message of the hour as he was brought to us and that's what I see being taught here and I'm very happy with it's a declaration that we need to take seriously a portion for each age we cannot take a message from one age to another age it won't work Moses could not preach the message of Noah no way and nowhere the same way he couldn't preach the message of someone else Martin Luther could not preach the Catholic message and we can go forward and to get to this age to say that it's useless that the Pentecostals though to continue with the Methodist matters because now the bride is being called out foreign and then we have to be well informed so we can understand what's supposed to happen in this age we in this age that we are living in we need to know what is supposed to happen says I'm not worshiping a Jew I worship God when I worship Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was not a Jew do you remember it was God himself in the human flesh it was the word that was in the beginning that was made flesh I don't worship some fiction or some kind of historic something he says I worship Jesus Christ the presence of Jesus Christ right now which which is me which means he which means that his word that's manifested in this age we have to be sure that we are hearing what the messenger is saying about the bride for this age and all that we have need of is only in the message the uh people's uh counseling or advice religious advice yes the advice of men the morality all those things are good but the life is only in the message of the hour God in every age is a lot of this word from the beginning beginning it took further seconds and in every time in each one of those ages past [Music] God sends down an anointed Prophet for that age yes they're not what we need is what comes out of his mouth because he's the one who's mandated by God it says in the days of nowhere and the days of the rest of them when he made his promises [Music] I don't care what kind of condition the church has gotten into God always does that he sends an anointed man the churches don't want to listen to The Prophet anymore they go towards popularity or they go towards things that capture the eyes entertainment so they can attract a crowd um God always sends a prophet and they will say behold that Saint Jude the Prophet Elijah the prophet regardless of what's shining to the left of the right the elected have been warned God has showed them what they should follow what seasons behold I sent you Elijah the prophet is the only person that would attract the attention of the elected in in fact the word of the the word of the Lord comes to the prophet prophet and he's and here it stoods it's time and even though he was condemned by the organization he stood on the word and made the word live I want you to understand my brother my sister do you remember that the word of God being God himself if this message comes from God it's it's life who's living when you hear it you take it as it was given some member who without even you being prayed for just God can answer to your needs is when you received the word the word will act you will not understand why is this one or that live you leave you the word in action in your life but the churches they they create confusion and that brings a uh an obscurity on people and that's where we are if you look carefully where we come from it's very far but where are we going it's very near but look at how churches are fighting so they can be the first leaders so they can have the leadership the the the the the Saints are not looking for leadership the Saints are looking to lift up Jesus Christ and to lift up Jesus Christ he should lift up the word of the hour so that people will only see the word of the hour because life is in the word of the hour not in me I hope you understand secondly every Church wants to be the head and every Minister what he wants to think he's the only one who understands the prophet or who thinks is Anointed like William Branham no but William Branham had a special anointment regardless of what God can do with you don't try to equate yourself with the prophets there's only one in every age that has to be manifested in every season those citizens in this season we have to hear malachite 4. when you talk we hear that you are a disciple of Malachi and if we have a model the one to follow it's malachite foreign and try to live the message that's what I think and then my friends it's the only light for this hour only the predestinated will Manifest this word because they always try to hang themselves to the the the the word of God for the age and it's always the same every time because the word of God comes to the prophets every Prophet reveals it to his people and his people believe what the prophet have said then when we stand here we are auxiliary or just dress well for the party a dress word that said have a message or to take away from him or just to say what the boss said you want I hope you understand because God is a lot of the message and when you follow that message you are putting God in action in the message Rapture paragraph 47 . God allotted his word out of to each age and each one of those those ages or those age has to manifest that second This Is Us do a manifestation each of those age has to manifest that our desire is to become one with the message and the message has to be brought to us he also for ordained men for that age to fulfill that word every time he allotted his word he allowed the men for it Buddhism not to man not two people not three we don't have a replacement for William Branham William Branham is an individual they were not eight stars in the hand of God there were only seven stars there's no replacement it's this message that brings us into the Rapture there is nobody who's supposed to to take it off we don't believe in things like that then my friends when when he he went he a lot of the Tire Moses he allotted Moses to it and and when Moses went Jesus Joshua didn't have another message Joshua was repeating the message of Moses every time he didn't have anything to add to it he didn't put himself forward when Moses was speaking he was saying what was already said you understand is to repeat what the prophet said don't think by adding is going to have more power in repeating the prophet you give life to people foreign a lot of the time for the Son of God to be born he allotted him to it and see then for every age God being infinite to prison all-powerful goodness knowing the end before the beginning he he allotted man says he a lot of men there is nothing that will take place everything is already perfect and everything is working according to the plan of God I want you to listen my brother to in order for him to invite the Believers of his time for them not to go away from the prophecy so they may not miss the prophecy the Apostle Paul says this first Corinthians 15 uh one to two um First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1 to 2. I remember you know more more of a brighter and seconds I declare unto you the gospel which I have preached unto you which you have also received wherein he stands I'll stop right there I I record I declare unto you the gospel which I have preached unto you which you have also received is and to hear the gospel to receive the Gospel it's not the essential oh I received the message let's go a little further that you have received in which you have stand to live stand every day of the church you don't miss it every time when there's a meeting you were always there foreign that believe this message but in vain [Music] it says we find the same model in every age it comes through a messenger but because if there's two people if there's two ideas but God always sends one light comes by one man the light will spread forth by the ministry of those who were faithful who were taught by whom faithful and taught by who by the Holy Ghost it's him our teacher when you love the prophet you recognize this extraordinary Ministry you have the desire to hold on to that message the sentence will remember and the Holy Spirit himself will teach you says but it's evident that all of those that go out they don't always learn and they don't always learn how important it is to say what the messenger said that's why my brothers let's not condemn people it's God who's doing his work let's just try to be faithful to God because God knows who's who your desire is to conform yourself to the word how how important it is to say what the messenger said so whenever remember Paul I warned the people to only say what he said First Corinthians 14 and 37 Secrets if someone believes to be a prophet or inspired that he may recognize that what I'm telling you is a commandment from the lord it's from you that's the word of Lord the Lord came to us is it only to you that he spoke to you they add here or they take away here yeah and before too long message is no longer pure and the Revival dies that's why people raise up do you want disagree God anoint churches the true Holy Spirit went anoint them and when they see the actions of God instead of being humble and lift up the God Amen people lift up themselves and they feel they are important that they can lead everybody and then the Revival dies he has to be the only one that's lifted up oh how we have to be careful to only listen to One voice because the spirit only has one voice the voice of God you are here believing the message that I am the voice of God to you I take what the voice of God said to tell you foreign [Music] to hear the voice of God Through The Messengers somewhere in question and answer something uh January 12 1961 the prophet will say we are the messenger of the same Ministry Minister Believers We Are The Messengers of this message to bring to the people the testimony of the things that God has done [Music] it's a prophecy we have to know what is the prophecy and watch with all the uh particular attention not to deform the prophecies let the prophecy be exactly if we don't know what the prophecy is in all kinds of uh uh trouble and we're gonna be uh Carried Away by all kinds of window doctrines if we don't know what the prophecy is so we can watch over we can easily be carried away by all kinds of doctrines all the people that believe that they are something because of a certain signature they can attract our attention if we don't know but we know that God spoke in this age and that's the only light we have to say a lighter path on the road my friends I Believe In 1980 this message I heard and I've seen all kinds of things movements and all kinds of things new doctrines New Revelations that were coming forth yes today you have to say certain words otherwise you don't have the right Revelations I saw all kinds of emotions and all kinds of tendencies that conquer the whole world may listen but let me tell you that's a message of William Branham is alive the transformation in its work of transformation when you just speak the message as the message is being presented without any wrong you don't know what work God is doing in them because the message is God this is your Buckle the sentence and then I believe the Holy Ghost religion we have been I have been given to us so we can warn people the things that were uh of currently we are here to warn you should be actually the the things that are currently that people are kind of uh uh uh uh blind to it the Bible says God cannot do anything unless he Reveals His secret to the servant the prophetam says Jesus warned the people about what was going to happen in this step in this day the prophet also warned the people the same way then it's to our interests right now so we can be prepared for the deceitful time that we are living in and to know what is it that we need to turn to amenities then this little subject let's not miss the prophecy attention it's a subject that seems a little bit uh unusual that we have probably spoken on many times but I believe I feel in my heart because they want to speak every year that I want to keep your spirit awake to the deceitfulness that's reigning foreign [Music] [Music] and this message alone is enough we we should only we only have to be happy with malachite on itself malachite for itself that's Christ this message is Christ there's a lot of Messengers today they have a lot of subject and and ideas to develop and present to people The Pride doesn't need all of that the bride is growing in in the light in the sunlight we are living in a very deceitful age where the the false and the truth seems to be so close but Jesus says that the two Spirits they'll be so close but they will deceive they're very enact if it was possible even uh I want to go by e sharks I want to buy sharks for my car live under representative uh the the seller is presenting me three pieces looking identical it is this this one is 300 000. this is a little bit higher it's 450 it's uh and this one is 700. which one are you taking I asked why different prices they look the same it looks the same it's the same but it's not the same this is the first quality this is the second quality and that's the third quality which one do you want developer I want the First Quality and the First Quality is not what the preacher said not the opinion of man the first question is what William Branham said it's not popular it doesn't do so people will clap for you but it's the truth you understand Matthew 24. [Music] because people like to see those things how many saw it at Israel coming out of Egypt but how many entered though let's look at the essentials what is what is it is what God Said the people listen to the multitude but God told them I have given you the country this message it's our inheritance don't look at anything else in Matthew 25 the Lord adds and says behold I wanted to to let you know in advance I want you to know that I I to announce to you the characteristics of the age that we are living in this day that we are living in La prolification the multiplication of the false Christ and false prophet don't worry they are anointed of the of the true Holy Ghost they are anointed of the true and authentic Holy Ghost and she still offended Thomas it's the end time now how many times we have left I don't know but it was it was told to us by the Lord by the Lord Jesus Christ when we see the things that we are seeing at this time know that our Redemption is near we have to lift up our heads now I read to you the prophet in the anointed one in the end time paragraph 22. I really get into my message now now seeing all of this accumulation of evidence that's the hour that we we now live in Japan I think it's a good thing to rehearse these things and to draw them out since the seals have been opened it issues and find the truth of these things [Music] as God has been so loyal to us with its Grace to show us these things I want you to notice here in Matthew 24 the Christian Jesus used the term Christ Christ the Christian Christ plural not Christ not singular you divorce me you're going forward okay see one but Christ not Christ or plural but Christ plural purposely not singular decreased Christ the word Christ means anointed it's talking about anointed there will not be one may please one they anointed all the men of God are they not anointed foreign if he wants to break it down so we would more or less understand it better the full one he would say in the last day they shall be they shall rise false anointed ones can possible now that seems almost impossible the terms anointed but notice the very next words the full Prophet prophet and false prophet Prophet plural now anointed one is one with a message and the only way the message could be brought out is by one that's anointed one that would be a prophet is they shall rise false anointed and Prophet um anointed anointed teacher false prophet anointed false teaching no what is it and Prophet I'm saying so message a prophet teaches his message anointed teachers the people that are anointed having false teaching this one decrease anointed one or anointed plural and if Christ in singular exists [Music] and that will be the prophecy and it's the teaching that will make the difference I'll go back and if the Christ will simply exist in singular exists is that true it's for him that we are here still exist if he exists then there would be anointed yes that they were teaching that would make a difference because they are anointed once anointed prophecy I told you this message is a prophecy the message of the end time is a prophecy it's their teaching on the prophecy that makes the difference the prophet that gives the prophecyte he is calling for faithfulness to what he said he says I am responsible for this message it's only say what I'm saying it's not me but it's him that is saying everyone and I believe they're true I know you had once from this they have to understand that language because the difference between the true and the false it's the teaching on the prophecy which is this message now Jesus said that the rain shall fall on the just and the unjustice is that true now someone can tell me do you believe that the anointing that on on these people is the true anointing yes this is where it becomes complicated it says certainly the true anointing of the Holy Spirit on the person but the Ben is false that's why you don't follow the signs or the the things oh come follow me I'm this I'm dead the message being a prophecy follow the message [Music] even Jesus was not advertising of himself like that didn't do that they they remain humble [Applause] be careful with that now listen carefully so we can understand what he said and they will do signs and wonders in so much that they will deceive the very elective were possible he so when you sent this sentence they are anointed with a genuine Holy Ghost holy spirit says no I know this sounds very uh foolish but I'm going to take time to explain it by the word because that that's absolutely that say of the Lord now look at my brother look fit the world Listen the the fact that you have signs it doesn't make you a man of God but a man of God has to have signs you believe that let's be uh balance will follow but it's not the main thing now it's also the answer to Matthew um Matthew 7 21-23 Equity lessons those that say Lord Lord they shall not enter into the kingdom of God but only those that will do the will of my father who's in heaven many will say to me on that day Lord Lord if we not prophesy by thy name in Prophecy correct a correct prophecy that's come to pass they were healed in a very evident way but is that the main thing Jesus never denied that they could do signs and wonders that can only be done by the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost working in them and Jesus Christ is recognizing that's the Holy Ghost but it says but he never knew them they were not backsliders not born again reproving oh yeah they were the seed of the devil but manifesting the power of God and that's [Music] we cannot pretend color manifestation manifestation is the proof that we are born of the spirit you see why people are being led uh deceived so many signs where the elect will be deceived if it were possible even if that one individual has manifestation in abundance it's not really getting you away from the emotions the proof that we have received the Holy Ghost today it's exactly the same as it was in the days of our Lord Jesus Christ is to receive the word the truth of the age that you are living in is it and this word it will not lift you up above others this word a man who's trying to Reign Over the Earth this word will make you one of them's friends we are all Brothers we are all walking together under the same Block it's not one who's above we are all equal to uh in in in front of the word all saved by grace we are all the same excuse me excuse me okay that we have received the Holy ghosts it's the same as it was in the days of the Lord Jesus is to receive the word of Truth for the age that you are living in [Music] Portland Jesus has never insisted so much on the importance of works but rather the importance of the word listen he knew that if people will receive the word signs will follow that's the Bible I have a lot of testimonies just a word that's not it just the word it's not by strength God is Not Enough God is in his word [Music] my brother my sister don't put your don't put the accent or the the the the uh on the signs and the the Wonders put the accent on the message that is God himself the word receive all the words give him the first place and then you will receive the power of God in you and I believe God is here anointed one in the end time it says now um we're gonna take our time to understand a fundamental reality because I'm here addressing something that is seems uh unusual Commando sentence people how can the Holy Ghost anoint a false teacher you understand that's what Jesus said will come to pass uh now compare with Matthew 4 and 25 and 24 5 and 24 again Jesus said that the rain and the Sun come upon the Earth that God sends it to prepare the food and the things for the people of the earth and the rain is sent for the food the herbs [Music] but the tears the wheat being in the field receive the same thing the same rain that makes the wind to grow the same rain makes the wheat to grow how much and it was the truth so if you only look at the size of the church the movement of that looks to seem to be in the church or the prophecy or the speaking look at the life of the message that's when someone who gives himself to God can see uh amazed when he saw that he says paragraph 36. foreign now therefore the rain dropping down upon the natural vegetation of the earth is the same type of the spirit rain which which uh which the spiritual Reign which give of God's spirit upon this church notice it's very strange thing here when them seeds went into the ground it says however they got there the rain that fall upon them only revealed the nature that was in them and in the Earth the wheat is there were wheat and weed there was the weed the wheat little pin I'm trying to find there were wheat he available in the ground when the seed Falls there were the wheat there were uh tones they were herbs they were there to begin with and every herbs in reproducing himself original showed what it was in the beginning in the original in other words every seed is what the Creator decided in the original if you are weed tonight you don't have to connect the the the turn it's the maker or the Creator who decided that is let's just remain in our camp and lift up Jesus Christ every seed is what the Creator decided from the beginning and when you realize don't look it to the left and right so you can advertise yourself you didn't do anything for you to become weak just glorify them oh thank you God thank you foreign and they will deceive the elect if we were possible because they are getting the same reign s same blessing foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] now a torn neport cannot help being a torn neither neither can the wheat that's what the Creator each determined at the beginning that's the elect they elect they have the the eyes looking at the one who elected them they don't have to the Rejoice because you didn't do anything to become an elasticity it's God who chose you hear me blessed be the name of the Lord and to testify of his good be doing because remember we're at the at the we are looking for the last election because maybe it's your testimony that will bring forth the last one we are living by dead substance that's the only way we can live then isn't it true that if your body has to live by that substance for the natural life then then someone's Gotta Die the holy spirit in the spiritual world to save your spiritual life and God became material God became material flesh and he died there's no church there's no other things in the world can save you but God shows that's the only thing that that they live by what things the word of the hour [Music] hold ourselves to this message foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] expose yourself to the sun which is the message as long as you expose yourself to the message you become the right until the maturity we have to find God's way of doing things and we have to hold on to God's way of doing things let God reveal himself to the people don't incite them to be baptized by foreign um though your Harvest will be great so you are you are facing the message and you are living the message yourself and we can't present anything else outside of the message so we have to uh dig the Earth everywhere we have to dig the Earth everywhere so we can only uh we can we can bury only the seed because because it's already later than we think there's no time to work again let's let's uh uh show the message so let's tell the Earth and and let's show the message because if you are not sowing the message there's not going to be a harvest so you have to sow in order for you to wait for the Harvest now as we are gathered here we have to think on these things before it's too late I think people are no longer I have a Zeal to bring the message to the world people are no longer testifying to the people that they meet that God sent the prophets people are no longer talking to the world and telling them that the the time the time is at end let's not be ashamed to to Proclaim or to testify of the goal of this message it was told to the prophet when he was baptizing Baptist that as John the Baptist was sent to to prepare the first coming to massage your message the second coming of the lord we are in the message so we can tell the world that Jesus is coming soon everything will change soon we're going to disappear celebrity that's the truth [Music] the message of the hour day and night then [Music] is far away from all the the compromises lately they pushed the Christians the church uh bride of Christ will Proclaim every promise to be the truth and I believe we are at the end time and as the time comes closer the head is coming down until the head and the body become one because he's our husband and we are his wife they are one they don't look at the figures and in the in the case of some we are flesh of his flesh word of his words life of his life Spirit of his spirit and to eat of the word without understanding life will reflect the Life of Christ let's bow ahead if we could stand semester my brother my sister let's not miss the prophecy there's a lot of things to say on that this is I went a little bit fast because I didn't have my watch to watch to to follow I don't want to I don't want to go past the time God and His word is one and the same thing Christ is in him foreign [Music] just continue to to drink and to grow that's what you have to do because this message is the truth there's no rivalry with a message and everything that you have need of says it's in you right now when you receive the Holy Ghost then everything that you have needed is in you right now that he provided the sacrifice and you will receive what you have asked foreign [Music] [Music] the seed of all is in the word a problem familiar then it may be a family problem everything is in the word there is in the word transformation enough power to transform your life right now put it into your heart place the word into your heart don't dig it up so you can see if the seed is growing when the seed is planted they leave it alone you just water it what are the seed that's in your heart with faith let it be there and and the Harvest will come come as our heads are bowed our heavenly father [Music] that we may have confidence in the message of the messenger [Music] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] Lord God bless you you know you know the importance of Revelation if you know his voice you don't listen look for another my sheep know my voice and another they won't follow if you have an absolute that's what settles it that's the problem today people don't have a revelation of The Voice they don't have a revelation of what the message is and who brought it and how it was brought so they heat to themselves having itching years many teachers never coming to the realization of the truth aren't you glad that you've got that Revelation in your heart that you know his voice amen and you know you're convinced and then you're concerned if you're not convinced then you're always looking but once you've come into your heart it's wonderful amen we have a baptism this morning brother Paul's daughters going to be baptized in brother Paul a few times go get ready at this time and that will have that baptism any of us that might have to leave feel free to go at this time and we'll just trust that the Lord will bless you so let us bow our heads this morning as we prepare for the baptism and your heart you've heard a straightforward word this morning and that's the question who are you following who are you listening to what leads you are you convinced this morning are you concerned have you put your anchor in the Rock and beyond a shadow of a doubt you know what your path is and if that settled in your heart you don't go to the left you don't go to the right I've heard his voice I'm not going to follow a stranger our gracious Heavenly Father I'm sure each of us as our brother brought out we're all different we're all individual and we appreciate that father because then we all know we can have our own individual affairs [Music] or that you spoke to us the time that you moved upon our heart the time that we heard your voice and it was quickened in our spirit that this is your voice this is your word this is the path I'm going to take Lord and it's the children of Israel we take heed from the lesson that they gave us they got tired of the Mana they used supplied and they longed for a different taste a different flavor a different move but that movement never brought them to the promised land the two that stuck with it all the way through were the ones that made it father may we like Joshua and Caleb take the unadulterated word not vary from it at all but stay ever true we ask that you'd grant that to us father May that Revelation come in our heart that this wesage in this word is never failing never ending and all fulfilling we trust it with all our hearts and Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen God bless you as we go to prepare for the baptism but [Music] we're going to have to do that whose job is that to have that ready okay all right well I guess the pool's not ready so we're going to have to baptize this evening we need to keep it ready alrighty God bless you let's sing this song this evening amen How Deep The Father's Love For Us [Music] Mercy says [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] it is [Music] thank you please stop [Music] listening [Music] foreign foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
