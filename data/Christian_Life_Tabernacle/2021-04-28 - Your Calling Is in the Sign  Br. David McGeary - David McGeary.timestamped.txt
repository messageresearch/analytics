[34:09] lord just such a touch on our hearts and

[34:15] we are so dedicated to that race
[34:20] that we'd never turn to the left or the
[34:22] right
[34:24] but we'd set our eyes on high and
[34:28] look up for our redemption draweth nine
[34:32] that our lives would so be on fire
[34:38] as we look for your great appearing lord
[34:42] jesus
[34:43] we ask you to bless the people tonight
[34:45] father there
[34:48] your children they've been purchased
[34:50] with a great price
[34:53] lord you had them in your mind before
[34:56] there ever was a star
[34:57] [Music]
[34:59] and you brooded over all of history and
[35:02] mankind
[35:04] until the hour came of their birth
[35:09] because without them you are not
[35:11] complete
[35:13] that's how marvelous your love to us was
[35:17] we ask you to bless us tonight in jesus
[35:20] name we pray
[35:22] amen if you have your bibles
[35:26] and you'd open with me to the book of uh
[35:31] revelations the third
[35:35] chapter of the book of revelations and
[35:38] we'd like to read
[35:40] from the 20th the verse
[35:43] uh we'd like just to we're going to play
[35:46] a little portion of a message tonight
[35:49] and then we'd like if we had a a sermon
[35:52] title
[35:53] or a thought for this little lesson
[35:57] tonight it would be called your calling
[36:01] was in the sign your calling is in the
[36:05] sign
[36:06] so we just like to do that and he said
[36:09] behold
[36:11] i stand at the door and knock
[36:16] any man hear my voice and
[36:19] open the door i will come in
[36:22] to him and will sup with him
[36:26] and he with me to him that overcometh
[36:31] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[36:35] even as i also overcame and
[36:38] set down with my father in his throne
[36:42] he that hath an ear let him
[36:45] hear what the spirit saith unto
[36:49] the churches amen god bless you may be
[36:52] seated
[36:56] we're going to play a little portion and
[36:59] just have a little fellowship
[37:03] out of the message called the voice of
[37:06] the sign
[37:08] the voice of the sign and
[37:13] so how would you know
[37:17] which voice to hear there's so many
[37:20] voices
[37:22] well god was so beautiful that he gave
[37:25] the voice
[37:27] a sign and so that
[37:30] the the there's a voice that
[37:33] always follows the sign and so
[37:36] as we listen to this
[37:40] uh i as brother branham is laying out
[37:45] the purpose of a sign and the fact that
[37:47] god sent a sign and it's got to be a
[37:50] godly sign
[37:52] you know what i mean it's got to be
[37:53] vindicated by god
[37:55] and prove to god but there's a reason
[37:58] that he sends this sign because that's
[38:02] where our
[38:03] calling is our calling is in
[38:06] that sign we receive our calling
[38:10] from that sign so let us just listen to
[38:13] for a few moments and
[38:16] i think it's about 30 i'm not sure and
[38:20] if
[38:20] and i know that you can look as you as
[38:23] we read
[38:24] i think if you are speak spanish i think
[38:27] you can go to your phone
[38:29] and find it we're starting in about
[38:31] paragraph
[38:33] 25 and we're going to
[38:37] go through paragraph 95
[38:40] and then i think it's also in the other
[38:43] languages but it was preached in
[38:46] in 1964
[38:49] on 214 1964
[38:54] and is that valentine's day
[38:58] 14 good so what a love letter from the
[39:02] lord to us amen
[39:06] this is uh you know i was talking with
[39:09] the brothers the church
[39:10] is talking a lot about maturing
[39:14] and i think when you want to mature
[39:18] i think it's really good to know your
[39:21] foundation
[39:23] you understand why that we are where we
[39:26] are today
[39:27] why we're here what brought this message
[39:30] to us
[39:31] and why we follow it so let us just
[39:34] enjoy this
[39:36] for a little bit this evening and then
[39:38] we'll just take a few moments to comment
[39:40] it
[39:40] when we're done but i believe you'll
[39:43] really
[39:44] enjoy it and then i'd like just to read
[39:48] a statement that you are going to hear
[39:51] but but just keep it
[39:55] in your mind it will come very in the
[39:57] right in the beginning of the
[39:59] text it says and now we find out
[40:03] that usually just at
[40:07] those joint crossroads
[40:10] of an exodus the unusual
[40:14] begins to happen i believe
[40:18] we're there again i believe we're there
[40:22] at the exodus of the bride
[40:25] to go meet the bridegroom i believe
[40:29] the exodus is at hand
[40:32] and and he'll tell us how we know that
[40:35] god bless you as we you listen to this
[40:37] few moments of the tape it'll be a
[40:39] blessing to you
[40:40] god bless you
[40:43] god is so unusual he does things in such
[40:46] an unusual way
[40:47] so contrary to science so contrary to
[40:51] education
[40:52] so contrary to sometimes man's theology
[40:56] just contrary to that god does that just
[40:59] to show
[41:00] he's god and to do that he has to take
[41:02] somebody that knows none of these things
[41:04] so that he can work through that person
[41:07] when jesus come why didn't he take care
[41:09] of us as the priest that was trained and
[41:11] ready for the job
[41:12] he went out and got man that couldn't
[41:13] even sign their name
[41:15] ignored and unlearned the bible said
[41:17] they were because
[41:18] god takes nothing to make something out
[41:20] of it
[41:22] and whenever you get to a place that you
[41:24] feel that you're
[41:25] nothing then you're just about ready to
[41:26] come to god when when you get to a place
[41:28] that you know nothing
[41:29] but you want to know something then
[41:31] he'll reveal himself to you
[41:33] now notice when this unusual thing
[41:37] never happened in the world as we know
[41:39] of it was
[41:40] just the time of the exodus
[41:44] the exodus was at hand and
[41:48] when exodus means being taken out
[41:51] brought out
[41:52] and now we find out that usually
[41:56] just at those a joint
[41:59] crossroads of an exodus the unusual
[42:02] begins to happen
[42:05] i believe we're there again i believe
[42:08] we're there
[42:09] at the exodus of the bride
[42:12] to go meet the bridegroom i believe that
[42:15] exodus
[42:16] is at hand and this exodus to be brought
[42:20] from
[42:21] from egypt back to their homeland
[42:25] where they were promised to come was
[42:27] just at hand in
[42:29] god had to re-educate his man
[42:32] remember moses was educated for 40 years
[42:35] getting all of his doctor's degree and
[42:37] everything
[42:38] and taking god just another four years
[42:40] to take out of him
[42:41] what education put any 40 years
[42:45] in the wilderness what taking it take it
[42:47] out
[42:48] it was to put it in then in the all this
[42:51] great
[42:52] uh thing was out of him god appeared to
[42:55] him in a form of a burning bush
[42:58] now i'll show you it was out of him now
[43:01] if
[43:01] not now moses being a
[43:04] scientist he would have went to take
[43:07] some of those leaves
[43:09] off of a tree and take them down to the
[43:11] laboratory and have them examine to see
[43:13] what kind of a chemical it was sprayed
[43:15] with
[43:15] that that tree could burn and not burn
[43:17] up see because
[43:18] now the egyptians were smart
[43:23] scientific people more smarter in
[43:26] science than we are today peruse that
[43:29] they could embalm a body that still
[43:31] looks natural today we can't do that
[43:33] build a clear maze we couldn't do that
[43:35] the things that they had were far beyond
[43:37] our signs today
[43:39] and so moses was trained in all the
[43:41] wisdom so that
[43:42] made him a scientist so you see when he
[43:45] come in the presence
[43:47] of this bush he knows the bush
[43:50] had what he left if we could only do
[43:54] that today
[43:55] if we could only know the phenomena of
[43:57] god has got
[43:58] what we lack in our denominations but
[44:01] our educational system
[44:03] lacks god's god in the phenomena of the
[44:07] presence of christ
[44:08] that's what we need now we find out this
[44:12] exodus at hand god
[44:15] met moses and told him what
[44:19] was going to take place and give him two
[44:21] signs
[44:23] and each sign has a voice
[44:27] a voice of a sign every sign
[44:30] from god is followed by a voice
[44:34] every time god gives a true sign
[44:37] there's a voice that follows it when you
[44:40] see some kind of phenomena come along
[44:43] and watch it move and it don't change
[44:45] into something
[44:46] then it never comes from god god don't
[44:50] just
[44:50] show signs just to show he's god there's
[44:54] a voice that follows that sign
[44:56] uh by god's help you'll find that in the
[44:58] scripture tonight and see if that's the
[45:00] truth
[45:00] thing here the bernie bush was a sign
[45:06] to moses that was a sign and
[45:09] it was given to and he heard the voice
[45:12] from the bush
[45:13] now notice god
[45:16] never changes his program
[45:20] he never has to take his words back
[45:23] his first decision is perfect i can make
[45:26] a decision i'll say well i was wrong
[45:29] see i'm a man you can make one and you
[45:31] have to take it back
[45:32] science makes it and takes it back do
[45:34] you know that
[45:35] they can scientifically prove it to be
[45:37] right and that you always scientifically
[45:39] prove it's wrong
[45:40] but they won't admit theirs they won't
[45:43] admit this
[45:45] uh french scientists about 600 years ago
[45:48] or something like that
[45:49] rolling a ball at a certain speed around
[45:51] the globe
[45:52] being the earth or or 200 years ago i
[45:54] believe was the three something like
[45:56] that
[45:56] any high e scientifically proved by the
[45:59] raising of this fall at the speed
[46:01] if if someone would go the terrific
[46:03] speed of 30 miles an hour
[46:05] anything traveling upon the earth is the
[46:07] speed of 30 miles an hour
[46:09] gravitation loses hope to be taken off
[46:11] the earth you think science goes back
[46:13] and recognizes that
[46:14] no they're going on and on and on see
[46:17] but ministers are always trying to refer
[46:20] back to what somebody else said way back
[46:22] behind them
[46:22] instead of what god said do we're
[46:25] climbing the tree of faith
[46:28] see and god never changes his program
[46:31] you can rest solely on what god says the
[46:34] first time
[46:34] he ever has to stay with them
[46:38] he cannot he cannot and never did at any
[46:41] time
[46:42] change it because if he doesn't he's
[46:45] finite like we are
[46:46] he makes mistakes he has to apologize
[46:49] and go back
[46:50] but he is the source of all wisdom
[46:53] source of all power infinite omnipresent
[46:57] on that mission
[46:58] omnipotent see he's just he's god if he
[47:01] isn't all those things and he isn't god
[47:04] but he has to be that to be god now
[47:07] god never did use some man-made program
[47:11] to honor him
[47:12] let's just put it to disgrace god
[47:16] always uses a single individual
[47:20] just once never organization
[47:23] never a denomination he uses one
[47:27] single person because we different all
[47:29] one from another
[47:31] there was never two major prophets on
[47:33] the earth at one time
[47:35] never he doesn't do it because it just
[47:37] speaks to that one
[47:39] when that was gone he raises another to
[47:41] speak at that time
[47:42] remember that's always been his program
[47:46] now we find out here that burning bush
[47:48] was a sign
[47:49] it was given to attract the attention
[47:52] of moses now that's what god gives a
[47:55] sign for
[47:56] is to attract the tension of the people
[48:01] that's what a sign is for to attract
[48:03] attention you know we go down through
[48:04] the scripture here as we
[48:06] teach it now for a few minutes and find
[48:08] out if that isn't so that he gives these
[48:11] signs to attract
[48:12] detention and then when he gets the
[48:15] attention of the people
[48:17] then the voice of the sign begins to
[48:20] speak
[48:21] jesus healed the sick to attract the
[48:23] tension see
[48:24] then when he begins to preach always it
[48:27] attracts attention
[48:29] the burning bush was given to moses to
[48:31] attract
[48:32] the runaway prophet's attention and he
[48:36] turned aside to see what it was
[48:38] then the sign gave a voice
[48:41] yes amen the sign
[48:44] itself gave a voice now
[48:47] these voices and signs are to
[48:50] alert the people of god's word
[48:54] is just about ready to be vindicated
[48:58] always the sign is to attract the
[49:00] tensions people
[49:01] now many of you bible readers that are
[49:03] thinking now
[49:04] of different places in the bible we're
[49:06] going to come to some of them
[49:08] that when a sign is given it attracts
[49:11] the
[49:11] attention of the people because god is
[49:14] getting ready to speak
[49:15] he wants an audience when somebody is
[49:19] going to listen to what he's going to
[49:20] say
[49:22] see now always does that
[49:25] his word alerts them of
[49:29] this this time is an
[49:32] alert to attract the attention of the
[49:35] people that the word
[49:36] is getting ready to speak now
[49:40] notice he is going to speak by his
[49:44] promised word something that he said
[49:46] he's going to do
[49:47] notice uh i have
[49:51] heard and i remember my promise
[49:55] i heard their cries in egypt i remember
[49:59] what i promised abraham see what he's
[50:02] going to do
[50:03] he attracted his attention now he's got
[50:05] his word he's going to give it to the
[50:07] prophet moses because
[50:09] that was is and ever
[50:12] is his way of speaking amen amen that's
[50:16] what he does
[50:16] at the beginning that's why he does it
[50:18] now he ever does it the same
[50:19] thing the word comes to the prophet and
[50:22] moses was the prophet
[50:24] and now he has to prophesy that he was
[50:26] going to
[50:27] bring israel out and say i was going to
[50:29] do it but he was going to bring them
[50:32] out of egypt and then he had heard their
[50:34] cries
[50:35] and their groans and their prayers they
[50:37] were only
[50:39] waiting for god
[50:42] god was waiting on them he had his
[50:44] prophet out there in the wilderness
[50:45] but he was only waiting for the people
[50:48] to call him into action
[50:51] i believe he's got the same thing today
[50:53] waiting for his church to
[50:55] call it on the scene
[50:57] [Music]
[51:00] the promise of today is ready
[51:03] but he's got to get the people to
[51:06] praying and groaning like they were
[51:08] down there then it'll come on the scene
[51:12] yeah the moses was out in the wilderness
[51:14] holding there for 40 years
[51:15] the people rejected the the sign of the
[51:18] thing he did down there and
[51:19] were killing the egyptian it wasn't
[51:21] god's way so he put him out in the
[51:23] wilderness and
[51:24] and re-educated now to the phenomena and
[51:26] now he's ready
[51:28] and god said i heard their groans i've
[51:30] seen their thrones their
[51:32] past masters whipping them and i
[51:34] remember my promise
[51:37] amen see he's ready to speak now
[51:40] he's got everything in order now he
[51:42] shows the phenomena that attract the
[51:44] attention of the prophet
[51:46] when the prophet got down there he
[51:47] showed the phenomena because he loves
[51:50] god's voice amen how could a man pick up
[51:54] dust and throw it and say
[51:55] just sayeth the lord not of fleeing the
[51:57] country in a couple hours and then the
[51:59] everything's crowded full of fleas not a
[52:01] fly no word
[52:03] and he said let there be fly and the
[52:06] first thing you know a big old flow fire
[52:07] began to fly around
[52:09] and there was glory to people everywhere
[52:11] who
[52:12] what man could do that it was god
[52:16] using that
[52:22] [Music]
[52:26] watch real close now he is
[52:30] going to speak so he has to track the
[52:32] attention
[52:33] by a sign and the sign
[52:36] voice is what he's going to say his word
[52:39] is
[52:39] promised words going to be vindicated
[52:41] now see
[52:42] i made a promise that i would take him
[52:44] out by a strong hand
[52:46] i'd show my power in that land whatever
[52:49] he's going to do
[52:50] i made the promise to abraham here he is
[52:52] ready to do it so he gives a sign
[52:54] a pillar of fire laying back in a
[52:56] burning bush
[52:58] and he tells moses now you're going to
[53:00] be my mouthpiece go on down there and
[53:02] i'll be with you
[53:04] and when he got in there then the
[53:06] promise
[53:07] word that he had promised was vindicated
[53:10] that was the voice
[53:12] of the sign get it down
[53:15] notice i have heard their groans i
[53:18] remember my promise
[53:20] god never changes he always does it in
[53:23] the same way
[53:26] the coming of a prophet is the sign
[53:29] that god is ready to speak
[53:33] did you not search the scriptures see
[53:36] the bible says god put himself he did
[53:39] nothing until he revealed it to his
[53:41] prophet
[53:42] that's right he does it to them because
[53:45] it comes to him as his servants
[53:47] all right the coming of a prophet
[53:50] is the sign that's overlooked by the
[53:53] people
[53:54] every time they overlook it
[53:57] they never get it somehow let the social
[54:00] worker
[54:00] got their eyes open to see it those who
[54:03] are elected to see it
[54:04] does it but the coming of a prophet was
[54:07] the sign that
[54:08] god is ready to speak because of god's
[54:10] eagle to speak the prophet wouldn't be
[54:12] on earth
[54:14] i remember that he wouldn't be on earth
[54:17] unless god was ready to speak and that's
[54:19] the way he speaks to
[54:20] those channels yes the unchanging god
[54:24] never did do it any other way notice
[54:28] this is always god's way of making his
[54:31] voice known to his people
[54:34] he sends his prophet and gives a sign
[54:38] and then takes his voice that's been
[54:41] spoken before on his word and
[54:43] vindicates it by this man and they
[54:46] know that it's his voice because it's
[54:48] the promised word of the day
[54:51] oh if people could fully see it if they
[54:54] could only stop
[54:55] just the moment and realize that you see
[54:58] there's no way to make them believe it
[55:00] there's there's not a way a man god
[55:02] himself can do it
[55:04] make the people believe it they've got
[55:06] to believe it and if there's nothing
[55:07] there to believe with how can they
[55:09] believe
[55:11] no matter what you do the bible says
[55:14] though he had done so many miracles yet
[55:15] they could not believe because
[55:17] isaiah foresaw it said they got ears and
[55:19] they can't hear
[55:20] eyes and can't see and yet he was
[55:23] perfectly the messiah
[55:25] done exactly what the messiah said and
[55:27] they said this man just breaks up
[55:28] churches and he
[55:29] we don't know points he comes isn't that
[55:31] strange that they would do that
[55:33] but the bible said they would do it and
[55:35] the bible also said in this day they'd
[55:38] do the same thing
[55:40] any high-minded lovers of pleasure more
[55:42] than of god
[55:43] false accusers incontinent despisers of
[55:46] those that are good
[55:47] heaven a form of godliness but would
[55:50] deny
[55:51] the vindicated world the power there the
[55:53] baptism the holy ghost is
[55:55] from such turn away for this is the kind
[55:59] that organizes women's societies it goes
[56:01] house to house and leads to the women
[56:03] laid away
[56:04] with diverse lust never able to come to
[56:06] the knowledge of the truth
[56:08] see now that's prophesying
[56:12] and that's got to come to pass because
[56:14] it's thus
[56:15] far so long notice
[56:18] but their folly would be showed up like
[56:21] jabberson james in the last days
[56:23] now always making on his voice
[56:26] to his people by his prophet
[56:30] simon i'm talking about moses that's
[56:32] where i'm banking back
[56:34] and then see where we're at god's
[56:37] word is manifested by the voice
[56:41] of the sun now the sign that is
[56:44] promised for the day is done before the
[56:47] people and then the written scripture
[56:49] comes forth is the voice of that sign if
[56:52] it doesn't give a scriptural voice
[56:54] then stay away from it it's not
[56:58] god because god can't promise this for a
[57:00] day and say oh this is it
[57:02] see god cannot do that god cannot
[57:04] promise something for one day
[57:06] and say no no it it i won't do that that
[57:08] was for another day
[57:10] what he promises he must stay with us
[57:12] and the real scriptural
[57:15] sign is the scriptural voice
[57:18] moses sign that he saw was god in cosmic
[57:22] life
[57:23] and then when he did that and did
[57:25] anybody know the old
[57:27] hebrew a sign even before there was a
[57:30] bible written
[57:31] was a triangle shape or oval shape
[57:34] of a cosmic light exactly right the low
[57:38] gospel
[57:39] now dr lomsey has that in his bible on
[57:43] the cover on the outside
[57:45] now we notice that moses
[57:49] was attracted by this sign and this sign
[57:53] spoke to moses with the scriptural voice
[57:57] see the sign attracted him and then he
[58:00] said
[58:00] i remember my promise
[58:04] and i've come down to deliver them and
[58:07] i'm going to use you
[58:08] for a mouthpiece you go on down there
[58:11] moses made his excuses but god sent him
[58:13] anyhow
[58:14] now he's that's his way of interpreting
[58:17] his word
[58:18] a prophet in the scripture
[58:21] must first be a a seer
[58:25] that's a vindicator it must not be just
[58:28] any fellow come along and say i got the
[58:30] says the lord next and say i see thus
[58:32] death the lord
[58:34] prophets are not hands laid on them and
[58:37] made prophets
[58:39] prophets are predestinated for the hour
[58:43] the bible tells when they'll come what
[58:46] they'll be
[58:48] prophets are are sent from god
[58:52] they're offices of god that's been
[58:55] born god told jeremiah before he was
[58:58] even conceived in your mother's womb
[59:00] i'll ordain you a prophet
[59:05] they're just that must be perfectly in
[59:08] the man it's a
[59:09] it's not him it's a gift from him moses
[59:12] was
[59:13] born a prophet jeremiah was born a
[59:16] prophet isaiah a prophet john the
[59:19] baptist
[59:20] a prophet god has spoken them
[59:23] and what they say must be true
[59:27] and the way that the people is to know
[59:29] whether they are
[59:30] true or not what he says must be
[59:34] correct because what he's prophesying
[59:36] about
[59:37] is his credentials of his call from god
[59:41] when god vindicates what he says to be
[59:42] the truth
[59:44] now that's why i'm trying to say these
[59:46] things tonight
[59:47] so that you'll understand now if the
[59:51] bible said over here
[59:52] if there'll be one among you who's
[59:54] spiritual or a prophet
[59:55] i the lord will make myself known unto
[59:58] him in visions speak to him through
[1:00:00] dreams
[1:00:01] then he says if this prophet says
[1:00:03] anything
[1:00:04] and it doesn't happen then don't you
[1:00:06] believe it
[1:00:08] that's no more than good sense but if
[1:00:10] what he says
[1:00:11] comes to pass then here then you must
[1:00:13] fear him because
[1:00:15] he's with him now we find out what moses
[1:00:18] said
[1:00:19] come to pass see that
[1:00:22] made him a vindicated seer that was his
[1:00:26] credentials
[1:00:27] because what he said happened he said
[1:00:29] that about this time tomorrow there'll
[1:00:31] be fleas all over the ground and there
[1:00:33] was
[1:00:35] this time tomorrow there will be so and
[1:00:37] so and there was
[1:00:39] it was hit as actually on the dots
[1:00:43] not just the haphazard so many man today
[1:00:47] if you excuse this just for a minute
[1:00:49] not no judge or just passing a personal
[1:00:51] opinion
[1:00:52] many man has raised up good
[1:00:54] spirit-filled man and they
[1:00:56] try they go out maybe the lord give him
[1:00:58] a gift of prophecy now there's a million
[1:01:00] miles difference between a gift of
[1:01:01] prophecy and a prophet
[1:01:04] a gift of prophecy must be judged by
[1:01:06] three before it could even be passed
[1:01:07] into the church we know as
[1:01:08] same as speaking in tongues it must go
[1:01:10] before three judges before it can even
[1:01:12] be given to the church
[1:01:13] now we find out now if these men go out
[1:01:17] sometime
[1:01:18] and then people begin to press upon them
[1:01:21] oh brother what will you say
[1:01:22] see he goes by impression way he feels
[1:01:26] of the lord will do that
[1:01:27] thus saith the lord that's a lie see
[1:01:30] you when you can't say thus saith the
[1:01:32] lord until god in his own language has
[1:01:35] spoken to you and told you that then
[1:01:37] it's not you saying
[1:01:38] not your impression the bible said it a
[1:01:41] prophet did that was going out
[1:01:43] presumptuously that is pursuing
[1:01:45] and pursue is to adventure without
[1:01:47] authority
[1:01:49] he's going upon his own but when
[1:01:52] you see the man speaking what's going to
[1:01:55] happen in the name of the lord it
[1:01:57] happens day in and out week in and out
[1:01:59] month in and out
[1:02:00] year in and out then you know that come
[1:02:03] from god
[1:02:05] that's god's credentials to the man that
[1:02:08] he
[1:02:08] is the interpreter of the written word
[1:02:11] for that day because
[1:02:13] god sends the man to knowledge
[1:02:15] [Applause]
[1:02:18] if the church has only had some good
[1:02:20] sound teaching on these things see
[1:02:22] they'd understand oh i think we get one
[1:02:23] little track and we run right wow with
[1:02:25] it let's
[1:02:26] just take on that one thing and just
[1:02:27] make a hobby out of it that's whatever
[1:02:30] every denomination originated from if
[1:02:33] martin luther would have went on into
[1:02:34] sanctification
[1:02:35] okay if the western methodist would have
[1:02:37] went on into the baptism the holy ghost
[1:02:39] the registration against it all been one
[1:02:41] big church of the lord all the time
[1:02:43] but they get that one little thing and
[1:02:44] prove it's right and there they are
[1:02:46] but they had to do it the bible said
[1:02:48] that's the way they would do it
[1:02:50] it has to be this way today i
[1:02:53] hope that my class unders do you
[1:02:55] understand what i mean raise your hand
[1:02:57] so
[1:02:58] and understand you must understand
[1:03:00] friend this is your life
[1:03:03] see this is your life yes his
[1:03:06] credentials
[1:03:07] is that god has a vindicated
[1:03:11] this person to be a seer now the
[1:03:14] english word of prophet just means a
[1:03:16] preacher the
[1:03:17] anybody ever preacher is a prophet
[1:03:19] because he's foretelling something
[1:03:21] uh preaching the word under inspiration
[1:03:23] it's called a prophet
[1:03:24] but in the old testament they were more
[1:03:27] than that they were
[1:03:28] seers they were a man who
[1:03:31] told things that was coming to pass
[1:03:34] and it happened that gave him the right
[1:03:36] to be the
[1:03:37] the interpreter of the word for that day
[1:03:41] because god
[1:03:42] took the word of that day and
[1:03:44] interpreted himself through that man
[1:03:47] and that's what he come on the earth for
[1:03:49] he's always a sign
[1:03:51] when a prophet comes to the earth just
[1:03:54] watch as we go through it and see if it
[1:03:55] isn't so
[1:03:56] he always sends his prophet when you see
[1:03:58] a prophet rise on the scene
[1:04:00] look out we're looking for one to come
[1:04:02] now you know i mean when you see it you
[1:04:04] just remember
[1:04:05] it's something fixed to happen this is
[1:04:08] his credentials
[1:04:09] then god interprets his word by him and
[1:04:12] through him
[1:04:13] numbers 12 6 tells that and remember the
[1:04:16] entire
[1:04:17] bible was wrote by the prophets
[1:04:21] why the word of the lord came to a
[1:04:23] matter that he was vindicated
[1:04:25] prophets like jason and through them
[1:04:26] that was thrown out and many prophets
[1:04:28] that never went on
[1:04:29] but god has a way of stirring his word
[1:04:33] when it's true god's got to judge the
[1:04:36] world by something
[1:04:37] the catholic people here they say he's
[1:04:39] going to judge him
[1:04:41] judge the world by the church if that's
[1:04:43] right then what church
[1:04:45] if you say the catholic church which the
[1:04:47] roman greek or what
[1:04:49] see they're all broken pieces he's going
[1:04:52] to judge about the baptist church now
[1:04:54] what about the methodist church
[1:04:56] see he can't do there's too much
[1:04:58] confusion people wouldn't know where
[1:04:59] they're at
[1:05:00] but he said in the bible if you don't
[1:05:02] know what he's going to judge the
[1:05:04] people by he's going to judge the world
[1:05:06] by jesus christ
[1:05:08] and he is the word the bible man is what
[1:05:12] he'll judge by a vindicated word
[1:05:16] that's god's way of judging is the bible
[1:05:19] so no matter what any creed or
[1:05:20] denomination says you say write that
[1:05:22] bible because
[1:05:23] it is christ think john the first
[1:05:26] chapter tells us that
[1:05:27] notice now the bible was written
[1:05:30] by the prophet we see that it says that
[1:05:33] the
[1:05:33] man of old and moved by the holy ghost
[1:05:35] wrote the bible and
[1:05:37] hebrews 1 it says god in sunderland
[1:05:39] times and diverse manners spake to the
[1:05:41] fathers by the prophets
[1:05:42] in this last day through his son jesus
[1:05:45] christ
[1:05:47] see because he was the manifestation of
[1:05:49] all the word or the prophet
[1:05:51] and he was the fullness of the word
[1:05:54] the word was in him all the words he was
[1:05:58] emmanuel god manifested in flesh god's
[1:06:02] come down in the form of the holy spirit
[1:06:05] two wings like a dove
[1:06:06] settling down and one upon him saying
[1:06:08] this is my beloved son
[1:06:10] in whom i'm pleased to dwell in now the
[1:06:13] king james there says in whom i'm
[1:06:15] pleased as well what difference does it
[1:06:16] make
[1:06:17] in whom i'm peaceful dweller who i'm
[1:06:18] pleased to dwell in the in whom i'm
[1:06:20] pleased to dwell
[1:06:22] there it was god in man heaven and earth
[1:06:26] come together god in man united the
[1:06:29] greatest hour
[1:06:30] to that time there was on the earth
[1:06:31] there had been notice
[1:06:33] the pillar of fire signed
[1:06:37] and then the voice of the sign spoke
[1:06:40] thee
[1:06:41] the pure sign of the boys was there
[1:06:45] ready to speak the sign only showed
[1:06:49] that the voice was ready to speak
[1:06:53] get the id the sign
[1:06:56] shows god's voice is ready to speak
[1:07:00] and when god shows a sign as he's in the
[1:07:03] last days
[1:07:03] you don't you look around look at look
[1:07:05] at the immoral of the people
[1:07:07] that's god's sign when you see people
[1:07:09] getting like this look what they're
[1:07:11] going to he said they get worse and
[1:07:13] worse they were donuts
[1:07:14] see that immoral sign all right there's
[1:07:17] all kinds of signs in the heavens above
[1:07:19] fearful sights
[1:07:20] flying saucers the pentagon looks at
[1:07:23] them normal what they are
[1:07:26] all kinds of signs theorem ways
[1:07:29] perplexed the time distress between the
[1:07:30] nations
[1:07:31] all these things earthquakes and diverse
[1:07:33] places
[1:07:34] man running to and fro knowledge
[1:07:36] increasing all these other things that
[1:07:38] he said
[1:07:38] great turmoil how the christ would be
[1:07:40] put out of his church in the last days
[1:07:42] in the lady of the age regardless
[1:07:45] all these things are god's speaking
[1:07:48] signs
[1:07:49] and then once they made us known god
[1:07:52] sent someone
[1:07:53] on the scene something on the scene to
[1:07:56] vindicate that and to take the scripture
[1:07:58] that spoke up for the day and to
[1:08:00] manifest it
[1:08:02] and that's the credentials of it let's
[1:08:04] see this the sign
[1:08:05] the pillar of fire as soon as the
[1:08:08] sign come up there it was that was the
[1:08:11] sign that the voice was
[1:08:12] ready to speak and we see the signs
[1:08:16] of the end amen that right
[1:08:20] the sign of the end how many blings i
[1:08:23] say amen
[1:08:25] and the voice is ready to speak
[1:08:27] [Applause]
[1:08:29] the voice is ready to speak because we
[1:08:31] see the sign
[1:08:33] the pillar fire was there to say that
[1:08:36] the voice
[1:08:47] do you enjoy that aren't you glad you
[1:08:51] can go finish listening to it
[1:08:53] and listening to it again i hope it
[1:08:56] stirs you enough to do that
[1:08:59] amen someone says why do you just play a
[1:09:02] little bit of it
[1:09:03] well because we can't even get the
[1:09:06] little bit we play
[1:09:08] you know what i mean but
[1:09:11] excuse me
[1:09:18] but i i wanted to say this just to
[1:09:21] you know especially our young people
[1:09:24] and people that have
[1:09:28] been raised in the message and and uh
[1:09:33] people that have uh come along
[1:09:36] and uh by friendship and things
[1:09:39] just to go back a little bit and just to
[1:09:42] understand
[1:09:44] what it is that we're built on
[1:09:48] and what what we mean when we
[1:09:52] say uh our your calling is in
[1:09:56] the sign and i'd like to just find that
[1:09:58] little uh
[1:09:59] statement that he read
[1:10:03] he said he said here he says
[1:10:07] it was god using that prophet making
[1:10:10] his word a sign to give
[1:10:14] a call to give a call making this word
[1:10:18] so our call
[1:10:20] is in the sign so when you understand
[1:10:24] that
[1:10:24] a man showed up on the scene
[1:10:28] and uh uh
[1:10:31] he was born and we could go over his
[1:10:33] life story and he had the
[1:10:35] a pillar of fire came by his life when
[1:10:38] he was born
[1:10:39] it showed up it's they said a strange
[1:10:41] light came into the room
[1:10:44] anybody could believe a story like that
[1:10:46] or
[1:10:47] say a story like that my family could
[1:10:50] say that a light
[1:10:51] showed up in the room that was a sign
[1:10:56] all of a sudden he said that one day he
[1:10:58] was
[1:10:59] packing water and there was a whirlwind
[1:11:02] in a bush and uh that
[1:11:05] whirlwind told him not to defile his
[1:11:08] body in any way that god had to work for
[1:11:11] him
[1:11:12] but i i've had whirlwinds
[1:11:15] come all around me before i've been
[1:11:17] caught up in a whirlwind
[1:11:19] in montana the winds we'd have those
[1:11:21] things that just
[1:11:22] we call them twisters or whatever you
[1:11:25] had that
[1:11:26] anybody could have that
[1:11:31] but there was a sign of the son of man
[1:11:37] there was a sign that was that
[1:11:40] god was going to perform to
[1:11:45] just equivocally prove
[1:11:49] that this voice
[1:11:52] this prophet had a voice
[1:11:56] to follow and
[1:11:59] so he said the first sign
[1:12:02] would be the taking of the hand
[1:12:06] and the prophet of god would take his
[1:12:08] hand
[1:12:09] and he would take the person's hand and
[1:12:12] then by the vibrations that would go
[1:12:16] up and down that hand
[1:12:20] he would he would be able to know what
[1:12:22] the sickness was
[1:12:24] of the person and so he that was a sign
[1:12:29] and that sign he took that person by the
[1:12:31] hand and
[1:12:33] and he would he would
[1:12:36] take it and he would tell him what was
[1:12:38] wrong and at
[1:12:40] whether they had and many times on the
[1:12:42] early tapes
[1:12:43] you'll hear him say he'll take someone
[1:12:46] by the hand
[1:12:47] and you'll say watch that you see that
[1:12:49] you see those little bumps going up and
[1:12:51] down
[1:12:52] to my hand here he says now wait he says
[1:12:55] if they go away you're well
[1:12:57] amen and
[1:13:00] you know i for some reason in my heart i
[1:13:03] just believed that brother branham had
[1:13:05] the faith
[1:13:06] that they were going to go away that's
[1:13:08] why he draw the
[1:13:10] people's attention to it again sure
[1:13:12] enough
[1:13:13] then they would go away if they wouldn't
[1:13:15] go away he'd pray for him and
[1:13:17] just say you know go but if that sign
[1:13:21] then was a psych and the voice that
[1:13:24] followed that sign
[1:13:25] would be thus saith the lord your well
[1:13:29] that was the first sign and
[1:13:33] the voice of the first sign spoke
[1:13:36] of the voice of the second sign
[1:13:39] so he said after that he said now not
[1:13:42] only that but now they'll even know
[1:13:44] the secrets of their heart
[1:13:48] now remember the importance of this
[1:13:51] because
[1:13:53] if if you don't understand
[1:13:57] the the sign and that's why we
[1:14:00] we listened to what he said he said god
[1:14:03] sends the sign
[1:14:07] and the sign is a sign
[1:14:14] it's an alert
[1:14:17] i hope there's a bride alert pretty
[1:14:19] quick i hope
[1:14:20] all these phones go off everywhere all
[1:14:23] over the place bee
[1:14:25] bee bee silver alert
[1:14:28] some silver guy's missing hallelujah
[1:14:33] okay i mean just everywhere going off
[1:14:36] because the bride's leaving out of here
[1:14:39] and one after the other you know what i
[1:14:41] mean
[1:14:42] but just to just follow the sign
[1:14:45] understand the sign that god gave the
[1:14:48] sign
[1:14:48] because the call was going to follow the
[1:14:52] sign
[1:14:55] the voice was kind of the voice of god
[1:14:58] god was attracting the attention of the
[1:15:01] people
[1:15:02] because he was going to have a call
[1:15:05] so the call was in the sign if you
[1:15:10] didn't see the sign
[1:15:12] you would have never heard the call
[1:15:16] if you weren't attracted by the sign you
[1:15:19] would never
[1:15:19] hear the call and so the call
[1:15:23] was in the sign that keno enzo he proved
[1:15:28] beyond the shadow of the doubt that they
[1:15:31] said well it's telepathy
[1:15:36] so he said and he would talk about the
[1:15:40] woman at the well and and
[1:15:43] uh people would say well that was
[1:15:46] telepathy
[1:15:47] or or or some form of discernment
[1:15:51] or or something like that that was just
[1:15:53] a way to uh
[1:15:55] he just looked at her and saw her
[1:15:57] condition and
[1:15:58] and saw what time she was coming out to
[1:16:01] the well
[1:16:02] so he knew that there was something
[1:16:04] wrong with her
[1:16:05] and and uh you know he just and he he
[1:16:08] kind of
[1:16:09] guest around you know that's what a lot
[1:16:13] of people do
[1:16:15] they don't they just kind of guess and
[1:16:17] they
[1:16:18] hit it every now and then and
[1:16:21] if you know god doesn't hit it every now
[1:16:24] and then
[1:16:24] he's a hundred percent every
[1:16:28] single time you don't ever have to worry
[1:16:31] you know god doesn't do anything
[1:16:34] haphazardly
[1:16:35] amen that's why the bride has got to
[1:16:37] have thus saith the lord
[1:16:39] or if she sits still and if you say it's
[1:16:42] thus saith the lord
[1:16:44] and god didn't tell you it's not your
[1:16:47] impression
[1:16:48] it's not how you feel it's not some sort
[1:16:51] of
[1:16:51] unction you have he says that's a lie
[1:16:57] and it's okay to have an impression
[1:17:00] it's okay to have a feeling it's okay to
[1:17:03] have a leading
[1:17:05] it's okay because then you proceed that
[1:17:07] way
[1:17:08] you lean that way and and if the door
[1:17:11] opens it's fine
[1:17:13] you know what i mean if god don't speak
[1:17:15] to you
[1:17:16] and say you know i wouldn't go that way
[1:17:18] i i would pray about that
[1:17:20] i would do this you know then that you
[1:17:23] know then he checks that
[1:17:25] but when you have thus saith the lord
[1:17:27] there ain't no checking
[1:17:31] that settled but it ain't thus saith the
[1:17:34] lord until it
[1:17:35] is the saith the lord so you can have
[1:17:38] impressions you can lean this way you
[1:17:40] can lean that way
[1:17:41] you can have functions that's fine but
[1:17:43] don't say it's
[1:17:44] the lord
[1:17:48] i like it when a man says i feel led
[1:17:52] that's exactly what he's saying he's not
[1:17:54] saying the lord led me
[1:17:56] he says my feelings are leading me
[1:18:00] i feel led
[1:18:03] i feel led to go fishing
[1:18:07] i feel led to sleep in
[1:18:11] that's all right that's right you
[1:18:13] understand but you got to draw the
[1:18:15] distinct
[1:18:16] the distinct division and division
[1:18:19] between what's god
[1:18:20] and what's not god that's why god
[1:18:24] sent the sign so we could have a
[1:18:26] distinct
[1:18:27] line between what was god and what
[1:18:30] wasn't god
[1:18:34] you know what i mean that it wasn't just
[1:18:36] a
[1:18:37] another pathway it wasn't just another
[1:18:40] thing but it was a clear
[1:18:41] sign from god that there was a message
[1:18:45] or a call to follow
[1:18:49] and so finally so that it wouldn't be
[1:18:51] any confusion
[1:18:53] he turned to the one well but he took it
[1:18:55] all the way back to
[1:18:57] elohim
[1:19:00] when god the morphe
[1:19:03] took on the form
[1:19:08] of a man he said he gathered up a cosmic
[1:19:13] god had that form of that man in his
[1:19:16] mind
[1:19:18] what a theophany is it's a thought word
[1:19:21] of god
[1:19:22] that hasn't taken form in flesh yet
[1:19:27] and then so he came and god took on this
[1:19:30] form
[1:19:30] of a man we it wasn't jesus
[1:19:34] it was god taking on a form
[1:19:38] to talk to abraham and
[1:19:42] to give a sign
[1:19:45] that was a sign to abraham and he gave a
[1:19:48] sign to abraham
[1:19:50] because there was a voice or a
[1:19:54] call to follow and he said i'm going to
[1:19:58] visit you
[1:20:00] and you and sarah are going to have a
[1:20:03] son
[1:20:06] huh well sarah laughed
[1:20:11] but with his back to the tent
[1:20:17] okay no no discerning
[1:20:20] the look on abraham's face like abraham
[1:20:23] you know a lot of people discern
[1:20:25] your reaction it's called profiling
[1:20:31] you know you say something to somebody
[1:20:32] and all of a sudden they cast their eyes
[1:20:34] away or
[1:20:35] or they look down real quick or they
[1:20:37] flinch you know you hit a nerve
[1:20:40] and if you're trained in those things
[1:20:42] you just keep hitting that nerve hitting
[1:20:44] that nerve
[1:20:45] and then pretty soon that person i'm
[1:20:47] teaching you all how to lie
[1:20:49] and then pretty soon that person they
[1:20:51] start defending themselves
[1:20:55] you know or they start telling the story
[1:20:57] or they try to present the story in a
[1:20:59] certain light
[1:21:00] and the facts don't line up and the
[1:21:02] facts don't line up
[1:21:04] you know why are you saying that it
[1:21:06] doesn't match you just told me this
[1:21:08] you see you don't line up but so people
[1:21:12] have all kinds of ways of discerning
[1:21:14] all kinds of ways of presenting things
[1:21:16] let me say it this way
[1:21:17] all kinds of ways of deceiving
[1:21:21] but god left a sign
[1:21:24] so you could know that the voice that
[1:21:27] followed that sign
[1:21:29] had no deception in it
[1:21:32] whatsoever
[1:21:35] don't blame yourself if
[1:21:39] you if you find yourself
[1:21:43] have been deceived because satan appears
[1:21:46] as an angel of light
[1:21:50] but if you can recognize
[1:21:54] and see the
[1:21:57] vindicated sign of god
[1:22:00] then you know that every other
[1:22:04] voice has been ruled out
[1:22:10] and your call yes sir is
[1:22:13] in that sign
[1:22:17] that sign is what's calling you
[1:22:21] and reaching out to you because
[1:22:24] it attracted your attention
[1:22:31] i remember when i first heard the
[1:22:33] discernments
[1:22:34] elk and those people would come up
[1:22:37] before brother branham
[1:22:38] any and he would talk about their
[1:22:40] diseases and he would
[1:22:42] tell him this and i see a doctor
[1:22:44] examining you
[1:22:45] i see a big man i see you sitting on the
[1:22:48] side of the bed
[1:22:49] i see you this you know
[1:22:52] i see you back here i love the stories
[1:22:55] he told
[1:22:56] about the the the little dog the
[1:22:59] girl he discerned there he says oh your
[1:23:01] problem was yeah
[1:23:03] a dog that scared you we see it on tape
[1:23:07] the woman comes up and he says oh
[1:23:09] oh it's a lie they told the lie there's
[1:23:13] a lie in your church
[1:23:15] your the preacher said you was a witch
[1:23:27] and i i would just sit back and and i
[1:23:30] it was the sign
[1:23:34] the sign set apart the voice
[1:23:39] you understand the sign set apart that
[1:23:42] the sign
[1:23:43] is what kept it from being intellectual
[1:23:50] that that's the trouble if you take this
[1:23:53] message
[1:23:53] and you separate the prophet from the
[1:23:56] message
[1:23:57] you separate the sign from the message
[1:23:59] you separate the call from the sign
[1:24:03] you end up with intellect
[1:24:06] that's right
[1:24:09] exactly what you end up with
[1:24:13] and i was so attracted to that
[1:24:17] i was so attracted it attracted my
[1:24:20] attention
[1:24:21] but why was my attention attracted
[1:24:26] because my call my calling
[1:24:30] was in the sign
[1:24:34] my calling was there so to leave no
[1:24:37] doubt about it
[1:24:38] he didn't take it to the woman at the
[1:24:40] well he finally took it all the way back
[1:24:42] to elohim
[1:24:44] god veiled in flesh
[1:24:49] the ministry of god
[1:24:52] veiled in flesh amen that was that the
[1:24:55] woman at the well it was god
[1:24:57] veiled in flesh discerning her thoughts
[1:25:00] and intents of her heart
[1:25:02] so he took it back to elohim and what
[1:25:04] did he do
[1:25:05] keep there be an audience of people
[1:25:07] maybe
[1:25:08] a thousand times bigger in this group
[1:25:11] here
[1:25:15] and he'd turn his back to the audience
[1:25:18] like this
[1:25:22] there's nothing and he'd look right out
[1:25:25] here
[1:25:26] where the vision would appear with the
[1:25:29] angel lord standing there and he said i
[1:25:32] see not i see
[1:25:37] anybody can say that i see a young man
[1:25:40] with a notebook in cowboy boots and a
[1:25:43] blue striped shirt on i hope that's blue
[1:25:48] why and now if you didn't see what i saw
[1:25:52] then you'd have to take my word for it
[1:25:56] this sign you understand was going to be
[1:26:01] so
[1:26:01] vindicated by god
[1:26:04] that there would be no question
[1:26:08] of your call
[1:26:11] no question of the voice
[1:26:15] a voice is a call you know what i mean
[1:26:18] if i called your name
[1:26:20] my voice is what calls your name if i
[1:26:23] called
[1:26:23] if i called out to the back i said
[1:26:26] brother adrian that
[1:26:28] that that was my voice calling
[1:26:32] so this sign was given so it turned his
[1:26:35] back
[1:26:36] and then we began to tell people
[1:26:39] oh i see a man that that
[1:26:42] the doctors say he's got cancer
[1:26:47] lung cancer he's a coal miner
[1:26:51] the things that that that he did
[1:26:54] to to settle
[1:26:58] in the heart of the here
[1:27:02] from where they're calling
[1:27:06] cain
[1:27:10] it came from the sign that was
[1:27:13] the voice of the sign
[1:27:17] the call i love how he says it and i'll
[1:27:20] just say it again
[1:27:21] he said because it's it it's
[1:27:24] beautiful he said he spoke and both blow
[1:27:27] fives were
[1:27:28] everywhere he says
[1:27:32] who what man could do that
[1:27:35] it was god using that prophet
[1:27:40] making his word a sign
[1:27:44] to give a call
[1:27:49] we're going out of
[1:27:52] egypt you understand what was the sign
[1:27:56] the sign was a call to let
[1:28:00] us know we are going out
[1:28:03] of this world
[1:28:08] always the sign before the exodus
[1:28:11] so you could hear the call
[1:28:15] the call was in the sign it's not built
[1:28:18] on your intellect
[1:28:19] god didn't do this so you could sit back
[1:28:23] and build it on your ability to
[1:28:25] interpret scripture
[1:28:29] or your ability to understand something
[1:28:32] he put it in the calling in the sign
[1:28:35] so all of us had to see and recognize
[1:28:39] the same sign
[1:28:40] and hear the call
[1:28:46] if they if your call's not in the sign
[1:28:49] then your message isn't according to the
[1:28:52] sign
[1:28:53] then it's not pleading you in the right
[1:28:56] place
[1:29:00] that's why we've got too many staying
[1:29:02] gospels instead of leaving gospel
[1:29:06] too many songs that are sung so that
[1:29:10] it's in the tune of the day and the beat
[1:29:12] of the day
[1:29:13] and the entertainment of the day you
[1:29:16] know you let
[1:29:17] folk music be the thing that everybody's
[1:29:19] singing folk song
[1:29:20] you let some other music gendra come and
[1:29:23] all of a sudden
[1:29:24] songs are upcoming and gendrous which
[1:29:27] are
[1:29:27] just to touch our appetite of our flesh
[1:29:30] while we're here and it's nothing about
[1:29:33] leaving
[1:29:33] it's just making this stay here more
[1:29:37] delightful
[1:29:38] well i think the eagle needs to blow all
[1:29:41] the feathers out of our nest
[1:29:42] so we can't stand to stay down here
[1:29:45] anymore
[1:29:50] no comfort in nothing
[1:29:55] you hear the call the end time
[1:29:59] i'm going home the things that are
[1:30:01] spoken are coming to pass
[1:30:03] so you see when once you have the sign
[1:30:06] once you understand this message was
[1:30:09] built
[1:30:10] not on just divine healing
[1:30:16] many people pray for the sick that was
[1:30:19] lying in the scriptures
[1:30:21] forever men were on the scene
[1:30:24] before the prophet of god was on the
[1:30:27] scene praying for the sick
[1:30:30] that is the inheritance praying for the
[1:30:33] sick is the proof of the resurrection
[1:30:36] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:30:39] today and forever
[1:30:40] turning your back to the audience and
[1:30:43] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:30:45] the people's minds
[1:30:46] when there was no visual contact at all
[1:30:49] but by divine vision that was a sign
[1:30:52] from god that showed there was a message
[1:30:55] that
[1:30:56] followed
[1:31:00] and that's where you get your call what
[1:31:03] do i mean by your call
[1:31:07] the way you live
[1:31:15] what word truth that you believe
[1:31:22] how to discern the hour and recognize
[1:31:25] the day
[1:31:27] and its message
[1:31:31] if that sign isn't
[1:31:34] anchored in your heart you have no
[1:31:36] anchor
[1:31:39] yes sir you're saying it don't matter
[1:31:42] when it's questioned
[1:31:44] they can intellectually question they
[1:31:46] can throw their bible at you
[1:31:48] they can give you scripture and
[1:31:49] everything but when you come down to the
[1:31:52] sign
[1:31:55] when you come down to what vindicates
[1:31:57] your word
[1:31:58] versus this word they can say i pray
[1:32:02] this
[1:32:02] but they can't turn their back to the
[1:32:04] audience they can't know the secrets of
[1:32:06] the heart
[1:32:07] they can't see something out there
[1:32:09] before it happens
[1:32:10] he walked into that whole room of
[1:32:12] ministers and said you all set a trap
[1:32:20] that man got up there and said you may
[1:32:22] not believe well brother branham's
[1:32:24] doctrine
[1:32:26] but he told me we wouldn't have this
[1:32:28] room
[1:32:30] that's right he told me where every one
[1:32:33] of you would be sitting
[1:32:40] now who is ready to take their bible
[1:32:44] then
[1:32:48] oh they wait for 50 years
[1:32:56] you know what i mean he tells the story
[1:32:59] of the bridge he tells all these stories
[1:33:01] all over the world all this time
[1:33:03] and then all of a sudden some modern
[1:33:07] telephone
[1:33:10] and you know billy told me anyway he
[1:33:12] said the most unstable thing
[1:33:14] is the internet i said so that's why
[1:33:18] it's making so many unstable people
[1:33:24] can you imagine dating over social media
[1:33:30] you know what you're going to end up
[1:33:31] marrying a virus
[1:33:40] that's exactly the truth
[1:33:44] a lie a lie
[1:33:48] well what when's it gonna take for us to
[1:33:51] get back
[1:33:52] and make contact with a living god
[1:33:55] [Applause]
[1:33:58] that's what the sign was for
[1:34:02] the sign was so you could see god
[1:34:05] manifested in flesh and hear the call
[1:34:08] that this is the truth
[1:34:13] i can follow this i can live by this
[1:34:17] i can believe in this i can trust this
[1:34:20] because it's got a vindicated sign
[1:34:24] and my call is in the sign
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:31] exactly what we're resting in
[1:34:34] we're not resting in the putting
[1:34:37] together
[1:34:38] of scriptures
[1:34:43] we're not oral robert
[1:34:46] had bulldog faith he just
[1:34:50] build faith and give testimonies and
[1:34:52] grab people and
[1:34:53] shake him come out of him devil believe
[1:34:57] god go on believe god boom boom
[1:35:00] and they had to believe god after such a
[1:35:03] demonstration of faith like that i'm not
[1:35:05] condemning it
[1:35:10] you heard my message the other side of
[1:35:12] the message
[1:35:13] why so many people responded to billy
[1:35:15] graham and
[1:35:16] you don't hear what they hear
[1:35:20] but you know what the prophet of god
[1:35:21] said
[1:35:23] he took a lot of things off people that
[1:35:25] god put
[1:35:27] on for a purpose
[1:35:32] blinding
[1:35:35] blind two angels went out
[1:35:38] to blind the world all
[1:35:42] your religious denominations
[1:35:46] philosophies approaches
[1:35:50] worships and everything are
[1:35:53] under the deceit of those two messengers
[1:36:02] the truth but you've got something to
[1:36:06] anchor in
[1:36:10] the prophet being on the scene was a
[1:36:13] sign
[1:36:13] that god was fixed in the sea it was a
[1:36:16] sign there was fixing to be an exodus
[1:36:18] it was a sign and that sign was so
[1:36:21] vindicated proven it the scripture by
[1:36:24] the woman at the well
[1:36:25] proven by the abraham and the promised
[1:36:28] son
[1:36:29] and we could go into that for hours
[1:36:32] but when i talk to then you you
[1:36:35] recognize that
[1:36:37] in other words no other ministry
[1:36:40] had that sign
[1:36:44] now they try to duplicate it today
[1:36:50] you've got to have a spiritual seed to
[1:36:53] be able to discern a counterfeit
[1:36:57] i have with one of the brothers i don't
[1:37:00] know
[1:37:01] who it was i forget the the situation
[1:37:04] but they
[1:37:05] they went to some place and bought two
[1:37:07] counterfeit signs
[1:37:10] porcelain signs both of them were fake
[1:37:16] someone lied it wasn't real
[1:37:21] how do you know what's fake and what's
[1:37:23] not fake i'll tell you
[1:37:25] god sent a sign and the word of the lord
[1:37:29] come
[1:37:29] to that prophet because that sign was
[1:37:32] the divine interpreter
[1:37:34] of the word so you know who you can lay
[1:37:37] your trust in
[1:37:38] i don't care how intellectually they get
[1:37:40] i don't matter how they can go through
[1:37:42] the bible
[1:37:43] if there isn't a divine sign that you
[1:37:46] can anchor them too
[1:37:48] then god didn't speak
[1:37:52] very good that's what he said
[1:37:56] so this call the call of your life
[1:38:01] the call of your actions the call of
[1:38:04] your
[1:38:05] journey the call of this decisions
[1:38:08] you're gonna make
[1:38:09] and the choices you make the
[1:38:12] call why we teach you young
[1:38:15] people the way that we teach you about
[1:38:17] dress and
[1:38:18] dating and getting involved and
[1:38:20] listening to things and all that
[1:38:22] it's all based on a sign
[1:38:27] it's not based on my opinion
[1:38:31] i let a lot of people play music i don't
[1:38:33] particularly care for
[1:38:37] okay but if all you had to do was listen
[1:38:40] to the music that i cared for
[1:38:42] you wouldn't like music
[1:38:48] but see but when it comes to
[1:38:51] the source the source is the sign
[1:38:57] without the sign the voice would have
[1:38:58] meant nothing
[1:39:02] i still think to us though having the
[1:39:04] seed in us
[1:39:05] we would identify with the word whether
[1:39:08] or not but he didn't leave it to us
[1:39:11] you understand he took the us out of it
[1:39:14] by providing a divine sign
[1:39:17] a prophet sent from god that did the
[1:39:21] works and the discernment of the
[1:39:23] thoughts and tents of the heart
[1:39:25] prophesying for telling things to come
[1:39:28] a true seer
[1:39:31] how many things have we seen just lately
[1:39:34] that have just come to pass come to pass
[1:39:36] come to pass
[1:39:40] so we know that that's our call our call
[1:39:44] to the life we live came
[1:39:47] from the sign and i'd like to read this
[1:39:53] in closing
[1:39:56] he was talking of jonah
[1:40:00] jonah come forth he was a prophet the
[1:40:03] lord had sent him
[1:40:05] and he tried to bypass it like moses
[1:40:12] you can't bypass the issue
[1:40:17] let me tell you you cannot by
[1:40:20] pass the issue the
[1:40:23] issues are coming the test
[1:40:27] is coming they're going to
[1:40:30] press us to the max compromise
[1:40:34] is in every offer
[1:40:40] if you don't know what you're built on
[1:40:43] if you don't know
[1:40:44] what you believe is built
[1:40:47] on a prophetic sign
[1:40:50] that god sent that the words that you
[1:40:53] believe
[1:40:54] are vindicated
[1:40:57] by the god that stood behind every word
[1:41:01] and it never failed you have got to have
[1:41:05] that
[1:41:06] in your heart you have got to have that
[1:41:08] in your anchor
[1:41:10] i i don't believe this because i
[1:41:12] filtered it through my mind
[1:41:14] i don't believe it because it it it
[1:41:17] added up to
[1:41:18] the way that i believe the bible i i
[1:41:20] don't believe it because there was
[1:41:22] miracles
[1:41:23] you have got to come to this place that
[1:41:25] you've seen in your life
[1:41:27] i've seen his sign
[1:41:31] that's what the wise men did they rolled
[1:41:33] into town
[1:41:34] they said where is he king of the jews
[1:41:36] i've seen his sign
[1:41:41] i've seen what god sent i didn't hear
[1:41:44] about it
[1:41:45] i didn't hear about it from daddy i
[1:41:47] didn't hear about it from the pastor
[1:41:50] i went and looked myself and i saw the
[1:41:53] sign
[1:41:56] i know it was a sign from god i know
[1:41:59] it's real
[1:42:00] i i know it's deep in my heart that's
[1:42:03] why i
[1:42:03] believe it that's why i follow it that's
[1:42:06] why i live the way i live
[1:42:08] i've heard the call of the
[1:42:13] love you sign jesus
[1:42:16] try to bypass it
[1:42:24] you can't bypass the issue many men will
[1:42:27] want to
[1:42:28] pat you on the back and say come into
[1:42:31] our group
[1:42:32] come into our group
[1:42:36] there is no group
[1:42:44] god is the only one you're under
[1:42:48] see come to us he bypassed it
[1:42:52] and went straight to tarsus
[1:42:55] god put him in a whale and sent him
[1:42:59] right back
[1:43:05] kind of reminds me when brother brown
[1:43:07] wanted to just go out and
[1:43:09] get away from it all it's like when i
[1:43:12] chose to
[1:43:13] moved out of california here i am a
[1:43:15] long-haired hippie
[1:43:16] we look at the map and we decide where
[1:43:19] are we going to move to
[1:43:22] we never considered church we never
[1:43:24] considered nothing you know
[1:43:26] we almost we looked and we picked the
[1:43:27] least populated state
[1:43:30] because we were hippies you know
[1:43:31] anti-society
[1:43:34] you know we pick a place that we thought
[1:43:36] was pretty
[1:43:38] and then we finally topped it off by
[1:43:40] throwing a dart
[1:43:42] at a map and it landed in just the place
[1:43:44] we were thinking about
[1:43:46] off we went well i never knew such a
[1:43:50] thing
[1:43:51] as mosquitoes
[1:43:58] being leslie planted a garden and our
[1:44:00] first radish was as big as our thumbnail
[1:44:05] three-month growing season we never knew
[1:44:07] nothing
[1:44:09] we didn't know we just went
[1:44:13] you know what i mean but guess what god
[1:44:16] sends you back
[1:44:20] you think you're going to run from it
[1:44:21] he'll send you back
[1:44:23] i thought i was in montana and god said
[1:44:26] you're going to preach the gospel in
[1:44:27] texas
[1:44:29] i was good i thought that meant one trip
[1:44:36] that's the truth i'm telling you it's
[1:44:38] honest straight from my heart i could
[1:44:40] tell you one
[1:44:41] on garfield street right where i was
[1:44:42] laying right now that old spring
[1:44:44] bed we had it didn't have a boxing just
[1:44:47] an old
[1:44:48] thin mattress on top of an old solid
[1:44:50] steel coil springs
[1:44:52] you know every time you roll over great
[1:44:54] great greek you know
[1:44:56] i know exactly where he spoke to me i
[1:44:59] didn't know how it was going to come to
[1:45:00] pass
[1:45:01] i didn't know my interpretations i went
[1:45:03] all the way to arizona but he finally
[1:45:05] got me here
[1:45:08] well god will bring you back it's hard
[1:45:09] to kick against the prick
[1:45:13] he said oh we do he put him in a well
[1:45:15] and sent him right back
[1:45:18] and he went in there and that was
[1:45:21] the sign and the voice of the sign
[1:45:25] was to repent or perish
[1:45:30] they followed the voice because they
[1:45:33] believed
[1:45:34] the sign
[1:45:38] they followed the voice because they
[1:45:40] believed
[1:45:41] the sign because the call
[1:45:45] was in the sign now
[1:45:48] you young teenagers young people people
[1:45:51] that are new to the message
[1:45:53] people that you came in because you
[1:45:55] heard the gospel you heard what the
[1:45:57] brother said
[1:45:58] you felt the love of the church you you
[1:46:01] felt that you you felt the worship and
[1:46:03] you felt the presence of the lord
[1:46:05] let me say that is good but take it back
[1:46:08] to the sign
[1:46:12] bring it back to the sign that's what
[1:46:16] called you
[1:46:18] not the pat on the backs

[1:46:41] and bypass and let them bypass
[1:46:46] the sign
[1:46:52] the signs the anchor
[1:46:55] that's what makes it personal
[1:47:01] he said and the voice of the sign was to
[1:47:03] repent perish
[1:47:04] and they follow the voice because they
[1:47:06] believe the sign
[1:47:08] and they didn't perish
[1:47:11] and that's the only way it was
[1:47:15] because they believed the sign
[1:47:18] and heard the voice that's the only way
[1:47:23] that the members of the churches
[1:47:26] of this day will fail to go into
[1:47:30] judgment
[1:47:30] is when they believe the sign and hear
[1:47:34] the voice of god
[1:47:39] that's simple let's not forget
[1:47:44] that we're not built on enticing
[1:47:48] preachers
[1:47:50] we're not built on men that can
[1:47:54] read quotes and and and
[1:47:57] stir our emotions or or look but
[1:48:00] each of us should have been
[1:48:03] and come to the place that we've seen
[1:48:07] the sign what god did in this day
[1:48:12] and i'm saying this because we preach
[1:48:14] the message
[1:48:17] we go in and we preach the message
[1:48:22] and people hear the message but you
[1:48:25] can't
[1:48:26] become fully anchored
[1:48:31] until you understand the sign
[1:48:34] so i'm saying to you if you haven't
[1:48:37] looked
[1:48:37] in your own life and went back and taken
[1:48:40] the tapes
[1:48:42] taking what the prophet of god said
[1:48:45] watch him identify the sign watch him
[1:48:48] identify the work that he's doing
[1:48:50] he's not praying for the sick just
[1:48:52] because of hebrews 13
[1:48:54] 8. he's praying for the sick because
[1:48:57] there was a sign
[1:48:58] that was following him being the
[1:49:01] fulfillment
[1:49:02] of malachi 4 5 luke 17
[1:49:05] 30 and revelations 10 7. church
[1:49:08] that's bible truth this that's scripture
[1:49:14] manifested vindicated and proven
[1:49:18] with a divine sign that proved that this
[1:49:21] was the scripture fulfilled so what i'm
[1:49:24] encouraging you to do
[1:49:26] is go back into the word of god and the
[1:49:29] message of the hour
[1:49:30] until you can identify the sign
[1:49:33] [Applause]
[1:49:38] and when you identify the sign
[1:49:42] then you will never have no problem
[1:49:46] never have a problem heeding the call
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:49:53] it's without whether i say it if i said
[1:49:56] what he said
[1:49:57] you don't go to me because i said it you
[1:50:00] go to the sign
[1:50:02] and you know it's the word of god so
[1:50:05] lord richly bless you i just want you to
[1:50:07] know
[1:50:07] what you're built in what we're about
[1:50:12] we're not about just another good
[1:50:14] teaching
[1:50:15] and i think we're the most lovely group
[1:50:17] of people that you could ask for
[1:50:19] i don't think a pastor could ask for a
[1:50:21] better group of people than the one we
[1:50:23] got the
[1:50:24] love you have one for another the care
[1:50:26] that you have
[1:50:27] one for another the the diversity that
[1:50:30] we have
[1:50:31] with all kinds of different countries
[1:50:33] and
[1:50:35] nations and everything you know
[1:50:39] just the the influences that i've got to
[1:50:42] balance and
[1:50:44] and try to keep in check it's
[1:50:47] but the spirit's wonderful but that's
[1:50:52] still not what we're built on
[1:50:55] they will know you're my disciples by
[1:50:58] your love for
[1:50:59] one for the other but why did you choose
[1:51:03] this way
[1:51:13] i know i've seen the work
[1:51:17] i've seen the word manifested in flesh
[1:51:20] i've seen his sign and because i saw the
[1:51:23] sign
[1:51:24] i heard the call and i knew that this
[1:51:27] was the way
[1:51:27] amen because he said i am the way the
[1:51:30] truth the life
[1:51:32] and no man come to this
[1:51:35] exodus without coming through
[1:51:39] this sign so lord richly bless you
[1:51:42] tonight the musicians would come
[1:51:44] we'll turn the service back over to
[1:51:46] billy
[1:51:47] they mean you know what it'd be good if
[1:51:49] all of us
[1:51:50] reacquainted ourselves with the sign
[1:51:55] just go back and and listen and
[1:51:58] and and just don't take the teaching
[1:52:01] just don't take the
[1:52:02] things that are said but sit there and
[1:52:05] look at that
[1:52:06] until you can identify and see that
[1:52:09] sign and that sign becomes so revelated
[1:52:12] to you
[1:52:13] that you know that you've heard the call
[1:52:16] yourself and you're not built on anybody
[1:52:19] else
[1:52:20] i've seen his sign
[1:52:24] and i'm here to worship the king
[1:52:27] god bless you tonight brother billy
