[10:04] here Lord and we find ourselves an
[10:08] opportunity to once again hear from
[10:10] you Lord I pray that you would now have

[10:34] that you would have your will this
[10:36] morning Lord we pray that your spirit
[10:38] would just deal with each Heart Lord I
[10:42] pray that every need would be met and
[10:44] Lord that your word would have the
[10:46] preeminence as we commit it to you in
[10:48] Jesus name
[10:50] amen let me go ahead and have your
[10:55] seats you know there's a um wonderful
[10:59] testimony
[11:00] given in the
[11:03] scriptures about two men
[11:07] who as a result of their
[11:10] work and their
[11:13] witness caused 5,000
[11:16] people to believe the word to be led to
[11:19] the
[11:21] Lord
[11:23] and because that didn't
[11:26] agree with how religious things were
[11:29] done in that
[11:32] day the church leaders took a hold of
[11:36] them and held them for
[11:39] questioning and
[11:41] demanded that they give an account of
[11:45] themselves by what right do you do this
[11:50] work under whose
[11:53] authority are you doing these things in
[11:56] the
[11:57] church and as these men be began to give
[12:01] their
[12:02] witness and to give account of
[12:05] themselves it says
[12:06] in Acts
[12:09] 4:13 now when they saw the boldness of
[12:12] Peter and
[12:13] John and perceived that they were
[12:16] unlearned and ignorant
[12:19] men they
[12:21] marveled and they took knowledge of
[12:24] them it became
[12:26] apparent that they had been with Jesus
[12:31] you know it wasn't because of how much
[12:33] they
[12:34] studied or how well they knew the
[12:37] scriptures or all the things that have
[12:39] been
[12:41] taught but it was because of who they
[12:43] had been
[12:45] with it was the result of his
[12:49] presence not their
[12:51] knowledge that caused them to do this
[12:56] work you know it says they were
[12:58] unlearned
[12:59] an ignorant
[13:01] man in fact history will tell us that
[13:04] they couldn't
[13:05] read they couldn't even write their own
[13:09] name in fact one of the oldest church
[13:11] fathers tells us that until he was a
[13:13] very old
[13:14] man John had never even seen his own
[13:18] face until one day he saw a mirror and
[13:21] saw his face in
[13:24] it but there was an effect of them
[13:28] having been with
[13:31] Jesus one of these unlearned and
[13:34] ignorant men would go on to say in the
[13:36] Book of Revelation chapter 1 unto him
[13:39] that loved
[13:41] us and washed us from our sins in his
[13:44] own
[13:45] blood and hath made us Kings and
[13:49] Priests unto God and his father to him
[13:53] be glory and Dominion forever and ever
[13:57] amen
[13:59] You Know Not
[14:00] only
[14:02] was this an unlearned and ignorant man
[14:06] declaring something
[14:08] which was not
[14:11] popular in religion or in the
[14:15] church but he was giving a testimony
[14:17] that he was a
[14:19] king and that he was a priest unto
[14:24] God you know this was on my mind this
[14:26] week as I was reading psalm 21 if you
[14:29] want to turn to that this morning we'll
[14:30] be reading
[14:33] that it's the psalm of a
[14:36] king you know and he begins in verse one
[14:39] the king shall joy in thy strength O
[14:45] Lord and in thy salvation how greatly
[14:48] shall he
[14:51] rejoice and as we'll read through the
[14:53] psalm it'll be David speaking of all the
[14:56] things all the work which God had done
[14:59] for
[15:01] him it's the psalm of a
[15:04] king but you know as I read this you
[15:06] know and this king is giving account to
[15:09] all the ways that God had been gracious
[15:11] to him it you know it occurred to me was
[15:15] it was it because he was a
[15:18] king that God was doing these
[15:21] things or was he a king because God had
[15:25] done all these things for him oh
[15:31] the other unlearned and
[15:33] ignorant
[15:36] man said this but ye are a chosen
[15:40] generation a royal
[15:43] priesthood Unholy
[15:46] Nation A peculiar people that you should
[15:50] show forth the Praises of him who ha
[15:52] called you out of Darkness Into His
[15:55] Marvelous
[15:56] Light which in time past were not a
[16:02] people but are now the people of God
[16:06] that's right which had not obtained
[16:10] Mercy but now have obtained Mercy that's
[16:14] right as John said in Revelation he has
[16:17] made us yes Kings and
[16:20] Priests we weren't Kings and Priests to
[16:23] begin with he made us because of the
[16:26] work that he did
[16:29] you know you can see why the church why
[16:32] the religious leaders would struggle
[16:34] with that I mean you're
[16:36] nobody I mean you're nothing you can't
[16:38] even read and you're saying you're a
[16:40] king and
[16:42] priest you know by what right do you
[16:45] make this
[16:48] claim you know that he has made us Kings
[16:51] and Priests a royal priesthood you know
[16:53] Exodus says it this way Exodus 19 now
[16:57] therefore if ye will obey my voice
[17:00] indeed and keep my Covenant then ye
[17:04] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[17:08] above all people for all the Earth is
[17:12] mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom
[17:16] of
[17:18] priests and an holy
[17:20] nation these are the words which Thou
[17:23] shalt speak unto the children of Israel
[17:25] that's right a kingdom of
[17:30] priests you know what is a
[17:33] king you know surely we all have these
[17:37] Earthly visions of what a king looks
[17:40] like you know a man sitting on a chair
[17:44] with a crown or a scepter in a palace
[17:48] with people bowing at his presence
[17:51] but what is a king
[17:54] really as we look at Psalm 21 begins to
[17:58] describe describe what a king
[18:01] is thou Hast given him his heart's
[18:04] desire this is verse one verse two
[18:07] rather and has not withholden the
[18:09] request of his
[18:11] lips you know the thing with a king is
[18:14] all he has to do is just
[18:16] ask and it's given to
[18:19] him if he needs something someone goes
[18:21] and gets it if he wants something it's
[18:25] his he has but to speak it
[18:30] what did Jesus tell us time and time
[18:33] again an example is John 1623 and in
[18:37] that day ye shall ask me
[18:40] nothing verily verily I say unto you
[18:43] whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my
[18:46] name he will give it you
[18:50] amen mark 11:24 therefore I say unto you
[18:54] what things soever ye desire When you
[18:57] pray
[18:59] believe that you receive them and you
[19:01] shall have
[19:03] them sounds like a king to
[19:06] me when a King asks for something it's
[19:12] his you know he's put us in a place
[19:15] whereas 1 John 3:22 says whatsoever we
[19:19] ask we receive of him just like a
[19:23] king verse three of Psalm 21 for thou
[19:26] preventest him with the blessings of of
[19:28] goodness thou set us a crown of pure
[19:31] gold on his head a king has a
[19:35] crown and all the blessings of the
[19:38] kingdom are
[19:40] his Paul said in 2 Timothy 4:8
[19:43] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[19:45] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[19:48] the righteous judge shall give me at
[19:50] that day and not to me
[19:54] only but unto all
[19:56] them that love his
[20:00] appearing Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the
[20:03] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[20:05] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[20:07] blessings in Heavenly places in
[20:10] Christ that sounds like a king to
[20:15] me Psalm
[20:18] 21:4 he the king asked Life Of Thee and
[20:24] thou gavest it him even Length of days
[20:28] forever and
[20:31] ever John 5:24 verily verily I say unto
[20:35] you here that he that heareth my word
[20:38] and believeth on him that sent
[20:40] me hath everlasting life and shall not
[20:45] come into condemnation but is passed
[20:47] from death into
[20:49] Life John 10:28 and I give unto them
[20:53] eternal
[20:54] life and they shall never perish neither
[20:58] shall any man pluck them out of my
[21:03] hand a
[21:05] king you know no doubt many scriptures
[21:08] come to mind as we go through that and
[21:09] we could go through each one of these
[21:11] verses in Psalm
[21:14] 21 and the thing is is this isn't
[21:16] someone a king talking about all the
[21:20] good things he has because he's a king
[21:23] he's a king because God has done all
[21:25] these things for him
[21:29] you know we're going to read Psalm 21
[21:31] together if you want to go ahead and
[21:32] stand
[21:35] but you know he has made us Kings and
[21:39] Priests on this
[21:41] Earth the real question is is what do
[21:45] you need to be about his
[21:49] work that's what a king is a king is
[21:51] someone who has
[21:53] dominion and a priest is someone who's
[21:55] about a Ministry and if he is already
[21:58] made us a royal priesthood a kingdom of
[22:02] priests the question is is what do you
[22:06] need to be about his
[22:09] work just ask it's
[22:13] yours to be about his word let's go
[22:17] ahead and read that Psalm 21 together
[22:19] the psalm of a
[22:22] king the king shall joy in thy strength
[22:25] oh Lord and in thy salvation how greatly
[22:28] shall he Rejoice thou Hast given him his
[22:31] heart's desire and has not withholden
[22:34] the request of his lips ca for thou
[22:37] preventest him with the blessings of
[22:38] goodness thou set us a crown of pure
[22:41] gold on his head he asked Life Of Thee
[22:43] and thou gavest it him even Length of
[22:46] days forever and ever his glory is great
[22:49] in thy salvation honor and Majesty hast
[22:52] thou laid upon him for thou has made him
[22:54] Most Blessed forever thou Hast made him
[22:57] exceeding glad with thy countenance for
[22:59] the king trusteth in the Lord and
[23:01] through the mercy of the most high he
[23:03] shall not be moved thine hand shall find
[23:06] out all thine enemies thy right hand
[23:08] shall find out those that hate thee Thou
[23:11] shalt make them as a fiery oven in the
[23:13] time of thine anger the Lord shall
[23:15] swallow them up in his wrath and the
[23:17] fire shall devour them their fruit shalt
[23:20] thou destroy from the earth and their
[23:22] seed from among the children of men for
[23:24] they intended evil against thee they
[23:26] imagined a misch device which they are
[23:29] not able to perform therefore shalt thou
[23:32] make them turn their back when thou
[23:33] shalt Make Ready thine arrows upon thy
[23:36] strings against the face of them be thou
[23:38] exalted Lord in thine own strength so

[54:58] supernatural way Lord that you would
[55:00] move our thoughts aside Lord we're going
[55:02] through struggles and trials and

[55:29] Lord and so now we're looking to you the
[55:31] author we're so thankful you're the

[55:37] something that you have already done we
[55:40] love you now we surrender ourselves to
[55:42] you and ask that you would just have
[55:43] your perfect will and weigh in this
[55:47] service Lord as
[55:51] we're before you now they come on my
[55:54] heart
[55:55] just to pray for our precious brother
[55:58] Ron
[55:59] Spencer knowing more test have come back

[56:04] into both of his eyes of
[56:07] cancer Lord that's what the doctors say
[56:10] they're doing the best they
[56:12] can but you have been fighting that
[56:15] battle you
[56:18] are the one
[56:21] who said that you would be an enemy to
[56:24] our enemies you'd be an adversary to our
[56:28] adversaries so Lord I'm asking that you
[56:30] would just move mightily on the scene
[56:32] once again for our precious brother Lord
[56:35] give him strength at this very moment
[56:37] encourage him Lord increase his faith
[56:40] for we know that with you all things are
[56:42] possible and the enemy has already been
[56:45] defeated Lord so we just thank you now
[56:47] for the victory we give you all the
[56:50] praise and glory in Jesus precious name
[56:52] we ask it amen blesses wonderful name if
[56:55] you have your
[56:57] Bibles and you'll turn in the Book of
[57:01] Joshua and then maybe you could uh find
[57:05] the book of Ephesians and we'll also uh
[57:08] read from
[57:10] there it's always good to come together
[57:13] with the saints of God and be able to
[57:16] sing the songs of Zion and be able to
[57:19] praise him and give him
[57:20] glory and we're so thankful that we're a
[57:23] people that we're not just wor shiing in
[57:26] spirit and and uh uh just you know being
[57:30] able to fill his blessings and his
[57:33] presence and and say all that was
[57:36] wonderful but we're worshiping in spirit
[57:38] and in
[57:40] truth something that we're a part of
[57:43] Amen let's just read in our
[57:46] Bibles in uh Joshua chapter
[57:53] one
[58:04] Joshua chapter 1 and verse
[58:10] one now after the death of Moses the
[58:13] servant of the Lord it came to pass that
[58:16] the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of
[58:18] nun Moses Minister saying Moses my
[58:21] servant is dead now therefore arise
[58:26] go over this Jordan thou and all this
[58:30] people under the land which I do give
[58:34] them even to the children of Israel I
[58:38] can't imagine how Joshua felt upon
[58:40] hearing
[58:41] that he could have said you know how
[58:43] long I've been waiting for
[58:45] this and now the Lord is telling arise
[58:48] it's time it's time to go over it's time
[58:52] to possess the
[58:53] land
[58:55] and he says every place that the soul of
[58:59] your foot shall tread
[59:01] upon that have I given unto you as I had
[59:05] said unto Moses amen you may be seated
[59:08] we pray that God would add a blessing
[59:11] upon the reading of his word every place
[59:14] the soul of your foot shall tread upon
[59:17] that have I given unto you as I said
[59:20] unto Moses I I try to I have a lot of
[59:23] things uh just over overwhelming in my
[59:25] heart U that I would like to to speak to
[59:28] you um and just maybe uh before we get
[59:32] into our message um just brother Brandon
[59:35] would say things that you know he he
[59:37] he'll just say these onliners or phrases
[59:39] you know that really catch your
[59:41] attention and because it's the word of
[59:42] God it it just it can always be an
[59:45] unfolding uh uh thought because it it he
[59:48] Christ is the word and so uh uh the
[59:51] prophet would say something like uh uh
[59:53] the Book of Joshua it's a a perfect
[59:55] parallel of Ephesians and and uh or
[59:58] Ephesian is a perfect parallel of Joshua
[1:00:01] and and I was just uh thinking about
[1:00:03] those things about parallels and and
[1:00:07] looking into the word and just along uh
[1:00:09] thinking about that my heart just
[1:00:11] started to settle on a message called a
[1:00:13] paradox and I started to listen to a
[1:00:16] paradox and I started with the one he he
[1:00:18] preaches in 1960 and then he preaches it
[1:00:21] in ' 61 and 62 and and uh 63 64 65 I
[1:00:26] believe he preaches it six times and and
[1:00:29] and I was just I was just meditating
[1:00:31] upon this and I started to to just think
[1:00:33] about parallels and paradoxes and and
[1:00:37] how how the prophet is saying that you
[1:00:38] know Ephesians parallels Joshua and many
[1:00:41] times we look into the word or we hear
[1:00:43] the prophet say something and and
[1:00:45] sometimes we just really can't make
[1:00:47] sense of it well I don't know about you
[1:00:50] but there's a lot of things that are
[1:00:51] laying in the word that I read it and
[1:00:53] and maybe I I I I try to to understand
[1:00:56] it I I try to uh uh maybe uh make it uh
[1:01:00] fit where in my mind where maybe I I can
[1:01:03] I can see what the prophet's saying and
[1:01:04] and many times you just can't do it you
[1:01:07] you you try to tie this the prophet will
[1:01:08] tie something together and and thank God
[1:01:11] it takes a prophet to be the one to tie
[1:01:12] it together because when men try to tie
[1:01:15] things together they tie things in knots
[1:01:17] and messes and just make a mess
[1:01:18] everything but I'm thankful that when
[1:01:20] God speaks through a prophet if he ties
[1:01:22] something together my responsibility say
[1:01:24] amen amen if the prophet tied it
[1:01:27] together it's tied together I'm not
[1:01:29] going to try to undo it I don't want to
[1:01:31] tie anything else into it and sometimes
[1:01:33] it's just a
[1:01:36] paradox and faith is a paradox so
[1:01:39] sometimes when we look into the word a
[1:01:42] and we see something laying there we
[1:01:43] just say man okay that's a that's a
[1:01:45] perfect parallel and it's a paradox a
[1:01:48] lot of times when you have a a a
[1:01:51] parallel well it's parallel because you
[1:01:53] can see that it's parallel I can see
[1:01:56] that those two boards are parallel it's
[1:01:58] something you can see but many times
[1:02:00] it's not something that you can see with
[1:02:01] the natural Li it has to be by faith and
[1:02:04] if Ephesians is a perfect parallel of
[1:02:06] Joshua there has to be a faith in The
[1:02:08] Believer to be able to look in the word
[1:02:11] and say if that's a perfect parallel
[1:02:13] Lord by faith I see myself in the
[1:02:17] word going to be a
[1:02:20] paradox there's things laying in the
[1:02:23] word they their perfect par parallels
[1:02:25] and things concerning
[1:02:28] you it's a complete Paradox and you
[1:02:32] can't you can't reason it you can't make
[1:02:35] sense of it and when brother Brandon
[1:02:37] would preach a paradox he would say that
[1:02:39] Webster when he would preach uh
[1:02:41] Webster's definition of a paradox is
[1:02:44] something that's
[1:02:46] incredible but it's true it's a paradox
[1:02:50] it's something that's incredible it
[1:02:52] seems unbelievable but yet W with with
[1:02:55] with all of how incredible it is and all
[1:02:58] how unbelievable it might appear it is
[1:03:01] true so when we look into the word I
[1:03:04] want us to by faith uh what I want to
[1:03:06] preach to you uh this morning is
[1:03:08] footsteps of Faith footsteps of Faith
[1:03:12] because oh God has given a promise
[1:03:15] now and if Ephesians is a perfect
[1:03:18] parallel of Joshua right then by Faith
[1:03:23] by footsteps you are taking the
[1:03:26] land that's right I love that because if
[1:03:30] you go into a trial come on you might
[1:03:33] have felt like you got whooped you might
[1:03:36] feel like you got stomped on and you
[1:03:38] just got all beat up but I maybe you're
[1:03:40] getting back up and you got a black eye
[1:03:42] and you felt like you got just whooped
[1:03:43] you just looked at and say my feet were
[1:03:47] there my feet were there and you might
[1:03:50] have pulled one on over me this time but
[1:03:52] my feet were there and God said wherever
[1:03:55] my feet go I am going to possess the
[1:03:58] trial I am going to be victorious I
[1:04:00] don't care what you're facing this
[1:04:02] morning come on I don't care how hard
[1:04:04] the trial seems if you're there your
[1:04:07] feet are there and if your feet are
[1:04:09] there God is there because he gave you a
[1:04:11] Divine promise that where your feet go
[1:04:14] you shall possess the
[1:04:16] land I say something I to well up in you
[1:04:19] right now that trial that hardship and
[1:04:21] everything that you're going through
[1:04:22] you're standing there yes
[1:04:26] it might be a
[1:04:28] paradox so we want to just try to lay a
[1:04:30] little Foundation before we move too
[1:04:36] far a prophet would say in
[1:04:39] adoption as I was just feeding on on
[1:04:42] these
[1:04:43] uh these messages that the the the
[1:04:45] prophet preached on a
[1:04:47] paradox um he he would mention um he
[1:04:51] would mention Joshua and he actually
[1:04:53] takes his text out of Joshua 10 for for
[1:04:56] many of them and then in the last
[1:04:58] Paradox he preaches he pulls in uh
[1:05:01] Joshua chapter one and and many times
[1:05:03] when when brother brandom would start to
[1:05:05] preach a paradox I know in the first one
[1:05:07] that he preaches uh uh before he even
[1:05:10] gets to his text and I tell you don't
[1:05:12] don't ever despise what the prophet says
[1:05:14] before his
[1:05:17] text no don't ever think just cut it off
[1:05:20] he said now let's pray you're missing a
[1:05:23] wealth
[1:05:24] you're missing a vast wealth of of God
[1:05:27] and His holy spirit continuing to do
[1:05:30] what he can only do and that's discern
[1:05:31] the thoughts and intense of your heart
[1:05:32] feed your hungry
[1:05:35] soul and and brother brandom in and I
[1:05:37] believe the first Paradox he he preaches
[1:05:40] he starts to talk about a a vision that
[1:05:42] he had he said I had a vision that that
[1:05:44] just drove it just uh drove me to my
[1:05:46] knees and it drove me out in this into
[1:05:48] the
[1:05:49] Wilderness and he starts to talk about
[1:05:51] how how how this drove him out into the
[1:05:54] Wilderness and and one of the brothers
[1:05:55] said well he was he was going out there
[1:05:57] just to seek God for an answer he's like
[1:05:59] well brother don't you go out there for
[1:06:01] uh uh to get visions and things like
[1:06:03] that he goes no I I don't go out there
[1:06:04] for for that you can't pull anything out
[1:06:07] of God he said that that's something
[1:06:09] that God brings on to you you know and
[1:06:11] he starts to tell them I went out there
[1:06:13] because I I wanted to uh uh uh I I just
[1:06:16] I I I wanted to to understand this
[1:06:19] vision and and what what God was was uh
[1:06:22] uh wanting to say and he starts to tell
[1:06:24] about this Vision about how uh it was
[1:06:26] the vision of the Mamba how he went out
[1:06:28] there and this this snake there that was
[1:06:30] coming for his brother it was certain
[1:06:32] death and he said it's a type of sin and
[1:06:34] it's the greatest of all of them it's
[1:06:35] it's death it's that Mamba it's that
[1:06:37] death snake and he said it was going
[1:06:39] towards his brother and and and there in
[1:06:41] that Vision it was just it it that snake
[1:06:43] turned towards him and he said I've
[1:06:45] given you power to bind
[1:06:47] it and and and he bound it in Jesus name
[1:06:50] and he said now to show you I give you
[1:06:52] power to unbind it just like the
[1:06:53] scripture says whenever you shall bind
[1:06:55] in Earth shall be bound in heaven he
[1:06:56] said okay if that be true then I say I
[1:06:59] unbind you in the name of Jesus and and
[1:07:01] the life came back in it it Rose back up
[1:07:03] and he and and God would tell him he
[1:07:05] would say now now in order for you to do
[1:07:10] this you must be more
[1:07:14] sincere and then he makes
[1:07:16] this H seems like a strange transition
[1:07:20] he goes he just it seems like he just
[1:07:22] out of nowhere uh mentions something
[1:07:24] that that seemed uh uh uh how how was
[1:07:27] this related he goes he goes and and he
[1:07:30] said you you must be more sinere for
[1:07:32] this he goes then I seen what he meant
[1:07:35] them years ago when the hand came out of
[1:07:38] heaven and read the first nine verses of
[1:07:43] Joshua and he's referring to there was a
[1:07:46] time in his ministry that he could take
[1:07:48] any Bible any Bible you would hand to
[1:07:51] him he could take a Bible and he say
[1:07:53] Lord what is your message message to me
[1:07:54] and it would just fall open to Joshua
[1:07:57] 1 profound that's a
[1:08:01] paradox and it just something in my
[1:08:03] heart struck me as as he he made this
[1:08:06] relation because we are living in our
[1:08:08] Ephesians we're we're here possessing
[1:08:10] the land and it seemed like when he said
[1:08:12] in order for you to do this you must be
[1:08:14] so be more sincere and he's preaching
[1:08:17] this Paradox and he's taken a a text out
[1:08:19] of Joshua 10 where Joshua would stand
[1:08:22] there and he would speak to the son
[1:08:24] because he had a need of and it would
[1:08:25] stand
[1:08:26] still well look if if Ephesians
[1:08:30] perfectly parallels Joshua then we can
[1:08:32] find our position in the word that God
[1:08:35] is calling us to this same thing but
[1:08:37] there must be more sincerity
[1:08:40] Church sir if God was telling the
[1:08:43] prophet you must be more sincere where
[1:08:44] does that place
[1:08:46] us so now just trying to move into our
[1:08:49] message and make a little progress by
[1:08:50] his
[1:08:52] grace uh brother Brandon would say in
[1:08:55] adoption he'd say our our Ephesians our
[1:08:58] Joshua which is the holy spirit Joshua
[1:09:00] mean Jesus Savior Joshua meaning the
[1:09:03] Holy Spirit represented it in a
[1:09:05] spiritual as that was in the natural he
[1:09:07] is our great warrior he's our great
[1:09:10] leader as Jo as God was with Joshua so
[1:09:14] is God in the Holy Spirit moving us
[1:09:17] about he would say more in the adoption
[1:09:20] series he would say uh the book of
[1:09:21] Ephesians perfectly parallels the Old
[1:09:24] Testament Joshua you say the book of
[1:09:26] Ephesians is the Book of Joshua of the
[1:09:29] New
[1:09:30] Testament in adoption 3 he would say and
[1:09:32] now the purpose of these lessons is to
[1:09:35] Anchor those that have already come
[1:09:37] across the land the purpose of this
[1:09:40] study in this book of Ephesians is to
[1:09:43] positionally place the church where it
[1:09:48] absolutely stands in
[1:09:51] Christ it is a type
[1:09:54] of the Old Testament and the Book of
[1:09:57] Joshua where Joshua laed and last Sunday
[1:10:00] we had it where Joshua lauded the land
[1:10:02] to each man and done it by
[1:10:06] inspiration why don't we just go ahead
[1:10:08] and turn in our Bibles to
[1:10:11] Ephesians because if it's a perfect
[1:10:19] parallel then it's this is pertaining to
[1:10:22] you this is your Ephesians this is your
[1:10:26] Promised
[1:10:28] Land scriptures were extremely familiar
[1:10:31] with but we now by faith we
[1:10:34] must come into the manifestation of the
[1:10:37] things that we're hearing and this this
[1:10:41] message our Joshua this ministry of
[1:10:44] Malachi 4:5 is the one God sent to
[1:10:47] provide the way to take us into these
[1:10:50] promises uh make no mistake about it
[1:10:52] without Malachi four or five none of
[1:10:54] this is
[1:10:55] possible now now uh I don't want to
[1:10:59] fight over that doctrinally I'll just
[1:11:01] say it maybe like this if you could let
[1:11:02] me off for me there was no other way for
[1:11:05] me to come into my
[1:11:08] inheritance but by the Elijah
[1:11:11] Ministry but by the Joshua
[1:11:14] Ministry that was commissioned to take
[1:11:16] the bride into all the promises that God
[1:11:20] had left for in the end time outside of
[1:11:22] that there's no provided
[1:11:25] way because God said as I was with Moses
[1:11:28] so shall I be with you Joshua was
[1:11:30] commissioned to take the people
[1:11:34] over and Joshua is a
[1:11:36] type of the great savior a great Jehovah
[1:11:40] the one who's fighting our battles the
[1:11:42] one who's given us the
[1:11:45] victory so then as we look into our
[1:11:47] Bible uh I pray that it's okay just to
[1:11:50] do a little
[1:11:52] reading as we look into Ephesians now
[1:11:54] footsteps of Faith just have that uh on
[1:11:57] your heart and parallels and in the word
[1:12:00] and and Par how Ephesians is paralleling
[1:12:03] uh uh Joshua and them coming in and
[1:12:05] taking the land you know there was there
[1:12:07] were still battles and still hardships
[1:12:09] and and fighting and everything in the
[1:12:11] promised
[1:12:13] land so just because you're fighting and
[1:12:15] having a hard time and going through a
[1:12:17] battle don't put yourself out he put you
[1:12:22] in don't put put yourself out he put you
[1:12:27] in all right so just starting with verse
[1:12:30] three he says blessed be the God and
[1:12:32] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha
[1:12:36] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:12:40] in Heavenly places in
[1:12:43] Christ that should be enough for you to
[1:12:45] jump up holler Scream and Shout run
[1:12:48] around and dance if you could only catch
[1:12:50] the inspiration oh if we could catch the
[1:12:53] inspiration and the revelation of what
[1:12:55] Christ has done for you in this
[1:12:58] hour that you are seated in Heavenly
[1:13:00] places in Christ Jesus that is your
[1:13:04] position in
[1:13:07] Christ now listen to what he's
[1:13:10] done who did he do it
[1:13:16] for you know you you you you you ever
[1:13:18] seen somebody play a a bingo game I
[1:13:21] think I went one time in my life to a
[1:13:23] bingo
[1:13:25] game and you know everybody's sitting
[1:13:27] down and everybody's studying and
[1:13:29] looking and they start reading
[1:13:32] out and all of a sudden you know
[1:13:34] everybody's kind of quiet and they're
[1:13:36] just and just I can't even remember how
[1:13:38] it goes there
[1:13:41] 45
[1:13:44] 21 two just seems kind of boring and
[1:13:47] mundane and all a sudden somebody goes
[1:13:51] Bingo b I got bingo
[1:13:55] well hey that that's in the natural I
[1:13:56] pray while we're reading this something
[1:13:58] in your heart go
[1:14:01] Bingo according as he hath chosen Us in
[1:14:07] him when did he do it before the
[1:14:11] foundation of the world that we should
[1:14:14] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:14:17] love
[1:14:19] Bingo I can't understand it I can't
[1:14:22] describe it it's a
[1:14:25] paradox it's
[1:14:26] incredible but something in my soul says
[1:14:30] it is
[1:14:32] true I believe
[1:14:38] it having predestinated
[1:14:41] us unto the adoption of
[1:14:45] children by Jesus Christ to
[1:14:48] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:14:52] of
[1:14:53] your your will according to if if you
[1:14:57] could put it all
[1:14:59] together according to if if if you were
[1:15:02] a better person come
[1:15:05] on come on break out of your shell this
[1:15:08] morning I know you're going through a
[1:15:10] hard time I know you got a a lot on your
[1:15:15] plate but I'm so glad that has no
[1:15:19] bearing on where you came from it has no
[1:15:22] bearing on where you're going I don't
[1:15:24] care how many times you've Fallen how
[1:15:26] many times you failed everything looks
[1:15:29] like a mess that you're not going to be
[1:15:30] able to make it but I say if something
[1:15:32] in your heart this morning can look into
[1:15:35] the word of God and just say bingo
[1:15:38] that's me and I am free because he has
[1:15:40] chosen me before the foundation of the
[1:15:43] world that I would be adopted the
[1:15:46] problem is is we're trying to adopt
[1:15:49] ourselves you can't adopt yourself quit
[1:15:52] trying you're trying to make yourself
[1:15:54] good enough I'm going to make myself to
[1:15:55] be a good enough son if I can just do
[1:15:58] this if I can just overcome that if I
[1:16:00] can just make it over here that trial
[1:16:02] that I keep coming against I keep
[1:16:04] failing over and over and over again and
[1:16:06] just one time if I could just prove that
[1:16:08] I'm a son well it has no bearing on it
[1:16:11] you are always a son that's the reason
[1:16:14] you could be quickened that's the reason
[1:16:16] you can hear his voice this morning I
[1:16:19] don't care how bad he looks my sheep
[1:16:21] hear my voice
[1:16:27] you hath he
[1:16:29] quickened when did he do
[1:16:32] it I say when did he do it why you were
[1:16:37] in sin and trespasses he had already
[1:16:40] quickened you he had already made you
[1:16:43] alive where were you when the sons of
[1:16:46] God shouted for Joy you were back there
[1:16:49] in
[1:16:51] him when were you made alive before the
[1:16:55] foundation of the world you were in him
[1:16:58] you were in his thinking you were in the
[1:17:02] Loos oh
[1:17:06] my well if that's where you come from
[1:17:09] come on if that's what you're a part
[1:17:13] of didn't the scripture say ye are Gods
[1:17:16] to whom the word of the Lord comes to
[1:17:19] yes and God by Divine promise through
[1:17:21] Malachi 4:5 has come to you behold I
[1:17:26] send you
[1:17:27] Elijah who was this Elijah
[1:17:30] ministry as I was with
[1:17:33] Moses so shall I be with
[1:17:36] you yes it wasn't the man
[1:17:41] Moses it was the god in
[1:17:44] Moses it wasn't the man Joshua it was
[1:17:47] the same pillar fire that led him
[1:17:50] through the Wilderness that was with
[1:17:51] Joshua amen
[1:17:56] oh
[1:18:00] Hallelujah having predestinated us unto
[1:18:05] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:18:09] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:18:11] of his
[1:18:13] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:18:17] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:18:21] in the Beloved
[1:18:24] oh hey I'm I'm getting
[1:18:26] excited I had kind of a little bit rough
[1:18:29] patch but you know what I'm accepted and
[1:18:31] the
[1:18:32] Beloved you know that's that that that's
[1:18:34] a hard thing in today's society that's a
[1:18:37] hard thing I tell you even even growing
[1:18:39] up you young kids and certain ones
[1:18:41] everybody wants to be
[1:18:44] accepted it causes complexes it causes
[1:18:47] hard feelings it causes doubt it causes
[1:18:50] uh uh trials where I remember as a young
[1:18:52] young kid I'd be walking around the
[1:18:54] corner and there would be some girls or
[1:18:57] boys talking in Spanish and something in
[1:18:59] my complex just like they're they're
[1:19:01] talking about
[1:19:04] me not that I thought anything of myself
[1:19:06] but it was a
[1:19:08] complex I was worried about you know I I
[1:19:10] mean uh do I look a little goofy cuz man
[1:19:14] I looked
[1:19:15] goofy I went to a a private school and
[1:19:19] and my parents doing the best they could
[1:19:20] until they kicked me out
[1:19:24] hey we don't want you back man we want
[1:19:27] your kind around here you're not
[1:19:29] accepted so I went over to I had to go
[1:19:31] to a public school my parents were
[1:19:33] trying their best to to do what they
[1:19:34] could and so and I started going to a
[1:19:36] public School sixth grade was my first
[1:19:38] first a chance in in public school well
[1:19:41] you know what I wasn't able to wear
[1:19:43] sweats and a t-shirt to my private
[1:19:46] school so to me the coolest thing ever
[1:19:48] was that I could wear sweats and a
[1:19:50] t-shirt to
[1:19:51] class so I thought thought I can wear
[1:19:53] sweats and a t-shirt well you know how
[1:19:55] cool sweats and a t-shirt is sorry back
[1:19:58] then it wasn't really
[1:20:00] cool I wore sweat sweatpants and t-shirt
[1:20:05] to class like every
[1:20:07] day well you know I really wasn't that
[1:20:10] accepted I was a Rowdy one I I I got in
[1:20:13] a lot of
[1:20:15] trouble but you know everybody wants to
[1:20:17] be accepted and I I I think it when it
[1:20:20] comes to the house of God I think it's a
[1:20:22] shame when within our own circles that
[1:20:24] our brothers and sisters don't feel
[1:20:28] accepted we have people in our youth
[1:20:30] group who don't feel accepted by other
[1:20:37] youth I'm sorry about it they ain't cool
[1:20:40] enough they don't listen to Rock
[1:20:42] Christian like I
[1:20:45] do well I'm sorry about it they ain't as
[1:20:48] trendy and cool they don't wear their
[1:20:50] skirts as short as I do
[1:20:55] but you know it goes the other
[1:20:57] way it goes the other way more than it
[1:21:00] does that way we wear our skirts to the
[1:21:02] floor look at them sisters they wear
[1:21:04] their skirts short so
[1:21:06] what why don't you be God to them why
[1:21:10] don't you be you think they want
[1:21:11] anything you got when you draw them out
[1:21:13] of your circle and say look at us we're
[1:21:15] so holy and piest we got it all down
[1:21:17] they don't want what you got because you
[1:21:19] ain't got the Life of
[1:21:21] Christ but if we can just draw the
[1:21:23] circle bigger come on youth there ain't
[1:21:26] no big eyes or big little youth it has
[1:21:29] to be Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:21:32] looking out and say you know what that
[1:21:34] young person that's in our young group
[1:21:36] they're never coming around you know we
[1:21:37] ought to make an
[1:21:39] effort to to include
[1:21:42] them oh be
[1:21:46] careful prophet of God would tell a
[1:21:48] story in the Paradox he he he he would
[1:21:51] come down to many of the end and he
[1:21:53] this this story meant so much to him one
[1:21:54] of his friends uh started telling
[1:21:56] brother brandom I want to ask you
[1:22:00] something he said uh you believe in a
[1:22:02] paradox and that's actually that story
[1:22:05] is
[1:22:06] what caused the prophet to preach this
[1:22:09] message six times and he says well sure
[1:22:12] I do he goes you
[1:22:13] know there was a time as a
[1:22:17] druggist where was back in the days of
[1:22:20] the depression and and and we were just
[1:22:24] doing the best we could at the times and
[1:22:26] and this this this young couple came in
[1:22:28] and he he came in because he wanted to
[1:22:30] get some medicine for his wife who was
[1:22:32] with child and ready to give at any time
[1:22:34] and they didn't have much time and they
[1:22:36] had to get this medicine they came in uh
[1:22:38] to the drugas and his boy he was running
[1:22:40] the
[1:22:43] counter and they said sir I I I I I I
[1:22:46] don't have the money to pay for this but
[1:22:48] we're in we're in a a dire place I I I I
[1:22:51] got to get this medicine for my wife is
[1:22:55] is it possible that you could just give
[1:22:57] me the medicine I I I I'll make it up to
[1:22:59] you the best I can he said sir I'm sorry
[1:23:01] we have procedures and policies we just
[1:23:03] can't do that he said but if you go on
[1:23:06] down the corner down there's government
[1:23:08] assistance down over there if you go
[1:23:09] fill out the papers and all that they
[1:23:11] they'll be sure to give you the the
[1:23:12] money so you can come and make the
[1:23:14] purchase the man didn't have that kind
[1:23:16] of time but he just looked at him said
[1:23:19] okay thank you and he turned to go away
[1:23:21] and his daddy back there the drug us
[1:23:23] said something just in his heart said
[1:23:24] wait a minute boy what was that about
[1:23:26] he's said oh well his wife she's with
[1:23:28] child and they're ready to deliver and
[1:23:29] they needed this prescription but they
[1:23:31] don't have any they don't have any uhh
[1:23:34] uh money to purchase he said you know
[1:23:36] you run to tell them to come
[1:23:38] back he's telling brother brandom he
[1:23:40] said brother Brandon there he was he he
[1:23:42] got the prescription all together and he
[1:23:44] just figured you know we'll be able to
[1:23:46] make do without it I'll just go ahead
[1:23:47] and give it to him he says and and as
[1:23:49] the drug us handed that prescription
[1:23:51] over into his hand hands as he placed it
[1:23:53] into the hands that hand opened up he
[1:23:55] says brother brandom they were nail
[1:23:57] scarred hands and I saw that it was
[1:24:01] Jesus Christ he said brother brandom is
[1:24:03] it crazy do you believe that he said yes
[1:24:07] I believe that with all of my heart it
[1:24:09] was a paradox the least you have done
[1:24:11] unto these you have done unto me how
[1:24:14] much more those of the household of
[1:24:16] faith oh there ought to be a sincerity
[1:24:19] in our heart a sincerity and Truth to
[1:24:22] have the love of God shed abroad that we
[1:24:24] would love one another that we would
[1:24:27] look on the needs of one another that we
[1:24:29] want them to be accepted and the Beloved
[1:24:32] but I say if you feel like a cast out
[1:24:35] you feel like you're unaccepted if you
[1:24:36] feel like no one's accepted you I got
[1:24:38] good news this
[1:24:40] morning if by faith you can look into
[1:24:43] the word as he has
[1:24:46] said in he said to the praise and the
[1:24:50] glory of his grace wherein he have made
[1:24:52] us accepted in the
[1:24:55] Beloved thank you Lord
[1:24:57] Jesus thank you Lord Jesus thank you
[1:25:01] Lord Jesus that when anybody else might
[1:25:04] not have accepted me the only thing that
[1:25:07] matters is have you accepted me reminds
[1:25:10] me of the woman that was caught in
[1:25:12] adultery they grabbed her and they took
[1:25:14] her and threw her down at his
[1:25:18] feet she was condemned to die
[1:25:26] what a story that is we one by
[1:25:29] one I say in that
[1:25:32] presence which one of
[1:25:35] us is without
[1:25:37] sin cast the first
[1:25:40] stone in that presence you think you can
[1:25:44] show up into that presence into that
[1:25:46] great light with your works with your
[1:25:50] piety with your dress code
[1:25:52] with your experience none of that will
[1:25:56] do there's only one thing that'll
[1:25:59] do where are your
[1:26:04] accusers none but thee Lord and neither
[1:26:07] do I accuse you no matter how bad it is
[1:26:12] no matter how far you've gone I don't
[1:26:14] accuse you blessed is the man whom the
[1:26:17] Lord will not impute in I don't accuse
[1:26:20] you a matter of fact I say you're
[1:26:23] forgiven I say you never did it in the
[1:26:25] first place go and sin no more
[1:26:29] Hallelujah that's the kind of acceptance
[1:26:31] I
[1:26:34] want in whom we have Redemption through
[1:26:37] his blood the Forgiveness of sins
[1:26:41] according to the riches of his grace
[1:26:44] wherein he hath abounded towards us in
[1:26:46] all wisdom and
[1:26:48] Prudence now I like this
[1:26:51] one having made known unto us the
[1:26:55] mystery of his
[1:26:58] will according to his good
[1:27:01] pleasure which he hath
[1:27:03] purposed in himself well just put your
[1:27:06] seat Bel
[1:27:11] on this whole last day
[1:27:14] mystery concerns
[1:27:19] you the book of Ephesians
[1:27:23] the Book of
[1:27:24] Joshua is just a perfect parallel and a
[1:27:28] type of what God is doing in the
[1:27:31] bride how can one understand it how can
[1:27:35] one fathom it it's a
[1:27:38] paradox it's
[1:27:41] incredible but it's true yes sir so why
[1:27:45] don't we just move on here from our text
[1:27:48] now and we'll cover some ground out of a
[1:27:50] paradox brother Brandon would say
[1:27:53] say in
[1:27:56] 65 uh paragraph 57 he says Joshua here
[1:28:00] in the book actually it's a book of
[1:28:03] redemption of the Old Testament Joshua
[1:28:06] we would have to consider it to be that
[1:28:09] the book of redemption because its
[1:28:10] Redemption has two
[1:28:12] parts Redemption anywhere has two parts
[1:28:16] that is it's out of and into it takes
[1:28:19] two parts to make Redemption out of into
[1:28:22] two Moses represented the law which
[1:28:24] brought them out of Egypt and whereas
[1:28:27] Joshua represents Grace that took them
[1:28:29] into the promised land so what took him
[1:28:32] into the promised land
[1:28:34] Grace another way the another way was
[1:28:38] the law and Grace were two different
[1:28:41] aspects of God's command now the law
[1:28:44] brought them out Moses and Joshua took
[1:28:47] them
[1:28:48] in it also represents something for our
[1:28:52] day now it represents as they were in
[1:28:55] the Journey coming out from Egypt into
[1:28:57] the promised land so have we come out of
[1:29:00] the world of Egypt Chaos on our road to
[1:29:04] a promised land in my father's house are
[1:29:07] many mansions if it wasn't so I would
[1:29:11] have told you John
[1:29:14] 14 coming
[1:29:17] out and going
[1:29:20] into if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:29:24] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:29:28] myself that where I
[1:29:31] am you may be
[1:29:34] also where is
[1:29:38] he where is he you know that's really
[1:29:42] what everybody's probing at down Through
[1:29:43] the
[1:29:45] Ages who is this
[1:29:48] MDC where is he who is this God where
[1:29:51] did we come from where are we
[1:29:54] going he said I will come again I will
[1:29:57] take you out of the chaos and things
[1:29:59] that are to be talks about how he he's
[1:30:01] coming what to take us out of this pest
[1:30:05] house and into a land where there's no
[1:30:08] more Wars there's no more sickness
[1:30:12] there's no more death John
[1:30:15] 14 but don't miss the
[1:30:18] mystery he said I will come again and
[1:30:20] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:30:22] ye may be also well just keep reading a
[1:30:26] little bit further down in John
[1:30:28] 14 it says at that day ye shall know
[1:30:31] that I am in the father and the father
[1:30:35] in me and I in you and you and me then
[1:30:39] where is
[1:30:40] he where is he he said I will come
[1:30:44] again he said I will come again to
[1:30:48] receive you unto myself oh this is the
[1:30:51] mission
[1:30:52] history this is what he had purposed in
[1:30:55] himself as God was with Joshua so is God
[1:30:59] in the Holy Spirit moving us about
[1:31:02] moving us placing us bringing us into
[1:31:04] the promise making it a
[1:31:10] reality I will
[1:31:14] come then who is it that's
[1:31:17] here it's
[1:31:19] him the same one the same one that was
[1:31:22] with Moses the same one that was with
[1:31:24] Joshua the same one that was with
[1:31:26] brother brandham the same
[1:31:29] one under this great mystery in the
[1:31:31] revelation of the Seven Seals it's now
[1:31:33] Christ the Capstone coming to the
[1:31:35] bride God and morphe God conding sin God
[1:31:39] having fellowship with his
[1:31:42] attributes so if by faith or by the
[1:31:45] inspiration we can catch it remember the
[1:31:47] prophet is saying Ephesians perfectly
[1:31:49] parallels
[1:31:50] Joshua
[1:31:52] the Holy Spirit now moving us
[1:31:55] into the promised land see we really
[1:31:58] didn't even know what our promised land
[1:32:00] was it took a
[1:32:02] profit this book was
[1:32:04] sealed it was a
[1:32:06] mystery and it took the Joshua Ministry
[1:32:09] of our
[1:32:11] day to be able to take us in and start
[1:32:14] to describe us the boundaries to start
[1:32:17] to open up the word and say this is
[1:32:20] yours this is yours this is your
[1:32:23] inheritance this is all for
[1:32:26] you so remember the parallel now right
[1:32:30] you you get into your Bible in Genesis
[1:32:32] 15 is is when God gave Abraham the
[1:32:36] promise he gave him boundaries and
[1:32:38] descriptions of the promised
[1:32:40] land he said Abraham I I have given thee
[1:32:43] in thy seed this land from the from the
[1:32:45] Great River uh of Egypt all the way to
[1:32:48] the river Euphrates oh from there to
[1:32:51] there all the way way to the sea to the
[1:32:52] going down of the sun all of this
[1:32:55] inheritance is
[1:32:58] yours now we could look onto a map and
[1:33:01] we could start to maybe uh draw it all
[1:33:03] out and we could actually see with maybe
[1:33:05] our natural eye or get an idea of what
[1:33:08] the promised land was what the
[1:33:11] description was of the land that God had
[1:33:14] given to
[1:33:16] Abraham now remember we're talking about
[1:33:18] a parallel of Ephesians and Joshua of
[1:33:21] them possessing that land that was given
[1:33:24] unto
[1:33:25] Abraham well in your mind it's it's it's
[1:33:28] easy maybe to get an idea of what the
[1:33:32] promised land was to
[1:33:36] Abraham but now when it comes to the
[1:33:38] parallel for you what is your Promised
[1:33:42] Land what is your
[1:33:45] promise we have to look into the
[1:33:48] word and by revelation
[1:33:52] by the Elijah Ministry or the Joshua
[1:33:54] Ministry of this day by Revelation has
[1:33:57] to bring us in and reveal to us what our
[1:34:00] promised land is because without that
[1:34:03] it's a mystery it's veiled we we we
[1:34:05] we're just probing we're just presuming
[1:34:07] we're just wandering EXC we're just
[1:34:10] trying to do our best and trying to make
[1:34:12] a way for
[1:34:14] ourselves but I want to Anchor this down
[1:34:17] a familiar scripture a as he says that
[1:34:20] footsteps were possession right they had
[1:34:22] a natural land just walk into there get
[1:34:25] them feet get the souls of them feet on
[1:34:27] that land and it's
[1:34:30] yours now it's a perfect parallel in our
[1:34:33] scripture and our Bible tells us in
[1:34:35] second Corinthians 5:7 we walk by
[1:34:39] faith not by
[1:34:42] sight so I'm trying to preach a little
[1:34:45] bit this morning on footsteps of
[1:34:48] faith that by faith you can walk walk
[1:34:51] through the word oh thank you Lord
[1:34:55] Jesus and you can
[1:34:58] possess the promises that God has given
[1:35:00] unto you look your carnal mind's going
[1:35:03] to fail you that's
[1:35:05] right you are being led by the spirit of
[1:35:09] almighty
[1:35:10] God as I was with Moses so I will be
[1:35:14] with
[1:35:16] thee I thought about what a comfort that
[1:35:18] was to
[1:35:20] Joshua you imagine all right man it's
[1:35:23] time to go take the land that'd be a lot
[1:35:25] of pressure and
[1:35:27] responsibility like well Lord I know
[1:35:28] you've given me the given me the promise
[1:35:31] but I've seen this stiff neck
[1:35:33] people you know Moses got angry and
[1:35:36] smoked the Rock and they're always
[1:35:38] murmuring and
[1:35:41] complaining but what did he tell them as
[1:35:43] I was with
[1:35:45] Moses so shall I be with
[1:35:48] thee maybe Joshua starting to think my
[1:35:51] there we were in Egypt under them task
[1:35:54] Masters and there came them plagues one
[1:35:58] after another after another and God
[1:36:01] brought us out by a mighty
[1:36:04] hand and we come to the Red
[1:36:07] Sea and we were stuck on nowhere to go
[1:36:12] seemed like we were doomed and ready to
[1:36:14] be
[1:36:15] perished as all the people murmured and
[1:36:17] complained have you brought us out here
[1:36:19] to die
[1:36:20] Moses
[1:36:24] and then God by a mighty
[1:36:27] hand come down and parted the Red
[1:36:31] Sea and brought us through on dry
[1:36:36] land and got the unbeliever so puffed up
[1:36:39] in themselves they thought they could
[1:36:40] follow where a believer's footsteps
[1:36:43] went no that was a provided way for the
[1:36:45] children of
[1:36:48] Israel and God swallowed up the enemy
[1:36:51] and maram took that tambourine and
[1:36:53] started to rejoice and dance upon the
[1:36:54] banks say oh our enemy our Taskmaster is
[1:36:57] dead and Moses would uh write that song
[1:37:00] uh great and marvelous are thy Works
[1:37:02] Lord God Almighty just and true are thy
[1:37:05] ways Thou King of saints you've overcome
[1:37:07] the horse and a Trier you've swallowed
[1:37:09] up the
[1:37:12] enemy they got out there and had uh
[1:37:15] Bitter Water they mured and a complain
[1:37:18] they got hungry and man I came down out
[1:37:20] of the sky and every time they come to a
[1:37:22] place they had a need actually see
[1:37:24] Joshua saying you know
[1:37:26] what you'll be with me
[1:37:30] Lord if you've brought me this
[1:37:34] far if you have brought me this
[1:37:38] far then surely Lord you will bring me
[1:37:42] all the way and Joshua was
[1:37:47] anointed Joshua was anointed to take the
[1:37:51] land
[1:37:53] Joshua was so anointed that one day he
[1:37:55] had a need
[1:37:58] right one day Joshua had an e he said
[1:38:02] Son stand
[1:38:05] still brother Brandon would speak about
[1:38:08] that in the Paradox his daughter Rebecca
[1:38:09] would comes like Daddy you
[1:38:11] know according
[1:38:14] to I mean you know the sun you know it's
[1:38:18] kind of already still
[1:38:22] it's not our science books and
[1:38:24] everything ain't kind
[1:38:26] of said it's it's the Earth spinning the
[1:38:29] sun standing still and what place he say
[1:38:32] honey I don't know all I knows he said
[1:38:36] it in other places he says it in an need
[1:38:38] he says it wasn't so much that missile
[1:38:41] out there I'm like
[1:38:42] huh he said it was the light coming from
[1:38:45] it that he
[1:38:46] needed like so so so the light the sun
[1:38:49] had admitted is what he was telling to
[1:38:51] stay stay
[1:38:54] huh it's a
[1:38:56] paradox I can't figure it
[1:38:59] out alls I know is Joshua had a
[1:39:02] need he was given a promise he was in
[1:39:06] the line of
[1:39:07] duty he was there according to the word
[1:39:10] of God and he said Son stand
[1:39:14] still and the Sun and the Moon and the
[1:39:16] Earth had to obey because there was a
[1:39:19] son of God walking in his commission I
[1:39:24] say there's sons and daughters in the
[1:39:26] house of God that are right now walking
[1:39:29] in their commission not something that
[1:39:31] you've done but you are the accepted and
[1:39:34] the Beloved you have been predestinated
[1:39:37] you have been gathered together by a
[1:39:39] shout that is why you are here not
[1:39:42] something that you can do it is
[1:39:43] something that he has already done it is
[1:39:46] something that he is doing in The Bride
[1:39:49] of Jesus Christ son stand
[1:39:53] still well that sounds pretty good
[1:39:58] Matthew but you know I I'm just a
[1:40:02] housewife I'm just a
[1:40:04] professional
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:08] student I'm not a warrior like
[1:40:11] Joshua I'm not a
[1:40:14] preacher I don't have
[1:40:16] position in the
[1:40:18] church what does that even mean
[1:40:23] position between four walls are going to
[1:40:26] burn I'm interested in the position that
[1:40:28] God's
[1:40:29] [Music]
[1:40:32] given you think your position in the
[1:40:35] natural has anything to
[1:40:39] do it makes me think of that story I
[1:40:41] can't help
[1:40:42] it they come by the plantation say why
[1:40:44] is he different from everybody else I
[1:40:47] wondered myself is it his position come
[1:40:50] on
[1:40:52] did you elevate
[1:40:54] him did you feed him
[1:40:57] better do you treat him better I often
[1:41:00] wondered my that myself but I found out
[1:41:04] in another
[1:41:06] land across the
[1:41:08] sea he's the son of a king he acts like
[1:41:12] it he talks like it he conducts himself
[1:41:15] like it I don't care what your job is
[1:41:18] you ought to act like the son and
[1:41:20] daughter of a
[1:41:25] king like that one girl who threw out
[1:41:27] the wash
[1:41:29] waterer what was her
[1:41:34] position all the step sisters and
[1:41:37] everybody were laughing at her as she
[1:41:39] was preparing to be
[1:41:41] married H you ain't got no
[1:41:44] inheritance you ain't gotten
[1:41:47] nothing she had something more than any
[1:41:49] of them had
[1:41:51] she had a
[1:41:54] promise I will meet you
[1:41:57] there
[1:42:00] Hallelujah her position was in the
[1:42:04] promise not in what Society
[1:42:07] granted not what what anybody else could
[1:42:11] give oh Joshua could do that because you
[1:42:14] know he was a great Mighty
[1:42:16] General he had position in the church he
[1:42:19] had office was okay
[1:42:23] Prophet would pick that up and say you
[1:42:24] know some 1,400 years
[1:42:26] ago in
[1:42:29] Jericho about 10 miles from the spot
[1:42:33] where Joshua spoke to the
[1:42:35] son there was a little wretched
[1:42:38] beggar he was
[1:42:40] poor he was
[1:42:43] blind what position did he have what
[1:42:46] influence on society did he
[1:42:49] have he couldn't walk into the church
[1:42:51] house or the S look at me he couldn't go
[1:42:53] into the dinner halls and and have
[1:42:55] Prestige and all this no he he was just
[1:42:57] an outcast he was just on the side of
[1:42:59] the road he was just a dirty poor little
[1:43:01] blind wretched
[1:43:05] beggar but none of
[1:43:08] that none of that had anything to do as
[1:43:12] his
[1:43:16] position in the
[1:43:19] word because there in them streets of
[1:43:23] Jericho all of that noise and all of
[1:43:25] that commotion was going
[1:43:28] on he screamed out thou son of
[1:43:31] David have mercy on
[1:43:35] me and the prophet said the same faith
[1:43:39] that Joshua stopped the sun with blind
[1:43:43] barname stopped the so n of God oh it
[1:43:47] doesn't take some prestigious position
[1:43:50] it takes a son or a daughter of God to
[1:43:52] speak the name of Jesus why don't you
[1:43:55] speak the name of Jesus thou Lord over
[1:43:58] all creation I have a need have mercy on
[1:44:03] me yes
[1:44:06] amen Prophet said he stopped the so n in
[1:44:10] his
[1:44:11] tracks with the same kind of faith that
[1:44:15] Joshua
[1:44:17] had now just form all these things in
[1:44:20] your heart that we've been talking
[1:44:22] about time is not a real
[1:44:29] thing time shall be no more Hallelujah I
[1:44:33] got quotes to back it
[1:44:36] up now for a few more
[1:44:40] moments and a few
[1:44:42] more I I I want you to meditate on this
[1:44:45] now because we think of these parallels
[1:44:47] these
[1:44:48] paradoxes this is pertaining to you
[1:44:50] right Joshua blind
[1:44:53] bmus
[1:44:55] Moses Ephesians all of these things
[1:44:59] they're laying in there for
[1:45:01] you so much so that I like this the
[1:45:04] prophet of God would say in Christ The
[1:45:07] Mystery of God revealed he'd say the
[1:45:08] entire Bible
[1:45:10] Hallelujah is the revelation of God's
[1:45:12] mystery in
[1:45:13] Christ he says the entire Bible is an
[1:45:17] expression of one goal that God had
[1:45:19] that's right one purpose he wanted to
[1:45:22] achieve in the entire
[1:45:24] Bible now this part right here
[1:45:27] just Wows me and all the
[1:45:31] acts of the Believers in the Bible has
[1:45:34] been in
[1:45:36] type expressing what God's Great goal is
[1:45:38] and now in this last day he has revealed
[1:45:42] it and shows
[1:45:49] it everything you're looking in
[1:45:51] parallels paradoxes the
[1:45:56] Patriarchs the disciples all the acts of
[1:46:00] all the
[1:46:01] Believers
[1:46:03] everything remember he's the I am yes
[1:46:05] sir he's an I am present
[1:46:08] God don't don't be looking in the future
[1:46:10] and just look to what has been but what
[1:46:12] is he do he's the same yesterday today
[1:46:14] and forever if he does something one way
[1:46:17] if you can catch the inspiration of it
[1:46:19] if he does something one way he has to
[1:46:21] do it the same way every if he brought
[1:46:24] them out by a mighty hand then the Same
[1:46:27] Spirit the same Pillar of Fire is here
[1:46:31] to take you out of the
[1:46:41] chaos I love those quotes brother br
[1:46:43] will say at that day that that's this
[1:46:46] day you shall know that I am in the
[1:46:48] father and ye in me and I in you I've
[1:46:51] heard it a million times brother Matthew
[1:46:53] but I'm I have a hard time catching the
[1:46:57] inspiration catching the
[1:46:58] Revelation well it's it's a
[1:47:01] paradox it's something that's incredible
[1:47:03] but it's true and by faith you can walk
[1:47:07] right into the promises of
[1:47:11] God look you are not
[1:47:15] alone you are not
[1:47:19] alone
[1:47:21] this is not you vers the
[1:47:24] world this is not how you can figure
[1:47:27] your way out of your
[1:47:29] problems he didn't lead the children of
[1:47:31] Israel out of Egypt and and there to the
[1:47:34] Red Sea with their back against the Red
[1:47:35] Sea and saying now figure this one out
[1:47:38] Moses Moses responsibility was to wait
[1:47:41] upon the Lord he said be still and know
[1:47:46] that I am
[1:47:47] God maybe if the voice of God speak to
[1:47:50] one of you this morning be
[1:47:52] still be still and
[1:47:55] no this ain't your
[1:47:58] problem this is my problem I said I
[1:48:01] would be an enemy to your enemies that I
[1:48:04] would be an adversary to your adversary

[1:48:09] same God that was with Joshua yes

[1:52:40] wilderness the same Pillar of Fire that
[1:52:42] come down on the Ohio River in
[1:52:44] 1933 it said as John the Baptist foran
[1:52:47] the first coming of Christ so shall your
[1:52:50] ministry forun the second coming of
[1:52:51] Jesus
[1:52:54] Christ brother R would preach Christ The
[1:52:56] Mystery of God revealed I believe it
[1:53:00] is it's how you are
[1:53:02] spiritual look back at the
[1:53:05] clock it's 2 o00 on the
[1:53:11] dot what is he talking
[1:53:13] about it was 2 o00 on the Ohio
[1:53:17] River 1933
[1:53:21] as John the Baptist forrun the first
[1:53:23] coming of Jesus Christ so shall your
[1:53:25] ministry forrun the second coming of
[1:53:27] Jesus
[1:53:29] Christ he's saying here he is Behold the
[1:53:32] Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
[1:53:35] the world the I am is
[1:53:42] here that's a promise he's given to
[1:53:46] you David would say teach me thy way oh
[1:53:49] Lord
[1:53:52] lead me in a plain path because of mine
[1:53:55] enemies he would say in Psalms Thy word
[1:53:58] is a lamp unto my
[1:54:00] feet and a light unto my
[1:54:03] path the devil's always wanting you to
[1:54:06] reason with the
[1:54:09] word always wanting to try to make you
[1:54:14] doubt lead me in a plain
[1:54:17] path the word is your path
[1:54:20] the word is your
[1:54:21] light you know your life has a
[1:54:23] predestinated
[1:54:27] path the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:54:29] ordered by the Lord I know the scripture
[1:54:30] says the footsteps of a good man but my
[1:54:32] Prophet said righteous over and over
[1:54:35] footsteps of righteous are order of the
[1:54:39] Lord look the there there's a
[1:54:42] rest I'm going try by God's grace we'll
[1:54:44] try to come to a close here and speak of
[1:54:46] this but there is a rest for the people
[1:54:49] of God
[1:54:52] hallu and our Joshua the Holy
[1:54:55] Spirit the person of the word is here
[1:54:58] present amongst us to take you into that
[1:55:04] rest where you can live in his presence
[1:55:07] now that's a
[1:55:09] paradox I'm sorry it's a
[1:55:11] paradox I it can't be made any more
[1:55:14] plain than it's already been made
[1:55:15] there's no more Mysteries it's all been
[1:55:18] revealed
[1:55:20] the the mercy seats in plain
[1:55:23] view it's it's not a mystery
[1:55:26] right but it's a
[1:55:30] paradox and a paradox is something
[1:55:32] that's incredible but true and we walk
[1:55:35] by
[1:55:37] faith not by sight and so just in and
[1:55:41] moving towards a close here just using
[1:55:43] the children of Israel as that parallel
[1:55:46] if you if you look at the children of
[1:55:47] Israel they had a provided way they had
[1:55:51] a provided
[1:55:54] path but how many of them failed to
[1:55:57] enter into that
[1:56:00] rest think of it now now for a few
[1:56:03] moments we just want to have a little
[1:56:07] sobriety the prophet of God would say in
[1:56:09] in Paradox 65 and paragraph 79 he says
[1:56:13] now if we notice then their journey in
[1:56:14] the wilderness is where they got their
[1:56:17] greatest mistake that Israel ever made
[1:56:18] until Calvary
[1:56:20] was when in Exodus 19 they accepted law
[1:56:23] instead of
[1:56:24] Grace now you can go read the whole
[1:56:27] chapter of uh of Exodus 19 and it might
[1:56:31] be a very challenging thing to find
[1:56:34] where they made their mistake but it
[1:56:37] would take a prophet of
[1:56:39] God to be able to take that
[1:56:44] connection and preach a message the
[1:56:46] church choosing law for Grace and what
[1:56:49] was their greatest mistake you read
[1:56:52] through it and and God speaks to Moses
[1:56:57] and comes to them and says and gives
[1:57:00] them the word of the Lord say thou if
[1:57:02] you do all these things and the children
[1:57:05] of say all that thou has said that we
[1:57:07] will
[1:57:08] do they missed
[1:57:11] something you stiff neck
[1:57:15] people with all the murmuring and
[1:57:18] complaining and y'all you y'all are
[1:57:20] going to fulfill the word it took a
[1:57:22] prophet to say that's where they made
[1:57:24] their greatest mistake is when they say
[1:57:26] we will do all that the word says He
[1:57:28] says they chose
[1:57:30] law over Grace they said there's
[1:57:33] something we can do in it
[1:57:36] now it sounded pretty good to
[1:57:40] me but it took a prophet to say it
[1:57:42] should have been oh Lord all that thou
[1:57:44] said if it'll be by your grace Lord in
[1:57:47] myself I'm weak Lord there's no way that
[1:57:49] I can fulfill this word there's no way I
[1:57:52] can F this fulfill this message Lord but
[1:57:54] if it would be you by your grace the
[1:57:56] same Grace that provided us a lamb the
[1:57:58] same Grace that provided us a prophet
[1:58:00] the same Grace that took us out of Egypt
[1:58:02] the same Grace that gave us water the
[1:58:04] same Grace that gave us Mana that same
[1:58:07] Grace if it would be that Grace Lord
[1:58:09] then I can do all that thou has spoken
[1:58:11] but Lord don't give me law give me
[1:58:18] Grace
[1:58:19] they accepted law instead of Grace he
[1:58:21] said they had Grace they had a prophet
[1:58:24] they had a sacrificial lamb they had
[1:58:26] Redemption they had been brought through
[1:58:28] the Red Sea they had been healed of
[1:58:30] their diseases they had water from the
[1:58:32] smitten
[1:58:35] Rock now brother brandom's not given a
[1:58:38] history lesson
[1:58:40] here he's talking to
[1:58:43] me he's talking to me saying son you see
[1:58:47] what they
[1:58:48] did take take heed
[1:58:51] son take
[1:58:53] heed that it's not you trying to fulfill
[1:58:56] my
[1:58:58] word cuz if it's you you're choosing
[1:59:03] Law stay with me for a few more
[1:59:06] moments they had a smid rock they had
[1:59:08] Man Out Of Heaven everything they had
[1:59:10] need of had been supplied and still they
[1:59:14] wanted something
[1:59:18] else do not chalk this off to something
[1:59:22] in a day gone by this is the Living Word
[1:59:25] which is a reality a discerner of the
[1:59:28] thoughts and intents of the heart we go
[1:59:30] have an experience and we get all
[1:59:32] whooped up and we and it's good I ain't
[1:59:34] saying it's wrong I've been there man
[1:59:36] I've been set free and got wings of an
[1:59:38] eagle I'm just soaring around with so
[1:59:39] much
[1:59:40] Zeal and all those older eagles with
[1:59:42] wisdom are looking I look at that poor
[1:59:44] little
[1:59:45] fellow thinks he's done
[1:59:48] something
[1:59:49] think I can go out there on All My Own
[1:59:51] Strength few storms come and blow you
[1:59:54] down you realize okay I thought I could
[1:59:57] fly Lord it was your grace that put me
[1:59:59] up there in the first
[2:00:00] place Amen brother random tells a story
[2:00:04] about how some man he he had all of his
[2:00:06] notes and he had everything packed
[2:00:08] together real well and he he come up man
[2:00:10] he had just the word of the Lord and he
[2:00:12] come up and he presented it really well
[2:00:14] to them simple Pentecostal people and
[2:00:16] man he was just up there and he was
[2:00:18] framing all the words and tying all the
[2:00:19] quotes together and my he just had it
[2:00:22] right down but he he realized them
[2:00:23] simple Holy Ghost filled uh folks
[2:00:25] weren't having
[2:00:27] it shut up his books and his notes and
[2:00:31] put his head down and started to walk
[2:00:33] out the back door and one of the old
[2:00:34] Saints looked over and said you
[2:00:36] know if he' had went up the way he come
[2:00:39] down it have been
[2:00:44] different
[2:00:46] yeah sincerity if you're going to speak
[2:00:50] to the mountain if you're going to speak
[2:00:52] to the storm you must be more
[2:00:56] sincere Ephesians does parallel
[2:00:59] Joshua you are doing the Greater
[2:01:02] Works and we shall do more we must be
[2:01:05] more
[2:01:06] sincere now that's a perfect type of our
[2:01:09] Ephesians
[2:01:10] today we'll try to close
[2:01:14] quickly now that's a perfect type of our
[2:01:16] Ephesians today exactly we come out
[2:01:18] under Luther
[2:01:19] we went through sanctification under the
[2:01:21] methodists and came into the restoration
[2:01:23] under Pentecost exactly like it was the
[2:01:25] Wilderness journey and when God brought
[2:01:28] us out we did everything well but what
[2:01:30] did we do we wanted to be like the rest
[2:01:31] of them now we find out that Grace is
[2:01:34] the only thing that takes us through
[2:01:37] never the law they wanted something that
[2:01:40] they could do they wanted some type of
[2:01:41] Sabbath they wanted some type of
[2:01:44] ordinance Prophet said if there's one
[2:01:46] thing that you could have done to save
[2:01:48] yourself then not one spec of its
[2:01:51] Grace Prophet goes on to say Joshua here
[2:01:54] is a type of the last day Ministry see
[2:01:59] now remember those three stages of the
[2:02:01] journey all of it ceased first the law
[2:02:04] and everything had to cease and Joshua
[2:02:07] is the same word as Jesus Jehovah savior
[2:02:10] that took them from their Wilderness
[2:02:12] into their Promised
[2:02:15] Land I'm so thankful to be walking with
[2:02:17] him
[2:02:20] it ain't I that liveth but it's Christ
[2:02:22] that liveth with me I want to ask you
[2:02:24] what more do you
[2:02:25] want that's what he said what more do
[2:02:27] you
[2:02:28] want our Joshua our Christ the revealed
[2:02:32] word of the hour is here to take you
[2:02:36] through what more do you
[2:02:38] want which one of you can add one cubit
[2:02:41] to your
[2:02:43] stature if we're not careful we want
[2:02:46] something we can do right
[2:02:49] but we are what we are by the grace of
[2:02:52] God not one of us can add one cubit to
[2:02:55] our statue I was just thinking about
[2:02:58] having a little fellowship with brother
[2:02:59] Dar and we we were we're talking about
[2:03:01] uh uh uh 1 Corinthians 13 where and I I
[2:03:05] just was thinking about Paul how he
[2:03:07] comes through and says look you you can
[2:03:08] you can know all the
[2:03:11] Mysteries you you you can give your body
[2:03:14] to be burned you can feed the poor you
[2:03:17] you can prophesy you can speak in
[2:03:20] tongues you can do all these things you
[2:03:23] could know all the
[2:03:25] Mysteries but if you don't have
[2:03:28] charity it just struck my heart it was a
[2:03:30] perfect a perfect type well let me
[2:03:33] rephrase that I don't want to say that
[2:03:34] but I I saw a wonderful picture of the
[2:03:36] church
[2:03:39] ages of how God building up all through
[2:03:42] the church ages God building up God
[2:03:45] adding Here Comes justification
[2:03:47] justification was good we needed
[2:03:49] justification a sanctification was good
[2:03:52] we had to be Sanctified the restoration
[2:03:54] of the gifts was
[2:03:58] good that's all wonderful that's all
[2:04:00] part of it but what is Charity charity
[2:04:03] is love it's the Capstone what good does
[2:04:06] it do us if we have all of that and we
[2:04:08] don't have him
[2:04:12] right oh it's Christ coming down living
[2:04:16] amongst us few more moments brother
[2:04:18] brandom says in the Paradox he says so
[2:04:20] there was Joshua representing
[2:04:23] Grace was right along with law but could
[2:04:26] not be enforced as long as law was in
[2:04:28] its proper place and so has the
[2:04:31] church World in this day it's come along
[2:04:35] it's played its part but there is coming
[2:04:36] a time where it must cease it must do it
[2:04:39] there has got to be an Ephesians of this
[2:04:42] journey and just as there was of those
[2:04:45] Journeys there has to come an Ephesians
[2:04:47] and Ephesus and Ephesians of this
[2:04:50] journey where are we
[2:04:53] at where are we
[2:04:55] at we are not we are in our Ephesians
[2:04:58] not a not an Ephesian Church
[2:05:02] age but Christ himself the
[2:05:05] restoration that was the purpose of
[2:05:07] Malachi 4:5 was to restore us back to
[2:05:09] the original
[2:05:11] Faith where the same God that was in
[2:05:15] Christ Jesus was poured out into the
[2:05:19] church and it was no more you that was
[2:05:22] living but it's Christ in you that's
[2:05:25] living Christ coming down to perform the
[2:05:28] work I'll just invite the
[2:05:30] musicians Paul would say in Ephesians
[2:05:32] 2:10 for we are his workmanship created
[2:05:34] in Christ Jesus under good
[2:05:36] works which God hath before ordained
[2:05:39] that we should walk in
[2:05:43] them part of the problem is we don't
[2:05:45] know what we
[2:05:47] have
[2:05:49] we don't even really know what we've
[2:05:51] we've we've sunk our teeth
[2:05:56] into I was thinking about that a little
[2:05:58] bit you
[2:05:59] know just give me a few minutes sister
[2:06:01] sorry I won't be too
[2:06:05] long I was thinking about that a little
[2:06:07] bit how you ever seen a baby pick up a
[2:06:11] pair of scissors or a knife or something
[2:06:13] all of a sudden somehow they got
[2:06:15] somewhere and they picked up something
[2:06:16] they shouldn't have that baby's just
[2:06:18] like look at me I'm so cute and
[2:06:20] everybody's
[2:06:24] like like whoa because that
[2:06:26] baby doesn't understand what it's
[2:06:35] holding it doesn't know what it's
[2:06:36] capable of with that right doesn't even
[2:06:39] know how to use it
[2:06:42] right you know that's how the devil
[2:06:44] looks at
[2:06:46] you like boy they got the message
[2:06:48] they're packing the
[2:06:50] message he's over there
[2:06:54] going he's like guys we got to we got to
[2:06:57] keep them from recognizing who they
[2:06:59] are if I can just keep the bride from
[2:07:02] recognizing who they really are in
[2:07:05] Christ she'll never raise up into her
[2:07:07] position of what she really
[2:07:09] is on come
[2:07:12] on it reminds me of it reminds me of
[2:07:15] Joshua right when he he he he went in to
[2:07:17] conquer Canaan
[2:07:19] what do you say hey man kill them all I
[2:07:22] don't care how cute that baby
[2:07:24] looks that little baby that little Amite
[2:07:28] it'll grow up into a big
[2:07:30] Amite I think that's some of our
[2:07:32] problems we're just petting little
[2:07:33] babies of the world we think they're
[2:07:34] okay oh it's just so cute and
[2:07:38] innocent it's just a Love Me Jesus
[2:07:41] song yeah go go look at your love me
[2:07:43] Jesus song and the people singing
[2:07:45] it you want to identify with that
[2:07:53] I heard a song and so I thought you know
[2:07:56] hey I'll I typed in the
[2:07:58] words and the most
[2:08:00] provocative album cover I I couldn't
[2:08:03] even imagine and I realized why my skin
[2:08:06] was crawling when I was hearing it oh
[2:08:07] sounded
[2:08:09] great you think that stuff's there to
[2:08:11] draw you closer to Christ or to give you
[2:08:13] a taste of the
[2:08:16] world yeah I got a good dose of that
[2:08:18] years ago about 20 something years ago I
[2:08:21] borrowed a car and uh you know I mean
[2:08:26] I'm not saying there was anything wrong
[2:08:27] with the song but God just allowed it to
[2:08:29] get my attention um and it was some
[2:08:33] believers they put together a song it
[2:08:34] kind of had uh um well I didn't even
[2:08:37] know it I pulled up to pick somebody up
[2:08:38] and I turned the car off and when you
[2:08:40] turn the car back on the CD would
[2:08:41] automatically start playing and it was
[2:08:44] it was a good Christian family but this
[2:08:46] was just gave me some perspective and so
[2:08:47] the CD came in on and always ready
[2:08:49] playing and and I went to pick up a a
[2:08:52] friend of mine son and he came up and
[2:08:53] opened up the door and he got in goes I
[2:08:55] didn't know you listen to country
[2:08:57] music I I well I was like well that
[2:09:00] would I wouldn't listen to that but
[2:09:01] that's that's actually it was food for
[2:09:04] thought
[2:09:06] though some of that stuff we listen to I
[2:09:08] don't know why we got over here but some
[2:09:09] of that stuff we listen to sounds just
[2:09:11] the same as the world but I say oh God I
[2:09:14] want to be sincere I want to be
[2:09:16] sober well just start playing and that's
[2:09:18] usually how this goes to make me wind
[2:09:24] down the devil's trying to keep you from
[2:09:27] believing in who you
[2:09:30] are I I want to Anchor this
[2:09:33] down brother random says now that that's
[2:09:36] where people think today of Divine
[2:09:38] Healing or some any other work of grace
[2:09:42] of God that there is something that you
[2:09:44] have to
[2:09:45] do there is nothing you have to do but
[2:09:49] believe just believe
[2:09:52] God and if they would have just
[2:09:54] continued on the promise wasn't given
[2:09:58] them under the law the promise was given
[2:10:00] before the law without any condition of
[2:10:03] it I have given you this land go on over
[2:10:07] into it but before they got to that
[2:10:10] promise they decided there was something
[2:10:12] they must do
[2:10:15] themselves and we still find that among
[2:10:18] human beings we're prone to be that way
[2:10:21] there is something we've got to do we
[2:10:23] feel that we've we've got to have
[2:10:25] something into it also you do have
[2:10:28] something into it that's your surrender
[2:10:32] of your own
[2:10:33] will your own ideas to the will and idea
[2:10:37] of almighty God and it's
[2:10:40] finished that's all there is just take
[2:10:42] his promise don't think of nothing else
[2:10:46] walk by it and God does the rest of
[2:10:52] it as I was with
[2:10:55] Moses so shall I also be with
[2:10:59] you just take his
[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:07] promise don't think anything else of it
[2:11:11] walk by
[2:11:13] it and God does the
[2:11:15] rest now maybe you feel like that man of
[2:11:18] Mark
[2:11:19] 9 where Jesus he brought his son he was
[2:11:22] all frolicking throwing hisself Into the
[2:11:24] Fire and the prophet would identify that
[2:11:26] was epilepsy and he he he comes to him
[2:11:28] said Lord I brought my son uh to the
[2:11:31] disciples you know they weren't able to
[2:11:33] deliver him he said oh you you faithless
[2:11:35] generation how long should I be with him
[2:11:37] bring him unto
[2:11:40] me bring him unto me I struck my heart
[2:11:43] he's still here he's still the same
[2:11:45] yesterday today bring your problems unto
[2:11:47] me
[2:11:49] bring them unto me I am here yes if thou
[2:11:54] can't believe all things are possible
[2:11:56] the father Cried Out said oh
[2:12:00] God I believe but help my
[2:12:05] [Music]
[2:12:07] unbelief if you believe why don't you
[2:12:10] just
[2:12:11] stand say Lord I
[2:12:15] believe I realize I've had mistakes I
[2:12:18] realize I've had
[2:12:23] failures we'll finish on this
[2:12:26] quote now I I just want to speak to
[2:12:28] somebody's heart really
[2:12:30] quick and I pray that you can pull out
[2:12:33] of this what the prophet is
[2:12:36] saying remember parallels and paradoxes
[2:12:40] footsteps of faith brother Brandon picks
[2:12:43] up the St story of Jonah it says many
[2:12:46] people think that Jonah was a terrible
[2:12:48] person Jonah was a prophet of the Lord
[2:12:51] walking in all the will of the Lord you
[2:12:53] say why did he do that he never done
[2:12:55] anything contrary to God's will now this
[2:12:58] is a paradox to
[2:12:59] me you can't if you are in Christ do
[2:13:03] anything
[2:13:04] contrary if you're walking humbly and
[2:13:07] upright it may seem like you
[2:13:09] do but you don't do it
[2:13:12] now don't you realize this is Grace
[2:13:16] speaking
[2:13:18] nothing happens
[2:13:20] providential
[2:13:23] nothing the footsteps of the righteous
[2:13:26] man is order of the Lord and all things
[2:13:30] work together for the good to them that
[2:13:32] love him how can you take those
[2:13:35] scriptures and compare them with any
[2:13:37] other and break them the scriptures
[2:13:40] cannot be
[2:13:41] broken I end on
[2:13:44] this Jonah looked like a backslidden
[2:13:47] prophet
[2:13:50] looked like he was out of the will of
[2:13:53] God looked like he sharked his
[2:13:56] responsibility and his
[2:13:59] duty and what looked like his mistake
[2:14:02] and his
[2:14:03] failure the Lord Jesus would stand
[2:14:07] there and say there will be no sign
[2:14:09] given
[2:14:12] you save the sign of
[2:14:16] Jonah what if I could say in my heart
[2:14:18] there's perfection in Redemption amen
[2:14:22] that God could stand here and look at
[2:14:24] the
[2:14:25] bride what you think is mistakes and
[2:14:28] failures what you think is you messing
[2:14:31] everything else is God saying in your
[2:14:34] Ephesians and you hath he quickened who
[2:14:37] were dead in sins and
[2:14:42] trespasses this message is the grace of
[2:14:44] God to you everywhere The Souls of your
[2:14:47] feet go it's possession footsteps is
[2:14:52] possession that's the same thing today
[2:14:54] Divine Healing belongs to us the Holy
[2:14:56] Spirit belongs to us it's our property
[2:14:59] but you'll fight every inch of it but
[2:15:01] brother footsteps is possession just
[2:15:05] keep fighting take it the devil says the
[2:15:08] days of Miracles has passed you say
[2:15:10] you're a liar Jesus Christ is the same
[2:15:14] yesterday today and forever take it over
[2:15:17] he everywhere your
[2:15:20] footsteps that's possession Heavenly
[2:15:23] Father we approach

[2:15:40] Christ it's in that name that we
[2:15:42] approach
[2:15:45] you Lord we've

[2:16:20] have troubles and lose a victory but all
[2:16:24] of that Lord was just
[2:16:26] parallels and types of you speaking to

[2:31:25] [Music]
[2:31:28] the all
[2:31:36] the
[2:31:38] Hallelujah I trust the word is spoken to
[2:31:41] you this morning is the god of parallel
[2:31:44] and of
[2:31:45] paradoxes I just want to just say that
[2:31:48] for a moment when you see the parallel
[2:31:51] don't forget the
[2:31:53] Paradox many people see the parallel but
[2:31:56] they run without the
[2:31:59] Paradox the whole Bible is built on
[2:32:02] Parallel and
[2:32:03] paradoxes many churches may see the
[2:32:06] parallel well it said he will do this
[2:32:08] he'll do it again but don't forget the
[2:32:10] Paradox the Paradox is the manner by
[2:32:13] which he chooses to do it the parado ask
[2:32:16] is how am I going to move from here and
[2:32:18] get over there I don't understand the
[2:32:21] parallel shows me that it exists I'll
[2:32:24] just take the parallel and wait upon the
[2:32:26] Paradox to take me
[2:32:29] there how do I receive the Holy Ghost he
[2:32:33] said just believe I'll believe I'll walk
[2:32:36] like it I'll do what I know I'm going to
[2:32:38] wait until the Paradox takes me from
[2:32:41] what I am and changes me don't run
[2:32:44] without the paradox let I'll tell you
[2:32:47] this we didn't make ourselves see the
[2:32:49] parallel he he laid it down in the
[2:32:52] scriptures he said if I did one thing
[2:32:54] one time I'll do it again if I healed
[2:32:57] one time I'll heal again God has never
[2:32:59] done one thing and not do it again every
[2:33:02] time he does it it's it's based on the
[2:33:05] parallel so his believing children will
[2:33:07] be able to see that he the same
[2:33:09] yesterday today and forever but in that
[2:33:12] the Paradox is he makes it happen not
[2:33:16] you but he makes it happen that's right
[2:33:19] oh I want to come this morning oh like
[2:33:22] the woman with the blood issue and say
[2:33:25] father I'm here I've had this issue
[2:33:27] that's bothered me for years I don't
[2:33:29] know what to do about it but I know in
[2:33:31] the scripture there was a woman who came
[2:33:33] and attached the Hem of your garment and
[2:33:35] she was completely healed I don't know
[2:33:38] how you did it but all I know is if I
[2:33:40] can touch your word if I can touch what
[2:33:43] you spoken the same God who brought the
[2:33:46] same Paradox by the same parallel he
[2:33:49] will heal me
[2:33:52] too don't run without the Paradox let
[2:33:56] the parallel Let The God Who made the
[2:33:58] parallel come and take the Paradox into
[2:34:00] your
[2:34:02] life make it a reality to me take my
[2:34:06] life I I'm struggling I don't understand
[2:34:08] where I am I don't understand what's
[2:34:10] happening but I know that you do things
[2:34:13] your way you do things the way that
[2:34:16] nobody else can you you the one who
[2:34:18] washed me from all uncleanness I'm in
[2:34:20] the church today I'm hearing what I'm
[2:34:23] hearing because you made me what I am
[2:34:25] but now I'm praying that you can take me
[2:34:27] here I didn't put the desire to be right
[2:34:30] in my own heart I didn't choose to be a
[2:34:32] Christian I didn't choose to serve you
[2:34:34] you chose me to serve you I see the
[2:34:37] parallel that you have in your Bible I'm
[2:34:39] coming so the Paradox can happen in my
[2:34:43] life Hall he's the god of
[2:34:46] paradoxes he does things only the way he
[2:34:49] can do that's our heart's desire and if
[2:34:52] you need prayer just come Alber will'll
[2:34:54] pray for you I don't know about you I
[2:34:56] need a paradox this morning for all the
[2:34:59] types that I've seen in the Bible for
[2:35:01] all the types that I'm reading it I need
[2:35:03] the god of paradox to take that this
[2:35:05] morning and bring it into a reality amen
[2:35:09] just give me the key of see let's sing
[2:35:10] that D let's try it inde D let's sing
