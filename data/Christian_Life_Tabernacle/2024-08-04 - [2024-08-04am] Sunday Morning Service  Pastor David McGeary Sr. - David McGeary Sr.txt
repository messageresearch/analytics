that you bought with the precious blood that we're singing about this morning Lord and we have a grave that tells us that you've won that Victory the wages of sin was death and you overcame the wages of sin and you promised that you'd send your spirit back upon the believer father we're here this morning to receive that spirit in the precious and wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you this morning I was afraid that brother Billy was going to introduce me as a visiting Minister but uh we're happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning and Trust the Lord's his Blessing have something on our heart if you have your Bibles let's turn this morning thank you musicians for playing and and all the effort that you put in U I think they announced the youth meeting coming up uh let's really put our shoulder to the uh wheel uh for that if you can host somebody or donate something time or or or or something we uh certainly uh put out a a sacrifice and I'll guarantee you God promised you'll be rewarded a h hundredfold in this life and the life to come amen that's a pretty good deal amen so you can out serve God you can out give God he he's he's just he's full of goodness and and care for you so we're going to turn in our Bible to first of all to Romans the 12th chapter and and uh read a very familiar verse in Romans 12 uh I think I have it right here maybe not I thought it was Romans 12 and 2 I I must have wrote it down wrong but I'll maybe I'll just have to let me see if I can I'll I'll I'll read it from my book here and then uh we'll do that and our second scripture is going to be in second Timothy the uh and uh and so it says this is the scripture we'd like to read it says I beseech ye therefore Brethren by the mercy of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and accept able to God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and perfect and good acceptable and perfect will of God that we might prove what the will of God is and let's turn over to Timothy second Timothy and uh and we want to read in the uh first chapter of the second Timothy starting with the fifth verse it says when I call to remembrance the unfringed faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother units and I am persuaded that in thee also wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou should stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and love and of a sound mind amen gracious Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated this morning we certainly uh uh appreciate all your prayers uh uh uh for uh my family and uh my mother is uh uh you know my mother's kind of in the final uh stages of her time here on Earth and God's given her a great and wonderful Journey she's uh uh 102 years old and and I I I read the other day where there's a a lady in the United States that's 115 years old and uh um uh you know I I don't I I hope I I don't know what God has for me but I I want to go home is anybody feel like that amen I I've just about had all of this world I can take uh lesli's been so faithful her and Sharon out there taking care of my mother and and uh I just felt led to come home uh you know uh Timothy makes this statement Paul to Timothy makes this statement he says he says for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but uh uh but of power and of love and of a sound mind we want to talk a little bit about that this morning with you um it was kind of this thought was brought to me kind of of what uh I was experiencing uh with my mother and as she is struggling uh through the end of her journey uh you know uh for many years she could walk around the house and and cook her own meals and take care of herself but now she's come to that time where she's bedridden and uh my mother was um a Catholic I was raised a Catholic I'm sure um many of those of us that uh have Hispanic background uh are very much know about the Catholic church and uh and what I come to realize is uh just a bondage is really what it is and and so as my mother realizing that she's coming to this time I begin to see uh the thought proc that that was in her and how she was uh facing death and how she was facing what lied in front of her and and a lot of of how you approach things comes from what's in your heart and and so I realized that as my mother uh went there that I saw the separation that God had given me by his mercy and his grace from the Catholic church and from what it is that they believe and how it is that they approach God and and I think our approach to the Lord means so very much I mean approach is everything if you if you don't approach somebody a right way you might have a good intention but your very approach destroys everything that you intended to happen and and you know I've always had difficulty in my life making a a good first impression you know uh part of that is is because I like to kind of kid a little I'm Irish you know our background is we like to say a joke or two or just have a kind of a a friendly thing you know and and I like to give people nicknames you know what I mean if a guy's 10 feet tall I'll call him shorty you know what I mean if a guy's great big I'll call him tiny well you know sometimes you walk up and you say how you doing tiny and they didn't take it the way you meant it and now you you now you're back pad backpedaling and the more you try to fix it the worse it gets you know you finally realize you just want to walk away you lost this one and you hope you learn the lesson and so that's the way it is it's the approach you know maybe if it we take a little bit of time to think through our approach and and to think through our attitude to think through our atmosphere just to take control of our thoughts and ourselves and and gain composure of ourselves and and our approach uh it would go a long ways in our lives of of of how that uh we achieve what we're trying to accomplish and we're trying to accomplish something here this morning we're trying to accomplish the Kingdom of Heaven we're trying to accomplish if I could say this a position in the Rapture and and we don't take the approach that it's just uh it's going to happen uh because it's going to happen that's not our attitude amen our attitude is one of appreciation that we become subject to the word of God we don't take Grace and and make it a disgrace and we don't take predestination and and take our part of living right and so we don't do evil that Grace May abound God forbid but we recognize that we have a role to play and that we have a testimony and that we're to put our light on the hill and not cover it with a bushel basket and and that through good works that our father Father in Heaven might be glorified so we don't take oursel out of the out out of the equation we don't sit back and say it's all in God's hands and I don't have nothing to do if I'm saved I'm saved well that that's fine that that's a human attitude but if you really have received the gift of Salvation you want to do everything you can for him and for the men and women in the your world that you live in you want to spread spread the good news you want to tell them about the victory you want to tell them about the Deliverance you want to tell them what it meant to to to be free and to be saved and can and they can look at you they can tell a lot of times people know you and they see the difference they know there's something about you and you know it's not you you know it's him and it's just his grace and its Mercy but you want to let them know that's there for you too no matter how dark you are how uh deep in sin you are no matter how scarred your life is no matter what's been done wrong to you there's one that is greater than all those things and that's the love of God and and a lot of people have had a hard life a lot of people didn't get a fair shake a lot of children have been abused a lot of families there's a lot of abused uh uh women and and things in this world but let me tell you something God will make it all right on the other side amen he'll have a reward that the sufferings of this world is not worthy to be compared to amen you don't want to miss it you do not want to miss what God's got prepared for them that love them because of this little temporary world that's that's full of tiny little daily Pleasures that don't amount to anything the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus you don't want to sell yourself short you want to get involved you want to be a part of it you want to let that light shine amen you want to polish your life and clean it up and so back to what I begin to realize is that as my mom approached it that Catholic thinking begin to take hold of her and and she wanted to make sure that everything was right and so and and I this the distance between what that faith and and I'll just be honest with you I I think the Catholic church is a great Harlot you know I I'm not here to uh you say it's hate crime I'm not talking about the people I'm talking about the thought process the theology the B The Binding of the minds of the people with their teaching and what Grace it keeps them from being able to participate in from by what they've been taught and they're bound with fear and so my mom's coming to this time in her life and she want to make sure that all of her sins that she's paid for all of her sins because they believe there's a place you go called Purgatory now I know you being Christians you might not realize this but there's things they believe they believe that that that little wafer that they take that that's the literal body of Jesus not a remembrance not a symbol but it actually is his very flesh and that that wine is his very blood they believe in praying to Saints and to people yet the word of God says there's one mediator between God and man and that's the Lord Jesus Christ but yet they've got a saint for this and a saint for that they got a saint for travel a saint for Carpenters a saint for this a somebody that'll make intercession and and they got all these people they're trying to pray through their whole life is spent on trying to get right and so they come to this great hour and and she and and they believe in this Purgatory so they believe that there's certain sins that take you to hell and those are real bad sins and there's other sins that you'll have to pay for in purgatory so she's she's she's realizing that she's on her way to purgatory and I thought Lord God there's a cross that paid the price for my sins there's a blood that standing there that says father I paid for his sins I took the chastisement of his peace upon me and by my stripes he's healed not only physically but spiritually Hallelujah and so now she's fixing to go to this great place of purgatory well so they and and to put them in bondage they believe if they do certain certain works here on Earth it attributes to so much credits out of purgatory so maybe you've done a few bad things in your life so they believe if you've done these things you've got so much time you have to spend in purgatory to pay for that I thought my goodness the bondage the bondage I mean what what happened you know to he who is free is free indeed what happened to the freedom that comes when a sinner confessed his sins and they've been thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no no more she's sitting there thinking that those sins haven't been remitted they haven't been forgiven they haven't been thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness that she's got to go forward and pay for him and here she is suffering and if you move her her she's in agony and when we lift her out of the bed to carry her she she just trembles and moans with pain and and I think why take take take some medicine my you know just tyen all and she says no I'm offering up my pain for my sins and her caregiver was raised by nuns a Catholic friend of her and she says yes she says one hour of suffering is worth a hundred years out of purgatory and she's sitting there suffering to pay for sins that have already been paid for she's remembering every little thing that she can think of when it's all been forgotten and I looked at that terrible bondage and I looked at what motivates her and what what is driving her and what is holding her and and I I see this grip everywhere and it's fear fear is is what does it the a afraid of of what's forward and so I begin to think about those things and I begin to think about the Liberty that's been given us in Christ Jesus I just like to to stir up your your pure Minds this morning by way of remembrance and and because uh you know what the word says we are is what we're supposed to be you understand that what the word says we are is is what we're supposed to be and and and so that's that's just something that that is good he says that's the transforming power of God that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it God's transforming power now just think about that's the god that we serve that can take something that's nothing and make something out of it amen so that's what he can do so what he says you are is what you are to be and then he can transform that into what it was that he had in his mind he he speaks of it this way he says he says therefore he created by his word he sent his word so all the seeds that had had a place upon the Earth he formed those seeds by his own word for there was there was no nothing else to make the seed out of he had placed them and they were beneath the water and he just said let there be this and let there be that so understand that we're created beings by the word of God the very fact that that we have life shows us that there had to be a life to make a life that's right life didn't come from nothing it wasn't two Adams floating around the sky that happen to bang in to one another sometimes man is so smart he he's just plain ignorant like had to come from someplace your personality your being what that you are it had to come from some place and and that place was the word of God you might look and say well I have a mother and I have a father but but you're not them exactly you know my boys didn't get my good looks they didn't get my intelligence you know they're start starting to get my hair no they got their mother's looks and their mother's intelligence so you're not exactly what your parents are but you are exactly what he wanted you to be he's still in control I don't care what pictures drawn I don't care what this lying world says I don't care what this civilization says this education says this science says God's word still rules it's the way God said it it's the way he intended it to be every seed that he put there he had an intention of that seed to be what he said it would be and he put the power in that seed to transform itself you believe that he said he said because the great Creator had just sent forth his word and the word seed was there before the real seed ever was formed just think of that so in other words we are what the word says that we are that that doesn't change now we have not come to that yet because it's the what you are is within you and let's put it this way it's it's in the state of growth none of us became perfect Christians the first day we became Christians when I gave my heart to the Lord you know I thought well all my troubles are over and come to find out they just began right I thought I just thought everybody was going to embrace what I had it was so good I felt so free but you know I still had all my long curly hair and and I I still wore my hippie clothes and all my albums were still in my house and and everything was there my nature had changed but I had to be weaned off all those things they had they had to be cut away from me I had to make a sacrifice I had to come to the day that I said I'm not going to play this music no more I would come under conviction and and the the word of God would would put me into a place and and I realized I can't take this path and carry this with me amen this won't fit through the eye of the needle amen it won't make it the the Way's narrow if I'm going to go this way and it kept getting narrower and narrower and narrower till there's a time where there's only one thing that can go down that road and that's the unadulterated word of God but you went through that process and some of us we still in that process there's still things that God wants to change us change our heart change our attitude change our mind there's still things he wants to do for us and you it's it's not it's not just a one time experience and a a one time oh I've accepted him from Christ I'm saved no no you've been you've been impregnated you've been germinated now you've got to grow into the image of Christ Jesus praise God he don't give up on us he'll take the clay and he'll completely tear it down and remold it again he'll mold you over and over again and you think it's all over and you think you finally got everything right and pretty soon you're back in The Moldy hands of the master and he's trying to change your attitude he's trying to change your thought he's trying to build the faith up in you but what did he do you know what he do he he gave us exceedingly great and precious promises and that they've been given to us to help us achieve the position we are to rise to another you're making this journey and what does he do he gives you the promises in his word that by these exceedingly great and precious promises you can become partakers of divine nature because what he planted in you was divine nature it just happened to be planted in a sinful body that we must bring under subjection and it's a constant Warfare for the flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these two are contrary one to another the battle's on it's on in you it's the real you really the intention that God had given you breaking through the Earth of this body so it can spring forth and bear the fruit of the seed that it was planted and intended to be so that's what he wants us to rise up to he's given us promises EX excuse me his promis promises we might obtain not by our own effort not by our own works not by our power and not by our might but by his Spirit saith the Lord and he gives you that Spirit by way of promise I promise you if you confess your sins I'll be faithful and righteous to forgive them I promise you that I promise you I'll not leave you nor forsake you I promise you if I start a work in you I will finish it till the end I promise you nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand I promise you I'll be with you even in you till the end I promise you that I'll come again and receive you that you may be where I am also I promise you these things and by these promises you can now rise up and Achieve if I could use that terminology or rise up to the position that he wants you in cuz he had an intention for your life and when you lose the understanding that you have a position and a place and a role to play something that God had intended for you to be to do and manifest that he had a nature and an attribute that he wanted to be manifested in you in the personality and the position and the body form that he gave you when you fail to see that you wrap yourself in religion and all you've got religion Doctrine Fellowship I believe this and I believe that but yet religion has no power to change to transform so he made us to be a people of Faith that's what God wants what are we we're a people that believe his word we're a people of Faith what's our greatest attribute it's Faith right that's what we are we're a people that believe God we believe that he is so that's the first thing he's not looking for religious ceremony he's not looking for theologians he wants you to believe him he wants you to believe what he said he would do for you he wants you to believe every promise every chapter every verse every line every word he wants you to know it's him and believe it that's what he's looking for well that's what we are you say why are we that because that's what he planted that's what he said we would be is Believers we call ourselves believers we believe that all things are possible through Christ Jesus we have got no limits we've got no barriers We've Got No Boundaries we've got no chains he's broken Every Chain we're free we're free to worship we're free to pray [Applause] we're free that we don't have to come in bondage to the flesh when Temptations rise up and try to draw us a aay we're not we we don't have to succumb to it because you feel it in your body because you feel it in your mind and it's got such a pull on you you can stand back and say wait a minute I'm free you're trying to tempt me you're trying to lie to me you're trying to draw me off I've been set free from that I'm free indeed who is free is free indeed he's my friend he called me friend he says because my friends know what I'm doing he's exposed the enemy the son of predition totally exposed what what magnitude of Christians ought to be on display in this body of Believers this morning who has heard the unadulterated word and recognize the visitation of the Lord Jesus Christ in the form of a pillar of fire veiled in a prophet think of it what is there that you can't do all things are possible that's the kind of people that we are we're a people that have word evidence yes think of it we have word evidence right is is isn't that what it is now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen our evidence isn't what we see our evidence is what he said that's our evidence because we're we're ruled by faith we're ruled by faith we're a people that that that the word is our evidence we're a people that rely on the supernatural we're we're not a religion we're a people from all languages all cultures all backgrounds all shapes all forms all colors he's got a people they're his people we're not just a church we're not a religion we're not quote unquote a message it was a message to a people and the people that were his people received his message and another they will not follow they know who their daddy is they're not hybrid they they know it's God's word they hear God's word my sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow they know what they're anchored to they've heard the eagle scream that scream awoken something inside of them and they begin to hear the precious words of God and the words of life and they didn't say oh that's nice they said that's me amen they looked in the mirror of God's word and said Mommy that's me I'll tell you when I first come to this message I just didn't hear this message I saw this message when he would speak I would look and I would see I was listening to only had a very few messages and I remember he spoke and he said you watch drive down the road Road that's somewhere around work time and there'll be a woman out there mowing her lawn in shorts oh I heard it but I'm driving home at that exact time and there's somebody mowing their lawn in shorts I didn't just hear it I saw it and that's why he said in this lady of see and age I counsel thee to buy of me Isa that thou might see that you're not just hearing this V you're seeing it you're seeing it in the corruption of the government you're seeing it the moral Decay you're seeing it in lady oia you're just let I I didn't see it but I've heard so much about it about this mockery of the last supper I guess it got so bad that even the pope had to say something pretty bad when the devil talks out against the devil they're just gossiping about one another trying to give a cover up but how many young minds did that scar how many seeds to that plant about the acceptance of the lady oia uh blind miserable poor wretched and naked and don't know it but I praise God that you know you're a people that's been given to know you're a people that he opens your eyes that you can see you're not deceived if you hear Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God so this this is what we are we're a people and I want to say that a people we're not a religion we're a people we're a predestinated tribe of Believers we are a culture and a society within ourselves we are shedding and separating from all the traditions of our parents and all the traditions of our upbringing and all the influences of our past and we're separating ourselves from all those things and we're bringing ourselves into total submission and a prisoner to God's word I hear a lot of people try to justify things that are and they're just traditions traditions of men and things and they say oh well it's in the scripture and and you know Jacob and and elaser and all that I said well how come you were doing that stuff a thousand years before you ever heard about elaser it's passed down and it gets in our thinking and our thinking has been marred because that's where the battle is it's in the mind and that's why the scripture says let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus and renew your mind by the washing of the water of the word so we're a supernatural people God made us that's what we are and he can he can transform us into that and I just want to read a statement if I could if you be with it then God said it's all good so I'll just rest and each one of those seeds that's you you're what he's planted you say well my mama and daddy it don't matter who your mommy and daddy are if God planted you you're going to come up that it settled listen to what he says he says each one of those seeds has the power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be you're a spey Believer you're not you're a a a unique Faith species of people that's separate and totally unique to this world I hope you think yourself like that we are in this world but we are not of this world you are all ilal aliens we're Ali aliens we're pilgrims we're strangers we're in a foreign land we don't speak their language we don't have their Customs we don't have their politics we don't have their Customs we don't have their culture we don't have their education now we might know what they know but what they know doesn't determine what we are or what we're going to do only the word determines what we are what we're going to do they might give us natural knowledge they might give us uh civilization skills but when it finally comes to that final determination of the believer his decision's going to be made on God's word not on the education he received he's going to do what's right he's gonna do what's just he's goingon to do what's fair he's going to do what's kind he's goingon to do what's merciful he's going to do what's patient and good that's what he's going to do because he has a king reigning in his heart and he has the same mind in him that Christ Jesus had that he looks upon the needs of others more than the needs of his own I'm moving to my clothes so desired it to be that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potential now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be right now listen and this is I just want to pick up this morning laying the foundation on my thought this morning and we are all still in the image of God but some are so deformed as sons of God that walk contrary to his word and do his ways that he had us and provided for us to walk we're not walking in the way that he provided us to walk which was Faith right without faith it's impossible to please God that's what that was attention he says to what he says say something the world Twisted us out of the way pulls Us close to it and away from the straight narrow stripe that he planted Us in to be Sons and Daughters of God sin has done this evil thing to the Sons and Daughters of God unbelief now this morning we realize that we're supposed to be a people of faith is that right Hebrews 11 and6 without faith it's impossible to please God for We must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him without that Faith you can't please them we can have a religious form but that's not what he's looking for he's looking for men and women who's got the Seed Faith that's planted in there and he's giving you promises and the word of God that that faith that you're meant to have so much so that the very Ministry of Malachi 45 was to restore the faith of the children back to their fathers that's why that word is so important it's designed it's structured the sentences are assembled in such a way the voice emphasis on every noun every thing is is position so perfectly that it strikes the ear and the Heart of the believer there's something about it Satan starts to come around and he's he's saiding well sure you've been heing awful long time and and this is supposed to be the end time I said wait a minute this wasn't about history this is the revelation of Christ Jesus I don't measure things by Time by Distance by space I measure it by eternity so if we're if we're we're supposed to be this great Supernatural people and and and we're supposed to have this Faith to the place that the works that I do you should do also now that's beautiful to say Amen but when you get in the closet and you good in the mirror and you look there you've got to act yourself are the works that he's done absolutely alive in my life and I don't talking about comparing yourselves one to another that's foolish are you true to your heart are you true to that Holy unction that little still Small Voice that tells you to do something or go somewhere or when it tells you you need to make that right or you're convicted of something and you go lay it down you're being led you're not full of bitterness you're not not critical you're not judging the person you're not removing the beams uh you know the slivers out of everybody's eye you're trying to get all the beams out of your life you're trying to have the love of God throw through you and the love of God shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit you're trying to live Godly you're trying to be a Christian you're trying to lay for yourself a pattern of good works you you have the love of God and and and and you want to do something for your fellow man not not oh well we're the ones you know we're the we're the true church show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my Works faith without works is dead little Messiahs this is all that we're supposed to be and we know it so what is holding us back that was a question what what holding us back and you know what it is that's holding us back is fear fear fear man's fear fear you know what fear afraid of the unknown what's out there what's going to happen I I I I'm uncertain about this and I'm uncertain about that I don't want to move forward because I I don't know what the result is I've got to be in control I I I I I I I I can't I can't testify to somebody that they'll get well what happens if they don't I can't walk up to this guy and ask him if he knows the Lord Jesus if he has a burden on his heart what happens if I'm rejected fear feier you know afraid of of of what you can't see afraid of what you can't see what you don't understand and it it it just locks us down scared scared that something's going to happen oh this might happen and that might happen and fear fear begins to to to imprison us we're afraid of what we don't understand we're afraid of what we can't see we're afraid of of of well if I if I don't got a handle on it and I don't know what the outcome is and I don't know what the result is going to be I'm not going to throw my hat in the ring till I've got it I know all what's transpiring we don't walk by sight we walk by faith and fear uh you know that some sort of evil result or circumstance is going to arise well I I want to tell this person but boy if if if they don't take it and and boy this is going to be this and it's going to be bad and I'm afraid I'm afraid at work I'm afraid to go tell my boss boss can I can I get four hours off on Sunday morning so I can go worship God I believe I I can do you a better job when I serve God oh we wouldn't do that why well we I can't lose my job I I I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid what what what happens if I do this what happens if I make a stand for the Lord I'll lose my husband I'll lose my family what's what will you give in exchange for your soul you might be surprised you might just win your family you don't have to be a ashamed of this gospel Paul said I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ because it's the power of God to Salvation not just your salvation but everybody that comes in contact with your stand will be affected by the word of God because God stands by his word and if you stand for him he'll stand for you but if you're a ashamed of him and Afraid of the consequences afraid of the results then then you come under that terrible bondage and the chains of fear and fear paralyzes fear is is the greatest anesthesia there is it stopped you it knocked you out it puts you dead in your tracks and you don't do nothing you will not move you'll stand there in a shell and you'll believe you'll praise you'll do everything but there's absolutely not a Fountain of Life pouring out from you you're absolutely afraid of what's it going to do I'll tell you what it'll do it'll save Souls it'll heal the sick it'll deliver the demons that are bound that's what it'll do oh but you know what it is it's I wonder if it's me and your mind goes back to all the wrong you're doing all the sins in your life and everything and now you're afraid and all he said is cry ABA father confess your sins and he's faithful and just to forgive him but we're Paralyzed by fear Satan's raised up such a culture such a civilization our country is turning away from God that they want me to even be afraid afraid to stand in this pulpit and say homosexuality is a spirit of the devil it's a perversion that a person can be delivered from you can't say stuff like that you get cancelled they can't cancel me cuz I'm [Applause] Eternal I've been planted here to Bear the fruit fruit of this end time message the word of God for this age that's what I'm planted for but fear rules that great Catholic culture I was talking about and I I'm not going to mention any names and I I hope the person doesn't take offense but I I called one day I I dialed the wrong number and the sister answered the phone and I said hello oh sister I said I'm so sorry that I dialed the wrong number and she said oh she said I thought I was in trouble and I thought you know what that's that pastoral demon bondage that's been ruling in the Hispanic Church all over this country for years afraid that they'll put you out of the church afraid the deacons are going to show up and ask you where where you were Wednesday night afraid of the church afraid of the ministry afraid of being blackballed afraid that you might not make it to Heaven well let me give you some news if your name is put in the Lamb's Book of Life nothing can put it on there and nothing can take it off you don't have to be afraid fear not little flock fear not little flock isn't that what he always said this this is what he says in God's projecting his love love has no fear love cast out fear isn't that beautiful just think of that so this is what he always says he says so that's what it is and that's what he always said he always spoke he said fear not fear not fear not fear not fear not it's all through the scripture why he doesn't want us to fear there's no reason to be afraid there is a fear though it's called the fear of God that's not man's fear man's fear is the afraid the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and what is the fear of God the fear of God it's it it's simply there's another fear is the fear of God and what is the fear of God God does what he says you know God's going to do what he says if there's anything it's you have the wisdom that God's going to do what he said that's it that's settled God said so that settles it that is what's going to happen if God said it that's what's going to happen I'm not afraid of that result CU his thoughts to me are good he cares about me I'm his child nothing's going to pluck me from the palm of his hand I want his will in my life I want his correction I don't want my will I want his will so the the fear of God is God does exactly what he says he's going to do that's a knowledge and a faith and a revelation you have how is it it is how God God said no matter what the picture is no matter how he spins it no matter what he makes it appear cuz Satan appears as an angel of Light it doesn't matter it is according to the word of God no changes it doesn't change nothing can change it nothing can stop it nothing can alter its course it'll be just what he said that's the fear of God and the fear of God removes the fear of man and I say this will'll have to remove fear and its companion doubt before faith and the word can rain do you understand we can't go forward with fear it paralyzes us we'll be stuck right where we are no work no Supernatural no power what we'll do is we'll substitute an emotion or a temporary experience for genuine life power in The Believer to speak and believe God's word and stand there till it comes to P not a fleeting moment not a temporary thing but it's a life it's a soldier it's the word made flesh little Messiahs walking out taking control of every circumstance and says I declare this circumstance to come into Conformity to God's word CU God word rule I take control of this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the word of God Satan get behind me no big guys no little yous no special preachers and gifted guys and personalities but Victorious People Day by Day morning by morning afternoon by afternoon evening by evening Night by Night defeating Satan in their lives as he rises up push the fear out fear causes unbelief fear pises you fear is the result of not believing that it's what he said replace man's fear with the fear of God you know what happens is we only go as far as we're comfortable Faith always goes past Faith goes where nobody's ever gone before Faith takes you to where you've never been before because there's nothing worldly that can bring you there you can only get to that realm through the Supernatural and the key to that door is God's word he said so I can lay my hands on the sick and they will recover why because I have a title or a position of Pastor for some reason no you might have the gift of healing right in your life it just needs to be SP stirred up because God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind fear is not a sound mind fear is confusion you can feel fear you walk up it's a wall it's a prison it stops you I'm just afraid where are you going I thought Mom what are you afraid of and I thought Lord I don't ever want to come to that place where I doubt where I'm going you purchased me I'm yours nothing can pluck me out of the palm of your hand and if I'm an eror you'll correct me if I take the permissive will you'll work it out to the perfect will you are my Lord You Are My Savior you are my God and nothing can say separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus no Peril nor sword nor danger or anything what do I have to be afraid of but fear fear is what's stopping us fear of what people think fear of what everybody else is doing fear of this fear of that forg for get fear you are his children we're joint HS with Christ Jesus everything he has is ours fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom why don't we start possessing the kingdom and the the benefits of the Kingdom each of us in order to be a functional part of this body with every member supplying the need to the other you've got to break down the fear because it won't flow you're afraid to fellowship with somebody you're afraid to talk to Christ because maybe they're not a Believer or maybe they'll reject you or maybe they're backslid all the more reason to lift them up the Lord don't want you to be afraid I want to close with some statements now there's only two elements in the world that controls the world tonight that's fear and faith fear stops faith faith eliminates fear so you understand that if there's any fear we've got to start moving that out he controls he'll take care of it don't be afraid don't be afraid of that sickness don't be afraid you're going to be paralyzed don't be afraid you're going to die don't be afraid love has no fear love cast out fear and I notice in my meetings so much that when I come into the people one of the greatest things I find amongst them is fear and what makes fear is lack of confidence if you lack confidence it'll make you fear but if you love it Cast Away fear do lack confidence in what he said you are that's why I love that story of the prodical son he's eating with pigs he's got the husk in his mouth the pigs on the other side he's f to eye with Pig and the scripture says he came to his sensus he said in my father's house servants are eating better than I am and when he went back what did he find he was willing to be a servant but he was an heir he was a son Hallelujah maybe you're in the pig pen fighting a lust devil fighting a video game devil fighting the music devil fighting the fashion devil I know you sisters like to wear those high heels and those tight dresses you know I I don't know you know the world cares about how you're built God don't he built you that way there's not going to be one skinny person in heaven they're going to be so spiritually fat and rich on eating the wedding supper oh they're going to be jolly old souls where do we get all these obsessions well I I saw the other day I I never seen so much stuff you know I was watching a little I like engineering programs I was watching a a program about how that they they dug this tunnel and how they had to overcome it and I'm telling you in the course of that program I was I I was offered uh uh super beats uh I I was offered uh fruits and veggies and and and this and and this pain pill and and this sleep pill and then they went into the creams you know you wipe the creams on your face and it draws your skin all up and everything you look so pretty I want to look like a veteran of Christian War I don't mind having the the battal scars on my life I've seen Devils cast out I've seen them go on the floor like snakes I've seen babies come alive in the womb I've seen people be delivered by Devils I don't talk about it because all the glory goes to him but why are you afraid of the Devil he's a liar there's no truth in him he's the father of lies and he cannot tell the truth the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear if you ever had a Cancer and didn't fear and believe God would heal you you wouldn't be in too bad a shape think of it the life comes in there and you fear it you fear what it's going to do you fear what they say about it you fear all o cancer that's that's a dense and they fear I fear that oh my goodness my mind goes to battle and oh my is going to eat me up and I'm going to die and I have to take chemo if you would believe God you wouldn't be in so bad a shape in fact you know what happened you'd become so Godly that that life wouldn't want to hang around you very much longer it wouldn't find nothing in your life to feed on you got Jesus in every bone of your body and every blood cell in every thought every time he goes to take a bite he gets Jesus he gets the word of God he gets Faith let me tell you the best chemo in the world's faith God said so the fear of God is going to be just the way he said so Hallelujah you want to fight cancer bring it on oh biggest thing Satan could put on you is fear do you understand what I'm trying to say this morning we're not going to go farther down the road as a body of Believers till every single one of our members starts combating the fear when fear Rises up recognize for what it is call it out yes label it you wouldn't be in such bad shape God takes care of that if you're sick whatever it is if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things that Satan can place upon the person the greatest thing that I find against the church tonight is fear everybody is scared to death about something what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy and carefree isn't that beautiful it it it's just beautiful so much he says listen he says now we are a part of God do you believe that that if your heart condemns you God is greater than your heart if you're condemned by your actions you're condemned by what you're partaking in and you know it's wrong he's faithful and just to forgive you come back cleanse your life get rid of the fear don't give them something to hang on to you're a part of God you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking your very name if you ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare why do you think you went through all that about the Lamb's Book of Life about how we were predestinated about how that we're ordained about how we were in this thinking what was the purpose of it to get us away from the fear the fear is Satan's bondage you have a right to do every work in the Scriptures it never was put in a nickol Adan system it was for Sons and Daughters of God he says you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of God see you always were the sons of God Don't Fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am you are air to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours and I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it's yours to use you speak the word and I will perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail hallu you speak it I will perform it that is my Covenant with you and it'll never fail you want to rise up you got to fight the fear you've got to come face to face with the fear you've got to look at it you got to call it out and it's in that mind and you can just start sentencing working don't let it take root let's rise above fear this is my Covenant you speak it I'll perform it that's my Covenant with you and it will not fail you want to rise up in the arms of Faith you want the brother and the sister sitting next to you to have Victory and to have faith you want them to have the good things of God Deliverance joy peace that's your pathless understanding that's the mind of Christ that you look upon the needs of everyone else more than yours do you want that for everybody you say brother mcer I really want that I want to be a real Christian Christian what can I do tackle the fear get rid of the fear fear is the paralytic that has stried the church I don't want to take substitute for real substance of Faith real substance of the word becoming a reality in my life will you join me and pray for me that I can overcome all fear I can overcome fear to pray I can overcome fear to testify that I can overcome fear to speak what he spoke knowing that if I speak it he'll perform it because God can do nothing for us until we confess it first and we're almost afraid to confess it because we're afraid it might not happen because we have no confidence and who we are let's clean that up will you agree with me on that well will we get to a place where we come into the house of God we're not worried about our past we're not worried about our sins we sit in our church we come early to church we make our lives right tonight's communion you have a choice this afternoon to pick what side you're going to be on whether you're going to identify with the cup and with the bread and whether you're going to do it in remembrance of him you'll have that choice you have your choice to say wait a minute I lay all fear aside come up and make a stand knowing that nothing can hurt you nothing can hand harm you if God be for you who can be against you you do that God bless you let's stand [Applause] together let's pray and the musicians we come and only you know in your own heart if there's fear fear of Tomorrow fear of death Paul facing death he said oh death where's your sting oh grave where's your Victory I have run the race I have f fought a good fight now I go to receive the crown that is prepared for me don't you want that to be your attitude towards death not afraid to leave this world you're not leaving nothing undone the world will put you in the ground put a piece of rock they'll bring flowers for a few years and then afterwards you'll be for Goten there's graveyards scattered all over the world maybe some historical grave site I've been to the tomb of John Wesley and alls I could say is H this is where they buried John Wesley I've been to the church and said oh this is John Wesley's Pulpit this is where John Wesley preached just history a memory but don't you want to be something Eternal you know if there's fear in your life and lack of faith and if you sincerely desire that that fear would go from your life and you want a life of freedom and no fear you know it's settled you have confidence your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life and you'd like to raise your hand and say Lord I really want to take control or I really want you to take control of my life I want your word to be what I live by I want the fear of God not the fear of man I want the fear of God that you'll do exactly what you said and nothing would change it I want that kind of confidence father that it'll be according to Thy word Lord I I don't want to be afraid to put you on display no man lith the candle and put it under a bushel basket but they set it on the hill that it might give light that all men can see you are the salt of the earth if it loses its Savor what good is it but to be cast out and trodden underfoot and Lord fear has caused so many of our Believers to be trotten underfoot I pray this morning Father it's my heart's [Music] desire that if there that demon of fear is latched a hold of any heart that they just speak within themselves and say father your word says that I don't have to have this fear and I'm asking you to drive this from me and I'm going to believe your word Lord there's sin in my life and Lord I can't go forward because I know that sin is holding me back Lord I'd like to confess that sin right now and tell you I'm sorry I know that you can take it from me and I'm not going to be afraid that you won't do it I'm not going to be afraid I'm going to fall again but Lord I'm going to get up because you
