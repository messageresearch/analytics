[34:22] it's a little ways away about 500 miles
[34:26] but it doesn't take you
[34:28] if you go the speed limit you can get
[34:30] there in about eight hours
[34:32] if you stretch it a little bit you can
[34:34] get there in seven hours but
[34:37] i can only tell you to go the speed
[34:38] limit and
[34:40] uh so anyway uh uh we're looking forward
[34:44] uh to that so uh uh bill
[34:47] brother billy is going uh uh with us to

[35:54] taken care of
[35:56] if anything happens and they'll know how
[35:58] to get
[35:59] in touch with me also so
[36:02] we want to fellowship just a little bit
[36:04] tonight we won't be long
[36:07] but just as we go along
[36:11] into this great message with this
[36:13] melchizedek we're going to play
[36:16] a little portion tonight of it and
[36:20] and start to just lay out some things
[36:24] that are in front of us for a few
[36:27] moments so
[36:28] if you have your bibles let's turn to
[36:30] the book
[36:31] of ephesians and the second
[36:35] chapter of the book of ephesians
[36:39] and
[36:43] we're going to start with the fourth
[36:44] verse and read down and as you read this
[36:50] you've got to remember the ephesian
[36:52] church being
[36:54] gentiles
[36:58] were there was a great question
[37:01] about circumcision and about obeying the
[37:05] law
[37:06] and trying to bring the gentile into
[37:09] the same manner of religion
[37:13] as the jews were walking in many of the
[37:17] jews
[37:17] wanted to establish holidays and and the
[37:20] same things in fact
[37:22] we know that peter and and paul had a
[37:25] great discussion
[37:27] on that topic uh when uh peter kind of
[37:30] withdrew and
[37:32] went over and sat with the jews and the
[37:35] the gentile brethren were set off to
[37:39] one side i've looked at a lot of the
[37:42] things of the jewish faith
[37:43] and and things i'm i'm glad god made me
[37:46] a gentile
[37:48] i mean that might sound terrible but
[37:51] uh it's good so once you just
[37:55] once you understand this conflict of
[37:58] origin you know what i mean and this
[38:01] well we're more holy and you or we're
[38:04] original
[38:05] and all those things you see
[38:08] how that paul answers this question
[38:12] and as we go through it for just a
[38:15] minute while we read
[38:17] then you you should we'll be able to tie
[38:20] it back
[38:21] to what's being revealed and who is this
[38:24] balchezitec so
[38:26] let's read this together i'm not a very
[38:28] good reader so fill in the blanks and
[38:30] the words i mispronounce
[38:33] it says but god ephesians the second
[38:37] chapter
[38:38] and the fourth verse but god
[38:42] who is rich in mercy for his great
[38:46] love wherewith he loved us
[38:50] so now we're talking about all the
[38:52] motivation
[38:54] that god has for what that he did
[38:57] he so loved the world he gave his only
[38:59] begotten son
[39:01] so god had great love for his creation
[39:05] and his plan you say how could he have
[39:07] great love
[39:08] because it all came from him we've been
[39:11] studying this in melchizedek
[39:13] everything that was made was made by him
[39:15] and he
[39:16] is love so he had to love
[39:20] what that he was and what that he
[39:22] manifested because it was his attribute
[39:25] i
[39:25] hope that's not raises too many
[39:29] wheels turning but even when we were
[39:33] dead
[39:33] in sin hath quickened us together
[39:37] with christ by grace are ye saved
[39:41] even when we are dead in sin
[39:44] hath he quickened us together with
[39:47] christ
[39:48] that's predestination by grace you are
[39:52] saved
[39:53] and hath raised us up together
[39:56] and made us to sit together in heavenly
[40:00] places
[40:00] in christ jesus god bless you bless the
[40:04] word you may be seated as we continue to
[40:06] read
[40:09] so this great love that he had for us
[40:13] uh even when we were yet sinners this
[40:16] uh love had uh already quickened us
[40:21] together so it was it was
[40:24] something that uh was going to be done
[40:29] do you understand you might as well you
[40:31] could have stamped it and sealed it
[40:34] that it's going to happen so there is
[40:36] nothing going to keep it
[40:38] from happening and so he said quickness
[40:42] together
[40:42] for by grace ye are saved through
[40:45] faith and that not
[40:48] of yourselves it
[40:52] is the gift of god
[40:55] so we see that that he's taking
[40:59] us out of the picture
[41:02] as far as anything that can be done for
[41:05] our salvation
[41:07] and again all these things are laid down
[41:11] in the manifestation of who melchizedek
[41:15] was that he was the priest
[41:16] and and we're going to listen to that
[41:19] and and so
[41:20] we see this great beautiful uh uh
[41:23] uh faith and not of ourselves it's a
[41:26] gift of god
[41:27] so he's telling the gentiles here the
[41:31] the jews didn't even earn it
[41:34] but keeping the law by doing all these
[41:37] things
[41:37] salvation is a gift of god
[41:41] we well we were yet sinners he died for
[41:44] us
[41:44] and he quickened us into the things of
[41:47] god
[41:48] so it wasn't uh something that
[41:52] uh was great and he says
[41:55] not of works lest any man should boast
[41:59] so here again is the jew
[42:02] saying well we don't eat things
[42:03] strangled and we don't
[42:05] eat this and we don't do this and we
[42:07] don't do this we're sanctified
[42:10] we're quote unquote the chosen
[42:13] people we are the children of god
[42:17] and remember for all these years they
[42:19] had a disdain
[42:22] for the gentiles because they were
[42:25] unclean
[42:26] and uh the they didn't uh
[42:30] they didn't practice even what became to
[42:33] jews just common sanitation
[42:37] they washed things they washed their
[42:40] pots they washed their hands
[42:42] they've done many things in fact many
[42:45] of the people attributed
[42:48] in the days of the black plague
[42:52] and the plagues that said across
[42:55] europe uh many times the the jewish
[42:58] people didn't
[42:59] suff suffer the death rate
[43:02] that everybody else does but it was
[43:04] because of their cleanliness packages
[43:07] they didn't eat like certain things that
[43:10] were considered
[43:11] unclean and so it had great benefits so
[43:15] we see that this this thing's beginning
[43:17] to unfold
[43:19] and paul's telling the gentiles he says
[43:22] you're saved by grace it's a gift that
[43:25] god gave you
[43:26] not of works unless any man should boast
[43:31] for we are his workmanship
[43:35] created in christ jesus unto good works
[43:40] which god hath before ordained
[43:44] that we should walk in them we're going
[43:47] to return back to that scripture
[43:50] wherefore remember that ye
[43:55] being in times past gentiles
[43:58] in the flesh who are
[44:01] called uncircumcised
[44:04] by that which is called circumcision
[44:09] in the flesh made by hands so he says
[44:12] now remember
[44:13] you used to be called uncircumcised
[44:16] by the circumcised so that's how they
[44:20] referred to you
[44:21] uncircumcised unclean
[44:25] you know not the
[44:28] children of god because the children of
[44:31] god were marked
[44:33] by this circumcision made by hands
[44:36] and this was he said he says so you were
[44:39] called uncircumcised
[44:41] by by that which is called circumcision
[44:44] in flesh made by hands that
[44:47] at the time ye were without christ
[44:53] being alienated from the commonwealth of
[44:57] israel
[44:59] and strangers from the covenant
[45:02] of promise having no hope
[45:06] and without god in the world
[45:10] so you've got the viewpoint now this is
[45:12] a beautiful
[45:13] chapter in the scripture you know
[45:16] if you only read it from the eyes of the
[45:19] gentile then you kind of skim through it
[45:21] but when you understand there's this
[45:23] whole other group of people
[45:25] that's saying you're uncircumcised
[45:28] you're unclean you're not holy
[45:30] you're without what promise we're the
[45:33] children of promise
[45:34] we know what we believe and and you're
[45:36] just gentiles
[45:38] you're you're you have no hope
[45:43] you know there's no way for you to be
[45:45] saved
[45:46] you there's no hope for you because you
[45:48] were
[45:50] you were have you were
[45:53] strangers from the covenants
[45:56] of promise having no hope and without
[46:00] god
[46:01] in the world but now in christ jesus
[46:06] ye who were sometimes were afar off
[46:09] are made nigh by the blood of
[46:12] christ hallelujah so now he's saying
[46:15] okay you used to be without it
[46:18] but there's something that came up come
[46:21] it was a circumcision of the heart
[46:24] and not of the flesh it came by the
[46:27] blood of jesus
[46:28] christ now brought you into the same
[46:30] covenant
[46:31] the same promise the same hope
[46:34] amen so beautiful now that by the blood
[46:37] of christ
[46:38] for he is our peace
[46:42] who who
[46:45] who hath made both one
[46:49] and hath broken down the middle wall
[46:52] of partition between us so now he's
[46:56] talking about both sides are a little
[46:58] standoffish
[47:00] the gentiles received christ the jews
[47:03] still had their way
[47:05] now paul's saying now this is a big part
[47:07] of
[47:08] of of the christian walk
[47:12] that we're fixing to come into that's
[47:14] extremely important
[47:16] and i feel led to preach friday night
[47:19] service
[47:19] in missouri out of the message total
[47:25] deliverance it's an older message but
[47:28] it's really fantastic how brother
[47:31] branham preaches that the advancement
[47:34] of the church has to come in unity
[47:37] and so and he says but he hath broken
[47:40] down the middle wall of partition
[47:42] between
[47:43] us okay having made
[47:46] both one so he's made the circumcision
[47:50] and the uncircumcision both won
[47:54] two opposites two things that were
[47:57] that saw no hope and no promise in one
[48:00] another
[48:01] so there's a great work that
[48:04] is established in in the lord
[48:08] now this same work is is uh
[48:12] uh going on within us
[48:18] uh the reconciliation of our spirit and
[48:22] flesh
[48:27] i know that i will let that out there
[48:29] but i
[48:30] had a great visit with it today at lunch
[48:33] and so this great reconciliation
[48:37] having abolished in his flesh the
[48:40] enmity even the law
[48:44] of commandments contained in ordinance
[48:48] for to make in himself of
[48:51] twain one new man so making peace
[48:57] so in other words the gentile and the
[49:00] jew had access to the same forgiveness
[49:03] the same blood the same unity now he's
[49:06] bringing this
[49:07] into unity and
[49:10] making peace between the gentile
[49:14] and the jew
[49:17] making of them one one accord
[49:20] one purpose even
[49:23] taking away abolishing in his flesh the
[49:28] enmity even the law of commandments so
[49:31] the enmity
[49:32] is the differences between
[49:35] the two anyway and
[49:38] and hath he and
[49:42] that he might reconcile both
[49:46] unto god in one body
[49:49] by the cross having slain
[49:53] the enmity thereby
[49:58] and come and preached peace to you
[50:02] which were afar off and to them
[50:06] that were nigh have you ever read the
[50:10] chapter like this
[50:11] you know what i mean seeing it come
[50:13] right down the two sides there
[50:15] the fuss the argument and what paul's
[50:18] trying to say
[50:19] because he's trying to bring them the
[50:21] revelation
[50:22] of the unity that god's creating in
[50:26] them bringing them together because it's
[50:29] the same unity that's coming to us
[50:32] bringing our spirits and our flesh back
[50:34] together so
[50:38] uh
[50:41] it came in the 18th verse
[50:44] for through him we both
[50:48] have access by one spirit
[50:52] unto the father
[50:55] oh what equal ground no big eyes no
[50:58] little ewes
[50:59] no holy rabbi no ordinances
[51:02] that got you closer to god now he broke
[51:05] all that down
[51:06] and established a new a new
[51:09] meeting place the shed blood
[51:14] god he's a new provided place of
[51:18] worship that comes right up in our
[51:21] series
[51:22] here a new provided place
[51:26] of worship for through him we both have
[51:29] access
[51:30] circumcised uncircumcised uh
[51:35] law jew and gentile we both have
[51:39] access and by one spirit
[51:42] unto the father now therefore
[51:46] ye are no more strangers and foreigners
[51:51] you were once strangers right alienated
[51:55] from the promise
[51:56] but you're no more foreign or strangers
[52:00] okay oh i wish
[52:04] wouldn't you love to come to the spot
[52:06] where you we didn't feel
[52:08] foreign and alienated from the things
[52:11] that god's doing
[52:14] because of our flesh
[52:19] anyway i i love this this is just
[52:22] great i like reading the scriptures i
[52:24] hope you do too
[52:26] hope i'm not boring you you probably
[52:28] already have known all this but i like
[52:30] to fellowship with it
[52:34] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[52:37] and foreigners
[52:38] but fellow citizens with the saints
[52:42] and of the household of god
[52:45] and are built upon the foundation
[52:48] of the apostles and prophets
[52:52] jesus christ himself being the chief
[52:54] cornerstone
[52:57] in whom all the building
[53:02] fitly framed together
[53:05] groweth unto
[53:08] the holy temple in
[53:11] the lord now you
[53:14] you see here what he's saying he says
[53:18] they they both have to come together
[53:22] they both have to be framed together
[53:25] they both have to come under the
[53:27] headship
[53:28] of the lord they they they they they
[53:33] the building is is fitly
[53:36] framed together
[53:40] uh framed together groweth
[53:44] together unto the holy temple of the
[53:48] lord
[53:50] in whom ye also are
[53:54] are built build together
[53:59] for an inhabitation of
[54:02] god through the spirit
[54:06] now as we were uh
[54:09] paul's talking here he's talking about
[54:13] this great because you understand he's
[54:15] the messenger right
[54:17] i know we never look at paul the same
[54:20] way
[54:21] sometimes that we look at our messenger
[54:24] but
[54:25] we we sit down and we read these books
[54:28] right and and we listen to the tapes
[54:30] and we're always going wow wow
[54:33] wow this is unbelievable i see the
[54:37] picture is it unfolds now can you
[54:39] imagine
[54:40] paul is the messenger to the gentiles
[54:44] so now he's bringing the mystery
[54:48] of the gospel of the lord to the
[54:50] gentiles
[54:51] so now he's going out revealing to the
[54:54] gentiles revealing to the jews
[54:58] this plan of god of fitting and joining
[55:02] the gentiles together and building a
[55:05] habitation
[55:06] for the lord for the spirit of the lord
[55:12] that this this great revelation of the
[55:16] plan of god
[55:17] uh unfolding and paul's talking
[55:21] hey these gentiles have to come in
[55:25] they have to be a part it's not going to
[55:28] be the jewish church and the gentile
[55:31] church
[55:31] it's going to be one church put together
[55:35] for the glory of god for the
[55:37] inhabitation of god
[55:39] and and so we we begin
[55:42] to realize that
[55:46] within within the gentiles
[55:49] and within the a
[55:52] jews part of the great
[55:55] mysterious plan of god is hid
[56:00] okay in our day part of the great
[56:02] mysterious plan of god
[56:04] is hid in you
[56:10] okay so we we look back and we saw
[56:13] here in the 10th verse is paul's
[56:17] building up and talking and saying
[56:20] hey you are you are his workmanship
[56:25] so he's telling them being gentiles that
[56:28] you're part of the plan of god the
[56:30] workmanship of god
[56:32] you're part of this do you have a part
[56:35] in this
[56:36] you have a place to play in it because
[56:38] he's going to take these
[56:40] two things fit them and join them
[56:42] together and and
[56:44] make it a habitation for god
[56:49] and and so now he says so he's telling
[56:52] me he says
[56:53] he says uh for we are his workmanship
[56:57] created in christ jesus unto good works
[57:02] which god hath before ordained that we
[57:05] should walk in them
[57:07] and so he has to unveil
[57:10] you see we had the opening of the seven
[57:15] seals right
[57:16] and after the opening of the seven seals
[57:19] the the seven mysterious
[57:21] of mysteries that hid the plan of god
[57:25] now come into full view
[57:29] so we can we can we start to see now
[57:32] that there there just like there was a
[57:35] coming together
[57:36] of the of the gentile and the jew
[57:39] there's there's coming together of a a
[57:42] of a theophany body and a
[57:46] a redeemed glorified body there's
[57:48] another union taking place right
[57:51] there's a union an invisible union
[57:54] taking place
[57:56] up between the heavenly bridegroom
[57:59] and the earthly bride and so in this
[58:02] part
[58:03] part of that lies within you
[58:07] okay so he has to unveil
[58:10] you or open you up
[58:18] so that plans in there
[58:23] you know what i mean brother
[58:26] when we play this little part of the
[58:28] quote he makes a
[58:30] a a statement about the spirit tearing
[58:33] you out
[58:35] okay so so he he so you're living your
[58:39] life
[58:40] and now you're part of this plan so he's
[58:43] got to find you
[58:45] right he goes out and he he preaches the
[58:47] gospel of peace
[58:48] he pulls you in from the highways and
[58:50] the byways
[58:51] and from the world and now he goes to
[58:54] opening you
[58:55] up amen so hit that that
[58:59] he's got to open you up right and he's
[59:02] got to bring out
[59:04] the before ordained works
[59:11] okay they're in there
[59:18] okay the four ordained works
[59:21] see i just want to fly to missouri right
[59:24] now and get it over with
[59:30] because once i preach something i just
[59:32] want to keep moving on
[59:34] so i'm not i'm trying to let you know
[59:37] because
[59:38] you're my friends but i don't want to
[59:42] give enough
[59:42] in case anybody's you know what i'm
[59:45] trying to say
[59:46] anyway so you kind of read between the
[59:48] lines right
[59:49] but so but he's got to open you up right
[59:52] because because those works are in there
[59:56] so he's he's got to he's got to bring
[59:59] out
[1:00:00] the before ordained works that we are
[1:00:03] to walk in and manifest
[1:00:07] so they're there they're hitting you
[1:00:12] they're that plan is
[1:00:15] there it and so a lot of times
[1:00:18] we think of the opening of the seals and
[1:00:21] the opening of
[1:00:23] of these things and we look at it way
[1:00:25] too much
[1:00:26] through an intellectual
[1:00:29] uh theological
[1:00:32] uh doctrinal uh
[1:00:36] academic teaching but
[1:00:39] really it it's a reality
[1:00:43] of the of god
[1:00:46] fulfilling out his plan and the
[1:00:49] the part that you play in that
[1:00:53] great plan and
[1:00:56] so when we listen to this little part
[1:01:00] of uh who is this malkesadek
[1:01:05] we we begin to see how this
[1:01:09] how this uh that what's transpiring
[1:01:14] within us is individuals
[1:01:18] because a lot of times we question well
[1:01:21] you know what's going on with me
[1:01:25] you know well if someone's opening you
[1:01:28] up
[1:01:30] and starting to discard
[1:01:34] the things that aren't part of the plan
[1:01:38] you know it's not your salvation
[1:01:41] he said that that we could grow
[1:01:44] together so
[1:01:47] this spirit man has got to have a
[1:01:51] vehicle
[1:01:52] of manifestation so there's got to be
[1:01:56] some place in our walk that there's a
[1:02:00] reconciliation
[1:02:02] between our spirit man and our flesh man
[1:02:10] not that we love the flesh man
[1:02:13] you know what i mean but we know why we
[1:02:15] have to bring him under subjection
[1:02:18] we know why that he gave us the flesh
[1:02:20] man
[1:02:22] he we understand why that we came the
[1:02:25] way we come
[1:02:26] remember and that's the part of the
[1:02:28] whole plan
[1:02:29] that we're talking about in melchizedek
[1:02:32] he explains melchizedek
[1:02:33] he explains the theophany body and you
[1:02:36] go wow that's wonderful he says but you
[1:02:38] had to bypass it
[1:02:43] come on
[1:02:49] i thought i had something going here for
[1:02:51] a little while
[1:02:53] i'm reading these pages and i'm ready to
[1:02:55] step out
[1:02:56] and he says but you had to bypass it
[1:03:01] because god has
[1:03:04] got this great thing so part
[1:03:07] of the mystery of maltese adapt
[1:03:12] is the reconciliation
[1:03:15] of our flesh and our spirit
[1:03:19] breaking down the enmity between the two
[1:03:23] because that's what the law did right it
[1:03:26] governed
[1:03:27] every all the things that are in the
[1:03:29] flesh
[1:03:30] but through christ jesus so you can
[1:03:33] understand
[1:03:34] why you were born to sinner
[1:03:37] you know but how that he found you
[1:03:41] and how nothing's laid to the charge of
[1:03:43] god's elect
[1:03:45] and all those things that we talk but
[1:03:48] that's to bring you
[1:03:49] to a place okay
[1:03:52] that we can grow to where we don't let
[1:03:56] the flesh stand in between
[1:04:00] the works that were for ordained
[1:04:03] to do now i just
[1:04:06] gave you a whole bunch of stuff
[1:04:12] but i mean and it's good stuff
[1:04:16] and it's just going to take a long time
[1:04:18] to go through it
[1:04:19] uh billy said uh well when you print the
[1:04:22] who's this male tease it out
[1:04:24] in flesh and bring it up there and i
[1:04:26] said well
[1:04:28] i'm not going to preach out i just i
[1:04:30] said what makes you think i'm going to
[1:04:32] preach out on monkeys
[1:04:33] he says well it's become your favorite
[1:04:35] book
[1:04:38] that's till i start reading the next one
[1:04:43] you know what i mean amen so so this
[1:04:47] reconciliation
[1:04:48] is very thing and so
[1:04:51] and then i'm going to read this to you
[1:04:53] and then we'll play this little portion
[1:04:55] and we won't stay long tonight
[1:04:59] it says and in in who's this malpisode
[1:05:03] paragraph 112 he says
[1:05:07] who is this melchizedek but god
[1:05:10] now we see here plainly
[1:05:14] the complete secret
[1:05:17] of our lives in journey
[1:05:21] and death and where we go
[1:05:25] after we die
[1:05:28] the secret of our lives
[1:05:35] i i i mean
[1:05:38] that just stops me in my tracks you mean
[1:05:42] there's a
[1:05:42] secret in my life
[1:05:47] right well one of the things the seventh
[1:05:50] seal does is it reveals what
[1:05:53] all the mysteries even the mystery of
[1:05:57] the secret of my life
[1:05:59] so if he had to open the seven seals he
[1:06:02] has to
[1:06:09] do you understand so so i i get
[1:06:12] unveiled amen
[1:06:17] so this this uh this
[1:06:21] redeemed reconciled spirit in
[1:06:24] word man he has to be
[1:06:28] unveiled
[1:06:31] now i just can't help but i love you
[1:06:33] guys
[1:06:34] so much you know how
[1:06:37] that you unveil
[1:06:40] anything is that spiritual
[1:06:46] or invisible right
[1:06:49] it's remember casper the ghost
[1:06:54] how you guys aren't that old
[1:06:58] i mean matt i can maybe you shaking your
[1:07:01] head casper the ghost
[1:07:02] well casper the coast the ghost is a
[1:07:05] spirit
[1:07:06] right but so what they did is they put a
[1:07:09] little
[1:07:10] a sheet on them and now he was cast for
[1:07:14] the ghost
[1:07:16] because he had a what on him a veil
[1:07:19] so he's got to and in order to unveil
[1:07:23] that secret mystery in
[1:07:27] what that he wants to bring out it has
[1:07:30] to be veiled in flesh
[1:07:39] you've got to manifest the attributes
[1:07:41] through something
[1:07:46] you understand so he
[1:07:49] and that's why he says you take this
[1:07:52] redeemed
[1:07:54] body this body that he used
[1:07:58] to go ahead and manifest that inward man
[1:08:01] and then that body will become glorified
[1:08:04] we won't go into all
[1:08:05] those parts but we'll read it but i just
[1:08:07] want you to
[1:08:08] to to see hear this
[1:08:12] unfolding or unveiling
[1:08:15] or opening of you
[1:08:19] and why you he can reconcile that with
[1:08:22] the flesh
[1:08:23] because he's got to use the flesh
[1:08:27] to manifest the four ordained works
[1:08:32] is that simple enough okay
[1:08:35] so we spend all the time just beating
[1:08:39] us ourselves down and wanting to get rid
[1:08:42] of the flesh
[1:08:43] and it isn't you can't get rid of it
[1:08:45] until he gets rid of it
[1:08:48] you understand but he wants to us to
[1:08:51] bring it
[1:08:52] under subjection
[1:08:55] or under the leadership of the holy
[1:08:59] spirit
[1:09:00] in other words he wants us to use our
[1:09:02] flesh
[1:09:04] as his temple and not
[1:09:08] for the temple of sin
[1:09:13] so we just read this 12th
[1:09:16] verse here plainly the complete secret
[1:09:20] of our lives in journey and death and
[1:09:22] where we go after we die
[1:09:25] also predestination is in plain view
[1:09:28] here
[1:09:28] now listen as we teach this
[1:09:32] closely and may i just
[1:09:35] jump ahead he's also going to go into
[1:09:38] here in the next few pages
[1:09:41] the predestination of the ministry of
[1:09:44] the son of man
[1:09:45] or the revisitation of the theophany
[1:09:50] which means god elohim or
[1:09:53] god amorphy in our day
[1:09:57] but he says the stage of
[1:10:00] the stages now listen
[1:10:03] as we teach on this closely or teach
[1:10:06] closely the stages of the eternal
[1:10:10] purpose
[1:10:14] i know i just read the same thing
[1:10:17] but i didn't break it up in two separate
[1:10:20] thought patterns
[1:10:22] listen closely as we teach this closely
[1:10:25] the stages of the eternal purpose
[1:10:29] he had in his secret
[1:10:32] has now been revealed
[1:10:36] notice there are still three stages of
[1:10:39] perfection
[1:10:40] just like he redeemed the world the same
[1:10:43] way he redeems his church
[1:10:45] he redeems the people in three stages
[1:10:52] so don't ever think that the one stage
[1:10:55] is passed
[1:10:56] on you know that took
[1:10:59] three stages he actually in your life
[1:11:05] that every time you have a growth stage
[1:11:09] and you realize that where you were
[1:11:12] before
[1:11:13] is no longer acceptable he has to
[1:11:17] apply justification
[1:11:21] okay you were justified in going through
[1:11:24] that stage
[1:11:26] now let's move up a little higher he has
[1:11:29] to apply sanctification
[1:11:31] getting rid of things right and then he
[1:11:34] applies manifestation so
[1:11:37] those three stages are the continual
[1:11:41] three works that he does in your life
[1:11:44] all along your journey okay
[1:11:48] now we we play now we see here plainly
[1:11:52] the complete secret of our lives
[1:11:54] in journey
[1:11:57] okay um
[1:12:00] in the three stages of prediction the
[1:12:02] same way
[1:12:03] he redeems his people in three stages
[1:12:06] now look first
[1:12:07] is justification like luther preached
[1:12:10] second sanctification
[1:12:11] like leslie preached third baptism of
[1:12:14] the holy ghost
[1:12:16] is that right three
[1:12:19] then comes the rapture
[1:12:22] amen that's that's uh that's good for
[1:12:26] tonight
[1:12:26] um because i'm just
[1:12:30] trying to just wait on the anointing for
[1:12:32] the meeting and
[1:12:34] and everything but i i think that's some
[1:12:36] wonderful nuggets
[1:12:38] don't you and i think that that was
[1:12:41] worth coming out tonight
[1:12:43] for you know just to sit there and see
[1:12:45] the word and
[1:12:46] understand that you're you're a you're a
[1:12:49] seal
[1:12:53] well you're sealed till the day of your
[1:12:56] redemption right
[1:12:58] so when the hour of your redemption
[1:13:00] comes hand
[1:13:02] the rapture
[1:13:06] he's got to open the seal because it's
[1:13:09] reached its
[1:13:11] destination and he's using these three
[1:13:15] stages all the time to perfect you
[1:13:18] okay he's going to do it so let's just
[1:13:21] listen to this i don't know might be 10
[1:13:23] minutes
[1:13:24] or so and then i just ask you to pray
[1:13:27] for me
[1:13:30] that i can get myself out of the way and
[1:13:33] i can um share
[1:13:38] these uh little things that i shared
[1:13:41] with you tonight
[1:13:43] through that other message and and then
[1:13:46] again
[1:13:47] pray for matthew and uh
[1:13:51] jackson is there the church is being put
[1:13:53] in their hands while we're away
[1:13:55] and then uh pray for billy and i
[1:13:59] is we try to minister and then all the
[1:14:01] prayer requests
[1:14:03] that are up there so lord richly bless
[1:14:06] you
[1:14:06] let's just take a few moments and and
[1:14:09] read this we're going to start i believe
[1:14:12] on paragraph
[1:14:16] if you want to pull it up on your
[1:14:18] tablets or your phones i never thought
[1:14:20] i'd ever come to the day i'd say that
[1:14:23] so it must be
[1:14:26] it must be uh
[1:14:30] justification or something i i
[1:14:33] i i don't know i'm fighting that hard
[1:14:37] but uh you know it's okay
[1:14:40] just turn your ringers off and turn
[1:14:43] social media off and uh
[1:14:46] no i guess that would be social media
[1:14:48] right if you had it on your phone
[1:14:51] i don't know but we're gonna start at
[1:14:52] paragraph uh
[1:14:54] 90. and and just go to the end of
[1:14:58] paragraph
[1:14:59] 125 so god bless you listen close
[1:15:02] keep those thoughts in mind because
[1:15:04] god's got a lot of wonderful things to
[1:15:06] unveil to us god bless you
[1:15:14] let us notice another prophet one time
[1:15:18] by the name of samuel he was a great man
[1:15:22] he taught israel told him he shouldn't
[1:15:23] have a king he said if i
[1:15:25] ever said one thing to you in the name
[1:15:27] of the lord but what come to pass
[1:15:30] they said no everything you've always
[1:15:31] said in the name of the lord come to
[1:15:32] pass
[1:15:33] he was a prophet and he died
[1:15:37] about three or four years later the king
[1:15:39] got in trouble
[1:15:40] that's before the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:42] was ever shed
[1:15:44] he was in paradise and a witch of indras
[1:15:47] called for somebody to come console
[1:15:51] saul and when the witch saw him standing
[1:15:54] up
[1:15:55] she said i see god raising up out of the
[1:15:58] earth
[1:15:59] and after the man had been dead buried
[1:16:02] and rotted in the grave here he was
[1:16:05] standing there
[1:16:07] in that cave with his prophet's robes on
[1:16:11] i was still a prophet
[1:16:16] before he said why did you call me out
[1:16:19] of my rest see you become an enemy to
[1:16:21] god
[1:16:22] watch him prophesy tomorrow
[1:16:25] night but this time you will be with me
[1:16:30] he was still a prophet though he was
[1:16:32] gone from this body
[1:16:33] see he become here and was part of that
[1:16:36] word
[1:16:37] amen and he entered from the fleshlight
[1:16:40] back into the body that had been
[1:16:41] prepared for him before the foundation
[1:16:43] of the world
[1:16:44] he entered into the theophany which was
[1:16:48] the word
[1:16:49] you get it that's where all believers go
[1:16:53] when we turn from hearing then in that
[1:16:56] form
[1:16:57] the veil then is lifted you see
[1:17:00] you are the word also when you enter
[1:17:03] into there
[1:17:05] as a little baby as i said a while ago
[1:17:07] now i noticed
[1:17:08] praise god for these opening seals is my
[1:17:11] prayer
[1:17:12] then know these things now the true
[1:17:15] revelation
[1:17:16] of melchizedek comes into view
[1:17:20] why he was god the word
[1:17:23] before he became flesh
[1:17:26] god the word because he had to be
[1:17:30] no one else could be immortal like him
[1:17:35] see i had father and mother you did too
[1:17:40] jesus had father and mother
[1:17:43] but this man had no father or had no
[1:17:47] mother
[1:17:49] jesus had a time he started this man
[1:17:51] didn't
[1:17:55] jesus gave his life this man couldn't
[1:17:57] because he was life
[1:18:00] it's a self-saved man all the time
[1:18:03] i hope god reveals it to you
[1:18:07] but self same person all the time
[1:18:10] notice his title king of righteousness
[1:18:13] now hebrews 7 2 king of righteousness
[1:18:17] and king of peace
[1:18:21] he's two kings now watch hebrews 7 2
[1:18:26] king of righteousness also the king of
[1:18:29] peace
[1:18:30] he's two kings there now since he has
[1:18:34] come in the flesh
[1:18:37] and received his body up in revelations
[1:18:40] 21 16
[1:18:41] he's called the king of kings
[1:18:45] he's all three of them together
[1:18:49] see king god king theophany
[1:18:52] king jesus he's the king of kings
[1:18:56] it's all men it's like soul body and
[1:18:58] spirit all comes to make one
[1:19:00] also he is the father which was the
[1:19:03] first
[1:19:04] son and holy ghost the spirit
[1:19:07] king of righteousness the spirit
[1:19:10] attribute
[1:19:11] theophany king of of
[1:19:14] um peace theophany
[1:19:18] and in flesh he was king of kings
[1:19:22] same person when the theophany
[1:19:26] moses seen him exodus 33
[1:19:30] 2 he was a theophany moses wanted to see
[1:19:33] god
[1:19:34] he heard his voice heard him talk to him
[1:19:36] see him in a bush there
[1:19:38] was a big pillar of fire and he said who
[1:19:40] are you i want to know who you are
[1:19:42] moses said i'll put if you let me see
[1:19:45] you
[1:19:45] i would like to see your face he said no
[1:19:47] man can't see my face he said i'll put
[1:19:50] my hand over your eyes
[1:19:52] and i'll pass by and you can see my back
[1:19:56] but not my face see
[1:19:59] and when he did it was the back of a man
[1:20:02] it was
[1:20:02] theophany then the word
[1:20:06] that come to moses i am
[1:20:09] that was the word
[1:20:12] the word came to moses in the form of
[1:20:15] a pillar of fire in a burning bush the i
[1:20:17] am
[1:20:19] as the word from the theology from the
[1:20:22] theophany rather
[1:20:22] excuse me he came to abraham as a man
[1:20:26] under the oak tree now look at aaron
[1:20:29] there came a man to abraham three of
[1:20:31] them
[1:20:32] and sat down under an oak tree
[1:20:35] three of them i noticed
[1:20:39] after he talked to abraham
[1:20:42] why did he come abraham being the one
[1:20:46] with the promise and the message
[1:20:49] of the coming son and also he was
[1:20:52] god's word prophet
[1:20:55] that was trusting god's word calling
[1:20:58] anything contrary
[1:20:59] as though it wasn't see how perfect the
[1:21:02] word is
[1:21:03] the word came to the prophet
[1:21:07] see there was god in a theophany
[1:21:10] and the bible said the word comes to the
[1:21:13] prophet
[1:21:15] and here was the the word
[1:21:18] in the theophany now you say was that
[1:21:20] god abraham said it was
[1:21:23] he said his name was he called him
[1:21:25] elohim
[1:21:27] now genesis 1 you find out in the
[1:21:30] beginning
[1:21:31] elohim created the heavens and earth in
[1:21:33] genesis 18
[1:21:34] we find out that abraham called this
[1:21:38] person that sat there and talked to him
[1:21:41] and could tell him the secrets of his
[1:21:43] heart
[1:21:44] tell him what sarah was thinking behind
[1:21:46] him abraham said
[1:21:48] it is elohim
[1:21:51] is it a theophany form you get it
[1:21:55] notice after
[1:21:58] now we find out that he was then in the
[1:22:01] theophany form
[1:22:02] he called him lord god elohim now in
[1:22:05] genesis 18
[1:22:06] we find that that is true now notice
[1:22:11] abraham there was three of them together
[1:22:15] but when abraham met the three he said
[1:22:18] my lord
[1:22:21] but when locked down in sodom two of
[1:22:24] them went down there
[1:22:26] and lot saw two of them coming and he
[1:22:28] said my lords
[1:22:31] see what was the matter the first place
[1:22:34] lot was not a prophet
[1:22:37] right or neither was it the messenger
[1:22:42] of the hour so he didn't have any
[1:22:45] revelation of him
[1:22:48] it's exactly right lot could call him
[1:22:50] large
[1:22:52] a dozen of them he could still said
[1:22:53] lords but no matter how
[1:22:55] many abraham saw it was still one lord
[1:23:01] there is god this is the melchizedek
[1:23:04] notice after the battle was over
[1:23:07] melchizedek
[1:23:08] served his victorious child communion
[1:23:13] think of that part of himself
[1:23:16] now we want to see here and type here is
[1:23:19] in view
[1:23:20] the communion after the battle he
[1:23:23] gave of himself because the communion is
[1:23:26] part of
[1:23:26] christ and after the struggle is over
[1:23:30] after you got yourself whipped out dance
[1:23:33] when you
[1:23:34] partake of christ become
[1:23:37] part of this being you get it
[1:23:41] jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't
[1:23:43] turn him loose
[1:23:44] until he blessed him right battle for
[1:23:48] life and after the battle is over
[1:23:52] then god gives you of himself
[1:23:55] that is his true communion
[1:23:59] the little bread and wafer just
[1:24:01] represents it you shouldn't take it
[1:24:02] unless you've wrestled it out
[1:24:04] and become part of god remember
[1:24:08] at this time the communion had never
[1:24:10] been instituted
[1:24:13] not until before the death of jesus
[1:24:16] christ
[1:24:17] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:24:19] years later amen
[1:24:20] but melchizedek after his child
[1:24:24] abraham had won the victory melchizedek
[1:24:27] met him and gave him wine and bread
[1:24:30] amen showing that after this earthly
[1:24:34] battle is over
[1:24:36] we will meet him in the heavens and take
[1:24:38] the communion again it'll be the wedding
[1:24:40] supper
[1:24:40] amen i will not drink before the vine or
[1:24:43] eat the fruit
[1:24:44] until i eat it and drink it with you and
[1:24:46] you in my father's kingdom
[1:24:48] is that right notice
[1:24:51] again melchizedek went to meet abraham
[1:24:55] before he got back home
[1:24:59] what a beautiful type here we have
[1:25:01] melchizedek
[1:25:03] meeting abraham before he got back home
[1:25:06] after the battle
[1:25:09] we meet jesus in the air before we get
[1:25:11] home
[1:25:13] that's right ii thessalonians tells us
[1:25:16] that
[1:25:18] for we meet him in the air a beautiful
[1:25:20] type of rebecca meeting
[1:25:22] isaac in the field in the cool of the
[1:25:24] day
[1:25:26] we meet him in the air 2 thessalonians
[1:25:29] tells us so far we would survive and
[1:25:30] remain
[1:25:31] shall not prevent or hinder those which
[1:25:33] are asleep for the trumpet of god shall
[1:25:35] sound the dead in christ shall rise
[1:25:36] first
[1:25:37] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:25:39] caught up together with them to meet the
[1:25:40] lord
[1:25:41] in the air perfect
[1:25:44] all these times therefore the theophany
[1:25:48] if you have died and entered into that
[1:25:51] theophany
[1:25:52] what happens the theophany comes to the
[1:25:55] earth to pick up
[1:25:57] the redeemed body
[1:26:00] and if you're here in the air you take
[1:26:02] the body to meet the theophany
[1:26:04] there you aren't caught up and go to
[1:26:07] meet the lord in the air
[1:26:09] who is this melchizedek but god
[1:26:12] now we see here plainly the complete
[1:26:15] secret
[1:26:16] of our lives in journey and death
[1:26:19] and where we go after we die also
[1:26:23] predestination is in plain view here
[1:26:26] now listen as we teach this closely
[1:26:30] the stages of
[1:26:33] of the eternal purpose he
[1:26:37] had in his secret has now been revealed
[1:26:41] notice there is still three stages
[1:26:44] to perfection just like he redeems the
[1:26:47] world
[1:26:48] same way he redeems his church he
[1:26:49] redeems the people in three stages
[1:26:52] now look first is justification
[1:26:56] like luther preached second
[1:26:59] sanctification
[1:27:01] like wesley preached third baptism of
[1:27:03] the holy ghost
[1:27:05] that's right then comes the rapture
[1:27:09] now the world how do you redeem the
[1:27:10] world the first what he did
[1:27:13] when his sin he washed it off in water
[1:27:16] baptism that's right
[1:27:18] then he dropped his blood up on it from
[1:27:20] the cross and sanctified it and called
[1:27:22] it his own
[1:27:24] then what does he do as he tore
[1:27:28] all the world out of you and renovated
[1:27:30] the whole thing by the
[1:27:31] fiery baptism of the holy ghost he also
[1:27:34] will renovate the world
[1:27:36] it'll be burnt over with fire
[1:27:39] and cleanse every germ from millions of
[1:27:42] miles high
[1:27:42] everything will be cleaned off and then
[1:27:44] there is a new heaven and a new earth
[1:27:46] just like you are a new creature in
[1:27:48] christ jesus
[1:27:49] when the holy spirit takes a hold of you
[1:27:51] hallelujah
[1:27:52] there you are the whole thing's just as
[1:27:56] plain as it can be everything's in three
[1:27:58] the natural births and three
[1:28:00] what's the first thing happens to the
[1:28:02] woman having a baby what breaks first
[1:28:04] water what breaks next blood
[1:28:08] what's the next process life water blood
[1:28:12] spirit
[1:28:12] what happens to the plane rocks what's
[1:28:15] the first thing stone
[1:28:17] what's the next possible what's the next
[1:28:19] shelf then the green
[1:28:22] comes out of that just the three stages
[1:28:24] of it it gets to the green
[1:28:25] that's exactly god vindicates that's
[1:28:28] always been right god vindicates it to
[1:28:30] be
[1:28:30] true so plainly the predestinated
[1:28:34] is the only one that's considered in
[1:28:36] redemption
[1:28:39] did you get it let me say that again the
[1:28:42] predestination
[1:28:45] is the only one that's considered in
[1:28:47] redemption
[1:28:48] people might be making i think they are
[1:28:51] but the real redemption
[1:28:53] is those that are predestinated because
[1:28:56] the very word
[1:28:57] redeem means to bring back amen
[1:29:03] is that right the redeem is something to
[1:29:06] redeem anything is bring it back to its
[1:29:09] original place
[1:29:11] hallelujah so it's only to predestinate
[1:29:14] it will be brought back because
[1:29:16] others didn't come from there they
[1:29:20] bring back being eternal with him at
[1:29:24] the beginning the eternal life that you
[1:29:27] had is
[1:29:28] thought of what she was only he wanted
[1:29:31] you to
[1:29:32] he wanted me to stand the pulpit say he
[1:29:34] wants you to set the seat
[1:29:35] tonight then we are serving his
[1:29:38] eternal purpose and the one that left
[1:29:41] home
[1:29:42] only come to the earth to serve his
[1:29:45] purpose is that right
[1:29:48] all right then after it's finished it's
[1:29:50] brought back
[1:29:53] in a glorified state it's matured
[1:29:56] and brought back again no wonder paul
[1:29:59] could say
[1:30:00] when there is filling the block to chop
[1:30:01] his head off he said oh death where is
[1:30:03] your stain
[1:30:05] oh grave where is your victory but
[1:30:07] thanks be to
[1:30:08] god who gives us the victory amen
[1:30:11] he said death tell me where you can make
[1:30:13] me holler
[1:30:16] grave tell me how you gonna hold me for
[1:30:19] i
[1:30:20] am a possessor of eternal life amen amen
[1:30:24] hallelujah you recognize it
[1:30:27] death hell brave nothing could hold you
[1:30:31] and nothing can hurt us
[1:30:34] got eternal life he realized
[1:30:37] he was blessed with eternal life just
[1:30:40] like
[1:30:41] a little dewdrop if i understand it
[1:30:44] i don't know too much about chemistry
[1:30:46] but
[1:30:47] it must be that it's the congealing of
[1:30:50] humidity or atmosphere and when the
[1:30:53] night gets cold and dark
[1:30:55] it falls from the heavens and drops up
[1:30:58] on the ground
[1:30:59] it fell from somewhere but the next
[1:31:02] morning before the sun comes up
[1:31:04] it's laying there the little fella
[1:31:05] shivering but let's let the sun come up
[1:31:07] what's he going to shine it's happy
[1:31:10] why the sun is going to call it right
[1:31:14] back to where it come from
[1:31:16] and that's the way with a christian
[1:31:19] hallelujah
[1:31:21] we know when we walk into the presence
[1:31:23] of
[1:31:24] god something in us tells us that we
[1:31:27] come from somewhere
[1:31:28] and we're going back into that power
[1:31:31] that's a police
[1:31:33] a little dew drop he glistens and shines
[1:31:36] and shouts
[1:31:38] because he knows he come from up there
[1:31:40] and that sun's going to draw him right
[1:31:41] back up again
[1:31:43] and a man that's an attribute of god
[1:31:45] lord of god amen
[1:31:47] knows hallelujah when he come in contact
[1:31:49] with the son of god he's going to be
[1:31:51] drawn up from here someday
[1:31:53] or if i'll be lifted up from the earth
[1:31:55] i'll draw all you man unto me
[1:31:58] amen now
[1:32:01] notice now we see melchizedek
[1:32:04] and why that mary wasn't his mother
[1:32:10] that's the reason he called her woman
[1:32:13] not mother
[1:32:15] he had no father for he was the father
[1:32:20] the everlasting father the three and the
[1:32:23] one
[1:32:24] he had no mother certainly not
[1:32:27] he had no father or he was the father
[1:32:31] as a poet said one time
[1:32:34] speaking a great compliment
[1:32:38] unto jesus he said i
[1:32:41] am the spoke to moses in a burning bush
[1:32:45] of fire
[1:32:46] i am the god of abraham the bright
[1:32:49] morning star
[1:32:51] i'm alpha omega the beginning from the
[1:32:54] end
[1:32:55] i am the whole creation and jesus is the
[1:32:59] name
[1:33:00] that's right oh who do you say that i
[1:33:03] am and whence do they say that i came do
[1:33:06] you know my father or
[1:33:07] can you tell his name hallelujah that's
[1:33:10] the father's name
[1:33:11] i come in my father's day and you
[1:33:13] receive me now amen
[1:33:16] sure he's the same yesterday and
[1:33:21] and the smell keswick became flesh
[1:33:25] he revealed himself as son of man
[1:33:29] when he come as a prophet he come in
[1:33:31] three names
[1:33:32] of a son the son of man the
[1:33:36] son of god the son of david when he was
[1:33:38] sure on earth
[1:33:40] he was a man to fulfill the scripture
[1:33:43] moses said the lord your god shall raise
[1:33:45] up a prophet
[1:33:47] like an unto me so he had to come as
[1:33:51] a prophet he didn't ever say i am the
[1:33:54] son of god
[1:33:55] he said i am the son of man do you
[1:33:58] believe the son of man
[1:34:00] because that's what he had to testify of
[1:34:02] because that's what he was
[1:34:05] now he's come in another son's name son
[1:34:07] of god the unseen the spirit
[1:34:10] and when he comes again his son of david
[1:34:12] is set up on his throne
[1:34:14] now when he was shared and was made
[1:34:16] flesh
[1:34:17] he was called the son of man
[1:34:20] now how did he make himself known
[1:34:24] to the world as son of man
[1:34:28] the prophet
[1:34:35] that was the appetizer
[1:34:39] amen do you love the lord isn't that
[1:34:43] in that something let me just read this
[1:34:45] statement again
[1:34:47] to you and uh
[1:34:50] and and this kind of goes back to it we
[1:34:54] were talking just a little bit
[1:34:56] about that rick reconciliation
[1:35:00] in paragraph 119. just like a little
[1:35:03] drew drop
[1:35:04] if i understand it i don't know too much
[1:35:07] about the chemistry
[1:35:09] but but it must be that
[1:35:13] the the congelling of humidity or
[1:35:16] atmosphere
[1:35:18] and when the night gets cold and dark it
[1:35:20] falls from heaven
[1:35:23] and drops upon the ground it fell from
[1:35:26] somewhere
[1:35:27] but the next morning before the sun
[1:35:30] comes up
[1:35:30] it's lying there the little fellow
[1:35:34] shivering okay so
[1:35:37] we fell right
[1:35:40] we bypassed and and here we are right
[1:35:43] and he said in shivering but just let
[1:35:48] the sun come up and watch
[1:35:52] it go to shining it's happy why
[1:35:55] the sun is going to call it back
[1:35:59] to where it come from you see it's
[1:36:02] it's reconciled now it's shivering it's
[1:36:06] cold
[1:36:06] it's down here it doesn't have its
[1:36:09] identity here
[1:36:11] that's not where it comes from but now
[1:36:13] it knows
[1:36:14] i i fell to earth i bypassed my
[1:36:18] theophany
[1:36:19] and now the sun is calling me back
[1:36:23] from where i came okay so
[1:36:27] that's why he appears
[1:36:30] i can't help myself
[1:36:33] that he appears as in that sun
[1:36:37] name again as
[1:36:40] son of man in our day because
[1:36:43] that's the son that
[1:36:46] calls us back
[1:36:53] okay that's what it's doing what's he
[1:36:55] doing
[1:36:56] do you understand how this message
[1:36:58] starts to reconcile
[1:37:00] you coming in the flesh and breaks down
[1:37:02] the enmity
[1:37:04] that you have between your spirit and
[1:37:06] your flesh
[1:37:07] oh church
[1:37:11] hallelujah yeah i'm a sinner
[1:37:16] okay yeah i'm a mess yeah i'm messed up
[1:37:20] but blessed be to god he planned it that
[1:37:22] way
[1:37:23] and then he forgave me and he put my
[1:37:25] name on the lamb's book of life
[1:37:27] he says now that's the way it is with
[1:37:29] the christian
[1:37:30] hallelujah we know when we walk into the
[1:37:34] presence of god
[1:37:36] there's something in us
[1:37:39] telling us that we come from
[1:37:43] somewhere and we're going back again
[1:37:47] by the power that's upholding us
[1:37:50] that's why only the predestinated
[1:37:55] can be redeemed because they're the only
[1:37:58] ones that
[1:37:59] recognize the pull
[1:38:03] of the son of man ministry
[1:38:07] and anyway amen
