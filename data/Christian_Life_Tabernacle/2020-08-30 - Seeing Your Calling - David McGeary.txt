Description:
Seeing Your Calling
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Service: August 30,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
lord we ask lord that if there's anything in our hearts and our minds lord that would separate us from your word lord that you would remove it lord as the word comes forth lord let us be able to look at it and say identify with that lord that's me that's me lord right there [Music] father as we lift up our voices and praise lord let it be from our hearts lord that we may worship you in spirit and in truth for we know there's angels gathered around you that can that can sing praises unto you father but but we're here as a redemption father that your blood has cleansed us lord lord we come before you lord look into that blood lord for our salvation and the grace that you've given us father let our hearts cry out to you father the love and the adoration that we have for you and lord in these days father we ask these things lord in jesus christ's name amen amen amen we've been happy to be gathering the presence of the living god i want to welcome everyone all our visitors god bless you this morning as invited by the mic for us so i'm reading amen good morning we'll go ahead and turn to psalm 120 this morning you know when we talk about david a lot of things pop into our mind a lot of characteristics you know we think of things like david was a man after god's own heart and how he was used as a standard and example of what every kingdom should be through the history of israel but you know it's one thing that does not come to mind when you think of david as him being a liar that isn't the first thing that pops in the mind and yet if we look at psalm 120 and verse 2 here's his cry out to the lord deliver me deliver my soul o lord from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue and you know we've got to thinking about that and and just looking at what a lie is you know it's not necessarily just a pattern of dishonesty or purposeful dishonesty but it's allowing your lips to be a carrier of something that's not the truth even if you don't intend it to be and it's interesting to me that as he's crying out to the lord he's asking the lord for deliverance from this don't let my lips don't let my tongue be something that's a carrier of something that's not truth or is deceitful you know and that looking at that cry you know it's if you look even at webster's dictionary a lie as something that's a false impression whether you believe it or not it can even be unintentional but it could become a you can become a vessel or an instrument of of sharing something like this and you know the thing is for us it's the same for us you know there's only one truth there's the truth and we know from the scripture that a lie is only one word away so how we should be so careful to make sure that what comes forth out of our witness out of our narrative the message we bring the the the testimony we bring is not one word off from the truth right in first corinthians 14 10 it says there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification we're surrounded by narratives by voices by messages by witnesses and in if we're not careful we can take one up and make it part of our message and in so doing turn his message into dishonesty or falsehood right you know in john 10 verse 4 it says and when he put forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers you know this what other truth is there but the word right there is no other truth in fact you know it says that um you know he says deliver my soul from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue i like the way that brother david put it a couple weeks ago helped on my unbelief not purposeful disbelief but just help all of the things that i will you know that hinder me being able to speak forth and realize the whole truth you know so what should come out of our lips what should our tongue be used for well david talks about that too psalm 17 4 concerning the works of men by the word of thy lips i have kept me from the paths of the destroyer in psalm 119 13 it says with my lips have i declared all the judgments of thyma you know not any other voice but his not any other narrative but his not any other witness but his psalm 119 171 my lips shall utter praise when thou has taught me thy statutes my tongue shall speak of thy word for all thy commandments are righteous you know when i think of that last verse in romans 10 8 the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in my in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach so you know as i got to thinking about that recognizing you know david was not a dishonest man he was not a liar he was quick to repent when he was caught in something but how he feels such a burden that he not get caught up being a bearer of a false witness even unintentionally you know i i pray the same thing for myself and i hope all the rest of us do that we're so careful that as witnesses we're not a witness of somebody else's message for a witness of his message that we don't adopt some other narrative that turns his message into someone else's message right let's not retweet or quote or like or whatever something that does not reflect him right so as we look at that deliver my deliver us from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue let's read that in psalm 120 together just a short psalm in my distress i cried unto the lord and he heard me deliver my soul o lord from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue what shall be given unto thee or what shall be done unto thee thou false tongue sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper woe is me that i sojourn in message that i dwell in the tents of ketter my soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace i am for peace but when i speak there for war amen god bless you may have your seeds amen let's sing such love that god will love a sinner such as i am that god should love us [Music] oh [Music] uh

father we ask that you bless us teach us and lead us and guide us in all truth and righteousness help us this morning father to recognize the wonderful privilege that you have given to us to be here father of your word but not only hearers of your word but doers of your word we ask you to bless us this morning in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen and amen god bless you this morning if you have your bibles let's turn to the first epistle of corinthians and we'd like to read starting in the 17th verse of first corinthians first corinthians 1 and 17. and we just trust the lord will be our portion this morning and that we can be blessed for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath god made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the jew requires a sign and the greek seeketh after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews the stumbling block and unto the greek foolishness but unto them which are called both jew and greek christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than man and the weakness of god is stronger than man for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise after the flesh and not might not many mighty not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confine the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea the things which are not to bring to not the things that are and no flesh should glory in his presence but of him ye are called in christ jesus whom of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord father bless your word in your precious name we pray you may be seated it says in the 26th verse for ye see your calling brethren you see your calling brethren i think that's a wonderful thing for the believer to be able to see their calling and uh that's what we'd like just to kind of uh fellowship a little bit about this morning is uh certainly is our calling what is our calling this morning and i'd like to uh read a few statements this morning and then play a little portion of the sermon to us and kind of build on that and any other man makes this statement and he says now faith is based on forgiveness and so we just heard paul talk about here that he came and he preached to us christ crucified and christ crucified is the forgiveness of sins that him dying on the cross and and giving his life for us and offering to us through that death of calvary resurrection life and he said now the preaching of this to the wise and the prudent of the world is foolishness they don't want to place their hope in that they don't want to place their trust in it but to us it's the wisdom and it it's the revelation and it's the knowledge of god to us it's hope to them they they don't consider it but to us we consider it and all of our trust and all of our hope is placed in the fact that he died for us because upon this principle we can go forward without it we're stuck and that's why you looked at a world today that stuck they don't know how to overcome we see that every word almost out of uh the society today and and uh that's coming out of the mouth of the representatives of our political powers that's coming out of the mouths of everybody that is facing a conflict is they say we're going and we're turning to the science that's what we're looking for we're looking for our hope in science the science will figure it out the the wise will figure it out the doctors will figure it out so all our hope is i hope that these great men uh get this figure out amen aren't you glad that you don't have to wait them to figure it out aren't you glad you got a great physician aren't you glad you've got something that is above anything that man could ever come up with when all hope is given away and all things are gone and science is wore out and intellect is worn out aren't you glad you can look at a cross aren't you glad he died for you aren't you glad that he's real and and so uh the prophet of gods makes this statement in the message perfect faith will listen to a portion this morning now faith is based on forgiveness then so when paul went out and he began to preach he said faith is uh he preached christ crucified because faith is based on forgiveness i want you to hold that there because that's something you can go forward in faith because you are forgiven okay if you can't leave those things which are behind you'll never press for the higher calling that's before you so before we can ever have faith now remember the promise that we have for this age is the restoration of the faith of our fathers and that faith being returned back to the children so there's going to be a relationship and a restoration of the faith of our fathers and the children and they're going to come back into the same thing that they that was in the beginning that the church was built on the church would that would be restored back to the church and the thing that that place is is based on calvary because god only has one place that he meets the believer and that's under the shed blood so you've got to know that that blood that blood of the cross that blood of the lamb i i kind of make this picture in my mind for myself i'll i'll share my little picture with you and you'll find out that i have a lot of ways to comfort myself but i know my shortcomings i know my failures i know my weaknesses and so this side of my life i stand here and here's david mcgary and paul would say that when i would do good evil is with me in other words he says that satan is always with you he's always buffeting you he's always tempting you he's always laying everything out in front of you but i picture my life and all my failures and my weaknesses and my frustration and i picture the uh like a great painter uh taking a brush and dipping it in and i look at the lord dipping his brush in the blood of the lamb and just painting over my life with the blood of the lamb that covering that part of my life up that he doesn't see that part of my life there's a blood covering there there's a lamb has painted that and blotted that out of my life and so i i i when as long as he looks through that he sees the forgiveness and my red sins through red blood he said red through red makes it white as snow but if i step out from under that blouse oh my can i i try to do it on my own righteousness paul said don't do that your righteousness is his filthy rise he is our righteousness just climb back underneath the blood of the lamb the forgiveness i've been forgiven that's all that we've got i've been forgiven we don't have any righteousness but we have forgiveness therefore faith is based upon forgiveness you can have faith because you're forgiven now this uh this stands out to me and it motivates me this morning to share this in my heart it said now faith is based on forgiveness and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we can really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger for and and i i we talked about thirsting and hungering and he said that's what we're really uh hungering for because why are we hungering that apostolic times would be moving back in our things that we can see the apostolic times we can see it moving and flowing through us because the seed in us calls for the promise amen that's right that's what you hunger for you can only hunger for a deep that's calling for a deep there's got to be a deep to respond so if there's a promise to the seed that that there's going to be a faith of our father's restored then naturally that seed has a built-in desire in it to thirst after what's promised it that's what our call is that's what our hunger is that's what we're placed here that's what we're promised and therefore there's something in us that hungers and thirsts for the apostolic move of god in our lives now it goes beyond that god had a purpose for putting that there he put he had a purpose for placing that thirst within us and that's what he said he said now because you see your calling you're never going to move until you see your calling you're dead in the water until you see your calling see means to understand he said it doesn't mean to see with your eyes it means to understand with your heart you'll never go forward until that you have a revelation of what that you've been called for so let's listen as he speaks these things he says he says trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's all right now if the messenger is trying to get the church to that place where we see apostolic times moving among us then i i think if a man's gonna preach this gospel he ought to have the same motive and objective that the giver of the message has because without that we have what denominations are they're men that took this gospel and for their own motives and their own objectives and their own reasoning and their own purpose and their own glory they manipulated the gospel that's why in paul in corinthians says i baptized none of you saved this house in this house because the wisdom of man is not if any man glory let them glory in christ well if you're going to glory in him you have to glory in his purpose you have to glory in his reason and that's what this messenger was sent for he was sent that the apostolic faith the faith of our fathers would move in us again but let us read further and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see it more of it we want we want it such a flow till it will be a help to us and flow out to others he says we see it right at the door and we did we saw it at the door we suck out to the door you understand we saw when the discernment went forth we just saw when the sick were healed we saw it when it began to move out in the world and telling us that he's the same yesterday today and forever behold i stand at the door and knock if any man open i will come unto him and open the evening and sup with him so we saw this saw it at the door we saw him knocking we saw him we saw the signs we saw the restoration we saw the message of restoration we saw it at the door but it's just now we want more of it we want to get to the place where we're walking in at that one it'll help us because it always begins at the household of faith that's right why should we talk about healing the world if we don't have healing in our midst why should we talk about delivering the sinner if we don't have our children delivered why should we talk about doing this and so you're talking about something you don't have that you don't experience so what the first place we got to do is charity begins at the household of faith so we want more of it so can help us help our loved ones first of all we've got to make it real here it's got to become real and i i think that's what he said he said we got to have it moving so it's got to become real not something we're talking about i i wanted to save this statement but i think i'll i'll just put it in right here if the lord would help me we're talking about something that's real he says therefore he said he's talking about a man that he prayed for brother bran prayed for this baby and it had club feet he said it was terribly deformed he said and i prayed for it and he said the next day i was in town and i saw the man shopping for shoes for that baby i don't remember if it was brother mitchell or but the man came to brother braham's meetings carrying a pair of new shoes and he was uh he was diagnosed with black lung and brother branham called them out and uh he in his heart he said i don't uh i'm i'm going to wear these new shoes you know what i mean and he he made a move by faith and i meant the man he said when i went there he said i just knew it and so we've got to make this church you understand we've got to get out of the intellectual side of this message we've got to rise to higher ground we've got to rise to higher heights and that was the sin of nickelodeonism the people let the ministry rise to a higher height they let go they let they pick somebody and they say well we'll let him pray for the sick we'll let him do the work we'll let him do this and him do that and everything and now that then after they did that they empowered them they gave them the power god never intended to share his glory with any man with any system with any group of men this is an individual affair [Applause] and i'll pray for you as a christian but don't make me pray for you as a priest i'll forgive your sins because the bible tells me to forgive your sin but don't make me a confessor i mean we got to take up your responsibility so listen what he said he said like this man over here that believed that god would give him a baby sure he believed it it was going to happen he made ready for it i'm making ready although no physical results seen as yet but that didn't make a bit of difference he believed it like abraham call anything contrary as though it was not there now this is what we've got to move past now and brother braham says this is a stinger but i believe he really cared for us don't you didn't we just listen to standing in the gap where he said i'd lost the feeling of the people and i just wanted to go out and and do it and we just got done listening to that and reading that and talking about that how that that he said you've done the same thing moses did you lost the feeling of the people well why did the holy spirit you know god's orchestrating these things when he tells us he says hey don't lose the feeling of the people well i'm praying the other day and i i get i get i have a lot of complexes i deal with because i'm not educated and i don't have a good vocabulary and and okay my mind i i got just my mind can't multitask and i'll be talking to somebody and something will come on my mind and walk away right in the middle of the congregate you know a conversation and and so all these things come up of course then i go get the message perfect strength and perfect weakness you can't use that as an excuse and you can't use your talents as a screw my grace is sufficient for you but i prayed and i said lord where can i lead the people where should i lead them in which direction should i take them i really want to know i mean if i'm a shepherd and and if you stay in the same spot you'll lead up the grass you know and then you just keep adding seasoning to the same stuff you know what i mean like it becomes like leftovers you know so you got left what do you have today well it's chicken cacciatore well you have chicken casserole you know chicken tacos chicken this chicken that you become like a chinese buffet you know 450 ways to do chicken it's the same chicken you know i want to move i want to know i'm going in the right direction i want to be able to say lord i let you i said lord where where would you have me lead the people what direction where where should this congregation be going now i know this is going to astound you well maybe it won't astound you but it it it almost couldn't get up off the ground with the answer i said where would you love lord teach me speak to me where would you like them for me to lead this congregation and his answer to me was to the public what i thought we're supposed to be running from the world unboxing i'm supposed to lead them you're saying to the public lead them to the public then you begin to show me why and so that's what i want to share with you today this is what this is about this is about the rapture now listen what he said therefore your intellect does tell you oh here's the stinger now if your intellect does tell you that this is the truth god is the healer of the sick your mind can witness that that that's the truth but if there's not the betting ground in your heart faith to fall in to express it it will not happen so that's the difference it's different if we all sit here in our mind and in our intellect and say that's the truth that's the truth god's a healer that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth we intellectually can witness it that that's the truth and that's what the prophet of god said he said when it's in your mind and then it drops from your mind into your heart into that bedding ground where it can grow he says then it becomes the will of god then you know it then you can say not only is it the truth but now i can act upon it i can express it and what good as if if we have no record of expression because he said that this church this elect lady this bride would have a book of acts written after it okay now we we we got we we we've talked about that betting ground we've talked about that seed so he he we go we go in and we listen and so we we desire for those apostolic times to be moving we should be thirsting and hungering to be a people that lays our hands on the sick and they recover we should be a people that longs for when we kneel down to pray that we touch the hem of his garment and whatsoever things you ask or whatever things you see knock and it shall be opened unto you seek and you shall find in no wise will i cast you out and i don't mean alive in a few i mean alive in the body we're a body fitted and joined together each member supplying a need to the other we're all going to go i don't want to leave anybody behind we need everybody's participation we need everybody in their place everybody that's what i could that's a sermon in itself about the great watch he said though you might see the face like we're a great watch this morning i might be the the digital timepiece or the face but it's all the moving parts behind it that move the hands you you take out the little spring you take out this you take out that it can that clock it should what good is if it always says nine o'clock what time is it nine o'clock well later with that nine o'clock where's the church at nine o'clock we're at the same place the same time getting the same read just nine o'clock granny where are you guys at where's your church at nine o'clock what do you talk about nine o'clock why because something's not fixed something's not working something's not in its place what good does it do to have a watch since we're using that as a type and a battery if there's nothing that's calling for the juice from the battery like like the truck right or the car it's got to have the spark well i experienced that this morning my truck's got the spark but i ran out of the dynamics coasted from halfway in central into the driveway around to the back and my trucks laying there dead as a doornail because there's no gas now my truck told me how many miles to empty zero and i made it and if i didn't make it i was gonna walk but you know you understand there there had to be a call so i ran out of gas god hasn't run out of gas god hasn't run out of power god hasn't run out of jews god hasn't run out of electricity i just wonder is there anything calling for it is there anything thirsting after it we have not because we asked not and we asked not because there's a reason it's important that is freed i want you to get this now the church has got to lift itself into the power of god that's a statement see we always teach it if you if you don't have the power of god you're not a believer i hope we put that to a rest i've tried to preach it for several sundays you are believers we even went back to the evidence of election to go back over that before you even knew you were elected he was working the process on you he made he convicted you he made you miserable you were hungering and thirsting you were longing for something all these things was the hand of god in your life before you ever came to the realization and revelation that you were a christian or a believer because while you were yet sinners he died for you so while you were yet a sinner he had to purchase you well you were lost he had to seek you you didn't choose me i chose you so though his work has been going on for a long time but now this is a different approach this is a different message this isn't salvation we've settled that amen this isn't the mind acknowledging its truth this is it dropping into the betting ground the heart that there's something in us amen that wants to bear the fruit that we've been chosen and elected to bear that oh my goodness you see when he went up to that fig tree he went to take figs it didn't matter if that fig tree said who are you fig tree my daddy was a fig tree his grandfather was a fig tree we can go all the way back to egypt says you're barren and unfruitful and he cursed the fig tree and they came back and says master look at the fig tree it's all dried up and because i want you to know all them that are barren and unfruitful will be plucked up so we've been preaching and saying it's not who you are it's what you are he had no evidence that he was a fig tree no expression that it was a fig tree when they came to jesus and the only evidence they could see was a man he says you a man yet not being 30 years of age or 50 years of age they said but you say before abraham was i am oh yeah and when he came down he said if you can't believe me for my word's sake believe me for my works because i do nothing unless the father reveals it to me so he's talking he says here now he says we've got the church has got to lift itself up into the power of god how we are too close to the end now and i believe the church is in the condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub some of this make belief out see and get into something real see it's got to be something that you know got to be something that do you know now we're going to stop right here before we go further and we're going to listen to 11 minutes that's all it's not too long a perfect faith and these 11 minutes are going to be emphasized on the foundation of your faith in other words lifting yourself up and he's going to mention about who you are and he uses more than who you are he says what you are what you are you've got to believe what god has made you you've got to believe what you are what you are we don't go forward i don't know why maybe it's because we keep stepping out from behind the blood instead of letting that blood be our righteousness because our faith is based on that blood covering amen why can you do why can you pray for the sick because i have power no he said well how are you going to get results look at you nope uh-uh i've got a blood covering you see this shield that i'm covered in you see this blood that's over my life over my failures when did he put it there well you were yet a sinner before you were saying he died for you where did he put it there he put it there in the back way back in the beginning when sin came so did the covering he said i'll make enmity between thy seed in the woman's seed i'll bruise your heel he had that savior planned there all along he had that blood covering for the church there all along that's the only place that god will meet you meet your prayers meet any requests that you have god only meets the believer under the shed blood that's god's provided place of worship you can't prove your faith no more than you can prove your love it's the only one way is through expression now let's just listen to this 11 minutes because we we want to build on this if the lord will help is this 11 minutes is enough and i would love to play so much more but if we can just listen to this 11 minutes and then and go for it and you can go home and listen to the rest of it just listen and he's going to talk to in the first statement the story is that the disciples have just brought the boy with epilepsy to jesus and said master your disciples could not cast them out and they asked him how come we couldn't cast him out and he rebuked them and said because you believe not in other words they didn't they hadn't gone down to the bedding ground and so this is where he picks up the story and he's he's talking about and the first words now remember they had the power jesus had given them the power i i believe that's where we're going to start is paragraph 55 in perfect faith let's just listen to this 11 minutes lord willing god bless you i remember they had this house jesus had given them power the healer was sick to raise the dead and cast out devils just a few days before that yeah they had the power but not the faith to use the power now there's the brandon tabernacle there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is shared with the power but you haven't got that faith see what i mean amen it takes faith to move it here i got a shell that i hand loaded i know what it'll do by ballistics like the word but i've got to fire the gun the fire has to get to the powder the powder's got the power that's got to have the fire to light off and the same thing that powers in the shell but it needs bait to charge it and throw it out that's what it takes the perfect faith to ignite the power of the holy spirit which we have now since he's come upon us ever faith to ignite to see great things to the faith something that presents it to you or the heart full of joy you walk into the stick room knowing exactly what you're going to say know what's going to happen something's already been revealed and you know it when you walk in in the name of jesus christ rise up from there say unto the lord there you are that's a perfect faith if there's these 10 million people standing wouldn't happen you know what's going to happen anyhow because you know it it's going to happen regardless what anybody else says you're the ones got the faith could you imagine joshua he called the elders of israel together and said uh brethren we are the servants of the lord i would like for you to say uh ask the lord if it'd be all right if uh if he'd give us a little more sunlight see and hold his son a little while no he has need of it and without prayer without anything he had need of it and he just commanded the son he said stand there i have need and i'm in the service of the lord and he sent me over here to do this job and i'm doing the best i don't know how and the enemy is routed and they're out in here if i let the sun go down they'll get together and cause me more trouble so stand still [Applause] moon [Applause] now if the world's turning it holds it up and the sun stays in the place and it don't run what happened then amen now you make yourself a infidel if you say of this and then if you don't you shouldn't full of science because they said the world stop and drop from now on if you say god's word's not right then you're in for them [Applause] i don't know the mechanics of the holy ghost but i know it fell on me i can't tell the mechanics of it but i know the blessings of it is the blessing of the holy ghost and it mechanically works that much is secret this lord cannot be healed because the disciples had power jesus gave them power to heal all manner of sickness to cast out devils to cleanse the efforts and to raise the dead and he gave them power but they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had and then they questioned jesus and said well now why couldn't we do it now remember they had the word and the word was flesh down and the word told them i give you power heaven amen i give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them amen see what i mean but jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen and man so bring him here how long will he suffer he has faith with his power how did he he said i can do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and it was in him and that giving faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this and here the scripture is hiding to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what god had made him amen and if he did that then can't we rely upon what god made us as believers these signs shall follow in that belief he had faith and what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer and if you've got faith in god the bible says over here and uh if our uh if our hearts condemn us then we can have faith but if our hearts don't condemn us then we have faith we have confidence towards god if you want to read that found saint john 3 21. i got the scripture written down there my moment then i mean first john 3 21 uh notice if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards god but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards god so you see you can you automatically know that you're wrong you're already not going to put yourself back here a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you are a believer and there's nothing between you and god because that's what you will and know that it will be given because it's the word that's given to you just like it was to those disciples now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are and have faith in what the word says you are and jesus had faith in the word of god that says what he was it is written of me didn't david and the psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him i am the bread of life that come from god out of heaven amen i am the tree of life from the garden of eden i have all these things i am that i am and he knew that a perfect faith that he was the unknown messiah that the spirit of god was upon him he said now i myself do nothing but it's my faith in god and god presenting the word made manifest and when the word of god comes in you it's made manifest or you are a believer see and a believer is the faith of god that moves in you you like that i like when you all right before the how to what faith really is knowing who he was without a shadow doubt he knew he was the son of god he knew it for the word identified the word of god identified who he was he said if i do not the worst of my father then don't believe me but if if i don't do them works don't believe me but if i do then believe the worst for they are the manifested word prompt or if you just wake up to that you see the word itself identified who you are and he said who can condemn me and stand in other words who can show me that my life and my works don't fulfill exactly what messiah should do nobody could say nothing for he was then he had faith to believe that whatever he said it would happen then he turned around and said the works that i do show you also a little while the world sees me more yet you shall because i'll be with you even in you take no thought once you shall save for it's not you to speak it's that father that dwells in you he's the one doesn't speak it's not me it's the father that dwells in me he doeth the word see what i mean now the identification of a scripture christian these words said jesus these signs shall follow them i believe now how can you call yourself a believer of people and deny those words how can you call yourself a believer and deny any of this one right you can't do it you're not a believer therefore signs can't follow because you just accept what you want to believe and that the rest of it you want don't believe but you've got to take the whole thing and believe that amen and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs follow them they believe oh could you compare christians today with them christians of long ago how them disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the holy ghost to go just a prisoner as i preached on the other night a prisoner to the word and will of god he couldn't even move until god moved wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that it's going to go back it's got identifies himself what he was and the same word identifies us if a man loves me he keeps my commandments and if he says he loves me keeps not my commandments that's all of me he's alive amen and the truth's not even anymore you say well i don't believe well then that you're just not a believer that's all if the bible said so that makes it right amen what the bible says is the truth notice or he said to us if you abide me in my wording you think john 15 you're here by me see and faith in him give by me and my word abides in you then you ask what you will now see he knew who he was therefore he had faith faith could produce when he knows what he was now if he abides me and my word in you then you know where you are amen that's what you will it'll be given to you wouldn't that be a wonderful night if everybody come to that prayer line and say i am a christian i have no condemnation i i know that my heart can then something tells me that the night's the end of my suffering amen no matter how much you come in emotion how much you do it won't work until that perfect faith has manifested and identified itself in you as the substance and when it's there then nothing's going to shake you from it if if you had cancer and the doctor told you yesterday that you'd be dead before i hope you noticed that little part in there that kept coming up who you are but not only who you are what you are what you are what you are and you and he said can't you believe what god made him he knew who he was he knew what he was he knew what the scripture said about him so we also see and this is the things that that were we're trying to to uh drive to listen listen this last little part he says he says oh could you compare a christian today with them christians of long ago now that's a good question and a good challenge so that's what we we got to see see we're talking about positioning ourselves what it's going to take so we know that this is promised to us because if it doesn't happen then there never was a restoration amen no matter how much you want to say the works identified brother branham's works identified him as the messenger it vindicated what he said that what he was and what he fulfilled but you are the identification of the restoration you understand there's a part of the word that you identify there's a part of the word that you fulfill look he said let's compare the church so we say restoration brother bran preach restoration the faith of the fathers and we say he did this miracle he did that miracle he did that miracle he did that miracle that vindicates him there's nobody can doubt that william branham was a prophet now some might not believe he was a true prophet but he was a prophet he did the works of a prophet he prophesied of a prophet there's not one time he ever said thus saith the lord that it failed that vindicated him and it vindicated the word that he preached but you are the manifestation of the message if you believe the message if you believe what he said about a church if you believe what he said about the promise if you believe it not agree that it's the truth but you're willing to let that go through all doubts all confusions all voices and let it drop into the bedding ground of that heart to where it brings forth the fruit that's what we want look let's just go over the promise again how them disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the holy spirit to do it just a prisoner as i preached the other night a prisoner to the word and will of god he couldn't even move until god moved them wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that first question wouldn't you like to see a church like that come back wouldn't you like to see if your loved one a family member an uncle and aunt was given to alcohol or something wouldn't you love to have a church amen no people that could make a difference if the devil had intellectually gone out and sowed all kinds of confusion to the mind now i want you to understand this a lot of people out there agreed in their mind but they never took it to expression you understand they never took it to works or to the expression of what was there it never dropped into the bedding ground of their heart to produce faith because remember once it hits that bedding ground it can never be moved but as long as it's in their head and you can't blame them because the church has been living at nine o'clock so long that they got tired of nine o'clock and now the critic came up and said you're still at nine o'clock you're still at nine o'clock look this didn't happen brother branham didn't tell the proof that was a rocket ship and there's no newspaper that says anybody fell off of the fell off of the bridge and you know he just made that up and such and such didn't get well and on and on and on they go but your evidence isn't in his vindication your evidence is in your vindication [Applause] i know because i've tasted of the restoration what he talked about lives then they don't have to look in an old newspaper they don't have to look at a history they don't have to look at a scot they see the word they manifest in flash [Applause] [Music] there's a reason for it now there's a reason he said take it to the public take it to the hall of critics take it to the proving station i can say it's gold well how would you like to have a bucket full of fool's gold how'd you like to haul these years been buying fool's gold i started collecting silver dollars and i thought i'm pretty good at serving one day a guy said something that just shook my boots he said you got to be careful there's a lot of fakes out there i mean i could have bought a fake one i didn't buy anything after that that wasn't certified that's genuine anybody can say it okay you understand there's a reason i hope i can just we're just going to sing tonight okay we're going to have hallelujah time everybody go home and drink tea and honey he said wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that it's going to it's going back it's got to come that's right it's on its road now i believe hello there's a prophet he said it's on its road now when he says it's on its road don't get all upset that it's been 50 years isaiah said a virgin shall conceive 800 years on the road but it got there [Music] [Applause] you can't tell me this church is here now it springs up like that little lady that had lost all her hair i love her testimony and they prayed for her one day she pulled her cap off there's a little old crop of hair now she's got long beautiful hair why because jesus christ is the same yesterday and she dared to believe what god said they're scattered testimonies you understand but it's not about somebody else it's about when you get to the place he said what he's done for others he can do for me so it's on its way it's coming we've got to believe that do you believe that so why did he say faith is built is based on forgiveness what's the first step of a believer's journey justification you can because he forgave you what's the second step sanctification that's where the body's having its trouble that's where our problem is that's where my problem is that's where it's all our problems is when we know we're not doing right our heart condemns us but you got to know this if he's justful and faithful to forgive your sins if you'll confess them don't try to walk out under the painted blood covering and try to display your own righteousness do you think god don't seek everything that we are the only reason he doesn't wipe us out because he loves us he loves us so much he gave his only begotten son that through his blood our sins could be covered and forgiven if we're faithful and just to confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive them don't sit on your wrongdoing get down before god and start confessing your sins and making your life right because he wants to empower you he promised he would empower you and after justification there's sanctification he provides the power to overcome that's right don't you see the wisdom of god he said though by the wisdom of god god made it that you couldn't know him by wisdom god no he said i don't know the mechanics of it i just know that i've got it that felt me but look at the wisdom of god first of all he let you experience justification so if you know that he forgive your sins that same justifying power is what helps you sanctify your life the same faith that justified you the same blood that justifies you the same blood that sanctifies you but what do we go do we all go try to sanctify ourselves and therefore we don't spend no time with them we don't spend no time reading we don't get in the spirit there's nothing like getting in the spirit there's nothing like raising your hands and just getting lost in the spirit you know i come up with a bunch of hippies you know that believed in the lord but i'll tell you one thing we could do we could get in the spirit we'd all get together and say you know that we are christians by our love by our love oh you'll know that we are christians by our love and unknown pretty soon we are floating we were worshiping the lord we had visions of his goodness in our eyes you know we are doing we are opening the door for transforming power we are opening the door for him to come in and bring us under conviction and give us revelation you've got to get past the intellectual amen to the word and say lord i want what's there to drop into a betting ground where it can be expressed but so he does justification so you can understand the working power of sanctification and then once you've experienced sanctification it moves you in because by experience you've experienced it you know it's real it's the lion it's the bear so now you can come and meet the giant now you can know you can be glorified not you glorified but him glorified in you because you saw him do sanctification you saw him do justification now you based on those two experiences you're willing to take on the goliath and manifest the power of resurrection but if you got a crack in those so no wonder satan tempts us so bad have you ever seen an age when there's so much sin at a press of a button you better not do a computer search and misspell a word i advise as your pastor separate yourself from social media just my advice the stuff i've seen on social media is unbelievable people make comments that they don't even realize and they've been permanently placed in there i've got enough bad stuff on the record that i'm writing in heaven not enough to have all kinds of people in the world bearing witness i don't know nothing about facebook but i only want one face on my book i don't know nothing about twitter tweeter all i know it's a spirit feeder you know people text me and i don't answer their text for for five days and they come to why text you call me i don't want a secondhand revelation i don't want something that i have to interpret give me the experience can you imagine jesus text you from heaven you've been justified no so we we can't understand he's done that now this is why it strikes me because this is what the prophet of god says he's talking about this faith he's talking about this place that you come to that you don't consider anything else but the word of god and he makes this comment in regards to that he says when a man lives by faith and walks by faith so we we we've we've gone through that so we already we've got the definition of faith now is a man that believes what that he is what that god made him your faith is not based on the intellectual mind that says that it's true your faith is built on as he as he said here he says when the word of god comes in you it's manifested it manifests as you are a believer when the word of god comes to you it manifests that you are a believer the word didn't come to you for your intellectual vain acknowledgement that it's truth satan believes that and he fears and trembles the word of god came to you we preached it last week is to manifest to you that you are a believer if you don't accept that you're stuck at nine o'clock you don't have the power you believe it but you don't got the faith to operate the power he gave you where does the faith come to operate the power when you recognize what you are when you recognize yourself i'm a believer i believe this now listen what he says faith is he says as you are a believer and a believer is the faith of god that moves in you now so he's telling us we've majored am i am i like screaming am i okay i feel like i'm yelling at you but we've majored in the faith as being that intellectual part of us that says it's true it's true it's true it never came for us to acknowledge it was true it was true before ever god didn't need you to say it was true he sent it so that you would understand that that seed that's in you said amen i believe it's true here but now i want it to drop into the bedding ground of expression because works is faith expressed so he says this okay and you heard him you heard him say this he said let me find it right here he says here i've got a shell that i hand loaded i know what it i know what it'll do by ballistics like the word so he says here's his bullet he said this bullet will travel at 3 000 pounds per second it'll carry 150 grain bullet 200 yards flat it'll fall 50 feet for every so many feet it's got the ballistics how much barrel pressure how much everything he said i know that by the word that's like the word we know that by the word we know the ballistics everybody in this message knows the ballistics here's what we're not doing he says he said i i handle i know what it'll do by the ballistics like the word but i've got to fire the gun i've got to pull the trigger we've got all this power that's given us we got all the ballistics we're ballistic experts we know every quote but what we're not doing is we're not firing the gun so you've got a sick person that's here god's a healer god's a healer god's a healer god healed this one you got to go fire the gun lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover it's got to be expressed sometime who are you that's the question who's sitting here this morning i just wrote down a few things and i'm going to try to close because i think this is something that i can just go on forever because it's rich it's coming to me and say what are you going to get out of this brother mcgary the first thing i'm getting out of this is i'm going to start sanctifying my life i'm tired of wrong coming up and me knowing i'm wrong brother brown went to pray for somebody and just a little bothered him so what are you gonna do about old man i'm gonna put him under the blood i'm gonna bring him back under the blood and then i'm going to start trying to live upright and then i'm going to recognize that i've got a call do you all know you got a call this is what paul said for you see your calling brethren amen how not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty men not many noble men are called but he's chosen you amen do you see your calling he's got a calling and so we now we see that faith is not the intellectual acknowledgement of the word but faith comes down to the word has sent so you know what you are what you are what did he place in this last stage in perfect faith god said in every age god has a promise for that age then he predestinates somebody there to meet that promise and bring it to pass that message is called proving his word so you who you are what you are is the provers of god's word you're the elected chosen people that are elected created and made to express the restoration of the faith of the fathers it's been on its road we saw it at the door but now it's coming because it's got to come and it's going to come so this is what this is where our perfect faith comes from it's not the perfect faith in the word it's the faith that you are the manifestation of that word abraham didn't consider his body being dead he didn't consider abraham sarah's body being dead he didn't consider everything that's what the prophet of god said to resist the devil means to walk away not to consider he didn't consider anything he considered what god said he said god chose me to be the father of many nations and that the heir to salvation is going to come and abraham believed what god told them now when are we listen what brother brahm says what are we we are the children of abraham hallelujah not as isaac was but his royal seed in other words not the natural seed of abraham not all israel is israel but the royal sea we are the faith seed of abraham we are the possessors of the same faith that abraham had anybody believe that about yourself okay so what did we hear this morning we got to start putting that faith in the gun we start got to start firing it we are the children of abraham hallelujah not as isaac was but the royal seed through christ jesus by the faith that he had abraham's seed coming forth in the last days to shine like the stars abraham's children considering not his own body now dead neither considering it was even brought into question whether god would do it or not god said he would do it why it was a revelation to him that's right when it's revealed to you when it when you can make you can't make it happen it's got to be revealed to you then you don't even consider anything else how impossible it is don't consider what the doctor said don't consider what mama said or what papa said or what the preacher says it's it's what anybody else could say it's just considered what god said amen and can and that's what he said he says he said when you get there i like to read this statement again when he says when you get there he says i mean the substance of faith he's isolated from the total world and becomes a new creature in christ jesus and there now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into rapturing condition now now the bride's got to lift itself up by the boots it's got to get in rapturing condition so why is it important that this church takes on the faith of the fathers and begins to express it and fire the gun and have the apostolic power moving in their midst flowing out to others why is that important that this resurrection power in life is manifested to the believer and this restoration comes because that is what produces rapturing faith because without the works your faith is dead in other words if this church isn't carrying out and manifesting the faith of the disciples of the apostles our fathers if it's not shooting the gun if it's not going into all the world preaching the gospel if it's not expressing what it believes it's not in rapturing condition so the very substance of our rapture lies in the manifestation of the promised word in our lives recognizing what we are and what are you you are the children of abraham the royal seed you have the fame faith that he did to believe the impossible and not consider anybody else that's what you are let that drop into your heart what are you you are the possessors of eternal life that's what you are if you had eternal life you always had eternal life why would he tell you that because you were going to need it to fulfill the commission of the apostolic move of the spirit and perfect faith manifested in your flesh because without that perfect faith and without that perfect love you will not be apart you won't have the faith the rapture in faith was contained in the revelations of the seventh seal and the third poll i mean we can go back to the history of it but the word was delivered to us specifically telling us that we are that these signs will follow them that believe that's right not believe in the promise that he gave to the disciples not based on that promise of a reproduction but based on the faith that i've been called to be the restorer of that i've been called but that's produced in me it's the promise for my day in me i'm not trying to duplicate that i'm not going back there that promise didn't bring me back it brought the promise to me today he restored it back he sent a prophet to go back and get it and bring it to the elected that's called here and say this is what you are you are the person that i've elected to fulfill this don't have nothing to do with the history he's raised up out of history he's a living god what are you you are the carriers of the light it shall be light in the evening time the path to glory you shall surely find you are the carriers of the light you have the light no man light at the candle and set it under a bushel basket but he sets the light on the whole hill i'm wearing you out but i'm going to keep going so i can have rest in my spirit he was the light the world don't know the way but you know the way that's you're the light you are the light yes amen you are the word the bride and the bridegroom become one we've heard all these things every single one of them is who you are what you are you are the light that's what you are you are the light oh if you could just look in the mirror and say i am the light i am eternal life this is what i am this is what he made me can't you believe what god made you can't you believe who you are can't you accept the fact that he elected you and called you to fulfill the commission of the restoration of the church somebody's got it somewhere why can't it be us why can't it be you why can't it be me amen i believe it is amen just kill one or two people you are the carriers of the light to let people see nobody can see without the light the world is lost in gross darkness but it shall be light in the evening time where is that light they'll never read this book until they see the light in you they'll never be moved until there's something that comes from you to move them but that's what you are you are the light he created you to be the light this is what he said you were you well that's what you are you're the carry carrier you are the voice of truth you are the voice the voice of the bride in the last day she's the voice of god you are the voice there's not another voice without you if you read the first thing in first corinthians he said i would that you'd be of all like mind i would that you would all say the same thing i would that you all have the same care one for another hallelujah you are the voice this is a living voice that's just like saying jesus was the voice i'm not going to listen to nothing else but just jesus good luck because he didn't ordain it that way he ordained it from faith to faith the gospel shred spread by faith to faith from revelation to revelation he never took the people out and substituted a tape you said you played a tape i didn't play a historical tape i played living word divine revelation you are the voice of god manifested voice you are the voice the bride has thus saith the lord or she stays still you're the voice nobody can hear without you you are the voice you are the voice you are the light you are eternal life you are the possessors you are the royal seed of abraham that's what god wants you to believe that's where the faith anchors the faith anchors and what he said you are that's what gives you the perfect faith your sins don't take it away they're under the blood your righteousness don't approve it abraham went out and didn't consider anything else because god said so don't let your mind start judging yourself paul said i don't even judge myself nor will i let any man judge me he said so you say well if you're not somebody is so if you're not i'm going to take it amen i'll take your spot because if you don't take it he will give it to somebody else don't think we're going to sit the rest of the way through this and not pull ourselves up by the bootstraps and pull ourselves into the presence of god it's the sign of the real believer these signs shall follow them that believe you'll never have the signs until you believe what you are what else are you you are the witness of a working gospel you are the carriers of the commission go into all the world and preach the gospel how many people you think when luther said were justified by faith still trinitarians that you don't have to pay penance you don't have to vote how many people grabbed that message and ran out to their loved ones and they preached justification how many took wesley's message and ran out and preached sanctification how many have taken the message that was delivered through the prophet of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 and went out and delivered it to the world how many can raise their hand this morning and count five converts on your hand you only need one and you'll get the other four are you ashamed of me before men we're talking about rapture church we're talking about not playing church we're talking about a sanctified people that believe god's word and are putting the bullet the word in the gun and firing the gun they're taking the needle off nine o'clock and they're getting back into the battle that's what brother branham said in standing in the gap i'm going back on the field i lost the feeling of the people then he began to bring that third pole message you begin to bring the things of god to us you can interpret whatever you want or what riding this trail again but i'll guarantee you this message is writing right now producing that living word of god in flesh you're the commission you're the you are the manifestation of the commission in this last day to go into all the world and preach the gospel it is not given to the nickelodeonism given to the bride you sisters can witness the resurrection if it gets to doctrine call your husband call your brother if you are not married call your pastor they can handle the doctrinal side but you are the possessor of the life you are the possessor of the light you are the possessor of the truth that's who you are you are the administrators of the resurrection power what does it do have a box of shells he's called you you are you possess the power of the resurrection you got the truth you're the voice you're all these things manifested in flesh now why does he need that to go to the public because if you can't make that real you will never make the changing of your flesh reel you won't even be in the place where the rapture takes place the prophet of god says you've got to get here to be in rapturing condition you can't get in rapturing condition hear me it ain't i don't care how much you believe this message how much you've got revelation how much you can split the bride coming of christ how you can explain the mysteries show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith by my works how do we make this confession that we're leaving the earth and our bodies have been changed and we're going to bypass the whole step of the church manifesting and the faith of god of the fathers being restored in us and these works follow them that believe who told us this what lying preachers ever thought we could get by with just keeping heaping praise on this message and not doing what it said it would do you believe it jesus said you are my disciples when you keep my commandments when you go into all the world when you forgive your brother or your sister as he forgave you when you don't hold any odd in your heart when you're living for him every morning you're a love slave to him without these signs and wonders manifested in our midst we will never produce rapturing faith it is part of the plan of god that's why at the end he said that he would restore the faith of our fathers be and the works and signs that he did you will do also because it was going to take those things to become real to you in order for the rapture to become to you and to most of you the rapture is a fantasy you no more believe it can happen in the morning than nothing our lives testify to it but you know what we've done we've formed a denomination do you believe in malachi 4 5 oh yes sir do you believe the seals are open oh i forgot this is on the internet blot it out what's wrong with this we've got to make this flesh i've got to have this i've got to press to this i've got to get in that condition the condition of the rapture is the power of the resurrection manifested in flesh if this same spirit was in christ jesus it will quicken your mortal body the prophet of god said if the spirit of a race car driver mario andretti or some race car was in you you would be a race driver if the spirit of michelangelo was in you you would be a painter if the spirit of christ was in you you would do the works that he did whatever made us think that we were going to bypass the works bypass the manifestation bypass the fulfillment of the restoration of the faith of our fathers and make the rapture what ever got that in our mind brother lord clear my brain let me start afresh let me start anew let me get back to hunger and thirst and after righteousness let me get back filled again god with your spirit let me seek a refilling of the holy spirit let me seek the baptism of the holy spirit let me apply the token to my life make sure i'm born again he said that this he said that the believer is the faith of god moving in you you must have a moving faith bottom line we've got to get off the church pews and testify we've got to get off the church view and testify to the sick we've got to get off the church views and lay our hands we've got to lay for ourselves a pattern of good works we've got to make full proof of our calling it's time that the church pulls itself into the power of faith it's promised to us it's at hand it's here we saw the door we've slept with them now manifesting time i don't want to be a church with a catechism i don't want sunday to be bible study and me just talking and talking about the message and all that it does i want there to be living testimony i want there to be living worship i want people that can raise their hands and praise god and shout the glory of god i want the liberty that we have in christ jesus i want us to work on our shortcomings work on our sins start sanctifying ourselves that when we come into the house of the lord there's no condemnation in our midst does anybody believe that's possible
