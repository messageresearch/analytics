[40:00] [Music]
[40:06] has just approached them one more time
[40:08] Heavenly Father
[40:10] [Music]
[40:13] Lord there's nothing that
[40:16] you're unaware of
[40:19] there's no situation that you're not the
[40:22] master of
[40:25] ordering everything that comes our way
[40:28] we know that if we're called according
[40:31] to your purpose father that you will
[40:34] work it to the benefit of the believer
[40:37] father if we would stray in your
[40:39] permissive will
[40:41] Lord you would arrange things that we'd
[40:43] come back to your perfect will
[40:46] that's how steadfast your love for us is
[40:49] we ask you to forgive us our trespasses
[40:52] and be with us tonight we pray in Jesus
[40:56] precious and holy name we pray amen
[41:00] amen God bless you tonight before we
[41:03] invite brother Jim to come I'd like you
[41:07] to keep us in prayer right now as you
[41:10] know my mother
[41:12] she had her 100th birthday and my sister
[41:15] has been
[41:18] living with her but as much of my family
[41:22] over the years uh
[41:25] they battle with alcoholism it's just
[41:27] something that runs in families and in
[41:30] culture and my sisters had a pretty bad
[41:33] relapse and and so now my mom's taking
[41:37] it pretty hard so Leslie's out there
[41:40] also at this time Leslie's sister had
[41:45] well they gave her about six months to
[41:46] live and and they felt that if she would
[41:50] do chemo they might stretch it to a year
[41:55] and of course we do everything we can to
[41:57] live
[41:58] but our real source of life is prayer
[42:01] amen so anyway it's a hard time for us
[42:04] so Leslie's out with our mom and and
[42:07] we're just trusting God will give us a
[42:09] solution of course I'd love to bring my
[42:12] mom home
[42:13] here with me but she's still pretty good
[42:16] shape so we just trust that the Lord
[42:19] will take care of it you know we just
[42:22] had a great Revival didn't we at great
[42:24] time in the Lord and I was kind of
[42:27] feeling uh I was kind of feeling I don't
[42:30] know what do you call it after you have
[42:32] a great meeting you just kind of feel
[42:34] that little lull spot afterwards you
[42:36] know and I thought oh man I I can't
[42:39] preach I just don't know what I'd say
[42:40] and everything and the whole God sends
[42:43] me an angel
[42:45] amen so he's going to keep the revival
[42:48] going and we all love brother Jim but
[42:51] I'd like to read this little statement
[42:53] it's been read in this church many a
[42:56] Time
[42:57] uh before brother Jim comes it's uh in
[42:59] paragraph
[43:00] 166 out of the superson
[43:03] it says brothers and sisters we are
[43:06] living in the days of supermarkets super
[43:11] jets
[43:12] super highways super races super
[43:17] everything else
[43:19] and there is a super sign
[43:22] we've had the sign of religion
[43:25] we've had the sign of Revival
[43:28] we've had the sign of getting together
[43:32] we've had the sign of speaking in
[43:34] tongues we've had the sign of Healing
[43:37] The Sick
[43:38] we've had all these signs
[43:41] but yet we find in the Bible
[43:45] that the last sign before the promised
[43:49] Sun arrives it was a super sign
[43:53] Jesus says As as it was then before the
[43:58] promised son arrived that super sign
[44:01] would come on Earth again
[44:04] I declare to you tonight in the name of
[44:08] Jesus Christ it's on the earth now
[44:12] not only that but it's right here among
[44:16] us tonight
[44:17] the Holy Ghost God's super sign the
[44:22] resurrected Jesus Christ it cannot fail
[44:26] it's an eternal sign it can never be
[44:30] changed
[44:32] Heaven and Earth will pass away but that
[44:35] will never change it's an eternal
[44:39] Everlasting sign God manifested in human
[44:44] flesh God made himself known in human
[44:48] flesh do you believe that's true
[44:51] with all your heart do you believe it
[44:55] don't shut yourself up like a turtle in
[44:59] a shell
[45:00] if there is any turtle in you take the
[45:04] shell out let the Holy Spirit come in
[45:09] don't close yourself to some Creed or
[45:13] denomination but brother sister the hour
[45:16] has arrived
[45:18] I believe that God has done as much
[45:22] as he's going to do the next thing is
[45:27] action of the church or either we're
[45:31] going to be lost
[45:34] I just that strikes me and that's where
[45:37] my heart is Lord what would my action be
[45:41] what's the action of the church
[45:44] amen is going to return back to the
[45:47] Great Commission and go out and preach
[45:49] this gospel doing signs and wonders
[45:52] following the believer
[45:54] amen
[45:56] I believe there's a lot of exciting
[45:58] things and I think that brother Jim's
[46:00] here tonight that he can break just that
[46:03] Word of Life to encourage us to get into
[46:06] action amen so let's sing Amazing Grace
[46:09] how sweet the sound as our brother comes
[46:13] the next thing is the action of the
[46:16] church that's all of you the Holy Spirit
[46:20] in human flesh
[46:22] doing the same signs and wonders amen
[46:26] that's a glorious Grace and hope in it

[50:34] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[50:38] the Lord bless you and thank you for
[50:40] praying for our brother
[50:42] uh we are going to take the gospel um
[50:47] Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ The
[50:50] Gospel of Matthew
[50:52] Brown Matthew is behind me somewhere
[50:55] a gospel of Matthew
[50:58] and
[51:01] chapter 13 in Matthew 13 the Lord Jesus
[51:05] Christ
[51:06] gave seven Parables that we're taking
[51:09] the very first one
[51:11] and
[51:14] I came over again because a young lady
[51:18] Susie my daughter's friend was 34 years
[51:22] and she had had four cesarean sections
[51:25] and the last one after the delivery of
[51:30] the baby
[51:31] um she had
[51:35] she had a situation where she had to be
[51:38] on life support for 21 days and
[51:42] unfortunately she passed
[51:45] and she had been with us lived with us
[51:48] for most of it life and so
[51:51] I had to come back to Virginia for a
[51:55] funeral
[51:56] so sad
[51:58] she left for little kids the last one is
[52:01] just three months old so remember
[52:04] um
[52:05] Solace family parents are really really
[52:10] devastated and the husband as well
[52:14] if in this world only we had hope in
[52:17] Christ indeed we have all men most
[52:20] miserable
[52:22] but we thank God that we have hope
[52:24] because Christ rose from the dead
[52:29] amen
[52:31] so keep praying for that family
[52:33] and I often remember
[52:36] widows and widowers and these days a lot
[52:41] of God's servants have lost their
[52:43] Partners it's so strange you know so
[52:46] many people in my countries about I can
[52:48] count on about seven ministers
[52:51] that have lost their wives I don't know
[52:54] why this is going on
[52:56] but God has
[52:58] I don't know
[52:59] but why
[53:01] tonight I want to be sharing with you a
[53:05] thought that struck me
[53:08] I've been wondering why will people come
[53:10] so far
[53:12] and leave the message
[53:14] and turn around and be fighting it
[53:18] why would they do that
[53:21] and as I meditated on that this
[53:24] scripture
[53:26] that we're going to be sharing tonight
[53:28] this series of scriptures brought my
[53:32] mind to what the cause could be
[53:37] so Matthew 13
[53:39] I read from verse 1.
[53:45] the same day when Jesus out of the house
[53:49] and sat
[53:51] by the seaside
[53:58] a reading from verse 1.
[54:01] and great multitudes were gathered
[54:04] together unto him
[54:07] so that he went into a shape and sat and
[54:10] the whole multitude stood on the shore
[54:15] and he spoke many things unto them in
[54:18] Parable saying
[54:20] behold the sower went forth to sow
[54:37] and when he saw some seeds fell by the
[54:40] wayside and the fowls came and devoured
[54:43] them up
[54:46] files came and devoured them up
[54:51] some fell upon Stony places where they
[54:54] had not much much Earth
[54:56] and forthwith they sprang up because
[54:59] they had no deepness of Earth
[55:03] when the sun was up they were scorched
[55:06] and because they had no roots they
[55:08] withered away
[55:10] no root
[55:12] they waited away
[55:14] and some fail among thongs and the
[55:16] Thorns sprung up and choked them
[55:21] but
[55:22] other fell into good ground and brought
[55:25] forth fruit some 100 full some 64 Psalm
[55:30] 34. if you read the gospel of Mark the
[55:33] power out scriptures to what we are
[55:35] reading
[55:37] you found that where Matthew started
[55:40] with the highest the lowest
[55:42] Mark starts with the lowest to the
[55:44] highest is the same thing
[55:47] it's no contradiction amen
[55:50] but other fell into good ground
[55:54] and brought forth fruit Psalm 100 4
[55:57] Psalm 64 psalm 34.
[56:01] but
[56:04] who have ears here let him hear and the
[56:08] disciples came and said unto him white
[56:11] speakers thou unto them in parables
[56:16] he answered and said unto them because
[56:18] it is given unto you to know
[56:21] the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven
[56:25] but to them it's not given
[56:29] Amen to some is giving to know the
[56:33] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[56:36] to Psalm is not given
[56:40] Hallelujah
[56:41] does that save the Lord the word of God
[56:45] is thou saved the Lord
[56:47] there's no way they can catch the
[56:49] mysteries of the Kingdom if it is not
[56:52] given to them
[56:54] that's where God's love is
[56:58] he tells you
[57:01] because he loved you
[57:05] whosoever have to him shall be given and
[57:09] he shall have more abundance but
[57:12] whosoever have not from him shall be
[57:14] taken away even that he have
[57:17] and that's going on
[57:19] therefore speak out to them in Parables
[57:22] because they see see not
[57:26] herein they hear not neither do they
[57:29] understand now underline the word
[57:31] understand
[57:33] I'm going to be exhorting on the spirit
[57:35] of understanding
[57:39] so underline the word understand
[57:43] because they see in sinat and hearing
[57:46] they hear not neither do they understand
[57:49] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[57:52] isaiahs which Saved By Hearing Isha here
[57:57] and shall not understand second time
[58:00] and seeing you shall see and shall not
[58:03] perceive for this people's heart is wax
[58:05] grows their ears are dull of hearing
[58:09] their eyes they have closed lest at any
[58:12] time they should see with their eyes
[58:15] and here with their ears and shoot again
[58:18] understand third time with their heart
[58:21] and should be converted and I shall heal
[58:25] them
[58:26] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[58:28] and your ears for the year for very I
[58:32] say unto you that many prophets and
[58:35] righteous men have desired to see those
[58:38] things which you see and have not seen
[58:41] them and to hear those things which year
[58:43] and have not had them
[58:46] here he therefore the parable of the
[58:48] sower
[58:49] when anyone Hearth the word of the
[58:52] Kingdom
[58:54] and
[58:56] shall we all read the rest
[59:00] so if anybody here at the message of the
[59:03] Kingdom
[59:04] and that's not what
[59:07] understand
[59:10] then cometh the wicked one
[59:14] and catches a way that which was sown in
[59:17] his heart this is he which receives seed
[59:20] by the wayside
[59:22] they do not understand
[59:26] Spirit that's why the prophet of God
[59:28] preached God being misunderstood
[59:35] yet
[59:37] verse 20 but he that received the seed
[59:41] into Stony places the same you see that
[59:44] here are the word and anong with joy
[59:47] receiveth it
[59:49] yet have he not rooting himself but
[59:52] endurance for a while for when
[59:56] tribulation or persecution arises
[59:58] because of the word by and by his
[1:00:01] offended
[1:00:03] he also that receives seed among the
[1:00:06] Thorns you see the hearer of the word
[1:00:08] the message of our day and the care of
[1:00:11] this world and the deceitfulness of
[1:00:14] riches choke the word and he becameth
[1:00:18] I'm fruitful
[1:00:20] but he that receiveth seed
[1:00:23] into the good ground you see the hear of
[1:00:26] the word and what
[1:00:28] I understand that thing
[1:00:30] which also better fruit and bringeth
[1:00:33] forth some and hundredfolds some 60s
[1:00:37] some 30. the Lord bless his word as you
[1:00:41] take your seat
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:45] so one of the biggest problems we are
[1:00:48] finding in the end time message and the
[1:00:51] reason why people will come so far and
[1:00:54] fall off
[1:00:55] according to our savior is because of
[1:00:59] the lack of understanding
[1:01:03] lack of Revelation
[1:01:07] amen so we can go back to the Old
[1:01:10] Testament and look at so many scriptures
[1:01:13] but because of time we might not be able
[1:01:15] to go through it all but I'll give you
[1:01:17] those scriptures if I know we have had
[1:01:19] enough and then you can go home and
[1:01:22] continue to study the subject
[1:01:25] Spirit of
[1:01:27] understanding in first case
[1:01:30] back into the Old Testament first case
[1:01:33] chapter 3 is a very familiar scripture
[1:01:37] which we know how many enjoy reading the
[1:01:40] Bible
[1:01:43] the reason I know William Branham is
[1:01:46] God's true Prophet is because he was the
[1:01:48] most scriptural person that I ever had
[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:55] every word of God mattered to the
[1:01:58] prophet
[1:01:59] some people will pick and choose what
[1:02:01] they want but the prophet of God stayed
[1:02:03] with every word
[1:02:05] Hallelujah
[1:02:07] so in First Kings chapter 3 we find a
[1:02:10] story of King Solomon
[1:02:13] he had built a tabernacle
[1:02:16] or a
[1:02:17] temple for Jehovah God
[1:02:20] and this is how First Kings chapter 3
[1:02:23] begins
[1:02:24] and Solomon made Affinity with Pharaoh
[1:02:28] king of Egypt and two Pharaoh's daughter
[1:02:30] and brought her into the city of David
[1:02:33] until he had made an end of building his
[1:02:36] own house and the house of the Lord and
[1:02:39] the war of Jerusalem
[1:02:40] and uh on the wall of Jerusalem
[1:02:44] roundabout
[1:02:48] and only Solomon only the people
[1:02:51] sacrificed in high places because there
[1:02:54] was no house built onto the name of the
[1:02:57] Lord until those days
[1:03:00] God's house is in construction
[1:03:04] and David
[1:03:06] has made the materials ready and Solomon
[1:03:10] loved the Lord amen hallelujah walking
[1:03:13] in the statues of David his father only
[1:03:16] he sacrificed and burned incense in high
[1:03:19] places and the King went to gibien to
[1:03:23] sacrifice there for that was the gray
[1:03:26] eye place a thousand burnt offerings the
[1:03:29] Solomon offer upon that altar
[1:03:34] in gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon
[1:03:37] in a Dream by night and God said ask
[1:03:40] what I shall give thee my what a
[1:03:44] privilege Jehovah asking you what will
[1:03:46] you that I gave you
[1:03:49] you remember brother Mark's sister hit
[1:03:51] you right
[1:03:53] what do you ask whatever you want and
[1:03:55] the Lord shall give it to you Solomon
[1:03:58] said thou has showed unto thy servant
[1:04:01] David my father great Mercy according as
[1:04:05] he walked before the in truth and in
[1:04:07] righteousness and in uprightness of
[1:04:10] heart with thee that was kept for him
[1:04:13] this great kindness that has given him a
[1:04:17] son to sit on his throne as it is this
[1:04:20] day
[1:04:21] think of the mercy of God
[1:04:24] Solomon was the son of Bathsheba
[1:04:32] the son of an adulterous relationship
[1:04:37] Solomon had a David had wives that were
[1:04:42] not in that kind of category but why
[1:04:46] would Jehovah bypass them and choose the
[1:04:48] son of an adulterous relationship to
[1:04:52] build a temple for him
[1:04:54] talk about God reaching Mercy
[1:04:57] he has so forgiving David so his Mercy
[1:05:01] extended to Solomon and now oh Lord my
[1:05:04] God
[1:05:05] that's made that servant King instead of
[1:05:08] David my father and now I'm about a
[1:05:11] little child I know not how to go out or
[1:05:14] coming and that servant is in the midst
[1:05:17] of that people which thou has chosen a
[1:05:20] great people that cannot be numbered nor
[1:05:23] counted for multitude give therefore thy
[1:05:27] servant what
[1:05:28] and understanding heart to judge thy
[1:05:32] people that I may discern between good
[1:05:36] and bad for who is able to Jack these
[1:05:39] are so greater people give me an
[1:05:41] understanding of and they speak please
[1:05:43] the Lord that Solomon had asked this
[1:05:46] thing God said unto him because that has
[1:05:50] asked this thing and has not asked for
[1:05:52] thyself long life neither as us riches
[1:05:56] for thyself nor has asked the life of
[1:05:58] thy enemies
[1:06:00] Beth has asked for thyself understanding
[1:06:03] to discern judgment
[1:06:06] behold I have done according to thy
[1:06:09] words Lord I have given thee a wise arm
[1:06:14] and an understanding heart so that there
[1:06:19] was none like thee before thee neither
[1:06:21] after thee shall any arise like unto
[1:06:24] thee
[1:06:25] amen and I've also given thee that which
[1:06:28] thou has not asked both riches and honor
[1:06:32] so that there shall not be any among the
[1:06:35] Kings like unto thee all thy days
[1:06:39] if thou walk in my ways
[1:06:42] to keep my statues and my Commandments
[1:06:45] as thy father David did work then I will
[1:06:49] lengthen thy days
[1:06:50] and Solomon awoke and behold it was a
[1:06:53] dream he came to Jerusalem and stood
[1:06:56] before the Ark of the Covenant of the
[1:06:57] Lord and no federal bent our friends and
[1:07:00] offered peace offerings and made a feast
[1:07:02] to all his servants
[1:07:05] Solomon had asked for an understanding
[1:07:08] heart
[1:07:10] now let's turn to Proverbs chapter 2.
[1:07:13] and see
[1:07:15] how he valued this Spirit of
[1:07:18] understanding
[1:07:20] Proverbs go back in your Bible
[1:07:23] Proverbs chapter 2.
[1:07:31] my son if thou will receive my words and
[1:07:35] hide my Commandments with thee so that
[1:07:38] thou incline thy ear unto wisdom
[1:07:41] and apply thy heart to understanding
[1:07:45] yeah if thou Christ after knowledge and
[1:07:49] lifted up thy voice for understanding
[1:07:53] if that's sick of her are silver and
[1:07:56] searches for her as for Hidden Treasures
[1:08:00] they shall not understand the fear of
[1:08:03] the Lord and find the knowledge of God
[1:08:06] for the lord giveth wisdom out of his
[1:08:10] mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
[1:08:14] he left up some wisdom for the righteous
[1:08:17] the Lord he is a bachelor to them that
[1:08:20] walk uprightly he keepeth the powers of
[1:08:24] of judgment and preserve the way of his
[1:08:27] sins then Shada understand righteousness
[1:08:31] and judgment and Equity yay every good
[1:08:36] path
[1:08:36] when wisdom entireth into thy heart and
[1:08:40] knowledge is person
[1:08:42] unto thy Soul this crashing shall
[1:08:46] preserve Thee the understanding shall
[1:08:50] keep thee to deliver thee from the way
[1:08:52] of the evil man from the man that
[1:08:55] speaker forward things
[1:08:58] and I looked at the word forward and it
[1:09:01] says
[1:09:02] person that is uncontrollable
[1:09:06] person that is
[1:09:09] uncontrollable
[1:09:13] who leave the house of uprightness
[1:09:17] to walk in the ways of Darkness if you
[1:09:20] leave light
[1:09:21] you have no alternative but walk in
[1:09:24] darkness
[1:09:25] people are living evening lights
[1:09:28] they're walking in darkness
[1:09:31] who Rejoice to do evil and Delight in
[1:09:34] the forwardness of the wicked whose ways
[1:09:38] are crooked and if and they forward in
[1:09:42] their paths to lead to deliver them from
[1:09:45] the strange woman
[1:09:46] even from the stranger which flattereth
[1:09:49] with their words which forsake of the
[1:09:52] guide of a youth and forget the Covenant
[1:09:55] of a God for a house in cleneth unto
[1:09:59] death and they pass unto the Dead
[1:10:02] none that go unto her return again
[1:10:05] neither take the hold of the powers of
[1:10:09] life the thou mayest walk in the way of
[1:10:11] good men and keep the powers of
[1:10:13] righteous for the upright shall dwell in
[1:10:16] the land and the prophet shall remain in
[1:10:19] it but the wicked shall be cut off from
[1:10:22] the earth and the transgressors shall be
[1:10:26] rooted out of it
[1:10:28] amen Solomon giving great wisdom
[1:10:34] underlined the importance of the spirit
[1:10:38] of understanding
[1:10:40] that's why in Jeremiah 3 and verse 15 we
[1:10:45] find Jehovah God
[1:10:48] knowing the needs of his children has
[1:10:51] said this Jeremiah 3 and verse 15
[1:10:55] save the Lord
[1:10:57] listen closely I will give you pastors
[1:11:02] according to my heart we shall feed you
[1:11:06] with knowledge
[1:11:08] and understanding
[1:11:12] I Jehovah God will give you pastors
[1:11:16] according to my heart we shall feed you
[1:11:20] with knowledge and understanding you
[1:11:23] find a five-fold Ministry
[1:11:26] working together
[1:11:30] the strong arm of the Lord submit
[1:11:33] yourselves unto the hand
[1:11:36] of the Lord and he shall live there
[1:11:40] so Jehovah gave in his children
[1:11:44] pastors according to my heart they will
[1:11:48] feed you with knowledge and
[1:11:50] understanding praise the Lord
[1:11:54] all right so
[1:11:56] that's the promise of Jehovah to give
[1:12:00] unto his children
[1:12:02] pastors that will feed them with
[1:12:04] knowledge and understanding blessed be
[1:12:08] the name of the Lord I will find Jehovah
[1:12:11] doing this
[1:12:12] in efficiency for
[1:12:15] of course verses 11 all the way Apostles
[1:12:20] prophets pastors teachers evangelists
[1:12:23] five-fold Ministry that will
[1:12:26] bring the Church of the Living God
[1:12:29] they will feed on the message of their
[1:12:32] day and these people are ordained by
[1:12:35] Jehovah God to simplify the message of
[1:12:39] the hour break it down in a way that the
[1:12:42] children of God will get understanding
[1:12:44] and knowledge a typical casing is in
[1:12:48] Nehemiah chapter eight let's go back
[1:12:51] again to the Old Testament
[1:12:53] and the book of Nehemiah chapter 8
[1:12:57] are we going to see an example of how
[1:13:01] fivefold Ministry o priests
[1:13:05] to help God's children this was during
[1:13:09] the Reconstruction of the Broken Walls
[1:13:12] of Jerusalem nehema Ezra and many others
[1:13:16] were engaged in that business
[1:13:18] and all the people guided themselves
[1:13:20] together as one man into the street that
[1:13:23] was before the Watergate they spoke unto
[1:13:26] Ezra The Scribe to bring the book of the
[1:13:29] law of Moses which the Lord had
[1:13:32] commanded to Israel
[1:13:34] and Ezra the priest brought the law
[1:13:37] before the congregation both of men are
[1:13:39] women and all that could hear with
[1:13:42] understanding
[1:13:44] upon the first day of the seventh month
[1:13:47] he read them he and he read the ring
[1:13:50] before the street that was before the
[1:13:52] water gate from the morning until midday
[1:13:55] before the men and the women and those
[1:13:58] that could understand
[1:14:00] and the ears of all the people attentive
[1:14:03] unto the book of the law and Ezra
[1:14:07] described stood upon the pulpit of wood
[1:14:09] which they had made for their purpose
[1:14:11] and beside him stood
[1:14:19] on his right hand and on his left hand
[1:14:23] pediah and Marshall and milk
[1:14:27] ya and his home and hash badana
[1:14:31] Zechariah ameshulam
[1:14:34] Sam all right some on the left and Ezra
[1:14:36] opened the book in the side of all the
[1:14:39] people
[1:14:40] when brother pranam says when we read in
[1:14:43] the Bible to stand up people think that
[1:14:45] it's unscriptural now let's look at it
[1:14:47] right here
[1:14:49] Ezra opened a book in the sight of all
[1:14:52] the people for he was above all the
[1:14:55] people like I'm above you all
[1:14:58] and when he opened it all the people
[1:15:01] stood up Hallelujah so you see that our
[1:15:05] Prophet was scripture brother Branham to
[1:15:08] me was a very scriptural Prophet let the
[1:15:12] world say what they want
[1:15:15] and Ezra blessed the Lord the great God
[1:15:19] and all the people and said
[1:15:23] how did they answer
[1:15:25] they were not sitting down quietly
[1:15:30] they were responding to the word that
[1:15:33] was coming to them and the people said
[1:15:37] and
[1:15:39] that's right so that's why you should be
[1:15:41] doing
[1:15:43] so they were saying amen and amen with
[1:15:46] what lifting up their hands hallelujah
[1:15:49] amen and they bought their hairs and
[1:15:52] Worship the Lord with their faces to the
[1:15:55] ground
[1:15:55] that's why they're Muslims they say see
[1:15:58] the Old Testament Believers were Muslims
[1:16:00] look at them also Joshua Ben and I and
[1:16:05] shared by a German
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:15] deliveries listen here
[1:16:18] deliveries cause the people
[1:16:21] to understand the law
[1:16:24] and the people stood in their place so
[1:16:27] you see the duty of the ministry past us
[1:16:31] after my own heart who feed you with
[1:16:34] what knowledge and understanding amen so
[1:16:40] they'll cause them to understand the
[1:16:42] reading God has sent a message such a
[1:16:46] precious message but the problem is
[1:16:49] people do not understand we can press
[1:16:53] play all we want to and we should
[1:16:57] but that doesn't necessarily guarantee
[1:17:00] that people are going to understand
[1:17:02] that's where the faithful Ministry comes
[1:17:05] in they catch the thoughts that God is
[1:17:08] presenting through his prophet and they
[1:17:10] present it to God's children
[1:17:14] the freedom with what knowledge and
[1:17:18] understanding otherwise watch the use of
[1:17:22] having ministers
[1:17:23] Eva
[1:17:26] there's a balance
[1:17:28] we Press Play I press play all my life
[1:17:31] I've been pressing play
[1:17:35] but you know what if I press play my
[1:17:37] church
[1:17:38] 99 of the people who sleep
[1:17:42] you know why they can't understand one
[1:17:45] word in in the in English
[1:17:48] very few
[1:17:50] so you see
[1:17:52] there must be a balance everybody is not
[1:17:55] an American
[1:18:02] and Ezra the priest the Scribe and the
[1:18:05] Levites that taught the people said unto
[1:18:08] all the people this is the holy this day
[1:18:11] is Holy unto the Lord your God more not
[1:18:14] nor weep for all the people wept when
[1:18:17] they had the words of the Lord then he
[1:18:19] said unto them go your way eat the fat
[1:18:21] drink the sweet send portions unto them
[1:18:24] for whom nothing is prepared for this
[1:18:27] day is Holy unto the Lord neither be you
[1:18:30] sorry for the joy of the Lord is your
[1:18:33] strength
[1:18:35] so the lever is still all the people say
[1:18:38] hold your peace for the days holy
[1:18:41] neither be ye grieved and all the people
[1:18:43] went their way to eat drink and to drink
[1:18:46] and to some push and to make great meth
[1:18:49] because they had what
[1:18:51] understood the West
[1:18:54] that were declared unto them and on the
[1:18:57] second day they gathered together the
[1:18:59] chief of the fathers of all the people
[1:19:01] the priests that Levites unto the unto
[1:19:04] Israel they prescribed even to
[1:19:06] understand the words of the law and they
[1:19:09] found written in the law which the law
[1:19:11] had commanded by Moses
[1:19:13] that the children of Israel should dwell
[1:19:16] in Bulls in the Feast of the seventh
[1:19:19] month
[1:19:21] of the sermon they should publish and
[1:19:23] Proclaim in all their cities and in
[1:19:25] Jerusalem saying go forth unto the man
[1:19:27] fetch only branches Pine branches metal
[1:19:31] branches palm branches and branches of
[1:19:34] fig trees to Maples as is written the
[1:19:37] people are to understand before they
[1:19:41] acted
[1:19:42] the court was saying the church is now
[1:19:45] to act
[1:19:47] but we've got to act with understanding
[1:19:50] how do you go into action if you did not
[1:19:53] understand the command
[1:19:56] or I'm going to give you a command sorry
[1:19:59] Dylan
[1:20:02] sorry
[1:20:07] he didn't understand so how would he go
[1:20:10] into action
[1:20:12] see how valuable it is that by God's
[1:20:15] grace we should have an understanding
[1:20:17] and revelation of the word that we are
[1:20:20] hearing
[1:20:22] do you understand Jesus will turn around
[1:20:25] I remember that Billy Paul was giving a
[1:20:28] testimony Ibraham at pre-future home and
[1:20:31] said Billy did you understand
[1:20:33] he looked at he said yes Dad he said did
[1:20:37] you understand
[1:20:38] then he shook his hands and no no
[1:20:42] without Revelation you cannot go into
[1:20:45] action
[1:20:47] you see the Lord Jesus after the
[1:20:50] resurrection in in Luke Chapter 24.
[1:20:52] let's turn to it in the New Testament
[1:20:55] and watch this very interesting thing he
[1:20:59] had spoken to cleopas me that's why I
[1:21:02] got my middle name from
[1:21:05] cleopas means the full Glory
[1:21:09] I want a serving course meal I don't
[1:21:11] want any part parts I want the full
[1:21:15] course meal
[1:21:17] yes sir so in Luke chapter 24 this is
[1:21:22] talking about the resurrection of the
[1:21:24] Lord Jesus Christ and he has spent the
[1:21:28] whole day
[1:21:30] preaching the gospel to these guys
[1:21:33] they were so confused about the message
[1:21:36] they were confused by the death of the
[1:21:39] Lord Jesus they never thought you could
[1:21:42] die
[1:21:43] they were so confused they were not even
[1:21:45] listening to why he had been telling
[1:21:47] them about him going to die and so on
[1:21:49] and so
[1:21:52] they got up there and they they walking
[1:21:57] in the street going back to where they
[1:22:00] used to be going back to their old jobs
[1:22:04] one Jesus the the let me read it over
[1:22:10] here I'm trying to jump quickly but let
[1:22:13] me slow down a little bit
[1:22:15] so two of them verse 14 they talk
[1:22:18] together of all these things which had
[1:22:20] happened and he came to pass that while
[1:22:22] they commune together a reason Jesus
[1:22:25] himself Drew now and went with them but
[1:22:28] their eyes were holding that they should
[1:22:32] not know him
[1:22:33] he said unto them what man of
[1:22:36] communications are this that you have
[1:22:38] one to another as you walk and I said
[1:22:41] one of them whose name was cleopas and
[1:22:45] she said on team are the only a stranger
[1:22:47] in Jerusalem and has not known the
[1:22:50] things which have come to pass there in
[1:22:53] these days
[1:22:54] he said unto them what is
[1:22:57] they served him concerning Jesus they
[1:23:00] were talking to the man and they didn't
[1:23:01] even know who he was their eyes were
[1:23:04] holding
[1:23:05] their eyes of understanding were closed
[1:23:09] the God of this evil age can close the
[1:23:12] eyes of people till they come and see
[1:23:14] truth
[1:23:17] their eyes of understanding must get
[1:23:20] open or you talk all day all night and
[1:23:24] throughout your life and you'll be
[1:23:26] wasting your breath
[1:23:27] he said unto them what things and they
[1:23:30] said unto him concerning Jesus of
[1:23:32] Nazareth which was a prophet they were
[1:23:35] preaching back to Jesus you know which
[1:23:37] was a prophet
[1:23:39] Mighty indeed and word before God and
[1:23:42] all the people and he said oh
[1:23:45] that's how they saw me
[1:23:46] and how the chief priests and our rulers
[1:23:49] delivered him to be condemned to death
[1:23:51] and have crucified him
[1:23:54] we trusted that it had been he we should
[1:23:57] have redeemed Israel and beside all
[1:23:59] these two days the third day since these
[1:24:02] things were done
[1:24:03] yeah and certainly women also of our
[1:24:06] company made us astonished which were
[1:24:09] earlier the Sepulcher when they found
[1:24:11] out his body they came saying that they
[1:24:15] had also seen a vision of angels which
[1:24:17] said that he was alive
[1:24:19] certain of them which were with us went
[1:24:22] to the circle can find it even so as the
[1:24:25] women have said by him they saw not
[1:24:28] then he said unto them oh fools
[1:24:32] fools who is a fool
[1:24:34] Wahoo doesn't understand things it's a
[1:24:37] fool you fools
[1:24:40] slow of heart to believe all that the
[1:24:43] prophets have spoken people today are
[1:24:46] slow of heart to understand Bible
[1:24:49] prophecies
[1:24:52] ought not Christ who has suffered these
[1:24:54] things and to enter into his glory
[1:24:57] and beginning at Moses that's Genesis
[1:25:01] the Torah five books of the Bible and
[1:25:04] all the prophets the image Jesus is
[1:25:07] taking them through the Bible to
[1:25:09] identify himself by the scriptures all
[1:25:13] the way from Genesis to Malachi
[1:25:16] beginning of Moses and all the prophets
[1:25:20] he expanded unto them in all the
[1:25:23] scriptures the things concerning himself
[1:25:26] but did they catch the revelation
[1:25:29] they drew now onto the village without
[1:25:31] they went and he made us though he would
[1:25:34] have gone further but they constrained
[1:25:37] him saying abide with us he's toward the
[1:25:40] evening the day is fast pain he went
[1:25:42] into tarry with them he came to pass as
[1:25:46] he sat at meet with them he took bread
[1:25:48] blessed it broke it gave it to them and
[1:25:52] their eyes
[1:25:53] were opened and they knew him and he
[1:25:58] vanished out of their side and they said
[1:26:00] one to another they know that happened
[1:26:02] within us why he thought with us by the
[1:26:04] way and why open to us the scriptures
[1:26:07] they rose up the same hour returned to
[1:26:10] Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered
[1:26:12] together and them that were with them
[1:26:14] saying the Lord is risen indeed and have
[1:26:16] appeared to Simon they told what things
[1:26:19] were done in the way and how he was
[1:26:21] known of them in Breaking of bread and
[1:26:24] as they expect this Jesus himself stood
[1:26:26] in the midst of them and said unto them
[1:26:28] peace be unto you but they were
[1:26:31] terrified they're frightened and suppose
[1:26:33] that they have seen a spirit he said
[1:26:35] unto them why are you trouble and why do
[1:26:38] thoughts arise in your house behold my
[1:26:40] hands and my feet it is I myself handle
[1:26:43] me see for a spirit of no Flesh and
[1:26:46] Bones as you see me have when he had
[1:26:48] outspoken he showed them his hands and
[1:26:50] his feet and while they were here
[1:26:52] believe not for joy
[1:26:55] what they yet believe not for joy and
[1:26:58] one day he said unto them have he here
[1:27:00] and you meet any food they gave him a
[1:27:04] piece of broiled fish how many enjoy
[1:27:06] broiled fish and of her honeycomb
[1:27:10] they say you shouldn't eaten if you have
[1:27:12] diabetes
[1:27:13] the Bible says eat honey
[1:27:16] so I think I will I obey the Bible but
[1:27:19] he says eat it moderately
[1:27:22] so he took it and he did it before the
[1:27:25] man he said unto them these are the
[1:27:27] words which I speak unto you while I was
[1:27:29] yet with you that all things must be
[1:27:32] fulfilled which were written in the law
[1:27:34] Moses in the prophets and in the Psalms
[1:27:37] concerning me so the whole Bible was
[1:27:40] concerning him
[1:27:41] then look at this then
[1:27:45] oh Behavior
[1:27:47] understanding
[1:27:50] that they might understand the
[1:27:53] scriptures
[1:27:54] unto Jesus does the same operation on
[1:27:58] you
[1:27:59] you can hear the prophet all the days of
[1:28:02] your life
[1:28:05] if he does not open your eyes
[1:28:08] and of understanding
[1:28:12] you you will not be able to go into
[1:28:15] action
[1:28:17] so open day
[1:28:21] then open heal their understanding that
[1:28:25] they might understand their scriptures
[1:28:28] and he said unto them thus it is written
[1:28:31] and thus it behoove Christ to suffer and
[1:28:34] to rise from the dead the third day and
[1:28:37] that repentance and remission of sin
[1:28:40] should be preached in his name among all
[1:28:43] nations beginning at Jerusalem ye are
[1:28:46] witnesses
[1:28:48] of these things and behold I send a
[1:28:51] promise of my father upon you carrying
[1:28:54] the city of Jerusalem montevian to
[1:28:57] repower from on high he read about as
[1:29:00] far as to Bethany I lifted up his hands
[1:29:03] bless them and he came to pass while he
[1:29:05] blessed them he was spotted from them
[1:29:07] carried up into heaven they worshiped
[1:29:10] him and return to Jerusalem with great
[1:29:12] joy and where continually in the temple
[1:29:14] praising and blessing God but he
[1:29:20] he opened their eyes of understanding
[1:29:24] you will now see why Paul when he wrote
[1:29:29] to the Ephesian believers
[1:29:31] turn with me to Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:29:36] Paul had said so many things about how
[1:29:40] God has blessed her with all the
[1:29:42] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:29:44] read adoption and blah blah I'm gives a
[1:29:47] list of the blessings that God has
[1:29:50] spought upon his bride blessed be the
[1:29:53] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:55] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:29:57] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:30:00] according us he has chosen Us in him
[1:30:03] before the foundation of the world that
[1:30:06] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:30:08] before him in love having predestinated
[1:30:11] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:30:15] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:30:18] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[1:30:21] of the glory of his grace wherein he has
[1:30:24] made us accepted in their beloved in
[1:30:27] whom we have Redemption through his
[1:30:29] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:30:32] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[1:30:35] hath abandoned towards her I said no
[1:30:37] wisdom and Prudence having made known
[1:30:40] unto us the mystery of Israel God's will
[1:30:43] for your life is a mystery and you must
[1:30:46] seek his ways for the unfolding of that
[1:30:49] will
[1:30:50] seek his face excuse me you we must seek
[1:30:55] his face
[1:30:57] for him to unfold the mystery of his
[1:31:00] will concerning our lives for he says
[1:31:03] the mystery of his will his will about
[1:31:07] you for you is a mystery and seek his
[1:31:12] face for the unfolding of that mystery
[1:31:15] to you personally
[1:31:16] okay then jump over to verse 15 because
[1:31:20] of time
[1:31:22] wherefore I also that's Paul
[1:31:26] after I heard of your faith in the Lord
[1:31:29] Jesus and love unto all the saints cease
[1:31:34] not to give thanks for you
[1:31:37] make a mention of you in my prayers
[1:31:40] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:44] the father of Glory may give unto you
[1:31:48] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[1:31:53] the knowledge of him
[1:31:55] I cease not to pray unto God to give
[1:31:59] unto you the spirit of wisdom what is
[1:32:02] wisdom
[1:32:03] wisdom is knowing how to apply knowledge
[1:32:07] amen you might be giving knowledge but
[1:32:10] if you do not know the right way to
[1:32:12] apply it to a fool
[1:32:15] it takes Divine wisdom to take the
[1:32:18] revealed word apply it
[1:32:21] the right way to know how to apply the
[1:32:25] work to meet your need amen that's
[1:32:28] wisdom so he Paul is praying for them
[1:32:32] that the Lord might give them the spirit
[1:32:34] of wisdom and Revelation in the
[1:32:38] knowledge of him the eyes of your word
[1:32:42] understanding being enlightened amen
[1:32:46] that you may know one what is the hope
[1:32:50] of his calling
[1:32:52] what is the hope of his calling
[1:32:55] what is God's hope of calling you to be
[1:32:59] his son or daughter
[1:33:02] that you must share the divine nature
[1:33:05] and have a body change and be raptured
[1:33:07] to be with him in glory that's why he
[1:33:10] said before us the promise of this
[1:33:13] change this church
[1:33:15] the promise of the end time bride is to
[1:33:19] share his throne
[1:33:21] is the rapture is a body change that so
[1:33:25] he says that I cease not to pray for you
[1:33:28] that your eyes of understanding will be
[1:33:31] enlightened so that you will know the
[1:33:34] hope of his calling if you miss the hope
[1:33:37] of his calling you are serving God in
[1:33:39] there
[1:33:40] you are just following daddy you are
[1:33:42] following mommy you are following a
[1:33:43] friend you are following somebody but
[1:33:45] you have no personal revelation of what
[1:33:49] you are following
[1:33:50] if you have a personal revelation of
[1:33:52] this message you will not toy with it
[1:33:55] you will not allow somebody to talk you
[1:33:58] out of it
[1:34:00] amen you have a real revelation of what
[1:34:02] this message means to you
[1:34:05] you don't you're not traded for nothing
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:11] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:34:14] enlightened that you may know what is
[1:34:17] the hope of his calling one what the
[1:34:19] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:34:22] in the sins
[1:34:25] God's children are rich in faith
[1:34:29] amen and and and then what is the
[1:34:34] exceeding greatness of his power to as
[1:34:37] what we believe
[1:34:40] he's prayed for them that their eyes of
[1:34:44] understanding will be opened one that
[1:34:48] they might know the hope of their
[1:34:50] calling and two that they might know the
[1:34:54] the riches
[1:34:56] of the glory of his inheritance among
[1:34:59] these things
[1:35:01] God has got spiritual riches for his
[1:35:04] sins but until our eyes of understanding
[1:35:07] are open to know them we will be walking
[1:35:11] uh like the Indian the brother brothers
[1:35:14] are like the the the old lady that
[1:35:18] brother Brown and speaks of whose son
[1:35:20] had gone to be in India and she was
[1:35:23] sending her checks upon checks every
[1:35:26] month
[1:35:27] with a big elephant on their checks so
[1:35:30] my son has been sending me these
[1:35:32] pictures from India and she hid them in
[1:35:35] her Bible
[1:35:36] a whole bunch of them I was living in
[1:35:40] poverty with so much stored up in a
[1:35:43] Bible but she did not know what they
[1:35:45] were
[1:35:46] till something happened I said
[1:35:49] did you say you have a son overseas a
[1:35:52] doctor I said yes I have a son hasn't he
[1:35:55] been sending you any help he said no
[1:35:57] always he's been sending me at this
[1:35:59] elephant pictures I packed them in my
[1:36:03] Bible
[1:36:04] the guy looked at them
[1:36:06] and there were Church there are millions
[1:36:10] of dollars but she had no understanding
[1:36:14] of what they were
[1:36:17] so is it that God's Bible is full of
[1:36:20] riches
[1:36:21] for his children
[1:36:23] Hallelujah but until your eyes have
[1:36:27] understanding are they are revealed to
[1:36:30] you by the Holy Ghost minister to your
[1:36:34] heart you remain in spiritual poverty
[1:36:38] sitting on Plenty like this woman
[1:36:43] amen so he prayed for them that their
[1:36:47] eyes of understanding will be opened
[1:36:51] that they will know the hope of his
[1:36:53] calling how many know the hope of his
[1:36:55] calling
[1:36:57] yes sir and that they will know the
[1:36:59] exceeding greatness of his riches in
[1:37:03] their sins and thirdly that they might
[1:37:06] also know the exceeding great power that
[1:37:11] Jehovah displayed when he raised Christ
[1:37:14] from the dead that the same power that
[1:37:17] raised the Lord Jesus from the dead dead
[1:37:20] and set him on this heavily Throne is
[1:37:23] the power that is working for the Saints
[1:37:27] oh Hallelujah
[1:37:29] the power that is working that is behind
[1:37:33] you the power of his resurrection that's
[1:37:37] why Paul said you know in Philippians
[1:37:41] chapter 3 he said I count all what I
[1:37:45] knew has done for the Excellency of the
[1:37:48] knowledge of Christ he says and I have a
[1:37:51] forgetting what lays behind I press
[1:37:54] towards the price of the mark of the
[1:37:57] High Calling of God that I may know him
[1:37:59] in the power of his resurrection and
[1:38:03] befriending him not having my own
[1:38:05] righteousness but the righteousness
[1:38:07] which is of Christ by faith
[1:38:11] oh Hallelujah and if Paul was not
[1:38:15] complacent at any time I was pressing
[1:38:18] for more of God how can we sit down
[1:38:21] there and allow this little decent
[1:38:23] anointing of
[1:38:25] need of nothing to come upon us
[1:38:29] there's so much more that God has stood
[1:38:32] up for his bride that we must press unto
[1:38:36] and and pray unto and reach forth until
[1:38:41] amen we should not be afraid to let go
[1:38:44] of our faith
[1:38:46] it may take a while but don't lose sight
[1:38:49] of the fact that the Lord is God and and
[1:38:53] that he does what he wants to do in his
[1:38:57] time
[1:38:58] and not in my time or your time but he
[1:39:02] is
[1:39:05] in his time
[1:39:09] he makes all things beautiful
[1:39:14] in his time amen
[1:39:18] he
[1:39:20] the power that he brought the mighty
[1:39:23] power which he wrought in Christ
[1:39:28] amen when he raised him from the dead
[1:39:32] and set him at his own right hand in
[1:39:35] Heavenly places far above all Hallelujah
[1:39:39] He Who Came From Above is above all
[1:39:43] above all our problems above Allah was
[1:39:47] difficult it's above all our confusion
[1:39:50] our God is a dissolver of doubts
[1:39:53] amen he raised him far above all
[1:39:57] principality and power and might and
[1:40:00] dominion and every name that is named
[1:40:03] not only in this world but also in that
[1:40:06] which is to come he has put all things
[1:40:09] under his feet
[1:40:11] and give it and gave him to be the head
[1:40:15] over all things to the church
[1:40:18] head over all things to the church which
[1:40:22] is his body
[1:40:23] the fullness of him that feeleth all in
[1:40:27] all bless that be the name of the Lord
[1:40:30] hallelujah God Opening Our Eyes of
[1:40:36] understanding then when we understand
[1:40:39] the message of our day
[1:40:42] we are not confused
[1:40:45] ways of doctrines that are blowing from
[1:40:49] east west north and south can never blow
[1:40:52] us off our feet
[1:40:54] now we established with the spirit of
[1:40:58] understanding you know one time Mary
[1:41:03] that had been betrothed to Joseph
[1:41:06] was found with a child
[1:41:09] and that was contrary to Jewish
[1:41:11] betrothal laws
[1:41:14] Jewish you can study that if you wish to
[1:41:17] Jewish be Truth House
[1:41:20] what you call engagement
[1:41:23] we're not some wishy-washy kneeling down
[1:41:27] somewhere and giving a rose flower will
[1:41:29] you marry me yes I will that was no it
[1:41:33] was a pre-arranged well-planned a rabbi
[1:41:37] was present and they are witnesses to
[1:41:40] that
[1:41:41] so to break that was the same as
[1:41:45] a divorce
[1:41:49] so Mary was found with a child
[1:41:55] and she told Joseph how it all happened
[1:41:59] said Joseph
[1:42:02] to Mary Mary
[1:42:05] you know what I've trusted you
[1:42:08] up till now
[1:42:10] you know I hate to betray you
[1:42:13] to be stoned to death you just tell me
[1:42:16] the truth
[1:42:18] and I'll be sure not to betray you
[1:42:21] Joseph what truth
[1:42:24] an angel Gabriel came to me and
[1:42:29] to me and said thou have found favor in
[1:42:33] the eyes of the Lord
[1:42:34] what other truth do you want besides
[1:42:37] this and that's all I know
[1:42:40] how could Mary what kind of
[1:42:44] how could Mary convince Joseph
[1:42:48] that she was telling the truth
[1:42:51] [Music]
[1:42:54] that's your thing
[1:42:57] why
[1:42:59] do don't talk with my life you know you
[1:43:03] are breaking my heart
[1:43:05] okay this is what I plan to do I will
[1:43:09] leave you
[1:43:10] privately
[1:43:12] I will not let you restore but you tell
[1:43:14] me the truth what's the name of the man
[1:43:20] Mary said the Holy Ghost
[1:43:24] say look Mary
[1:43:26] you can't pull the wool over my eyes
[1:43:30] have you ever heard anybody impregnated
[1:43:32] by a spirit
[1:43:37] well there was no way Mary could
[1:43:39] convince Joseph that she was telling the
[1:43:42] truth so
[1:43:47] but Joseph was very sincere
[1:43:50] he went before the Lord said Lord I'm
[1:43:52] confused I don't know what to do
[1:43:56] my my beloved fiancee has betrayed me
[1:44:00] made mockery of me and people be
[1:44:03] laughing at me
[1:44:04] Lord please won't you do something to
[1:44:08] help me
[1:44:09] give you an understanding of the
[1:44:11] situation
[1:44:13] she prayed and what did Jehovah do the
[1:44:16] Lord sent an angel to Joseph
[1:44:19] and in the night take unto thee marry
[1:44:23] their wife for that which is conceived
[1:44:26] in her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:29] and if you want to know 10 to Isaiah 7
[1:44:32] and verse 14 haven't I said in my word a
[1:44:36] virgin shall conceive and give birth to
[1:44:38] a son and thou shall call his name
[1:44:40] Emmanuel
[1:44:42] didn't Moses say that the seed of the
[1:44:44] woman who breathes the head of the
[1:44:46] serpent has a woman got a seed this is
[1:44:50] the super seed
[1:44:52] Hallelujah is talking about the Virgin
[1:44:54] conception maybe maybe Isaiah was
[1:44:58] plagiarizing
[1:45:02] Isaiah said a virgin will concede and it
[1:45:06] was based on Genesis
[1:45:08] 3 15.
[1:45:11] so Isaiah was plagiarized
[1:45:17] nobody has Monopoly on the Holy Ghost
[1:45:20] right brother Branham said God sent him
[1:45:23] to tighten up the Loose Ends so he's
[1:45:26] admitting that there have been
[1:45:28] Revelations down the road but they've
[1:45:30] got loose eyes so he brings them
[1:45:33] together and tightens them up by the
[1:45:36] word of God and presents it to the blood
[1:45:38] of Jesus Christ
[1:45:40] oh that's no plagiarizing
[1:45:44] that Moses was everybody was
[1:45:46] plagiarizing when they started quoting
[1:45:48] Old Testament
[1:45:49] amen Jesus
[1:45:53] in Matthew 4 4
[1:45:55] he quoted Deuteronomy 8 3 he was
[1:45:58] plagiarizing
[1:46:00] men shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:46:03] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:46:05] mouth of God
[1:46:07] he said is it not written in the it is
[1:46:10] written in the word he did not even
[1:46:12] mention Moses's name
[1:46:14] plagiarism is when you use somebody's
[1:46:18] material without reference to the person
[1:46:23] Jesus said
[1:46:25] it is written man shall not live by
[1:46:28] bread alone he did not say Moses said it
[1:46:30] so he did not make reference to the
[1:46:34] original author of that word through
[1:46:37] whom the Lord first said it amen so here
[1:46:41] we have come preference there are many
[1:46:43] things in this world by the way do you
[1:46:46] realize that brother pronounce Ministry
[1:46:48] was he says I preach what Paul preached
[1:46:52] and you know what Peter said about what
[1:46:54] Paul priest turned to second period
[1:46:57] chapter 3
[1:46:59] how many like reading the Bible
[1:47:01] listen everything this Prophet brought
[1:47:04] was here
[1:47:06] here
[1:47:07] we should begin to say the word of God
[1:47:10] says
[1:47:11] confirmed by God's Prophet this is the
[1:47:15] your soup this is the authority
[1:47:18] and the prophet of God
[1:47:21] through the light on the written word of
[1:47:25] the Living God revealing the Hidden
[1:47:27] Mysteries here to make this book live so
[1:47:31] that we the bride can act on it
[1:47:34] without fear
[1:47:36] right now we should not fear to apply
[1:47:39] the word why it's been proven
[1:47:43] proving his word it's been proven from
[1:47:45] Genesis to revelation we don't need to
[1:47:48] prove it again it's already been proven
[1:47:51] to be true and efficacious is powerful
[1:47:55] it will not fail so we should hold on to
[1:47:59] it dearly
[1:48:01] and stand by the authority of the word
[1:48:03] of the Living God and move on
[1:48:06] jealously
[1:48:07] you know why sometimes we are not able
[1:48:10] to exercise faith is pride
[1:48:13] what if I pray
[1:48:16] and it doesn't work
[1:48:19] then I will be put to shame so he said
[1:48:21] ego Factor
[1:48:24] brother Abraham said if I pray for 500
[1:48:26] and they all die I'll be praying for the
[1:48:28] next 500.
[1:48:30] he is not a Healer
[1:48:33] he is called to pray
[1:48:34] he's not a savior he's going to preach
[1:48:38] salvation but we have once healer and we
[1:48:42] have one savior who never fails
[1:48:46] amen
[1:48:47] praise be to God
[1:48:50] Hallelujah
[1:48:51] so
[1:48:53] in conclusion
[1:48:55] I see the reason why people are leaving
[1:48:58] this message when they don't even have a
[1:49:01] better substitute
[1:49:04] and they can have a better substitute
[1:49:08] they lack Revelation they lack
[1:49:11] understanding
[1:49:12] of what God has given to us
[1:49:16] and if you are in the same category
[1:49:19] you'll get to a point you throw it away
[1:49:23] so pray for revelation
[1:49:26] pray to understand
[1:49:28] God's purpose
[1:49:30] for sending us a prophet
[1:49:33] pray that Lord let me understand give me
[1:49:37] a personal conviction and revelation of
[1:49:40] this word of Truth and establish me in
[1:49:43] the present truth so that the ways of
[1:49:47] Doctrine blowing left right up and down
[1:49:50] will still be standing solid and fair
[1:49:54] that's why Jesus said in Luke chapter 6
[1:49:58] 46-49 a wise man who builds his house
[1:50:01] upon the rock
[1:50:04] the flowers will come
[1:50:06] turbulence will come tsunamis who come
[1:50:09] earthquakes who come but because it's
[1:50:12] founded on the rock rock of Revelation
[1:50:16] personal revelation of the word to your
[1:50:19] heart you still stand Fame blessed be
[1:50:23] the name of the Lord
[1:50:26] I would say God's Not Dead
[1:50:29] he's alive my God's Not Dead
[1:50:35] he is alive
[1:50:37] God's Not Dead
[1:50:40] it's alive
[1:50:45] feeling in my heart
[1:50:48] feeling in my feet
[1:50:51] feeling
[1:50:52] over me one more time God's not dead
[1:50:59] yes
[1:51:05] [Music]
[1:51:11] alive I feel him in my head I'm feeling
[1:51:16] in my feet I feel him in my heart I feel
[1:51:21] it all over me is that right with you
[1:51:25] tonight oh God
[1:51:29] his eyes
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:37] [Applause]
[1:51:46] [Music]
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:59] if God answered Solomon's Prayer
[1:52:03] to be endued with a spirit of
[1:52:07] understanding and the Lord not only
[1:52:10] answered that prayer
[1:52:12] I hear that is able to do exceeding
[1:52:16] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:52:20] think
[1:52:21] if he went beyond his request and even
[1:52:24] added more that he God knew he needed
[1:52:29] can't we also come before the unchanging
[1:52:32] God
[1:52:33] where you are stuck up and you have
[1:52:35] doubts and confusion in your mind
[1:52:38] concerning something the prophet said
[1:52:41] don't don't fight it
[1:52:45] bring it before the Lord said Lord
[1:52:47] please help my understanding
[1:52:50] that I might be able to take the right
[1:52:53] action
[1:52:55] that's what we ought to be doing
[1:52:57] don't fight it
[1:52:59] brother brother must not one given to
[1:53:03] Showmanship and vain Glory seeking no
[1:53:09] he said only what God ordained him to
[1:53:12] say Amen
[1:53:14] amen sometimes he may not even
[1:53:15] understand what he said by being a
[1:53:18] prophet he had to say it because he was
[1:53:21] cause mouthpiece
[1:53:23] now believing that the holy spirit will
[1:53:27] give to God's children
[1:53:30] Spirit of understanding then we go into
[1:53:34] action
[1:53:36] for the kingdom of God
[1:53:39] sorry about our heads
[1:53:44] open down my eyes oh Lord
[1:53:47] that I may behold one draws things out
[1:53:50] of thy law that's what David prayed
[1:53:53] won't you ask the lord lord Jesus
[1:53:57] may you anoint my eyes
[1:54:00] of understanding
[1:54:03] that I might understand the word that
[1:54:05] you have spoken to me in these last days
[1:54:08] Lord that I might not fight the Holy
[1:54:11] Ghost
[1:54:12] without my jewels to you that you might
[1:54:15] give me understanding
[1:54:18] Joseph prayed and you gave him
[1:54:21] understanding of the situation
[1:54:23] he took unto him Mary his wife
[1:54:27] I was willing to Bear reproach on
[1:54:30] account of your way because he
[1:54:32] understood it
[1:54:33] Lord I pray for your children those here
[1:54:37] and those who will be hearing this
[1:54:39] message anyway I pray that when they
[1:54:42] take these messages or they listen to
[1:54:45] the voice of God in these last days that
[1:54:49] you grant unto them Grace to understand
[1:54:52] the mysteries of the kingdom of God for
[1:54:56] you have said in your word that unto you
[1:54:58] it is given to understand the mysteries
[1:55:01] of the kingdom of God so may we stand on
[1:55:04] the authority of your word and claim the
[1:55:08] understanding then we can go into action
[1:55:11] believing that the Lord has given us
[1:55:15] Revelation even as Daniel Prayed to
[1:55:19] understand the time that he was living
[1:55:22] in and you sent Gabriel he had been
[1:55:25] fasting and praying and seeking your
[1:55:27] face and you sent April Gabriel you sent
[1:55:31] since the day you started seeking to
[1:55:34] understand
[1:55:35] I have sent my angel
[1:55:39] to bring you understanding of the times
[1:55:41] that you are living in
[1:55:43] all it is on our knees that God Reveals
[1:55:47] His Hidden Mysteries
[1:55:49] it's on our knees that God will bring to
[1:55:51] us the spirit of understanding our eyes
[1:55:55] to be open
[1:55:57] to hear
[1:55:59] our ears to be opened to hear our eyes
[1:56:03] should be opened to see Paul said I Has
[1:56:08] Not Seen Nor Ear hurt nor the heart of
[1:56:11] man conceived what God has kept in store
[1:56:14] for us he says but his Spirit has
[1:56:17] revealed them to us in these last days
[1:56:19] we are very grateful we are thankful to
[1:56:23] the Living God who has come to our age
[1:56:27] and in these days of spiritual blindness
[1:56:31] [Music]
[1:56:34] spiritual blindness has hit the people
[1:56:38] they are naked and wretched and blind
[1:56:41] and don't even know it they are
[1:56:43] spiritual Amnesia but God has anointed
[1:56:47] our eyes if I serve that we may see and
[1:56:51] behold wondrous things out of the
[1:56:53] message of our day oh Lord we thank you
[1:56:57] Lord we bless you Lord we adore you

[1:57:31] his confusion Lord May the same Angel be

[1:57:37] understanding Lord Jesus of the things
[1:57:41] that you have made known unto us then we

[1:59:32] look back studying the word backwards

[2:00:29] with all kinds of counterfeits all kinds
[2:00:32] of bogus dollar bills all kinds of
[2:00:34] programs all kinds of measuring of this
[2:00:38] and evidences and everything but we've
[2:00:40] got a pure word of God that's here to
[2:00:43] give us pure leadership into the things
[2:00:47] that God has for us
[2:00:49] hey man it's just when we all get hungry
[2:00:53] and say Lord I know there's more for me
[2:00:56] yes I know there's more for me you know
[2:00:59] our sister that got baptized during the
[2:01:03] meetings uh you know I I to me it was
[2:01:06] one of the greatest lines in the whole
[2:01:08] meeting
[2:01:09] she said I never believed it could feel
[2:01:12] as beautiful as this
[2:01:16] I never could imagine that it was this
[2:01:20] warm and this good yes all right you
[2:01:25] know if and you know we kind of lose
[2:01:27] that sometimes
[2:01:29] we got to go on Old experiences and and
[2:01:34] old knowledge and we just have our old
[2:01:37] knowledge kind of let let what we
[2:01:40] already know you know just go on it's
[2:01:43] like an old guy like me I I I
[2:01:46] technology you know what I mean
[2:01:49] I I come across a tool the other day at
[2:01:53] the store and and I was over there
[2:01:56] looking at this little little piece of
[2:01:59] wood that's got a little hook on it and
[2:02:01] you put the wire under the steel and
[2:02:04] then you put the hook in this and the
[2:02:06] hook in this and you twist it around
[2:02:09] and the guy come over here and he says
[2:02:11] let me show you this
[2:02:13] he says take this
[2:02:15] they just he said just press it on the
[2:02:18] steel and I pressed it on this deal and
[2:02:20] automatically wrapped it up wow

[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:29] like this you could do 10 times the work

[2:02:36] and just go out there and put all the
[2:02:37] other guys down
[2:02:39] well that's what it is what happened
[2:02:42] something came along
[2:02:44] right if you want to say we call it what
[2:02:47] technology or advancement well what do
[2:02:52] we call it we call it Enlightenment and
[2:02:55] understanding and Revelation something
[2:02:58] that God can show you and give you to
[2:03:02] make your life more victorious in him

[2:03:14] lot of hidden manna that in the
