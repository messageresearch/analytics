[47:07] sun has risen in the evening time it
[47:09] might sound like a paradox but the same
[47:11] Sun that Rose in the East is the same
[47:14] Sun that Rose in the west and we are a
[47:17] partaker of his divine nature aren't you
[47:19] glad for that amen we'll just read his
[47:22] word
[47:23] Romans 8 verse 1 a little lengthy
[47:27] reading of 11 verses but I just want to
[47:29] say this that it stands on its own
[47:32] it stands on its own it doesn't need no
[47:35] man to interpret uh but I just want to
[47:37] take our time and just reading it
[47:39] because oh if we could catch the
[47:41] Revelation that's packed in these 11
[47:43] verses right here oh my
[47:45] we could close the book we could say
[47:47] hallelujah we could shout a glory amen
[47:50] and we could Feast on that Eternal Word
[47:52] right there
[47:53] let's just read
[47:56] there is therefore now no condemnation
[47:58] to them
[48:00] which are in Christ Jesus
[48:03] who walk not after the flesh
[48:05] but after the spirit
[48:08] for the law of the spirit of life in
[48:12] Christ Jesus hath made me free
[48:15] from the law of sin and death
[48:19] for what the law could not do
[48:21] and that it was weak through the flesh
[48:24] God sending his own son in the likeness
[48:27] of sinful flesh and for sin
[48:30] condemned sin in the flesh
[48:33] that the righteousness of the law might
[48:36] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[48:38] the flesh but after the spirit
[48:42] for they that are after The Flesh do
[48:44] mind the things of the flesh but they
[48:46] that are after the spirit the things of
[48:49] the spirit for to be carnally minded is
[48:52] death but to be spiritually minded is
[48:54] life
[48:55] and peace
[48:57] because the carnal mind is enmity
[49:00] against God
[49:01] for it is not subject to the law of God
[49:03] neither indeed can be
[49:06] so then they that are in the flesh
[49:09] cannot please God
[49:12] but you
[49:14] the people sitting under this building
[49:16] tonight
[49:18] but you
[49:19] put your name in it
[49:21] but you are not in the flesh well thanks
[49:24] be to God but you are not in the flesh
[49:26] but in the spirit
[49:29] if so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[49:32] you now if any man have not the spirit
[49:35] of Christ he is none of his and if
[49:37] Christ be in you the body is dead
[49:40] because of sin
[49:42] but the spirit is life because of
[49:45] righteousness
[49:47] what were we hearing this morning
[49:50] talking about the new man
[49:52] the old man's dead and the old man it
[49:54] just produces deadness it produces
[49:57] separation from God but if you're in the
[49:59] new man there's life he says but if the
[50:02] spirit
[50:03] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[50:07] dead dwell in you he hath raised up
[50:09] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[50:12] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[50:15] dwelleth in you amen you may have your
[50:18] seats
[50:23] amen I just would also like to just read
[50:25] out of Luke chapter 4
[50:29] just
[50:31] reading a few scriptures and we'll we'll
[50:33] launch out to see how God would lead uh
[50:36] in this service something maybe that
[50:40] would um bless your heart by his grace
[50:44] but we'll just read in Luke
[50:46] chapter 4 verse 17.
[50:49] through 21 it would read like this and
[50:52] they delivered unto him the book of the
[50:55] prophet Isaiah
[50:56] and when he had opened the book he found
[50:58] the place where it was written so what
[51:01] was written it was a prophecy God had
[51:04] uttered his word through the mouth of a
[51:06] prophet and the word that was spoken it
[51:09] was written down and now Christ Jesus
[51:11] Christ is now taking uh the prophecy
[51:14] that was written and he finds the place
[51:16] in Isaiah he says the spirit of the Lord
[51:18] is upon me because he hath anointed me
[51:21] to preach the gospel to the poor he has
[51:24] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[51:27] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[51:29] the recovering of sight to the blind to
[51:31] set at Liberty them that are bruised to
[51:34] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[51:36] and we know that he stopped right there
[51:38] because the rest of it was pertaining to
[51:41] a second coming but he was taking the
[51:44] word of God and now he was he was taken
[51:46] the prophecy and saying hey this day
[51:49] this scripture is fulfilled the prophet
[51:52] has spoken it but now I am taking the
[51:55] spoken word and I'm declaring to you in
[51:58] this service that what was spoken by the
[52:00] Prophet this day this scripture is
[52:04] fulfilled
[52:05] I would like to just read a quote out of
[52:08] what is the attraction on the mountain
[52:10] and this would be the source of my
[52:12] inspiration as the prophet of God would
[52:14] say in paragraph 67 he would say what
[52:17] was the attraction later in Pilot's Hall
[52:19] I believe he's referring to to Pharaoh
[52:22] he says he says when the Sheep holder
[52:24] throw down a stick and it turned into a
[52:27] serpent God fulfilling his promise to
[52:30] Moses now I like to put myself into the
[52:33] Bible I like to put myself into the
[52:36] scripture so whenever you see a
[52:37] character or you see a patriarch of old
[52:40] or what God was doing to Moses what he
[52:42] was doing to Abraham what he was doing
[52:44] through Elijah I like to put myself in
[52:46] there because you realize it was Jesus
[52:48] Christ and Moses it was Jesus Christ and
[52:51] Elijah and if it was Christ in Moses
[52:53] then you were also there because you're
[52:55] a part of that word you're a part of
[52:57] that logos anything that Christ did the
[52:59] bride did with him oh I'm so glad about
[53:01] it you are in him you're part of that
[53:03] word your name is attached to it come on
[53:06] Church
[53:08] God fulfilling his promise to Moses what
[53:11] was the attraction at the Dead Sea when
[53:13] Pharaoh's horses were all astonished
[53:15] when they seen a wind come down from
[53:17] heavens and part the Red Sea from left
[53:19] and a poor bunch of slaves walking in
[53:23] the duty of God there it is what were
[53:25] they doing they were walking in the duty
[53:28] of God what is your reasonable service
[53:30] that we'd be a Living Sacrifice that
[53:33] would be walking in the duty of God that
[53:35] we be laying our life down
[53:38] they were walking in the duty of God
[53:41] walk across that on dry land what was it
[53:45] God keeping his word
[53:48] the deadness moved away a living people
[53:52] went across and a spiritually dead
[53:55] people tried to impersonate it and
[53:58] Drowned God fulfilling prophecy and
[54:02] making history I just want to read that
[54:04] again God keeping his word
[54:07] the deadness moved away
[54:09] a living people win a Christ and a
[54:12] spiritually dead people tried to
[54:14] impersonate it and drowned it God
[54:17] fulfilling prophecy and making history
[54:19] oh I I wish I could just uh play it as
[54:22] many times as me and brother Gary listen
[54:24] to it I don't know 10 20 30 times but
[54:27] I'm telling you I just rolled it over
[54:29] and over God let it sink in I let it
[54:32] reveal to me I want to catch it because
[54:34] oh one sentence from the prophet
[54:37] I'm telling you you can't even exhaust
[54:39] it
[54:41] oh I I want to try to stay focused and
[54:43] and and move forward here but I it's a
[54:46] Living Word it's spiritual food and due
[54:49] season you can take one quote you can
[54:51] take one sentence and you say oh God
[54:53] reveal it to me open it up peel back the
[54:55] layers I want to know more more of your
[54:57] person they're keeping God's word the
[55:00] deadness moved away
[55:03] oh I I'm telling that's what God's done
[55:06] that's what he did to each individual
[55:07] God was keeping his word and the
[55:09] deadness moved away a living people went
[55:12] across don't you know a living people
[55:14] he's made a way for a living people to
[55:17] go across
[55:18] a spiritually dead people tries to
[55:20] impersonate a religious people make
[55:23] believers they try to impersonate it but
[55:25] they die
[55:26] what is it it's God fulfilling prophecy
[55:29] in making history now the prophet of God
[55:31] when he would preach what is the
[55:33] attraction on the mount he he would he
[55:35] would really want to drive home this
[55:37] point
[55:38] he would say it over and over he would
[55:40] say God fulfilling prophecy God keep in
[55:44] his word what is the attraction on the
[55:46] mountain
[55:47] it's God fulfilling prophecy it's God
[55:50] keeping his word he'd say this in
[55:52] paragraph 46 he'd say God then what was
[55:55] he doing
[55:57] what is the attraction up there on the
[56:00] hill
[56:02] it's god making history
[56:06] and God fulfilling prophecy
[56:09] and that always causes an attraction
[56:13] it brings all the critics up the
[56:15] vultures of the morning's message and
[56:18] the Eagles he preached uh anointed ones
[56:21] in the end time that morning
[56:23] I believe and the Eagles also see they
[56:26] come together to find out what's going
[56:29] on
[56:31] some coming for curiosity
[56:35] some coming to find fault
[56:38] others coming to criticize nothing's
[56:42] changed Church
[56:49] nothing's changed
[56:51] there's all kinds gathered
[56:53] as we said this morning believers
[56:57] make Believers and unbelievers what's on
[57:00] the mountain
[57:02] prophecy is being fulfilled what's going
[57:06] on up there it's prophecy being
[57:10] fulfilled a word that God has spoken is
[57:14] now coming into manifestation something
[57:17] that was spoken by the mouthpiece of God
[57:19] is now uh being fulfilled
[57:23] what is the attraction up there on the
[57:25] hill what is the attraction what's going
[57:27] on what what's going on there in Bedford
[57:30] Texas what's going on in Christian Life
[57:32] Tabernacle what's going on in your home
[57:36] what's going on in your life what are
[57:39] all these things that you're going
[57:41] through these trials and this sickness
[57:43] and this battle that you're going
[57:45] through and you feel like God has left
[57:47] you alone now I want to say what is the
[57:48] attraction I want to say it's God
[57:51] fulfilling prophecy
[57:55] it's God's word being fulfilled
[58:00] and when I preached to you a little
[58:01] tonight if God would help me
[58:04] God fulfilling prophecy and making
[58:07] history
[58:09] and as a subject
[58:11] you are what God Made You
[58:15] see the prophet would say
[58:17] um
[58:19] in a sermon he preached in 53 I
[58:21] perceived that thou art a prophet but
[58:23] when the gift of Prophecy is operating
[58:26] cannot be received unless two or three
[58:28] judges see whether it's right or not but
[58:30] a prophet singular
[58:34] p-r-o-p-h-e-t is barned a prophet
[58:37] comes up a prophet everything he says in
[58:41] the name of the Lord is absolutely truth
[58:44] if he's prophesying I like to
[58:48] distinguish there if he's prophesying
[58:50] when Malachi 4 5 when Revelations 10 7
[58:54] was prophesied speaking it was none
[58:56] other than God himself taking the vessel
[59:00] using his vocal cords and his mouthpiece
[59:04] and speaking words
[59:07] he demonstrated that this microphone is
[59:10] a mute if I lay it down it says nothing
[59:12] but God would take uh the vocal cords he
[59:16] would take the mouth and when he would
[59:18] speak it was prophesying it was thus
[59:21] saith the Lord nothing could stop that
[59:24] word from from coming to pass
[59:28] I just want to just to labor a little
[59:31] bit on that when God speaks through his
[59:34] Prophet it's thus saith the Lord
[59:37] and then when that word that has been
[59:39] spoken comes to pass its history
[59:43] God's word being fulfilled and making
[59:45] history
[59:47] now many times we think about making
[59:49] history
[59:50] and maybe we think of man's achievements
[59:54] and what man has done and you know we
[59:56] could start to think of man uh making
[59:59] history and maybe things that have taken
[1:00:01] place in in the modern era you know
[1:00:04] where where the Wright brothers and I
[1:00:06] believe it's up to debate who who really
[1:00:08] flew the first plane or whoever made it
[1:00:10] up there but you know it was an
[1:00:11] accomplishment it was something that it
[1:00:13] was an achievement of man they were
[1:00:15] making history and and I believe a a
[1:00:19] Ford Henry Ford or he created the
[1:00:22] assembly line and made the the mass
[1:00:24] distribution of automobiles and he was
[1:00:27] making history he he took down the
[1:00:29] production of an automobile I think it
[1:00:31] took like 12 or 20 hours to make an
[1:00:34] automobile and he got it all the way
[1:00:35] down to an hour and oh that was a great
[1:00:38] achievement of man it goes into the
[1:00:41] record books and all of these things and
[1:00:43] sports and and everything you have it's
[1:00:45] all of these great achievements and and
[1:00:47] all of these milestones in it and it's
[1:00:50] man not making history it's it's it's
[1:00:53] something they deem that's important
[1:00:55] it's something that that is remembered
[1:00:57] it's something that is famous and it's
[1:00:59] remembered through history where you say
[1:01:01] oh you remember
[1:01:03] you remember back then when when they
[1:01:06] first started to make air condition
[1:01:09] and my we could actually live in a home
[1:01:12] where where there was a thermostat and
[1:01:14] and we could actually change the
[1:01:17] temperature oh the automobile and all of
[1:01:19] these things some of the old-timers can
[1:01:21] think back but yeah I remember I had no
[1:01:22] air condition I had none of those things
[1:01:24] and most of us not all of us but some of
[1:01:27] us remember what life was like without a
[1:01:29] cell phone
[1:01:31] oh Hallelujah
[1:01:33] you had to be a man of your word if you
[1:01:36] told somebody I'll be there at four
[1:01:37] o'clock you were there at four o'clock
[1:01:39] if you were going to meet somebody there
[1:01:41] you had directions you knew how to get
[1:01:43] there you had to map it out but now
[1:01:45] we're just like dumb driven cattle turn
[1:01:47] right turn left go here do there and you
[1:01:49] get there and if your phone dies you
[1:01:51] don't even know where to go I'm lost
[1:01:54] I don't know where I'm going like where
[1:01:55] are you trying to go I'm trying to go
[1:01:57] home
[1:01:57] you don't even know how to get home no
[1:01:59] I've just this thing just tells me
[1:02:01] everything it tells me to make a right
[1:02:03] tells me to make I think that's what the
[1:02:05] word of God should be doing I think
[1:02:07] that's what the message of the hour
[1:02:08] should be doing I think that's what the
[1:02:10] new man should be doing if you put off
[1:02:12] the former man the old man and you put
[1:02:15] on the new man it'll tell you turn right
[1:02:16] turn left go forward stop put on the
[1:02:20] brakes don't go any further I want to be
[1:02:23] a sheep that's led by the spirit I want
[1:02:25] to come in unity with Christ the
[1:02:27] headship with a Capstone where I don't
[1:02:29] speak unless he tells me to speak I want
[1:02:31] to say what the messenger said I want to
[1:02:34] stay in my place if I'm the final voice
[1:02:36] to this generation then I gotta be under
[1:02:38] the headship of the message of the hour
[1:02:40] I have to hear the great Eagle prophet
[1:02:43] and what he has spoken if I can take
[1:02:45] that word into my heart and catch a
[1:02:47] revelation of it then I am the final
[1:02:49] voice and the pride has thus said the
[1:02:52] Lord or she what
[1:02:54] I I think that's a problem I'm trying
[1:02:56] not to be Evangelistic uh tonight but I
[1:02:59] think that's a pro a lot of our problems
[1:03:01] some of us don't know how to keep still
[1:03:04] we run our mouths we run our legs and
[1:03:06] we're just busy bodies running here to
[1:03:08] and fro
[1:03:09] the prophet of God said we got to wait
[1:03:11] on our ministry some of us get so puffed
[1:03:14] up and we get so so zealed up and now
[1:03:17] we're just gonna run here and run there
[1:03:18] we need to wait upon the Lord the
[1:03:21] scripture says that they that wait upon
[1:03:22] the Lord hallelujah they shall renew
[1:03:25] their strength they shall rise up with
[1:03:28] wings as he goes they shall walk and
[1:03:30] shall not faint oh if you want to be led
[1:03:32] by the spirit of God why don't you wait
[1:03:35] just wait
[1:03:37] you've been praying for an answer you've
[1:03:39] been praying to make a decision and
[1:03:41] you're on the cusp of making a decision
[1:03:43] uh just because you're feeling the
[1:03:45] pressure wait upon the Lord
[1:03:47] be still and know that I am God
[1:03:53] oh well it seems like a great
[1:03:55] achievement but what has it done
[1:03:58] the cell phone
[1:04:00] I remember uh coming up man the first
[1:04:03] thing that came was a pager
[1:04:05] and you were a big time if you had a
[1:04:07] pager
[1:04:09] you're either a doctor or a drug dealer
[1:04:13] I don't know where you grew up I'm just
[1:04:15] saying
[1:04:17] you know if they had scrubs on and a
[1:04:20] pager
[1:04:21] doctor
[1:04:22] if they looked like that and had a pager
[1:04:28] right maybe because man you were big
[1:04:30] time like why do people need to get a
[1:04:32] hold of you uh Paige you're going off
[1:04:34] page you're going off you know I
[1:04:35] remember when I started my business it
[1:04:36] said page me
[1:04:38] you know because pager started to become
[1:04:40] a thing and then it became a cell phone
[1:04:42] and and all of this revolution uh
[1:04:44] technology that has made life so
[1:04:47] efficient has it
[1:04:51] I think we had more time
[1:04:54] before technology showed up
[1:04:57] because now we're busy getting so many
[1:04:59] things done well my I can get one
[1:05:02] million things done in a Day verse 10.
[1:05:05] and we leave half of it undone so now we
[1:05:07] got a million five to do the next day
[1:05:10] well we're we're on a we're on that
[1:05:12] direction but it's it's man's
[1:05:14] achievement it goes down in history the
[1:05:16] cell phone and then and then they put
[1:05:18] somebody on the moon and and all of
[1:05:20] these things it's man's achievements of
[1:05:23] that goes down into history and and and
[1:05:26] it it becomes a great date something
[1:05:28] that's celebrated something that's uh uh
[1:05:30] remembered
[1:05:31] and they had to have some type of
[1:05:33] thought they had to have some type of
[1:05:35] imagination and and some ability to
[1:05:37] start uh being inspired and they would
[1:05:40] put down the blueprint and they would
[1:05:41] write it all down and they would start
[1:05:42] to think well how can I accomplish this
[1:05:45] great goal and this great achievement
[1:05:46] that I have in my mind what would be the
[1:05:49] steps and through great trial and error
[1:05:51] and trying this and trying that they
[1:05:53] come up with some plan and and
[1:05:55] eventually they finally are successful
[1:05:58] in the and all of a sudden everybody
[1:05:59] recognize oh wow fantastic you landed on
[1:06:04] a big piece of dirt thousands of miles
[1:06:06] away
[1:06:07] when you probably could have
[1:06:10] Built Homes for all the homeless and you
[1:06:13] could have fed everybody
[1:06:14] but it was some great Monumental
[1:06:17] achievement
[1:06:20] but we see that in man because man is
[1:06:22] always trying to achieve something and
[1:06:24] for the sake of time we can start to
[1:06:26] talk about what God was wanting to
[1:06:28] achieve when when he said let there be
[1:06:30] light and everything that God was
[1:06:32] wanting to to achieve we we could labor
[1:06:34] on this point but we're Faithfully
[1:06:36] taught we know that God was wanting to
[1:06:37] have Fellowship uh God's an object of
[1:06:40] worship and he had all of these
[1:06:41] attributes and all of these things that
[1:06:43] he wanted to display if I could just get
[1:06:45] just a touch more on the monitor all of
[1:06:47] these things he he wanted to display so
[1:06:50] so he would he he was working to achieve
[1:06:53] something
[1:06:54] and just to maybe uh anchor down the
[1:06:57] point the prophet of God would say this
[1:06:58] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:07:00] say the entire Bible is an expression of
[1:07:03] one goal that God had one purpose he
[1:07:06] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[1:07:10] that sounds pretty important
[1:07:15] this is a big statement
[1:07:18] and all the acts of the Believers in the
[1:07:22] Bible has been in type
[1:07:26] and expressing what God's Great goal is
[1:07:32] what is this great goal what is this
[1:07:36] great achievement
[1:07:38] and now
[1:07:40] Hallelujah
[1:07:42] in the last days
[1:07:44] he has revealed it and shows it
[1:07:50] oh that excites my soul
[1:07:53] to be a part of this one great goal this
[1:07:56] one great plan that God has always had
[1:07:59] it's been sealed down Through the Ages
[1:08:01] Every believer that every went before
[1:08:04] they were all in types testifying to
[1:08:07] this day
[1:08:09] Hallelujah testify to this day that God
[1:08:13] had a purpose that he would Express
[1:08:15] himself in Jesus Christ that he would
[1:08:19] have the preeminence in a bride in the
[1:08:21] last age and he would take her home to
[1:08:24] Eden again that was his great goal that
[1:08:27] was his great achievement that's what
[1:08:29] God was wanting to do
[1:08:32] and as we move forward God would speak
[1:08:35] to Abraham in Genesis 12 verse 1. maybe
[1:08:38] we can just find a a a a a pace here if
[1:08:41] you want to follow me in the scriptures
[1:08:42] Genesis 12 1.
[1:08:47] if we get lengthy I thought we were
[1:08:49] going to be short and anytime a preacher
[1:08:51] thinks he's going to be short he's going
[1:08:52] to be lengthy
[1:08:54] so if you gotta if you gotta go eat this
[1:08:57] is not mandatory
[1:08:59] total voluntary
[1:09:01] the deacons are not uh uh um what do you
[1:09:04] call those people obey they're not
[1:09:06] bailiffs or jailers like you can't get
[1:09:08] out
[1:09:09] you're free to go
[1:09:12] let's just walk through the scripture a
[1:09:14] little bit we'll try to Pace ourselves I
[1:09:16] I find there's times where I move
[1:09:19] quickly
[1:09:21] and if I slow down
[1:09:23] and cover the same material
[1:09:26] we'll see what happens
[1:09:29] Genesis 12 1 would say now the Lord has
[1:09:31] said unto Abraham
[1:09:33] get thee out of thy country
[1:09:36] from thy kindred
[1:09:38] and from my father's house
[1:09:40] unto a land that I will show thee
[1:09:51] and I will make thee a great nation
[1:09:55] and I will bless thee
[1:09:58] and make
[1:09:59] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[1:10:02] blessing
[1:10:06] so
[1:10:08] verse 2 says and I will make thee
[1:10:13] remember our subject here is you are
[1:10:16] what God Made You
[1:10:20] okay so so God is saying and I
[1:10:24] will make thee a great nation
[1:10:27] and I will bless thee
[1:10:30] now I just want to get a little ahead of
[1:10:32] myself because
[1:10:33] God Jesus Christ himself God and more
[1:10:37] faith came again according to Divine
[1:10:40] promise in this generation
[1:10:42] and spoke a creative word
[1:10:46] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:10:49] that took on flesh and our generation
[1:10:52] and spoke a creative word and said I
[1:10:55] will have a bride
[1:10:59] he said he would do it
[1:11:01] he spoke the word
[1:11:04] just as he told Abraham and I will
[1:11:08] not you will Abraham
[1:11:10] this is not something that you are going
[1:11:12] to do Abraham but this is something that
[1:11:15] I am going to do actually I'm just
[1:11:18] mirroring I'm just showing a mirror or a
[1:11:20] type or a shadow in your life Abraham of
[1:11:24] my great achievement that I want to
[1:11:27] achieve in the end time that I want to
[1:11:29] have a bride and I'm going to speak my
[1:11:32] word it's going to be a prophetic word
[1:11:34] it's going to be a prophecy that is
[1:11:37] going to be fulfilled and when that
[1:11:39] prophecy is spoken and it's fulfilled
[1:11:41] then it's history
[1:11:45] and I will make thee a great nation and
[1:11:49] I will bless thee God said I will
[1:11:54] now we look at the scripture says and
[1:11:56] Abraham staggered not at the promises of
[1:11:58] God
[1:11:59] well if I wanted to be an intellectual
[1:12:03] I would want to say doesn't look that
[1:12:05] way to me
[1:12:08] looks like he kind of staggered
[1:12:12] I mean Lord I'm just saying
[1:12:17] I mean did he not like you know
[1:12:20] take Hagar and
[1:12:22] try to give his wife away twice I mean
[1:12:26] didn't he stagger a little bit but see
[1:12:28] God was not looking at what Abraham
[1:12:30] could do
[1:12:32] Abraham's inability was not a part of
[1:12:36] the equation
[1:12:38] why did Abraham stagger an audit the
[1:12:41] promise of God
[1:12:42] because there was something in Abraham
[1:12:44] that wouldn't stagger
[1:12:46] Hallelujah no matter of the false no
[1:12:50] matter the failures now how many times
[1:12:53] he tried to give up there was something
[1:12:55] inside of Abraham That Couldn't stagger
[1:12:58] it was a very Jean seed of God something
[1:13:02] that was in there that identified with
[1:13:04] the message and said I will make thee a
[1:13:07] great nation I Will Bless thee see there
[1:13:10] was something in Abraham that could not
[1:13:12] stop until it got to the achievement
[1:13:16] it wasn't what Abraham was doing it was
[1:13:20] what God was doing in Abraham
[1:13:24] so we look at the beginning
[1:13:27] Abraham oh we don't want to get on that
[1:13:29] trail
[1:13:31] story of Abraham would be a long time
[1:13:34] get you out separate yourself
[1:13:37] he didn't even know where he was going
[1:13:40] but it was by faith he knew he was going
[1:13:42] somewhere well where was he going God
[1:13:43] said hey start going where am I going
[1:13:46] don't worry about it I'm taking you
[1:13:48] somewhere
[1:13:49] when you hear the message of the hour
[1:13:51] you really don't even know where it's
[1:13:52] taken you you just know you want to go
[1:13:54] wherever it's going
[1:13:56] hey I'm still there I'm saying wherever
[1:13:58] this message takes me I want to go
[1:14:00] it brings up the critics it brings up
[1:14:02] the vultures it brings up the
[1:14:04] unbelievers they're all finding fault
[1:14:06] I'm just getting on board
[1:14:08] I'm on this ship to Zion wherever this
[1:14:12] message takes me I want to go because
[1:14:14] outside of this message there ain't no
[1:14:16] guarantee there ain't no safety it's
[1:14:19] just judgment it's wrecked lives there's
[1:14:22] no Solutions but oh if you get into
[1:14:24] Christ if you get into the Capstone if
[1:14:28] you get into the message of the hour
[1:14:29] that's where it's at
[1:14:33] foreign
[1:14:34] but Abraham
[1:14:35] how many trials
[1:14:37] how many faults how many failures and
[1:14:41] then just in simple Simplicity of nature
[1:14:47] impossible
[1:14:49] for him and Sarah to have a child
[1:14:54] but what happened out there on the
[1:14:55] plains of memory
[1:14:59] God confirming his Covenant
[1:15:02] God appearing unto Abraham
[1:15:06] the scripture would say this in Genesis
[1:15:09] 18 14.
[1:15:13] what's happening
[1:15:15] God said I will
[1:15:18] and if God says I will there's a time we
[1:15:21] come and say God did
[1:15:24] Hallelujah
[1:15:26] God said he had save you God said he
[1:15:28] would heal you God said he would deliver
[1:15:30] you there comes a time where you
[1:15:31] recognize he said he will and then you
[1:15:33] can stand up and say he did
[1:15:37] Hallelujah and there on the plains of
[1:15:40] memory God appeared uh Melchizedek he
[1:15:44] said where is thy why Sarah because now
[1:15:47] everything that I've promised you
[1:15:48] Abraham
[1:15:50] I'm here to tell you I'm going to
[1:15:52] perform that which I had spoken unto you
[1:15:56] lord it's been so hard it's been a rough
[1:15:58] road these three or four years I've been
[1:16:00] barely able to keep it together I don't
[1:16:03] ever see how the promise is going to
[1:16:05] come into manifestation but here God was
[1:16:08] appearing God in more faith in
[1:16:10] Melchizedek to declare unto Abraham and
[1:16:13] Sarah I'm going to perform that which I
[1:16:16] had spoken
[1:16:18] and Genesis 18 14 says is there anything
[1:16:21] too hard for God is there anything too
[1:16:24] hard for the Lord
[1:16:26] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:16:31] well take that need right now
[1:16:33] take that bird and take that heartache
[1:16:35] take that pain take that infirmity in
[1:16:38] your flesh
[1:16:40] go ahead attach the word to it
[1:16:42] we come here to do battle tonight
[1:16:45] we're doing spiritual warfare
[1:16:48] is there anything too hard
[1:16:52] for the Lord
[1:16:57] at the time appointed
[1:16:59] I will return unto thee according
[1:17:02] to the time of life and Sarah
[1:17:05] shall have a son
[1:17:10] prophecy
[1:17:12] the spoken word and now jump over to
[1:17:14] Genesis 21 verse 2.
[1:17:23] for Sarah
[1:17:25] conceived
[1:17:29] God prophesied God promised God said he
[1:17:33] will
[1:17:34] and he did
[1:17:36] for Sarah can conceived and bear Abraham
[1:17:40] a son in his old age
[1:17:42] at the set time of which God had spoken
[1:17:47] to him
[1:17:48] at the set time
[1:17:52] not at your timing not at Abraham's
[1:17:55] timing not when everything is going good
[1:17:57] not when you have the ability not when
[1:18:00] you're up on the Mountaintop not when it
[1:18:02] seems like it's the perfect time not
[1:18:04] when it seems like you got it all
[1:18:06] figured out but at the set time at the
[1:18:09] time that God said he would do it you
[1:18:12] see he he already spoke his word he
[1:18:15] already knew exactly the time and the
[1:18:19] hour of when he would bring that promise
[1:18:21] to life
[1:18:26] at a set time
[1:18:29] what was it God fulfilling his word
[1:18:33] and making history
[1:18:35] that which what he had promised
[1:18:38] that which he said he would do
[1:18:41] prophecy being fulfilled
[1:18:44] and Sarah conceived god making history
[1:18:50] Isaiah 55 and 11.
[1:18:54] I love to hear this Pages Russell right
[1:18:57] so get them Bibles out
[1:19:01] put that sword to work
[1:19:03] Isaiah 55 and 11.
[1:19:16] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:19:19] of my mouth
[1:19:22] it shall not return unto me void
[1:19:26] but it shall accomplish
[1:19:29] Glory that which I please
[1:19:32] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[1:19:34] unto I sent it
[1:19:39] so shall the word be that goeth forth
[1:19:42] out of my mouth
[1:19:44] it's not going to turn void it's not
[1:19:47] going to not accomplish what he said he
[1:19:51] would do when he told Abraham I Will
[1:19:54] Bless Thee I will make thee a father of
[1:19:57] Nations I'm going to bless your seed
[1:20:00] that word could not return void it was
[1:20:03] thus saith the Lord but it shall
[1:20:05] accomplish that which I please and it
[1:20:07] shall prosper in the thing where unto I
[1:20:10] sent it
[1:20:11] I want to say this when God speaks
[1:20:15] he has an intended target
[1:20:19] it's not guesswork
[1:20:21] it's not some broad wide way
[1:20:25] it's straight
[1:20:27] it's narrow
[1:20:29] it's precise
[1:20:32] it's exact
[1:20:34] it hits the mark
[1:20:37] it's not two inches to the left
[1:20:39] it's not a a billionth of a centimeter
[1:20:42] to the right
[1:20:44] it's exactly on the target
[1:20:47] it's exactly on the time
[1:20:49] at the set time the set Place God spoke
[1:20:54] the word it's going to hit the mark
[1:20:58] because the word is accurate
[1:21:01] the word of God is quick
[1:21:04] it's alive
[1:21:06] that's what that means right when you're
[1:21:08] quickened what does it mean to be quick
[1:21:09] and made life the word of God is quick
[1:21:12] it's alive
[1:21:14] that's why it can be a discerner of the
[1:21:16] thoughts and intents of your heart
[1:21:19] it's not a an algorithm
[1:21:23] it's not a a some type of of throwing
[1:21:28] something out there oh somebody here
[1:21:32] you're not back pain
[1:21:37] I know I'm right
[1:21:41] somebody here
[1:21:42] you've had a hard day
[1:21:45] somebody here it was hard for you to get
[1:21:47] to church tonight
[1:21:50] well
[1:21:52] yeah that's a really broad way
[1:21:55] and I think while we're getting a little
[1:21:57] sidestepping here but oh God is so
[1:22:00] faithful
[1:22:02] that some fake
[1:22:05] chicken can stand up on the platform and
[1:22:08] impersonate the word of God
[1:22:10] but if somebody out there believes it's
[1:22:13] a God and but God will honor his word
[1:22:16] that's why people come out of Benny
[1:22:18] hinns and all these peoples
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:21] you know out of these these Pentecostal
[1:22:24] uproars and they're coming out and
[1:22:26] there's healings and there's Deliverance
[1:22:28] why that doesn't vindicate the
[1:22:31] organization that doesn't vindicate the
[1:22:33] man that vindicates my God the god of
[1:22:35] Mercy my God's a god of compassion my
[1:22:39] God's A Healer
[1:22:40] my God honors his word even if it's
[1:22:44] spoken out of the mouth of a hypocrite
[1:22:47] God will honor his word to the believer
[1:22:52] because it hits its mark
[1:22:55] it has an intended target
[1:22:59] it's sharper than any two-edged sword it
[1:23:01] pierces even to the dividing asunder of
[1:23:04] Soul and Spirit
[1:23:06] now we're talking about the Triune being
[1:23:11] your flesh your spirit your soul
[1:23:15] and the joints and marrowsing is a
[1:23:17] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:23:18] the heart
[1:23:21] when we look into Genesis 3 15.
[1:23:28] I want to hear pages ruffling
[1:23:34] when you look into Genesis 3 15.
[1:23:38] in this scripture oh my
[1:23:40] God oh Hallelujah
[1:23:45] what a word
[1:23:48] if you knew
[1:23:50] how much was packed into that scripture
[1:23:54] Glory
[1:23:57] Glory
[1:24:00] when God spoke that word
[1:24:03] Hallelujah he said an eye
[1:24:06] we'll put imagey between thee and the
[1:24:08] woman
[1:24:10] and between thy seed and her seed
[1:24:14] it shall bruise
[1:24:16] thy head
[1:24:19] and thou shalt bruise his Hill
[1:24:24] I just want to say that that word
[1:24:27] that prophecy was a heat-seeking missile
[1:24:31] you know they got in all of their
[1:24:32] defense and all their Technologies and
[1:24:34] now the mightiest Nations
[1:24:38] in the world are having balloon fights
[1:24:43] hey I shot down a balloon today well I
[1:24:46] mean haven't we all
[1:24:51] it's a that prophecy oh
[1:24:55] it was so alive
[1:24:57] it was so real it was so precise down to
[1:25:01] the hour down to the moment down to the
[1:25:05] time down down to everything we was
[1:25:08] going to hit the mark
[1:25:10] when he said I will put enmity between
[1:25:13] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[1:25:16] and ourseling it shall bruise thy head
[1:25:18] and thou shalt bruise its Hill it it was
[1:25:22] going to hit the mark
[1:25:24] his word won't return void
[1:25:27] it's going to accomplish the thing that
[1:25:29] he said it would accomplish
[1:25:32] look all heaven was behind it all of God
[1:25:35] was behind it it was thus saith the Lord
[1:25:39] the prophet of God would say this and
[1:25:41] Satan's Eden
[1:25:44] paragraph 89.
[1:25:51] he said every seed
[1:25:53] will bring forth of its kind
[1:25:57] if you are a seed of God an attribute a
[1:26:00] son of God
[1:26:01] then the word of God is sown in you
[1:26:06] who did it
[1:26:08] God did it
[1:26:09] God told Abraham I will I will
[1:26:14] every seed must bring forth of its kind
[1:26:16] if you are a seed of God
[1:26:20] an attribute a Son of God then the word
[1:26:23] of God is sown in you
[1:26:26] the word did not come from an outside
[1:26:29] influence
[1:26:32] it was something that was already in
[1:26:35] there
[1:26:36] and it was a deep calling to a deep and
[1:26:39] there had to be a deep there had to be a
[1:26:42] word if I could say it like this
[1:26:44] this had to know where it came from I
[1:26:48] came from somewhere I belonged to
[1:26:52] something there has been something sewed
[1:26:55] in me and it will not stop it cannot
[1:26:58] rest it cannot return void it has to
[1:27:02] come back into contact with the thing
[1:27:05] that sowed the word
[1:27:12] if you are a seed of God an attribute a
[1:27:15] Son of God then the word of God is sown
[1:27:17] in you see and then when you hear the
[1:27:19] word of God my sheep hear my voice a
[1:27:23] stranger they won't follow you get it
[1:27:25] every seed comes forth after its own
[1:27:29] kind
[1:27:31] every seed you are a seed
[1:27:37] both naturally and spiritually you are a
[1:27:41] seed of the word
[1:27:43] now if we look into the Bible into
[1:27:45] Isaiah 7 verse 14.
[1:28:01] okay
[1:28:03] once again
[1:28:05] remember what a prophet is Isaiah was
[1:28:07] born a prophet
[1:28:09] this isn't guesswork
[1:28:11] this is this is God speaking
[1:28:14] with an intended target an attended
[1:28:17] place an attended time
[1:28:22] therefore verse 14 it says therefore the
[1:28:24] Lord himself
[1:28:26] shall give you a sign
[1:28:28] I the Lord
[1:28:30] I am going to give you a sign
[1:28:33] okay Isaiah what is that sign going to
[1:28:36] be what is it that you are going to do
[1:28:39] what is this great sign that you're
[1:28:41] going to give us Behold a virgin shall
[1:28:45] conceive
[1:28:47] to think something that was supposed to
[1:28:49] be a sign
[1:28:50] was one of the most intimate personal
[1:28:53] things that could take place
[1:28:55] not a public show
[1:28:58] this isn't something that's done out in
[1:29:00] the open
[1:29:01] but the sign that he was going to give
[1:29:03] he says Behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:29:07] and bear a son and shall call his name
[1:29:10] Emmanuel
[1:29:13] God With Us
[1:29:17] the prophet spoke the word
[1:29:19] the word went forth and that word caught
[1:29:24] and the womb of a virgin
[1:29:26] now if you go study that a little bit
[1:29:29] when he says that word caught in the
[1:29:31] womb of a virgin God's patterns do not
[1:29:34] change
[1:29:36] where did that word First Catch
[1:29:39] in the womb of her mind
[1:29:42] that's what the prophet taught amen
[1:29:45] oh
[1:29:49] the word so deep and so rich
[1:29:53] just as Eve right to be deceived where
[1:29:56] did that word first
[1:29:58] conceive
[1:29:59] in our mind
[1:30:01] and once the word was conceived in the
[1:30:03] womb of her spirit which is the mind
[1:30:05] then the natural act came
[1:30:09] so a virgin shall conceive she first cut
[1:30:13] that word in the womb of her mind and
[1:30:16] then brought forth the manifestation of
[1:30:19] what was spoken
[1:30:22] the prophet spoke the word went forth
[1:30:25] the word caught in the womb of a virgin
[1:30:28] and I just want to say that Mary was the
[1:30:31] intended target
[1:30:35] Mary was the intended target
[1:30:39] Hallelujah
[1:30:41] when God said a version shall conceive
[1:30:46] it wasn't guesswork
[1:30:48] it wasn't I I wonder who it will be
[1:30:52] it's not like the Oklahoma Gold Rush
[1:30:55] first come first serve I wonder who will
[1:30:59] figure out the riddle we're not in an
[1:31:02] escape room trying to figure out all the
[1:31:04] clues so we can be the first one to the
[1:31:06] promise no the promise had a name on it
[1:31:10] Glory
[1:31:11] the promise had a name attached to it
[1:31:15] when he said a virgin shall conceive he
[1:31:18] knew the name he knew the place he knew
[1:31:21] the time he knew the age he knew the
[1:31:24] hour he knew everything about everything
[1:31:26] about the individual whereas that
[1:31:29] prophecy was going to take place because
[1:31:31] it had an intended target
[1:31:39] the prophecy had a name on it
[1:31:43] you know it's like getting a gift
[1:31:45] you're on Christmas time everybody gets
[1:31:46] gifts well
[1:31:49] to eliminate chaos
[1:31:51] it's good to put names on them
[1:31:54] and then everybody knows what's theirs
[1:31:58] you don't have to wonder whose this is
[1:32:00] because there's a name on it
[1:32:05] little did Mary know that her name was
[1:32:08] attached to a prophecy
[1:32:11] think of it
[1:32:13] what a prophecy
[1:32:15] what a promise
[1:32:17] what a word
[1:32:18] that the Vindicated prophet of Isaiah
[1:32:21] said a virgin I'm going to give the
[1:32:23] generation I'm going to give the world
[1:32:26] I'm going to give mankind uh from
[1:32:29] beginning to end I'm going to give you a
[1:32:30] sign
[1:32:33] a version shall conceive
[1:32:36] little did Mary know that she was a part
[1:32:39] of that prophetic word
[1:32:42] and 800 years later what the word caught
[1:32:44] in the womb of aversion
[1:32:47] what was it
[1:32:49] God fulfilling prophecy
[1:32:52] god making history
[1:32:56] right
[1:32:58] what he promised
[1:33:02] now has been manifested
[1:33:06] you with me
[1:33:08] and this excites me we're working
[1:33:09] towards something
[1:33:11] because this all pertains to something
[1:33:13] that God has done in you
[1:33:16] this all pertains to something that God
[1:33:19] has spoken in this hour concerning you
[1:33:22] and I want to say that your name is
[1:33:24] attached to it
[1:33:25] you are the intended target
[1:33:31] prophet of God said in the spoken word
[1:33:33] is the Original Seed he said no matter
[1:33:35] how much anybody criticized
[1:33:39] how many things somebody else said that
[1:33:41] didn't have one thing to do with it she
[1:33:44] believed God's word regardless
[1:33:47] there was something to Mary
[1:33:51] that staggered not at the word that was
[1:33:54] spoken because she identified with it
[1:33:58] she said be it unto me according to Thy
[1:34:01] word because it was something that she
[1:34:04] was a part of it sounded like home when
[1:34:06] she heard all her mother which she would
[1:34:09] read those scriptures of the prophets
[1:34:10] prophecies to her and say oh God is
[1:34:13] going to give us a sign a virgin shall
[1:34:16] conceive his name Shall be Called
[1:34:18] Emmanuel I imagine something in Mary
[1:34:21] just bubbled up like oh wouldn't that be
[1:34:25] something how is it going to come to
[1:34:27] pass who is going to be that blessed one
[1:34:30] but something inside her believed that
[1:34:33] word because she was attached to it
[1:34:39] no matter how much anybody criticized
[1:34:43] how many things somebody else said that
[1:34:45] didn't have one thing to do with it she
[1:34:48] believed God's word regardless
[1:34:50] regardless of what
[1:34:53] regardless of everything
[1:34:57] regardless of everything
[1:34:59] regardless of the critic
[1:35:02] regardless of her family
[1:35:07] Mary had a tough road
[1:35:09] the very man she was espoused to be
[1:35:12] married to
[1:35:15] she had to stand before her parents
[1:35:18] and her husband Joseph and testify and
[1:35:21] say the thing that has conceived in me
[1:35:26] is that which the prophet prophesied
[1:35:30] a virgin shall conceive
[1:35:34] behold I give you a sign and I am that
[1:35:39] sign
[1:35:40] I am a part of the prophecy
[1:35:44] she could stand there and say this day
[1:35:48] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:35:52] you imagine she could be stoned
[1:35:56] excommunicated
[1:35:58] divorced
[1:36:00] marked sent away but something inside of
[1:36:04] Mary could not deny
[1:36:07] she could not deny what she was a part
[1:36:10] of it was her identification it was who
[1:36:14] she was
[1:36:17] you are a seed
[1:36:20] you are a word seed
[1:36:22] you are Abraham's seed
[1:36:25] you are what the word says you are
[1:36:29] well that's a little bit of what our
[1:36:31] subject is right you are what God Made
[1:36:34] You
[1:36:35] now the prophet of God would say this
[1:36:36] and spoken word is the Original Seed
[1:36:39] you might as well put your seatbelt on I
[1:36:41] don't plan on finishing anytime soon I'm
[1:36:43] just going to deliver the burden so the
[1:36:45] spoken word is the Original Seed and
[1:36:47] like I said you're welcome to go we are
[1:36:49] predestinated why
[1:36:52] I love the word
[1:36:56] we are predestinated why
[1:36:59] Christ is the Original Seed
[1:37:03] and this Original Seed was predestinated
[1:37:06] by foreknowledge of God knowing that the
[1:37:09] fall would come
[1:37:10] and predestinated him to take our place
[1:37:15] you get it
[1:37:17] All Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:37:20] predestinated
[1:37:24] but you say then will he condemn some
[1:37:28] no sir
[1:37:30] ha
[1:37:31] how you like that devil
[1:37:35] will he condemn son no sir
[1:37:39] All The Heavens back in that
[1:37:43] you are a son and daughter of God
[1:37:46] will God condemn you
[1:37:48] no sir
[1:37:52] I think oh God put this on my heart
[1:37:56] sister you've been living under
[1:37:58] condemnation too long
[1:38:03] the reason you feel condemned is because
[1:38:05] you've been delivered
[1:38:07] and you keep falling to the same battle
[1:38:09] over and over and over and Satan is
[1:38:13] trying to put condemnation on your life
[1:38:16] and you feel that every time you fall
[1:38:19] and come back to the same thing that you
[1:38:21] were delivered from you feel unworthy
[1:38:23] you feel like the promise isn't for you
[1:38:25] and you're right back in the same
[1:38:27] situation that God delivered you from
[1:38:30] and you're starting to feel unworthy
[1:38:32] you're starting to feel like the promise
[1:38:33] isn't for you you feel like you're just
[1:38:35] going through the cycle you're scared to
[1:38:37] go up for prayer anymore you're scared
[1:38:39] to go to special meetings because you
[1:38:41] feel like the need is going to be called
[1:38:42] out and you're going to feel some need
[1:38:44] to go through a prayer line you're going
[1:38:46] to feel some need to go through an altar
[1:38:48] and God deals with those things in that
[1:38:50] way but I want to tell you that this is
[1:38:52] the day of salvation right there in your
[1:38:55] Pew right there in your seat by the
[1:38:58] preaching of the Lord this is the day of
[1:39:00] salvation this is the hour of your
[1:39:03] deliverance you don't have to live under
[1:39:05] condemnation no more why because cause
[1:39:07] you are a daughter of God will God
[1:39:10] condemn any daughter of his no sir
[1:39:14] take the devil
[1:39:17] God's children are not condemned
[1:39:21] Glory
[1:39:24] so where is that condemnation coming
[1:39:26] from it is not coming from your heavenly
[1:39:29] father it's coming from the old man it's
[1:39:32] coming from those Gates of the old flesh
[1:39:34] and you got to die to that thing take
[1:39:36] that old devil's head off tonight say
[1:39:39] I'm tired of living after the old man I
[1:39:42] am going to put on the new man and I
[1:39:45] will be delivered
[1:39:47] it's for you it's your promise it's who
[1:39:51] you are it's what God Made You
[1:39:55] Hallelujah

[1:40:13] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:40:16] to them which are in Christ Jesus
[1:40:21] when did you get into Christ
[1:40:24] when you were born again
[1:40:26] you were always in Christ
[1:40:30] you're just an attribute that was placed
[1:40:36] that God wanted to express in the
[1:40:39] evening time
[1:40:40] and you are trapped into it
[1:40:43] you came in a fallen condition under
[1:40:46] spiritual Amnesia under the old man not
[1:40:49] knowing who you are but don't you
[1:40:51] realize the new man is the real you
[1:40:55] the new man is really Who You Are
[1:40:58] but the flesh
[1:41:00] the old man wants to lay claim to your
[1:41:03] soul Oh Glory to God but it can't have
[1:41:06] it it's sealed off it's predestinated

[1:41:17] her she's nine

[1:41:24] daughter
[1:41:24] I said I would have a bride and she's
[1:41:27] the intended target
[1:41:30] Glory
[1:41:33] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:41:37] to them which are in Christ Jesus
[1:41:40] who walk not after the flesh
[1:41:43] but after the spirit if you need to take
[1:41:45] your bathroom break take it I'm in page

[1:43:04] Paul said it there's no condemnation to
[1:43:06] them which are in Christ Jesus
[1:43:08] who walked not after the flesh but after
[1:43:10] the spirit Romans 4 8.
[1:43:12] blessed is the man
[1:43:15] blessed is the man
[1:43:18] glory to God there's a blessed man
[1:43:20] there's a blessed son there's a blessed
[1:43:23] daughter tonight
[1:43:24] blessed Romans 4. blessed is the man to
[1:43:27] whom the Lord
[1:43:29] will not impute sin
[1:43:33] blessed is the man
[1:43:36] you know I was just thinking about it it
[1:43:37] came to me
[1:43:38] there came a time in the scripture where
[1:43:40] David
[1:43:41] you know David was a man after God's Own
[1:43:43] Heart but David had his own faults and
[1:43:45] his own failures
[1:43:47] and I was thinking about the man
[1:43:49] blessed is the man
[1:43:51] well one day David did some things
[1:43:54] he let lust uh be conceived in his mind
[1:43:57] and he acted on that lust and he he
[1:44:00] brought an adulterous relationship unto
[1:44:02] his kingdom unto his house
[1:44:04] in Bathsheba and then he killed a man
[1:44:08] to cover up his tracks
[1:44:11] trying to cover up what he did and so
[1:44:14] what did Samuel the man of God came unto
[1:44:16] him and said look oh and Nathan Nathan
[1:44:18] came to him said David I want to tell
[1:44:20] you a story but there was a rich man Oh
[1:44:22] my he had he had ten thousands of sheep
[1:44:26] ah they were the best sheep in all the
[1:44:28] land but but here here was this whole
[1:44:31] this this poor man
[1:44:33] and all he had was one sheep
[1:44:36] and the rich man took that poor man's
[1:44:40] only sheep
[1:44:41] and he dressed it and he served it to
[1:44:44] his guest and he took the only thing
[1:44:46] that that man had of value
[1:44:49] and David
[1:44:51] in his righteous judgment
[1:44:56] looked at the prophet
[1:44:59] like the prophet needed to inquire of
[1:45:01] David
[1:45:02] that might have been the first lesson
[1:45:03] say whatever you say
[1:45:05] prophet
[1:45:08] but Nathan said what should come of the
[1:45:11] man
[1:45:12] he shall surely die
[1:45:16] and Nathan looked right back at David
[1:45:19] and said David
[1:45:21] you are that man
[1:45:25] you're that man David
[1:45:29] I want to say we're all like David
[1:45:32] we are all guilty
[1:45:35] we are all worthy of death
[1:45:38] we were all born in sin
[1:45:41] but then the great Apostle Paul in
[1:45:44] Ephesians 2 4 would say it like this
[1:45:48] see David was that man
[1:45:51] you are that man well we were talking
[1:45:53] about blessed is the man
[1:45:55] well we're taking the negative
[1:45:57] David was that man and Ephesians chapter
[1:46:01] 2 verse 4 I'm giving him time Ephesians
[1:46:03] chapter 2 verse 4 says but God
[1:46:07] who is rich in Mercy
[1:46:12] Hallelujah
[1:46:15] but God
[1:46:17] who is rich in Mercy
[1:46:22] for his great love
[1:46:25] where and he loved us
[1:46:28] even when we were dead in sins
[1:46:32] hath Quicken us together with Christ
[1:46:35] by grace
[1:46:38] are you saved
[1:46:40] David you're the man
[1:46:43] you're the guilty one
[1:46:47] but Paul would say in Romans 5. verse
[1:46:51] 20.
[1:46:54] he would say moreover
[1:46:58] Romans 5 verse 20 you would say more
[1:47:00] over the law entered
[1:47:02] that the offense might abound
[1:47:05] see David was guilty because there was a
[1:47:07] law
[1:47:08] David was guilty and because there was
[1:47:10] law the scripture says uh the the the
[1:47:12] the the the strength of sin is the life
[1:47:15] there was no law then there would be no
[1:47:16] strength there would be nothing behind
[1:47:18] it there would be no enforcement because
[1:47:20] there would be no law there would be no
[1:47:22] penalty but because the law came because
[1:47:25] there was a law that the offense might
[1:47:27] abound
[1:47:29] we all were born in sin
[1:47:32] but we're sin abounded
[1:47:34] Grace
[1:47:38] did much more abound
[1:47:43] blessed be the man you are that man you
[1:47:47] were that man that was guilty you were
[1:47:50] that man that was born in sin you were
[1:47:52] that man
[1:47:54] that was worthy of death
[1:47:57] but Grace did abound
[1:48:01] that you might be the man
[1:48:04] whom God will not impute sin
[1:48:08] why
[1:48:10] you're the predestinated Son and
[1:48:13] Daughter of God
[1:48:15] God cannot condemn you
[1:48:19] why because he said he wouldn't
[1:48:24] this is Victory Church
[1:48:27] hey we're soaring in the heavenlies
[1:48:30] we are seated in Heavenly places in
[1:48:32] Christ Jesus
[1:48:35] you are a predestinated son and daughter
[1:48:38] of God God will not condemn you
[1:48:42] yeah the devil wants to give you
[1:48:43] judgment
[1:48:46] just like those Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:48:48] you remember
[1:48:50] when they caught that woman in adultery
[1:48:54] what did they do they caught that woman
[1:48:55] that was an adultery and they said let's
[1:48:58] go see what the Rabbi says about it
[1:49:00] let's go see what this this this man
[1:49:03] who's running around and opening blind
[1:49:05] eyes and healing the lepers he's doing
[1:49:08] these wonderful marvelous works but
[1:49:12] that's what he let's see what he does
[1:49:13] pertaining to the law
[1:49:18] so they threw down this adulterous woman
[1:49:21] before the feet of Jesus and what were
[1:49:24] they expecting
[1:49:25] they were expecting to find judgment
[1:49:29] but little did they know that they had
[1:49:31] just thrown that woman down at this I I
[1:49:34] believe in front of The Mercy Seat
[1:49:37] because God had come down
[1:49:40] the mercies he had come down and now was
[1:49:43] in tabernacling the fullness of the
[1:49:45] godhead bodily was now dwelling and the
[1:49:48] man Christ Jesus and they were looking
[1:49:51] for law but they threw her down in front
[1:49:53] of the mercy seat and Jesus stooped down
[1:49:56] and he started to ride in the sand
[1:50:00] had one by one
[1:50:03] from the oldest to the youngest the
[1:50:06] accusers went away
[1:50:11] what was God doing
[1:50:15] God was fulfilling prophecy
[1:50:19] Glory
[1:50:21] God was fulfilling prophecy
[1:50:25] God was making history
[1:50:28] the law condemned her
[1:50:31] and in the face of the law
[1:50:34] woman
[1:50:36] I'm speaking to somebody tonight
[1:50:39] Hallelujah sister
[1:50:42] where are thine accusers
[1:50:50] none Lord but you
[1:50:54] hear the words of the Lord
[1:50:58] neither do I condemn you
[1:51:01] go and sin no more
[1:51:04] God fulfilling prophecy
[1:51:07] god making history
[1:51:10] for the scripture would say in Hebrews 8
[1:51:12] 12.
[1:51:15] for I
[1:51:17] will be merciful to their
[1:51:19] unrighteousness
[1:51:26] for I will be merciful to their
[1:51:29] unrighteousness and their sins
[1:51:32] and their iniquities
[1:51:34] will I remember
[1:51:37] no more
[1:51:41] you never did it in the first place
[1:51:50] you were
[1:51:51] the intended target
[1:51:55] thank you Lord
[1:51:59] of this
[1:52:01] message
[1:52:03] oh how great it is
[1:52:06] God's sitting in a prophet
[1:52:09] God
[1:52:10] bringing to manifestation Luke 17 30.
[1:52:17] oh that the palm oil the kangaroo and
[1:52:20] the caterpillar the Locust
[1:52:22] I will restore
[1:52:24] it shall be light
[1:52:26] in the evening time
[1:52:28] you're Justified you never did it you
[1:52:32] you
[1:52:34] were the intended target
[1:52:41] God keeping his word
[1:52:44] the deadness moved away
[1:52:47] a living people with a cross
[1:52:50] and a spiritually dead people tried to
[1:52:52] impersonate and drown what was it God
[1:52:55] fulfilling prophecy and making history
[1:52:59] brother when you were sick
[1:53:02] and you were laying in that bed with an
[1:53:04] infection in your back and your whole
[1:53:07] life was being tore upside down and you
[1:53:09] needed a savior you needed a word you
[1:53:13] needed a Deliverance you needed
[1:53:15] something that can change your condition
[1:53:17] and change your circumstance and all of
[1:53:20] this written word and all of this
[1:53:22] prophetic word you are the intended
[1:53:25] target
[1:53:26] you are that predestinated seed laying
[1:53:31] there a deep crawling to a deep and when
[1:53:33] that word struck that predestinated seed
[1:53:36] something was quickened and Made Alive
[1:53:38] you were an eagle
[1:53:43] Isaiah 53 and 5 says
[1:53:50] but he was wounded
[1:53:52] for our transgression
[1:53:56] he was bruised
[1:53:58] for our iniquity
[1:54:03] oh
[1:54:05] Lord may your word never get old
[1:54:09] have we heard it so much
[1:54:12] we're not moved
[1:54:17] he was wounded
[1:54:20] for our transgressions
[1:54:22] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:54:26] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:54:28] him
[1:54:29] and with his stripes
[1:54:32] we are healed
[1:54:37] the word hit the mark
[1:54:40] the word hit the target
[1:54:43] behold I send you
[1:54:45] Elijah
[1:54:48] who's the you
[1:54:50] a Malachi 4 5.
[1:54:53] who's the you
[1:54:56] come on group participation here
[1:55:01] are we a cuddle a cudjoe club now
[1:55:05] that's our basic principles to get into
[1:55:07] this group that
[1:55:11] this word's exciting
[1:55:13] this word has life
[1:55:16] you can't tell me enough who I am
[1:55:19] you can't tell me enough God sent a
[1:55:21] prophet glory to God he sent a prophet
[1:55:26] he sent you a prophet
[1:55:30] he was bruised for your iniquities
[1:55:34] I'm telling you what when it comes time
[1:55:36] to the reading of the will
[1:55:41] you should be excited about it
[1:55:45] if you knew
[1:55:47] if it was all rigged
[1:55:50] and you knew you had the winning ticket
[1:55:52] to the lottery
[1:55:55] if somebody came and told you let's just
[1:55:58] say
[1:55:59] I don't know but let's just say the
[1:56:01] governor and all the powers that be at a
[1:56:04] secret meeting with you and say Amen
[1:56:06] this Joker's rigged
[1:56:09] you're going to win the lottery
[1:56:13] here's the winning ticket
[1:56:16] I kind of would be inclined
[1:56:21] to hear
[1:56:22] the reading
[1:56:24] of the winning ticket
[1:56:27] and as they started to read off those
[1:56:30] winning numbers
[1:56:32] and it was starting to match everything
[1:56:34] that had been said
[1:56:37] don't you realize that your name was
[1:56:39] attached to the Seven Seals
[1:56:43] don't you realize that that was your
[1:56:45] will
[1:56:47] don't you realize what Adam lost
[1:56:50] the title deed the book of redemption
[1:56:53] that went back into the hands of God it
[1:56:55] laid there
[1:56:57] until Christ
[1:57:00] atoned for our sin and he ascended up a
[1:57:03] kinsman redeemer and he took the book
[1:57:07] that's why John was weeping
[1:57:10] because nobody was worthy to take the
[1:57:12] book
[1:57:14] but then when the book was opened what
[1:57:16] did the prophet say that John was all
[1:57:18] excited about
[1:57:20] he said John must have saw his name in
[1:57:23] there
[1:57:24] John found out that his name was
[1:57:27] attached to the title deed book of
[1:57:31] redemption you were the intended target
[1:57:33] of Malachi 4 5. you are the intended
[1:57:36] target of Luke 17 30. you are the
[1:57:40] intended target of Revelations 10 1-7
[1:57:43] the mighty angel coming down with an
[1:57:47] open book and end read your name read
[1:57:49] your name read your name I wrote your
[1:57:53] name on the Lamb's Book of Life you are
[1:57:56] predestinated you are the intended
[1:57:59] target
[1:58:02] my word will not return unto me void
[1:58:08] oh Lord help us if we turn this corner
[1:58:13] when you look in the Old Testament
[1:58:15] we'll be working towards the close
[1:58:18] I haven't seen you in a while I love
[1:58:20] y'all
[1:58:24] when you look into the Old Testament at
[1:58:26] the forgiveness of sin and the law
[1:58:30] this is part two
[1:58:33] part two now so
[1:58:34] try to make it short and sweet I thought
[1:58:37] I wouldn't belong and on part two I
[1:58:38] won't be long so there we go I got them
[1:58:39] both in I was long on the first one I'll
[1:58:41] be short on the second one
[1:58:44] but when you look into the law into
[1:58:45] Leviticus I believe chapter 4.
[1:58:49] the law went forth and said now for
[1:58:52] there to be an atonement or forgiveness
[1:58:55] of sin
[1:58:57] there would have to be a sacrifice
[1:59:00] and the one that was ordained to perform
[1:59:03] the sacrifice were the priest
[1:59:06] and so the priest would have to execute
[1:59:09] the letter of the law
[1:59:11] they would have to be dressed right they
[1:59:13] would have to carry out the law to the
[1:59:15] letter and then if they met God's
[1:59:17] requirement
[1:59:19] then they had the promise of the letter
[1:59:22] of the law that their sins were forgiven
[1:59:26] they were accounted for it was a
[1:59:28] covering it's just a type and a shadow
[1:59:31] so when you look into the Old Testament
[1:59:33] and you see that that's why in Luke
[1:59:35] Chapter 5 when they lowered that man
[1:59:37] through the roof and there the scribes
[1:59:39] and Pharisees were looking what was the
[1:59:41] attraction there was this great mass of
[1:59:44] people they were wondering what all the
[1:59:46] commotion was and hear now this man
[1:59:48] that's uh a bedridden eye I believe he
[1:59:51] might have had palsy that they were
[1:59:52] lowering him down he was lame he
[1:59:54] couldn't walk they lower him in there
[1:59:56] and what does Jesus do
[1:59:59] Jesus looks at the man and says
[2:00:03] thy sins be forgiven you
[2:00:06] now those Sadducees and Pharisees they
[2:00:09] were not unjustly if you will
[2:00:13] criticizing what had taken place
[2:00:17] they were asking the right question
[2:00:20] the problem is they weren't seed
[2:00:24] but let's look into our Bible real quick
[2:00:25] into Luke chapter 5.
[2:00:29] verse 20-24
[2:00:36] foreign
[2:00:48] I better get there
[2:00:51] hey that's great it follows right after
[2:00:53] our text
[2:00:55] Luke chapter 5.
[2:01:01] verse 20.
[2:01:03] he says and when he saw their faith
[2:01:07] he said unto him man by sins I have
[2:01:10] forgiven thee
[2:01:12] now what were the scribes and the
[2:01:14] Pharisees witnessing
[2:01:17] what was the attraction
[2:01:20] it says and the scribes and the
[2:01:22] Pharisees begin to reason saying who is
[2:01:26] this which speaketh blasphemies
[2:01:29] that part was wrong
[2:01:32] the next part
[2:01:34] who can forgive sins but God Alone
[2:01:40] hello
[2:01:43] they needed to just
[2:01:45] do the math
[2:01:50] this man
[2:01:51] is claiming to be God
[2:01:59] but what did Jesus do he looked at them
[2:02:03] they reasoned within their heart
[2:02:07] second clue
[2:02:10] they should have known right there
[2:02:14] he just discerned the thoughts and
[2:02:16] intents of my heart
[2:02:17] let's just read the story
[2:02:21] he says
[2:02:24] who can forgive sins but God alone but
[2:02:27] when Jesus perceived their thoughts
[2:02:32] so these were students of the word
[2:02:35] they knew there was only one person that
[2:02:39] could forgive sin
[2:02:41] and that was God Alone
[2:02:44] so the very word himself turns to him
[2:02:47] and says
[2:02:51] Discerning their thoughts he says but
[2:02:53] Jesus perceived their thoughts
[2:02:55] he answered and said to them what reason
[2:02:59] ye in your hearts
[2:03:05] whether it is easier to say
[2:03:09] thy sins be forgiven thee
[2:03:12] or to say rise up
[2:03:16] and walk
[2:03:18] but that ye may know
[2:03:20] Glory
[2:03:22] that's the same word that came in the
[2:03:25] end time
[2:03:27] Hallelujah
[2:03:28] the same word came in this generation
[2:03:33] declaring Jesus Christ the same
[2:03:35] yesterday today and forever search the
[2:03:38] scriptures and then ye think you have
[2:03:40] eternal life but they are that which
[2:03:43] testify of me prophecy being fulfilled
[2:03:47] god making history
[2:03:52] but that ye may know that the son of man
[2:03:57] Oh Glory to God
[2:04:01] but that ye may know that the subtle man
[2:04:04] hath power upon the Earth
[2:04:08] to forgive sins
[2:04:11] he said unto the sick
[2:04:13] of the palsy
[2:04:16] if I could say it like this
[2:04:19] if you don't believe my words
[2:04:24] believe my works
[2:04:26] for they testify
[2:04:29] of who I am
[2:04:31] if it's if it's hard for you to
[2:04:34] understand the Discerning of the
[2:04:36] thoughts and intents of the art if it's
[2:04:38] hard for you to understand a man living
[2:04:41] between two different worlds if it's
[2:04:43] hard for you to understand the third
[2:04:45] heaven if it's hard for you to
[2:04:47] understand all of those things that
[2:04:50] which were spoken if it's hard for you
[2:04:52] to believe those things look at the
[2:04:55] works
[2:04:56] they testify of who I am but that ye may
[2:05:00] know that the son of man hath power upon
[2:05:03] the Earth to forgive sin he said unto
[2:05:05] the sick of palsy I say unto thee rise
[2:05:09] take up thy couch and go into the house
[2:05:15] Hallelujah
[2:05:17] what was it
[2:05:19] God fulfilling prophecy
[2:05:22] it was God
[2:05:24] making history
[2:05:26] but you see they failed to recognize
[2:05:29] what the attraction was
[2:05:32] they failed to recognize what it was all
[2:05:35] about
[2:05:37] so much so that there would be a blind
[2:05:40] man that would be healed
[2:05:43] and they would call the blind man
[2:05:46] and start to accuse him start to
[2:05:49] acquestion him
[2:05:52] just like the other other Pharisees and
[2:05:55] Pharisees they did not want to accept
[2:05:59] the way the Messiah came
[2:06:03] they didn't want to believe it
[2:06:06] because it didn't come to their
[2:06:08] denomination
[2:06:10] it didn't vindicate them
[2:06:12] but it came according to the time and
[2:06:16] the purpose that God intended
[2:06:18] and it when it came in the manifestation
[2:06:20] of a little hillbilly with a seventh
[2:06:23] grade education they didn't want to
[2:06:25] believe it
[2:06:28] Glory
[2:06:30] but the bride can't help but believe it
[2:06:34] because it's your identification
[2:06:40] and the blind man would have to tell him
[2:06:42] whoa
[2:06:45] he would have to literally rebuke
[2:06:48] the the most holy
[2:06:50] Pharisees and Sadducees look these guys
[2:06:52] weren't just some put on joke
[2:06:55] even though they kind of were because
[2:06:57] there was nothing behind the veil
[2:06:59] you know it's like the fallacy of
[2:07:01] worship you know it's kind of funny
[2:07:02] they're all taking the blood and
[2:07:03] everything and they're going back behind
[2:07:04] the veil and there's nothing back there
[2:07:06] because the ark had been carried away
[2:07:07] into Babylon you ever think about that
[2:07:08] there was no holiest of holies why where
[2:07:11] was the Holy place
[2:07:13] it was standing before them
[2:07:16] Glory
[2:07:17] the holiest of all these was now in
[2:07:19] Tabernacle a body thou has prepared for
[2:07:22] me
[2:07:23] and so the Blind Man's rebuking him
[2:07:26] saying what are you talking why are you
[2:07:28] asking me
[2:07:29] who opened my never in the whole history
[2:07:31] of the world
[2:07:33] has it ever been recorded
[2:07:36] that a man born blind
[2:07:39] his eyes have been opened
[2:07:42] and y'all are supposed to be the most
[2:07:44] educated most spiritual people of the
[2:07:48] age
[2:07:49] and you're asking me who opened my eyes
[2:07:52] maybe you too want to be their disciple
[2:07:56] and they reviled him
[2:07:59] because he said look
[2:08:01] I'm not I don't know
[2:08:04] I don't know exactly where he come from
[2:08:07] Glory
[2:08:10] I don't really know about his birth
[2:08:13] I don't really know what happened there
[2:08:16] uh uh I believe April 9th in 1909
[2:08:20] and maybe don't really realize what
[2:08:21] happened in 1933 out there on the Ohio
[2:08:24] River
[2:08:25] I don't really know what exactly
[2:08:27] happened there December 22nd in 1962
[2:08:31] when there was a vision and he was
[2:08:32] caught up in a constantly I really don't
[2:08:34] know much about the cloud that had
[2:08:36] appeared there in February 28th and now
[2:08:39] all of these people they're all in an
[2:08:40] uproar and I don't really know about all
[2:08:43] these people talking about people who
[2:08:44] died on a bridge and they can't go in
[2:08:46] the archives in the database and explain
[2:08:49] all these I really can't tell you about
[2:08:51] all these things but one thing I can
[2:08:53] tell you
[2:08:54] I once was blind
[2:08:57] but now I see
[2:09:00] what is it God fulfilling his word god
[2:09:04] making history in the bride
[2:09:07] Hallelujah
[2:09:09] well I ain't done yet
[2:09:11] see they failed to to recognize what the
[2:09:14] attraction was
[2:09:16] never before had these things taken
[2:09:18] place
[2:09:20] as it says in John 9 32 we'll get
[2:09:23] towards a close
[2:09:24] John 9 32
[2:09:28] some of us wouldn't like it overseas
[2:09:29] I'll tell you that much
[2:09:34] we kind of have a rule down there you
[2:09:36] want to preach longer than it took them
[2:09:37] to get there
[2:09:39] because they walk to church
[2:09:43] you imagine somebody walking three hours
[2:09:45] to church and then you give them some
[2:09:46] little 30 45 minute service
[2:09:49] cool
[2:09:50] I'll never forget brother
[2:09:53] well
[2:09:54] we might be here a while
[2:09:56] but this brother he got up there
[2:09:58] preached a wonderful message preached
[2:09:59] ours
[2:10:02] brother preached a beautiful sermon
[2:10:05] and he turned it over to brother Duke
[2:10:06] and he came up
[2:10:08] brother Joker started preaching
[2:10:11] start laying in that word
[2:10:12] he kept preaching longer and longer
[2:10:16] brother Diego just took his Liberty
[2:10:18] being his church
[2:10:20] and afterwards after preaching hours
[2:10:23] he said brother I'm so sorry
[2:10:26] but I couldn't help notice those 12
[2:10:28] young boys that come in the back
[2:10:31] they walked four days to be in the
[2:10:32] meeting
[2:10:34] and they made it in time at the very end
[2:10:36] of the last service when you were
[2:10:37] preaching
[2:10:39] and I couldn't take it I had to say
[2:10:42] something
[2:10:44] you know what I say to that
[2:10:46] them boys was right on time
[2:10:48] they were walking in the duty of the the
[2:10:50] word
[2:10:52] they got to the house of God and I
[2:10:54] believe God met their need
[2:10:56] I blew out a tire one time going to
[2:10:58] church and and I've told this story
[2:11:00] before I put another my spare on my
[2:11:02] spare blew out I got the mechanic
[2:11:04] finally got that change I got down to
[2:11:06] church and I got there and there's about
[2:11:08] 10 minutes left to preaching but you
[2:11:10] know what I had in my heart I had a
[2:11:11] faith seed that said that 10 minutes is
[2:11:12] for me
[2:11:15] that kind of attitude towards the word
[2:11:16] of God and it says in John 9 32 it says
[2:11:19] since the world began was it not heard
[2:11:21] that any man opened the eyes of one that
[2:11:23] was blind if this man were not God
[2:11:27] he could do nothing
[2:11:30] all right
[2:11:32] I want to say
[2:11:37] if it wasn't God fulfilling prophecy
[2:11:42] then William Branham could have done
[2:11:44] nothing
[2:11:47] don't you realize God was preserving
[2:11:50] the voice of the age for you
[2:11:54] this isn't so much about the prophet
[2:11:57] as much as we love our brother and and
[2:12:00] and it's for our benefit and it was the
[2:12:02] vessel God chose to orchestrate through
[2:12:06] but he was a man subject to like
[2:12:08] passions like you and I
[2:12:11] he would have been a murderer
[2:12:13] he would have been a drinker he would
[2:12:15] have been a smoker
[2:12:17] but there was something over his life
[2:12:19] that was keeping him
[2:12:20] when I put my Pillar of Fire came down
[2:12:23] in that poplar tree when he was seven
[2:12:25] years old and said don't drink or smoke
[2:12:27] for I have a specific work for you to do
[2:12:29] when you get older
[2:12:31] he was born under that sign and bored
[2:12:34] for that purpose because God's word what
[2:12:36] it will accomplish
[2:12:39] what he said now put yourself there
[2:12:42] church
[2:12:43] it will accomplish what he said it would
[2:12:45] accomplish when his legs got blown off I
[2:12:48] believe at the age of 14 by a shotgun he
[2:12:50] went to hell he would have died
[2:12:53] he did die
[2:12:55] well he went down to Hell
[2:12:58] I think that's the only way you get
[2:12:59] there
[2:13:02] am I right
[2:13:04] so much so that he would stand later in
[2:13:06] his ministry and say this might sound
[2:13:08] irresponsible but I've been to both
[2:13:10] players we've got such a glorious
[2:13:12] message
[2:13:14] ain't no more mysteries in that book
[2:13:18] we've received a Vindicated Prophet
[2:13:20] that's been to Hell he's been beyond the
[2:13:22] curtain of time he's been beyond Genesis
[2:13:24] he's been past Revelations all for what
[2:13:27] for you
[2:13:28] for you
[2:13:30] for you because you are the intended
[2:13:33] target
[2:13:35] he would have killed them boys
[2:13:38] shooting that gun
[2:13:39] so much so when he lost his wife hoping
[2:13:42] and Sharon
[2:13:44] he tried to commit suicide
[2:13:47] not once
[2:13:48] twice
[2:13:51] so far if it was up to brother Branham
[2:13:55] he'd have been a drunkard it'd have been
[2:13:57] a drink what because what happened I
[2:13:58] forgot that part right remember he was
[2:14:00] with his girls had had eyes like a dove
[2:14:02] and oh there was my little sweet art she
[2:14:03] was smoking a cigarette and they wanted
[2:14:05] to give him a cigarette and he well I
[2:14:06] want to smoke a two and he went to put
[2:14:07] it to his house and all said
[2:14:11] there was that what
[2:14:13] it was the word
[2:14:16] producing in his life what God said it
[2:14:21] would
[2:14:21] it wasn't what brother Branham could do
[2:14:24] Glory it was what God said he would do
[2:14:29] God said you will be a prophet your name
[2:14:32] will be William pranam you will reveal
[2:14:35] the Seven Seals
[2:14:37] all of that was predetermined
[2:14:40] he was the intended target just like
[2:14:42] Mary
[2:14:44] he's down there on the river with his
[2:14:45] daddy
[2:14:47] could go he was down there on the river
[2:14:49] with his daddy
[2:14:51] how many brothers did he have 12 13 14
[2:14:53] Brothers
[2:14:54] and all of them drinking there and he's
[2:14:56] down there with his his daddy and his
[2:14:59] friend and they're gonna drink and now
[2:15:01] they're talking oh his daddy you know
[2:15:03] brother Brandon respect has looked up to
[2:15:05] his daddy
[2:15:06] and he goes what does your son drink he
[2:15:09] says no I guess I raised one
[2:15:14] my daddy calling me a
[2:15:17] give me that bottle
[2:15:20] and with everything in him he wanted to
[2:15:22] prove to his daddy he wasn't a but
[2:15:27] you see that Prophet had another Daddy
[2:15:30] he had another father he was birthed by
[2:15:33] the word he was predestinated and how
[2:15:37] much how hard brother Branham tried to
[2:15:39] sabotage what had been spoken there was
[2:15:42] nothing he could do to stop the word of
[2:15:44] God because God's word will not return
[2:15:47] void and the pride of Jesus Christ God
[2:15:51] has spoken I will have a bride she will
[2:15:54] be without spot without wrinkle she will
[2:15:58] be there what is it God fulfilling
[2:16:01] prophecy god making history in you
[2:16:06] well we'll call for the musicians as we
[2:16:08] keep going
[2:16:10] God keeping his word
[2:16:13] Hallelujah
[2:16:14] I want to say this
[2:16:18] Jesus was
[2:16:23] give me give me a few minutes
[2:16:27] Jesus was passing through the street
[2:16:31] now people everywhere were bumping into
[2:16:33] him
[2:16:36] but there was something in a woman's
[2:16:38] heart
[2:16:41] that said if I can just Touch the Hem of
[2:16:43] His Garment
[2:16:46] I will be made whole
[2:16:51] and all of a sudden Jesus stops
[2:16:55] he says who touched me
[2:16:59] I perceive virtue
[2:17:03] has gone out for me
[2:17:05] what is virtue
[2:17:08] power
[2:17:10] I perceive power
[2:17:13] has gone out for me
[2:17:15] if I can just Touch the Hem of His
[2:17:17] garments
[2:17:19] I want to tell you
[2:17:21] virtue flows from this message
[2:17:26] if you walk in the light
[2:17:29] as he is in the light
[2:17:32] we have Fellowship one with another and
[2:17:35] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[2:17:37] from all sin if you walk in the light of
[2:17:40] the hour oh there's virtue there is
[2:17:43] power that is Flowing from the message
[2:17:46] God keeping his word the deadness moves
[2:17:49] what God keep in his word what God said
[2:17:52] he would send the prophet God said he
[2:17:54] would loosen the sentences what is it
[2:17:55] it's God keeping his word and when God
[2:17:57] keeps his word the deadness moves away
[2:18:00] that first man has to die you have to
[2:18:03] put on that new man and a living people
[2:18:06] cross over what that same spirit that
[2:18:09] was in Jesus Christ if that same Spirit
[2:18:11] dwell in you it will also Quicken it'll
[2:18:15] also make you alive it will put on the
[2:18:18] new man
[2:18:23] Zechariah 9 and 9. would say rejoice
[2:18:26] greatly
[2:18:29] o Daughter of Zion
[2:18:32] shout o daughter of Jerusalem
[2:18:35] Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is
[2:18:38] just
[2:18:41] and having salvation lowly and riding
[2:18:43] upon an ass and upon a cult the full of
[2:18:46] an ass
[2:18:48] what's the attraction on the mountain
[2:18:52] what's taking place what is it all about
[2:18:54] church I know we've gone longer than
[2:18:56] usual
[2:18:58] but what is it all about
[2:19:01] what is the attraction on the mountain
[2:19:05] Romans 8 3 would say this
[2:19:08] for what the law could not do
[2:19:12] and that it was weak through the flesh
[2:19:22] and play something softly sister
[2:19:26] God sending his own son
[2:19:29] in the likeness of sinful flesh
[2:19:32] and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[2:19:37] that day in Calvary when Abel by faith
[2:19:40] offered unto God a more excellent
[2:19:41] sacrifice contain
[2:19:44] he must have tied a grapevine around the
[2:19:46] Lamb's neck
[2:19:48] drug him up to the Rock
[2:19:51] took a rock in his hand for a lance
[2:19:55] and he pulled his little head back
[2:19:57] and chopped
[2:19:59] and hacked him until he died
[2:20:02] and his wool bathed with his own blood
[2:20:06] he wallowed
[2:20:08] in his blood
[2:20:10] it was a shadow
[2:20:13] but that day on Calvary
[2:20:16] there wasn't a lamb of this Earth
[2:20:19] but it was the Lamb of God
[2:20:22] that was dying
[2:20:24] wallowing in his own blood
[2:20:27] he was hacked and chopped and beat
[2:20:30] spit on
[2:20:31] and slammed and smacked
[2:20:35] and everything
[2:20:36] by the world
[2:20:40] the blood dropping off his legs
[2:20:43] when Abel's lamb died it died speaking
[2:20:45] in a language that Abel could not
[2:20:47] understand
[2:20:50] it was bleeding
[2:20:54] and when God's lamb died on Calvary that
[2:20:56] day
[2:20:59] he spoke in a language that no one
[2:21:01] understood
[2:21:03] my God
[2:21:04] my God
[2:21:08] why is thou forsaken me
[2:21:10] foreign
[2:21:12] it was God's land hacked to pieces
[2:21:15] chopped up
[2:21:16] [Music]
[2:21:18] he was the very lamb that Abel had in
[2:21:20] mind when he seen the promise seed of
[2:21:22] the woman
[2:21:24] he was the land that Daniel saw
[2:21:28] that was here out of the mountain
[2:21:30] without hands
[2:21:32] he was the wheel in the middle of the
[2:21:34] wheel for the prophet
[2:21:36] all they had foresaw was
[2:21:38] met on that day
[2:21:41] that day on Calvary
[2:21:44] that brought the great thing in
[2:21:48] that broke the back of Satan
[2:21:51] what was it
[2:21:54] God fulfilling prophecy
[2:21:57] and making history
[2:21:59] man has all of their achievements
[2:22:03] they can lay claim to this and they can
[2:22:05] lay claim to that
[2:22:05] [Music]
[2:22:07] but the greatest man
[2:22:10] [Music]
[2:22:11] that ever walk this side
[2:22:14] was the man Christ Jesus
[2:22:18] they have all their achievements they
[2:22:20] climbed this hill and they climbed this
[2:22:21] Everest but there was a man
[2:22:25] that climbed Mount Calvary
[2:22:30] and he bore all of your sin
[2:22:32] and all of your shame so you wouldn't
[2:22:35] have to live under condemnation
[2:22:38] so that you could be forgiven
[2:22:40] that's the greatest day in history
[2:22:44] that every time you name a date
[2:22:46] every time somebody's born every time
[2:22:49] you pinned under the date it testifies
[2:22:51] at that day on Calvary
[2:22:55] God fulfilling prophecy
[2:22:58] and making history
[2:23:00] so much more
[2:23:02] Zechariah 14-7 will end on this
[2:23:08] but it shall be one day which it shall
[2:23:10] be known unto the Lord
[2:23:11] not day or night
[2:23:14] but it shall come to pass that at the
[2:23:16] evening time
[2:23:18] it shall be light
[2:23:22] what was that prophecy the constellation
[2:23:24] of angels
[2:23:26] what was that voice that spoke down
[2:23:28] there as John the Baptist 4 in the first
[2:23:30] coming of Christ so shall your ministry
[2:23:33] for on the second coming of Christ
[2:23:36] why would the prophet stand there after
[2:23:38] preaching Christ The Mystery of God
[2:23:39] revealed
[2:23:40] and say now if you look at the clock
[2:23:43] it's two o'clock on the dot you who are
[2:23:45] spiritual if you look at the clock it's
[2:23:47] two o'clock on the dock why why is he
[2:23:50] saying that because now the prophet is
[2:23:52] realizing
[2:23:53] when the pillar of fire dropped down on
[2:23:55] the Ohio River in 1933 at two o'clock
[2:24:00] and said as John the Baptist four ran
[2:24:03] the second coming to Christ so shall
[2:24:05] your ministry forerun the second coming
[2:24:06] of Christ now he's standing there and
[2:24:09] saying this day
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:12] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[2:24:16] God said he would do it
[2:24:19] God prophesied your ministry would force
[2:24:22] her on the second coming
[2:24:24] and now I'm declaring
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:28] God fulfilling prophecy and making
[2:24:30] history that which is promised
[2:24:34] has been fulfilled
[2:24:36] what is the attraction on the mountain

[2:24:53] following a star saying where is he
[2:24:56] that's born King of the Jews what was it
[2:24:59] God fulfilling his word
[2:25:02] and there shall rise a star out of Jacob
[2:25:05] and the god of Heaven promised the
[2:25:08] evening time would have evening lights
[2:25:11] three years ago
[2:25:13] this mystery was prophecy
[2:25:19] he's referring to the vision he had on
[2:25:21] December 22nd 1962 and then after that
[2:25:24] Vision uh eight days later or seven days
[2:25:26] later he would preach sirs what time is
