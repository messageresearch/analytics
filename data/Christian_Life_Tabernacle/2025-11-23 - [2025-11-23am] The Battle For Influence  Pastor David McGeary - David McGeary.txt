Our gracious, the heavenly father Lord, we need your spirit to make the word of God a reality to us, Father. Father, we can read the letters and our mind, Father, will formulate an interpretation or an opinion. And we can live a good life by that. But father, we need your spirit to quicken the word, &gt;&gt; make it alive and make it real &gt;&gt; and reveal it to us just what you had in mind when you spoke it. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, that's our heart's desire. Father, we know that there will be a time that this world will cease as we know it. And we'll leave this civilization and this world, this age of technology and all the politics and science and things that the world seems to run on, Lord, and we'll be translated into another dimension, another world where things are run by your great leadership, &gt;&gt; Father. Father, we don't want to miss that. We ask that you would help us, Father, this morning to hear your word and that it would be ever so impressed upon our heart. We just ask that you would grant that to us, Father. Forgive us of our sins and our short and our trespasses to get you, Father. and encourage our hearts and help us overcome for we ask these things in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning. Uh uh we we wanted to play uh a portion of of a message for you this morning. And uh you know, every time that I'm going to play a a tape, I meet more mental uh resistance than anything that I ever do. It's easy to walk out, but when you want to say, "I'm going to play a tape," boy, voices just start coming out of the woodwork. You know what I mean? But um I I think this is a uh a very tremendous tape. Thank you musicians for uh helping us this morning. I'd like to if I'd like to read this statement uh and it's in paragraph 91 out of the greatest battle ever fought. And uh I'd like to read this and then we'll move into our our service this morning. It says [clears throat] in paragraph 91 uh greatest battle ever fought. It must be accepted in the mind. Then it's believed with the heart. &gt;&gt; Then the word of God becomes a reality. Then every sense of soul and body is just scorched out with the Holy Spirit. Then your sense of God, your consciousness of God, everything that's godly flows through you. &gt;&gt; There there's not a doubt anywhere. there's nothing can rise up &gt;&gt; so I want you to understand it's got to be accepted in the mind &gt;&gt; believed in the heart &gt;&gt; and then it becomes a reality &gt;&gt; and every sense of your soul the spirit flows through you and and you have a consciousness of God &gt;&gt; now that's what we're after &gt;&gt; we're after the consciousness of God the reality of his present. And and so we that's from the greatest battle ever fought and we know the battle's in the mind. So if I would have had a a a title this morning or for our Sunday school lesson, uh it it's the battle for influence. &gt;&gt; The battle for influence. And you know sometime you know not every service has got to be a revival. You know what I mean? Sometimes we just need good Bible teaching, good understanding, uh something that to make us aware of what we're involved in. Now, you know that this is the age of influencers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh I always read in the news or I hear people and they say such and such uh a influencer, &gt;&gt; right? and they they packed the title influencer. Well, there's all kinds of influencers. A social media influencer uh such and such uh was arrested and he was a a influencer and that means he's in influencing. All right? And what the word influence means is the power or ability to affect &gt;&gt; somebody's belief, decisions, or actions. &gt;&gt; So if they're an influencer, &gt;&gt; they're affecting &gt;&gt; somebody's decisions, &gt;&gt; their beliefs, &gt;&gt; and their actions. So that's where we are. &gt;&gt; And we know who the first influencer was. Does anybody know who the first influencer was? &gt;&gt; It was the devil &gt;&gt; in the Garden of &gt;&gt; Eden. He went up to Eve and he said, "Surely you won't die." And he began to influence her and that was the first influencer and he caused her to make a decision and that decision cost the whole world into death. Satan never changes his tactic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He always works the same way. We know where the battleground is. It's in your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. So, and we we were going to speak on faith in the uh faith in the accusation, but Matthew covered that pretty well. And so, we wanted to go on farther in that and and then and and maybe go and recognize the enemy and every single one of his tricks. you know what he's trying to do, what it is you're up against, what's going on around you every day, what is transpiring and affecting you and driving you. And if you don't recognize it, then it has the power to affect your decisions, &gt;&gt; your beliefs, &gt;&gt; and your actions. and and so I I just don't think this is really a wonderful uh message and I I think that you'll really uh be blessed by it. And so we wanted to go we wanted to listen to it and then we wanted to uh take our time and uh go through it. So we're going to start by reading in the book of uh Isaiah the 6th chapter. starting with the first verse and it starts and in the year of King Uriah. We'll listen to this and then we'll take this is going to be 40 minutes and then we'll we'll go back through it and just pick out some highlighted spots and talk about it this morning. So today's Sunday school. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's now I know that we have language barrier and and uh and I know it's difficult uh maybe sometimes when we play a tape but brother Brandham's very measured in this and and uh I think it should be an easy for our interpreters to interpret. If you have your phone and you can pull it up in your language, it's it's January 12th, 1963. 112, 1963. The message is influence. And we'll just listen to 40 minutes this morning and then have a little Bible study out of it. and hope today that uh we can leave here fortified in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Not just blessed by the presence of the Lord, but to have some real solid &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bible uh nuggets to to stand on and put in our arsenal to to fight the devil. That's what we want to do, right? We want our faith to soar. Is that right? Every every the our consciousness of God. Well, in order for that to happen, it's first got to be accepted in the mind, &gt;&gt; and then it's got to be believe with the heart. &gt;&gt; Then it becomes the consciousness of God. In other words, then you know that God's with you. And I think so many people believe in God, but they just don't know if he's with them. &gt;&gt; And he promised, "I'll be with you, even in you till the end. &gt;&gt; Wheresoever I'll go, I'll I'll go with you." And that we can know he's with me. &gt;&gt; He's watching over me. He's here to help me in this situation. So, we we want to hold on uh this morning and listen close if you would. Uh and this is a got us a lot of real uh lessons in in here for us. So, if you have your Bibles, uh the message is influence. I believe it was preached the full gospel of businessmen in Phoenix. We're only listening to about half of it uh this morning, but it's going to be wonderful for you. So, after we read the scripture, feel free to take your seat and and this is study today. This isn't about feeling good. This is about accepting something in your mind. All right? So, we want to attack your mind this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are we going to attack your mind with? The voice of the messenger. &gt;&gt; That's a good mind attack. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. I hope you're blessed. &gt;&gt; Now, I would like this morning, God willing, to open the scripture, if you wish to, now to the book of Isaiah. And this being a businessman's meeting, yet their main business is getting souls right with God. &gt;&gt; That's what they're dedicated to. And we are wanting to speak on the gospel and the sincerity and the approach to it. And let's begin reading now from Isaiah 6. The first chap the first verse of Isaiah 6 reading down including the eth. And in the year that king died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high lifted up and his train filled the temple. And above it stood the saraphim. Each had six wings. With twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with tween he did fly. And one cried to another said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory." And the post of the doors moved at the voice of him that cried. and the house was filled with smoke. Then said I, "Woe is me, for I am undone, because I'm a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts. Then flew one of the ser unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. And he laid it upon my mouth and said, "Lo, this has touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is purged." Also I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Who shall I send and who shall go for us?" Then said I, "Here am I, send me." I wish to draw from this little text some context on some notes that I have written down here. And if I should give it a title, I would like to call it influence. You know, there's so many of us and most all of us uh influence somebody by the things that we do and the way we live and the things we say. We influence somebody. Somebody is watching your life. And then when we profess to be Christians, what type of life should we live? If somebody is watching us and your life that you live will reflect an influence on somebody that might it might be the their eternal destination will rest upon the way that you live and the things that you do. for they watch him. And in our text this morning as influence, we find that this king was a a great influence to Isaiah, the the young prophet. Isaiah had been called to his side and being a noted vindicated prophet of his day. And he had a I believe the way that Isaiah spoke it, he was uh uh had a great influence upon Isaiah. Now we find that Uzekiah was called to be king at the age of about 16 years old after his father's death. And his father was a a great believer and he had his mother also was a very fine woman. And this young king had been um crowned at a young age and quickly he taken the road that was right because of the influence of a godly father and a godly mother. And I think that's a very fine example for we parent today is to set an example before our children. Now you'll live your your best and your worst at home. And I think that our lives though that children might not just exactly act like they're noticing it, but they are noticing it. Don't you never think that they are not because they're watching. Not only the children are watching, but the neighbors are watching. Not only the neighbors are watching, but the uh all that you are associated with watches. The people at your church watch you. The people that you do business with in the markets, they're watching you after your confession. And we should always try to reflect Christ in everything that we do. I know a little motto that I had hanging in my house many years ago. I picked it up one day when at Billy Sunday's tabernacle when I was at one of the meetings up at um in W on a lake and I liked it so much till I I got it and hung it up in my house and I kept it until it just fell apart. It was something like this. go no place you would not be want to be found if Jesus should come and uh be saying nothing that you would not want to be saying if Jesus should come and it went on with many things saying what you and otherwise whatever you do or say or whatever action that you're performing do not do it If you would not want to be caught in that position when Jesus comes, if we could only do that, I'm sure we'd be a great influence upon our associates. And you know the right there's two ways to do anything. That's right and wrong. I had my little son Joseph on my lap the other day and I said to him, he's eight years old and some little boy had uh stepped on his toes and he and the little boy had a fight. So I said, "Joseph, don't don't do that." He said, "But daddy, he did such and such." I said, "But that doesn't matter." See what he did. Just remember, Joseph, that you love your father. He said, "Yes, daddy. I said, "Then remember that people are going to look at your life as a minister, son. And then if you do anything wrong, then they're going to say, "Does this minister permit his child to do such?" Now, we know they do it anyhow. But, uh, we know that as Christians, we know that we try to bring up our children, right? But uh it's a good thing to keep that be front before all the time that do what's right. Don't don't ever take that other side. So um I said because you see that doesn't only reflect on you Joseph, but it reflects on your mother, reflects on your sisters, it reflects on your father and the very cause of the family, what we're standing for. And then what we stand for, it reflects on that on Jesus Christ. You don't want to do that. I said our our Lord told us if we're if somebody smites us on one cheek, just turn the other. And of course, that's kind of hard for a little boy with a high temper to begin with to to think of such things, but place it before him anyhow. See that he should not do it. Now this young fellow Yesiah had such a training in his early days to when he taken the throne. He never turned right or left from the thing that was right. He stayed right with it. He never let politics influence him in any way. He was a man who was determined to serve God regardless. And so politics didn't he ignored all of those things. And another thing that I liked about was that he ignored popularity or popular opinions. No matter what anybody else thought or what the popular trend of the day was, he wanted to serve God regardless. Oh, we need man like that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In our uh political world, &gt;&gt; we need man like that in the White House. &gt;&gt; We need man like that in business. &gt;&gt; We need man like that in the pull pit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man that will not turn to popular opinions or popularity, but will stay straight with the word, &gt;&gt; not turn right or left. God in commission Joshua said, "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, and then thou shalt make thy ways prosperous. Then thou shalt have good success." And not only that, but you're influencing somebody the same way you're traveling. And so I appreciate uh the stand that Hezekiah took to be determined. The first thing he be to do was to repair the house of the Lord and to build up the places that had been torn down and then go out to the enemy after he proved to God that he was sincere and he he was going to take the right stand regardless of what his uh people around him, his uh advisors to influence him to a political side of the of the kingdom. He would not stand for it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He wanted God's will in that alone. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of man we need, the kind of mothers we need. A woman, a mother of this day that will take the right stand. &gt;&gt; And do what's right regardless of what the other women does. Do what's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's such a pity to see our nation in such a scrimml as it is today. I got up a little late this morning to get to the breakfast and I went to a place and to get some coffee and this a little lady come out to serve me and she had wife and I were sitting there and she had her eyes blue, you know, that stuffed up her eyes and um I seen one of those in Los Angeles one time, the first one I ever seen the ladies made up in that way. I I I thought that I I was going to walk up and tell her I was a missionary and I'd seen flaggery and leprosy and but I'd never seen anything like that. And I was going to ask her if I could not pray for her and and I and tell me what kind of a disease she had and I was a little afraid of it and I never seen anything quite like it. And I when I walked over, I was waiting for brother Arganbright and uh one of the businessmen and the officials and another girl walked up looked just like her. I would say I I might be wrong here that she might have did that herself and it was a very attractive girl would have been if she just washed her face and looked like a human but she was so now when some of these movie stars are somewhere I don't know where it comes from when they will do a thing like that some woman with some kind of an influence then that influence arrest the nation and try to do the same. &gt;&gt; That's right. When our Pentecostal women was allowed to cut their hair because some minister lay down in the pullpit, then the rest of them said, "Well, so and so's wife does it, can't we?" See, it's the influence that she place up on some of them. This little lady this morning was such a nice little lady. She was very sweet and just as respectable as she could be. And when we she left the table and turned around, my wife looked across the table at me and I said, "You know, it's just a pity that some devil," and I'm not reluctant to say devil, that has coped up such a thing to bring our American women under such influence as that he trace. influence. Somebody started it. Well, don't you never go by what some s somebody of this country, I don't care other country or or some minister's wife or somebody else, don't you never be influenced for them. You let the Bible influence you &gt;&gt; to the thing that's right. And that's wrong &gt;&gt; now. And then we we shout and dance and speak in tongues and and uh the glory of God we claim is on us and then go out to such as that. &gt;&gt; There's something wrong. I believe in these things, these uh shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit. &gt;&gt; But brother, how could God tolerate such a thing as that when he's against it? &gt;&gt; And he says so in his word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And our women has become in our churches uh which is merely practiced many times dressing sex appeal. &gt;&gt; It's very seldom ever spoke against from the pulpit and yet we shout and jump around and speak in tongues. &gt;&gt; That's the reason that this great move called Pentecostal is not getting any worse because there's no sincerity behind it. It becomes an emotion. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And because I say them things, many say he's a woman hater. He He's different from It's not trying to be different. He's trying to be sincere. &gt;&gt; I believe that we're in the last days &gt;&gt; and we got a a great message, &gt;&gt; but all of our shouting and speaking in tongues will be of no effect. You can see it among us. You can see that we're growing in numbers. But are we growing in power? &gt;&gt; We're still on the same grounds that we were when we started 40 years ago where we should already be over in the promised land. &gt;&gt; Influence. One minister's wife down and did this and one minister started so and so and the rest just started. Oh, may we like uh the uh Ezekiah here that let's not let nothing influence us but the word of God. &gt;&gt; Let that be our influence. &gt;&gt; Uh bring ourselves back to the faith, back to the correction of the scripture no matter what the rest of the world has to do. And we brethren, many of the brethren who belong to organization which practically it's all got little groups. I have nothing against that. That's all right. But when we going to get the place that we feel that ours is the only group that we got it the fella hasn't got nothing to do with it that is being influenced by the higherups in the organization that we should make our organization to grow. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are to make the kingdom grow. &gt;&gt; We are here to influence &gt;&gt; and we will never be an influence to the outside world as long as we're trying to influence them to some organization because they've been that before we were born. &gt;&gt; Let's take the stand for God and his word and fellowship and get all. Brethren, &gt;&gt; let us not draw a line and say if you don't tow to this, let's reach a hand across the line. &gt;&gt; Be brethren, &gt;&gt; that's the reason I have been so sold on this year, Christian businessmans, full gospel fellowship, that's the reason that Methodists and Presbyterians and so forth where the ministers could not seem to reach across there. But the businessmen broke down those traditions. They're helping doing that thing. Now, if we can just keep it beat out of their heads to organize, which it looks like they're headed that way. And when they do, that's me out because I'm here to stand for what is true. &gt;&gt; They never want that. That's a thing that very I wish to speak on one of these nights. Samson stand in that same place. [clears throat] So somewhere along the line now let's watch what our influence is. Now we see uh uh Uzzekiah here. He was a great man and we find out because he took those terrific stands that he did that you know his kingdom was next to Solomon's he spread out even all the countries around about uh loved him and and they paid tribute to his kingdom. And we find out even weighed down in Egypt, his influence was felt. And this being the way he stood in this young prophet standing there before the king, he it was a great influence to Isaiah. how that God would bless any man that would be true to his word, regardless of what his politics tried to influence him to, regardless of what anything else tried to be. Hezekiah was determined to stay with the word and God blessed him and Isaiah saw it. that as usual, just like a group of people, just like the remark that I said about the businessman, when Uzzekiah begin to feel secure and he had just about got everything in the kingdom that God had for him, he got lifted up in his heart. Now, that's what's happened to our denominations all through the ages when they feel like they're big enough to say, "Now, we're that," then they get lifted up and that's when God leaves them. That's &gt;&gt; right. And if the businessman gets to that spot where we have, as brother Williams said, 15, but God can do more with 15 in his hand than he could with 1500 out of his hand. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; But we appreciate 1500 in his hand instead of 15 in his hand. &gt;&gt; If they'll all stay in his hand, &gt;&gt; that's the main thing. being influenced not by what great numbers we are, but by what a great God that we're representing &gt;&gt; and the kind of life that is in us by him that will influence others. Jesus said, "You are the salt of the earth." But if the salt has lost its savior, it is henceforth good for nothing, cast out, caught under the feet of man. We must never forget that we are salt. But if its salt loses its strength, that's its its power to contact. And salt can only save as it contacts. And if it loses its power of contact, then it is no more salt, but it's sand. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's to be made walks. And when we lose our influence as a father, as a mother, as a Christian, as a businessman, as a minister, when we lose our influence with people. Now, we can be very popular in the line of the world and go wrong with the world. But I mean as what we represent, we represent Christ. When we lose our influence as that as standing out, how can we blend in with the day when God so against the day? How could Micah say, "Go on up and prosper? My vision's right with yours." When he know that God had cursed that evil people, his vision had to be contrary. And a man's vision today that could go with the trend of the world and still remain a minister. There's something wrong with the man's vision. &gt;&gt; You know what God said about this rich Leo was seeing church? &gt;&gt; Put him on the outside. We cannot stand with the popular belief and vote of the day. We've got to be against that thing. Now, so it this king got along fine until he found out that all the nations was fearing him. He become largely uh populated. His kingdom got built up and he got lifted up in his heart with pride. You see, we're just I'm just a big man now. And that's the way out. The way up is down. &gt;&gt; How do you know which is up or down? Because if the world stand in space, how do you know which is up or down? So always he that humbles himself, God will exalt. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He that exalts himself, God will bring to a base. &gt;&gt; He'll bring him down. Always keep humble and be little in your own sight. &gt;&gt; No matter what God does for you, just see how much more humbler you can be all the time. &gt;&gt; More God blesses you, just keep getting more humble all the time. He can continue to bless. But when you get to a place you think, "I got it." You haven't got it. &gt;&gt; You're on your road out. &gt;&gt; You lose your influence. You lose the the strength of your testimony. When you women begin to uh want to be like the rest of women, there's something wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you man, you ministers be trying to become like uh pattern nature somebody else. When you businessmen try to do business on the scale that somebody else would do it on because they're prospers, prosperity don't always represent success in Christ. Sometimes very much to the contrary. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now pride he got lifted up and he thought what a great fellow I am so much he got lifted up till he tried to take the place of a minister. He goes into the temple which p picked up the sensor of fire and went up to the altar of incense. Now that was only consecrated man can do that. Now as I have said before so say that again businessmen are not preachers. We preachers have enough time to try to keep this thing straight. Let alone businessmen. You all are businessmen not ministers. And don't take the place of one or try to because you're not called for such. If you want somebody to speak at your conventions, get a preacher. Somebody's called to do so. Because you see what a struggle us ministers has got. So, you see what you do? And um Hezekiah here, he tried to to take the place of a priest. He thought, "Well, God's blessed me. Why can't I do it?" Don't you never get that in your head? God calls and predestinates and forains to his glory. &gt;&gt; Nothing. You remember in the Bible when Moses was bringing Israel out of Egypt across to to the promised land, do you remember one in there, Dayan, and those who got lifted up and said, "Now wait a minute, Moses, you try to be the only one on the beach. There's other holy men among here." And God said, "Separate yourself because I will destroy him." God had orained a certain thing to be done and it must be done that way. &gt;&gt; We're not to inject our own ideas. We're to respect his idea and his commandments. &gt;&gt; And not referring back to our sisters, but at the no matter what the other woman does, God's got your pattern laid here. That's right. &gt;&gt; No matter what uh some other layman done in the Bible, God's got your pattern here. What to do? We'll get to it after a while perhaps what the layman is to do. And the minister, all of us has our places and we must abide in our calling. &gt;&gt; Now, we find out that this man got lifted up. So he uh uh took the sensor and went forth to the altar which was only permitted by God to consecrated man to that office. He tried to take the minister's place and then the minister tried to correct him. We find out that four score priests besides the high priest come after him and told him sir. In other words like this God has blessed you. You're an honored man. You're a great man and God has blessed you in your work, but you you shouldn't do that. You're getting off of the beaten road. Oh, how I could say some things here. Yes. Getting off the beaten road. But, uh, be it the thing is the way it is, let's try to conserve what we can get a hold of. Uh he said you're off the track for the word of God says so and so. Only Aaron's generation shall do this. That's for Aaron and him alone and his children. So king, we honor you. We respect you. You're a great man. But don't try to do that. And was he humble? No, sir. He thought God's blessed me, so I'll just do what I want to. Now, watch my brethren. Be careful there because no matter how much God has filled you with his spirit and how much that you have done and how well you've been blessed, you stay with the calling of God. &gt;&gt; Don't get off on some traditions and organizational schemes and so forth. You better come back to the path. better come back to what God laid down at the beginning. Now, so we find out that this man when he was corrected instead of humbled himself and admitting that the word was right and God was right, he become angry. Hey, in other words, uh uh he was ready to kick him out of his organization. He was uh he was very upset about it. Uh very perplexed and oh he got angry and he have to turn around and say you just wait a minute. Do you realize who I am? Now when you're corrected by the word of God you must be subject to the word. &gt;&gt; And he said uh he would do as he pleased. He was the head of the thing. So he he'd just do as he wanted to. And you know what happened? He was smitten with leprosy. And while his anger, rage was upon him, the priest detected the leprosy in his face. Now you say, well, what you mean leprosy represents is is a type rather of sin. And when a man won't stand correction by the word of God, he's full of leprosy. Blows up and carries on. What does you what do you do? You ruin your influence. See, something happens. People knows and can tell the word that you're corrected by that you're not going to do it. Therefore, you ruin your influence and it hurt this fella. Anger got on him. And while he was in his anger, leprosy was in his face. And we find out that he not only did he drop the sensor, but he ran from the house of God to never be able to return again. Because no matter how great he was and how much influence he had had, he when he was corrected then he refused to take his correction because his social standing had become more to him than the word of God had become. &gt;&gt; I'm sure you understand what I'm driving at. &gt;&gt; It become more to him. His position as king become more to him than the word of God. When this businessman's organization gets to that place, when the minister of his organization gets to that place, then he's done. &gt;&gt; Don't faint when you're rebuked. When you read something in the scripture and you know that you should humble yourself and follow the word of God in the path that he ordained for you walk in, then you don't do it. Then first thing you know, it's over. your influence is spoiled. Now, we must remember that. And this young prophet, what a lesson that was to him. Then when he seen this king by this very thing, Isaiah learned one of his greatest lessons that no matter how great a man might be, how much influence he might have, but when he fails to walk in light, when he fails to obey God, then his influence is ruined and he's stuck off the field. Another thing Isaiah learned, he learned by this, that God orders his man to his place. Not you putting yourself in that place, but God puts his man in place. &gt;&gt; We must recognize that. &gt;&gt; I've often used this. Uh I like to hunt, as you know, up in the north when when the winter starts coming in, little ducks is born up there on the ponds. And as soon as that first cold breeze uh tops the mountains and a few flakes of snow falls, now that little duck was born in the spring up on that lake and he never was off the lake. He knows nothing about anything else but that lake. But just as sure as that breeze blows and he feels that breeze blow, he runs right out in the middle of that, swims out there and raises a little nose up the air and honks a few times and every duck on the pond will come right to him and he'll raise up with that instinct in him knowing that soon that pond's going to be froze over our lake and he'll go just as straight to Louisiana as he can go. He will. &gt;&gt; Why? There's something in him. &gt;&gt; It's a God-given instinct and he uses it. &gt;&gt; It guides him. Now, what does it do? What if he went a if that instinct led him farther north, then he would know there was something wrong and those ducks wouldn't follow him because he's going contrary to the regular path. And when we get ourselves to a place that we try to lead people contrary, they say, "Well, we the Methodists has got it. We the Baptist has got it." That isn't it. God's got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the word was God and the word still is God. &gt;&gt; So it's God that's God. &gt;&gt; So let's lead that way down the beaten path. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And not try to lead some other way. And then we find out that this little duck being that he was now the rest of the ducks seem to have any uh anything but amen. Because they something about that little fell that they knew the way that honk that bugle that he blowed. They they knew that he had the truth. And there's something about the gospel &gt;&gt; for the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "If the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will know how to prepare himself for a battle?" Now, but when the gospel gives a sound, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And we watch it and see that it's the truth and it's with the word, that's the thing that influences a real devil. Now there's others on the pond like water guineies and so forth they have another way mud hins and all such but they stay their own way but the real duck goes on God placed that little duck there and give him that because God placed him to be that and now God has set in the church &gt;&gt; God not the organization not the achievement of man to make bishops and so forth presbyers but God set in the church. First apostles, that's missionaries. Second day, prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists. God set them in the church. And every bugle will blow the same the same gospel. &gt;&gt; If he's a prophet, he blows the bugle of prophet. He foretells the things that is to come and hits every time. Good lesson, &gt;&gt; right? Not only do you have influence, but you're influencing. And I mean, I I I I was just felt so moved by this. Uh, you know, I the enemy fought me quite a bit, but I I just, you know, it's exactly what we need. &gt;&gt; We've got to really be aware of uh of what's influencing &gt;&gt; influence. It's a it's it's a major thing. And it's a major thing of this age, you know. That's why television is is uh is has such a a evil thing. It could have been used for the gospel, but it's not used for that. It the whole purpose of it is to influence you. And so they'll they'll get a program, they'll get a story, they'll get something going on and then they stop it. Right. right at the right spot. You know what I mean? Just when you're wanting to know what's next and then they fill your head with all kinds of of of stuff, whether it's a car, a soap, a a smell, or whatever it is. What are they trying to do? They're trying to influence you. &gt;&gt; They're trying to get you to that. They're trying to change the way you believe the change the way you act to change the decision you make, you know, and then then that becomes your your filter. You you you you filter you filter things through. Now, if if you become totally unaware that the influence is out there &gt;&gt; and that it's trying to work on you then and you become numb to it, then you're being influenced without you even knowing it. &gt;&gt; Now, that's deception at its highest form. &gt;&gt; But we've got to have that that filter on. We've got to have that ability to to to check what's influencing us. Let's just run through. I just want to run through real quick and just spend a just a a couple moments on this and try to have us out here in just a few minutes. He says you he says you know there are so many of us and most most all of us influence somebody by the things that we do the way we live and the things we say. &gt;&gt; Every one of you has an influence. &gt;&gt; You are held accountable &gt;&gt; for that influence. You know, you think you can just do something or say something. I thought the story about he told about his son. He says, "I sat him down. I told him not to do that." He says, "I know he's going to do it anyhow, but tell him anyway. Put it before him. Raise a child in the way it should go." &gt;&gt; So, there's certain times in our life that we're we're influenced. And so he he he goes on to ex explain about the influence. He says, "I think that's a very fine example for we parents is to set an example before our children." Now I I thought this was a tremendous thing to get s to sink in. Now you live your best and your worst at home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. that that becomes the the real measure, you know, look at yourself at home. That that's when you live your best. You get in your house, you think you can do things in your house, you know, or you can say things. It it's like like uh and and it's just it just something that uh we want to go forward, right? Isn't that really all that we want to do? We're all about preparing for the rapture, &gt;&gt; right? So, if you want to be more Christlike outside your home, you've got to start being more Christlike in your home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you know what I mean? You got to He He said always keep it before your children. &gt;&gt; Always tell them what's right. You know, it doesn't it doesn't hurt if you get upset or something to apologize for to your kids and say, you know, I shouldn't have done that or I shouldn't have said that. You forgive me because you're setting an example. &gt;&gt; You're having influence and we have influence. And when we failed to think that we have influence, then then we don't hold ourselves accountable &gt;&gt; and we're being held accountable by God, but we don't even know it. &gt;&gt; And that's what we want. We want to be conscious of God. &gt;&gt; We want to accept it in our minds. Can you imagine if you step out your door and you say, "Today I'm going to influence somebody." And as our messenger said, "And somebody's eternal destination might rest on the influence [snorts] that I have." &gt;&gt; And so he we he came down and he talked about influence. He said we should always try to reflect Christ in everything that we do. And then he mentioned the little plaque he put up. He says, "Go no place you would not to be found when Jesus should come." And then he said, "You know, say nothing that you wouldn't want Jesus to hear." And he went on. He says, he says, "If you want to be caught in that position when Christ comes," Amen. Don't you think that's a good thing? and and and keep that before you all the time. I I I'm just running down through to put some of these things out. We need people that that aren't influenced by politics &gt;&gt; or by public opinion. &gt;&gt; That can happen in a church. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's hard for me sometimes. I'm going to play a tape and I feel there's people that don't like you to play tapes. There people that believe in the live ministry. There's people that say we can listen to a tape anytime. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And there's all these voices. &gt;&gt; You don't understand. But it it's hard when you sit back and you say this was the voice of God to this generation. &gt;&gt; What you heard this morning wasn't about mysteries. It was about the secrets of influence &gt;&gt; and about the power. that your influence has &gt;&gt; because he goes through a whole stretch here and talks about losing that power, &gt;&gt; losing that testimony, losing that influence and becoming becoming nothing and the way that you build your influence and build your testimony. And that's important to us as Christians because we have a commission to go into all the world and preach the gospel. Our purpose is to lead people to the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And if we if we don't have influence, if we don't have a life, if we don't have a testimony &gt;&gt; and we lose that, &gt;&gt; then what's our value? And so he makes these statements. He says, he said, God com commissioned Joshua, this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, and then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, then thou shalt have good success. That's what makes you successful. &gt;&gt; We we we got sometimes we miss the whole key to success. The key the key to success if you keep the word of God, &gt;&gt; if you do what's honest and you do what's right. I know from business. I know from working from when I get a guy on the job and he's really hard to work and he's going to get in there and he's there to help. You don't have to time every time that you want to need help picking something up, you got to go find them. You know, he makes 15 trips to the bathroom. You you know what I mean? He he he lolly gags around and he he doesn't uh he he don't keep busy and he only does what he wants to do. That guy's not I'm not going to keeping him around the first time. I don't need him. &gt;&gt; You look better going than you did coming. &gt;&gt; But you get somebody that's there that's teachable, &gt;&gt; that can be corrected. That guy's got a job. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know. Brotherando called me. He said, I said, "You still working out there? I thought you were supposed to run a backhoe." He said, "Yeah." He said, "But I sweep all the floors out here and I stack all the thing and I take out the trash. They don't want to get rid of me." That's how you get successful. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; But you know, if you're lazy &gt;&gt; and you don't you you're not you're not thinking about your influence. &gt;&gt; You're not thinking about going the extra mile, &gt;&gt; then then you don't generate success. &gt;&gt; You know, you can't be successful in your mind. You can sit down in your mind and have the greatest business plan, the greatest idea to do anything, but if you won't get out there to work to put that into effect, &gt;&gt; you won't put the hours in, you won't put the time in, you won't put the effort in, then you're a daydreamer. &gt;&gt; As we would say, you're a success in your own mind. &gt;&gt; So now we're thinking about influence today. We're thinking about wanting to go forward and that we read that thing. When you get when it comes into your mind, into your heart, it it develops the whole consciousness of God &gt;&gt; that God's watching you. &gt;&gt; Who sang that song? The unseen eye is watching you. I forget that. That's probably one of my biggest problems is sometimes I just forget that anybody's watching, &gt;&gt; but he's watching you, right? He says, not only that, but you're you influence somebody at the same way you're traveling. &gt;&gt; You influence people by the way you're traveling. &gt;&gt; Have you ever asked yourself, "Where am I going? What way am I traveling? What's the travel of my life? Do you know what what's my journey? You know, the world don't want you to have a journey. They don't want you. You're running a race. You're going somewhere. You're traveling somewhere. This we're not just taking. We take one day the problems of one day at a time. We live one day at a time. That means we deal with the circumstances that approach us every day. We deal with that circumstance. We take care of that circumstance. We don't leave nothing for the other day. We get our lives right. We keep our lives straight. We make things right as we go because we're on we're traveling. &gt;&gt; I like that song. I feel like traveling on. We're not setting up camp. &gt;&gt; We're traveling. And if if we lose the consciousness that we're in a journey, we lose the consciousness that God's watching us, we lose the consciousness about our influence that we're affecting people, then then sort of what happens to us, we we just sort of we seem to self non-exist. &gt;&gt; You feel like you don't exist. You're you're just a part of society. You're just floating down just tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine. You you lose your purpose for your life. &gt;&gt; You lose the reason you're living. And when you you lose that, then you start to lose the joy of your salvation, right? and depression sets in and and all these other spirits get on you and and and then Satan starts lying to you that you're you're of no significance. &gt;&gt; You are you're the salt of the earth. &gt;&gt; You're a candle lit and put on a hill. &gt;&gt; What did he say? He says, "Then you lose your power to make contact. You you can't contact people. &gt;&gt; You don't you don't you you you you just you you you get so he pushes you make you so insignificant that you you almost cease to exist &gt;&gt; in your mind but you were placed here. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, there's so many of these quotes that are just flying off the page to me &gt;&gt; as I I see the great picture &gt;&gt; that he's drawing. &gt;&gt; He he said here he said he said and so he's talking about influence and I thought this was such a great uh he was talking about that lady that had the makeup on. Remember now this listen what he said influence somebody started it. &gt;&gt; Do you ever ask yourself where does this come from? &gt;&gt; Where did that start? &gt;&gt; Who brought that in? &gt;&gt; Things come into the church. Somebody brings it in. Maybe the minister misses it and and and he fails to speak out against it or or a trend gets in. You know, I there's a lot of things I don't like. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't like this these leotards that you put on that hang below your dress, you know. Now, I don't have a lot of word for that, but only I can say where did that come from? You got to pray about that. &gt;&gt; What kind of influence does it have? Where did you get that influence? Where did you pick that up? Did you see it on somebody? Somebody started it. &gt;&gt; Did did was it appealing to you? What brought it on? You know, I think sometimes we we we we fail we fail to to see where the influence come. Where does it come from? What effect does it have? What what's it doing? We if we don't then we stop asking the questions that are necessary to try a spirit. &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us that we've got to try every spirit. Where did this come from? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the effect? &gt;&gt; Not only what's the effect on others, but what's the effect on me? &gt;&gt; And so it it gets started, things get started. And what happens when something gets started? Sometimes you got to go back and you got to correct it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you don't take the correction of the word, we just heard you lose your testimony and your influence because the people will know that's what the word says and they'll know you're doing something contrary to the word &gt;&gt; and it affects I know how it is having a church. you'll have a visitor and maybe they don't know anything about our dress code. Maybe they don't know anything about uh how we approach service, &gt;&gt; but we're glad to have them &gt;&gt; and they'll come out and and then there's always people and I hope you are friendly to them. Thank you. We're so happy to have you here. Sometimes I try to get out and see them if I can. and we want them to know they're welcome and then somebody will come on and say, "Oh, this person was this and this and that and that." It's just the way that it goes sometimes. &gt;&gt; But you you take he says, "But and so you see things come in. You you've got to you got to you got to look at things and understand where did that come from? Where did that start? Why are they in this condition? &gt;&gt; And that's what he said about that lady at the restaurant. He said she was a nice girl, &gt;&gt; polite, respectful. And he said, "Isn't it terrible that the devil conjured up something and put that, [cough and clears throat] excuse me, and put that on American women? Where did it start? Where did it come from? How did it get on us?" &gt;&gt; He always said it this way. I I I know how the sheep got out, but how did the goats get in? &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And he's talking on down here and he says, he said, "Don't you never go by what?" Someone see somebody of this country, I don't care, or other country or some minister's wife or somebody. Don't you never be influenced by them. &gt;&gt; You let the Bible influence you to the things that's right. right there. &gt;&gt; When you see something and you say, "Well, I like that dress. I like how that fits. I like how that looks. I like that look." Now, I I can tell you right out, you know, when they get those little teeny narrow cuffs down here like that, you know what I mean? And they wear those skinny little tight pants that look like a man's been in some sort of gym somewhere, you know, like he's watched too many Aerrol Flynn movies. And and uh that might be too out for you. But they they wear these the guys wearing these little tight stuff and or their pants hanging all down their hips and everything. It started somewhere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you're being influenced by it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look at the Bible. &gt;&gt; Take these godly men. Let our messenger be our example. &gt;&gt; There's some godly sister, some godly brother that you can run them through the scriptures. Be what's influencing. But you know what he says? They do it. It becomes all right. &gt;&gt; It just becomes acceptable. Now he said here, not only does that happen to the individual, it happens to groups of people. &gt;&gt; It happens to churches. We get influenced. In other words, something has the power over what we believe. Can you imagine influence changing your belief? It's hard to hold the line sometimes because sometimes you might feel like you're isolated. But listen to what he says here. He says, "God don't tolerate that stuff." And brother, how could God tolerate such a thing as that when he's against it? He says so in his word. And our woman has become in our churches in such a mere practice many times of dressing sex appeal. &gt;&gt; Now where did high heels come from? High heels were invented to give women sex appeal. Now, I I know some of you sisters may have never heard that, [clears throat] &gt;&gt; but there's days I want to change the name of this church to High Heel Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, the deacon's wife's wearing high heels and she sees that person do it and another sister says she's wearing it. You know, our messenger told us, you can't walk on this highway in those heels. &gt;&gt; And anything that's starting to lift you up, &gt;&gt; the idea is so this backside gets &gt;&gt; a little better shape &gt;&gt; and it pushes you out. We might as well be honest. &gt;&gt; It's sex appeal. &gt;&gt; It's of the devil &gt;&gt; and somebody started it &gt;&gt; and somebody saw somebody else do it just like he said. Some minister's wife somewhere cut her hair &gt;&gt; and the next sister said and they started coming up with all the excuses. It's not in my eyes. I can't worship with hair fall in my eyes. Well, since when do you worship in your hair? &gt;&gt; You worship from your heart. &gt;&gt; And then you get all kinds of excuses and then you start selling &gt;&gt; your belief &gt;&gt; and your reasoning. &gt;&gt; This is the reason we do that. That's the reason. Oh, sister such and such, brother such was a, you know, I I thought a little lady was the prophet of God. He preached everything under the sun. He thought of sin. And this lady comes up and took Brother Bram's hand, said, "Oh, thank you very much. What a wonderful sermon. You didn't touch me." And Brother Bram said, "That must have been some sately woman." And then the brother said, "Well, Brother Brand, you covered everything but gossip, and that's the biggest gossiper in the whole church." &gt;&gt; See, these things are influences. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, that sister's not going to take off high heels &gt;&gt; until she gets a revelation &gt;&gt; that &gt;&gt; she saw high heels. &gt;&gt; They put it on the store. &gt;&gt; They put it in the ad. She saw it somewhere. &gt;&gt; Where did they come from? &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know when when when it the fashion even came in, &gt;&gt; but it started somewhere. &gt;&gt; Just like piercing. &gt;&gt; Well, we know that's a heathen thing. &gt;&gt; The word of God says it's heathen. &gt;&gt; I go out to eat, have a nice waitress and everything. She's got one of those big things in her nose hanging down. I can't look at her because I'll lose my appetite. She said, "What would you like?" comes in. &gt;&gt; I'd like two over easy. &gt;&gt; It started somewhere. &gt;&gt; When you see something, even though it's appealing, [snorts] you got to ask yourself, where does this come from? You know, a lot of the songs we sing, if we ever took it back to the artist, &gt;&gt; we ever took it back who wrote it, &gt;&gt; we might have a second opinion &gt;&gt; cuz we don't want to carry the influence. &gt;&gt; We don't want to give our amen to it. &gt;&gt; But you understand we've we've that filter has left the church. But if we're going to go forward &gt;&gt; and we're going to have have a testimony &gt;&gt; and we're going to have influence, then we've got to know &gt;&gt; what's influencing us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to understand those things. So we know that that's when it comes it it becomes uh it becomes you know and they they get it and he says very seldom ever spoke against from the pulpit. He says secial very seldom ever spoke about from the pulpit and if it's not it keeps coming in. &gt;&gt; Our dresses get tight. Now, I know if you're raised in a tradition in the country, &gt;&gt; you know, I I've been to a lot of weddings. You know what I mean? And you know what I feel about this dancing at weddings? I'll make it public. If you're going to dance at your reception, you cannot use this church. and I will not marry you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; End of story. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I don't understand it &gt;&gt; cuz I've been to them. And the Christians are out there dancing. Their unbelieving uncles out there dancing. Their unbelieving aunts out there does. There are unbelieving cousins are out there dancing. It's believers and unbelievers all mixed together doing one bugaloo. boy. And you talk about the fashion show, &gt;&gt; the high heels come out, &gt;&gt; the dresses get so tight they look like they've been shrink wrapped on &gt;&gt; and you we start allowing it &gt;&gt; and then it becomes the influence and it becomes a tradition and it becomes okay. is not okay. &gt;&gt; God don't like it. &gt;&gt; He says it right here. &gt;&gt; And we get to thinking just because we dance in the spirit and shout in the spirit and we praise God that it makes it okay. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't. &gt;&gt; He says it right here. He says, he says, "And yet," he says, "Sex appeal is very seldom spoke of against the Paul, but and yet we shout and jump around and speak in tongues." That's the reason that this great move of Pentecost is not getting anywhere. It's because there's no sincerity behind it. &gt;&gt; It's becomes an emotion. Another it loses the discernment to recognize influence. &gt;&gt; That's the secret to the greatest battle ever fought. Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; Right? Satan brings the accusation. If you believe it, it becomes real &gt;&gt; and it gains power. &gt;&gt; If you refuse it, you refuse to let the accusation influence you. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be influenced. &gt;&gt; Satan is is Satan gives threats. Right? &gt;&gt; You'll lose your job, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, if you believe that, now that's going to influence you and you're going to readjust your behavior to keep that job. Wouldn't it be wonderful in a real Christian attitude, you could look your boss right in the face &gt;&gt; and say, you know, God gave me this job &gt;&gt; and before I lose this job, you will be gone. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying ugly. &gt;&gt; Do you have that confidence? to have that assurity &gt;&gt; just to know and have that awareness &gt;&gt; that you're not going to let outside influences start working on you. &gt;&gt; The Bible says we're fools to compare ourselves one with another. In other words, we're fools to let one another influence ourselves outside of the word of God. That's the truth. I might be getting long. I'm going to close up now. And he says this. He says, "Now, I'm not trying to be different. It's trying to be sincere. Right. &gt;&gt; I believe that we're in the last days &gt;&gt; and we got a great message, but all of our our shouting and speaking tongues will be of no effect. You can see it among us. You can't see that we're growing in numbers, but but are we growing in power? We're still on the same grounds that we were when we started 40 years ago. &gt;&gt; We should already be over in the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, have have we gained power? &gt;&gt; How about power to discern &gt;&gt; between good and evil? Hebrews 5:14 that you're babes not able to discern between good and evil, not ready for strong milk. Our power to discern, wait a minute, what's the influence of this? Where does it come from? Where did it get started? Have you ever seen fashions? I got boxes and boxes of ties because I know those big ones are going to come back. Isn't that what they say? Just wait a while, it'll be back in fashion. &gt;&gt; You know what? We ought to have our own fashion. &gt;&gt; We ought to have a godly look. I don't care what color. You know, I'm not trying to clone everybody, but there ought there ought to be a way that your dresses fall that are modest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That your tops aren't so tight, that your sleeves aren't way up to your shoulders and your neck lines are decent, guys. That you're that you know you're you're neat and you're clean. You know what I mean? You you at least get your button up to the at least the one before the top. You know, you don't got four or five buttons hanging down like you think you're Tarzan or something. It's all influence. Right. &gt;&gt; I would be remissed as a pastor if we didn't understand that this is the path forward. &gt;&gt; The church keeping the influence of the world out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you've got to help one another do that. The Bible says, "You older sisters, &gt;&gt; go to the youngers, teach them how to be good wives. You hear a sister talking about her husband, you ought to pull her aside. Don't you ever, ever, ever talk about your husband &gt;&gt; to nobody. &gt;&gt; Let me say it from here. Don't you ever, ever, ever, not even to the one sister that you promises you, she won't tell nobody. &gt;&gt; She's already got the list because she's got somebody that doesn't tell somebody. &gt;&gt; Who doesn't tell somebody? Who doesn't tell somebody? And if somebody starts probing, &gt;&gt; asking questions, &gt;&gt; trying to get to the heart of the matter, you discern right away. That's a devil. &gt;&gt; None of your business. &gt;&gt; Did me and Lesie fight this morning? None of your business. The best and worst is where &gt;&gt; at home. &gt;&gt; Where does it live? You leave it at &gt;&gt; home. &gt;&gt; You make it right &gt;&gt; at home. &gt;&gt; Don't let that influence. It's a terrible influence. the bridling the tongue is one of the hardest things to do. We're just closing up. He says and we know that we're in Lady Oia and he he he mentions this way the way up is down. &gt;&gt; Humility. Anytime you feel that you start getting lifted up on your inside, check yourself real quick. &gt;&gt; Give the glory to the Lord. &gt;&gt; I know we desire recognition. It's our human nature. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said we all like compliments. &gt;&gt; We all like the here. &gt;&gt; Give out compliments &gt;&gt; and stay humble. He said whole churches can get to to think that that there's something &gt;&gt; that we've got to move or we've got the doctrine or we've got the truth. When you get that way, things start slipping in. you start taking stands, you know, and you start developing uh certain areas that you're going to be dominant in and that you're going to put all the emphasis on, whether it's music, whether it's a a certain doctrine, and then if nobody else has a revelation you have, then you know they're kind of a lesser value. or we put it on numbers. Numbers, he just told us numbers don't mean anything. &gt;&gt; All numbers means is it's easier for people to hide in the crowd. It's it's it's a lot harder if you're sitting in a sermon with six people and they're preaching three kinds of believers. numbers don't mean anything. &gt;&gt; You know, our brothers here, I I appreciate them so much. They go to a lot of the smaller churches. They'll travel a long ways for 20, for 30, for 10, for 15. Why? Because it's not the number, it's the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the body. &gt;&gt; The whole body benefits. &gt;&gt; A person gets healed or delivered in Denver, the whole body is blessed. &gt;&gt; Billy's going up to &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; St. John's Island in the Antarctic. &gt;&gt; We've been telling him, Billy, it's awful cold there. What's the weather forecast? Well, it's the high is 31 with rain. Well, when it's 31, that rain isn't Texas rain. It's mushy, wet, sloppy sleep. Still going to go. &gt;&gt; I warned them. Why? &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? Well, there's only 50 up there. There's only a hundred. No. The kingdom of God is worth one soul. &gt;&gt; One, [snorts] &gt;&gt; are you conscious of your influence? &gt;&gt; God's got a pattern. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, you know, and and what happens if you get lifted up? You you you think you can do everything. You try to take somebody else's place. &gt;&gt; We all have a calling. &gt;&gt; So, there's two questions I'm asking this morning. What path are you traveling? And are you aware of your calling? God called you. &gt;&gt; Our messenger said remain in the calling where he called you. The spirits you're in, the things you do, the people you contact. We don't have any ladder to climb. I think it was Elena told Darien that uh you know he climbed up a ladder and he fell and broke his wrist. She says, "Darren, you you climbed the wrong ladder. You're supposed to be climbing Jacob's ladder. We're not climbing a ladder here. &gt;&gt; We're going to heaven. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; God placed you. Wherever you are, the people you're around, &gt;&gt; that's the influence. &gt;&gt; That that you're a shining light right there. You want to influence your office. You want to influence your job site. You want to influence where you go to the grocery store. I've told you the story. We sat in the living room and at at Leslie's brother-in-law, Danny Beasel, his his grandfather was there. And I sat down. He was reading his Bible. And I said, "That's wonderful. Where are you reading?" and and he said uh uh I think his last name was Gernzie and he said I I I'm reading here he's I said where are you from? He said I'm from Jeffersonville. Jeffersonville, Indiana. I said that's wonderful. I said did did you know William Brandham? He says yes I was brother Brandham's dry cleaner. I dry dry cleananed all his suits. I thought, can you imagine? No wonder the guy's sitting there, how many years old, blessed, reading his Bible. He'd be grabbing them suits. You know what I mean? Well, I'd love just to have, you know what I mean? If &gt;&gt; I mean, I I I put a one of brother Bram's tithes on one time and went and preached that the most anointed sermon I ever had in my life. &gt;&gt; And he's blessed, &gt;&gt; right? And I so I asked him, he said, "But Ram was the kindest, most gentlest man I ever met. Never complained." I thought, "Influence." &gt;&gt; You don't even know the effect that you have. How important is us to keep a good spirit, &gt;&gt; to keep a happy spirit, &gt;&gt; to let the joy of the Lord, &gt;&gt; not to get down. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the devil. &gt;&gt; God had ordained a certain thing to be done and it must be done that way. We're not to interject our own ideas. We're to respect his ideas and his commandments. And he goes on and he talks about God has a pattern in his Bible and that's what we've got to stay with. And so we'll just we'll just close up. He says, "Now watch my brethren. Be careful because no matter how much God has filled you with his spirit [snorts] and how much that you have done and how well you've been blessed. You stay with the calling of God. Don't get off on some tradition or organizational scheme and so forth. You better come back to the path. better come back to what God laid down at the beginning. And and that that really let's go back to the message, &gt;&gt; back to the word of God, back to what we're built on. I have to say it. There's been a lot of influences &gt;&gt; in the message today. A lot of song trends, a lot of music trends, a lot of dress trends, a lot of things have come and and I don't have the ability to catch everything, to hear everything, or to see everything. And as the years begin to pile up and the days of my life are being taken off till my appointed time. What a lot of times you can do what you used to be able to do in the flesh, you can't do anymore. But you hope that the people around you understand the word of God enough that they're going to hold a standard &gt;&gt; that they're going to gain the consciousness of the word of God and they're going to ask the question, where did this come from? Somebody started it. When did this come in? When did we start doing that? And run it back. School, children in school. School's a very difficult place. Lot of influence. Parents, watch your children. Listen. Children, don't hide something that [snorts] you know is right. Don't sneak in your closet to watch and listen to things that if it's contrary to what mom and dad's telling you. That's something that's trying to influence you, trying to get you to go a certain way, make decisions. All it ends up is it makes you rebellious and you're you're fighting. How many young girls have listened to to uh some young boy sweet talk them and they have no real intentions, have no honor, you know? I mean, they they they they stay away from your parents. A guy that's got really good honor. The prophet of God said that you never go pick up a girl and honk your horn. You know why he said that? &gt;&gt; He said, "You go to the front door. &gt;&gt; You meet the dad. &gt;&gt; You look in the eye. You say, "Sir, I'm taking your daughter to dinner. I'll have her home at 8:00. I'll treat her respectful." &gt;&gt; What happened to that? When do when do we start becoming sneaks in the night? &gt;&gt; What happened to our our dignity, our our morals, and our honesty? Because the only thing that's going to attack it is the devil. &gt;&gt; Because the devil is trying to influence So, if he can influence us, and I I was going to get into that maybe this evening, but if he can get into that, you heard our messenger say it destroys our influence and our testimony and it makes us powerless. And what is the one thing Satan wants to do is make the word of God of none effect. And that's why we said you can't put faith in the lie. &gt;&gt; Stay with the truth &gt;&gt; and and and and be mindful. And that message influence it struck me because I I begin to realize that if you don't know how he's doing it, you can see that something's wrong and you can say that's wrong. But you got to be careful that he didn't plant a seed to get you to start to think &gt;&gt; and then he comes back why is it wrong and you start to reason because he said so that settles it. And I believe if our messenger says how many times did he preach influence five times? six times. It had to be a major a major event. So, Satan is trying to influence. Let's stand against the influence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's resist the accusation. Let's don't put faith in anything but God's word. &gt;&gt; Let's stay with it. Ask yourself what what is it that I'm presenting? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sisters, ask yourself when you look in the mirror, are you trying to adjust the way you look so you look better? In whose eyes? &gt;&gt; The eyes of the world. &gt;&gt; Or are you going to let your character shine? because you won't take this body with you. &gt;&gt; The only thing you're going to take with you is your character. &gt;&gt; You know, you think, you know, you can look in the mirror and think you're handsome. You know what I mean? And put on the certain smell that you think uh is going to just catch the [snorts] scent of the lady. You know, they got all those lying advertisements out there, you know, where all the girls are flocking to a certain smell. Well, just to let you know, if it came to money or smell, the woman will take the money. &gt;&gt; But a Christian woman will take the character. Amen. &gt;&gt; She would rather have a good, honest, providing man &gt;&gt; that loves her and loves her children &gt;&gt; than she would anything else. &gt;&gt; A real sister wants spiritual leadership. &gt;&gt; Somebody will grab the Bible and lay the foundations of Christianity, whether he looks like Prince Charming or not. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she's got one promise. If he isn't good-looking here, God will make him good-looking over there. &gt;&gt; And we need to get back &gt;&gt; to the reality of influence. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. I don't know what time it is, but maybe a little longer. Uh Lord be with you. It's a wonderful message. If you'd like to go study it again, influence your power to influence. What's influencing you? The power to change somebody's belief, decisions, or actions. What's affecting your actions? May it be God's word. God bless you if you come lead in some worship this morning. Thank you so much. God richly bless you. Hope you enjoyed the message this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, how many wants to be influenced by the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to be even for one another, we want to be the right kind of influence. Let's all stand this morning. I believe we could just look in our own hearts this morning and say, "Lord, let your word have an effect on me this morning. What I heard, what our pastor talked about, Lord, I just want that to work in myself that it may produce what you want me to be." Amen. I feel the [singing] boom. I hear the [singing and music] call.
