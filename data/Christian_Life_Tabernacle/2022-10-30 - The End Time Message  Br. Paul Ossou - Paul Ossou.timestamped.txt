[44:50] so Revelation chapter 10 we'll just read
[44:53] seven he says but in the day of the
[44:56] voice of the seventh angel when it shall
[44:59] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[45:02] be finished as he has declared to his
[45:04] servants the prophets
[45:07] foreign
[45:26] after what we heard this morning as I
[45:28] was saying a while ago
[45:32] when we come to church every day
[45:38] when God gives us the strength to come
[45:40] to church
[45:42] it's because we have an objective
[45:46] it's because we have a goal is
[45:51] it's because God has certainly spoken to
[45:55] us
[45:58] because it's like this young Eagle like
[46:01] we heard this morning
[46:03] we heard a voice
[46:05] [Music]
[46:08] that we have recognized
[46:12] that we have recognized as the voice of
[46:15] Our Lord
[46:19] that's why that voice out of all the
[46:23] denominations
[46:28] that voice got out out of everything
[46:32] else that we were doing
[46:33] [Music]
[46:34] to bring us to attract us to something
[46:40] and that thing is the message
[46:43] on foreign
[47:24] and when we see all of those things come
[47:27] to pass
[47:29] we know we are at the end time
[47:39] Timothy chapter three
[47:44] the Bible is given as a description of
[47:46] what men will be at the end time
[47:49] it was said it will be uh ungrateful
[47:53] it will be unrighteous it will be a
[47:58] cruel
[47:59] it will be uh there will be enemies of
[48:02] those that do good
[48:06] they will love more pleasure than they
[48:08] will do God
[48:12] and that's what we see today
[48:16] when we go out in the street
[48:20] the the the heart is bleeding
[48:23] conditions when we see the condition of
[48:27] the world today
[48:31] when we see where Humanity has gotten to
[48:34] today
[48:36] but God sent us a message
[48:39] [Music]
[48:40] to take us out of that world
[48:46] to help us to be a a trampoline or
[48:51] somewhere someone that can take someone
[48:53] else out of it
[48:58] we're seen in the Bible that says what
[49:01] happened in the time of Noah will also
[49:03] happen again
[49:07] what happened in the time of Noah will
[49:09] also happen again in this end time
[49:13] when we go back in the Book of Genesis
[49:19] and we consider what happens in the time
[49:21] of Noah
[49:24] the Bible tells us in Genesis chapter
[49:27] 6.
[49:30] that it was a time where people were
[49:32] multiplying themselves on the first of
[49:34] the Earth
[49:36] the children were born
[49:42] that the sons of men begin to look and
[49:45] they were they being begin to be
[49:47] attracted to the daughters of the world
[49:50] and they took them as women
[49:56] the scripture says that the heart of men
[49:59] only turned towards the wrong
[50:03] and God repented for making having made
[50:06] a man
[50:09] and that's what we see today
[50:16] when we see the condition of humanity
[50:21] we realize what the grace of God is
[50:25] it says that said that for you
[50:29] behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[50:43] that the children were ten times uh more
[50:47] uh tempted with things than in that time
[50:50] than they than the race in this time
[50:54] what can we say about our children today
[51:00] that's why this message
[51:03] [Music]
[51:06] it has to help us to impact our children
[51:11] to be impacted ourselves
[51:15] to be outside of this world
[51:18] because the Temptation is great
[51:22] conditions
[51:24] the world is in the disgrace condition
[51:29] but God has given us his grace
[51:38] that God helped us to understand that
[51:41] this message is the unmerited grace of
[51:44] God
[51:49] that it's the the only way that God has
[51:52] brought forth so he can get us out of
[51:54] these things
[51:58] when the heart of man was continually
[52:01] evil in the time of Noah
[52:05] federal
[52:10] dollars
[52:12] even though the daughters of men became
[52:15] so beautiful to the point that they were
[52:18] only there to seduce the sons of God
[52:24] Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[52:31] and I believe we're just of the great
[52:33] Temptation in our time
[52:36] that every one of us here tonight
[52:39] concerned us on the election
[52:42] his conscience of his election
[52:46] that God knew you before the foundation
[52:49] of the world
[52:50] you can say tonight
[52:55] that have found Grace in the eyes of God
[53:10] God show Noah the way by which he could
[53:14] escape the the flood that was coming
[53:18] we are in the same condition today
[53:24] and God has shown us the way by which we
[53:27] can escape
[53:30] when we read what happens in the time of
[53:33] lot
[53:40] when I was still a student in in in a
[53:43] medical field I was towards the end of
[53:46] my studies
[53:47] it's about 20 years ago
[53:51] in Psychiatry Lobo sexuality
[53:58] the the
[53:59] uh almost sexual homosexuality was
[54:03] written down as a disease as a
[54:06] psychiatrist the psychiatrist would call
[54:08] it a disease
[54:11] it was a a mental trouble that was
[54:15] written by the psychiatrist
[54:19] but today the devil is so much perverted
[54:23] everything
[54:26] but even preachers they don't get to
[54:29] where they can denounce those type of
[54:31] stuff because
[54:33] they're saying it's an homophobia
[54:37] um
[54:42] that because of that
[54:46] if God doesn't destroy this world
[54:51] he's obligated to raise up against Sodom
[54:55] and Gomorrah
[54:59] we are not against people in that
[55:01] condition
[55:02] we are not homophobians
[55:06] but we know it's an evil spirit
[55:10] that is in those people
[55:14] we condemn that spirit
[55:18] so you can bring those people to come to
[55:21] God
[55:22] foreign
[56:00] how can children be part of this
[56:06] but when we realize the condition of the
[56:09] world tonight
[56:12] even in the the kids the children
[56:16] primary schools
[56:17] they start to teach the children
[56:20] that you can have in the house
[56:24] your dad and your mom of the same sex
[56:28] okay what a destruction
[56:33] the Jew but God
[56:36] he provided away
[56:39] he provided a way foreign
[56:44] to help men come out of that condition
[56:52] God is given
[56:56] the same way was to escaping the time of
[56:59] the waters
[57:07] the way of Salvation tonight
[57:11] the way of Salvation in the end time
[57:16] it's the message of the end time
[57:23] when I was thinking about this message
[57:26] I was so comforted this morning
[57:30] when Brother David was reading this uh
[57:33] uh uh uh
[57:39] that God needs people that are going to
[57:42] condemn Hollywood tonight
[57:46] sometimes people get in easily
[57:50] but foreign
[57:52] sometimes people they they abide in
[57:54] there easily
[57:59] that's good
[58:01] because no one is calling it out
[58:05] because
[58:08] she's starting to teach that it's normal
[58:10] in society
[58:13] but what's normal in society
[58:18] and it's not in accordance with the word
[58:22] it doesn't matter to us
[58:25] what concerns us
[58:28] it's what is in accordance with the word
[58:34] and God in this same time of course they
[58:38] said the conditions because of the
[58:41] condition that we are seeing
[58:43] he says behold
[58:46] I will send you Elijah the prophet
[58:52] God described who this Elijah will be
[58:57] and we are all certain
[59:01] that we have met this Elijah the prophet
[59:04] no
[59:06] we can say to our neighbors come
[59:10] like Philip could tell Nathaniel
[59:15] here we have found
[59:18] him to him the prophet has talked about
[59:22] that's right
[59:27] in the Christian walk
[59:32] says we go through uh three stages
[59:37] justification
[59:40] sanctification
[59:42] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:45] and after those three sages
[59:48] it's God himself
[59:50] who comes and he abides in US
[59:54] Le Mondo see the world also
[59:58] it's also going through three stages
[1:00:03] the Bible tells us in uh First Peter
[1:00:06] chapter three
[1:00:09] First Peter chapter three
[1:00:18] uh first
[1:00:23] uh 18 to 21
[1:00:27] okay
[1:00:33] it says for Christ had once suffered for
[1:00:37] sin
[1:00:40] has once Christ suffered for sin the
[1:00:43] just for the young for the unjust that
[1:00:46] he might bring us to God being put to
[1:00:49] death in the flesh but quickened by by
[1:00:53] the Spirit by which also he went and
[1:00:57] preached unto the spirits in prisons it
[1:01:01] says which sometimes were disobedient
[1:01:04] were once uh were once the
[1:01:07] long-suffering of God waited in the day
[1:01:10] of Noah while the ark was a preparing it
[1:01:14] says wherein wearing few that is eight
[1:01:18] Souls were saved by water
[1:01:22] it says
[1:01:24] like the figure where unto even the
[1:01:27] Baptist the baptism do also now save uh
[1:01:31] as not not to put away of the filth of
[1:01:36] the Flesh of the flesh but the answer of
[1:01:39] a good conscience towards God
[1:01:42] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:01:46] here's the Bible showing us
[1:01:59] it was a
[1:02:01] symbolism of baptism
[1:02:07] it was a time where the world received
[1:02:10] its baptism
[1:02:14] the baptism of water
[1:02:19] it says it's an engagement of a good
[1:02:21] conscience of a person
[1:02:25] it's like we have heard the word
[1:02:30] when we have realized that the the way
[1:02:34] that we were taking
[1:02:36] was not the right way
[1:02:40] we repent
[1:02:43] it was the first preaching of Peter
[1:02:47] repent
[1:02:53] that your sins may be forgiven
[1:02:57] ESS
[1:03:00] the the Earth receive its baptism by
[1:03:04] water
[1:03:07] calls that the justification
[1:03:14] God made us in the condition of sin
[1:03:19] when the word is preached the people of
[1:03:22] Jesus
[1:03:24] when the scripture says in the book of
[1:03:27] Acts chapter 2.
[1:03:30] it strikes our heart new look on this
[1:03:33] circle conditions we recognize that our
[1:03:37] condition is not a good one
[1:03:40] when the word is
[1:03:43] and our hearts are broken send it back
[1:03:49] it doesn't mean that God wants us to
[1:03:52] remain in the condemnation Condition
[1:03:54] it's true that the word will condemn us
[1:03:59] the word will call out the things that
[1:04:01] we are doing
[1:04:11] it's not for us to remain under that
[1:04:14] condemnation
[1:04:15] but that we may repent
[1:04:19] that we may be sorry for what we have
[1:04:21] done
[1:04:23] it's not the question of just turning a
[1:04:26] page
[1:04:27] it's to repent sincerely
[1:04:32] that you may take the decision to change
[1:04:35] directions
[1:04:40] who has shown you that what you did is
[1:04:42] wrong
[1:04:44] he continues to show you
[1:04:47] here is what you can do that's right
[1:04:51] because the Gulf of God
[1:04:54] it's not to condemn you
[1:04:59] it's to attract you to himself
[1:05:05] that you can attract people
[1:05:08] by by the preaching of the word
[1:05:11] or by teaching
[1:05:14] but mostly
[1:05:17] that the Sinners are attracted
[1:05:20] by the preaching of the word
[1:05:23] that will break his heart
[1:05:26] and then he receives the teachings
[1:05:30] so he can be positioned
[1:05:36] that God knew him before the foundation
[1:05:40] of the world
[1:05:43] that God predestined to him predestined
[1:05:46] in him for the glory
[1:05:47] and the justification
[1:05:50] when God justifies you but when I'm says
[1:05:56] you repented
[1:05:59] you confessed your sins
[1:06:02] God takes the sins
[1:06:06] he puts it in the sea of God
[1:06:08] forgetfulness journeyman God himself who
[1:06:13] forgets it
[1:06:15] but you did those sins
[1:06:18] then when you present yourself before
[1:06:21] God when God is looking at you
[1:06:24] he says you have never sinned
[1:06:40] that sister did such and such to me
[1:06:44] even if I don't have a bad sentiment
[1:06:47] towards you
[1:06:48] like yes don't but that remains in my
[1:06:51] memory
[1:06:52] but when God has Justified you
[1:06:55] he forgives you
[1:06:58] and he forgets it that you had done it
[1:07:08] and that's when you come to him with all
[1:07:10] your heart
[1:07:13] when you repent sincerely
[1:07:17] when you decide to change directions
[1:07:21] he's faithful
[1:07:24] he won't condemn you
[1:07:27] regardless
[1:07:29] look when God came in the human flesh
[1:07:32] Jesus Christ
[1:07:37] they they they they brought to him a
[1:07:41] woman who was caught in adultery
[1:07:44] the law was clear
[1:07:47] you would you arrest once in such
[1:07:49] condition you're going to have to Stone
[1:07:52] her
[1:08:05] before God in the human flesh
[1:08:09] Jesus looked at the woman
[1:08:12] and he knew that the woman had done
[1:08:14] wrong just
[1:08:17] God knew that you done something wrong
[1:08:21] I may not know
[1:08:23] the pastor may not know it
[1:08:27] but you and God knows what's going on
[1:08:31] but God is Not condemning you
[1:08:34] when this woman
[1:08:41] I don't condemn you
[1:08:44] just go and sing no more
[1:08:48] and when Jesus
[1:08:51] it means he took the past of that woman
[1:08:56] he puts it in no sea of forgetfulness
[1:08:59] if you come back to Jesus and you say
[1:09:03] that
[1:09:04] before yesterday she was caught in
[1:09:07] adultery Jesus is looking she never done
[1:09:10] it
[1:09:12] but go and sin no more
[1:09:17] and when you receive this baptism
[1:09:24] you come by the sanctification
[1:09:30] the sanctification is the word of God
[1:09:33] that sanctifies you
[1:09:34] it's this message that sanctifies
[1:09:39] it's this message that shows you what
[1:09:42] your position
[1:09:44] what is God wanting out of you
[1:09:47] after too much how do does God want you
[1:09:49] to walk
[1:09:51] that you may be Holy Father
[1:09:55] says the sanctification
[1:09:57] it's to wash it means and to set aside
[1:10:02] for service
[1:10:03] when God washes you
[1:10:07] and they set you aside for service
[1:10:12] but it comes
[1:10:14] that God washes you
[1:10:17] come the Devil Comes the next day
[1:10:21] the Temptation is great and you give up
[1:10:26] but God doesn't want you to remain in
[1:10:29] that state
[1:10:45] sometimes the preacher May point exactly
[1:10:49] at what's happening in your condition
[1:10:51] when that happens to you
[1:10:55] be happy
[1:10:57] because God knows you
[1:11:00] and it's because he knows you
[1:11:03] that is interested in you that he's
[1:11:07] talking about you
[1:11:09] that is calling your attention
[1:11:12] so you can remain Sanctified
[1:11:16] because he has something that he wants
[1:11:18] to do with you
[1:11:20] it's when you are sanctified
[1:11:25] that you will realize
[1:11:27] that when you do something wrong your
[1:11:30] heart is broken you said oh Lord forgive
[1:11:32] me
[1:11:33] says that the just
[1:11:52] and in your heart you know you're a son
[1:11:55] of God
[1:11:58] that God knew you right before the
[1:12:00] foundation of the world
[1:12:03] that even if the enemy tries to block
[1:12:05] you on the way
[1:12:08] my heart tells me that this is not my
[1:12:11] place I Repent I go forward
[1:12:17] until God do baptist
[1:12:21] will baptize you and sail you with the
[1:12:23] Holy Ghost
[1:12:24] and that's what I'm says
[1:12:28] that when Paul preached to the Ephesians
[1:12:33] when Paul began to preach the
[1:12:35] predestination
[1:12:37] and he said it's not for Sinners
[1:12:41] it's not for unbelievers
[1:12:45] it's not for those that cannot believe
[1:12:47] this message
[1:12:49] is something but it's for those that are
[1:12:52] in Christ
[1:12:54] and it's those that are sure of the
[1:12:57] elections
[1:13:01] you to realize yet you're still on the
[1:13:02] other side
[1:13:03] that you're still a sinner
[1:13:06] Grace is still flowing
[1:13:09] when they talk to you about
[1:13:11] predestination
[1:13:13] don't just say it's me
[1:13:16] and then the next day your nature your
[1:13:21] life
[1:13:22] it just doesn't come to meet the world
[1:13:25] because
[1:13:36] we first have to reject the word
[1:13:41] it means the word will come first into
[1:13:43] our heart
[1:13:46] and then we forget
[1:13:48] that we are elected that we are sons of
[1:13:52] God
[1:13:53] we're going to behave
[1:13:55] like something like a contrary
[1:13:59] but God wants
[1:14:03] that we may be assured
[1:14:05] of who we are this is
[1:14:09] of what God has called us to be
[1:14:17] when I was thinking about justification
[1:14:21] something happened something came came
[1:14:24] to my heart
[1:14:28] my little sister to me for my sisters
[1:14:30] may forgive me
[1:14:32] foreign
[1:14:56] God shows that
[1:14:59] God has given to a woman a circuit
[1:15:02] virtue
[1:15:04] says that
[1:15:06] paragraph 76 if you could put it up
[1:15:09] you did a family
[1:15:14] it says a woman was not even in the
[1:15:17] beginning of the creation
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:20] because God knew that she was gonna she
[1:15:23] would fall
[1:15:27] all other females could not commit
[1:15:29] adultery
[1:15:32] she's the only one that could commit
[1:15:34] adultery
[1:15:37] if she had been made like like the the
[1:15:40] original
[1:15:43] that would have been this com this this
[1:15:47] complementary to God's great wisdom
[1:15:53] she was made a byproduct of a man
[1:15:58] [Music]
[1:15:59] but because she was cast over in that
[1:16:03] side
[1:16:08] she has also received she also be given
[1:16:11] a sacred charge from God for Redemption
[1:16:18] she's got characters that she may she
[1:16:22] must not defile see
[1:16:24] if she would murder them
[1:16:28] she's defiled for for a lifetime
[1:16:34] no matter how much she's forgiven
[1:16:39] she can't be justified
[1:16:48] got a scripture on that in few minutes
[1:16:51] in a few minutes
[1:16:54] she can be forgiven for that defilement
[1:17:02] but she cannot be justified in this life
[1:17:07] it's always with her
[1:17:09] notice now
[1:17:12] she's been given this
[1:17:15] she may be forgiven
[1:17:18] but not justified
[1:17:21] it's to say that our young sisters
[1:17:25] that may God give you Grace
[1:17:29] to get you to keep the circuit virtue
[1:17:34] but we because we see that God forgives
[1:17:37] us of all things
[1:17:39] and he justifies us
[1:17:44] when it comes to this sacred charge that
[1:17:47] is given God will forgive you
[1:17:51] it has nothing to do with your salvation
[1:17:54] you are a daughter of God
[1:17:58] but God keeps studying your fire
[1:18:05] that God may help us
[1:18:08] with a current condition of the world
[1:18:13] that God may help us uh keep our young
[1:18:16] sisters our young sisters
[1:18:22] to walk in the fear of God
[1:18:26] the message of the end time
[1:18:29] God sent us a wonderful message
[1:18:34] that the messenger of the end time
[1:18:38] he has two things
[1:18:41] the first thing
[1:18:44] according to Malachi chapter four
[1:18:48] is to bring us right back into the faith
[1:18:51] of the Apostles
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:55] to bring us right back into the worship
[1:18:57] of the Apostles
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:00] to bring us right back into the
[1:19:03] preaching of the Apostles
[1:19:05] to bring us right back into the faith of
[1:19:08] the Apostles
[1:19:12] where we can have the home and if the
[1:19:15] full manifestation of our god of God
[1:19:20] where we can have the manifestations of
[1:19:23] God in our own lives
[1:19:27] and that gives us faith
[1:19:31] that we may receive all that we have
[1:19:34] need of
[1:19:36] yes
[1:19:38] end time messenger
[1:19:41] apocalypse according to uh Revelation 10
[1:19:45] 7
[1:19:47] and was to take all the Hidden Mysteries
[1:19:51] and to reveal them to us
[1:19:55] the revealing of those Mysteries
[1:19:59] the revealing of that word
[1:20:01] will help us
[1:20:06] to get into the complete Plan of
[1:20:09] Redemption of God
[1:20:10] will help us
[1:20:12] to know
[1:20:15] [Music]
[1:20:17] that one day the gravity will not be
[1:20:21] able to hold us anymore
[1:20:24] and it's in the revealing of the word
[1:20:26] that says
[1:20:29] that is the rapturing faith in it
[1:20:33] that oh if the denomination
[1:20:36] they can take a part of the word
[1:20:41] they can have faith to move mountains
[1:20:44] God can give them that
[1:20:47] but when it comes to rapturing Faith
[1:20:52] they have to come into the complete
[1:20:55] revelation of the word
[1:21:01] and that's where the rapturing faith is
[1:21:05] because they sent a message
[1:21:08] has been sent to us
[1:21:10] it's for our transformation
[1:21:13] that one day do not records for me all
[1:21:18] our being may be transformed
[1:21:23] that we may go to the meeting of the
[1:21:25] Lord in the air
[1:21:28] that's why this message was sent to us
[1:21:31] and this message
[1:21:37] the evening messenger
[1:21:50] a paragraph
[1:21:52] 189. you didn't lose it says here we are
[1:21:57] in the end time
[1:21:58] red light down flashing
[1:22:03] coming of the Lord is at hand we miss
[1:22:06] you yes sir listen
[1:22:09] um
[1:22:12] the end time message should meet the end
[1:22:15] time conditions
[1:22:17] it says wait they've gotten off
[1:22:21] the message ought to bring them bring it
[1:22:24] right back
[1:22:29] always the end time message meets the
[1:22:32] end time conditions
[1:22:35] all the way throughout the Scriptures
[1:22:39] it will have to do with this time
[1:22:43] a call back to the original word
[1:22:48] like the other messenger did it in the
[1:22:51] day so massage
[1:22:53] this message will have to be the same
[1:22:57] we are promised for me we are promised
[1:23:04] God promised it in his word in malachite
[1:23:07] 4.
[1:23:09] they said it would happen
[1:23:13] a restored faith of the children back to
[1:23:16] the father
[1:23:17] promise it
[1:23:19] and we are living in that day
[1:23:23] oh it's been always
[1:23:26] each time
[1:23:31] a group of leaders that gets people are
[1:23:33] all mixed up
[1:23:36] it's not so much to people
[1:23:41] it's the leaders that get them mixed up
[1:23:44] now you say let's say
[1:23:49] now just a minute
[1:23:52] we got to make this scriptural see
[1:23:57] if it isn't scriptural then it's not
[1:24:01] good
[1:24:03] by the words of wisdom the Lord
[1:24:06] in the uninspired leadership
[1:24:11] words of worldly wisdom
[1:24:15] says
[1:24:17] it says in some of these great genius
[1:24:20] can set that together
[1:24:33] you'll see two yeah
[1:24:42] well approach uh did he not well
[1:24:45] approach Jesus and give him a reason
[1:24:48] and even quoted him the scripture to him
[1:24:52] he did it
[1:24:54] he's a genius
[1:24:58] Jesus never argued with him he said he
[1:25:02] led to see it's written also get behind
[1:25:06] me Satan we you know
[1:25:08] yes an uninspired leadership
[1:25:13] God has given us all the message
[1:25:16] but sometimes
[1:25:18] we take just a part of a part of the
[1:25:21] message
[1:25:22] oh just the side of the message
[1:25:25] and we hang on to it
[1:25:29] we treat the others on the other side oh
[1:25:32] they don't they don't have inspirations
[1:25:36] God wants us to abide it to remain in
[1:25:39] the message
[1:25:41] what is
[1:25:43] he said behold thou send you Elijah the
[1:25:46] prophet
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:49] gave us all the advice of God
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:25:55] that we may be assured
[1:25:58] that before the foundation of the world
[1:26:00] he knew us
[1:26:03] he predestinated us
[1:26:07] and this message is sended it's for you
[1:26:11] that if you were not here
[1:26:15] God was not going to send this message
[1:26:21] when we read the message
[1:26:27] like as we were in the office Brother
[1:26:29] David was telling us
[1:26:32] that he wants to be positive with this
[1:26:34] message
[1:26:40] that this message was sent for me
[1:26:46] God said something hard in this message
[1:26:49] in my regard I'll say Amen
[1:26:53] that may God say something that
[1:26:55] encourages me I'll say amen and I'll go
[1:27:00] forward
[1:27:03] and that's what this message is calling
[1:27:06] us to
[1:27:10] the flashlight
[1:27:13] denominations
[1:27:16] this message will not become a religious
[1:27:19] form
[1:27:21] at
[1:27:23] because God is working with us in
[1:27:26] individual manner
[1:27:31] each one of us knows what experience
[1:27:34] they have with God
[1:27:44] knows what expression he can express
[1:27:46] toward God system not a system
[1:27:51] I cannot tell birdability
[1:27:54] like look at how you should worship God
[1:27:58] that if you don't worship like me then
[1:28:01] you are on the side
[1:28:05] but according to the inspiration that he
[1:28:08] has foreign
[1:28:11] [Music]
[1:28:42] okay
[1:28:48] and
[1:28:51] when the Builder laid the foundation of
[1:28:54] the Temple of the Lord they set the
[1:28:58] priest in the uh apparel with trumpets
[1:29:02] and with
[1:29:03] um with the levite the sons of ASAP
[1:29:08] with uh symbols to praise the Lord after
[1:29:12] the after after the ordinance of David
[1:29:14] the king of Israel and they sang
[1:29:17] together
[1:29:19] and they sang together
[1:29:23] by course in praise and giving thanks
[1:29:27] unto the Lord because he is good for his
[1:29:30] mercy endureth forever towards Israel
[1:29:33] and all the people shouted with a great
[1:29:36] shout when when they praised the Lord
[1:29:39] because the foundation of the house of
[1:29:42] the Lord was laid
[1:29:44] it says but many of the priests and the
[1:29:48] Levites and the chief and the chiefs of
[1:29:50] the fathers who were ancient men that
[1:29:54] had seen the first house when the
[1:29:56] foundation of this house was laid Before
[1:29:59] Their Eyes wept with a loud voice and
[1:30:02] many shouted aloud for Joy so that the
[1:30:05] people could not could not discern the
[1:30:09] noise of the of of the shout of Joy from
[1:30:13] the noise of the shout of the Weeping of
[1:30:15] the people for the people shouted with
[1:30:18] the war with a loud voice and the noise
[1:30:20] was a was it was heard afar off
[1:30:25] you will notice that when the foundation
[1:30:28] was laid
[1:30:31] there was two contracts uh contrasted
[1:30:34] reactions
[1:30:37] it was based on the experience that each
[1:30:40] one had
[1:30:42] the Bible says that the the ancient or
[1:30:45] the older people
[1:30:46] the cried
[1:30:49] they cried Legend the the whipped and
[1:30:53] they were young they were they were
[1:30:55] shouting for Joy
[1:30:57] no one told them
[1:30:59] that you all have to whip oh you all
[1:31:03] have to shout
[1:31:07] according to what God had done for them
[1:31:11] they had a reaction to it
[1:31:15] to Worship the Lord
[1:31:18] to glorify the Lord
[1:31:23] this message of the end time
[1:31:30] something precious
[1:31:32] that God help us
[1:31:35] as a musician will come
[1:31:39] to realize that Rapture is at hand
[1:31:43] the Bible tells us in first
[1:31:45] Thessalonians chapter 4.
[1:31:59] that are leaving
[1:32:05] who are alive until the coming of the
[1:32:07] Lord
[1:32:11] will be changed will all be changed
[1:32:14] but in order for us to be changed
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:19] we have to stay with a message
[1:32:25] we have to keep the message
[1:32:29] we have to work with a message
[1:32:33] because it's the only thing
[1:32:37] that will bring us to that
[1:32:39] transformation
[1:32:41] and the Bible says
[1:32:46] it says Comfort yourself one another
[1:32:49] with these things
[1:32:54] if there's a word of consolation that we
[1:32:57] can pronounce tonight
[1:32:59] is to say my brother the Lord is coming
[1:33:02] Jesus is coming soon
[1:33:05] but you and I will be changed
[1:33:09] you and I will be changed
[1:33:12] we'll go to the meaning of the Lord
[1:33:18] that in Christ will resurrect first
[1:33:22] and all together we'll go together
[1:33:26] to the meeting of the through the
[1:33:28] meeting of the Lord in the air
[1:33:30] that's the word of consolation
[1:33:33] that this message is brought to us
[1:33:36] let's pray
[1:33:41] god of loveth
[1:33:44] yeah
[1:33:48] certainly this word were put together
[1:33:50] perhaps not well enough
[1:33:56] but you know what you have put in my
[1:33:58] heart
[1:34:00] this message
[1:34:03] that he may attract us even more
[1:34:07] conditions when I realized the condition
[1:34:10] of the world
[1:34:12] I pray oh God
[1:34:15] may you be merciful to us
[1:34:21] I commit to young people

[1:34:31] because you said it through your prophet
[1:34:35] may you help them oh Lord I have to
[1:34:38] positive to be positive
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:43] to know that you didn't bring them into
[1:34:45] this message for nothing
[1:34:49] it's because you you have known them
[1:34:52] since the foundation of the world
[1:34:56] it's because you elected them since the
[1:34:58] foundation of the world
[1:35:01] that you bring them into this message
[1:35:06] that you want to expose them to the son
[1:35:10] of this message
[1:35:12] that they may come to the maturity
[1:35:15] my prayer oh Lord
[1:35:19] like you pronounce it through Jesus
[1:35:23] and it said it's not for that I'll take
[1:35:26] you out of this world
[1:35:29] but it's to protect us from this world

[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:53] amen
[1:39:55] you know
[1:39:56] the privilege of hearing this message is
[1:39:59] so wonderful
[1:40:01] I was sharing with the brothers this
[1:40:03] afternoon that some of the young men
[1:40:05] came over and
[1:40:08] they said let's
[1:40:10] look at this book the seed is not here
[1:40:13] with the shuck
[1:40:15] and
[1:40:17] we got to talking about the church
[1:40:19] natural
[1:40:21] and he said there's a church spiritual
[1:40:24] and there's a church natural
[1:40:26] I said now you think about
[1:40:29] all the other churches
[1:40:32] that are all around
[1:40:35] all they could do was look back
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:39] at the writings
[1:40:41] of Peter
[1:40:43] and Paul
[1:40:45] and it recorded Epistles
[1:40:48] from Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:40:52] and and all they did is they they looked
[1:40:54] back and they read them and each man
[1:40:57] came up with his own idea
[1:40:59] each person came up with his own
[1:41:02] conclusion and then they took it and
[1:41:05] they they built a way of worship upon it
[1:41:10] and then somebody went and they took
[1:41:12] something else and something else but
[1:41:14] they were always looking back and that's
[1:41:16] why it became a carnal Church
[1:41:19] because it was all built on the things
[1:41:23] that man read because there was no
[1:41:26] allotted word
[1:41:28] all they had was the word that was
[1:41:30] allotted then and they did the best they
[1:41:33] could with it
[1:41:36] they they built
[1:41:38] denominations and interpretations all
[1:41:41] with pure hearts
[1:41:43] but God elected to a lot in the word for
[1:41:47] this day
[1:41:49] a new word a fresh word a Living Word
[1:41:54] that would take all the Mysteries and
[1:41:57] all the things that were written all the
[1:42:00] things that were misunderstood
[1:42:04] and bring them to an elect people
[1:42:07] an allotted word the prophet of God said
[1:42:10] you know why there was no Prophet from
[1:42:12] the time of of Malachi to the time of
[1:42:16] John he said because there was no
[1:42:18] allotted word you know why there was no
[1:42:21] Prophet from the time of Jesus to this
[1:42:24] time because there was no allotted word
[1:42:26] but now God had a fresh allotted word to
[1:42:31] give to an elected chosen people and he
[1:42:35] brought it in the form of a message
[1:42:38] because the word can only come to a
[1:42:42] prophet you've received fresh man that's
[1:42:45] what this message is is the allotted
[1:42:48] word for our time and that's why our
[1:42:51] brothers saying you've got to stay with
[1:42:53] it you've got to understand this is a
[1:42:56] different people
[1:42:58] this is a different Covenant
[1:43:01] this is a different time you are not
[1:43:04] living under the Covenant of the church
[1:43:07] ages you're living under the Covenant of
[1:43:09] predestination and election all what a
[1:43:14] message brother
[1:43:15] praise the Lord I appreciate it stay
[1:43:18] with the message amen that's why he
[1:43:21] throws that book
[1:43:24] buries it I like what the prophet said
[1:43:27] right at the end of the tape he said
[1:43:28] don't dig it up
[1:43:30] foreign
[1:43:32] you've been called to follow this
[1:43:34] message leave those things which are
[1:43:36] behind behind and press for the higher
[1:43:39] calling amen forget the mistakes leave
[1:43:43] yesterday yesterday's over you got fresh
[1:43:46] food amen if you're being starved out
[1:43:49] all your life you're just skinny you

[1:45:14] it so beautiful those are the ancients
