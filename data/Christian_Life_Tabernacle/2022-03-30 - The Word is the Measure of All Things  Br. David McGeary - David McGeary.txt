chapter and the 35th verse just your short scripture reading but we just trust that the lord will bless it i i come back i was out a few days with my mother and she's just really doing wonderful and still walking around the block anyway uh many of you may have known that my my sister is going through some medical situations so my mom's been left alone so leslie's gonna be out there with her for a few weeks so i would you keep her in prayer amen so let's just uh read the 35th verse it said heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away heavenly father we ask you to bless us this evening in your precious and holy name we pray amen amen bless you may be seated tonight am i not on i can hear me better okay i'd like to just take a thought tonight this thought came to me and of course we we've been studying the book of uh it is the rising of the sun but as i was going along this certain message stood out to me and especially what's with what's going on everywhere in the world you know i i sit back and i marvel at the things oh mike and ellen's here god bless you thank you there my good to see you i i marvel at the the things that are being spoken and the things that are being said and and hearing them talk about at my mom's house i had an opportunity to watch the news and they showed the filming of all these empty store houses and they were talking about food shortages you know and the possibility of uh with this war that's going on a famine and i thought they don't realize that they're already in a famine that's right so it struck my heart hearing some of the things that they spoke and some of the things that they said i uh this thought come in my heart i'd like to just share with you for a few moments this evening it's called the word is the measure of all things the word is the measure of all things and usually something has to rise to a certain occasion or to a certain level before you use it as a measurement for example in the in the athletic field they they have a man that used to hit a lot of home runs and his name was babe ruth and no matter how many home runs anybody ever hit babe ruth is the measure of home runs because of how many he hit and how many times that he did it so anytime anybody would look at something to measure something by they would say well such and such hit so many home runs but they'd say but he didn't do it in the same time frame someone say he did this but he didn't do it you know the measure of how many games a person can play for a long time it was somebody called ty cobbs but then cal ripken did it now he's the measure every player that comes along they measure how many games are they're going to play so something becomes a measuring stick because it's risen to the occasion and allowed us to see what could be done what could be done what is what's the measure what could be done every sport has uh has the person that they uh that they measured everything by and and and sometimes we come along in those measurements uh fall into disgrace certain person does a certain thing i remember there was a uh a bicycle rider and he did more runs and did everything faster then they found found out that he was under the influence of a drug and therefore his measuring was tainted so you couldn't use him as a measuring because it it wasn't pure so it just declined to lay it out this evening because i just want this to be kind of words of comfort to us this evening is what that we're measuring things by okay we are not measuring current events and that's the title of this message modern events are made clear by prophecy so our measure of what's going on isn't measured by any other thing other than the word of god the word of god is what becomes the measure of all things and the determination of all things and when we can uh rest in that and have an understanding and i like the way that uh our our messenger introduced this and it it's important when we begin to understand that the word of god is prophecy it says for i'd like and he's talking about here as he starts this scripture and i warned you the scripture heaven and earth will pass away so if you're going to have something that you measure something by it can't be measured by something that's constantly changing okay so heaven and earth will pass away but my word won't pass away so if something remains under any circumstance any condition any situation then that's got to be what you measure it by because it is the firm constant and he's saying everything else you see it changes well how would you like to go back when christopher columbus was the mode of transportation i would hate that to be the thing i would have had to have gone seen my mother on horseback i'd still be in midland odessa i mean you you you know and and so you it's it's got to be something if you're going to measure it by if you're going to look out today on all the events and everything that's transpiring you're going to have to be able to look out and what are you measuring it by you understand what what is it that you're seeing and what is it that that's influencing you because there's nothing uncertain in god's word the only thing that is certain is god's word in fact we were admonished to be certain of god no matter what the circumstances is no matter how it appears around us no matter what our senses tell us or what our emotions tell us we can be anchored in the fact that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away so we're talking this evening about putting on the binoculars of god's word and bringing the situation that the world's in and bringing it into focus and when we do that in the midst of great trial our heart leaps for joy so he he makes this statement he said the story is based on when he jesus was walking on the roads to emmaus and they asked him he says are you but a stranger here don't you know of all that's happened and and and how the the young prophet of galilee how they took them from us and they crucified them and they buried them and we thought this was the one we thought this was going to be our nation and and we were going to come forth and and it was going to be a great thing see they they were looking at the conditions they were looking at the political climate they were looking at the economical climate they were looking at everything around them but they failed to measure it by the word of god and that's what he rebuked them for he said oh slow and hard you know to believe all that the prophets have spoken and i look at myself and i think why i'm sometimes we get slow to really believe what is happening there's something happening there's something moving there's something going on and we want to make sure that we're measuring all that's transpiring as fast as it's transpiring that we're measuring it by the word of god because it's the measure of all things the word is the measure of all things so he he makes this statement he said he said now i'd like to take the subject i'd like to take this the events modern events i made clear by prophecy and it's always been god's unchanging it's always been the unchanging god's way to let his people fore know before certain events happen so prophecy you know you found that that's good that was paragraph 17 i believe so it always it's god's way so that's god's way prophecy is god's way of letting you know or or a foretelling you or letting his people fore know be between certain events happen now don't miss that word certain it isn't like certain things it's events that are certain see they're certain if they're prophesied what's going to happen when god says anything it's going to come to pass if god speaks it it's going to come to pass if he prophesies it's going to come to pass and that's what he told them he said hey guys what happened was what the prophets said would happen and you weren't looking you weren't looking through the eyes of prophecy or in other words you weren't looking through the measuring of god's word if they would have sat back and measured the events by god's word if they would have taken them through god's word they would have seen that everything was perfect right in order and on time so okay we we see that that's that's what's that's the way god does it so again and we look at that because here we are in the lady osean church age now i know when i came into the message i always was thinking that i would be out of here before it got this bad but it's it's beyond reach can you imagine that what we see on the surface and i'm not trying to stimulate your imagination in any way but i don't want to speak about things that the scripture said that are are in darkness and shouldn't even be spoken of but if we can see this condition on the outside what do you think is happening in the hearts and man's hearts and minds of men because the scripture said that they they choose not to retain god in their mind in their thinking and god's given them over to a reprobate mind and and it's terrible even in this message he talked about when the church came under persecution and before the seed went into the ground we'll get into that he said that the soldiers would take uh expecting mothers and and bet on what what the uh the whether it was a boy or a girl boy they'd have a hard time betting nowadays wouldn't they and that that's how cruel and wicked people get remember people the the world will get into such a condition and into such self-righteousness having no regard for god at all the scripture said that they would kill you thinking that they were doing god a service could you imagine if the nominal world today thought it would be best for christianity if they purged this thing in their midst that calls themselves the bride but if we look at it through god's word and so we we look at it through the scriptures so i'm talking about us now coming into an understanding of why our world has got to where it's at why there's everybody's so divided because there's only one thing that unites and that's the love of god and the word of god should have brought in your heart by the holy spirit brother branham said it would let make silk and burlap hug one another you know so uh it's we're talking about taking a moment and looking at what's going on out here and all the craziness that's going on and just pull back for a moment and and let's get us back on measuring it by the word in other words measuring it by prophecy and so if you since you're putting paragraphs up there he said and so just like those disciples they missed what god was doing and he says that's going to repeat today so in paragraph 19 he makes this statement he says do you realize that that's promised again in this very age that we're living the lady of sea and age now so what's promised in this age that the word would not become the measuring that events would not be looked at through prophecy and there's the only way you can make any sense out of what's transpiring if you look at it through prophecy if you don't look at it through prophecy you're going to have one political battle you're going to be siding with this group you're going to be siding with this group you're going to be taking this view you're going to be taking that view and all of a sudden you're off into a whole nother realm you've got all kinds of anger you've got all kinds of bitter uh spirits going on you know what i mean you hate people just because somebody told you to hate him you know the prophet god said catholics were some of the nicest people and defended him more than anybody else no we don't judge by anything other than what the word of god so he says now he said the lady of seeing age this seventh church age that we're in now is naked miserable blind and don't know it now just follow this for a moment the same as he blinded them back there for the purpose of getting his message through to the elect people in other words lady the hope it's a prophesied condition you understand lady osea is a prophesied condition if you if we could if you could ever get the world or any people to stand back and look exactly what was prophesied for this day we would sit back and say this is exactly according to the word of god and it makes sense if you measure it by god's word if you don't make look at it through god's word you're confused you're tired you're weary you're sick you don't have any joy you're saying oh i want out of here i don't want to be a part of this anymore instead of saying bring it on even so come quickly lord jesus because you you see that it is perfectly on track it's prophesied the condition was prophesied in order for for the purpose of getting the message through to the elect because the elect has a quality about him that's right the elect has the ability to measure things by god's word not by what's on the surface not back how slick it is or how good it looks or how it tastes smells feels or none of those things it has a sixth sense on the inside it's got a built-in antenna something that's able to receive the word of god so they've got a built-in measuring stick but we can't set that measuring stick aside we've got to understand i've got to walk each day look out each day at the unchanging events because god forewarned me that they would be here he prophesied that ladies would be here when we read it we didn't know how blind miserable or wretched they could get now that took me by surprise but the fact that it's the way that it is should have never taken me by surprise because the word of god told me that they would not retain god in their knowledge and they would be given over to a reprobate mind you can't help it even in your own experiences how many people have you seen you've shared the message with they've walked in the message for a season and the minute they come they leave the message they leave everything i mean if they used to their lips they used to say it's an abomination for a woman to cut their hair a was an abomination for a a a a woman to pay put on a a garment pertaining to a man they would refer to jezebel's being the only one that paint their face they'd quote peter about being ordained all these things and instantly when they no longer want to view the events through prophecy those events no longer become wrong okay so when once you leave that leadership you understand the divine inspiration leadership that god's given us to to increase our understanding that that that our understand would increase the minute that you leave that and you walk away from that now you start to view things in a different light in a different context and they're no longer measured by the word of god people that have done those things quit measuring it by the prophesied word and they begin to measure it by the sweet spirit jesus died for the world but the world's not going to heaven right because i came for my own just think they they no longer see they they they left looking at the lady osean age looking at the sodom condition looking at everything that was prophesied even to the point that they rejected the the message and the word that was prophesied so no longer they lost their measuring stick their lives were no longer measured by the word oh god don't care if you do this god don't care if you do that it doesn't matter to god well why would god even put it in the book he put it there william branham didn't put it there but you if we if we don't stay steadfast on those things then we begin to see so the whole purpose of everything so understand this this is a prophesied condition and and the reason it's a prophesied condition because the the purpose of it was to get the the message out and that's what he said here in the 24th uh quote i could just read it but they can put it up so quick nowadays now we want to be posted to know what's to take place for this age that we're living in so we want to know we want to be posted what's to take place in the age that we're living in right so i want to know what's supposed to take place not only around me but in me not only what what the events are out there i don't want to be posted because i've already been told that he let the condition come in order to get the message to me so i want to be posted because the message that he's going to get to me is is going to have an effect on me personally and what is going on around me has a purpose so he said if you don't understand it he said what good would it do he said like if if moses took noah's message so he walks into egypt and says hey i know how we're going to get out of here let's build boats and float down the nile it wouldn't have worked you you understand so a part of measuring it by the word is not only to measure what's out here by the word but then to look at us and to be able to measure our condition and and where we stand and what we possess by the same measuring stick so he goes on he says here he said so you know whenever luther couldn't uh you know stay with the catholics what good would it have done luther to stay with the catholics he would have never grown he'd never come out he'd never understood justification or what good would have done wesley to stay with the lutherans it wouldn't have done any good ok what good would it have done pentecost to stay uh with the methodist right see it wouldn't work so you you we've got to be um moving forward with god's word and so he comes down he says what good will it do what good will it do pentecost to continue on when the bride's being called what good would it do to continue on in pentecost when the bride's being called now we've got to take this calling very dear to our hearts a very deep revelation and understanding that you're being called out of something up into something that the battle no longer is you just trying to to to bring this flesh under subjection and be in this constant warfare with the flesh but we as we've been preaching but that god's got a quickening power that's going to quicken something but now it's not pentecost power it's not always you need the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost you've got to have the baptism and holy ghost without the baptism of the holy ghost you better understand exactly what the holy ghost is the holy ghost didn't even come to speak of itself but to bring you into what remembrance of all things that were spoken see what what they were rejecting is what they always rejected they always rejected the word so he goes on to say he says what good would it do if pentecost to continue on when the bride's being called now listen see we're right up into the seed time so this is this is a this is a seed time we've come out of the pentecost he says what good does it do you to remain in pentecost well i've had gifts restored i lay my hands on the sick i've got signs and wonders he said it won't do you any good to stay there because this is seed time now we're viewing this through the word of god we're measuring it by the word of god we're not measuring it by noah's message we're measuring it by the word of god and the word of god says it's seed time welcome so it's a i guess the best way is just read paragraph 31 it kind of helps explain it he says so before we hit that 31 we understand that the scripture is only understood by inspiration amen the scribes the pharisees all them were reading the same book and jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are rich that speak of me so he said if you would measure my life by the word you would find out that i fulfilled every jot every tittle every line every verse but you failed to move up into what god's doing because there was an exodus and so it takes that inspiration so we understand the reason that we're work we're talking and we're talking about measuring because if we sit back and we measure it by the word of god we're not looking for expectation of days gone by we're not looking for a blessing of old we're not looking for an anointing we're not looking of anything that compares ourselves one with another we're into now an understanding that i'm going to measure everything even my my life by not how i feel or not by what works i've done because he said man you'll come to my day and say lord lord i never use but now it's going to be measured i am now going to measure myself by the revealed word of god for the hour that's how i measure myself up it doesn't matter it's a good church are you all they baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost they do all they but they're good people they're loving people that's good now if i measure that by the word of god i look at myself said i don't fellowship with him but i can't go in there and eat food that sacrifice to idols especially when i know the title written on their door is blasphemous names see now you're not measuring it by your feeling you're not measuring it by your own measure of christianity you're not measuring it by the personality let me tell you satan's got the best personality but you're measuring sticks the word what did the word said he would be an angel of light i'm going to bring you freedom from all the way you have to dress i'm going to bring you freedom and liberty you're now going to be free and liberated in christ you're going to have love for everybody that ain't love that woman said oh i love that preacher and that woman was running around he said oh but he's such a good man he loves him and i love him so much they're such love he said it's not love if it's not the word amen that's the measuring stick it's not love us if it's not the word no satan's appearing as an angel of light but what he's trying to do is change your measuring step what did he get eve change the measuring stick eve surely he said surely he won't die don't measure it by that measure by what you'll become and how you'll have the wisdom between god and evil and how that you have knowledge and to understand all things wrong measurement it's hard especially when the world's accusing you of not being open-minded well i want you to know i am not open-minded i don't care about the government i don't care about their laws i'm not afraid of the irs i'm not afraid of that i'm not afraid if i get every dollar bill and everything in the right place and all that i'm not afraid of those things because if god don't watch the city the watchman watches in vain anyway you know okay you can't you just can't do things anymore without them you look at it through one set of eyes it's impossible you look at it through the word which is the measuring stick all things are possible all things are possible that's what the word of god says and it just you've got to have a place that you're measuring it by that you're influencing it by that it's saying and without faith it's impossible to please god so it's got to it that's got to be the measuring stick so the measuring stick has got to be the word that's inspired to you let's take verse 1 uh 30 and he is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he is the word so putin is not controlling it our president's not controlling it we know who controls the world powers principality and spiritual wickedness in high places right now let's measure it by the word of god nothing can separate us from the love of god that is christ jesus no sickness no death no peril no sword or nothing all that the father had given me will come see if he's the the thing that all this he's trying to do is discredit the word of god and separate us from our measuring stick he said now he said therefore paragraph 31 therefore we're living in the day when the manifestation of the word of god has come to a different age in other words there's a different manifestation of the word than pentecost this word is going to be manifested a different way now understand what the one blessing was the one blessing was from the outside down right it was an anointing and therefore the wheat rejoiced in it and the other grain weeds rejoiced in it it was gone it was coming from the outside working in this is a different dispensation he says it this way he says he says the word of god manifests in a different age than the pentecostal age it's manifested in a different age than the pentecostal way it's manifested in a different way than it was manifested in pentecost therefore there's only one way we can measure it we can't measure it by blessings that have gone by right we can only measure it by what it time it is and what time is this this is seed time that's how we measure it it's seed time i'll close up because it's starting to get so good so it's a different manifestation it's not from the outside in see that's that's the way it was it was from the outside in they received a blessing they received an anointing they received the leadership that led them and guide them but this was beyond that this age this is seed time this is god's working from the inside out because there's something in there right there's a seed in there this is the time of the seed never was a time of the seed before you know what pentecost was it's what protected the seed that's all it was it was a protection of the seed but the minute that seed started to get germinated it pulled away it went denominated it pulled away all the blessings and all the anointings and all those things was to keep you right there until you could be germinated by the pure unadulterated word of god that's where it grows from it grows from the inside out it doesn't measure it anymore by what's transparent what's transpiring on the outside it measures it by what's transpiring on the inside in other words god's enlightening me he's giving me revelation he's given me isab that i can see he's given me gold tried in fire character he's giving me white raymond i'm supping with him it's it's a seed time this is the time we're in it's in the time of the personal germination the word of god is uh i i probably bit off more than i can choose so uh but anyway he says he says the bible is a different book the bible is not like any other book it's a different book in other words it's god's thoughts expressed it's god in word form in other words god's doing what he's doing and he's doing it how many we all thought remember when rory brown talked about russia and russia and i just sit back i'd shrink back and think oh my goodness it's not even called russia it's the soviet union what's he talking about i know none of you are old enough to remember that i mean i believed it but it just embarrassed me you know when i first came in i didn't have a revelation of the son of man i had a revelation of malachi 4 5 but when he talked about those two messengers going down to some sodom one being billy graham and one being over office i thought you know this mess would be a whole lot easier if he left it out but it was in there yes sir you you understand because a seed the word of god's a seed jesus described it as as a seed because that that's what it is it's it's a seed and and because it's a seed if he said he said now the bible's a different book from any other sacred book that's 46. there's no book like the bible because the bible is god in word form a word is a thought expressed god's thinking expressed it his words through the prophets that they wrote the bible which was in word form jesus called it a seed and any seed will bring forth in of its kind if it's in the right condition and the right atmosphere now let me tell you something about this wicked evil world it will produce real christians you've got to be a real christian to live according to this word you can have tons of anointing on you but it's not anointing time it's seed time remember the three circles and then that down inside one had a little snake and the other had a seed and it took the the only thing that they they would know it is because that seed was terminated how many of you look at yourself you're a wreck you don't like what you see in the mirror you want to change but there's that seed inside of you that you're trapped as matthew says it's a setup because he's not working from the outside in he's working from the inside out he's moving you he's changing he's calling you he says so that's why we're where we're at it takes this condition for the elect to be called out the church world teaches you how to cope with it they explain it the worse it gets the more good works they try to do now i believe in works don't get me wrong just like i believe in shouting i believe in being blessed i believe in being anointed i'm all good with that but it ain't the evidence of anything it don't mean you got it you know what it means you've got it this thing in here keeps going back to the word going back to the word and when you're not doing right this thing in here haunts you like a hound dog he said he said so it's a seed in the right condition it'll come first it's got to come according to the word if it comes from god paragraph 48 because it's to vindicate or to prove god's presence how do i know god's with me because everything he's prophesied is coming to pass that's exactly right i see it i recognize it i'm measuring it by the word it's beautiful it's hallelujah it's not woe's me it's praise god hallelujah amen if he said and he foreknew all these things by his foreknowledge he ordained and foreign it's called in the bible predestinated ordained foreordained it called predestinat predestinated every age to its place every man to its place every messenger to its place he's god the devil ain't pulling nothing over on him and he's god and he has ordained everything to take place and falls just exactly in line with his word peace like a river glory to god lord i never thought it would be this way i never thought it would get so dark you said perilous times would come i didn't think they would be this perilous but it was ordained it was ordained because the condition has got to be ordained in order for the seed to come to life and i think that's where a lot of us missed it we had to get it mentally first before it could drop into our heart and then start coming to life and growing in into life so it it's it it it's everything is perfect according what god intended to accomplish he intended to have a bride he intended to prove her he intended for the world to be the most wicked delightful pleasurable sin he elected to tempt you and to try you and to prove you everything's exactly get drawn away and then get out there like the prodigal son and just can't stand it and just got to make your way back you come back and you know it's god because you come back right in the same place i'd just rather be a servant in your house father i'm not worthy to be called your son here let me work in the field i'll just be happy just to be on your property a seed time kill the fatted calf get the road my son which is lost has returned amen this is seed time it's a glorious time it's a wonderful time so the the word is the measure of all things fox news is not the measurement of current events or is c b n and and m s n b c or whatever there are it's not the measure the measure for us is wow the word of god is coming to pass the word of god's coming to pass and i'm coming to pass the condition is going to produce the bride the condition produced the message to produce the bride behold before the great and dreadful day of the lord i'll send you elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers if it's not movements it's not politics you see but you see the promised word the purpose condition all the things are viewed through the word so when they say food shortage how many knows they've been actually talking about food charges fuel shortages world war three oh i kind of i sit back and i think you know what i don't know there may not be enough food but i've always had a model as a christian where there's any there's plenty and i'll not suffer my righteous to beg bread amen i just got to do things through god's word i've got to put the blinders on i got to turn off the voices and i've got to look at it else not we're no different than anybody else we're walking down the road saying do you see the whole world's falling apart and such and such and i don't know such-and-such you know and and and you know no i hate to inform everybody but donald trump might be a bigger devil than the devil we got i'm just honest with you there's no political party that's going to save this boat there's no movement there's no college there's no there's no unity i don't know i heard the other day one of the movie stars went up and slapped another movie star place has gone crazy looney tunes was something we used to watch on on saturday morning you know with this loony out here but isn't it exactly what he said oh rejoice as you see the day coming look up for your rejection draws nigh amen rejoice as you see the day coming the fulfillment of god's word let's measure it by god's word let's measure yourself by god's words how's your faith you don't think he's going to get this world in a condition that you've got to use faith why do you think he's going to get it to where you've got to use faith why is it going to take faith we got to do something about this building we had 293 people as much as i'd like to fire marshall to to receive this message i don't want him here until he don't have to cheat on his job no we had 293 people in this building and 64 people watching online lumber's going through the roof everything's going through the roof it don't matter huh how what do you think lumber cost noah i'll guarantee it was higher than it ever was pitch was probably 20 shinglings a barrel up from five don't matter you understand we're in it together we're going to build the church i'm not building the church the only reason i'm the contractor is there's no separation between me and you we are building this church together those that have a vision and understand the pastor's vision and are behind the pastor's vision they're the ones that's going to build this church not the rules of the government or the law of everything you measure it by god's word and all things are possible where are we going to get the money i like what brother tim pruitt he said we've got the money but it's in your account all things are possible when we bind together in faith when we don't let all the craziness that's on in this world and all the fear i mean i can't tiptoe around the gospel i mean i can't be careful i don't preach against this and careful i don't preach against this you know you get so afraid that you're going to offend somebody that you know what i mean you can't hardly preach against nothing and then nobody gets fed that's right now let's go forward let's stand strong on god's word let's believe some of the old-timers that remember brother mike got i remember me and mike sat down there's no way we was going to build this church this church all a hundred and seventy thousand dollars of it we couldn't believe it mike great big long history in banking he knew how to put the stuff together so we finally go to the bank and we're all timid and everything and the banker walks out and he's a friend of mine hey dave what's up what are you doing great i said oh you're over here and now yeah yeah what do you guys want to do build the church no problem when we moved into this building we only filled up the first four rows wow we are scattered in here and people are looking what have we done hey amen what have we done it was like an echo like a can in here and nights like this are going to feel like that over there until we get on fire right till we get in it together but god's moving and i want you know everything's perfect everything's according to his time everything's wonderful and if we stick together if two can put or one can put ten thousand to flight i don't got the scripture a thousand then two of us can do ten thousand we can do all things and and it's gonna get better and god's gonna move and it's wonderful and after about two and a half years they finally accepted our application for our first permit so we'll get it we'll get into that more sunday of everything that's going to have to do so all your brothers blank out all your evenings all your saturdays don't worry i got a church right down the road that they work three years on it every night and every saturday i ain't going to take three years we just work harder and longer but god will do it you believe that you believe everything's just right let's measure it by god's word huh not by what what they say it's what he said heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away let us stand together tonight god's good amen amen i i just i i'm comforted i'm comforted you know in other words the world's in bad shape but at least i can say it's not because of me i was told it was but it's just exactly the way that he wanted it because i'll tell you this world will produce some real christians let's bow our head and then we'll sing god is good all the time and be dismissed let us pray a gracious heavenly father lord these modern events around us

that first great church and come up again it's made clear father every aspect of america and democracy being lost father every prophecy of people going in their houses and wearing masks in the lady in a purple dress it doesn't matter father when we view it through the word of god father we know that everything is according to thy word and father everything was for your word and father you declared
