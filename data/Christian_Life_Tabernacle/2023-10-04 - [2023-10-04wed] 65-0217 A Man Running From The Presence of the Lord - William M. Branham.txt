Description:
65-0217: A Man Running From The Presence of the Lord
Tape - Br. William Branham
Christian Life Tabernacle
October 4, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

you for that having those feelings and being mindful of us is such a comfort and blessing to us we ask you to bless us this evening in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles uh let us turn over to the Book of Jonah and um that's where uh our messenger is going to uh uh read um and uh uh so we're going to play a portion of that uh message this evening um and uh we'll be starting in uh paragraph 42 if you have some sort of uh a way to read it on your phone or of course it'll be on the board I trust and we're going to go all the way through paragraph 141 so we're going to go from uh paragraph 42 through 141 it's about 45 minutes tonight but it's a a a very tremendous message um uh to me it's very important of where brother Brandon placed his messages when he spoke them I think there is a meaning in every bit of it the timing of this is significant and uh uh and I think you'll be able to understand what he's saying uh the presence of the Lord was there and and I think everybody recognized the presence of the Lord was with brother Brandon I mean there was just something about him when he came the atmosphere he created the signs and wonders that followed him that they knew for Surly that the Lord was with him and yet they chose to go back to and run from that presence that was there with them to go back to what they felt more comfortable with they started going back to the the old ways they started following after kathern Coleman and other he Divine healers that were coming onto the scene uh other Ministries that didn't just quite stay with the word but we we do it because he makes a statement in here he says this is a very example of all of us so I I think if we after we listen to this uh it'll be a blessing and then when I get back from uh Cloverdale uh we'll go back into some of these things in a little more context so uh we're just going to pick up there and we're going to start and just listen for the next 45 minutes to the messenger of the hour and I believe you'll be truly blessed let's pray heavenly father as we listen to the voice that you left to guide us in this hour Lord you chose by Your Divine wisdom to create and have man find the magnetic tape so that the voice could be recorded Lord and we can sit here in this present hour and hear the voice of God lord and it we know that it'll bring life to us because spiritual food in due season may you speak to each believer's heart father may they find the truth and the food that you have for them this evening we ask you to bless us now in Jesus precious name we pray amen after the scripture reading feel free to take your seat uh thank you Brothers God bless you for you don't have it go ahead and have your seat just uh relax for a moment and uh soon as we get will for e for technology you know and maybe somebody has a testimony that they'd like to give about the goodness of the Lord has the Lord done anything for anybody oh you guys haven't been in prayer no God's always doing something good for somebody we just know that he's real and uh uh you know I in this little message the prophet of God makes a a a statement and uh uh I don't know if we'll be able to uh get the uh you know the tape up or not but uh I think I trust that maybe you'd go home and and uh listen to it but uh he he I mean we all know the the uh um story of Jonah that of course he was running because the Lord came to him and told him to go to a place he'd never been before so to go into an environment and a place and a a level of discomfort that he had never been in before so he was asking him to to go do something him being a Jew to go to the Gentiles and that was an uncomfortable place for him to go to and so it's it's man's human nature to stay within their comfort zone and even when our messenger begin to preach the gospel that he brought with signs and wonders the greatest challenge they had was that now here was somebody that uh they they were in the Pentecostal movement they uh they uh were uh believing in Divine he healing ready believing in Divine gifts they were believing in all these things and all of a sudden somebody came along that could do all those things even if I could say that more abundantly and with more power than they'd ever seen but yet he was teaching a different Doctrine and that brought him in into a place that they were out of their comfort zone and and and this is what with Nineveh and so they they were running from the presence of the Lord because it was a place that they weren't comfortable with they've never been there they've never felt this way they've never seen that but brother R makes this this statement to everybody he says sh this we must tell the people that we are living in the hour of the hours of the coming of the Son of God we want to watch and God be on the move all the time ready to give a man a correct answer you know so you talk about sometimes the things that we we uh we walk away from or we Sher our responsibility because of it takes us out of our our comfort zone so listen to as our messenger breaks the word to us tonight God bless you ready brother Caleb see if we can get it going many of you in your Bibles I want you to turn to the Book of Jonah always talk so much about Jon being a backlit and everything i' always up for I do not believe Jonah was backlit I I do not believe that I believe it's just we just sometimes use it he's a Jonah but if we I've already spoke on it in another way and telling how that I thought Jonah place now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of amida saying arise and go to n that great city cry out against it or their wickedness has come up before me but Jonah rose up to flee un t from the presence of the Lord and went down to japa and he found a ship going to Tara so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarus from the presence of the Lord isn't that a sad ending a man running from the presence of the Lord that's my subject now first we want to think of this Jonah was the reason the principal reason that I believe that he did this great thing here was because Jonah was a Jew and he was asked to go to a gentile City to cry out against it thinking that he would not be received because the Gentiles would think what's this Jew got to do with us but you see another thing it gives us a great thing here to see that God not only is is God of the Jew but he's God also of the Gentile he's God of all people he just chose the Jews the Jews was called God's chosen people they were chosen for a Pacific cause and that cause was to give to them the law and they could not keep it and he just showed by that people that the law could not be kept and that he was a uh a god of righteousness and the law demanded righteousness but there was no Grace in law to bring a man out no penalty was paid by the law but it taken Grace to pay that penalty of where the law put us under and Jonah here was called on as this one of the Minor Prophets of the Bible to go down to this city and here we find an example of all of us every one of us we always are running from something we run from trouble we run from responsibilities we we're all prone to do that we we are we're more prone to run and we are to stand and face it out see we just we we find ourselves running sometimes we find ourselves prone to run from work we don't want to we don't want to work some people just thinks they can make their living without working but I think Solomon it was that said we could find uh here the answer I'm watching an anunt you know a little Aunt they tell me if that ever ant doesn't work and lay in that Aunt doesn't eat that winter either so everybody has to to work we got so many things we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everybody's got to face a certain responsibility when you when you come to to choose your wife to get married or choose your husband you you've got to take a responsibility and then you must remember maybe you build a home it's a nice pretty home and then remember as a married woman you got to think of the responsibility of raising children you got to think of that pretty slick walls you going to have little dirty handprints all over them then you got the responsibility educating your children you got the responsibility clothing and feeding everything is a responsibility and it's so easy when responsibility is faces to sh from them and we find out that marriage is a responsibility in all manners even many times we find this is hard to say but it's true that ministers many times sh a responsibility or standing for the true word of God when they're confronted with it they'll sh that responsibility when truth of the word of God is brought face to face face with we human beings we have we're prone to Shir back until the last resource I just got through talking to my little nephew up there he's a Catholic and he u i baptized that boy in the name of Jesus Christ here a few years ago and he got with some little girl and turned Catholic and I held his mother's hand while she was dying over there she said to me the last words take care of Melvin and he's just been Dreaming Dreams he just came every every day the last week been dreaming dream said i' walk into your church Uncle Bill you stand there preaching I'd run up to start a make a confession I'd wake up he said I I've been wrong I said Melvin you don't need no interpretation for that your place is down there where you belong that's right but to face up to responsibilities sometimes it takes a very hide off of us to do that as a father to face up the responsibility to give your child a whiping them little fellas you don't want to do that but as a father a mother you got the face of responsibility of raising that child because the Bible said spare the rod you spoil your son and that still stands good in the S of every psychologist there is in the world that Still Remains God's truth if it had been more of that practice we wouldn't have had much juvenile delinquency and stuff in the rot we got in the world today but the old Golden Rule of the homes been broken a long time ago and they that the kids do whatever they want to but even as I said ministers they'll come face to face with truth and then walk away from it see they they're just have it seems like there's something that they they don't want to face up to it many times I've had people come say I know that's right brother Brandon but if I did that they kick me out of the church what of it if you don't you're going to kick you out up there so you got to be kicked out somewhere see so you might as well face up to it instead of running from it say well I'll go over here I won't go back go back sure listen to some more of it search the scriptures Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me but we find that people won't face up with that being brought to U into the presence of God and see when God made a promise and God is obligated to that promise and when he brings that promise to pass then people are afraid to face up to the responsibility of hoping with the message of the hour we find that everywhere how about you Lutheran how many Lutheran was afraid to uh people was afraid to face up to Luther's truth when he come forth with justification look what it cost you maybe your own life to come out and confess Jesus Christ and and become a a Lutheran look at you methodists how it used to be you all were called Holy Rollers I guess you know that and they get out the spirit and jerk back and forth and they said they they had the jerks the meth that no that ain't Pentecostal that was Methodist long years ago and they jerked and Shook and fell under the power of God and they throw water in their faces and faned with fans thought they passed out and now you were considered a bunch of holy rollers but you had your mothers and fathers had to either accept it face up to the truth and facts or turn it or down what about you Pentecostal that receive the restoration of the gifts when the baptism the Holy Ghost come out with speaking in tongues and the gifts of the Spirit coming back in the church well the methodists want to kick you out and they did do it but you had to face up to it it's something you had to do what about the issue when it come out about the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and you saw it was the truth you had to face up to it or do something about it you've got a responsibility everybody has and you must face up to these things all right and when you see that in this day now when the word of God has made these promise Promises of things that we see happening now then we've got the responsibility to either face up to it or get away from it you have you just can't stay neutral you've got to do something about it say some moves got to be made you can't come in that church door and go out the same person you come in you're either further away or closer to God every time you come in or go out there oh how easy it is for people to Sher these things now I want us to think of these when we start into the official uh Services tomorrow night that I want you to notice when something is confronted if you if there's a question about it if there's a question about it there's got to be an answer say for instance I said I was going west and you pointed me this way well the first thing you know I run Plum past my Target and I'm too I'm Northwest well while somebody points me down this way and I go that way I'll pass my target again I went Southwest well as long as there's a question which way is west there's got to be a direct answer somewhere and when these questions confront us about the Bible truth there's got to be the right answer somewhere right it's got to be there and when we see something presented I think instead of just run away say oh nonsense I couldn't believe a thing like that I couldn't believe that why don't you take the Bible and sit down and face up to it study it you're here in the meeting now just look it over check it out yourself with the word check the word by the word that's the only way to make it tell the truth and it must tell the truth from Genesis or Revelations Christ is the revelation of the whole Bible in him Christ all the full fulfilling of all the Prophecies of the Bible is met unconditionally in Christ Jesus because he was God manifested In the Flesh now when we find these things old when we're confronted and come into a meeting and see the power of God moving and doing things and doing Supernatural works and sit performed and look in the Bible and see that it's promised for this hour then when we see those things then we are confronted with the responsibility to either accept it I mean as for ourselves now many people sympathize many people say it's right but that don't that don't make it what that ain't the thing that you're responsible for is I've said what if I was a young man and looking for a wife to be married and here stood a girl that met every qualification that I thought it tough to make a woman while morally she was a queen and lovely and a a a fine personality a real Christian everything that I could think of to make me a good wife no matter how much I say she's perfect she's exactly right she isn't mine till I accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife that's the same thing the message is you might say it's right or this that there and say I sympathize with it I believe it's the truth but you've got to accept it and it's got to become a part of you and you a part of it you got then it's yours when you marry this certain woman that you have chosen you are you are one man and that's where you are with Christ when you see manifested and made real then you are part of him and he's part of you and together you're part of the message oh how many denominational ships have we got going down to tares for the Jonas of these days 900 of them something a ships that takes the easy route don't want to face up to it Jonah didn't want to face up the thing of going to the Gentiles he didn't want to take that cruel message over there within 40 days you'll perish if you don't repent he hated to do that he thought them Gentiles was hard tell what they'll do to me but he had to face up to it he but he took a easy ship and went down to Tara went down down in a h of the ship and went to sleep took the easy route the easy way it's a poer way with the people it's easy to take the way where everybody can patch you on the back and say you're a good fell and this is so and so and certain and the world look up on you it's easy to go the poer way but when when you have to do something different when you have to stand to your conviction and what you know to be the truth there's where the hard part that's the rub comes right there oh as we've often sang that old song how easy while sailing the sea and is calm to trust in the strength of Jehovah's great arm but oh let the waves begin to blow let let the wind blow and whip up the waves then what do you do something like I told one time that a lady said back in a horse and buggy days that said the horse run away with her going from church said what' you do said I trusted the Lord until the lines broke well that's the time to trust the Lord after Ever After the lines is broke you're trusting in the lines until they're broke yes and um so we find out that we have many easy ways to go ships going down to Tara far it's easy unresponsible polities it just Flows in You have everything coming to everybody's likes you and everybody nobody disagree with you you disagree with nobody now that ain't a dish rag that's right yes push over flop over why anybody I don't care who you are and what you're standing for actually decent thinking people will think more of you if you'll stand for your conviction of what's right right don't care you take a woman she might be ever not very attractive and whatever she is but you let that woman stand for principles of Womanhood let her stand like a lady and if a man's got an ounce of man about him he'll take up for Absolut we appreciate something that that somebody's got that they believe that is the truth and'll stand for what they think it's right how Wishy was you that's what too many Christians today are so sof soaked and everything until they think all they do is join a church go in somewhere put their name on a book or do a little something jump up and down shout or something like that and call it Christianity Christianity is a everyday rugged life living for God in the presence world it's a constant burning of the fire and love of God in the heart that set you a fire and put you out you under with the people and making converts to Christ responsibilities but it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream go out there and sit down in the river with your boat you get your ores and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time and it goes hard but you just once let loose the ORS and watch how fast you pass the trees going down but look where you're going when things are floating easy remember your you're going towards a a great cataract down there of some sort you're going towards the falls it won't be long you'll be going over that falls just floating with the world easy the way it goes you don't want that no sir but you must re accept your responsibility now you believe it and you you think it's a truth and the responsibility that God has given us in this day to bring this message and as I get older and I know my days are shortening up I feel a respons responsibility greater than I ever felt press it on we must do it we must get down to it in everywhere we go and tell the message and and tell the people that Jesus Christ is coming that he's God and he's coming soon there's not a not a hope left in the world but the coming of the Lord looking back there are some friends that's with me up there when the angel of the Lord these boys sitting here I believe they found the place where it happened up there and you just remember what the Lord said that day to brother Woods was walking up the hill and and he was kind of weeping because of his wife being sick and the Lord said pick up that rock and throw it up in the air and say thus sayith the Lord and I did that brother Woods is setting as a witness and I said brother Woods it won't be long you're going to see something happen the next day when we were standing there all of us together and a bunch of the man standing right here tonight A young preacher was there and he was uh I noticed I just him the night before he was in our camp he'd come up to be with us and he said to me he said brother Brandon do you ever see Visions out like this I said yes sir but I come out here to get away from him to kind of rest a little bit he said well I said uh uh of course he shows me things out here and I said just over the hill here where the seven angels appeared down in there he said yeah I understand said I was one of the sponsors on your meeting over in California I said well I'm certainly glad to know that and while I was standing there just then I looked around around I seen a kind of a heavy set doctor looking into his eyes and I heard him say you're going to lose that eye because his allergy in there and I've doctored but two years and you're going to lose that eye I said the reason you asked me that because your doctor told you other day he's going to lose that eye and he said that's right and he looked around like that I seen his mother take off one of her stockings and hold her foot out with little tumors hanging down between her toes up and down her Lake and said if you see brother brand tell him to pray for this I said your mother hand her stuck her foot out like that and said she had she got little tumors all over her toes and like that and said to have brother Brandon pray he said brother Brandon that's the truth I look back when I did I see him standing there looking at me like that with his eyes this is bright I made him this fall he had better eyes than anybody in the camp the Lord had heal him and made him well while I was standing there the Lord said show me what was going to happen judgments fixing to strike the west coast and he said get over there beside that fireplace I had had a shovel in my hand walk brother Roy Roberson all of us know him here he's not here tonight as I know him he's in Arizona out there he's a chairman of the trustees here and I knowed being a veteran and something's going to happen a real pretty still morning about 10:00 in the morning the boys all around there 10 or 12 of us letting down tents and skinning out pigs and things so we uh I walked around I said Roy hide quick something's fixing to happen I couldn't tell him no more just time I got all that coming down from the heavens come the Whirlwind of God and clap like shuck the hills running inside that mountain cut a street come around at about 5T above my head and cut all the tops them trees off as the Rocks went out went up in the air and come down again with another big baptism and struck across the mountain and throw the rocks out like that did it three times and I went up in the air and brother Banks come over to me that's what you said yesterday I said yes sir that's exactly it see and then two days after that Alaska sunk almost up there and up and down that West Coast there been the Thunders and pushings and uh everything happening one of these days she's going to slide beneath the ocean right what is it we're living in the hour of the coming of the lord we see isms and things rising up and all these different things we know there's got to be a true answer to this there's people out there in the country now going into caves and things on the 16th of March you read the paper the Lord's coming you know that isn't so Jesus said no man knows near they are when we see all these things and things taking place the way they are they got to be a true answer somewhere there's got to be a truth there's one East and one West but there's a one Southeast and Northwest or something but there's got to be a true answer somewhere to the problem sh this we must tell the people that we're living in the hours of the coming of the Son of God we want want to watch and God be on the move all the time ready to give a man a correct answer it's always been that way it's been man as shered and went away from God ever since Adam in the Garden of Eden when Adam was in the Garden of Eden when he come to the responsibility to make his choice would he stay with God or go with his wife he had to make that he had to make that the responsibility was up to him either had to take what his wife said or what God Said and when he chose to go the way of his wife and when he did that then he lost his original condition and brought the whole world subject to death when he had to take the responsibility of accepting a new life that his wife had found which was contrary oh God think of it God only give him about eight or 10 words to keep but that that tree thou shall not eat that's all they had to keep and even just that much word they broke it then Adam had to face up will I will I do as my wife has said do or shall I do what God Said do and he walked out with his eyes open he had to take the responsibility that throw the whole human race unto death then there come that other Adam which was Christ never one like him somebody say he wasn't God his uniqueness proved he was God I never was a creature live like him he lived in a world to himself he was born outside of the rim of the natural Hallelujah it was the creator himself who could ever stand where he stood who could ever talk like him who could ever say the things that he said who could ever do the things that he done his uniqueness proved he was God he wasn't a prophet or nothing else could do what he done you could call the dead back from the grave and who could stop the skies and do anything he wanted to do he was God who could ever stand in this place who what could he be with that perfect Immortal God a made flesh into all nothing ever compared with him he lived in a world to himself no man ever spake like him when he just opened his mouth there was something about it that was different from anybody else somebody said he was just an ordinary man I defy that God what he was or no man ever spoke like him old man could speak like him because he was a living word itself made flesh the manifestation of the fullness of God I will admit them prophets had their message ah Hadad them then ahead of them now but that was a pness of the godhead poly manifested there he was the unique one and he was the one that had to face the issue with all of his great powers that he had that he could have absolutely been the king of the world he will be and he to the Saints he is now amen he stood there what name of would be poor didn't have a place to lay his head that even though it were a fish water a coin who what man could take them big jugs of water and turn them into wine and not have a place to lay his head he had to face up to the responsibilities that have been given into his hand what man that could Raise A Man Out of the Grave age had been dead four days and rotten could he not have saved himself sure he could but if he did he had not saved us he had to face up to the responsibilities and because of his obedience to the word for Adam's Disobedience and he took the shortcut the the way down to Tous but Jesus Took the Le and in to the Gentiles to get himself a bride I'm glad that he did it tonight we are to face up to the facts that we belong to him take the world away amen every man had to face up to that's got a responsibility before God we just take for instance Noah he had Noah Moses Elijah and all the rest of them of every age had to face up to the responsibility and they had to do it but that's the reason they were sent in the hour look at Noah in his scientific age how he had to face up to a thing that was so unscientific why there wasn't a a reason why it couldn't be unscientific the it it was unscientific rather why they said it's going to rain out of the Skies they never had rain to drop out of the heavens now he had to face up to it God said it was going to rain and then he then faith without works is dead if you say I believe it don't make no act it's like the message you say I believe it don't make an act what good does it do Noah went to work with his hammer and build an art to confirm what he was talking about that's what we have to do too we have to go to work and prove our faith by our works our works proves our faith Moses had to do it Elijah had to do it every prophet in his age had to stand up and face these responsibilities but many of them didn't do like Jonah he run they didn't notice cry out against it oh my there it is that's the subject cry out against it there's the check part this going tell those Fells say I come down to join up with you guys you know I believe I tell you what I do I've got just a little thing here I believe I can make it a bring us all together and do this that the other but it was cry out against when you had to cry out against something now he had to cry out against everything that was down there cry out against the city CED against their work cried against their Church cried against their prophets cried against their ministers cried against their priests cry against it the whole thing cry out against it Noah cried out against his agid sure he did against the churches of his age Moses must certainly did cry out against his his age of the people the priest and so forth he cried all the way through the Wilderness never Junction he cried continually crying to the people Elijah was very unpopular in his day because he cried out against that age certainly was John the Baptist is very unpopular in his age he cried out against his age he said to the king the the potentate of the of the land he he had married his brother's wife he had to preach on marriage and divorce one morning so he cried inst it that it's not lawful for you to have her it cost him his head to be cut off later but he cried out and he stood to his post of Duty he never took a ship to tarus and said well I'll agree with you herry it's all right as long as you think she's a nice woman she's making a nice wife go ahead firsty them FH eggs yeah just every little thing well it's nothing to clean dirty plates with but notice John wasn't that way he faced right up to it he say is not lawful for you to have her yes and he stood out against it they never run John didn't they stood in face the facts Moses tried to run one time like Jonah but God brought him back many of them tried to get away from it they start but look if God has called you and you're are sure that God's in the message there's nothing going to turn you back it didn't turn Jonah no sir Amos of old Cried Out said the lion is roared who came can but fear and God has spake who can but prophesy who can but prophesy when you see God speaks and said a certain thing will happen and there it is lion roar is everybody scared yes sir have you ever heard one Roar in a jungle you hear these Ming around these cages out hear them tame lines but you already hear a real W and Roar one time little rocks will fall off the hill 500 yards away I want see where all that belch comes out of them lungs and he throws his head down throws that fur up I never heard any like a a cannon going off when he belches out that big Roar in his lungs who couldn't be scared to say if you ever killed by line is painless he scares you to death before he gets to you you don't notice it he scares you with that great fous Roar and here he is on in a split second he said the lon has roared who can but fear and God has spoke who can but prophesy when you see God doing something you say I might not be a prophet J said I might not be a prophet of the son of a prophet but God has spoke who can but prophesy I might not be a prophet I might not be this out there when I see God doing anything and I see you're in a word and he promised it who can't hold her peace and keep still sir he's done it neither can we hide behind Creeds and all these your fellowships and down to to tarus we don't want to go there fellowships but may like Adam do the same thing try to make a substitute in some way try to find a way out and and make a substitute to face God knowing the wrong faced up to the truth went on with his wife and did exactly what God told him not to do he went right ahead and did it anyhow then he found himself naked she and he both in the Garden of Eden their eyes come open they know what was right and wrong man and then he tried to find a substitute to kind of cover himself up with it now that's just about the way we do today an excuse that well I'll tell you if it was here if this or if if if that's just see but you must face up to it it's either right or wrong if it's right let's stay if it's wrong get away from it that's all get what find out what is right you don't want to wait any longer let's find out now what's truth and what's right and stay with it we know that's truth now we find today that our people are so it seems like all the sincerity has gone out of the churches uh and we are living in a house there of a pre precious sister that comes to this church she's probably sitting here tonight and she rins it out to her the people and she's just been so sweet to us about that place place about letting us have that place and so I'd call her name but she might not want me to do it she's been so sweet to us well we certainly wouldn't wouldn't want to expose her but she's been a very very dear woman and in the house there was a television over one side we got a little two duplex I got a big F and a bunch of young ons and we and you you know and they have to have beds and plenty of them and everything piled up on top you have to walk through this and through that to get in and out and then over there they had a television and in this uh a television these kids got watching on Sunday morning U some kind of a hymn singing that come on and you know it it would almost make you ashamed if there wasn't a genuine Christianity somewhere that you could put your hands on to see what's called Christianity why it seems like all the sincerity has gone out of it why they don't they don't seem to why it's just terrible way you stand there and draw their fist and fight one another on there and try to sing hymns and everything like that and pull jokes that hardly would a sailor would pull and say all kinds of things to kid and go on you know the sacredness of of of Christianity has seem to lose its place now I go to church and and see the pastor get up there and announce that the there's going to be a swimming bee all the women these bathing suits they're all going out there they're going to have a contest these women swimming and they're going to have a a party of some s you go to fry up a lot of chicken and play Bunko and and all these things like that to me that takes the genuine sincerity out of Christianity just get by with anything uh seen uh coming up here we find out you know we find more of our sisters wearing shorts up here in this cold country then you find him out there in a hot country it's true out there where it's really hot there not too many of them that wear them but here where where it's coold they they do it see it's they don't realize it's a devil doing that see now if it's to be comfortable if it's to help yourself it'd be different being man I think it looks sickly on a man but it but you wouldn't pay no attention to a man but the lady her body is sacred and she must keep it that way and to see all you can see people today these two spirits and one of them is a Holy Spirit the other is an Unholy spirit and one's governed by and both of them religious that's a strange part they're both religious and just like Esau and Jacob was both religious like Cain and Abel was both religious like Judas and Jesus was both religious both religious and we see it today both sides religious see it's the same Spirit the people die but the spirit doesn't die it's goes right on both religious one of them is possessed with the holy spirit that lives the kind of life that they should live and walk Godly and honest they wouldn't beat you out of a penny and they they do everything honest that they could to help you and others will just as nice as they can be and the others we find out it's just vice versa and yet both of them are religious Spirits two of them one Holy Spirit and the other Unholy spirit and if you notice it'll even though claiming religion they'll make fun of you and call you a holy ruler they do anything they can uh they ignoring the the unchanging word of God as though it never had been written see you can say now look at here if if the baptism I have the Holy Spirit and stand there that cigar in your hands yes I have the Holy Spirit I don't think it's wrong to take a little drink I don't think it see as you notice I don't think but God thinks different you see Accord to his word see they and they they just simply as much as as spit on it that's exactly right just as much as this little little guy that crawled out that time when David was being uh excommunicated from his throne he's going up on the Mount of ol he's going out weeping as he went up looking back and this little old fellow crawled out there and spitting on him and that guard said I'll let the that dog's head stay on him spit on my King David said let him alone see they spit on him about 800 years later they spit on his son Jesus Jus Christ too and today they spit on it again as if it wasn't even just un reverent unconcerned just turn up their head and walk away from it laugh in your face why is it they only ship the tarus that's that it's called to God you got to cry out against evil cry out against sin cry against the things that's wrong now remember it'll be hey you know this time you know I'm two hours difference in two song just 10 minutes after seven I'm getting kind of kind of out of my pleasure huh all right now remember we're going to have to answer F remember those who spit on Christ answer F when David returned back from his Exile when he was the Fugitive and when he returned back remember this fellow fell on his face and cried out for Mercy he spit on David going out but he was almost ready to bathe his feet with tears and when he returned back and someday those who Pierce Jesus will see it and those who are piercing him today will see it also there someday it'll come back remember Revelations 22 he requires us to keep every word that he has written every word now we know his presence are here it's Vindicated we are having it we're trusting in this coming week that'll continue to be uh uh Vindicated Among Us the sick will be healed and great things will be taking place we don't want the popper idea we want the truth now we don't we want don't want the we you don't want to face up to nothing but what God has said is the truth but be sure that your sins will always find you out if it doesn't here it'll get you to judgment so you're you're it's going to catch you somewhere now that's but if you are a true Christian truly called like Jonah was God's already got your fair paid get off of that ship going to t god predestinated you to this life yes sir if you're a true called child of God come to Christ come into the fullness of him your ways paid to where it's paid to Nineveh not to tarus you're predestinated your ship is a ship leaving right now on its road so there's only one thing to do is get on it and if you was like God you'll never have no peace like my little nephew a while ago about 10 years now he's went from Pillar To Post someone he goes to this church this Catholic Church down here and take this one it go what some Holy Father talks about over here and some other over here and some over what does it all amount to see now he's still hungering and thirsting I said your place is at the altar down there son see there's no way of getting out of it when God ever takes out at you you just might as well give up and go on that's all remember God God was in the boat God was in the storm God was in the fish every before he turned God was there see God's there and he just keep haunting at you so why do we wait any longer let's just start this revival right amen right what you're waiting on we believe that the coming of the Lord is at hand and he's going to have a bride it ready we don't want no ships any tares we're going to Nineveh we're going to glory amen that's right we're going where God's going to bless and that's what we want to do lay out in the presence of God then with our hearts not our hands so much but our hearts before God until he seasoned us through and through like that with a raise of his glory and baked into us his his goodness and ripen that which we have got into reality see to where we can show others that Jesus Christ lived oh my we want to be that and remember where Jonah went God was in the boat God was in the storm God was in the fish he went on being right along with Jonah until his perfect will was done that's right and if he's ever after you you might Dodge over here and Dodge over there but you'll be miserable until you come back and do the thing you start it out for him to do it the first place see don't go run from the presence of God face up to it you believe it's a truth then if it is a truth it's worth living for dying for anything else and if he's ever Vindicated to you that is the truth then we can't run from it no worry he'll be right there just the same he can't do it by his provided Prophet The Wanted he ordained to go down there and call that message now look like he could have sent another prophet but he ordained Jonah and even Elijah wouldn't have done Jeremiah wouldn't have done Moses wouldn't have done it was Jonah had to go to Nineveh that's all there was to it he commissioned him and told him to go and when he says go there Jonah go to Nineveh nobody else can go do that but Jonah and when God tells you something you've got to do it no body else see we just have to face up to it and and go do it we believe that we're living in the hour that when God is doing something we believe that we're living among them now I believe tonight I'm preaching to that congregation that it's laying waiting out there just to get right I I really believe that with all my heart I would that it's the same now as it's always been now we believe that the hour has come that St John 14:12 must be fulfilled we we believe that Malachi 4 must be fulfilled we believe Luke 17:30 must be fulfilled we believe that all these prophecies that he said would come to pass in this day we believe they must be fulfilled and we believe we're seeing them fulfilled right now that's exactly right stop running don't get out of his presence just move up into his presence that's right and I know that's what you're desired you do because I seen license out there from Texas and Louisiana and everywhere that's what we're here for is not to run from his presence but to run into his presence come back get off been of Jonah if you've been wondering which way to go or what to do come on get on the ship with us tonight we're going down to Tarsus to cry out Nineveh to cry out we're let that tarus ship go on down if you want to we've got a duty before God that's a message that we're responsible for so in this coming week just a little plude tonight to let you know when I'm crying out I'm solely responsible for our message Brethren you Minister sitting here I'm not here to hurt your feelings and you women and men on this marriage and divorce case coming up on you remember tonight I said all this to get this to you that I am responsible only to God and then again I'm responsible to you to tell you the truth and I'm not going to tell you nothing but the truth as long as God lets me know what truth is until I know the truth I won't say nothing about it I won't say nothing about it but I do believe that God shows me the truth on marriage and divorce and uh I trust that he'll let me bring it out and other messages I aim to have this week is who is this mdic where did God choose to put his name and a few of those things like that which are messages coming up and birth pains and and a few things on on that order and uh complimentary to a man choosing his wife and a few things of that messages I want to bring up this week but I just want the congregation where if there be a minister here I'm not here my brethren I don't want sh some of you members go back to your church and say brother Bram said thus and thus I am Duty bound to a message that's been given to me from almighty God as I stand here tonight and God knows that's true that right down on this River there's people perhaps sitting here when that angel of the Lord come down there and told me what he did right there in 1933 right down this Spring Street here if you're a stranger here dri right corner of Spring Street there we hit the river and there's where it happened that's been in 1933 it's probably been about 32 years ago and oh it's been 30 been 30 32 years ago 32 years ago and how that he's brought that right down everything and we went out bringing the message and seen the sick healed the Blind and crippled and lame and Halt and everything and then seen even the dead that we know that's been verified raised up from the dead the people die and raised right back to life again and all these things if a message Goes Forth there signs and wonders and you still see that same old whole school of thought that you come up with that didn't come from God God don't just have to do God is trying to get your attention attracted to something and then when Jesus went out he started Healing The Sick and doing great works and things he all Jesus did it in Moses and Jesus done it in the rest of them and when he was sure he did it and he's doing it the same thing today when he sends forth a meeting like that revivals and starts a meeting in the earth and starts a moving along with these great signs and wonders then you see come back that same old school of teaching there there's something wrong there somewhere there's something new coming forth when Jesus came out after when he could go to any pulpit and preach when he was Healing The Sick well well they like to have more there but one day when he stood down and said I and my father are one brother he wasn't suppoer after that when he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you but he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and I'll raise him up at the last day then he wasn't poer man said this man's a vampire this man's a be that's where he done them things he could tell fortunes he looked through their their minds and perceived their thoughts he's a fortune tell about what it was he he was the word of God made manifest for that hour and he was Duty bound he said I do always that which is pleasing to my father God help us to do the same thing do that which is pleasing to the father and I hope you all understand if you disagree with me on these messages and things that you'll remember at least have this respect that I have a responsibility and I'm not going to Tara I'm on the road to Nineveh I got to cry out the Lord bless you all let us bow our heads now just a moment wasn't that a wonderful refreshing message of the commitment that you've got to have you know in that's a a especially good message if I would say that for young people you know uh this isn't a social gospel you know this isn't let's get all the young people together and let's find boyfriends and girlfriends and date this this is the preparation for the coming of the Lord and uh not the dancing and shouting and the feeling good it's back to the word back to the word stay with the word be sincere Lord bless you let's stand together this evening and brother Bill if you come read us in a song dismiss us in prayer would you all pray for me this weekend I leave tomorrow morning and um and uh it's a long flight and for some reason I found out I got a middle seat now to me

Sunday morning so uh just keep us in prayer and uh and we just trust that the Lord will uh put something on my heart that is stirring for us all so the Lord richly bless you we appreciate you tonight
