Description:
64-0719E: Going Beyond The Camp (P. 25-154)
Tape - Br. William Branham
April 13, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

bless us now in jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated we're going to listen this evening to a little message and i just wanted to make this real short comment we kind of a busy evening so we're going to try to be out here just in about an hour uh 15 minutes and then they can have their choir practice i don't mind if you practice in the sanctuary as long as there's no carrying on you know it i mean we don't have the facility but you know we we don't want a lot of things worked out in here but anyway i just wanted to clear that up in case any of my comments were understanding well this is the night before a lot of our congregation is going to head over to what we call camp and so i this message came on my heart and when it came on my heart it i hadn't put the two together but this message we're going to listen to is called going beyond the camp and you know it's man's nature to set up camp so you you could go to camp and set up a camp you know what i'm saying but we want to go beyond the camp and i just wanted to read two statements and then we'll stand and we'll turn in our bibles over to the 13th chapter to hebrews starting with the 10th verse but i'd like to read this verse he said he makes this statement and he said uh you know i was told some time ago that they had a jet plane now that can make them noises we hear around that shakes the windows it's when the plane has got so fast that it crosses its own sound called the sound barrier and when it goes beyond its own soundberry it's almost unlimited to what it will do and i think that there and i think in there we get a lesson when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of god then it's unlimited what god can do with the man that's ready to go beyond the camp the camp of man that is now we see that going beyond the camp going beyond this camp amen and then the prophet of god will make another statement he says three thousand years ago a man could meet god almost anywhere it was a common thing for man to meet god but why don't they meet him today there is more people thousands times thousands millions of more people than there was three thousand years ago and yet god is some ancient something that was talked about some ancient history they don't meet god in person and they they did that many years ago as i said three thousand some three thousand year goes they don't do it it's not common for a man to meet god and if a man talks about it he's considered a crazy person somebody that's lost their mind it's so uncommon to them well we realize if we can go to a place that we've never been there's things that can be opened up to us and so this is an hour and three minutes that we're going to listen and uh so we're just going to stand and we're going to listen to a message so this is to all of our young people that are going to camp don't go to camp to set up a camp go to camp to go beyond the camp where it becomes personal where you go out of your comfort zone out of where you are in yourself and into the camp of god's presence where he can use you exceedingly and abundantly and above that which you can even ask her things so if you have your bibles and you'll turn over to the scripture there in hebrews the 13th chapter and we'll start listening on paragraph if you have some sort of device that won't read uh ring or something in church it we are going to start at page paragraph 25 and going beyond the camp an hour or three minutes listen quite a message in this message amen this is our absolute all our future is built on the revelation that comes from this word heavenly father we ask you to bless our service to us now as we listen to your word father and you speak to our hearts in this next uh 30-61 minutes or so lord we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you and as christian soldiers let's stand at attention while we read the word of god listen close to the reading of the word the reason i like to read it my words may fail but he is one so if i read his word alone you'll be blessed 10th verse of the 13th chapter of hebrews we have an altar for all they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come lord god who is responsible for this word and responsible for taking care of it down through the ages to see that it's come to us unadulterated it is pure virgin word of god we so cherish it in our hearts at this moment break this text up lord into a context for us tonight that we the children of man might understand the bidding of god or we asked it in jesus name amen god bless you my subject for the this evening is going beyond the camp it's quite a little subject it's a little odd but you know usually we find god in odd things the world gets so set in a custom thing there anything irregular from the regular trend it becomes odd as i preached here a few days ago at the tabernacle on the oddball and the farmer is an oddball to the businessman the businessman and oddball to the farmer the christian is an oddball to the unbeliever and so forth yet to be somebody's fool so anything unusual it makes you kind of a fool to the the regular trend and therefore god's people and his prophets and his his messengers through the age that carried his message from the word has been considered fools to the outsider noah was a fool to his great intellectual world that he preached noah was certainly a fool to pharaoh with his foot on the throne and then forsake it for a bunch of mud daubers as they thought and jesus was a fool to the people and all the rest of them that's worked and lived for god has been considered fools they have to go beyond the camp that they have more and more i am made to believe that people are not getting to christ now i am here to try to help in every way that i can and make my statements as clear as i know how to make them and you suffer with me if you will as i look and preach across the nation and watch the people i i'm fully persuaded that the people are not getting to christ and i believe that it's the enemy that stole this hindrance because the reason i believe is he is not the object that they have been pointed to they have either been pointed to a a dogma or a doctrine or a party our experience or a sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to christ the word amen that's why i think that people are resting their eternal destination upon some dogma or some sensation like uh some say i danced in the spirit uh i spoke with tongues i i felt fire run over me and do you know all those things can be impersonated by the devil there's just one thing that he cannot impersonate that's the word in the debate between he and jesus each time jesus defeated it is written the word i believe today that the reason that people are not coming to christ is because there appointed many of them to a a denomination you come join our church or you are read our catechism or believe our doctrine are some system of some sort they're appointed in the wrong way and their action and the life that they live without christ proves in their own life is vindicated by that very thing for instance i don't want to hurt anyone stealing but back and forth across the nation i have condemned women wearing short hair that's the bible i've condemned women wearing shorts using makeup and every year it gets worse it shows that there is another finger somewhere pointing them some other way and they're not getting through to christ and they say we belong to a church our church don't don't make any difference what your church believes god said it's wrong and if they did get through to christ they would stop that and not only that but man would take his position if he got through to christ and be against that husbands wouldn't let their wives act like that genuine man don't want his wife acting that way a young fellow here in the city the other day like to kill two young boys they were at a certain polling station you jeffersonville people seen it in the paper and this a young girl run into a philly station with nothing on harley at all and the two young man sitting there made a remark and the attendant liked to kill the two boys and was arrested for it and put in court and the judge asked him why did you she dressed like this he said i think she looks cute now there's something wrong with that man i don't care if he's a sinner there's something wrong with him his love to that woman couldn't be genuine and put her out for a dog bait like that there's something wrong has man ever come to the realization they can judge between what's right and wrong did you see the new bathing suits they brought out do you know my prediction that women would finally come to fig leaves 33 years ago and now they've got them dressed in fig leaves transplant skirts the word of the lord never fails that was to take place just before the end time come to a fig leaf again i was reading it in life magazine that was said 33 years ago before women took their fall is told how they would do it in this day and here they are how they wear garments like man and how the immorals of the woman will drop in this nation lowest of all the nations there is in the world is this america she's the filthiest of the bunch that's according to the statistics the marriage and divorce rates are higher in this nation than any other place in the world another nation's pattern we used to pattern from france filth and dirt of that nation and now they get their dressing from us we step beyond their boundaries i know there's some reason that people are not getting through to christ if they would they wouldn't act like that jesus suffered without the gates that he might sanctify his people with his own blood sanctification comes from a greek word compound which means cleaned and set aside for service and when god cleans his people with the blood of jesus he cleans them from the filth of the world and sets them aside for service wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate even to the full gospel people has come right back into the rep that they come out of what was the pentecostal church 40 50 years ago they cursed them damned and ridiculed the churches that they come out of them denominations what did they do just like a dog to its vomit and a sow to its water they turned right back in the same place that they were huge from now their churches are just as filthy as the rest of them it was something else i said this morning like uh the people are like peter said in saint uh saint matthew 17 um 48 where he said it's good to be here let's build three tabernacles but the spirit fed him not to do it said this is my beloved son hear ye him and he is the word amen that's who we're to look to the word not our enthusiasm or something else he is my word hear ye him and what did they see after this voice spoke to them even moses and elijah wasn't present neither was there a creed neither was there anything left but jesus only and he is the word that's all they see now going without the camp we find that on their camp where this great occasion took place up on mount transfiguration as peter later called it the holy mountain where he met with them now i do not believe the apostle meant that the mountain was holy he meant it was a holy god on the mountain it isn't the holy church it's not the holy people it's a holy ghost in the people the holy ghost is holy he is your director and your leader and we find on this little camp up on the mountain transfiguration when they were commissioned to hear the only thing they was commissioned to do was to hear the word amen only thing they seen without a creed they never seen nothing else but jesus and he is the word made flesh [Music] how beautiful that is to the same camp that was in the garden of eden when god fortified his church in the garden of eden his people they had one wall to stay behind that was the word they had one shield one armor one thing because god knowed what would defeat the devil amen and that's the word jesus did the same thing it is the word it is written and satan tried to to quote it not quote it quote it for him and jesus said and it's also written now we must stay with that word and in this little camp that they had there of peter james and john and jesus moses and alive and in their camp they seen the heavenly host of the shadow or the pillar of life hanging in this cloud that transfigured the lord jesus and when they were ready to make a denomination one for the law and one for the prophets and so forth the voice said this is my beloved son hear ye him then the thought they was commissioned just exactly like it was in eden stay with the word that's god's camp for his people it seems today to be a day of when people are going beyond the camp and everything they're going beyond you know i was told some time ago that they had a jet plane now that can make some noise as we hear around here that shakes the windows it's when the plane has got so fast that it crosses its own sound called sound barrier and when it goes beyond its own sound barrier it's almost unlimited to what i'll do and i think in there that we get a lesson when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of god then it's unlimited what god can do with a man that's ready to go beyond the camp the camp of man that is now we see that going beyond the camp going beyond this i see satan also is taking his people beyond the camp of reason beyond the the the camp of of common sense satan taken his people the other way beyond the camp god taken his people beyond this other way and satan has taken him beyond the camp of common decency when it comes to a place that people and can act and do and get by with the things that they're doing today in the order of morals it's beyond my thoughts of how that a man can set his wife out there dress like that and then slap somebody for insulting her it's beyond common sense you ought to know better than that beyond common decency where is the stop in place some man or woman at my age i might ask you this what if my mother or your mother about 50 years ago walked out on the street with one of these pair of shorts of bikini is there what you call it on the law would have picked him up immediately and put him in the insane institution a lady left the house without her top clothes on and she should be in the institution because middle east say something wrong and if it was mentally to do a thing like that then it certainly is a sign that something's went insane it's still and when a man can smoke cigarettes and the doctor's proven to him that thousands die every year from the calls and can still puff away at cigarettes it seems like there's something wrong with that man's mind and when a man has a mental shock and he doesn't can't get himself together what he's doing he'll search every doctor's office or is it a country to find out what's wrong with him but then he'll stand at the bar or in the car and drink till he's totally insane spend his money to shove himself into that and if you happen to go into it without the intoxication of liquor then he'll spend every penny he finds in a doctor's office trying to find out what's wrong with him it doesn't make sense if there would come a chicken hog flying over the city and i'd get my rifle and go out in my backyard and shoot this hulk and 10 minutes from there i'd be in jail they would have me arrested for for disorderly conduct handling a firearm in the city endangering people's lives with a rifle shooting up in the air at the halt i might kill somebody you'd say he ought to be put away and then they will sell a man enough liquor to get him drunk and stick him in a car that might kill a whole family full and when he's caught he's given five dollars in cost premeditated murder what's the matter with the world something's wrong somewhere now going beyond the camp beyond decency beyond reason you notice our politicians today won't say nothing about reading the bible in school they're afraid they don't know which way the winds are blowing they don't know where they lose the vote or not we need another abraham lincoln we need another john quincy adam we need somebody who will stand up regardless of which way the winds are going and give her honest convictions the day of the nomination preacher though you're streaming the word the truth he don't know what to do he's afraid he'll lose his meal ticket we need men and women today that's burly with the gospel somebody that'll stand and tell their convictions point out what's right and what's wrong hallelujah whether the word of god or were the denominations right jesus said let every man's word be a lie and mind the truth amen heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away so you see they go beyond the camp of god's word to find their answers we hear what's persuaded them from the camp of god's word like he did eve in the garden of eden satan has done the same thing today all right we find that people are persuaded to their dogmas and creeds without the camp in their camp of dogma and creed they have a camp also and that puts them into his king his is the camp of education theology works doctor's degree educational personality everything that's against god's word camp god has to camp for his people the domination has her own camp three thousand years ago a man can meet god most anywhere it was a common thing for a man to meet god but why don't they meet him today there's more people thousands times thousands and millions of more people than it was 3 000 years ago and yet god is some ancient something that was talked about some ancient history they don't meet god in person like they did many years ago as i said three thousand some three thousand years ago they don't it's not common for man to meet god if a man talks about it he's considered a crazy person somebody that's lost their mind it's so uncommon to them and the case of abraham and it is camp why it was almost an everyday occasion that abraham met god he talked to him not only that but when they went down in the guerrilla to sojourn we find out down there that god was in the camp with amalek a philistine it was a very common thing they lived in the camp of his presence today they live in their own camp and they haven't got nothing to do with god's king they want nothing to do with it because it's fanatically to the world it's fanatically to them but remember when god fixed the first camp for people he fortified them with his word he always does but today in their camps they don't know that's reason you don't hear so much about god now i believe that the if the camp as moses how he met moses in the wilderness moses had a camp out there where he was feeding his father's lost sheep jethro on the back side of the desert and one day to this old 80 year old sheep herder he uh seen a light or a pillar of fire in a bush burning and he met god a man that was running from god the next day sometimes meeting god makes you do things unusual moses is very unusual the next day he had his wife setting the straddle of a mule with a baby on her hip his long beard down with a crooked stick in his hand going down to egypt to take the nation over now that was a ridiculous sight where are you going moses going to egypt what far to take it over he had met god a one-man invasion it seemed awful strange but the thing of it was he'd done it because he had met god just like one person going to take russia over that's all you need one person in the will of god moses is in the will of god and a crooked stick he had his hand not a sword or stick uh unusual things god does but remember moses had to get out of the camp that he had been living in to do this because he had been down there with a whole army and couldn't do it with all the armies of egypt he couldn't do it but one day god invited him into his camp he said who are you that i am that i am not i was or will be present tense i am i'm the god of abraham isaac and of jacob i've heard the people's cry and i remember my promise and this is the time for this to be fulfilled i'm sending you down moses with this stick that's in your hand what was it he now the people thought he was crazy but what had he done got out of his own camp pharaoh educated in 40 years in the school camp and he failed and it taken god another 40 years to get it out of him all of his education and all of his theology that he'd been taught it taken 40 years to get it out of him and then god used him for 40 years god has an awful time preparing his man but you see he never could get moses hold of moses to moses got out of his own man-made [Music] the campaign from the military way of doing it and the natural way of doing it onto the supernatural way of doing it then when he got in that camp god could use him now we find out that in this wilderness we notice when they've taken taken their stand and come out of egypt into god's camp coming out of the camp with the priests and all them saying sell yourself we're slaves for the rest of time when moses the prophet came down and vindicated the word of god was at hand that god who made the promise was there to deliver the people they moved from the camp that they were in into the camp of god's promised word of the hour they believed that prophet because the sign of vindication was proven that it was exactly the word of god and the things he did prove that it was right and the pillar of fire followed him along prove that it was the word of god now in this camp miracle signs and wonders was in this camp they moved them out into the wilderness they left their natural camp they left the mud camp they left the camp made with straw and brick to dwell in tents out in the wilderness where there was no grain or nothing else sometimes god asked us to do foolish things to her own thinking if you ever leave the camp of your own reason that's the place you'll find god amen notice as they went out into the wilderness there were miracles signs when they moved into this camp now remember they left egypt's camp and moved out into the wilderness with god's camp how do you know it was god sent your people shall sojourn for 400 years but i'll bring them out with a mighty hand and i'll give them this land here and they were on their road by a vindicated light a vindicated prophet with signs wonders that god was in the camp and they were on their road they had a pillar of fire they had a prophet they had manna they had living waters amen their chance changed campgrounds they had to do it they couldn't see those things in egypt they had to change the campgrounds in order to see the supernatural so will the people of this state have to change the camp from them denominations that say the days of miracles has passed there's no such a thing as the baptism of the holy ghost and all these scriptures are wrong and they work for another age you'll have to change your compounds go beyond that tent the world things are possible all of them was vindicating his presence in the camp now notice then them they made a man-made cape of traditions and creed after moses was dead and god dealt with the people for many years uh god uh not in his camp anymore in their camp because they made a camp self-made camp remember when they were called out of egypt god provided them a prophet provided them a sacrificial lamb provided them all they had need of a word a sign a miracle a prophet to lead them an atonement to take care of them the pillar of fire to lead them and when they got out into the wilderness they still wasn't satisfied they wanted something they could do themselves grace had provided that now they want something to do themselves so they can make them an organization fuss and fight and stew who is going to be high priest who would be this that or the other one day god said moses separate yourself from him and he just swallowed him up and again saying of cora notice all these signs and wonders vindicate his presence then made it man made himself a camp a camp of creed and could tradition not god's camp of his word a camp of their own he had to leave them for he is the word he cannot stay where people are taught out of this word god cannot stay in the camp he can't he never did he must stay exactly where he's when he had to leave that camp then of that whole gang of people that he brought up out of egypt he only dwelt among his prophets to whom his word came the word came to the prophet to vindicate the hour he dwelt among the prophets and revealed to the prophets how they cursed the people and cursed the things and god taught them his commandments and the way of life and the people was always against it and persecuted the prophet and finally stoned him or sought him to pieces and got rid of him jesus said which one of the prophets didn't your father's murder which one of them are the just ones that was sent to them and said the works of your father you'll do he wasn't talking to communists he was talking to priests denominational people pharisees and sadducees i suppose his voice wouldn't change very much tonight only be a little worse maybe to them now we find out that he dwelled in among his prophets he then became a stranger to them for he dwelts only in his word to confirm it the bible said that he watches over his word to confirm it he's trying to find someone if he can just get a half-hearted man like samson samson surrendered his strength to god but he gave his heart to delilah that's the way that many times we do today just give something to god but not all but god wants all of us like an insurance policy when you get an insurance policy you might as well get full coverage and that's what this blessed assurance does for us it's a full coverage policy it covers all we have needed up here in this life and our resurrection and eternal life it includes everything notice god stayed out of their camp then for 400 years why he had no more prophets from the prophet malachi to the prophet john 400 years there's not one turn of a wheel that israel done god was out of the camp they pat him out by their creeds and their selfishness and their difference towards the word 400 years without the word from one prophet to another he journeyed until the last prophet was malachi and then there was another prophet for 400 years and then god came on the scene again one day he walked among them again but their traditions had so tackled his place among them he was a stranger to them the traditions of the fathers had washing pans and and the way to groom their hair and where the certain buttons on their coat and they're certainly police priests robes and one's a staunch pharisee and the others of sadducee and that had taken the place of the word among those men to when god visit them he was a foreigner may i say this with love and respect but to drive it home it's the same thing today it hasn't changed a bit when he comes among the people in his power and manifestation to prove that his words the same yesterday today and forever because he is the word the people said a fortune teller of the elizabeth but jesus only or or something like that some clash you somewhere but it has to be that way see we haven't had a prophet now for almost 2 000 years the gentiles didn't get one you know promised at the end now we know that by scripture we know that also by history that this is promised to us now after 400 years god walked right among them one day according to the scripture he was to be made flesh and dwelt among them his name shall be called counselor prince of peace mighty god everlasting father and when he came among the people they said we'll not have this man rule over us what what fellowship card does he pack what denomination sent him he had no cooperation every church she went to they thought it out they had nothing to do with him because he wasn't one of them and as it was then so is it now the bible said the ladies church would put him on the outside and he was knocking trying to get in there's something wrong somewhere now why they had made their own camp they if they were to know the word they had to know who he was jesus said if you search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life they are the ones that tell you who i am amen that's what the scripture says now they testify me and if i do not the works that was promised for me to do if i do not to worship my father the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now if i am that person search the scriptures and see what i'm supposed to do and if i don't qualify if my works the works that the word testifies the father testifies of me if they don't vindicate who i am then i'm wrong amen that's right if you can't believe me please the works that the word produces see he was a stranger among them they didn't know him we'll have nothing to do with this fellow just the odd fellow they've been born down there uh in a stable somewhere they believed that his mother had this baby before that it was born before it was uh had this baby from an illegitimate birth rather and then before the baby was born that she went off and married joseph and he did that just to hold a black mark off of her her character and he become an odd sort of a fella because he was a illegitimate born child and that's the reason he was and when he come out what did he do tear down their creeds turn over their tables get them out of places that's written [Applause] not aren't you told who he was it is written well they have nothing to do with such a fellow as that but way down deep in their heart they know who he was for nicodemus plainly stated that rabbi we the pharisees we know your teacher come from god for no man could do the things that you do except god be with him why didn't they confess he man it's because they're camp had set its boundaries it wouldn't let him in the camp and wouldn't let anybody go out to him [Music] they had their own camp he combined when the gate was really closed but he found that he could met him anyhow yes same now they have he's become a stranger foreigner they don't understand it why would this be and why would that be when the word itself testifies that this is exactly what's supposed to be done in this day we went through it over and over but it's the truth he was to them in their camp a fanatic a breaker of their traditions our upsetter of their churches really just a fortune teller spears is called beelzebub that's what he was and i believe if he come among us today he'd be the same thing to us for we have tradition we have denominations we can't even get along with one another why there's only one place that man can get along that's under the shed blood and the blood was shed as a germ of life to germatize this seed the word outside of that our denominational bearers will always keep people away but he'd be a stranger today he'd be called the same thing he'd be active he'd be put out of the camp and did you know the same bible that said you'd be rejected a man a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and they rejected and we did a steaming smitten thinking of god the very scripture that told that the very prophet that sang out my god my god why has thou forsaken me my bones they all stare at me they pierce my hands and my feet when they were singing that hymn in the church their sacrifice the god that they thought they were serving they were crucifying so is it today the very god look what the prophet said amos when he come into samaria and his little eyes narrowed as he come before that scene that sinful city women laying in the street with man of modern america when he looked up over his air eyes narrowed and he had nobody sponsoring he had no fellowship card god is saying would the people hear his message no they wouldn't hear him but he prophesied and he said the very god that you claim to serve will destroy you i say in the name of jesus christ the very god that this nation claims to be a religious nation the very god that they claim to serve will destroy them in their initiative and destroy every denomination off the face of the earth but they claim to serve so notice he rebuked them and they put him out of their camp jesus suffered without the camp he put him out of the camp outside way beyond their camp we find out that the bible said in this slave stay under this lady of sea and age they'd do the same thing they would be put out of the camp now watch what he says to do now in closing put out of the camp where the sacrifices was burned that's where he belonged he was a sacrifice now brother sister do you know that each one of you all must sacrifice you must be god's sacrifice sacrifice the things of the world sacrifice your own pleasures of this world sacrifice the things of the world amen you know the reason that people won't do it you know a sheep a sheep don't have but one thing to offer and that's wool and now he's not asked to produce or to manufacture some wool for this year he's asked to put to bear wool we're not asked to manufacture something we're asked to bear the fruit of the spirit that is the inside of the sheep what he is on the inside makes the wool on the outside and when a man is got christ on the inside it may seem christ-like on the outside not some artificial put on well we find when that takes place when christ comes back how is he treated just exactly like it was at the beginning always has been so he so rebuked them that they put them out of his camp and made him as a sinner which he became sin for us now after hundreds of years yes almost 2 000 years he's visit their camp again according to his promised word that he'd do in the last days he's visit the camp again he's visited the camp to manifest this word today just like he visited back in that day and he did in moses dave that was not moses doing that moses was a man it was christ look at joseph the life love of the father hated of his brothers well because he was a seer and they hated him without a cause that's only cause they could hate him for perfect time for today exactly the church again they hate the spiritual things and we find out that he was sold for 130 pieces of silver supposed to be dead tucked up and put in a prison house like jesus was on the cross one man lost and one man saved and was taken from there to the right hand to pharaoh it's exactly the way jesus was down it was david went up through the streets of crying rejected king and set up on the mountain weeping over jerusalem that wasn't david the son of david a few hundred years after that set on the same hill and wept because he was rejected king among his own people it's christ always and today when it's prophesied that christ must come into the camp you know what happened it'll be just exactly like it was then it's got to be that way to fulfill what the word here promises he'll do now remember christ was in the age of noah that was christ jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever they rejected word of the hour notice and his prophecy of revelation 3 found when he come in this last day as he prophesied he had come in this slight state and how did he find the church at ladies rich have needed nothing and said as a queen and casino sorrow and putting outside the church had no use for him he went without the camp again but then she didn't know that she was naked blind and miserable and knew it not again if he come again in the same way as he was in he would rebuke every woman that wore sharks he rebuked every bob-haired woman ever painted face every man that would be little enough to let his wife do that he is still standing tear down every denomination it was and break up every creep we had you believe they did it you sure would that's right what would they do with him put him out the camp they sure wouldn't cooperate with him no sir now we find him again and this day as the bible said he would put out the camp for he never remains the same the word same yesterday and forever they they don't want him they rejected him again with their counsel they would prefer today like they did then when he was on trial and today when the word is on trial what's happened they have rejected again like they did then and accepted a bravas a murder instead of christ the council would do the same thing and today because they have rejected the word and the perfect vindication of the hour they have sold out and preferred a barabbas the world council of churches are murderer of the word he denies word denies baptism denies power denies signs and with the creed our tradition again of wearing turnaround collars and everything making themselves creeds and so forth they're trying to upon good works they wasn't ordained to life to begin with they had nothing to believe with he that knows me knows my father and as the father has sent me so send i you the god that sent jesus went in jesus and the jesus that sends you goes in you he that believeth in me the works and i do shall he do also go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature black yellow white brown whatever he might be these signs shall follow and believe while for all the world and every creature a little baptist minister not long ago in tucson came to me said brother branham here's your trouble you're trying to make this an apostolic age he said there is no such a thing as apostolic age today apostolic age is over i said it is i didn't know it and he said well it is i said sure he said sure i'm sure he said all right i said how do you think it's over so that was for the apostles i said peter said on the day of pentecost do you believe his word yes sir he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for this promise isn't to you and to your children and to your children's children and to them it's for all even as many as the lord our god shall call this same promise we've got to come back to it dr simon peter wrote a prescription the bible said is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there well you know if you take a doctor's prescription when he finds the disease that's in your body and he writes that prescription you better fill it get some real drug instead of fill it just the way it's wrote because he has to put in so much poison and so much antidote so much that your system will take you see each it's already been tried and proven and you must take that prescription if you don't you get some quack doctor to go to fooling with that that don't know how to measure out that medicine right he'll kill you and if he puts too much weakness then it won't do you no good and that's what's the matter a lot of you doctors you're full with that prescription peter said i'll give you everlasting prescription for you and your children name is for all even as many as the lord our god shall call not come and join but repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the results the holy ghost father promises prescriptions for you and to your children uh some of you quack doctors quit writing those fake [Music] prescriptions you're killing your people that's the reason the real thing isn't getting to them yes you know on this same prescription how the doctor finds his medicine they always taken the scientists trying to figure up something then they give it to a guinea pig and see if it kills him or not and then you know medicine's got a chance to take you you might get well it might kill you see because all people are not like guinea pigs maybe so but there's one thing about this prescription it's for all and then any real good doctor that got a lot of faith in his own medicine he won't ask somebody else some of them is tired enough to get a prisoner with life tournament and set him free if he lives over let's take this christian but in this place we had a real doctor he come took the prescription himself i am but i will be i am the resurrection and the likes of god he didn't believe it to me though he were dead yet shall he live and who shall ever live and leave it to me shall never die hallelujah he said leaders out of this she said yeah lord i believe that's right the christ that was coming to the world no matter how much the rest of them call you i don't seen it the calvary he took the injection himself and on easter morning that couldn't hold him i am the resurrection and the life they injected death into him but he rose up victorious over the death hell in the grave amen he took the injection himself and he sent out some doctors to write a prescription who had the revelation of who he was who does man say i the son of man am peter said the heart of christ the son of the living god he said blessed art thou simon you've got it now i give you the keys of the kingdom whatever you abide on earth i'll abide in heaven if you loose on earth i loose in heaven and on the day of pentecost when they seen all this going on he said they said what can we do to get this inoculation here you read the prescription he said now i'm going to write a prescription is for you and to your children and to them as far off even as many as the lord our god shall ever call don't fool with the prescription you'll die they make it so weak today so it's nothing but denominational water drawings some embalming food they checked into a dead man to make him deader oh but rather there is a genuine one anointing there is a thanksgiving just for the healing of the soul just don't fool with the prescription take the prescription just the way it's written and god's obligated to his word not obligated to the creed of the dogma or the domination he's obligated to his word follow the prescription that's the first basis start off then you're signed up and ready go to work notice out the camp they have chosen a barabbas today when the gospel has passed back and forth around the world great signs and wonders as follow the revival but instead of coming in and trying to do it they're adjoining right up with barabbas before we'll have this nonsense and so forth in our church we'll be classic like the rest of them now they've got rome and all of them together a barabbas notice we are then in that great camp we are invited to go beyond that kingdom jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go to him beyond the gate watch bearing his reproach what was he reapproached for not because he's methodist or baptist i'll assure you that not because his pharisee a sadducee because he was the vindicated word bearing his reproach for what the vindicated word that's right that's what he did he said if i do not the worst of my father don't believe me if i'm not to answer all the scriptures questions jesus of the new testament was jehovah of the old exactly right i believe his eyes tell you you're not some time ago or somewhere in a meeting it might not have been here jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new you remember the re the when it's going squirrel hunting that morning there it was then three big stems running into one out there around the mountain me standing there looking at it now i drew up close and took off my hat laid down my rifle got up there and a voice shook the woods said jesus of the new testament is jehovah of the old remain faithful so right below there's where the squirrels appeared come into existence when there was none there that's truth it's true so god knows before who i stand it's a true heart it's a tree right down in kentucky and there's people sitting right here tonight was present what happened again the same thing yes we know that it's the truth jesus of the old testament like when the chinese people first come over here they couldn't read or write our language but they were great laundry men and so they would you go down to the chinese laundry he's got him some clear little white tags he couldn't read one thing and he knows you couldn't read it if he wrote it so when you come he just took this little white piece of paper something on this order say right here and he tore it a certain way like that now he give you one piece of paper and he kept the other piece of paper and then when you come back for your laundry he said let me see your piece of paper and he got him if it matched that was it you got your dirty clothes back clean and jesus next every prophecy every design of jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new he matched everything let me say this with godly fear and respect but love but sincerity and knowing where i'm standing the message of this hour has matched everything the bible spoken about [Applause] now if you got some dirty clothes turn them in are you washed in the blood of the lamb notice bearing his reproach because he was the vindicated word as then so is it now he's the same yesterday for every hebrew 13 uh 12 and 13. we find three booze 8 13 8 also bearing his shame of the gospel bearing his name he said i came in my father's name what is the name of the father it came in his father's name that i came in my father's name and you receive me not well what is the father's name i guess you already know bearing the reproach of the word it was always carried out of their camps they turned it out you'll be laughed at made fun of and today or i won't start across the nation not speaking about myself please don't think this is a personal well my time is gone i got about 10 pages sure you can see what's left all right of notes but listen first started out did you notice jesus when he first started oh the young rabbi oh he was a wonderful man come over to our way come preach to us but one day he sat down to them and he said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you what do you think the doctors and intellectuals of the crowd thought this man's a vampire he wants you to drink human blood that's too much for us get away from this the priesthood is crazy i believe it and the bible said they walked away then he had 70 ordained preachers he said i can't have them so he looked around at them he said what will you say when you see the son of man ascending up into heaven from whence he come now he never explained these things he just let him alone and they said son of man what we eat with the man we fish with him we lay on the banks with him we've seen the cradle he was rocked in we know his mother we know his brother who can receive a thing like this and the bible said they walked with him no more then he turned around to peter and the rest of them said a chore was twelve you twelve now from the thousands he's down to twelve he said i chose twelve of anyone if he's the devil i knowed it from the beginning he said now you wanna go with him you didn't have to baby and pet not make you deacon if you join the church neither could the disciples explain it but you remember you just told them i knew you before the foundation of the world i ordained you to receive joy with me there it was before the foundation were predestinated those apostles stood there just disturbed they couldn't explain how they would eat his flesh and drink his blood they couldn't understand how he ever come down before he's been right there with him all the time he couldn't explain it the people couldn't explain it nobody could explain it but peter made those notable words no wonder he gave him the key he said lord who would we go to we are persuaded we know that you and your own are the vindication of the promised word today we know that thou alone has a word of life we can't explain those things but we believe it anyhow [Applause] [Music] little martha said my brother is dead he's laying in the grave he's rotting he's stinking lord if you would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask god god will give it to you oh my he said i am the resurrection life he that believeth to me though you were dead yet shall i live whosoever liveth and believe with me shall ever not believe the south this she said yeah lord i can't explain it but i believe it i believe that you're the christ that was to come into the world i believe by the noted scripture that you beat the qualification of that so where have you buried him something has to happen every wheel's coming right together to right time see walk down to grade the bible said no beauty should which is sorry probably a little stupid shoulder fella stood there little shoulders down tired and weary from walking he said lazarus come forward and a man had been dead four days stood on his feet a christian science woman excuse me if i hurt your feelings i don't mean to a christian science woman right from this church met me out there one day and she said mr branham she said i like your preaching but there's one thing you do too much of on it so watch that said you bragged too much on jesus i said i hope that's all he's got to get asleep [Music] she said you make him divine see they don't believe he was divine they believe he was just an ordinary man good teacher philosopher said you make him divine and he wasn't divine i said oh yes he was she said if i prove to you by your own bible he's not divine but you believe it i said my bible said so i believe the word that's who he is and she said in saint john the 11th chapter when jesus went down to the grave of lazarus the bible said he wept i said well that's got to do with it she said well that showed he wasn't divine i said you just fail to see who the man was he was both god and man is the man weeping when he's weeping for their sorrow but when he stood and said lazarus come forth and a man had been dead four days stood on his feet again that was more than a man yes sir yes indeed never made the expression when he come down off the mountain that night hungry he was a man he was hungry the next morning he was a man but when he took two biscuits and five fish and fed five thousand thickened up seven baskets that was more than a man he was a man on the cross when he cried my god has not forsaken me when he cried give me a drink and he gave him vinegar and gall he was a man crying but on easter morning when he broke every seal of death hell in the grave he was more than a man he was a man that night laying on the back of that little boat where he's out there with the disciples and ten thousand devils of the sea swore they drowned him out there in a little ship like a bottle stopper out there like that he was so tired didn't wake him up he was a man when he was asleep but when he put his foot on the braille the boat looked up at peace be still and the winds and the waves go baby that was more than a man oh one of the poets said he loved me dying he saved me very he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming on glorious days yes sir go beyond the camp i don't care what it costs this consecrated cross i'll bear until death shall set me free then go home a crown to where for there's a crown for me posing i'll say this i was reading a story some time ago on a judge he's a just man a good man love and there's a bunch of people in the city that thought they could get by with anything so he had plenty so they opened up a house of hill fame run a liquor store liquor everything like that it was illegal and it was caught by the law of the federal man and was brought to court and when all the people of city the little city gathered in they know this man had done a lot of things around there the man that had run the ill-famed place and they they the jury found the man guilty because he's called open-handed and so then the judge found him guilty and sentenced them for so many years without bomb without appeal or anything he sent him because that's what the law read the people outside the court raised him and said you know what every person in this town hates you said they hate you by making that decision on that man there was all gamblers themselves and said we we'll all hate you we'll never elect you again we'll never be on one of his football you boo and him as he went down the street he stood just a minute and said let me have a word he said i've done exactly what was my duty the man was guilty no matter who he was and i had to sentence him according to the law that i swore i'd uphold he said you're hated in this town he said but i'm loved greatly at home by my people we might think the same thing if your pardon expression i stood for what i have been saved to do uphold this word of god i know the denominations hate me for the things that i say but i'm greatly loved in his house [Music] [Applause] hey ma'am you know i i felt moved to play this and of course then you know the devil's always there and so i went to my books and i have my books there and they're not in order and i just reached there and i grabbed the book and pulled it out and i thought i know this is the right thing for those of you that are going to camp i played this because i want you to go beyond the camp there's going to be meeting and there's going to be fellowship and there's going to be personalities and social events and but i want you to go beyond this social activity i want you to go beyond the programs and the plays i want you to go beyond the music and the specials and i want you to go beyond the camp so there's a camp going on but you've got to go beyond that camp and meet god personally and what happens in camps is trends are set trends in music and trends in worship and trends and preaching style and and trends in this and trends and that and and there's tastes that are formed we like it preach this way we like it i like to hear it this way i like this and i like that and you got to go beyond all that you've got to go beyond that camp and you you felt the spirit of unity tonight you felt the word of god being broke by the voice that god chose to break it he talked in this message about the prophet and what was said and that's where the spirit of god was and i say you've got to go beyond the camp this weekend beyond the music beyond the the the trend and and don't settle for anything less until you and god and his spoken word and his written word do you have a relationship with it not the worship not the church not the personalities not the pastor but you have gone beyond the camp and and we heard tonight as a congregation we'll never go any farther with god till we can go beyond all our camp and i want to go farther with god don't you i want to go beyond the camp so lord richly bless you tonight we won't keep you long i know you have to get up early and be back here for camp i know some of you want to practice your songs so this is as our flock runs over the word of the lord in my heart to you is go beyond the camp go beyond the camp amen go to that place you have to go alone too where you have to get out of yourself and your own ideas and settle it once and for all it doesn't have to be a shout it doesn't the people will worship and you'll be praising god and that's all wonderful i'm not against those things some people think i am but i'm i'm against it when it becomes a camp and you don't go any farther so let's go beyond the camp this coming week easter week and that's what he said he was man but when he rose on that morning he was god and that's what we serve so let's stand together and let's just power ahead and give us all an opportunity this evening in your heart tonight i know you rejoiced in god's word but if you would look in your heart tonight and you would like to go farther and maybe you've set up a little camp in your life a comfort zone something that you're comfort with just just a style of life everyday living that it just seems to be in the routine and you if god would speak to you you'd want to lift your hand and say lord i want to be able to go beyond the camp when you call i want to be able to leave i want to do what you would have me to do no matter what it is lord i i desire in my heart not to be stuck in a rut our prophet said they went back and got into the same old rut lord i don't want this message to get into the same old rut i want us to go on in the power and the resurrection of easter morning in that personal relationship father because there was a voice in this day that pointed us to christ and we've got to go beyond that father to that place of personal lord it's not a group experience it's an individual revelation and i ask each young person father our own adults that are going and listening to the preaching may they know there's a camp and there's a shout in the camp but may they know deep in their heart they have to go beyond that they have to go into the holy of holies [Music] and eat that manna and be persuaded where else can we go [Music] this message and this word is the words of eternal life until it's so anchored in their soul that my sheep hear my voice [Music] and another they will not follow father i ask you to keep our church safe in their travel and the other churches that are fellowshipping with us here this evening on their way to the same camp may they too go beyond the camp father because that's words to every camp goer to go beyond the camp and lord i just ask that you keep them safe that you speak to them [Music] father that they feel your forgiveness they feel your love and they feel your care they hear your instructions father as you deal with them and may they slip away father to that quiet place and go beyond all the noise and all the shouting and come to that place where they meet you face to face and they meet christ we ask it father that you would grant that in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray oh who is like you lord in all [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] yes you are [Music] oh doing that [Music] your prayers [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] your prayers [Music] god [Music] let's sing that last verse again [Music] [Music] go beyond the campaign [Music] [Applause] [Music] right [Applause] [Music] amen god bless you go in peace pray one for another keep one another in mind take care of one another you don't click up you love everybody god bless you go in peace those are the youth that are meeting go to your meeting place god bless you so [Music] so [Music] you
