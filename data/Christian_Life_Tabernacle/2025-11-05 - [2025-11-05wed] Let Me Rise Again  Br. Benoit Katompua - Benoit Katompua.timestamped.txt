[29:18] Hallelujah. Let's go before him in
[29:20] prayer. Gracious heavenly father,
[29:24] we so thank you and love you, Lord.
[29:28] Surely Lord, without you, Father, we
[29:31] can't make it, Lord.
[29:33] But with you, Lord, what obstacle can
[29:36] stand [music] before? What trial can
[29:39] come against? Lord Jesus, [snorts] with
[29:42] Jesus, all things are [music] possible.
[29:44] Father,
[29:45] Father, you've seen the sacrifice your
[29:47] children have made to come into your
[29:49] house, Lord Jesus. They didn't come to
[29:51] hear from a man, but they came to hear
[29:54] from you, Lord Jesus.
[29:56] If but one [music] thing could be said
[29:58] to them, Lord, that would bless them and
[30:00] they can say it was good to be in the
[30:02] house of the Lord. Father, we ask that
[30:04] you have [music] the preeminence, Lord.
[30:06] Use this vessel, Lord Jesus. Set me
[30:09] aside, Father. [music] You speak to your
[30:11] children, Father. I've got no plan, Lord
[30:15] Jesus. All I've got is your word, Lord
[30:17] [music] Jesus. Father, it's the only
[30:20] weapon you gave us, Lord Jesus. and you
[30:23] made sure that you used it and you
[30:26] showed us, Father, that the same weapon
[30:29] you used, [music] placed in our hands
[30:31] will produce the same results. Lord
[30:33] Jesus, have your way in the service.
[30:36] Father, bless the people, [music] Lord.
[30:39] Again, remember our pastor, Lord Jesus.
[30:42] Be with him and [music] sister Leslie.
[30:43] Father, and all those that are out,
[30:46] Father, we thank you, Lord, [music]
[30:48] asking these things in the wonderful,
[30:50] precious, mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[30:51] Christ.
[30:53] calm my nerves, Lord Jesus.
[30:57] I thank [music] you and I ask this in
[30:58] Jesus name. Amen.
[31:02] Hallelujah. I trust we're all happy to
[31:03] be in the house of the Lord.
[31:06] Thank you, musicians.
[31:10] As you're standing, we'll just turn to
[31:14] uh Micah chapter 7.
[31:18] We're going to read uh just 7 through8
[31:21] and then you may be seated.
[31:39] It reads therefore I will look unto the
[31:42] Lord. I will wait for the God of my
[31:47] salvation. My God will hear me. Rejoice
[31:51] not against me, oh mine enemy. When I
[31:54] fall, I shall rise. When I sit in
[31:58] darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto
[32:01] me. Hallelujah. You may be seated. May
[32:04] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[32:06] of his word.
[32:09] I'm going to start my timer,
[32:12] but I'm not going to say what time I
[32:14] put.
[32:18] So, basically how this works is you
[32:20] pull, I get out of here faster.
[32:24] You don't pull,
[32:26] we'll be here a bit longer.
[32:29] Nevertheless, the word's being preached,
[32:31] so we're excited.
[32:34] I got to just title this uh small
[32:37] thought that I have. Um just following
[32:39] along the same path our pastor's been
[32:41] preaching and the sermon he preached on
[32:43] Sunday really touched me preaching about
[32:46] children of the prophecy and then our
[32:49] fireball
[32:51] preacher.
[32:52] Man, I tell you what, that [snorts] was
[32:55] something else. I enjoyed that. Brother
[32:56] Sergio, I don't know if he's here
[32:58] tonight, but that was good.
[33:01] You know, I I I just I love that we're
[33:03] all different. I love that God uses
[33:06] everybody the way that he's made you.
[33:08] Man, I I can get excited with somebody
[33:10] that's just being who they are. That was
[33:13] awesome. And just on thinking on that
[33:15] thought of child uh children of the
[33:16] prophecy,
[33:18] uh I I had like while studying three or
[33:21] four different sermon thoughts that come
[33:24] to mind. And you know, the struggle is
[33:26] finding the mind of God, man. like,
[33:28] well, Lord, I could go this way. I could
[33:30] go that way. I could do this. I could do
[33:32] that. And then I think while I was here,
[33:37] um, the Lord kind of gave me a title.
[33:40] So, I'm title this small portion of time
[33:43] was spent, let me rise again.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; It it it struck me, right? You know,
[33:49] we're the children of prophecy,
[33:51] &gt;&gt; which means something's been spoken over
[33:54] us,
[33:55] &gt;&gt; which means it's rigged.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; There's there's absolutely no way for
[34:03] you to see yourself being the children
[34:06] of prophecy and yet say, "I can't make
[34:08] it."
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; It doesn't work.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Because his word says one thing.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Your story says another thing. Now we
[34:17] know our prophet taught us that the
[34:20] right attitude, the right mental
[34:22] attitude towards any divine promise of
[34:24] God will bring it to pass.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; So we know we've have prophecy that's
[34:29] been spoken over us. Then the question
[34:31] then becomes, what's our attitude
[34:34] towards those things which he said of
[34:36] us?
[34:38] &gt;&gt; And you know I all you can really do is
[34:40] look at yourself. And looking at myself,
[34:43] I said, "Man, you know, if there's one
[34:45] thing Ben is really good at, it's
[34:47] questioning what God said of him." I I I
[34:51] I'd almost say I have a PhD
[34:54] in questioning what he says of me.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; He says I'm an overcomer. I say the
[35:00] trial's too great.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; He says I'm victorious. I said, "Do you
[35:04] see the giants?"
[35:06] &gt;&gt; But it's it's not that I want to say
[35:08] that. My flesh sees a different story
[35:11] from my spirit.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; In my soul, something cries and says,
[35:15] "I'm more than able."
[35:16] &gt;&gt; But in my flesh, I say, "Man, these
[35:18] giants are great.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; This this trial is is is is too big for
[35:22] me.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Thank be to God, he doesn't look at my
[35:26] flesh.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful when he sees me, he sees
[35:30] his word.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Because he spoke over me."
[35:34] And if Jesus believed everything that
[35:36] was said of him, how much more we, his
[35:39] bride, believe everything that was said
[35:41] of us.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Then it then it got it got me thinking.
[35:45] Brother Brandon would talk about a
[35:46] soldier. He talks about a good soldier.
[35:49] And he says, "A good soldier doesn't lay
[35:52] down, but he gets back up."
[35:56] &gt;&gt; With the amount of punches the devil
[35:58] tries to throw at us on a daily basis. I
[36:01] was talking to brother Matthew in the
[36:02] back there. I had no, you know, my my
[36:05] throat was okay and I had no problems.
[36:07] But the moment it got close to when
[36:09] Billy says, you know, now we're inviting
[36:11] Brother Ben out, all of a sudden my
[36:12] voice and my throat starts to say, "Hey,
[36:15] hey, dude, relax." But I didn't have an
[36:18] issue before.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; But the devil's very slick. He always
[36:22] comes, sometimes he messes up the mic.
[36:24] Sometimes it's somebody said something
[36:26] to you while you were coming to church
[36:28] and you just get into church and you're
[36:30] all you're angry. you're you're
[36:31] flustered and your mind's thinking about
[36:33] what just happened rather than what's
[36:35] about to happen and then you sit there
[36:37] and the words going forth and and you're
[36:40] completely in a different place.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; And I I I just remembered my prophet
[36:44] saying and I'll read it to you. Brother
[36:46] Brandham says the devil tried to give me
[36:48] a cold a while ago so I gave it back to
[36:51] him. He said then he gave it to me again
[36:53] so then I gave it back to him again. He
[36:55] said we went like that for 4 days until
[36:58] finally it was gone. See, sometimes it's
[37:02] as simple as the devil puts a thought in
[37:04] your mind.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Like,
[37:07] I
[37:09] God's in control. The devil puts a
[37:11] thought in your mind and you receive the
[37:14] thought that he gives you because the
[37:16] mind you have is just a receiver.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; You ain't got a thought coming. There's
[37:20] no thought of Ben, thought of you. It's
[37:22] God's thoughts and the devil's thoughts.
[37:24] Then it becomes whose thoughts you
[37:26] entertain, whose thoughts you accept,
[37:28] whose thoughts you receive. All you do
[37:31] is receive.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; So therefore, why would I receive a
[37:34] thought that's not beneficial to what
[37:36] I'm wanting to do?
[37:38] &gt;&gt; If I want to serve God, I'm not going to
[37:40] receive a thought that calls me a
[37:41] sinner.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Why would I do such a thing? I ought to
[37:45] stop thinking those thoughts that put me
[37:47] in that state of mind and think on his
[37:50] thoughts.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; That's the admonition that he gives us.
[37:53] And I remember I believe it was a
[37:56] Tuesday and I I you know you always know
[38:00] when you're about to be called upon.
[38:03] You're all you always know when you're
[38:05] about to be called upon. If you preach,
[38:07] you know this. Something just says
[38:10] something's coming. You know when
[38:12] brother Billy texts you or Brother David
[38:15] and it's a message like God bless you my
[38:17] precious brother. You say ah there's
[38:21] ulterior motives here. He said, "God
[38:23] bless you, precious brother."
[38:26] He says, "How have you been?" And I
[38:28] said, "You've been sent on a mission."
[38:30] He said, "I'm just a messenger."
[38:33] Right? But that's just the way God does
[38:34] things. But that morning when I woke up,
[38:38] the devil put in my mind, "You're going
[38:40] to be depressed today." This is the
[38:42] first thought that came to my mind.
[38:44] You're going to be depressed today.
[38:46] You're going to be sad today. You're
[38:49] going to be in your feelings today. And
[38:52] I said, "Man,
[38:54] what a day this will be."
[38:57] And I just said, "You know what?
[38:59] Whatever you say, devil, whatever
[39:01] thought you put in my mind, this is what
[39:02] I'm going to be today." There's no such
[39:04] thing as I woke up in a bad mood.
[39:08] There's no such thing as I woke up in a
[39:11] bad mood.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; You accepted a bad mood.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; When you wake up,
[39:16] &gt;&gt; you have two options. You can wake up,
[39:19] feel the devil pressing on you a bad
[39:20] mood, and you say, "I'm not going to go
[39:23] this way. I'm going to go a different
[39:25] way." So, when he said, "You're going to
[39:27] be depressed today," I said, "Okay,
[39:28] let's get into the word. Let's see what
[39:31] God has to say about it." And it was
[39:33] really hard for me to stay in a
[39:34] depressed state while feeding on the
[39:37] things of God. God is very simple.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; The devil puts one thought,
[39:42] &gt;&gt; if it's not the word, give it the word.
[39:46] This is the battleground. You're
[39:48] constantly being sent things in your
[39:50] mind. Right now, as you're sitting,
[39:52] you're constantly being sent things in
[39:54] your mind. Why do I have to listen to
[39:56] this person?
[39:58] &gt;&gt; What does he know? How old is he?
[40:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't know nothing. He ain't been in
[40:03] this message long enough.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; But the word's the same, is it not?
[40:08] &gt;&gt; If a child came up here and read to you
[40:09] in the beginning, God said, "Is that not
[40:11] the word?"
[40:12] Nevertheless, look past the vessel, but
[40:14] look at the word that's being spoken.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; So, I, you know, I I started to feed on
[40:20] the word and I got out of that mindset
[40:21] of depression that the devil was trying
[40:23] to put me under. Then it struck me
[40:27] even a son and daughter of God,
[40:30] even after you've been you've received
[40:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you know,
[40:35] brother Brandham says that's the land
[40:37] that was promised to you to the children
[40:39] of Israel. It was a holy land. But to
[40:42] us, the Holy Ghost is our land.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; And when they got in their land,
[40:48] remember, they were told to fight for
[40:51] every inch of ground.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; So, it's not just, oh, I've received the
[40:55] Holy Ghost. That means I've completely
[40:58] possessed the land. You may have the
[41:00] earnest of that land. You may have the
[41:03] title deed of that land. But don't think
[41:06] you're just going to do nothing. There's
[41:08] a fight that has to take place every
[41:11] single day with the land he's given you.
[41:15] It is your land, right? It is your Holy
[41:18] Spirit, right? Therefore, when something
[41:21] comes against you that doesn't match the
[41:24] land he's given you, you got a right to
[41:26] fight with the land he's given you. It's
[41:29] yours.
[41:31] Brother Brandham says, "I got lots of
[41:34] respects for a man. When he does make a
[41:37] mistake, he's got courage enough to rise
[41:40] and try again."
[41:41] &gt;&gt; This is in faith once delivered to the
[41:43] saints. He says, "But a soldier is not
[41:46] one who will lay down when he's knocked
[41:48] down, but will rise up again." We used
[41:51] to sing a little song, "Let me rise
[41:52] again and try again." And I like that.
[41:55] For I have made many mistakes in my
[41:57] life, as we all have. But I've always
[42:00] been thankful to God for grace to let me
[42:02] rise and try again. I believe the song
[42:05] is entitled, "Forgive me, Lord, and try
[42:08] me one more time." I think that's it.
[42:10] I'll be yours if you'll be mine. If I
[42:13] fall or if I sin, let me rise again. Try
[42:17] me back and try me one more time. This I
[42:21] love that. That's why I'm trusting that
[42:24] God will do this great body of Christ
[42:26] here on earth tonight.
[42:28] who was we all are guilty of doing
[42:31] things wrong.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Every single one of us is guilty of
[42:37] doing things wrong.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; This is what he says. But may we who are
[42:43] gathered here tonight, there's a
[42:45] blessing for you that are here tonight
[42:46] along with the rest of the great visible
[42:49] body of Christ on earth. May we rise
[42:52] again and try again.
[42:55] Amen.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; See, the devil likes to put you a son
[42:58] and daughter of God in a condition where
[43:02] you think because you had an experience
[43:04] with God that something took place with
[43:07] you that you make one mistake and all of
[43:10] a sudden you're no longer the child of
[43:12] prophecy.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; It's it's not because you made the
[43:15] mistake that took you off because it
[43:17] wasn't your perfection that put you on.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; It's the mere fact that he elected you.
[43:22] He chose you. He didn't do it with what
[43:26] what you would do in terms of sin in
[43:28] mind. In fact, you'll hear a bit later
[43:30] our prophet will say God knew your
[43:33] weaknesses. He knew everything, your
[43:36] habits, your nature. And after looking
[43:39] throughout the all the universe, he
[43:41] turns around and says, "I choose you."
[43:44] &gt;&gt; It's all man.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; But then we sit there and say, and we're
[43:47] always beating oursel up time and time
[43:50] again because you fall and you make
[43:51] mistakes. You're constantly beating
[43:54] yourself up and God looks at you like
[43:56] did not choose you.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; What are you doing?
[43:59] &gt;&gt; I chose you. You didn't choose me.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; I chose you. I elected you. In fact, I
[44:05] put everything you would have need of in
[44:08] you.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; But somehow we forget that prophecy that
[44:14] was spoken over us
[44:16] &gt;&gt; and we just every time we fall, you just
[44:18] beat yourself up. constantly thinking,
[44:21] constantly thinking there's a work to be
[44:23] done.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; A child of prophecy
[44:28] &gt;&gt; is one who his life has been spoken
[44:33] over.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Remember, David was anointed,
[44:38] &gt;&gt; but he didn't get anointed and then
[44:40] automatically become king.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; There was a process that took place
[44:45] before he then became king. So you are a
[44:48] child of prophecy. You will come to the
[44:51] maturity which the word says you will.
[44:54] But there is a process.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; There is a training ground you have to
[44:58] go through before you reach that stature
[45:01] of maturity.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, we we get the
[45:06] attitude of of of Balum. Does God change
[45:10] his mind about his word? God will anoint
[45:13] you for something. You know, you're a
[45:15] child of prophecy and automatically you
[45:17] want to go work.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Rather than waiting,
[45:20] &gt;&gt; being patient, saying, "Lord, is this
[45:23] the time?
[45:24] &gt;&gt; I know you've called me. I know you want
[45:26] me to do this, but right now, is this
[45:28] the time for that to be done?" We get
[45:30] ahead of God's plan. But if you're a son
[45:34] and you're a daughter and you know what
[45:36] the word says of you, you can remain
[45:39] still in the place that you're at
[45:42] trusting that that promise which he
[45:45] spoke will come to me.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; I got to say it cuz it comes to mind.
[45:50] Often times what happens with a lot of
[45:52] young girls and even young boys is your
[45:55] mind gets so wrapped up in finding a
[45:57] mate when you're young and you have no
[46:01] business thinking about finding a mate.
[46:03] Yet that's all that encompasses your
[46:05] mind. It's God's promise to you. He said
[46:09] after salvation, the greatest gift he
[46:12] could give a man was a wife. So
[46:14] therefore, you receive salvation,
[46:18] feed, and stay in the word. He brings
[46:21] the bride. It's his gift to you. But if
[46:24] you get out of order, you get one
[46:27] experience with God. I had an experience
[46:28] when I was 13 and I found my boyfriend.
[46:30] Huh?
[46:32] But this is what happens. I know I was
[46:35] there. This is what takes place. You
[46:37] think you've done something with God now
[46:39] and all of a sudden I that can't be my
[46:41] alarm.
[46:44] We still got 30 hours left. So that that
[46:48] can't be my circumstance.
[46:51] But this is what happens in our mind.
[46:54] There's an appointed time for
[46:56] everything.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Don't rush the plan of God.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; The prophecy that's been spoken over you
[47:02] will be fulfilled
[47:04] &gt;&gt; in the time he planned for it to be
[47:06] fulfilled.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; You can rejoice when you're single. You
[47:11] can rejoice when you're by yourself.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; There is a joy in that. Seek God. Stay
[47:18] with him. It's just you and him. Dwell
[47:20] there.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody who's married could be able to
[47:24] echo that even greater than I. But then
[47:26] in my little revelation understanding
[47:28] that I have, all I know is there's
[47:31] something about just you and God.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And then when he sends you the right
[47:36] mate, there's such a union. It still
[47:38] becomes you and God because the both of
[47:40] you become one
[47:42] &gt;&gt; and you keep him at the center.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says
[47:48] and the only thing you have to do to
[47:51] know he is here is get yourself out the
[47:54] way. This is just once more. Lord see as
[47:57] long as you're in the way then God
[48:00] cannot do nothing for you. When you
[48:02] think your thoughts then God's thoughts
[48:05] don't have a chance. Yeah,
[48:07] &gt;&gt; the verbiage in which what God uses is
[48:09] interesting because if you think your
[48:12] thoughts,
[48:14] &gt;&gt; God's thoughts don't have a chance.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; A man asked brother Brandham the
[48:18] question, brother Brandham, I want to
[48:20] know how to separate between my thought,
[48:21] God thoughts, and the devil's thoughts.
[48:24] Brother Brandham tells him, well, God's
[48:25] thoughts are the word. Anything contrary
[48:27] to that is the devil's thoughts. That
[48:29] was the answer. He said, well, what
[48:30] about my thoughts? You ain't got one
[48:33] coming. There is no your thoughts. What
[48:36] the devil makes you think is that those
[48:38] thoughts that come into your mind that
[48:39] you know ain't God's thoughts is your
[48:41] thoughts. He tries to blur the line and
[48:44] say you thought of that.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; That was you. But we heard on Sunday you
[48:49] didn't want to go that way. You were
[48:52] tricked into that.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; We all heard the same sermon Sunday, did
[48:56] we not?
[48:57] &gt;&gt; This is what our prophet said. So what
[48:59] am I to identify with? Am I going to
[49:02] identify with the thoughts that come
[49:03] into my mind that aren't God's thoughts?
[49:06] Or will I identify with the thoughts of
[49:08] God? Regardless of what takes place,
[49:11] regardless of what he tries to throw at
[49:13] you, you have to remember you were not
[49:16] the failure, but you are what he said of
[49:20] you.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; It struck me. Let us rise again.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; You weren't made to be laid down for all
[49:28] time. There's a work to do. You can't
[49:31] work and sleep. You got to get out of
[49:34] bed.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; But some of us get too comfortable
[49:37] laying down. They say, "Well, I'm just
[49:39] beat up. The devil's just been telling
[49:41] me this. Devil been whatever
[49:42] circumstance, man. I've been praying for
[49:44] this thing. You don't understand,
[49:45] brother Ben, this healing. I've been
[49:46] desiring this healing and it just hasn't
[49:48] been coming. I've been wanting this and
[49:50] this hasn't been coming. Man, I done
[49:52] pray. I had this person pray for me.
[49:53] I've been seeking for a baby. I've been
[49:55] wanting this thing for so long. This
[49:57] minister prayed. That minister prayed.
[49:59] This minister prayed. That minister
[50:00] prayed. You could have 10 million
[50:02] ministers pray for you. For God to give
[50:04] you a child. Understand one thing. There
[50:07] is appointed time for it. If he did it
[50:10] with Abraham and there was an appointed
[50:13] time for him. There is an appointed time
[50:15] for you. Regardless of how long it takes
[50:18] for the fulfillment of that prophecy
[50:20] that he gave you, it's his business to
[50:23] bring it to pass.
[50:26] He says,
[50:28] "I I I loved it." He said, "What? What
[50:30] about that, brother Mike? Isn't that
[50:32] wonderful?" He loved you. He loved you
[50:35] before there was a world. He knowed your
[50:38] nature. He knowed your weakness. He
[50:40] knowed your habits. He knowed all about
[50:43] you, what you was going to be. And then
[50:46] he looked all over the great universe as
[50:48] it was. He said, "I choose you." And
[50:51] when he did that, before there ever was
[50:53] a speck of light, when you're eternal
[50:55] with God, when you receive the Holy
[50:57] Ghost, then you become eternal because
[51:00] you have you're with God. You're a part
[51:03] of God. Can you see what I mean? You are
[51:06] as eternal as God is.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. You what that'll do to
[51:13] somebody. I'm as eternal as God is. That
[51:17] means I had no beginning. Therefore, in
[51:19] my mind, when I go back, man, the first
[51:21] sin I ever committed, nope, that's not
[51:23] first. Go all the way back to your real
[51:24] beginning. Because it wasn't that sin
[51:26] that started your beginning. It was when
[51:28] he thought of you in the beginning. And
[51:31] as as I was reading this, I said, "Oh,
[51:33] man, that's so good." It got me thinking
[51:34] of the farmer that that that went to the
[51:37] uh the farm to go find himself a bride.
[51:40] And there was a bunch of a bunch of uh
[51:42] sisters there, and he wanted one. They
[51:46] showed him this one. They showed him
[51:47] that one. and showed him this one. He
[51:48] said, "Oh man, h he went out. He saw one
[51:52] that was cleaning. Saw one that was just
[51:55] doing her chores. He says, "I'll be back
[51:58] for you in a year." And it didn't
[52:00] matter. She now she's telling them he he
[52:03] he said he'd be back for me. He said he
[52:06] chose me. In fact, he said he chose me.
[52:10] And everybody's, "Oh, he couldn't have
[52:12] chose you when I'm an option.
[52:15] Why would God pick you? Why would you be
[52:18] the one God wants to use? This is what
[52:21] your flesh tells you every day. If you
[52:23] get real with yourself, this is what it
[52:25] tells you. Why would God use you?
[52:28] Why would you be the one to fulfill
[52:30] that? What can you do? You don't see all
[52:33] your faults, all your mistakes, all all
[52:35] your everything that you've ever done.
[52:37] You don't see the sin you just committed
[52:39] yesterday.
[52:41] You don't see the kind of person all
[52:42] this stuff the flesh just points and
[52:44] throws at you. Yet he said, "I'd be back
[52:47] for you."
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And she every single day from that point
[52:51] was getting ready.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Preparing to meet him. She took him at
[52:57] his word.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; If she could do that,
[53:01] &gt;&gt; how much more we take him at his word?
[53:04] Amen.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; When he says this bride will do the
[53:09] greater works.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; That's his prophecy.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what you see. It's his
[53:15] business.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; He says,
[53:25] "Now if if faith cometh by hearing of
[53:28] the word," this is in a
[53:31] blind a blind Barnameus.
[53:33] He said uh preached in 54 I believe
[53:36] 540402.
[53:39] Now if faith cometh by hearing hearing
[53:41] of the word and he knew that Jesus came
[53:43] by he couldn't say now wait I might see
[53:47] him another day I'll try tomorrow night
[53:50] at the next meeting. He didn't have that
[53:52] opportunity. I begin to remember the
[53:55] condition that I was in. When you go to
[53:58] service after service after service you
[54:00] come here on Wednesday. You come here on
[54:02] Sunday. You go to camp services and
[54:04] constantly your heart and this is the
[54:07] condition people are actually in. Your
[54:09] heart says I want to surrender.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Everything in you cries I want to
[54:14] surrender.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; But right when you say that something
[54:19] else says but I can't.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; I've tried.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; And it hasn't worked.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; And then you the next service comes
[54:29] around. You get so charged up, you're
[54:32] like, "Oh, yes. I want to surrender,
[54:35] Lord. I want to surrender." Then right
[54:38] when you get out of that atmosphere,
[54:39] that voice comes right back again, "But
[54:42] I can't because I've tried." And time
[54:46] and time again, you're just trying and
[54:49] trying and trying and trying, and God
[54:52] just sits back. You know, Brother
[54:54] Brandham says, "God waits for you to
[54:56] exhaust your efforts,
[54:58] &gt;&gt; then he comes on the scene,
[55:00] &gt;&gt; and the devil's just sitting there.
[55:02] You're not doing enough.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; You've tried this many times and it
[55:05] hasn't worked." What's to say it's going
[55:06] to work? Now, who's to say any of your
[55:09] efforts are going to be valid? How many
[55:12] times have you tried? How many times
[55:14] you've come to the altar and you cried
[55:15] and you prayed? How many times did you
[55:17] do those things? I made the effort. I
[55:19] stood up. I walked over there and I
[55:22] still didn't get it. This is the devil
[55:25] in your mind constantly. See what what
[55:28] he's forgetting is the scripture says
[55:30] pray without ceasing.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; If all your effort is just coming up,
[55:34] don't stop coming up.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Keep coming up.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; But at some point, you got to get to the
[55:39] point where you say, "This is the last
[55:42] time.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving here till I get what I
[55:46] came for."
[55:47] And until you get that, you will come
[55:51] time and time and time and time again
[55:55] trying.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; It won't work. You have to really come
[56:01] to a place where you say, "Lord, I
[56:04] cannot do this. I don't have the ability
[56:08] to."
[56:08] &gt;&gt; This is blind Barnameus. He's blind.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; He can't see.
[56:16] But all he hears there's is there
[56:18] there's a man. Who's that? Who's that?
[56:20] Who's that? Oh, it's Jesus of Nazareth.
[56:22] And he he says, "Oh, all I can do is cry
[56:25] out. All I've got is one last cry. If
[56:30] I've ever cried before, this will be the
[56:32] moment. Lord, I need you to hear me." I
[56:35] I I can't say it like our prophet. I'll
[56:37] read it to you. He says,
[56:39] "He didn't have that opportunity. That
[56:41] was his first and last opportunity.
[56:46] The only opportunity he ever had or ever
[56:49] would have to ever receive his sight.
[56:53] So he had to do something. He raised and
[56:57] screamed to the top of his voice,
[56:59] "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
[57:02] me."
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Have mercy on me. There Jesus facing up
[57:07] the road. A road that you and I tonight,
[57:09] all of us are guilty of sending him up
[57:13] that road.
[57:15] Oh, how the devil loves guilt. You're
[57:18] the reason he died.
[57:20] It's your iniquities. You just
[57:22] constantly can't. You know, somebody
[57:24] will get into such a place. They'll say,
[57:26] "I've given God everything, but this one
[57:29] thing, I just don't know how to give it
[57:31] to him. I can't seem to surrender. this
[57:34] one thing.
[57:36] That's an honest heart that'll say,
[57:38] "Brother, I've given him everything, but
[57:41] this one thing, I don't know how to
[57:44] surrender it."
[57:46] You know, I I I'd like to believe all of
[57:48] us have that same one thing. It's human
[57:51] ability.
[57:53] You We can't seem to give up human
[57:55] ability. We always want something to do.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; We always want a part to play.
[58:02] There's just something I have to do.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; But we have to master human ability.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; You know, God said he put Moses on the
[58:11] backside so he could lose all his human
[58:13] ability.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; When he finally got to that place, he's
[58:17] stuttering. He doesn't think of himself
[58:19] as an educated person anymore. After God
[58:21] uninstalled everything he had learned,
[58:23] then God said, "Now I can use you." You
[58:26] know, I don't like swimming because I
[58:28] can't swim. This is a very interesting
[58:31] thing. They say get in the water and
[58:32] just let yourself float.
[58:36] I don't know about that one. What do you
[58:38] mean let yourself float? You mean I have
[58:40] to give up control to stay above the
[58:43] waves? You mean I have to give up
[58:45] control in order to float through the
[58:47] trials?
[58:48] &gt;&gt; You mean I have to give up control so I
[58:50] can make it through? It's like, yeah,
[58:52] you love control. We're all control
[58:55] freaks.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; I want something to do with it. And I I
[59:00] couldn't tell you. I you I went to
[59:02] school, college, all of it. Every time
[59:05] you see this pool is, "Oh man, you know
[59:06] how to swim?" Like, "No, do you want to
[59:08] learn?" I I sure do want to learn. I had
[59:10] one problem though, water's involved.
[59:13] If I can learn without water, we're all
[59:14] in good hands. But I can't. Is it just
[59:18] let go? Just surrender. I can't fathom
[59:21] in my mind letting go and letting the
[59:25] water do what it does. What does water
[59:29] do?
[59:30] And why do I put my trust in water when
[59:34] all I've seen people drown?
[59:37] Somebody fighting. And I I will never
[59:39] forget it. I was I was that kid. My
[59:43] dad's here tonight. It's the first time
[59:45] he's hearing this story. I snuck out the
[59:48] house one time in elementary school.
[59:50] Went to the pool. Shouldn't have been
[59:52] there. And I was pushing people in the
[59:54] pool
[59:56] because that's the kind of kid that I
[59:57] was. Everybody had to taste the water
[1:00:00] except the one that couldn't swim till
[1:00:03] finally I got pushed in the water in the
[1:00:06] deep end. And I said, "Lord, if this is
[1:00:09] the way I go,
[1:00:11] this ain't right."
[1:00:14] In my in my little finite mind, well,
[1:00:16] your body naturally goes up for air two
[1:00:18] times. I don't know where I got that
[1:00:20] from, but my body went up two times
[1:00:23] naturally for air. I hadn't I didn't do
[1:00:25] nothing. I'm fighting the water. You
[1:00:27] ever see someone trying to climb stairs
[1:00:29] in the water? I'm trying to get out of
[1:00:31] the water as fast as I can. But every
[1:00:34] effort I'm making is just sinking me. I
[1:00:37] can imagine now with the way that I am
[1:00:39] now structured how that would look like
[1:00:42] even now getting into a body of water.
[1:00:45] That would be a very interesting scene.
[1:00:48] So, I'm wise. I stay away from things
[1:00:50] that I I'm not getting in water that I
[1:00:53] can't stand in.
[1:00:55] But see, you didn't have a choice. You
[1:00:58] were thrown into the deep end.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Just surrender.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Just give it to me. I'll help you
[1:01:06] through." And all we keep thinking about
[1:01:08] is how deep the water is, what's in the
[1:01:11] water, all the animals, all the things
[1:01:13] that could kill us, the dangers and
[1:01:14] everything. God says, "Just surrender.
[1:01:17] Just give it to me. I'll set you
[1:01:19] through. You'll walk with me. I'll be
[1:01:21] the And and you God's just telling you
[1:01:23] time and time again, give it to me. No,
[1:01:25] but you don't understand. Lord, I'm in
[1:01:27] the ocean. I'm in the depths, the
[1:01:29] Mariana Trench, the deepest place I
[1:01:30] know. I don't know how to get out. God
[1:01:34] just says, "Oh yes, come on. Surrender."
[1:01:37] You said, "No, Lord. If I was in the
[1:01:39] kiddie pool, I'd be better at
[1:01:40] surrendering." No. If you was in the
[1:01:42] kitty pool, you'd try to get out
[1:01:43] yourself.
[1:01:45] That's why you're not in the kiddie
[1:01:46] pool. This world we live in is the deep
[1:01:48] end.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; This is the ocean and you're thrown in
[1:01:52] it. Survive.
[1:01:55] I you I see those videos. They throw
[1:01:56] those babies in the water and they get
[1:01:58] to swim. I'm what?
[1:02:00] That's that's murder to me. But but the
[1:02:04] kid knows how to for some reason they're
[1:02:06] just
[1:02:08] and they're staying above the water. But
[1:02:10] I get in there do the same motions and
[1:02:12] I'm sinking.
[1:02:15] didn't make no sense.
[1:02:17] Then Jesus facing the road, he said, "We
[1:02:19] put him on there." On that road, he
[1:02:22] knowed he was going to Gethsemane. He
[1:02:24] was going to a Pilate's judgment hall.
[1:02:27] He was to be beaten, mocked, and then
[1:02:29] his great gifts of God was to be put at
[1:02:31] a trial, going to put a rag around his
[1:02:34] head and smack him on the head and say,
[1:02:36] "Now, if you know all what's in the
[1:02:40] people's hearts and minds, tell me who
[1:02:42] hit you." All those things faced him, a
[1:02:45] quivering, bittering death. There he had
[1:02:49] to face. He knew also hanging in his
[1:02:52] mind that he was going up to have his
[1:02:54] hands placed around a pole, his clothes
[1:02:57] stripped off of him, and lashes that
[1:02:59] would burn plum into the bone was going
[1:03:02] around him, and his blood would bathe
[1:03:05] his sides, and a cruel thorn crown would
[1:03:08] be placed on his head, and he'd be
[1:03:10] nailed to a cross and hang there,
[1:03:13] bleeding, bleeding, dying as the most
[1:03:17] bloody sacrifice was ever offered in the
[1:03:20] You see, when our prophet begins to
[1:03:22] describe what it was Jesus went through
[1:03:26] and when he was doing it, you were in
[1:03:29] mind,
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; I was in mind. It makes you feel this
[1:03:33] big
[1:03:35] because you you realize at what cost it
[1:03:38] really came at, but yet this is his
[1:03:41] attitude knowing what's about to happen.
[1:03:46] Sometimes we we we're in a trial and
[1:03:48] there's a need that comes up
[1:03:51] and we're so fixated on the trial we're
[1:03:53] in,
[1:03:55] we can't even attend to the need that's
[1:03:57] just come up because brother, I can't
[1:04:00] help you. I'm going through this trial.
[1:04:02] Sister, I can't I'm going through this.
[1:04:05] This is our Lord and Savior.
[1:04:07] But look what our prophet says about him
[1:04:11] and all of that confronting him and he's
[1:04:14] walking. I can see him in his air of
[1:04:17] quietness as he walked straight and the
[1:04:20] disciples going on putting the people
[1:04:22] off the road. And to think what little
[1:04:26] chance with all of that hanging before
[1:04:29] him did this poor unseen unthought of
[1:04:33] blind beggar clutched against the wall.
[1:04:37] when businessmen come by half, one half,
[1:04:41] not even a speck of authority to the
[1:04:43] size of this would pass by him without
[1:04:46] giving him a penny. But yet, how's he
[1:04:49] going to attract that man?
[1:04:53] With one thing, thou son of David, have
[1:04:57] mercy on me.
[1:05:00] And to think with all that, he says,
[1:05:03] with all that hanging in front of Jesus,
[1:05:06] that blind beggar's cry stopped him
[1:05:10] still in his tracks.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; He stopped.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Oh friend, his love and compassion for
[1:05:19] the sick was so great till no matter
[1:05:22] what the task was ahead of him, he is
[1:05:25] always willing to minister to those in
[1:05:28] need.
[1:05:29] It stopped him still. A cry from an
[1:05:33] unprivileged, from a blind beggar, an
[1:05:36] old ragged beggar standing by the side
[1:05:39] of the wall. Stop the son of God still
[1:05:42] in his journey.
[1:05:45] I begin to look at myself honestly
[1:05:50] and say, "Do I have the same character
[1:05:52] he has?"
[1:05:56] Sometimes you really have to look
[1:05:58] inward.
[1:06:00] Say, "Man,
[1:06:02] Father, I I I need more of you.
[1:06:06] If if I'm honest, I don't know what I
[1:06:08] would do. I don't I don't think I I
[1:06:11] don't think I'd have the same attitude
[1:06:13] with all that's about to happen and all
[1:06:15] that going over your mind."
[1:06:18] See, that that's why I'm so glad God
[1:06:21] didn't tell us what we'd have to go
[1:06:23] through.
[1:06:25] Because if we did, we wouldn't choose
[1:06:27] this life. If you're really honest with
[1:06:30] yourself, you would not choose this
[1:06:32] life. If God told you everything you
[1:06:35] would have to go through,
[1:06:37] you'd count your costs. You'd say, "Man,
[1:06:42] this is just the flesh man, because he
[1:06:44] doesn't count the inheritance of God for
[1:06:46] any value. The spirit man does." But the
[1:06:49] flesh man says, "You mean I'm going to
[1:06:51] be beaten, stricken, embarrassed,
[1:06:54] pierced, whipped,
[1:06:59] bloody,
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; all that
[1:07:02] for a people that had given every chance
[1:07:05] they could
[1:07:07] would sin against me."
[1:07:12] That's us. Iniquity, you know, you
[1:07:15] shouldn't be doing that. You know that
[1:07:17] sin that's holding you, you know you got
[1:07:19] no business doing it,
[1:07:22] but yet you keep doing it.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; You only give it as much power. It only
[1:07:28] has as much power as you give it,
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; but you keep holding on to that thing.
[1:07:34] Brothers, I sisters, I
[1:07:38] that's piercing
[1:07:40] that that hits the soul.
[1:07:44] Would
[1:07:47] we say,
[1:07:49] "I'm still going to die for you.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; You need me.
[1:07:55] I'm still going to die for you." He
[1:07:57] looked at you and I. He said, "Though I
[1:08:00] know tomorrow, you'll still sin.
[1:08:03] I love you.
[1:08:05] I'm choosing you because I know the end
[1:08:08] of the matter.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I know the end of the matter.
[1:08:14] You mean my son, my daughter that's
[1:08:18] disrespectful, that doesn't listen, does
[1:08:21] everything that I say not to do,
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; is run away with that boy, run away with
[1:08:25] that girl, smoking and drinking, living
[1:08:28] a life that's unclean. You mean that
[1:08:31] that child of mine?
[1:08:35] Yeah, I know the end of the matter.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; No, but you don't understand, God. I I
[1:08:41] I'm getting sick thinking about my boy.
[1:08:45] I'm getting sick thinking about my
[1:08:47] daughter. It's troubling me to know that
[1:08:50] they're living that kind of a life when
[1:08:53] we've been given such a promise.
[1:08:56] I can't sleep at night. I don't know
[1:08:58] what they're doing. I don't know how
[1:09:00] they're living.
[1:09:02] Yeah, I know the end of the matter.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, it's too much for me. This is us.
[1:09:10] Our little peanut brains only sees the
[1:09:14] trial,
[1:09:16] only sees the problem. But if we could
[1:09:19] just stop for a moment and say, "God,
[1:09:22] I'm not going to think about the
[1:09:24] problem. I'm going to think about the
[1:09:26] solution giver."
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; It's you. You're in the problem. As long
[1:09:32] as Christ is there, you have a promise.
[1:09:36] This is what makes a child of prophecy.
[1:09:39] No matter what goes on, no matter what
[1:09:42] takes place, you know where you're
[1:09:44] resting,
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; what you're standing on, it's none other
[1:09:49] than Christ the word himself.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; And when he says something, it always
[1:09:55] comes to pass.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; I know the end of the matter.
[1:10:00] But
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:10:03] my soul
[1:10:05] believes everything you're saying.
[1:10:08] But what do I do about this text I just
[1:10:11] got?
[1:10:13] He's insulting me. I I gave them to you.
[1:10:17] I prayed. I don't know why I'm here. I
[1:10:20] prayed for that boy. I prayed for that
[1:10:24] girl. I I dedicated her to you. And this
[1:10:28] is where she Lord, I I know you said you
[1:10:31] got it. I know you said you know the end
[1:10:33] of the matter. But Father, I
[1:10:37] it seems too big.
[1:10:40] There's no way this is going to I ah
[1:10:43] Lord, I don't want to say nothing's
[1:10:44] impossible to you, Lord, but this is
[1:10:47] really what happens to us. You know what
[1:10:50] the word says. This is just an example.
[1:10:53] Put your situation in there. You know
[1:10:55] what the word says about it,
[1:10:58] but every other thought except what he
[1:11:00] said about it comes into your mind as
[1:11:02] constantly flooding to make you question
[1:11:04] and reason and doubt. Did he not say
[1:11:07] he'd give you your children?
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; That's a prophecy, is it not? It's a
[1:11:11] promise, it will come to pass.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Did he not say the barren shall have
[1:11:16] children? I think he said it. If it's a
[1:11:19] promise, it'll come to pass.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Did he not say the prodigals would come
[1:11:23] home? I believe he said it. The lame
[1:11:25] would walk. Yes, they will. The blind
[1:11:27] shall see. Yes, they shall.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; These are his promises.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; But we we get so fixated on the wrong
[1:11:35] thoughts
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; that don't give you the hope and the
[1:11:39] faith to know it's a finished work
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; that you still But there's just
[1:11:45] something I have to do. It it it gets to
[1:11:48] the point you will go to anybody. Hey,
[1:11:50] talk to my boy. Talk to my daughter.
[1:11:53] Send them a text, something. Don't tell
[1:11:55] them I told you what they're going
[1:11:56] through. I know they're questioning this
[1:11:58] message. They don't know if this message
[1:12:00] teaches you how to live daytoday.
[1:12:03] Man, these other nominal churches, they
[1:12:05] really help you on the day-to-day
[1:12:06] living. Oh, when their eyes get open
[1:12:09] like blind Barameus, when that sight
[1:12:11] gets fixed, they'll realize the world
[1:12:14] might teach you how to live daily here,
[1:12:16] but this message teaches you how to get
[1:12:18] out of here. It's completely different.
[1:12:21] We're not trying to dwell here and stay
[1:12:23] here. We're trying to leave here.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; They might preach a good sermon. They
[1:12:29] might have preach it in more sincerity
[1:12:32] than us at times. But you're a child of
[1:12:35] prophecy.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; He said something about you.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; There's a promise about you.
[1:12:43] He says,
[1:12:46] "The son of God still in his journey."
[1:12:50] Brother Brandham says, "Your cry tonight
[1:12:54] will stop him.
[1:12:56] He's passing through here tonight. Your
[1:12:59] cry will stop him."
[1:13:04] Every time we come to church, if this
[1:13:06] isn't our attitude, we're missing the
[1:13:09] purpose of church. Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; I come to meet him.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; I come to have fellowship with him.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; I come to be endued with something I can
[1:13:20] live by.
[1:13:22] Our prophet tells us your cry.
[1:13:25] If you've got a need in your heart for
[1:13:28] something, he's speaking to you. Your
[1:13:31] cry will stop him tonight.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; My problem's too little. He didn't ask
[1:13:36] how big the problem was. He said, "Your
[1:13:39] cry will stop him tonight.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; My problem's too big. It has this, this,
[1:13:44] this." He didn't ask how big the problem
[1:13:46] was. Your cry will stop him tonight.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Church, what's the cry?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Stop him.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; You want the Holy Ghost, stop him.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; You want the doubt to be removed, stop
[1:14:01] him. Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Because God will give it to you
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; and the devil will make you doubt it
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; and then you lose the joy of what he
[1:14:08] gave you
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; and you start questioning whether you
[1:14:11] have it and you're seeking after
[1:14:13] something he already gave you.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; There's more to be done.
[1:14:20] Don't just stop there. Brother Brandham
[1:14:21] admonishes us. He said the Pentecostals
[1:14:24] got excited at the gifts and they
[1:14:25] stopped
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; when they were supposed to press on to
[1:14:28] maturity
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; to perfection. That's right.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Don't do away with the gift.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Press on to perfection.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Let God take control of the gift.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Let him take control of the all of them.
[1:14:42] They're all blessings for the church.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; But press on towards perfection.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Don't dwell.
[1:14:50] [snorts]
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:14:53] "Your cry will stop him." He said,
[1:14:56] "What? Bring him here to me?
[1:15:01] I just love those small statements like
[1:15:03] when Jesus says, "I have need to go by
[1:15:06] Samaria." He had a need.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Really, his need was hers.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; She needed something she didn't know she
[1:15:15] needed.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; And when she met that thing, she was
[1:15:19] never the same.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the same thing with us. if we
[1:15:23] only really knew what we needed and how
[1:15:26] much more he needs it for us more than
[1:15:28] we.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; He wants to see you be that way.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; He [snorts] cares more about you living
[1:15:33] a Holy Ghost sold out perfect life than
[1:15:37] you care about overcoming those things
[1:15:39] you struggle.
[1:15:41] He wants to see it more for you. Father,
[1:15:44] if I can just take that thought that
[1:15:46] says you want to see it more for me than
[1:15:48] I and I think on that thought, what'll
[1:15:51] happen in my life when I start thinking
[1:15:53] like you think?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, this trial, my God's greater.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, this circumstance, my God's greater.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:16:04] "Bring him here to me." And they brought
[1:16:08] and and they brought when they my Now I
[1:16:12] want you to notice another dramatic
[1:16:13] thing here. Wish we had time to go into
[1:16:16] it. Something come to mind. Now notice
[1:16:19] he didn't know he was going to find him.
[1:16:23] The only thing he knowed he sat in a
[1:16:25] dark world he'd never seen.
[1:16:29] But there he raised up throwed aside his
[1:16:33] old ragged coat. It had been an hour
[1:16:36] before that if he'd have lost that coat
[1:16:39] or if he'd have to lay it down, he'd
[1:16:41] fold it neatly and laid it to one side
[1:16:44] because he knowed he couldn't find it
[1:16:46] anymore. He was blind and hardly anybody
[1:16:49] would help him. But now faith takes a
[1:16:52] hold. Faith springs on what? I've
[1:16:56] attracted the attention of the son of
[1:16:58] God and he's bid me come.
[1:17:04] Every one of you here tonight got the
[1:17:06] same bidding. Hallelujah.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Whosoever will, let him come.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; I've attracted his attention. He's
[1:17:15] called me now. I won't need the coat
[1:17:19] anymore as long as I obey him.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; He would have never give me the
[1:17:24] invitation if he didn't mean to GIVE ME
[1:17:26] HELP.
[1:17:28] WHAT THAT DOES when you know God
[1:17:30] couldn't have even called you
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; unless he meant to help you.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; But how that devil comes so slick and he
[1:17:38] says remember that call you felt that
[1:17:40] wouldn't God
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; and you lose it like this because you
[1:17:45] believe that lie. But my prophet said he
[1:17:48] meant to call you so he could help you.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; You do not have to remain the same way
[1:17:55] again. That's right.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; So if the soul's crying for a
[1:17:58] perfection, there is a God to grant it.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; If you want to overcome that sin, what's
[1:18:05] crying?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be a deep crying unless
[1:18:08] there was a deep to respond.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; you've got his attention now.
[1:18:18] He said, "Whosoever will come, I've
[1:18:21] attracted his attention. He's called me.
[1:18:23] Now one won't need the code anymore as
[1:18:26] long as I obey him. He would have never
[1:18:28] give me the invitation if he didn't mean
[1:18:30] to give me help. And he'd never been
[1:18:32] wounded for your trans transgression if
[1:18:34] he hadn't have meant to take them away.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; When you read stuff like this,
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; what it does to you?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; He took it all away. All the pain, all
[1:18:50] the hurt,
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; all the trials, all the doubts, the
[1:18:53] questions, HE TOOK IT all
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; because he meant to.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; If he hadn't have meant to take them
[1:19:03] away, he'd have never been stripped for
[1:19:06] your healing
[1:19:08] unless he meant to take it away from
[1:19:10] you.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; You've got his attention. Now,
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; what did he do? Here's faith going in
[1:19:19] action.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Throws aside the garment.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; I won't need it anymore.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be a new creature from now
[1:19:28] on. Hallelujah.
[1:19:30] He throwed aside his garment. How can he
[1:19:33] see out in his dark black world where he
[1:19:37] couldn't see nothing? He spread forth
[1:19:39] his ragged sleeves like that and his
[1:19:42] bony arm sticking through it. He made a
[1:19:45] way to find Jesus.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, sometimes how it feels like you're
[1:19:49] just trying to figure out where to go
[1:19:51] and you really flying blind. You're
[1:19:53] like, I don't know, but I the voice is
[1:19:55] speaking here, so I'm just going to go
[1:19:56] towards that voice. Whatever that voice
[1:19:58] is that's calling me. I'm just going to
[1:20:00] make a move there. It might look out of
[1:20:03] order,
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; but Brother Brandham said, "Get out of
[1:20:05] order long enough. You will get saved."
[1:20:08] So, it might look out of order. You
[1:20:09] trying to get there, but don't worry
[1:20:11] about the order. Get to the promise.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; That's what's important. Getting to the
[1:20:17] promise. I don't care how you get there.
[1:20:19] Get there.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; He said
[1:20:25] [snorts]
[1:20:26] he spread his forth his ragged sleeves
[1:20:28] that his bony arm sticking through it.
[1:20:30] He made a way to find Jesus. No matter
[1:20:32] what condition he was in, he had his
[1:20:35] attention. He didn't know which way he
[1:20:38] was going. He knowed it come from that
[1:20:40] direction. So there he goes with his
[1:20:43] arms stretched out, his ragged sleeves
[1:20:45] are hanging down, tears running from the
[1:20:47] place where the eyes should be running
[1:20:50] to him. Didn't know how he was going to
[1:20:52] find him. But the word said come
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; and he was going there's the main thing.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; You know sometime God says just come my
[1:21:04] child
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I'll take it away. You're like Lord I
[1:21:06] don't know how but somehow your steps
[1:21:08] just start walking in a certain manner.
[1:21:10] You start saying the certain thing. You
[1:21:12] start confessing. You're like, "Man, why
[1:21:13] am I?" Because the action that called
[1:21:16] for you to come has the power to make
[1:21:18] the right action to receive it.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; He says come, then puts in you how to
[1:21:22] come.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; No matter how sick you are, how bad you
[1:21:28] are, how many trials you've had, when he
[1:21:31] said, "Whosoever will, let him come."
[1:21:34] But Abraham says he meant you.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; How am I going to get to it? Brother
[1:21:41] Brandham, the doctor said I can't get
[1:21:43] well. Throw it aside.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Let go. We've got his attention tonight.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; He's passing this away. He's been here
[1:21:51] every night this week.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; He's here. You see the importance of
[1:21:55] going to church every week.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; He's been here. He said every day this
[1:22:02] week,
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; but we just throw away church.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Wednesday is just a Wednesday. Sunday
[1:22:08] night's just a Sunday night as if God
[1:22:10] doesn't come on the scene every service.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Are we significantly impressed with him
[1:22:16] in our midst?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Do we want to be in his midst every
[1:22:21] chance we get?
[1:22:24] I
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; It's a It's a sad place to be when you
[1:22:26] don't create the atmosphere at home
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; and you only come on a Sunday morning.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; You're starving.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; You can't live like that.
[1:22:37] You need more than a Sunday morning.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; You need more than a Wednesday night.
[1:22:42] You need more than a Sunday night. You
[1:22:45] need the person of Jesus Christ every
[1:22:48] single day.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "If Paul had to
[1:22:52] die daily,
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; you and I must die daily."
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't just say that to say it. Paul
[1:23:00] was in a battle.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:23:06] He's been here every night this week.
[1:23:09] He's here now.
[1:23:11] He'll be anywhere where two or three are
[1:23:13] gathered in his name. I'll be in their
[1:23:16] midst. Whatever they agree upon and ask,
[1:23:20] they shall receive it. We've got his
[1:23:23] attention now. He's moving through the
[1:23:25] building. Now raise your hands of faith
[1:23:28] to him and say, "Lord,
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; that I might receive my sight." He said,
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; "Oh,
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; if you've got something
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; you want to receive from God,
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; you heard our prophet, raise your hand
[1:23:43] to him."
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; And say, "Lord,
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; I receive it. Father,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; the sight I need for the trial that I am
[1:23:51] in. Lord, I receive it."
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; He will grant you the sight.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; It's his promise. He wouldn't make the
[1:23:59] call. Oh, that that GETS ME SO EXCITED.
[1:24:02] He wouldn't make the call unless he was
[1:24:05] able to produce it.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; He doesn't tell you he's the God that
[1:24:10] moves mountains and then you have need
[1:24:12] for a mountain to be moved and the
[1:24:13] mountain don't move.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; That's not my God.
[1:24:18] If he if he says something
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; and that circumstance comes to be, you
[1:24:23] can jump as high as you can
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; because there is an assurance on the
[1:24:27] inside that says, "I know where I can
[1:24:29] find that in the word." He said it right
[1:24:32] here. And if God moved in the word, then
[1:24:35] for that circumstance, you come in the
[1:24:38] same way that the person before came,
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; he must move
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; again.
[1:24:50] There's h there's there's there's too
[1:24:51] much to
[1:24:53] to to get through here. Um
[1:24:57] I'm going to try to Where's my time?
[1:25:02] Well, my timer rang without me knowing.
[1:25:05] I'm going to work towards a close here.
[1:25:09] Brother Brandham says this
[1:25:12] [snorts]
[1:25:14] and thou son of David have mercy on me.
[1:25:19] One second. Let me find it.
[1:25:31] He says, "I say now just commit them to
[1:25:34] God. That's all you have to do."
[1:25:35] Paragraph 44. Don't you put your hands
[1:25:38] on it anymore. Let God have it. If
[1:25:41] you're going to do something about it,
[1:25:42] then God will stand back and let you go
[1:25:44] ahead till you get finished. But when
[1:25:47] you commit it to God and let him have
[1:25:49] it, then he will do it. You just believe
[1:25:52] him. Just stand back. Don't work, but
[1:25:55] believe. That's where grace is imputed
[1:25:58] for righteousness to believe that God
[1:26:01] will.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Trying to find this
[1:26:17] Oh Lord, help me.
[1:26:27] Oh,
[1:26:29] if these musicians would come, I I just
[1:26:32] want to close with this. This this
[1:26:34] struck me so much we could all stand. He
[1:26:36] says in paragraph 123,
[1:26:41] I got a letter back from a little woman
[1:26:43] in Germany not long ago. Why? She'd been
[1:26:46] crippled about 15 years with arthritis.
[1:26:49] Couldn't move. I sent her a
[1:26:51] handkerchief. We sent thousands of them
[1:26:53] a month out. And so she got his this
[1:26:56] little letter and we got a prayer chain
[1:26:58] around the world. So she read this and
[1:27:01] she said, 'N now it says on here, if
[1:27:03] your pastor isn't there or if he's an
[1:27:05] unbeliever, don't call him. See, but if
[1:27:08] there's a neighbor somewhere that is a
[1:27:10] believer, call the believer. Confess all
[1:27:12] your faults. Ask God to forgive you of
[1:27:15] everything you've done. Get everything
[1:27:17] right, then pray. I want to pause here
[1:27:19] for a moment because we know obedience
[1:27:22] is better than sacrifice.
[1:27:25] So, just like when Elisha told the uh
[1:27:27] the prophet,
[1:27:30] I'm I'm forgetting the story, but tells
[1:27:32] he tells the man to go dip in the water
[1:27:34] seven times. It wasn't the water, but it
[1:27:37] was the obedience to what a prophet
[1:27:38] said.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; And this is the same thing that's taking
[1:27:41] place here. And I want you to see the
[1:27:42] attitude she has after having done
[1:27:45] everything right. She says, "Put the
[1:27:47] handkerchief on your underneath garment
[1:27:48] over your heart, then believe." So she
[1:27:51] met all the requirements that was sent
[1:27:53] to her. And when she did, she put her
[1:27:56] hand over her heart. She said, "Now, old
[1:27:59] man, devil,
[1:28:01] you've been in me long enough. Get out."
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Here she come walking through. That's
[1:28:09] just that simple.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; It's just that simple to believe. Amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; If you've done everything
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; according to what the word says,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; you've repented,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; you've made things right, whatever
[1:28:25] circumstance it is, if it's not your the
[1:28:27] salvation of your soul, whatever it is,
[1:28:29] if you've come the right way, it's as
[1:28:32] simple as now, old man, devil, you've
[1:28:36] been in this situation too long. Get
[1:28:38] out.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; And at that point, it's no longer your
[1:28:43] words that's speaking. It's his
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; because my prophet said she knows what
[1:28:48] he wants done with the word.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Just speak.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Don't get found laying down.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Get up. Rise again.
[1:29:00] Let's bow our heads and pray.
[1:29:04] Gracious heavenly father.
[1:29:09] Lord, you knew before the foundation of
[1:29:12] the world
[1:29:14] all that would be gathered here tonight.
[1:29:16] Lord,
[1:29:18] Father, you knew how
[1:29:21] the burdens and what each one came with
[1:29:24] into your house.
[1:29:27] Father,
[1:29:30] I feel so little before your word.
[1:29:37] But Lord, I am your word.
[1:29:41] You told me to have the right attitude
[1:29:43] towards myself
[1:29:45] [music] because I am a divine promise
[1:29:48] that must come to pass.
[1:29:51] Lord,
[1:29:53] you see all your children in the house
[1:29:54] tonight.
[1:29:56] You see the attitudes they have towards
[1:29:58] themselves.
[1:30:00] They [music] are the children of
[1:30:01] prophecy.
[1:30:03] Father,
[1:30:05] if their attitude towards themselves is
[1:30:07] wrong, [music] Lord, correct it.
[1:30:10] Because unless we get placed in the
[1:30:12] right position, how can we have faith?
[1:30:16] Lord,
[1:30:20] I was blessed. Father,
[1:30:24] I pray something was said to your
[1:30:26] children, Lord Jesus.
[1:30:28] If there's one soul that's in here
[1:30:34] that feels like blind Barameus
[1:30:38] that says, "Lord, [music]
[1:30:41] everybody looks over me.
[1:30:44] Nobody comes my way. Nobody wants to
[1:30:47] greet me. Nobody pays me no mind.
[1:30:52] I'm struggling.
[1:30:54] I'm alone.
[1:30:58] Father,
[1:31:00] you're my only hope
[1:31:04] or the way your prophet would tell it.
[1:31:07] [music] Blind Brotheras had two turtle
[1:31:09] doves.
[1:31:11] Daughter got sick and she was dying.
[1:31:15] And he said, "Lord, I'll sacrifice these
[1:31:17] doves [music] if you heal my daughter."
[1:31:20] And she was healed.
[1:31:23] Then his wife got sick. [music] And he
[1:31:26] had a lamb that would lead the blind
[1:31:28] because at the time dogs were filth
[1:31:32] and he said to you, "Lord, [music] I'll
[1:31:34] sacrifice this lamb
[1:31:37] if you save my wife."
[1:31:40] You healed his [music] wife. And as he
[1:31:42] was going to make the sacrifice, that
[1:31:45] old devil came to him [music]
[1:31:47] and said, "Blind Barnameus, where are
[1:31:48] you going with that lamb?"
[1:31:51] He said, "I'm going to sacrifice [music]
[1:31:53] the lamb." He said, "Oh, why would you
[1:31:55] do such a thing as that? Here, let me
[1:31:57] give you money that's worth the value of
[1:31:59] that [music] lamb
[1:32:01] and go get you another one." Blind
[1:32:03] Barnameus said,
[1:32:06] "I didn't promise God that I would
[1:32:07] sacrifice a lamb. I told him I'd
[1:32:10] sacrifice this lamb." [snorts]
[1:32:14] How often, Lord Jesus, [music]
[1:32:16] we tell you, God, that we'll give of
[1:32:17] oursel as a sacrifice to you.
[1:32:20] But rather than truly giving ourselves,
[1:32:23] [music] we give you other things, Lord
[1:32:24] Jesus.
[1:32:26] But what you want is us, Lord Jesus.
[1:32:29] You want our lives to be a sacrifice.
[1:32:33] Father,
[1:32:34] we need you more now than we've ever
[1:32:36] needed you before, Lord. [music]
[1:32:38] We'll need you more tomorrow and the
[1:32:41] next day, more than the previous day.
[1:32:44] Help us, Lord Jesus. Help us to walk
[1:32:48] faithfully according to your word.
[1:32:51] [music]
[1:32:54] Lord, I don't have the words.
[1:33:01] You showed me who I was. Lord,
[1:33:06] I got nothing else [music] to do but to
[1:33:08] believe what you said. Lord Jesus,
[1:33:12] I am more than able.
[1:33:14] I am an overcomer.
[1:33:17] I will do the greater works.
[1:33:20] I will achieve that maturity.
[1:33:23] [music]
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Those are all things you said of us,
[1:33:26] Lord Jesus.
[1:33:28] I won't be caught laying down. I'll rise
[1:33:32] again.
[1:33:34] If a punch comes
[1:33:37] and it knocks me down, I'll [music] get
[1:33:39] back up again and I'll keep pressing on.
[1:33:43] [music] For it's not the one that fails,
[1:33:46] but it's the one that quits. Lord, we
[1:33:49] don't want to be found quitters.
[1:33:52] Help us, [music] Lord Jesus.
[1:33:55] If there be one in the house tonight
[1:33:58] [music] that this sermon really spoke to
[1:34:00] you,
[1:34:03] lift up your hands to him.
[1:34:07] You could come to the altar. You could
[1:34:08] lift it where you're at. It's all
[1:34:11] dependent on what you need for faith.
[1:34:15] and let God come by your way.
[1:34:18] As we heard our prophet say, he's here
[1:34:20] tonight.
[1:34:23] And he's here because he wants to help
[1:34:25] you.
[1:34:27] Whatever it is that's holding you back,
[1:34:31] [snorts] you know, [music] he's here to
[1:34:34] help you.
[1:34:38] I thank you, Lord.
[1:34:40] [music]
[1:34:42] Jesus name I pray Lord.
[1:34:45] Amen.
[1:35:02] I sing then. Amen.
[1:35:10] Oh, they say this mountain
[1:35:13] [music and singing] can't be moved.
[1:35:19] Oh, they say this chains will never
[1:35:24] break. [music]
[1:35:28] Oh, but they don't know you like me do.
[1:35:35] Oh, [music] there is power [singing]
[1:35:39] in your name. [music]
[1:35:43] Oh, [singing] I have so much power
[1:35:47] in your [music] name.
[1:35:54] Worthy of the Lord. [music]
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:36:00] [singing]
[1:36:02] Oh, and God [music] we believe
[1:36:07] God [singing] we believe [music]
[1:36:11] from the [singing]
[1:36:13] impossible
[1:36:16] [music]
[1:36:20] God we believe [singing]
[1:36:24] God [music] we believe [singing] for
[1:36:32] Oh, and [singing and music] we heard
[1:36:34] them. Let's give her love.
[1:36:40] [music] Oh, [singing] for there is still
[1:36:44] a
[1:36:46] grave.
[1:36:49] Oh, [music and singing] and God we
[1:36:52] no matter
[1:36:54] what.
[1:36:56] [singing] Oh, [music] there is power.
[1:36:59] Hallelujah.
[1:37:04] Oh, [music]
[1:37:05] so much [singing] power
[1:37:09] in you. [music]
[1:37:18] Lord,
[1:37:20] great. [music and singing]
[1:37:24] God we believe. [music]
[1:37:28] God we believe [singing] for
[1:37:33] the impossible [music]
[1:37:36] will see [singing] a miracle. [music]
[1:37:41] God,
[1:37:45] God
[1:37:47] for me. [music]
[1:37:50] Oh, [singing] you say,
[1:37:54] "Oh, and I
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; just sit back. Just worship it." [music]
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Just lift your hands. Say, "Lord, I
[1:38:02] receive your word tonight." [music]
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, I will receive my sight tonight.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; You said
[1:38:12] I believe [music]

[1:38:32] and great.
[1:38:34] Oh God [singing] we believe.

[1:38:44] [singing] impossible
[1:38:47] or see
[1:38:51] God we believe. [music]
[1:38:55] God be [singing]
[1:38:58] for you.

[1:39:13] oh and it is
