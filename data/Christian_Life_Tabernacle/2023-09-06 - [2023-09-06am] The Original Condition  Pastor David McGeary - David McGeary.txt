Description:
The Original Condition
Pastor David McGeary
Christian Life Tabernacle
September 06, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

even in us till the end Lord we ask that you would bless your word tonight in this little Wednesday evening service we just trust that you'll be our portion of you'll Grant to us your peace the comfort of your word father as we just Fellowship to stir up our minds in our hearts in remembrance of you bless each need this evening we pray in Jesus name amen amen amen God bless you let's turn in our Bibles to that The Book of Joel and then we'll read a couple other scriptures also found in in our in the Bible and uh you know someone came to me and they asked me uh one of the young ones they said are are you like Jeremiah or Hagee I I said I'm a hagamine agamine right hagamaya there I am hagemaya all right let's read this this is pretty good uh scripture I I think it's something that will bless our hearts he said the word of the Lord came to Joel the son of vanilla I'll hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this men in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the Palmer worm hath left half the locus eaten and that which the locusts have left half the cankerworm eaten and that which the canker worm have left the caterpillar hath eaten Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen let's also turn over uh if we could uh you may be seated I believe it's the book of Colossians and um let me see if I can find that scripture here in the book of Colossians we'd like to read let me see if I can find it here I don't think I can find it but so we'll just read the one that we have in Jude uh the first uh Jude chapter and of course you know that there's only one chapter in Jude and it says beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation as it was needed for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints and uh and so what what brought this thought on my heart was you know we just came out of some wonderful meetings I thought they were wonderful meetings they knew that presence the Lord was there and our our faith has been lifted up and we know that we've been studying and talking about faith because without faith it's impossible to please the Lord and the Lord wants us to believe he wants us to believe that all things are possible he wants us to believe that that whatever that he has for you is yours to have he wants you to be short of nothing he wants you to reach all the fullness of your potential in fact it's the father's perfect will that he gives the children the kingdom and so he he wants to do more for us than I think that we even comprehend that he wants to do for us and so he's looking for a church that he can have fellowship with and and of course the enemy is always there like a roaring lion and trying to devour us and so when we read this uh little scripture here and the thought that comes we find out that the the enemy is always trying to eat away at the church he doesn't you know he he doesn't just always come with a like a great big smack you know what I mean or try to knock you out all at once he just eats at you and eats at you and eats at you and just kind of choose uh choose you down and down and then you pretty soon you don't have any remembrance of what that you were and I think that's the saddest part about being backslid or getting away from the Lord is that you forget what he once were and that's what happened to the church the church forgot once what they once were and so even Jude is the last uh book in the Bible before the Book of Revelation so we know that some time had passed in the church and he's saying Church we've got to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints in other words things are slipping away the other writers write James and those right you know he says there's spots and wrinkles in our Feast they've cometh amongst us and and they're they're eating away at us they're they're trying to take us away from what made us what that we are and so we we in the church wanting to rise up and and I think we we feel that in our heart we feel that God opens the word to us that he's he's trying to let us know that he's here for us to do for us exceedingly and abundantly above what we can even ask or think he he doesn't want us to be cowardly he doesn't want us to be weak he wants us to be strong he wants us to be full of Might he wants us to take pleasure in him and his word and so uh in this little sermon that came on my heart as I and I hope that you can go home and and maybe read it this week and and listen to it and study a little bit but it's called The Palmer worm the Locust the cata uh the canker worm and the caterpillar and so that that's what uh and and in this thing I'm just going to take a little bit of it tonight and just fellowship with you I was telling the brothers in the back he's I says you know it's been a while well since I preached and I don't know if I can do it anymore and uh you know so I I hope that I can get this across and then I'm heading towards uh Phoenix this weekend to preacher a banquet I never preached a banquet in my life I had to go get a pair of tux and a formal banquet and I thought well my goodness by the time I get up there I'll have gravy spilled all over on me and if everything you know what I mean and what do you tell so it's old people that that have been married 40 years and older that has been married now anybody that's been married that long knows that you ain't gonna tell them nothing and secondly I've been married 50 some years and I still can't figure it out so you know it's what do you do you you know you you just go by faith right and you trust that God did it and then they're going to have another uh service with uh I guess young married couples and uh it's been so long since I've been young married I forgot what that's like but I know one thing hasn't changed and that's God's word so if you ever prayed for me you prayed for me this weekend you know what I mean because I'll tell you that's out of my comfort zone I'm not very comfortable with uh situations like that and and uh but we just trust that the Lord will do something and and forward so we want to think just a moment because I think it's our hearts desire that we don't want to be a people that's always up and down you know what I'm saying we want to get to that place where we're strong and and we want if I I'm going to say this and I know it's going to sound not sound of the right way and I hope it's taken the right way but the church has got to get weaned off of preachers can I say that that way you know what I mean that that that when we come together to gather around the word of God we we come up as peers we come as equals we come fellowshipped each one's bringing something uh uh to the meal that it's not just a a one cook it's a it's a spiritual potluck you know and uh people have testimonies in their heart and they have the love of God in their heart and they they know they have something that's radiating them because God done something for him in their day and and it's a wonderful time to be a Christian and so the the church is is rising up to a place where it it's not just sitting there and absorbing sermons the prophet of God uh approached that in the church Church age book you know that you just sit there and try to absorb but we want to move past that as individuals we want to be able to know that we're positioned right in the Lord and our hearts right with God and and God's dealing with us and and we're we're listening and hearing from them and it's it's not always getting up out of the mud but it's it's coming up and saying Lord what can I do for you today oh oh give me an opportunity to witness give me an opportunity to help something there's a confidence that that is around the believer and around their experience and around their fellowship with the lord they're confident that their sins are forgiven they're confident that they love the Lord and they're confident that God loves them that he'll never leave you nor forsake you and it's not built on something that you have some ability you have or some great spiritual uh spirituality that you have it's based on what he did for you and you're in love with what he did for you and you haven't forgot that and and that's what uh we find in the scripture always happens that people forget they forget where they come from the scripture says and you know it he says and he wrote in the Statue of a perfect man a man that doesn't add these things and doesn't have these things he's forgot where he's come from I see it all the time people they get in the message after a while and and they came from nothing they didn't even know how to read the Bible they they didn't even know what the Bible said but a Divine interpreter came along began to preach and they could start to read and they could start to set study and all of a sudden they forgot where they got everything you know what I mean they they walk around like you know I got this this is mine and heck and and and it just it doesn't create the atmosphere that the message really wanted to create you know if it wasn't about seeing how many uh you know what influence you could have you know it's about kind of atmosphere do you create and I love that we've always been told that that a great person makes everybody around them feel great you know they're secure I know they talk about wealthy men and and and how so many of them are ordinary drove the same pickup truck lived in the same house you know what I mean they they didn't have nothing to show they they realized that that they're blessed and you know the scripture tells us that we should be content in whatever state that we're in even Texas when it's hot and so we these things that that are are stored up in the house for us the storehouse of God's word they're really they're they're so beautifully placed to meet every challenge that comes upon us and this the word of God tells us that all scriptures has given us first instruction reproof of sin for wisdom and for knowledge and and so we we find out that in order for the church to get back to what it was in the beginning and to be restored back because we if even as we heard a Sunday about the the restoration of it is that's what Malachi 4 was forced to restore back the faith that our fathers had and we just since we've been talking about faith and Billy's beautiful message on faith by love and we don't want to leave that thing because you can't build on anything unless you have the right foundation the foundation is the it is the most important thing of anything that you build ick and the the greatest house with the greatest work and the greatest uh carpentry and the greatest stone work in everything if that Foundation isn't on Bedrock it'll crack then it'll falter so let this talk because this Joel's telling us here that that it's going to be eaten so I want to just read a little bit to you have a little short moment of Fellowship he says now this scripture that Joel spoke of is fulfilled today as we the Gentiles have received it so this is fulfilled today that this eating is going on and uh you know I I never thought in my lifetime that that my a house that I had ever would ever have termites and one day I was there and and Leslie looked up in her bathroom cabinet says oh what this paint looks like it's bubbling so you know I went to touch it and I pushed my finger right through the cabinet and I looked and then I got and I looked back and I took it down I had termites and without even realizing it all the outside looked good but it was eating at the inside and that's what happens to Believers the outside looks good the the daily actions look good their appearances look good but but it's on the inside that Satan eats at you it eats on your emotions it eats on your feelings it eats on your your thinking it eats on your faith so you know someone could be on the outside could be fine but on the inside there there they're all tore up you know so uh and that's a trouble sometime with the church as long as everything looks good you know we we don't want anybody to come in that maybe that's uh doesn't look just right because you know we we want our outside to look good but you know if your inside is right the outside don't bother you because you've got a confidence that the same God that cleansed you up can cleanse the other person up you're welcome you're not ashamed of the Gospel what will you think you know oh you know if somebody came into our church and like in a pair of pants or something a lady or something or maybe her hair wasn't as long as we wear our hair oh those people forget those people every single one of us should say a soul is going to be saved today oh God Quicken their heart deal with them that that's not going to hurt me why because I have a promise right nothing can plucked me out of the palm of his hand look we we got to understand that these there A lot of times what's being eaten at is not on the outside it's on the inside it's what's going on in our hearts in fact what's going on in our minds and Satan gets in our minds and if if we let something in our mind that's not right if it drops into our heart and our thinking's not right our attitude's not right our approach isn't right and uh and and everything's kind of thing but yet we can maintain a good posture how are you today fine fine you know how many people have taken their lives and everybody around them was totally astounded because we get content and so we we want to we want to work on the Inside Man on the inside person that the love of God is shed abroad in our heart that our judgments are right our our discernments are according to God's word that that were full of grace and we're full of compassion again that we're we're really possessing uh fruits in real fruits Christian fruits christ-like fruits you know that that that's the love of How It's manifested is that as he is so are we in this world so we want to talk about this eating because we want to have faith we want to have a church that has an atmosphere that all things are possible not a bunch of politics and you know I get so tired of brother McGary reading quotes because he can't read and he pronounces everything wrong you think I I put the quotes up on I put the quotes on the board see that I'm not responsible you know what I mean because hey I I know I can't read but anyway and we're going to try to read so okay so the first thing we understand that he said all the pump worm can't worm all these things eaten okay it's today so we know he's eating today so we know if if he if if he doesn't he eats what he can't consume then the next one consumes and the next one consumes so sometimes Clayton drives you down to a hole and all of a sudden he backs off but you've become content in that state you know and just because you got to reprieve and that he's no longer working on you you think okay now I'm okay no you want to get back what he took you want to get back everything he took from you because then he he goes off and then the next one comes and it starts eating well because you you had this first one eating at you and he's gone you don't recognize when the next one's there and he's just slowly chewing away not at the outside on the outside now look at the outside oh we're building the church and people are coming and wow it's good and we have me on the outside it looks like you got a A revival going on but if the people aren't having their hearts changed on the inside it's just fakeness you know I mean so we want to deal with the real thing so this is paragraph of 46 and 47. and so we're just going to talk a little bit and fellowship a little bit so you understand uh where my whole heart is where it is as the pastor what What fields that I I want to lead the flock into I don't want to lead them into more Revelation and more explanation you know what I mean I I don't want to spend my my Ministry continually preaching the son of man that God came into deity and where we are I want something that's living on the hearts of the believer and I want every I want every uh member of our fellowship to be more fruitful than I ever was and to receive the full wages no matter what hour that you started to work in so he says now he says and these insects if you'll get your book on insects you'll notice that four different insects is the self same insect in four different stages of its life okay so this is the person that's eating at us so we know who that is right but it commit he he comes in different stages that he says of his life and all of us know that a cocoon is nothing but a caterpillar covered over and it's going to hatch out a butterfly and the Butterfly is a caterpillar before it hatches out the Palm worm the locus and so forth is the same it's the self same insect now whatever now listen close whatever happened in the first place with the insect of the Palmer worm is just become a caterpillar and the caterpillar become a locust later and whatever it it was that started in the beginning is still the same things that's causing the trouble today and let's go back now to the scriptures and find out what started so it doesn't matter its purpose of all those stages okay to self same thing it's the same thing that's causing the trouble so it doesn't matter okay you know brother Matt and Thomas and I was fellowship and he looked over me says I said you know you when you think about it David he says the word hasn't changed man hasn't changed it's still the same oh man's been the same and God's been the same so whatever troubles we have they've come and and and they come but the blessings of God are the same so we're talking about now we're just going to go quickly here says now listen close whatever happens in the first place the impound is the same find outstandard Now 49 now we know that we can only build a church first upon the material that God gave us to build it with think about that you can't bring nothing else in not psychology not science you know we've been trying to look for lighting for the church and so I go to these places and everybody wants us to you know have a light show you know spotlights and and things and they keep sending me videos and pictures you know what I mean of the backdrops and these big screens and and and everything was like they want me to get a guitar or something you know and turn into a a rock star preacher that ain't how the church started so he he says that you gotta build with what God gave us to build with he didn't give us fancy words he didn't give us psychology he built the church with the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit that's what he built the church with he built the church proving that he's resurrected from the dead he proved the church to proved that the church was built that he didn't leave us but he was still with us back what the church was built on so just think of it if you want to build yourself up spiritually and and really be restored and have the cleansing Start From the Inside Out you've got to use the material that God gave you to build with don't leave it it's the same material that Peter had that James and John that they had in the beginning it hasn't changed Satan it changed all the surroundings around us for the one purpose to try to get us to think that the original material won't work but praise God for a prophet Malachi 4 5 came and proved us that he was the same yesterday and ever and that the same word worked to get us back to the word amen so look what he does it's beautiful I love it forgive me he had that God gave Spirit that's all we have and I think I know this is strong and it's on tape hundreds of people around the world will hear it but before we can ever have a building of the Church of God we have to restore back all those things that these insects has eaten out of it we'll have to go back and find out what the insects eaten and I we're not going to go into that all all the depth of it I hope you can go back personally and do that we'll have to go back and find out what the insect eat and before this Vine of the Lord the caterpillar he's divine were the branches and before we can ever find out or the church can stand in its formal and original Power it'll have to go back and find out what the insect eat and the church will have to be restored back to that and it will never stand in its power and Glory of its first standing so those things have taken something away from the church so the biggest thing is that man just moves on and they get content and they go so far and they get content they get so far I I don't think we should be content until every one of our children every one of the people that will come in contact have the gift of God which is the Holy Spirit we we got to get Beyond Survival you know to be a real working believer fitted and joined together each one supplying the need of the others that's the church and I know Satan locks us into our personal struggles and our emotional struggles and like I said he's destroying us on the inside and that's what we're just talking a little bit about this evening is if if the inside God works from the inside out the church world and religion works from the outside in like I say it's like we want everything that we want to be well before we take the medicine the best time to take the medicine is when you're sick the best time to repent is when you're in the Sin you know there's no past it's like some belated card so we want to stash just now if the bark is torn off of a tree we've got to get barked back on it again grow the bark first you can't have apples until you grow the Bark for the bark is the sap line and the sap line is the lifeline and the scriptures God's holy Bible is the lifeline to any church so think of it if you're out of fellowship with your Bible you're out of Fellowship with your lifeline because the scriptures are given to supply life to you not the carnal life but the life to the inward man that inward man that inward person so with that inward person so built up you're so confident in the promises of God that you really aren't so hung up on what your outside looks like and I'll tell you I got news for y'all it's a news flash if the Lord doesn't come you'll all die unless you're born again and then the first death won't harm you but you don't want the second death he said he said you got to bring it through the he's he was right here um because I'm 51. okay if the bark is tore off we've got to get it back on it again grow the bark first you can't have apples until you grow the bark the bark is the sap line the sap line is the lifeline and the scriptures God's holy Bible is the lifeline to any church how could we ever bring up grape sap through Sycamore bark it won't work we've got to have Grapevine bark we've got to have the original bar there's only one way that that bark can ever come back to the Vine is when God grows it himself think of it all the preaching is just to let you know that there's a God that can grow it but God's got to grow it himself in other words if the meeting doesn't grow it the meeting might provide the atmosphere that God can grow it but it's got to be God growing the bark or the lifeline and you've got to know it's God you've got to know God did this God did this I didn't join this I didn't a part of it the church didn't do it God did it God dealt with me God healed me God touched me God convicted me God spoke to my heart praise God I'm in fellowship with God God's real and he's alive but God's got to do it and you can't look for anybody else to do it the best thing somebody could tell you is what the scripture said and we know that the message of the hour is the scriptures interpreted I'm not separating her they're wanting the same thing it's what was written made flesh just like Jesus said search the scriptures they speak of me you know I have not come to destroy the law but I've come to fulfill it we've seen the Fulfillment of scripture in our day but God's got to grow it and if we're not careful we we start looking out across the Realms of the carnal world and looking for Solutions I've seen people come up with all kinds of solutions if I go here if I do this if I do that you know it's Human Nature but the bottom line is the first church was what it was because God made it what it was and when we can get in our heart Lord I want you to make me I want you to put the bark on me and sometimes he's got to take the old hide off before he can put the new bark on but that's all right right that's we're okay with that right so he says he says is when God grows it himself we cannot make some we can't make some and put on it it won't work no man-made skiing will ever work it'll take God's way or it'll never live mandate schemes will not work you might wrap a rag around the tree and say Let It Grow the rag wasn't God's program it's got to be bark lifeline and when it comes from its roots it'll produce the same life that the tree had before the insect ate it that's pretty good yeah right because isn't that really what we're all we're all talking about isn't this really what the church is the gospel is we're trying to get back to what our fathers had and they knew Jesus personally they know what he was they know what he said they understand the gift of the Holy Spirit they knew the Holy Spirit was to lead them and guide them for bring them in remembrance of all the things that father the father had told them in fact they counted on him and let's just listen to this little I'll try to close up real quick he said this is paragraph 65. I'm going to drive this down and I want you to listen let it be God truth let it's line up with what God Said regardless of what anybody else said I want to use four different things or what I see in the scriptures that these insects has eaten off of the Church of the Living God and has got the vine of God crippled or stunted you never say you weren't the Vine so these things are crippling the church he said paragraph 610 now let us go back I want to name four things just as scripture as I know how to to be that these insects has eaten from the church from its first original condition and that's what we want to just spend just a second on tonight the original condition what was the condition of the original church and what made the church be like that he said now the first thing the church was established on the day of Pentecost Peter preached the inaugural sermon at the baculatoria service when the church was born the Christian church was born on the day of Pentecost and if God is infinite is infinite and cannot change his church must remain as it was at the beginning do you admit that congregation says amen paragraph 71. So what we're finding now is that it has to be the original Foundation and so when the church started they were faced up against the great persecution they're locked up in an upper room right but they have a promise he said you go there and wait until you're endued with power on high I will not leave you comfortless I will come again and be with you even in you another is I I'm I I'm not going to separate from you I am the vine ye are the branches the branches for all the life from the vine the church was there they had made their stand they believed them they're locked up in an upper room they're afraid they don't know they're hearing stories are flying around about things going on and then all of a sudden his presence comes in and now they're they're they felt his presence and they know it's him it's not a third person it's not it's not uh a sensation it's him he's there in spirit form I I will not leave your forsake I'll come again I'll be with you I'll send the comforter the spirit of Truth well who what did he say I am the way the what the truth the spirit of the truth The Same Spirit that's in me that made me what I am you can look at a man and see that I was just a Man From Galilee there is no difference in me but there was a spirit in me that made me different that was my father's spirit and I'm going to send that Spirit back on you it's a free gift now that was their comfort because that what their faith was built in their faith was built in the presence of the Lord it wasn't built on what we sometimes think of just the scriptures because they had the law and they had the teachings but there's no way you can make those teachings work so what their faith was built on the very Foundation that the church was built on was the presence of the Lord and their fellowship with that presence that's what they were Anchored In they had Fellowship in his presence and I I encourage you to go read this more so that was the foundation paragraph 77. now the first thing I'd like to speak to you for a few minutes is after we have found out the foundation must be original it must go back to the foundation it must go back to where it was a Vine something is wrong with it and the vine is not operating right let's go back and find out what's wrong so what's wrong is they were built on faith that's what the church is built on we want to build it on a lot of other things but the the church is individuals fitted and joined together each of us having faith so that's what Jude said let's contend for the faith what was the faith that they had their faith was in the presence of God with them they knew he was with them they knew he was there they knew their experience was real they knew he said he'd never leave them nor forsake them they could count on them they didn't need sensation they knew he was there because he said so they knew he wasn't far away he they knew he was watching they knew he knew what their needs were what their sufferings were they they knew that that that he promised them that he would lead them and guide them that's what they Anchored In I'm telling you sometimes we try to Anchor our faith in our own life our own Works what we see in the mirror how we're living well that Faith changes every day this Faith doesn't change the faith of the believer is they know that he's there with you he's there with you he paid the price for you well you were yet sinner he died for you and if you fail he said if you cry Abba Father and repent I'm there to just the full and Faithfully forgive you so the church was built on that it was their Foundation when he came in that upper room they knew he was here and when they went out they said men and Brethren they're not drunk this is what was promised to Joel I'll pour out my spirit he's here he's present he poured his Spirit out on us they knew it now can you imagine each of you here tonight knowing he's there with you when that pipe blew up Tim and all that steam come pouring out there weren't you glad he was there you could look a lot worse than you do right now that's her hope that's where our faith is our faith isn't in our Doctrine our faith is in his presence it's in him that's what that and that's the first thing that Satan tried to eat away from the church is the presence of God with them the days of Miracles has passed the things he does fast like now we're going to get in on our intellect I don't know about you guys but my intellect is starting to suffer ask anybody that's around me he says paragraph 81 and the faith of the Saints was not in creeds not in denominations not in church buildings not in associations but in the presence of the Living God hallelujah so now you know I didn't make that up I love perching it but I didn't make it up that's what he said so when you start looking out at people that are hurting and being destroyed on the inside you know the first problem is is they don't know he's with them they think he's forsaken them remember when the prophet of God was sitting by his little baby's bed the first thing that Satan tried to tempt him with was he's not with you he doesn't love you he's not here anymore but he said something welled up inside of me because he knew he meant them and he said though he slayed me yet will I serve him so we're talking about faith a people that has Faith a people that has confidence a people that hearts are not condemning them because he's greater than your heart and the first church was built on on the faith of his presence and we'll just close here he says that but in the presence of the Living God they had Faith to heal the sick cast out Devils do Miracles and all these great promises that Jesus made the first church held on to that it was the life line listen here listen close to what I'm telling you the ever presence of the Living God is the lifeline of any church or any bunch of people the ever presence of the Living God to perform and to do and to act and to live with the people as he did at the beginning how many loves that isn't that beautiful let's lay it down a little more if the presence of the Living God brought a Pentecostal with power and signs and wonders and brought a people to the full glory of God till they shouted spoke with other languages and went and martyred for the faith let's earnestly contend for that Faith until death shall set us free earnestly contend for it we will not compromise upon reading books taking some man-made theology will not compromise upon some Creed or some prayer books or some some somebody else has said what is your faith built on so if it's so simple that if you don't feel that prison seek it knock it shall be open seek and you shall find but it doesn't matter if if you understand all the Mysteries and can explain all the Mysteries if if you're not confident that he's mindful of you and that he's present with you well let me say it this way if you don't know that Satan's robbing that from you because he promised he would be he's just right here in your life but if you're not believing it if you don't believe Lord you know I got this problem you know I battle this you know why Satan Works me over you know it just takes me one second and I I just I'm back where I was at I need your help he said cast your cares upon me where I care for you he that is in you is greater than he who is in the world see if that's what our faith is our faith is in his presence his presence with the church that's why we can pray for the sick not because God's given this guy a gift and he's got this guy's got a gift and this guy's got a gift and now with this gift he can heal and with this gift he can prophesy and with this gifts he can do that and he can do that no no no it's because he is here because he said he would be here wherever two or three are gathered together in my name I will be there to perform every word I said amen Lord let me recognize your presence the prophet of God preached the whole message the presence of God unrecognized I love the messenger he stands there and all of a sudden says he's here I take every Spirit what did he have his faith in he had his faith in the ever presence glory of the word of God Amen so that's just where he started tearing it away from the church then we can go into Fellowship how he broke down fellowship and how he broke down this and he broke down that and he took it all away but remember what he said if the church is ever going to return back to the original it's going to have to remove these things that were taken from it and the foundation of the perfect man is faith faith in what we get it faith in what I believe faith in what I'm taught no it's faith in his presence amen God bless you let's Stand Together sorry if I was too long you love the word I mean I hope that helped you tonight that encourage you that if you're dealing with the troubles on the inside remember he's right there he knows what you're thinking he knows what's happening on the inside when nobody else does all right you got to let everybody run out that's running out all righty let's bow our heads in prayer a gracious Heavenly Father we love you this evening I just hope the word of the Lord that your messenger has brought us we'll lift them up that they can think in their heart and know Lord you're with me I know your presence is right here Lord now I may have not done right but I'm inviting you back close to me [Music] and I want to have faith Lord in knowing that you're here that every promise in this book is mine and you're here and then Peter said it's through these great and precious promises that we have fellowship with you because of your presence with us to perform your word Lord I hope tonight that this little bit of Fellowship that we've had will give hope to the believer Lord maybe it'll just they'll take a moment and sit down and just listen to that beautiful teaching and they'll say in their heart you know Lord I don't I want back everything that was stole from me I want back everything those four horse riders robbed from the church I went back into the pure fellowship with your word Lord where I have Victory and strength that I can withstand father the Great tempter Lord and if I if I would slip in the weakness of the moment that I would know you're always there with open arms to receive me back I
