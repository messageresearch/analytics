[26:43] of your word and we just would like if
[26:47] you deceive me

[26:52] us to just touch on some of the great
[26:55] things that you have for us we ask you

[27:02] bless us tonight with your presence in
[27:04] Jesus precious and wonderful name we
[27:08] pray amen amen let's open our Bibles
[27:22] I'm on
[27:27] amen
[27:29] let's open our Bibles to Ephesians the
[27:31] second chapter
[27:33] am
[27:36] just uh want to just fellowship with you
[27:39] you know our fellowship is in Christ and
[27:42] Christ is the word so our fellowship is
[27:45] in the word of God and uh we we always
[27:49] trust that there's something in the word
[27:51] of God that goes out and touches our
[27:54] hearts and blesses us and once again I
[27:57] appreciate you all coming out it
[28:00] something happened out there it was
[28:02] warmer this morning when we woke up than
[28:05] it is now so we know that changes of
[28:09] Ages
[28:10] we might be moving into the Ice Age
[28:14] okay
[28:15] it is supposed to rain and sleet ice and
[28:19] and the freezing rain Tuesday and
[28:22] Wednesday so we'll keep you abreast
[28:25] check your emails check the weather
[28:28] whether we'll have
[28:30] a good enough road conditions to have
[28:33] service Wednesday but we'll have
[28:36] something for you uh if if we don't have
[28:41] service here maybe we'll broadcast
[28:43] something or do something so I know that
[28:47] we normally jump
[28:50] uh in Ephesians 2 to the tenth verse for
[28:55] we as his workmanship created in Christ
[28:57] Jesus unto good work with God hath
[29:00] before ordained that we should walk in
[29:03] them we use that a lot because we want
[29:06] to talk about our predestination
[29:08] but uh
[29:10] uh we want to go back before that if I
[29:15] would have a title tonight I would call
[29:18] it the pursuit of the attributes of God
[29:21] the pursuit of the attributes of God so
[29:25] we want to go back to before
[29:29] where were we before we were
[29:32] foreordained
[29:35] that's a good thing to know
[29:38] you know
[29:39] I know there's a lot of people we call
[29:42] Johnny come lately you know but there's
[29:46] no son and daughter of God that said
[29:48] Johnny come lately
[29:50] they have a great Rich inheritance so
[29:53] let's read these Scriptures it says
[29:56] and you hath he quickened
[30:00] who were dead in trespass in sin so what
[30:04] does Quicken mean
[30:06] Made Alive all right so who
[30:10] and you hath he made alive
[30:12] quickened who were deaf in trespassing
[30:16] sins
[30:17] wherein in times past you walked
[30:20] according to the courts of this world
[30:24] according to the prince of the power of
[30:27] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[30:31] the children of disobedience
[30:34] so that was the description of the
[30:36] husband that you had
[30:39] that came to you naturally by your
[30:43] natural birth you were born into this
[30:46] world
[30:47] you came into this world
[30:50] formed in sin shaped in iniquity came
[30:54] into the world speaking lies you were
[30:57] United and married to that nature
[31:00] you you didn't have a choice you just
[31:03] grew up you
[31:05] you lied right away you know
[31:08] um
[31:09] he says that worketh among whom also we
[31:14] all had our conversations in times past
[31:19] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[31:23] desires of the flesh and of the Mind
[31:29] and we're by Nature the children of
[31:32] Wrath even as others
[31:35] so that nature was what death
[31:40] death
[31:42] but God who is rich in Mercy
[31:45] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[31:51] even when we were dead in sins hath
[31:57] quickened us together with Christ by
[32:01] Grace ye are saved and hath raised us up
[32:05] together
[32:06] and made us to sit together in Heavenly
[32:10] places in Christ Jesus
[32:13] that in the ages to come he might show
[32:18] the exceeding Riches of his grace in in
[32:25] his kindness towards us through Christ
[32:28] Jesus for great grace ye are saved
[32:31] through faith
[32:33] and not of yourselves it is the gift of
[32:37] God
[32:39] not of Works lest any man should boast
[32:43] for we are his workmanship
[32:46] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[32:49] which God hath before
[32:53] ordained that we should walk in them
[32:57] amen Heavenly Father we ask you to bless
[33:00] us this evening in your precious name we
[33:03] pray amen God bless you you may be
[33:06] seated
[33:11] you know I had uh
[33:14] so many statements and things that uh I
[33:19] wanted to uh
[33:22] bring out and read and and it just got
[33:27] so uh big that I thought no I'll just
[33:31] keep it I'll narrow it down we won't
[33:33] talk too long tonight on it and then
[33:35] we'll just pursue it in different parts
[33:38] later going forward so we're talking
[33:41] about the pursuit of the attributes of
[33:46] God
[33:47] and so we understand and we could take
[33:50] you to many places but we understand
[33:52] that in the beginning God
[33:55] in the beginning God created heaven and
[33:58] earth in the beginning was the word and
[34:02] the Word was with God and the Word was
[34:05] God so in the beginning God had
[34:08] attributes
[34:10] that's what God had he had attributes
[34:12] and attributes were his thoughts so
[34:16] God's thinking it was his attributes his
[34:20] thinking was his word
[34:22] so it was in attribute form first or in
[34:29] thought form first before it was
[34:33] expressed
[34:35] so if you can understand that we
[34:38] we try to go to a carnal uh explanation
[34:43] so our finite Minds can grab it and so
[34:48] the prophet used in the Great
[34:51] story of the Masterpiece how that that
[34:55] the artist in his mind he had a thought
[34:59] and the thought wasn't expressed it was
[35:04] only in his thought form so him not
[35:08] being able to speak the word he had to
[35:12] go to work because he couldn't Express
[35:15] the thought by creation because he
[35:19] couldn't create he could only express
[35:23] the thought by the labor of his hands so
[35:27] he began to work and he began to Chisel
[35:30] away or we might say he would have a
[35:33] thought and he would begin to paint a
[35:37] masterpiece or or whatever he did but So
[35:40] eventually when it was done it it
[35:45] produced what that his thought was in
[35:49] the beginning so he had that thought he
[35:53] had that attribute after the the very uh
[35:58] uh idea that he wanted to express okay
[36:04] and we're talking about the carnal
[36:06] artist now or the sculpture it kind of
[36:10] expressed his character
[36:13] you know what I mean uh I I I'm not very
[36:18] musical anybody that knows me in
[36:22] everything but I I have a great love for
[36:25] music uh you know I've been to many
[36:28] piano concerts and and uh listened to
[36:32] many of the up and coming uh pianists
[36:38] that have won the different Awards and I
[36:43] couldn't tell you a change in a mood or
[36:46] a change in a beat or or anything but I
[36:49] love to sit there you know I'll just be
[36:52] honest with you I I for many times I had
[36:54] season tickets to the Fort Worth
[36:57] Symphony because I'd like to go there
[36:59] and I just it I marveled
[37:02] yeah what was in Beethoven's mind and
[37:06] Chopin's mind and and brahm's mind and
[37:10] these guys that could sit there and
[37:13] write all that instruments and all that
[37:15] work and put that together you know I
[37:19] thought man these guys were out there
[37:22] I mean you know what I mean it's just
[37:24] it's just hard but it had to be an
[37:28] expression of what their characteristics
[37:31] and what that their desire was
[37:35] so if we can see that in the natural
[37:38] nothing appeared in the natural that
[37:41] wasn't with God in the beginning
[37:45] even things that aren't right are the
[37:49] truth perverted
[37:50] so okay you know this man hasn't come up
[37:54] with anything really he's changed things
[37:57] he's looked at things he's done things
[37:59] he's taken things he's put things
[38:01] together and and many times not even
[38:05] knowing what the outcome would be
[38:07] thinking that they were doing a good
[38:09] thing and ended up being something very
[38:11] tragic but so is this artist expressed
[38:15] it he's trying to get forth out of his
[38:18] mind what that he envisioned so he takes
[38:22] things and he works with them and he
[38:24] brings it we know the story of the
[38:26] Masterpiece that he finally seen
[38:28] something that was such an expression
[38:31] of himself
[38:34] and what that he had in mind
[38:36] that it it it it it it
[38:40] inspired him to to bring it to life
[38:44] and now we know that God had thinking
[38:48] that's what his attributes were that was
[38:51] his thoughts what he had in his mind in
[38:55] the beginning at the end and what that
[38:58] he wanted to accomplish and what that he
[39:01] wanted to to bring to pass and and we
[39:05] heard this morning he said it's all one
[39:08] big folding of Eternity and that's all
[39:11] so everything is really the thoughts of
[39:15] God coming to pass that he had that's
[39:19] why he's Alpha and Omega he's the
[39:23] beginning and the end he started it he's
[39:27] going to finish it another king it's not
[39:30] like he's got to finish it's it's like
[39:32] it's already finished
[39:36] so he he he spoke it
[39:40] and that and it hadn't intended end so
[39:45] we know that what we understand in
[39:48] Christ The Mystery of God revealed is
[39:51] that everything that God was all the
[39:53] thoughts that he had all the Expressions
[39:56] because he wanted to express himself
[40:00] because that's what he wanted and he
[40:01] wanted to have Fellowship in that
[40:04] expression so in God was we know we're
[40:07] attributes
[40:09] mercy and kindness and goodness and love
[40:13] and Temperance and every good and
[40:17] perfect thing comes from the father
[40:19] above
[40:21] so we know that that he he wanted to do
[40:25] these things in him was a Healer
[40:29] in him was a a savior in him was a
[40:33] delivery he had all these things within
[40:35] them so within God what did he do he set
[40:39] forth a plan by his word
[40:43] by his thoughts he thought out if I
[40:47] could use this I feel so carnal uh
[40:50] talking about something so great because
[40:53] I don't have the vocabulary to express
[40:55] it but he thought out everything he was
[40:59] going to do
[41:02] and he spoke it
[41:05] and said it in motion
[41:09] and everybody had a place and a time in
[41:13] it
[41:14] nothing was going to catch him by
[41:16] surprise
[41:17] he was all-knowing omnipotent how he
[41:21] knew what it was going to be because it
[41:24] all came from him
[41:27] it's okay he has such a complete
[41:32] to another
[41:33] understanding of what's Happening
[41:35] there's nothing's catching him by
[41:38] surprise
[41:41] so in the original
[41:44] was these thoughts so we we know that
[41:48] what he spoke and what he thought and
[41:53] what he put in motion and how he was
[41:56] going to create the heavens and earth
[41:58] and how he was going to set man on it
[42:01] and how he was going to take from the
[42:03] side of man Eve and how that he was
[42:06] going to allow Eve to fall and and and
[42:10] how that all this was all laid out
[42:16] and spoken
[42:19] and that's the original
[42:23] so there's only one thing that you're
[42:25] going to be able to cash in
[42:28] God's economy and that's the original
[42:33] no bogus dollars at God's spot
[42:37] right so there there is something that's
[42:40] original that that that he had in mind
[42:44] now if we could begin to understand that
[42:47] we have a place in that
[42:52] that we have a part of that
[42:55] and so I uh to express that out to you I
[43:00] want to read a great uh some of these uh
[43:04] statements that uh
[43:08] that I have put down here that I think
[43:12] you will kind of give us uh
[43:16] a kind of a an idea of where we at
[43:20] so he says and this is in the identified
[43:24] Christ in all ages and I think this is
[43:27] the one that he spoke in uh
[43:32] this is the one he spoke in Birmingham
[43:34] Alabama he said
[43:41] the only way to know
[43:44] what he is today is to find out what he
[43:49] was
[43:52] okay
[43:53] so we know that he's what his attributes
[43:57] so the only way for us to know him today
[43:59] is to find out what he was so that's
[44:04] what we that I'm trying to say tonight
[44:06] that's the pursuit of the attributes
[44:10] look we want to know him right because
[44:13] we want to know God we want more of God
[44:15] in order to know more of God you've got
[44:18] to go back to what he was in the
[44:22] beginning what that he really was
[44:25] that's the only way you'll known the
[44:28] only way to know him today is to find
[44:31] out what he was oh aren't you glad that
[44:35] God sent somebody he could talk to could
[44:39] open the seals and could take us all the
[44:42] way back to the beginning
[44:47] the only place the church world can take
[44:50] you is back to the fact that you were
[44:53] dead in your trespasses and sins and
[44:56] that you need a savior
[44:58] oh Hallelujah we had one that took us
[45:02] way back
[45:04] then we can see the masterpiece
[45:09] we can see the attribute
[45:12] of redemption
[45:15] not just a price payer
[45:22] though he paid the price
[45:24] not just a reward
[45:27] for believing on him
[45:30] but to bring us back
[45:34] to
[45:35] where we were
[45:38] in the beginning
[45:41] because remember as we just take this
[45:43] real quick if we can
[45:47] the only way to know what he is today is
[45:49] to find out what he was see
[45:52] he said he's the same yesterday
[45:55] he's the same yesterday today and
[45:58] forever
[45:59] and if we can find out what he was
[46:03] then he has got to be the same today
[46:10] oh
[46:13] who spoke like this man
[46:16] who thought like this man
[46:19] you you can understand just by that one
[46:22] statement how this was a message a love
[46:26] letter to an elected people
[46:30] we don't have a gospel for everybody
[46:34] right we only have a gospel to those
[46:37] that have an ear to hear
[46:40] as I said this morning the the the the
[46:44] nominal gospel they're bringing it to
[46:48] the world to try to get the world to
[46:51] think the way they think so if the world
[46:54] changes they're reliant on the world for
[46:58] their substance and their existence
[47:00] they've got to have people
[47:04] God don't have to have people God
[47:07] doesn't create people
[47:10] he's already got him
[47:13] you understand that he already had the
[47:16] church
[47:19] before he ever created anything he
[47:21] already possessed the church he already
[47:25] possessed the Sons and Daughters of God
[47:27] he just wanted to all those attributes
[47:31] were in him and you were there and he
[47:34] just wanted to fold them out there
[47:37] so you watch The Gospel change
[47:41] now they have mixed marriages in their
[47:45] church now they have gay preachers in
[47:48] their church now they have woman
[47:50] preachers in their church because you
[47:52] know it doesn't matter
[47:55] because their gospel isn't determined by
[47:59] eternal
[48:01] their gospel is not determined by the
[48:05] beginning
[48:07] it's determined by the present now let
[48:10] me say that to you because we don't want
[48:13] to be determined by the presence we want
[48:17] to be determined by the Eternal so what
[48:21] that's what we're looking for we're
[48:23] looking for that original thought
[48:26] that's right
[48:28] amen
[48:29] so as we just read
[48:38] and he's the same yesterday there and
[48:42] now if in first John
[48:44] or Saint John the first chapter we find
[48:46] out here what is written he said
[48:50] by thee inspired by the Holy Spirit
[48:53] he wrote this in the beginning was the
[48:56] word
[48:57] and the Word was with God and the Word
[49:01] was God
[49:03] so you understand now that where what
[49:06] we're talking about you can't go you
[49:09] can't try to know him today
[49:13] did that sink in did you understand
[49:16] that's what the prophet of God told us
[49:18] now it's been laying there for a long
[49:21] time but for some reason it just
[49:24] surfaces up in the hour that we're in
[49:28] because we're at a place that we want to
[49:31] we want to know them more
[49:35] we want to go past believing
[49:40] to knowing
[49:44] can you can you understand the
[49:47] difference
[49:50] you think
[49:52] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[49:55] Among Us may I break it down
[49:58] in the beginning was the
[50:01] eternal
[50:04] he wasn't even God
[50:07] God our English word god is an object of
[50:10] worship
[50:12] but he but there wasn't nothing to
[50:15] worship him he was just Eternal in him
[50:18] was attributes
[50:20] anyone knows what an attribute is in
[50:24] other words in him was his thoughts
[50:30] Just Thoughts
[50:32] that's his attributes
[50:34] then his word
[50:37] and a thought expressed is a word in the
[50:41] beginning was the word before
[50:45] it was even expressed it was a thought
[50:48] in the attribute
[50:51] in the beginning was the word
[50:53] and the Word was with God and the Word
[50:57] was God the word was the attributes of
[51:00] God expressed in him were thoughts
[51:04] all right
[51:07] that's a lot for a poor man to
[51:09] understand
[51:12] you know what I mean I'm glad I've got a
[51:15] Vindicated Messenger to stand on
[51:20] yeah
[51:22] okay
[51:25] and in his thinking
[51:27] he was to be God
[51:30] probably created angels first then he
[51:34] was worshiped he was God in his thinking
[51:37] was to be God
[51:42] that's where it starts
[51:45] in the beginning God
[51:48] created
[51:50] now he just right here
[51:53] is the greatest explanation of Genesis 1
[51:57] 1 you'll ever get
[52:00] fantastic
[52:03] and his thoughts was to be God in the
[52:05] beginning God created Prophet God said
[52:08] he created angels three be worship so he
[52:10] could be God
[52:14] oh I feel like a theologian
[52:19] it says excites me Church
[52:22] this message excites me
[52:25] I went through a period of my life where
[52:27] I just couldn't match up to it I just
[52:29] couldn't match up to it I believed it
[52:31] but it was just such a burden to to to
[52:35] try to live and live it and live it and
[52:38] finally I found out I couldn't live it
[52:41] he was going to live it for me
[52:43] [Applause]
[52:48] Nori
[52:51] that's all I had to do
[52:53] just just finally give up
[52:57] hey
[52:59] Lord
[53:01] I trust in your mercy I can't do it you
[53:05] spoke it it's got to come to pass let it
[53:08] come to pass in me any way that you
[53:11] choose to
[53:18] and then in him was attributes to be
[53:21] father
[53:22] to be son to be savior
[53:25] nothing lost
[53:27] something had to be lost so there had to
[53:31] be a there it had to be
[53:35] made for that
[53:42] oh
[53:44] I wonder I just sit back and what it
[53:46] must have been like to be in this
[53:48] meeting
[53:51] you couldn't have even grasped these
[53:53] things these people were so blessed to
[53:56] hear it and they didn't even know what
[53:58] they were hearing most of them were
[54:00] there for the Loaves and Fishes they
[54:03] were there for the discernment hurry up
[54:05] and get them preaching maybe I'll get
[54:07] healed but he didn't he wasn't preaching
[54:09] to them he was preaching to you tonight
[54:15] way back in 1964 in Birmingham he was
[54:20] preaching to you he was given this
[54:22] message for you he knew you would hear
[54:25] it
[54:35] so there
[54:36] nothing lost something had to be lost so
[54:42] there there had to be a
[54:46] way made for that
[54:49] to be a Healer nothing's sick so he had
[54:53] something had to get sick so he could
[54:56] heal it it's only displaying his
[55:00] attributes
[55:03] now you understand what we're into we're
[55:05] in the pursuit of his attributes so may
[55:08] I say it like this we're in pursuit of
[55:11] his thinking
[55:15] what was he thinking
[55:20] not like we would say it
[55:26] because I felt that way about myself
[55:28] many times
[55:30] but it's beautifully secured
[55:36] and and motivated by love
[55:40] it's only this play of his attributes
[55:42] now remember
[55:45] if you ever did
[55:48] or ever will have eternal life you had
[55:53] it with him then
[55:56] I'm going to read these statements from
[55:58] several places because what are we in
[56:00] pursuit of
[56:03] because if we want to know them we've
[56:06] got to know what it is if we want to
[56:08] come to maturity we got to know what his
[56:10] intention was now his intention was to
[56:14] have fellowship with us in his plans
[56:18] really he don't need our plan
[56:24] he don't need our advice he don't need
[56:26] our counsel
[56:29] VES he just wants to bless us
[56:35] you had it with him then
[56:37] you had it with him
[56:40] because Jesus came
[56:43] and Jesus was the Redeemer
[56:48] to redeem anything is to bring it back
[56:51] from where it had fallen or went from
[56:58] oh
[56:59] that doesn't doesn't the breach just
[57:03] stand out to you
[57:05] between the church and the church ages
[57:10] he didn't come to hang on the cross
[57:14] and everybody feels sorry for him and as
[57:17] many people have recognized that he was
[57:20] God they got eternal life
[57:22] that wasn't God in the beginning that's
[57:25] how man preaches them
[57:27] but that's not how the word preaches
[57:29] them
[57:32] he come back to redeem us to bring us
[57:34] back
[57:36] so that's what we wanted we want to get
[57:38] back to what
[57:40] was it that he had in his mind of us
[57:45] to redempt is to bring it back from
[57:47] whence had fallen or from where it went
[57:50] from redeem it bring it back and you the
[57:54] way you look
[57:56] Who You Are
[57:57] who what your name is that was God's
[58:02] thinking before the foundation of the
[58:04] world
[58:08] and Jesus came not to save the whole
[58:11] thing
[58:13] he wanted to
[58:15] but he come to redeem bring back them
[58:19] that was in his thoughts before the
[58:25] beginning
[58:27] oh Hallelujah
[58:29] do you see that attribute there
[58:33] he wanted to
[58:36] he wanted to save the whole world he
[58:39] died for the whole world but he couldn't
[58:41] bring the whole world back oh how can
[58:44] you miss serpency
[58:49] that's the reason he was the word made
[58:52] flesh
[58:54] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[58:57] to himself the word God's thinking of
[59:02] how he would do it
[59:06] he expressed himself in Christ Jesus it
[59:10] was God becoming material
[59:13] now let's slow on that
[59:16] okay that's the reason he was the word
[59:20] made flesh see God was in Christ
[59:23] wrecking sideward himself the word God's
[59:26] thinking of how he would do it
[59:34] that was before it ever started
[59:39] me
[59:40] he he when he thought you he put your
[59:43] name on the book
[59:45] now he was going to have to have all
[59:47] these things come to pass he's going to
[59:49] have to have lost to be a savior he was
[59:52] going to have to have people sit to
[59:54] express this the whole thing from the
[59:57] beginning was the expression of his
[1:00:00] attributes he just wanted to express
[1:00:03] everything that he was
[1:00:06] and we said it earlier remember that he
[1:00:09] Adam could have never known all of him
[1:00:15] so God had a way a plan
[1:00:18] an expression of that and so all we are
[1:00:23] is we're a part of that great expression
[1:00:26] therefore he says you are the attributes
[1:00:31] of God you are the thoughts of God made
[1:00:34] flesh
[1:00:38] you say well what about my sins well you
[1:00:40] were yet a sinner he died for you
[1:00:45] was that at Calvary no
[1:00:47] he died for you before the foundation of
[1:00:50] the world
[1:00:54] can he ever get it settled
[1:00:57] you're not lost you're not going to be
[1:01:00] lost if you ever had eternal life you
[1:01:03] always had it
[1:01:04] now if you can grasp that attribute
[1:01:08] you understand if we could if we could
[1:01:11] grab a hold if we could pursue that
[1:01:14] attribute if we could bring that level
[1:01:16] of Faith down if we could bring that
[1:01:19] level of understanding now I don't mean
[1:01:22] for Pride I I don't mean for a
[1:01:24] self-glory in everything but to glorify
[1:01:27] him
[1:01:36] of how he would do it
[1:01:38] he expressed himself in Christ Jesus it
[1:01:41] was God becoming material now where you
[1:01:45] are now
[1:01:46] you have to die because yet just like
[1:01:51] uh snapping a picture
[1:01:54] you're a negative
[1:01:56] any negative has got to go into the dark
[1:02:00] room
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:02] through acid to develop the picture to
[1:02:07] make you see what it is
[1:02:10] now we are now in the expressed image of
[1:02:16] him
[1:02:18] it's the negative has been taken
[1:02:21] where human life
[1:02:23] but we must go into the dark room down
[1:02:28] into the grave to go through the
[1:02:31] developing to come back forth in the
[1:02:34] image oh my young forever in old age
[1:02:39] uh
[1:02:40] defects in everything will be taken away
[1:02:43] now I want to let me just finish this
[1:02:45] last period then we are redeemed God's
[1:02:49] attributes right back God's material
[1:02:53] with Christ in the church just like a
[1:02:56] man and wife that's right Christ in the
[1:03:00] bride because it's redeemed back his
[1:03:02] thinking and his thinking is expressed
[1:03:06] out
[1:03:08] but you you say well you have to go into
[1:03:10] the grave you already were in the grave
[1:03:14] if you were dead
[1:03:18] in trespasses in sin don't miss the
[1:03:22] revelation of God's word don't get so
[1:03:25] carnal that you think I gotta go die in
[1:03:28] the grave so that would eliminate the
[1:03:30] Rapture you had to die you were born
[1:03:34] dead
[1:03:41] you had to go there
[1:03:43] so you could be developed
[1:03:46] so the thinking and the attribute could
[1:03:50] become out so to be manifest don't get
[1:03:53] discouraged with yourself
[1:03:57] you know Abraham didn't get discouraged
[1:04:00] he tried his own things
[1:04:02] but the bottom line with Abraham was who
[1:04:05] is the father of our faith if God
[1:04:07] promised it God's able to bring it to
[1:04:09] pass if God said it he's able to bring
[1:04:12] it to pass He's Able out of these stones
[1:04:15] to raise up children of Abraham
[1:04:19] that's what we are Lively stones
[1:04:25] so we we we we take these things and so
[1:04:29] we begin to there's so many other things
[1:04:32] now let's just take this
[1:04:34] here because we want to really grip
[1:04:38] this pursuit of what that we're pursuing
[1:04:43] so we're pursuing the attributes of God
[1:04:47] now the attributes is what produces the
[1:04:51] characteristics
[1:04:53] yes
[1:04:56] is that simple enough
[1:05:00] I had to even catch myself it was just
[1:05:03] like wow
[1:05:05] the attributes produces the
[1:05:08] characteristic the thinking produces the
[1:05:11] characteristic
[1:05:13] if you think that or you think evil or
[1:05:16] you think angry what's going to come out
[1:05:19] angry
[1:05:22] you understand so if we get the thinking
[1:05:25] of God yes the attribute of God the
[1:05:30] attribute produces the characteristic
[1:05:35] God's ability to impart life
[1:05:44] to don't work people they they
[1:05:48] it's what we're pursuing
[1:05:51] and there's we don't want to get caught
[1:05:53] in pursuing gifts
[1:05:56] pursuing manifestations
[1:05:59] pursuing self-indications pursuing
[1:06:02] Revival to pursuing trying to pursue to
[1:06:07] get what happened in the first year of
[1:06:09] change that back happening in this age I
[1:06:12] don't want what happened in the first
[1:06:14] church age I'm sorry
[1:06:17] I wasn't made to sit under Paul's
[1:06:19] Ministry I was made to sit on the
[1:06:22] ministry of the son of man in this age
[1:06:30] I think it's the greatest Ministry
[1:06:32] that's been on the earth since the time
[1:06:34] of our Lord Jesus Christ in fact I
[1:06:36] believe there was no difference in the
[1:06:39] two Ministries except for the Corporal
[1:06:41] body
[1:06:45] I'm Not Looking Back
[1:06:49] right because God's attribute never
[1:06:52] looked back
[1:06:55] it was from here
[1:06:57] to there alpha
[1:06:59] omega beginning the end
[1:07:03] he knew it would be he knew where he was
[1:07:06] taking us he knew he had a new Heaven he
[1:07:08] he knew we walked out of Eden and he
[1:07:11] knew he was going to bring us back to
[1:07:13] Eden Back to Eden
[1:07:19] so we found out that it had to die had
[1:07:22] to be dead right
[1:07:23] this is from God who is rich in Mercy
[1:07:30] am I making myself clear the pursuit of
[1:07:33] the attribute the pursuit of the
[1:07:36] thinking
[1:07:38] because you can't know him today
[1:07:41] unless you knew what he was thinking in
[1:07:45] the beginning
[1:07:46] because what he thought in the beginning
[1:07:49] is what caused what's here today to be
[1:07:58] I just don't want to handle
[1:08:00] tomorrow
[1:08:02] or the next day
[1:08:04] I want to know with a piece in my heart
[1:08:06] it's already been handled for me
[1:08:13] I'm not going anywhere that he doesn't
[1:08:16] allow me to go and I'm not going to end
[1:08:19] up anywhere that he didn't already plan
[1:08:21] for me
[1:08:23] and if I deviate into the permissive
[1:08:26] will
[1:08:28] he'll chastise me he'll correct me and
[1:08:31] he'll bring me back to his perfect will
[1:08:39] I want to take from from then this is
[1:08:42] from the scripture reading we just read
[1:08:43] I want to take from there a few or a
[1:08:47] part of a verse but God
[1:08:50] The God Who is rich in Mercy I want you
[1:08:53] to notice here the prophet the Apostle
[1:08:55] rather Paul
[1:08:58] who had made mention of this now
[1:09:01] you has he quickened
[1:09:04] who were once dead
[1:09:06] you have to quickened who were once dead
[1:09:10] dead in sin and trespasses walking after
[1:09:14] the things of the world the desires of
[1:09:17] Flesh and fulfilling the desires of the
[1:09:21] mind you were dead
[1:09:25] the seed had to go into the ground
[1:09:29] The Original Seed
[1:09:32] the original thought Christ manifested
[1:09:36] that because he came without sin
[1:09:41] right and he was the mystery of God
[1:09:43] revealed so we saw that he went into the
[1:09:47] ground
[1:09:48] so everybody wonders oh do I have to die
[1:09:51] to go in the Rapture no
[1:09:53] you were dead
[1:09:55] you were in the ground
[1:09:58] but he resurrected us
[1:10:01] so let's just follow this through it's
[1:10:04] beautiful
[1:10:09] in the mind what caused this change
[1:10:14] you see what caused it from one time
[1:10:18] being dead
[1:10:20] to quickened means Made Alive
[1:10:24] what caused it
[1:10:29] now
[1:10:31] you could take the temporal solution
[1:10:34] or you could tape the present day
[1:10:37] thinking
[1:10:38] what caused it
[1:10:40] was that you accepted Christ
[1:10:47] you came along in life you were dead in
[1:10:50] sins and trespasses and you recognize
[1:10:53] Christ
[1:10:54] and so you accepted him as Lord and
[1:10:56] Savior and you changed your ways
[1:11:02] I'm here to tell you the cost goes way
[1:11:05] past that
[1:11:10] just watch how he lays it out
[1:11:18] he says Made Alive there was a change
[1:11:21] from Death To Life
[1:11:24] there is no other there is no other
[1:11:27] thing that could happen to any person so
[1:11:31] great as to change him from Death To
[1:11:35] Life
[1:11:36] amen if he was dying physically
[1:11:40] he could be healed physically that would
[1:11:42] be a great thing
[1:11:44] but nothing so great as he was in the
[1:11:48] spiritually dead and God had quickened
[1:11:51] him to life
[1:11:53] you once in times Past Dead
[1:11:57] you were dead
[1:12:01] even many here tonight one time you can
[1:12:05] look back and know that you were dead
[1:12:10] but now we aren't
[1:12:12] you're you're
[1:12:15] and but now why aren't you dead
[1:12:19] tonight as you were then
[1:12:22] you deserve to be that way because you
[1:12:26] were a sinner but God who is rich in
[1:12:29] Mercy
[1:12:30] [Music]
[1:12:32] that's the thing God who is Rich
[1:12:35] in Mercy all these things
[1:12:39] that we were but God
[1:12:43] that made the change right there God who
[1:12:48] is rich in mercy God made the change
[1:12:52] yeah
[1:12:53] amen but God can't change
[1:13:01] so where was the change made
[1:13:05] Hallelujah
[1:13:09] let's just follow
[1:13:14] uh you know let me
[1:13:16] I just have such mixed emotions this
[1:13:19] just us tonight so
[1:13:21] you know I just preach you know someone
[1:13:23] came up to me the other day and says he
[1:13:25] said you know what everybody says you're
[1:13:27] a Maverick
[1:13:29] I said great
[1:13:32] and fine you know but I'm just going to
[1:13:36] be Maverick
[1:13:38] a lot of people said I wish I'd have
[1:13:40] been there in brother rem's meetings
[1:13:44] and that would have been great
[1:13:46] but but
[1:13:48] I am seeing the unfolding of his word
[1:13:51] and the reason I love it I know that's
[1:13:54] where God placed me is to be here and
[1:13:58] have the storehouse already laid up it
[1:14:01] would have been good to see in the
[1:14:03] discernment it would have good to seeing
[1:14:05] the Miracles it would have could been
[1:14:07] from all that but the 99 of those people
[1:14:10] don't even follow the message
[1:14:13] I'm so glad I'm in the day where it's
[1:14:17] made available and the spirit of God's
[1:14:20] proving that everything he said through
[1:14:23] that messenger is exactly the truth
[1:14:26] so let's go God rich and mercy
[1:14:29] so I'm glad for that he being rich in
[1:14:32] Mercy
[1:14:34] if he was rich in money
[1:14:36] if he could just rich in materials
[1:14:40] if he is
[1:14:41] but yet the greatest thing is being rich
[1:14:45] in Mercy oh what a great word that is
[1:14:49] how that we were once dead
[1:14:59] many
[1:15:00] and we were speaking the other night
[1:15:04] how that a seed Must Die
[1:15:07] everything around that germ of life
[1:15:11] must not only die but rot if it doesn't
[1:15:16] rot it cannot live it's rot completely
[1:15:19] done away with it's finished
[1:15:23] and until we get to the place that our
[1:15:26] own ideas and own thinking is completely
[1:15:30] gone and rotted away from us that germ
[1:15:35] of Life can't begin to live
[1:15:40] then the germ of life
[1:15:44] can begin to live
[1:15:47] so when we get away from our ideas we
[1:15:51] pursue the attribute
[1:15:53] which was his thinking then the germ of
[1:15:57] Life can live the German life hasn't
[1:15:59] been living
[1:16:02] the man has been living the their idea
[1:16:06] of the germ of life
[1:16:08] but if we if we could pursue the
[1:16:10] attribute we would find out what God's
[1:16:13] original thinking of us was because it's
[1:16:16] hidden Christ that's right and revealed
[1:16:19] in his word
[1:16:25] The Germ of Life can begin to live
[1:16:28] now we might I might inject a little bit
[1:16:31] of Doctrine here
[1:16:33] if you don't believe it all right
[1:16:37] that's just okay I do believe it
[1:16:41] I believe that a man when he is Born
[1:16:45] Into the world
[1:16:46] that when you're a little baby born into
[1:16:50] the world you could not have been there
[1:16:53] without being in the foreknowledge of
[1:16:56] God
[1:16:57] because he's
[1:16:59] he is infinite and knows all things
[1:17:03] and when that little baby is born into
[1:17:06] the world
[1:17:07] there is something in that baby if he is
[1:17:11] ever going to have life
[1:17:16] there is a little something in there in
[1:17:20] that child then that come that he comes
[1:17:25] to sooner or later
[1:17:28] the little seed is in him
[1:17:32] now if you'll take the scriptures plenty
[1:17:36] declare that
[1:17:39] now if you've got eternal life tonight
[1:17:43] we have eternal life
[1:17:45] then we always were
[1:17:48] because there's only one form of eternal
[1:17:52] life
[1:17:53] we always
[1:17:55] were we always were
[1:18:05] did you get it
[1:18:06] [Music]
[1:18:08] I'm not going to get it till I start
[1:18:10] pursuing the attributes of God
[1:18:14] Joe I'm not trying to pursue a
[1:18:16] Vindication I'm not trying to pursue a
[1:18:19] manifestation I'm not trying to pursue a
[1:18:22] recognition
[1:18:25] I'm not trying to pursue a sign or a
[1:18:28] Wonder those things we will do if God so
[1:18:32] permits but let us move on to perfection
[1:18:38] what's perfect
[1:18:41] tell me the only thing that's perfect
[1:18:44] the word of God the thinking of God it's
[1:18:48] perfect Satan's tried to pervert it
[1:18:50] manipulate it turn it change it but
[1:18:53] unbelief has never stop God the plan of
[1:18:56] God is going on just the same with
[1:18:58] everybody he predestined it to and
[1:19:01] there's nothing that he thought of that
[1:19:03] would ever be lost
[1:19:05] you might get discouraged sometimes at
[1:19:08] the things your kids do but just
[1:19:10] remember they'll come to it sooner or
[1:19:11] later
[1:19:14] they will
[1:19:18] because they were born with it
[1:19:20] in them
[1:19:22] that's why their lives are so miserable
[1:19:24] don't you like to have something in you
[1:19:27] because I'm going to read Because makes
[1:19:30] a statement that's wonderful
[1:19:34] you'll come to it sooner or later the
[1:19:35] little seed
[1:19:36] whiskey
[1:19:38] then he said you we always were and the
[1:19:42] reason we were because we are a part of
[1:19:46] God and God is the only thing that's
[1:19:51] eternal
[1:19:54] oh my
[1:19:56] we were part of that thinking we were a
[1:20:00] part of him when he thought in the
[1:20:02] beginning you were there he knew the
[1:20:05] color of your hair the color of your
[1:20:07] eyes everything about you that's where
[1:20:09] you started where were you when the sons
[1:20:11] and dogs shouted for Joy before the
[1:20:14] foundation of the world before there
[1:20:16] ever was a star your name was on The
[1:20:18] Book of Life there you were now it's
[1:20:20] hard for you to take that
[1:20:25] and bring it into this flesh
[1:20:28] and have that attribute of God change
[1:20:32] this body in this mind
[1:20:36] but if the mind that was in Christ be in
[1:20:40] you if the spirit that was in Christ be
[1:20:43] in you it will Quicken your mortal body
[1:20:46] what's going to Quicken your body is the
[1:20:49] attribute that was in the beginning
[1:20:54] not some good work
[1:20:58] it was the thought of God of you in the
[1:21:01] beginning being in that Resurrection
[1:21:06] that's what's going to do it
[1:21:09] I don't know if that's my place
[1:21:11] I might be come by the way of the Grave
[1:21:14] I might get a new coat when I'm not
[1:21:17] going to die if I if I die here
[1:21:20] you're going to stick this old Wretched
[1:21:22] Man In The Grave and you might dance
[1:21:26] around and sing I'm so glad you're dead
[1:21:29] it's the nicest thing anyone's ever done
[1:21:31] for me you know it like that it don't
[1:21:33] matter
[1:21:34] because if I have a body waiting I'm not
[1:21:37] going to go here I'm not going to fall
[1:21:39] in the regions of the Lost I'm going to
[1:21:41] go to that place that he wants me to be
[1:21:43] until he finishes the work of my life
[1:21:46] and places me in his kingdom
[1:21:51] it's all predetermined
[1:21:54] it's all pre-planned
[1:21:56] the question for me is what am I
[1:21:59] pursuing
[1:22:02] we try to pursue a better life we try to
[1:22:05] pursue works we try to pursue we try to
[1:22:08] pursue that and we could ever if we
[1:22:10] would pursue the thought of God he would
[1:22:13] give us the revelation of it
[1:22:17] and it's transforming
[1:22:21] we're just about done here
[1:22:25] he says
[1:22:27] and the reason we were because we are a
[1:22:31] part of God and God is the only thing
[1:22:35] that's eternal
[1:22:38] I mean what a way to say it we always
[1:22:41] were
[1:22:45] may God let it sink into us
[1:22:50] and like as Melchizedek reteached
[1:22:52] received tithes from Abraham and it was
[1:22:55] allotted to his great-grandson Levi who
[1:22:59] was yet in the loins of Abraham paid
[1:23:02] tithes he was yet in the loins of
[1:23:04] Abraham when he met Melchizedek I want
[1:23:08] to speak on that over at the other place
[1:23:12] one morning who is this Melchizedek
[1:23:16] now notice that way back God knew this
[1:23:20] boy coming down he knows all things
[1:23:23] now we are part of God you always was
[1:23:27] you don't remember it because you were
[1:23:30] only in the attribute in God
[1:23:34] you were only in his thinking
[1:23:39] your very name
[1:23:42] if it ever was in The Book of Life it
[1:23:46] was put there before the foundation of
[1:23:48] the world he knew what you were
[1:23:53] I'm saying this
[1:23:55] not to mix up Doctrine
[1:23:58] but to straighten it out
[1:24:00] that we might get away from all this
[1:24:03] fear and scare
[1:24:06] you don't know who you are
[1:24:09] you are not going to be
[1:24:12] but now you are the sons of God you
[1:24:18] always were the sons of God
[1:24:22] daughters you place yourself there too
[1:24:25] for when God had you in his thinking
[1:24:30] at the beginning
[1:24:31] you have to be some part of you your
[1:24:36] life that's in you now had to be with
[1:24:39] God before there
[1:24:45] foreign
[1:24:47] am I coming close to what I'm trying to
[1:24:49] say if you have eternal life
[1:24:53] there's a part of you that was in God
[1:24:55] thinking that was always there you were
[1:24:58] an attribute
[1:24:59] that's what we need to be pursuing
[1:25:05] what was it
[1:25:08] that you had of me
[1:25:10] what what what was it that that could
[1:25:14] that you had in mind for me what was it
[1:25:16] that you were trying to express from me
[1:25:18] what part of me I want to contact that
[1:25:22] part of me
[1:25:24] we use the word theophany for that
[1:25:28] God's thinking contacting the thinking
[1:25:32] that God had of us in the beginning if
[1:25:35] it was his thinking it's what his word
[1:25:42] oh I got a beautiful quote I'm not going
[1:25:44] to read it tonight because I've already
[1:25:46] got longer and I wanted to be but he
[1:25:48] said word meets word
[1:26:00] for which for when God had you in his
[1:26:04] thinking in the beginning you have to be
[1:26:07] some part of you your life
[1:26:10] that's in you now had to be with God
[1:26:13] before there well when he before he even
[1:26:18] before he even become material here on
[1:26:21] Earth
[1:26:22] before there was anything but but God
[1:26:25] you were one of his attributes
[1:26:29] he knows what your name would be he know
[1:26:32] the color of your hair you would have he
[1:26:35] knows all about you the only thing
[1:26:38] happened is when you being a sinner
[1:26:43] how many of you can fellowship with me
[1:26:46] on this thought when you as a little boy
[1:26:49] or a little girl you would walk around
[1:26:52] and there would be certain things that
[1:26:55] would just
[1:26:56] where it wouldn't bother the other kids
[1:26:59] it seemed like that was something in you
[1:27:02] that just cried out
[1:27:04] there was God somewhere yet you were a
[1:27:07] sinner you remember that certainly now
[1:27:11] what was that that was that little
[1:27:16] form of life
[1:27:18] in you then
[1:27:27] I know we have a great desire for fruit
[1:27:31] we have a Great Divide desire to see the
[1:27:34] hand of God
[1:27:36] move
[1:27:37] we we have a great desire to see great
[1:27:42] signs and wonders because we're promised
[1:27:44] those signs and wonders
[1:27:47] okay
[1:27:49] but we don't want to get there by
[1:27:52] something that won't live
[1:27:58] if we could if we can catch the life
[1:28:03] the life was to give the ability for it
[1:28:07] to reproduce
[1:28:08] the life of the church if its ability
[1:28:13] to come back to the thinking of God
[1:28:18] then you don't have to when when the
[1:28:22] attributes of what God had intended for
[1:28:25] you and if and when we can make contact
[1:28:28] if we could pursue that if we pursue
[1:28:31] that word in the light of the message of
[1:28:35] the hour
[1:28:37] what's happening is people are taking
[1:28:39] the scriptures and they're reading the
[1:28:41] Miracles they're reading things or
[1:28:43] reading about the days of Pentecost
[1:28:45] they're reading about the book of Acts
[1:28:47] and they're trying to pursue that and
[1:28:49] all they're going to get is the fruit of
[1:28:51] another age you might as well go build
[1:28:53] an ark yeah
[1:28:57] exactly right
[1:28:59] but if we can pursue that God's got
[1:29:01] something for us
[1:29:04] that's exceedingly and abundantly above
[1:29:06] what we can ask or think that there's
[1:29:09] something that he laid in the word can
[1:29:11] this voice
[1:29:13] that came to us in this day was none
[1:29:16] other than the voice of God to speak
[1:29:20] those thoughts into existence in US
[1:29:27] because they've got to be there
[1:29:30] it's already been spoken it's already
[1:29:33] been finished we've had eternal life our
[1:29:36] names are written on the book
[1:29:39] we're looking for that hour that that we
[1:29:42] can pursue what it was that he thought
[1:29:45] of me
[1:29:47] I know we've touched on it I'm preaching
[1:29:49] messages like the real me and the real
[1:29:51] things those were that was just God the
[1:29:55] fixing our minds and again bringing us
[1:29:58] aware almost feeding us breadcrumbs
[1:30:04] but now for those who are serious with
[1:30:06] God
[1:30:09] those that feel a call
[1:30:11] in their heart a deep calling to a deep
[1:30:15] you're not calling for days gone by
[1:30:20] you're not calling
[1:30:22] for a restoration of what's already
[1:30:26] passed because I could I just read the
[1:30:29] quota we heard it this morning after
[1:30:31] it's manifested it's past
[1:30:36] I'm looking for the what lies
[1:30:39] in front of us
[1:30:41] that's what I want to be in pursuit of
[1:30:45] the word attribute thought of God that
[1:30:49] lies before the church let us move into
[1:30:52] that
[1:30:54] you say well how are we going to get
[1:30:56] there by the same way that God always
[1:31:00] does everything with this church by
[1:31:02] divine revelation
[1:31:05] faith in Revelation Faith cometh by
[1:31:09] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:31:14] our messenger said I am the voice of God
[1:31:17] to you
[1:31:19] now I don't care what anybody else
[1:31:21] produces I don't care what other
[1:31:23] churches do none of that matters to me
[1:31:26] but I want you to know as your pastor
[1:31:28] that I believe what God's going to bring
[1:31:30] to pass is going to come to pass by this
[1:31:32] voice and that's why we're more than
[1:31:35] happy to play tapes here
[1:31:41] because it's life
[1:31:44] now we didn't play the tape tonight but
[1:31:46] we read it
[1:31:48] so that you could see that he said it
[1:31:50] and that it's laid out before his plane
[1:31:53] the attributes of God are his thinking
[1:31:56] you are the thoughts of God what were
[1:32:00] you thinking
[1:32:01] Lord
[1:32:02] let this mind be in me that was in
[1:32:06] Christ Jesus
[1:32:11] he became me that I might become him
[1:32:14] what was he he was the thoughts of God
[1:32:17] expressed
[1:32:20] he became everything that God thought of
[1:32:23] him
[1:32:24] but you want to become what God thought
[1:32:27] of you
[1:32:30] and that's what I mean when I say the
[1:32:32] pursuit of the attribute we want to be a
[1:32:37] people
[1:32:38] that thinks
[1:32:40] what he thought
[1:32:45] we're not going to build a boat
[1:32:47] we're not going to cross the Red Sea
[1:32:51] we're stepping into another land
[1:32:54] another dimension another age called the
[1:32:58] bright age we're coming into a Capstone
[1:33:00] of perfect love God's got such a
[1:33:03] wonderful thing laid ahead for his
[1:33:06] church and you could get rid of the
[1:33:09] scare
[1:33:10] right
[1:33:12] don't say oh I'm going to miss it no I'm
[1:33:14] not going to miss it
[1:33:16] it's already predetermined for me
[1:33:19] because God is rich in mercy God bless
[1:33:24] you tonight we just keep fellowshipping
[1:33:26] on God's word brother Billy God bless
[1:33:28] you
