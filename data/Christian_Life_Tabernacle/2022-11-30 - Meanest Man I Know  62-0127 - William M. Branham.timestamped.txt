[19:41] [Music]
[19:43] thank you
[19:46] uh last Sunday evening
[19:51] someone kind of broke into the church
[19:53] and
[19:54] so we caught him on camera walking
[19:56] around you know and doing everything
[19:59] they got about three laptops from us
[20:01] that's all
[20:03] and they stacked all speakers and the
[20:05] computers and everything by the door
[20:08] and they were getting ready to go
[20:11] Christmas shopping
[20:14] but they picked the wrong
[20:17] store and for some reason they just
[20:20] turned around and ran out we lost three
[20:24] little laptops but the Lord really
[20:26] looked after us so we're gonna try to uh
[20:31] make some improvements on our security
[20:34] but you know we got to they the police
[20:38] wanted to know if they wanted us to file
[20:40] charges
[20:42] and have them arrested if we could
[20:45] identify them
[20:46] and uh
[20:48] Matthew said well let us get them saved
[20:50] first
[20:52] so anyway just pray for him you know
[20:55] what I mean I I feel sorry for him
[20:58] you know I mean
[21:01] uh he has no idea the scripture says if
[21:05] they would have known whom it was they
[21:08] would not have crucified him so I I'm
[21:10] sure he didn't have any idea he just
[21:12] thought this was some nominal place but
[21:15] we know it's more than that and really
[21:18] that's the kind of person we want to
[21:20] come in and feel the presence of the
[21:22] Lord and the conviction of the Holy
[21:25] Spirit
[21:26] uh tonight I just felt led on my heart
[21:29] to play a message for us and
[21:33] um it's called the meanest man I know
[21:38] and it was preached the first of January
[21:41] I mean it was preached in January 27
[21:45] 1962.
[21:48] so if you have your phones and you want
[21:50] to look it up and follow along uh we're
[21:54] going to start where brother Bram says
[21:55] I'd like to read a scripture for you
[21:57] Luke I believe it's Luke 7 36 is where
[22:03] we're going to start and and listen to
[22:06] this and
[22:08] this is a this is a a message where
[22:13] brother Branham is going to preach a
[22:16] drama
[22:17] he's going to preach a story
[22:20] but in the story he puts building blocks
[22:24] and nuggets and and things to consider
[22:28] and he points out in this message a lot
[22:33] of things that the church is walking
[22:36] away from
[22:37] and what's attracting them how they're
[22:40] being attracted to this Sensations and
[22:43] they're being attracted to many things
[22:46] and they're leaving the
[22:50] the main thing
[22:52] the love of God shed abroad in their
[22:54] heart by the Holy Spirit they're leaving
[22:57] the main thing behind
[23:00] and I think as we listen to it and we
[23:04] get to the end many of you may have
[23:07] heard this and he begins to talk about
[23:09] the lady that washed his feet
[23:12] I think that it's a real reminder
[23:16] of what the world's looking for the
[23:20] world's not looking for more power more
[23:23] might the world's looking for real pure
[23:27] love
[23:29] and real love has to be attached to the
[23:33] word of God
[23:35] so uh if you you do have that and you
[23:38] can find it on your phone or your tablet
[23:40] uh on my phone it was paragraph 19.
[23:45] um I don't know what yours might be but
[23:48] I'm just waiting if you have a second uh
[23:52] and uh so he's he where he starts he's
[23:58] uh he he just says
[24:01] um
[24:02] he says uh
[24:05] uh I you know you said I'd just like to
[24:07] get what he says uh here he says
[24:12] he says tomorrow he says now tomorrow
[24:14] afternoon the word willing I'll be
[24:16] speaking to you preaching the Lord
[24:19] willing now if you would like to read
[24:22] the text or write it down for this
[24:26] morning for a little simple drama
[24:29] I would like you for you to read Luke 17
[24:35] 36 and so that's where we're going to
[24:39] start and uh some might maybe like to
[24:42] look here you can watch on the board
[24:44] but uh
[24:46] so I think we'll just jump right into
[24:49] the tape of brother random uh is going
[24:53] to read several scriptures so let's just
[24:55] ask a word of prayer and I I don't
[24:58] believe that this is going to return
[25:00] void
[25:02] but I believe it'll bless your life
[25:04] and after all you're hearing the
[25:07] messenger of the age
[25:08] that's pretty good
[25:10] amen so let's pray father we ask you to
[25:12] bless this word tested this evening
[25:14] we've gathered together Lord but most of
[25:17] all we invite the spirit
[25:21] that anointed this preaching
[25:24] to come into our midst
[25:27] father and anoint our hearts and our
[25:31] ears
[25:33] father because I know because it's
[25:36] promised that you would Stand by Your
[25:39] Word father and mother's shame to
[25:41] identify with this message
[25:43] Lord our congregations not ashamed to
[25:46] have the picture of the pillar of fire
[25:48] on our wall
[25:49] we're not ashamed father to have the
[25:52] cloud and the pyramid father we're not
[25:54] ashamed to identify with the only path
[25:58] that leads to the Rapture and the
[26:01] resurrection
[26:03] Lord I know we bear much reproach
[26:06] because people claim that they have you
[26:10] my father
[26:11] they only have the historical image of
[26:15] you
[26:16] that they've created in their own minds
[26:19] father because of divine revelation we
[26:22] know that you are your word
[26:24] and where your word is you are
[26:27] and father we know we're going to hear
[26:29] your word tonight so we ask you to touch
[26:31] our sick
[26:33] to touch our brokenhearted to touch our
[26:36] needy to touch our souls father may we
[26:39] increase spiritually tonight may we
[26:42] receive overcoming power for we ask it
[26:46] in Jesus name amen is just about what
[26:51] time now is it it's 7 25 so uh eight we
[26:56] should be out by about quarter to nine
[26:58] and we won't linger but it's about an
[27:00] hour 20 minutes enjoy
[27:03] and I know you will as we listen to the
[27:05] meanest man
[27:07] I know God bless you
[27:15] Lord willing now if you'd like to read
[27:19] the text or write it down for this
[27:21] morning for a little simple drama I
[27:23] would like for you to read Saint Luke 7
[27:26] 36. and one of the Pharisees desire him
[27:30] that he would eat with him
[27:33] and he went into the Pharisees house and
[27:37] sat down
[27:39] to eat
[27:41] very simple
[27:43] we're all acquainted with the story
[27:47] I believe that it must have been about
[27:50] Sundown
[27:52] when The Courier arrived
[27:55] he was tired his feet were Dusty as
[28:00] hair was matted together with dust and
[28:03] perspiration
[28:05] because he had run most of the day
[28:10] he had a a duty to perform and he had to
[28:15] hurry and do it
[28:17] so he'd probably went into
[28:19] Capernaum and they told him in Capernaum
[28:22] yes uh he was here a few days ago but
[28:25] he's gone
[28:26] then he went into Nazareth and so forth
[28:30] a city after City
[28:33] finally long about late in the afternoon
[28:35] the sun setting tired feet soar weary he
[28:41] finally had met the one that he was
[28:44] searching for
[28:46] Jesus of Nazareth
[28:49] or if we could only be like that
[28:52] run
[28:54] City to city place to place until
[28:56] finally we're in his presence
[29:00] it must have been Phillip
[29:03] Phillip was kind of the outside guard
[29:06] seemingly they met him first before they
[29:09] got into the other Apostles say like
[29:12] Jesus
[29:13] setting somewhere and there was John
[29:17] leaning on his bosom Peter representing
[29:20] faith and love was closeness to Jesus
[29:24] so Philip probably brought this Courier
[29:27] to uh to let's say Peter
[29:31] Peter brought him on into the presence
[29:33] of Jesus and he was tired he'd been
[29:37] preaching all day and perhaps his voice
[29:40] honey husky husk with the soreness and
[29:44] dust from the day of the people tramping
[29:47] on the ground and the dust coming up
[29:49] his strength depleted
[29:52] as he must have stood and talked to the
[29:55] people about the word of God
[29:58] looking out upon him and seeing how that
[30:01] they were hungering and thirsting would
[30:04] explain to them
[30:06] how God brought about all of his great
[30:09] works oh I would have loved to have been
[30:12] there to listen to that
[30:15] no doubt I believe that every person
[30:17] here would a long to be there do you
[30:20] hear what he had to say
[30:22] listen to his Doctrine what his Doctrine
[30:26] was how he expressed himself and what
[30:30] type of a voice he had look upon his
[30:33] face and the scene performing his works
[30:36] and Discerning the thoughts of the
[30:39] people and telling them of different
[30:40] things and diseases they had and
[30:43] pronouncing them heal I would have loved
[30:45] to have been there oh my I would like to
[30:48] see that
[30:49] and perhaps maybe he just got through
[30:52] with the sermon of you know Jesus first
[30:55] Doctrine did you ever know what it was
[30:57] you must be born again that was his
[31:01] first Doctrine
[31:03] you must be born again so he might have
[31:05] went back to Genesis and began and said
[31:07] in the beginning
[31:10] God said let there be and there was
[31:16] and he said let everything that I have
[31:18] spoken bring forth of its kind
[31:21] and it did
[31:23] then he might have brought something
[31:25] like this saying well now that it brings
[31:29] forth but yet you can take these seeds
[31:33] and you can mix them together
[31:35] and you can get what's called a hybrid
[31:38] product
[31:40] beautiful
[31:41] very nice but it isn't the original
[31:45] you let it go it'll go back to its kind
[31:48] again
[31:49] and a hybrid product can never stand the
[31:53] roughness in the treatment
[31:55] that the original can stand
[31:59] one old long-horned star of one of your
[32:02] herpes to death out on the prayer in the
[32:05] wintertime
[32:06] she can make her own way like a deer but
[32:08] you're hybrid Hereford
[32:10] your hybrid dreaming this you die out
[32:13] there you have to bathe him
[32:16] and he if he was standing today I
[32:19] believe he'd say something like it to us
[32:20] not only have we hybrided
[32:24] fruit
[32:26] animals but with hybrid religion
[32:30] has to be babied and petted
[32:33] it's not the original
[32:35] we try to take uh the word of God and
[32:39] breed it into something else breathe it
[32:41] all over here and it becomes a bunch of
[32:44] delicate babies that we have to babies
[32:48] they can't take the real world
[32:52] he might have been saying something like
[32:54] that
[32:55] then he might have said you see really
[32:58] your lives are hybrid
[33:01] father said don't touch the tree but
[33:04] Satan said it won't hurt you so
[33:07] therefore your life now is in a hybrid
[33:10] condition
[33:12] and that life cannot go back to itself
[33:16] because read that fact you can take the
[33:19] donkey and breed it to the horse and the
[33:22] mayor it'll produce some you but the
[33:24] mule the mother mule and father mule
[33:27] cannot have a baby mule you have to keep
[33:29] hybrid
[33:31] same thing with corn it's beautiful but
[33:34] your red Readers Digest what all these
[33:36] hybrid things are doing to the people
[33:39] hybrid chickens
[33:41] they say that in 20 years if it isn't
[33:44] stopped what will happen
[33:45] women cannot have babies no more they're
[33:48] becoming stronger at closing up
[33:50] smaller in the hips can't have the baby
[33:53] leave things the way they are
[33:56] let God alone that's where this word
[33:58] leave it like it is
[34:01] don't try to add something to it to fit
[34:03] a Creed
[34:05] keep it just the way God said it believe
[34:08] it that'll make a husky strong Christian
[34:12] not a baby that has to be the
[34:14] nominational baby
[34:15] patted around letter from church one
[34:18] denomination to another when he puts his
[34:20] name on the book in heaven it's settled
[34:22] forever
[34:24] Jesus might have said now in order to
[34:27] get back to the original
[34:30] God has to speak again
[34:34] that's what he does when he gives you
[34:36] New Birth your old life is gone in your
[34:39] back to the original word of the law
[34:42] you're not your hybrid into churches
[34:45] denominations but when God speaks gives
[34:49] peace and the Holy Spirit then you're
[34:51] back in the original family of God again
[34:54] you don't have to be baby then you're a
[34:56] rugged Christian who can stand it go to
[34:59] the Cross to the fiery furnace to the
[35:02] Lion's Den or wherever it may be because
[35:05] the word of the living God's burning in
[35:07] your heart and soul
[35:09] they all can backslide all can turn
[35:12] against you and everything else but that
[35:14] won't stop one thing that rugged word of
[35:17] God stays right there when he spoke that
[35:19] original voice
[35:20] into your heart you are mine
[35:25] I suppose maybe on something like that I
[35:28] don't know but he might have been
[35:29] speaking
[35:30] and his voice is horse
[35:33] his lips parched his face read from the
[35:38] direct rays of the Palestinian sun which
[35:42] is very hot
[35:44] and then maybe Philip and Peter waiting
[35:48] till he finished and then maybe he said
[35:50] this at the last
[35:52] see
[35:54] and you shall find
[35:58] and by the time he finished that Peter
[36:00] might have said Lord
[36:03] here is a man that's been sent from a
[36:06] certain place by a certain man and he
[36:09] wishes to speak with you
[36:12] and he's looked down at him and said say
[36:15] on
[36:16] never too tired but what he's ready to
[36:19] listen to anything you want to say he's
[36:21] the same today
[36:23] no matter how late it is tonight
[36:26] how weary he might be he's still ready
[36:30] to answer anything question that you'll
[36:33] ask him
[36:34] and he said this Courier perhaps thought
[36:37] this is a
[36:39] time that his journey was over so he
[36:42] said to him a certain certain Cardinal
[36:46] Bishop something Pharisee
[36:50] my master
[36:52] is going to have a great feast
[36:56] and he's honored you
[37:00] because my master is a great man
[37:04] and he's honored you
[37:06] seeing the crowd that's around you the
[37:08] Lord
[37:10] see the way you're dressed
[37:12] and yet he wants you to come and visit
[37:15] him at this Feast it's such and such a
[37:17] Time
[37:18] Jesus always goes where he's invited no
[37:23] matter where it's at you'll come or he
[37:26] come to a lion's den one time to fiery
[37:28] furnace
[37:30] I believe it was David said I'll make my
[37:33] bed in hell he'll be there
[37:36] you come to the poorest to the richest
[37:40] to the most immoral to the meanest to
[37:44] the lowest
[37:47] you'll come anywhere he's invited
[37:51] no matter what your conditions and
[37:53] position in life is he'll still come
[37:56] that makes him crowd to me
[37:58] humble
[38:00] I'll be there go tell your master I'll
[38:04] be there at that such and such a date
[38:06] I'll be there
[38:08] that most miserable Courier
[38:13] how could he have done it
[38:16] I wish I could have had his place
[38:19] turn this back upon the Lord and run
[38:22] away with a satisfied
[38:25] feeling that he had pleased his master
[38:30] so many times we're guilty of that
[38:34] we're so interested I was reading in the
[38:38] um Nicene fathers of post-nicine council
[38:43] they were Saint Augustine of Hippo
[38:47] setting with Saint Martin one day as
[38:50] he's visiting at the monastery
[38:53] out in the backyard in the garden
[38:56] God gave him the opportunity to receive
[38:59] the Holy Ghost like Martin did but he
[39:02] turned it away
[39:04] so interested in the
[39:07] the dogmas of Rome till he couldn't
[39:10] receive the Holy Spirit
[39:13] many times we get that way
[39:16] so interested in other things
[39:19] sometimes we're so interested in time
[39:24] that we are brought right into the
[39:27] presence of the Lord Jesus
[39:30] walk away
[39:33] a man interested me the other night on
[39:36] the platform when he was speaking about
[39:37] going to one of the conventions and
[39:39] taking his whiskey and cigars
[39:42] that's all he known about a convention
[39:46] but I'm glad that he accepted the
[39:49] opportunity
[39:54] so many times we don't do that
[39:57] accept the opportunity
[39:59] this Courier
[40:02] delivering the message
[40:04] and in the presence of the Lord Jesus
[40:08] and yet but the stupid enough if I must
[40:11] say it
[40:12] to turn away and think that he had did
[40:16] all that was necessary
[40:19] sometimes we go to school and get a PhD
[40:22] or lld
[40:25] go into a Pentecostal meeting and
[40:27] they're telling that the days of
[40:29] Miracles has passed because the bishop
[40:31] sent us to tell him so
[40:33] and turn away from the very fact that
[40:35] we're in the presence of Jesus Christ
[40:38] what an opportunity God gave that man
[40:41] that poor miserable man
[40:45] I wish I could have stood there I'd have
[40:48] fell down at his feet the first thing
[40:49] before I said anything about what the
[40:51] Cardinal wanted
[40:53] I said Lord Jesus be merciful to me a
[40:55] sinner
[40:56] that had been the first thing in my life
[40:59] knowing that he was life in the only
[41:03] resource
[41:05] the God was through him
[41:08] I would accepted him
[41:10] let him be my personal savior person let
[41:13] the mission that the Cardinal had give
[41:15] me are the pope for district man or
[41:18] whatever he was
[41:20] that'd give me a mission out of salt
[41:22] Christ first
[41:26] I think that ought to be the sole Duty
[41:29] of every man woman that can't sees
[41:32] meetings
[41:34] regardless of what somebody else said
[41:36] you've been brought into the presence of
[41:39] Christ
[41:42] no matter how successful or unsuccessful
[41:45] no matter how great or how poor
[41:48] no matter what you are
[41:52] not the first opportunity fall at his
[41:56] feet and say Lord be merciful to me
[42:01] then come tell the businessman you'd
[42:03] like to like them in the rain
[42:06] put God first
[42:08] this most miserable man
[42:12] how we would look at him this morning
[42:15] if we could pull back the curtain
[42:18] and see if that was continually his
[42:22] attitude to turn from the presence of
[42:25] Christ when he had the opportunity to
[42:27] stand by him
[42:29] what a miserable person that is yet
[42:31] today
[42:33] because he lives somewhere
[42:35] and it might be you and I after this
[42:37] meeting today
[42:39] it depends on our attitude when we're in
[42:41] his presence
[42:42] always accepted
[42:45] but he turned his back upon the Lord and
[42:48] walked away feeling relief satisfied
[42:51] that he had done what he was told to do
[42:56] sometimes it's not good to do what
[42:58] you're told to do
[43:00] in that case it was right
[43:04] so then we find out that he must have
[43:07] hurried back and brought the commission
[43:09] and I found him
[43:11] I know who he is I met him
[43:14] and I told him and I've got his promise
[43:17] that he'll be here
[43:19] you'll be here he said he would be here
[43:22] now there's something wrong with this
[43:24] scene
[43:26] there's something wrong somewhere
[43:29] those Pharisees didn't like Jesus
[43:34] they hated him
[43:36] they couldn't find his name on their
[43:39] denominational role
[43:40] they could find none of their schools of
[43:42] theology he had come through but he come
[43:45] through
[43:46] not theirs gods
[43:49] so we find out that these Pharisees
[43:51] hated him he had no cooperation with
[43:55] them
[43:56] they despised him
[43:58] and you cannot come together for
[44:00] Fellowship
[44:02] unless you've got something in common
[44:05] that's the reason we love to come to
[44:07] these meetings
[44:08] we've got something in common
[44:11] the Holy Spirit
[44:14] brotherly love
[44:16] fellowshipping one with another while
[44:18] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses all
[44:20] of our sins
[44:22] we have Fellowship we have something in
[44:24] common
[44:26] when you see uh young people with old
[44:30] people you see a little girl hanging
[44:32] around Grandma all the time
[44:34] something wrong
[44:36] too much difference in their age
[44:39] you know all the young women they're 16
[44:41] years old they like to pop their chewing
[44:44] gum and you know and things like the
[44:46] others and talk about the boy friends
[44:48] and uh and the old ladies they like to
[44:50] talk about stitching and cutting and
[44:52] sewing and cooking and so forth and the
[44:55] little kids like to to play dolls or
[44:58] Marvel's tops or want more
[45:00] but when you see a little bitty girl
[45:03] hanging around with Grandma you just
[45:05] imagine Grandma's got a sack of candy
[45:07] somewhere
[45:08] something wrong or she's Grandma's pet
[45:12] so this Pharisee must have had a is
[45:15] we've caught it on the street a trunk
[45:17] card up his sleeve
[45:19] to invite Jesus cause he hated him
[45:22] for a little Fellowship I just imagine
[45:24] he said to the other great man in his
[45:26] neighborhood you know that so-called
[45:29] prophet
[45:30] our people knows that it's telepathy
[45:34] we know that he's a fortune teller
[45:37] there's nothing to him you know all of
[45:40] them didn't die
[45:42] a lot of them still live
[45:44] we know that they we don't believe in
[45:48] our our association is done denounced it
[45:51] so you know what at this certain Feast
[45:54] that I'm going to have I'm going to see
[45:56] if I can get him down here and we'll
[45:57] prove that he's not
[46:00] we'll prove that he's not what he says
[46:03] he is
[46:04] so we'll get him down here and that to
[46:06] my opinion was the card he held in his
[46:08] sleep
[46:10] all these Pharisees there's only two
[46:12] classes of people man rich and poor
[46:15] so they they could really put on a feast
[46:18] oh my how they could do it they'd pick
[46:21] select the most suitable time of the
[46:24] year maybe when the grapes is all ripe
[46:27] around in The Vineyards I'm the night
[46:30] blooming Jasmine the orange blossoms
[46:33] that it feel the air and just made the
[46:35] valley full of the fragrance of the
[46:37] other order
[46:39] and then they would take and roast the
[46:42] lamb oh delicacy
[46:45] roast that lemon and the poor people
[46:47] smell it down into town their mouth of
[46:49] water but the smell that lamb roasting
[46:53] but you can only count by invitation
[46:56] they had their yards all fenced in and
[46:58] so forth and they'd probably get out in
[47:00] the great patio on the back and it was a
[47:03] real selected time
[47:05] for their so-called Fellowship that
[47:07] these priests and hierarchies had
[47:10] together
[47:12] and they just invited the celebrity so
[47:15] you see Jesus would be out of place
[47:17] there
[47:18] anybody filled with the spirit would be
[47:20] out of place there so they they had all
[47:23] their discussions of other things and
[47:25] that's one thing I like about a
[47:27] businessman's meeting not only a
[47:29] businessman but a for this set and talk
[47:31] about how they can uh get a little on
[47:35] this side and cut off a little from this
[47:37] one and rob peter to Faith Paul they say
[47:39] you know and such things I like it where
[47:41] you come and you talk about Jesus and
[47:44] about God about the Holy Ghost and about
[47:47] the power and the resurrection and the
[47:49] coming of the Lord that's what I like in
[47:52] the businessman
[47:53] but this fella he was a different sort
[47:56] of a character Annie had he got
[48:00] everything ready the selected it no dots
[48:03] sent word around to all the hard priests
[48:06] and the Bishops and so forth now he's
[48:08] coming down
[48:09] be here now we'll just certainly one
[48:13] time for all prove that there's nothing
[48:14] to this guy
[48:16] you all come down you've never seen him
[48:18] and uh we don't expect maybe something
[48:21] that we can catch him in
[48:23] so finally everything was put in order
[48:25] the right day come for the the feast and
[48:29] the ER that morning everything was set
[48:31] in order everything ready
[48:34] at all how they could get it ready
[48:36] everything just touched that morning
[48:38] real early all the services up with the
[48:41] towels over their arms that was going to
[48:42] serve
[48:43] the Beast had already been killed in was
[48:46] being barbecued in the front yard
[48:49] and the wines was all set in this
[48:51] special bottles and jugs and goblets is
[48:54] on the table everywhere and all the
[48:57] servants was ready to serve the crowds
[48:59] that come
[49:00] Transportation was a very odd thing they
[49:03] had three ways of transportation the
[49:06] Army come in a chariot the rich man came
[49:08] on a new the four wall
[49:11] so they had different ones out there to
[49:14] take care of the guests as they come up
[49:17] it was really set up real nice
[49:20] now let's keep our minds closed
[49:23] and as we see
[49:25] that perhaps maybe the man that was
[49:27] going to take care of the soldiers
[49:29] chariots the team they they had a place
[49:31] to take care of their uh unhook their
[49:33] horses and put them in the staple and
[49:35] give them food and the one for the rich
[49:38] to take their little donkey out and fix
[49:40] salmon and then they had another fella
[49:44] there
[49:45] he was called the footwash he was a
[49:48] flunky the lowest paid man of all the
[49:52] group of flunking footwash Lloyd's job
[49:56] of all
[49:58] and sometimes
[50:01] when we think that we're somebody
[50:05] in the highest hierarchy of Heaven
[50:07] became flesh in a foot wash punky
[50:11] when it comes to wash Marlo's feet
[50:15] when it comes to the Earth he didn't
[50:17] come to be a big somebody
[50:20] God always takes the the nobodies
[50:24] to make somebody out of them
[50:27] that's a trouble with the people today
[50:29] they're trying to be a somebody
[50:32] you want to become a nobody God takes
[50:35] something
[50:36] too to make something out of it and it
[50:38] proves that he's God
[50:41] how that this low job
[50:45] to wash the feet of the people
[50:49] and Jesus taking that job
[50:53] the Lord said there was on the earth to
[50:55] become a an example
[50:59] he didn't have to do that
[51:02] he could reach an officious mouth and
[51:04] pull out a corner or speak to the
[51:06] mountains in a poor Gold by the billions
[51:08] of tons
[51:11] you can pump water out of a well and
[51:13] turn it into the most delicious wine in
[51:16] the country he could take uh five
[51:18] biscuits and two fish and fed five
[51:20] thousand
[51:22] he didn't have to do it
[51:24] but he come for an example the way
[51:26] Pentecostal people should be
[51:30] duck the lowest job
[51:33] sure
[51:36] that's what but we try to take the
[51:37] biggest
[51:38] we can't beat Bishop Dr Pepper or
[51:42] something
[51:43] highest places biggest things the whole
[51:46] mile we're just we're full of big things
[51:51] I don't come
[51:52] when I'm invited like this the baby and
[51:55] Pet People
[51:57] I pray
[51:59] thank God that's your people
[52:03] what can I say
[52:06] I see the things creeping up then the
[52:09] Holy Spirit begins to tell me
[52:11] strike at this
[52:15] see we want something big
[52:18] God takes something little
[52:21] Elijah heard the mighty Russian wind the
[52:23] Thunders Lightnings and
[52:25] the earthquake and never bothered him
[52:29] but what attracted him was a still small
[52:32] voice
[52:34] that made the prophet put something over
[52:37] his face and walked forth to hear God
[52:41] wonder if we Pentecostal people
[52:45] hasn't relied too much on rushing wind
[52:50] a lot of noise
[52:54] instead of remembering or hearing that
[52:56] still Small Voice we hear so much Rumble
[52:58] we can't take time to hear the still
[53:00] small boy
[53:02] praise the Lord
[53:04] you know the wagon goes out in the field
[53:08] runs over humps and bumpity bumpity
[53:11] bumpity making all kinds of noise
[53:13] squeaking and squawking and jumping but
[53:16] coming back it's loaded down with good
[53:18] things it passes the same bumps and
[53:20] don't make a move
[53:23] we all have
[53:27] all of it as long as there's malice
[53:29] Among Us
[53:31] as long as there's differences among us
[53:33] we're not yet loaded
[53:38] take a weed lightheaded
[53:42] a wheat comes up
[53:46] holds itself up in the air
[53:49] shakes by the wind
[53:51] sticks his head straight up
[53:53] but when it becomes full-headed
[53:56] it down
[53:59] I think that's what's the matter with
[54:01] all of us today the churches
[54:03] we don't associate ourselves enough and
[54:06] real humility not a false but something
[54:10] that you stay there until Something's
[54:12] Happened to you
[54:15] humility
[54:18] too much wind and
[54:20] Thunder
[54:22] not enough
[54:23] still small voices
[54:26] I think that is true
[54:30] we look and see that it's true because
[54:32] the fruit that it bears
[54:35] Upon Our People
[54:39] somehow it isn't just like it used to be
[54:43] back to your story we'll get that Sunday
[54:45] notice
[54:47] we find these Pharisees this Pharisee
[54:52] making everything ready
[54:53] for his big uh blow out as we'd call it
[54:57] big spread that he's going to put on
[55:02] ah look
[55:04] at the
[55:06] the man out there ready to take the
[55:08] soldiers chariots and the one taking the
[55:11] rich man's donkey and in Palestine they
[55:14] wear a garment on the outside which is a
[55:17] robe
[55:18] on the inside they were underneath
[55:20] garment that comes to the knees
[55:23] and as they travel in those days they
[55:26] walked up over the mountains and and
[55:28] across making shortcuts
[55:30] and when they did the the Walkers and
[55:33] the one who had beasts
[55:35] a burden they walked the same path
[55:39] and the Beast along the road where
[55:41] they've walked and and then laying upon
[55:45] the ground uh
[55:47] the dust begin to
[55:50] accumulate
[55:51] and where the Beast that cross the land
[55:54] there was a smell in the dust
[55:57] and as the people walk and this big
[56:00] garment swinging loose caused a wind
[56:03] and it picked up the dust and it got on
[56:06] their limbs
[56:08] on their face
[56:10] and they
[56:12] wasn't presentable to uh entertain
[56:17] uh if they were smelling like that
[56:20] so they had a foot wash flunking that
[56:24] would meet the guest at the door and
[56:26] when anyone come up with their card of
[56:28] invitation he had a whole rack
[56:32] um what we would call something like
[56:34] bedroom shoes made out of textile or or
[56:37] some kind of a good and the sandals of
[56:40] those days were sometimes a piece of
[56:42] wood like we have they're called the
[56:43] Roman sandal with a piece of leather
[56:45] that the toll went between the foot was
[56:48] exposed then to the to the Dust
[56:51] and as they tread along they'd come to
[56:54] this place give their honor their ticket
[56:57] and they would reach down take off these
[56:59] sandals and set them up in a place with
[57:02] their name and leech up on The Mantel
[57:04] and get a another pair of soft sandals
[57:08] and put on their feet which they were
[57:09] ready then to go in all their rugs are
[57:13] sometime were real thick and great
[57:15] tapestries they were had a beautiful
[57:16] play in their homes those people were
[57:19] rich
[57:21] and then the next thing this person did
[57:24] he was washed his feet
[57:28] then the next thing happened he went to
[57:30] the next guest and he was standing with
[57:32] a towel over his arm
[57:34] with a little Cruise in his hand then he
[57:36] he would pour oil
[57:38] in his hand let him rub it behind his
[57:41] ears and on his neck because his face
[57:43] was burning he was dirty and he'd take
[57:46] this towel and wipe his face off good
[57:48] and he was all right
[57:52] the smell was off of him and he was
[57:54] anointed with perfume and that was
[57:56] costly very costly
[57:59] they get it they tell me from way up in
[58:02] the mountains where they get these
[58:04] little apples after the rose has gone in
[58:06] the little apples and it's a very costly
[58:08] thing like the Queen of Sheba brought up
[58:10] to Solomon spices and stickered and so
[58:12] forth and they made this perfume out of
[58:15] it and they relaxed themselves by they
[58:18] were feet was washed the smell was off
[58:20] of them that burning blistering Sun up
[58:22] on their face then they refresh then the
[58:25] next thing the first step second step
[58:27] now the third step now I could preach on
[58:30] that a while but uh I haven't got the
[58:32] time how this justification
[58:34] sanctification the baptism the Holy
[58:36] Ghost then when they went in they met
[58:39] the guests met there was met by the The
[58:43] Host
[58:45] then something like this
[58:47] stand up for the demon
[58:49] after you see washed
[58:52] perfumed
[58:54] he did he wasn't embarrassed of the
[58:56] smell
[58:57] you know soft shoes to walk on the big
[59:00] Persian rugs he was anointed he had a
[59:03] good smell on him not the stink of the
[59:05] animals
[59:07] but he was perfume then they reached
[59:09] like this come right here brother Jesus
[59:11] I've been in the ordering and I take
[59:13] this hand like this then they come this
[59:15] way together
[59:17] then they patted one another
[59:20] when the host met the gas
[59:23] then that was called the welcoming
[59:27] see it didn't wash perfumed
[59:31] and was kissed welcome they kissed on
[59:35] the neck
[59:36] he was kissed welcome that he was a
[59:39] full-fledged brother
[59:41] that's the way it is in the church when
[59:44] we're washed
[59:46] foreign
[59:49] [Music]
[59:57] then we're welcome yes
[1:00:00] all this so much to be said there
[1:00:04] but to keep you not too long
[1:00:07] I don't want to Tire you
[1:00:10] but when then kiss welcomed me if he's
[1:00:12] at home
[1:00:13] he didn't have to worry about nothing
[1:00:15] he'd go over
[1:00:17] it's a refrigerator get a big sandwich
[1:00:20] and kick off his shoes lay down on the
[1:00:22] bed anything you want to do he was at
[1:00:24] home
[1:00:26] and when God kisses us welcome
[1:00:29] into his kingdom we're home
[1:00:32] it's all right it's all over them we've
[1:00:35] been washed by the preparation that he
[1:00:37] prepared for us his blood
[1:00:39] a sweet smelling savior perfume by the
[1:00:42] sanctification that drives the stink of
[1:00:45] the world
[1:00:47] Hallelujah I feel kind of religious
[1:00:50] right now
[1:00:52] taking away the stink of the wild are
[1:00:55] the desires of the world
[1:00:59] see if the world's still in the Sin
[1:01:00] there's something wrong no wonder we
[1:01:03] can't have a real private class for
[1:01:05] Revival
[1:01:07] oh why are there something missing
[1:01:10] the guest hasn't exactly entered right
[1:01:15] you see Jesus taught that one time about
[1:01:17] the robes and he said this man was down
[1:01:19] there not prepared and he was bound and
[1:01:21] casting out of Darkness
[1:01:25] so much could be said on him
[1:01:27] but that's the way they did it and they
[1:01:30] were home they felt like they were a
[1:01:31] brother you can't feel like your brother
[1:01:33] when you still desire the world
[1:01:37] you can't associate yourself out you're
[1:01:40] in things of the world of cheating lying
[1:01:42] stealing
[1:01:44] you women bobbing off your hair and
[1:01:45] wearing shorts and everything then still
[1:01:47] feel at home when the word of God's been
[1:01:49] preached
[1:01:52] you're supposed to be Pentecostals
[1:01:56] supposed to be filled with the Holy
[1:01:58] Ghost
[1:01:59] someone hit at me not long ago said
[1:02:01] won't you leave them people alone
[1:02:03] said people think you're a prophet I
[1:02:05] said I'm no prophet
[1:02:07] say well they think you are why don't
[1:02:10] you teach them people them Pentecostals
[1:02:12] how to receive these things
[1:02:15] how to get great spiritual blessings and
[1:02:17] Eatery into the presence of God and see
[1:02:19] Visions also
[1:02:21] if you leave them alone I said how can I
[1:02:24] teach them algebra when they won't even
[1:02:25] learn their ABCs
[1:02:30] how can they accept spiritual things
[1:02:33] when they won't even have the common
[1:02:35] decency between themselves up
[1:02:44] not to hurt you
[1:02:46] but to be honest with you
[1:02:49] on honorable things
[1:02:51] that the Bible says that you shouldn't
[1:02:53] do
[1:02:54] yeah we associate with it sure see you
[1:02:58] can't be welcome no sir
[1:03:00] you're out of place
[1:03:02] with the word and he is the word
[1:03:06] now so much for that we'll get that some
[1:03:09] other time but notice on as we go
[1:03:13] say what's America well you man that'll
[1:03:16] let him do it that shows what you're
[1:03:17] made out of
[1:03:19] some of you women pastors wives act like
[1:03:22] that and dress like that what is it your
[1:03:26] time your husband lets you do it
[1:03:29] oh brother
[1:03:33] what is it some of these water head
[1:03:36] haircuts you have
[1:03:37] kind of act like the first lady of the
[1:03:39] land Jazzy Bell was the first lady of
[1:03:41] the land too
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:48] some of their pastors wouldn't tell them
[1:03:50] about it but they had Elijah down there
[1:03:52] stood out on it all right
[1:03:55] that was her pastor she didn't want to
[1:03:57] believe it
[1:03:58] lettering
[1:04:01] notice
[1:04:03] we find out
[1:04:05] that they had to be ready and prepared
[1:04:07] to go in
[1:04:10] how did it happen
[1:04:13] we see him now
[1:04:16] sitting in the room
[1:04:19] unwashed
[1:04:20] unanointed
[1:04:22] not just welcome
[1:04:24] sitting in the Cardinal's house
[1:04:28] I want to ask you something
[1:04:30] what happened to that football slumpty
[1:04:35] where was he at
[1:04:37] how did he bow face it
[1:04:41] what an opportunity
[1:04:46] and missed it
[1:04:47] oh I believe if I'd been there and
[1:04:49] noticed coming I've been on a step
[1:04:51] ladder somewhere watching for him to
[1:04:52] come
[1:04:54] the honor of washing his feet
[1:04:59] the honor
[1:05:01] but somehow he just bypassed him let him
[1:05:03] go
[1:05:04] or was the man within awning oil
[1:05:07] but somehow he was there and was dirty
[1:05:13] kills me to say it
[1:05:16] say it but Jesus with dirty feet
[1:05:19] you know the Frenchman calls him Jesus
[1:05:23] Jesus
[1:05:25] Jesus
[1:05:28] nobody caring to up enough about it to
[1:05:31] wash his feet
[1:05:34] what's that got to do with us brother
[1:05:35] Brandon he come and he was on time
[1:05:39] he's always on time
[1:05:42] never late
[1:05:44] we call for our Revival
[1:05:46] and he comes
[1:05:48] somebody starts to praise the Lord are
[1:05:50] we
[1:05:51] just put out of the church
[1:05:54] he's never welcomed
[1:05:58] Jesus
[1:06:00] with dirty feet
[1:06:02] oh why did he get dirty he got dirty
[1:06:05] coming because he was called to come
[1:06:09] and today
[1:06:11] is also when he comes he's called Holy
[1:06:14] Roller
[1:06:15] some Scandal name
[1:06:19] why did he take that sort of a thing
[1:06:21] because we invited him to come and God
[1:06:24] came down in the form of human flesh
[1:06:30] he lives here on Earth he became that
[1:06:33] soul that we invited God to come and
[1:06:36] then when he come they don't want him
[1:06:39] they didn't want him many times we don't
[1:06:42] want him it interferes with our
[1:06:43] denominational
[1:06:45] setup
[1:06:47] that interferes with the social standing
[1:06:50] we have with the other churches God have
[1:06:52] mercy on WE poor miserable Pharisees
[1:06:57] what we need is the power of the Holy
[1:07:00] Ghost
[1:07:01] out of the buildings and back into the
[1:07:03] people that could have the old-fashioned
[1:07:05] Pentecostal power that cleaned the
[1:07:08] church from the janitor to the pastor
[1:07:14] holy man
[1:07:16] that's what we need but we pray for it
[1:07:19] and when it comes oh
[1:07:21] no that interferes with my social
[1:07:23] standing
[1:07:25] oh sure cuts down some of the dignity
[1:07:31] if you don't have it just so and so the
[1:07:32] people won't come
[1:07:34] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:07:36] my father droughty
[1:07:38] notice again all that the father give me
[1:07:41] will come
[1:07:43] keep the grain clean
[1:07:45] we can't never compare with the world
[1:07:50] we're doing wrong but trying to act like
[1:07:52] the world
[1:07:57] we never can compare with them
[1:07:59] and we've got no business out on their
[1:08:01] grounds
[1:08:02] bring them over on our grounds
[1:08:06] we got something they haven't got
[1:08:10] it we go to act like them then they know
[1:08:12] we we're seeing something we haven't got
[1:08:16] let the let the world come to us not us
[1:08:19] Squad ain't the world
[1:08:21] let the world you know Hollywood shines
[1:08:24] but the gospel glows there's a lot of
[1:08:27] difference between shining and glowing
[1:08:28] him
[1:08:31] glow
[1:08:32] not shy with the outward appearance glow
[1:08:36] me inside by the Holy Ghost
[1:08:38] with sweetness meekness gentleness
[1:08:40] patience and love
[1:08:43] go don't shine
[1:08:46] science after the world
[1:08:48] the church is whole like it was in the
[1:08:50] days of Esther Esther didn't take the
[1:08:53] perfume in the of the women she adorned
[1:08:56] himself with a modest a pair of the
[1:08:57] hidden men of the heart and the King
[1:08:59] said put the crown on her head
[1:09:01] Esther was a type of the church today
[1:09:04] those who are ready to come out
[1:09:07] and Adorn themselves
[1:09:09] with the sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:11] not the perfume in the dressing of the
[1:09:13] world try to compare with them but that
[1:09:16] hidden man of the heart
[1:09:18] that's the one
[1:09:20] notice we find Jesus
[1:09:24] sitting out there with dirty feet
[1:09:28] they have never been noticed
[1:09:30] how did he get in how did he miss how
[1:09:34] did the football splunky missing how the
[1:09:37] rest of them miss him I don't know but
[1:09:39] he was sitting there with dirty feet
[1:09:44] nobody's doing anything about it oh
[1:09:46] Pharisee in the other the bishop the
[1:09:48] Archbishop and the Cardinal and all the
[1:09:50] rest of us over there tipping their
[1:09:52] goblets together and drinking the the
[1:09:54] Fine Wines and and talking about the
[1:09:57] things of the
[1:09:58] of Israel
[1:10:00] but fail to see the god of Israel
[1:10:03] that's today we want the biggest
[1:10:06] building in the town or and all the
[1:10:08] people like to flock to the biggest
[1:10:09] building there is in the city all these
[1:10:11] big the best dressed and all this other
[1:10:13] some poor little man preach the gospel
[1:10:15] down here on the street calling or out
[1:10:17] there somewhere in the alley in a little
[1:10:19] church and you don't want to associate
[1:10:21] with him
[1:10:23] what's the matter there's something
[1:10:24] wrong
[1:10:28] well if there were the rest of the
[1:10:30] people act like this and dress the best
[1:10:33] too bad it's sitting in our rooms
[1:10:35] right what we need is a humbling what we
[1:10:39] need is a re-baptism of the holy spirit
[1:10:42] with God's love and power to take this
[1:10:45] world out of us
[1:10:49] bring us back to adorning again to the
[1:10:51] word Washed by the Water of the word
[1:10:56] get back to Christ
[1:10:59] instead of fashion ourselves of the
[1:11:01] world trying to act like the first lady
[1:11:03] and and all these other things some of
[1:11:06] the Bishops and so forth no matter about
[1:11:08] that you want to be like Jesus
[1:11:11] Jesus
[1:11:14] not think of it
[1:11:16] everybody's standing around the fence as
[1:11:19] the feast got on the fragments of the
[1:11:21] lamb and everything there wasn't nobody
[1:11:24] on the street everybody was standing
[1:11:26] looking in their mouth watering grasping
[1:11:29] for a bite of the Lamb they couldn't
[1:11:31] come in no
[1:11:33] they were the poor the trash
[1:11:36] outside and here was one on the inside
[1:11:38] dressed and looked like them on the
[1:11:40] outside
[1:11:41] something wrong somewhere
[1:11:43] sitting there not only the decency to
[1:11:45] wash his feeder or kiss him welcome just
[1:11:48] let him sit there
[1:11:49] nobody around him
[1:11:52] his disciples couldn't come they wasn't
[1:11:54] invited
[1:11:55] but here he's sitting here
[1:11:56] looking around
[1:11:59] now listen
[1:12:00] weighed down the street
[1:12:04] to the lowest part of the city
[1:12:07] down in the red light district
[1:12:10] we turn right grew up an alley
[1:12:13] there's a little creaking steps coming
[1:12:16] down the back
[1:12:17] and as you climb it she squeaks and
[1:12:20] squeaks
[1:12:21] open the door and
[1:12:23] we find in there a little woman
[1:12:27] I don't believe she meant to be bad
[1:12:30] maybe she had a good parent
[1:12:34] and she just took the road that's wrong
[1:12:38] or maybe she was a good girl
[1:12:42] some slick-haired curly-headed Judas
[1:12:49] ruin the little lady's reputation
[1:12:53] I'm always hit it to women and we'll
[1:12:55] take up for you wow
[1:12:58] amen there's a menu good girl gone wrong
[1:13:01] because of some little perfume Judas
[1:13:04] run along with his hair slicked down and
[1:13:06] hold his mouth open in front
[1:13:09] going on with some little something of
[1:13:11] the
[1:13:11] one of these here Ricky or Elvis's
[1:13:13] machines out here on the street take
[1:13:15] some little girl out cause she thinks
[1:13:17] he's cute
[1:13:18] give her a cigarette get her on the
[1:13:21] Dance Floor
[1:13:23] I met thousands of them their poor
[1:13:26] little lives wrecked in the rooms
[1:13:29] they always their fault
[1:13:32] don't ever fall for a boy like that
[1:13:34] sister
[1:13:35] let him alone and nothing to him
[1:13:38] if he ain't filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:45] I'm going to say something I don't mean
[1:13:46] it for joke cause it's no place for
[1:13:47] jokes
[1:13:49] man but if something happened to my
[1:13:51] church
[1:13:53] this is a place of the Gospel we had a
[1:13:55] girl at our church here some time ago
[1:13:58] nice pretty little girl
[1:14:01] first thing you know she cut her hair
[1:14:04] that's against the rule
[1:14:06] sir
[1:14:09] when she does that the Bible says she's
[1:14:10] a dishonorable woman get away from her
[1:14:13] the Bible said a woman cuts her hairs
[1:14:14] dishonorable
[1:14:17] now that's the word
[1:14:21] God knows that's right if the Holy Ghost
[1:14:24] is in you and won't cooperate with that
[1:14:25] what kind of Holy Ghost is that
[1:14:31] the Holy Spirit itself in you makes you
[1:14:33] live what you are
[1:14:35] if the Holy Spirit disagrees with the
[1:14:37] word that you call it the Holy Spirit
[1:14:39] then it's not the holy spirit of God
[1:14:40] you've got some sort of a spirit
[1:14:43] today we have all kinds of spirits
[1:14:45] people say shut your eyes open up your
[1:14:47] mouth receive something you do
[1:14:50] but look what you got after you receive
[1:14:52] it
[1:14:52] don't you
[1:14:58] do holding on to the word
[1:15:01] get the spirit of God will make you walk
[1:15:03] right in line with God
[1:15:05] sure
[1:15:07] this little girl
[1:15:09] she got to run around some little
[1:15:11] Elvis
[1:15:14] I try I asked her
[1:15:17] I said
[1:15:19] Martha
[1:15:21] do that
[1:15:22] what are you seeing that guy smokes I
[1:15:25] seems down all Church ground smoking
[1:15:28] oh she says uh brother randomly said you
[1:15:32] know
[1:15:33] said he's got pretty curly hair
[1:15:35] and said you just smell so good
[1:15:39] now if that ain't something to pick a
[1:15:40] boyfriend
[1:15:42] I said but he isn't saved I said I'd
[1:15:45] rather go with a boy that smelled like a
[1:15:47] Stockyard head feet like a boxcar and
[1:15:50] have the Holy Ghost yes I would
[1:15:54] I'm one of those little things she
[1:15:56] finally ended up on the wrong road like
[1:15:58] maybe this poor girl did
[1:16:01] some boy letter wrong
[1:16:04] then she started if you've already
[1:16:06] started since there's hopes if you just
[1:16:08] meet this man I'm talking about
[1:16:11] maybe she hadn't had the opportunity
[1:16:13] so she starts down the street on her
[1:16:16] regular routine
[1:16:18] and she sees nobody where's everybody at
[1:16:22] and she passes another Corner in another
[1:16:25] corner where is everybody there's nobody
[1:16:27] today
[1:16:28] after all she smells that Aroma poor
[1:16:31] little empty stomach begins to hunger
[1:16:35] she moves up amongst the crowd up around
[1:16:38] Pharisees door and she sees the bishop
[1:16:40] the Cardinals and all of them in there
[1:16:42] tipping the Goblet and she presses
[1:16:44] herself up to the fence and people can
[1:16:46] get away from her
[1:16:49] I'm worse than she is
[1:16:51] right shall stop
[1:16:55] don't realize that every woman went
[1:16:56] wrong I had some reason to
[1:16:59] every man that went wrong and we think
[1:17:01] we're so self-styled many times
[1:17:03] we don't want to associate with the bums
[1:17:05] on the street
[1:17:06] we ain't got time to stop and talk to
[1:17:09] them a minute and then call ourselves
[1:17:10] Christians
[1:17:13] yes
[1:17:15] she passed your way up to the fence and
[1:17:17] she was looking around through there she
[1:17:19] was hungry and she looked and she's
[1:17:22] watching over here in the corner stood
[1:17:24] Pharisees she could hear that great big
[1:17:25] ho ho ho over the corner looked over
[1:17:27] here he was tipping the goblets of that
[1:17:29] fine fancy wine and the lamb being
[1:17:32] roasted and did her almost ready to be
[1:17:34] served and and looking around like that
[1:17:36] and after a while her eyes caught
[1:17:39] somebody
[1:17:40] oh may we all catch that picture now
[1:17:45] setting over in the corner unnoticed
[1:17:50] and she must have caught his eye
[1:17:53] nobody can ever look him in ah I never
[1:17:56] feel the same again
[1:17:59] she saw him
[1:18:02] he's taught who is that
[1:18:04] there's something different about him
[1:18:07] and there is
[1:18:09] there never was nobody like him
[1:18:12] there can never be nobody lagging he was
[1:18:16] different from others
[1:18:17] there he was sitting she looked down at
[1:18:20] the people's
[1:18:21] turn away from me
[1:18:24] and she noticed his feet was unwashed
[1:18:28] his face is still parched and burning if
[1:18:31] we could only see that today
[1:18:33] you know what I'm talking about
[1:18:37] seems setting in disgrace
[1:18:41] like his people to us today to the world
[1:18:45] they don't want no association with them
[1:18:46] here same as you say Pentecost brother
[1:18:48] they're gone
[1:18:49] you say holy ghost
[1:18:51] they're away from it
[1:18:54] what weed people need to do
[1:18:56] is to wash his feet
[1:18:59] anointing
[1:19:01] that we might rise in the power of his
[1:19:04] resurrection
[1:19:05] take that disgrace off of you amen make
[1:19:08] the world ashamed of themselves
[1:19:11] with the power of His Life in US that's
[1:19:14] different creatures not like them out
[1:19:16] there that's cannon fodder
[1:19:19] that's not about Atomic ashes
[1:19:21] church is a born-again creature
[1:19:24] here he was sitting and that kind of the
[1:19:26] crowd that's the way he looks and that's
[1:19:28] where a genuine Spirit-filled man or
[1:19:30] woman looks on the side of such a crowd
[1:19:32] notice she looked at him
[1:19:35] she thought
[1:19:36] you know who that is
[1:19:38] somebody here is that that prophet of
[1:19:41] Galilee all that's him
[1:19:44] oh her heart began to pound something
[1:19:47] when he finds Jesus your heart goes to
[1:19:49] acting funny
[1:19:50] let's go get a new master right away
[1:19:53] heart went to pounding oh that's the one
[1:19:55] the one that was down there at the well
[1:19:57] or that woman of sakar was
[1:20:01] that's the one that found the woman is
[1:20:03] in Marla's eye
[1:20:05] and told her that she had too many
[1:20:07] husbands
[1:20:09] and forgave her her sins
[1:20:12] oh you'd never forgive me
[1:20:14] I'm too wretched
[1:20:16] but it's not right that him setting her
[1:20:19] like that
[1:20:21] he's a god of Eternity
[1:20:24] he's the only savior it's not right for
[1:20:27] him to be treated like that
[1:20:29] she got an idea I hope you get one
[1:20:34] down the street she goes just as hard as
[1:20:36] she can
[1:20:37] down to the little alley up the alley to
[1:20:40] the little creaking steps crickety
[1:20:42] crickety up she goes pulling a little
[1:20:44] squeaking door open actually takes the
[1:20:46] lock off goes in falls down on the floor
[1:20:49] she thinks I'm on Monday
[1:20:52] she reaches under the bed pulls out a
[1:20:54] little box and unlocks it and a little
[1:20:57] piece of her stocking perhaps she takes
[1:20:59] it out

[1:23:36] she goes down the street she said well

[1:23:41] in me telling me to do it that's when
[1:23:43] it's real not when you're putting it on
[1:23:46] but something real
[1:23:47] here she goes down the street
[1:23:50] and she looks around and she remember
[1:23:51] lubinski has the best perfume shop in
[1:23:54] the city
[1:23:55] so she enters the door the little bell
[1:23:57] rings and one raise up look see it was
[1:24:00] matter what do you want

[1:24:04] become Christian businessmen that's poor
[1:24:06] business

[1:24:18] the best you got oh my
[1:24:22] the best I got yep
[1:24:25] it's for uh
[1:24:26] it's for a real certain person
[1:24:29] it's for our special occasion
[1:24:32] that's why we want the best that can be
[1:24:34] gone
[1:24:36] the best we can give
[1:24:38] not just three minutes a day in prayer
[1:24:40] but the best you can give
[1:24:42] oh I want the best you got well he knew
[1:24:46] a woman like that really didn't have
[1:24:47] money enough to buy that so she takes
[1:24:49] her little stocking top and said how
[1:24:52] much is the best
[1:24:53] 20 pieces
[1:24:55] that's the best I got she pours her
[1:24:57] little stocking top out there and the
[1:25:00] money rattles oh of course that's
[1:25:02] different he who said there's no prophet
[1:25:04] in keeping Joseph
[1:25:06] he's ready to make it you know so he
[1:25:09] gots up there and counts it out oh yes
[1:25:11] exactly 20 pieces of Roman denaria
[1:25:13] that's what it calls what are you going
[1:25:15] to do with this oh this is for a special
[1:25:18] person
[1:25:19] so he reached up on the shelf and gives
[1:25:21] her the alabaster box
[1:25:23] puts in her bosom she slips back up
[1:25:25] again
[1:25:27] she looks in there she sees Pharisee in
[1:25:30] them all standing around in such a great
[1:25:32] uh collaboration of a Pomp and she sees
[1:25:37] Jesus still sitting there with dirty
[1:25:39] feet nobody had paid any attention to
[1:25:41] him how am I going to get in
[1:25:44] they'll throw me out I want to start in
[1:25:46] the gate
[1:25:47] but you know there's something inside of
[1:25:49] her
[1:25:50] tell her to go in
[1:25:52] she wanted to do a service for Jesus and
[1:25:55] if you're wanting to do a service for
[1:25:57] Jesus to raise enough Bishops and
[1:25:58] Cardinals on Earth to stop you from
[1:26:00] getting me
[1:26:01] that's right you know enough
[1:26:03] denominations and hypocrites in the
[1:26:06] country to do it I have Devils of the
[1:26:09] hell to stop you from it
[1:26:11] if you are wanting to do a service for
[1:26:13] Jesu
[1:26:16] here she comes she steps around she sees
[1:26:18] the guard at the gate turned his back
[1:26:20] she sneaks under the gate here she makes
[1:26:22] her way real quick that's right when you
[1:26:23] first get in go right to him don't mess
[1:26:25] around
[1:26:27] don't go talk and see what this one says
[1:26:28] and what this organization says and that
[1:26:30] says go right straight to Jesus
[1:26:37] say get to him right quick
[1:26:39] so she slips up real quick she stands
[1:26:42] the Bible says behind him she got to
[1:26:44] thinking oh
[1:26:45] oh
[1:26:47] I'm in the presence of
[1:26:49] God
[1:26:51] a strange feeling always comes over you
[1:26:53] when you come in that attitude
[1:26:56] but if you come into attitude at
[1:26:58] Pharisee had you'll have the same
[1:27:00] feeling he had nothing to it
[1:27:02] or just come in that attitude you want
[1:27:04] to see Jesus
[1:27:06] see what kind of feeling comes over you
[1:27:08] let that old heart melt within you this
[1:27:10] morning towards you
[1:27:12] listen to his still smaller voice it'll
[1:27:15] be a different attitude
[1:27:16] slips up
[1:27:18] he was sitting there she thought oh oh
[1:27:21] I'm so nervous I don't know what to do
[1:27:23] if I get around maybe he might run me
[1:27:26] out of here oh what well I'm not I'm
[1:27:28] nothing anyhow
[1:27:30] now you get to thinking that you're
[1:27:31] nothing anyhow if you're afraid you're
[1:27:33] going to ruin your friends he said you
[1:27:34] better stay away in a person
[1:27:37] nothing to begin with
[1:27:40] so she run around in front of me and she
[1:27:42] looked then she was closed
[1:27:45] that's what you want to get just a
[1:27:46] little closer to look at it maybe you're
[1:27:48] looking too far away you're looking at
[1:27:50] him way back down there two thousand
[1:27:52] years ago was What about him this
[1:27:54] morning
[1:27:55] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:27:57] forever
[1:27:58] same power same signs the works that I
[1:28:01] do should you also
[1:28:02] brother Demus a while ago coordinate in
[1:28:04] King James greater than this shall you
[1:28:06] do but the right translation that anyone
[1:28:08] knows is more than this shall you do not
[1:28:10] greater no one can do any greater but
[1:28:12] more of the same great works he raised
[1:28:15] the dead and stopped nature nothing else
[1:28:17] could be done any greater
[1:28:18] but more why
[1:28:20] he's in his church Universal the great
[1:28:23] holy Apostolic Pentecostal Catholic
[1:28:25] Church
[1:28:26] around the world jizu and every member
[1:28:30] he's only one man God was there now
[1:28:33] God's in his whole church
[1:28:35] right this hour of people's being healed
[1:28:37] write this very minute people's
[1:28:39] receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:28:42] if he was just standing here alone in a
[1:28:45] man for him as he was then he could only
[1:28:46] be talking this audience but now he
[1:28:48] talks the world over
[1:28:50] and the Holy Ghost
[1:28:52] so there she was in his presence she
[1:28:54] moved around I can see those little eyes
[1:28:56] look up at her
[1:28:58] and her heart nearly failed
[1:29:00] there's the men that forgive that woman
[1:29:02] and load her heart
[1:29:05] he knew that woman of Samaria
[1:29:08] soccer we he knew she had five husbands
[1:29:11] and he knows how guilty I am he does he
[1:29:15] knows how guilty you are
[1:29:16] he knows just how low down every one of
[1:29:19] us are
[1:29:20] he knows us
[1:29:23] she looked him in the face and she
[1:29:24] recognized it now she never looked over
[1:29:26] Pharisee or looked at the chart and see
[1:29:28] how many members belonged to the church
[1:29:30] where she'd join it or not she looked at
[1:29:33] Jesus
[1:29:34] she felt guilty
[1:29:36] and she couldn't hold her tears in his
[1:29:38] hunger
[1:29:39] she looked down at his feet and the
[1:29:42] tears are going to drop off on his feet
[1:29:43] she was so ashamed she fell down on her
[1:29:46] knees she used to see her and she
[1:29:48] couldn't hold her tears any longer or
[1:29:50] something about when you get around
[1:29:51] Jesus you start crying
[1:29:54] not with a cold I ain't got no use for
[1:29:56] these cold starchy confessions and put
[1:29:59] your name on the book and giant in the
[1:30:01] church
[1:30:03] You Gotta Die to yourself
[1:30:06] be born to new
[1:30:08] and the tears begin to drop off on Jesus
[1:30:11] feet and she didn't have nothing to wipe
[1:30:13] them with so hanging her head there I'm
[1:30:15] crying her pretty curls and she had all
[1:30:18] done up on top of her head you know what
[1:30:20] I just fell down
[1:30:24] she began to wash his feet with her
[1:30:27] hands in
[1:30:32] and wipe with her her hair some of our
[1:30:35] Pentecostal sisters Bob know their
[1:30:37] pretty hair off has stand on their head
[1:30:38] to get enough hair to wash his feet
[1:30:43] right
[1:30:46] but he she even in her condition don't
[1:30:50] condemn her
[1:30:54] she took her hair began to wipe his feet
[1:30:57] she'd look up
[1:30:59] oh if you'd have moved the foot
[1:31:02] if she if he would have bad at us should
[1:31:04] have gone out of there but Jesus when
[1:31:07] you're trying to do something for him he
[1:31:08] just lets you do it
[1:31:10] I love that
[1:31:13] set still and looked at her
[1:31:17] and she's trying to say
[1:31:23] wiping his feet
[1:31:26] I want a beautiful water
[1:31:29] towards his feet tears of repentance
[1:31:33] better than he could have gotten from
[1:31:35] old Pharisee
[1:31:36] old self-made denominational Waters
[1:31:40] he had Waters of repentance
[1:31:42] her great big Brony tears tracking his
[1:31:45] feet her with her pretty
[1:31:48] hair just washed why haven't he said uh
[1:31:53] I can't say it Jesus
[1:31:57] wiping his feet
[1:31:59] it got so weird
[1:32:03] I can't see it
[1:32:05] my
[1:32:07] Jesu just watched her
[1:32:10] after a while
[1:32:12] she took the alabaster box out
[1:32:14] she was ashamed to stand up to put it on
[1:32:16] his hand
[1:32:17] sure she thought if I can just sit at
[1:32:19] his feet that'll be good
[1:32:22] some of you want to be the big shot
[1:32:26] but not for me
[1:32:30] his word is sufficient
[1:32:33] as long as I know that I'm in him and
[1:32:36] his word me
[1:32:38] that's good enough
[1:32:40] not get over there if I can just pop my
[1:32:42] hands on his feet that's enough
[1:32:45] that'll be all right that's all I ask
[1:32:48] I think that's the way we call it being
[1:32:52] washing his feet tears of water of
[1:32:55] repentance that's what he wants his his
[1:32:58] dirt washed off with
[1:33:01] pittance not pins repentance
[1:33:06] washing his feet whitening with her hair
[1:33:08] directly she reached them nervously she
[1:33:10] got the alabaster box and she didn't she
[1:33:13] was so nervous and she broke the end of
[1:33:15] it poured it all up on his feet his she
[1:33:18] was real nervous and and then she
[1:33:20] reached back again her wife is speaking
[1:33:24] I I wanna
[1:33:25] she looked up
[1:33:27] she noticed his eyes is off over there
[1:33:30] what's going on all the time in the room
[1:33:32] there's not a move made what's the
[1:33:34] matter
[1:33:35] everything stopped
[1:33:38] oh I can see that felt self-style
[1:33:42] Pharisee the meanest Rascal in the
[1:33:45] country
[1:33:46] always red in the face
[1:33:49] he's so humiliated
[1:33:52] somebody said amen
[1:33:57] why somebody say Amen in his church
[1:34:00] you're disturbing
[1:34:04] a little power of God he has to say a
[1:34:06] word he made mistake somewhere and said
[1:34:09] Jesus Christ come to say Sinners
[1:34:10] somebody say glory to God oh
[1:34:16] ushers put him out
[1:34:20] yeah
[1:34:23] they disturb me

[1:34:29] so there he was so humiliated oh come
[1:34:32] down to oh he was just
[1:34:36] I have to quit
[1:34:38] he was so humiliated
[1:34:42] he's looking at him and he said within
[1:34:44] himself
[1:34:47] nod and them Cardinals
[1:34:50] you see

[1:34:53] if that man was a problem
[1:34:56] he would know what kind of a woman that
[1:34:58] well sure he did
[1:35:00] she has a million times better off than
[1:35:02] him

[1:35:07] she was a prostitute
[1:35:09] shame on you miserable poor church
[1:35:12] members that knows more about God than

[1:35:20] was a prophet
[1:35:22] he was the prophet he didn't know that
[1:35:24] he's no prophet but Jesus could discern
[1:35:27] his thoughts
[1:35:32] so he raised himself up the little woman
[1:35:35] stood
[1:35:36] her hair hanging down her
[1:35:39] over her shoulders
[1:35:41] down about her waistline

[1:38:11] you want a child the same
[1:38:13] and the verdict at the end will be the
[1:38:15] same thing thy sins which are many
[1:38:17] are all forgiven me
[1:38:20] let's bow our heads Justin
[1:38:34] you enjoy that
[1:38:36] hey man you can go listen to the rest
[1:38:39] make your own altar call
[1:38:42] in your heart
[1:38:43] but I think it's so important that we
[1:38:47] recognized here that
[1:38:50] there's an attitude that's presented
[1:38:53] what it means to be humble
[1:38:55] what it means to serve other people
[1:38:58] what it means to be little and what it
[1:39:01] means to recognize that everything that
[1:39:04] you have comes from him
[1:39:06] and and and to serve them
[1:39:09] and to have that heart
[1:39:12] and not to get carried away with the
[1:39:16] things that are unimportant
[1:39:18] but you know
[1:39:21] what struck me so much is when he says
[1:39:24] when we get there
[1:39:26] our reward is your sins which are many
[1:39:30] are forgiven
[1:39:32] we think we're going to get some great
[1:39:34] big thing but just to be forgiven
[1:39:36] is good enough for me
[1:39:39] so Lord bless you and I thought that was
[1:39:42] needful
[1:39:43] I thought it's the word there's a lot in
[1:39:46] there
[1:39:46] and so we're just going to rest on that
[1:39:49] this evening and and you can go finish
[1:39:54] the tape and and listen to it but I just
[1:39:59] thought there were so many nuggets in
[1:40:01] there for us tonight so Lord bless you
[1:40:04] let's stand together this evening
[1:40:11] um
[1:40:13] and we just maybe in your heart tonight
[1:40:16] that there was something within the
[1:40:19] framework of the word of God that
[1:40:22] touched you tonight
[1:40:24] and you would like to invite the spirit
[1:40:27] to come and Quicken it and make it real
[1:40:31] in you and
[1:40:32] make a change in you tonight and you
[1:40:36] just like to lift your hand to him and
[1:40:38] and say Lord I was convicted tonight by
[1:40:42] the the presence of your presence and
[1:40:46] you standing in your word and Lord I'd
[1:40:49] like to have a change of attitude I'd
[1:40:51] like to have a a change of devotion and
[1:40:54] commitment
[1:40:56] Lord I just don't feel maybe I've been
[1:40:59] as dedicated
[1:41:01] to the word as I've
[1:41:03] should have been
[1:41:05] and I'd like that spirit
[1:41:10] that refilling that
[1:41:12] brother Branham talked about
[1:41:16] so what he said he said that's what we
[1:41:18] need
[1:41:19] we need a refilling
[1:41:22] refilling is a renewing of the right
[1:41:24] attitude
[1:41:26] the renewing of our priorities
[1:41:30] a renewing of what we're living for
[1:41:34] a renewing of what bothers us
[1:41:38] he said that hybrid is said it's not
[1:41:41] rugged it can't take every every little
[1:41:44] thing destroys it
[1:41:46] it falls to Pieces over everything
[1:41:50] it's never happy
[1:41:52] you've always got to be babied
[1:41:55] Lord I want to have what's real
[1:41:59] that makes me just rugged
[1:42:02] that makes me steadfast it makes me
[1:42:05] strong
[1:42:06] Lord I like to rededicate myself tonight
[1:42:09] to you
[1:42:14] to reset my priorities on having the
[1:42:17] love of God
[1:42:19] should have brought in my heart
[1:42:21] by the Holy Spirit
[1:42:24] do you just like to take a moment and
[1:42:26] look up to him this evening and safe
[1:42:29] Lord
[1:42:31] make that change Within Me

[1:42:36] Lord I don't want to be like
[1:42:39] somebody that's important
[1:42:41] I want to be someone little enough to
[1:42:45] wash Jesus's feet
[1:42:49] to be in service for you Lord if I never
[1:42:52] get one ounce of recognition

[1:43:22] all of us to
[1:43:24] re-examine our heart

[1:43:30] re-examine what's important
[1:43:33] and if we become a little prickly and a
[1:43:36] little grumpy and a little thing that we
[1:43:39] can sweeten up our spirit
