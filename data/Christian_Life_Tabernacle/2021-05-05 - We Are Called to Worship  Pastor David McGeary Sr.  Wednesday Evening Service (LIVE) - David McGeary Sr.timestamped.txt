[48:29] father
[48:32] lord our hearts are
[48:36] coming before you this evening
[48:40] and lord we're
[48:42] [Music]
[48:44] placing ourselves in your hands
[48:48] lord we're so needy of you
[48:52] beyond our own recognition father
[48:56] the perilous times are
[49:00] certainly surrounding us father from
[49:04] so many places
[49:08] and without you father there's no way
[49:11] that
[49:12] we can even have a chance
[49:16] of succeeding in fact
[49:19] you said if the days and the hours
[49:22] weren't
[49:23] shortened that no flesh would be saved
[49:31] lord we don't know how that's
[49:34] going to transpire but our hearts
[49:37] call for it lord we just ask that you
[49:41] would
[49:42] work with each of us individually
[49:47] to mold us into the image of your son
[49:55] that the attributes father that
[49:58] you had in your heart and mind would
[50:01] reflect in us
[50:03] we just ask you to be with us this
[50:05] evening
[50:07] grant each person here father the
[50:11] secret need of their heart make a way
[50:15] and bless us we ask it in jesus name we
[50:19] pray
[50:20] amen amen if you have your bibles
[50:24] um and you would turn with me over to
[50:30] the gospel of saint john
[50:34] and so we're going to
[50:38] this sunday morning we're going to start
[50:42] into the message who is this melchizedek
[50:47] and we trust that
[50:52] it'll be a blessing and we're going to
[50:55] try to go through it slow
[50:57] and try to share some things from it
[51:00] that we
[51:01] trust will be a blessing to you
[51:04] then then the following weekends our
[51:08] meeting weekend
[51:09] and brother john andes will be here and
[51:12] and
[51:12] uh so we'll have uh um
[51:16] meetings then uh brother bunga is gonna
[51:19] get married
[51:20] i believe this saturday and he's invited
[51:24] the church
[51:25] but the reception is just kind of a
[51:27] private reception with their
[51:30] family because so but if anybody would
[51:33] like to come out
[51:34] to the wedding i believe it was on
[51:38] the back so you're certainly welcome to
[51:40] come to that
[51:42] and then after the weekend
[51:46] after our meetings we will continue on
[51:49] and who is this melchizedek and then the
[51:52] following weekend we'll be at brother
[51:54] bill ivey's
[51:55] so uh probably a good time to get out
[51:59] who is this melchizedek and
[52:01] read into it i'm excited about it amen
[52:04] so we're going to start
[52:06] tonight in it but from a completely
[52:09] different
[52:13] background of what we're trying to say
[52:15] so let's turn to this great
[52:17] scripture we all know this well the
[52:21] woman at the well and let's start at the
[52:24] 17th verse of the fourth chapter
[52:29] of the gospel of saint john
[52:36] and the woman answered and said
[52:39] i have no husband jesus
[52:43] said unto her thou hath well said
[52:47] i have no husband for thou
[52:50] hath had five husbands and he whom thou
[52:55] now hath is not thy husband
[52:58] in that saith doubt truly
[53:02] the woman said unto him sir i perceive
[53:06] that thou art a prophet our fathers
[53:10] worshiped in this mountain
[53:14] and ye say that in jerusalem
[53:18] is the place where men ought
[53:21] to worship jesus said unto her
[53:25] woman believe me the hour cometh
[53:28] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[53:32] nor yet in jerusalem worship
[53:35] the father ye worship
[53:38] ye know not what we know
[53:42] what we worship for salvation is of the
[53:45] jews
[53:47] but the hour cometh and now is
[53:50] when the true worshiper shall worship
[53:54] the father
[53:55] in spirit and in truth
[53:58] for the father seeketh such to worship
[54:01] him
[54:02] god is a spirit and they that worship
[54:06] him
[54:07] must worship him in spirit
[54:11] and in truth heavenly father we ask you
[54:13] to bless your word
[54:14] in your precious name we pray amen
[54:18] god bless you we won't be
[54:22] long to see evening but i
[54:26] i wanted to approach as you know
[54:29] this weekend we
[54:32] went last week and we went to
[54:36] missouri and and brother harold brown
[54:40] had
[54:40] passed away after a brief illness
[54:44] and of course nobody was expecting
[54:47] that at all and
[54:51] the church there of course they weren't
[54:53] expecting it
[54:54] and then sunday we had uh service
[54:58] uh for the first time there without
[55:01] their pastor
[55:02] and uh it kind of
[55:06] left uh just a kind of a hole in your
[55:09] heart you know what i mean
[55:10] i i always thought that i would see him
[55:14] again
[55:15] and that's how it is anytime
[55:18] that you lose a loved one you have
[55:21] all the images of them in your mind
[55:24] and you go back over those images in
[55:27] your mind and you
[55:29] think about the things he said and the
[55:31] way that he was
[55:33] and you start to worship those things
[55:36] and you have
[55:38] deep respect but going through all those
[55:42] feelings i
[55:43] we talked a lot about the promises
[55:46] that we have uh of
[55:49] to meet again and the life after this
[55:53] life and those are great uh comforting
[55:56] words
[55:56] but you still you still feel
[56:00] uh that you would like to
[56:03] one more time have a moment
[56:06] with him in this realm and uh
[56:09] but uh so going through that
[56:15] it really kind of made me reflect
[56:18] a lot on the feelings that i had towards
[56:22] brother brown
[56:23] and tried to bring them back to
[56:25] sometimes the feelings that we have
[56:27] for the lord and it brought me to the
[56:31] subject tonight i would just like to
[56:33] spend just a
[56:35] very brief time on
[56:38] is about worship
[56:41] we know that god wasn't even
[56:44] god until he had somebody to worship him
[56:49] because that's what god is he's an
[56:52] object of worship
[56:54] so in the beginning he was just the
[56:57] self-existing one
[57:00] the i am he just there was
[57:03] nothing to worship him there was nobody
[57:06] to
[57:07] understand uh what that he was
[57:12] and he wanted to share himself
[57:15] i think that's marvelous isn't it that
[57:17] such a great
[57:18] person would want to share himself with
[57:21] someone so insignificant
[57:23] as we are but that was his plan
[57:28] god wanted to be worshiped so
[57:31] he created the angels
[57:36] and in creating the angels to worship
[57:39] him
[57:40] that made him god
[57:43] so now he was worshiped so the very
[57:46] intentions of god
[57:48] and the very desire of god in the first
[57:52] place
[57:52] is to be worshiped we so many times
[57:57] in our carnal state we we don't really
[58:01] understand
[58:02] worship we accumulate
[58:05] knowledge of something i know
[58:09] even young
[58:13] men i mean teenagers young boys 11
[58:16] 9 and 10 you'll mention a
[58:20] an athlete and they'll tell you how many
[58:23] rebounds he grabbed in 74
[58:25] and if he was on the all-star team and
[58:29] and you know this year and that year and
[58:32] he what school he graduated from and
[58:35] and he has all the statistics
[58:38] about this athlete and has an
[58:42] ad admiration for him
[58:45] and and some sort of identity
[58:48] but he never meant him
[58:51] amen he doesn't really know
[58:54] this person he
[58:58] might find out that
[59:02] if he was to approach this person that
[59:04] he idolized
[59:06] or he kept in his mind in such high
[59:09] esteem
[59:10] that this person might not have the time
[59:12] of day for him
[59:14] he might say get away from me kid get
[59:17] out of my face
[59:18] uh you know don't bug me you know
[59:22] go back to your mommy or or whatever and
[59:26] there
[59:27] and so it wouldn't matter all the
[59:29] adoration
[59:30] and everything that he had for this
[59:33] great star
[59:34] or this movie star or or
[59:38] whatever it was all
[59:41] made up in his mind
[59:45] and therefore it wasn't true
[59:49] you understand now we just read the
[59:51] scripture that god
[59:53] is seeking those to worship him
[59:56] and in truth so we know that we've been
[1:00:00] created to worship so worship
[1:00:03] is something that we need
[1:00:06] to do in order to be fulfilled
[1:00:11] and in order to have a fulfillment in
[1:00:14] our life
[1:00:14] and the satisfaction in our life to
[1:00:17] really ever come in contact with the
[1:00:19] real purpose
[1:00:21] that why that you're born and why that
[1:00:23] you're put here
[1:00:24] why the events have taken place in your
[1:00:27] life everything really comes back is
[1:00:30] that
[1:00:30] we were created to worship god
[1:00:33] and that's why that god created the
[1:00:36] heavens and earth
[1:00:38] he created the heavens and earth so that
[1:00:41] the invisible things of god could
[1:00:43] clearly be seen
[1:00:45] in the visible things around us and by
[1:00:48] seeing those things and seeing his
[1:00:50] majesty
[1:00:51] and seeing the glory and the beauty and
[1:00:54] the order
[1:00:55] of of the universe and the
[1:00:58] uh marvelous depths of his
[1:01:02] creation as as i mentioned to you before
[1:01:05] as a boy i i would go to the library
[1:01:09] and get these the big book up out it was
[1:01:12] about
[1:01:12] this book and you would open up and the
[1:01:15] whole book was beetles
[1:01:17] not them long-haired things that
[1:01:21] weren't even in god's thinking to begin
[1:01:24] with
[1:01:25] but these are these are the
[1:01:28] little beetles and i would just marvel
[1:01:31] at the colors and
[1:01:32] and then maybe sometimes you've seen uh
[1:01:35] some of these placards that
[1:01:37] they put out where they have the
[1:01:39] butterflies
[1:01:40] and every butterfly has a letter on its
[1:01:44] back and you can just
[1:01:45] go and see right on the butterfly the
[1:01:48] whole
[1:01:49] alphabet and and all those things are
[1:01:52] the majesty of god it's god wanting to
[1:01:56] express himself and wanting to be
[1:02:00] seen and and wanting to
[1:02:03] uh for man to
[1:02:07] understand that he is
[1:02:10] and men should have first understood
[1:02:12] that there was a god
[1:02:14] in creation they should have known that
[1:02:17] god
[1:02:17] was by looking at the stars looking at
[1:02:20] the sun
[1:02:22] and the moon and it shows you how
[1:02:23] ignorant man is
[1:02:25] to think that all that just happened
[1:02:28] because there was some big bang theory
[1:02:32] or or some something somewhere
[1:02:36] started all this uh you know it's sad
[1:02:40] that people are in such condition
[1:02:44] but nevertheless the scripture says it's
[1:02:46] hidden
[1:02:47] from the wise and prudent and revealed
[1:02:51] unto babes so this this evening just
[1:02:54] before we start into our series
[1:02:57] of this of who is this mount mel keys
[1:03:00] adapt
[1:03:01] i want justin that everything that god
[1:03:04] was doing was so that he could be
[1:03:07] worshipped
[1:03:09] and that that is the most important
[1:03:12] thing
[1:03:12] and i know that we think that singing
[1:03:15] songs
[1:03:16] is worship but when we sing songs a lot
[1:03:20] of times we're enjoying the melody
[1:03:22] we're enjoying the word and
[1:03:25] and that's good i'm not i'm not
[1:03:29] putting that uh anywhere
[1:03:32] making fun of that or putting it down i
[1:03:34] enjoy it
[1:03:35] but sometimes we call that worship
[1:03:38] and and and and we have what we call
[1:03:42] a praise and and worship matthew and i
[1:03:46] visited
[1:03:46] a building today that i always admired i
[1:03:50] i would drive by it and say i think i'd
[1:03:53] like to have that church i
[1:03:55] think i'd like to have that church you
[1:03:57] know that was my cardinal mind so
[1:03:59] matthew said you know i'm kind of tired
[1:04:01] of hearing that
[1:04:04] why don't we just drive over there so we
[1:04:07] drove there and contacted the gentleman
[1:04:09] and
[1:04:09] the pastor and we went into the church
[1:04:13] and uh and it's a big church you know
[1:04:16] we walked around and i thought you know
[1:04:18] what i don't want this church
[1:04:22] i have no desire it took everything
[1:04:25] out of me but you know they have a
[1:04:28] praise and worship leader and they have
[1:04:30] a
[1:04:31] youth leader and they have in every room
[1:04:34] has got a
[1:04:34] ministry the minister of this and the
[1:04:37] minister of that
[1:04:38] and all uh all these great programs
[1:04:42] and and uh so he asked us about our
[1:04:45] church you know
[1:04:46] and and uh i didn't drop the whole bomb
[1:04:49] on him i
[1:04:50] tried to make arrangements to take him
[1:04:52] out to lunch you know
[1:04:55] because he has service this evening and
[1:04:57] i know if i would have visited with him
[1:04:59] and told him everything i believed
[1:05:02] he'd be preaching about me like i'm
[1:05:04] preaching about him
[1:05:08] uh so uh
[1:05:12] you know and and so uh
[1:05:16] uh you know we visited with them and it
[1:05:18] it
[1:05:19] it was really nice but
[1:05:22] it struck me so much
[1:05:26] this scripture as i visited with this
[1:05:29] fine
[1:05:30] young man that just took over the church
[1:05:33] it was the scripture that said ye
[1:05:35] worship
[1:05:36] ye know not what and
[1:05:40] it brought me to this subject matter
[1:05:42] tonight
[1:05:44] that we need to worship god
[1:05:48] and not as a group but as an individual
[1:05:52] we we really need to know
[1:05:55] what it really means to worship him
[1:05:58] and i saw the more i thought about it
[1:06:01] and the more i
[1:06:02] i prayed about it i came to this
[1:06:06] thought is that you cannot worship god
[1:06:09] without revelation
[1:06:13] you cannot worship god
[1:06:16] without revelation in order to worship
[1:06:20] god
[1:06:21] you've got to know he says
[1:06:24] you worship what you know not
[1:06:27] and i thought of this man is he there
[1:06:31] and i knew from
[1:06:32] his affiliation that he was a
[1:06:35] a trinitarian he believed in the three
[1:06:38] persons of god and and
[1:06:43] that's not a good argument because their
[1:06:46] bottom line is that you can't explain it
[1:06:50] but i knew that there was no way for him
[1:06:53] to worship
[1:06:54] god the way that god desires
[1:06:58] to be worshipped because god desires to
[1:07:02] be worshipped in
[1:07:03] spirit and in truth
[1:07:06] and there's only one way that we can
[1:07:09] receive
[1:07:10] truth and that's by revelation
[1:07:14] and so i'd like to read this statement
[1:07:16] if you don't mind
[1:07:17] uh and this is this talking it i'll pick
[1:07:21] this up
[1:07:22] uh here on page eight of who is mel keys
[1:07:26] is that
[1:07:26] a baptist minister a few weeks ago
[1:07:30] come up to my house and said i'd like to
[1:07:33] straighten you out
[1:07:35] on the godhead sometime
[1:07:39] when you got time called
[1:07:42] me up rather and i said i got time
[1:07:46] right now because i want to be
[1:07:49] straight and and we
[1:07:53] lay aside everything else to do
[1:07:56] it and he come and said
[1:07:59] brother branham you teach there is just
[1:08:03] one god i said yes sir
[1:08:08] he said well he said i believe there's
[1:08:10] one god
[1:08:11] but one god in three persons
[1:08:14] i said sir repeat that again
[1:08:19] he said one god in three persons
[1:08:23] i said where did you go
[1:08:26] to school at see
[1:08:30] he told me the bible college
[1:08:34] and i said i could believe that you
[1:08:37] cannot be
[1:08:38] a person without being a personality
[1:08:42] and if you're a personality you are
[1:08:46] one personality to yourself
[1:08:50] your separate individual being
[1:08:54] and he said well the theologians
[1:08:57] can't even explain that
[1:09:00] and i said it's by revelation
[1:09:06] now look at how important as we read
[1:09:08] this next few statements
[1:09:10] that revelation is to worship
[1:09:14] he said i said then there's
[1:09:17] no way for god to ever
[1:09:21] get to you because it's hid
[1:09:24] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:09:28] and revealed to babes revealed
[1:09:31] revelation revealed to babes
[1:09:34] such as will accept it
[1:09:39] learn that's what
[1:09:42] learn is is to accept you don't
[1:09:45] learn something if you don't accept it
[1:09:48] you might know about it but when you
[1:09:50] learn something
[1:09:52] you learn how to do it if you were to
[1:09:56] learn uh fly fishing for example
[1:10:00] well you would learn how to pull the
[1:10:02] line out and how to
[1:10:04] take your pole back and and how to lay
[1:10:08] the fly out there and how to stream it
[1:10:11] as you
[1:10:12] you would accept the method
[1:10:15] of fly fishing okay you would
[1:10:18] practice that method you you don't uh
[1:10:22] learn about fellowshipping with
[1:10:25] brother james we were fellowshipping on
[1:10:27] this subject and i said it was like
[1:10:29] me to go into a simulator
[1:10:33] and sit in the cockpit of a simulator
[1:10:36] and say i learned to fly
[1:10:40] i would have never learned to fly till i
[1:10:43] flew
[1:10:44] you understand until i actually did it
[1:10:48] until i actually performed it
[1:10:51] and accepted everything that
[1:10:54] i learned except it
[1:10:58] and put it into practice because then
[1:11:01] i learned you know
[1:11:05] you don't have knowledge of something
[1:11:08] is not exactly the accepting of it
[1:11:11] or or the learning of it to really learn
[1:11:15] something i've really learned my lesson
[1:11:19] you know when you learn your lesson you
[1:11:21] learn not to do it again
[1:11:24] you understand you learned your lesson i
[1:11:26] know what this
[1:11:27] causes i know what this does i know what
[1:11:30] the result is
[1:11:32] i accept the result of these actions
[1:11:36] and what they've caused i've learned
[1:11:38] that to be true
[1:11:39] so i'm going to accept this result and
[1:11:42] i'm not going to do it anymore
[1:11:44] because i know what the result's going
[1:11:46] to be
[1:11:47] and the definition of insanity with
[1:11:50] is always the one that you hear it's
[1:11:52] common uh
[1:11:54] per insanity is to do the same thing
[1:11:58] over and over again expecting a
[1:12:00] different result
[1:12:03] if you stick your finger in the fire
[1:12:05] you're going to get burned
[1:12:07] you know when do you accept that fact
[1:12:12] can you know what i mean you accept that
[1:12:14] fact
[1:12:15] when you if you keep putting your finger
[1:12:17] in the fire
[1:12:18] thinking you're not going to get burned
[1:12:20] or that you're going to
[1:12:22] through some sort of mind over
[1:12:25] matter you know it's not going to burn
[1:12:28] you it's going to burn you
[1:12:31] and when you accept that you've learned
[1:12:33] that back
[1:12:34] and now you accept the practice of not
[1:12:37] putting your finger in the fire
[1:12:39] what would you call somebody if they
[1:12:41] kept sticking their finger in the fire
[1:12:42] you'd say man you're insane
[1:12:47] you're going to get burned and it's
[1:12:50] going to happen
[1:12:50] every time when are you going to learn
[1:12:54] when are you going to accept so if you
[1:12:57] have understand now that so
[1:12:58] worship you can't
[1:13:01] worship without accepting
[1:13:05] revelation let's read on he said
[1:13:09] accept it learn and i said
[1:13:12] there be no way for god
[1:13:16] to get to you
[1:13:19] you closed yourself off from him
[1:13:22] the whole bible is the revelation of god
[1:13:27] the whole church is built
[1:13:30] upon the revelation of god
[1:13:34] there's no other way to know god
[1:13:38] only by revelation
[1:13:41] so there's no way to know god except by
[1:13:44] revelation so if you don't accept the
[1:13:48] revelation
[1:13:49] then you are worshiping
[1:13:52] an idol
[1:13:56] in other words you're worshiping your
[1:13:58] own concept
[1:14:00] you're worshiping your own idea
[1:14:04] of what god is so many people today
[1:14:08] still in their mind worship a man
[1:14:11] two thousand years ago walking on
[1:14:14] the the the
[1:14:17] shores of galilee and they picture and
[1:14:21] they're worshiping jesus and you say
[1:14:23] worship jesus when you go back and
[1:14:26] you're worshiping
[1:14:28] for expert where that he was
[1:14:32] a good example for example if if i took
[1:14:36] sister
[1:14:37] janet and i walked up to her and i said
[1:14:40] oh
[1:14:40] jenny here's five dollars uh you
[1:14:43] graduated from eighth grade
[1:14:50] you know well she deserves a hundred
[1:14:54] times that
[1:14:56] you know what i mean because that's not
[1:14:58] what we're
[1:14:59] giving her credit for we're not
[1:15:02] what we're recognizing her for
[1:15:06] you understand work so it you can't
[1:15:09] if if you don't accept revelation
[1:15:13] and you're worshiping him for
[1:15:16] something that he's done in the past
[1:15:19] he's not really receiving the worship
[1:15:24] that is present tense
[1:15:29] you understand and you have to worship
[1:15:32] god
[1:15:32] in the present tense okay the the word
[1:15:36] worship
[1:15:36] means to respect or
[1:15:40] hold an admiration or devotion
[1:15:43] so if you're going to hold something in
[1:15:45] in in
[1:15:46] admiration you've got you're admiring
[1:15:49] what that is transpiring now what god is
[1:15:53] doing now we're not worshiping a
[1:15:55] historical god
[1:15:57] because our bible tells us that he's the
[1:15:59] same
[1:16:00] yesterday today and forever so he can be
[1:16:03] worshiped
[1:16:04] now right now where he
[1:16:07] is now and he can be worshiped in spirit
[1:16:11] and in truth but you can't have
[1:16:14] truth without revelation so you can't
[1:16:17] worship god
[1:16:19] for something that he's not
[1:16:25] you can't worship god for what he's not
[1:16:28] and i thought of this man he's got this
[1:16:30] great big church and
[1:16:32] of course his church has struggled
[1:16:33] through covent and eck
[1:16:35] and he's worshipped and he he
[1:16:38] he believes there's three persons
[1:16:42] and i thought there's no way my friend
[1:16:45] that you can
[1:16:46] really worship god because you're not
[1:16:48] worshiping him
[1:16:50] because he's not three people
[1:16:55] he's one god we know and we understand
[1:16:59] in three offices you know
[1:17:01] just like me i'm a i'm a father and i'm
[1:17:04] a grandfather and i'm a husband
[1:17:06] three distinct offices my my wife has no
[1:17:10] claim to me is grandpa
[1:17:14] she better never call me grandpa see
[1:17:17] she's
[1:17:19] pushing it then right but
[1:17:22] it i'm still who i am i'm one person
[1:17:25] but i have an office of grandpa
[1:17:29] because that i show grandpa attributes
[1:17:33] you know one of the great grandpa
[1:17:35] attributes we're sitting at a restaurant
[1:17:37] the waitress comes up
[1:17:38] and she says can can they have dr pepper
[1:17:42] i said sure
[1:17:44] they can have whatever they want i'm the
[1:17:47] grandpa
[1:17:51] it's a different relationship it's a
[1:17:53] different office it's something
[1:17:55] totally totally different and then
[1:17:58] you know i'm a father so i i you know
[1:18:01] i i have my children
[1:18:05] and and my wife doesn't have a claim to
[1:18:07] that
[1:18:08] neither does my grandchildren have a
[1:18:11] claim to
[1:18:12] that but yet i'm one person manifesting
[1:18:15] myself
[1:18:16] and the attributes that i have in three
[1:18:19] different
[1:18:20] offices so if you if you don't
[1:18:23] understand that
[1:18:24] and you think that your worship if you
[1:18:27] can't worship
[1:18:28] what you don't know
[1:18:33] and so when you recognize that that god
[1:18:36] can't be
[1:18:37] worshiped for something that he's not
[1:18:42] and he can't be worshipped in
[1:18:45] past tense
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:49] you might work try to worship him in
[1:18:52] future tense
[1:18:55] but there's a measure of presumption
[1:18:59] with that because god interprets his
[1:19:02] word
[1:19:03] by bringing it the past
[1:19:06] and that's what god wants to be
[1:19:09] worshipped for
[1:19:10] is the bringing to pass of his word
[1:19:14] that that's what he wants that's where
[1:19:16] the praise should be
[1:19:18] that's what the worship should be that's
[1:19:20] what the recognition
[1:19:22] should be it's not there's a god
[1:19:25] and i'm going to put god off somewhere
[1:19:28] and i'm going to say there's a god
[1:19:30] when the very god that created the
[1:19:33] heavens earth
[1:19:34] is alive in our midst bringing forth his
[1:19:38] word
[1:19:39] the same yesterday today and forever to
[1:19:42] proving and manifesting himself
[1:19:45] to be the creator of heaven and earth
[1:19:48] that's what he needs to be
[1:19:51] worshipped for
[1:19:55] you a church is
[1:19:58] we we call it a place of worship but
[1:20:02] but it worship is
[1:20:06] not a a time
[1:20:09] or a set-aside time or a set-aside place
[1:20:15] we don't go to church to worship
[1:20:22] you don't go to church to worship we say
[1:20:25] that
[1:20:27] you understand but worship is in
[1:20:30] revelation you can't worship
[1:20:34] without revelation there's no way
[1:20:37] to worship without revelation he says
[1:20:40] he says he says there's no other way to
[1:20:43] know god
[1:20:44] only by revelation to whom the son will
[1:20:47] reveal him
[1:20:49] revelation everything is revelation
[1:20:52] so not to expect
[1:20:56] except the revelation then you're just
[1:20:59] a cold theologian and there's no
[1:21:02] hope for you not you understand
[1:21:06] not to accept revelation automatically
[1:21:10] takes you out of the ability to really
[1:21:14] worship god for what he's doing
[1:21:22] revelation is such a part
[1:21:26] of worship and so
[1:21:29] when we begin to understand that
[1:21:32] that's what god elected you for
[1:21:36] and gave you revelation because he was
[1:21:39] seeking such to worship him
[1:21:44] so when he talked to this girl
[1:21:47] this young girl said sir i perceive
[1:21:50] you to be a prophet our father's worship
[1:21:53] he says the time's coming
[1:21:58] that you won't worship in this place
[1:22:01] this mountain or in jerusalem
[1:22:05] but that you'll worship the father in
[1:22:08] spirit
[1:22:09] and in truth in other words you will
[1:22:13] worship
[1:22:13] god in revelation
[1:22:18] you can i know where so many people are
[1:22:20] going to churches
[1:22:21] they're in cold formal denominations
[1:22:24] because they have no contact with god
[1:22:26] god's not
[1:22:27] showing them anything he's not revealing
[1:22:30] himself
[1:22:30] they've accepted a cold catechism and
[1:22:34] when you accept a cold catechism
[1:22:36] of creeds and dogmas and what people
[1:22:39] have derived
[1:22:40] for and and what they've taught for
[1:22:42] generations and generations
[1:22:44] there's no way that you're in contact
[1:22:47] with a real
[1:22:48] living present person
[1:23:05] fail to understand that without
[1:23:08] god speaking to you and revealing to you
[1:23:12] and making himself known to you you
[1:23:15] can't worship him in truth
[1:23:23] you can't worship him in spirit unless
[1:23:26] he reveals his spirit to you
[1:23:30] all true worship
[1:23:33] is built on revelation if you would say
[1:23:37] i want to worship him
[1:23:39] you really want to worship the lord pray
[1:23:41] for revelation
[1:23:42] pray that he could show you because
[1:23:45] you're going to
[1:23:46] worship him for what he reveals to you
[1:23:51] that's why he reveals it
[1:23:55] that's why he chose talk sheep he said
[1:23:58] when the messiah comes he'll do these
[1:24:00] things
[1:24:00] and he began to fellowship with her and
[1:24:03] she
[1:24:04] so moved him
[1:24:09] that he said to her i
[1:24:13] am he every place
[1:24:17] else he he lays it out there in such a
[1:24:20] way
[1:24:22] but she had accepted
[1:24:25] the revelation
[1:24:29] she accepted his discernment
[1:24:32] she accepted his doctrine
[1:24:35] she accepted that she wanted to drink of
[1:24:38] this living water
[1:24:39] when she accepted the revelation and she
[1:24:42] accepted what he
[1:24:44] he taught her when he accept what he
[1:24:46] revealed to her
[1:24:47] after she accepted the revelation came
[1:24:50] and therefore he said that i am he
[1:24:54] then she ran into the city and said come
[1:24:57] see a man
[1:24:58] in other words come worship a man
[1:25:02] that revealed to me
[1:25:05] the secrets of my heart
[1:25:12] the importance of revelation
[1:25:16] and as i said you can't worship
[1:25:19] somebody for past accomplishments
[1:25:25] i hope jenna didn't mind me but she did
[1:25:27] graduate from eighth grade
[1:25:34] and that's a great accomplishment
[1:25:37] you know i never graduated from high
[1:25:39] school so i certainly know
[1:25:41] what a great accomplishment is for those
[1:25:45] that go on and i've never ever felt that
[1:25:50] persons shouldn't get all the education
[1:25:52] that they're capable of
[1:25:54] getting you just don't trust in it
[1:25:59] you know if someone would feel
[1:26:03] led to go on to be a doctor we have
[1:26:05] doctors in here this evening
[1:26:07] and great accomplishments and we have
[1:26:09] professors and
[1:26:11] we have uh you know
[1:26:14] physical scientists nuclear
[1:26:17] scientist guys that are so smart i can't
[1:26:20] even talk to him
[1:26:23] which is good but you don't trust in it
[1:26:27] so we never try to hold anybody up but
[1:26:29] when we can understand
[1:26:31] that revelation is what you're
[1:26:34] worshiping
[1:26:35] you're actually worshiping the unfolding
[1:26:40] of god because the whole book is a
[1:26:43] revelation it's a revelation of jesus
[1:26:46] christ
[1:26:46] well when god gives you a revelation
[1:26:48] he's revealing
[1:26:50] himself to you so you
[1:26:53] can worship him not worship your own
[1:26:56] idea
[1:26:57] not worship what you've been taught not
[1:27:00] associate yourself with the system
[1:27:04] and then think it's worship
[1:27:08] i'd like to read a statement
[1:27:11] if i could
[1:27:18] he says oh that people might come
[1:27:21] unto him and find
[1:27:25] that rest there is a cry
[1:27:28] in all hearts for that rest
[1:27:32] but the majority don't know the answer
[1:27:36] so they try to steal
[1:27:40] the cry by a religious
[1:27:44] process
[1:27:46] of keeping certain days or accepting
[1:27:50] denominational creeds
[1:27:52] and dogmas there's a cry in us
[1:27:56] for rest there's a crying us for truth
[1:28:00] there's a cry in us to worship
[1:28:04] now if you're if you want your lives to
[1:28:06] be void of worship
[1:28:08] and and that's what i even say for those
[1:28:11] that are
[1:28:12] streaming and those of us here this
[1:28:15] is the hour that the world
[1:28:18] wants to rob us from our dedication to
[1:28:21] god
[1:28:24] they'll do whatever they can to move him
[1:28:27] from spot number one
[1:28:29] where he's got the total preeminence of
[1:28:32] our lives
[1:28:33] where we're praying for revelation as he
[1:28:35] reveals himself to us
[1:28:37] and we see him in truth see him there
[1:28:41] unfolding his word actually see the
[1:28:44] living lord god
[1:28:46] manifested in the fulfillment of his
[1:28:49] word
[1:28:50] and then you can actually worship him
[1:28:52] and praise him
[1:28:54] and know that you're dealing and
[1:28:56] worshiping
[1:28:57] the very person himself
[1:29:02] but this is the hour he's trying to rob
[1:29:05] that
[1:29:08] too busy to pray for revelation
[1:29:12] we accept the substitute and this is
[1:29:15] what he said they have this cry
[1:29:17] and so they try to steal
[1:29:20] the cry by religious
[1:29:24] process of keeping certain days
[1:29:28] or accepting denominational creeds you
[1:29:31] don't worship god
[1:29:34] by going to church on easter
[1:29:38] or by going to church on christmas or by
[1:29:41] going to mass
[1:29:44] for whatever process
[1:29:47] you worship god by seeing him
[1:29:55] until he becomes personal through divine
[1:29:59] revelation
[1:30:00] you're only worshiping an idea
[1:30:04] and that's not spirit and truth
[1:30:08] he says but failing
[1:30:12] in that in other words people
[1:30:15] fail to find that rest they fail to find
[1:30:19] the rest in religious process
[1:30:21] or accepting creeds and dogmas by
[1:30:24] failing in that
[1:30:25] many try drinking carousing
[1:30:30] can air every physical excess
[1:30:34] thinking that by worldly pleasures
[1:30:38] they can be there can be some
[1:30:42] satisfaction but in such
[1:30:45] there is no rest
[1:30:48] they smoke and take pills to quiet their
[1:30:52] nerves
[1:30:53] but there is no rest in earthly
[1:30:58] potions they need jesus
[1:31:02] they need the heavenly redeemer
[1:31:06] the rest of the spirit then most of them
[1:31:09] go to church on sunday that is
[1:31:13] good but even they have
[1:31:16] no idea of how to
[1:31:19] approach god and how to worship him
[1:31:26] they go to church but they have no idea
[1:31:29] how to approach god or how to worship
[1:31:32] them
[1:31:33] but because you can't worship something
[1:31:36] that he's not
[1:31:41] and so when you begin to understand that
[1:31:43] worship you're created to worship he
[1:31:45] called you to worship
[1:31:47] he elected you to worship he chose you
[1:31:50] and gave you revelation so you can be a
[1:31:54] true worshiper
[1:31:55] for the true worshiper is going to
[1:31:58] worship him in spirit and in truth
[1:32:00] and the only way to get the spirit and
[1:32:02] the truth
[1:32:03] is by divine revelation he has got to
[1:32:07] show it to you
[1:32:08] so you've got to ask yourself am i going
[1:32:10] to accept what man tells me
[1:32:12] am i going to accept just what everybody
[1:32:14] calls religion
[1:32:15] am i going to accept america as
[1:32:17] christian america
[1:32:19] is not christian america
[1:32:23] is lost
[1:32:28] they condone homosexual marriages they
[1:32:30] can
[1:32:31] dome the changing of the creation of god
[1:32:34] they now think that the choice
[1:32:36] that where god said he made them male
[1:32:38] and female maybe him
[1:32:40] no they say that's not true we will make
[1:32:43] ourselves
[1:32:44] male or female
[1:32:47] we'll decide we'll let you decide
[1:32:53] it's an abomination
[1:32:56] and there's one thing that comes when
[1:32:59] you reject god
[1:33:00] and that's judgment and there's nothing
[1:33:03] left for this country
[1:33:04] but judgment because they can't worship
[1:33:07] him
[1:33:08] because they don't know who he is
[1:33:17] no you want to talk it's important
[1:33:20] because god's looking for true
[1:33:23] worshipers
[1:33:25] he's going through your lives he's
[1:33:26] looking over this congregation
[1:33:28] he says who's worshipping me
[1:33:31] who knows who i am sees me unveiling
[1:33:35] myself
[1:33:36] sees me fulfilling my word sees me
[1:33:39] carrying out my promises
[1:33:41] and says lord i worship you i see you
[1:33:45] i know who you are i praise you for for
[1:33:48] fulfilling your word i i saw what you've
[1:33:51] done in this generation
[1:33:53] i praise you for it
[1:34:01] they don't know how to worship him jesus
[1:34:03] said the true worshiper
[1:34:05] was in spirit and truth but what kind of
[1:34:08] worship
[1:34:09] can you get in a church that knows
[1:34:13] so little of god and puts up
[1:34:17] with santa claus at christmas and
[1:34:19] bunnies at easter
[1:34:25] you see another it's kind of a reverse
[1:34:29] if you eliminate all the things that
[1:34:31] aren't worship
[1:34:32] you will eventually come down to there's
[1:34:35] only one thing
[1:34:36] that brings true worship and that's
[1:34:38] divine revelation
[1:34:42] where did they get that
[1:34:46] they got it from the pagans and made it
[1:34:49] part
[1:34:50] of the church doctrine but when one
[1:34:53] turns to the lord
[1:34:55] and is filled with the holy ghost
[1:34:58] he ceases from all such things
[1:35:02] he has a rest in his soul
[1:35:05] he really begins to live
[1:35:08] and love god and worship him
[1:35:14] amen
[1:35:20] he says this he says now notice
[1:35:23] in the second verse the second verse
[1:35:26] here
[1:35:27] in deuteronomy 16 worship in the place
[1:35:31] that i have chosen you must worship god
[1:35:36] you must worship god ask yourself just
[1:35:40] this evening
[1:35:40] just to challenge you are you really
[1:35:43] worshiping the lord
[1:35:46] do you have a time set aside in your
[1:35:48] life
[1:35:50] that you recognize him you recognize him
[1:35:53] for what he's doing
[1:35:55] not just what he did not what he's going
[1:35:58] to do
[1:35:59] but worship him for what he's doing
[1:36:02] right now
[1:36:03] to really praise him and and recognize
[1:36:07] his presence with you
[1:36:08] and recognizes grace in your life
[1:36:11] recognize how he's keeping you
[1:36:13] and defending you
[1:36:20] that's what he's looking for that's who
[1:36:22] he's seeking
[1:36:24] he says you must worship
[1:36:28] him worship in the place i have chosen
[1:36:31] now you must worship god he said in the
[1:36:34] place that i have chosen
[1:36:36] not what someone else chose but what i
[1:36:40] have chosen
[1:36:41] now if god chose a place it behooves us
[1:36:46] then to find out what he said about it
[1:36:50] and where is it
[1:36:55] i want to find it because truly
[1:36:58] i want to worship him we all
[1:37:02] are here tonight to worship
[1:37:05] him we're sitting here tonight
[1:37:09] as methodists baptists catholics jehovah
[1:37:12] witness
[1:37:13] christian science and all
[1:37:16] but we're all seeking something
[1:37:19] we want to know truth
[1:37:22] the bible said ye shall know the truth
[1:37:26] and the truth shall make you free
[1:37:30] you can't know what you're doing
[1:37:33] you don't know how to do it until you
[1:37:36] know
[1:37:37] how to do it you don't know what to do
[1:37:41] until you know how to do it rather
[1:37:44] you don't know what to do until
[1:37:48] you know how to do it you must
[1:37:51] know what you're going
[1:37:54] and how to do it
[1:37:57] you must know what you're doing and how
[1:38:00] you're doing it how do you know that
[1:38:06] there's only one way to know it by
[1:38:09] revelation
[1:38:12] god didn't give us this message to make
[1:38:14] us smarter
[1:38:16] and more theologically prepared
[1:38:20] than somebody else he revealed himself
[1:38:24] how many believes the word of god
[1:38:26] is the revelation of jesus christ how
[1:38:29] many believe that that's what the
[1:38:31] opening of the seals was it was the
[1:38:33] revelation
[1:38:34] of the persian of jesus christ man
[1:38:37] through seven
[1:38:38] ages was guessing at what they were
[1:38:41] worshiping
[1:38:42] they didn't know what they had they
[1:38:44] thought he was three gods they thought
[1:38:46] he was a saint
[1:38:47] they thought they could make
[1:38:48] intercession they didn't know about this
[1:38:50] they didn't know about that
[1:38:52] he he was hid
[1:38:55] but now in this last day he revealed
[1:38:59] himself
[1:39:00] so that we could know that he's present
[1:39:03] tense
[1:39:04] and he chose you and gave you
[1:39:08] revelation so you could see him
[1:39:12] see you see that he's alive he's he's a
[1:39:15] spirit
[1:39:18] and that's what revelation is revelation
[1:39:21] is
[1:39:21] spiritual i sav that you can see
[1:39:25] spirit you only see spirit
[1:39:29] by revelation when you have a revelation
[1:39:32] it's so
[1:39:33] clear to you it's so real to you what's
[1:39:36] happened
[1:39:37] it's happening in the spiritual realm
[1:39:39] but you see
[1:39:40] it you see it as if it had actually
[1:39:43] taken on
[1:39:43] form hallelujah who is this melchizedek
[1:39:52] taken on form is so real
[1:39:56] and so you can really worship him

[1:40:03] amen i don't want to i don't want to
[1:40:05] worship him

[1:40:11] but through divine revelation i
[1:40:14] want to worship the hymn

[1:41:29] beyond worship worshipping him for what
[1:41:32] he's done
[1:41:34] but don't you just want to worship him
[1:41:36] in present tense

[1:41:41] person himself

[1:41:47] am i making i hope i'm making myself i'm
[1:41:50] struggling
[1:41:51] just to find the words that when he when
[1:41:54] he makes himself known
[1:41:56] in divine revelation and he's standing
[1:41:59] there in the fulfillment and the person
[1:42:01] of his word

[1:42:05] is amen let's pray our gracious heavenly
[1:42:08] father

[1:42:15] maybe you'd say in your heart you know
[1:42:17] i'm not really as
