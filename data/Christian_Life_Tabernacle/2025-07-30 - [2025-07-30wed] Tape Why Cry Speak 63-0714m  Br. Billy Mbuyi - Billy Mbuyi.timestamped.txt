[12:15] I look to you.
[12:19] I my
[12:23] trust in you.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Am I just such a wonderful
[12:33] presence?
[12:35] Maybe we'll just use this moment to open
[12:37] the service in prayer and also just take
[12:40] up the tithes and the offerings.
[12:45] We serve a a living savior.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Many religions and people out there,
[12:54] they might have a god, but their god's
[12:57] in a grave somewhere dead. But our tomb
[13:00] is empty. Our Lord Jesus is risen. and
[13:03] he's ascended on high and he looks out
[13:05] over our needs. So maybe why don't we
[13:07] just all go ahead and stand as they
[13:09] continue to softly play and I'll ask
[13:12] brother Paul just to come and open our
[13:14] service and prayer and we we do have
[13:18] some needs that have uh been made known
[13:20] and we just want to remember uh brother
[13:23] John Amati as he has a procedure I
[13:26] believe that's tomorrow right and uh
[13:31] let's all be in prayer
[13:35] just looking for wonderful testimonies
[13:38] to come forward and also uh sister Magna
[13:42] has uh get put out a prayer request for
[13:44] a family member. I don't know um where
[13:50] uh it was very urgent. Looked like uh
[13:52] his life could be taken at any moment.
[13:55] He was in a coma and I I know the
[13:57] doctors were saying it's very grave. I
[13:58] don't know what the situation is right
[14:00] now. Uh if he's still with us or where
[14:03] that condition is, but uh let's remember
[14:05] sister Magnum uh her family member. I
[14:08] believe he's in Mexico and uh just been
[14:10] in a coma and they've been trying to uh
[14:13] revitalize him, but maybe you have a
[14:16] need that you just want to lift your
[14:18] hand up.
[14:20] You know, prayer changes things. The
[14:22] scripture says the prayer of a righteous
[14:23] man avaleth much. And you it's not our
[14:26] righteousness, but it's it's his
[14:28] righteousness. So, I'm just in
[14:31] expectation for what God has for us.
[14:35] Brother Paul, if you'd come

[18:14] wonderful atmosphere. Um I'm in a great
[18:17] expectation for the word. Amen.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why should I worry when giants
[18:25] come calling my name?
[18:29] [Music]
[18:31] Oh, and my God is so much bigger than
[18:36] the troubles I face.
[18:42] And why would I hunger for power or
[18:47] riches or fame?
[18:52] Oh, cuz my God is so much better than
[18:58] all of these things.
[19:03] I won't be sh
[19:06] brother Billy comes for and I won't be
[19:10] moved.
[19:14] My God is faithful.
[19:19] His promise is true.
[19:24] So I'll speak to the mountain.
[19:29] Oh, it's time to move. Cuz
[19:36] my God is bigger, better, stronger, and
[19:41] greater than you.
[19:46] When
[19:47] my enemies scatter, cuz they know the
[19:51] battle is done.
[19:54] [Music]
[19:57] Oh, and my God is stronger. The victory
[20:04] [Music]
[20:12] rose upon the third day
[20:18] [Music]
[20:24] heaven.
[20:29] I want
[20:32] [Music]
[20:35] I
[20:39] [Music]
[20:40] God is faithful.
[20:43] [Music]
[20:45] His promises is true.
[20:50] Oh my to the mountain.
[20:55] Oh my.
[21:01] Oh, and my God is bigger, better,
[21:06] stronger, greater than you.
[21:11] Oh, there's no mountain to high, no to.
[21:17] There's no
[21:20] [Applause]
[21:22] there's no problem to me. There's no
[21:26] weapon to there.
[21:30] That's impossible.
[21:33] Oh, there's no mountain to
[21:37] just
[21:44] there's no problem to me. There's no
[21:47] weapon to show. There is nothing for
[21:52] that's impossible.
[21:56] [Music]
[21:58] Oh, I will see
[22:01] you.
[22:03] Oh, I love you.
[22:09] Oh, my God is faithful.
[22:14] His promises is true.
[22:19] Oh, I speak to the mountain.
[22:24] [Music]
[22:26] It's time to move.
[22:30] Oh, my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[22:36] greater than you.
[22:40] Hallelujah.
[22:41] I trust we can just have that kind of
[22:43] confidence tonight to know that our God
[22:45] is bigger, better, and stronger than
[22:48] anything that we can face. You know,
[22:50] often times is because we forget what
[22:52] who our God is and what he's able to do.
[22:56] I tell you, there's nothing that that
[22:58] can really move us in this world.
[23:00] Nothing that we can be. He's the creator
[23:02] of all things. I mean, he created the
[23:05] devil.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[23:07] He said, "I created the waster
[23:10] &gt;&gt; for the purpose of what he's doing."
[23:12] Whatever he is doing, God put the
[23:15] boundaries around what he can and cannot
[23:18] do.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a marvelous God we serve. Amen.
[23:22] Let's just bow our hearts and say a word
[23:24] of prayer. We want to remember Sister
[23:26] Lori. Uh she's not feeling well and want
[23:28] to just lift her up in prayer. But
[23:30] Thiago, I know they're moving and we
[23:32] certainly want to just add them to
[23:33] prayer. I know the the prayers for the
[23:35] other one. Our gracious Father, we just
[23:37] come before you once again,
[23:40] Lord, as your children. It's so good to
[23:42] be gathered in your presence, Father.
[23:44] This is the place where we come to get
[23:46] our cup refilled once again. And you
[23:48] said, "Forsake not the assembling of
[23:50] yourself, Lord. I believe each one is
[23:52] gathered here with the lick of fires,
[23:54] Lord. And perhaps not in the same
[23:56] measure, but I believe when we come
[23:58] together, Lord, we make the fullness of
[24:00] who you are." And I just pray tonight,
[24:02] Lord, as we gather here, Lord, may you
[24:05] just come and speak to us through your
[24:07] word. And Father, we want your word to
[24:09] be effective in our lives. And father,
[24:11] we live in a time where the true heart
[24:13] of a true believer, Lord, we just don't
[24:16] want to hear and and collect
[24:18] intellectual understanding, but Father,
[24:20] we want an effectual word and Lord, and
[24:23] something that can make us changes,
[24:26] Lord, and that we can walk out of here
[24:27] different people than the way we came
[24:29] in, Father, that can give us the
[24:31] strength, Lord, that when we walk and we
[24:34] meet against challenges, Father, that we
[24:36] may be not shaken and we may not be
[24:38] moved, but stand upon on the word and
[24:41] know that our God is real that he's
[24:42] going to come to fight for us. I just
[24:44] pray father as we be listening may you
[24:46] just come and open the ears of our
[24:48] understanding. Father may we gather even
[24:51] Lord that you may just speak us speak to
[24:54] us and give us revelation because that's
[24:56] what we need more above all things
[24:58] remember our pastor as it's been said
[25:00] and those that are not here we commit
[25:02] the remaining of the service into your
[25:04] hands and ask those things in the name
[25:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[25:09] Amen. God bless you. Amen. We'll be
[25:11] listening to a tape, let's open our
[25:13] scripture for the uh Bible for scripture
[25:15] reading. And uh just before we can get
[25:18] into that, um we'll read just a section.
[25:22] Exodus chapter 14. We'll read verse 13
[25:26] uh to 15. And uh this is what and and I
[25:31] just want to say I've I I I've been I
[25:35] believe for the last two weeks just um
[25:38] meditating on this tape and just
[25:40] listening over and over and it's just
[25:42] something it struck me very different
[25:44] when our pastor read it last Sunday. It
[25:46] just something just touched me a little
[25:48] differently when he read the scripture
[25:50] and I went and I was listening. It just
[25:53] created such a sense of urgency within
[25:55] my own heart. And I I I just hope that
[25:58] we can capture that tonight. So the
[26:00] scripture says, "And Moses said unto the
[26:02] people, fear ye not, stand still and see
[26:06] the salvation of the Lord, which he will
[26:09] show to you today. For the Egyptian who
[26:12] ye have seen today, ye shall see you
[26:17] shall see them no more.
[26:19] Uh, ye shall see them again no more
[26:22] forever. It says, "The Lord shall fight
[26:26] for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
[26:30] And the Lord said unto Moses, wherefore
[26:33] crith out unto me, speak unto the
[26:36] children of Israel that they go
[26:38] forward." You may have your seats. Um,
[26:42] maybe I'll save my comments for the end.
[26:45] Uh but just to say um
[26:49] it's such a an interesting I was telling
[26:52] brother Matthew fellowshipping in the
[26:54] back and and I just said the portion
[26:58] that that that that here there's a
[27:00] there's a whole section that that that
[27:02] that's not in here in what we're going
[27:04] to listen to. Um, brother Brham is
[27:08] basically just laying out uh the very
[27:11] understanding and if I was to give it a
[27:14] title I want to call it elected,
[27:19] called and commissioned.
[27:22] Elected, called and commissioned.
[27:26] The the nothing happens by chance. Our
[27:29] gathering here is not in chance.
[27:31] And as the people of God, we have to
[27:34] understand one thing that when God
[27:36] starts a work, he has to finish it.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; And and the election of God is not a
[27:43] happen chance where he just goes and
[27:45] picks and said, "Well, I will elect this
[27:47] ones and then I'll see what happens to
[27:49] them." We we can even understand through
[27:52] the message that even the very
[27:54] characteristics of a person are chosen
[27:56] by God. how they can speak, how they can
[28:00] everything about them is chosen by God.
[28:03] And it's chosen because God has a work
[28:05] for them. And if God has a work for
[28:07] them, the prophet told us that God has a
[28:09] work for all his children. And your work
[28:12] cannot be done by another person. So
[28:14] when God chooses you to finish a work,
[28:17] you're going to finish that work.
[28:18] Whether you think you're incapable,
[28:20] you're not called, you you whatever
[28:23] excuses you can come up with, it's never
[28:25] going to stop God from fulfilling the
[28:28] work that he wants to do through you. So
[28:31] all of our excuses, all of the things
[28:34] that we bring on the surface on the
[28:36] reason why we cannot do the work, all of
[28:39] them points to one thing and that's the
[28:41] human side of us.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; And that's okay. We we we we we as
[28:45] humans, it's important when we look, we
[28:48] understand that there's nothing good in
[28:49] the flesh. But it's also important we
[28:52] understand that God, it's by
[28:54] predestination that these things are
[28:56] done. It's not by understanding. It's
[28:59] not by education we go, we educate
[29:02] ourselves, then we come to it. And I
[29:04] just want to say this, especially at
[29:07] this end time, Bar makes a statement in
[29:09] here. It says that not in the section
[29:11] we're going to listen to but the
[29:13] previous section. It says Moses was born
[29:15] with the equipment in him.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Now I I love the prophet because every
[29:22] time he says something I know it's
[29:24] applicable to everybody
[29:26] &gt;&gt; because if God does one thing one way he
[29:29] continue to do the same. So it's not a
[29:31] mystery. He said Moses was born with the
[29:34] equipment inside of him. So, he was born
[29:37] to be a deliverer. Whether he wanted it
[29:39] or not, God ordained that person to be a
[29:43] deliverer.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; God ordained you to be a member of a
[29:47] bride.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; That's just how it is. He You didn't
[29:50] choose religion. You didn't choose God.
[29:53] However you thought you came to the
[29:55] understanding of the message, it was the
[29:58] election of God that brought you in
[30:00] here. So it was important that for
[30:02] Moses, God was really trying to get to
[30:05] Moses to understand even though
[30:08] intellectually he understood that said
[30:11] that he had to come in contact with the
[30:13] pillar of fire that actually caused him
[30:16] to come into the reality of what he was
[30:19] really called. He tried to do it
[30:21] intellectually. He failed. He tried to
[30:24] do it because that's what the parents
[30:26] told him, the sibling told him and
[30:28] everything. He failed. But when he came
[30:31] in contact with the pillar of fire
[30:33] himself, he came into the realization of
[30:37] the great work that he was supposed to
[30:39] do.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; And it's no different from us. We don't
[30:44] want to come through this with
[30:45] intellectual understanding because
[30:47] intellectual understanding will not take
[30:49] us far. Intellectual understanding it's
[30:52] good for debate and discussion but
[30:55] intellectual understanding is not going
[30:57] to overcome for you. What we need is to
[31:00] come in contact with the one who made
[31:03] the promise.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; And the way he makes his promise true is
[31:08] for him himself to come in contact with
[31:10] you and convince you from the heart. Not
[31:14] from the intellectual understanding but
[31:16] from the heart. Your conversion is a
[31:19] change from the heart. Is the Holy
[31:21] Spirit confirming the scriptures that
[31:23] you read. You were in sin. You were in
[31:26] trespass. you were in the world and
[31:28] everything something knocked into your
[31:30] heart. Who was it? It was God calling
[31:32] you to the understanding of your
[31:35] election.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; And so it's important we when when we
[31:39] come to our calling, we have to
[31:41] understand that the calling is directly
[31:43] connected to the election that was made.
[31:46] And we need to know also and I'm trying
[31:48] to summarize this so I can play this.
[31:50] It's it's very important to understand
[31:53] you God cannot elect you and call you.
[31:56] So you can just sit around.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; So there's a work to do. There's a
[32:01] commission that's attached to that. And
[32:04] we can only come to the commission if we
[32:06] understand we are elected and we are
[32:09] commissioned.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; We are elected, we are called to be the
[32:14] bride of this age. As long as you're
[32:16] still struggling, am I really called? Am
[32:19] I really a believer? Or am I really
[32:21] saved? The devil is got you exactly
[32:24] where he wants you to be.
[32:27] He's got you exactly where he wants you
[32:30] to be. Because as long as you still
[32:32] trying to figure those things out, you
[32:34] will never move to a place where you
[32:37] will actually do the commission. You
[32:39] will always the moment you take a step,
[32:41] he reminds you of your past. He reminds
[32:43] you of everything. And let me say this,
[32:45] that's why I like the revelation in this
[32:47] end time. When brother Brham comes and
[32:49] he's talking about the elected in the
[32:52] end time, he has nothing to do with your
[32:55] flesh, your parents, where you were
[32:57] born, how you came into the world. You
[33:00] are directly connected to God.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand this is
[33:06] not the same revelation that the church
[33:08] began with.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; They thought we were sinners saved by
[33:11] grace. God gave his blood. Oh, I'm saved
[33:15] and and I need to move to justification
[33:17] and I need to move to sanctification.
[33:19] I'm a sinner. It was always looking
[33:22] towards man. But the days of man are
[33:25] over.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; They there had to be a change from a man
[33:29] to God because human leadership has an
[33:32] ending. But God's leadership is eternal.
[33:36] So that's why when you are born again,
[33:39] you are not says it's not the old person
[33:41] twisted up and God trying to fix them
[33:43] up. It's a whole brand new creation.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; A new creation from the beginning from
[33:49] the mind of God that he had planned
[33:51] since the beginning to bring into
[33:53] action.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; It's just the way you came. It was
[33:56] because of sin.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; But God still knew where he was going to
[34:01] bring that seed to come into
[34:03] manifestation within this flesh. That's
[34:05] right.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; That's why in this same time we can look
[34:08] I said but says you are not your flesh.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; You are the seed that God placed in you
[34:14] since the beginning of the world.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Now let me stop right there.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; So so so paragraph 193. So now God is
[34:25] really everything I just talked about is
[34:28] the summary of the first part. I I
[34:30] couldn't even do justice. Right. So so
[34:33] that's the first portion. Now this is
[34:35] the second portion and and I'll say this
[34:38] it breaks my own heart my heart because
[34:42] I'm beginning even to realize where we
[34:45] as a people of God are really failing
[34:49] &gt;&gt; is the lack of understanding that
[34:51] everything has been prepared for us
[34:54] &gt;&gt; that God just wants us to walk in it
[34:57] with confidence with assurance. He
[35:00] doesn't want us to just be spiritual
[35:02] babes. That was Pentecost. We are to be
[35:05] mature Christians. Those that know that
[35:08] they've been elected. That's how you
[35:10] become effective.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; It's not in just being a babe. Oh,
[35:14] something happened. Oh, I must have done
[35:15] wrong. God must have hated me. Oh, I
[35:18] must have done this. I'm paying for
[35:19] this. It's over.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; If it paid for it, he paid for it.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I'll pay for it and then
[35:26] you'll pay a part of it for it." Let me
[35:28] say this. If we were to pay even 1% of
[35:32] what we're done, then Christ died in
[35:33] vain.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; 193. Let's just start from there.
[35:49] Now we find Moses here after now we find
[35:53] Moses here after God had done so much
[35:56] for him and has showed him so many signs
[35:59] and wonders. Now for the next 15
[36:01] minutes, let's lay this down here. Watch
[36:03] real close.
[36:07] Moses come to this spot where he God had
[36:11] said, "I'm with you. Your words is my
[36:14] words. I proved it to you, Moses. You
[36:17] there were no flies in the land is out
[36:20] of season.
[36:21] And you said, "Let there come flies."
[36:23] And there come flies. That's creation.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Who can blame darkness over the earth
[36:29] but God?
[36:31] &gt;&gt; You said, "Let there be darkness." And
[36:32] there was darkness.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; You said, "Let there be frogs." And the
[36:36] frogs even got in Pharaoh's house in the
[36:38] beds and when they piled them up and
[36:40] great heaps.
[36:42] creator and I have spoke to you Moses
[36:46] and and made my word create through your
[36:48] lips.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; I made you actually a god before
[36:51] Pharaoh.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I've done all this and here
[36:55] they come to a place of little trial
[36:57] come up and Moses begin to cry, what
[36:59] shall I do?
[37:01] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this is a great
[37:04] lesson here now. I I love this.
[37:06] See Moses if we read here right that mo
[37:08] when the children begin to get scared
[37:09] they seeen Pharaoh coming in the line of
[37:11] duty God have performed everything
[37:13] perfectly now he started them on the
[37:15] journey he's got the church together
[37:17] they've been called out they come from
[37:18] every denomination they all got together
[37:21] Moses went back there and said Lord what
[37:23] must I do he said well go do this all
[37:25] right go ahead now Moses you know I've
[37:27] called you to do this yes Lord all right
[37:29] you go speak this'll be here come the
[37:31] flies speak for this here it comes do
[37:33] this here it come everything was thus
[37:35] Sayith the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord.
[37:36] Thus sayeth the Lord. Now it gets into a
[37:38] trouble and God said now I've got them
[37:39] started on their journey. They're all
[37:41] done called out. The church is together.
[37:43] So I've got him on the journey. Now
[37:44] Moses, take them on over. I told you I'm
[37:46] going to sit down and rest a while.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Moses said, "Oh Lord, look coming here.
[37:50] Here comes Pharaoh. The people are all
[37:52] What must I do? What must I do?"
[37:56] See there? Isn't that just human being?
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Begin to cry. What must I do? Here we
[38:02] see Moses expressingly fully human
[38:06] nature.
[38:08] Always wants God to get behind you and
[38:10] push you into something. Now that's us
[38:12] today.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; You want God after we've seen all we've
[38:15] seen, yet you want God to push you to do
[38:17] something. See, Moses had just laxed
[38:20] around said, "God, I'll go ask you to
[38:21] see what you say." Yeah. Yeah. You say,
[38:22] "All right, I'll say it, too." See, but
[38:24] here God had ordained him for the job,
[38:27] proved that he was with him, and here he
[38:29] is. circumstance comes up and then he
[38:31] begins crying what can I do Lord what
[38:34] can I do now you remember he had already
[38:36] prophesied here for he said these
[38:38] Egyptians
[38:40] you see today you'll seen no more and
[38:42] then immediately began to cry out God
[38:44] what can we do
[38:46] he done done a pretty good job in
[38:47] prophesying there see done told him what
[38:49] would happen if the word of God was in
[38:51] him it was in him
[38:52] &gt;&gt; and when he was telling that it actually
[38:54] come to pass what he said was already
[38:56] going to come to pass and here he was
[38:58] crying out what are we going to do
[38:59] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, if that isn't human beings,
[39:02] &gt;&gt; if that isn't me,
[39:04] &gt;&gt; if that isn't me,
[39:07] &gt;&gt; it already prove what you say will
[39:09] happen.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; I'm with you. And you're a circumstance
[39:14] rose in a moment. What must I do? What
[39:17] must I do, Lord? Hey, Lord, where are
[39:19] you at? Hey, do you hear me? What must I
[39:21] do? And they had already ordained him
[39:24] and had vindicated him and proved and
[39:26] worked everything through. And he hear
[39:27] God. Oh my. Fully expressive.
[39:32] Man wants to rest and let God do the
[39:35] pushing. And yet he knew that God had
[39:39] anointed him for this job to do this.
[39:41] And God had clearly vindicated his
[39:44] claims.
[39:46] It was time for the people to be
[39:47] delivered.
[39:49] God through his miracles and wonders had
[39:50] brought them all together in one group.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Brought them all together in one group.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. vindicate his claims. Scripture
[39:59] said so. Here was a sign. Here was the
[40:01] evidence. Here everything that he said.
[40:02] Then he come among as a prophet.
[40:04] Whatever he said, God honored it.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Even to create and bring up flies and to
[40:08] put things in existence and everything
[40:10] that he had promised him here, he done
[40:11] it.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; But he wanted to wait on thus sayeth the
[40:17] Lord.
[40:19] See, he should have known that the very
[40:22] vindication of his call was thus sayeth
[40:25] the Lord. Amen.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; His job that he was ordained to was thus
[40:29] sayeth the Lord.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Can you get it?
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Why did he wait on thus sayeth the Lord?
[40:40] He wanted, Lord, what can I do here? I
[40:42] brought these children out this far.
[40:43] Here's the circumstance. Pharaoh's
[40:45] coming. They're all going to die. What
[40:47] must I do? What must I do?
[40:51] &gt;&gt; He had already predicted what he was
[40:53] going to do. He had already told just
[40:55] exactly what you were doing. He
[40:57] predicted the end of the very nation he
[40:59] was brought up in.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Moses already said, "You'll not see him
[41:08] anymore.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; God's going to destroy him."
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; They made fun of you long enough.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; God will destroy him. It already
[41:15] predicted what would happen to him. Then
[41:17] Lord, what must I do?
[41:18] &gt;&gt; See the human nature there?
[41:21] &gt;&gt; What must I do? I'm going to wait for
[41:22] thus sayith the Lord. Yes sir. I'll see
[41:24] what the Lord says and I'll do it.
[41:27] Remember
[41:29] there was a Pharaoh had raised up and
[41:31] didn't know Joseph you know in that time
[41:33] right at that time
[41:36] see and Moses stood right up and
[41:37] predicted the end of that nation
[41:39] &gt;&gt; and here he was right to the place where
[41:40] it was to be happen then he cries out
[41:42] what must I do Lord what must it do
[41:44] &gt;&gt; see isn't that human beings
[41:46] &gt;&gt; isn't that human nation what shall I do
[41:49] he was already prophesied God had
[41:51] honored everything he said and he was
[41:54] called for the job so why did he have to
[41:55] say what must do there was in need. Is
[41:58] this up to him to speak for it?
[42:01] &gt;&gt; God wanted Moses to put that gift of
[42:04] faith that he had given him to work.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; God had vindicated it. It was the truth.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; And God wanted Moses wanted the people
[42:13] to see that he was with Moses and he
[42:16] back there. He waited saying, "Now Lord,
[42:17] I'm just a baby. You tell me now."
[42:18] "Yeah, I'll go do this. I got thus
[42:20] sayith the Lord, brother. Is that thus
[42:22] sayith the Lord?" "Yes." Yes, brother
[42:23] Moses. That's thus sayith the Lord.
[42:24] Yeah. Okay, we got it now. Thus sayith
[42:26] the Lord and it happened. Never fail one
[42:28] time.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Never did fail.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; And here it is in the circumstances.
[42:33] Comes up again. Now he's got him on the
[42:35] journey. The church is already called
[42:37] out.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Got him on the journey and they're
[42:40] moving up. And Moses started crying out,
[42:43] Lord is thus sayith the Lord. What must
[42:46] I do? All right. God wanted Moses that
[42:50] faith that he had put in in that gift
[42:51] that he had clearly
[42:54] vindicated
[42:56] God had clearly proved to Moses and the
[42:59] people that it was him by the word and
[43:01] by the things that was said come to
[43:03] pass.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; It was clearly identified. There was no
[43:05] need of him worrying anymore about it.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; See, there's no more of him thinking
[43:09] anything about because it was already
[43:10] cleared up. He had already done these
[43:12] things. He had already proved by uh
[43:15] flies and fleas that he spoke things
[43:17] into creation
[43:19] &gt;&gt; that the word of God was in him.
[43:22] So here he is want to ask now what to do
[43:24] when the circumstances lays right before
[43:25] him. See, oh
[43:28] &gt;&gt; I hope this goes way down to us and we
[43:30] can see where we're at. See
[43:32] &gt;&gt; how it make you feel about that being
[43:35] &gt;&gt; thinking about Moses telling his false
[43:36] look at ours.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Here he was standing there. See, know
[43:40] that the scripture said that that was
[43:42] the hour and day for that to happen. and
[43:45] know that God had met him in a pillar of
[43:47] fire and it went right down before the
[43:49] people and performed these miracles and
[43:51] everything he said had come to pass even
[43:53] bringing things into creation
[43:55] &gt;&gt; doing the things that only God could do
[43:57] showing that his voice was God's voice
[44:00] and here was a circumstance with that
[44:01] people that he was raising up bringing
[44:03] on to the promised land and then was
[44:05] standing crying what must I do
[44:07] &gt;&gt; that's a human being won't as brother
[44:10] Roy Slaughter I believe he's sitting
[44:12] outside the door there told me one time
[44:13] about somebody doing something to me and
[44:15] I said, "Well, I did this and now is
[44:17] that." He said, "Brother Brandham, let
[44:18] him lean on your shoulder today and
[44:19] tomorrow you pack them." And that's just
[44:21] the way human beings is. Lean on your
[44:23] shoulder today and tomorrow you pack
[44:24] them. That's that's what Moses is doing.
[44:27] God had to pack him long after he had
[44:29] ordained him and proved it to do it.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; And the people already said, "Moses, say
[44:34] the word."
[44:36] &gt;&gt; I seen you do it there. God honored you
[44:38] there. You're the same one today. Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Do it.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; He ought to have known it, but he
[44:45] didn't. All right. Just as it was then,
[44:49] so is it now. We find out that So he
[44:53] said, "Mo, God must just got enough of
[44:55] it."
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; God must got fed up on it.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why are you crying to me
[45:01] about?
[45:02] Haven't I already proved my
[45:04] identification?
[45:06] Haven't I told you that I sent you for
[45:08] the job? Didn't I tell you to go do
[45:11] this? Didn't I promise that I'd do this?
[45:13] I'd be with your mouth and I'd speak
[45:16] through you and I'd do this and you'd
[45:17] show signs and wonders. Didn't I promise
[45:19] to do it? Have not I did just exactly
[45:22] destroy every enemy from around you? And
[45:25] here you are standing out here now at
[45:26] the Red Sea right in the line of duty
[45:28] what I told you to do and then still
[45:30] hollering and crying to me.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Don't you believe me? Can't you see that
[45:35] I sent you to do this? Oh, that isn't
[45:37] human being. So he just must got pretty
[45:40] well fed up on it. And he said, um, you
[45:43] know, you have need of it. You know, if
[45:46] you go take these children over to that
[45:47] promised land, that's exactly you're
[45:49] pinned up here in the corner. There
[45:50] ain't nothing else you can do. So
[45:52] there's a need. What are you crying to
[45:54] me about?
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; What you looking at me for? What you
[46:03] calling on me about? Haven't I approved
[46:05] it to the people? Haven't I approved it
[46:06] to you? Haven't I called it? Isn't it
[46:08] scriptural? Didn't I promise to take
[46:10] this people to that land?
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Didn't I call you and tell you I would
[46:14] do it? Didn't I call and say I'd sent
[46:16] you to do it and it wasn't you, it was
[46:17] me and I go down and I be with your lips
[46:19] and whatever you said I I'd vindicate it
[46:21] and prove it to haven't I done it.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Then when any little thing comes up way
[46:25] act like a baby or be a man, speak to
[46:28] the people.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Then move forward. Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; There you are. Don't cry. Speak. Amen.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; What are you crying to me about?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Just speak to the people and go forward
[46:44] to your objective.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Whatever it, if it's sickness or
[46:48] whatever it is to raise the dead or
[46:49] whatever it is, speak.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; I proved it. Speak to the people. What a
[46:55] lesson. What a lesson.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[47:00] At this stage of the journey where we're
[47:02] standing,
[47:03] &gt;&gt; look where we're at now.
[47:05] Yes, sir. At the third pull.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Notice we're right here at the door
[47:17] &gt;&gt; of the coming of the Lord.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; He was anointed for the job and still
[47:21] waiting for thus sayeth the Lord.
[47:24] God must just got enough of it. He said,
[47:26] "Don't cry anymore. Speak. I sent you."
[47:30] Oh, God.
[47:33] What? This church ought to be this
[47:35] morning.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; God's perfect of vindication. But the
[47:39] pillar of fire and the signs and the
[47:41] wonders, everything just like it was in
[47:42] the days of Sodom. He said it would
[47:44] return back. Here's the world in his
[47:45] condition. There's a nation in his
[47:47] condition. There's a women in the
[47:48] condition. There's a man in the
[47:49] condition. There's a church in the
[47:51] condition. There's everything the
[47:52] elements signs flying saucers and
[47:55] everything in the skies and all kind of
[47:56] mysterious things. And the sea of roar
[47:58] and tidal waves man's heart failing.
[48:00] Fear perplexed the time distress between
[48:01] nations. the church falling away and a
[48:04] man of sin rising up who oppose himself
[48:06] above all is called God. He that sth in
[48:07] the temple of God showing himself a whom
[48:09] oh my and it's come to this nation and
[48:12] the church is organized and all of them
[48:14] gathered together as harlots to the
[48:15] and everything exactly in the way
[48:18] whoredom. hoard them. What is it telling
[48:20] women they can cut their hair? Telling
[48:21] women they can wear a shorts. Tell men
[48:23] if they can do this and they can do that
[48:24] and preachers they do this in a social
[48:26] gospel and things. Don't you see it's
[48:28] committing adultery with the true word
[48:30] of God. And God has sent us his true
[48:33] word undenominational no strings tied to
[48:36] it. And give us a pillar of fire. The
[48:38] Holy Ghost has been with us now for 30
[48:40] years. And everything that he's
[48:42] predicted and said come to pass exactly.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Speak to the people and
[48:48] let's go forward.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got an objective. That's glory.
[48:52] Let's move to it. We're headed to the
[48:54] promised land.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that
[48:58] believe.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Speak to the people. Haven't I proved
[49:00] it? Haven't I even had my picture made
[49:02] among you and everything else and done
[49:04] everything that could be done to prove
[49:05] that I'm with you? Doesn't the magazine
[49:07] just a few weeks ago packed the article
[49:09] when you said here at the pull pit what
[49:11] would take place out here three months
[49:13] beforehands and there it went taking
[49:14] place and vindicated. Even the science
[49:16] knows about it. And everything that I've
[49:18] done and you're still waiting.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Speak to the people and go forward to
[49:24] your objective. Amen.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Didn't Nathan tell David, Nathan the
[49:30] prophet one time said he seeing David
[49:32] the anointed king, he said, "Do all
[49:34] that's in your heart for God is with
[49:37] you."
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Told David, "Do all that's in your
[49:42] heart. God's with you." Joshua was
[49:45] anointed to take the land for God and
[49:48] for his people. The day was short. He
[49:52] needed more time for the job that he was
[49:54] anointed and commissioned to do.
[49:58] Joshua, a man, he was anointed. God told
[50:02] him, "As I was with Moses, I'll be with
[50:04] you."
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That land, I'm going to give it to
[50:08] him.
[50:09] I want you to go over there and clean
[50:11] out the Amalachites and and the he all
[50:15] all the others, the Philistines and and
[50:17] the Persites and all the different ones.
[50:20] Clean them out. I'm with you. I no man
[50:23] will stand before you all the days of
[50:25] your life.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; No man can bother you. Go on in there.
[50:30] And Joshua draw that sword and said,
[50:31] "Follow me." And he got over there and
[50:33] here was fighting. And what was it? He
[50:36] routed the enemy. There were little
[50:37] bunches here and little bunches there.
[50:39] When night time come, they'd all get
[50:41] together and garrison together and come
[50:42] with a big force against him. And the
[50:44] sun was going down. He needed more
[50:46] light.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; The sun was going down. He didn't fall
[50:50] on his knees and said, "Lord God, what
[50:52] shall I do? What shall I do?" He spoke.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; He had a need. He said, "Son, stand
[50:58] still."
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; He didn't cry to nothing. He commanded.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Son, stand still. I've got a need of
[51:07] this. I'm the servant of the Lord
[51:09] anointed for this job. I've got a need.
[51:12] Stand still and don't you shine and moon
[51:14] you hang where you're at.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; So he fought the battle through and
[51:18] whipped the whole thing on
[51:20] &gt;&gt; and the sun obeyed him.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; No crying out.
[51:25] He spoke to the son said, "You stand
[51:28] still.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Son, hang there and moon. You stay where
[51:32] you're at."
[51:34] He didn't cry out, "Lord, now what can I
[51:35] do? Give me some more sunlight." He had
[51:38] needed sunlight, so he commanded it. And
[51:40] the sun obeyed him. Oh my.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; He commanded the sun to stand still.
[51:46] Samson, anointed, raised up, ordained of
[51:50] God, given a gift of power, was ordained
[51:53] to destroy the nation of the
[51:55] Philistines.
[51:58] ordained, born on the earth, anointed of
[52:02] God to destroy the Philistines. And one
[52:05] day they caught him out in the field
[52:07] without his sword, without a spear, and
[52:10] a thousand of those armored Philistines
[52:12] run upon him at one time. Did he get out
[52:14] and say, "Oh Lord, I'm wait for a
[52:16] vision. Oh Lord, what must I do? Direct
[52:19] me now what to do." He know he had a
[52:22] need. He found nothing but an old
[52:23] jawbone of a mule and he beat down a
[52:25] thousand Philistines.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He never cried to God.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; He used his anointed gift.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; He know that he was sent for the job.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; He know he was born for that. He know he
[52:39] was anointed with a gift.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Then he beat down a thousand
[52:43] Philistines. He didn't cry to God. God
[52:45] ordained him and vindicated that he was
[52:48] by other things that he had done. And he
[52:49] was a vindicated, anointed servant of
[52:52] God to destroy the Philistines. And he
[52:54] did it.
[52:55] No matter what the circumstances was, he
[52:57] did it.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; He'd never asked nothing. That was his
[53:00] job. That God was dealing to pick up
[53:02] that mule bone and go to beating
[53:04] Philistines.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; How the while one lick with that thing
[53:07] across one of them inch and a half brass
[53:09] skulls like that would have shattered
[53:11] that bone into a million pieces. And he
[53:13] beat a thousand of them down and killed
[53:14] him and still stood with it in his hand.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask no questions. He didn't
[53:18] cry out. He spoke.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; He routed them.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Take the Philistine. Can I take
[53:26] the Philistines, Lord? I I know you sent
[53:28] me to do it, Lord. Yes, Lord. I know you
[53:30] sent me to destroy this nation of the
[53:32] Philistines. Now, here's thousands of
[53:34] them around me, and I ain't got nothing.
[53:35] What What am I going to do now, Lord? Oh
[53:37] my. Nothing's going to bother me.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; He's anointed for the work.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; There's nothing can harm you.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; No, not one thing.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; He just took what he had and beat into
[53:52] him. That's right.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. when the enemy fenced him in and
[53:55] said, "Now we get him in the walls. We
[53:57] got him now. We got him on the inside
[53:59] here with with this woman now. We got
[54:01] the good door shut all around everywhere
[54:03] and he can't get out. We got him."
[54:05] Samson cried, "Oh Lord, they got me all
[54:07] fenced in with this denomination.
[54:10] What am I going to do? I've joined up
[54:11] with it. What am I going to do?" He
[54:13] never did that. He just walked out and
[54:15] pulled down the gate on his shoulder and
[54:17] walked away with it.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; He was anointed for the job.
[54:23] is called of God. Didn't fence him in.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; No, indeed he tucked the gates with him.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't pray about it. He didn't ask
[54:32] God whether to do it or not. It was
[54:34] right in the line of duty.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Right in the line of
[54:38] duty. Why cry to me? Speak and go on.
[54:41] Amen. Don't cry. Speak. You're done.
[54:44] Quit whining and whimpering now or be
[54:46] old enough to speak. That's right. He
[54:49] knew his anointed gift of power could
[54:51] destroy any Philistine who stood before
[54:53] him.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; But we don't know that. You see,
[54:59] &gt;&gt; we're still little babies and with a
[55:01] bottle in our mouth and
[55:04] he knew it.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; We know that God raised him up for that
[55:08] purpose.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; And there was nothing going to stand
[55:11] before him all the days of his life.
[55:13] Nothing could destroy him. He was raised
[55:14] for that purpose like Moses was. Nothing
[55:17] going to stop him. No Amalachites or
[55:19] nothing else can stop him. He's on the
[55:20] road to the promised land.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Samson knew he was on the road. Joshua
[55:27] know he was taking the land. He was a
[55:30] vindicated. God's word promised it and
[55:32] the Holy Ghost was there vindicating it.
[55:34] He was on his road. So there nothing
[55:35] going to stand in his way. No sir. Right
[55:38] in the line of duty with God, there was
[55:40] nothing going to stand in his way. So he
[55:41] just picked up the gates and put them on
[55:42] his shoulder, weighed about four or five
[55:43] tons and walked up on top of the hill
[55:44] and sat down on them. nothing going to
[55:46] stand his way. He had an anointed gift
[55:48] from God. He didn't have cry, "Lord,
[55:51] what must I do now? He's already
[55:52] anointed to do it." That was thus
[55:54] sayaith the Lord. Get rid of him.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Get rid of them.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; I raise you up for that purpose. Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; What must I do, Lord? Okay. What am I
[56:06] going to do here at the Red Sea? Didn't
[56:07] I tell you that I give you a mountain
[56:09] for Sinai here? You're coming back to
[56:11] that mountain and you're going to take
[56:13] these children to the land. Didn't I
[56:15] call you for that purpose? Why are you
[56:17] worried about anything else standing
[56:18] awake? Speak and start moving.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; God.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; I called you for this purpose.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; David,
[56:28] he knew he was anointed and was a
[56:30] vindicated to be a good shot.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; He know. They know he was a good shot.
[56:35] David was anointed. He knew it. And when
[56:37] he stood before Goliath, he never cried,
[56:40] "Oh God, what must I do now?
[56:44] But but Messiah, I I know what you did
[56:46] in times past. You you you let me kill a
[56:49] bear and you let me kill a lion. But
[56:51] what about this Goliath out here?
[56:54] &gt;&gt; He never did that. He just spoke. What
[56:56] did he say? You will be like they were.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; He spoke and went forward.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; He never prayed a prayer. He never
[57:03] offered nothing. He know he was
[57:05] anointed. Amen. His anointed in that
[57:08] slingshot had proved the right kind of a
[57:10] thing. He had faith in his anointing. He
[57:13] had faith that God could direct that
[57:14] rock right straight in the middle of
[57:16] that helmet there with all the face
[57:17] could be hit. He stand there. He knowed
[57:19] he was a good shot. Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; He knowed God made him that. Amen.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; He know he'd killed a lion. He know he
[57:26] killed a bear. But that was with his
[57:28] earthly father's possession. Here's his
[57:30] heavenly father's possession.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't get unless what was to
[57:34] do now, Lord? He spoke and said, "You
[57:38] will be like the lion and the bear."
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He spoke and went forward to
[57:46] meet this Goliath.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, man. Regardless of his size, he's a
[57:51] little ruddy looking fellow. You know,
[57:52] he wasn't very big. He wasn't very
[57:53] handsome to look at. Little bitty draw
[57:56] up sort of a fella. The Bible said he
[57:58] was ruddy. Now, regardless of his size
[58:02] and his so-called ability to do so, you
[58:05] know, the the bishop told him said, "Now
[58:07] look here, son. That man's a theologian.
[58:11] See, he is a fighter. He was born a
[58:14] fighter. And he's a he's been a fighter
[58:17] from his youth. And you're no match for
[58:19] him. And his brother said, "Oh, you
[58:20] naughty thing. Come out here to do such
[58:22] a thing as that. Get on back home." That
[58:24] didn't bother him.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Why? He knew he was anointed.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; The God that delivered me from that
[58:32] line.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; The God that delivered me from the paws
[58:35] of that bear. He'll more than that
[58:37] deliver me from that Philistine. Here I
[58:38] come. I meet you in the name of the
[58:40] Lord, God of Israel. Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Didn't pray through. He's already prayed
[58:45] through. God prayed it through before
[58:47] the foundation of the world.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; He was anointed for the job. He had to
[58:50] speak and go forward.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; That's all there was to do about it.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Just speak and go forward. Oh, that's
[58:57] all there was to it. Oh, he didn't about
[59:01] his denominational brothers. Them
[59:02] scoffers stand there too, you know. Oh,
[59:04] yes. They were standing there saying
[59:06] scoffing and making fun and saying his
[59:08] brothers, you know, and said, "Oh, you
[59:10] can't you you're just naughty." That
[59:12] didn't move him a bit.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; You want to be different from somebody
[59:15] else. You just want to show off. If that
[59:17] been showing off, it had been so. But
[59:19] they only looked at the intellectual
[59:20] side. David know the anointing oil was
[59:22] on him.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Make difference to him. He said that
[59:25] Philistine will be like the barren lion.
[59:26] So here I come. He predicted it before
[59:29] it happened.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; What did he do? He killed the bear. He
[59:32] killed the lion. He knocked the lion
[59:34] down with what? With with the uh with a
[59:37] slingshot and tuck a knife and then the
[59:40] bear lion. He killed the lion with a
[59:42] knife. That's the same thing he done
[59:43] Goliath. He knocked him down with a rock
[59:46] and pulled up his sword and cut his own
[59:48] head off right there before. What did he
[59:50] predict before it happens? And you will
[59:51] be as they are.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Why? He spoke the word that it would be
[59:55] and then went forward to make it be
[59:58] fulfilled.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amenise the Lord. Oh brethren, he spake
[1:00:03] and tuck over the situation that day. If
[1:00:05] there ever was a time that man should
[1:00:07] speak, it's now.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Closing just the next few minutes. If
[1:00:11] you can just bear a few minutes longer.
[1:00:13] I got some more things wrote down here.
[1:00:14] Some scriptures I want to get to.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Peter never cried when he found a man
[1:00:20] that had faith enough to be healed
[1:00:23] laying at the gate called beautiful. He
[1:00:25] never got down and had an all night's
[1:00:27] prayer and or all days prayer, a big
[1:00:29] long prayer, and said, "Uh, Lord, I pray
[1:00:33] you now that you'll help this poor lane
[1:00:35] man. I see that he's got faith. I know
[1:00:36] he's a believer, and I've asked him."
[1:00:39] And he I I I He said he had faith. He'd
[1:00:41] believe what I told him. I've told him
[1:00:43] about this about what you did. And I I
[1:00:45] just think now, Lord,
[1:00:47] you can you give me a thus sayith the
[1:00:49] Lord for him?
[1:00:51] No. He knew that he was anointed
[1:00:53] apostle. He knowed that Jesus Christ
[1:00:56] commissioned him, "Heal the sick, raise
[1:00:59] the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out
[1:01:01] devils. As freely as you receive, freely
[1:01:03] give." Praise the Lord.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Peter, go do that." He didn't
[1:01:06] have to pray through. He was
[1:01:07] commissioned.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; What did he say? He said, "In the name
[1:01:11] of Jesus Christ," he spoke the name of
[1:01:13] Jesus Christ. And the man just laid
[1:01:15] there, he picked him up by the hand and
[1:01:16] said, "Stand up on your feet." Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; And he held him there until his ankle
[1:01:19] bones got strength and he started
[1:01:21] walking. Why? He never had an all
[1:01:23] night's prayer meeting.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; He never cried out to God. He knew
[1:01:27] positively from the lips of Jesus
[1:01:29] Christ. He was anointed for this work.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; He spake and raised him up for he know
[1:01:36] he was anointed apostle for the purpose.
[1:01:38] The people that laid in his shadow never
[1:01:41] said, "Oh, come Apostle Peter and cry
[1:01:44] over us and pray the prayer of faith for
[1:01:46] us to God."
[1:01:49] No, no, they never said that. They knew
[1:01:52] he was anointed and a vindicated apostle
[1:01:56] of God. So they said, "Just let us lay
[1:01:58] in his shadow.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; You don't have to say a word.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; We know it. We believe it. Life within
[1:02:05] them the apostle couldn't get to them
[1:02:07] all. And they themselves, they're part
[1:02:10] of it. Moses said, "Is there something
[1:02:12] me going or we're all going?"
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; And we all got something to do. We've
[1:02:16] all got to be anointed.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; And they seen that apostle stand there
[1:02:19] and seen him heal this sick man and do
[1:02:21] the things he did. They know he couldn't
[1:02:23] get to him. So they never said, "Peter,
[1:02:25] come and and offer prayer and wait now
[1:02:27] until he got thus sayith the Lord and
[1:02:28] come tell me." See what the Lord says.
[1:02:30] They said if we can only lay in his
[1:02:32] shadow because the very God that was in
[1:02:35] Jesus Christ is in him and we see the
[1:02:37] same thing doing. So they touched the
[1:02:39] border of Jesus garment and laid in his
[1:02:41] shadow and Jesus is in this man. If that
[1:02:43] shadow can reflect upon be healed and
[1:02:46] the Bible said every one of them is
[1:02:48] healed
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; only.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; No all night's prayer me said Lord if I
[1:02:51] go lay in the shadows of this apostle.
[1:02:54] No they knew it.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; The light has struck them. Their hearts
[1:02:57] was full. Their faith was let loose.
[1:02:59] Amen. They believed it. They'd seen it.
[1:03:02] Paul's hankies the same way. And I'm
[1:03:04] closing. Jesus never cried when they
[1:03:06] brought the maniac boy to him that had
[1:03:09] epilepsy falling into the fire. He never
[1:03:11] said, "Father,
[1:03:14] I'm your son and now you sent me here to
[1:03:17] do so and so and so. Can I heal this
[1:03:20] boy?" He never said. He said, "Come out
[1:03:23] of him, Satan."
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He spoke and the boy was
[1:03:28] made well.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; When he met Legion with 2,000 devils in
[1:03:34] him,
[1:03:35] it wasn't Jesus of crying. It was the
[1:03:39] devils are crying.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; If you're going to cast us out, oh my
[1:03:44] sufferers to go in that herd of swine,
[1:03:47] Jesus said, "Now, father, am I able to
[1:03:48] do this?" He said, "Come out of him."
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; And the devils took their flight. Sure,
[1:03:54] he knowed he was Messiah. At the grave
[1:03:57] of Lazarus, he'd been dead four days.
[1:04:00] They said, "If you would have been here,
[1:04:02] Lord, he would have not have died." He
[1:04:03] said, "I am the resurrection life."
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Now, were, when, or how
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; he that believeth in me, though he were
[1:04:11] dead, yet shall he live.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; He know who he was. He know what he was.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; He know that he was Emmanuel. He know he
[1:04:24] was a resurrection. He know he was life.
[1:04:26] He know that in him dwelt the fullness
[1:04:28] of the godhead bodily.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; We seen them little people there and he
[1:04:32] seen that what God had told him that to
[1:04:34] do and there he was. He went down there.
[1:04:36] He never said now wait I'll kneel down
[1:04:37] here all of you kneel down. Pray. He
[1:04:39] said you believe it I'm able to do this.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Boy. It wasn't him. It was them.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Lord I believe that you're the son
[1:04:50] of God that was to come into the world.
[1:04:51] Oh, mother is identified. Something's
[1:04:54] got to happen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Lazarus come forth. He spoke. And a dead
[1:04:58] man come forth. Not can I. He just
[1:05:01] spoke. And when the faith was met, the
[1:05:04] thing happened. He spake. He spoke and
[1:05:07] the blind saw. The lame walked. The deaf
[1:05:10] heard. Devil screamed and come out. The
[1:05:13] dead was raised up.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Everything. Why? He didn't pray through.
[1:05:18] He was anointed the Messiah.
[1:05:20] He was that Messiah. He knew he was. He
[1:05:24] knew his position. He know what he was
[1:05:26] sent to do. He know that the father had
[1:05:30] identified him to be the Messiah to the
[1:05:32] believer. And when he met that believer
[1:05:34] with faith, he just spoke the word.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Devil scattered.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Speak. Don't cry. Speak.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And he knew his God-given rights, but we
[1:05:48] don't.
[1:05:51] He knew what he was. We don't. Moses had
[1:05:55] forgot. Samson understood. Others
[1:05:58] understood. Joshua understood. Moses
[1:06:00] forgot. God had to call his attention to
[1:06:02] it. He said, "Why you crying to me? I
[1:06:05] sent you to do the job. Speak.
[1:06:08] Go on to your objective. I told you
[1:06:10] you'd come to this mountain. Take them
[1:06:13] children. Lead them all. Just speak. I
[1:06:14] don't care what's in your way. Move it
[1:06:15] out of the way. I gave you authority to
[1:06:17] do it. I spoke. You spoke flies and
[1:06:19] fleas and creation and things like that.
[1:06:21] Now, what are you hollering to me about?
[1:06:22] Why are you coming to me hollering these
[1:06:24] things? Just speaking. Watch it move.
[1:06:26] That's all. Oh my. Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love it. Here Jesus,
[1:06:30] everything that he said, he just spoke
[1:06:32] the word and it was so God properly had
[1:06:36] a vindicated him to be his son. This is
[1:06:38] my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[1:06:40] Hear ye him. Watch him. I like this. How
[1:06:43] bravely, how majestically he stood
[1:06:46] before his critics. Amen. He said,
[1:06:50] "Destroy this temple
[1:06:52] and I'll pray the Father and see what he
[1:06:54] does about it."
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Destroy this temple and I'll raise it up
[1:06:59] again.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Not I hope to. I'm going to try to. I
[1:07:03] will do it.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; While the scripture said so,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; the same scripture that said he'd raise
[1:07:08] up his body. Give us the authority, the
[1:07:11] power. Amen. In mine they shall cast out
[1:07:15] devils. They'll speak with new tongues.
[1:07:17] If they take up serpents or drink deadly
[1:07:18] things, they won't harm them. If they
[1:07:19] lay their hands on the sick, they shall
[1:07:21] recover.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Why cry unto me? Speak and go forward.
[1:07:27] Oh, bravely I destroy this temple. I'll
[1:07:31] raise it up again. Oh, and remember now
[1:07:34] we're closing. It was that same he.
[1:07:39] It was he that said in John 14:12,
[1:07:44] "The he that believeth on me, the works
[1:07:46] that I do shall he do also."
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; It was he that said so. It was Jesus in
[1:07:56] Mark 11:24 that said, "If you say to
[1:08:00] this mountain,
[1:08:02] now if you pray to this mountain, if you
[1:08:04] say to this mountain, be moved."
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; And don't doubt in your heart, but
[1:08:09] believe that what you've said will come
[1:08:11] to pass, you can have what you've said.
[1:08:13] Now, you if you say it is presumptional,
[1:08:14] it won't happen. But if something in you
[1:08:17] that's you're you're anointed for the
[1:08:19] job and will know that it's the will of
[1:08:21] God to do it and will say it, it's got
[1:08:23] to happen. Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; If ye, it was he that said this, if ye
[1:08:27] abide in me and my words abide in you,
[1:08:30] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:08:33] to you. Oh my. Oh my.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; You see what I mean?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Pardon this. It's just coming up in me.
[1:08:42] I got to say it.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; It was he that said that day up there on
[1:08:46] side of that woods, you have no gain.
[1:08:51] And he created three squirrels stand
[1:08:53] there before us.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; What is it? Just speaking the word. Say
[1:08:56] they'll be there and there and there and
[1:08:58] there they was. It
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; was he that did that.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Charlie, Rodney, it was he down there in
[1:09:04] Kentucky and Nelly and Margie and the
[1:09:06] rest of you. It was he, that same God
[1:09:08] that was back there and spoke to Moses
[1:09:10] said, "Why do you cry to me? Speak the
[1:09:13] word."
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; It was he that brought them into
[1:09:16] existence.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; It's he. It's him. Oh my. It was he that
[1:09:23] gave the vision about a year ago that
[1:09:26] said we would go over there and these
[1:09:27] seven seals and how there would be a a a
[1:09:30] great thunder that would started off and
[1:09:32] it' be in a shape of a pyramid in there.
[1:09:33] The look mag life magazines packed and
[1:09:35] hang on the wall in there. It was he
[1:09:37] that said that. It was he that night
[1:09:40] when I was going down that road and you
[1:09:42] see that big mumba snake about to get my
[1:09:44] brother and he said you've been given
[1:09:46] power to bind him or any of the rest of
[1:09:48] them. It was he that said that to my
[1:09:51] little gay-headed wife sitting back
[1:09:52] there. It was he that morning that woke
[1:09:54] me up there in a room to stand in the
[1:09:56] corner said, "Don't fear to do anything
[1:09:57] or go anywhere or say anything for the
[1:10:00] never failing presence of Jesus Christ
[1:10:02] is with you wherever you go."
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; It was he up Svenia Canyon about three
[1:10:09] months ago when I was praying wondering
[1:10:10] what was going to happen standing there
[1:10:12] and a sword dropped in my hand and said,
[1:10:13] "This is the king's sword."
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; It was he.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; It was he that said to me, "As I was
[1:10:20] with Moses, so I'll send you." It was he
[1:10:23] that said to me 30 years ago down on the
[1:10:26] river on earth.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; As a little boy stand there as a little
[1:10:29] preacher on the river 30 years ago,
[1:10:31] standing there when I light the same
[1:10:33] pillar of fire come down from the
[1:10:35] heavens and stood there and said, "As I
[1:10:38] sent John the Baptist to forun the first
[1:10:40] coming of Christ, your message shall
[1:10:42] forrun the second coming to all the
[1:10:44] world. How could it be when my own
[1:10:47] pastor laughed and made fun of it, but
[1:10:49] it happened just exactly that way? It
[1:10:52] was he that said it. Yes, sir.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Oh. Ah. It was he that said in prophecy
[1:11:00] to the vision, it shall come to pass. It
[1:11:02] was he that said, "If one among you
[1:11:04] prophesies or sees a vision and tells
[1:11:06] him it comes to pass, then remember it's
[1:11:08] not him. It's me. I am with him."
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What could I go on? say, "It's
[1:11:14] he, it's he, it's he, it's he that come
[1:11:16] down." When I told them that the pillar
[1:11:18] of fire was down there on the river, and
[1:11:19] they couldn't believe it. It was he down
[1:11:20] there amongst that Baptist preaching for
[1:11:22] 30,000 people that night in the San
[1:11:24] Houston Coliseum when that angel of the
[1:11:26] Lord had his picture taken standing
[1:11:28] there. It was he, the same yesterday,
[1:11:30] today, and forever. It was he that
[1:11:32] foretold where these things would be. It
[1:11:34] was he that said this. It was he that
[1:11:36] done these things. He's the same
[1:11:37] yesterday, today, and forever. He's done
[1:11:39] everything just exactly like he said he
[1:11:41] would do it. Amen. Why should I wait?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; God's a vindicated the word. It's the
[1:11:48] truth.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Let's journey. Let's walk. Let's go on
[1:11:52] the walk of the Lord.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Laying aside all doubts, all sins. Clean
[1:11:56] up the house. Scrub it up. As Junior
[1:11:59] Jackson's vision said, there was nothing
[1:12:00] left but lamps or his uh dream if he's
[1:12:03] sitting here. Nothing left but lamps.
[1:12:05] They had gold bands around them in the
[1:12:07] dream that he g me the other night. Oh
[1:12:09] my. Brother Collins, don't worry about
[1:12:12] that fish. It was white. You just didn't
[1:12:13] know how to handle it. Lay aside
[1:12:15] everything else contrary to it.
[1:12:16] Remember, this is truth regardless of
[1:12:18] how fanatically it seems and everything
[1:12:20] else sometimes. Move right on with it.
[1:12:22] It's the Holy Spirit, the same God that
[1:12:24] raised up Jesus Christ from the dead.
[1:12:27] The same one that can speak things into
[1:12:28] existence. The same one that lived in
[1:12:30] the days of Moses is the same today.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Is called in this last day. He's a
[1:12:35] vindicated as it was in the days of
[1:12:36] Sodom. So shall it be in the coming of
[1:12:38] the son of man. He's done. There's Sodom
[1:12:41] down there. There's a Billy Graham and
[1:12:42] an Or Roberts out there. And the church
[1:12:44] is moving on by the same signs that he
[1:12:46] promised both places. And there they
[1:12:48] are. It's he that said it. Oh Lord, give
[1:12:50] me courage is my prayer.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Help me, oh Lord God, I have to quit
[1:12:56] here. It's getting late.
[1:13:00] Why cry to me? Why are you crying to me
[1:13:03] when I've proved to be with you? Haven't
[1:13:05] I healed your sick? He'd say, "Haven't I
[1:13:08] told you things that happened just
[1:13:09] exactly?" Your pastor can't do that. Me,
[1:13:12] he can't. He's a man. It's me, the Lord.
[1:13:16] And he would say, "I'm the one that did
[1:13:17] this. I'm the one that tells him these
[1:13:19] things and say, "It's not him. It's my
[1:13:22] voice. I'm the one that raises up your
[1:13:24] dead when they drop down. I'm the one
[1:13:26] that heals the sick. I'm the one that
[1:13:28] foretells these things. I'm the one that
[1:13:30] does the saving. I'm the one that give
[1:13:32] the promise."
[1:13:33] God, give me courage to take that sword
[1:13:36] of the word that he put in my hands
[1:13:38] about 33 years ago and hold it and march
[1:13:40] forward to the third pull.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Is my prayer. Let's bow our head.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, the hour is growing
[1:13:48] late,
[1:13:50] but the word is getting precious
[1:13:53] as we see it. Lord, time after time,
[1:13:56] never failing presence of Christ always
[1:13:59] meets with us. How I thank you for your
[1:14:02] goodness. How you spared us and been and
[1:14:05] blessed us. How we thank you for it. As
[1:14:07] I hold these handkerchiefs in my hand,
[1:14:09] Lord, it's people that has faith that
[1:14:12] believes this. May every devil, every
[1:14:14] sickness depart from them people. And I
[1:14:17] charge every spirit in here that's foul
[1:14:20] and not of God. Every spirit of
[1:14:22] sickness, all diseases and afflictions.
[1:14:26] Hallelujah.
[1:14:27] We're not laying in the shadow of man,
[1:14:30] which would be all right, but we're in
[1:14:32] the shadow of the gospel, vindicated
[1:14:36] gospel,
[1:14:37] as the great pillar of fire moves back
[1:14:40] and forth through this building. The
[1:14:43] same one that God looked down through
[1:14:45] and the Red Sea give up its course and
[1:14:48] Israel passed through. But now, as he
[1:14:51] looks, it's sprinkled with the blood of
[1:14:52] his own son. with mercy and grace.
[1:14:57] May we be obedient. May we today quit
[1:15:00] saying, crying out. May we realize that
[1:15:04] you've called us for this work. This is
[1:15:06] the hour. I speak it in the name of
[1:15:09] Jesus Christ. Let every sickness depart
[1:15:11] from this place. May every man and woman
[1:15:14] that calls on the name of Jesus Christ
[1:15:16] consecrate their life a new today.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; I consecrate mine, Lord, upon the altar
[1:15:21] of prayer. I lay myself down and shame
[1:15:24] my own self and turn my head towards the
[1:15:27] ground from where you took me. Lord God,
[1:15:30] I'm ashamed of my weakness and my
[1:15:32] unbelief. Forgive it, Lord. Give me
[1:15:35] courage. Give us all courage. I feel
[1:15:37] like Moses. We are all on a road out. We
[1:15:40] don't want to leave one. We want to take
[1:15:42] every one, Lord. They're yours. I claim
[1:15:44] them for you. Bless this people today,
[1:15:46] Lord.
[1:15:48] Grant it. Bless me with them, Father.
[1:15:51] and thy name shall be praised. Thy glory
[1:15:54] shall be thine. Give us this eternal
[1:15:56] faith. Lord, as we consecrate ourselves
[1:15:59] to thee now, me over this Bible, over
[1:16:03] this stand. I give you my life, Lord.
[1:16:06] I'm depending on every promise that you
[1:16:08] give. I know they will be confirmed. I
[1:16:11] know they are truth. Give me courage to
[1:16:14] speak these words. Give me courage,
[1:16:17] Lord. correct me in what I shall do and
[1:16:20] say. I give myself to you with this
[1:16:23] church along with it, Lord. In the name
[1:16:24] of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:27] Amen.
[1:16:29] My faith
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; I don't even know where to start. uh I
[1:16:44] feel like in instead of the ability to
[1:16:46] summarize,
[1:16:48] I have the ability to multiply. So I
[1:16:51] don't even want to get started.
[1:16:54] It's just such a a personal message
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; to each individual
[1:17:01] to just know how to come in contact with
[1:17:03] this God and let him reveal himself for
[1:17:06] who he really is.
[1:17:08] that as the children of God, we are the
[1:17:11] ones that are go called to be at peace
[1:17:14] and not to be all worked up and and and
[1:17:18] and
[1:17:19] moved to and fro and and everything. You
[1:17:23] know, I I just thought to myself, how
[1:17:26] many believe this was a vindicated
[1:17:28] prophet?
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, do you believe a
[1:17:31] vandicate prophet can speak a lie? If
[1:17:35] he's vindicated, you are vindicated.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; It's the same prophet. Jesus came by the
[1:17:41] words of the prophet.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; You are coming by the word of this
[1:17:50] prophet, speaking
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; you into existence, a people.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we could just grasp that we
[1:18:00] God has given us everything that we have
[1:18:03] need of as part of the journey. There's
[1:18:06] nothing that is left that we have to go
[1:18:09] figure out ourselves. He wants when we
[1:18:12] come against challenges do not run.
[1:18:15] Speak the word and move forward.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Sickness come on the way we speak the
[1:18:19] word. Sickness will go away.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Challenges come. Whatever it is, you
[1:18:24] speak the word, you go forward. It has
[1:18:26] nothing to do about God being mad at you
[1:18:28] and everything or whatever. No, you
[1:18:31] speak the word and you move forward.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; You he said some of them don't even have
[1:18:36] to pray.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; They just spoke the word and move. He
[1:18:39] said I I have a job to do. I need the
[1:18:42] sun. I need more lights. Sun stand
[1:18:45] still.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; You can't explain that until today. Did
[1:18:48] the sun stop or do was it was it the
[1:18:51] earth that stopped?
[1:18:54] go figure that out.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; It happened.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; God has never left his people to wonder.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; He's I I just thought when he said it's
[1:19:07] he it's the same Jesus Christ the same
[1:19:11] yesterday, today, and forever. It's the
[1:19:14] He says the pillar of fire is move. How
[1:19:16] many believe the pillar of fire is
[1:19:18] moving in this room?
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God coming to manifest.
[1:19:24] Let's all stand. I don't want to I just
[1:19:27] I just wanted to speak to your heart
[1:19:30] tonight and and if we could just from
[1:19:33] your own mouth I just ask that we just
[1:19:36] say a prayer and say Lord open my eyes
[1:19:39] and help me to see what is it that
[1:19:42] you're really talking about.
[1:19:44] Father, we are called to be a people, an
[1:19:46] overcoming people, not a people that
[1:19:49] would crumble through challenges that
[1:19:51] the devil can just come and create
[1:19:53] whatever mess he wants in our lives and
[1:19:56] families and and everywhere that Father,
[1:19:58] we can possess our lands. And we know
[1:20:01] that this land has been given to us.
[1:20:03] This the our families, everything that
[1:20:06] we come, you've given it to us. We have
[1:20:09] the right to speak the word and see it
[1:20:12] come to pass. You've called us in the
[1:20:14] same time, not to be babies and cry out.
[1:20:17] You've called us to cry out to you, to
[1:20:20] let the word, to speak the word. He said
[1:20:23] one place, he said, Moses had already
[1:20:25] spoken what was going to happen to the
[1:20:27] Egyptian. He said, "Fear, don't fear.
[1:20:30] Whatever you see here, you shall see
[1:20:32] them no more. The Lord will manifest
[1:20:34] himself." And then he turns around and
[1:20:36] starts crying.
[1:20:40] And I was telling brother Matthew I said
[1:20:42] that's what we do you know Peter
[1:20:44] standing imagine Peter prayer oh this
[1:20:47] man came and you know maybe he wants to
[1:20:50] be a believer we really don't know Lord
[1:20:52] if you can if you will
[1:20:55] that doesn't look effective to me
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; God wants us to know what we are doing
[1:21:02] to have confidence in him and confidence
[1:21:05] in what he's made us to need
[1:21:09] when we when we go home, when we go in
[1:21:12] our daily lives, you you you we need and
[1:21:15] I I'm just speak to myself. I want to
[1:21:18] have the confidence to know that I'm a
[1:21:20] child of God. I'm operating as a
[1:21:23] believer and I have the right to conquer
[1:21:27] whatever is coming in front of me to
[1:21:29] bring in that subjection
[1:21:32] and not to be tossed by every wind of of
[1:21:35] of challenges that comes and and go go
[1:21:39] home all winded out and tired and can't
[1:21:42] do anything.
[1:21:45] No, I'm called to possess. I'm called to
[1:21:49] to to be a child of God. I'm called to
[1:21:52] manifest the characteristics of the
[1:21:55] bride in the end time. I was elected
[1:21:57] since the beginning, the foundation of
[1:21:59] the world. My name was in the lamb's
[1:22:01] book of life. And I'm here manifesting
[1:22:05] God for the generation and the people
[1:22:07] that I'm coming in contact with. I need
[1:22:10] to have that in certainty, not just a
[1:22:12] mind understanding, but the reality in
[1:22:16] my life.
[1:22:18] if each could just lift your hand and
[1:22:20] pray out to him. Just ask them from your
[1:22:22] own heart and say, "Lord, I don't want
[1:22:24] to be one crying out all the time. I
[1:22:26] want to be have the ability to speak. Oh
[1:22:29] Lord, help me wherever I'm failing. I I
[1:22:31] I want to just cry out to you so you
[1:22:34] could help me understand the position
[1:22:37] and the things that you are doing. You
[1:22:39] don't save someone today to lose him
[1:22:42] tomorrow or or go give me the Holy
[1:22:45] Spirit today, take it out tomorrow so I
[1:22:48] can look for it. No. What you do is
[1:22:50] certain, is perfect. It doesn't change.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for. I'm
[1:22:56] standing on a foundation, a firm
[1:22:59] foundation, not a shaky foundation. You
[1:23:02] are the same yesterday, today, and
[1:23:04] forever. Lord, we just pray and and I
[1:23:06] lift my hands tonight. Lord, this
[1:23:08] message is sincerely to my own heart,
[1:23:11] Lord. And I just see my own life and the
[1:23:15] things that I'm going through and and
[1:23:17] often time I forget who I am and what
[1:23:19] you've called me to be, oh God. And we
[1:23:22] just pray, lift our hands and say, Lord,
[1:23:24] for whatever the situation is in our
[1:23:26] lives, Lord, you've called us to move
[1:23:28] forward. At the end of the day, Lord,
[1:23:31] you've called us to manifest you in this
[1:23:33] generation. And however manner you
[1:23:36] choose, Lord, I pray that you give us
[1:23:38] that uncction, that anointing, Lord, to
[1:23:41] know to walk by by the very seed that's
[1:23:44] inside of us to know that we are the
[1:23:47] possessor of eternal life. We are the
[1:23:49] possessor of the situation that you've
[1:23:52] given us the power and the authority
[1:23:55] father not to go and just speak out of
[1:23:57] term and out of everything but father to
[1:24:00] be in line with the revealed word of the
[1:24:02] hour and to know what is it that we are
[1:24:05] called to do. Lord help us I pray each
[1:24:08] one tonight Lord and I pray that you
[1:24:10] just go around this room and those that
[1:24:12] are listening father that you may just
[1:24:14] drop yourself into our hearts Lord.
[1:24:16] Father, your prophet said that you you
[1:24:18] sent Moses and they said and then you
[1:24:21] turn around and said it was God going
[1:24:23] into the form of a man. Lord, today it's
[1:24:26] no different. Lord, when I read that, I
[1:24:28] see that it's God going into the form of
[1:24:30] a believer to do to perform his own word
[1:24:34] in what he really wants it to be. Help
[1:24:37] us, Lord. Forgive our sins. Forgive our
[1:24:39] shortcomings. We commit what we are into
[1:24:41] your hands. I pray, Father, that if
[1:24:43] we've done anything that's not pleasing
[1:24:45] to you, let the blood of your son
[1:24:47] cleanse us of all unrighteousness. But
[1:24:49] once all of that is said and done, Lord,
[1:24:52] we want to possess our land and the
[1:24:54] portion that you've given us. We want to
[1:24:56] be an effective believer, one that can
[1:24:59] go and have an effect on others that we
[1:25:02] can speak and it will see it come to
[1:25:03] pass. that we will conduct ourselves in
[1:25:06] a manner that will show forth the very
[1:25:09] work that you've done in our lives for
[1:25:11] everything that you've done. We commit
[1:25:13] those that are sick and afflicted
[1:25:14] remembering our pastor Lord that you may
[1:25:17] give them a safe travel and a successful
[1:25:19] meeting Lord committing all that we are
[1:25:21] into your hands in the name of the Lord
[1:25:23] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[1:25:27] Amen. Amen. Let's just sing that as
[1:25:29] brother of Matthew comes. God gift of
[1:25:32] grace
[1:25:34] is Jesus my redeemer.
