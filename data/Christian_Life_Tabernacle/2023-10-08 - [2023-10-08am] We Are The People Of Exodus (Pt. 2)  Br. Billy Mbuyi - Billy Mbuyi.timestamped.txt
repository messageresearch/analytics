[1:28] h
[1:35] now we just want to welcome you to the
[1:36] house of the Lord let's just stand we'll
[1:37] ask brother Mike to come and open our
[1:40] service in prayer and have our Psalm
[1:43] reading amen have you come with
[1:45] expectations this
[1:46] morning of God to move to do
[1:50] something well if you haven't if you've
[1:52] been so busy trying to get here now you
[1:54] can start to form in your heart and say
[1:55] hey I did actually come here to Worship
[1:58] the Lord and I did come come here to
[2:00] receive something from them so let's
[2:02] just be an expectation for what God is
[2:04] going to do amen God bless
[2:07] you let just go ahead and bow our heads
[2:09] this
[2:10] morning Father we just once again want
[2:13] to thank you for your goodness and
[2:14] bringing us to this place Lord Lord in
[2:17] all that we have before us every week
[2:19] and the things that Lord come against us
[2:21] and all the influences of the world and
[2:23] all the voices that surround us Lord the
[2:25] fact that we find ourselves back here in
[2:27] this place is evident of your hand Upon
[2:30] Our Lives Lord for no natural
[2:34] inclination of man would cause them to
[2:37] set aside time out of their busy
[2:39] schedule to come and Lord to lift up
[2:41] your name and to hear from you but
[2:43] something within us Lord that you placed
[2:45] there has brought us here that you might
[2:48] speak once again to us Lord and we
[2:50] believe that Lord as you promised in
[2:52] your word as we gather together in your
[2:54] name that you will be here Lord that
[2:56] every need that's been brought into this
[2:58] building Lord will have an answer answer
[3:00] we'll find an answer here in this word
[3:02] and in your presence today Lord we
[3:04] commit the service to you Lord every
[3:06] need that's coming the door Lord that
[3:08] you would have your way Lord that you
[3:10] would speak to each one and Lord that
[3:12] your word would have preeminence and
[3:13] that your name would be lifted up and we
[3:15] praise pray this in Jesus name amen amen
[3:20] well just to
[3:22] emphasize the need to be instant in
[3:24] season and out of season we uh we just
[3:26] flew in last night late last night yeah
[3:29] go ahead and be seated I'm sorry so uh
[3:32] we're going to read Psalm 68 this
[3:34] morning at least the first 18 verses
[3:36] it's a lengthy chapter so we're just
[3:37] going to read the first few verses there
[3:39] but you know as I was reading that this
[3:41] morning a verse out of that stuck out to
[3:44] me that you know I just share with you
[3:47] and um you know hopefully it you know
[3:50] means the same to you as it does to me
[3:51] it says in verse
[3:53] 11 the lord gave the
[3:55] word great was the company of those that
[3:59] published
[4:01] it and that caught my attention you know
[4:04] it's one thing to hear the word of the
[4:09] Lord but it's something else to have
[4:12] there be
[4:13] someone that publishes
[4:15] it you know as I was reading that the
[4:18] scripture in Isaiah 52 that we all know
[4:21] well came to mind it's Isaiah 526 it
[4:26] says therefore my people shall know my
[4:31] name therefore they shall know in that
[4:34] day that I am he that doth
[4:38] speak behold it is
[4:41] I how beautiful upon the mountains are
[4:44] the feet of him that bringeth good
[4:48] tidings that publisheth
[4:51] peace that bringeth good tidings of good
[4:55] that publisheth
[4:58] salvation he that saith unto Zion thy
[5:01] God
[5:03] reth thy Watchmen shall lift up the
[5:06] voice with the voice together shall they
[5:09] sing for they shall see eye to eye when
[5:13] the Lord shall bring again
[5:17] Zion you know the scripture
[5:21] speaks of the Lord speaking in his word
[5:25] but the thought that struck me was is
[5:28] there's an expectation that there be a
[5:31] publication a publishing of that word
[5:35] you know that word publish shows up in
[5:38] the scripture 29 times in different
[5:41] forms and it means this it says to make
[5:44] generally known to disseminate to the
[5:48] public to release for
[5:51] distribution the Hebrew word there means
[5:54] to show
[5:56] forth Paul was speaking in acts 13 He
[6:00] said for so hath the Lord commanded us
[6:03] saying I have set thee to be a light to
[6:07] the
[6:08] Gentiles that thou should us be for
[6:11] salvation that thou shouldest be for
[6:15] salvation unto the ends of the
[6:17] Earth and when the Gentiles heard this
[6:20] they were glad and glorified the word of
[6:22] the Lord and as many as were ordained to
[6:26] eternal life believed and the word of
[6:29] the Lord was
[6:30] published throughout all the
[6:33] region you know just a quick thought you
[6:35] know as I was reading that it's
[6:37] wonderful to hear the word of the lord
[6:40] we come into the service with
[6:41] expectation that we'll hear his word
[6:44] hopefully this isn't the only place
[6:46] where we hear the word of the Lord but
[6:48] that each and every one of us hear from
[6:50] him each day that's
[6:53] wonderful but where is the company that
[6:56] great company that will publish it
[7:00] that's the question it's one thing to
[7:03] hear the word the question is are we
[7:06] publishing it you know and this isn't
[7:09] just in books and tapes this is in flesh
[7:13] this is with words this is with
[7:16] actions as it says in 2 Corinthians 4
[7:19] for we preach
[7:22] publish not
[7:24] ourselves not our brand not our identity
[7:28] not our social
[7:30] presence but we publish G Christ Jesus
[7:33] the
[7:34] Lord and ourselves your servants for
[7:38] jesus' sake for God who commanded the
[7:41] light to shine out of Darkness hath
[7:42] shined in our hearts to give the light
[7:45] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[7:47] the face of Jesus Christ but we have
[7:51] this treasure in Earth and vessels
[7:55] flesh that the Excellency of the power
[7:58] may be of God
[7:59] and not of
[8:01] us we go ahead and stand this morning
[8:03] but as I was reading that scripture
[8:05] there in Psalm 68 it struck
[8:07] me am I a
[8:10] publisher of his
[8:12] word not just God sent a prophet but the
[8:16] word that I have heard when I have heard
[8:19] the word of God am I a publisher of that
[8:23] word how great are the company of them
[8:27] that publish it let's read those first
[8:29] 18 verses
[8:31] together let God arise let his enemies
[8:35] be scattered let them also that hate him
[8:38] flee before him as smoke is driven away
[8:41] so drive them away as wax melteth before
[8:44] the fire so let the wicked perish at the
[8:47] presence of God but let the righteous be
[8:50] glad let them Rejoice before God yay let
[8:54] them exceedingly Rejoice sing unto God
[8:57] sing praises to his name extol him that
[9:00] rideth upon the heavens by his name job
[9:03] and rejoice before him a father of the
[9:06] fatherless and a judge of the widows is
[9:09] God in his holy habitation God set at
[9:12] the solitarian families he bringeth out
[9:15] those which are bound with chains but
[9:18] the rebellious dwell in a dry land oh
[9:21] God when thou Wiest forth before thy
[9:23] people when thou did March through the
[9:26] Wilderness CA the Earth shook the also
[9:29] dropped at the presence of God even
[9:32] Sinai itself was moved at the presence
[9:34] of God the god of Israel thou oh God did
[9:38] send a plentiful reain whereby thou did
[9:41] confirm thine inheritance when it was
[9:43] weary thy congregation hath dwelt
[9:46] therein thou oh God has prepared of thy
[9:49] goodness for the poor the lord gave the
[9:52] word great was the company of those that
[9:55] published it Kings of armies did flee a
[9:58] pace and she she that carried it home
[10:00] divided the spoil though ye have lean
[10:02] among the pots yet shall ye be as the
[10:05] wings of a dove covered with silver and
[10:08] her feathers with yellow gold when the
[10:10] almighty scattered Kings in it it was

[21:52] um Matthew asked for
[21:55] prayer for healing of his ankle
[21:58] you know there's there's nothing too big
[22:02] too small for our God we were out
[22:05] ministering and
[22:06] a a young sister came up and she asked
[22:10] for prayer cuz she had a cold and I
[22:13] thought I appreciate that as many times
[22:17] we just put up with
[22:19] stuff we have a heavenly father who
[22:23] cares who went to Calvary not just for
[22:25] the big things but for the little things
[22:27] and so we we have a high priest that's
[22:29] touched by the feeling of our infirmity
[22:31] so if you have a need and maybe an
[22:34] unspoken request you just want to lift
[22:36] up your hand and just ask brother Andrew
[22:39] to come
[22:40] [Music]
[22:41] and take these needs before the Lord and
[22:45] ask a blessing over the tithes and
[22:48] offerings um brother Daniel writes God

[34:10] chapter 3 and verse 1 it
[34:15] says now Moses kept the flock of uh
[34:19] jro's father-in-law uh the priest of
[34:21] Midian and and and he led the flock to
[34:26] the backside of the desert and came to
[34:28] the Mountain of God even to Horeb and
[34:31] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[34:34] in a flame of fire out of the midst of
[34:36] the Bush and he looked and behold the
[34:39] bush burned with fire and the Bush was
[34:42] not consumed and Moses says Moses said I
[34:46] will now turn aside and see this great
[34:49] sight um why this bush is not burned and
[34:53] when the Lord saw that Moses turned
[34:56] aside to to see God called unto him
[34:59] called out of out of the midst of the
[35:01] Bush and said Moses Moses and he said
[35:04] here I am let's also turn uh let's Skip
[35:08] and and read verse 8 it says I am I am
[35:12] come down to deliver them out of out of
[35:15] the hands of the Egyptian to bring them
[35:18] out to bring them up out to the land
[35:22] unto unto a good land and a large unto
[35:26] the the land flowing with milk and honey
[35:28] unto the place of the Canaanites the
[35:30] hites the amorites the parasites the uh
[35:34] heaves and the jebusites now therefore
[35:37] Behold The Cry of the children of Israel
[35:40] has come unto me unto me and and I have
[35:44] also seen the oppression wherewith the
[35:46] Egyptian oppressed them come now
[35:49] therefore I will send thee uh unto
[35:52] Pharaoh that thou mayest bring my people
[35:56] the children children of Israel out of
[35:58] Egypt let's just bow our heads father we
[36:00] ask that you bless your word to us in
[36:02] the name of Jesus Christ amen may have
[36:04] your seats this morning we want to
[36:06] continue just in the same line we were
[36:09] talking the people of Exodus we are the
[36:12] people of Exodus
[36:14] and I I want to say this this morning um
[36:18] it's very important we as individuals
[36:21] not just as a body or believer not even
[36:24] just as an age but it's important we
[36:27] realize that we are the people of an
[36:29] exodus we we have to look at ourselves
[36:31] and I can even say this morning we we we
[36:36] as Christians have to always have it on
[36:38] our mind that this world is not our home
[36:41] uh we we we don't want to make it too
[36:43] comfortable for us to stay here forever
[36:46] we we we want to know that we are on the
[36:49] journey and and we are here only a temp
[36:53] for a temporary time we are and we don't
[36:56] want to make make this a permanent place
[36:58] we don't want to be anchored here do all
[37:01] our business here and stay here forever
[37:03] we understand uh one way or the other in
[37:07] this lifetime that we are living in our
[37:09] life is only here for a
[37:11] moment the the and and I want to say
[37:14] this we also want to understand that we
[37:16] are on a journey somewhere whether we
[37:19] know what that is whether we understand
[37:21] or don't understand but we are being
[37:24] moved we are on an exodus some place to
[37:27] some destination that we are going and I
[37:29] believe the reason why we gather here
[37:31] this morning is because we want to be
[37:33] sure of where we are going and I want to
[37:36] say this because we we as as people as a
[37:40] human we know uh Brother David said this
[37:42] a while ago the question that man has
[37:45] always asked himself is where do I come
[37:47] from how did I get here and where am I
[37:50] going the the very uh uh uh
[37:54] understanding of the meaning what Gives
[37:57] Life Meaning is when a man is able to
[37:59] answer those three questions where is it
[38:01] that I'm coming from what am I doing
[38:04] here what's my purpose here on Earth and
[38:06] where is it that I'm going and so those
[38:09] things determine they on themselves they
[38:12] show you that you are on an exodus to
[38:14] some destination so whether we
[38:16] understand it or we don't understand it
[38:18] we are headed to a destination we are
[38:21] here to find out by the word of God
[38:24] where is it that we are going we are are
[38:26] here because we know there's a promise
[38:28] in the word of God for the time that we
[38:30] are living in there's a promise in the
[38:32] message of the hour about the people of
[38:35] this generation and we are here to find
[38:38] out what is my final destination going
[38:40] to be and I want to say this uh our
[38:42] choices is a very good indicator of
[38:45] where we're going to
[38:47] go because the person who's on the
[38:49] journey they make choices that shows
[38:52] where they're going the things that they
[38:54] engage in what they do all of that it
[38:56] will be a summary or a summation of what
[39:00] they thinking about what tomorrow is
[39:01] going to be if you don't think much of
[39:04] tomorrow you're going to do whatever you
[39:05] need to do but if you know tomorrow
[39:07] there won't be any food you'll go buy
[39:09] all the groceries that you can if you
[39:11] knew that tomorrow there won't be any
[39:13] water you're going to go get all the
[39:15] water that you can and you know so the
[39:18] the what what what we do today is
[39:21] deterministic of what we think tomorrow
[39:23] is going to be so therefore we we we as
[39:26] the Believers of this message we cannot
[39:29] get complacent we we cannot come to a
[39:32] place where we think well we've we've
[39:34] arrived and we understand it all no God
[39:37] is taking your life and the same way he
[39:40] took you out of sin and he washed you
[39:43] and he he brought you to the knowledge
[39:44] of this message he took you and he
[39:47] brought you here so you can hear the
[39:48] things that you are hearing he didn't
[39:50] bring you here so this could be your
[39:52] final destination no he's taking you on
[39:55] a journey somewhere where and so the
[39:58] same way he took you out is the same way
[40:00] he's leading you so this is not a a time
[40:04] where uh we we need to be halfhazard or
[40:08] or or give up or get complacent I I'll
[40:11] say even this morning I was as I was
[40:14] studying this and and it just came on my
[40:16] heart and and I was thinking about even
[40:19] what's happening in the world today we
[40:21] just learned that Saturday Israel got
[40:23] into a war a war that they didn't look
[40:26] for a war you as if there was not enough
[40:29] Wars already and and we we understand it
[40:32] was about 200 people killed and Hamas
[40:35] was successfully able to penetrate from
[40:38] different uh locations and they said
[40:40] it's never been to this scale never in
[40:42] the
[40:44] history so it it behoves us to know that
[40:48] we we're not going to remain here
[40:49] forever something is happening whether
[40:53] we are we want to be aware of it or not
[40:55] be aware of it it's moving and and and
[40:58] I'll say this the the the the thing
[41:00] about it is there's times where things
[41:03] seems like it's not moving it seems like
[41:05] things are just going as slow as it can
[41:07] and they slow and then there comes a
[41:09] time where there's a bunch of prophecies
[41:11] all coming at the same time and I want
[41:13] to say this it behooves us to always be
[41:16] ready at every moment this is not time
[41:19] to to be one foot in and one foot out
[41:21] and this is not time to get complacent
[41:24] this is the time of full commitment to
[41:27] what God has given us in order for us to
[41:30] see the results that we are looking for
[41:32] we need to be committed to the cause we
[41:34] need to know that we are in an exodus
[41:37] out of here God is trying to bring us
[41:38] out of here by all means possible amen
[41:41] amen and so we we and I want to say this
[41:45] we have a promise uh that that if the
[41:48] world will get in the condition that
[41:50] it's in today you know I it just you you
[41:54] sit you look at the world and you can't
[41:56] make any sense of what's happening out
[41:59] there you're like well you would think
[42:01] people want to live in peace no they
[42:03] don't want peace they want war and they
[42:06] want why because bam tells us that they
[42:09] are in the spirit of the last day but
[42:12] what I'm say that God is not going to
[42:14] destroy man man is going to destroy man
[42:17] by themselves and that's what's
[42:19] happening out there you you you you
[42:21] think you know in the history of United
[42:24] States a speaker get it rejected out of
[42:27] his postal Duty because they had some
[42:30] rules that didn't make any sense you're
[42:32] like how is that even
[42:34] happened I I tell you we we're not here
[42:37] to make sense of what's happening out
[42:39] there because it's going to be chaos
[42:40] upon chaos upon chaos we are here and we
[42:44] need to be sincere and be given over to
[42:47] know what is the promise of my time and
[42:50] am I walking according to when because
[42:53] he said when those things are happening
[42:55] out there you need to look within and
[42:57] say that what is the promise for the
[42:59] believer and am I in that promise
[43:02] walking in the promise of my time seeing
[43:04] the fruits of that promise come to pass
[43:06] in my
[43:08] life right the the prophet will say this
[43:11] this is not our home and things that are
[43:13] to be he says now we think of this now
[43:16] that God we should behave ourselves and
[43:19] act like
[43:21] Christians we should behave ourselves
[43:23] and act like Christians our cond should
[43:26] be like Christians because we are aliens
[43:30] here this is not our home no we are we
[43:34] are just put here temporarily we've got
[43:37] to go every one of us tonight and oh my
[43:41] I I and I think when you you engage the
[43:45] world and when you go to work and when
[43:47] you go do you ever come home and think
[43:50] oh I I'm here only temporary we we said
[43:54] last time here there's no continuous
[43:56] City we seek for one that is to come and
[43:59] whose Builder maker is God we need to be
[44:02] in the mindset that I'm here temporarily
[44:05] I'm here on an exodus to some
[44:07] destination I'm here that God will do
[44:10] what he needs to do with my life that he
[44:12] will clean me and wash me and get me
[44:14] ready for the new body that's awaiting
[44:16] me we we can't get complacent that's
[44:19] that has I was listening to our pastor
[44:21] when he preach on Friday I I follow a
[44:23] little bit of what he was saying I and I
[44:25] say this Rapture has to be on our mind
[44:28] every
[44:29] day I tell you this we need healing
[44:32] we'll get healing says it's the
[44:34] children's bread we need this and we
[44:37] need Deliverance God will give all of
[44:39] those things but with with all of that
[44:41] we cannot get sidetracked and start
[44:43] chasing things that God didn't that's
[44:46] not the promise of the age the promise
[44:48] of the age is Rapture so I want
[44:51] everything that I'm going to get to be
[44:52] leading me in that
[44:54] direction true
[44:56] that's right I want my focus everything
[44:59] I want everything that I do to to add up
[45:02] to the Rapture not take me away not
[45:04] Sidetrack me not lead me to another
[45:06] Direction but to lead me to that great
[45:09] Rapture that is to come am but when I'm
[45:12] say this and I know we know these things
[45:14] and he speaks about this I I just want
[45:17] you to follow through and I know you
[45:19] know this very well but I want you to
[45:20] see just the the how the F the prophet
[45:24] is unfolding this things and he speaks
[45:27] here he says and here some time ago now
[45:30] he's speaking about when he was with his
[45:31] wife and he saw this woman in the skirt
[45:34] he says and yes sometime ago uh he says
[45:37] the wife and I uh about two years ago
[45:39] brother merer and them uh we'll get a
[45:42] kick out of this and he
[45:44] says and to say we was over the shopping
[45:47] center uh uh and he says in our city
[45:49] here it's over Many religious people and
[45:52] soall but we seen a woman that had a
[45:55] hurt and it was strange it was a strange
[45:58] it was a strange thing and then he says
[46:01] because none of the rest of them seem to
[46:03] have had one and so we know that many of
[46:06] them that sing in the choir and
[46:09] everything now he he's giving you a
[46:11] characteristic somewhere is singing the
[46:14] choir and everything and so forth my
[46:16] wife said to me she says it says well it
[46:19] says well I said well you see uh they
[46:22] are not our they are not of our
[46:25] citizenship
[46:27] she said what I said no they are not of
[46:31] ours she said they are Americans ATI I
[46:35] said sure they are Americans that may be
[46:38] that may be true enough it says I find
[46:42] out in missions and in missionary and
[46:44] missionary and around the world I go to
[46:47] Germany there's a national Spirit called
[46:50] it a German Spirit it says and it's the
[46:53] spirit of the of the nation I go up in
[46:56] Switzerland and I find out just the
[46:58] brothers just brothers almost speaking
[47:01] the same language but there's another
[47:03] spirit it's a different spirit it's a
[47:05] it's a s it's a spirit of Switzerland
[47:08] and then I come to over to Finland I
[47:10] came I go I came over to fin Finland it
[47:13] said and allog together a different
[47:15] spirit and I come to America there's a
[47:17] there's a spirit of America that's right
[47:20] well I say we are it says we aren't we
[47:24] American citizen why is that why is why
[47:27] is it that our people are so and so and
[47:30] I said well you see honey see each
[47:33] Nation lives off on the spirit of that
[47:37] Nation that's the national Spirit she
[47:40] said then then wouldn't we be living in
[47:43] the American Spirit I said oh no listen
[47:47] to this oh no I said we are born
[47:51] again we live on the Heavenly spirit we
[47:56] Holiness and righteousness and let me
[47:58] say this this is very important because
[48:02] if we understand that we are on an
[48:04] exodus then we need to understand that
[48:06] we are no longer Americans we are no
[48:09] longer Africans or the whatever Nation
[48:12] we come from we are of an Heavenly
[48:15] spirit and we walk that's what qualifies
[48:18] us for Exodus without you being born of
[48:22] this spirit that he talking about
[48:24] without you having a Heavenly Spirit
[48:27] upon you of the holy spirit of God you
[48:30] do not qualify for an
[48:34] exodus The Exodus is God came and took
[48:37] you out of the national Spirit whatever
[48:40] Spirit you are born in whatever country
[48:42] you were coming from God came and he
[48:44] took you out of that Nation he brought
[48:47] you and you were born into another
[48:50] Nation you were born into another
[48:52] country you walk by the spirit of that
[48:55] country you act by the spirit of that
[48:57] country you think like the one of that
[48:59] country you talk like one from that
[49:02] country and that's why it's important
[49:04] that we have a full Exodus within our
[49:06] lives where we are not tied by the
[49:08] things of the world or by the mind of
[49:10] the world but we are fully surrendered
[49:13] into the spirit of the nation that we
[49:15] are born
[49:16] in he will continue on and it says we
[49:19] are not American as far as that goes
[49:22] because America is just on an an an
[49:25] earth ly Nation but when a when a German
[49:28] and of a ger when when a man of Germany
[49:31] of of of Switzerland or whatever uh he
[49:35] may be when he becomes born of of born
[49:38] of Heaven he says he takes the Heavenly
[49:42] Spirit his nature his makeup look for
[49:46] the things above Christ sets right uh
[49:50] sits uh it says where Christ sits at the
[49:52] right hand of God Amen it says
[49:56] oh how we ought to remember that he died
[50:00] that we might be able to be fortified
[50:03] from the things inoculation that's right
[50:06] so we when we are of a of a certain
[50:09] nation and of a certain Spirit we don't
[50:12] walk by by the things of other
[50:16] nations our mindset and our our way of
[50:19] doing things and I want to say this the
[50:22] there is a uh uh uh uh uh
[50:25] characteristics to the people of Exodus
[50:28] the the people that are going in an
[50:30] exodus they are
[50:32] identifiable why because they walk by
[50:34] the spirit of whatever Nation they are
[50:36] in the children of Israel they had a
[50:39] culture they don't touch the unclean
[50:41] things and they don't do this they had a
[50:43] law by which they were to walk by that's
[50:46] what qualifies them as the people of
[50:48] Exodus why be because they were not like
[50:50] other nations when Christ came and he
[50:53] gave his life on the second Exodus the
[50:55] people of that nation that were moved
[50:57] from the spirit unto the spirit they
[51:00] became filled with the Holy Spirit then
[51:02] there were no longer Jew or Gentile the
[51:04] spirit tells us they were born in
[51:06] another country they were born of
[51:08] another nation and they operated by that
[51:11] the spirit of that nation and we in the
[51:14] Ted Exodus are no longer different
[51:16] because the spirit tells us that we move
[51:18] from the spiritual into the Everlasting
[51:21] so what is it we are governed by the
[51:24] spirit of God to move into the
[51:28] heavenlies he would say the hour is late
[51:31] in another message the hour is late as
[51:34] one said a while ago he said in a prayer
[51:38] and I just want to walk in it says the
[51:40] hour is late and we need uh and the need
[51:43] is great it says we are here uh to try
[51:47] to put uh to play to try to put our part
[51:50] in to help this great hour that we are
[51:54] in and and I just W to for a moment I
[51:58] want to say
[51:59] this it we we cannot
[52:04] be uh part of this
[52:07] Exodus that God is calling
[52:10] for and not be able to examine Our
[52:14] Lives to to check up to see am I what
[52:19] what is am I being influenced by this
[52:24] Exodus am I living by the spirit of this
[52:28] Exodus is is this message really having
[52:31] an effect on my life am I really seeing
[52:35] the fruits of this Exodus that I'm in if
[52:38] if the because remember the Exodus takes
[52:41] God to come down first without God
[52:44] coming down there's no Exodus forget
[52:47] about it the change in your life will
[52:50] take God to come down first and I'm not
[52:53] just talking about the age Exodus I'm
[52:55] talking about your personal Exodus you
[52:58] cannot stop doing the things that you
[53:00] are doing unless God comes down first
[53:03] unless God speaks his word first unless
[53:06] God has a promise first by which he can
[53:08] call you out from the things that you
[53:10] are in and put you in the things that he
[53:13] wants you to be you are on a destination
[53:16] somewhere and God is the author of
[53:20] it but when I'm said this it continues
[53:23] on in the same thought it says
[53:25] the hour is getting late and and I want
[53:28] to say this are we aware of the lateness
[53:31] of the hour are we you know there's no
[53:37] calendar there's no quote there's no
[53:40] message that you can read for you to buy
[53:43] yourself any even one
[53:48] minute the reason everything shows you
[53:51] that the hour is now the hour is late
[53:54] the hour is late there's not a place you
[53:56] can say well this hasn't really happened
[53:59] I'm waiting for this to happen then I'll
[54:01] see no as far as you are concerned the
[54:04] word is in front of you the message that
[54:07] sent to prepare you for an exodus is in
[54:09] front of you it's for you to take it and
[54:11] eat it and let the word change your life
[54:15] into the Exodus person so you can be
[54:18] taken out of here so the hour is late
[54:22] the hour it says the hour is late in the
[54:25] evening it's also late in the time that
[54:27] we are living in the Sun is going down
[54:30] the world is cooling off God it says
[54:32] Darkness will soon take set in it says
[54:36] then the coming of the Lord the cing
[54:38] away of the church how that we are
[54:40] thankful for this now it's amazing
[54:44] because when the the things of the world
[54:47] when they
[54:48] unfold the the the people of the world
[54:52] they get
[54:54] scared they get
[54:56] uneasy the uncertainty grows because the
[55:00] very Foundation that they were upon is
[55:02] shaking they realize that they don't
[55:05] have enough they don't realize they
[55:07] don't they realize that they don't have
[55:09] what it takes to keep them they realize
[55:11] that the government under which they
[55:13] rely on doesn't have what it takes to
[55:15] keep them but over the other side for
[55:18] the believer is supposed to be a time of
[55:21] rejoicing a time of thanking God a time
[55:24] of uh uh coming to the realization that
[55:27] what I've always believed is to be the
[55:29] truth to see that God is here
[55:31] vindicating his word let me say this the
[55:34] prophecy out there is an assurance for
[55:37] you to know that the promise in you is
[55:40] coming to
[55:46] pass he said we pray now that you will
[55:50] bless every person in that divine
[55:52] presence everyone everyone that the
[55:55] Hearts any anyone that hears this tape
[55:57] around the world it says may we get away
[56:00] from those old Creek uh Creeds and
[56:03] things and come to serve the Living God
[56:06] come in and invest into
[56:10] it oh my where is are we making the
[56:14] right Investments it says that we may
[56:16] invest in it do like the Queen of Sheba
[56:20] she came and took her uh uh took her
[56:23] three months to get were the men of uh
[56:26] the men that representing Jesus Christ
[56:29] or God of the god of Heaven Solomon uh
[56:32] Jesus said she came from the outer part
[56:35] most of the world to hear the wisdom of
[56:38] Solomon and behold greater than Solomon
[56:41] is here it says and we know that greater
[56:44] than Solomon is here great he says the
[56:48] great Holy Spirit himself is here
[56:51] walking through the people he says how
[56:53] that we thank him for this father I pray
[56:56] the blessing now so we we we have to
[57:00] understand that the the word of the hour
[57:03] the message of the hour is a message to
[57:06] prepare you for an
[57:09] exodus the the the and Pastor said all
[57:13] the time this is a living message and I
[57:16] think it's important that we have those
[57:19] things in our mind and in our heart is
[57:22] this message when you read it when you
[57:24] look look the things that he says it's
[57:26] not telling you anything about how you
[57:28] can cope with your life it doesn't tell
[57:31] you anything about how you're going to
[57:32] do this how you going to achieve great
[57:34] success no he's telling you that this
[57:36] world is going to go into a
[57:38] destruction everywhere you read is
[57:41] telling you the world is falling apart
[57:43] the world is falling apart it's getting
[57:45] worse and worse and and why because they
[57:47] rejected the very light that God sent
[57:49] them that's why they are in the
[57:52] condition that they are in but those who
[57:54] receive the the light that God said will
[57:56] be lifted up out of this earth into an
[57:59] exodus so I want to say this the word of
[58:02] God is here to create a separation in
[58:04] your
[58:08] heart the word of God is given for it to
[58:12] kill in you the desires you have of the
[58:17] world when you inject the word of God in
[58:20] your heart it starts killing everything
[58:22] of the world oh I I have this ambition
[58:25] the word of God kills it oh I want to be
[58:28] an astronaut the word of God kills it oh
[58:31] I want to achieve great things the word
[58:32] of God kills it why because it wants to
[58:36] take everything in perspective and
[58:38] prepare you for the oncoming
[58:42] event
[58:45] amen I I thought there was something
[58:48] that but David said that thought there
[58:50] was so much wisdom in it he said when
[58:53] Jesus Christ looked looked at the Rich
[58:55] Young
[58:56] Ruler he knew that he was not ready for
[59:00] the event that was to come around the
[59:05] corner I want you to think about that a
[59:08] prophet is one who sees around the
[59:10] corner he's one who sees something
[59:13] before they happen Jesus may have looked
[59:16] at him even though he loved him he knew
[59:19] that hell was his destination he said
[59:22] well for you to avoid what's about to
[59:24] come take
[59:26] this instead you take this and it will
[59:29] help you avoid what's about to happen to
[59:33] you and and I want to say this the word
[59:35] of God is offered to us to get us out of
[59:38] the situation that we are
[59:40] in now I I want to say this I don't care
[59:43] what you're dealing with this morning oh
[59:45] I I can't overcome this the word of God
[59:48] is here to help you oh I can't do this
[59:50] the word is here to help you this Exodus
[59:53] is not a m made Exodus it's no it's not
[59:56] you waking up in the morning say well I
[59:59] I don't want to sin anymore no that's
[1:00:01] good but if it's just your mind it will
[1:00:03] not help you understand that you you I
[1:00:07] don't want to lie anymore that's
[1:00:08] wonderful but let God come down because
[1:00:11] there's no Exodus unless God comes down
[1:00:14] go to the Bible find the promise call
[1:00:17] upon his name let him come down and take
[1:00:20] you out in an
[1:00:23] exodus but when I'm says this God wants
[1:00:26] to help you God wants to help you the
[1:00:30] problem is man wants to do things by
[1:00:33] himself and when you want to do it by
[1:00:36] yourself you can't overcome because it's
[1:00:38] just you but if you bring the owner or
[1:00:41] the author of The Exodus into your life
[1:00:44] he will promise he will take you out of
[1:00:47] an
[1:00:49] exodus so I want to say this it it's
[1:00:52] here to to to take away the desires if
[1:00:56] you find yourself still struggling with
[1:00:58] the desires of the world and this and
[1:01:00] that oh I I tell you this morning this
[1:01:03] is not
[1:01:04] condemnation this is the word that comes
[1:01:07] to rescue you this morning all you need
[1:01:09] is to lift your hand and say father I I
[1:01:12] needed some Exodus this morning I I need
[1:01:15] to get out of a lot of stuff that I'm in
[1:01:17] this morning I'm stuck in some things
[1:01:20] that I I tried for my own and I can't
[1:01:22] take out and I know I need I need this
[1:01:24] things taken off before the Rapture so
[1:01:27] I'm here that you can take me out in an
[1:01:29] exodus and I know that I've tried on my
[1:01:32] own I can't but you promise in your word
[1:01:35] you promise Malachi 4 will come you
[1:01:37] promise Luke 17:30 you promise that
[1:01:40] you'll have a bride of your own choosing
[1:01:42] you promise that there will be a people
[1:01:44] on Earth that'll be the very
[1:01:46] representative of you you promise that
[1:01:48] you yourself will come the same way that
[1:01:51] God poured himself into you you will
[1:01:53] pour yourself into a people I want to be
[1:01:57] that people this morning and I can't get
[1:01:59] that by myself I need an exodus in my
[1:02:03] [Applause]
[1:02:05] life this is a reality this is not some
[1:02:08] fairy tale this is Jesus Christ the same
[1:02:12] yesterday today and forever this is what
[1:02:14] the Exodus is all
[1:02:17] [Music]
[1:02:20] about the first one was a natural land
[1:02:24] because they had a promised land that
[1:02:26] they had to get in they had to go from a
[1:02:28] natural land to a natural land the
[1:02:31] second one we know he was from a
[1:02:33] spiritual condition into the baptism of
[1:02:36] the Holy Spirit but the last one is not
[1:02:39] to keep you here on Earth is to take you
[1:02:42] and pick you out out of this world and
[1:02:45] put you into the heavenlies where a body
[1:02:48] is waiting for you
[1:02:52] Hallelujah and let me say this so we
[1:02:55] when we gather here we we have to come
[1:02:57] and know that I'm here it's because of a
[1:03:01] promise I let me say this I didn't make
[1:03:04] myself a Christian I didn't I didn't
[1:03:07] open my own eyes to see the message I
[1:03:09] didn't claim to be a message I didn't
[1:03:11] bring myself here to be part of the body
[1:03:14] God did that why because he has an
[1:03:17] exodus that is working
[1:03:23] on
[1:03:29] but but will
[1:03:32] say he
[1:03:34] says he says
[1:03:37] now we've had many
[1:03:39] Exodus and I want to say
[1:03:42] this every day we hear the word of God
[1:03:45] we come in contact with
[1:03:47] God he calls us to move a step
[1:03:50] forward he causes an exodus a movement
[1:03:55] uh uh going
[1:03:56] forward going into a
[1:03:59] direction and he says we've had many
[1:04:02] exence people have called for changes in
[1:04:04] our own lives oh do this you're going to
[1:04:06] be you're going to change and oh you're
[1:04:08] struggling with weight and go do this
[1:04:10] and do this and do and and I've seen
[1:04:13] people they go on to lose weight yet to
[1:04:15] come back and get and pick up where they
[1:04:17] left
[1:04:20] off oh if you do this you'll be changed
[1:04:23] oh it goes and you see oh that's
[1:04:26] wonderful I I see them make progress and
[1:04:29] just give him a little bit of time it
[1:04:31] comes right back to where they left off
[1:04:34] right so so I'm saying this to say it
[1:04:38] has to be an exodus in your life that
[1:04:40] God called for an exodus not a main call
[1:04:44] Exodus how does God call he has a
[1:04:47] promised word in his word where he says
[1:04:50] that I I have heard the Cry of my people
[1:04:54] and The Exodus oh I just want to jump
[1:04:56] ahead they they he has a step to an
[1:04:59] exodus so first there has to be a crying
[1:05:01] out from the condition that you are in I
[1:05:04] don't like what I see I don't like the
[1:05:06] things that I'm involved in I don't like
[1:05:08] all of this and I know you promise
[1:05:11] you'll make me a real Christian I know
[1:05:13] you promise that you will take me and
[1:05:15] you will make me one that can serve you
[1:05:17] and I want to serve
[1:05:19] you and then God will hear your cry he
[1:05:22] will say I heard the cay of my people
[1:05:25] and I himself have come down and I'm
[1:05:27] sending you and preacher will send here
[1:05:29] and preach the word of God and you will
[1:05:31] receive the word and it will cause an
[1:05:33] exodus in your life so this is not a
[1:05:36] man-made process it's God's process of
[1:05:39] getting you out of what you are in
[1:05:42] Hallelujah so the prophet
[1:05:45] said but I'm speaking at time this isn't
[1:05:48] a message Third Exodus paragraph 55 I'm
[1:05:51] speaking of a time that God called for
[1:05:53] in Exodus
[1:05:54] a separation from where you were where
[1:05:57] they were at the present time and here
[1:06:02] God is making ready to fulfill his
[1:06:05] Divine promise word and that he had
[1:06:08] given to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
[1:06:11] years a it says a hundred of years had
[1:06:14] passed but yet God never forgets his
[1:06:19] promise in in the season the due time
[1:06:23] God always makes his promise right
[1:06:27] aren't you glad we have that kind of God
[1:06:30] he always there to make his promise
[1:06:32] right he says therefore you can rest
[1:06:35] assure paragraph 56 you can rest assure
[1:06:39] that when that what God has promised in
[1:06:42] his in the Bible he's going to do it
[1:06:45] just no need to try to think anything
[1:06:49] else you wasting your time thinking
[1:06:51] anything else you wasting your breath
[1:06:53] you wasting your effort you're wasting
[1:06:56] years of your life if God said it's
[1:06:58] going to come to pass you stand still it
[1:07:01] will come to pass and I know we said
[1:07:03] last time so isn't it amazing because if
[1:07:07] God said
[1:07:08] something because of his nature I would
[1:07:12] almost say it's
[1:07:15] impossible because he cannot say
[1:07:18] something that you will think and say oh
[1:07:21] I got
[1:07:22] that yeah you're going to go in the body
[1:07:26] change I have no idea how all I know is
[1:07:30] God said he's the master of the
[1:07:32] impossible I am climbing into the
[1:07:35] impossible he will take me from The
[1:07:37] Impossible into the
[1:07:40] possible what is our problem you know
[1:07:43] God said you already heal you like oh I
[1:07:46] don't know the doctor said there the so
[1:07:48] you give the doctor more power more
[1:07:50] Authority more belief than you do in God
[1:07:54] that's right if God said you are saved
[1:07:57] oh my goodness I'll say I'm safe I'll
[1:07:59] sing I'm safe until I die why because
[1:08:02] because it's God who said
[1:08:05] it Hallelujah I I like the prophet the
[1:08:08] story that the prophet talks about that
[1:08:10] couple with the baby in the hospital and
[1:08:13] I like how he says it because it's so
[1:08:16] it's so true there's so much truth in it
[1:08:19] here comes the nurse and she's looking
[1:08:21] at the instruments it's like things
[1:08:23] she's never SE before so she comes and
[1:08:25] he says you're giving them false hope
[1:08:27] and he's looking at the the parents is
[1:08:29] saying you you hear rejoicing but your
[1:08:32] son is dying he the par the dad looks
[1:08:35] and says he says young lady he says you
[1:08:38] are looking at the instruments that you
[1:08:40] were training to look at as far as you
[1:08:43] are concerned this is where your
[1:08:44] knowledge stopped but I'm not looking at
[1:08:47] the same thing that you are looking I am
[1:08:49] looking at the Creator
[1:08:52] himself the one who can create out of
[1:08:55] nothing don't forget this world came out
[1:08:58] of him if you can understand that let me
[1:09:01] know you say there was no world I don't
[1:09:04] can't even go past that I can't put it
[1:09:07] in my mind you because every time you
[1:09:09] say there was no world you create a void
[1:09:12] there was no void there was just
[1:09:14] God
[1:09:18] sir but yet we come with our human
[1:09:22] problems
[1:09:24] when he says I've taken care of it with
[1:09:26] struggle I don't know how it's not for
[1:09:29] you to know how it's for you to just
[1:09:32] know who said
[1:09:34] it if we can just rest in who said it I
[1:09:38] think that will help us a lot God I
[1:09:40] don't understand the process I don't
[1:09:42] understand how I'm going to get out of
[1:09:44] this but one thing I know is if you said
[1:09:46] it you have the power you have the tools
[1:09:49] you have everything that you need in
[1:09:51] order to create out of nothing to bring
[1:09:54] it to come to pass for me so therefore I
[1:09:56] am only hanging on to the word because
[1:09:59] the word has creative
[1:10:04] power so now he says now he he he says
[1:10:11] here in paragraph 57 and in luk look how
[1:10:15] simple he does
[1:10:17] it I am come down I heard that cry so
[1:10:22] there has to be a cur
[1:10:24] I remember my promise there has to be a
[1:10:27] promise I am come down and I'm sending
[1:10:32] you there has to be one that is sent and
[1:10:35] then he says you do it I'm going to be
[1:10:38] with you certainly I'll be with you my
[1:10:42] never failing presence will be with you
[1:10:45] wherever you go don't be afraid I'm
[1:10:49] coming down to deliver you it says I'm
[1:10:51] I'm I'm sure this spirit spiritual mind
[1:10:54] catches that see I'm going to send you
[1:10:57] to bring you my people to an exodus call
[1:11:01] them out and I'll be with you so God
[1:11:04] comes in this generation he anoints a
[1:11:07] prophet in the backside of the desert he
[1:11:10] calls him from his birth and he prepares
[1:11:12] him he says I have given you a message
[1:11:15] my never-failing presence will be with
[1:11:17] you you just go and call my people out
[1:11:21] and they will hear my word and they will
[1:11:22] come out often time we want to know the
[1:11:25] process well how is it going to happen
[1:11:27] he says that's not for you to know you
[1:11:29] just go and speak the word my failing my
[1:11:32] never failing presence will be with you
[1:11:34] you said I've I've done it and fail the
[1:11:37] difference is this time God is with
[1:11:40] you oh I I've tried many times I fail I
[1:11:44] know but this time he said I'm going
[1:11:47] with you but when him said God came down
[1:11:50] where was he God going in the form of a
[1:11:53] man
[1:11:54] what makes the difference is not the man
[1:11:55] is the person in the man God
[1:12:00] himself I I was hearing a someone told
[1:12:03] me a story long ago and I thought it was
[1:12:05] so amazing I don't know if they got it
[1:12:07] from a cartoon or something and so let's
[1:12:10] say there was this a mouse and the cat
[1:12:14] so the M the cat will always chase the
[1:12:16] mouse and it will go and run away and
[1:12:18] all those things and then all of the
[1:12:21] sudden the mouse goes and he St
[1:12:24] and then he goes on some wine and he
[1:12:26] drinks wine and he's all evil he's all
[1:12:28] drunk up so he comes out and the the the
[1:12:32] the the cat is trying to scare him off
[1:12:34] he's just looking at him the the the the
[1:12:37] cat strike him he Strikes
[1:12:39] Back the cat looks at him and said I
[1:12:42] don't want anything to do with this
[1:12:43] mouse and then it's instead of the the
[1:12:46] cat chesing the mouse the mouse now is
[1:12:48] chasing the cat I thought there was so
[1:12:50] some truth to it you know the problem
[1:12:53] with us is we are not drunk enough with
[1:12:55] the Holy Spirit the problem with us is
[1:12:57] we are not drunk enough with God what we
[1:13:00] need is to be drunk with God when the
[1:13:03] devil shows up when he says boo you say
[1:13:05] boo
[1:13:07] back when he say run you say you run
[1:13:10] when he comes and he shows up you cast
[1:13:13] him out because remember the army of God
[1:13:15] was given to cast out the devil when he
[1:13:18] brings diseases you cast him out you
[1:13:20] cast him out why because where he
[1:13:22] belongs under your
[1:13:27] feet we are not filled with God that's
[1:13:30] the problem but let it f with God come
[1:13:33] this morning and say God I want so much
[1:13:36] of you that when this devil shows up
[1:13:39] instead of me running he's going to be
[1:13:41] the one
[1:13:42] [Applause]
[1:13:45] running we are a people of an
[1:13:48] exodus we are not called to tremble
[1:13:51] before the devil the scripture says the
[1:13:53] devil will tremble before
[1:13:56] you when he hears that there's a Son of
[1:13:59] God involved well it's time to pck my
[1:14:01] bag because I know trouble is about to
[1:14:04] come the problem is we don't come with
[1:14:06] expectation we don't we we live far Bey
[1:14:10] below our means and we don't understand
[1:14:12] that there's a position that's been
[1:14:14] given to us that wherever that devil is
[1:14:17] within our family and our our relatives
[1:14:20] we can we can just find him and cast him
[1:14:22] out
[1:14:25] I said God I need to be drunk with you
[1:14:29] so much so much that it's no longer me
[1:14:32] but it's you it's the wine of the holy
[1:14:35] spirit in me working where I will do
[1:14:38] things that even my own mind to my
[1:14:40] better judgment will not do butam says
[1:14:43] the holy spirit will make you do things
[1:14:45] that you couldn't otherwise
[1:14:48] do go check it
[1:14:52] out we can't get the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:55] remain in this
[1:14:57] mind we
[1:14:59] can't the devil is all over just hecking
[1:15:02] havoc and we all they oh God oh God let
[1:15:04] me say this we cry out to God we speak
[1:15:08] the word to the
[1:15:10] devil remember that we cry out to God
[1:15:14] because we have need of him but when it
[1:15:16] comes to the enemy to the trouble we
[1:15:19] speak the word and we cast it out we
[1:15:21] don't cry out before the things of the
[1:15:23] world we don't cry out before the devil
[1:15:25] and say oh the devil go go no we cast
[1:15:27] him out in the name of Jesus
[1:15:34] Christ sorry I just don't know where I
[1:15:38] am
[1:15:52] anymore
[1:16:11] he this this
[1:16:16] morning I want to say this this
[1:16:21] morning we as the people of
[1:16:25] God we have to
[1:16:29] understand that the E an
[1:16:33] exodus is God's means by
[1:16:36] which he comes and I was thinking about
[1:16:38] it in terms of
[1:16:40] giber because if you really look at it
[1:16:44] it it Bears somewhat a resemblance of a
[1:16:47] going in so Exodus is coming out and
[1:16:50] going
[1:16:51] into jubile says I don't care what
[1:16:54] situation you were in there's a time
[1:16:59] set Jubilee
[1:17:02] said you can because let me say this we
[1:17:06] we make so much claim to the reason why
[1:17:09] we are in the shape that we are in and
[1:17:12] we lay so much weight into that my
[1:17:15] parents were divorc and this happened
[1:17:17] and I was cast down and I did this and I
[1:17:19] did that that that's that's all gone the
[1:17:23] what what matters is what did God said
[1:17:27] when did The Exodus start did did you
[1:17:29] hear anything at all because if you
[1:17:32] haven't heard you will only go in the
[1:17:34] cycle of the same thing or whatam calls
[1:17:37] the cycle of Revival and death you'll
[1:17:39] think you got it and then pretty soon
[1:17:41] you find yourself back what changes the
[1:17:43] dynamic from that cycle into a new cycle
[1:17:46] is you knowing that I have heard from
[1:17:50] God God has spoken to my life and is
[1:17:53] spoken into me I have heard that's why I
[1:17:56] am what I am today I can't go back even
[1:17:59] if I wanted
[1:18:03] to what I'm say this it
[1:18:06] says the you you you look at and I want
[1:18:09] to skip some that's why he's saying The
[1:18:13] Exodus then and The Exodus today he says
[1:18:16] before we can find out uh this Exodus
[1:18:19] means it says I'm going to type the
[1:18:22] Exodus then with the Exodus today now
[1:18:25] have you ever wondered how come the
[1:18:28] children of Israel find themselves in
[1:18:37] Egypt butam says it was because of
[1:18:40] jealousy of a
[1:18:42] brother because they rejected the
[1:18:48] spiritual because of
[1:18:51] unbelief God God sends them a
[1:18:54] prophet God in their own family Jacob's
[1:18:58] family there's one who's a Seer instead
[1:19:01] of them loving him for what gift God
[1:19:03] gave him they rejected
[1:19:08] him their own family just just think
[1:19:12] Human family today on Earth God sends a
[1:19:15] prophet messenger one who has the key to
[1:19:18] show you how you're going to get back to
[1:19:20] where you came from one who has the to
[1:19:23] come and open the door so we can get out
[1:19:25] of this P house so we can get out of the
[1:19:28] condition that we are in where we were
[1:19:30] born into
[1:19:31] it just think about it but there are
[1:19:34] those that will look at it and call it
[1:19:36] of the
[1:19:40] devil it says they went in there because
[1:19:43] of jealousy of a brother why because he
[1:19:46] was born spiritual he was Bor to lead
[1:19:49] them he was Bor to be there above them
[1:19:52] but but they didn't want to accept his
[1:19:55] position you say what is that has to do
[1:19:58] with me we do it every day
[1:20:02] am the prophet says this we find a way
[1:20:05] to go around it you know we find a way
[1:20:09] to give our own
[1:20:11] interpretation the prophet speaks
[1:20:13] something oh we have our own wisdom on
[1:20:16] how to interpret it I I don't need an
[1:20:19] interpretation if he said it he's the he
[1:20:21] he's the only Divine
[1:20:26] interpreter if the prophet said it don't
[1:20:29] let anybody tell you
[1:20:30] otherwise don't let anybody add more
[1:20:33] meaning to it if he said it it's exactly
[1:20:37] as he said
[1:20:38] it if God wanted it to say otherwise he
[1:20:41] would have said it
[1:20:43] otherwise if if you if you if you
[1:20:47] start playing with it then your
[1:20:50] destination
[1:20:51] changes
[1:20:53] and and that's what he said jealousy
[1:20:55] over the brother they they they want to
[1:20:57] some wants to lift thems up close to him
[1:21:01] some that want to put themselves in
[1:21:02] front of him say Well you come to me
[1:21:05] before you get to him no there's no such
[1:21:07] thing this word was given so he can fall
[1:21:10] on the ears of all
[1:21:13] believers it was recorded so he can
[1:21:16] speak to you directly not so I can come
[1:21:19] here and become your interpreter I don't
[1:21:20] want that
[1:21:23] right it's given so when you hear it you
[1:21:26] hear it from your own heart and God
[1:21:29] because remember the mouth of the
[1:21:31] Prophet is the mouth of God when he
[1:21:33] speaks is God's word it's not his own
[1:21:35] thought it's the mind of God being
[1:21:38] [Music]
[1:21:41] spoken but people want I'm going I'm
[1:21:44] going to read it but Ram said the order
[1:21:47] of Exodus was the pill of
[1:21:50] fire it was the cloud there was an
[1:21:53] anointed Prophet it says they were going
[1:21:56] by the anointing of the Prophet that's
[1:22:00] right it didn't say preacher Minister
[1:22:02] anybody no we go in by the anointing of
[1:22:06] the Prophet the moment you take yourself
[1:22:08] out of the anointing of a prophet you're
[1:22:11] going somewhere
[1:22:15] else wait what what's so hard in just
[1:22:18] saying what he
[1:22:19] said why I I think there's more value
[1:22:23] there's more honor there's more
[1:22:25] truthness if we can just repeat what he
[1:22:28] said instead of trying to put it
[1:22:29] ourselves in our different
[1:22:34] ways there there has to be the same
[1:22:37] heartbeat that beats in the prophet to
[1:22:39] beat in The Believer to beat into the
[1:22:42] minister that I don't want to vary for
[1:22:44] one second for one aota I want to stay
[1:22:47] as true as he said it because that's the
[1:22:50] only thing that will produce the result
[1:22:54] am now let me say this the purpose of an
[1:22:58] exodus is to bring you back into the
[1:23:01] promised land remember that the purpose
[1:23:04] of an exodus is to bring you back into
[1:23:07] to the promised land remember the
[1:23:09] scripture says that God cannot bless
[1:23:12] Israel outside of the
[1:23:15] Homeland remember that so when they were
[1:23:18] in Egypt it didn't matter if they
[1:23:21] prosper whatever happened to them they
[1:23:24] were not a blessed people as long as
[1:23:26] they were in Egypt the blessings was
[1:23:29] only to take place when they come back
[1:23:32] into the promised land and I want to say
[1:23:34] this to you Believers you have to
[1:23:37] understand that you are only blessed
[1:23:39] when you are in the word of the
[1:23:43] hour we compromise left and right and we
[1:23:47] come up with our own things and we we
[1:23:50] come up with things and God will not
[1:23:52] bless you unless what you do unless your
[1:23:56] life is lining up with the message of
[1:23:58] the hour now remember he said the
[1:24:01] sunshine doesn't mean God is with you
[1:24:04] neither the rain means God is against
[1:24:08] you Prophet spoke simple
[1:24:10] things it says under no circumstance a
[1:24:13] Believer can marry a
[1:24:16] nonbeliever but guess what we find a
[1:24:21] way now how do you expect to be blessed
[1:24:24] when you just broke the ordinance right
[1:24:27] there and then when Trouble Comes you're
[1:24:29] going to say God doesn't like
[1:24:33] you as Believers we conduct ourselves a
[1:24:37] certain way we do business a certain way
[1:24:39] we do this a certain way those things
[1:24:41] are given to you as your promised land
[1:24:45] they are not given as judgment to hold
[1:24:48] you from anything else no the devil is
[1:24:51] as is always the one offering a carrot
[1:24:53] look standing this is the line of the
[1:24:55] promise look if you just come over you
[1:24:57] don't even have to step over just get
[1:24:59] your neck here get it you'll still
[1:25:01] remain what did he tell Moses well we're
[1:25:05] going to compromise let's do this how
[1:25:08] about you go worship and come back Moses
[1:25:10] said
[1:25:11] no okay how about the man goes you can't
[1:25:15] take the children all the way over there
[1:25:17] with women you're going to drag them in
[1:25:19] the wilderness why don't you leave them
[1:25:22] behind and you guys go worship and
[1:25:23] you'll come back no why he always there
[1:25:27] to offer a compromise so you are not
[1:25:30] fully blessed but Moses looked at him he
[1:25:33] says we'll take everything we'll take
[1:25:36] our children our women our cattle
[1:25:38] everything that we own we'll worship God
[1:25:43] 100% oh I wonder if there's anybody here
[1:25:46] wants to worship God 100% I'll take my
[1:25:49] family I'll take everything that you
[1:25:51] have given me I I'll take my life I'll
[1:25:53] take everything I'll worship you
[1:25:57] 100% let's not
[1:26:00] compromise let's believe the word it
[1:26:03] will produce the reason it's not
[1:26:05] producing is because we've mixed it with
[1:26:07] other
[1:26:10] stuff that's why it's not a full
[1:26:13] Exodus but I believe God is here this
[1:26:16] morning to say the reason I'm calling
[1:26:19] you into an exodus is because you cannot
[1:26:22] be blessed outside of the Homeland and
[1:26:26] our homeland is the message of the hour
[1:26:28] and let me say there's walk into it
[1:26:30] there's so many blessings in it you
[1:26:33] don't need to go out God provides for
[1:26:35] his Believers you need something you
[1:26:38] pray God is obligated to his word you
[1:26:42] have something you need a job that will
[1:26:44] allow you to be on Church you need
[1:26:46] something you need whatever you need you
[1:26:49] ask him he's obligated because he knows
[1:26:51] if he doesn't give you you attempted to
[1:26:54] go outside he will provide so you can
[1:26:56] remain in the homand he's a good God He
[1:27:00] Loves Us he wants you to remain in the
[1:27:03] country he doesn't want you to go
[1:27:06] [Applause]
[1:27:14] out and you will
[1:27:17] say God goes even as far
[1:27:20] as to change the laws of a
[1:27:23] country just so you can come back in the
[1:27:27] Homeland think about that to what extent
[1:27:30] he will go he said he like a Shepherd
[1:27:33] who will take a sheep
[1:27:35] and work its leg so he won't go far
[1:27:39] Glory now you either want to walk with a
[1:27:41] broken leg or you just want to hear what
[1:27:44] he said and say father I'm just going to
[1:27:47] stay here I'll be like that child that
[1:27:49] didn't have to leave I don't have to go
[1:27:52] test of the world so I know the goodness
[1:27:54] of God I'm staying
[1:27:58] here it seems like God is only good when
[1:28:01] bad things happen no if you have good
[1:28:04] health it's the blessing of God if you
[1:28:07] can walk and your your members are
[1:28:08] functioning it's a good if you came this
[1:28:11] morning you walk up and you came it's
[1:28:13] the goodness of God we don't need to get
[1:28:16] into some situation near death
[1:28:19] experience to know God is good it's it's
[1:28:22] the same God it's not it's not it's not
[1:28:25] lesser here than it is over
[1:28:28] there
[1:28:29] hallelujah
[1:28:32] hallelujah the reason why he gives you
[1:28:34] something and it looks impossible to you
[1:28:37] is because number one we think with the
[1:28:39] human mind and number two because God
[1:28:42] wants to use the process of taking the
[1:28:44] impossible to possible to create a
[1:28:47] fellowship with you that's right to have
[1:28:50] fellowship with you he comes you're like
[1:28:53] father I can't I can't jump he said yeah
[1:28:54] I know I know you can't jump but I'm I'm
[1:28:57] here with you I told you Exodus I'm
[1:28:59] always going to my presence will go go
[1:29:01] before you I'm always my angel will go
[1:29:04] before you he will prepare the way so
[1:29:06] you can make it so jump I'm holding you
[1:29:08] I'm here with you you're not going to
[1:29:10] fall I give you my word so you jump now
[1:29:13] you have an experience now when you get
[1:29:15] next to the same another trial you know
[1:29:18] the father said there the word was true
[1:29:20] so the same father who said here he said
[1:29:22] that the word was true the word is true
[1:29:25] also
[1:29:28] here that's his goodness he wants to
[1:29:31] baby step Us in This Promise so we can
[1:29:34] get CH bigger and bigger and be able to
[1:29:36] overcome the land if the musician could
[1:29:48] come and let me say
[1:29:50] this
[1:29:53] we don't need to go outside of the
[1:29:57] Homeland you only going to come back
[1:29:59] with
[1:30:01] scars and bad
[1:30:03] memories and things that scars your life
[1:30:07] forever it's not worth
[1:30:11] it let his goodness for where you are be
[1:30:19] shown but mam said
[1:30:26] and let
[1:30:30] me if I get into this I probably won't
[1:30:32] have the time to stop but I just want to
[1:30:35] say
[1:30:37] this our pastor made a
[1:30:42] comment about the law that was passed in
[1:30:47] California about children he said if the
[1:30:50] parent interfere in the
[1:30:52] children desire to choose a gender or
[1:30:55] something like
[1:30:56] that that it's illegal it's going to be
[1:30:59] made illegal and it's going to be
[1:31:00] arrested or something like
[1:31:03] that I
[1:31:05] thought that must be somewhere in the
[1:31:07] Bible in the
[1:31:10] message now think of
[1:31:13] this we don't let our our kids carry
[1:31:16] guns right we don't we don't let them
[1:31:19] smoke we don't let drink beer we have
[1:31:21] all the limitation for everything else
[1:31:24] but yet we can let them choose the
[1:31:28] gender and Bam says
[1:31:31] here that the first order of areses was
[1:31:35] always to kill
[1:31:38] children first
[1:31:41] order I I want you to ponder the time we
[1:31:44] are living
[1:31:46] in you see in the first Exodus he had
[1:31:49] all the babies killed because he knew
[1:31:50] one would come and the second Exodus to
[1:31:52] try to get Jesus killed and here he says
[1:31:55] today spiritual death think about what
[1:31:57] they teaching kids oh you can have two
[1:32:00] mommies two daddies and two this what is
[1:32:02] it they're killing their mind in but
[1:32:06] getting them into their mind where they
[1:32:08] they are void of the word of God it's
[1:32:11] Exodus
[1:32:15] time this is
[1:32:19] real we we have to watch
[1:32:23] out the the the devil is not playing so
[1:32:26] we can't be playing we can't be the one
[1:32:29] that are not serious about what we have
[1:32:33] received the devil is coming full force
[1:32:35] and now is just killing but bom says he
[1:32:38] comes and he's just killing what is it
[1:32:40] he's trying to kill that
[1:32:44] seed but he said at the same time that
[1:32:47] rameses was doing all of that raising up
[1:32:50] he says the children of Israel God was
[1:32:52] RA raising up a Moses and I say we have
[1:32:55] received the word of Moses today we have
[1:32:58] a word that will overcome anything that
[1:33:01] the devil throws at us if he's going to
[1:33:03] kill our children we'll take our
[1:33:05] children and fill them with the word of
[1:33:07] God they'll be like that drunk Mouse and
[1:33:11] they will stand there the teacher will
[1:33:12] say it wouldn't get into them why
[1:33:14] because says when they come home when
[1:33:17] don't leave them like that take them the
[1:33:20] amount of time that you spend with them
[1:33:22] at home even if it's 10 minutes is
[1:33:25] enough to kill all of the things that
[1:33:26] they've taken into
[1:33:29] them why because it's your position it's
[1:33:32] the power that God has given
[1:33:36] you but if we take it we just say well
[1:33:39] you know the world is falling apart and
[1:33:42] iniquity is rising I don't even know we
[1:33:44] can talk about that
[1:33:47] anymore it's there's no time there's no
[1:33:51] place we can turn to and say well we
[1:33:53] still got no it's the
[1:33:56] end and I say we are an exodus people
[1:33:59] this morning if we could just within our
[1:34:01] heart and say God I know I'm in a lot of
[1:34:04] things I'm not supposed to be why don't
[1:34:06] you come and call an exodus in my life
[1:34:08] this morning take me step by I know
[1:34:11] there's probably too many things I don't
[1:34:13] know how to overcome them all but if all
[1:34:15] it takes is his presence to come down is
[1:34:18] him to come down he'll take you out of
[1:34:20] one two three however many it is he will
[1:34:23] take you out of all of them why because
[1:34:26] he promised in his word that he will do
[1:34:28] it let all stand this
[1:34:32] [Applause]
[1:34:38] [Music]

[1:34:46] more lately is become such a
[1:34:50] reality the things that we see in it
[1:34:53] and to see every day that everything
[1:34:56] that's happening out there we can go and
[1:34:59] find it in the
