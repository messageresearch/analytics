what a promise Lord Jesus not by anything that we could do Lord Jesus not by any strength that we could have any words that we could say Lord Jesus but father simply because you said it Lord Jesus and

I'm sealed we're not just saying my family is sealed in vain repetition father but there's an authority behind it because you spoke it first Lord Jesus and if we say it under that unction Lord Jesus under that Authority knowing that your word will go forth father and your spirit will bring it to pass Lord Jesus father I wait to see that manifestation in each and every single one of our Lives Lord

Father we leave the remainder of this time into your hands Lord Jesus thank you for all that you continue to do for us be with us now in the short time time we'll spend Lord I ask this in your precious wonderful and mighty name amen God bless you Saints um man I love to hear Shelly sing I don't know about y'all I was back there one more song but I guess two's enough if you're here Sunday I hope you sing again let's open our Bibles while we're standing to thank you musicians John CH 4 verse we're going to read from verse 7 to 10 if you're there say Amen the scripture reads there cometh the woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew asth drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knowest the gift of God and who it is that say thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Waters we'll turn again to Mark chapter 7 we're going to read in verse starting from verse uh let's see verse five we read this text the last time we spoke speaking about um message versus tradition understanding that you you you can't have one you can't have tradition and then use the tradition to try to make it conform to the word and to make the word fit how you see things and how you believe but either you have the message and its Purity unadulterated unmixed or you have tradition which is mixed it's something that man comes up with so we'll read it says then Pharisees and scribes asked him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashed hands he answered and said unto them well ha his Zas prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written this people honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of man for laying aside the command of God ye hold the tradition of man as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things you do and he saith unto them full well you reject the Commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition for Moses said honor thy father and thy mother and who so curse his father and mother let him die the death but ye say if I man shall say to this father and mother it is Corbin that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free and ye suffer him no more to do ought to his father or his mother I want to draw our attention to this verse here verse 13 making the word of God of none effect through your tradition which he have delivered and many such things like many such things like things do ye you may be seated may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word when we were when we were last here we spoke and touched on a little bit about tradition and and looking at the different aspects of tradition that it's it's a it's a learned trait it's something that's been taught over time passed down and often times when if we're not careful tradition slowly becomes law and it becomes something that you can pull for and draw from and claim that if it's not this way then scripturally it's wrong but I find you always have to bring back whatever it is that's being presented to you to the word filter it to the word give it a word test like a prophet would say if you can't find it in the word then leave it where it's at and in looking at things we saw that tradition is a very dangerous thing the scripture tells us that because of the man's tradition you've made the word of God of none effect and we understand that the prophet would speak in terms of tradition he speak about the spirit behind it that often times it's not necessarily what the the exact tradition is although not some are good some are bad but it's the spirit behind it TR tradition has such a power and such a hold on people that sometimes somebody could feel ostracized somebody could feel like for to give an example for for those who are may not all the way understand like in it's an American tradition that I'm not saying all of you participate in this tradition but just an example that sometimes there's a f family heirloom it may be a ring it may be something and it's passed down from generation to generation and they're expecting you to take that ring and if you're a man to propose with that ring to whoever is you find to be your mate and sometimes when you go away from those things and you don't choose to participate in that you may be looked at as someone going against the ways of the family someone going against something that's been established for years and I you know looking at the word I find it odd because brother Brandon would call us an oddball he would call us a called out people separated from the things of this world we don't have our identity in the things that goes on in this world we are believers of the end time message the way we do things the way we act the way we carry ourselves everything that we are is in accordance with the word so if the word that the prophet preached which is the revealed word of the hour it this it made this book into a new book it was no longer the same book that it once was so if this is a new book and it's a new way of living we We R read in the church age book where brother Brandon would say that this is not the old creation made over this is the new creation one that never was and Jesus Christ was the first of that race and we are coming into that existence he's adopting more Sons to come into that revelation of being true sons being like Christ was so if Christ wasn't the old made over then we can't now say we're going to take certain things from the way we used to do things and we're going to take this message we're going to mix it together where we see fit what whatever conforms with how I choose to live life I'll call that the word well that's not what happened in this day we received the prophet who had thus sayeth the Lord who had the way of living for you as a Believer the reason you're called a Believer is not for just happen chance it's not for the sake of just using the word but you are believer because you have accepted the word that's been preached to you and it's more than just accepting now it's a life being lived because Satan can knows this message Satan knows his message is true but he can't live it but you and I who have the ability to accept the message take the message and live by the message were called to a higher standard we'll look into the uh sermon brother Brandon preached and Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever paragraph 55 uh no 1955 806 paragraph 38 my apologies the script the the word says now notice why he did it listen why he did it listen at him when he addresses him Rabbi teacher see Rabbi we we who the Pharisees the religious world we know that thou are a teacher come from God this is Nicodemus speaking why because you got a degree no because you speak so eloquent no because that you are an educated man no because you belong to a certain denomination no we know that TH or a teacher come from God why because no man can do the things that you do except God was with him there you are not no man could teach the things that you do not no man could teach theology you you do not no man could do these things or teach the Bible like you do but no man could do the works that you do there's one thing to teach something there's another thing for God to confirm it and say it's the truth there's one thing to say something it's another thing to do something it's not hearers it's doers show me your faith without your works I'll show you my faith sayith Paul by my works if you believe it you'll act upon it that oh that's good that's it then your faith becomes works and God can go with you we'll stop for a moment here and draw your attention to this brother benam is saying here if you believe it you'll act upon it I wonder sometimes if we've gotten too comfortable and now we're trying to turn the the saying that I'm a I'm a message believer into tradition if we're just if we were just taking this word you know I believe in the message of the end time I believe in William Brandon he's the prophet I believe in Revelation 10:7 I believe in all these things these Mysteries that been revealed and all this word but where's the life that backs up the belief and that's what brother bandam is addressing here he said we know that your teacher come from God we Pharisees well why don't you come and join with me then why don't you believe me well of course we have regulation our regulation is a tradition of the elders which says if you don't belong to the Sanhedrin of denomination he read J Jerusalem well we be we all will be excommunicated and therefore we can accept it that's interesting they knew he was a man come from God they knew what he was doing that no man could do it but God but for the simple fact that it didn't happen the way they wanted it to they couldn't accept it I I I really want you to put yourself in the story right we we've received a message we've received Christ now what are we doing with this Christ that we've received if we're not careful we're doing the exact same thing that's being seen here oh I know it's true I know it's right I know I should live by it I know it's the way to get to heaven you know if I want to make a Rapture I got to believe this message and live according to it but yet there's no action behind it it gets really uncomfortable when it goes into your life and you start saying you know you ought not to be doing that you know you ought not to be living that way you know you ought not to be watching that speaking in that manner we got to take inventory look at your life what are you holding to if you don't have the actions of the word then where where are your actions at and yet was willing to admit it says and therefore we can't accept it and yet was willing to admit that no man could do the things that he did except God be with him brother brandom speaks in the sermon the infallibility of God's spoken word in 56 I I I really want us to as as I was looking at this I I couldn't help but see brother Brandon time and time again he's he's really trying to get us as people to understand that God can't really do anything with us so long as we're holding on to things that aren't relevant to what he's revealed you and if you're if you're not careful you'll think that you're walking in the Revelation but you're not really walking there because there's still still certain parts of your life that haven't fully been given over to the word we're trying to have a Oneness with the word to become one with the word you can't become one with something you don't feed on you can't become one with something that you don't listen to something that you don't have a relationship with it's the relationship with the word that brings the life of the word into your life but if you've got no relationship with the word then what good are you you're just like a tree when the wind comes you you move side to side when this happens you move here if a tornado comes by you get uprooted and moved but where's the foundation that keeps you in the word when trials and tribulations come you're supposed to have a word answer for things you're supposed to have a word action for things when things come but no because we're not grounded in the word because we're not living in the word and dwelling in it some times when things happen our action does not reflect the word but it reflects the man brother brandham says paragraph 43 so when he made a promise that Christ would come they believed it when Christ come he ought to be the greatest answer to this latter that I know of he talked one one time an Israelite in whom there's no G when Philip came to him and got saved he went out and got Nathaniel and measuring that off that's from where Jesus was preaching that day you had to go around the mountain way over several miles where he found Nathaniel under a tree praying here stood the Son of God people did many didn't believe it the poor people believed it the poor received them they believed it they believed in the Supernatural but the Orthodox the starchy all it's telepathy see they didn't believe it yet they professed they believe the word but believing in in the way of their tradition and believing it and believing it the way God wrote it was two different things butam says believing it in the the way of their tradition and believing it in the way God wrote it was two different things Jesus was coming the way God promised it Hallelujah and there he stands here a man of low estate born a human being standing with one robe in his lifetime poor not a place to lay his head how could this be Aristocrats God you see it couldn't be but he was God to the poor he was God to those who would believe him and though and there he stood there and Nathaniel he was so excited or Philip rather he went around about four or five miles around and behind the mountain and found Nathaniel under a tree praying so he just waited till he got through praying then he got up he said come see who we found Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph listen to Nathaniel's response how could any good thing come out of Nazareth you one might think what's this connotation that they have towards the people of Nazareth if we're not careful we start doing the same thing man what good could come from a Kian what good could come from an Indian what good could come from an American what good could come from an African you put whatever name you want to put on it when God does something through a man it's not the vessel in which you're looking at it's what's being said behind the vessel that's the focus he says what good thing come out of Nazareth I think he gave him the best answer I know of telling anybody he said come and see that's the best thing to do they say is there anything to that oldtime heartfelt religion come and see that's the best thing get some of it one time then you be the judge see that's our problem we don't want to get a taste we just want to sit back and judge and judge judge and judge and judge but you get away from the noise get away from the distraction of people having their opinion about this you know you're supposed to stand firm with the word if you've received a revelation of something and you know it's according to the word it doesn't matter what SE and so says it doesn't matter the pressures that are placed upon you oh you know for 2,000 years we did things this way for 3,000 I don't a million years we did things this way when this word came forth that we have in this hour it had to uninstall any idea that you had that you thought was right because every man was looking for the truth every man was looking for an answer but God gave that answer to one man when he begin to sound at his voice not the voice of mom not the voice of dad not the voice of Uncle not the voice of Pastor put whatever name you want there at his voice when he begin to sound the mysteries of God was finished brother brother Matthew last last Sunday was was was preaching and I I I had this in my notes before he spoke and I'm like man Lord You're Lord you're wonderful and and it it brought me to remember we're speaking about the spirit of tradition and and and how if that crepes in too much it'll stop you from receiving the word in its fullness in numbers in the story of Miriam and Aaron when they're going against Moses now think about the condition in which they're doing it in they're his siblings older so it's I'm big brother I'm I'm your I'm the eldest Uncle I'm the oldest this I you know I've been around a couple more years than you have I have a right to say this why would God speak to you you're younger than me you don't know more than me you've only been in this message how long and you're going to tell me what the message says what Authority do you have I've got experience I've been here 50 years more than you you could have been here a thousand years more than me when brother brandom says something I'm going to hold to it if you won't that's a you problem that's not me we have to have that kind of an attitude that we hold to the word and knowing whom we believe in and it it it it struck me because they were going against Moses because of the Ethiopian women whom he had married one might say they were right to go go against him did not the Lord say that it's unjust for an Israelite to be with somebody that wasn't an Israelite oh I see him doing wrong you know brother brandom spoke that one time and it didn't come to pass brother brandom said this thing one time and I can't quite see it in the word I don't know where he pulled it from I don't know how he got this I I want us to really understand there's a difference between us and that man he was born a prophet there was no studying that he had to do learn all the scriptures learn all this then the third he barely knew the things he said himself then who's speaking cuz what Authority was he speaking under if he barely knew what he was speaking of my goodness and he said hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses hath he not spoken also o by us and the Lord heard it that struck me we know the Lord hears everything and knows everything but he had to specify In This Moment he heard it now the now the man Moses was very Meek above all the men were upon the face of the earth and the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses and and unto Aaron and unto Miriam come out ye three into the Tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out and the Lord came down and the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the Tabernacle pillar of the cloud and called Aaron and Miriam and they both came forth and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant Moses is not so who is faithful in on mine house with him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches in other words not in Parables not in things that he doesn't understand no I'm breaking it down to him so he understands what he's speaking about and the similitud of the Lord Shall Behold wherefore then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses this mage message that was preached by William brandom is directly from God himself it has the answer for everything there's not one thing he didn't speak about I'll say it again there's not one thing he didn't speak about God made sure he didn't leave you any room to say oh no brother brandom never touched that subject so I'm going to keep on doing it the way I see fits he touched every subject everything the believer has need of to make a Rapture any decision you want to make business advice it's there F fatherly advice is there how to be a mother it's there we saw that through the posum we saw that through the mother Eagle time and time again anything you have need of it's an absolute for a reason your absolute has to have the answers if it doesn't it can't be your ab Absolut so if you have a question about something how do I go about this you look no further than the revealed word of the hour the prophet didn't speak of his own opinion I I I I have to I have to say this point I was I was hesitant but I have to the prophet didn't speak an American message oh but he's American you know he was born in Kentucky he had no education but he could outspeak you and I certain languages he would use you would say vernacular you like how did you learn that with your education where it stopped the understanding you have of science the comprehension you have of things this was more than a man do do you honestly believe that God would send a message and tailor it to a specific culture to a specific specific way of leaving of living I don't I don't believe in a god like that he told us from all Kindred from all kinds they would all come under one headship when that Capstone came down it didn't say you know you know I have I have an American message I have an Indian message I have an America I have an African message now you believe according to what your culture is you believe according to your culture you believe according to your culture what what are we doing are we picking at straws guessing the same message that saves the white man is the same message that saves the black man that saves the Indian man that say it doesn't matter what the race is this message is the same it told you how to do everything it called you out of your Traditions it called you out of your way of thinkings in a little while you'll hear the prophet really speak about the hindrance that tradition has on the believer how it's hard for God to reveal himself to a Believer because they hold on to things past to the ways of doing things we got to be careful very careful let's go to the sermon the Seal of Christ preached in 55312 brother random says in paragraph 14 now over in the book of Ephesians we read what the Seal of God is what the Seal of the devil is now in Hebrews first we will go to the Seal of God for if we disbelieve willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin if truth has been presented oh Hallelujah Jesus Christ came to Earth to present truth and not only TR present truth he was the truth and the religious people of that day said now we know that he is has mental telepathy we realize that he's reading their minds out there draw the parallel in the ministry but we believe that all of his healings and things he does is only by the devil because he don't agree with our denomination so they said he's a devil do you know what another word for denomination is tradition you have to study these things if you are not careful you will miss the very thing that God is trying to tell you this isn't William brandom speaking to you this is God through the voice of William brandom speaking to you this is a love letter to you the individual it speaks to you my sheep hear my voice some hear a man some he hear faults some hear mistakes misinterpretations but his sheep hear his voice his voice has no mistakes it's got no Faults behold I come in the volume of the bookall he says J said now you can say that against the son of man for you've you've got the truth presented to you you really know it's the truth in other words Nicodemus expressed it said we know Rabbi thou are we who the Pharisees the very ones that studied the word and knew the word understood the word they knew he was Rabbi a teacher we know that thou are a teacher come from God my if you won't accept him as a man come from God the world will we know it for no man could do the things like you do L God was with him and we know that you're a teacher come from God and I had to slip up here in the night time to get to talk to you in other words can you get to that next part oh tradition separating Man by their Traditions oh my brother brandham says in proof of of his resurrection 55 now the in uh parag 20 now man in his carnal condition and his mental conception he always pulls away from God it's been since the beginning that man longs to see the other side but he's Bound in a prison house sometimes tradition of man puts him there that they teach traditions of different forms and motives of how to worship and he puts men under bondage under in his tradition and that has been since the world began since the world began this has been he puts them under bondage I I find it funny when you look at it you go back to the beginning like brother Brandon would say here the Beast is offering Eve the ability to be like God to know like God to understand stand like God wasn't she already made in the image of God did not God give full authority to Adam in the beginning was he not God on Earth and yet he's being offered the chance to be God there's a perversion somewhere he already had his authority if we're not careful we will accept another offer for something God already gave you he gave you the authority to take the word wherever you see Satan find them get them out get rid of them if you're not careful you'll accept the substitute that'll kill you rather than taking the path which God gave you accept another man's opinion for there is a way that seem it just to a man and the end thereof is death take the word leave all other opinions out they don't belong it's an opinion for a reason we have a fact in this message God said it William Bram spoke it I believe it that settles it he he says but man always long to see the other side and any little thing that looks a little Supernatural the human being will run for it because it's some sort sort of a promise across the border just across the lane and what makes him do that is because he is created in the image of his maker almighty God he's created to be a worshipper of God and he must find some place to give an outlet to that feeling you see the makeup of man you were made to worship Christ in the sermon thirsting for Life brother Bram said God made every man man to thirst after him but man finds different things to quench that thirst dancing I didn't say it he said it looking SP and span all the time and he lists a bunch of things and he says man always tries to find something to quiet that voice quiet that thirst but the only thing that's been given to quench that thirst is Christ himself don't substitute that thirst you have in your life that hunger you have the devil the devil is Sly he comes in ways you least expected we hear it time and time again he's not The Devil in horns he may come in the form of your neighbor he may come in the form of your brother in the form of your sister I'm not calling your brother or your sister the devil but Jesus said depart from me Satan why because the word that was coming out was not from God he called it what it was be real careful not to crucify your own proof of his resurrection 1955 brother brandom says in paragraph 29 but man has longed to know him down through the age they've longed to know him in our text this morning our My Redeemer liveth in the early Sunday service we find out that there that joob as old as he was and way back in the first beginning he longed to know his creator in other words he said if I could knock on his door and talk to him how the human heart has longed for such things and today after 4,000 nearly 5,000 years more how much more the human heart today longs to go to his door knock at his door get acquainted with him I identify with that and then people through Traditions has blinded men from the Great great fundamental truths of the scripture now Jesus spoke the same thing when he was here on Earth he said ye are blind leaders of the blind he said if the blind leads the blind won't they all fall in the ditch now pronouncing Christian or religious teachers blind see I want to draw our attention to this God has a way of revealing himself to the people and making himself known to the people but many times s tradition shuts off the people before God can get a chance to get into them to reveal himself you get it see Traditions oh what that is today you should hear when brother Brandon is saying this that's the importance of listening to The Voice you'll hear the emphasis on where he's trying to make you can read here exclamation point and see that he probably screamed tradition but I would go back and listen there's an importance in listening you'll catch something but here he says God has a way of revealing himself to the people how many of us would like to have God reveal himself to us personally I testify I want that I want to know him as he is known but what am I holding to that's stopping me or in other words stopping him from getting to me he wants it from me more than I wanted he wants to make himself known to you he wants to become one with you he wants to reveal to you the Finer Things in life the great Mysteries the secrets that others don't know he wants to speak to you this is a love affair but how can he if we keep holding on to tradition it shuts you off from him I did didn't say it we heard it but many times tradition shuts off the people before God can get a chance to get into them Christ Living in is that not the hope we have in this hour that Christ might come and make his home in you and live the life in you you can't live this life by your strength you can't live it by your might you can't live it by your intellect you can't live it by your knowledge you've got to live it through Christ Paul said I Die daily I must decrease so Christ must increase the trouble man has had since the beginning of time is the understanding of God in a man that was God in a man it didn't stop there he was the first first fruit to come to maturity don't leave him in the Box what we saw in him Christ wants you to lower yourself enough that he might come and live in you and reveal himself then you become a partaker of that son of man Ministry you're the continuation of it but it can't happen so long as you're holding on to things that aren't profitable to you it's due time we start uninstalling the practices of old if we can't find it in this message get rid of it I'm sorry I don't know what to tell you if it's not in this message get it out did not the prophet say take the token and apply it in your home wherever you see the devil kick him out he spoke the truth if you have a TV in your home what did he say about it kabah is written at your door the glory of the Lord has departed but we'll come in and explain it away well I have it for this reason I have it for that reason brother brandom said if it's in your home the glory of the Lord has departed we have to start taking what he says for face value stop trying to find an excuse to continue living a partial life this message was meant to be lived sold out look at our Prophet look at the example he set coming from a home that that that was in alcohol father was making and brewing things look at the condition he grew up in you show me the trace of that in his life when God gets a hold of you and gives you a revelation you're no longer identified with the things of the past you are a completely new being Lord I want to die out to me I'm the culprit I'm the one that gets in the way M understanding my way of doing things I think this is right I think this is wrong well you know I have more life experience I can tell you the things that are better for you and yet still disregard the advice of the Prophet as if it was just the man speaking to us I'm speaking to myself here if you find yourself in that place take it this word is no respector of person The Man Behind here doesn't know more doesn't live any higher we're all on the same footing no big eyes no little use we're all called to live this message in its entirety not in partial in its entirety we'll say the rain falls and the just and the unjust the same rain that gives life to the wheat gives life to the weed it doesn't do away with the rain that the wheat needs it just shows what you are the prophet of God said a Believer when the doors are open is in church that doesn't eliminate the three kinds of Believers but don't use that as your excuse to not be in service you are the believer being Church what's it to you if the one next to you comes to church every service and doesn't live the life you're called to live the life you're called to be the example show them that you can stand in the word live the life and obey every single commandment that's been given to us by the prophet we read it to read it to you here last time brother brandom said if you love him you'd be there in church you'd be there in the prayer services you'd be there if you love him oh my isn't love showing up if you if you if you work all day I'm I'm entering into territories I Haven no idea of if you work all day I can imagine if you don't come home at a certain time you'll get a call I see it from the brothers I work with where you at honey oh we're almost done I might be late today why she wants to see you or if it's vice versa he wants to see you what do you think happens here at church where two or three are gathered in my name there in the midst I'll be how many opportunities have you missed to meet Christ oh I'm fighting I'm going through this I'm going through that I'm going through this it's so hard how do I get out of it how do I get out of it what if the answer you needed was you being in the house of the Lord and something would come not from the man but from God that he would speak through the man and give you an answer to the problem that you have but no we have this greater than thou attitude I have already made it I already lived the life why do I have to come to church I'm the true Christian I live it you see how that statement contradicts you're the True Believer but you don't come to the house can you make sense of it oh you know I I I'm you know I I'm I'm rich I'm rich I'm rich but I live under a bridge I'm not sick I'm not sick I'm not sick doctor I have Corona virus give me medicine you're not sick no no no no you don't understand I'm sick give me medicine if you're a Believer if you've accepted the message message of the hour brother Brandon was the first fruit to come to maturity we're in agreeance did he not make it his obligation whether he was speaking or not to be in service if our Prophet could live that kind of a soldout life what about us we we've got to remove this this traditional mindset that if I've made it I don't need anything no you need him so long as you're alive you need him we've seen G many of Great Men Who who are in this message preach this message fall away and you think that because you've already made it you don't need to come to service it's the sacrifice you make he said it in this in the sermon uh I'm I'm I'm forgetting I'm forgetting the sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel he said it's the sacrifice you make to come to church that gives way for God to bless you I come to church not so God can bless me financially I want to specify that I'm not here so God can bless me financially I'm in church because a Believer is post of Duty is church I'm a church goer Wednesdays you won't find me Sundays you don't need me I will be here this is where I belong and it's not just the life I live here but it's taking that life going home and now living that life what good is it if you come to every service it's true the prophet said Church don't save you so don't think because you mark your presence every single Sunday every single Wednesday that you're making progress no what's required in this day is a life lived a sold out life lived for Christ God's word calls for total separation from unbelief don't stand in the presence of the son with an umbrella how will you ripen the sun's effect is not on you oh Lord how many times I walked into this building and the Word was being preached and I had an umbrella of what I think was right that don't concern me I'm good that's not for me I'm good get out of the umbrella long enough for God to let the light shine on you and change you brother brandham says in the sermon proof of his resurrection that same sermon paragraph 143 now we don't we didn't know that good people loving him but didn't know that he was risen from the dead so is it today same thing today exactly brother sister oh my God wake your innermost being people don't understand that he has raised from the dead he's not dead He's Alive and he walked out under disguised to them in the form of a man he might appear to you in the form of your neighbor he might appear to you in the form of a minister or your mother Christ appears to you in people be real careful when somebody gives you the word it could be a 2-year-old it could be a three-year-old it could be 80 it don't matter the age the word stays the word and if you're a Believer when the word spoken to you you accept it if you're not checking up you make it right and you press on don't get in the habit of disregarding somebody for the sake of the age I'm older than him our Prophet said he may appear to you in a neighbor in a brother in a minister in a mother don't be so high and mighty and set in your ways that you fail to see when Christ is speaking to you oh but you're speaking man it's just it's just us it's just us the same problem happened with the prophet here the pum is at his door needing to be prayed for and he's so set on other things that he fails to realize that posum came at your door like every other person comes to be prayed for he thought she had I think rabies he just wanted to you offer so she could go in peace without suffering but she needed to be prayed for and he received the Revelation and he prayed for her and she got well and went with her babies don't miss when Christ is trying to speak to you in whatever vessel he uses you could be at work and the most sinful person on this planet why are you here on Wednesday don't you go to church hey I used to always hear you play a tape why' you stop man you used to be all about Christ you used to be all about God but why are you going out with us where's the standard if we not careful we start ass simulated when we're supposed to stand out be different we are a called out Bunch United under the message of this hour which is none other than Christ in word form says Christ in you says go up a little bit then treat everybody right be kindly be neighborly be loving Christ is in the person Christ in you the hope of glory and as you go along and people appear to you a kind of person speak to you listen to them you don't know it might be Jesus speaking to you he appears I'll be with you even in you and as you do unto these you do unto me oh when you get to looking at it that way the old tradition Falls away see it doesn't become a form of words and the Declaration of so many words put together it becomes a living reality that Christ is in us now the Holy Spirit moving back and forth through every human being surging through the hearts searching condemning the ruins in there and as you confess it he holds it before God and the blood cleanses it Amen brother brandom says I'm coming to a close close here in the sermon the unpardonable sin paragraph 49 preached in 54 uh 1024 parag 49 he says the first thing when somebody tells me or I pick up on a recording that I have seen a vision and foretold something before I say anything about it the vision anything first I check that the vision is with the word of God and if it isn't according to the word of God I'd say it's so far thanks be to God it's always been according to the word but if it ever be contrary to the word of God I'd say don't listen to it because it's false this is the truth right here the word of God then when we come sanely sound to God when we come without any malice any Prejudice with an open heart willing to learn learn God is able to teach when we are willing to learn but we must first lay aside tradition lay aside ideas that we've been taught now I know mother taught you things that was very good and so forth but sometimes mother had things wrong I've got a mother sitting right here the very subject I'm coming to in a few minutes told me years ago that she thought the unpardonable sin was a woman was for a woman to abortion abortion case in other words take the life of a child for it was born said how could she ever be forgiven it mama in her best of her knowledge to all she knew that was true see but it isn't true according to the word of God so that makes a difference so someone said I was born a Catholic mother was a Catholic she raised me a Catholic I'll stay a Catholic well I was raised up a Baptist but I didn't stay a Baptist when I seen the word of God said contrary to what the Baptist Doctrine was I believe the word of God and let every other man's word be a lie that I don't fell out with man I say brother this is what I believe I'm still your brother but I believe this is the word of God now when you get settled Foundation Al right then you have boldness to enter in this isn't a stretch but you can take off that word Catholic you can take off that word Baptist and you can place your ethnicity I was born African I was born this I was born that wherever you're from put it there brother bam says but when I seen the word of God was contrary to those beliefs in which I was born in what do you do as a Believer that's a lie every word of God is truth and man's is a lie when you find out that the way of doing things see because it's the spirit of tradition it's not necessarily the thing it's the hold that the spirit of tradition has on a believer in so much the prophet could tell you you one thing and for the sake of him being a white man you'll throw it off and say they have their American tradition of things did not our Prophet say before I'm an American I'm a child of the king did he not say I was I was he was born a brandom he didn't become one go further I was Christ's before I became a brandom what about you what about me what's your identity my identity isn't where I was born that's the identification of the flesh my identity is Where I Come From behold I come from God and I'll go back to God I'm here for a season to live out my life in this season I'm to be a pillar a standard that no no matter what background I came from no matter what trials and struggles I came from when I met this word it changed me I was no longer those things but I became a Son of God we really got to watch it let's let's let's turn back to that scripture in John I I got a a lot more quotes but I I I feel I've gone long enough maybe another time we we see here that give me one second in John John 4 my my mistake if the musicians could come John 4:7 here we have the the the women of Samaria and as I as I was reading this you know because when when you read the Bible you don't read it like a book you when when you read it you're reading it with a desire to understand for God to reveal and speak to you it's a conversation when I read my Bible it's not me just reading it for an ordinance sake so as as I was reading this I had a question in my heart I said well the scripture says how is it that thou being a Jew asketh drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans well the Samaritans and the Jews there's a fundamental disagreement they they're they they're not of Kindred Spirits they both knew the words that were spoken by the prophets of old but the Samaritans had mixed in with with the unequally yolked so they were half Jew half non-jew and as Jesus here sends his disciples go away and he goes to that woman I have need to go by Samaria him being Jew by when you look at him says why what business does do you Jew have speaking with me it must have been years and years of an idea of a system of a tradition that you stay away from these kind of people because they're not like you and yet she's faced with God himself speaking to her woman give me a drink and it stumbles her she couldn't look past in that moment for a second what she was looking at let's be real careful Saints let's not make the same mistake let's not just look at what the vessel looks like but let's look at the words that's being spoke and Jesus speaks to her and says if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that say it to thee give me a [Music] drink that Prophet stood there I'm your brother I don't speak these things of myself the angel told me in the back to say this to you if we're not careful we start doing the same thing and not know it we start looking at him what business do you have that's what the Full Gospel businessman did to him here they were supporting him when he's doing all the signs and wonders and the Miracles and so forth and the moment he starts opening up that word to break bread to speak those Revelations those strong Meats they say oh leave that alone we don't want to hear that just go back to the Divine Healing campaigns go back to that go back to that they didn't want to hear it because it was condemning them let's open our hearts to understand and know when someone's speaking to us the word of God that we accept it it says and he would have given them Living Water the woman said unto him sir thou H has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then H has thou that living water are thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whatsoever whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life here he is speaking life to this [Music] woman if you if you remember in the beginning when mzc came to visit Abraham and he tells him according to the time of life I'll visit you when he said those words the change was on she was changing after the words were spoken to her in this day we had a messenger with the word from God that when it was spoken to you the believer and you heard it it started to change you it's still changing you don't hinder it when things get uncomfortable and the prophet starts touching on things that you've held on for so long and for years and you just feel is right but the prophet's really speaking about it don't get in the Shell open your heart this is open heart surgery unless you open yourself how do you expect to be dealt with he says the woman said unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus said unto her go and call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus and said and Jesus said unto her thou has well said I have no husband for thou has had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that sayest thou truly the woman said unto him sir I perceive that thou are a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet in Jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what you know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him I know that mess is cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he oh church we heard a greater than Solomon is here we heard a greater than all of them is here who is here in our midst now I that speaketh un to thee is he and upon this came the disciples and marveled he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or what talkest thou with her the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and saith unto men come see a man come see a man which told me all the things I ever did is not this the Christ and in this hour we receiv received the sign when that word was preached it called me by name it told me how I was living it was wrong and what I was called To Live By it quite literally spoke me into existence let's not handle the word lightly let's not just take it as another book as another man just speaking you heard Christ in this day do the very same thing he did to Abraham he turned his back told him what Sarah was doing in the tent and you had a man in this hour turn his back let's not mistaken what took place you saw Christ doing the same sign Christ in a man doing the same sign because it was promised that we would have our chance hallelujah what an assurance it gives us and you notice with the woman after what took place with her after the change it didn't matter that she was Samaritan anymore she told anybody who could hear it come see a man oh what's it to you that they've been in jail their entire life what's it to you the devil's been attacking them for so long what's it to you they've lost their mind what's it to you they've become what they've become what's it to you she's a prostitute whatever the case is what Christ has done in you is not meant to be quieted you're you're meant to say It on the Mountain you're supposed to show he's alive and well the same yesterday today and forever the god that did that is now living in me and you wanting to do the same thing for somebody else open your hearts to receive him let him have his way let him live that life through you that you might show that sign to somebody you know you have the gift of discernment brother randam said give me two minutes with a person I'll tell you what kind of spirit they have that wasn't just to him you a Believer your spirit isn't okay when you're in the presence of somebody who doesn't believe the way you do when you find yourself in a place where music is being played that you know ain't right there's a reason your heart aches to leave there's a reason this isn't the place I should be at if you're not hearing that voice you need to quiet the other voices in your life and let that voice be the centner voice that speaks to you let's stand our our hearts gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus father I feel I I I said exactly what you have put on my heart to say Lord Jesus father I had much more to say Lord Jesus but what's important isn't me speaking Lord but you now going father and ministering to the heart of the individual Lord Jesus father we thank you Lord Jesus father help us to tear down our Traditions Lord Jesus to tear down our ways of Living Lord Jesus that are not in line with the word of the hour Lord Jesus help us to be trueborn message Believers walking in the light of the age your Prophet admonished us and said you can't see further than your eyes and in this day the prophet is our eyes he's the Seer how can we see further than he saw it's not so Lord Jesus but father open our eyes to see what it is that he saw Lord Jesus that we might live according to the word according to what was presented to us in this hour father let this word right now father go into each and every single one of our Lives father make us Lord Jesus into your word father let us not be ineffectual Lord Jesus but let us be effective Believers because we've accepted your word and we've chosen Lord to walk according to your word father help our unbelief Lord Jesus help our small mind Lord Jesus oh Father often times we just think we have the answers to everything Lord Jesus we just think we know everything Lord that when you speak in a still Small Voice Lord Jesus we just we just disregard it Lord Jesus father I am the number one culprit father the times and times you've spoken to me and I've just disregarded it Lord Jesus father I'm sorry Lord father help me to be a better servant Lord Jesus help me to surrender myself more Lord Jesus help me to be more of an example Lord Jesus that when the word is presented that I take it and do all that I can to live it Lord Jesus not by my strength but by the knowing that when your word comes forth and I amen it I'm saying so be it letting you come and live it for me Lord Jesus father uninstall our ideas uninstall our principles that we have Lord the things that we we've come up with oursel we've mustered up Lord unmixed the things we've tried to add to this message you gave us a pure unadulterated message Father except we receive it the way it came it can't have the effect Lord Jesus help us Lord Jesus be with every single person in this building Lord Jesus father in that sermon power of Resurrection towards the end your Prophet said in a moment you're going to see that Christ is still the same and you started Discerning the thoughts and intent of the hearts telling them where they came from what sickness they had and that they were healed Lord Jesus father we have that problem right now that if we take you by your word whatever it is we have need of has been granted Lord Jesus father I claim it Lord Jesus thank you Father thank you Lord Jesus I ask this in your precious and wonderful and holy name amen [Music] [Music] amen let's just sing that tonight amen Lord I come to you let my heart be Chang from the grave all that I found in [Music] you hallelujah oh Lord I've come to know the richness say I see oh and oh and will be Stripped Away by the power [Music] your oh hallelujah oh and let your love around me oh I'm oh and draw me to your draw me to [Music] your I arise of like and E go and I [Music] will the power of you love sing that second oh and Lord I'm let me see your F oh and F oh and knowledge of

I'll rise up I can hallelujah oh and and I will with you your spirit leads me on and Power Of You [Music] Lord hallelujah amen aren't you thankful for the word amen always drawing Us near amen giving us our Tru true identity of who we really are where we came from amen but Satan is always trying to inject things by the way we grew up and this is how you do it you know speaks about anything that stands in the way of the word of God is human tradition whether it be how we were born or you know some will take the Bible and you know but when them talk and say they take the word of God they read it and they say this is what it means and they stop right there that's man's tradition because God is his only interpreter he will take a scripture give you one meaning today and you come tomorrow he gives you another why it's the Living Word of God and he's the only one who can interpret it for you and he because he wants you to live by it he doesn't want you to have everything already said in your mind this means this this is that no he wants to be your daily interpreter when you woke up in the morning he gives you an interpretation of what he wants for your life that day he guides you he leads you and I want to say this men's tradition will only produce death at the very end of it it will produce death but God's word will produce life why because he's going to unfold by taking the word of God we are allowing him to unfold it and bring exactly what he meant for for our lives but will say the end time message will produce the end time results and and I love what what our brother said they there's not a question we have that God has not given us an answer and often time the mistake that people make is they will go try to find their specific problem by the specific wording of It Go God can speak you with the cover to you on the C just by reading the Holy Bible and whatever question you had is answered he he speaks he you will be reading one scripture and all of the sudden it pops up and then an answer come from whatever you had need of and I want to say this tonight the answer to remove us from tradition is the Revelation all we need is Revelation from him father I I don't know what this means and I don't understand this let him be the revealer of his own word to you if if we walk by Revelation we're walking by truth we shall live if we walk by our own definition by our own understanding we shall die the way that seeth right unto man the end of that road is death but the word of God the revealed word of God understand that these men that took the same Bible they form all of these denominations we see around the corner so it's the revealed word of God by the prophet Messenger as our brother said he comes and he brings the very revelation of what that word is if you live by that you shall never die oh God help us tonight let's not have our own interpretation our own meaning our own definition where people come and you know they have their own every time you say a word they have a definition of all that means no let God be his own interpreter let God interpret your life yes Lord I don't know what I'm here for I don't know what you call me for he can take it and give you a meaning for for your life and tell you exactly what you were born for what you are here to do what your mission is what the statement is for you but we got to separate ourselves from our tradition for our own understanding the word of God is a separator when you hear it it causes conflict between what he said and what you knew and the child of God looks at everything he knew and says this all goes into a trash and I'm following the leading of the spirit I'm following the revealed word of the hour so it can give me my true identity is that your heart desire or not I say father come speak to us make your word a reality to us that's what we desire Above All Things amen what ke that amen amen lily of the valley let your sweet Ro my Hallelujah Rose of Sharon show how to
