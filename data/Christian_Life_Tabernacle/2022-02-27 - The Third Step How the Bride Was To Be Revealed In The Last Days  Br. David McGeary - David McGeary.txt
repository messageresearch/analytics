========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um good morning i just want to make a couple announcements before we started service it's going to be really really long today so anybody that wants to leave can good again no it's not we're going to play 11 minutes of tape and it'll probably take us three weeks to get through those 11 minutes but anyway as you know as pastor that we have we wear many different hats and we have many different roles we're the spiritual director of course of the church we're the music director we're the chief financial officer and we're also the chief of police and so today i want to talk to you about a traffic problem as chief of police we have a traffic our problem and so what's happening is uh i don't understand this exactly but it i guess it's the interpretation of church language and so in church language when we invite the musicians somehow that's interpreted it's time to go to the bathroom so what we have is we have the musicians coming this way and everybody that wants to go to the bathroom going that way at the same time and as you know that are our aisles and things in the church are all set up one way you're either coming in or you're going out that's sort of like the gospel you know what i mean and so we need to we need to also realize that usually at the end of the service when they're going to start playing the music and the musicians come you know that's the time the holy spirit is dealing with hearts he waits till after the word and then he comes down and starts convicting and working on hearts now i don't really know if everybody has to go to the bathroom or they're just running from the conviction and the presence of the lord either way it it's causing this traffic problem that we're having you know so you and if you notice the aisles are rather small and i know that all of us are very thin and uh people so but because still some of us it's hard to cross in such a narrow space so before that you want to leave out from under the conviction of the holy spirit please let the musicians all take their place and all start playing and then you can slip out and and go to the restroom or whatever that you want are doing uh so we we we want to kind of make that understand also to help with the uh the traffic thing to the best of your ability if the musicians could sit on the side of the instrument that they play and then we don't have the crossing over so sometimes we'll have musicians that play these instruments sitting on this side and put musicians that play these instruments and so they're going this way and people are going that way and people are going this way and it's you know and i'm sitting here going you know or who's ever here so we can fix that easy right everybody has that so that's an announcement as a chief of police also now as music director another hat that we wear we are uh we have many people that desire to play an instrument and so uh we're gonna rotate musicians periodically so nobody feel like uh this is my spot and i'm the this i'm the trumpet player or i'm the tuba player you know what i mean we don't have first chair you know what i mean that's uh anybody that's ever played music how many knows what first chair means all right so that means you're the top chair you're number one but we don't have that we don't go by talent we go by people that feel led of the lord to serve the lord so we certainly want to let you know that if you have a hearts desire to play instrument we will try to work you in periodically and then we have some people that would will only play when there's nobody else and so we're grateful for that so we just want to let you know a few of those things uh i didn't want to do it during the service so i just thought i'd take a moment so help us with that if you can and so again just always wait until the musicians are are all seated and played playing before you have to leave the sanctuary and then also be very sensitive to the holy spirit if the holy spirit's moving and because you never know the best thing that could ever happen is someone to come under conviction and realize they need the lord and and surely we don't want to have somebody that god's dealing with and then somebody pushing by him saying you know i just go just sensitive to the holy spirit sensitive to what's happening in the sanctuary let every let all the musicians make their way to the instruments and then as uh if you really are in that situation uh you know we always had a saying around you know and i hope i that this say this is not your revenue in any way but we always had a saying go before you go you know what i mean and so you know i know that so you know you can do it so anyway we just wanted to take care of that just makes it help in the meetings when we had so many people here it was really hard but it's still difficult with what we have so lord bless you and just be in prayer we won't be long this morning it's nice to see every everybody here there's a little baby dedication coming up so lord bless you and me and bill are gonna go back and pray and we'll go back to planes to music so you can quickly get back in the spirit and then we'll have worship and the word and and just have a wonderful time in the lord you love the lord today hey amen it's good to see our brother back almost from the dead huh dylan's back with us today we love you dylan here let's stand up and get killed don't stand up amen

[Music] amen god bless you this morning welcome everyone in the house oh god it's invite buddy mike for some reading and then all our visitors are certainly happy to have you with us amen morning i'm going to read psalm 57 this morning and uh you know that little note might be in your bible as it is in mind kind of the beginning of the chapter there's a little note there that says that this was something that david wrote when he fled from saul in the cave and you know you know you know the story david was really nothing he was a shepherd boy the youngest of all the littlest of of of a lowly family and uh one day he was running errands for an army that he could not qualify for and ended up defeating an enemy that the biggest man in the camp was afraid of and very quickly he became public enemy number one for the king you know he found himself on the run for years he went from place to place in the wilderness going from a cave here to a stronghold here to a mountain here you know and saul poured everything he had into scouring the land trying to find him he was so obsessed with this one individual that he used his entire army and scoured every inch of the land and it got to the point where he began threatening his own people you know if they were to help him he killed all the priests in one town alone all because saul was afraid of losing his position you know here he was committing everything he had to find this one little man you know is it a desperate act to protect his position and try to keep the word of god from being made manifest because a word had been spoken over david you know it's amazing the lengths that men will go to to protect their little kingdoms even in the face of thus saith the lord it says in first samuel 23 14 it says in david abode in the wilderness in strongholds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of zif and saul sought him every day but god delivered him not into his hand what's amazing is he used his entire reign his entire reign became about chasing this one man with all that effort god never delivered him into his hand you know think of that you know to me that's kind of you know he had all the resources at his disposal he was a king he had an entire kingdom and he still couldn't get him you know we live in a similar hour you know there's an enemy out there that's putting all his focus on one little group and why is that because he knows that one day there will be a people that will dispossess him of his kingdom you know and in his desperate final hours he is in the process of utilizing every resource in his kingdom to scour the earth to lay hold of you and keep you from dispossessing him of his kingdom but though the enemy sought him every day god delivered him not into his hand you know the first verse of psalm 57 says this it says be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed you know while david might have been hiding temporarily in caves or mountains or strongholds where his real refuge was was not in the cave wasn't in the stronghold it was in the shadow of his wings you know but the portion of the verse that caught my attention here was that phrase until these calamities be overpassed you know that could be true for anyone who finds themselves in the shadow of his wings you know it doesn't mean that calamities aren't going to come you know it doesn't mean that there won't be any trouble but what it means is they will pass over until they be over passed you know in spite of the fact that there's an enemy the ruler of a kingdom who can throw every resource at one little individual to try to make him his singular focus the calamities wouldn't be the end of him that some point they would overpass those that are in the shadow of his wings see the backside of the calamity you know that phrase to be overpassed is only used twice in the entire bible the second time is in isaiah 26 20 it says come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpassed that verse is to my people you know how you know it occurred to me they're just reading all this that once again david didn't find his refuge in the mountains or the strongholds or the caves he found that refuge in the shadow of his ring wings and it was there that he saw the trouble overpass but as i was reading that it began to wonder you know especially if we see the events of this past week how often we set up for ourselves caves and strongholds and mountains to be our refuge instead of relying on the shadow of his wings how often we set up little temporary caves little temporary strongholds you know and if the situation of this week has shown us anything it's that everything can change in a day in one moment people can be living their lives secure in whatever refuge they've set for themselves and the very next day every one of those refuges taken away you know it's a sobering moment a time to remember that everything that can be shaken will be shaken but it's important also that when you see these things become the past your redemption draws nigh and it just was a reminder to me that you know whether that cave that we set up for ourselves is our our house our career our job the government whether that mountain that you set up is your family your health or your abilities your finances or even your church sooner or later the enemy sought david in every single refuge that he set for himself sooner or later the enemy is coming for every one of those refuges and the only refuge that you can rely on is the shadow of his wings david goes on to say in verse 2 i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all things for me just as his enemy was using every resource at his disposal to try to lay hold of him god was using every resource at his disposal to keep him and he delivered him not into his hand there's one that has every resource at his disposal you know to me psalm 57 is just a wonderful reminder that we take care of what we set up for ourselves as a refuge and we instead seek that place in the shadow of his wings where true refuge lies you know as for moses there's a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass when my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a cliff of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by over past standing upon the rock as being in the shadow of his wings so just that's just what stuck out to me as i was reading this and let's just kind of read this short little psalm together as a reminder that we find ourselves in the one true refuge starting in verse 1 be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all things for me he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up sila god shall send forth his mercy and his truth my soul is among lions and i lie even among them that are set on fire even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth they have prepared a net for my steps my soul is bowed down they have digged a pit before me into the midst thereof they are fallen themselves selah my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise awake up my glory awake sultry and harp i myself will awake early i will praise thee o lord among the people i will sing unto thee among the nations for thy mercy is great unto the heavens and thy truth unto the clouds be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth amen amen god bless you have your seats [Music] hey [Music] on earth [Music] [Music] and hold to god's unchanging god [Music] god [Music] [Music] [Music] is oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] hey [Music] oh [Music] [Music] god [Music] i [Music] oh oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

we were working for a pharaoh that had no real kingdom and lord you brought us out you open the sea and let us come into a great promised land we're so grateful for that this morning we just ask you to visit us this morning in your word and speak to our hearts father would you move upon us father and provide to us the victorious strength of your word we thank you for your goodness to us this morning and we ask you to bless us in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you thank you so much amen aren't we blessed to have such wonderful people god bless you this morning you may be seated i did something dangerous today i brought my phone here because i wanted to read a statement to you but i'll try to find that so i hope it doesn't go off and so if it does every time i got mad at you for your phone going off in church you're forgiven amen amen i really enjoyed what brother mike had to say i i just thought that was so outstanding and and as i thought about what he was sharing with us i thought you know what was the difference between saul and david saul was chosen by man david was chosen by god amen and you look at yourselves the only thing that makes you different than anybody else is nothing else but pure election you're not better than anybody you're not smarter than anybody you haven't done anything better in fact the pharisees had greater works but you're chosen and i can't explain it but he did it he didn't have to but he did amen we have a a little uh baby dedication and we were doing a lot of these lords really uh filling up the quiver and uh so we're really grateful but this morning we're going to dedicate jackson peter yeske and of course i like to have make it a family affair so i want to invite grandmas and grandpas and brother nathan and casey up with their beautiful new son to come on up let's sing this as they come in oh bring [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh hi you guys do a good job god bless you grandparents come up great grandma sorry you know that's how it is daniel the wonderful to have the yesterday's the hux family with us everybody and i don't know if i can hold this one or not there we go oh okay is ken out there great great grandpa do you want to come up ken all right there he is i didn't know he was another great grandpa here god bless you brother good to see you i didn't see you out there i'm doing well thank you me too good good i'm glad to hear it we're still making it aren't we that's right we're fighting up i like dedicating families because it takes a family to raise a child every portion of this child's life is affected by the great grandparents by the grandparents and by the parents and the more they're surrounded with the word of god and the love and the fellowship the more that child has a place to have hope and that's why there's so much trouble in the world today because there's so many broken homes and and so lack of tutoring and mentoring and just kind words of instruction and encouragement and so we're just not indebted giving this baby back to the lord but the lord is placing this child in a family in a surrounding and it takes everybody love and if the family doesn't love one another it's it's a bad environment so that's why we bring everybody here together and we have that way of doing it may i try to hold him why this scares me sometimes handsome fella huh hey man right i'm going to try to hold him here and i i have a little scripture when i heard his name uh jackson peter i i thought of this scripture and it came being it's in the fourth uh chapter in the book of acts it says and now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus amen and that's what our hearts desire is for him today i'm going to give them back and i'm going to ask you to pray over them and then we will pray over them the grandpas and authors will all pray over them so if you dedicate your son to the lord yeah you can give a testimony so we're all about testimony so elena had uh pku and uh she doesn't want to have protein but uh she can have proteins go ahead and speak under the mic okay but elena had uh they said pku she wasn't allowed to have in protein because it would uh ruin her brain but she can have uh protein so thank you all for your prayers so uh they said it was 25 for him to have the same thing even worse maybe but uh his levels came back perfect so thanks lord hey man amen so god bless you brother go ahead and dedicate your son to the lord lord jesus thank you for another day lord thank you for uh our son jackson lord jesus we turn him over to you thank you for blessing us with him lord just have your protecting angel effect hand around him as he uh goes through this life lord jesus you know what he needs and what he doesn't need have your perfect ones life we love you lord jesus thank you for putting everything out to christ amen amen amen our heavenly father is this family together the grandparents and the family together lord comes and brings this child to you and with thanksgiving in our hearts we thank you father for him and lord may his testimony be that people look at his life and they take notice that he has been with jesus father we ask you that you would invite him into your presence even this is young childhood that you'd camp your angels about him and may be a burning light through all his life for the glory of god and the love of god shed abroad in his heart we dedicate him back to you this morning as a body of believers we take him into our fold lord we take him into our hearts and we take him into our prayers father may knows that he has an army of faith standing behind him no matter what challenge he faces father may we stand together as a united body we ask these wonderful things in the precious name of jesus we pray amen amen god bless you all well the esky family is growing amen [Music] all right got a picture hey amen you love the lord this morning amen we're gonna go into our service this morning and just trust that the the grace of the lord is our our portion this morning so let's stand this morning and we'll read a scripture and as you know that we're we're continuing on a uh then i i had this see if i can find this [Music] statement here this morning i don't know how to find these things but some of the other brothers might help me find it but i believe it's right here and i thought this was tremendous statement it says you remember church that you're living in the best days that you've ever will live in right now this is 1951. brother branham's telling the church you're living in the best days that you're ever going to live in now and this was in 1951. now until jesus comes it shall gradually not gradually but rapidly get worse and worse when russia goes down there to get that oil look out now many times people think that that means that he wants oil wells and oil fields don't get that mistaken really what they want is the oil market where the money is and they supply millions of barrels of oil 40 percent of all europe's oil comes from russia now if he could cause an incursion and drive the price of oil up a hundred percent or 200 percent higher just think of all the billions of dollars that they'll rake in doesn't matter it's all about what the root of the love of money is the root of all evil but if you just look as we read this statement he says when russia goes down there to get that oil look out that's all she needs that's what the prophet said it would do and we're ready for it then so church get ready to meet christ he's sending great revivals in meetings and stirring the full gospel people signs and wonders appearing everywhere great wonders to draw his people together for one day he shall come the deliverer amen are you looking for us coming what other sign i mean we've seen the lady in blue we've seen the mask people going in their houses wearing masks how many things have we seen that the prophet of god has placed and they're all hid in hundreds of statements all hid in simplicity all throughout the gospel and all of a sudden they just start coming out they've been there all the time so i just thought that was tremendous i got other quotes about russia you noticed every time brother brown was talking about russia everybody was thinking soviet union soviet union soviet union there's no such thing as russia it's because soviet now what is it just like he said it would be russia russia russia can you imagine people are actually using the terminology world war three the whole world's crying out the whole world's crying out brother man said they know that something's fixing to happen you know and they're they're crying out they're stirred up and just think this morning what you have you have a peace that surpasses understanding because you have the truth and you have a promise right i will not put my bride through a tribulation amen let's read over in the book of acts this morning and we're just having bible school this morning bible study rejoicing on the word of the lord and just being thankful for all this goodness to us as we're studying the wonderful message it is the rising of the sun and so we want to just read this to you here this morning in the book of acts the fourth chapter and you'll see the significance of this verse when we start into our study it says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which said he ye have heard of me so he said you stay in jerusalem until you receive the promise of the father that i told you about for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence heavenly father we ask you to add your blessing to the word of the lord in jesus precious name we pray amen you may be seated you know we just had a a wonderful meeting here and they invited the young people and the lord certainly um met with us but you know we don't want to be what we call you know kind of campfire christians that when you have a camp meeting and the fires are going and everybody's excited and everything they have a wonderful time and then just a few days after that and every the camps dispersed and and everybody enters back into the gra the grind of life and they lose their victory and we don't want to do that we want to understand that we have victory every day of our lives that that uh it's it's just not that time that uh we would uh be away uh from a victory but we have a a great uh big victory is life daily now we've been reading this message and we've been studying it and we we talked about the last time that we talked about it was that we are the benefactors that this great resurrection the the lord coming to life was not just for himself but it was that the benefits of his resurrection and overcoming what were given to us that we could be benefactors of that resurrection and we talked about being a benefactor and so the one thing we're going to talk about now is the prophet of god is going to go into the type of the sheep offering and so we when we go to talk about types we want to understand something this morning that god knew what would be he makes this statement i i in paragraph 43 it's just a little quick uh statement that he makes but he says it in in such a manner that he says this he says he says he knew it would be and what more glorious sunrise that was than it was at the beginning at time when it first dawned so god knew what would be now that's a that's a beautiful thing because you know as our brother gave us the exhortation he said we try to set up places of refuge and and things come against us but we know our refuge is in the lord and why can our refuge be in the lord because he knew it he knew and because he knows that's how he can become a provider uh he sent abraham to the mountain and and with isaac carrying wood and isaac says to his father he says uh father that we got the fire amen we got the wood where's the sacrifice you know and he's not going to look at his son and say you're it. but he knew in his heart he said god knew this hour i think that's what abraham rested in he rested in the promise he rested that his seed was going to be like the stars he rested no matter what it was what god was asking him to do he knew that god knew it would be and therefore he said god will provide a sacrifice he's jehovah jirei he'll he'll provide and so we understand that god knew what would be so he knows what's going on he knew that we would have this conflict he knew about your personal conflict he knew about your life he knew about your weaknesses he he knows god knew what would be and therefore he he makes provisions so in knowing what would be he laid down all these types and we called the old testament many times we say the old testament was written in what shadows and types everything was typing the prophets didn't even know why they did what they did they didn't understand how they got in the circumstances that they got in they didn't understand the events that were happening around them they didn't understand why the things that they spoke came out of their mouth but god knew what would be so he placed all these types and he placed he placed them there he placed them there in the scriptures we spoke of the type of this morning brother mike did about david being the what rejected king you know being sought after and and and and in in saul being absorbed with uh jealousy and and uh but god knew that would be and then from that david wrote the psalms he wrote he he he he testified from that agony he he wrote type after type my bones they stare at me he you know he wrote so many things concerning the word of god shadows and types they were all placed in there and just like the whole universe was created in placed in order and it became the first gospel that was ever written so these these shadows and types were written were a written gospel so there's actually a gospel written in type and we know prophet of god said you know i'm a great typologist because he could read the gospel of types now just think of that to read the gospel of types because were asked this morning to read the gospel of a types because he's going to present to us a type this morning the messenger is going to go through a type he uses the words i want to spend a little time explaining this type to you because i think it'll help you and so these types were placed in the gospel so we can read them now just think we we're going back just like the quote we read this morning we're going back to things that the prophet of god said in 51 56 the world's falling apart many other scriptures we are finding out that they the things that are coming to pass have already been spoken the the lady in purple uh many other prophecies and statements that we've seen all those things were laid there because he knew what would be remember modern events are not made clear by the new york times modern events are made clear by what prophecy now really you've got to turn that around really the events are made clear or in other words what the events really are were because they were prophesied why is russia doing what they're doing because they were prophesied to do it why do we have a plague and you notice they called it a plague we now we i would have never called it a plague you know and and it went across the land and and and we found out that uh the uh we weren't free from it but you understand faith doesn't keep us from it faith delivers us from it god was great gracious to us uh we we we didn't have in it we didn't lose any of our members i know we're a young vibrant congregation and if you don't mind i'm going to include myself in there if you'll give me that permission this morning but the things that are spoken are happening and we've got to get to the place where they stir us up and so we we saw these things and now we and that they're going on and and now we see this going on and you say well what's going on what's happening the whole thing i don't care if it drives the world's all uniting together it doesn't matter we know the world will unite together right because it's been prophesied go read uniting time and sign he says they're uniting but what else is going on there's another uniting going on and that's the uniting of the bride and the word there's another union i thought it was strange they say oh he's trying to put the soviet union back together another union well we have a union but ours is an invisible union between what a heavenly bridegroom and an earthly bride it's another union that's taking place so along with all the events of the world that are going on along with all the politics that's going on and all the voices and and all the things everything's right on time it's all been prophesied we've been told the world was was falling apart but we never let it soak in we never shake ourselves and say man just think i mean you got to understand you might look over and think of ukraine but ukraine is a modern city it looks like dallas or fort worth you know because it's not it's it's not medieval times these are real towns and real cities just like you know just tanks going down dallas and blowing stuff up and and all that's going on why wars rumors of war everything is perfect amen everything is running to its place and its position so god's got a place for everything he knew what would be and therefore he's doing whatever he has to do to get everything to its place that it was prophesied god wanted to place paul as the first messenger to the church so he did whatever he had to do to get paul to that place knock them off the horse smite them blind you know take them to the desert it didn't matter and you can rest in that that god's in charge of your life whether you're running from him or not amen and he'll only let you run so long he'll only let you go so far and one day we hope that it's with a gentle hand of jehovah we hope that it's with instruction and and conviction that he can turn your course but if he has to he'll knock you off your horse but praise god amen amen whatever it takes lord jesus so as we we begin we looked at this message and we begin to fellowship around this the message of it's a rising of the sun we realize that our messenger that all these things were laid out here all these types are laid out here so we as believers can read them and we can see them and by these we can understand so you have to understand the types are given as a gospel that though only the believer can see it it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes so it's in a type because god knew it he knew beforehand what would be so he could put the type there and then the type is placed there because he knows what it's typing and it's typed in there so nobody else can see it it goes right over their heads but the believer catches it it actually becomes a gospel to them and hold that as we move on now we understand that we were talking about the resurrection and we're talking about us being the benefactors of the resurrection so he rose up by the spirit that was in him is that right he said no man takes my life from me but i lay down my life and because i lay down my life i have power to take it up again and now he made this great statement because i live you shall live also i've overcome death hell and the grave now i have life in me as life and i'm going to give you this life now we read our scripture he said now you don't leave jerusalem until you wait here because there's a promise that the father made and that promise to jesus was that they could be baptized with the same baptism he was baptized with so you can imagine the great promise that jesus had he's going to lay down his life but he's not laying down his life without expectation that's right he's not laying down his life with not knowing what he's laying his life down for he's not laying because god knew what would be he's not laying down his life not knowing what he was going to accomplish he knew if he laid down his life that his own would receive what he had that he was able to impart the life that he had to them so we read this statement he says his spirit brings his same life again on the earth his spirit right brings the same life again to the earth so now his spirit is going to bring that life which is what eternal life he says on the earth if the spirit of god that raised up christ dwelleth in you it shall also quicken your mortal bodies and so we we understand that by his spirit so he just didn't go into the grave wondering what would happen he knew that if he overcame death and paid that price that now the predestinated seed of god could come to life otherwise it would just lay in the ground right now we know that was typed in creation because he went through it in the beginning every seed was in the ground it was dark it was void right but the s-u-n had to come up and bring those seeds to life what was that it was a tight because he had seed right and it was laying in the ground yes sir that's right and he knew that he had to come up and shine on that seed to bring it to life so that was a type everything working perfectly according to his plan so it brought life again on the earth now as we we looked at this we understood that we're just laying that or we're only listening to 11 minutes this morning so as we looked at this we saw that there was three stages or or parts that we were going to talk about that he said he would do and i have them wrote here but i'd like to read them again to you i know know i have them here somewhere let me see if i can find it i don't know if i have the page number well i look at them so many times that i but i'll just read them to you the first one the first of the three things that we knew that that he would do is that he was going to to tell us what the church was okay so he said the seven mysteries that were opened were open to accomplish three purposes and he said that these were sealed up and then when the seals were open if it brought it out to the church and the first thing that was brought out to the church is what the church was and so what was the church that the church was his female part you understand that you were part of him in the beginning she's called a what a bride that is called the the church so what was the church what was she you know she's not a group of worshipers because men worship god from every place they worship the stars they worship the sun they worship the moon but she was something that was happy birthday by the way she was something that was special and unique so what was the seals going to reveal who was the church what the church was not man-made kingdoms not man-made denominations that's not the church that's denominational fiction that's never what the church was the church was not an assembly of historians looking back on the life of christ and developing a system to worship him that's not what the church was church is not buildings so when i when you think of church because we go to church how many churches do you think there are dallas fort worth you say well over probably 5 000 that isn't the church the church is one thing and one thing only the bride of christ the female part of god that what the church was part of him it was his bride that's right oh we could go into so many things right here i i want to but i don't maybe i can come back to it later but basically salt satan stole his wife right and he came back to get her back remember because the prophet of god said she was deceived into it that's what marriage and divorce is about it isn't about all your little relationship problems marriage in divorce is about satan took his wife and he came back to redeem her back and to get her back and to cleanse her and watch her like she had never done it in the first place and to restore back a hundred percent pure back to the word of god and to divorce her you think that you divorce no he divorces you from him by killing him in your life think of it you didn't all of a sudden decide oh i'm not going to love the world no more and i'm going to go serve you like a man told me one time he said you know he said i sing christian music now i said that's good he says you know he said i tried to sing for the world but i starved to death and i thought what so you're over here because there's more money on this side of the thing than there's on that side but if you would have become a star i think a lot of these so-called christian musicians today are just guys that couldn't make it in the world but they still want to play rock and roll so there's some lukewarm bunch of guys out there that get a bunch of so-called lukewarm christians to listen to them same beat same music same stuff if you you know what i mean but they've suckered a new audience excuse me for going there but so what was she you you can never amount to being who you are until you can claim your identity tell you i know you can't go in and and and accept the benefits what we talked about last week of the resurrection until you can say i am air i'm joined air i'm his child i'm married to the son i'm the bride this is my inheritance he killed the brought me out of my egypt so that's what she had that and all through the message she's a part of him she was with him in the beginning she was she was in his thoughts right so what was she what was the church he's not talking about the mechanical makeup that's right he he's talking what the church was not was the church which would indicate history right and reenactment trying to reproduce this is what she was like someone that says i i i i i was 150 pounds so i'm going to do everything i can to get back to 150 pounds that that that that's going back to what uh what was the church but this is not what was the church this was what the church was so it's her identification of who she is now remember he said when the church recognizes who she is then she becomes that person because she's not struggling to obtain something or go back to something she understands that she's something that was made i was made the bride of christ i didn't earn the bride of christ i didn't have to get dressed up in my best dress put on my best shine you know so i could impress do you know how it is and and and spend hours working with my hair until i got confidence because i want to display confidence i didn't win the lord the only reason he found me because he knew me the only reason the eagle found the ch eagle in the chicken pin because she knew he had her somewhere and he went looking for her and found her now it might have known it might have been a chicken and acting like a chicken but it wasn't a chicken you have been in the world you may been in egypt you may have been in the chicken yard but you're not an egyptian and you're not a chicken what were you what was the church the church was what the church was she was the bride of christ she's scattered everywhere but what was the good shepherd he went out to get her back into the fold so you've got to we've got to realize that you are not some worldly person who became a christian you're not a pig turned into a sheep you were a sheep in the pigpen but you were always a sheep you were a sheep to begin with you were always bride you were bright to begin with it didn't matter the woman at the well as dark as she was six dark church ages and the one that she was with that pale ugly horse types types types everywhere wasn't her husband but guess who she meant at the well she meant her husband she meant the husband that she was always meant to be with that's right the one that washed his feet the one that was going to be stoned it didn't matter where he found him right he found him one by one they found him why because he knew what the church was he knew this person in this dark hippie state this person sitting on this bar stool this person tied up in all kinds of drugs this person over here and all kinds of doesn't matter he comes by and he says that name that person's on the lam's book of life i have identity with that person i know who that person is i saw it in the beginning i know the color of his eyes the color of his hair and i have come to bring her back and to restore her justifier sanctifier and filler with my life so we understand what the church was it was his female part it was the party lost how many no prophet of god said that he's not complete without us you ever consider how important you are you're important to him how important do you think your heart is take it out see how you do you can't you can't live without air everybody's living by the grace of god so so that's what the church was so it's not church get church out of your mind get denominations out of your mind get going on sunday out of your mind there's only one true church and that was those that were a part of him in the beginning everything else is a man-made stew of a little bible a little politics a little world a little pleasure and it's just a big old stew poison in the pot it's all it is it's a beagle's stew because we're going to talk about something this morning and he's going to talk about it so the second thing was how it was in christ in at the beginning okay if she's a part of him right and that's his bride that's what she is it's not all this worship out here not baptist presbyterian methodist what are those things they're blasphemous what names not organization not christianity is a society not christianity is a social way of life not christianity there's one church and one church only and that was the church that was a part of him in the beginning his bride end the story no such thing as assembly of god church what did the prophet of god call him lodge just think of all the things brother brahms been telling us that slips away from us because we're not seeing the whole picture lodge all it is is a lodge then he says to how she was in christ in the beginning we go we know that we've been over 100 time we're in his thinking we're a part of his attributes he wanted to explain to show this other side of himself to us he never lost us he secured us by giving us a title deed on the lamb's book of life i think brother nathan this last weekend referred to it as a world between worlds we referred to it earlier as a world within a world but just drop down right so we could know he's a healer a deliverer we had never known none of those attributes on the other side so he never left us he just brought us here let us go for this little period of time and then picks us up again right we understand that so we understand where we're in the beginning now this is what we're going to cover this morning is the third step or the third thing that the opening of the seals was to accomplish how it would be revealed in the last days this is what we're going to realize this morning is how the church was going to be revealed in the last days how was the bride going to be revealed how was he going to do it we know what she was what the church was it was this female part it was his bride we know that she was with him in the beginning now the last step is supposed to be is to show her how she was going to be revealed so he makes in this type that we're going to read and we can go to paragraph uh uh uh 82 and it would just put that on the bar just fixing the plate right now but he reads the scripture here and the scripture that's going to be read is found in the book of leviticus the 23rd chapter and the 9th through the 11th verse and he says speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i have given you and then in 82 he says unto the place the position that i have given unto you now you speak to the children of israel that when you get to this certain place that i promised you i take you when you get there in this land now that's a natural type so what teaches tommy says when you get to a certain place okay so what what he's talking about here is there's an exodus taking place right there's a coming out which is a what a type so the coming out so when you come out of egypt when you come out and you get to this place when you go through this exodus when you come out and you get to this place that's when you've got to so first of all you've got to get to the place and in order for them to get to the promised land they had to totally fully come out of egypt they had to they had to totally come out and egypt was a type of the world so the first place you got to see this type first of all they had to come out there had to be an exodus because there's something that's going to transpire so we're talking about a natural type bringing it to the spiritual type of how he's going to reveal himself so we've got to come to the place where you have a complete and full revelation that this is the spirit-filled word is the absolute truth that's right so you won't be able to go any farther until you come to the realization that that pillar of fire was the what it was a picture that god allowed to be caught in this modern age of the same pillar of fire that led the children of egypt out into a place that was promised right and he led him by and then we have a picture of a cloud and that is a type of the cloud pillar of fire by night cloud by day here we are in our day got a pillar of fire and got a cloud which tells us that we're in a what in an exodus so he's saying after the exodus right now there was a second exodus wasn't there and it was the exodus of the law and what did they have to do they had to be totally sold out to christ totally come out of the law and go in the upper room and what happened a rushing wind and what cloven tongues of fire why type exodus right so they had to be totally out sold out if you're halfway with this message and you have any reservations you will never be a benefactor of it you'll be in a struggle but when you're sold out beyond a shadow of a doubt you know this is the truth and it's your absolute now you're in a place now what happens he said now when you get to this land and you plant and after you've planted in this land so he's telling him there's going to be a land you're going to have an exodus you're going to go to a promised land but when you get to the promised land when you plant it will mature and then when you get this this after you plant now let me say this you've got to be into the land completely so you've got to be totally in the land of the message and that's when you start planning if you don't take the word and plant it in your life it will not mature so you got to take the word plant it in your life and then that that that'll grow and it will produce and mature into his life now we're talking this type here because now he's going to explain this type so what did they do when they got into the land they planted in that land when you come into the message of the hour the word of god the word of promise we call it the message of the hour but the truth of the matter is it's the gospel of the hour it's the word of the hour god is not history god is present tense when you're the spirit of god is planning himself in your life to bring you to maturity and and to bring you to life so you've got to come out you've got to totally take the word of god plan it in your life and it'll start growing to maturity so now he's going to take to us and share with us the type of leviticus so let's just listen for 11 minutes of tape real careful look at it close listen to every line and then we'll be back and close in just a few moments so we're going to pick up and paragraph what is it 81 i believe of the rising of the sun you might if you have your books or your tablets or whatever you might bring them to church with you as we go through this message because it's it's so rich that we just take it in a few places so just try to stay awake 11 minutes you can fall asleep on me but don't don't fall asleep on the voice of god all right god bless you that same spirit by the same works by the same power by the same signs being you he'll also raise you up i'd like to read a little scripture here for you i'd like for you to turn to another scripture i got wrote down here it might help you a little it's found in the book of leviticus the 23rd chapter the 9th to the 11th verse listen close in the law of levitical law god speaking to moses listen all these things are types now and we'll stop here for a few moments to get into this type and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give unto you unto the place of position that i have given unto you how you speak to the children of israel that when you get to this certain place that i promise you i take you when you get there in this land now speaking natural here type in the spiritual and shall reap the harvest thereof you may receive what i told you thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priests and he shall wave the sheep before the lord to be accepted for you on the mara after the sabbath the priest shall weave it if there would be any holy ritual it should come forth on the sabbath day which was the seventh day of the week which is saturday but did you notice in this memorial the wave it on the first day of the week the sheep which was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up and ripens you cut down this sheath and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the lord for your exception that you are accepted you have come with your sheep and he used to wave it before the lord on not on the sabbath the seventh day but on the first date which we call sunday s-u-n-d-a-y of course that's a roman uh word which they called it the sunday for the sun god but how it is changed it's not s-u-n anymore it's the s-o-n-d-a-y the sunday that that carnal week god's first one up from the dead is to be waved over the congregation that we are his seed and that's the first of the seed of those that slip waved upon the first day of the week on sunday he raised up wave goodbye and ascended up on high in the presence of the people notice it was the first corn of god's wheat that had been raised from the dead god's first corner week by god's quickening power god had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that sheep that's why they had to weigh that sheep or it was the first one that come to maturity and it was weighed as a memorial of thanksgiving to god believing that the rest of them would come there was a sign and today because he was the first son of god to come to full maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and has waved over the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although it you've been typed in many times and we'll see later he was typed but this is really the first fruits of them to slept he was waved over the promised seed that had promise of life he was waved at the day of pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the pentecostal people that was up at pentecost waiting for uh the blessing to come and to be waived again we realized in the last days according to luke 17 30 in the sunday again in the days that the etholene of man will be revealed or waved again over the people who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word would make flesh and dwelt among us and of all the teaching that we have in confirmation of the word of god by word of god by signs by wonders we see the day that in the book of of luke here as we just quoted from the luke the 17th chapter 31st and malachi 4 in the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is ways over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the shot of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us has given us life as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth all those types in many places he was the first fruits of those who slept and the bride coming up christ coming out of the church there'll have to be a sheep waved again in the last days oh waiting of the sheep what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheep i'm sure you see what i'm talking about i don't know he was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the fraud age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism it will be a message that the form of turkey all the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did that day all right it's called aliens he live also speaking to his wife because i live you live also what a resurrection does that work and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was way back to him on the day of pentecost the word made manifest now and he's our stage to be waved again in the last days now for instance you say when i awaken it brother abraham i know what church that well i do too but now for instance what if if we were going to go back to tucson this afternoon now and each one of us had a was going to go in a a big cadillac brand new and all of the seats were made out of absolute skin softest of the leather soft and easy to sit in and the floorboards were plush the steering wheel were nickel plated and had diamond studs all over it and the engine was mechanically tested to be exactly the right engine and the wheels were all had bearings and greased up and the tires were all puncture proof and blowout freeze all been tested scientifically they've been pushed off the assembly lines both of them and both of them filled up with gasoline that's the running power the gasoline because it is the oxygen but now when you're going to start them all don't bulk up look just alike but there's one of them don't have any spark any firing power what do you say the power is in the gasoline brother but i don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest those powers as there's a power there to confirm that that's gasoline it just might as well be water until no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the bible until that wave sheath until that holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move amen not just a few seconds it seemed like didn't it it's hard to believe that was supposed to be 11 minutes i don't know it didn't feel like nothing to me but let's just let's just not run away real quick let's just go over just a few point out just a few things that that was that was a taking place so first of all we understood that we're talking he says i want to talk to you about this type so it was waived on a not on a sabbath day not on what would be considered a day of the religious man's religious form but it was waived on the first day of the week which was represented as we know sunday now let's just don't miss this little thought i thought it was a good thing so we understand that it it represented what came to maturity now i want to say this just right if i can i want to see if i can say it just right here that now we know it was the first day now if the waving wasn't the event of the resurrection so we say oh jesus rose so him rising from the dead that was the sheep offering that's not really exactly what the chief offering was because that was it came to maturity so in type all the wheat that came to maturity right it was wheat then that which excuse me that which was mature so when he came from the grave he was the first one to come to maturity now we ask ourselves oh wait a minute what about enoch what about elijah what about who else was there moses well he said now he was typed in many places but they weren't the first fruit they were just types so so and that's what he said they were typed in many places so moses he he was caught by the angels elijah was quick and enoch was quickened so he's talking about the power that would quicken them so he had to type that also because if god ever does one thing one way he's got to continue to do it the same way so that was a type also so all those types were there it was in many types so he come to maturity so it's not the maturity that was that was represented it was the life because when the thing matured what happens it comes up through the stock it comes up to the tassel it comes up to the seed then the shuck pulls away from it and then it's back to seed again it's back to what went into the ground therefore it has the life to reproduce itself so after it came to maturity so he came out of the grave proving what that sin no longer had hold of them the day you sin is the day you die which of you can convict me of sin well would have done any good if he never sinned and went into the grave but when he matured you say when was he mature father let this cup pass from me but nevertheless thy will be done he had power don't think he didn't that guy coming chopped off in fact that we even know the bible tells us when they all came up and they said we see jesus and now she says i am he they all fell back then peter you know a little while ago peter wouldn't even let him wash his feet then he wanted to be washed his hands in his head you know peter pulls out his sword cuts the high priest the servant's ear off i think it is jesus picks it up and puts it back on there were so blinded that was he was mature he went into the grave and that maturity proved because he said i have power to lay my life down i have power to take it up nobody takes my life from me but i lay down my life for you that you might have life also that's a mature christian oh are we ready to come to that place let this mind be in you that was in christ let every man look after the needs of others over his own that's that maturity he came to full maturity full maturity that he could lay down his life he had the power to take it up again but it took full maturity to lay it down oh hallelujah he knew what was written of him how he would suffer he told them many things i have to suffer many things i have to share but you can't bear them he knew what he was going through but he came to maturity he came to that maturity in the garden of gethsemane angels were all around him he could have called the angels down there set up his kingdom right then but i loved that song when he was on the cross i was on his mind he went there for you and he went there and he laid down his life and then he took it up again took him resurrecting that that life that was in him that event was not the wave offering it was the event was the proof of the maturity that he was a true son of god had the power of son of god because he could lay his life down and take it up again so he proved that that's what he was but the the but so the event was just the was of the resurrection was just the maturity but the waving if you go back to paragraph 90 and 91 and they said and he had entered and today because he was the first son of god to come to full maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and is waved over the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had been typed in many times as we'll see later he was typed but this was really the first fruit of them that slept that was waved over the promised seed of life so the event of him coming out of the grave was the maturity the waving now look at right here in 91 he was waived at the day of pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people at the pentecostal people that was up at that pentecost waiting for that blessing to come so it was the same life it was the promise word that was waved over them so it was waved over them at the day of pentecost that that life could now be in them because i live you shall live also and then as we just go down so he says in the last days now because that was waved at that exodus right so now we're living in a time who are you you've been assembled from all kinds of different places all kinds of different walks of life we're gathered in all kinds of places all over the world today listening to the voice of the angel messenger yes sir to our day because as we look again at paragraph 92 and is to be waived again we realize in the last days according to luke 17 30. so there's a promised wave offering so every time that god makes a biblical promise that promise has to be manifested in the flesh because in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh he can never leave a promise or a word or a prophecy unmanifested so the way it becomes manifested is to become flesh and that's what our messenger told us he says in the beginning it was the word made flesh now it's flesh being made word that's all he says is to be waved over the people so the son of man as it was in the days as it was in the days of moses as it was in the days of this coming of the son of man one shall be taken one shall be left so the question is and he asked the question was who is the son of man paragraph 93 who is the son of man now we think and say well the son of man was brother branham well yes and no brother branham was the flesh that the son of man was manifested in but the son of man was the word that was in the beginning so what the sign was what was the sign with moses it was the word made flesh what was that was the sign of that exodus what was the sign of the second exodus jesus the word made flesh so there has to be the same sign has to be the same sheaf offering when you come to the promised land everything has to stay in type who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was made flesh and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so brother branham was the vessel but the promised word was that i will come again exactly what he did for the gentiles he was going to do again the same ministry that was that jesus christ standing there in flesh the same signs the same wonders now we just heard them say it right the same wonders the same science the same works that he done have been done again in this day because it's a type it's a gospel he's wanting us to see what's transpiring so brother branham was the vessel but the word was the promise that god made that i will send you elijah the prophet and he shall restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of their fathers in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mysteries of god should be revealed as it was in the days of sodom and gomorrah which we could go an hour on that condition so shall it be in the day of the son of man what was the son of man it's the day that the bride is revealed don't get mixed up that the son of man ministry was just turning his back to the audience and it was just praying for the sick in the miracles because what the seals done what did we say is how she was to be revealed in the last days she's but to be revealed by the waving of the ministry of the son of man the ministry of the son of man was the revelation of the church being made flesh hallelujah it was you saying i'm the bride i can plant this word in my life and it'll mature me into rapturing faith and there's i can take the word that was spoken through the mouth of the prophet and the revel the revelations that were hid in the seals i can take that word plant it in my life and it will bring that seed in me to full resurrection maturity so what was great the event the maturity wasn't it it was him taking that life at pentecost he says it in paragraph he also makes it known by the same thing at the day of pentecost he said paragraph 98 and it was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of pentecost the word made manifest so that's when the promise was made manifest you go wait up there and tell the promise which the father made which i gave you and you're endued with power you wait there till the promise comes to pass so they're in the upper room now the sheaf offering is waved over them the life comes back to them did it slip over you what happened in our day the son of man's waved over us so what the life he don't care how religious you are if you don't get the life now everybody's thinking the life is what fell at pentecost that was not what we had in this day we had the restoration of gifts and an unrighteous partaking of spiritual gifts by devil inspired men and they produced quote a church a bride but it's not the bride of christ it's the bride of satan with all kinds of blasphemous names with all kinds of false signs and wonders but the purpose was not to reveal was not just to reveal the the uh what the seals were in the history of it but the purpose of it was to reveal the bride that's what's happening it's letting her know i'm bright i'm heir to life and not only did he that but he waved it so you could receive the life oh my you just think of of of how glorious that is he says now in this day he proves what he said because they are part of that seed that was represented on the lamb's book of life that he came to redeem back to god again paragraph 72 oh what a message okay so you understand now that he's waving the ministry of the son of man because what did they receive up their pentecost they received power they were endued with power to make the word that he promised him the works that i do shall you do also come to life and now he's waving that same thing over his elect that they will come to life i'm speaking to the wife what a resurrection this is what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is you're in the rapture you're in the resurrection you're in the transforming it's so beautiful and we'll close i got long i know i promised you i would and we want to close on this paragraph before we go further and and listen close as he says this as we who was the son of man and then he said luke 17 30 malachi 4 5 we've seen the different scriptures we've seen the signs and wonders we've seen this i'm sure you know what i'm talking about he's talking about the ministry the chief offering that was waived over the people to bring the bride to the realization of who that they are that they could receive the same life that he had now i know nobody likes this part but i'd just like to close he said then he said here in paragraph 90 7 because i live you live also speaking to his wife who was the church what the church was it was his wife he came back to get his eve and this eve will not be deceived this eve will remain true to that word amen and though he says this and he closes and we're closing with this paragraph too paragraph 103 no matter how much theologians claim i don't care what the baptist says i don't care what the presbyterians say i don't care what dr schuler says i don't certainly don't care what joyce meyer says i don't care about what any doctor says what any seminary says i don't care about any man's idea let every man's word be a lie i don't care how much they take this bible how much they go through it how much they explain how much they try to tell you that that there's no exodus going on no matter how they can point to their good works no matter how much theologians claim you got to get that out of your mind you'll never get the benefits until you've entered that place how well you got your church set you don't have to have it set everything's set i'll tell you something about christians christians don't live by plans that's right they're led by the spirit of god how are you going to do this i don't know do you got a plan not really what do you think noah's plan look like no every day god said put this here pitch that there put that there we're led we're not a planned church we're a miracle church the footsteps of the righteous are led by the lord it's by leadership we don't know how we're going to do things we know one thing if god said so he'll take care of it he'll take care of it that's all our trust is we don't go forward by plans we go forward by faith abraham didn't know what god's plan was he knew if god led him to do it he'll do it whether he had to raise him up from the dead he didn't know he didn't have times when he was led and when he got there god provided a sacrifice hallelujah that's what it takes you've got to be sold out to the vision if you're not sold out to the vision it'll never come to pass you tell me how david brother mike that you talk about came from a sheepfold beautiful because god not david do you hear brother mike say he said god didn't trust in the caves he trusted in the fact that he had a promise from god he had a vision he was called he didn't know what he had to go through yes sir but he knew god would get him there and even when he fell miserably and he looked at samuel and he said i failed he said do it unto me as i so judged he said david god's rich in mercy because he chose you and he placed you where he placed you and he'll stand behind you and listen this morning as we say this how well you got your church set or how much education you got how much like the bible you know i just thrilled there might be what you said this morning people take this bible and they they hide in it like one of those caves i'm a red letter king james believe in baptist yes or you get with a person that's in the church of christ their whole life is to argue when they're arguing they're on fire that's their holy ghost because the spirit of argument we're the church of christ we don't play pianos we don't have music we don't sing we don't do this we don't do that we're the church of christ we we're we're right here we by works and we're right down here like this you know armenians and and you know camelites we don't want to get into that philosophy but they're on both sides of this and they're hiding in this word and and they got their scriptures and they're throwing out the defense out there and they've got it all together and if you get to follow them you'll go down their rabbit trail and knowing you to get to the end of it you've got no life that's what he said i don't care how much you got without the life it's nothing now list what he says he says how much education you got how much like the bible and tell that wave chief and tell the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30. revelations 10 7 is waived over you until that comes into your life and has waved over you there is no way you'll come to maturity there is no way you'll come to resurrection until the holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word until that's waved there's no way the seed that's in you can come to life and the only people that are gonna come to life or that bride is the church this is not a great big world full of christians the prophet of god said it's denominational fiction if you're living outside of revelations 10 7 luke 17 30 and malachi 4 and the revealed word of the hour you are living in a fiction and you'll never mature and come to life i know that's cold what is the biggest word you hear today inclusion let's include anybody some guy thinks he's a woman we'll include her on the swim team some guy all decides he's a lady he can go in the woman's bathroom we include everybody christianity is not inclusion it's exclusion and anybody that's not under the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 the sheaf offering in this day is excluded out of the resurrection no that's back wait a minute we need more grace so let's start let's just what do they call that when you sign a contract and then at the bottom they got all the fine print i got a contract the other day and there was more things inside that are excluded there was in the things that they're doing disclaimer yeah we want to write a disclaimer oh whoever god picks well he picked you if he would have picked them he would have given them the revelation he gave you god knows who he picked my sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow all that the father hath given me will come i will not leave them nor forsake them if i start a good work in them i'll finish it till the end i don't know who they are as far as individuals but i know the only ones that are going is his elect lady she's the only one that doesn't go in the tribulation because he will not let his bride go in the tribulation and he brings his bride to life how is she revealed in the last days she's revealed by the ministry of the son of man being waved over her and bringing her to life nothing else this kills but the spirit brings this to life oh what a beautiful revelation that we're living under please church accept no matter how evil and mad you are at your flesh in your life let the message transform you accept it plan it and it will mature and the same life that raised up jesus christ will mature in you and where he is we will be also sorry for being so long but i had to get this three pages off my heart i hope you can come back go home have a nap if you don't have a place to nap you can nap at my house and if you're hungry i'll feed you but just remember you are in the ark and there's no other place of safety but the
