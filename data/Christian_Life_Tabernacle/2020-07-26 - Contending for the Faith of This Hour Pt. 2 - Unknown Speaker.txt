my brother daniel prays we'll just uh open the service in prayer we didn't have any needs turned in but if y'all want to have an uplifted hand just to make a request known to the lord he sees that he's mindful of it he was mindful that you would raise your hand this morning when he went to calvary that's the kind of god we serve amen so we just want to open the service in prayer we'll just have to pray a bless you know the ties and offerings we'll take that up a little bit later but we just want to handle that order of the service now almighty god father we thank you for your love father we thank you for the breath of life you have given us this morning father no matter what going home but you have put your promises between the virus and us rather we can only look to that and see your purpose to be fulfilled father we thank you and we pray that you may come and be with us father you know what we desire in our heart especially this time father pray that you may increase more of the

now father and you will be with us father be with us father in the name of thy son lord jesus we pray amen amen praise the lord amen we'll just ask brother mike to come with the psalm reading we all just remember our pastor and sister leslie is their way uh visiting his mother i i got a little text from my mom uh they she said have a good service we're we're uh on our way down our pastor's going to baptize an old friend of his this morning i was just i just thought that was wonderful so remember them in prayer also we just make a quick announcement there's going to be a youth meeting this friday at 6 pm here at the church so we want to remember that for all the youth this friday morning in uh first samuel 13 there's a story that we all know well about how king saul and the children of israel were facing what the scripture describes as an enemy that was numbered as the number of the sea sands of the sea you know and for a week they sat there facing one another off and the soldiers of the israelites began to get more and more fearful and would start to slowly slip off one this way one another and saul began to watch his army crumble all around him and he decided that rather than waiting to receive a word from the lord he decided he would try to do something religious to see if he could bring the lord into his program you know and it's interesting is the fires of his sacrifice are just beginning to die down that samuel the prophet comes on the scene and he says what have you done right it's in verse 13. he says the lord would have at this moment established the kingdom of israel forever right that would have been what happened but you know so the philistines were doomed they already had their dame mark but because of this he said instead thy kingdom shall not continue you know it's a sad example of what could have been but never was because somebody did not have the right heart for the lord you know it's interesting in first samuel 12 just before this encounter samuel had given this instruction to saul and to the children of israel and i thought it was interesting because it ties back toward psalm this morning pretty well it says fear not you have done all this wickedness in selecting a king yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart and turn ye not aside for then should you go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain for the lord will not forsake his people for his great namesake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people and it was just one year after this that that tragedy occurred on the battlefield and what you find is as a result it cost the people a total victory over an overwhelming enemy in a battle that they would never have had to fight if they'd have just had the right response to the lord but samuel finishes up by saying one other thing he said but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain of his own people you know i got to thinking about that a man after his own heart what kind of a testimony is that right to have a heart like his you know of course we know it's david it's r it's it's uh just long not long after this that he anoints david and you know he's he's known as having the man that has a heart just like his but it seems to me if david was an example of one who had a heart i mean was a man after his own heart that we'd want to know what kind of heart that was that wouldn't we desire to have that same thing said of us you know it turns out we have a playbook we have a blueprint where we can get a glimpse into what kind of heart that was and that's the book of psalms psalms is david's daily prayer book his daily prayer journal where you can get an insight into his heart do you know in the book of psalms david mentions his heart 57 times and i would think that every time he says my heart if he's a man after his own heart that we would pay special attention when he says my heart and applies it to something we're going to look at psalm 86 this morning and it turns out this is one of those passages where david mentions his heart twice but one particular verse stuck out to me that you know just kind of spoke to me as i was looking at this it's in verse 11 psalm 86 11 and it says this teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name you know that's interesting wording there that's one of only twice that the word unite is mentioned there but basically unite what's the opposite of united divided right so it basically means an undivided heart remove every division in my heart give me a single heart for what thing to fear not to be afraid not to be terrified because he says let not your heart be troubled he's not the author of fear but give appropriate honor and respect and reverence unite my heart to have the right respect or the right reverence for thy name what is his name it's his identification it's his identification papers right and he basically is saying lord if you can do one thing with my heart give me a single heart a single desire to have respect unto your identification which is his word the very thing that saul had decided not to wait for is the very thing that inclined him to have the same kind of heart as he did you know if you look at that how many of you would desire to have his heart how many of you would desire to have an undivided heart how many would desire to have a heart that would desire to reverence his word and my prayer for myself and i hope for each of us is today that we can have our heart united to fear his name so let's read psalm 86 together we'll start we'll just read it together it's bow down thine ear oh lord hear me for i am poor and needed preserve my soul for i am holy oh thou my god save thy servant that trusteth in thee be merciful unto me o lord for i cry unto thee daily rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul for thou lord are good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee give your o lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee for thou will answer me among the gods there is none like unto thee o lord neither are there any works like unto thy works all nations whom thou has made shall come and worship before thee o lord and shall glorify thy name for thou art great and do us wondrous things thou art god alone teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name i will praise thee o lord my god with all my heart and i will glorify thy name forevermore for great is thy mercy toward me and thou has delivered my soul from the lowest hell o god the proud are risen against me and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them but thou o lord are full of compassion and gracious long-suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth oh turn unto me and have mercy upon me give thy strength unto thy servant and save the son of thine handmaid show me a token for good that they which hate me may see it and be ashamed because thou lord has hoped in me and comforted me man praise the lord you may be seated i want to try a song i'm not sure we've sang it here before jesus hold my

your presence lord you just realized that mortal beings standing before the living god lord we're so humbled by your presence lord to just great get in front of such a great and mighty god father we feel like isaiah getting in a temple he said that he was saw angels with wings and with two they were covering their face and their feet and the in the other they were flying with it and he says that as he walked as those angels he says as the walk he said that he heard it was just screaming out the holy holy holy such a holy place and and as they would say it it says that the pillar of the temple will move and and you will realize oh such a living god we and and as in our natural state we can't even stand in front of him and he said oh i'm so such a man of unclean and i'm not even able to stand before him but oh god the the says that the there was a call of fire that was taken and put up on his lips and given him the ability to speak why because you made a way for him to speak lord and i believe this morning you made a way that we may stand before you lord your prophet tells us that it's the shed blood that you provided lord that we may come even in contact with you because you are you are three times holy we couldn't stand before you for anything but you made a way that we may come and have fellowship with you this morning lord it's all based on that way that you have made that we approach your throne this morning and we say that speak to us the words of righteousness speak to us the words of holiness that your word may come and changes in the image of what you would like us to be this morning lord we want to receive of your throne this morning we want to receive that which you have in store for us this morning we don't want to hear the words of men we're not interested in men's idea or what men's thinking is we're interested in the word of the living god because that's what the power of transformation comes from speak to us oh god and just anoint our lips and our ears lord as we gather in your presence lord that we may just have such a wonderful time why because lord no man has ever come in your presence and go back the same lord we realize that your presence brings choice and it brings compassion it brings the healing it brings all the things that we have need of lord that's why we desire that you come and visit with us bless our pastor lord and sister leslie be with them lord and strengthen them and father wherever they are lord be with us also this morning for we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen it's always good to be gathered in the house of god let's turn our bibles in the book of jude where we read last time jude chapter 1 welcome everyone in the house of god trust that the lord will be your portion this morning and certainly speak to your heart it says jew the servant of jesus christ and brother of of james to them that are sanctified by by by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called mercy unto mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved he said when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exalt you that you should earnestly content for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints also let's turn to malachi chapter 4. the scripture read last time we're going to read from verse from verse 1 all the way to 6 it says behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and and all the proud year and older that do wicked shall be stumbled and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in its wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as a calves on the stall i'll realize you know even as we heard wednesday unto you so there's a certain group of people that this was sent to there was a certain message as all of this is happening there's a designated group of people that this this is going to happen to and he says and ye shall thread down the wicked for they shall be as as ashes unto the soul of thy feet in the in that day that sh that i shall do this say with the lord remember ye my law remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb on all israel with the statutes with the statutes and judgment behold i'll send to you elijah elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the children to the the heart of the children to the hearts of the father to the children and the heart of the children to the father lest i come and smite the earth with the curse also let's turn in luke 4 luke chapter 4 verse 1. it says and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and he was led of the spirit unto the wilderness and being shortly being 40 day tempted of the devil and in those days he did he did eat nothing and and when they were ended afterwards hungered and the devil said unto him if that be the son of god command the stone to be made bread and jesus answered and said saying it is written that men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes out of the mouth of god the word that comes by every word of god and the devil taking him upon the high mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in that moment in that moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will be will will i give to thee and the glory of them for the for that is delivered unto me and whomsoever i will give it what a boast they just basically let them know what this world belongs to it says and if thou therefore will worship me all all shall be dying and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan he said that for it is written that shall never worship yah shall never wash thou shall worship the lord thy god and him only well that will thou serve and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on the pentacle of the temple and he said unto him if thou be the son of god cast out down from hence for it is written that he shall he shall give his angel charges over deed to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest doubt that any time thou dashed our food against the stone and jesus answered and said unto him it is it is said thou shalt never attempt to load thy god and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season now remember it was just for a season he was not gone forever was just for a season and i just want to remind you our temptation and everything is just for a season it's going to come where it's going to be an end today man god bless you may have your seats also just keep your bibles open we're gonna read another scripture very from reader scripture it says now faith is the substance hebrews 11 1-3 it says faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen are not made of things that do appear in other words the visible was made by the invisible now i want to continue on the same thought we ministered on last time about contending for the faith of this hour we read this quote i thought i'll just launch off of here so just for the sake of time but ranam says in the message it deceived church by the world it says remember we are not on the picnic but we are in the battlefield many people just think that when you become a christian that that's all there is to it that's what you need to do that that that settles it forever as it says as they are christians and everything is going to come easy don't ever it says don't ever get that in your head so he's wanting us to change our thinking to change our approach to understand differently the things that we've conceived in our minds it says for i become a christian to fight to fight the good fight of faith i become a christian to get in the bottom line we are christian soldiers it says we we we got we got to be trained and brought up and know that all they know all the techniques of the enemy to know how to fortify to know how to fight the fight and we can only do it as the holy spirit will reveal it to us we cannot take what what some other nation some other nation tells us we when we go to war or some of the ideas but we've got to take our own ideas we gotta we've got to take our own ideas the way the holy spirit will direct us and when and then he says and what ideas he would give us because he is the commander in chief of the army of the christians so as we said last time we we want to understand that we are in the battle the battlefield uh uh we are in the battle as a christians we we can even say that it's a great time of testing of faith that every we understand that uh that that in this very time as we said it last time the world in such a chaos in such a time of confusion that the world is looking for a leader is looking for a savior someone to save it someone who has the solution someone who just know what he needs to do and and you can hear there's all kinds of solutions this ones are pulling this way that ones are pulling this way and i began to think even about this weekend i realized that the reason the word is in the chaos that it is is because god sent the savior god sent someone who had the solution to what the world needed to do and they rejected it and because they rejected it that's why they find themselves in the situation that they are in but random says that there's not a god always sends a warning before judgment god sent his word he revealed his word in this end time and this world rejected it god sent his son to come and die for the for the sins of the world and he gave off his own self he gave off his blood and the world rejected it you know even as a a messenger tells us that he came and he died upon the cross and he and he died for the sin of the whole world as far as i'm concerned as far as i'm concerned he died for every sin that was ever committed by mankind he didn't just die and say well i'll just cover the sins and not the others he covered everything and it was so for those that would believe in him to them that the scripture tells us to them that believe in him to them he gave power to become sons and daughters so we can sit here we realize that the world is there because they've rejected him and embraced science because they've rejected him and embraced the things that they are in and because of the rejection that's why they find themselves in the state that we are they are in and we can also say this morning we find ourselves in the position that we are in because we believe that god sent a message for us because we believe that god sent us a savior and we embraced him we took his instruction we followed the things that he said and and we realized that those things that we had received took us from the sins and from the darkness of the world and it took us from all over the places the scripture says that as he said he sent he sent forth his word and he was having a great feast it says go call my friends and all the the the people that he knew and they rejected it they refused to come to the feasts and even each and every one of them gave an excuse on why they couldn't make it oh i'm busy with this i'm busy with that and everything but it but the master said he didn't want his house to be empty that he had planned for a feast and he was going to have her feast and i want to tell you this there's a feast that's coming and nothing can change that there's a feast of the overcomers there's a feast prepared on that day and it's up to you and me to check if we're gonna be on the list but the feast is gonna happen the feast will happen because he already planned for it so he sent forth his servant he says now i want you to go in the byway and the highway and to call he said but my house will not remain empty that we will be filled and we find ourselves here because his house will not remain empty that he would call from the byways and highways he will call those that were predestinated to be part of the feast now the invitation was sent to all but the master knew who will come he was not surprised when they rejected it he was not shocked well i can't believe those people rejected my word because when he said and fall he knew that only his elected seed only those whose name was in the book of lamb the lamb book of life will receive that word and come and therefore that's why we are sitting here this morning why because we have heard a word we have heard a message we have heard a call that's why we are here this morning and so we realized as we said as you said the devil is here to challenge every promise that we are given uh but random tells us so we can know that we have to twist every promise out of his dirty hand you cannot claim to be healed and the devil just sit and look at you he will bring all the symptoms in the world he will shake you up by all the means he will try to get you to a place where you can start confessing something negative and say well i guess i'm not ill well i guess this is what's it's really not what i thought of and you can claim to have the holy spirit today the devil will shake you to the core to the place where you begin to even doubt do i even have it what does it mean do i even have it and all those things oh but i tell you praise be to god because he's giving a faith and he's giving a call of people in this end time that will contend for every promise that he's given them and there's not a devil in hell that can stop them when god has spoken it they will go after it why because they are contending for what they know god has shown them they are not containing for what man is saying they are contending for the word of god why because when god fixed it it's gonna come to pass why because if god's pocket his word has the power of creation to bring those things that don't exist and bring it into existence that's why the book of hebrews says that faith faith he says it's by faith it says it's my faith that we believe that the things which we have seen right now are made of things that don't exist in other words god spoke his word and the world come to pass god spoke his word and the mountain was god spoke his word and the son was god spoke his word and light was if the same god spoke those things into existence if he spoke a word in this end time it's going to come to pass why because it's the same god he hasn't lost his power he hasn't diminished in power he hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever and his word remains true that's the foundation of our christianity we are not here as wondrous wondering can god speak to me is it really real what's really going to happen and why where what is happening in the world no his word is certain if it's an uncertain sound it didn't come from him it came from the devil when he speaks to you it's clear and it's certain and his word is going to come to pass so he comes this enemy will come and he will challenge us to the core now we've been told that he was given access to the flesh in order for him to come and so he comes and and once the faith comes god speaks it with his word he will try to work by the means of the flesh to do everything that he can to cause you to disbelieve the world because he knows that if he can come to a place where he can cause you to disbelieve what god says then he will make you powerless then we will strip you of all the power then you don't have confidence when you go before god then you don't know what to ask then you don't know what to believe then you don't know what to believe in you stay in the state of confusion and that's exactly where he wants you to be this morning so we are here with the understanding that we are contending for something we are contending for the word and the promise of god that he made for us in his word we are here because there was a promise that was made revealed or made known unto us when we are contending for it how are we contending for it we're believing everything that is said and you ask me well how do you know it's going to work and i want to just tell you this morning i know that it's going to work because that word came and took you out of sin that word brought you into salvation that word gave you the holy spirit that word gave you deliverance that word brought you healing and that same word is gonna take you out of here that's how i know it's gonna work it's a god who speaks to you daily and he walks with you he talks with you he wants to guide you and to lead you that's how you know his word is true we're not here to teach people about the bible so they can have some intellectual understanding and and walk around quoting the scriptures and everything no we are here to point you through the bible so you can become the scripture so you can become the fulfillment of what the word of god said in this earth so you can recognize that i'm here because there was already a word spoken if there was no word smoking we might as well forget it and go home it's the promise of the hour what god spoke what he spoke that's what we are contending for and i was just moved wednesday as our brother just was speaking about the purpose of the message how that he brought up these two items i just wrote him down what is the purpose of the word of the end time even the messenger of the end time what's the real purpose of him coming he he we read it and he says the purpose of the message was to turn our hearts back to the apostolic apostolic faith of the the the back to the apostolic father faith and then also to reveal the mystery truth that is going to those uh divinely revealed mystery truth are the ones that will literally but venom use that word change the heart transform the heart those are the ones that will take your heart and change it those are the ones that as you hear the word the promised word as you you see the revealed mystery word as you see the messenger of malachi 4 come on the scene those things that you hear those things that have been spoken unto you they are the ones that are promised to bring you the change that you need now jude is saying now unto us that we need to diligently that i write to you diligently to write unto you of the common salvation and it was needful for me and to say unto you and i exhort you that you should earnestly content in other words by all means with all earnest earnest and we all power with everything within us we need to contend for it now why do we need to contend for it because the devil is fighting it why do we need to contend you don't contend for something that's not contested we're contending for it because there's an enemy at every corner at every verse at every corner of the promise trying to discredit the word of god he will try to add this and try to add title to take away here he'll try to present it in a way for you to to get confused he'll try to make the word of god complicated he'll do all things so he can bring you in a state of confusion but judy is telling us that i want you to focus i want you to keep your focus on the things that you've been spoken i don't want you to pay attention to what's happening out there he said that man is come there's men that will come unaware those people that will be coming to the church and to create all kinds of confusion he says by you you keep your eyes on what the promises you keep your eyes on the reveal word that god has shown you the word of promise i was sent to you that's what you need to keep your eyes on we don't need to keep our eyes on what's happening out there it's total confusion in other words i want to just say this again it's designed so it can draw you in so you can go fight for it so you can go look for it so you can go say something about it so you can go and become one of it so you can go and in doing that the devil is bringing destruction it's trying to confuse you it's trying to stray you away because the moment you step into that there's something else that you got to go fight for it's not the end of it it's the devil that's why the bible the messenger tells us that we have to recognize the devil and every single one of his tricks now i want to say this if it's 80 of the world we don't go into it if it's 99 of the world we don't go into it it has to be a hundred percent the word or it's not the word they will uh are presented in such a way to create compassion and to create a an idea something that a man can easily justify his own senses and say well this is not this and this and in doing that division just comes and he begins to draw you astray he says that you earnestly contend for the faith and the things that has been revealed to you so he writes unto us he wants us to remember those things he says remember that that you earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints i began to think about the phrasing that was delivered on the day of pentecost this was a group of people that jesus called in and they had left everything for him and they followed him and here he is before he departs he asks them to go and wait in the upper room and they go up and wait in the upper room and the promise of the father comes to pass in the midst something that jesus told them he says i have to go but i'll send you a comforter and the comforter came why when they found themselves obeying what they had told them to do to stay in the upper room to stay in the message to stay listening to the tapes to stay following what the trip said to say following what the world said when they were doing what they were instructed to do then the promise of the father came and found them in the upper room and there were people that sold everything and they were about the father's business and nothing else they became a people about manifesting what they had received and that's the standard that jesus said and that standard has never changed we don't get in the message by education we don't get because we can quote run him we just know exactly what he said what he said it and now that's enough for us no we have to seek for the holy spirit so we can be filled with the holy spirit and walk and be about our father's business and be a people that are led by the spirit just like those in the upper room that has never changed because people think well you know because i can just understand and i can read the message i can read the bible anybody can take the message anybody can take anybody with common sense can put some of these things together it can look and say well you know this sounds to be true and this is this and this is that and that's not enough what you need is for a comforter to come and confirm to you that's what you're reading is the word of almighty god and make it known unto you where you experience it is not just something you can quote but something that you know within your life that god has done for you that's the foundation of a christian life and that will never change why because that's how god calls his son and daughter the prophet tells us that it's by one spirit that we are all baptized it's not by writing our name so going to a certain church and doing this and doing that no it's the children of god are those that are led by the spirit of god and then god chooses to reveal his word to them so we know that the world system is not designed to make us successful christians it's designed to make us look crazy you know you you look at all the commentating and everything every time they talk about people and churches it's just like the people those people that have lost their minds what are they thinking you know it's it's never they never you never hear them speak about religious people with a kind and understanding well you know they believe in something and there was no everybody else believing something except christians that's how it's presented oh they're a bunch of crazy people what are they going to do over there you know they need to shut down churches they need to do this and they need to do that it's the tactic of the enemy it's the tactic of the enemy they need to shut down the fellowship they need to shut down they need to do this and you know you go everything is stopped you know you can't do this you can't go here you can't do this you can't do this so many things you can do but i'm glad this morning that there's something that the devil cannot stop and that is that we are going in the rapture and it's already started and nothing can stop it [Applause] and that is that we are going to be out of here and that process has already begun when did it begin when the messenger showed up on the scene god activated the process god began his process of calling his children back home and that has already started and nothing can stop him so the scripture tells us here in hebrews 11 it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for just want you to stay with me for a moment and try not to be too long it's the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtain a good report it says that it's through faith we understand that the world we're framed by the word of god in other words there's an understanding that we get by faith that you don't get through knowledge to science or to anything else there's an understanding that comes not an explanation there's an understanding that comes by faith where god has shown something to you you don't have the words or the element to explain it you cannot use the things around it to explain what it is but all you know is i heard something something happened and that's what i believe god opened my eyes to see something and i'm not moving god has done something for me and you may not see it but something within my heart that testify that i've been changed that i've been made whole that faith brings an understanding it takes you from wherever you are it blesses you to a place where you understand what god is saying you may not be able to explain it to man but within you you know that something has happened so it says that the world was afraid that the things which are seen were not made of those things that do appear in other words the invisible made the visible the invincible is making fault visible so through faith now it says faith uh by faith we know that god created the earth the heaven and earth we know that the word of god tells us that god created the animals the kingdoms and the the birds and all the things and the order and the things that we we see and the scripture says it's by faith as we read it that the elders obtained a good report in other words the things which they were contending for the things which they were desiring to see they were able to obtain it through faith it didn't say by their strength but their understanding by their knowledge by what they were able to achieve no by faith in other words able offered up a sacrifice by receiving a faith or a revelation from god on what he needed to do now we could sit here and debate all day about how that he received it now but my name tells us that remember he said that cain he says that if all that god desired was that was just an offering cain should have fulfilled it too but somehow abel was able to hear directly from god by reading the word of god by receiving the same instruction something spoke to him differently from the same word from god coming down to him and telling him exactly what was needed revelation is god speaking directly to your heart revelation is not by knowledge by reading the bible and gathering up the what it says and everything we know that every church of the colonel uses the bible every single one of them but not all of them has the revelation of what god is requiring out of the word that is spoken that's why we needed the messenger to come to us and show us what the mystery truths were revealed to tell us what time we were living in what god requires for this time and how that god was going to fulfill it in other words it was by faith that those things would happen it was by faith that david took down goliath it was by faith that daniel when he was in the darling stanton about to be eaten up and just sitting in there it was by faith that he walked in there knowing that the same god will protect him in other words in order for you and i to obtain the result it's not going to come by our understanding or our education how we elevate ourselves and all by the somehow we've gathered up and known the secret no it's by god revealing it to your heart that how he's gonna do it and you take him as in his word and god will come and give you what you have need of what it tells us the senses were made were not meant for us to contact god by the five senses but you realize that mankind uses the five senses for everything including god if can if they cannot feel to god by the five senses it means it's not god if they cannot see him or touch him or understanding within the five senses that was not god but god made it that we can only contact him through faith in other words when he spoke he speaks his word somebody takes his word then god comes and makes his word true why because his word is attached with his face his word has the creative power his word when he lands somewhere it produces on its own what god requires so the prabhupada preaches a message uh faith uh the key to the door and i'll just read some statement quickly so i can continue on for the sake of time now we realize in the messages he shows us that faith is the key faith is the key so he says it speaks and i'll just summarize it quickly that phrase is the key so when you have a key there has to be some door or or some lock somewhere that needs to be open faith is designed to open the door and then he tells us that the door and and when there's a door there's also an assumption that there is something of great value that's been hidden there's something of great value something that is not made accessible to everybody something that is hidden from the wise and the prudent from those that will search it from those that will try to probe it from those that will try to understand it that door is there to block it but the faith is the key that opens the door and gives you access to those things but when it makes a statement it says and i'll just paraphrase it it says that jesus is the door to happiness jesus is the door to deliverance jesus is the door to uh deliverance and jesus is the door to rapture so in other words jesus is the door jesus is the word and faith is the key now i want you now to stop putting it together and for every key that there is there has to be only a particular door that that king can open there's only a particular door that that key will open in other words you cannot take the key of this age and go try to open noah's message you cannot take the key for this work and try to open uh isaiah message there was a message for this end time and the key has been given to each and every one of you for you to tap into this resources of god for you to tap into the economy of god and be able to redraw the things that are hidden for everybody else [Applause] there is a key that's been given to you to give you access to the revelation of the word of god in this hour and what it will do to you in other words the key to the rapture the key to the body change has been given to you by faith so you can go to that door the word of god and put in your key and open it right up what madam says that when he talks about the sword coming into his hand he says that what we need is a hand of faith that will take hold of that word and drive it into the enemy's heart and i want to say to you this morning what we need is a hand of faith that will take hold of that key and open up all those blessings that god has stole for us in this end time [Applause] that's what we have received the scripture says the hebrews 10 and 23 it says let us hold forth let us hold fast for the profession of our faith without weathering in other words without compromising in james 1 and 6 it says for he that waveth is like a wave of sea driven from the wind and toast about wind and toast in other words yeah we are we have access we have been given the key to open the promises of god and i want to say this respectfully we don't need a new word we don't need a new something what we need is our faith to rise up this key that we have in order for us to open the word that has been revealed to us in order for us to get access to the rapture in faith because our prophet told us that rapturing faith is contained within those sales those opening of the sales revealed to us what the plan of redemption was and everything that god wanted to do so what we need is to get this key and go open a door and begin to walk in it and i want to say this to every son and daughter of god the faith that god has given you it's not so much that you need another faith that faith just needs to be raised up it just needs to be taken up to a place where just like you believe about your your holy spirit that you have received the same way you believe in your healing that you will believe in this body change that's the program of god that's what we need to hold fast now the word of god tells us that man was created in the image of god now i want to just speak now on what we are contending for god the word of god tells us that man was created in the image of god i didn't write it down because just for the sake of time there was just a lot of quotes i didn't want to read all of it now it says man was created in the image of god and i thought about it this morning the world tells you that you've come from some animals or some monkey now is it surprising that men will start acting like animals like monkeys because that's where they told them they came from whatever you believe is that's what you become [Applause] is it surprising that people are acting like animals no because that's what they told them that they came from but there's a people this morning they have been told differently they heard from the word and the message of the hour that i told them that they came from the mind of god and that they're going back to god they're told that in the beginning that they were with god they were made in the image of god and that causes them to act like god that causes them to walk like god to behave like god to take hold of situations to think like god to walk like god to believe like god to do everything like god will do why because that's why they came from that's what i believe they've been coming for and the word of god tells us in fact the word of god is really deceased if god says it was created man to have dominion man was not created so he can become a beggar or somebody of low estate and say oh someone who just as they seem to stumble from trouble to trouble and all just this never gets everything right the man was created to be in the image of god the prophet said that god was the god of the universe but he created the earth for man so man can have dominion i'm talking about what kind of faith we should be contending for so he says that man was created there so he can have dominion man god took of his mind and he transferred it into his son because his son was the image of who he was so when he will come down in the cool of the evening and adam has moved this and done this and done this god will just look and smile why because he knew that's my son that's my boy that's me right there that's me right there why because it was the mind of god that he came from and verbatim tells us that if you have the holy spirit you always had it because you cannot come from god and become something else [Applause] you are not animals you didn't come from monkeys you came from the image of god you are a god what you need this morning is just to raise up in faith let the same god who saved you the same god who redeemed you bring you in such a place where you begin to take every spirit under your control for the glory of the kingdom of god that's the kind of phrase we need to walk into we cannot be just tumbling from trouble to trouble always never seem to get there it always seemed like it's two more steps before we get there it always seems like we just got to take another hop to get there it seems like there's always something else we got to do just so we can get it right no if you're away with god in the beginning you couldn't change now sin came and caused the fall that man fall but even in this fallen state there was something within the heart of this man that knew something about god that would cry out even though it would not happen but there was something within him that knew this is not what i need to be this is not what i have to be there's something wrong about this picture i don't like what i see this is not what i was going to be when you see your son shaken your daughter's sickle your son-in-law so you see a tragedy come up something rises up within the heart this is not right it's not supposed to be this way something is terribly wrong what is that it's god [Applause] it's god in your calling for god it's god in you calling for the manifestation to come on the scene where i can just step right into it and speak the word the purpose the very original concept and desire that god created men for it was not so we can just come on earth and get married and have children and buy houses and buy cars and worry about how low our bank accounts are getting and our jobs and our everything and when we lose our job and do we lose our minds that was never the purpose we're looking at it from a totally wrong angle what is said is we will put the air so we can have dominion and i tell you this word of god when you receive the message of the hour it takes you a baptizer with the holy spirit it gives you the same desire that adam had in the garden of eden where he looked at nature and there's a desire within him to just take suggestion to just take it and bring it under his control and so so god created man and he says god was the god of the whole earth but man was given to be dominion over the earth he says god he created the spirit man first and he took of this spirit man he placed him into a body of flesh why so he can contact the earth that we was put in the the the scripture says there was no man to till the earth so i want you every time you think about the flesh you think about the earth because there was a connection between the tilling of the earth the fixing of the earth with the connection with the flesh that was given to him but the connection with god was not had nothing to do with the flesh the connection with god has all to do with the spirit that was put within the man so he says and and so we find out that god's original conception when he made his man was so he can be in his image so he can be in his likeness to have dominion it says and then the prophet tells us that we confess that's why we are required he tells us that we need to have a positive confession the world is in the state that retail because of the confession they made they talked about being from animals and monkeys and now they're behaving like it now listen to this in the message who is god probably says i'm only on the 6th right john it says and when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember god will make your body come into your confession i want you to hold that god will make your body come into your confession it says and if you say you are drunken and i want to drink don't worry you will soon be one if you say i'm a sinner and i want to sin you will be right back into it and if you say i'm a christian i believe all along god will bring your testimony will bring you right into it why it says because it's the high priest of our confession now remember all of this is based on the fact that the world has gone forth this confession is not your own confession it's based upon the promises of god and what he called you to be so i don't care how long it takes i don't care what it takes i don't care how many times he said i don't care what sin it is all i care about is what are you confessing this morning [Applause] it says your testimony will bring you to believe if you believe in healing and you believe that god has healed you confess it god will make your body obey your confession [Music] you mean to tell me it's about my confession oh i'm confessing about the times this morning i'm confessing right to this morning i'm confessing even this morning i'm convincing every policy in the focus now why it's about my confession and he's the high priest he takes your confession and he brings him before the father and he makes stuff confession come true why because it's his word that you are confessing so he says sitting right in the right hand of the father with his own blood making an accession for you for any confession anything that he died for and he died to read your sin and sickness as a result of sin he was wounded for our transgression he was stripped for our healing remember that have faith don't waver stand in other words he's telling you what you need to confess and what you need to stand for he continues on in the message for as the father the thing that the thing to do is to know that you are coming to fulfill a promise that god made you that's very important we are not here to manifest our own ideas i know i'm saying it over and over but that's the key it's the word of god it's always the word of god it's always what god said it says there's going to be a thousand people praying praying for you it says and you've got to come by this line and when we pray lay hands on you as soon as your hand is laid upon you you you you just like to rise up out of the water and be baptized you've done something that god gives you the promise on what would happen he that believed and baptized shall be saved you go right out of this building testify you were saved what if you go out of the building and say well i don't know then you are not saved it says but god will make your body obey your confession it says see is the high priest of our confession before you can be healed you have to confess it you have to believe you are healed and then when you believe you are healed god makes your body to your body obey your confession so now when you come here just like a settle says this is this is your commandment i'll believe i'm healed walk off the platform and say now i just want to bring this to attention i know i'm i'm bringing this down but remember this is the simplicity of the gospel of jesus christ this this is not just for healing i know the prophet is mentioning it for healing for deliverance for all those things but this applies to every promise of god in fact i would not even be able to get there but what random says this the keystone revelation of the entire bible under which he was able to even place all the messengers of the all the new of the other messengers of the church hedge book and everything it says there was one key cornerstone and that is that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he hasn't changed the key confession is what he did yesterday he will do today and he will do tomorrow the key is i have seen it in the bible i have seen him do this once and i'm believing it it's gonna do it again the key confession is i've seen it and nothing can change it amen what about him talks about the blind man john john ryan it says here it comes and he comes and he was prayed for he came and said i thought i was healed he says well i thought you believe i wonder if something in john's ryan heart began to just be lifted up i'm blind you mean i can see if i could just confess it if i could just continue to confess it it says well if it's up to me then i'll confess it oh my goodness he went everywhere just confessing press hell when he was doing this i'm here in fact with him says even in meetings when he's preaching he'll just stand up right back in the middle of the service praise god i'm healed praise god i'm healed praise god uphill somebody may have thought he's getting out of head he's getting out of place he's doing something crazy but that didn't matter to him he knew what he was looking for my brother my sister oftentimes we let the eyes of the other person just hold us down when we have need of god and we need things and we don't want people to know i need a holy ghost i need this i need this i encourage you to be like johnny this what morning didn't matter what people thought about him he had heard the word of god the messenger told him that it was hell and he believed it i wonder how many times he was made fun of i wonder how many times we are made fun of for believing in a messenger i wonder how many times people look at us those people must be crazy you don't want to say something man those people if you haven't been to one of them services have you ever seen another dress and they don't have tv you they don't have tvs not in their home they apply the talking they don't believe in short dresses no hearing you know man i haven't seen that they don't believe in women preachers oh i can't believe that they don't believe it those people must have lost their minds and so another one he goes to a barber and now we're sitting and i don't know how many times that barbara made fun of him and yeah it's just one day he just thought he would make fun of him like he did before he said john i heard that you were healed and you went to the meeting down there of the holy roller i heard you scream over and over when you were selling newspapers i heard you say this and say that that you were healed oh he said now i want you to realize he didn't say i was here he said i am healed let me tell you this when you confess it may take time for the holy ghost to come up it may take time for the manifestation but you don't worry about it he turned away [Applause] and as he was about to make fun of him just one more time his eyes came open who was laughing who was laughing now who was laughing there who was laughing at that time i tell you they may make fun of us all day long we will have the final life [Applause] nobody in the church oh let's go to that one's home nobody's in there oh let's look over here nobody said who will have the last laugh i tell you the word of god will come to pass you keep confessing the positive you keep believing this message god will bring his word to come we avoid the the people making fun we we want to shy away we avoid the negative that comes with it we avoid i'm just looking for the right word the the the challenge and the pain and and the trials that comes with believing something everything you believe it comes with a challenge we just said everything that you believe comes with a ridicule there's something that the devil wants to read the cue there's something about us that's just off that doesn't look right and everything and they want to read to kill that and i tell you what i'm saying the final showdown will be the rapture the final showdown will be to change your body those that believe in this word they are guaranteed by the word of god those that have the token will be taken out of here before this world goes into a chaos those that have believed the word of god just like he did remember the cornerstone is he's the same yesterday today and forever now i want to just add this and say now remember we spoke about peter all the time how that he he sunk how that he tried and he was drowning but don't forget peter walked on water peter heard the word come forth he believed it he believed it and jumped upon the water that's what the scripture tells us immediately when he heard it he didn't say well i know you've spoken but let me go pray let me just go find out if it's the mind of the lord or not then i'll come back no the scripture says jesus says come and he came and he walked on water and the messenger tells us when he got his eyes off of the lord when he began to look at the circumstance when he began to look at everything around him that's what caused him to sing my brother my sister let's keep our eyes on the message of the hour let's keep our eyes on the reveal word of the yahuwah don't look to the left don't look to the right don't look at the corona don't look at this don't look at anything why because the moment let me tell you this this is very key to our faith of a believer it's god who brought you here this morning we we should never forget it don't think i just washed up i put my clothes on i ate my food i drove and i dropped my car i came here that's the natural but don't always look at the natural faith says that it came from the things that were not seen that were brought into manifestation you hold the word of god you believe the word of god you believe that you are here because god wanted you to hear this this morning god wanted you to sit here this morning and that god will take what he told you and bring him to pass but i wanna ask has god lost control no just because we have a little trouble does that mean that he lost control of what's supposed to happen no in fact he let all those things come to pass so he can bring himself and come to a place where he can manifest himself we'll continue another time if the musician could come he says he says we must never say that don't ever let your testimony be negative if i can encourage you this morning don't ever let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i'm saved i have god in my heart i believe he i believe him with all my heart do you believe in divine healing with all my heart it says let your testimony always be always your testimony always and your thought and everything never permit negative thought to come into your mind if you can help it and then it says when it starts don't retain it well you say i can't i can't i can't stop a bird from flying over my plate over his place but you could stop it from rusty that's that's that's good see you can help the thought when it comes but don't entertain it just pass it on no sir jesus christ is my savior things it says all things are mine by god i'm going to keep it we have to have that same testimony in closing i just want to skip and just get to this for a moment but one of them talks about the woman from memphis they said that she had a desire within her heart a son was dying now but madame says that she she if you read it it says in different places that she knew how she got the son she knew that she couldn't have a son and god allowed her to have a son and this son that god has given him her went into the world and contracted the social disease and here she was and faith within her began to rise and that she went in the bible and faith within her caused her to identify herself with the shumanite woman now i want you to realize this she was able to identify herself with the shumanite woman because she knew how that woman got the son she knew that he must have been by god but there she was no way that she could get it by herself it was god that gave her and he knew that that son came from god and she knew that when that son died that he took that son and he took him to the prophet then he went and find the prophet and he took the son and laid on the bed and she knew the whole story so what she did is she raised she let her phrase raise up now remember we're talking about confession and what we're contending for so she came to a place where she identified who she was she identified how she got her son but the only thing that was missing was elijah she understood that the scenery was just perfect that everything fit but there was just one thing that was missing elijah was not there and so she began to pray and pray and pray and god revealed to her that a person was gonna come and pray for her son she rose up early in the morning i'm talking about faith this morning yeah i tell you sometimes what random says i didn't even get to it it says we ask god and it doesn't happen and we walk away well you know maybe you'll give me another time and maybe this is not my time i'll just wait no this woman she believed what she saw in the bible and it was revealed to her that someone was going to come that way to pray for her son she woke up early in the morning she stood there on the fence [Music] i'm talking my friend she stood there on the fence i wonder how many people walk by and ask well if your son is dying why aren't you in there taking care of him and why are you standing over the fence and just standing there no she saw something and nothing was going to move her she stood there and god redirected an airplane from wherever it was going and got it to land into memphis and caused the messenger to come out and begin to walk without going way knowing where he was going my brother my sister if god can do that so that just for healing are you with me this morning just for healing so that that son could be healed but one day die how much more for your soul this morning for what you have need off for what we call upon him for god will bankrupt heaven before every single one of his promises fall to the crowd the messenger came and he began to walk it and now the scripture did the prophet didn't tell us that well when he woke up in the morning he had a vision of what's going to happen no in fact god didn't even tell him all god told him was just walk all god told him was just walk he just kept walking and singing one of them and one of them one of them he was supposed to go leave the mail he was go supposed to post the the the the mail so he can go back and catch his plan and he's aware that his plan is going to be late that he's going to miss it but god spoke to him what can he do if god can sow cut up his prophet and bring him to come and do those things how much more of the word that is talking about you in this end time i just want you to hear this before we close he says and if the bride is the word then she's got to be of christ part of the bridegroom she's got to be the word the word not for for the word not for his day the word for this day he is promised that he will do that he would do this that he would do this day and he send the word forth in the mold to mold this bride and make her hope you see it don't get some ideas of your own don't let somebody else idea take a foundation uh of the bible what he says it says god has promised in his word how he would choose his void in this last day how is he going to do it he promised his promise he promised it how he would do it how is uh it was by by his original plan by choosing christ choosing the time choosing the season he can't miss it he's right because it's part of his word he can't choose it by denomination when he didn't choose it when he didn't choose it when he didn't choose christ by denomination did he did christ come by denomination did he come by any denomination no they rejected him well that's what denomination then it says then when he chooses the bride he he came he can't come he he when he chooses the bride can he come any other way how did this how did christ come here by his word or by the words of the prophet he says is that right how will the bride be how would the bride be he be here by the words of the prophet how did he identify when he came by a man with the spirit of elijah upon him come out of the wilderness how will he identify the bride he promised in malachi chapter 4 the same thing before he destroys the earth this is this day was not the day of sodom remember sodom burn right there the word the world is burning jesus said it's it's to be the time like luke 17 chapter and verse 30. it's the day will be the sodom and gomorrah then the son of man will be revealed and then what would happen according to malachi 4 he will burn the earth again and the righteousness in the millennium will walk upon the ashes of the wicked is that right so we are right at the end we are sitting at the doorstep now waiting for it to come everything you spoke there has happened what are we contending for the promised world that is being revealed to us let's all stand the promised world that has been revealed to us and i want to just say to us this morning it's simple it's not supposed to be complicated let's believe the word of god for everything within us he will reveal it to us little by little word by word verse by verse so we can have the rapturing faith that we have need of in order for us to go in the rapture let's just bow ahead our gracious father how we're so thankful for your word father we come before you lord lord realizing that we have need of you now more than any other time your prophet told us that one thing that we need to pray for more than anything is the revelation it's the understanding of who you are and what you are doing we prayed this morning lord that the word that went forth father that he may just create a faith in our hearts where you can come and vindicate it lead us and guide us lord in all truth and righteousness we commit everything we are to you lord ask that you bless each and every one lord if there's anybody here with the need in our heart lord you know what the need is and we pray that you just speak to them father because you promise you'll do it we commit
