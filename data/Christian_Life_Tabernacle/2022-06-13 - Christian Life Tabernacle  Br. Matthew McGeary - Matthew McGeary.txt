capable hands the lord jesus christ amen oh praise this wonderful name my it's good to be a christian amen we're going to be uh just speaking to you for a little bit by god's help if you want to go ahead and turn in your bibles to john chapter 16. amen always like to keep my bible up here open while i'm preaching there was one time i i don't know how it come into my mind but i went to close it and something said you're not preaching from a closed book so i said okay i just i like to keep it open so if you ever see me struggling around or whatnot i i just like to keep it open john 16 we'll be reading verses 12 and 13 amen how many feel good this evening wonderful praise god john chapter 16 verse 12 would read i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now how be it when he so they were not able to bear it at this time but he's showing them that when the time comes how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whosoever he but whosoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen we ask a blessing upon the reading of the word you may be seated also we'd like you to turn with us in our bibles to first corinthians chapter two i just love this chapter it would be good just to read the whole thing for the sake of time we'll start with verse nine amen we'll just see how the lord uh would lead us um right now just to uh see how how which want to lay a foundation and it might just be a foundation the whole time could be a lot of quotes and a lot of scriptures but we just want to lay it in there this thought we have on our heart and uh just reading in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 9 through 16 would read like this first corinthians chapter 2 verse 9 it says but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of men the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but i like this next verse but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him so if we were left to our own self if we were left our own devices if we were left our own thinking then the only thing we could ever think of the only thing that we could ever perceive would be what we would experience in this natural realm as a man and that's what the whole world is doing they're basing all their thoughts and all their ideas and all through life experiences because that's the only thing that they can judge their life by is by the spirit that's within them but he says for what knoweth a man the things of man say the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god so the only way we could know the things of god is by what by the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world come on we have not received the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us oh praises wonderful names something has been given to the bride in the end time we have received something which things also we speak not in words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teaches so what what do we want to teach us the holy ghost god has ordained a five full ministry but it takes that great tutor it takes the holy ghost to take that word and to bring it and reveal it to your heart and to teach it to you which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him who hath known the mind of god oh he paul lays down this question who has known the mind of god and if if if we were to maybe if we were to ask ourselves that question and we were trying to to speak from a natural man if we're trying to speak from the spirit of a man and say oh my who has known the mind of god but you realize that's what man has been doing all down through the church ages they've been probing at the mind of god with the spirit of a man maybe many times they're trying to to figure it all out and they're trying to say well this is maybe what he meant in this symbol and that type and they're trying to reason amongst them but oh when god comes by by divine revelation and by the holy ghost that teaches us these things here the messenger to the age paul he's saying oh who hath known the mind of the lord or who may instruct him but look at these words that follow what a statement what a declaration that that he could stand there and write to those corinthians and say but we have the mind of christ oh if that don't make you excited in the hour and the season that we're living in that we have the mind of christ i want to speak to you a little bit uh this evening on the deep things of god revealed by the spirit the deep things revealed the deep things of god revealed by the spirit and in the pergamy and church age the prophet would say this in the church age book i'm going to try to be measured uh uh focused uh not not get too excited try to try to plumb a line here plow a plow a path we'll see how that god would lead but in the permian church age it says in john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things we are trying to have them able to bring this up for you so you can follow along we just maybe gonna lay in quote after quote and and just uh maybe bring something before you and then if god would lead maybe we'll come back later and and break some of these things down but we just feel in our heart just to move uh uh uh quickly through some of these things pergamy and church age in john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send to my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you here again we find the word coming because of the spirit of god we find the word coming because of the spirit of god again in john 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth word is come he will guide you into all truth thy word is truth and he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear word of god shall that shall he speak word and he will show you things to come notice he will show you things to come spirit bringing the word of prophecy not just i want to highlight that and emphasize that the spirit bringing the word of prophecy i want you to note very carefully that jesus did not say the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth [Music] the evidence of the holy ghost in your life is that you are in truth thy word is truth you would be in the word of god for your age oh hallelujah evidence has to do now follow this evidence has to do with receiving that word so that word that has come in our age the spirit of truth that has brought the word of prophecy that has come by divine promise the evidence that the holy ghost is in your life is that you're in the truth that god has delivered in this age all the deep things of god revealed by his spirit so we see that paul here is writing he said oh i have not seen nor ear heard neither has it entered into the hearts and minds of men's those things that god has prepared to them but god has revealed them to us by his spirit look jesus was telling the disciples i have many things to say to you i have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them right now it's not the time it's not the season this isn't the hour i can tell you these things that i want to tell you but there's coming a time there's coming a season i'm making a way i've got these very things these truths these words that i want to speak to you i'm going to send the holy ghost i'm going to send the comforter and he's going to lead you he's going to guide you into all truth and all righteousness then it would be the time then it would be the season that these things that i want to say to you i can't say them right now or maybe they're sealed up maybe i haven't revealed them but there's coming a time there's coming an hour there's coming a season that i'm going to reveal these words that i want to speak to you but oh it's not the time right now but the time is coming when that spirit of prophecy comes when the holy ghost come he's going to teach you and lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness what is the evidence of the holy ghost it's receiving the word of your age which has come by what the spirit of prophecy is come by malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 we're walking in the light as he was in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all our sins and so as we as we just look back into the bible and and we ponder these things we can look at abraham the father of our faith and you pick up there in genesis 12 and abraham was a heaven name was abram he was a heaven and he come from a heathen family but what made abraham different god had a plan for his life that's what made abraham different abraham's name was on the lamb's book of life abraham was a predestinated a child of god that god had a purpose that he wanted to work out in abraham's life see he was just an ordinary man just like you or i or would be a ordinary if you would just maybe look at the world in a whole head there's many of us that have come from certain uh the same conditions and same countries and and people have worse stories and some people have better stories but sure we could find people we have things in common and oh i you know yeah i lived over here you lived over there oh my family went through this i went through that yes my family come from that all of those things but what makes you different the call of god upon your life and that's what made abraham different there in genesis 12 because there came a call unto abraham and there came a call and god made abraham a promise and all of a sudden you see something set forth in abraham now in genesis 12 there's a call of god upon his life and we can start to look into abraham's life and just see how god started to deal with him and god made him a promise god made abraham a promise and he said this promise is unto you and your seat after you and the brother brandon would actually take two books and he would he would set them up in front of the church and he said now i'm going to set two books up like this so that you can see that the promise was to abraham and his seed after him so that we can see if the way god dealt with abraham then he's going to deal with us we know the natural seed that was promised was isaac but the spiritual seed the royal seat was christ and the way that god dealt with abraham he deals with the royal seed what when he made him an unconditional covenant he made it an unconditional promise that said abraham it ain't about what you've done it ain't about what you can do but this is something that i'm doing this is something that i have chosen to do i'm making an unconditional covenant with you abraham that you're going to be a father of many nations i'm going to give you a promised land and there's nothing abraham this doesn't have to do with what you're going to do this has nothing to do with your abilities this has nothing to do with you bringing the promise into manifestation this has everything to do with the unconditional covenant that i've made with you and now we can actually see abraham in his journey in the book of genesis and how genesis 12 there's a type of sanctification the call of god upon abraham's life and then you jump over it you go the 13th chapter 14th chapter 15 chapter you find now that god starts to confirm the covenant with abraham uh a type of sanctification we can see these types of that how god dealt with abraham we see a type how he deals with us we see a type how he deals with the church how he deals with the individual how he deals with the church ages so we see in genesis chapter 12 it's justification it's a call of god upon his life and then comes genesis chapter 15 and now now he's sanctifying he's confirming the covenant with abraham and then you have a couple more chapters later and then now we're into chapter 17 and in chapter 17 now what is he doing he's he's changing his name he's given the seal of circumcision a type of the holy ghost a type of the restoration of the gifts in the church uh what is he doing god is moving his son that he has a plan for his life he's moving him deeper into the promise deeper into the manifestation i know my thoughts that i think towards you thoughts of peace not thoughts of evil to bring you to an expected end oh when god called you he didn't just call you call you out to say okay now you're identified with me make something of it no that's not what he did but he called you for a purpose this just comes to mind you i mean you don't go down to uh to walmart and buy a paint brush and bring it home and throw it on the counter and say well paint brush do your job and walk over just say you're a paint brush you ain't painted one thing in here paintbrush is going to look at you like you're the one who brought me home from the store i didn't buy me you bought me oh hallelujah hallelujah there was a price that i couldn't pay but god rich and mercy he's the one that bought you he's the one that paid the price oh don't you want to just run and scream and shout when our pastor read that quote look the only ones where the blood can be applied if your name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world you're the only ones that the blood can be applied because you're the one that he died for then if he died for you don't you think he has a plan for your life he just shouldn't take you out of the pawn shop to just throw you away but no he has plans for he's going to take the wrapper off of you he's going to dip you in the paint bucket he's going to get you all soaked up and saturated with that good old paint and then he's going to what he's going to do he's going to take you and he's going to start putting the strokes on the wall the great master is going to put you in the service oh we need the holy ghost to pick us up and put us into service the problem is some of us don't want to come out the store i like i like people watching i like hearing the specials i like my pretty little rapper i look good in this little rapper 5.99 i got value don't take that off from me it tells you tells everybody how much i'm worth and we're all worth what about 27 cents oh my i'm getting inspired now like that violin or it seemed like it had no value i tell you what there's a lot of crayons there's a lot of markers there's a lot of paint brush the only value it has is what it's made out but whose hand is it in oh put that in the hand of a master and let them go to work and it's it's invaluable it's worth ten thousand worlds i said god i want to be in your hand so here we find the journey of abraham uh god dealing with him through through through the book of genesis uh chapter 12 uh justification chapter 15 sanctification chapter 17 now the holy ghost but the prophet i'm bringing us this way because i want to show you something because the prophet and in grace covenant uh the prophet would preach a sermon called uh abraham's grace covenant the the prophet is showing something uh it's it's really good so in genesis chapter seven he appeared as almighty god hell shady i the blessed god nurse from me i'm going to give you strength abraham you can't do it on your own but i'm going to give you my very life because it's going to me be me that's changing you and bringing you into position that you can receive the promise not something that you've done abraham oh my bride this isn't something that you're doing on your own but i'm el shaddai i'm the breast of god i'm going to nurse you i'm going to nourish you and bring you into a place of maturity you weren't able to bear it back there you weren't able to receive these things that i had to say but now we've come to the time we've come to the hour the hours at hand for the church that i no longer call you church i call you bride that the greater works are going to come into manifestation you don't have to cry anymore i'm bringing you to a place where you can speak the word the prophet would say uh abraham's grace company saying after he called him by justification sanctified him through the blood of the covenant given his own life in the 17th chapter the baptism of the holy ghost now what comes next in israel some of you bible scholars know there are no bible scholars here the placing of sons justification sanctification holy ghost but now we're moving in we're in the hour of the placing of sons we're coming into a maturity now we're we're not babes in christ anymore oh we don't have to be panted and petted and begged to come to church and and pleaded with and babied and and all this trial and that trial and getting all fussed up and and fighting and and getting in online battles with people you don't even know that the message is right quit wasting your time uh with those demons out there on the internet like you're going to talk one of them into even if you could talk them into the message guess what if their name wasn't on the lamb's book of life the blood couldn't even be applied oh if you want to really witness to somebody get in front of him look him in the eye tell him what god did for you say what he did for me he can do for you oh we're coming into maturity we move on down in that same service well we'll be reading right around paragraph 164 he says all these years now watch the prophet is showing a beautiful type there in the book of genesis because he's showing look at chapter 12 and then it was a couple chapters later several years later chapter 15 a couple chapel chapters later several years later but then he's shown but right quick in the same chapter when the restoration of the gifts came there wasn't that much time watch how beautiful this he says all these years from justification to sanctification was a lap of years from sanctification till the confirmation the holy ghost was years but in the same chapter he placed him after the holy ghost pentecost is just something years old you know he began to place his sons martin luther preached justification years and years come sanctification years and years come the baptism of the holy ghost but right quick after pentecost did the same thing that the rest of them did then he began to pull his sons that stood for his truth he give them something special magnified and before the people with a certain thing that stood out see placed him see we're living in the hour of adoption we're living in the hour of the placing of sun oh don't you realize they're in the 1906 uh uh they're there the the spirit was poured out there on isuzu street there in los angeles and the spirit went to working mighty works through the people as there was a restoration of the gifts of the holy ghost in the church oh but but you look back at the church when when justification was preached then years 100 years later then comes sanctification 100 years later then come the restorations of the gift but then right quick in the same chapter in the same age in the same age that there was the outpouring of the restoration of the gift now right quick god moves in because what does he want to do he wants to bring the church or bring the bride into her position he wants to place the sons of god we're living in adoption time this this is the hour of manifestations of the sons of god the prophet would say this in adoption number four paragraph 79 he says verily i say unto you you that's the little gods if you'll say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you've said go right back to genesis to the original what is it now the world in nature is groaning crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of god when true sons oh glory when true sons o glory to god i am glad to be gathered together in a house full of true sons and true daughters of god not playing church not wondering do we have the mind of chris not probing here and they're not living a victorious life not living and overcoming like wondering what he said over there and and getting to get together and making a club and say yeah i think that's a good way we all can kind of see it that way no no no when when true sons born sons field sons speak and their word is packed we're living in the hour of the placing of suns we're living in the hour of adoption time all of our friends don't shrink back this is the hour this is the time this is the season or many things i wanted to say to you back there but you weren't able to bear it but there's coming a time there's coming a season there's coming an hour the time of adoption the placing of signs i'm going to reveal my very mind you the very plan that i had before the foundation of the world i will put my words in your mouth and when you speak it's deity speaking and i'll back you up [Music] oh and we've seen one come to the maturity we've seen a first a sheaf wave coming to that maturity with the power of the spoken word speaking squirrels into existence speaking to the storm before the doctor's hand touches you i think the camps cancer the tumor won't even be there what was it that was a son of god in his position a first one to maturity showing that there's many more where is that many more true sons i'm looking at true sons true sons true daughters of god born sons field sons that speak their word and it's backed hallelujah we're living in the hour of the manifestation of the sons of god look the holy ghost is here the joshua is here god is here to take us into the land the very thing that god has promised he's here to perform it we didn't just receive a message and a prophet speaking all these things way off in the yonder and god manifesting these things in a prophet's life so we can just sit back and ooh and all and say my he sure was a prophet he are gods you your gods you are my offspring you're you're my very life i've put something inside of you a potential i've called it a seed of predestination but really it's me it's my own life and you you're the very expression of me and if that spiritual amnesia can just roll away and by the spirit of prophecy bring you the word my very mind to you and by faith you can receive it and get out of the way watch my word be manifested in you oh hallelujah so we can look at abraham's life and we see we see the type in the church ages and a type in the individual and then we can look at joshua we can look at caleb and we look at the the children of israel in the exodus out of the promised land which is a type of the holy ghost and going in and possessing the land and the placing of sons and now in adoption three uh paragraph 158 he says what's everything waiting on what's the whole creation waiting for romans 8 19 it says for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god what's everything waiting for what's the whole creation waiting for now we're not waiting for you to get in the car and get to church no we're not waiting for you to get in the car so we can go eat hurry up we're in the car waiting everybody's waiting on you come get in the car we're all waiting on you has anybody ever been to my spot what i really hate is when you're the first one ready and you're in the car and everybody else is taking so long you finally get out of the car and then they're honking at you said hey we're on the call come on everybody's waiting on the manifestation of the sons of god that includes you that includes you everything is waiting now for the manifestation of the sons of god it's waiting for the church to become into its position who it was the sons of god when adam where who was the son of god when adam where was his domain the earth he had a domain over the earth is that right he wasn't ella ella elohim then he was jehovah's see that is i am god and i've made some lesser ones under me and i have given them dominion and in their domain the the dominion under them is the earth man had dominion over the earth and all the whole creation is waiting for the sons of god to be manifested oh you realize that time when when god come down and told the prophet why don't you walk with me and there all of a sudden he was walking and he was changed and all of a sudden those deers came up to him and they started going up and saying adam is that you adam is that really you hitter was a son standing on the earth again that had full power and authority over nature he spoke to the storm and the storm obeyed don't you think nature was watching oh i can imagine the birds i can imagine those deer they looked out there they saw a son of god in manifestation standing upon the earth again adam is that you the whole world is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god and they've been gathered together in bedford texas and christian life tabernacle on a sunday night speak the word why christ speak oh glory to god hallelujah oh i feel pretty good i feel really good right now something good is about to happen something good is in star well i think we've been gathered together under the shout the bread of life oh the lord jesus shall descend out of heaven with a shout what is the shadow it's the message it's the bread of god gathering the elect together my predestinated that under the sound of that trumpet under the sound of that message angel that they would come into the manifestation of the very words that i spoke for them to be what an hour the placing of the sons and the daughters of god in the end time oh hallelujah do you love them so we see these types of the restaurant oh my goodness whoa who we have we have a lot of let's go we see these types of the restoration of the church we we see it in abraham we see it in the exodus uh i'll be going back to the promised land and i just want to maybe say this because uh maybe not in this service but my heart's desire if we approach this again by god's grace i wouldn't really want to break some of these things down and and because we hear we are restoration now we hear that word all the time and we have we have new ones among us and maybe some that are younger and sometimes we use these big words and people are wondering what are you even talking about restoration why maybe if i could say it like this if you had a family but they were healthy got a good job and everybody had their strength you had a good place to stay you're able to pay the bills and you were blessed but all of a sudden maybe a sickness hit and maybe the breadwinner of the home maybe maybe he fell ill and maybe something else happened and then and then all all of this you know the home all sudden you lose your home and then you lose your car and and then everything that you had it seems like it's gone my my strong healthy family now now my my parents are sick and and i'm am i 13 i i would i would go work if i can but i can't go work but see so your family or the church was in a condition where they were moving and in action they had been filled with the holy ghost the life that jesus lived the individual in the christian church was living also with signs and wonders following they were in their position now we're not we're talk we're not even talking first church age we're talking in that dispensation really before the church ages ushered in i'm talking about on the day of pentecost there come a sound like a mighty rushing wind and the great comforter come and they were endued with power on high and they went out with signs and wonders and and they were converting and all the church was a powerful church it was moving and it was action it was mark 16 in action but that anti-christ spirit come in and so god started dealing with the church it was twofold the church ages ushered in where god started to deal with the true vine and the false fine and this church that was strong and had its strength all of a sudden it started to get sick and it started to get weak and all of the power its ability to stand before men stand before denominations stand before that antichrist spirit oh he started to weave in his lies that that that antichrist spirit the white horse rider and all of a sudden the church got to a condition to where it had no more power but god promised all the years that the locust the caterpillar the canker the palmer worm i i'm going to restore that's restoration to bring the church back back to the condition it was in the beginning that that's that alpha church that alpha that alpha bride there's coming in the end time there's going to be one just like it an omega bride uh moving in the same power the same signs the same wonders so so we just we're looking at these types through abraham and and through joshua and caleb and the in the the wilderness journey going into the promised land these are all types that we can see what god was doing down to the church age and also how he was dealing with us as individuals you follow me another quote out of perfect faith i've just i love this quote here paragraph 39. i want you to get this now the church has got to lift itself in the power of god how we are too close to the end now and i believe the church is in a condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub out some of this make believe out see and get into something real is there somebody here that says i want to get into something real you ever heard that expression somebody come talking to you and say get real you know some of us hey has anybody ever checked your own self you're not in the world we used to you know we used to check people you know what that's about you you better you check yourself you walk into you you check them see what they're all about some of us need to go look in the mirror and say get real are you serious look it's not time to be pampered and babied well we don't we don't need a handout everybody doesn't get a trophy that's the society we're living in now but i'm sorry that's a deception everybody don't get a trophy for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son if your name wasn't written on the lamb's book of life you ain't getting a trophy and i just made a bunch of little leaguers mad but no we ought to get into something real the church we want to pull ourselves up into the power of god we're too close to the end now and i believe the church is in a condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub out some of this make-believe out and get into something real lord i want that is there somebody here that says you know what i don't care if i've accomplished a lot or i've accomplished a little lord that is me rub out to make belief lord oh i teach me the deeper things oh god i want to get into something real if i'm ever going to do something for you lord then i better get started there got to be a sincerity there got to be a desperation there got to be a cry in the heart and in the sons of god to come into that manifestation and the placing of sons and daughters in this hour that something is crying out for perfection it's got to be something that you know and if you say brother branham that isn't light yet i know it's like how do you know it's light i'm looking at it how do you know the message is the truth how do you know god sent a prophet how do you know malachi 4 5 has been manifested how do you know luke 17 30 has been fulfilled how do you know the mighty angel has descended with a shout with a little book in his hand and he's loosed the seven seals how do you know i'm looking at it oh glory to god is there a people that i'm preaching to that is looking at the manifestation they're looking at an open book the bible has become a new book it has been open it has told your name oh glory to god i'm getting excited i feel really good i'm looking at it brother orlando that's not a light that's not light no that wasn't a vindicated prophet what's funny is they look at you like you're crazy and you're like what do you mean i couldn't see anything on this tree in this room it was pitch black i couldn't see a thing but there's a man here who can turn on the light his name is jesus his name is jesus jesus christ is here how do you know i'm looking at them oh oh hallelujah glory to god i feel good i feel really good right now no my eyes don't declare it there's something that goes beyond my eyes beyond my flesh there's something a deep there's a deep calling to a deep and there was something there to respond and i'm looking at the manifestation of the word of god oh glory hallelujah praise his wonderful name oh praise his wonderful name well how do you know that you couldn't be wrong my sight has always declared to me that that was light see and that's the reason i believe those visions because it's always declared to me the truth because it comes from the word see then if he says it that settles it why does it settle it i'm looking at it when you have a revelation i wanna a prophetess oh i feel good and aaron and miriam got so lifted up they started to speak against moses and god come down and say let me give you a little lesson real quick i got gifts in the church i'll move upon this one and i'll give him a gift of prophecy i might move in this one over here and give him a word of wisdom i i've set gifts in the church and i have people with gifts of prophecies and prophets in the church part of the five-fold ministry but this man moses my servant he ain't that kind of man i speak lip dear to him a matter of fact when he's speaking i'm speaking when you have that revelation then tell me who is going to come and talk you out of the santa lord it's a revelation now heavens and earth will pass away but this revelation this anchor this light that i'm walking in this message of the hour that i'm walking i'm looking at it you can take this whole world oh but give me jesus give me the word give me the message of the hour when i get so stimulated and pumped up these people want to come and try to talk you out of it okay if you want to take something away from me what do you got to give me you want to talk me out of it the very thing that's given me my joy give me my wife give me my family give me my health give me joy give me salvation give me victory made me an overcomer and you want to take that away you can't take it away just like when david walked up to goliath he said i've been anointed for the job goliath you got the wrong man you asked for a man but you got the wrong one because this one's going to take your head off all this world is out there this satan's even just taunting and saying i'll put this social injustice i'll put that on give me a man why you got a woman this time it's miss jesus christ she is predestinated not to fall she ain't like that other eve this one can't fall take this revelation you can't take it from me i already went back and took it back i went to the enemy's camp and i took back what he stole from me i took back mom and dad where's your son at where's your daughter at i'm ready to get my shovel you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna turn into a sword grab your rake grab your pruning chairs i'm with you tell me what's their name i'll go with you sister i'll go with your brother why because we ain't leaving one behind this bride is victorious and the same way he dealt with abraham lot let's go boys that wasn't even his promised son that wasn't even his son or his daughter immediately abraham had so much faith i don't care if it's my uncle my aunt my niece or my cousin i know who i am why cry problem is we're crying and god's telling you to speak you want your family start talking somebody you want your son you want your daughter you want your grandma you want your grandson start talking start speaking the word whoa let's go to battle church this is the hour this is the time of the place in the sun the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god this is adoption time oh hallelujah are you ready to fight let's go all the way church i'm looking at it well how do you know you couldn't be wrong my side has always declared to me that it was light see and that's the reason i believe those visions because it's always declared to me to be the truth because it comes from the word see then if he says that that settles it now when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork well we can stop there a while there's no more guesswork somebody's here is guessing yeah you think you like the girl but you ain't sure yeah i don't know you know she's pretty but she turns out like her mom and dad you know a few years i don't know i mean you know she's she you know she looks like this but what should it look like later you know i model people got their little their their checklist i had somebody come well i got all these things i was like okay just go ahead and throw that checklist away because when the guesswork's taken out it don't matter anymore i thought she was going to be blonde haired i thought she was going to i thought she was going to look like my mom i thought she was i thought this and i i fought all that and then one day all of a sudden you get slapped upside the silly like oh my goodness i can't live without her just tear up no more there was no more guesswork and then we went through some trials you know just the season that where she was in that church you know i was just a wolf in sheep's clothing coming to distill away the daughter and i wasn't listening to their program and and so you know and so they thought oh you know what but guess what there was no guesswork between us we were in love i think that's the problem do are we all do are we impressed what i wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with his presence in our midst i wonder if we're in love with the message i wonder if we're in love with the lord jesus i wonder if we're we're looking at the revelation the seven seals those seven mysterious thunders that uh that have thundered out and i received the revelation what were those seals christ was those seals what was it revealing it was revealing christ oh my husband my redeemer there's no more guesswork no more guesswork it's going to be then you hear it's thus say the lord see because it's beyond human thinking it's up in the realms of the lord's thinking is that where you want to be all right let's try to race well the finish line is another day but let's run a little bit y'all want to run a little bit longer we got a few 6 10 right now take a few more moments so here in the first we read our text out of corinthians and this uh first corinthians two where we took our text but you know the book of corinthians is a book of a book of correction and paul was always having trouble keeping the corinthians straight he would write there and you know in the first chapter he'd say i beseech you first corinthians chapter 1 verse 10 he said i beseech you brother in the name of lord jesus christ that you all speak the same thing and there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment see the prophet of god said he couldn't teach the corinthians deep things he said they were just baby fashion one had a tongue one had interpretation one had a gift and one had a feeling one had a sensation but when it came to having a greater understanding of the word they were immature they were just babes in christ where he'd even write to him in in first corinthians chapter five he goes it's been reported to me uh that it's been reported commonly that there's uh that there's fornication among you see they were dealing with things and they were battling with things but but look don't don't get condemned the messenger of the age is writing to them but they were in a different stage than the prophet said look he couldn't write to the corinthians like he would write to the ephesians the ephesians they were they were grown and they were mature because the ephesians what is ephesians parallel ephesians parallels joshua ephesians a book of placings of sun it's a book of adoption that's what it perils so paul he couldn't write to the corinthians about that he'd write to the ephesians and say oh he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings you are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus you have been predestinated according to as he has chosen you before the foundation of the world that you would be holy and without blame before him and love the corinthians couldn't receive that they couldn't handle that they were just baby-fashioned but i believe the church now is in a condition where we can teach it a little deeper we can start to rub out some of this make belief and get into something real am i talking to somebody i say oh god forgive me for my for for my my my my faults and my failures the lord i realize what you're wanting to do you're wanting to take me into something deeper you're wanting to take me into something higher then i could rub out some of this make believe and get into something real in first corinthians chapter three verse one we'll try to just be about 10 more minutes i don't want to keep you too long we're laying in a lot and uh we can't finish any house so we'd rather leave you wanting more than saying when is this guy going to get done first corinthians chapter 3 verse 1 would read like this and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as under carnal even as unto babes in christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able now remember our text in john 16 12. i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now so there's a time and a season there's a growing there is a maturing i have not fed you with meat but i have fed you with milk well lord thank you for the milk if you need the the sincere milk of the word praise god it's there for you that you might grow thereby but you don't feed a baby steak there's any young expecting mothers or fathers here don't give your two-month-old steak matter of fact they recommend i think you shouldn't give them honey there there's there's certain things that a baby is not mature enough to digest so you have to you have to you have to you have to give it the sincere milk that it might grow there by but there comes a time and a season in the child's life when i say mama i'm ready for something more than milk and that's where the church is oh praise god for the sincere meal but we've come into a season now paul is telling the corinthians look i've given you milk but you can't handle the meat you weren't able to bury oh it wasn't the time it wasn't the season it was it wasn't the hour for it there has to come a time in the season look it's hot outside right now i don't really recommend planting right now i don't recommend laying sod you need to put i would probably put it down in the spring when the heat of the sun is less intense now sure i'm setting this up for a wonderful quote nobody can say it like the prophet but there was there's a time and there's a season just like in the church ages the the rising of the sun and has it as it went and went through the church ages look the the early church that they couldn't they couldn't receive the things that we've received in this age because it wasn't the time it wasn't the season but in a turn on the light in 64 paragraph 66 he says but the thing is today the church crane don't want to mature now i think we need to make that personal we need to grow up we get really comfortable being the vindicated overcoming believers who are going in a rapture who can't fail we're predestinated not to make it yes all that is true but let's quit wasting our time let's grow up and the things we're doing in our spare time and our private time let's quit ye like man let's grow up church let's get real let's get into something real i i pray we have time to get to this quote because there has been something so powerful opened up to the bride of jesus christ in this hour that if we could all get in one mind we could all get in one accord under the shed blood of god with the power of the holy ghost in action and moving amongst us watch out what could happen then but it wants to stay back in moody's time sankey finney knocks calvin they were all right they were the light of the hour but this is another hour this is another day this is the advancement of the gospel it's coming to its maturity now back to first corinthians reading uh chapter 3 verse 3 but for yet ye are carnal for whereas there is among you envyin and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men are you not just living by the spirit of a man that's within a man and you're just judging and living out and doing all these things according to what you think is best or is there another mind is there another life is there another power is there another spirit is there another appeal say oh god i don't want my thinking i don't want what matthew mcgeary thinks best matthew mcgeary don't know what's best and i've proved it a lot of times but oh i don't want my mind i want you are my lord i want to rub out all this this make believe rub out all this unbelief i want to get into something real so these corinthians they were immature but here these ephesians you could teach them something maybe we'll just we'll end along these lines because there's a little bit of reading but i i'll move quickly if they can put that on the board uh out of adoption number one paul writing to those ephesians about seated in heavenly places uh uh spiritual blessings the prophet of god would say the heavenly places now not just out anywhere but in heavenly places we are assembled in heavenly it means that the position of the believer so what is heavenly places that's your position as if not some like way off thing in the yonder that one day no that's right now we're living in the hour of the manifestation of the sons of god we're living in adoption time we're living in the hour of the placing of sons of god the position i believe that if i'm prayed up now we're going to move quickly because this you could just unpack this and and and preach a whole series on it but we'll move quickly towards a close maybe revisit it later that if i'm prayed up you're prayed up or the church has prayed up and we're ready for the message and we've assembled ourselves together as saints called out baptized with the holy ghost filled with god's blessings called elected set together in heavenly places now we're in the heavenlies in our soul our spirits has brought us into a heavenly atmosphere oh brother there you are a heavenly atmosphere oh what could happen tonight what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in a heavenly atmosphere and the holy spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in christ jesus all sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to god in our hearts lifted setting in heavenly places in christ jesus worshiping together in heavenly places did you ever set in one don't just pass by that have you ever said in one have you ever said in one and you knew it have you ever said in one and you experienced it it's here for you i i don't want to move past that just so quickly the prophet's not just asking that have you ever sat in one he's asking the question because he knows what he's talking about if you ever sat in one it'll change you forever do you ever said it one oh i've sat until i would weep for joy and say god never let me leave here oh it's a blessed thing just just heavenly places in christ jesus blessing us with what now blessing us with what divine healing foreknowledge revelation visions powers tongues interpretation wisdom knowledge all heavenly blessings and joy unspeakable and full full of glory every heart filled with the spirit walking together setting together in heaven places not one evil thought among us not one cigarette smoke not one short dress not one this that or the other not one evil thought nobody got anything against one another everybody's speaking in love and harmony everybody with one accord in one place then suddenly there comes from having a sound like a rushing mighty wind there you are has blessed us with also god i don't want this to just be a story i want it to be a reality rub out all the unbelief lord i want to come up into the power of god lord i want to i want to know the deeper things that we're in a place where you can teach the deeper things lord that we can see this in the manifestation in our local assembly oh god granted lord i receive it lord i believe it lord what are you facing tonight what is your mountain what is your trial what are you going through what is keeping you from coming up higher you feel like you've been pressed down you feel like you've been hurt you feel like you've been wounded you feel like you can't get into that sphere there's something that's keeping you down oh but god has made an unconditional covenant with you he's equipped you he's given you everything you have need of to live an overcoming life like that man his his son he was so vexed with the devil he was throwing himself under the fire he comes the oh god i don't know what to do sons come over him we've gone to the doctor we've gone to the church we've asked for prayer i've gone to this position oh god have mercy on me have compassion on us what did god say to him what did jesus say to him foul can't believe all things are possible i think it's okay to answer like that man did lord i believe but lord if there's any unbelief in my heart or there's a room i haven't welcomed into there's a surrenderer sacrifice lord if there's some unbelief lord forgive me the musicians would come forgive me lord forgive me for my unbelief but oh god i know that i believe peter do you love me yes lord i love you feed my sheep peter do you love me yes i love you feed my hands peter do you love me lord lord you know everything i can't fake it i can't make myself a believer i can't do enough good works i can't figure this thing out on my own it's not up to you what we need to do is we just need to surrender abraham the promise is to you and your seed after the same way i dealt with abraham i'm going to deal with you i've made an unconditional covenant with you i'm going to bring you through sanctification i'm going to bring you i'm going to bring you through justification into sanctification i'm going to pour my spirit out into your life i'm going to place you what does he want from you just a surrendered heart [Music] what's the evidence of the holy ghost in your life receive the word not puffed up who does he think he is oh i got it all figured out no no lord that's right forgive me forgive me for make believing forgive me for pretending help thou my unbelief lord paul said let's just go ahead and stand just try to end right there we're just in along along this line about make believe you know make believe is pretending i don't want to pretend i don't want to make belief without the life and without faith it's just ritual and tradition without faith it's impossible to please god and that's maybe by god's grace where i want to pick up next time is how you you could look at a abel and you could look at cain cain worshiped cain offered sacrifice but abel had revelation and then paul would start to write to those corinthians and say look look at those israelites they're an example they all came out of egypt they all were under the pillar of fire they all went through the red sea they all had a pillar of fire by day and by night and every single one of them died let them be an example to us i say oh god i want to come into that maturity i want to come into that power of overcoming life where i can receive the deep things of god is that what you want i don't know that song just come to me won't it be wonderful there having no burdens to bear how does that go [Music] i think that's right we can get some words for that are y'all thankful to be a christian are you thankful to be living in the hour joshua he was over there looking at jericho [Music] and there was one standing before are you for us are you against us i'm the captain of the host of the armies of god joshua went back over said let's go boys sanctify yourself [Music] tomorrow we're going over caleb oh i can't imagine caleb caleb said let's go joshua i'm more able now than i was then you know i was thinking about it about them spies that joshua and and caleb you know they went over to spy out the land and they came back packing the evidence that it was a good land you know the difference between those ten spies and joshua and caleb those ten spies were just carrying joshua and caleb's fruit didn't even belong to them yeah they've aged some of them oh some of them denominations and some of them are pentecostalism that were packing all the fruits of the spirit they liked them ten spies they weren't going to even be able to inherit the land but joshua and caleb come on it's time we're going over this is the hour this is the time of the manifestations of the sons of god let's sing this o when [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh won't it be wonderful hallelujah walking and talking [Music] won't [Music] hallelujah [Music] still [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] oh

sitting there and something said nothing could have stopped it [Music] yeah the devil threw everything he could at me he threw all the drugs he threw all the alcohol he tried to throw the money the faults the failure every single trap the devil threw it at me but little did he know god had a plan for my life a predestinated plan and in his mind he saw me standing here tonight so then way back there there wasn't nothing no sin no fault no failure no devil no dwi no demons there wasn't nothing that could stop the plan of god from coming into manifestation and i'll tell you saints of god there is nothing that can stop you you're going in a rapture at some glad morning when this life is over either by death or by the rapture i'm gonna fly away oh some glad morning oh when this life is
