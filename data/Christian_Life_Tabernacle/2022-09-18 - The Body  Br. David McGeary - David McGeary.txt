presence we've done all that we can do and now we depend upon him that the service may be done according to his will let's just commit it to him father we love you and we thank you for this another opportunity to be gathered together around your word lord to fellowship around the work that you've done in each of our hearts lord to use the opportunity to lift up your name and to worship you lord not just in song not just in worship but with our lives lord we pray that we just lord that your service would be done according to your will lord may your word have the preeminence lord may every spirit that would stand against your word be taken under the dominion of the word and rebuke from this place father we just want to welcome your presence you know every need you know already know the work that you want done and we pray that you would have it done according to your will in jesus name amen y'all can go ahead and be seated here to get a load off we're going to be turning to psalm 119 here in a second picking up in verse 161 and i was just reading that the other day and you know i noticed as you read psalm 119 you know nine times the writer speaks about having a love for the word you know he uses statements like oh how i love thy law it is my meditation all the day he says therefore i love thy commandments above gold yea then fine gold you know three of those times are here in just this little eight verse section of psalm 119 he says in verse 163 i hate and abhor lying but thy law do i love he says in verse 167 my soul hath kept thy testimonies and i love them exceedingly but he says this he makes an interesting statement in verse 165 and this verse just caught my attention it says great peace have they which love thy law and nothing nothing shall offend them nothing you know that's quite a statement he talks about both having great peace and having nothing offend you because you love his word you know we live in an age of great trouble you know there's just have to read down the headlines of any newspaper or news website i mean it's nothing but you know everything from political trouble to global trouble to financial trouble to you know moral trouble to family trouble to economic trouble it's just trouble on every side you know there are voices that are trying to tell us to be worried about one thing or to be concerned about the next or to plan for something else you know if we're not careful we can become affected by all the trouble and it can cause us to think or to act or to say something different than what the word would say you know the word may declare one thing but the trouble may try to drive us to do something else you know there's no promise that we as believers would be free from trouble you know in fact the this passage here begins in verse 161 it says princes have persecuted me without a cause princes spiritual wickedness in high places surrounding us with trouble for no reason other than who you are and where you live but you know it's interesting that we have an answer to the trouble and it's having a love for the word not a book not texts or quotes but a love for that part of himself that he has made known to you great peace have they which love thy law in first john 4 17 makes an interesting statement it says herein is our love made perfect complete that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love now notice he's not talking about his perfect love he's talking about yours ours you know fear is torment that is the opposite of great peace amen notice there is no fear no torment in love great peace have they that love thy law perfect love casteth out all fear the whole heart like we talked about last time a perfect heart complete and total love for the word nothing held back he that feareth is not made perfect love you know whether what what you're the status of your love is by the status of your peace the one is used to measure the other herein is i love is perfect love herein is our love made perfect how many can say that we're in a day of great trouble of judgment the question that i had as i read that do i have great peace do i have perfect love do i love the word with my whole heart you see the extent that i do the one is the extent to which i have the other proverbs 3 says my son forget not my law my word but let thine heart not thy mind but thy heart the center of thy desire center of your love keep my commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee you know the scriptures don't make any promise that will be a free of trouble but it does say that we can get to such a place where we love his word which is himself so completely so perfectly that while we may have trouble we will not be troubled but great peace it's not a mind thing it's not because we've got it all figured out but it's a heart thing it's because of where the center of our desire is you know paul after speaking about this treasure that we have in earthly vessels he said in second corinthians 4 8 we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair in colossians 3 he said but let the peace of god rule in your hearts not our minds but our hearts if we continue reading here in psalm 119 it says great peace have they which love thy law and nothing not one single thing shall offend them you know that word offend means to stumble to get out of step to get tripped up to change how you walk jesus made the statement in matthew 11 blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me you know sometimes we read that and we think about that he's speaking about getting offended by the word but he said blessed is he who is not offended in me not by me what that means is that we can be to such a place in him that we have no offense that nothing will offend thee blessed is he who is not offended in me having such a love for the word that nothing shall offend thee you know he spoke of our jesus spoke of our hour in matthew 24 and he describing all the troubles of the hour we live in and one of the things he said is this he said in verse 10 and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and i just read that thought if that isn't our hour i don't know what is but blessed is he who is not offended in me so there's a reason you know as i was reading this we can go ahead and stand you know there's a reason that at the very top of the stature of the perfect man is love you know i don't know about you but i want to get to such a place of love of that word that i can have great peace that nothing can offend me i know i'm not there right yet but i hope that that's your prayer this morning is to get to that place in him that nothing shall offend you that great peace have they which love thy law so as i was reading that you know the other day i thought i want to be one of those people that it's speaking of in the scripture don't you let's just read that section of psalm 119 this morning just 161-168 let's read that together princes have persecuted me without a cause but my heart standeth in awe of thy word i rejoice at thy word as one that findeth great spoil i hate and abhor lying but thy law do i love seven times a day do i praise thee because of thy righteous judgments great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them lord i have hoped for thy salvation and thy commandments my soul hath kept thy testimonies and i love them exceedingly i have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies for all my ways are before thee amen amen amen god bless you may have your seats this morning [Music] man let's try to sing that song in the feast of overcomers and i was just thinking about it this morning in my heart amen amen you believe there's a great gathering coming up together amen all the believers all the redeemer of the lord will gather together amen we are in heavenly celebration [Music] it's a glorious [Music] [Music] lasted [Music] the peace of the

we feel separated we feel disconnected [Music] we feel like failures and no way that we can even [Music] comprehend [Music] but you said that you loved us you said that you so loved us so much that you sent your only begotten son and because we couldn't earn it ourselves you purchased us you put us in the palm of your hand and you proclaim nothing will pluck them out of the palm of my hand and

you that today as we approach your word that you would break the word of life to us and that it would comfort us and help us grow we ask these things this morning in the blessed and precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen and amen god bless you do you love him this morning certainly we do amen we trust that the lord is your portion i'm getting a lot of rebound here can you you're working on it sometimes i think it's just me i'm kind of hollow up here so the sound kind of echoes back and forth let's turn in our bibles this morning [Music] if if we would and uh [Music] let's just read over here just one quick scripture uh for a scripture reading and and then we'll go return back to it let's read in just corrin and all the members of that one body being many are one body all so also is christ heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us your precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated we we certainly appreciate all of you uh walking down the street and up from the parking lots and we have a a little bit of parking open now on the dirt for a little while and and we appreciate you parking in the dirt and doing all the things that we have to suffer as we go through this time but you know the inward rewards are wonderful and the grace of god is so sufficient um and so we wanted uh fellowship a little bit this morning i don't know if it'll be like a bible teaching or not you know i'm certainly by no means an evangelist and i i don't have the energy anymore to run from one side i kind of uh envious of those guys that can you know just go and go but uh i i hope that by experience i've learned to work smarter and not harder and so maybe that's what i can bring to the table i i not deep or complicated life to me is always been i've just dealt with what's in front of me and it never mattered to me how it got there it is what it is and uh so that's what you have to confront uh there's not a lot of virtue in complaining i was reading in uh well i listened to yesterday uh the little sermon called uniting time and sign and in the beginning of that message the prophet of god is is talking about himself and in how that when he gets wore out and tore down he gets what he called the blues and he said you get to that place that you don't feel that anybody cares for you or you don't know whether you're on the right track or and it's just kind of a burden he says now you all have it he says but i just got a double dose of it he said but there's one thing he said i never he says complaining all it does is destroys faith that's all it does it just breaks down your faith and he said i i never he says and when you the older you get the harder those burdens are to bear and he says and he says i want to bear my burden he says i don't want to be crowned with a crabby old spirit he says that's the worst thing that i can think of in life is coming at the end of your road and having a crabby complaining spirit he says i want my life to be crowned with peace and joy patience long-suffering and love he said that's the crown of life that i would like to have and i think those are the important things that uh that we strive for and i thought you know that's a that was a great thought and i thought it was a good advice to have while you're young don't complain because it's just going to ruin your faith and you're going to turn out to be an old crab anybody want to end up being an old crab i've met a few crabby people you know i have a crabby person one time look at me and say you're the devil you know and in my heart i i might have thought well you're an old crab right but i don't want to be crowned like that i want to sit back and say that's the human factor that's human i don't have to i don't have to go there i don't have to defend myself he'll defend that amen my job is to create an atmosphere of love of peace my job is to to radiate what he's done for me my job is to express that i have confidence that i'm in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck me out my job is to say that no matter what this life brings i have a mansion waiting for me i'm not staying here i'm going and that's why we firmly believe that this is a a leaving message it's not a staying message i'd like to just read just a couple statements this morning because i think it's important that our emphasis is is you know is is uh is the rapture our emphasis isn't on the revival our emphasis is on the rapture it doesn't good the revivals come and go but the rapture is a sure thing and that's what we want to make sure that we're making and we want to have a greater understanding of what our qualifications are to be a part of that rapture that's what we understand and we realize that what our message was it was a message that came to call a people out to separate a people because there was fixing to be an exodus and so we we know we study our messenger came to us and he laid out to us the three exoduses how the the three times of the church that the church made great moves and that they left one dispensation can move into another dispensation and how every time that the church moved from one dispensation to another from the from the law to grace in the type of coming out of egypt that there was a a messenger that god came and veiled himself in flesh to be a sign to the people that there is a there's a transition taking fixing to take place and don't miss it and and so we understand in moses as exodus uh there were so many types that was a natural physical exodus from a one land to a promised land from a land of bondage to a land of promise from a land of slavery and bricks and to a land flowing with milk and honey and there was a god came and veiled himself in the flesh of moses and did signs and wonders to prove to them to get ready can we understand the getting ready for that rapture or that exodus to them it was a rapture the rapture from slavery to freedom from from working for someone else's land for working in their own land that great exodus but there was still the getting ready was the application of the blood of the token they had to put that on the door in order to be there to make that and and if the blood had to be applied and we understand in our day the token has got to be applied the word of god has got to be applied we understand the second exodus was from law and the bondage of sin into a spirit-filled life by the grace of god and the purchase price of calvary and once again god came and veiled himself in flesh and paid a price for us that we could pass through from the wages of sin which was death to the gift of god which was eternal life and and what a what a beautiful thing that it is to be free he can still tempt us he can still draw us away after after the flesh but but he's not going to rule and reign in the lives of the born again he is not going to do it because that that soul and that life has been purchased by the lamb of god it's been purchased by the blood of god and so we understand that we saw that he came down in an in a body and a sacrifice and that was an exodus from law to grace to the baptism of the holy spirit to the union of god and man together as one now there's there's come another sign that god veiled himself again in flesh in our day in the ministry of the son of man the rein re-impersonation of the ministry of jesus christ that was to the jews that same ministry was re-impersonated in our day because the same god that dwelt in him veiled himself in a prophetic ministry a prophesied ministry behold i will send you elijah the prophet as it was in the days of the voice of the seventh angel as it was in the days of sodom and gomorrah so shall it be in the revelation of the son of man we saw those promises and then we saw that promised ministry and those spoken scriptures we saw those very promises that were written in the word of god we saw them manifest in flesh there they were in human form in a body and the body was doing the same science the same works preaching the same gospel trying to restore back to us the same faith that we would recognize that there's fixing to be an exodus and that our faith would uh move in us so much by revelation that it would bring us to the place of preparation another that we've we've seen the word manifested we've seen it come to pass exactly what was said the church world didn't they they're still looking back at the the second exodus they didn't recognize yes that when the foolish virgins go after the oil that's when he comes he he comes he comes to unite himself he comes to become one with those that that hear his voice and and are called out he he comes and he he manifests himself and here he comes in our generation doing the same things turning us back to the audience just like sarah in the tent talking to the woman at the well just like jesus talked to the women to the well catching the spirit everything about the ministry was identical to the exodus from law into grace every bit of it was identical to every exodus before because if he ever does one thing one way he's got to continue to do it the same way and we know that god works in threes we will not get into biblical numerology this morning but what what the the understanding that we're wanting to place on is that our revival is the rapture i mean that's that's what it's all about and that's a place that we have to be led to we've got to be prepared for we've got to be transformed to that condition this is something that i always keep in my heart that the rapture isn't an event it's a condition you're in rapturing condition it's rapturing faith you're in expectation you're in anticipation you're looking for it you believe that it's real you're not wait and see when i see it i'll believe it no you it it's the evidence of something that you're hoping for you know the rapture's coming i know i'm going to be a part of it i know i'm going to be changed i can see the world condition i can see the sodom condition i i can see the the the lack of the love of word you know the brothers came back from israel and you know what the okay the the israeli people are realizing that they're going to have to change their commerce because they no longer can rely on christian tourists because christianity is declining in the world a man was speaking the other day and there this is a political season and and he he made the comment he says well that candidate that's for them christians it's not the majority anymore the first time in our country's history less people go to church more people stay home now than go to church christianity is in a decline it's no longer the consciousness of the country or the nation and so this whole country saying we can't rely on them there's not enough christians anymore people aren't coming to the promised land they're not coming to to to see where jesus was well we don't want to look to where he was we want to look to where he is we don't ever want it to let us slip that this calling out is about a rapture it's not about a restoration of a revival it's not a about making and manufacturing signs and wonders signs and wonders follow the believer in other words the the spirit and the power that causes miracles is indwelling in the believer and we're going to go that direction but just listen to this statement as as he he says he says just uh just a little couple little comments about his rapture because what we're going to talk about this morning really has to do with the rapture now what did he say in revelations 10 that would take place why was the trip to tucson to open to the church in the days of the messenger of the seventh angel the seventh angel message the whole word of god would be made manifest the seals that what all the stocks has left off of why and all about it would be made manifested in this time is that what the word says then we see it then where are we at see where are we at there is only one thing its harvest is here she's dead right she's ready for the coming amen dead right so in other words i i surely don't want to be sitting back and not ripening up right how do you get right by being sitting in the son you've got to sit in the presence of the s-o-n in order to get right you you want to be ripe i know some people get right by putting it in a bag and stick it in the refrigerator i just know how i want to get ripe i want to be sun-ripened what are they called the best fruit is what vine ripened i want to be vine ripened i want to be ripened because i'm attached to the vine and the life that's in the vine is in the branches and and that we have the same fruit i like this little statement he says he says no matter whether we are ready or not i thought wouldn't that make a good sermon title ready or not how many ever heard that as a kid ready or not here i come well you know what the world's in a game of hide-and-seek they're all hiding from them and we're seeking them right but ready or not this is what he's got he says no matter whether we're ready or not the lord jesus will come just the same at the appointed time we must be ready we must do it now it's no time to wait we must redeem the time and be ready amen amen so this certainly talked about redeeming the time and and where we are and another part of being prepared for the rapture and and i hope that's on your heart church i i know there's a lot of directions we can go and and the world's going to lots of directions the church rules going to lots of directions but but i i honestly feel in my heart i think the most important thing that a believer can do is prepare for the rapture you know what it really means to redeem the time to make yourself ready now we want to talk a little bit today about the church now when we say church there's a lot of meanings for church and and we have a lot of ways and the word church is used in so many contexts in in so different many different ways we talked about the church and and so when we say the church many times we refer to it as the building that's a church or the church is on the corner of such and such place afghan we refer to this as as the church we're building a church well you know but that's the building but we still use the terminology church for the building the building is the church the church building uh that down over there there's a methodist church there's a a a baptist and we're referring to the building and then there's the church and that's referred to as the group of people you know we might refer to the church as the group of people the members of a certain church we might call it is the the baptist church referring to a group of members to a a group of people that believe the same thing and we might call that a a church and so an identification as a group of people so that's another way that we refer to a church you know so we refer to a church as a building refer to it as a group of people or a group of members the members of the church is is the church and we call that a church but we're interested in another church and that's the church of the called out amen now that's a church i could say it like that that's a church within the church amen so we know there's the church building and in the church building there's a group of members the church and in that group of members there's another group another church that's a elected called out a group of people that have been born again so that that church that's within the church we call that church the bride that that church is an elected uh people and and so we we read that that that group or that elected uh people is is a body so we want to refer to that church that's the church that we want to contact this morning but i believe is it this morning that all of your hearts are here because you have received a revelation that god has sent a prophet messenger now some of you may be here because of your mommy and your daddy and this is where you grew up this is where your friends are and there's nothing wrong with that let me tell you that's better than than being at the bar because mommy and daddy are at the bar so we're we're we're grateful uh for those of you that come up with your parents because you want to have harmony at home but we still would like to encourage you and let you know that you can have an individual affair and relationship that faith comes by the hearing of the word of god and that our desire would be to to to preach to you and to make the gospel simple enough that that if you would incline your ear that you would hear and recognize something and that your eyes would receive eyes out and that you would see what it is that your mom and dad believe what it is that brother david's preaching to why these people come from all kinds of different walks of life all kinds of languages and and different life's experiences and different classes and have gathered themselves together why that they have a picture of the pillar of fire hanging in their church and a picture of a cloud and and this pyramid over here on the wall the statue of a perfect man what is it that's driving them and causing them to be that way and our desire would be that that would become real to you and even the very spirit that that is causing you to be here this morning that that spirit would grow in you as the scripture says that your the knowledge of your revelation might increase that you might know what the unsearchable riches of the kingdom of gods are so we all want to grow this morning we want to increase in the knowledge we want to increase in the understanding we've got we understand it's getting dark right but we know there shall be light in the evening time that god is going to provide for us a way to see by he's going to provide a voice to lead us and guide us it can in our desire no matter where that you are in your life's experience no matter where you are in your child uh in your in your growing whether you're a child adult a young adult whatever that the word of god can find a place in your heart and give you perspective to what the truth really is and you can have that we we we care about it and we try to preach the gospel in a way that it can be understood and we don't have to maybe to go so fast but uh so we we know that uh that this church the church of the firstborn the church of the elect the church of the called out is a church whose names were written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and that's what the gospel's for the gospel is to preach the word and the word goes out and finds those because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god so blessed are the feet of those that bring the good news in fact all of us are commissioned to go into the world and spread the gospel because you've got to sow in order to read and one planet one watereth but it's god that gives the increase so never doubt who you're around can never doubt the situation that god's put you in never doubt who that you've come in contact with nobody can take your place you can reach a spot that nobody else can reach and and it should be a burning desire on our heart to find all those that god wants to share himself with and he uses you that's why he's commissioned you you say i'm not commissioned yeah you are don't look at a program you know you don't have to be hudson taylor or john livingston you know you you don't you don't have to be then be yourself be yourself your your life's journey takes you past a lot of people who need the word of god amen you don't have to sell them the whole bushel basket all you have to do is let them know god's a healer god's a forgiver it'll ignite something in them it'll create a thirst the word of god says be salty it'll create a thirst in them and pretty soon they're going to inquire of you why do you have this hope everything's falling apart and everything's gone up in price and and and uh everything's just getting more expensive and and i don't even want to send my kids to school anymore and everything's terrible and everything why are you smiling aw hallelujah i'm leaving amen he promised me before it got too bad he'd take me out of here that's my hope my hope is if if if something would hit me sickness death whatever that i have a body waiting share that share how your candle get lit share what your hope is share what he's done for you share the victory of the blood of jesus christ in your life share your deliverance share your joy share your peace now if you don't have that to share i want to share with you that there's a fountain that there's a place that you can get that joy you can get that peace you can get that comfort that you can have that confidence that somebody's taking care of you and he's gonna work it out now let's follow this because i this morning and just taking this little uh understanding what that work want to talk about just for a few moments is and i i forgot i i got these statements but then i forgot to write down what message i took them out of so i'll read them my best and and sometimes the brothers can search them out and if they find it they could put it there but this is in paragraph 16 from a message now i trust that you are listening to so many tapes that you're get that you're going to be able to say i know where that's at and as i said last evening god has allotted that his scripture from the beginning before there was any time when he was eternal he is the eternal one and then these things that happening now are only the attributes of god's thinking now that's things both good and bad in other words god's omnipotent he's not present he's all-knowing he knew that satan right would distort the word he knew he was a liar amen he knew what would transpire did you guys find that that quick took me hours to find it so he knew it so remember even the darkness that's here god knew the darkness was here because he had planned the law of contrast amen he wanted you to stand out he wanted you to be different he wanted you to reflect something different well you think well i'm different i don't want to be different i don't want to wear a dress i don't want to have long hair i don't want to not go to these sporting events i don't want to not do this i don't want to be different well he made you different and you'll never be happy until you accept your difference i mean i got a big nose i learned to accept that a long time ago i am not going to go spend 60 000 to change something that's not going to help me anyway you either like me or don't like me my nose isn't the reason for that i'm the reason for that oh it's my atmosphere it's my first impression it's my attitude it's my nature it's what i correct what i create you'll kill yourself trying to change something that's continually changing you spend all the time you want in the gym your hair's still gonna fall out you know what i mean i don't care you can fast all you want you're still going to go from a size 29 to a thigh 36. just wait a while you know you can build all your muscles up here you want but eventually they end up down here so we might as well get on the right page right we might as well get rid of the carnality might as well get rid of what the world thinks you are different you're oddballs you were created oddballs you were created to be different okay you are just the manifestation of god's thinking amen you're what he thought when he looked up there he didn't see marilyn monroe or barbie doll he saw you however you are whether you like it or not that's what he saw that's the way that's why you're the way you are because that's the way he wanted you to be and he thinks it's beautiful why satan say you're not beautiful all they see is these advertisements these things body shamed body shamed i'm not ashamed of the body i'm going to get it's eternal it never dies shame this old piece of junk all you want it's going to rot anyway let's get focused so it's just everything is just an attribute of his thinking in other words satan is only a perverter he's not a creator everything that's here even the time is because god thought it it is only is is thinking at first it has to be a thought and then a word and a word when a thought's expressed it's a word so if i i was to ask my my my brother here and i would say what are you thinking right now well no don't you don't you don't have to you don't have to answer that i'm just i'm here stand up i'm just using you as an example all right i don't want to know what he's thinking now god knows what he's thinking okay but the only way i can know what he's thinking is for him to what speak it now i know what he's thinking so you're thinking you wish i'd have never called you you're thinking that you're embarrassed but you're such a good-looking young man i want you to put you up here so all the people in the world can see and to end everything okay but you would never know what he was thinking until he what spoke it thank you you did a beautiful job there's a large portion of the kingdom waiting for him so you understand that it's got to be spoken so he had all these thoughts until they were expressed you wouldn't know what it was thinking well there was nobody to hear so when god expressed it he said let there be and then those thoughts took on form right so let's just follow this through so we can make uh just understand where we're trying to go this morning in our sunday school for our body here i'm not preaching to the world i know there's people that catch up and they they watch but this is for my ministry is for our local body i know a lot of people think they have a worldwide ministry but outside the local body of ministry to me the body to the world message to the world is the message william branham sent he said his thing at first it had to be a thought and then a word and a word when a thought is expressed it's a word and then it's spoken so when the i used the brethren so whatever thought he had he had to put that thought into words before he could speak it so where does the word have to be it has to be in your mind now it might have been taught to you from a baby you know what i mean i might walk up to something and i say well that looks like corn mush and you'd say no fufu saza boy fufu are you seeing all the people's eyes perked up it's like i made them hungry that's the word you've got that's been put in your mind to identify that it's not the same thing to me because i have a different word but isn't it funny that different word different expression the manifestation is the same he said express it's a word then it's spoken it has to happen and the whole thing is god's unfolding himself in his attributes and then god being made material tangible that we can talk to speak with in his whole church body and everything now that's the church body i'm talking about the one that he's made himself tangible in the one that he's speaking to and having fellowship with make sure you're part of that body if you haven't spoke to him in a long time start the conversation cry out of the father he's at the door knocking open it up let him in he said i'll come in and sup with you have fellowship with you don't stay on the outside when you have a god that that loves you wants to be with you wants to help you grow wants to help you overcome wants to provide for you wants to take care of you you're just depriving yourself of a wonderful fellowship he said it says attributes and then god therefore your name was in his thinking that's how you have eternal life you can't have it no other way if you got eternal life you always was see if you otherwise you just can't say well i belong to church i do this no sir eternal life never had a beginning or any anything that was eternal never did begin it cannot end so you were only in his thinking your name who you are and what you are that's the only way you could ever have eternal life because you always was now tell me that ain't a hard thing to change accept it and start figuring out why god made you the way he made you why he put you where he put you aren't you glad he didn't make you like me i'm not going to say the same thing back but you are what you are because god made you that way praise god for that let's grow he said he says and those no matter what they are they are eternally he said you always was and those no matter what they are they are eternally dead they were dead from the beginning the bible said the woman that lives in pleasure is dead well she's alive right she's always been dead she's dead in sin and trespasses and now if you were in the quickening at his beginning that's what he come to redeem and your name was put on the lamb's book of life in his thinking that at the beginning and he come to redeem all names that's in the book no more not one more just what was in there when the last name is redeemed he takes his book and claims what he has redeemed now a lot of people ask why hadn't the rapture happen why isn't it that should i still have children who knows but when the last one that he had in his thinking in the beginning is redeemed that's when it's over [Music] i don't know when it is i don't know who it is but remember this i could maybe like just say it'll say this this morning it helped me when all these questions about uh the dates and years and times and having children and time being no more and him coming off the mercy seat he can come off the mercy seat but it didn't change what was in his mind in the beginning that may be your little grandbaby maybe your great-grandbaby but what was there will be here and if it's part of that when that last one's redeemed it'll be there you cannot take a human calendar and a human understanding and try to interpret god's program it's going to happen just the same should i get married get married plant your potatoes should i have children have children what happens if their names not on the lamb's book of life what happens if their name is on the land there's another judgment seat where a lot of people will make it because they've been good to the bride but this is rapture we're talking about so we don't know we go forward we live right we do right okay he says now what a strange thing it would be if we couldn't believe all that's written in the scriptures for the whole thing is god's word and all inspired in every bit of it and we believe every bit of it look you know this is a lot of place where a lot of times the misunderstanding of what the holy spirit is now the word of god is god's thinking is that correct so that that's what the the word of god is we understand that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god we understand that those thoughts that god had was made flesh so we could look at those thoughts in the flesh that we could handle touch and feel them now he's not here in that body anymore but he's still here but we understand what the what is what does the holy spirit do the scripture says the holy spirit came not to speak of itself but to bring you into remembrance of all the things that i taught now when you really come down to the essence because the holy spirit is not a third person it is not another person the holy spirit is the word but you understand the holy spirit is his spirit i hope i can just say this just right and the holy spirit puts the mind of the word in you what god had in his mind was expressed in his word so when you become the word your thoughts are the same thoughts that produce the word so what does the holy spirit do it changes your thinking it changes your mind and there you don't have your mind and the word when the spirit comes he puts the mind that was in christ in you isn't that what philippians 2 uh 5-11 says let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus thinking it not robbery to be with god so generic what is the the word of god is preached it's the thoughts of god so he's trying to express them thoughts and manifest them thoughts but how can he manifest the thoughts in your flesh if they don't come manifested in your mind first so god's trying to change the way the church thinks he wants you to know you were with him in the beginning he wants you to think that way in questions and answers this question comes into brother branham i don't know if he read it beforehand or not but this i believe is his brother or this sister had a dream he said barbara i had this dream a year ago and it's reoccurring i'm all tore up he says i was out in like a desert i and i you can go read it i'm going to do my best with it he's like i was out in the desert and i was in white sand and i was lost terribly lost and he said my wife was there or my my son was there and or my husband was there and we were all lost terribly lost and brother graham says sister he says everything's good he said the white sand meant that you weren't lost that you have the holy ghost he says that's just the devil making you feel that way he says and it's making you all upset and nervous and when you get upset and nervous you make your husband or your wife upset and nervous and then you make your children upset and nervous and then the whole family becomes upset and nervous it just passes down and it passes down he said don't you let satan do that to you you quit thinking that way you get that thought out of your mind you're saved you're elected you're redeemed the white sand prove it let it go well i hope that that person just thought praise god if the prophet of god said i was filled with the holy ghost and redeemed betty that would be life to me look out i just hope i'd have the character to keep that humble amen but it was it was inner thinking and here's the word of the hour the first thing it does it's got to change your thinking so you've got to remember the word which we believe this message is the word has come to change our thinking it come to change a carnal mind to a spiritual mind a carnal mind is what enmity with god it can't understand spiritual things but the spiritual mind is life because spiritual things are comprehended by a spiritual mind the only thing that can change the mind is the word the only thing that can change the mind of the church and i know that people when people say well it's the holy spirit but the holy spirit came to give you the mind of the word it came to give you word thinking it didn't come to have a revival around its presence because the rain falls on the just and the unjust but it don't change them they shout and live the same they praise god they sing specials they carry on and they live the same they love the blessings they love the hallelujah but they're not preparing for the rapture but let me tell you the only thing that's going to change your thinking is what god sent in this age to change the thinking and that's the word how can you eliminate the word from people's lives and expect to have them be changed into rapturing condition by a spirit that falls on the just and the unjust it would have to bring the unjust two but that's not what does the transformation it's not the anointing of the spirit it's the transforming power of the spirit to put make our minds become word minds then how can you keep running yourself down when the word says your name's on the lamb's book of life don't make sense why would we strive for an anointing that can go away but when you think a certain way when you've been transformed into a new creature with a new heart and a new mind and a new outlook and new perceptions that doesn't go away why because even when in the storm no matter where i am you are who you are we know you're still the same your word don't fail whatever you said will happen that's what's in your mind because that's what the holy spirit does it's not a come and go anointing sure he blesses you falls on the just and the unjust sure it's an anointing but we live for a change we're living for a change we want to be changed what are we living for we're living for the rapture we're living for a change we're living in how are we going to be changed with the carnal mind the holy spirit and that's why the messenger came everything every time i listen to his word every time i read what he says i realize what he's trying to do he's trying to change the way i think he thought different in everybody he didn't keep it to himself he shared it with us so that's what the holy spirit is doing he's trying to put the thinking that made you the word so if if you're the word then if the words of thought are from expressed the thinking has to go along with the word is that simple enough i hope i i don't know how i'm communicating but i'm doing my best to let you understand i don't want us built in feelings or emotions revival's fine you want to shout that's fine you want to run around the church that's fine i'm not against that hallelujah praise god i'm not against it but if it's not changing the very way that you think then all you are is spiritually wet peter and them guys they're in a prison they just go rejoicing praise god wow they had the mind of god they thought the way god thought who was it was sharing this the other day about john being boiled in oil couldn't boil it out of him he had it in his mind if you figure the anointing that was on him and boiling oil no it was his mind he had the same mind that god did why because he had the same word and you're not going to get the old only the voice of the word will change the mind if you want the church to change and have the mind of christ play the voice to the church play the voice hear the voice it's ordained to quicken the words in you the spirit quickens the word in your mind and makes it happen and makes it alive so we understand that the spirit is is the holy spirit is what puts the mind of christ in you is that you am i is that kind of made clear you understand exactly what that it does it actually it that's what quickens so the affair is individual you understand that in other words it's not done to a group god doesn't convert groups he converts individuals the conversion is individual each of you have to have your own conversion you didn't go someplace with somebody now you most you might have individually came to the altar but there's nobody saved in a group god don't save groups he don't save churches the methodists aren't saved because they're methodists the catholics aren't saved because they're catholics we're not saved because we're in the message god doesn't save he groups he deals with individuals the conversion is individual you understand that it's an individual affair the mind the the change that the word creates in you it it is it is individual those things are are individual the birth is individual every single one of you was very even twins are birthed individually [Music] so all that part of it's individual but after you have the individual birth and you're born into an experience and you've been converted and now god is through that process of of being born again and rejuvenated and made afresh and new and and laying down your thinking and accepting his word as your thinking in other words his word becomes your final outcome satan may try to get you to reason but when it comes down to it you're you're the word you think the way he thinks that's your final outcome but you're born into a body and this is where i just want to finish now for a few minutes because he is coming to rapture a body god came in the form of a body and when god's going to rapture he's rapturing a body i don't know where that body is i trust me we have many members of that body here and that's the way i think i believe every single one of you is a believer every single one of you is going i trust that every single one of you and if satan keeps badgering you're not tell him what the word said he was he's a liar he's the father of lies there's no truth in them amen but we come and so this is the thinking that i'm trying to express in the word of god because too many times we start living only for ourselves we live in selfsville we only take selfies our our whole idea even in the church is if i'm going to go in the rapture i'm going to go on the rapture but did you ever stop to understand that you're part of a body that's going in the rapture that you've been born into a body that your life is not a life unto yourself for you to make it to heaven your life that he gave you he made you an individual but and he tailored that individual birth just to you that you would be a part of a body and that you would be fitted in to that body i'd like to read this statement if i could i think it's a beautiful statement he says now i want you to remember that the very thing that we are trying to contend for that is jesus is not dead but is alive oh if we could just get that into our minds huh he's not dead he's not gone away he's going to do everything he said he would do 10 10 4 that is jesus is not dead he but he's alive and he's just the same today as he was when he walked in galilee only he's not in a corporal body but in his church body working through each member as he has ordained them to do do you believe that so that's where he is he's in a body and he's ordained it and made it that each body and member of that body and each member was ordained to do what he ordained him to do because he's ordained that piece of the body to work with another piece of the body because that body has got to come together because he's rapturing a body in hebrews he says sacrifice is an offering i have not but a body thou hath prepared for me he was trying to tell the church well if he came in a body and now we know his spirit has come in a body the mystical body of christ he's not here anymore in a carnal body is he but he's here in a mystical body he's preaching the gospel but he's using body members he's praying for the sick he's using body members he's making intercession he's using body members he's feeding the poor he's using body members he's coming for a body turn to ephesians i believe it's five i think i had it wrote down here maybe not but we can find it no let me see i've got it here i'll just plan it i thought it was ephesians six uh it's on one of my papers here i'm not good with papers anybody that knows ephesians 4 16. this is what he says here in ephesians 4 16. now now listen because now we're talking about the rapture we're talking about preparing ourselves for a rapture and being in rapture and condition you're not in rapturing condition until you're positionally placed in the body doing what you're ordained to do being blessed and anointed and singing and shouting and rejoicing and dancing does not put you in rapturing condition amen i'm not saying that it's bad to do that but don't ever take it as an evidence you're just against any emotion no i'm not i'm a very emotional person don't get me mad one person told me one time he said i've learned one thing about you and i said well what's that brother he don't you ever say anything bad about your deacons because that upsets me because they're all volunteers now if they're getting paid have at them part of the job but when you go off on a cashier it's not her job she probably couldn't even afford the thing you're buying you know she's just there she's going to leave the hamburger stand she's going to leave the restaurant she's going to go home soak her feet she's going to wash all the food smell out of her clothes i'm going to wash her hair and everything she's going to try to put all the human factor behind her so she's going to get some rest don't let's don't lose our objective and our purpose let's read this that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men there's be steadfast know what you're preparing for know where you're going know why you're doing what you're doing remember revival is not our goal the rapture is our goal we're not trying to create a revival here in bedford we're not trying to say we got this one coming from here and this one coming from here and and man we got it going on and and we got the best singers let's make the rapture let's make the rapture let's live rapture let's think rapture we're at rapturing time it's harvest time every sign for the coming of the lord is at hand let's be ready don't miss it don't just accept the rain if it's not changing that your mind becomes the same thought that was in the word cunningham craftness whereby lie in wait to deceive but speak the truth in love may grow up into him in all things that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitteth and joined together and compact by that which every joint supply it according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love that is a mouthful that's beautiful he said how will they know you are my disciples by your loved one for another by every member the body is compacted you know what when you compact something it it it it becomes firm it becomes strong the body's made strong by every member supplying to the other member that which god had given them as being members in particular so you've got to understand what he's coming to rapture he's looking at this body now i'm not talking about this body but this natural body here should be an example of the spiritual body you can't separate yourself from the body you can't just come to church come through the doors sit down fulfill your church obligation get up and go out like you have no responsibility or obligation to anybody else here no you might have something for somebody you're saying get you so beat down don't let him do that your very word of kindness your very handshake your very act of love but listen he said let's just read it again he says but speak the truth in love may grow up into him in all things even things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitteth and joined together so how can you be in rapturing condition if you're not going to allow god to fit you and join you to the body you can't sit back say oh i'm going to make this on my own no you're not because you ain't going without me so if you don't want me hanging onto your ankle pick me up how are you gonna how are you gonna say i'm in rapturing condition when you're totally unaware that he is now in his body he's in the body which is the church how can you say i'm ready for the rapture when you're totally unaware of that body the existence of that body the needs of that body now remember i said there's a church building we're not talking about that i'm not preaching about building fund there's the church membership i'm not talking about that i'm talking about a mind a called out people that have the mind of christ that look upon the needs of every man as their own he said fifth and join together and compact by that which every joint supply of you how are you in rapturing condition if your joint isn't supplying spiritually prayer intercession thinking burdens everything what's happened is we get this whole idea about the individual part yes you've got to have the individual part but after you've had that individual experience you're placed in a body to fulfill that need of that body that compressed about there according to the effectual working in the measure of every part the effectual working of the measure of every part now we're wanting to get ready for the rapture right that's the whole thing you've got to know you have a measure you've got to know you have a part you've got to know there's something you supply that's the maturity of the statue of a perfect man that's the maturity of being speaking the truth and love and becoming in all things like can hearing is the love of god made perfect as he is so are we in this world he says every part making increase of the body if i'm in rapturing condition i'm making increase to the body and there's my thinking has not just become about survival i'm trying to survive i'm trying to make it i'm trying to fight the world you know i got all these troubles and all these battles and and oh god you know i've got to make it wait a minute let me shake myself i was in him in the beginning i've got eternal life i was there i'm going to put the thinking of god in my mind i'm going to put the word in what he said about now i'm going to be about what he made me to do let's apply to my other members my other parts of the body i'm going to help them make the rapture i'm going to help them make the rapture you're not going without me well i'm not going without you i'm here for you i'm praying for you i'm with you it's not just me it's us we're in this together he said he would rather have us love one another than love him what kind of love is that so what i'm saying is when this church starts to get to rapture and condition there's a uniting that takes place in the love of god in her heart it's 12 14 so we'll we'll close i'll let you go read this other part at home the effects will work in every part supplying together in love and then of course we read that first part in corinthians of first corinthians in 12 and we won't we won't go into that any farther this morning because it's late but the whole thing talks about every part of the body and let me just read down then we'll skip all the things about every member being necessary how many knows corinthians 12. first part is about gifts the second part is about how there's a body that gets worked in and that it's a body and it can now and that there's a many member but one body one body many members but one body and and he says and then the 25th verse he says there should be no schisms in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and and this morning we'll we'll just and i wanted to go through corinthians and and go through those scriptures but uh time uh would escape us but i'd like just to close with uh with this reading this morning and again i i don't remember where it's found but he makes this statement he says now christ is the head of this christ is the head of this masonic kingdom and you can not organize a kingdom of which christ is a head you cannot denominate a kingdom which christ is the head because christ is king and you cannot take the intellectuals of man and make an organization to which christ will govern what does christ govern he governs his body the kingdom of god is going contrary to is going contrary to the king and if they're going contrary to the king it would be against the king so if it's against the king it would be an antichrist that's pretty rough if i had just a little more voice i'd make that clear it is an antichrist and if you bear with me a few minutes i'll prove that an antichrist spirit tries to take the people and call them from an organization to an organization organizing them together which never was the will of god people has always fussed at me because i struck so hard at organizations it isn't the people in there that i'm striking at it's that denominating spirit that makes people think that we are the people that's that second church we talked about god's people is called out people i believe they're in every denomination that could be catholic that could be protestant that could be jewish that could be any kind of church but the real church is the mystical body of jesus christ now you cannot organize the mystical body of christ now every person that comes to christ comes out of the world comes into christ comes into this mystical body and you are a member of that body when you are brought into this church called out and are baptized into the mystical body you get it not methodist not baptist not pentecostal not nazarene not pilgrim holiness not catholics but the body of jesus christ we'll pick that up a little deeper in other questions in a few minutes as we go into the deeper parts of it but the body of christ is the church now he likened it in many parables like husband and wife he calls the church the bride and the bride is no longer the bro the bride is no longer and the bridegroom is no longer two people they are one she is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and then when a man in a woman is called to the mystical body of christ by the holy spirit they become a full member of his body when they're filled with the holy ghost because god took the spirit of christ raised up his body and placed it upon the throne and sent back the holy spirit to make up the mystical body of christ which will be united at the marriage supper at the coming of the lord you can't organize it it is mysterious jesus said to nicodemus the wind bloweth where it listeth and can it thou cannot tell which way it cometh or where it goeth so is everyone that's born of the spirit you can't understand it it comes from somewhere it isn't methodist it isn't baptist it isn't pentecostal it is an organization it's a birth born into the kingdom of god now try to organize it and bring it to antichrist because anything that's against the teachings of christ is antichrist amen i hope that this morning through my my inability to really express it the the the way that i i'm trying to do it on my heart i i just wanted to look just for a quick because i wanted to make sure that that i've covered everything that i kind of wanted and but when it when it comes down to it this body if you're a part of the body you know it and and when you realize you're not living for yourself you're living for that body you say i don't know who it is i i don't know who is the body or who isn't but the mind that's in me has got to be the same mind that god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son well when man was yet sinners he died for us when we can live for and know we're a part of something that is just not me that's going i've got a responsibility a care make it and do my part and and do my supply and the prophet of god said this in the token he says oh take this solemnly we should love one another oh my is paragraph 243 in the token we should we should love one another oh my we should be so in love don't never speak evil against one another if somebody makes a mistake pray for him right quick we are together in this with god we are brothers and sisters oh we live godly live live like daughters of god live like sons of god live sweet kind humble let no evil come into your mind in your thinking just dismiss it if it knocks on the door take it away just say just show your token and keep walking i am under the blood this morning i wanted to share this because we're talking about a rapture and we're talking about being a rapturing condition and we're talking about the rapture is faith and it's a revelation and when we understand that i'm not the only one he's coming for he's coming for a body and i want to give myself to that body as christ gave himself for me and as he pours his spirit the church and as he brings this body together in unity and peace that every member is now helping every other member make that rapture he's taking a body he came in a body go read the five identifications of the church listen to it as he explains the mystical body well understand he is dwelling in a body he's coming for a body you're a part of that body i pray this morning that you'll take some sense of consciousness that you belong to something that you're a part of something and you have something to supply to that body and you'll take up your body responsibility because i want to go i want to go with you i want you to be there i hope you want me to be there we'll do it together if we live one for another we live for him we live by his word and we live one for another there's a rapture it's at hand let's make it let's do it
