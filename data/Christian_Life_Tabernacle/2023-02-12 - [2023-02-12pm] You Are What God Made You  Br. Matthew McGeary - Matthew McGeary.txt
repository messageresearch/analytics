Description:
You Are What God Made You
Br. Matthew McGeary
February 12, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

the things of the world and We've ran to and fro and we found out the world has nothing to offer us but in you Lord is everything that we have ever needed and right now we know that we stand in the seat where all things are possible because we believe Lord not because something that we have done but because you placed a predestinated seed of God that can believe all things and here we are tonight Lord just to surrender our vessel unto you that you could come in a supernatural way according to Divine promise and take the bread of life and break it to your people Lord may you anoint the ears of the hearer tonight that you would just come by each one's way Lord and speak the words that they have need of Lord we love you we thank you Lord we just commit ourselves to you we ask these things in your most precious name the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have your Bibles let's just turn in Romans chapter 8. amen we thank God for a second service in the evening time you know in the evening times is when things happen it's in the evening time from the rising of the sun till the going down of the same amen aren't you aren't we glad that the sun has risen in the evening time it might sound like a paradox but the same Sun that Rose in the East is the same Sun that Rose in the west and we are a partaker of his divine nature aren't you glad for that amen we'll just read his word Romans 8 verse 1 a little lengthy reading of 11 verses but I just want to say this that it stands on its own it stands on its own it doesn't need no man to interpret uh but I just want to take our time and just reading it because oh if we could catch the Revelation that's packed in these 11 verses right here oh my we could close the book we could say hallelujah we could shout a glory amen and we could Feast on that Eternal Word right there let's just read there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you the people sitting under this building tonight but you put your name in it but you are not in the flesh well thanks be to God but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness what were we hearing this morning talking about the new man the old man's dead and the old man it just produces deadness it produces separation from God but if you're in the new man there's life he says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he hath raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen you may have your seats amen I just would also like to just read out of Luke chapter 4 just reading a few scriptures and we'll we'll launch out to see how God would lead uh in this service something maybe that would um bless your heart by his grace but we'll just read in Luke chapter 4 verse 17. through 21 it would read like this and they delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written so what was written it was a prophecy God had uttered his word through the mouth of a prophet and the word that was spoken it was written down and now Christ Jesus Christ is now taking uh the prophecy that was written and he finds the place in Isaiah he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and we know that he stopped right there because the rest of it was pertaining to a second coming but he was taking the word of God and now he was he was taken the prophecy and saying hey this day this scripture is fulfilled the prophet has spoken it but now I am taking the spoken word and I'm declaring to you in this service that what was spoken by the Prophet this day this scripture is fulfilled I would like to just read a quote out of what is the attraction on the mountain and this would be the source of my inspiration as the prophet of God would say in paragraph 67 he would say what was the attraction later in Pilot's Hall I believe he's referring to to Pharaoh he says he says when the Sheep holder throw down a stick and it turned into a serpent God fulfilling his promise to Moses now I like to put myself into the Bible I like to put myself into the scripture so whenever you see a character or you see a patriarch of old or what God was doing to Moses what he was doing to Abraham what he was doing through Elijah I like to put myself in there because you realize it was Jesus Christ and Moses it was Jesus Christ and Elijah and if it was Christ in Moses then you were also there because you're a part of that word you're a part of that logos anything that Christ did the bride did with him oh I'm so glad about it you are in him you're part of that word your name is attached to it come on Church God fulfilling his promise to Moses what was the attraction at the Dead Sea when Pharaoh's horses were all astonished when they seen a wind come down from heavens and part the Red Sea from left and a poor bunch of slaves walking in the duty of God there it is what were they doing they were walking in the duty of God what is your reasonable service that we'd be a Living Sacrifice that would be walking in the duty of God that we be laying our life down they were walking in the duty of God walk across that on dry land what was it God keeping his word the deadness moved away a living people went across and a spiritually dead people tried to impersonate it and Drowned God fulfilling prophecy and making history I just want to read that again God keeping his word the deadness moved away a living people win a Christ and a spiritually dead people tried to impersonate it and drowned it God fulfilling prophecy and making history oh I I wish I could just uh play it as many times as me and brother Gary listen to it I don't know 10 20 30 times but I'm telling you I just rolled it over and over God let it sink in I let it reveal to me I want to catch it because oh one sentence from the prophet I'm telling you you can't even exhaust it oh I I want to try to stay focused and and and move forward here but I it's a Living Word it's spiritual food and due season you can take one quote you can take one sentence and you say oh God reveal it to me open it up peel back the layers I want to know more more of your person they're keeping God's word the deadness moved away oh I I'm telling that's what God's done that's what he did to each individual God was keeping his word and the deadness moved away a living people went across don't you know a living people he's made a way for a living people to go across a spiritually dead people tries to impersonate a religious people make believers they try to impersonate it but they die what is it it's God fulfilling prophecy in making history now the prophet of God when he would preach what is the attraction on the mount he he would he would really want to drive home this point he would say it over and over he would say God fulfilling prophecy God keep in his word what is the attraction on the mountain it's God fulfilling prophecy it's God keeping his word he'd say this in paragraph 46 he'd say God then what was he doing what is the attraction up there on the hill it's god making history and God fulfilling prophecy and that always causes an attraction it brings all the critics up the vultures of the morning's message and the Eagles he preached uh anointed ones in the end time that morning I believe and the Eagles also see they come together to find out what's going on some coming for curiosity some coming to find fault others coming to criticize nothing's changed Church nothing's changed there's all kinds gathered as we said this morning believers make Believers and unbelievers what's on the mountain prophecy is being fulfilled what's going on up there it's prophecy being fulfilled a word that God has spoken is now coming into manifestation something that was spoken by the mouthpiece of God is now uh being fulfilled what is the attraction up there on the hill what is the attraction what's going on what what's going on there in Bedford Texas what's going on in Christian Life Tabernacle what's going on in your home what's going on in your life what are all these things that you're going through these trials and this sickness and this battle that you're going through and you feel like God has left you alone now I want to say what is the attraction I want to say it's God fulfilling prophecy it's God's word being fulfilled and when I preached to you a little tonight if God would help me God fulfilling prophecy and making history and as a subject you are what God Made You see the prophet would say um in a sermon he preached in 53 I perceived that thou art a prophet but when the gift of Prophecy is operating cannot be received unless two or three judges see whether it's right or not but a prophet singular p-r-o-p-h-e-t is barned a prophet comes up a prophet everything he says in the name of the Lord is absolutely truth if he's prophesying I like to distinguish there if he's prophesying when Malachi 4 5 when Revelations 10 7 was prophesied speaking it was none other than God himself taking the vessel using his vocal cords and his mouthpiece and speaking words he demonstrated that this microphone is a mute if I lay it down it says nothing but God would take uh the vocal cords he would take the mouth and when he would speak it was prophesying it was thus saith the Lord nothing could stop that word from from coming to pass I just want to just to labor a little bit on that when God speaks through his Prophet it's thus saith the Lord and then when that word that has been spoken comes to pass its history God's word being fulfilled and making history now many times we think about making history and maybe we think of man's achievements and what man has done and you know we could start to think of man uh making history and maybe things that have taken place in in the modern era you know where where the Wright brothers and I believe it's up to debate who who really flew the first plane or whoever made it up there but you know it was an accomplishment it was something that it was an achievement of man they were making history and and I believe a a Ford Henry Ford or he created the assembly line and made the the mass distribution of automobiles and he was making history he he took down the production of an automobile I think it took like 12 or 20 hours to make an automobile and he got it all the way down to an hour and oh that was a great achievement of man it goes into the record books and all of these things and sports and and everything you have it's all of these great achievements and and all of these milestones in it and it's man not making history it's it's it's something they deem that's important it's something that that is remembered it's something that is famous and it's remembered through history where you say oh you remember you remember back then when when they first started to make air condition and my we could actually live in a home where where there was a thermostat and and we could actually change the temperature oh the automobile and all of these things some of the old-timers can think back but yeah I remember I had no air condition I had none of those things and most of us not all of us but some of us remember what life was like without a cell phone oh Hallelujah you had to be a man of your word if you told somebody I'll be there at four o'clock you were there at four o'clock if you were going to meet somebody there you had directions you knew how to get there you had to map it out but now we're just like dumb driven cattle turn right turn left go here do there and you get there and if your phone dies you don't even know where to go I'm lost I don't know where I'm going like where are you trying to go I'm trying to go home you don't even know how to get home no I've just this thing just tells me everything it tells me to make a right tells me to make I think that's what the word of God should be doing I think that's what the message of the hour should be doing I think that's what the new man should be doing if you put off the former man the old man and you put on the new man it'll tell you turn right turn left go forward stop put on the brakes don't go any further I want to be a sheep that's led by the spirit I want to come in unity with Christ the headship with a Capstone where I don't speak unless he tells me to speak I want to say what the messenger said I want to stay in my place if I'm the final voice to this generation then I gotta be under the headship of the message of the hour I have to hear the great Eagle prophet and what he has spoken if I can take that word into my heart and catch a revelation of it then I am the final voice and the pride has thus said the Lord or she what I I think that's a problem I'm trying not to be Evangelistic uh tonight but I think that's a pro a lot of our problems some of us don't know how to keep still we run our mouths we run our legs and we're just busy bodies running here to and fro the prophet of God said we got to wait on our ministry some of us get so puffed up and we get so so zealed up and now we're just gonna run here and run there we need to wait upon the Lord the scripture says that they that wait upon the Lord hallelujah they shall renew their strength they shall rise up with wings as he goes they shall walk and shall not faint oh if you want to be led by the spirit of God why don't you wait just wait you've been praying for an answer you've been praying to make a decision and you're on the cusp of making a decision uh just because you're feeling the pressure wait upon the Lord be still and know that I am God oh well it seems like a great achievement but what has it done the cell phone I remember uh coming up man the first thing that came was a pager and you were a big time if you had a pager you're either a doctor or a drug dealer I don't know where you grew up I'm just saying you know if they had scrubs on and a pager doctor if they looked like that and had a pager right maybe because man you were big time like why do people need to get a hold of you uh Paige you're going off page you're going off you know I remember when I started my business it said page me you know because pager started to become a thing and then it became a cell phone and and all of this revolution uh technology that has made life so efficient has it I think we had more time before technology showed up because now we're busy getting so many things done well my I can get one million things done in a Day verse 10. and we leave half of it undone so now we got a million five to do the next day well we're we're on a we're on that direction but it's it's man's achievement it goes down in history the cell phone and then and then they put somebody on the moon and and all of these things it's man's achievements of that goes down into history and and and it it becomes a great date something that's celebrated something that's uh uh remembered and they had to have some type of thought they had to have some type of imagination and and some ability to start uh being inspired and they would put down the blueprint and they would write it all down and they would start to think well how can I accomplish this great goal and this great achievement that I have in my mind what would be the steps and through great trial and error and trying this and trying that they come up with some plan and and eventually they finally are successful in the and all of a sudden everybody recognize oh wow fantastic you landed on a big piece of dirt thousands of miles away when you probably could have Built Homes for all the homeless and you could have fed everybody but it was some great Monumental achievement but we see that in man because man is always trying to achieve something and for the sake of time we can start to talk about what God was wanting to achieve when when he said let there be light and everything that God was wanting to to achieve we we could labor on this point but we're Faithfully taught we know that God was wanting to have Fellowship uh God's an object of worship and he had all of these attributes and all of these things that he wanted to display if I could just get just a touch more on the monitor all of these things he he wanted to display so so he would he he was working to achieve something and just to maybe uh anchor down the point the prophet of God would say this in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he say the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible that sounds pretty important this is a big statement and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's Great goal is what is this great goal what is this great achievement and now Hallelujah in the last days he has revealed it and shows it oh that excites my soul to be a part of this one great goal this one great plan that God has always had it's been sealed down Through the Ages Every believer that every went before they were all in types testifying to this day Hallelujah testify to this day that God had a purpose that he would Express himself in Jesus Christ that he would have the preeminence in a bride in the last age and he would take her home to Eden again that was his great goal that was his great achievement that's what God was wanting to do and as we move forward God would speak to Abraham in Genesis 12 verse 1. maybe we can just find a a a a a pace here if you want to follow me in the scriptures Genesis 12 1. if we get lengthy I thought we were going to be short and anytime a preacher thinks he's going to be short he's going to be lengthy so if you gotta if you gotta go eat this is not mandatory total voluntary the deacons are not uh uh um what do you call those people obey they're not bailiffs or jailers like you can't get out you're free to go let's just walk through the scripture a little bit we'll try to Pace ourselves I I find there's times where I move quickly and if I slow down and cover the same material we'll see what happens Genesis 12 1 would say now the Lord has said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country from thy kindred and from my father's house unto a land that I will show thee and I will make thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing so verse 2 says and I will make thee remember our subject here is you are what God Made You okay so so God is saying and I will make thee a great nation and I will bless thee now I just want to get a little ahead of myself because God Jesus Christ himself God and more faith came again according to Divine promise in this generation and spoke a creative word the spoken word is the original seed that took on flesh and our generation and spoke a creative word and said I will have a bride he said he would do it he spoke the word just as he told Abraham and I will not you will Abraham this is not something that you are going to do Abraham but this is something that I am going to do actually I'm just mirroring I'm just showing a mirror or a type or a shadow in your life Abraham of my great achievement that I want to achieve in the end time that I want to have a bride and I'm going to speak my word it's going to be a prophetic word it's going to be a prophecy that is going to be fulfilled and when that prophecy is spoken and it's fulfilled then it's history and I will make thee a great nation and I will bless thee God said I will now we look at the scripture says and Abraham staggered not at the promises of God well if I wanted to be an intellectual I would want to say doesn't look that way to me looks like he kind of staggered I mean Lord I'm just saying I mean did he not like you know take Hagar and try to give his wife away twice I mean didn't he stagger a little bit but see God was not looking at what Abraham could do Abraham's inability was not a part of the equation why did Abraham stagger an audit the promise of God because there was something in Abraham that wouldn't stagger Hallelujah no matter of the false no matter the failures now how many times he tried to give up there was something inside of Abraham That Couldn't stagger it was a very Jean seed of God something that was in there that identified with the message and said I will make thee a great nation I Will Bless thee see there was something in Abraham that could not stop until it got to the achievement it wasn't what Abraham was doing it was what God was doing in Abraham so we look at the beginning Abraham oh we don't want to get on that trail story of Abraham would be a long time get you out separate yourself he didn't even know where he was going but it was by faith he knew he was going somewhere well where was he going God said hey start going where am I going don't worry about it I'm taking you somewhere when you hear the message of the hour you really don't even know where it's taken you you just know you want to go wherever it's going hey I'm still there I'm saying wherever this message takes me I want to go it brings up the critics it brings up the vultures it brings up the unbelievers they're all finding fault I'm just getting on board I'm on this ship to Zion wherever this message takes me I want to go because outside of this message there ain't no guarantee there ain't no safety it's just judgment it's wrecked lives there's no Solutions but oh if you get into Christ if you get into the Capstone if you get into the message of the hour that's where it's at foreign but Abraham how many trials how many faults how many failures and then just in simple Simplicity of nature impossible for him and Sarah to have a child but what happened out there on the plains of memory God confirming his Covenant God appearing unto Abraham the scripture would say this in Genesis 18 14. what's happening God said I will and if God says I will there's a time we come and say God did Hallelujah God said he had save you God said he would heal you God said he would deliver you there comes a time where you recognize he said he will and then you can stand up and say he did Hallelujah and there on the plains of memory God appeared uh Melchizedek he said where is thy why Sarah because now everything that I've promised you Abraham I'm here to tell you I'm going to perform that which I had spoken unto you lord it's been so hard it's been a rough road these three or four years I've been barely able to keep it together I don't ever see how the promise is going to come into manifestation but here God was appearing God in more faith in Melchizedek to declare unto Abraham and Sarah I'm going to perform that which I had spoken and Genesis 18 14 says is there anything too hard for God is there anything too hard for the Lord is there anything too hard for the Lord well take that need right now take that bird and take that heartache take that pain take that infirmity in your flesh go ahead attach the word to it we come here to do battle tonight we're doing spiritual warfare is there anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son prophecy the spoken word and now jump over to Genesis 21 verse 2. for Sarah conceived God prophesied God promised God said he will and he did for Sarah can conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him at the set time not at your timing not at Abraham's timing not when everything is going good not when you have the ability not when you're up on the Mountaintop not when it seems like it's the perfect time not when it seems like you got it all figured out but at the set time at the time that God said he would do it you see he he already spoke his word he already knew exactly the time and the hour of when he would bring that promise to life at a set time what was it God fulfilling his word and making history that which what he had promised that which he said he would do prophecy being fulfilled and Sarah conceived god making history Isaiah 55 and 11. I love to hear this Pages Russell right so get them Bibles out put that sword to work Isaiah 55 and 11. so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish Glory that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sent it so shall the word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it's not going to turn void it's not going to not accomplish what he said he would do when he told Abraham I Will Bless Thee I will make thee a father of Nations I'm going to bless your seed that word could not return void it was thus saith the Lord but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sent it I want to say this when God speaks he has an intended target it's not guesswork it's not some broad wide way it's straight it's narrow it's precise it's exact it hits the mark it's not two inches to the left it's not a a billionth of a centimeter to the right it's exactly on the target it's exactly on the time at the set time the set Place God spoke the word it's going to hit the mark because the word is accurate the word of God is quick it's alive that's what that means right when you're quickened what does it mean to be quick and made life the word of God is quick it's alive that's why it can be a discerner of the thoughts and intents of your heart it's not a an algorithm it's not a a some type of of throwing something out there oh somebody here you're not back pain I know I'm right somebody here you've had a hard day somebody here it was hard for you to get to church tonight well yeah that's a really broad way and I think while we're getting a little sidestepping here but oh God is so faithful that some fake chicken can stand up on the platform and impersonate the word of God but if somebody out there believes it's a God and but God will honor his word that's why people come out of Benny hinns and all these peoples [Music] you know out of these these Pentecostal uproars and they're coming out and there's healings and there's Deliverance why that doesn't vindicate the organization that doesn't vindicate the man that vindicates my God the god of Mercy my God's a god of compassion my God's A Healer my God honors his word even if it's spoken out of the mouth of a hypocrite God will honor his word to the believer because it hits its mark it has an intended target it's sharper than any two-edged sword it pierces even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit now we're talking about the Triune being your flesh your spirit your soul and the joints and marrowsing is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart when we look into Genesis 3 15. I want to hear pages ruffling when you look into Genesis 3 15. in this scripture oh my God oh Hallelujah what a word if you knew how much was packed into that scripture Glory Glory when God spoke that word Hallelujah he said an eye we'll put imagey between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his Hill I just want to say that that word that prophecy was a heat-seeking missile you know they got in all of their defense and all their Technologies and now the mightiest Nations in the world are having balloon fights hey I shot down a balloon today well I mean haven't we all it's a that prophecy oh it was so alive it was so real it was so precise down to the hour down to the moment down to the time down down to everything we was going to hit the mark when he said I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and ourseling it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise its Hill it it was going to hit the mark his word won't return void it's going to accomplish the thing that he said it would accomplish look all heaven was behind it all of God was behind it it was thus saith the Lord the prophet of God would say this and Satan's Eden paragraph 89. he said every seed will bring forth of its kind if you are a seed of God an attribute a son of God then the word of God is sown in you who did it God did it God told Abraham I will I will every seed must bring forth of its kind if you are a seed of God an attribute a Son of God then the word of God is sown in you the word did not come from an outside influence it was something that was already in there and it was a deep calling to a deep and there had to be a deep there had to be a word if I could say it like this this had to know where it came from I came from somewhere I belonged to something there has been something sewed in me and it will not stop it cannot rest it cannot return void it has to come back into contact with the thing that sowed the word if you are a seed of God an attribute a Son of God then the word of God is sown in you see and then when you hear the word of God my sheep hear my voice a stranger they won't follow you get it every seed comes forth after its own kind every seed you are a seed both naturally and spiritually you are a seed of the word now if we look into the Bible into Isaiah 7 verse 14. okay once again remember what a prophet is Isaiah was born a prophet this isn't guesswork this is this is God speaking with an intended target an attended place an attended time therefore verse 14 it says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign I the Lord I am going to give you a sign okay Isaiah what is that sign going to be what is it that you are going to do what is this great sign that you're going to give us Behold a virgin shall conceive to think something that was supposed to be a sign was one of the most intimate personal things that could take place not a public show this isn't something that's done out in the open but the sign that he was going to give he says Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel God With Us the prophet spoke the word the word went forth and that word caught and the womb of a virgin now if you go study that a little bit when he says that word caught in the womb of a virgin God's patterns do not change where did that word First Catch in the womb of her mind that's what the prophet taught amen oh the word so deep and so rich just as Eve right to be deceived where did that word first conceive in our mind and once the word was conceived in the womb of her spirit which is the mind then the natural act came so a virgin shall conceive she first cut that word in the womb of her mind and then brought forth the manifestation of what was spoken the prophet spoke the word went forth the word caught in the womb of a virgin and I just want to say that Mary was the intended target Mary was the intended target Hallelujah when God said a version shall conceive it wasn't guesswork it wasn't I I wonder who it will be it's not like the Oklahoma Gold Rush first come first serve I wonder who will figure out the riddle we're not in an escape room trying to figure out all the clues so we can be the first one to the promise no the promise had a name on it Glory the promise had a name attached to it when he said a virgin shall conceive he knew the name he knew the place he knew the time he knew the age he knew the hour he knew everything about everything about the individual whereas that prophecy was going to take place because it had an intended target the prophecy had a name on it you know it's like getting a gift you're on Christmas time everybody gets gifts well to eliminate chaos it's good to put names on them and then everybody knows what's theirs you don't have to wonder whose this is because there's a name on it little did Mary know that her name was attached to a prophecy think of it what a prophecy what a promise what a word that the Vindicated prophet of Isaiah said a virgin I'm going to give the generation I'm going to give the world I'm going to give mankind uh from beginning to end I'm going to give you a sign a version shall conceive little did Mary know that she was a part of that prophetic word and 800 years later what the word caught in the womb of aversion what was it God fulfilling prophecy god making history right what he promised now has been manifested you with me and this excites me we're working towards something because this all pertains to something that God has done in you this all pertains to something that God has spoken in this hour concerning you and I want to say that your name is attached to it you are the intended target prophet of God said in the spoken word is the Original Seed he said no matter how much anybody criticized how many things somebody else said that didn't have one thing to do with it she believed God's word regardless there was something to Mary that staggered not at the word that was spoken because she identified with it she said be it unto me according to Thy word because it was something that she was a part of it sounded like home when she heard all her mother which she would read those scriptures of the prophets prophecies to her and say oh God is going to give us a sign a virgin shall conceive his name Shall be Called Emmanuel I imagine something in Mary just bubbled up like oh wouldn't that be something how is it going to come to pass who is going to be that blessed one but something inside her believed that word because she was attached to it no matter how much anybody criticized how many things somebody else said that didn't have one thing to do with it she believed God's word regardless regardless of what regardless of everything regardless of everything regardless of the critic regardless of her family Mary had a tough road the very man she was espoused to be married to she had to stand before her parents and her husband Joseph and testify and say the thing that has conceived in me is that which the prophet prophesied a virgin shall conceive behold I give you a sign and I am that sign I am a part of the prophecy she could stand there and say this day this scripture is fulfilled you imagine she could be stoned excommunicated divorced marked sent away but something inside of Mary could not deny she could not deny what she was a part of it was her identification it was who she was you are a seed you are a word seed you are Abraham's seed you are what the word says you are well that's a little bit of what our subject is right you are what God Made You now the prophet of God would say this and spoken word is the Original Seed you might as well put your seatbelt on I don't plan on finishing anytime soon I'm just going to deliver the burden so the spoken word is the Original Seed and like I said you're welcome to go we are predestinated why I love the word we are predestinated why Christ is the Original Seed and this Original Seed was predestinated by foreknowledge of God knowing that the fall would come and predestinated him to take our place you get it All Sons and Daughters of God are predestinated but you say then will he condemn some no sir ha how you like that devil will he condemn son no sir All The Heavens back in that you are a son and daughter of God will God condemn you no sir I think oh God put this on my heart sister you've been living under condemnation too long the reason you feel condemned is because you've been delivered and you keep falling to the same battle over and over and over and Satan is trying to put condemnation on your life and you feel that every time you fall and come back to the same thing that you were delivered from you feel unworthy you feel like the promise isn't for you and you're right back in the same situation that God delivered you from and you're starting to feel unworthy you're starting to feel like the promise isn't for you you feel like you're just going through the cycle you're scared to go up for prayer anymore you're scared to go to special meetings because you feel like the need is going to be called out and you're going to feel some need to go through a prayer line you're going to feel some need to go through an altar and God deals with those things in that way but I want to tell you that this is the day of salvation right there in your Pew right there in your seat by the preaching of the Lord this is the day of salvation this is the hour of your deliverance you don't have to live under condemnation no more why because cause you are a daughter of God will God condemn any daughter of his no sir take the devil God's children are not condemned Glory so where is that condemnation coming from it is not coming from your heavenly father it's coming from the old man it's coming from those Gates of the old flesh and you got to die to that thing take that old devil's head off tonight say I'm tired of living after the old man I am going to put on the new man and I will be delivered it's for you it's your promise it's who you are it's what God Made You Hallelujah Romans 8 1. Hallelujah there is their flower we're just going to walk this road there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus when did you get into Christ when you were born again you were always in Christ you're just an attribute that was placed that God wanted to express in the evening time and you are trapped into it you came in a fallen condition under spiritual Amnesia under the old man not knowing who you are but don't you realize the new man is the real you the new man is really Who You Are but the flesh the old man wants to lay claim to your soul Oh Glory to God but it can't have it it's sealed off it's predestinated God looked at the Devil said you can't have her Glory you can't take your hands off of her she's nine that's my bride that's my son that's my daughter I said I would have a bride and she's the intended target Glory there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit if you need to take your bathroom break take it I'm in page three and I got four or five more there is therefore now no condemnation hey if you knew the Avalanche the devil tried to throw unto me before I got to the Church of the Living God I'm ready to fight a little bit this is what it's about there ain't nothing in the flesh that can hold you there I know infirmities there ain't no work there ain't no job situation there ain't no sickness there ain't nothing that can separate you from the love of God God placed you here his word will not return void he put you here for a reason in the season to bring forth what he spoke Hallelujah you are that spoken word where I can look at your life and say prophecy being fulfilled god making history where in you with you Hallelujah Romans 4 8. keep walking can God condemn his son or his daughter will he then condemn son some no sir Paul said it there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit Romans 4 8. blessed is the man blessed is the man glory to God there's a blessed man there's a blessed son there's a blessed daughter tonight blessed Romans 4. blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin blessed is the man you know I was just thinking about it it came to me there came a time in the scripture where David you know David was a man after God's Own Heart but David had his own faults and his own failures and I was thinking about the man blessed is the man well one day David did some things he let lust uh be conceived in his mind and he acted on that lust and he he brought an adulterous relationship unto his kingdom unto his house in Bathsheba and then he killed a man to cover up his tracks trying to cover up what he did and so what did Samuel the man of God came unto him and said look oh and Nathan Nathan came to him said David I want to tell you a story but there was a rich man Oh my he had he had ten thousands of sheep ah they were the best sheep in all the land but but here here was this whole this this poor man and all he had was one sheep and the rich man took that poor man's only sheep and he dressed it and he served it to his guest and he took the only thing that that man had of value and David in his righteous judgment looked at the prophet like the prophet needed to inquire of David that might have been the first lesson say whatever you say prophet but Nathan said what should come of the man he shall surely die and Nathan looked right back at David and said David you are that man you're that man David I want to say we're all like David we are all guilty we are all worthy of death we were all born in sin but then the great Apostle Paul in Ephesians 2 4 would say it like this see David was that man you are that man well we were talking about blessed is the man well we're taking the negative David was that man and Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 I'm giving him time Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 says but God who is rich in Mercy Hallelujah but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where and he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath Quicken us together with Christ by grace are you saved David you're the man you're the guilty one but Paul would say in Romans 5. verse 20. he would say moreover Romans 5 verse 20 you would say more over the law entered that the offense might abound see David was guilty because there was a law David was guilty and because there was law the scripture says uh the the the the the the strength of sin is the life there was no law then there would be no strength there would be nothing behind it there would be no enforcement because there would be no law there would be no penalty but because the law came because there was a law that the offense might abound we all were born in sin but we're sin abounded Grace did much more abound blessed be the man you are that man you were that man that was guilty you were that man that was born in sin you were that man that was worthy of death but Grace did abound that you might be the man whom God will not impute sin why you're the predestinated Son and Daughter of God God cannot condemn you why because he said he wouldn't this is Victory Church hey we're soaring in the heavenlies we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you are a predestinated son and daughter of God God will not condemn you yeah the devil wants to give you judgment just like those Sadducees and Pharisees you remember when they caught that woman in adultery what did they do they caught that woman that was an adultery and they said let's go see what the Rabbi says about it let's go see what this this this man who's running around and opening blind eyes and healing the lepers he's doing these wonderful marvelous works but that's what he let's see what he does pertaining to the law so they threw down this adulterous woman before the feet of Jesus and what were they expecting they were expecting to find judgment but little did they know that they had just thrown that woman down at this I I believe in front of The Mercy Seat because God had come down the mercies he had come down and now was in tabernacling the fullness of the godhead bodily was now dwelling and the man Christ Jesus and they were looking for law but they threw her down in front of the mercy seat and Jesus stooped down and he started to ride in the sand had one by one from the oldest to the youngest the accusers went away what was God doing God was fulfilling prophecy Glory God was fulfilling prophecy God was making history the law condemned her and in the face of the law woman I'm speaking to somebody tonight Hallelujah sister where are thine accusers none Lord but you hear the words of the Lord neither do I condemn you go and sin no more God fulfilling prophecy god making history for the scripture would say in Hebrews 8 12. for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more you never did it in the first place you were the intended target thank you Lord of this message oh how great it is God's sitting in a prophet God bringing to manifestation Luke 17 30. oh that the palm oil the kangaroo and the caterpillar the Locust I will restore it shall be light in the evening time you're Justified you never did it you you were the intended target God keeping his word the deadness moved away a living people with a cross and a spiritually dead people tried to impersonate and drown what was it God fulfilling prophecy and making history brother when you were sick and you were laying in that bed with an infection in your back and your whole life was being tore upside down and you needed a savior you needed a word you needed a Deliverance you needed something that can change your condition and change your circumstance and all of this written word and all of this prophetic word you are the intended target you are that predestinated seed laying there a deep crawling to a deep and when that word struck that predestinated seed something was quickened and Made Alive you were an eagle Isaiah 53 and 5 says but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity oh Lord may your word never get old have we heard it so much we're not moved he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed the word hit the mark the word hit the target behold I send you Elijah who's the you a Malachi 4 5. who's the you come on group participation here are we a cuddle a cudjoe club now that's our basic principles to get into this group that this word's exciting this word has life you can't tell me enough who I am you can't tell me enough God sent a prophet glory to God he sent a prophet he sent you a prophet he was bruised for your iniquities I'm telling you what when it comes time to the reading of the will you should be excited about it if you knew if it was all rigged and you knew you had the winning ticket to the lottery if somebody came and told you let's just say I don't know but let's just say the governor and all the powers that be at a secret meeting with you and say Amen this Joker's rigged you're going to win the lottery here's the winning ticket I kind of would be inclined to hear the reading of the winning ticket and as they started to read off those winning numbers and it was starting to match everything that had been said don't you realize that your name was attached to the Seven Seals don't you realize that that was your will don't you realize what Adam lost the title deed the book of redemption that went back into the hands of God it laid there until Christ atoned for our sin and he ascended up a kinsman redeemer and he took the book that's why John was weeping because nobody was worthy to take the book but then when the book was opened what did the prophet say that John was all excited about he said John must have saw his name in there John found out that his name was attached to the title deed book of redemption you were the intended target of Malachi 4 5. you are the intended target of Luke 17 30. you are the intended target of Revelations 10 1-7 the mighty angel coming down with an open book and end read your name read your name read your name I wrote your name on the Lamb's Book of Life you are predestinated you are the intended target my word will not return unto me void oh Lord help us if we turn this corner when you look in the Old Testament we'll be working towards the close I haven't seen you in a while I love y'all when you look into the Old Testament at the forgiveness of sin and the law this is part two part two now so try to make it short and sweet I thought I wouldn't belong and on part two I won't be long so there we go I got them both in I was long on the first one I'll be short on the second one but when you look into the law into Leviticus I believe chapter 4. the law went forth and said now for there to be an atonement or forgiveness of sin there would have to be a sacrifice and the one that was ordained to perform the sacrifice were the priest and so the priest would have to execute the letter of the law they would have to be dressed right they would have to carry out the law to the letter and then if they met God's requirement then they had the promise of the letter of the law that their sins were forgiven they were accounted for it was a covering it's just a type and a shadow so when you look into the Old Testament and you see that that's why in Luke Chapter 5 when they lowered that man through the roof and there the scribes and Pharisees were looking what was the attraction there was this great mass of people they were wondering what all the commotion was and hear now this man that's uh a bedridden eye I believe he might have had palsy that they were lowering him down he was lame he couldn't walk they lower him in there and what does Jesus do Jesus looks at the man and says thy sins be forgiven you now those Sadducees and Pharisees they were not unjustly if you will criticizing what had taken place they were asking the right question the problem is they weren't seed but let's look into our Bible real quick into Luke chapter 5. verse 20-24 foreign I better get there hey that's great it follows right after our text Luke chapter 5. verse 20. he says and when he saw their faith he said unto him man by sins I have forgiven thee now what were the scribes and the Pharisees witnessing what was the attraction it says and the scribes and the Pharisees begin to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies that part was wrong the next part who can forgive sins but God Alone hello they needed to just do the math this man is claiming to be God but what did Jesus do he looked at them they reasoned within their heart second clue they should have known right there he just discerned the thoughts and intents of my heart let's just read the story he says who can forgive sins but God alone but when Jesus perceived their thoughts so these were students of the word they knew there was only one person that could forgive sin and that was God Alone so the very word himself turns to him and says Discerning their thoughts he says but Jesus perceived their thoughts he answered and said to them what reason ye in your hearts whether it is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk but that ye may know Glory that's the same word that came in the end time Hallelujah the same word came in this generation declaring Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever search the scriptures and then ye think you have eternal life but they are that which testify of me prophecy being fulfilled god making history but that ye may know that the son of man Oh Glory to God but that ye may know that the subtle man hath power upon the Earth to forgive sins he said unto the sick of the palsy if I could say it like this if you don't believe my words believe my works for they testify of who I am if it's if it's hard for you to understand the Discerning of the thoughts and intents of the art if it's hard for you to understand a man living between two different worlds if it's hard for you to understand the third heaven if it's hard for you to understand all of those things that which were spoken if it's hard for you to believe those things look at the works they testify of who I am but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon the Earth to forgive sin he said unto the sick of palsy I say unto thee rise take up thy couch and go into the house Hallelujah what was it God fulfilling prophecy it was God making history but you see they failed to recognize what the attraction was they failed to recognize what it was all about so much so that there would be a blind man that would be healed and they would call the blind man and start to accuse him start to acquestion him just like the other other Pharisees and Pharisees they did not want to accept the way the Messiah came they didn't want to believe it because it didn't come to their denomination it didn't vindicate them but it came according to the time and the purpose that God intended and it when it came in the manifestation of a little hillbilly with a seventh grade education they didn't want to believe it Glory but the bride can't help but believe it because it's your identification and the blind man would have to tell him whoa he would have to literally rebuke the the most holy Pharisees and Sadducees look these guys weren't just some put on joke even though they kind of were because there was nothing behind the veil you know it's like the fallacy of worship you know it's kind of funny they're all taking the blood and everything and they're going back behind the veil and there's nothing back there because the ark had been carried away into Babylon you ever think about that there was no holiest of holies why where was the Holy place it was standing before them Glory the holiest of all these was now in Tabernacle a body thou has prepared for me and so the Blind Man's rebuking him saying what are you talking why are you asking me who opened my never in the whole history of the world has it ever been recorded that a man born blind his eyes have been opened and y'all are supposed to be the most educated most spiritual people of the age and you're asking me who opened my eyes maybe you too want to be their disciple and they reviled him because he said look I'm not I don't know I don't know exactly where he come from Glory I don't really know about his birth I don't really know what happened there uh uh I believe April 9th in 1909 and maybe don't really realize what happened in 1933 out there on the Ohio River I don't really know what exactly happened there December 22nd in 1962 when there was a vision and he was caught up in a constantly I really don't know much about the cloud that had appeared there in February 28th and now all of these people they're all in an uproar and I don't really know about all these people talking about people who died on a bridge and they can't go in the archives in the database and explain all these I really can't tell you about all these things but one thing I can tell you I once was blind but now I see what is it God fulfilling his word god making history in the bride Hallelujah well I ain't done yet see they failed to to recognize what the attraction was never before had these things taken place as it says in John 9 32 we'll get towards a close John 9 32 some of us wouldn't like it overseas I'll tell you that much we kind of have a rule down there you want to preach longer than it took them to get there because they walk to church you imagine somebody walking three hours to church and then you give them some little 30 45 minute service cool I'll never forget brother well we might be here a while but this brother he got up there preached a wonderful message preached ours brother preached a beautiful sermon and he turned it over to brother Duke and he came up brother Joker started preaching start laying in that word he kept preaching longer and longer brother Diego just took his Liberty being his church and afterwards after preaching hours he said brother I'm so sorry but I couldn't help notice those 12 young boys that come in the back they walked four days to be in the meeting and they made it in time at the very end of the last service when you were preaching and I couldn't take it I had to say something you know what I say to that them boys was right on time they were walking in the duty of the the word they got to the house of God and I believe God met their need I blew out a tire one time going to church and and I've told this story before I put another my spare on my spare blew out I got the mechanic finally got that change I got down to church and I got there and there's about 10 minutes left to preaching but you know what I had in my heart I had a faith seed that said that 10 minutes is for me that kind of attitude towards the word of God and it says in John 9 32 it says since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was blind if this man were not God he could do nothing all right I want to say if it wasn't God fulfilling prophecy then William Branham could have done nothing don't you realize God was preserving the voice of the age for you this isn't so much about the prophet as much as we love our brother and and and it's for our benefit and it was the vessel God chose to orchestrate through but he was a man subject to like passions like you and I he would have been a murderer he would have been a drinker he would have been a smoker but there was something over his life that was keeping him when I put my Pillar of Fire came down in that poplar tree when he was seven years old and said don't drink or smoke for I have a specific work for you to do when you get older he was born under that sign and bored for that purpose because God's word what it will accomplish what he said now put yourself there church it will accomplish what he said it would accomplish when his legs got blown off I believe at the age of 14 by a shotgun he went to hell he would have died he did die well he went down to Hell I think that's the only way you get there am I right so much so that he would stand later in his ministry and say this might sound irresponsible but I've been to both players we've got such a glorious message ain't no more mysteries in that book we've received a Vindicated Prophet that's been to Hell he's been beyond the curtain of time he's been beyond Genesis he's been past Revelations all for what for you for you for you because you are the intended target he would have killed them boys shooting that gun so much so when he lost his wife hoping and Sharon he tried to commit suicide not once twice so far if it was up to brother Branham he'd have been a drunkard it'd have been a drink what because what happened I forgot that part right remember he was with his girls had had eyes like a dove and oh there was my little sweet art she was smoking a cigarette and they wanted to give him a cigarette and he well I want to smoke a two and he went to put it to his house and all said there was that what it was the word producing in his life what God said it would it wasn't what brother Branham could do Glory it was what God said he would do God said you will be a prophet your name will be William pranam you will reveal the Seven Seals all of that was predetermined he was the intended target just like Mary he's down there on the river with his daddy could go he was down there on the river with his daddy how many brothers did he have 12 13 14 Brothers and all of them drinking there and he's down there with his his daddy and his friend and they're gonna drink and now they're talking oh his daddy you know brother Brandon respect has looked up to his daddy and he goes what does your son drink he says no I guess I raised one my daddy calling me a give me that bottle and with everything in him he wanted to prove to his daddy he wasn't a but you see that Prophet had another Daddy he had another father he was birthed by the word he was predestinated and how much how hard brother Branham tried to sabotage what had been spoken there was nothing he could do to stop the word of God because God's word will not return void and the pride of Jesus Christ God has spoken I will have a bride she will be without spot without wrinkle she will be there what is it God fulfilling prophecy god making history in you well we'll call for the musicians as we keep going God keeping his word Hallelujah I want to say this Jesus was give me give me a few minutes Jesus was passing through the street now people everywhere were bumping into him but there was something in a woman's heart that said if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment I will be made whole and all of a sudden Jesus stops he says who touched me I perceive virtue has gone out for me what is virtue power I perceive power has gone out for me if I can just Touch the Hem of His garments I want to tell you virtue flows from this message if you walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin if you walk in the light of the hour oh there's virtue there is power that is Flowing from the message God keeping his word the deadness moves what God keep in his word what God said he would send the prophet God said he would loosen the sentences what is it it's God keeping his word and when God keeps his word the deadness moves away that first man has to die you have to put on that new man and a living people cross over what that same spirit that was in Jesus Christ if that same Spirit dwell in you it will also Quicken it'll also make you alive it will put on the new man Zechariah 9 and 9. would say rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion shout o daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a cult the full of an ass what's the attraction on the mountain what's taking place what is it all about church I know we've gone longer than usual but what is it all about what is the attraction on the mountain Romans 8 3 would say this for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh and play something softly sister God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that day in Calvary when Abel by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice contain he must have tied a grapevine around the Lamb's neck drug him up to the Rock took a rock in his hand for a lance and he pulled his little head back and chopped and hacked him until he died and his wool bathed with his own blood he wallowed in his blood it was a shadow but that day on Calvary there wasn't a lamb of this Earth but it was the Lamb of God that was dying wallowing in his own blood he was hacked and chopped and beat spit on and slammed and smacked and everything by the world the blood dropping off his legs when Abel's lamb died it died speaking in a language that Abel could not understand it was bleeding and when God's lamb died on Calvary that day he spoke in a language that no one understood my God my God why is thou forsaken me foreign it was God's land hacked to pieces chopped up [Music] he was the very lamb that Abel had in mind when he seen the promise seed of the woman he was the land that Daniel saw that was here out of the mountain without hands he was the wheel in the middle of the wheel for the prophet all they had foresaw was met on that day that day on Calvary that brought the great thing in that broke the back of Satan what was it God fulfilling prophecy and making history man has all of their achievements they can lay claim to this and they can lay claim to that [Music] but the greatest man [Music] that ever walk this side was the man Christ Jesus they have all their achievements they climbed this hill and they climbed this Everest but there was a man that climbed Mount Calvary and he bore all of your sin and all of your shame so you wouldn't have to live under condemnation so that you could be forgiven that's the greatest day in history that every time you name a date every time somebody's born every time you pinned under the date it testifies at that day on Calvary God fulfilling prophecy and making history so much more Zechariah 14-7 will end on this but it shall be one day which it shall be known unto the Lord not day or night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light what was that prophecy the constellation of angels what was that voice that spoke down there as John the Baptist 4 in the first coming of Christ so shall your ministry for on the second coming of Christ why would the prophet stand there after preaching Christ The Mystery of God revealed and say now if you look at the clock it's two o'clock on the dot you who are spiritual if you look at the clock it's two o'clock on the dock why why is he saying that because now the prophet is realizing when the pillar of fire dropped down on the Ohio River in 1933 at two o'clock and said as John the Baptist four ran the second coming to Christ so shall your ministry forerun the second coming of Christ now he's standing there and saying this day [Music] this day this scripture is fulfilled God said he would do it God prophesied your ministry would force her on the second coming and now I'm declaring [Music] God fulfilling prophecy and making history that which is promised has been fulfilled what is the attraction on the mountain last quote go ahead and Stan they're just as puzzled of that Supernatural Halo hanging Yonder in the sky as they was when the Magis come following a star saying where is he that's born King of the Jews what was it God fulfilling his word and there shall rise a star out of Jacob and the god of Heaven promised the evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery was prophecy he's referring to the vision he had on December 22nd 1962 and then after that Vision uh eight days later or seven days later he would preach sirs what time is it what time is it sirs but now this is the prophet's word but now it's history it's past the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir and what's
