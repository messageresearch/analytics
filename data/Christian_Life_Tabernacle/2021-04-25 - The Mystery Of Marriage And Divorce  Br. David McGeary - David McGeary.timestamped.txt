[17:42] when they say unto me let's go to the
[17:44] house of god
[17:45] amen i trust you're happy in your heart
[17:47] and to be here amen let's invite brother
[17:49] mike for us so i'm reading
[17:51] god bless you
[18:05] good morning
[18:09] you know i think that uh we're all
[18:11] familiar with the story of lot
[18:15] we abraham's nephew who found himself
[18:17] dwelling
[18:19] in an ungodly and corrupt civilization
[18:23] you know and i suppose that you know we
[18:25] have a tendency to to highlight that as
[18:27] an example of a backslidden believer
[18:31] you know this man who made the choice
[18:34] to live among sin to accept
[18:38] a certain standard of living so that he
[18:40] could enjoy the luxuries
[18:42] and the comforts that life offered him
[18:46] you know and he lost his family over
[18:48] that and there's certainly a
[18:50] life lesson there he lost everything
[18:54] but i think we forget that lot was never
[18:56] supposed to be with abraham in the first
[18:58] place
[19:00] you know if abraham hadn't compromised
[19:02] an er
[19:04] lot would have never found himself in
[19:06] sodom
[19:08] and there's maybe another lesson there
[19:09] about how our response to the word
[19:11] can have an effect on those around us
[19:16] but we do know this from the scripture
[19:17] that lot was more than just a man who
[19:19] experienced backsliding he was a
[19:21] righteous man
[19:23] he was a just man it says that in second
[19:25] peter 2
[19:27] and verse 7 and delivered just lot
[19:31] vexed with the filthy conversations of
[19:34] the wicked
[19:36] for that righteous man dwelling among
[19:39] them
[19:40] in seeing and hearing vexed his
[19:42] righteous soul
[19:43] from day to day with their unlawful
[19:46] deeds
[19:48] it might be easy to point to lot as an
[19:50] example of a backslidden believer but
[19:53] the question i would ask is how many
[19:55] believers
[19:56] are truly vexed by the condition of the
[19:58] world that they live in
[20:00] do they have the heart of a righteous
[20:04] man
[20:06] you know in spite of everything he found
[20:08] himself in he had another kind of heart
[20:10] and he had a heart that was actually
[20:12] pretty similar to david's in that regard
[20:14] we're going to look at psalm 55 this
[20:16] morning
[20:19] you know and what struck me as i was
[20:22] reading psalm 55 is this is
[20:25] you know very much the same thing david
[20:28] being vexed
[20:29] being troubled by the condition that he
[20:31] found himself surrounded by
[20:33] a man after god's own heart similar to
[20:37] lot his
[20:37] righteous soul was vexed daily but was
[20:41] also interesting about psalm 55 as you
[20:43] read this he could be speaking of
[20:45] the hour that we live in it could almost
[20:47] be ripped from off the headlines of the
[20:49] newspapers that we live in the condition
[20:51] that we find ourselves in in this last
[20:53] age
[20:54] in verse 2 it says this as he's kind of
[20:56] crying out to the lord he says attend
[20:58] unto me
[20:59] and hear me i mourn in my complaint i
[21:02] make a noise
[21:03] because of the voice
[21:07] of the enemy because of the oppression
[21:10] of the wicked you know and notice it
[21:12] wasn't some specific
[21:13] act or some specific deed or things that
[21:15] he was witnessing but it was because of
[21:17] a voice
[21:18] there was this constant voice this
[21:20] narrative this message that was
[21:22] pummeling him
[21:23] trying to affect how he reacted to get
[21:26] him to carry on that narrative to get
[21:28] him to pick up that message and share it
[21:30] to have that become part of his
[21:32] conversation
[21:33] you know i was just thinking if that
[21:35] isn't just an example of the hour that
[21:36] we live in
[21:37] where we're surrounded by voices and by
[21:39] narratives and by social discourses and
[21:41] there's this constant pressure this
[21:43] constant
[21:44] expectation to pick it up and carry it
[21:46] to react to it
[21:47] to make it part of our message you know
[21:50] he says in verse 3 for they
[21:52] cast iniquity upon me that's what that
[21:54] is
[21:55] trying to cast onto us a reaction a
[21:59] message a voice
[22:00] to say something that is different than
[22:01] the message we've been called
[22:03] to bring you know we've been called to
[22:06] speak the word
[22:08] not to adopt any other message
[22:11] that would be iniquity but the thing
[22:13] that's important to understand is as you
[22:15] look at all the social narratives of the
[22:17] day
[22:18] the message is the the social discourse
[22:20] the things that you're constantly
[22:21] pressured to react to and carry forth
[22:24] everything is targeted as you as a
[22:26] believer
[22:27] because if you remember you are his
[22:30] messengers and if the enemy can get you
[22:33] to share
[22:34] something else what victory would that
[22:37] be
[22:37] for him if his if the lord's messengers
[22:40] are sharing
[22:40] the enemy's message so it's important to
[22:44] to to watch that but you know what's
[22:46] also interesting in verse 5
[22:48] how the reaction of that is to try to
[22:50] get david to be afraid
[22:52] you know to try to cause fear to try to
[22:55] cause worry and doubt and make you react
[22:57] in a way different than what the word
[23:00] would have you react
[23:03] and i like verse six oh that i had the
[23:06] wings of a dove
[23:08] that i could fly away to some place in
[23:11] the wilderness and just rest
[23:13] i don't want you but that sounds awful
[23:14] familiar to me
[23:16] how nice would that sound just be able
[23:18] to just fly away on some
[23:20] some wings be carried forth and rest and
[23:22] it turns out we had a messenger in this
[23:24] day that preached that there is a dove
[23:26] in fact it was this very verse i think
[23:28] that he took his sermon on the wings
[23:30] of a snow white dough
[23:33] but you know it's we could go on and on
[23:35] and look at this but i like verse 22
[23:38] after all the prayer after all laying
[23:40] this before the lord this is where david
[23:41] arrived
[23:43] cast thy burden upon the lord
[23:46] and he shall sustain me he shall
[23:50] never suffer the righteous to be moved
[23:55] we do have a place we can go to for rest
[23:58] you know it's interesting i thought it
[23:59] was good that psalm 55 began with the
[24:01] enemy trying to cast something on david
[24:03] and he turned
[24:04] around and cast it right back on the
[24:05] lord that's our answer
[24:07] to the voice that the enemy would have
[24:09] us pick up in this day in this
[24:11] whatever that social narrative is and
[24:13] there's many of them
[24:15] remember the promise in verse 22 as we
[24:17] read this
[24:18] you know the same righteous soul that's
[24:20] vexed by the circumstances of the hour
[24:22] is the same
[24:24] righteous soul that shall never be moved
[24:28] so if we read psalm 22 together i would
[24:30] encourage you kind of put that put
[24:31] yourself in the scripture
[24:32] recognize the day you live in look at
[24:35] the reaction to the narrative the voice
[24:37] the pressure that the enemy would try to
[24:39] put on david
[24:40] and to me it was an encouragement
[24:41] there's a place we can put it
[24:43] and we'll never be moved let's read that
[24:45] together psalm 55
[24:47] it says give ear to my prayer o god and
[24:50] hide not thyself from my supplication
[24:54] attend unto me and hear me i mourn in my
[24:57] complaint
[24:58] and make a noise because of the voice of
[25:00] the enemy
[25:01] because of the oppression of the wicked
[25:03] for they cast iniquity upon me
[25:05] and in wrath they hate me my heart is
[25:08] sore pained within me
[25:10] and the terrors of death are fallen upon
[25:12] me
[25:13] fearfulness and trembling are come upon
[25:15] me and
[25:16] horror hath overwhelmed me and i said o
[25:19] that i had wings like a dub for then
[25:22] would i fly away and be at rest
[25:24] lo then would i wander far off and
[25:27] remain in the wilderness
[25:28] selah i would hasten my escape from the
[25:31] windy storm in tempest
[25:33] destroy o lord and divide their tongues
[25:36] for i have seen
[25:37] violence and strife in the city day and
[25:40] night they go about it upon the walls
[25:42] thereof
[25:43] mischief also and sorrow are in the
[25:45] midst of it
[25:46] wickedness is in the midst thereof
[25:48] deceit and guile depart not from her
[25:51] streets
[25:52] for it was not an enemy that reproached
[25:54] me then i could have borne
[25:56] it neither was it he that hated me that
[25:58] didn't magnify himself against me
[26:01] then i would have hid myself from him
[26:03] but it was thou
[26:05] a man mine equal my guide and my
[26:07] acquaintance
[26:08] we took sweet counsel together and
[26:11] walked into the house of god in company
[26:13] let death seize upon them and let them
[26:16] go down
[26:16] quick into hell for wickedness is in
[26:19] their dwellings
[26:20] and among them as for me i will call
[26:23] upon god
[26:24] and the lord shall save me evening and
[26:27] morning
[26:27] and at noon will i pray and cry aloud
[26:30] and
[26:31] he shall hear my voice he hath delivered
[26:33] my soul
[26:34] in peace from the battle that was
[26:36] against me for there were many with me
[26:39] god shall hear and afflict them even he
[26:42] that abideth of old
[26:43] selah because they have no changes
[26:46] therefore they fear not god
[26:49] he hath put forth his hands against such
[26:51] that be at peace with him
[26:53] he hath broken his covenant the words of
[26:56] his mouth were smoother than butter
[26:58] but war was in his heart his words were
[27:01] softer than oil
[27:02] yet were they drawn swords cast thy
[27:05] burden upon
[27:06] the lord and he shall sustain thee he
[27:08] shall never suffer the righteous to be
[27:11] moved
[27:11] but thou o god shall bring down into the
[27:14] pit of destruction
[27:16] bloody and deceitful men shall not live
[27:18] out half their days
[27:20] but i will trust in thee amen
[27:28] amen god bless you be happier
[27:32] i'm praising

[42:21] uh just wanna uh let everyone know that
[42:24] there's some
[42:26] excavating and uh water control work
[42:29] being
[42:30] done in the back so usually i know the
[42:32] children's run back over there to play
[42:35] but it's really muddy right now so if we
[42:37] can all
[42:38] as parents just try to make sure that we
[42:40] keep our children from going back
[42:42] over there and and and playing in the
[42:45] mud
[42:46] i'm pretty sure it would not be
[42:48] appreciated
[42:49] uh so we certainly want to just let
[42:52] everybody know that
[42:53] to try to keep the children from going
[42:55] back there amen
[42:57] also when i just announced that uh
[43:00] brother david will be preaching by the
[43:02] bill ivy's memorial weekends meeting
[43:05] and uh anybody interested in going
[43:08] please uh
[43:09] let one of the deacons know i will try
[43:11] to
[43:12] put a list together for transportation
[43:15] and a place to stay so if you're
[43:17] interested
[43:18] please just do that let one of the
[43:21] deacons know
[43:22] amen uh brother
[43:26] joelle avila writes um he's asking
[43:29] requests
[43:29] for prayers for uh for ruben
[43:33] uh byegas about his immigration status
[43:37] and they certainly want to just stick
[43:38] that before the lord and pray that god
[43:40] will
[43:41] undertake for reuben amen if you have a
[43:44] need upon your heart this morning just
[43:46] leave your hand up to him
[43:47] man i believe there's no need too small
[43:50] i mean
[43:51] everything he if he watches over the
[43:53] sparrow
[43:54] if he can raise the little fish i
[43:56] believe this morning he sees the heart
[43:58] and he knows the needs behind
[43:59] amen the brothers that are taking the
[44:01] offerings if he could come but it might
[44:03] be almost sake if we could just come
[44:04] this morning and take this before the
[44:06] lord
[44:08] [Music]
[44:19] it's just about our heads and our hearts
[44:21] [Music]
[44:24] heavenly father lord what a privilege it
[44:27] is to carry
[44:29] these requests to you in prayer lord
[44:34] lord we know that you're a prayer
[44:35] answering god lord
[44:38] lord and our precious brother howell has
[44:41] once again
[44:44] brought forth a request from reuben
[44:48] lord i was just sitting there
[44:52] thinking about my brother's faith
[44:57] lord he probably brings more prayer
[44:59] requests than anyone because he believes
[45:01] in prayer
[45:03] lord he sees the results of prayer
[45:06] lord and we just want to join our faith
[45:08] with our brother lord for this
[45:11] reuben lord that the immigration papers

[45:22] lord the many needs that are on the
[45:24] hearts of your people lord by the
[45:26] uplifted hands and
[45:28] lord maybe there were even some that
[45:31] just were holding it in their heart or
[45:36] that we're so thankful that you're a
[45:39] discerner of the heart
[45:42] lord those that have questions lord may
[45:44] you just

[1:00:24] we believe oh god

[1:00:31] plan that you've unfolded down through
[1:00:36] time
[1:00:37] we just asked this morning that you help
[1:00:40] us
[1:00:41] with this great subject matter that lies
[1:00:43] before us this morning
[1:00:47] that in all that spoken father that
[1:00:50] you'd receive the glory
[1:00:52] the praise and the honor
[1:00:55] that our understanding might not be two
[1:00:57] carnal things
[1:00:59] but of spiritual things we ask for your
[1:01:03] grace and your help
[1:01:04] this morning in jesus precious and
[1:01:08] wonderful name we pray amen
[1:01:12] amen god bless you this morning
[1:01:17] we're going to open our bibles to
[1:01:19] matthew the 19th
[1:01:22] chapter

[1:01:46] sis
[1:01:46] you're wonderful god bless you so nice
[1:01:49] to have you
[1:01:51] with us this morning i heard jeremy is
[1:01:54] here and his wife
[1:01:55] so god bless you and and each one
[1:01:59] a great subject matter this morning
[1:02:02] and we'll go into it and we'll skim
[1:02:05] it and then maybe if we decide to go
[1:02:09] and bring it forth in deeper sections
[1:02:12] so if we read here in the 19th chapter
[1:02:17] and it came to pass that when jesus had
[1:02:21] finished
[1:02:22] these sayings he departed from galilee
[1:02:27] into the coast of judea
[1:02:30] beyond jordan and a great multitude
[1:02:34] followed him and he healed
[1:02:38] them there and the pharisees came
[1:02:42] unto him tempting him and
[1:02:45] saying unto him
[1:02:48] is it lawful for a man to put away his
[1:02:52] wife for every cause
[1:02:57] and he answered and said unto them
[1:03:02] have ye not read
[1:03:05] that which he made them
[1:03:09] at the beginning male
[1:03:12] and female and for this
[1:03:15] cause shall the man leave his father and
[1:03:18] mother
[1:03:19] and shall cleave to his wife and they
[1:03:22] twain shall be one flesh
[1:03:26] therefore there are no more twain but
[1:03:30] one flesh
[1:03:32] and what therefore god hath
[1:03:35] joined together let no man put us under
[1:03:40] they said unto him why
[1:03:44] did moses then command
[1:03:47] to give a writ of divorcement
[1:03:51] to put her away and he said unto them
[1:03:55] moses because of the hardness of your
[1:03:58] hearts
[1:03:59] suffered you to put your wives
[1:04:03] away your wives but from the beginning
[1:04:07] it was not so
[1:04:12] and i say unto you whosoever shall put
[1:04:14] away his wife
[1:04:15] except be fornication and shall be
[1:04:18] married to another committeth adultery
[1:04:20] and whosoever mereth her which is put
[1:04:22] away doth
[1:04:24] commit adultery our gracious heavenly
[1:04:27] father we ask you to bless this to us
[1:04:29] this morning
[1:04:30] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[1:04:34] god bless you may be seated
[1:04:39] now
[1:04:44] we want to this morning
[1:04:50] cover and go into the next sermon
[1:04:54] that has been on the list of sermons
[1:04:58] that we're going through and this
[1:05:02] next sermon is the sermon of marriage
[1:05:05] and divorce
[1:05:07] now in the years that i've been in the
[1:05:11] message
[1:05:13] this is probably the most controversial
[1:05:18] misunderstood misinterpreted
[1:05:22] message that we've ever dealt with
[1:05:30] and
[1:05:33] it's just because it's such a
[1:05:36] question now we're not
[1:05:40] here this morning
[1:05:43] to discuss
[1:05:47] marriage and divorce cases
[1:05:51] okay that is not what
[1:05:56] we're about first of all
[1:06:00] i'm not a prophet i can't really discern
[1:06:05] the depth into all things that
[1:06:08] cause this or cause this
[1:06:12] what is adultery and what is in adultery
[1:06:16] and and all these great subjects that
[1:06:19] come up uh that
[1:06:24] people want to discuss
[1:06:28] i've known from experience if somebody
[1:06:31] wants to get married they're going to
[1:06:34] get married
[1:06:36] if they feel they can get married then
[1:06:38] they're going to pursue that
[1:06:41] route if they have
[1:06:45] if they look at their situation and they
[1:06:48] read their own tea leaves and they feel
[1:06:52] that
[1:06:52] because of this because of this because
[1:06:54] of that
[1:06:55] i feel i have a right or a man feels
[1:06:58] because of this because of this
[1:07:00] i have a right that will never be
[1:07:03] straightened up
[1:07:05] you understand i have all kinds of
[1:07:08] people
[1:07:09] that they're they're going to do
[1:07:11] whatever they have to do if they feel
[1:07:13] that
[1:07:14] they're going to have a right to get
[1:07:16] married they'll do whatever they have to
[1:07:18] do
[1:07:20] to bring that to pass and so
[1:07:23] this is not what i'm talking about this
[1:07:26] morning
[1:07:26] this is not what we're preaching about
[1:07:29] when we
[1:07:30] cover the subject of marriage and
[1:07:34] divorce
[1:07:35] we're not trying to give you answers
[1:07:39] for your life situation
[1:07:42] whether you've been married before or
[1:07:44] haven't been married before
[1:07:46] what whether uh you've been involved in
[1:07:50] a divorce or
[1:07:51] haven't been developed involved in a
[1:07:54] divorce
[1:07:56] that's not my place
[1:07:59] you understand to discuss
[1:08:04] what your particular situation is
[1:08:09] because i could sit there and say to you
[1:08:11] well i don't think you have a right to
[1:08:14] but if you think you have a right to
[1:08:17] you know i go way down on the scale
[1:08:21] you know what i'm saying so you're not
[1:08:23] going to change a person's heart
[1:08:25] so i want you to understand when we
[1:08:27] start talking about this subject
[1:08:30] of marriage and divorce we are not
[1:08:33] talking about the the
[1:08:36] natural circumstances
[1:08:41] that are in people's lives
[1:08:44] do i do you understand that so
[1:08:47] i i don't want you to walk out of here
[1:08:50] and say brother mcgary said
[1:08:52] i could or brother mcgary said i
[1:08:54] couldn't
[1:08:56] there is a a
[1:09:00] a message called marriage in divorce
[1:09:04] that you can read and discuss
[1:09:07] your own answers we're going to look at
[1:09:11] it from
[1:09:12] a different aspect
[1:09:15] okay so if you could
[1:09:18] understand from that kind of uh
[1:09:22] aspect that we're going on
[1:09:26] that that you will more or less kind of
[1:09:30] have the understanding
[1:09:32] of the approach that we're taking and
[1:09:36] and so you know anytime you have a great
[1:09:40] uh subject like this it's uh
[1:09:43] you know it's going to be given to all
[1:09:46] kinds of different
[1:09:48] ideas okay so i'm not trying to change
[1:09:52] your thought
[1:09:53] on marriage divorce or anything about
[1:09:56] your life but i want to understand
[1:09:57] the prophet of god said there was an
[1:09:59] answer
[1:10:01] to that question and to
[1:10:04] the question that raised he says this
[1:10:07] has been the biggest question
[1:10:09] in the church in all the church history
[1:10:13] it was even a question in the days of
[1:10:15] jesus
[1:10:16] man always wanting to understand
[1:10:20] this idea that happens when men and
[1:10:24] women
[1:10:24] can't get along and for some reason
[1:10:28] they've entered into a marriage
[1:10:30] and they no longer are compatible
[1:10:33] or whatever and all kinds of teachings
[1:10:36] and all kinds of doctrines
[1:10:38] and all kinds of ideas have come forth
[1:10:41] the prophet of god said there that at
[1:10:44] that time when he was bringing up this
[1:10:46] subject
[1:10:47] he said there was two major uh
[1:10:50] thoughts and ideas on the subject
[1:10:54] uh i'm sure there's that has multiplied
[1:10:57] and increased
[1:10:59] into many different thoughts
[1:11:02] we are entering into society now
[1:11:06] where uh interracial marriage
[1:11:09] is becoming a very common subject
[1:11:13] and so you take someone that sticks to
[1:11:16] traditional
[1:11:19] bible teaching without revelation
[1:11:22] you don't understand why god said for
[1:11:26] each to marry to their own kind and it
[1:11:29] has nothing to do with the personality
[1:11:32] of someone the looks of them
[1:11:34] the knowledge of them what their natural
[1:11:36] race is
[1:11:37] what their natural culture was it has to
[1:11:40] do
[1:11:40] with god's plan of creation so he
[1:11:44] created this you know
[1:11:47] uh and then he created this and he
[1:11:50] created this
[1:11:51] and and the the teaching
[1:11:55] really behind it is is that god knew
[1:11:58] what he was creating
[1:12:00] and he knew what that he wanted the
[1:12:03] outcome to be what the purpose of it was
[1:12:07] man's always came along and he's
[1:12:10] hybrided and mixed it and
[1:12:12] put this together and put that together
[1:12:15] and
[1:12:15] and that's what society has done
[1:12:19] now we don't go back and judge a person
[1:12:22] based on who their parents are we don't
[1:12:25] judge a person based on
[1:12:28] whether they're they come from a mixed
[1:12:30] marriage or any of those things
[1:12:33] so if you have the truth of the matter
[1:12:35] and now we have the circumstances that
[1:12:38] have happened
[1:12:39] because of life or basically
[1:12:42] if you want to know we'll get to that in
[1:12:44] a little bit because of sin
[1:12:47] okay and so again
[1:12:50] it goes back to a principle that god had
[1:12:54] established
[1:12:55] in the beginning of the plan that
[1:12:58] he made okay
[1:13:01] so god had a plan in the beginning
[1:13:05] that's what you have to understand
[1:13:07] that's why when
[1:13:08] jesus said and started this subject
[1:13:12] he said it wasn't so from
[1:13:16] the beginning
[1:13:19] okay so if you have if you're searching
[1:13:22] for an
[1:13:23] answer on a subject
[1:13:26] you there's got to be a truth
[1:13:29] somewhere and you can't adjust the truth
[1:13:34] to fix every circumstance
[1:13:38] you know so something gets watered down
[1:13:40] and watered down
[1:13:42] and watered down and everything times
[1:13:44] something changes
[1:13:46] then you try to change to fit things
[1:13:50] the words the word okay
[1:13:53] believe it or not according to the
[1:13:56] strictness of god's word
[1:13:58] none of us would ever be saved
[1:14:04] in fact god proved that by the law
[1:14:07] that there was a law that penalty was
[1:14:10] death and that no man
[1:14:14] could live that law and he
[1:14:17] showed by our nature and so that
[1:14:20] there's grace and there's mercy
[1:14:23] you understand grace and mercy is for
[1:14:26] him to apply
[1:14:28] it's not for me to take the word of god
[1:14:31] and reinterpret the word of god to make
[1:14:35] it become
[1:14:36] grace or mercy
[1:14:39] grace is the favor that god extends you
[1:14:44] in other words it's the it
[1:14:47] it what grace does is it it's a
[1:14:51] a a proclamation if i could say it that
[1:14:54] way
[1:14:55] or an intervention from the throne of
[1:14:59] god
[1:15:00] into your life to change the inevitable
[1:15:04] outcome of the path that you're on
[1:15:08] mercy is god taking
[1:15:11] the just judgments that you
[1:15:14] deserve and by his goodness and kindness
[1:15:19] having mercy in other words not applying
[1:15:22] to you
[1:15:24] the death you deserve and we're
[1:15:27] all nothing like we heard the songs
[1:15:31] today that sister lord son it's by
[1:15:34] that blood that
[1:15:38] we are free that we have a life
[1:15:42] so we have all sinned and we're all
[1:15:45] guilty of sin
[1:15:46] so we're not here trying to find
[1:15:50] something we're trying to come to an
[1:15:53] understanding
[1:15:54] of something that man has never been
[1:15:58] able to understand
[1:16:00] and the and what's so beautiful about it
[1:16:03] is
[1:16:04] he and he said this he says now we
[1:16:07] we also have two thoughts of this
[1:16:09] marriage and divorce
[1:16:11] now that our lord has opened
[1:16:14] the seven seal mysteries of his word
[1:16:17] to us in the last days now many of you
[1:16:22] this might be greek to you but
[1:16:26] my church understands he says
[1:16:31] that when you heard of the visions and
[1:16:34] what takes place
[1:16:35] and the questions is a bible question
[1:16:38] we are invited here to believe
[1:16:42] that there must be a true answer to the
[1:16:45] whole
[1:16:46] hidden secret that's been hid
[1:16:49] since the foundation of the world and
[1:16:53] and the bible prophesies and
[1:16:56] says that in this day these secrets
[1:16:59] would be made known
[1:17:01] revelations 10 active sounding
[1:17:05] of the seventh angel lady osean
[1:17:07] messenger
[1:17:08] the mysteries of god would be made known
[1:17:12] and this is the last age
[1:17:15] which is lady osea notice
[1:17:19] there must be an answer somewhere
[1:17:22] and being that the seven seal mysteries
[1:17:25] of god
[1:17:26] the seven seals how many understands
[1:17:28] that raise your hands
[1:17:30] let's see i think most of the books
[1:17:33] pretty soon the subject will be out he
[1:17:36] says
[1:17:37] the intent the our text
[1:17:40] invites us to go back to the
[1:17:44] beginning for the true
[1:17:47] scriptural answer and when
[1:17:51] he was confronted with this there was
[1:17:54] two things in view the priest said to
[1:17:58] him
[1:17:58] can he put awake his wife and marry
[1:18:01] another
[1:18:02] for any cause and jesus said it wasn't
[1:18:06] so from the beginning they said moses
[1:18:09] suffered us to write a writ of
[1:18:12] divorcement
[1:18:13] and to put her away for anything they
[1:18:16] wanted
[1:18:18] and he says moses did that because the
[1:18:21] hardness
[1:18:22] of your heart so we understand that
[1:18:26] what that we're saying here the reason
[1:18:28] that we
[1:18:29] can come to the answer
[1:18:34] you understand not not the rearranging
[1:18:38] of the circumstances
[1:18:41] but come to the answer why there was
[1:18:45] even such a thing of divorcement
[1:18:49] in the first place
[1:18:53] can you understand that because that was
[1:18:55] the question
[1:18:56] can a man do this can a man do that for
[1:18:59] this cause for that cause
[1:19:01] for any cause what's the causes okay
[1:19:04] because the question but jesus's answer
[1:19:07] was
[1:19:08] it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:19:11] so in other words you got
[1:19:14] yourselves into this fix or
[1:19:18] we got ourselves into this fix
[1:19:21] but it wasn't so for the from the
[1:19:24] beginning
[1:19:25] so the true answer to the question
[1:19:30] lies in the beginning
[1:19:34] okay that mystery
[1:19:38] of what was took place in the beginning
[1:19:42] had been hid behind seven seals
[1:19:46] so man couldn't really ever find
[1:19:50] the answer
[1:19:54] you understand so this is why he's
[1:19:56] saying
[1:19:57] now because of the seven seals being
[1:20:00] open
[1:20:02] because of the opening of the seals and
[1:20:05] the messenger the lady osea
[1:20:08] that has the answers to these mysteries
[1:20:12] i can now prophet of god speaking i can
[1:20:15] now
[1:20:16] address this subject and give you
[1:20:19] the word answer
[1:20:25] now you may not like the word answer i
[1:20:29] may not like the
[1:20:30] word answer the word answer may not
[1:20:33] fix your circumstance
[1:20:37] it wasn't intended to fix your
[1:20:39] circumstance
[1:20:41] it wasn't a ten he it was never intended
[1:20:44] to condemn or to justify
[1:20:48] the circumstance that you may be in your
[1:20:52] parents may be
[1:20:53] in your great uncle may be in and
[1:20:56] everything
[1:20:56] it had nothing and never had
[1:21:00] anything to do with trying to go back
[1:21:03] and rearrange and take it case by case
[1:21:06] and justify this and justify that and
[1:21:09] you were okay
[1:21:10] you weren't okay you should have you
[1:21:13] shouldn't have
[1:21:14] you had a right to you didn't forget it
[1:21:22] you'll never fix it
[1:21:28] it wasn't so from the
[1:21:31] beginning
[1:21:37] we weren't even this way
[1:21:41] in the beginning so
[1:21:44] so we we we that's what we're we we
[1:21:48] are emphasizing here that it
[1:21:51] it is uh based on the
[1:21:56] realization and the revelation
[1:22:00] of the the understanding
[1:22:04] of this great problem
[1:22:08] and great question so we got to know
[1:22:12] why the question arose
[1:22:16] in the first place and why
[1:22:19] that there could be forgiveness
[1:22:24] granted and and i'm going to jump ahead
[1:22:28] and just read one
[1:22:30] ques statement way in the back of the
[1:22:33] message it says
[1:22:34] now on the marriage and divorce see
[1:22:38] it has to be revealed
[1:22:41] until it's revealed you don't know it
[1:22:45] but he promised in the last days
[1:22:49] in this age that every hidden mystery
[1:22:53] in the bible would be revealed how many
[1:22:56] knows that
[1:22:57] revelations 10th chapter jesus
[1:23:00] promised it and that all these hidden
[1:23:03] mysteries on marriage and divorce and
[1:23:06] these
[1:23:06] other hidden mysteries that has been
[1:23:09] revealed
[1:23:10] in the end time and then brother branham
[1:23:13] goes on how god told him to go to
[1:23:15] tucson how he went up into the mountain
[1:23:18] the lord spoke to him and he says go
[1:23:20] tell your people
[1:23:21] it's all forgiven it's all like clean
[1:23:26] don't go on as you are
[1:23:30] okay you understand i can't handle that
[1:23:38] you know what i mean i do not want to
[1:23:40] put myself on that seat
[1:23:44] if someone comes into my congregation
[1:23:47] in their circumstance
[1:23:50] i never even look back on their life
[1:23:55] i take every person that walks through
[1:23:57] that door
[1:23:58] on their face value of the time they
[1:24:01] cross
[1:24:02] that door
[1:24:05] and that's all i try to be a christian
[1:24:09] from my side okay
[1:24:12] i try not to let their life affect
[1:24:16] my choices and my life
[1:24:19] nor do i probe
[1:24:23] you know i mean i don't know anybody
[1:24:25] that's ever sat down with me
[1:24:27] unless they're taking a particular
[1:24:30] office in the church
[1:24:31] and then i bring that person first of
[1:24:34] all
[1:24:35] and vet them personally and ask them
[1:24:38] a few questions there are certain things
[1:24:41] that certain things don't cover
[1:24:42] so let's take this subject now just for
[1:24:45] the next
[1:24:46] few moments from the standpoint of the
[1:24:49] opening of the seals
[1:24:51] and not from the standpoint of trying to
[1:24:55] solve and fix circumstances
[1:24:59] can we all do that okay
[1:25:02] so
[1:25:09] you know what i mean you can all uncurl
[1:25:11] your toes
[1:25:14] because i'm not going to be trying
[1:25:16] stepping on any toes
[1:25:18] i'm not trying to ruin any relationships
[1:25:21] or
[1:25:21] point any fingers but this was a
[1:25:25] mystery that was revealed
[1:25:28] and so let's go back and these are some
[1:25:31] wonderful things that brother branham
[1:25:33] taught
[1:25:34] now we understand that he said it wasn't
[1:25:38] so
[1:25:39] from the beginning so if we go back
[1:25:42] to the beginning we understand
[1:25:46] that adam was in the garden of eden
[1:25:50] and that todd had created the garden of
[1:25:53] eden
[1:25:54] is that correct and he placed his
[1:25:57] son in the garden of eden now remember
[1:26:01] there was no sin in the original
[1:26:04] creation
[1:26:07] no sin whatsoever adam
[1:26:11] was both what male and female
[1:26:15] in the garden in the beginning
[1:26:19] god adam was both male and female
[1:26:23] and there was no sin in the garden
[1:26:27] whatsoever and and so
[1:26:30] the uh and that was the beginning
[1:26:35] so jesus pointed to the answer
[1:26:39] saying it wasn't so in the beginning so
[1:26:43] in the beginning there was no sin
[1:26:46] in the original creation
[1:26:50] so we understand and this is also a
[1:26:53] great
[1:26:54] uh uh revelation
[1:26:57] but because there was no sin in the
[1:27:00] original creation
[1:27:02] we we understand what the original
[1:27:06] sin was and so the original sin
[1:27:10] or in other words was the first
[1:27:16] sin
[1:27:18] okay that was the first sin now we're
[1:27:21] we're not going to go into a great depth
[1:27:24] on it but
[1:27:25] really if the original sin was the first
[1:27:28] introduction of divorce
[1:27:33] and of another husband
[1:27:39] okay so that's what we realized
[1:27:43] took place in the beginning now
[1:27:46] everything
[1:27:47] uh in the original creation
[1:27:50] was in perfect harmony and perfect order
[1:27:55] everything was just run in perfect
[1:27:58] harmony
[1:27:59] and perfect order nothing was
[1:28:02] out of order everything had a plan
[1:28:05] everything had a great purpose
[1:28:07] and so this was basically everything was
[1:28:10] run that way there it was it
[1:28:12] it was just a beautiful harmony and and
[1:28:15] everything was in order and
[1:28:17] everything was just uh in a in a
[1:28:20] wonderful place
[1:28:22] and then we understand that god
[1:28:25] looked on his creation and said it was
[1:28:28] what it was good
[1:28:31] but god being the great
[1:28:35] master builder that he was god
[1:28:38] dwelt alone is that right
[1:28:42] can we know these things we've been
[1:28:43] taught these things and so god's
[1:28:45] dwelling alone and the reason we know
[1:28:47] these things is because of the opening
[1:28:49] of the seventh seal
[1:28:51] and god wanted what fellowship
[1:28:57] so when god looked at adam he said
[1:29:01] man dwells alone it's not good that he
[1:29:04] dwelt alone
[1:29:06] so now this great plan of god
[1:29:10] is going to unfold okay
[1:29:14] you you understand that most of you
[1:29:16] should probably know
[1:29:17] where we're going and therefore there is
[1:29:19] no sin
[1:29:20] in the original creation adam was both
[1:29:23] male
[1:29:24] and female god said well he said
[1:29:28] it's not good that adam
[1:29:31] dwells alone so i'm going to take from
[1:29:36] adam
[1:29:39] his female part and i'm going to
[1:29:43] out of the dust of the earth adam wasn't
[1:29:46] created
[1:29:48] cr created out of something else
[1:29:51] he was created out of god's creation
[1:29:54] you understand but the second thing that
[1:29:57] comes from that
[1:29:58] is a byproduct of the original
[1:30:01] adam was the first original man created
[1:30:04] by god the second part
[1:30:07] eve was a byproduct
[1:30:10] god knew what he was doing so he was a
[1:30:13] byproduct
[1:30:15] and so we understand that
[1:30:18] when eve was put there god put her
[1:30:22] as co-equal to adam
[1:30:26] they were one he said bone of my bone
[1:30:30] flesh of my flesh i'll call her woman
[1:30:34] i never she's pardon me she had come
[1:30:37] from me
[1:30:39] we're one and and
[1:30:42] this is where that as we uh
[1:30:45] go down a little bit uh
[1:30:48] down this line you you'll understand
[1:30:52] that because of this great
[1:30:55] plan that god had in his mind he allowed
[1:31:00] eve to be created now
[1:31:04] evil was i'm just going to preach it i
[1:31:07] can't
[1:31:08] explain it you can go back and read the
[1:31:10] book
[1:31:13] eve was designed
[1:31:18] to be deceived
[1:31:24] do you understand god he knew he had
[1:31:27] something in his heart
[1:31:29] that he wanted to do he couldn't
[1:31:32] adam could not be deceived
[1:31:35] because there was no sin in the original
[1:31:39] creation he had both male
[1:31:42] and female so when he took the female
[1:31:46] part of adam out at
[1:31:49] he he made her he
[1:31:52] placed within that part of the creation
[1:31:56] the ability for her to be
[1:31:59] deceived now sister you may think that
[1:32:03] ain't fair
[1:32:06] but without that
[1:32:10] because something else couldn't have
[1:32:12] transpired
[1:32:16] okay so uh and
[1:32:19] when you really look at it all of us
[1:32:22] here
[1:32:23] this morning are eids
[1:32:29] okay he says now he says
[1:32:33] he says now listen
[1:32:37] now for about five minutes i want to
[1:32:40] call your attention to something
[1:32:43] what is god god is a
[1:32:46] great eternal
[1:32:50] at the beginning way back before there
[1:32:53] was a beginning he wasn't
[1:32:56] even god did you know that
[1:33:00] a god is an object of worship
[1:33:04] and there wasn't anything to worship him
[1:33:07] he lived alone with his attributes
[1:33:14] look and now we see this great plan
[1:33:18] of why eve was made what was coming to
[1:33:21] pla
[1:33:22] path and in him was attributes
[1:33:26] and it is an attribute a thought
[1:33:30] now you'll get to something that will
[1:33:34] um border on the lesson for tonight
[1:33:39] notice he he was his attributes
[1:33:43] that was in him now it was in him to be
[1:33:46] father it was in him to be god
[1:33:50] it was in him to be son it was in him to
[1:33:54] be
[1:33:55] savior and in him to be
[1:33:58] healer and all these things here
[1:34:01] are just displaying his attributes
[1:34:05] there was nothing out of order you think
[1:34:09] god didn't see
[1:34:10] the end from the beginning certainly he
[1:34:14] did
[1:34:14] there was nothing out of order it's just
[1:34:17] displaying
[1:34:18] his attributes
[1:34:22] now he could not just make a man
[1:34:26] fall he had to put him on an
[1:34:29] equal basis of free moral agency
[1:34:32] to make his own choice but he knew he
[1:34:35] would fall
[1:34:37] now he can't be savior unless
[1:34:41] something's lost he can't be
[1:34:45] healer unless something's sick
[1:34:48] these things had to be that way
[1:34:51] god made them thus so that
[1:34:55] great attribute of god could be
[1:34:58] displayed
[1:34:59] there wasn't none he'd never been savior
[1:35:03] but we know he was even before
[1:35:06] there was time he was savior
[1:35:10] he was savior so there had to be
[1:35:12] something lost
[1:35:14] now it's going to be if it takes
[1:35:18] takes a loss it just in order to save it
[1:35:23] then it isn't justified
[1:35:26] to judge his judgment he could
[1:35:30] couldn't send a man to hell and be
[1:35:33] just he's kind true honest
[1:35:36] he's a great judge he wouldn't work
[1:35:39] against him himself
[1:35:43] so he had to put a man out there
[1:35:47] and make him a free moral agency knowing
[1:35:51] would fall and the man in his
[1:35:54] own image how could he
[1:35:58] fall
[1:36:01] he couldn't fall
[1:36:05] so calm's made in his image and god
[1:36:08] can't work against
[1:36:09] himself so
[1:36:13] he come back here he couldn't work
[1:36:15] against him
[1:36:18] in his own image he couldn't fall now
[1:36:21] are you seeing
[1:36:22] daylight so he made
[1:36:26] a bi product
[1:36:31] something out of the original creation
[1:36:35] now you see it there you come see
[1:36:39] then that's what fell he made it
[1:36:42] knowing it would fall
[1:36:46] can he put it over into the hands of
[1:36:49] satan
[1:36:50] for a vessel of dishonor
[1:36:53] where honor bestowed today
[1:36:57] think of that
[1:37:02] so we we realize now
[1:37:05] that he he
[1:37:08] created her knowing she would
[1:37:12] fall didn't create her to fall
[1:37:15] or make her fall can you understand
[1:37:18] so he put her on he put him on a free
[1:37:21] moral agency
[1:37:23] knowing that she would but remember
[1:37:28] well you know we
[1:37:31] before we were sinners
[1:37:34] he died for us he already had a
[1:37:36] provision
[1:37:38] he already had an attribute
[1:37:43] you understand that was going to take
[1:37:45] care of it so
[1:37:48] he couldn't let you fall he couldn't let
[1:37:51] you sin
[1:37:52] then judge you for it so what happens he
[1:37:55] says i've got i've got these attributes
[1:37:57] i've got to display them
[1:38:02] right so adam won't fall
[1:38:08] because adam's an expression of me
[1:38:13] so there's no way there's no sin in god
[1:38:16] there's no one belief in god but god
[1:38:19] wanted to be what worshipped
[1:38:22] he wanted to be worshipped for being a
[1:38:25] savior
[1:38:26] he wanted to be worshiped for being a
[1:38:29] healer
[1:38:30] he wanted to be worshipped for being a
[1:38:32] deliverer
[1:38:34] he wanted a fellowship he wanted to show
[1:38:36] you his attributes
[1:38:38] he said well that ain't fair that's why
[1:38:40] he put your name on the lamb's book of
[1:38:42] life
[1:38:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:48] he said can you see this name it's on
[1:38:51] the book
[1:38:52] nothing can take it off nothing can put
[1:38:54] it on
[1:38:55] now i can take this person i can send
[1:38:58] them through my redemption plan
[1:39:01] until i can allow them to go this whole
[1:39:03] route that i can display my attributes
[1:39:06] but i've already got their end
[1:39:10] written if you had eternal life you
[1:39:13] always had eternal life
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:21] this is the mystery
[1:39:26] of marriage and divorce
[1:39:30] it isn't we'll move to that
[1:39:35] it isn't i can do everything now
[1:39:38] because i'm that's a good evidence it's
[1:39:42] not there
[1:39:49] now so we understand he says
[1:39:54] he says oh don't you see it now
[1:39:58] in this view here the perversion
[1:40:01] of the church
[1:40:05] we'll just leave that
[1:40:09] there
[1:40:16] your brother brown just throws things in
[1:40:18] there you know and
[1:40:20] you just you know you're just trying to
[1:40:23] grasp eve
[1:40:24] and then he takes it all the way to the
[1:40:27] perverted church
[1:40:29] and uh you knew he carried a lot of
[1:40:32] vision
[1:40:33] and a lot of truth he said
[1:40:36] he said the perversion of church
[1:40:39] the original is god's word
[1:40:43] there's no sin in god
[1:40:48] you see what i mean here's a
[1:40:51] creature that come into existence
[1:40:55] by perversion god's
[1:40:58] going to have a church but look at this
[1:41:02] perverted thing they've got out here god
[1:41:06] has male and female
[1:41:10] but this woman see the very s
[1:41:14] symptoms of it shows back to what god
[1:41:17] had in mind
[1:41:19] it would take an hour or two
[1:41:22] to break it down to make this
[1:41:26] creature this creature
[1:41:29] for that way he made the creature and
[1:41:32] turned her so satan could get a hold of
[1:41:37] her
[1:41:38] and he did he still got her
[1:41:41] he's better flee to the cross
[1:41:46] now not to dwell on that
[1:41:49] side of it okay but to to
[1:41:52] to go to the understanding now
[1:41:56] of what the mystery really is
[1:41:59] of marriage and divorce and
[1:42:02] and to understand her position
[1:42:06] you've got to go back to the original
[1:42:09] creation
[1:42:11] and understand how that he made every
[1:42:14] other female in creation
[1:42:19] okay no other
[1:42:22] female in creation they they
[1:42:27] they mate with the mail
[1:42:30] for one purpose only and that's to
[1:42:34] replenish
[1:42:37] their species
[1:42:40] okay so another if we're going to look
[1:42:44] get a revelation of the beginning we've
[1:42:47] got to go back
[1:42:48] and understand how he created
[1:42:51] every other uh every other female
[1:42:56] and if we could look at every under
[1:42:58] female and understand he created
[1:43:00] that god he can't to break that pattern
[1:43:05] so in order to understand her
[1:43:08] purpose
[1:43:12] okay her purpose wasn't to produce
[1:43:18] species
[1:43:22] or the human species
[1:43:27] every other female was
[1:43:31] one male right
[1:43:35] multiple females but with one male
[1:43:40] that was the order of
[1:43:43] nature that's how he created them
[1:43:46] when it was time to to to produce
[1:43:51] offspring they they had
[1:43:54] an order that they produced offspring
[1:44:00] but in order to put
[1:44:03] a revelation and an understanding
[1:44:07] of what god was trying to come to
[1:44:12] he allowed eve
[1:44:15] to break that pattern
[1:44:18] so by breaking the pattern i don't know
[1:44:21] if i can express this
[1:44:23] but by breaking the pattern
[1:44:26] he revealed the pattern
[1:44:32] you understand if i had a if this was
[1:44:34] just nothing but a
[1:44:36] a great big black sheet up here you
[1:44:39] wouldn't know what it was
[1:44:40] but the minute i threw a white spot on
[1:44:43] it
[1:44:43] you it would all of a sudden become oh
[1:44:48] now i can see it so he allowed
[1:44:52] this eve
[1:44:56] when he took the byproduct he knew
[1:45:00] that she now was created for deception
[1:45:04] and he was going to give her over to
[1:45:07] satan
[1:45:08] to be her designer
[1:45:14] and he still is today
[1:45:17] he he designs her
[1:45:20] doesn't he i mean he designs her with uh
[1:45:23] with uh the the clothes that
[1:45:27] he makes for the uh
[1:45:30] the styles you you know what i mean
[1:45:35] uh you know you walk into a grocery
[1:45:38] store you walk someplace and they'll
[1:45:40] have a book there
[1:45:41] the new woman the modern woman
[1:45:46] you know today's woman
[1:45:54] what's he doing he's designing her
[1:45:58] he's designing her thinking he's
[1:46:01] designing
[1:46:01] the way she presents herself
[1:46:06] you know where does she get the idea
[1:46:09] that her clothes have got to be so tight
[1:46:13] where did she get the idea that somehow
[1:46:16] her figure is something that
[1:46:19] she can use to accomplish things
[1:46:23] the prophet of god said it's deadly
[1:46:27] it brings more people to hell than all
[1:46:29] the bootleg joint
[1:46:32] they're obsessed with it
[1:46:38] shape this health magazine that health
[1:46:41] magazine
[1:46:42] eat this do that you know your skin will
[1:46:45] be crystal clear it'll be tight as a
[1:46:47] prune no
[1:46:48] that's not what i meant
[1:46:52] tight is a plum
[1:46:57] no the truth of the matter is it is a
[1:47:01] prune the older you get
[1:47:05] the drier you get the more wrinkles you
[1:47:07] get
[1:47:08] and just because they have face putty
[1:47:11] that you can fill in all the cracks
[1:47:14] don't mean the wrinkles aren't there
[1:47:19] praise god for wrinkles
[1:47:25] i'm trying to let just lay something in
[1:47:28] here
[1:47:30] satan became her designer
[1:47:36] and god was allowing that because he was
[1:47:38] unfolding a great
[1:47:40] mystery and so
[1:47:44] when when let's go back to the original
[1:47:49] so here's adam and eve he makes eve he's
[1:47:52] co-equal
[1:47:53] now what happens is and we understand
[1:47:56] that
[1:47:57] that now in the original
[1:48:00] sin there is the introduction
[1:48:04] of another husband
[1:48:08] okay so eve
[1:48:12] divorces
[1:48:15] the covenant she had with adam
[1:48:21] now do not get caught up in looking at
[1:48:24] your own circumstances
[1:48:27] you will devour yourself why don't you
[1:48:32] have to look at your own circumstances
[1:48:37] [Music]
[1:48:40] he knew well you were yet a sinner he
[1:48:42] died for you
[1:48:43] he died for you in your unbelief
[1:48:47] now there's an introduction of
[1:48:51] another husband now this husband becomes
[1:48:55] her
[1:48:56] designer is that right he says
[1:49:00] so it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:49:05] so he says now after the original
[1:49:08] beginning is over jesus said it wasn't
[1:49:13] so from the beginning
[1:49:15] that's when time began
[1:49:18] when god make it first
[1:49:22] in the original creation all understand
[1:49:25] that
[1:49:26] so when when
[1:49:29] eve broke that covenant
[1:49:33] and took sin a new covenant
[1:49:38] was put into effect and that's where
[1:49:41] time began now that's just
[1:49:44] one of the mysteries that's thrown out
[1:49:47] here
[1:49:48] in marriage and divorce now we may be
[1:49:50] able to
[1:49:51] go into that but said if she would have
[1:49:54] stayed
[1:49:55] in the original condition she would have
[1:49:59] never
[1:50:00] been there would have never been no fall
[1:50:03] but because of the fall in the
[1:50:06] interruption
[1:50:08] that broke the whole continuity of god
[1:50:12] and throw death sorrow and everything
[1:50:15] else on earth
[1:50:16] she was made thus
[1:50:24] wow
[1:50:30] in the original continuity there wasn't
[1:50:32] even time
[1:50:34] time began at the fall
[1:50:37] right there that's where time began
[1:50:41] so just to jump out here
[1:50:44] why do you think in the breach
[1:50:48] that he says there will be time no more
[1:50:56] we won't go there
[1:51:00] we don't have enough time
[1:51:04] now notice after the beginning
[1:51:07] after the beginning after time began
[1:51:11] because but back in
[1:51:14] that was eternity
[1:51:18] what god originally had it was over
[1:51:21] notice after the fall was made by eve
[1:51:25] after the fall there was need
[1:51:28] for to be another covenant
[1:51:32] made now this is going to stumble you
[1:51:36] but i'm going to give you the scriptures
[1:51:38] to prove
[1:51:39] that this is the truth
[1:51:43] okay now we're not going to go through
[1:51:45] all those scriptures but i want to read
[1:51:47] this
[1:51:48] god now secondarily set
[1:51:52] a new nature again by
[1:51:56] sex
[1:52:01] okay we're just leading to something so
[1:52:04] there they were co-equal everything's
[1:52:07] perfect
[1:52:08] it's interrupted the minute upper
[1:52:12] they're interrupted time began
[1:52:15] where did the interruption come from it
[1:52:18] came
[1:52:18] from the introduction of another
[1:52:22] husband
[1:52:28] okay now because of that eve's covenant
[1:52:32] changed
[1:52:33] you're to serve you're to bear children
[1:52:37] there's a new covenant place there
[1:52:42] so now now she's under
[1:52:45] this covenant the god created the first
[1:52:49] without sex you believe that
[1:52:53] now there's another covenant with nature
[1:52:57] he said it in another order
[1:53:01] bisex second covenant one male many
[1:53:05] females
[1:53:06] one buck deer
[1:53:09] a whole harlem of does you see that's
[1:53:12] right but one bull
[1:53:14] heard of cattle cows one rooster a yard
[1:53:17] of hands
[1:53:18] right david after his own heart with 500
[1:53:21] wives
[1:53:23] and one of a different woman after man
[1:53:26] god's own heart solomon and on he begins
[1:53:30] to
[1:53:31] he begins the covenant has changed
[1:53:36] okay we're not going to go into all that
[1:53:38] because
[1:53:40] there's some people that read that and
[1:53:43] my goodness they become polygamists
[1:53:52] you know i mean all of a sudden they all
[1:53:54] become david's
[1:53:55] and they all be kind of solomon's
[1:53:59] you know and they and they
[1:54:02] they they start justifying their actions
[1:54:06] just to find their actions god said so
[1:54:09] let me tell you
[1:54:10] that's all the further they read in the
[1:54:12] book
[1:54:14] they found something they like and
[1:54:17] and they latch onto it now we know
[1:54:21] there's many polygamy
[1:54:22] polygamist uh cultures and
[1:54:25] many polygamous things but
[1:54:29] that's uh and it it breeds
[1:54:33] all the problems that come with that
[1:54:36] but all those problems come from what
[1:54:39] the original sin that the original
[1:54:43] covenant was broke so command breaks the
[1:54:47] covenant
[1:54:49] comes into an imperfect covenant
[1:54:52] that's causing all kinds of problems now
[1:54:55] is trying to fix it
[1:54:58] the only way to fix it is what return
[1:55:01] back to the original
[1:55:11] now you're starting to get a picture for
[1:55:13] what this message is
[1:55:17] how many times did you hear the
[1:55:18] messenger say back to the original
[1:55:21] back to the beginning back to eden
[1:55:25] back to the word
[1:55:30] it ain't trying to fix the mess we're in
[1:55:33] it's trying to get us
[1:55:34] out of the mess we're in nobody
[1:55:38] you understand you may not be in a
[1:55:41] marriage in divorce situation
[1:55:43] but you're in some situation
[1:55:51] because we've all sinned and come short
[1:55:55] of the glory of god and so
[1:55:58] we we understood this how that
[1:56:03] it began and and how that
[1:56:06] uh this three and that's what he told
[1:56:09] her
[1:56:10] don't partake of that fruit
[1:56:14] right because the day that you eat of
[1:56:16] that fruit
[1:56:17] is the day that you die
[1:56:22] so let's just follow this down
[1:56:25] and again prophet of god emphasizes this
[1:56:29] he says but now that the seven seals are
[1:56:33] open the spirit of truth directs us
[1:56:36] to the word that explains
[1:56:40] why all the mistakes has
[1:56:44] been down through the ages because the
[1:56:47] seals
[1:56:48] was not open this was not revealed
[1:56:51] it's true he's saying this is why all
[1:56:55] the mistakes
[1:56:56] were made that's why men didn't marry
[1:56:59] the first one in the first place
[1:57:01] that's why she looked at him and said
[1:57:03] how did i marry this mom
[1:57:08] what was wrong with me you know what was
[1:57:12] wrong with us all
[1:57:13] we were living in sin
[1:57:16] amen
[1:57:22] we were out of the what original
[1:57:25] covenant
[1:57:28] you meet somebody and and and
[1:57:31] who are you affected by you think you're
[1:57:35] affected by her no you're affected by
[1:57:37] her
[1:57:38] designer
[1:57:44] he had not designed to make her a
[1:57:46] deceiver
[1:57:49] why do you think you pray through why do
[1:57:52] you pray tell you get an answer
[1:57:54] why when you go to pray do you have to
[1:57:57] fight
[1:57:58] against all the reasoning that goes on
[1:58:02] your mind
[1:58:03] why i'm going to marry her why i can go
[1:58:05] and get married well i'm gonna go find a
[1:58:07] guy
[1:58:08] you go through all the reasoning all the
[1:58:10] fighting all the thinking in your mind
[1:58:12] but she's so pretty she's so nice you
[1:58:15] know i mean
[1:58:16] everybody will think i really scored
[1:58:25] they'll realize i'm not so ugly
[1:58:33] because what he said it's the reason
[1:58:39] what what do we all go through we go
[1:58:41] through the whole reasoning
[1:58:43] process right back to what took place
[1:58:47] in the beginning we reason
[1:58:50] and we reason and we reason and we
[1:58:54] reason
[1:58:55] what was the thing that he used
[1:58:58] to deceive us in the first place
[1:59:01] reasoning
[1:59:02] reasoning what do you think
[1:59:05] every marriage and divorce problem
[1:59:09] is built on
[1:59:12] what is every sin bill time
[1:59:16] what is every problem we ever get
[1:59:19] ourselves into
[1:59:20] based on reasoning if we would take
[1:59:24] the word we'd be safe
[1:59:36] he said he said again let me say he says
[1:59:41] now that
[1:59:41] is the truth a true woman virgin that
[1:59:45] marries her husband and lives
[1:59:47] and she's a blessed thing to the man
[1:59:51] if god could give his son anything
[1:59:53] better than a wife
[1:59:56] he would have given that to him
[1:59:59] but she's designed to be a sextac
[2:00:03] and no other animal is designed like
[2:00:06] that
[2:00:07] no other creature on earth is designed
[2:00:09] like that
[2:00:10] that's the reason you see polygamy
[2:00:13] because of that that's what brought
[2:00:16] it in
[2:00:20] that's why it doesn't fit in this
[2:00:24] bright age and it doesn't
[2:00:27] fit into this message because this
[2:00:31] message is returning us back to
[2:00:33] something
[2:00:38] now look in the final analysis
[2:00:42] look there is one jesus christ is that
[2:00:46] right
[2:00:47] one man god emanuel do you believe that
[2:00:51] but the many but the numbers
[2:00:55] of his wife are many thousands times
[2:00:59] thousands is that right his wife
[2:01:02] the bride the church you understand now
[2:01:06] that's why he said to adam
[2:01:09] before sex was introduced
[2:01:13] or introduced multiply and replenish
[2:01:16] the earth
[2:01:21] now we've just
[2:01:24] got to the whole mystery
[2:01:30] of marriage and divorce
[2:01:38] it was the what
[2:01:41] before there was even any way he told
[2:01:44] replenish the earth right
[2:01:48] when he was yet in the
[2:01:51] beginning he was yet
[2:01:55] both male and female
[2:01:59] in himself
[2:02:03] i i just wanted to let you know i can
[2:02:05] trump too
[2:02:08] [Music]
[2:02:14] there it shows then that the bride's got
[2:02:18] to come from
[2:02:21] the world by
[2:02:25] spiritual multiplication
[2:02:28] you see the replenishing
[2:02:32] the earth the law
[2:02:38] was in adam when he was both male and
[2:02:40] female
[2:02:41] why it be he knew it was going to fall
[2:02:44] but he wanted to understand and get the
[2:02:47] revelation
[2:02:48] that it was a spiritual replenishing
[2:02:54] i know that's probably pretty hard to
[2:02:59] get your minds wrapped around but do you
[2:03:02] want to know
[2:03:03] it's got to be sowed
[2:03:06] it's got to be it's got to be out there
[2:03:11] the commandment was put in the
[2:03:15] beginning is that right
[2:03:19] adam replenish the earth
[2:03:22] he's got both male and female in him
[2:03:27] so it was going to be a spiritual
[2:03:30] replenishing but because we're so carnal
[2:03:35] we can't figure that out
[2:03:40] don't try
[2:03:47] it but that's what it was going to be
[2:03:50] so the commandment you understand that
[2:03:53] let's
[2:03:53] lay that real solid the commandment was
[2:03:56] given
[2:03:58] when in the beginning when he was
[2:04:02] still both male and female
[2:04:06] because it was going to be a what
[2:04:09] spiritual
[2:04:11] replenishing that's why
[2:04:14] when the second adam came
[2:04:18] adam was a living soul jesus
[2:04:21] was a quickening spirit
[2:04:25] [Applause]
[2:04:27] because it was going to be a spiritual
[2:04:30] replenishment
[2:04:31] [Applause]
[2:04:34] that's why you don't get this body back
[2:04:38] because if you've got this body back it
[2:04:40] would die again
[2:04:43] this body's not going to be raised up we
[2:04:46] have
[2:04:46] one waiting for it but the replenishing
[2:04:51] had to come by a spiritual
[2:04:54] union
[2:05:02] the one head
[2:05:06] and the many-membered body
[2:05:13] he was laying it out
[2:05:19] in the expression of his attributes
[2:05:23] that man was going to fall
[2:05:27] he was going to get involved in all
[2:05:28] these things
[2:05:30] he was going to come up with marriage
[2:05:32] and divorce
[2:05:35] because he didn't understand the true
[2:05:38] revelation it was failed they there was
[2:05:41] now a covenant
[2:05:43] of that man that was driven by
[2:05:46] by the the fact that she was made for
[2:05:50] this act
[2:05:55] and the very original sin
[2:05:58] and and the drive of that act
[2:06:02] and the pursuit of that act
[2:06:05] which was the sin
[2:06:09] original sin that entered into the
[2:06:11] garden
[2:06:14] has been the cause
[2:06:18] of murder
[2:06:21] death crime everything
[2:06:29] i hope i said that as gentlemanly
[2:06:33] as i could does not need to be gone into
[2:06:37] detail
[2:06:41] on both sides of the fence
[2:06:49] spiritual multiplication see replenish
[2:06:52] the earth
[2:06:54] now in the second set see the schools
[2:06:57] got those two
[2:06:59] things mixed up
[2:07:04] you see why they have all the problems
[2:07:07] they're trying to
[2:07:10] fix
[2:07:12] fix the the broken thing
[2:07:15] with broken answers
[2:07:22] first of all comes justification
[2:07:26] well i had a right i had a right i had a
[2:07:29] right
[2:07:30] the covenant changes right she was
[2:07:34] made for man
[2:07:37] when the other husband was introduced
[2:07:41] that's when marriage and divorce was
[2:07:44] introduced
[2:07:46] right there eve now had
[2:07:49] two what two husbands
[2:07:58] now you know why god said you can't be
[2:08:02] married you can't have two
[2:08:06] husbands he was
[2:08:10] he was laying that
[2:08:14] out there
[2:08:17] because what what
[2:08:20] happens he's pointing this out
[2:08:24] what so eve had two husbands
[2:08:29] each husband uh
[2:08:34] each each husband had a seed that
[2:08:37] produced
[2:08:37] fruit
[2:08:42] you know how brother brandon be
[2:08:43] preaching and all of a sudden he'll just
[2:08:45] shake his head
[2:08:46] and look and he says don't you see
[2:08:48] serpent seed
[2:08:50] can't you see serpent seed now
[2:08:54] amen they they they
[2:08:57] they produced so eve had two husbands
[2:09:00] right
[2:09:00] and they produced two different kinds of
[2:09:03] what
[2:09:04] fruit
[2:09:08] is that true a cane and an
[2:09:11] abel and they're not what
[2:09:15] they're not compatible
[2:09:19] they're not compatible they couldn't
[2:09:22] live together
[2:09:23] so one wants to what smoke the other
[2:09:28] the flesh wars against the spirit
[2:09:31] and the spirit against the flesh is that
[2:09:34] right
[2:09:36] i mean if if you were to take galatians
[2:09:39] just turn with me galatians 5 and it
[2:09:43] says
[2:09:43] this 5 16
[2:09:46] this i say then walk in the spirit
[2:09:50] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[2:09:52] flesh
[2:09:59] for the lust of the flesh for the flesh
[2:10:02] lusteth against the spirit
[2:10:05] and the spirit against the flesh and
[2:10:08] these two
[2:10:09] are contrary the one to the other
[2:10:13] so that they cannot do those things that
[2:10:17] they would
[2:10:24] now do you understand
[2:10:28] really what we're talking about
[2:10:31] when we talk about divorce
[2:10:35] the prophet of god it's not divorce
[2:10:39] there's only one way of divorce that's
[2:10:42] death
[2:10:43] that husband must die
[2:10:48] can you understand the mystery is in the
[2:10:50] type of christ
[2:10:52] it isn't trying to build a new carnal
[2:10:56] religious system trying to bring us back
[2:10:59] to the original
[2:11:03] so he said as long as that a woman she
[2:11:06] cannot marry
[2:11:08] as long as that husband lives
[2:11:15] why that husband
[2:11:18] produces seed
[2:11:22] and the seed produces fruit
[2:11:27] and we know
[2:11:31] you understand what we're talking about
[2:11:32] right
[2:11:34] he said okay and can't that they would
[2:11:37] do
[2:11:38] but if we be led of the spirit you are
[2:11:41] not under the law for the works of the
[2:11:43] flesh
[2:11:44] are manifested in these these
[2:11:48] are the fruits of the first
[2:11:52] husband that brought
[2:11:55] flesh into the world
[2:12:03] god knew it would happen
[2:12:07] but these are going to be the fruits
[2:12:11] this is what man has lived under
[2:12:17] until this husband dies
[2:12:21] adultery fornication
[2:12:26] uncleanliness lavishness
[2:12:32] idolatry one was adultery
[2:12:35] the other one's idolatry witchcraft
[2:12:39] hatred variances emulations
[2:12:43] wrath strife seductions
[2:12:47] heresies envies
[2:12:50] murderers drunkenness reveling
[2:12:54] and such like of which i tell you before
[2:12:58] and also have told you in the past that
[2:13:01] they
[2:13:02] which do such things shall not inherit
[2:13:05] the kingdom of god
[2:13:07] why that husband is still alive
[2:13:13] he's still producing fruit and you're
[2:13:17] in a marriage of the second
[2:13:20] covenant
[2:13:24] amen
[2:13:28] well but
[2:13:32] what are the fruits
[2:13:36] of the other
[2:13:42] let's say in this case husband
[2:13:46] if she wouldn't have broke that covenant
[2:13:49] in the beginning
[2:13:51] none of the things that we read would
[2:13:54] have
[2:13:54] ever entered in to our lives
[2:13:58] people hate one another because of their
[2:14:00] skin color
[2:14:01] they hate one another because of their
[2:14:03] race they hate one another because of
[2:14:05] the languages they speak
[2:14:07] the foods they eat the cultures they
[2:14:09] come from
[2:14:13] you know what because that's the fruit
[2:14:16] of their husband
[2:14:20] that's what that marriage produces
[2:14:25] it produces sickness greatest battle
[2:14:28] ever fought it produces sickness
[2:14:31] his his marriage is war destruction
[2:14:36] all these things
[2:14:39] way back god showing
[2:14:45] that he had a husband
[2:14:48] that he wanted his bride
[2:14:52] to marry and the fruits of
[2:14:55] the but the fruits of the spirit is
[2:14:58] love joy peace
[2:15:02] longsuffering gentleness goodness
[2:15:06] faith meekness temperance against such
[2:15:09] there are no rules
[2:15:15] in other words let me say it this way
[2:15:19] there's no harm
[2:15:23] because law is to govern your
[2:15:26] actions that cause harm
[2:15:34] law enforcement is spoke to be there to
[2:15:37] stop
[2:15:38] harm and that's why he said they're
[2:15:42] ministers
[2:15:44] of god sent to carry out the wrath of
[2:15:48] god
[2:15:49] that breaks the law
[2:15:56] let me tell you it's time we make sure
[2:15:59] we're married to our husband
[2:16:04] because god is fixing to divorce
[2:16:08] this whole thing as soon as he gets her
[2:16:12] married
[2:16:15] as soon as she breaks that vow
[2:16:18] to that other husband that she got from
[2:16:21] birth
[2:16:22] and lets him die and he resurrects in
[2:16:25] her
[2:16:26] in an invisible union of the heavenly
[2:16:29] bridegroom
[2:16:30] and the earthly bride and she gets
[2:16:33] remarried
[2:16:38] can he replenishes
[2:16:41] the earth with the bride that he's
[2:16:45] redeemed
[2:16:46] through the ages so when he goes back to
[2:16:50] that eden
[2:16:51] he goes back in there with eve
[2:16:54] replenished
[2:16:56] [Applause]
[2:16:58] hallelujah
[2:17:02] the spiritual replenishing took place
[2:17:06] in the second adam because he was a
[2:17:08] quickening spirit
[2:17:20] the law was when he was yet
[2:17:23] male and female
[2:17:29] how many times do you hear brother
[2:17:31] branham say you were a part of him when
[2:17:35] in the beginning when he went to calvary
[2:17:38] you were there with him you were with
[2:17:41] him when he was a living soul
[2:17:43] you were with him when he's a quickly
[2:17:45] spirit you understand the revelation of
[2:17:48] marriage and divorce
[2:17:50] is the is the replenishing of the earth
[2:17:57] by a spiritual union which would have
[2:18:00] been exactly
[2:18:02] what took place in adam and eve
[2:18:06] or in adam when he was yet male and
[2:18:10] female
[2:18:13] oh maybe i simplified maybe i had to
[2:18:17] figure out a way to make it sound
[2:18:19] more deep and more complicated
[2:18:25] you know maybe according to like
[2:18:27] ecclesiastics 102.5
[2:18:35] it and you you
[2:18:38] see these things so now you understand
[2:18:43] that that's why he said
[2:18:47] that he can divorce but she can't
[2:18:55] now that is
[2:18:59] because he's the one that quickens
[2:19:05] you understand he's the one that
[2:19:07] replenishes
[2:19:09] so if she doesn't want to take his word
[2:19:12] seed
[2:19:13] he can divorce her but she can't live
[2:19:16] without him it never was a carnal thing
[2:19:22] that he can and she can't brother ben
[2:19:26] makes that statement i'll just read it
[2:19:28] to you so you can understand
[2:19:31] he said solomon can marry
[2:19:34] any woman that wasn't married he could
[2:19:37] marry any woman
[2:19:39] he wanted to the priest could marry only
[2:19:42] a woman
[2:19:43] that was a virgin solomon david they
[2:19:46] married
[2:19:48] what was her name abigail
[2:19:52] which was a man
[2:19:56] which was a man called a fool
[2:20:00] he had a nice wife and he died and
[2:20:02] abigail
[2:20:03] was married to david he was king
[2:20:06] not priest so he married but the
[2:20:10] a priest could not do that because
[2:20:13] he touched or got a woman
[2:20:16] to be his wife that had already been
[2:20:19] with some other
[2:20:21] than some other man's wife so
[2:20:24] that shows the
[2:20:30] vergency of the church of the lord
[2:20:34] jesus christ the bride will have to be
[2:20:39] unadulterated the word
[2:20:42] not one word missing nowhere
[2:20:46] certainly could you imagine a
[2:20:49] correct bride and i know this is
[2:20:51] straight but he's trying to get you to
[2:20:53] get it
[2:20:53] one breast off can the other something
[2:20:56] or other wrong you know
[2:20:58] that not going to be the bride of christ
[2:21:02] she's perfect she's everything
[2:21:06] the word not one word
[2:21:09] failing anywhere
[2:21:13] now i i'm sorry i got to address these
[2:21:15] things
[2:21:16] but we get so carnal that maybe some
[2:21:20] good sister who's had a mastectomy or
[2:21:23] something
[2:21:24] reads the scripture and comes to pieces
[2:21:31] let's clean this thing up
[2:21:36] it's not about the flesh it's all
[2:21:40] leaving you're not taking none of it
[2:21:44] with you
[2:21:45] this is a spiritual
[2:21:49] replenishing
[2:21:53] notice he can put her away but she
[2:21:56] cannot put him away
[2:21:59] he did it and proved it in the days of
[2:22:03] luther wesley in pentecost
[2:22:07] in other words when she wouldn't take
[2:22:10] the word seed he divorced her
[2:22:20] she wouldn't let the first husband
[2:22:25] die she tried to have
[2:22:28] two husbands him and
[2:22:31] their doctrines their creeds
[2:22:34] their interpretations their style
[2:22:38] the way they wanted to dress the way
[2:22:40] they wanted to eat
[2:22:45] this is a long subject but at least
[2:22:47] we're done with it
[2:22:48] in pentecost and when they refuse to
[2:22:51] become the further
[2:22:52] part of him by having
[2:22:55] spiritual sexual affair to become
[2:22:58] pregnant with the further part of the
[2:23:01] word
[2:23:02] you understand she refused
[2:23:05] the lutheran church refused
[2:23:09] for christ to have any more desire
[2:23:12] with her luther refused it
[2:23:15] and let me say this going to call
[2:23:18] me something anyhow so it's today
[2:23:23] with every one of them they failed to
[2:23:25] take that word
[2:23:27] they refused christ and any woman that
[2:23:30] refuses a man his child
[2:23:32] has no right to be wife with him amen
[2:23:36] now a lot of men
[2:23:41] have taken that quote
[2:23:45] and say i can put you away but you can't
[2:23:48] put me away
[2:23:49] let me tell you something there's a
[2:23:52] whole
[2:23:52] lot of other word
[2:23:56] and law in a christian life
[2:24:00] that governs that
[2:24:05] how you take care of your wife what your
[2:24:08] obligation to her
[2:24:10] the vow you took
[2:24:14] you don't take a quote and do away
[2:24:17] with every christian principle a husband
[2:24:21] has
[2:24:22] because you're having some sort of
[2:24:24] mental or physical desire
[2:24:26] problem
[2:24:36] you don't think i'm gonna have a juniper
[2:24:40] tree
[2:24:48] there's a whole
[2:24:51] epistles peter
[2:24:55] all these things that tell a person
[2:24:58] what governs you before you ever
[2:25:01] would say i can put you away but you
[2:25:04] can't put me away
[2:25:06] i heard that preached from somebody for
[2:25:10] a long time and it finally i got so
[2:25:13] tired i love the man
[2:25:15] but that's all he'd preach on he can put
[2:25:18] her away
[2:25:19] she can't put him away
[2:25:26] well guess what
[2:25:29] he thought he had enough people
[2:25:31] convinced that he could get rid of his
[2:25:34] wife
[2:25:37] but he left all the other word
[2:25:40] out that governs a relationship
[2:25:44] how you treat one another how you pray
[2:25:46] for one another
[2:25:47] how you kneel down how you read the
[2:25:50] scriptures together
[2:25:51] how you keep your marriage together
[2:25:54] how there's gifts in the church to help
[2:26:00] this was never
[2:26:04] spoken to be put in a carnal
[2:26:08] frame
[2:26:14] because never spoken to being a carnal
[2:26:17] frame
[2:26:18] the marriage and divorce jesus was
[2:26:20] talking about
[2:26:21] was not the one they were involved in
[2:26:25] that's because they had a hard heart and
[2:26:28] couldn't receive the word
[2:26:30] so he gave him a writ of divorcement
[2:26:33] what do you think
[2:26:34] that writ was for you think it was for
[2:26:37] them
[2:26:38] it was for him he's the one
[2:26:43] that had the writ of divorcement
[2:26:49] because he was the only one
[2:26:52] that could marry
[2:26:56] he was the only husband
[2:27:00] of the bride amen so
[2:27:03] take a divorce anyone
[2:27:06] that laid claim to him
[2:27:09] that didn't bear his fruit
[2:27:16] i'm not talking about if if you've borne
[2:27:19] a child
[2:27:20] at a wedlock i'm not talking about you
[2:27:22] if you've married a woman that's had a
[2:27:24] child
[2:27:25] i'm not talking about you married aka a
[2:27:28] woman that had been married
[2:27:30] for more you'll never get that
[2:27:33] right
[2:27:38] so the prophet in a perfect type of
[2:27:41] christ
[2:27:42] forgave everybody
[2:27:44] [Music]
[2:27:46] because it's all going to be forgiven
[2:27:49] anyway because your names are on the
[2:27:53] lamb's book of life
[2:27:55] in the beginning
[2:28:00] and so i say this
[2:28:04] in closing
[2:28:09] the plan was to have in the beginning
[2:28:15] a word spiritual
[2:28:18] reproduction
[2:28:23] god was not going to have it carnal
[2:28:28] okay he allowed eve to be created to be
[2:28:32] deceived
[2:28:34] so he could draw a law of contrast
[2:28:40] so his spirit could find
[2:28:43] his bride and then the real
[2:28:48] adam the second adam
[2:28:53] quickening spirit the one that was the
[2:28:56] word
[2:28:57] in the beginning that created the first
[2:29:01] adam
[2:29:02] could come and marry
[2:29:06] his bride
[2:29:10] that's marriage in divorce
[2:29:15] in a nutshell
[2:29:19] excuse that expression
[2:29:23] but we're not going to fix
[2:29:27] a carnal life that's going to be done
[2:29:31] away with anyway
[2:29:33] we're not taking any of those
[2:29:35] circumstances
[2:29:37] in situations
[2:29:41] amen if a person had a right
[2:29:44] to divorce that's between them and god
[2:29:49] if god chooses to marry them and that
[2:29:52] husband's tied
[2:29:54] that situation dies
[2:29:58] i don't know i can't say
[2:30:02] but i know one thing that he said that
[2:30:06] a woman couldn't have two husbands
[2:30:08] because god
[2:30:09] can't break his type
[2:30:13] and the natural types the spiritual
[2:30:16] and so we can't change
[2:30:20] what things are
[2:30:23] but what he said don't do it
[2:30:27] again don't go
[2:30:30] out there and create a new
[2:30:33] situation
[2:30:38] that you've got to somehow justify
[2:30:45] that's the best i can do
[2:30:50] if you plea your plead your case with me
[2:30:54] you're playing it with the human right
[2:30:58] i don't know the beginning from the end
[2:31:03] i only know my end by promise
[2:31:10] i trust my beginning
[2:31:14] of time
[2:31:19] is under the blood but my beginning
[2:31:23] in eternity was in this union
[2:31:28] with christ jesus from the beginning
[2:31:32] i've just got to have that other husband
[2:31:36] die god bless you
[2:31:40] this morning musicians could come
[2:31:43] [Applause]
[2:31:53] maybe a some interpreter could go help
[2:31:55] billy

[2:52:38] and i think she'll just give a
[2:52:41] opportunity to testify is it up on the
[2:52:44] screen
[2:52:45] or maybe not testify of
[2:52:49] how that god brought here here
[2:52:52] so if you can't see i guess you can all
[2:52:56] stand up whatever you want to do
[2:52:57] but anyway sister sharon come on tell
[2:52:59] you there's a mic right here so just
[2:53:02] talk
[2:53:02] nicely um praise the lord
[2:53:07] i want to thank everyone especially the
[2:53:09] pastor
[2:53:10] i was here last time it was my first
[2:53:12] time to hear well
[2:53:13] my dad is a believer he always speak to
[2:53:16] me about the bible and everything
[2:53:20] the reason why i wanted to be baptized
[2:53:22] today is because i was a christian but
[2:53:24] not a true christian
[2:53:27] i never really prayed or read the bible
[2:53:31] i was just in the middle i didn't know
[2:53:34] where i was
[2:53:35] you know so then when i was here last
[2:53:39] sunday
[2:53:40] passed the preaching the word really
[2:53:42] touched me
[2:53:43] and i decided that i would i wanted to
[2:53:46] accept god as my savior
[2:53:52] [Applause]
[2:53:58] so this scripture certainly applies to
[2:54:01] our
[2:54:02] sister hearing the gospel now when they
[2:54:05] heard this
[2:54:07] they were pricked in their heart and
[2:54:09] said unto peter and the rest of the
[2:54:11] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[2:54:13] do
[2:54:15] then peter said unto them repent and be
[2:54:18] baptized
[2:54:19] every one of you in the name of jesus
[2:54:22] christ
[2:54:22] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[2:54:26] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[2:54:29] for the promises unto you and your
[2:54:32] children
[2:54:33] and to all that are afar off
[2:54:36] even as many as the lord our god shall
[2:54:39] call
[2:54:40] and with many other words did he testify
[2:54:43] and exhort saying
[2:54:45] save yourselves from this up towards
[2:54:48] generation and certainly our sister has
[2:54:50] heard the cry
[2:54:52] and wants to do what god has for her to
[2:54:55] do
[2:54:56] amen amen our sister
