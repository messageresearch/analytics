Description:
Death By A Thousand Cuts
Br. Jeremy Shreiner
Wednesday Evening Service 
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 7th, 2026
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Heavenly Father, Lord, we do rejoice in the praise report and Lord, in the your goodness to us, Father, it's how we come before you is recognizing who you are, that you've bid us to come, Lord, that in your hand is the answer to all things. And father, as the [music] praise report was read and it was mentioned that they had taken him off the life support, Father, how many times the end of that story is a tragedy, Lord, that would mark something that was a direction that was too far to return from, Lord, but you intervened, Lord, and you gave him breath. And Lord, the first words he spoke was that you're good. And Lord, before the report comes, before there's anything given, you're still the same. Lord, you're good to us. Your mercies have been everlasting. You're the reason we're here now. And Lord, for the requests that were made, our brother Jeff, the concern, and Lord, the fear that there would be. And Lord, we could just imagine what it would be at that time. But Lord, if we could look to you, Lord, we would know that it's all going to be according to your plan and purpose. Father, we commit that to you and your mighty hand. And we ask that you be present with his neighbor. [music] Lord, two requests for neighbors. And Lord, brother Tommy's neighbor, a man who's old in age. And Lord, you told us to to look to our elderly and to care for them. And [music] Father, that's who you are. You care. We ask that you would just give him his portion. Father, be [music] be a strength, Lord. May he know you're near. And Lord, as he has not had fluids, Father, may you just refresh him. And I pray, Lord, as we're here tonight, Father, it's [music] because you bid us to come. Lord, we've gathered in your name in this house. And there's needs that are represented, maybe not spoken, maybe not even represented by uplifted hands, but Lord, I believe you're mindful of each need that's here. [music] Lord, you're going to come in your word and you're going to minister life to us. So Lord, we just want to prepare our hearts to receive from you. And we want to give you thanks now for all the [music] things that you're doing. We love you, Lord. commit it all to you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

[singing] Praise God. Praise [music] God. Praise God. Praise [music] God. Praise God. Praise [music] God. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just bow our heads together. Father, as we again come [music] before you this evening, we're thankful that we can gather together, Lord. We can come out, Father, of the just the busyiness of life and [music] take time, Lord, to to sit at your feet and to worship you and hear what [music] you have to say. Doesn't matter who's standing behind here, Father. And [music] Lord, whatever is said, Lord, we we want it to be direct from your word. We we want our hearts to be intent upon it, Father. And God, if there's correction, Lord, I want to accept it, Father. If there's joy, I want to accept it, Lord. I want everything that your word has for me, Lord. We pray because we know, Father, it's a deceptive hour that we're living in. But the beauty of it is, Lord, is you won't lose a one. &gt;&gt; And Father, we're so thankful [music] for the elect, Father, of this age. We're thankful to be able to stand here, Father, and stand before her. And God, we don't take it lightly. So, Father, we surrender our minds to you now and our thoughts and ask that you would just deal with your people in the only way that you know how [music] as we surrender everything now to your to your hand, Father, in Jesus name, we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love him, don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. While you're standing together, we'd like you to turn to 2 Chronicles. It's definitely good to be back here and to see some familiar faces. And uh I don't think anyone here I think every for the most part everyone kind of knows me is that I don't remember names very well but I I I remember brother Ben and the reason why is because I was at brother Davies just to say who is that brother that I know brother Ben. So good to have you here. Good. Hey I'm glad you're here. Familiar face brother Matt and I better stop calling names because I'm going to forget everyone that's that it's good to see you. And for those that have come to our neck of the woods, I I won't even call it woods, our neck of the the desert of the panhandle to support our meetings at times. We thank you for doing that. And it means a lot to our little assembly and for brother David and all that he's done here in the work in the Dallas Fort Worth area. We just thank God for that. How many can say, "Thank you, Lord." Amen. It takes a special person to be called to this area. I guarantee it. Amen. And it wasn't me. I was called to the back side of the desert and he was called to the land of many peoples. So, but God bless you, brother David, in your work here and all that's here to help him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a true. Yes, you have your testimony. Hey, we enjoyed your testimony. I I I when I seen you today, hey, I'm just getting comfortable. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; So, when I seen you, I was like, man, he's aged so much. And then I realized, oh, it's just because I watched his testimony, the one in in Canada. I was like, ah, that's what it was. Uh, and so that was like that's what it was. It was just uh, you know, YouTube does it to you. I don't know. Just get it. But our our church enjoyed the testimony again. And I say if you haven't heard it, listen to it again. Amen. All right. Now that everyone is either not calm or nervous, let's get into the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. 2 Chronicles chapter 36. We're going to begin reading uh at verse 15 and then we go to verse number 20. My I love that sound. The sound of pages being turned. Verse number 15. When you have it, say amen. And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers rising up times early and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place otherwise he desired to save them. Verse 16, very important. But they mocked the messengers of God and despised his words and misused his prophets until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people till there was no remedy or deliverance. Therefore, he brought upon them, notice, he brought upon them the king of the chales, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young men or maiden, old men, or him that stooped for age. He gave them all into his hand. and the all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes. All these he brought to Babylon, and they burnt the house of God, and break down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. Last verse. And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon, where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia. God bless you. You can have your seats. I know this is an interesting scripture to read and and I pray by the end of it that we'll be encouraged. is something that I could not get away from today very much wrestling in in what the Lord would have for you tonight. It is said here not that the king of the Chaldans went against them. Notice &gt;&gt; but that the Lord &gt;&gt; brought upon them the king of the Chaldans. It was God who did this because very important of their constant misuse of the ministry given to them. &gt;&gt; I want this to really sink in. I uh because we we deal with our humanity and we see the face of the ministry. We see the face of the prophet. We see uh you know many people uh quite often want to point out his faults, right? And they want to say well he you know I I get it. He was just a man, but he was still a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; And there is a five-fold ministry as well that are called of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, they are men, but they are still called of God. &gt;&gt; Verse 16, but they mocked the messengers of God and despised his words and misused his prophets until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people till there was no remedy. And I want to say that word again, deliverance. till there was no deliverance. We're going to take a thought this evening for a few moments entitled, you've heard this statement before, but death by a thousand cuts. Death by a thousand cuts. Luke 10:16, Jesus is speaking and he says, "He that heareth you heareth me, &gt;&gt; and he that despiseth you &gt;&gt; despiseth me, &gt;&gt; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. My word, what a powerful statement in one verse of scripture. &gt;&gt; Jesus is bringing this uh and I don't want to just push it to them, but I want to push it to now. &gt;&gt; Disrespect for the messenger is ultimately disrespect for the one who sent him. &gt;&gt; Now notice we can we can bring this and tie this in in the dealing with Samuel. When Israel demanded to be like everyone else, Israel demanded to have a king. They wanted to be like everyone else. and and there was this uneasiness. There was uh the prophet was very uh disturbed by this and he was taken almost if you would the responsibility. But notice 1st Samuel 8:6 and it said but the thing displeased Samuel and it should &gt;&gt; it should displease the prophet because it wasn't the perfect will of God. And when they give us a king to I'm going to start from the beginning again. But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of the people." I want you to understand, there's many times that God will actually tell the ministry, the pastor, to do something because of the people. Sure. &gt;&gt; And and you may not understand that and you may not, but because so many times people are led astray in their prayers by their desire of the heart. I'm trying not to get into that sermon, but I just spoke on this at home, but often times we use our heart, the feeling of our heart, the emotion of it, and because it feels right and we feel uh uh it feels good and it feels like the right thing and and we pray and we pray. But God has been answering through the ministry. He's been answering through the visiting ministers. As a pastor, I've seen that especially last year so many times that that we would uh the whole ministry in our church would be ministering something and then a visitor would come, brother David, and and and not know what was being spoken and would go right down the line uh uh dealing with the hearts of the people, you know, and I'm sitting over there as a pastor going, I didn't say nothing to them. BUT GOD WOULD IS ALWAYS trying to answer. But often times we as people are are are listening to our hearts instead of the word. &gt;&gt; And so here they are. Their desire was to be like everyone else. And but they were to be a separated people. And he said, "Harken unto the voice of the people and all that they say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. Notice another thought here says, ' And God said to Samuel, see they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from ruling over them. They did not want God to do it. Think about the the as it were prophecy that was given. I mean that this king is going to do this and he's going to do this. He's going to take your lands. He's going to take your money. He's going to take your family. He's going to do all of these things. And they said, "That's okay. &gt;&gt; That's all right." and prophet of God and Samaran church. He said how tragic that was. Little did they realize that when they were asking God to let them be like the rest of the world, they were rejecting him &gt;&gt; because God had ordained that his people act different from the world. &gt;&gt; That that's not being weird. &gt;&gt; That's not that's not just being legalistic, but you're to be different. There's a spirit of difference. There's a spirit in it. It's not just, hey, look at me. I I DRESS THIS WAY. I I NO, it's the attitude. It's the character &gt;&gt; of the word of God that is in our lives. So he said how bad it was. He says they are they are not of the world and don't look like the world and they don't act like the world. They are crucified unto the world and the world is crucified unto them. He said, you know, and he 2 Corinthians 6:17-18, he said, "Wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate, sayeth the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." Now, here's the very important part of this quote. I I mean, it's all important, but this is something I want to look to. He says, "You see, one difference between Israel and the rest of the nations was what? &gt;&gt; God." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I I want you to understand that the difference between us and everything else is God. &gt;&gt; What does he say? YOU PUT GOD TO ONE SIDE AND ISRAEL was like any other nation. &gt;&gt; If we take God OUT OF OUR CHURCH, WE'RE like any other church. We're like any other denomination. We remove his character. We become like anybody else. And then before you know it, it's church hurt this and church hurt that and and everyone's offended. But you keep the life in our homes and the life AND THE CHARACTER OF GOD IN OUR LIVES. WHAT CAN GOD DO? YOU SAY, "WELL, PEOPLE ARE ARE leaving and they're FALLING RIGHT AND LEFT." WE'VE BEEN TOLD THIS IS THE HOUR, BUT THERE IS A BRIDE THAT WILL STAY STANDING NO MATTER HOW HARD AND HOW difficult it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we got to keep God in our homes. We got to keep God in our church. We got to keep God in our worship. We got to keep God in the youth. Keep God in everything that's about it. When s Sam Samson cut off his hair, he was like any other man. You put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want that in my church. I don't want that in my home. I don't want that on my family name. Oh, I want my name to be Mrs. Jesus Christ. I I want my children to desire the things of God. I want my my church to desire the things of God. I get it. We can't make everybody happy, but we're not here TO MAKE OUR FLESH HAPPY. We're here to make sure THE PRESENCE OF GOD IS IN OUR MIDST AND THAT HE'S WALKING UP AND DOWN THE AISLES OF OUR HEARTS ON A SIMPLE WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN WE'RE TIRED AND WE'RE BROKEN AND BATTLECAR VETERANS. BUT JESUS IS HERE, the great physician. &gt;&gt; And I like it. You're here tonight. You're here on a Wednesday night. That means you want to be here. &gt;&gt; And God will do something for you. &gt;&gt; See, the world and the church are all of the same lump. Just like Jacob and Esau were of the same parents, but the spirit of God makes the difference. &gt;&gt; How many can say I want the spirit of God in my life? Even more says it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian. Anyone can do that. &gt;&gt; The point is whether or not you have the spirit of God in you. &gt;&gt; FOR WITHOUT THE SPIRIT, you are a repbate and you are none of his. Amen. I don't want to be a repbate. I don't want to be someone, brother Matthew, that walks up to the very end, preaches the word, but I just decide to say enough is enough and throw in the towel. I say, God, you're going to hold me all the way to the end. Not been out of arrogance, not out of anything that we've done, BUT BY HIS GRACE, BROTHER, BY HIS GRACE, he's going to hold us all the way through. &gt;&gt; And we don't we're never going to have all the answers. &gt;&gt; The pastors are never going to have all the answers. The evangelists are never going to have all the answers. The teachers will never have all THE ANSWERS. BUT AS LONG AS WE HAVE GOD IN OUR MIDST, the answer is always there. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're looking for answers in all the wrong places. &gt;&gt; I like what somebody said here recently, and I don't know where it come from, but it says, "We're always asking for a word from the Lord." And he said, "Well, God gave you all the books. What more do you need?" Anyways, there you go. At least you're still here. I guess I haven't put the microphone on correctly, so I'm just going to keep moving it around until it keeps moving itself. It's all right. Destruction may not always come from the sword, but through the power of words. I want us to look at Jude chapter 1. There's a lot of books, a lot of chapters in Jude, so it's going to be hard for you to find it. Jude 1. You know, Jude is not a very fun uh uh, you know, chapter to read. Sometimes it always kind of depends on what spirit you're in. &gt;&gt; Verse 10, but these speak evil of those things which they know not, but what they know naturally as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves. Now, I'm going to read that again. I'm going to read it out of a an amplified version. I really like how this brings it out. says, 'But these people criticize things they don't understand. Welcome to the church. They do understand some things, but they understand these things not by thinking, but by feeling the way dumb animals understand things. And these are things that destroy them. Now, I didn't call you a dumb animal. I was just reading a amplified version. So, take it as you will. This never mind. I was going to say about the shoe fitting. Don't do that. But the question of it is is how many times do we think we understand something &gt;&gt; and we begin to criticize based upon what we think we understand. &gt;&gt; But what is verse 11 tells us? It says, "Woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain." Woe unto those who think they understand. They're criticizing because of their thinking that they're understanding something, but truly they don't understand. And I have found that God doesn't tell you everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's some things we don't need to know. &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of things you don't need to know &gt;&gt; because we weren't meant to handle to have all of the knowledge of the church problems and all the knowledge of the things that the pastor has to deal with and the ministry has to deal with. Well, it wasn't meant for for you to know everything, BUT I DEMAND TO KNOW. Moving on. Woe to them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the era of Balum for reward and perished in the gains of Kora. That word gains is contradiction. So they perished in the contradiction of Kora or otherwise saying in disputes and question. So they ran. What was his era? In the disputes and questions of Kora. Now let's tie that up with Numbers chapter 16. I've got a quite a few verses of scripture here. I trying to hurry up in time, but slow down for you to find it. Numbers chapter 16:2 says this. And they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel 250 princes of the assembly. They got a pretty good following. Brother David, 250 princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown, and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. So, here we find again the misuse of the word for their day. &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, you know what? They had 250 princesses. Princes, princes, may have been some princesses in there. And men of renown, we got this figured out. And said unto them, you or I may say ye, ye take too much upon you. &gt;&gt; And seeing all the congregation are holy. I mean, Moses, you've done your job, aren't we holy? Every one of them. And the Lord is among them. Wherefore then, lift yourself up above the congregation of the Lord. Let me just say this. Kora didn't start with a sword. &gt;&gt; He started with questions. &gt;&gt; Aren't we all holy? &gt;&gt; I mean, who are you, Moses? &gt;&gt; Aren't we all holy? I can hear from God, too. &gt;&gt; Well, this sounds spiritual, doesn't it? But it's actually carnally motivated democracy &gt;&gt; and not divine order. &gt;&gt; As much as we as much as we want divine order, when divine order starts to happen in a church, we're like, that's not what I was talking about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah is right. &gt;&gt; Because divine order is not democracy. &gt;&gt; There's a head &gt;&gt; and God is the head. Right? And he is the head of the church and HE PLACES THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY IN THE CHURCH AND HE HAS THE PASTOR IN THE CHURCH AND HE HAS DIVINE ORDER. BUT THEN THE CHORUS STEPS UP AND HE DOESN'T COME WITH THE SWORD AND SAYS, "I'M GOING TO CUT your head off, Moses." He comes with question and and you know slowly undermining leadership. &gt;&gt; That's what begins to happen. That's what Kora was starting to do. he was starting. I mean, how in the world, brother David, did he get 250 princes ON HIS SIDE? THIS WAS NOT AN overnight disgruntled moment. &gt;&gt; This took years, weeks, months, maybe a year, whatever it was. It took time and frustrations. I want to remind you that you're still in this old coat the prophet of God talked about. So, no matter how much Holy Ghost you have, you're still going to go through frustration and you're still going to have questions in life and and the pastor is not always going to rub you the right way &gt;&gt; and he is not intended to. Notice, brother Brandham says why it had to be shepherd. Paragraph 153 says, notice they complained about God's provided way and that was the reason they died. Now, said closely, don't miss these last few remarks. They complained. Maybe I should ask a question. Yeah, I'm going to ask a question. How many's ever complained before? My hands are up, sweaty and all. I've complained. &gt;&gt; I complained from with the divine order. But you see, the difference is is who you are. &gt;&gt; Because you're going to go through those moments of questioning and complaint. David had error in his life, did he not? But it what what showed who he was, the man after God's own heart was when HE MADE A MISTAKE. HE DIDN'T JUST KEEP DOUBLING DOWN AND digging a ditch and get deeper and deeper. And in his mistake, he recognized, "I have sinned. I HAVE FAILED GOD." AND HE REPENTED. AND HE CAME BACK EVEN THE GREATER IN WORSHIP AND ADORATION towards the things of God. Not trying to keep proving why you're right. Like a teenager. &gt;&gt; Notice he said they complained. says, 'What made them die in the wilderness? THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT GOD'S PROVIDED WAY. WHY DO WE GOT TO KEEP EATING THE same mana every Sunday? We got to hear this old guy. Now, that's wasn't disrespectful. I'm trying to prove a point. &gt;&gt; That wasn't disrespectful. That wasn't stepping on your toes. He's a young man. But every day, we got to LISTEN TO THE SAME GUY, THE SAME MANA, &gt;&gt; but it's God's provided way. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the only time we get excited I'm I'm being a pastor now is when we have a visiting guy come. Now, not you know what I'm talking about. You ever seen that in your own church? It's like, oo, we're going to have brother David McGaryi Jr. I'm using everybody that's up here. He's going to be the guy. No, no, that's not what it is. God, whomever you have, whatever's provided at that moment, God, you have something for me. I'm going to eat the mana. I need this mana. It's a mana provided for me. But you see, notice they complained about God's provided way by a one-man message, a prophet, a leadership of one man. TELL ME WHERE GOD ever used a group to lead. You won't find it in THE BIBLE. THE WORD came to Moses. Kora, we all know that he got himself together and complained about God not being just. And to do a thing like that, make one man with the message. He said, "We're all holy. We Why can't we have a denomination? Why can't we set up this and do this and do that? GOD TOLD MOSES, "SEPARATE yourself from him. I've had enough of it." And remember, Jude speaks the same thing in the last days. That's right. They perished in the gain sayings of Kora. We also know what happened to Kora. And the rest that qu that question of God's word and God's wisdom of that one man leadership, every one of them perished. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Satan knows how to belittle by the little. By the little. He doesn't always come at you the great big sword and the great big ugly demon looking. Bible talks about the angel of light. &gt;&gt; Notice even Jesus. No. Okay. Again, I want I want you to understand this. There there's there's a point to this tonight. Jesus in Mark 6:4 said, 'And Jesus said unto them, a prophet is not without honor, but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house. Now, if you don't understand what that is saying, that basically means he was more respected outside of his area than his own area. Prophets are respected. Notice he's saying prophets are respected everywhere except in their own hometown and by their relatives and their family. Jesus was saying that now you don't have that problem here. Thank God you're perfect and everyone's on their way to glory. But there's other places that have this difficulty where it seems like sometimes you can leave your area and God can do more because we become common. We allow ourselves to become common with the mana. Now I'm not calling the ministry mana. Please understand that. I'm trying to use this as a type. God uses the five-fold ministry to bring the mana to bring the word of the hour. But it sometimes seems to be that God can use A MAN MORE OUTSIDE of his own country, HIS OWN DALLAS FORT Worth area, his own Amarillo, his own this area, his own that area. WHY? BECAUSE WE GET COMMON WITH THE FAITH in front of us. MOSES, WHO DO YOU think you are? We put our pants on the same way you do. We we have to eat the same way you do. Who do YOU THINK YOU ARE? WE'RE NOTHING WITHOUT GOD. Ministry gives us no elevation. It should actually MAKE US MORE HUMBLE. WE WE ARE NOTHING WITHOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; But there are times WE HAVE TO STAND UPON THE WORD AND PREACH THE WORD WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOR WHETHER IT hurts feelings or not. &gt;&gt; Because we're not in this for our feelings. We're in this for THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST AND THE SALVATION OF OUR HEARTS. &gt;&gt; I say I say brothers and sisters, LET'S THROW AWAY THE VICTIM MENTALITY AND DIVE INTO the word of God. &gt;&gt; No matter who stands here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mark 6 verse 5. We're going to continue in this what he said. said, and he said, "And he could do there, and he could there do no mighty work, say that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them." And he marveled because of their unbelief, and he went round about the villages teaching. Dishonor and lack of respect limits the supernatural in the body. Who could ever think to just say, "Oh, that was that's just Jesus, &gt;&gt; right? You know who Jesus is, right? Who could ever think that's just Jesus?" But that's the way they became when he was there because they seen him grow up, right? They seen all they they've seen his face and all it was, that's just Jesus. So I want you to understand that before you know it it's well that's just brother David &gt;&gt; and that's just that's just brother Matt and that's just listen I I I all of the ministers that are here I have you all raise your hands that's just this one and we do we begin to lose respect with one another &gt;&gt; because we're all called of God I don't want to just leave the ministry in this we're all called of God and before you know it as the elect we forget that we are to be elect and the person sitting next to YOU COULD BE ELECT also and we SHOULD NOT LOSE OUR RESPECT FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL EITHER. AND WE'VE ALL SINNED AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. AND WE ALL NEED THE MERCY and grace of God. And we all at times need to RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE EAGLES, NOT FLYING WHERE WE NEED TO BE FLYING. BUT BY GOD'S GRACE, THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE THAT GAVE US A WORD AND DUE SEASON. AND WE BEGIN to eat upon that meat so we could start SOARING THE HEIGHTS AS WELL. GOD MAY WANT TO USE YOU TO DO THE SAME FOR the person sitting next to you instead of with the attitude of I knew you would do that. No, there's something in our heart as an eagle that says, "I want to help my brother. I want to help my sister." Whereas the eyes of the enemy says, "I knew you were going to be that way. I knew you were going to have that reaction. I knew this was going to be the way it is." And all we're doing is looking upon that when we need to turn around to our OWN AND SAY, "GOD, I NEED YOU. I'm nothing without you." &gt;&gt; But here is Jesus. Jesus. and he couldn't hardly do anything with his own family. And if I can say this, his own church, if I could, if you could allow me to use that way. [snorts] Do you know that the cut doesn't always bleed at first? You see, most disrespect doesn't start as open rebellion. It's in the size. the private complaints, the little jokes about leadership, like paper cuts, small but painful and easily infected. Then the little things begin to accumulate and unchecked criticism and passive indifference and failure to pray for leadership, dismissing God's word because of the vessel it comes through. That's all it is. It's just the simple things that begin to happen. the lack of respect for the children, for the parents or it listen and it starts at home. If there's no respect built at home, it's hard to get the respect in the church. That's why you see America becoming the way it's become because somewhere along the way they've lost the teaching of respects. So now there's no teaching for respect of authority. There's no teaching of true respect. Oh, but brother Jeremy, don't you know there's there's crooks out there in the authority? Absolutely. There's crooks out there in the authority. No, I I'm not saying that we worship them, but but there's authority out there and we render to Caesar what Caesar, but it's not being taught in the homes. And because it's not being taught in the homes, it shows and manifests in the church to where when the pastor actually has to say something that's cutting, then we go home and like, "Oh, that was just brother brother David and you know, he's just going on a rant." &gt;&gt; That rant could save your child. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That rant could save your soul. &gt;&gt; And so, instead of it just dismissing it as a rant from brother David because, you know, that's just who he is. I say, let's look at it a little bit deeper. It's not just a rant from the prophet OF GOD. I SAY WE START LISTENING to a little bit more of his rants. I don't don't think me disrespectful, but I love listening to the prophet of God's rants. I like listening to say, "OH, SPEAKING." WHY? BECAUSE IT'S RELEVANT TODAY. IT WASN'T JUST RELEVANT for 1963 or 64 or before. It's still relevant today. IN FACT, IT'S more relevant now than it was then. &gt;&gt; Instead of googling everything, I think the message of the hour kind of gives us a pretty good idea of where we are. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we find that so many people are googling so many things and then when it comes to the prophet of God, we're like, "OH, IT'S WRONG." DO YOU RECOGNIZE that Google could be wrong, too? Christ is the mystery of God revealed in Jeffersonville, uh, Indiana. This was, uh, paragraph 86. He said, "If the brother," maybe we ought not to read this one. No, I think this is a good one. If you think he's a little wrong, or the sister say, "Lord, I knew it. They were wrong." &gt;&gt; No, everyone knows this quote, &gt;&gt; but it's hard sometimes to put it in action. Lord, don't never let ha uh uh don't let me never have the root of bitterness &gt;&gt; spring up &gt;&gt; because it'll affect him. &gt;&gt; Oh my, this is the next part is very important. It'll take the Christ right out of my life. &gt;&gt; You said it ain't possible. Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit's timid. &gt;&gt; I love the paradox there. It's timid, but it's also powerful. But you see, I want you to say, notice, I'm just reading what the prophet is saying. You do with it what you will. It'll take the Christ right out of my life. That poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just TAKE THE HOLY SPIRIT RIGHT AWAY FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; WELL, I'm the elect of God and I'm the I understand you ARE, BUT IF YOU'RE THE ELECT OF GOD, YOU'LL LISTEN TO WHAT HE'S SAYING AND YOU'LL get it right. We're not just going to sit on our spiritual uh couches AND BECOME SPIRITUAL COUCH POTATOES. WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE WORD OF GOD. AND WE'RE going to recognize, I've got a family THAT'S AT STAKE. I'VE GOT A HUSBAND THAT'S AT STAKE. I GOT A WIFE THAT'S AT STAKE. I'VE GOT UH BROTHERS AND SISTERS that are at stake. &gt;&gt; And we we come to the house of God and we want the pastor to fix everything for our family. But then we go home and we go back to the same exact thing that we were doing. &gt;&gt; That don't work. I'm Phil freedom tonight. So, we're just sometimes sometimes you just got I will just tell you that this whole trip was was wasted on what I actually came here for. I went there I went there to do what I was supposed to do with my van and they said, "Oh, you can't do that." So, you mean I traveled all the way here after doing all of this and it's for not? Yep. You can't do that. Okay. Well, at least I got good fellowship and I'm here tonight with you. So, it's not wasted after all. the poison acids of malice, jealousy, and hatred that'll just take the Holy Spirit right away from you. It will run him from the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; IT'LL KILL THE SPIRIT OF GOD. WHAT? MALICE, JEALOUSY, HATRED, or drive it from here. It'll hurt your pastor. Ah, we don't care about that. He's strong. &gt;&gt; It'll do everything. See, he said, "Don't you do that. You just waxed that much closer together. &gt;&gt; And you know, Christian Life Tabernacle, you're going to be tested for this &gt;&gt; time and time again. &gt;&gt; Not just once, and you'll overcome it, and you're going to get tested again. God allowed, Brother David uh uh to do something, and it will just not fit our fancy &gt;&gt; and you'll be tested again. And God will allow something to be done and the deacon will make a decision and this one will do that and before you know it we'll be tested again. &gt;&gt; Why? The the prophet of God's warning us just get closer together. &gt;&gt; Love one another anyhow. Talk nice about one another. Say nice things about one another. And then God will bless you. &gt;&gt; Think about it as it was uh Solomon spoke of the small foxes. They can spoil our lives and squaltch the fruit that we could be be uh producing. Because if we continue to leave these things unchecked in our lives, not even speak. We might not even speak but think. &gt;&gt; God knows the very thoughts. &gt;&gt; And uh sometimes we're like, "Woo, at least I didn't say it." But you thought it. &gt;&gt; How many times did the prophet of God said, "Your thoughts will be played." Listen, I want to get them under the blood now. &gt;&gt; I want to get everything now because I don't want them ever played that day &gt;&gt; because I know as THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, they they this is my judgment. &gt;&gt; This is my time of judgment right here and right now. SO I SAY, GOD, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WE JUST DON'T WANT THE PASTOR TO come up here and and get on our Listen, I would RATHER GOD USE A PASTOR TO RAKE US OVER the coals than stand ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE THRONE THAT DAY. &gt;&gt; I say, GOD, BRING IT ALL OUT. OPEN NOW. GOD, TEAR EVERYTHING OUT NOW. EXPOSE EVERYTHING NOW SO MY HEART CAN BE OPEN BEFORE you now because I want to BE STANDING WITH YOU that day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We forget that the ministry stands in the gap. God has called the true five-fold ministry to stand in the gap. that ministry is in the front lines of defense and yet they can be the most criticized and lonely. I've heard the I've heard the jokes throughout my whole growing up of ministries and ministers and oh they must have an easy life and they're this and they're that and oh you know and what all this little criticism they don't know that the very person they're criticizing has actually been standing in the gap that week for them has been actually bearing burdens for them that week. We forget that God uses the ministry. Not the ministry is not to just come at the moment. Oh, I'm only in the ministry when I'm behind here. &gt;&gt; Uh, no. If you're truly called of God, &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about running without a message. I'm talking about truly called of God. This is a daily grind spiritually for you, &gt;&gt; right? For you. And and it might not be the same person. God might use this one and God might use this. We all help one another. We all have burdens and we're all praying for one another. I'm not leaving you out of this. This is just what God's asked for me to speak tonight. I'm not leaving any one of us out. But I'm saying sometimes we lose the resp we forget the spiritual warfare that's going on behind the scenes. I've seen so pastors throughout my life and ministry weakened by their own congregation. not weakened by fall. Many ministers don't fall from scandal, but from being worn down, emotional fatigue, discouragement, and spiritual drain. And don't you one minute argue with me about that because you go look at the prophet of God. Well, he was a prophet of God. Listen, I'm not placing anybody in that level, but a ministry, a God- called ministry has to fight the that a battle as well. and it's and it's fatigue and it's tiresome and it's worn out, but all we can see is the face. If the enemy can just get us to look at the face and we can get us to look at the faults that we see as faults in and this brother, we actually don't pray for them. &gt;&gt; This is something that is this is something that is not just a simple local problem. This is a national problem. This is a world issue. This is a problem all across the world. We lose sight of the spiritual warfare that is actually going listen right now. Have you forgotten the spiritual warfare that's happening in this church right now? No. The the angels are not just sitting here. THERE IS A BATTLE THAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR YOU. THERE'S A SPIRITUAL WARFARE THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO CATCH YOUR attention and to get you OFF FROM HEARING EXACTLY WHAT YOU need to hear. But there is also those angels THAT ARE CAMPED ABOUT US that love THE LORD THAT ARE FIGHTING FOR YOU AND ARE WORKING for you so that you can receive a word from the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; There is discouragement and there's spiritual drain and there's emotional fatigue and you think, "Oh, not my pastor. He's the he's, you know, he's up there. He doesn't have this." And I'm not speaking for him, but I'm sure there's a battle. There's emotional fatigue. I wouldn't say ask his wife. She probably would know, but she's not left out of it either. She fights the same things. She fights those emotional the the fatigue and the tiredness. She might not preach a sermon, but she's taking that same warfare in that sense. You understand? Because the gift is called they're called together. I &gt;&gt; I might not be saying it the way you want me to say it, but I think you understand. &gt;&gt; Notice what happens here in Numbers 20:10. And I'm trying to hurry here. Says, "And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock." Now, we're trying to prove a point here. And he said unto them, "Hear now, ye rebels." Now, why would Moses say that, Brother David? He was fed up. He was tired. He was worn out of dealing with what? People. You never get that way here. Now, you rebels, must we fetch you water out of this rock? Now, let me ask you this. Wasn't Moses called? Was not he a prophet? Was not he a minister to the congregation? Was not he told what to do. What did he do? He got tired. Emot. I'm just going to throw this in. Emotionally fatigued, &gt;&gt; worn down. &gt;&gt; And he called the people rebels. Brother Brandham even had to apologize for I think one time he he remember how many he called them Rickys and Rickettettas and he said I believe he said he told me you ought not to do that. Think about it. Moses lifted up his hand with his rod. He smoked the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also. Why? Because he was a prophet of God and God honored that. But he didn't do it the right way because he was tired. Now again, I'm not speaking for your pastor and I'm not speaking for your ministry. Maybe they don't get tired, but we get tired and we get worn down. You get tired, church. You get tired. We're all written epistles. We're out of all men and we get tired and we get worn down. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just want to call everyone rebels. How many times did Moses fight? How many times did he fight for those trying to undermine his God-given authority? How many times did he stand in the gap for the very ones that was cursing him, making fun of him, telling him he was nothing? Let me just say this. You know, I can take this paper and I can just do one single cut and it does nothing. I mean, the paper still stands, but you take another one. I'm only I'm only one cut, but then you take another one. And then you have a conversation at home, and then you get with this one, and then you get with this one, and oh, and you get with this one, and before you know it, it's just all shreds. I'm not saying your pastor is in that way. I'm just talking about we death by a thousand cuts. Simple little you. What you said was razor thin. What you said did not rock the world. Did not change the world. But it was one cut in the sheet of paper. Single cut is small, but if you make a thousand cuts in the same paper, it will eventually fall apart. &gt;&gt; How many REVIVALS HAVE DIED NOT FROM SIN, BUT from familiarity with the anointed? Think about what this word death by a thousand cuts comes from. It comes from the word lingchi. The word was used to describe the prolonging of a person's agony when the person was being killed. Let me put you this way. The ministry, true ministry only wants and desires the salvation of you. &gt;&gt; That's all they want. They truly want to see you succeed in the word and in growth. There is no big eyes and there's no little 's. There is only the anointing for it. So it has nothing to do, listen, I could be brother Jeremy that wasn't called to preach the word. I could be that, but it because I was called to this doesn't make me big or anything. It has nothing to do with that. IT'S ONLY GOD USING a vessel that is broken and IT NEED TO BE PUT BACK TOGETHER TO DO WHAT? TO JUST GIVE A WORD. LISTEN, we talked about the foolishness of preaching. This is foolish. Think about what we're doing. I'm standing be IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW. SPITTING and yelling and saying all kinds of things. IT'S FOOLISH. I DON'T KNOW your life. I don't want to be up here. &gt;&gt; I I mean that. I don't want to be up here. I'd rather be sitting over there with my wife, but I'm doing what God wants me to do. &gt;&gt; And it's not easy for you to stand sometimes with your friends in the world and on your job and take a stand for the things of God. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT POSITION, BUT YOU WERE CALLED TO. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE CALLED NOT TO DO IT WITH ARROGANCE AND NOT TO DO IT WITH PRIDE, BUT TO DO IT WITH HUMILITY THAT YOU SAID, "BY THE GRACE OF GOD, LOOK AT WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME. I WILL NOT STAND FOR THOSE THINGS." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; We stand for the truth for our family. We show up on Wednesday nights. &gt;&gt; We show up ON SUNDAY MORNINGS. WE SHOW UP ON SUNDAY NIGHTS. &gt;&gt; We do these not because I DON'T WANT TO BE PREACHED AT, BUT WE DO IT BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING IN OUR HEART. I BELIEVE A TRUE BELIEVER DESIRES TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYTIME THEY CAN AND THE doors are open. &gt;&gt; Other than that, it's a cut. &gt;&gt; It's a cut. God works in mysterious ways. God works in mysterious ways. &gt;&gt; God works in mysterious ways. God works in mysterious ways. Who would have thought you and your life and your sins and your faults would be sitting in a pew tonight hearing the word of God, worshiping God with your hands raised, set free from ALL YOUR PAST. GOD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS. I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER FOR IT. I DON'T NEED AN ANSWER FOR IT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS, the only answer I can say is IT'S JESUS. AND IT'S NOT BY ME, BUT IT'S BY HIS GRACE AND MERCY. Isaiah 58:12 says, "And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places. Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of the paths to dwell in." It's not just critics and casualties. It's not just about being critics and casualties, but it's about restoration and healing that can come. WE'RE NOT HERE TO OUTDUEL preaching and outdo this and be the best church this and look at me. No, we are here to be restorers. We are here to be healers. Not that I'm a healer, but the healer is within me. And the healer can speak through the words. I'm done trying to be a little blade that is JUST PROBING AND PRODDDING BECAUSE IT DIDN'T WORK my way. I SAY, GOD, LET ME BE A RESTORER OF MY FAMILY. LET ME STAND up for my children. Let me stand up for my family. God still has people who will honor his word and cherish his messengers and rebuild what others have torn down. IF YOU'VE MADE CUTS, HE CAN HEAL. IF YOU'VE BEEN CUT, he can restore. I say, let this be known AS THE PLACE WHERE HONOR FLOWS. We're not here to lift up a man and say, "Oh, we've got the greatest general in the in the message." No, we've got messengers THAT HAVE BEEN CALLED A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY, AND LET HONOR FLOW IN THIS CHURCH. Whoever it is, I say let honor flow and let's respect one another. &gt;&gt; Respect the message that God has given to one another. We might not understand one another and we might listen. You might not like fishing. You might not like golfing. We weren't always all meant to sit across the table and have a chat, but God PLACED ALL OF US TOGETHER. God has play Listen. And there is a friend that stickketh closer than a brother. Oh, I got no friends here. Where's Jesus at? &gt;&gt; HE'S THE GREATEST FRIEND OF ALL. YOU CAN GET MARRIED AND STILL BE LONELY. You can BE IN A CROWD AND STILL BE LONELY. BUT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE JESUS, YOU HAVE ALL THAT YOU NEED. &gt;&gt; I say this in this church. I get it. We all have broken pieces &gt;&gt; that can be mended, &gt;&gt; but we have to let it be healed. We all have things in our life we do not understand, &gt;&gt; but God can use them for his glory &gt;&gt; if you will just allow him to heal you. &gt;&gt; Because it's not about us. It's about him working through us. It's allowing the God that knows healing to mend our lives for us to be the best that we can be. &gt;&gt; And I want to I want to bring this to a close with this with this principle. The scar, think about this. Scars are not just flaws to be ashamed of. They're marks of victory. &gt;&gt; The Kugi principle. This concept is beautifully illustrated by kugi, the Japanese art of repairing repairing broken pottery with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold. The philosophy is that the piece is now more beautiful and valuable for having been broken and repaired &gt;&gt; with the gold lines highlighting &gt;&gt; not hiding the breakage. &gt;&gt; Your scars are not the devil might want to put it in your life and say well you've got to hide your scars were not meant to be ashamed of &gt;&gt; your scars are a sign of healing in your life &gt;&gt; and they're the gold lines. Hallelujah. That the devil can't take away from you because he didn't heal you. &gt;&gt; He didn't put you back together. &gt;&gt; But I know a healer of broken pieces. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know a healer of the scars. &gt;&gt; And what is it? It's empathy and testimony. The healed scar NOW BECOMES THE MOST POWERFUL PART OF YOUR STORY. It allows YOU TO RELATE TO OTHERS who are currently in the same wound that you were. And it GIVES YOU AUTHORITY BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH it before. And listen, I MADE IT THROUGH IT. YOU CAN, TOO. &gt;&gt; And that's why Satan WANTS TO KEEP YOU DOWN AND DEPRESSED AND BROKENHEARTED AND PLAYING THE VICTIM BECAUSE HE CAN STOP YOU FROM HELPING SOMEONE ELSE. I SAY IT'S TIME TO CLAIM OUR authority of healing. I'VE BEEN HEALED. I'VE BEEN SET FREE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And there's nothing like that healing and power. I'll give you an example, the greatest example of all. And his name was Christ. Jesus Christ. The most profound example is Jesus Christ who could have risen with a perfect unmarred body, but he chose to retain his scars. Those scars were not a sign OF DEFEAT, BUT TRIUMPH AND PROOF OF HIS LOVE, SACRIFICE, and victory over death. And what did those scars do? Those scars helped someone who was doubting. &gt;&gt; He could have came up with no scars, but he kept the SCARS FOR ME. LISTEN, GOD IS going to allow you TO KEEP THOSE SCARS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT YOU CAN HELP. THERE'S someone that you can help along the way. But you've got to stop BEING A VICTIM AND LET THE HEALER heal you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But start moving forward and seeing those scars. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help me. Help you. Help us all, Lord. [snorts] &gt;&gt; These scars were lessons learned. &gt;&gt; Things that we might have made mistakes in our own life, but God allowed it. Brother Matthew, I've I've I've even remember as a teenager going, "What can God get out of what I just went through?" &gt;&gt; Some 10, 15 years down the road, I'm standing in front of somebody encouraging them. I went through exactly what you went through. &gt;&gt; Healer of the broken pieces. &gt;&gt; Those small foxes, the little cuts, the little jabs. This is not becoming of the elect lady. We as believers are responsible and are should start taking accountability for the word that's been given in our life. I'm accountable. I'm not a I'm not a a snot-nosed teenager that has it all figured out. I'm sorry teenager. I don't mean that. Listen, we're in the age where it's not just teenagers. &gt;&gt; I don't know it all, but I know one &gt;&gt; who is still working on me, &gt;&gt; still healing me. And I want to say the enemy wants to handcuff the true five-fold ministry, but let us let it be what God has intended it to be in this final days. &gt;&gt; Preach the word. &gt;&gt; Preach the word. &gt;&gt; We don't deviate from the message. &gt;&gt; We don't deviate from what the prophet said &gt;&gt; because a prophet didn't deviate from the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; We stick with the word of God. We stay humble. Listen, each and every one of us, we all carry a ministry. Hallelujah. And whatever that ministry is, if it's only for one, I'm going to ask you, is one soul worth your entire life? &gt;&gt; Is one soul worth it? I say let's say because you might be, I've never helped anyone, you just wait. Your life is about to help someone. &gt;&gt; And that's why Satan is trying so hard to break you and to weaken you. But I say, you have a healer tonight. We don't need to leave this place again WITH THAT VICTIM SPIRIT. I SAY, let's leave this place knowing THAT I'VE BEEN HEALED AND I've been set free. I'm throwing down that little blade. I'm not jabbing anymore. I'M NOT CUTTING ANYMORE. BUT I'M SAYING, GOD, I'M GOING TO BACK THE MINISTRY IN PRAYER. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to sit in a church and and wait for them to make a mistake. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to say, God, lead them &gt;&gt; to lead me. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Musicians can come. &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "And God sends a representative, and he anoints this representative and sends it into the world and the people must obey that representative. It's always been that way all down through the Bible. And it hasn't changed today. I want to say this. I'm not lifting any up man up. I don't believe that's what we're here for. But I'm lifting up the divine order of God. And the divine order of God, however it is. Listen, our only food is should not only be on a Wednesday night or not on a Sunday morning, but we feast daily upon the word by pressing play and listening to the message and reading the message. And then when we come to the house of God on the services that the doors have been open to because we do call ourselves a part of this church, I believe we should act like it and that means I get it. People are sick and I understand that. But it is the most discouraging thing to someone who is striving and praying and working and burdening for the souls [music] to see souls that just don't care. And then we come and we shake their hand. Oh, God bless you. I really enjoyed that sermon. I really enjoyed that. You just really touched my heart. And then the next service we're just don't show up. I'm not talking just simply about being in these pews because you can be here and not be here. [music] When we come here we worship. Now, we all worship different. I understand we don't all stand and we don't all this, but we come and we at least have a Did we forget it's a sacrifice of praise? God bless you [music] for being here. Those that are online that couldn't be here because of the sickness, God heal you. Go into your home and and bring forth the healing in your life. The enemy is brutal. He's brutal against the the fathers and he's brutal against the mothers and the [music] the children. But there's a healer tonight. And I can't promise a a flowery bed of ease. Trust me, I know that. But one thing I can promise is you have a friend that'll stick closer than a brother. And he said he'd never leave nor forsake you. And he wants to be with you. And he wants to be in you. And he wants to lead you and guide you. But you've got to take his divine order to heart. Lord, as we come before you, Lord, my desire, my heart's desire, Lord, and I pray that I'm just not the only one, but my heart's desire is, Lord, help me to stand in your divine will, Lord. I don't want to be in a permissive, well, I've been in it before. I don't ever want to be there again, Lord. Lord, if if something happens in my life, Father, [music] Lord, I'm praying this prayer because I need your help, Lord. But I I want to be able to react as a believer, respond as a believer. I I want to be able to to be the elect bride that you've called me to be, Lord. And God, I know that there's there's a lot of cuts perhaps in the church tonight. There's maybe some broken pottery, Lord, in the building tonight. But Lord, may they admit, Father, their condition. And may they stand before you as it were spiritually and say, "Lord, I I'm nothing without you. I need you." May there be [music] honest hearts tonight. I I want to ask you, Life Tabernacle this evening, as our heads are bowed, would you want to be honest with him this evening? and maybe simply of the uplifting of hand or standing in his presence and say Lord there is some healing I need in my life father [music] and and I want to give it to you father and I want to I want to admit it not please don't just do this out of tradition from your heart I want to be able to help Lord and and I want you to lead me but father I've allowed maybe and I'm just saying all kinds of things so you're not just standing for this but maybe there's someone that has allowed some jealousy maybe there's someone that has allowed some malice Maybe there's been a lot of questions in your mind and and it's been weakening you. Say, "Lord, here am I. I don't I actually realize I don't need all those answers. [music] I just need to trust you. I just need to take you at your word tonight. I don't need to know how everything's going, Lord. I just need to trust you. I just need to Listen, there's things we don't need to know. Life tabernacle, we just need to trust him. Do you believe God has called you to this area? Do you believe God has called you to this message? [music] If you believe God has truly called you to this message and you know who you are in this word, then you simply have to take him at his word. He didn't bring you this far to leave you. He's not going to drop you at the end. He's going to take you all the way through. We're not dying tonight. I'm being healed. And these scars in my life, God's going to get the victory for them. Will you claim that tonight? Lord, you see the hearts that have been the hands [music] that were raised, those that have stood. Thank you for their honesty. Father, we pray. Lord, we ask that you would just move now as we step into this mode of worship, Lord. Lord, we do not do this out of tradition, but Father, because we recognize as believers this evening how much we need you and how much we're nothing without you. Let's sing it now. Healer of the broken [music and singing] pieces. Can we stand together and worship the Lord? You touched my [music] heart and made it new. [music] &gt;&gt; My whole life. [singing] Will you surrender again tonight? &gt;&gt; Just [music] do it one more time. &gt;&gt; My [singing] heart to you. Love [singing] that sought [music] before I knew you. Hallelujah. Has [music] brought me near to where [singing] you are. Now I live to praise [music and singing] you. Ever may I praise you, healer [music] of my Oh, sing it again now. Healer of the broken pieces. Oh, healer of the [singing] broken [music] pieces. You [singing] touched my heart and made it new. [music] Oh, thank you for doing that, Lord. Now my [singing] whole life I surrender. Lay it down [music] before the men. Lord, I give [singing] my heart all to you. Love that [music and singing] song before I knew you has brought me here to [music] where you are. [singing] Oh, now I [music and singing] live to praise you. Ever I praise you, the healer [music and singing] of my heart. &gt;&gt; Love that song before I knew you. Aren't you glad he was seeking you? Love [music and singing] this song before I knew you. [music] Brought me to where you are. Oh &gt;&gt; my praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] May I praise you, healer of [singing] my [music] heart. The key of F or F. Either way is fine. You know the song, Consume Me, Lord. [music] I might sing it a little different, but let's just try. Consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit. Consume me Lord and make me more like you. Amen. Consume me [singing] Lord with the [music] fire of [singing] your spirit. Maybe your heart now consume [music and singing] me Lord [music] and make [singing] me more like you. Oh, and raise [singing and music] me, Lord, and bless the broken [music] [singing] pieces of my life. Oh, [singing and music] let me be used. Is that your [music] desire tonight? Oh, by you. Do you really know what you're singing? You're asking [music] for a lot, but mean it from your heart now. Oh, [singing] consume me, Lord. God bless you, church. [music] With the fire of your spirit. Oh, consume [music and singing] me, Lord. and make me [music] Lord and bless the broken pieces [music] of my life. Can we be [music] you? [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, [music] I I just thought as brother Jeremy preached how blessed we are. You know, [music] can you imagine a five-fold ministry just ran by men? &gt;&gt; You wouldn't know where to go or or who to follow. &gt;&gt; But we've all been purchased [music] with the same price. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Didn't pay more for you than he paid for you. And we all have an absolute. We all have the same absolute. [music] And if I had a message book, I'd hold it up. The We all have the same revealed word of God that we can all listen to [music] and follow together. That's what does away with all the big eyes's and the little U's. Is the absoluteness of God's word. [music] And if all of us would just commit our hearts and our lives to that word, we'd all be living like little messiahs, praying and helping and because [music] we know where we come from. And even in the statue of the perfect man, I thought [music] how Peter said, "A man that doesn't add these things can't see a far off." [music] and has forgot where he's come from. So that's the beauty of our unity. That's the beauty of our calling. It wasn't something we could join. It was something we were elected to, that we've been called to. [clears throat] And we all have the same voice that we can hear. That ought to cause the greatest unity and love amongst one another. and and through life, you know, it [music] never never hurts for you to go out and bear somebody's burden. Tell them, you know, I know you're going through a lot. I [music] I want you to know I'm praying for you. Is there anything I can do to help you? You know, don't ever cast draw circles and put people out. Draw circles and bring them in closer. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, [music] cuz it won't &gt;&gt; really what can hurt me. &gt;&gt; My feelings get hurt, but I I possess something that I know was given to me by God. &gt;&gt; And that's one thing the devil can't do. I like that saying, "Sticks and stones may hurt, may break my bones, but the devil will never deceive me." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I made that up. &gt;&gt; But that's how we feel. &gt;&gt; So you you I just hope that you see what Brother Jeremy is saying. We have something above all our feelings and above all our emotions that we can rise up to. That's life. And it it's not just you. It's the people he's put around you. [music] He's purchased with the same price and given them the same absolute. That ought to be a fellowship &gt;&gt; one for another. And the spirit of Antichrist is a spirit that breaks fellowship. &gt;&gt; So, we just have such a thing to draw together around [music] and lift this word up and lift this message up. I think it's it's wonderful tonight. [music] And the closer you get to the word, the more that you listen and the more that it teaches you, the more you become Christlike and more the character of [music] Jesus Christ is identified in you. Amen. Let's sing this song as that we turn it. Amen. Oh, I know the time is near where everything that I hold dear before. [music] All my words [music] and all my deeds. [singing] Every on my knees before [music] to be [singing] fire. All I [music] want to see is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. All I [music] want to see is in me. All I [music and singing] want to see is Jesus shine [music] through [singing] me. burden shelf [music] afflicted [singing] pain and everything that I thought gave away before [music] the holy cons [singing] [music] [singing and music] before the Lord. Holy shing fire. All [music and singing] I want to see is Jesus. [music] All I want to see is me. [music] I want to see [music] Jesus. Oh sharing [music] [music and singing] single. [music] [music] [music] and my faithful. [music] All I want [music and singing] to see is Jesus. Oh, and all I want to see is [music] in me. All I [music] want to see is Jesus. Oh sh and hearing sing and hearing [music] [singing] Yeah. and [music] God, [music] my [music] faithful to &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; All I want to see is Jesus. All I want to see is him. All I [singing and music] want to see is Jesus shining [music] through me. &gt;&gt; You is [singing] of the glory. [music] Just worship him and [singing] oh and Lord [music] we lift our hands in worship. Oh [singing and music] and we praise you. Thank him for the word you just heard tonight. [music] Just lift him up in your heart and I and [singing and music] oh and Lord we lift our hands [music and singing] in worship always we praise your holy [singing] name. Oh, you are [music] great. [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; like you. Oh, [music] you are great. You do [singing] so great. [music] There is no one else like you. Oh, and there is no one [music and singing] else like you deserve the glory. [music] &gt;&gt; Blessed father, we thank you tonight. &gt;&gt; We worship you Lord tonight for your word in our heart. [music] We lift our hands in worship. Oh, as we praise your [music] holy name, you deserve the glory. Oh, and [music] the [singing] Oh, we lift our hands [music] in worship. As we praise the holy name for you. [music] [singing] For there is no one else like you. Forest [music] like you. Oh, you are great. [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; and cross all the way. There is no [music] one else like you. Oh, there is no [music] one else like you. Hallelujah. Brother Matthew, forget your comment. That's this tonight. &gt;&gt; Blessed be your holy name. Hallelujah. Lord, we we're just humbled to be in your presence tonight. Lord, we know that there would be no flesh that could stand in your presence, Lord. for there's no righteousness of man that could ever be good enough or qualify to be in your presence. Lord, your grace and your mercy made a way that a a sinner could be forgiven. Not just forgiven, but we could be justified. That we never did it in the first place. Lord, we thank you for that revelation in this hour that allows us the freedom and the liberty to know that in your presence is fullness of joy and life. And [music] with a pure heart, we can worship you in spirit and in truth. And we're not victims. We don't have to &gt;&gt; worry about the hardships and the hurt and the pain that we've gone through. Lord, your word says that all things work together for good to them that love God and are called according to your purpose. Lord, there's none good but you. And Lord, by revelation, we see that it's just the perfecting of our character. And Lord, that it's your life that's being molded and developed inside of us. Lord, though we feel cut and we feel wounded, we feel bruised. Lord, you said, "Marvel not that the world hates you, for they hated me, Lord." So, we realize that this is just part of the journey on this side as a Christlike character is being molded in us, Lord. And I thank you for the message that we've heard tonight, Lord, that gives us the ammunition needed to realize that a lot of the pain, a lot of the suffering and the hurts and things that we've gone through, [music] Lord, is just opportunities for a Christlike character to be developed in us. Lord, just as you kept your scars, Lord, it was your very scars that you would say to Thomas, Thomas, see the scars. Reach your hand to my side. I am the Christ, a risen Lord. And Father, we maybe have been bruised. We've been hurt. We've been battered. We've come from uh uh uh what would seem to be wrecked lives and family backgrounds, Lord. But but it was your grace and your mercy that's pulled us up out of the muck and out of the mire. Maybe lives that have been seemed to be torn apart by family situations and maybe ruined by drugs and alcohol. Oh, but your grace and your mercy, you reached out into the ashes. You reached out into the muck. You reached out into the mire, Lord, and you resurrected a people out of the mire, Lord. And you set us up upon a strong rock of revelation that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And now, Lord, this isn't the time to be the victim. This is the time to shine the greatest light that has ever shined unto mankind. And to declare unto a dying generation that you are alive and what you did for me, you could do for others. Lord, let us go into the highways and into the byways and say, "Christ is alive. He is risen amongst us, the [music] same yesterday, today, and forever. You are not dead, but what you've done for me, you can do for others. Lord, we thank you for such a message. We thank you for a word. We thank you coming and visiting us tonight to know Lord that you care. Lord, you're mindful of our needs, Lord. I can testify there's situations and a and lives present amongst us, Lord. And you took the gift. You took the five-fold ministry and you spoke words of life and healing and deliverance, Lord. that we can walk out of our prisons and we can walk away uh uh from a victim mentality and know that we truly are set free and we have a liberty by the Holy Ghost to go forth as a a victorious conqueror in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, we love you. We just commit, brother Jeremy, to you and his wife. May you continue to build them up, Lord, and and to strengthen them and continue to give life prevailing revelation. May you strengthen their little flock there in Amarillo, Lord. how much we love them and appreciate their light that they're shining. Oh God, it could be there that they catch the last one. Could be here. Lord, may we have a heart for the lost ones, Lord. Look out upon the needs of one another, especially those of the household of faith. We love you, Lord, and we just commit the assembly to you, Lord, and ask that you would be with those that weren't able to be here, Lord, in the needs that were represented amongst us. We know Lord Jesus that you're mindful of them all. We just ask that you go with us now. May you be our portion. Just pour back into our precious brother who poured out Lord 100fold. I pray we love you. We ask these things in your name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you are dismissed. In moments like this, I [music] sing [singing] out a song. I sing [music and singing] out a love song to Jesus [music] [singing] in moments [music] like him. I lift up [singing] my hands. Oh, when I lift out my hands to the Lord. Oh, [music and singing] singing I love [music] you. Hallelujah. I [music] love you. Oh, seeing [music] my [music] hallelujah. you. Oh, what in moment? [music and singing] Oh, I sing out a song. I sing out [music] a love song to Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; always thy peace. I lift [music] up my hands. Oh, I lift [music] up my hands to the Lord. [music] Oh, sing I [music] sing [music] my God. you. [music] Oh, seeing I love [music] you. [music] Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
