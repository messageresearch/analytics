[46:17] gracious Heavenly Father how we exalt
[46:19] you lord lord we give you the praise and
[46:22] the Adoration that's do your name
[46:24] father we don't want to just sit in the
[46:26] outer Court Lord
[46:28] we don't want to just enjoy your
[46:30] goodness and the outpouring of your
[46:31] presence that we feel here father but
[46:33] there's something calling and drawing us
[46:36] Lord into the holy of holies Lord Place
[46:39] only your bride can go father into that
[46:42] inner chamber and Lord we want to give
[46:44] you the Adoration let's do your name
[46:46] father we want to commune with you
[46:48] tonight as we've gathered together
[46:50] around your word and Lord It's a
[46:52] provided place a fellowship you've made
[46:55] lord it's not of man it's nothing that
[46:57] we could have done and Lord we don't
[46:59] look to our works or anything that we
[47:03] would esteem Lord but we look to you and
[47:05] the lamb and we exalt you and say you're
[47:08] the worthy one and we want to thank you
[47:10] for this time of Fellowship that we have
[47:12] and father we ask that you would now
[47:14] just have complete control that you'd
[47:16] moved me out of the way Lord may you
[47:17] Minister life to your people father Lord
[47:20] the words of man will fill but your
[47:21] words cannot fill Lord there's a
[47:24] specific purpose there's something
[47:26] specific you want done father we want to
[47:29] yield to that and ask that you would
[47:31] have your way father
[47:33] the praise in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[47:35] these things amen if you have your
[47:37] Bibles let's turn in Deuteronomy 4.
[47:41] read a portion of scripture I've really
[47:44] enjoyed the the word and the fellowship
[47:46] we've had just incredible
[47:49] uh
[47:51] services and brother Paul and our pastor
[47:54] this morning
[47:55] and something just struck my heart in
[47:58] the fellowship with around that we want
[48:01] to
[48:02] talk about and we'll take a text and
[48:04] move into that Deuteronomy 4 now
[48:07] therefore hearken o Israel unto the
[48:09] statutes and unto the judgments which I
[48:12] teach you for to do them that ye may
[48:15] live and go in and possess the land
[48:18] which the Lord God your fathers giveth
[48:21] you you shall not add unto the word
[48:24] which I command you neither shall ye
[48:26] diminish ought from it that ye may keep
[48:30] the Commandments of the Lord your God
[48:32] which I command you you may be seated
[48:38] just ask the Lord to bless the portion
[48:40] of word we've read
[48:41] what's on our heart is is uh just struck
[48:45] us this morning of
[48:47] the influence that we should be under
[48:50] that deep that should be calling us that
[48:52] Heavenly image that we're called to to
[48:55] manifest and God's provided place of
[48:58] doing that
[49:00] there's only one channel under which we
[49:03] can represent the Heavenly image he has
[49:06] of us and that has been provided in the
[49:09] message of this day that pattern was
[49:12] laid in Deuteronomy where Moses having
[49:16] given the Commandments to the children
[49:18] of Israel is telling them I this is a
[49:21] how you will possess the land do not
[49:24] deviate from it and there's a specific
[49:27] instruction I think here it's profound
[49:29] he says to not diminish it
[49:32] and if there's a day of diminishing the
[49:36] prophet's message we're living in it now
[49:38] it's because there's the the spirit has
[49:41] been poured out there's been Revelation
[49:44] there's been inspiration and men now
[49:46] have moved into that brother Branham the
[49:48] biggest problem he had with Pentecost is
[49:51] they would do things inspired with the
[49:55] outpouring of the spirit and deny the
[49:56] word of God so much of the teaching that
[49:59] we see is the admonishment of how the
[50:03] outpouring of the spirit could be there
[50:04] but yet there would be in air and
[50:07] contrary to the word of God
[50:10] let's not use the that admonishment
[50:16] to somehow diminish the necessity of the
[50:18] outpouring of the spirit
[50:20] because the while the cocklebur lives
[50:23] off the same Reign the wheat can't
[50:25] survive without it either
[50:27] so the the admonishment stays the same
[50:31] but the blessing is mine
[50:33] if it I'm not going to for some reason
[50:37] have the attitude of well bless God
[50:42] they're dancing in the spirit with
[50:45] bobbed hair with makeup or with whatever
[50:48] it is I mean you know that's just an
[50:49] obvious example of a trespass of the
[50:51] word of God but whatever it is
[50:55] you don't let that steal your joy I mean
[50:58] it's a very simple thing if if for some
[51:01] reason you let hypocrisy keep you from
[51:04] having a blessing from God then somehow
[51:06] you've put the hypocrite closer to God
[51:08] than you are
[51:10] move past that you know it press press
[51:14] in there's a provided place and we
[51:17] rejoice in that our
[51:21] Comfort is we are in the position that
[51:23] this message has placed Us in we are
[51:26] abiding in the word of God so then we
[51:28] can have a righteous partaking of Every
[51:30] Blessing
[51:31] of it I it's uh it's just a tactic of
[51:35] the enemy he he's a tactician anything
[51:39] he could do to rob you of a blessing of
[51:41] God he's going to use condemnation he's
[51:45] going to use uh a logic but we're not we
[51:49] don't have to listen to that we can cast
[51:51] down reasonings
[51:53] turn over and you could follow this I
[51:56] think another example of just knowing in
[51:58] the place of abiding knowing where
[51:59] you're supposed to be to receive a
[52:01] blessing I I love the story of Ruth I
[52:04] think if if you could you know find
[52:06] inspiration and just lean to something
[52:08] if you want to read something go read
[52:09] the book of Ruth
[52:11] but in chapter two I'm just going to
[52:13] read through it we know the story but
[52:17] there's a instruction that from that
[52:19] Boaz gives and I just want to read the
[52:22] the context of it and Naomi had a
[52:25] Kinsman of her husband a mighty man of
[52:28] wealth of the family
[52:31] and the name was Boaz and Ruth the
[52:36] mobitis said and date Naomi Let Me Now
[52:39] go to the field in glean Airs of corn
[52:41] after him and whose sight I shall find
[52:44] Grace and she said unto her go my
[52:48] daughter and she went and came and
[52:50] gleaned in the field after the Reapers
[52:52] and her hap was light a part of the
[52:56] field
[52:57] belonging unto Boaz
[52:59] who was of the Kindred of eliminate
[53:03] and behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and
[53:07] said unto the Reapers the Lord be with
[53:09] you and they answered the Lord bless
[53:12] thee and he said then said Boaz unto the
[53:15] servant that was set over the Reapers
[53:17] whose damsel is this and the servants
[53:21] that was said over the Reapers answered
[53:23] and said it is the Moab damsel that came
[53:26] back with Naomi out of the country at
[53:29] Moab and she said I pray you let me
[53:32] glean and gather after the Reapers among
[53:35] the sheaves so that she came and hath
[53:38] continued even from the morning and
[53:40] until now and she tarried a little in
[53:43] the house then said Boaz unto Ruth
[53:46] Hearst thou not my daughter go not to
[53:49] glean in another field neither go from
[53:52] hence but abide here fast by my maidens
[53:55] let thine eyes be on the field that they
[53:58] do reap and go after the young men that
[54:01] they shall not touch thee pardon he said
[54:04] let thine eyes be on the field that they
[54:07] do reap and go Thou after them have I
[54:09] not charged the young men that they
[54:11] shall not touch thee and when thou art a
[54:14] thirst go unto the vessels and drink of
[54:17] that which the young men have drawn then
[54:20] she fell on her face and bowed herself
[54:22] to the ground and said unto him why have
[54:25] I found Grace in thine eyes that thou
[54:27] shouldest take knowledge of me seeing I
[54:30] am a stranger and Boaz answered and said
[54:33] under it hath fully been showed unto me
[54:36] what thou has done unto thy
[54:38] mother-in-law since the death of thine
[54:40] husband and how thou Hast left thy
[54:42] father thy mother and thy land of thy
[54:44] Nativity and thou Hast come
[54:47] a people which thou knowest not
[54:50] hereafter
[54:51] the Lord recompense thy Work and a full
[54:55] reward be given thee of the Lord God of
[54:58] Israel under whose wings Thou Art come
[55:01] to trust
[55:05] the wings that we're trusting in
[55:08] is a Malachi 4 5 message as a
[55:12] Revelations 10 7 message
[55:14] if we abide there and we trust the word
[55:18] will absolutely perform everything that
[55:20] it's been sent to do there's not another
[55:23] field there shouldn't be anything else
[55:25] drawing us and I know this is Elementary
[55:27] but there's a blessing that's ours that
[55:30] when the spirit of God comes in its move
[55:32] and it's here now and the outpouring of
[55:35] the Lord comes in fathomless Billows you
[55:37] have to know where you're standing
[55:39] because it's in that move that
[55:41] fanaticism happens it's in that move and
[55:45] I believe we're standing where the Lord
[55:46] wants us to be but you have to know
[55:49] where you're established don't leave the
[55:51] field as soon as you leave the field you
[55:54] lose your blessing
[55:56] and and that all these examples that are
[56:00] given to us there's so many but why
[56:03] would they be given
[56:04] why would they have to stand there
[56:06] because man is always drawn after
[56:11] the inspiration after the Leaning of it
[56:13] and they've readily forget why how could
[56:17] they even had a place
[56:19] don't leave your place of blessing and
[56:22] even how you enter in and possess the
[56:24] Promised Land Is by The Commandments
[56:25] there there's
[56:28] uh you know litmus test to certain
[56:31] things standards the checkup of the word
[56:34] the Deep calling to the Deep we should
[56:36] always be being challenged we should not
[56:38] be arresting a sign of a Son of God is
[56:41] is not that you set in the blessing but
[56:44] there has to be a challenge that comes
[56:46] and hits the heart and says but more of
[56:49] you Lord more of you God's Prophet it
[56:52] you he never rested
[56:56] he there was always an expression of I
[56:59] don't want to stop I want to go into all
[57:02] the blessings that God has for me
[57:04] and the
[57:07] thing that
[57:09] I want to maybe just share and maybe
[57:12] it's a another way of looking at it
[57:15] maybe even for the kids going back to
[57:16] school is that deep calling is an
[57:19] influence a desire to express a Heavenly
[57:22] image and there's always going to be a
[57:25] cry for manifestation of other voices
[57:27] and you're giving voice and there's an
[57:30] influence that you're under and the
[57:33] discernment to understand what is
[57:36] influencing me even now in this moment
[57:38] what is the influence and what is it
[57:42] Desiring to manifest in my life because
[57:44] there's one thing certain whatever
[57:46] you're influenced by is going to be an
[57:49] influence that you have on other people
[57:52] and and that's that's a blessing or a
[57:55] curse
[57:56] you are a little Messiah you could
[57:58] create an atmosphere you you could say
[58:01] you know what if a terror is rejoicing
[58:03] you say give me my blessing yeah where's
[58:06] where's my portion
[58:09] you know so you could actually be
[58:10] influenced
[58:12] by someone entering into a blessing
[58:15] and they may not even be seed
[58:18] but you have to have enough wherewithal
[58:20] to understand that's a genuine
[58:21] outpouring that's a genuine Spirit the
[58:24] waters being troubled you press into
[58:27] that because you need it for maturity
[58:29] you you don't run off into fanaticism
[58:33] but there's no place the blessing was
[58:36] taken out
[58:38] I mean the instruction and the wisdom of
[58:42] knowing to not go off in air because the
[58:44] presence of the Lord is being poured out
[58:47] on make Believers and unbelievers didn't
[58:50] mean that the believer can't enter into
[58:51] the blessing
[58:53] I mean
[58:55] Shake yourself because you can't live
[58:56] without the water
[58:58] it the maturing of the seed requires the
[59:01] outpouring of the spirit it's all in
[59:03] season but just as the church we're not
[59:06] all in the same season
[59:08] I mean there's there's babes that some
[59:10] of us got a lot of green in us and we
[59:12] need to sit in the presence of the Sun
[59:13] and be matured we need to be baked and
[59:17] there needs to be a men being men and
[59:21] and but and there's but there's also
[59:23] sincere milk and and there really isn't
[59:26] the time that we should have to be
[59:28] giving sincere milk but if you need an
[59:31] outpouring of the Lord to mature in
[59:32] Christ
[59:33] pray the Lord will bless you but be
[59:37] rooted and established in the word of
[59:39] God so that you don't have to uh in the
[59:44] absence of it
[59:46] when it doesn't feel like there's
[59:48] anything
[59:50] there's a deep
[59:52] there's a faith
[59:54] that can call the things that are as
[59:55] though they are not that can say on
[59:58] Earth as it is in heaven because we're
[1:00:01] we're calling for heaven we have a
[1:00:03] kingdom that we're Desiring to manifest
[1:00:06] the righteousness where there's a
[1:00:08] humility where the chairmans have to
[1:00:11] cover their feet
[1:00:12] holy holy holy what is our life
[1:00:16] declaring what is the influence we're
[1:00:18] declaring and there's
[1:00:20] you're a vessel
[1:00:23] you're dependent on uh being filled
[1:00:28] and if you're not filled up with the
[1:00:31] spirit of God something some influence
[1:00:33] is going to fill you
[1:00:35] there there has to be a consciousness of
[1:00:38] a keeping your mind stayed on the Lord
[1:00:41] abiding in him and if you can't keep
[1:00:44] your thoughts there's an inspiration and
[1:00:46] a spirit to grab you a good one the Holy
[1:00:50] Spirit can grab you and inspire you
[1:00:52] around the things of God and keep your
[1:00:54] mind stayed on him doesn't have to be
[1:00:56] dry academic you know like you're trying
[1:00:59] to recite a Psalm and you know that's
[1:01:01] good but let the inspiration let the
[1:01:03] life of it he the it's where the word is
[1:01:07] the spirit is there to brood out over it
[1:01:09] it's a principle of God you've put the
[1:01:11] word before you in the presence of God
[1:01:13] is going to come and Quicken that word
[1:01:15] to life
[1:01:16] and it it's
[1:01:20] it's beautiful because even the Earth in
[1:01:22] the way it was formed was always that
[1:01:25] the Holy Spirit had to brood out over
[1:01:28] and the Glorious thing is is there
[1:01:31] should be no question that we where we
[1:01:34] are at is in God's provided place where
[1:01:37] and where he brought his word
[1:01:40] it is where the carcass is the Eagles
[1:01:43] are gathered we've received the message
[1:01:45] for our day the word of God thoroughly
[1:01:48] Vindicated and
[1:01:50] it is our portion to have that
[1:01:53] revelation
[1:01:54] it is our portion to be stimulated when
[1:01:57] we approach the communion table we're
[1:01:59] Desiring Revelation that what the wine
[1:02:02] represents we're going to receive by the
[1:02:04] word of this hour we're going to receive
[1:02:06] a inspiration
[1:02:09] revelation
[1:02:10] of God to the bride to the individual
[1:02:15] but be aware of the voices you know as
[1:02:18] as you're going back to school as you're
[1:02:22] in the workplace
[1:02:25] discern what the intent of that
[1:02:27] influence what it was it meant for and
[1:02:32] that'll help you understand whether or
[1:02:34] not you should receive it I had there's
[1:02:36] an order to Blessing by staying under
[1:02:39] the headship and the blessing of your
[1:02:41] parents when you obey them there's a
[1:02:44] blessing in it
[1:02:46] um I we were at uh
[1:02:48] in and out and
[1:02:50] um
[1:02:52] I was trying to show something on my
[1:02:54] cell phone
[1:02:56] and the Young Brother
[1:02:58] was like not going to look at it I'm
[1:03:00] like well it's just this statistic here
[1:03:02] you know this is the way this app works
[1:03:04] and it's really cool why don't you look
[1:03:06] at he's like no
[1:03:07] not looking at it I'm like why well my
[1:03:11] parents said I shouldn't be looking at
[1:03:12] the cell phones
[1:03:14] of other people and you know what
[1:03:16] there's a blessing in that I think of
[1:03:18] the wisdom and the instruction
[1:03:21] that was in that
[1:03:22] and you may not understand something but
[1:03:25] if you're obedient to it
[1:03:29] there's a blessing in it
[1:03:33] but when the inspiration strikes
[1:03:37] be faithful be faithful and little and
[1:03:40] when the
[1:03:42] he sees that
[1:03:44] and the blessings on its way because you
[1:03:46] put the word of God first you put it in
[1:03:49] your heart but there's a blessing coming
[1:03:51] the rain is going to be poured out upon
[1:03:53] it
[1:03:55] amen
[1:03:59] the uh
[1:04:01] the admonishment and there's a lot to it
[1:04:04] but I want to just bring this home and
[1:04:06] it may be the more mature portion to it
[1:04:10] but I do believe that in this day we've
[1:04:14] been given to eat meat
[1:04:16] and uh
[1:04:17] just ask the Lord to bless this portion
[1:04:20] of it but it's in the trying to do God
[1:04:23] as service without it being its will
[1:04:25] brother Brandon would lay out these
[1:04:26] principles of how the presence of God is
[1:04:29] outpoured and how David was even
[1:04:30] inspired
[1:04:32] and he had a revelation and I just want
[1:04:35] to to share this because it's an
[1:04:37] instruction to us as men of God as
[1:04:40] children of God that we should be
[1:04:44] um
[1:04:45] always willing to check up with this
[1:04:48] message
[1:04:49] and not think more of ourselves than we
[1:04:52] ought
[1:04:53] and if you can't do that
[1:04:58] you know the Zeal of this age is to
[1:05:00] repent
[1:05:02] and if it's not in you to repent then
[1:05:04] you're not his child
[1:05:06] so the word is meant to divide
[1:05:09] um but I
[1:05:11] believe we're all the children of God
[1:05:13] here and we're not lifting up our own
[1:05:15] personal Revelations our own personal
[1:05:17] inspiration beyond what the prophet of
[1:05:19] this hour brought
[1:05:21] but um there's a portion that has to be
[1:05:24] said to those things
[1:05:31] trying to find a place to start on this
[1:05:34] but now is the bride calling now is when
[1:05:37] the Seven Seals has been open now when
[1:05:40] we compare things that the reformers
[1:05:42] left has to be opened and only Malachi 4
[1:05:45] can do that because it takes the
[1:05:48] Revelation straight from God to an
[1:05:51] individual to do so that's right it came
[1:05:54] it can't come to a group never did one
[1:05:57] man that's what God promised in the
[1:06:00] shadows of the coming of his bride and
[1:06:03] Eliezer
[1:06:05] notice when the priest ministers and so
[1:06:07] forth get their own inspiration and
[1:06:09] truly anointed David was anointed the
[1:06:12] Bible said so but you see he went
[1:06:14] through the wrong resource he went to
[1:06:16] the wrong Channel he channeled his
[1:06:18] anointing in the wrong side to the
[1:06:20] people and what they thought to the
[1:06:23] captains what they thought instead of
[1:06:26] God's holy channel to find out what thus
[1:06:29] saith the Lord was is this the time for
[1:06:33] this is this the season for this is this
[1:06:36] the will of God then
[1:06:39] if he's a true prophet of God he'll go
[1:06:42] before God first say father what is it
[1:06:45] like Nathan did later on to David
[1:06:50] and look as Nathan said David do all
[1:06:53] that's in your heart for God is with you
[1:06:55] your anointed vessel of God
[1:06:58] and I think we can all qualify
[1:07:03] we're anointed vessels of God
[1:07:06] you are vessels I mean even we'll we'll
[1:07:10] leave it on the vessels of Honor but one
[1:07:13] way or another you're an anointed vessel
[1:07:16] then came Nathan with thus saith the
[1:07:19] Lord David the great Revelation you had
[1:07:22] is wrong as it was when you brought up
[1:07:25] the ark uh oh see don't you do it don't
[1:07:29] try it but God said he'll have your son
[1:07:31] do it there there you are and David was
[1:07:34] a man after God's Own Heart and it is an
[1:07:37] encouragement as we approach the
[1:07:38] communion table
[1:07:43] if you're inspired there's one thing
[1:07:45] that God will be faithful to as as the
[1:07:49] son of God
[1:07:50] if you've been with a good heart and a
[1:07:53] good intent and you've tried to go
[1:07:54] forward in the Lord
[1:07:57] the word will come and correct you if
[1:07:58] you're an heir
[1:08:00] he's faithful to that
[1:08:03] the Zeal is to repent
[1:08:07] and so he he hasn't left you he hasn't
[1:08:10] forsaken you
[1:08:11] it's
[1:08:13] but I'll tell you one thing if there was
[1:08:16] air in my heart
[1:08:18] and it was only going to manifest what
[1:08:21] if I was anointed
[1:08:23] Lord anoint me so I could repent so the
[1:08:27] air could be made manifest so I could be
[1:08:29] quick and have a Zeal and say Lord take
[1:08:33] this from me
[1:08:34] but sit and dry
[1:08:37] you ain't gonna Bloom you ain't in a Bud
[1:08:39] you're just gonna sit there and not have
[1:08:42] the presence of the Lord move upon you
[1:08:48] no
[1:08:49] let's let the Lord have his way let him
[1:08:53] manifest what's in our heart because as
[1:08:55] a Son of God he's going to prune he's
[1:08:57] going to he's going to shape you he's
[1:08:59] going to make sure you bring forth more
[1:09:01] fruit and it's going to be to his glory
[1:09:03] but
[1:09:06] um
[1:09:06] don't think just because
[1:09:09] the presence of the Lord was outpoured I
[1:09:12] I would even say this
[1:09:14] when the Lord moves as a Son of God I
[1:09:17] think there's always a challenge to come
[1:09:19] up higher
[1:09:21] always
[1:09:22] there's no way you come into the
[1:09:24] presence of a righteous God and not have
[1:09:26] a desire to be more like him
[1:09:31] and that's because there's a seed in
[1:09:34] there crying for manifestation
[1:09:38] and that's the mark of a believer
[1:09:41] so I just encourage your hearts as you
[1:09:44] you know seek Revelation but it has to
[1:09:47] be according to God's Channel it has to
[1:09:49] be according to God's provided way
[1:09:51] humble yourselves before God he'll exalt
[1:09:54] you the admonishment that comes later on
[1:09:57] in Deuteronomy
[1:09:59] I'm going to just read that
[1:10:01] because it
[1:10:03] don't want to leave this off
[1:10:05] it's a same chapter 4 and verse 24 he
[1:10:08] says for the Lord God is a consuming
[1:10:10] fire even a jealous God
[1:10:15] you know that jealousy often is put in a
[1:10:18] in a very negative connotation
[1:10:21] and especially in modern society the
[1:10:23] things that it provokes the thing but
[1:10:25] God's a jealous God he desire he wants
[1:10:29] you to himself and not another he
[1:10:31] doesn't want you in another field he
[1:10:33] doesn't want you seeking after uh other
[1:10:37] following letting diminishing his
[1:10:39] Commandments
[1:10:41] but he's a he's a jealous God
[1:10:45] when thou shalt beget children and
[1:10:47] children's children and ye shall have
[1:10:50] remained long in the land and shall
[1:10:53] corrupt yourselves and make graven
[1:10:55] images or the likeness of anything and
[1:10:57] shall do evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:10:59] thy God to provoke him to anger I call
[1:11:03] on Heaven and Earth to witness to you
[1:11:04] this day that ye shall soon utterly
[1:11:06] perish from off the land wherein to ye
[1:11:09] go over to Jordan to possess it you
[1:11:11] shall not prolong your days upon it but
[1:11:14] shall utterly be destroyed
[1:11:17] there's the warning there's the judgment
[1:11:19] and where does it come it comes after a
[1:11:22] sojourning it comes after there's a
[1:11:25] begetting of children and we're to the
[1:11:27] point where we being raised in the
[1:11:29] message we're being raised in a
[1:11:31] beautiful land a Promised Land a
[1:11:33] provided place and that is when it would
[1:11:36] behoove you to not start to diminish the
[1:11:38] Commandments
[1:11:39] okay
[1:11:43] call it a clothesline gospel if you want
[1:11:45] don't diminish the Commandments we don't
[1:11:49] need to go through them
[1:11:51] but if you notice they're diminishing
[1:11:53] you're about to lose your blessing but
[1:11:55] this is the this is the grace
[1:12:01] but if this isn't 29
[1:12:04] but if from thence Thou shalt seek the
[1:12:08] Lord thy God Thou shalt find him
[1:12:12] if thou seek him with all thine heart
[1:12:14] and one follow thy soul
[1:12:17] when that art in Tribulation and all
[1:12:20] these things are come upon me
[1:12:23] even under the latter days
[1:12:25] if thou turn to the Lord thy God and
[1:12:27] shalt be obedient unto his voice
[1:12:32] for the Lord thy God is merciful god
[1:12:37] he will not forsake thee
[1:12:39] neither destroy thee
[1:12:42] nor forget the Covenant of thy fathers
[1:12:45] which he swear unto them
[1:12:51] that provided places this message we're
[1:12:54] resting under those wings
[1:12:57] you all and we should be so thankful for
[1:13:00] that
[1:13:02] God bless you
[1:13:13] what a beautiful
[1:13:16] thought in
[1:13:18] not diminishing the word of God
[1:13:21] and even in our communion scriptures
[1:13:23] that Matthew will read for us he says
[1:13:26] happy are you if you do these things
[1:13:29] amen amen so what a what a wonderful
[1:13:34] thing we certainly need the spirit of
[1:13:36] the Lord don't we
[1:13:38] in fact he's that's why he sent the Holy
[1:13:40] Spirit I will not leave you comfortless
