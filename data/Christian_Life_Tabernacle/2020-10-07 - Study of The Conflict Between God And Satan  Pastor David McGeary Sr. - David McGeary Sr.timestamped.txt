[37:51] bef the starter service this evening if
[37:54] you'll turn in your bibles to joshua
[37:57] the 24th chapter the 14th and the 15th
[38:00] verse
[38:01] uh we're going to start our service this
[38:05] evening
[38:06] by listening to about 24 minutes
[38:10] of the conflict between god
[38:13] and satan the conflict and if you
[38:17] you have your phone i um
[38:20] i think that you can um
[38:25] look it up on your phone if you want to
[38:27] read along in french
[38:30] or spanish or i don't know how many
[38:33] languages
[38:34] that are available but uh i i think if
[38:38] you just
[38:38] listen to this and my prayer tonight
[38:42] is that we don't uh
[38:46] try to interpret it we don't
[38:52] try to remember what we heard before
[38:56] but as i thought as i listened to this i
[38:58] thought lord i want to
[39:00] to receive what was on brother branham's
[39:04] heart
[39:05] when he was preaching it and not not the
[39:08] doctrinal truth but
[39:10] also the heart part of it you know what
[39:12] it what did he meant
[39:14] when he said said that what was in his
[39:17] thing and just
[39:18] so 24 minutes i think it'll be a
[39:21] a blessing to you and then when he's
[39:25] done
[39:25] reading the scripture you can certainly
[39:30] take your seat
[39:33] and it would be
[39:37] just after the reading of scripture
[39:39] we'll listen to that and then we'll make
[39:41] a
[39:42] few comments tonight so
[39:45] god bless you as we listen to
[39:48] the messenger as he brings the message
[39:50] to us
[39:52] the conflict between uh god
[39:56] and satan so if there is a conflict
[39:59] between god and satan
[40:01] it's obviously we're going to find
[40:03] ourselves
[40:04] in conflict amen god bless you tonight
[40:08] as we
[40:08] listen to this 24 minutes
[40:12] now we want to turn for just a few words
[40:16] tonight out of the bible found over in
[40:19] the book of joshua
[40:21] 24 14 verse
[40:24] and 15th verse i want to read from his
[40:26] word
[40:28] listen close to his word
[40:32] joshua 24 14 and 15.
[40:36] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[40:40] him
[40:40] in sincerity and in truth
[40:44] and put away the gods which your father
[40:48] served on the other side of the flood
[40:53] and in egypt
[40:56] and serve ye the lord
[41:00] and if it seems evil unto you to serve
[41:03] the lord
[41:06] choose you this day whom you will serve
[41:10] whether the gods which your father
[41:12] served
[41:13] that were on the other side of the flood
[41:18] are the gods of the amorites
[41:23] in whose land you dwell but as
[41:26] for me and my house we'll serve the lord
[41:30] amen lord bless the reading of
[41:34] his scriptures i have
[41:37] some notes here that i would like to
[41:40] talk just a little bit
[41:41] from and i want to take a text tonight
[41:44] to call it
[41:45] the conflict the conflict between
[41:50] god and satan
[41:54] and now just to teach it like a sunday
[41:57] school lesson
[41:58] but i've got several scriptures laying
[42:01] here
[42:04] in eden god knew his
[42:07] enemy and all the attacks of his enemy
[42:12] a god is the infinite god
[42:16] and the infinite god
[42:19] is the perfection of the perfections
[42:23] he knew all things before they ever was
[42:27] and therefore if this
[42:30] infinite god could have
[42:35] looked forward and did and seen the end
[42:38] from the beginning
[42:40] and knew that he would have children on
[42:43] this earth
[42:44] his own blessed children
[42:48] don't you believe that he would provide
[42:50] for them the best that he could provide
[42:55] would not you tonight to your children
[42:58] that was helpless little fellows who
[43:00] can't take care of themselves
[43:02] don't you struggle and work and do
[43:06] everything that you can to provide the
[43:09] best that you can or able to provide for
[43:11] those children
[43:13] because you are a father
[43:16] a parent and if that being
[43:20] the the
[43:23] what i would say the
[43:27] the trueness and the thought
[43:31] of an earthly parent in parenthood
[43:34] originated in god because he was the
[43:37] first parent don't you think that
[43:40] god seeing what satan would be
[43:45] what satan would do
[43:49] he gave to his children
[43:53] and provided for them the best
[43:56] thing that could be provided for them to
[44:00] knowing what the enemies attacked would
[44:03] be
[44:03] god fortified his children
[44:08] we take the war when a general goes out
[44:12] to meet another general in war
[44:16] and uh this general if he's a real true
[44:20] citizen of this nation that he
[44:22] represents
[44:24] and he surely would be to be a general
[44:28] and uh the first thing he studies
[44:31] the enemy's attacks
[44:35] he knows what he's going to do how he's
[44:37] going to
[44:38] work because he kind of went over and
[44:42] spied out we got spies everywhere you
[44:45] know
[44:46] these american spies in england these
[44:48] american spies in france says america
[44:50] and the german spies here and is no
[44:53] matter how friendly we are we still got
[44:55] spies
[44:58] and we're spying out some kind of a
[45:01] nuclear weapon
[45:02] then we find it take it back to the
[45:04] country then what it is
[45:06] they get ready when war does come they
[45:09] know how to
[45:10] attack their enemy
[45:14] and if we know god knew this great
[45:16] warfare was coming
[45:18] on between right and wrong and he knew
[45:20] what the enemy is going to do he know
[45:22] just exactly how to equip
[45:24] his people amen
[45:30] so if we notice
[45:34] the very first thing that
[45:37] god equipped his children was being
[45:40] infinite
[45:41] he know what it taught to defeat satan
[45:45] any place anywhere on any conditions
[45:48] now he wouldn't say i'll give him
[45:50] something here
[45:52] and then a few years later i may study
[45:55] out something better to give him
[45:58] and uh then after a few years later like
[46:00] we in military force
[46:02] old bow and arrow and sledge rock hammer
[46:05] and
[46:06] then the next was the after the bow and
[46:08] arrow come the musket and after the
[46:09] musket come the
[46:10] spring feeling and now the atomic
[46:14] weapons and things
[46:15] see we keep growing more but god
[46:18] at the beginning gave his children the
[46:20] atomic weapon
[46:23] because he's an infinite god
[46:27] now seeing there was going to be a
[46:30] conflict
[46:31] and there was going to be a battle
[46:35] god equipped his children with the right
[46:37] kind
[46:38] of ammunition right kind of a attack
[46:43] the right kind of everything that they
[46:45] had need of
[46:46] that would sweep them all the way from
[46:48] eden to the rapture amen
[46:50] right what was it the word
[46:53] amen the word
[46:57] that's what defeats satan is the word
[47:00] it'll defeat him anywhere any place now
[47:04] why do we want to substitute something
[47:05] else
[47:07] when we've already got the best thing
[47:08] that there is
[47:11] the word and we find jesus on earth
[47:15] just to prove this was the best
[47:17] equipment when satan come
[47:19] in hand-to-hand combat with jesus
[47:24] he never just reached over with his
[47:26] power and tied his hands
[47:28] he just took the same weapon that god
[47:31] gave in the garden of eden
[47:32] his word and said it's written amen it's
[47:35] written
[47:36] and he punched him right out of the ring
[47:38] with it that's right
[47:40] because it's god's best
[47:43] and look where it is it's not just for
[47:46] one or two in a church it's for every
[47:49] one of us
[47:51] every believer has a right to take this
[47:54] word
[47:54] and fight the enemy anywhere you meet
[47:56] him anywhere you meet the enemy
[47:58] this word is what you have to use
[48:01] and jesus proved it when he come so he
[48:05] equipped his children
[48:06] with the word for their protection
[48:09] against the enemy
[48:11] when the all-out warfare comes in the
[48:14] battles and
[48:15] uh centenary then there's only one thing
[48:17] a real soldier can use a real christian
[48:19] soldier that's
[48:20] thus said the lord amen walk right out
[48:23] there and meet the enemy
[48:25] with the assurance that nothing thousand
[48:28] may fall at you right in ten thousandths
[48:29] at the left but it won't come naughty
[48:31] amen just remember that god made
[48:35] this statement and give this to his
[48:38] children
[48:39] that's the best that's ever been yet
[48:43] satan in eden when he first come to
[48:45] these attacks
[48:47] to attack the person knowing the
[48:50] children of god
[48:51] was fortified with this word
[48:55] satan attacked the word
[48:59] see he never attacked the bee
[49:03] he attacked the word first amen
[49:06] look at that sneaker lizard
[49:09] what he does today the first thing he
[49:12] can't lay it on saying
[49:13] well that's not a good person that's a
[49:15] good person see
[49:16] but the only thing he tries to do no
[49:18] matter how good the person is
[49:20] is to get him to deny that word amen
[49:22] that's the only thing he wants to do get
[49:24] you to deny that word
[49:28] so satan tried to
[49:31] to attack the word in the garden of eden
[49:35] so he had to have
[49:36] something now that he could use to
[49:40] to the human being would look better
[49:42] than that word
[49:44] see he had to have something that would
[49:46] look better to the human being than word
[49:49] and you know what he used reasoning
[49:53] just what would say common sense
[49:57] so that's what he used and he succeeded
[50:01] amen so that's what he's used all along
[50:05] but god can't give nothing else but his
[50:07] word because that's what he chose
[50:10] first and when god makes a decision it
[50:12] has to ever remain that way
[50:14] amen and satan took reasonings
[50:17] and took the reasonings and attacked the
[50:19] word and
[50:21] shook eve off the path that's right
[50:24] by reasoning human reasoning
[50:27] now the only way he she
[50:30] could uh got to disbelieve god's word
[50:34] it had to be appealing
[50:38] and satan knows how to make reasonings
[50:40] appealing
[50:42] it has to appeal to you and sin is very
[50:46] appealing
[50:47] and there's only one sin and that's
[50:49] unbelief
[50:50] so it's really appealing
[50:54] satan makes sin so appealing to you
[50:59] just stop in here for a few minutes i've
[51:02] often thought as a young man and
[51:05] read about a different nations and
[51:08] the morals of the country and i've heard
[51:10] different people tell me about
[51:12] uh especially in down in france
[51:16] down in the place called pig alley
[51:19] and how that the people were so immoral
[51:23] well i thought if i ever go in there
[51:26] i'll
[51:26] see them people down there women coming
[51:30] out you know
[51:31] reprobates with such a old haggy
[51:36] look you know and mean
[51:39] and i went down in big alley
[51:42] the first night me and three more
[51:44] ministers
[51:46] brother what a surprise we got now
[51:49] satan's too smart for that he isn't
[51:52] going to produce something like that
[51:55] but some of the prettiest girls i ever
[51:57] seen in my life was there
[51:59] appealing certainly
[52:03] sin is appealing and attractive
[52:09] satan hasn't got a fork in hooves in a
[52:12] in a pointed tail and and like that
[52:16] he is an old john barley corn out with
[52:18] coat hanging up
[52:20] and ears hanging down he's a slicker
[52:25] appealing sin isn't just
[52:28] rude like you think it is it's very
[52:31] appealing
[52:35] therefore we have to watch it close
[52:37] we'll just get to that in a little bit i
[52:39] thought of something else so uh
[52:43] how satan makes it look so real
[52:46] it's appealing to them but
[52:49] if they would have just stayed fortified
[52:52] with the word
[52:54] let the word be their fortress
[52:58] then see if they've been fortified
[53:02] they've been
[53:02] behind the word
[53:06] the word would been in front of them
[53:08] always thus saith the lord
[53:10] thus saith the lord thus saith the lord
[53:13] right or left thus saith the lord like
[53:16] those angels down there that day when
[53:18] isaiah
[53:19] met in the temple he thought he was
[53:21] getting along pretty good a fairly good
[53:22] preacher
[53:23] the king liked him real well but the
[53:25] king was taken from him one day
[53:27] and he knelt at the altar and fell into
[53:29] a vision and saw
[53:30] angels with wings over their faces nor
[53:33] their feet and flying with
[53:35] two wings a singing holy holy holy
[53:38] lord god almighty amen every which
[53:42] way they went ezekiel saw the
[53:45] picture of the vision this way the
[53:49] spirit of god was moving it had the face
[53:52] of an ox
[53:53] this way it had the face of a line and
[53:56] everywhere it went it had a face every
[54:00] where it went it was 45.
[54:04] the word of god there's no way around
[54:07] fortified all the way around everywhere
[54:09] thus saith the lord
[54:10] just saith the lord you're walking
[54:13] you're talking your business you're
[54:15] associating
[54:16] everything the word of god first
[54:19] amen so i'll leave i'll go
[54:23] tonight and this little dance this won't
[54:25] hurt anybody
[54:26] could you take thus saith the lord with
[54:29] you
[54:31] i believe if i could pull this little
[54:33] deal or just a little bit shady but
[54:36] could you say
[54:36] thus saith the lord with it always take
[54:40] him first keep fortified
[54:42] for he is our fortress
[54:45] it's strange but do you know you have to
[54:50] ignore before
[54:53] in order to believe the devil's lie
[54:56] you have to ignore and deny god's truth
[55:00] first before you can believe the devil's
[55:01] life
[55:01] amen you ever think of that
[55:05] you have to deny the truth first before
[55:09] you can believe a lie
[55:10] amen right after the night
[55:14] eve got from behind it and lost the
[55:17] battle
[55:18] as soon as eve satan was standing out
[55:22] there
[55:23] shooting these targets she said but the
[55:25] lord said
[55:28] and then he shot again she said but the
[55:31] lord said so then he shot again another
[55:35] way
[55:36] but the lord said but satan raised up
[55:39] back there said
[55:40] but wait just a minute if the lord did
[55:43] say that let me just
[55:45] tell you something you see you're not
[55:48] wise like god you don't know right from
[55:51] wrong
[55:52] but if listen wouldn't you love to be
[55:55] wise like god
[55:58] why eve said yes i i
[56:01] i believe i would maybe something like
[56:03] that i believe i
[56:04] would like to just know all the wisdom
[56:07] of god i like to know what's right and
[56:08] wrong i don't know
[56:10] well i tell you now she said but but the
[56:13] lord said well but surely
[56:15] you know he's a good god he won't do
[56:16] that see
[56:18] right there she broke the hole through
[56:20] so he could shoot
[56:22] right there she made the wrong stop
[56:25] right there stopped a little bit
[56:29] now let me say something to you
[56:30] christians down here
[56:32] don't you never stop one second for the
[56:34] devil
[56:36] don't stop to reason it out when you
[56:38] start to reason it
[56:40] the devil comes right in you cannot
[56:43] reason god
[56:44] you cannot understand god you've got to
[56:48] just
[56:48] believe god okay
[56:51] i can't explain god nobody can i can't
[56:54] explain
[56:55] many things but the only thing i just
[56:57] believe it because he said so
[56:59] amen now there's none of us can explain
[57:03] it don't try to explain it
[57:05] don't get with these unbelievers and say
[57:06] well now look your pastor out there
[57:08] junior i hear him pray for the sick
[57:10] now you all crazy down there there's no
[57:12] such thing as divine healing say
[57:13] all right there isn't for you then
[57:15] you're an unbeliever and just walk right
[57:16] on
[57:18] it's just for believers hey don't well
[57:21] you all say you got the holy ghost
[57:22] there's no such thing as holy ghost said
[57:24] it isn't for you than it is for me
[57:26] just go on see see don't read don't try
[57:28] to reason it hasn't got no reasoning
[57:31] you just believe it you don't reason a
[57:33] thing
[57:34] because remember the only way that you
[57:37] can accept god
[57:39] is by faith amen not by reasons not by
[57:42] understanding not able to explain you
[57:44] don't explain nothing you believe
[57:46] something amen
[57:47] not what you feel jesus never said did
[57:50] you feel it
[57:51] he said did you believe it that's right
[57:54] you just believe what god said i can't
[57:57] explain to you
[57:58] how the how could a the greatest miracle
[58:01] that i could think of
[58:03] is a man who is like take a pig
[58:06] and tell that peak you know you're no
[58:09] more a pig
[58:10] you are a lamb and he becomes a lamb
[58:14] that'd be hard to believe well it's the
[58:16] same thing takes place when you become
[58:18] converted from a sinner to a christian
[58:21] see it changes your own opinions
[58:24] it changes your own will it changes
[58:27] everything that's in you
[58:29] and it brings you into another life and
[58:31] gives you another spirit
[58:33] that bears forth another record
[58:36] see then your old life has to die
[58:40] and the new one has to be born again and
[58:43] then
[58:43] see you're no more the creature you was
[58:45] at all
[58:47] that's when you become behind the blood
[58:50] fortified with the word don't try to
[58:53] explain nothing
[58:54] just believe it and go on
[58:57] lord i believe savior raise my
[59:00] faith in thee till it can move them out
[59:02] amen the heart i believe for all my
[59:04] doubts are buried in the fountain
[59:06] what if abraham had been asked the
[59:08] doctors that come said abraham
[59:10] you're 100 years old
[59:14] your wife is 90. how are you going to
[59:16] have a baby now abraham say well i'll
[59:19] tell you
[59:20] it's like this you see there's going to
[59:22] be a time that we're going to drink a
[59:24] certain thing and
[59:25] this is going to do this and this kind
[59:27] of changes abraham couldn't explain that
[59:30] amen abraham would have said something
[59:32] that i i
[59:33] don't know i don't know any more about
[59:36] it than you know
[59:37] the only thing that i'm resting on is he
[59:39] said we would have it
[59:40] and i'm looking for it said yes sir
[59:44] that's older it takes just take it
[59:47] believe it
[59:48] god said so and that that settles the
[59:50] whole thing
[59:51] because god said it now
[59:55] we find out eve losing the battle she
[59:58] got from behind the word raised up on
[1:00:01] top of the trance and say
[1:00:03] yeah don't say sorry is that the truth
[1:00:06] she's lost right there
[1:00:08] well you know we don't teach that over
[1:00:11] our church we believe that what he said
[1:00:12] here
[1:00:13] yeah but listen dear you know better
[1:00:16] than that
[1:00:16] your own common sense would tell you
[1:00:19] that that's not right
[1:00:20] why i heard that people just cry and cry
[1:00:22] what they crying about see
[1:00:24] now i own common sense and show you that
[1:00:26] they're just worked out they're
[1:00:27] emotional
[1:00:28] see if you stop to listen to that
[1:00:32] you've lost the battle if they say oh
[1:00:35] now wait a minute
[1:00:36] your doctor said that that you had tb
[1:00:40] and it's a it's an advanced stage
[1:00:43] there's no way forever you get over that
[1:00:45] tv
[1:00:45] the doctor said there wasn't now don't
[1:00:47] common sense say that
[1:00:49] well if you're going to rely upon
[1:00:51] reasonings
[1:00:52] you might as well make ready to die but
[1:00:55] if you're going to what the lord gave
[1:00:56] the promise and you can believe it
[1:00:59] it changes the whole program now the
[1:01:02] same way it changes is the same way it
[1:01:04] changed for me down there
[1:01:06] i just believe it don't know how done
[1:01:09] but there was a new creature come
[1:01:11] amen i used to i shunned church i
[1:01:14] a guy told me when i used to box with i
[1:01:16] was fighting my 15th
[1:01:18] professional fight down here at
[1:01:20] evansville indiana and hired mclean many
[1:01:22] of you new albany people knew him there
[1:01:24] and i was walking up the street and
[1:01:26] howard was a welder waiting i was
[1:01:27] abandoned wait and i was fighting billy
[1:01:29] frick from huntington west virginia
[1:01:31] had one of the blue suit like this and
[1:01:32] then days i had a little hair
[1:01:34] and i was walking up the street with
[1:01:36] each supper about three o'clock get
[1:01:37] ready for the fight that night
[1:01:39] was going in there to rest and then have
[1:01:40] her hands rap
[1:01:42] and howard said to me he said you know
[1:01:43] what bill i said what said you look like
[1:01:45] a little baptist preacher
[1:01:49] and he could have called me anything i'd
[1:01:50] never i turned around i said now wait a
[1:01:52] minute howard
[1:01:54] now you laugh when you say that
[1:01:57] is he about that high flies ready to
[1:01:59] climb right on him
[1:02:01] i want nothing to do with no preacher
[1:02:04] and now the greatest compliment that he
[1:02:06] could have given me
[1:02:08] oh when somebody said brother raymond
[1:02:10] you look like a preacher i say praise
[1:02:12] god
[1:02:13] say that see what's the matter
[1:02:16] i and died a new creature
[1:02:20] amen how did i do it i took his word
[1:02:23] brother branham what kind of medicine
[1:02:25] what formula did you take i didn't take
[1:02:27] any
[1:02:28] how did he do it i don't know
[1:02:32] but anyhow i believed it i never took
[1:02:35] nothing
[1:02:36] i just believed it and he raised me up
[1:02:38] from what i was
[1:02:40] a sinner to a christian he did it
[1:02:42] because of tucky's word
[1:02:44] he'll do the same thing by sickness you
[1:02:47] do the same thing by the baptism the
[1:02:48] holy spirit
[1:02:49] he'll do the same thing by any promise
[1:02:51] he give
[1:02:53] but see what's my subject the conflict
[1:02:56] the conflict satan tries to get you to
[1:02:59] reason about it
[1:03:01] and don't you do it but after you become
[1:03:05] a christian then you are fortified
[1:03:10] by the word and any promise in the word
[1:03:15] amen i was going to say that
[1:03:19] you are when you become a christian
[1:03:22] you're placed behind the word of god
[1:03:26] see now there's your fortress
[1:03:30] safety oh my god amen
[1:03:34] every promise in that is yours amen
[1:03:38] all the thing you have to use this reach
[1:03:40] to get it and go right on with it
[1:03:42] how you know it's going to work i don't
[1:03:43] know how it's going to work explain to
[1:03:44] me i don't know
[1:03:46] the only thing i know that god gave his
[1:03:49] children the best attack that they could
[1:03:52] have
[1:03:53] and the best thing to attack with
[1:03:56] because he knows the working of the
[1:03:58] enemy now let's
[1:04:00] let's diagnose that down like take the
[1:04:02] chemistry the blood or the
[1:04:03] chemistry of water or whatever it is see
[1:04:06] let's
[1:04:06] let's diagnose it down why
[1:04:10] why did he give the word because
[1:04:13] are you ready the word is eternal
[1:04:21] see and if god made
[1:04:25] a promise that is
[1:04:28] eternal and there's nothing nowhere can
[1:04:32] stop it
[1:04:33] amen they couldn't turn ever adam upside
[1:04:37] down and turn it backwards
[1:04:38] could never pierce the word of god one
[1:04:40] little word amen
[1:04:43] because jesus said well heavens and
[1:04:46] earth will pass away but my word shall
[1:04:48] never fail
[1:04:50] that's the best weapon there is it's the
[1:04:53] word
[1:04:54] of the eternal god now what is the word
[1:04:57] of god
[1:04:58] the word of god is god himself
[1:05:02] so god gave the believer himself
[1:05:06] amen
[1:05:21] he's the father and the word is god
[1:05:24] then the word is our father we're born
[1:05:26] by the word
[1:05:28] and he's standing in the forefront for
[1:05:30] his children
[1:05:31] amen there you are
[1:05:35] he's standing out there for his children
[1:05:36] what are we scared about
[1:05:39] the rapture's sure the coming sure
[1:05:43] every blessing that's been promised as
[1:05:45] ours all belongs to us
[1:05:47] now if we kind of slack up and say
[1:05:50] uh satan say come around over on this
[1:05:52] side i'll reason that out with you
[1:05:54] uh-uh you got behind father then see
[1:05:57] don't you do that
[1:05:59] you stay right where father stands right
[1:06:02] where it says
[1:06:02] thus saith father thus said my father
[1:06:06] thus saith my father it's going to
[1:06:09] defeat him
[1:06:10] as sure as the world it's got to all
[1:06:12] right but when you get out from behind
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:15] like eve did the battle's lost
[1:06:18] now poor eve
[1:06:23] she listened she lost your place
[1:06:27] all right and then god
[1:06:30] chose man the holy sport
[1:06:33] and he has ever since that's where
[1:06:37] many times people and these ladies
[1:06:44] you certainly can go uh
[1:06:48] finish the rest of it up but
[1:06:51] uh we just want to just make a few
[1:06:54] comments
[1:06:55] tonight and you hold all that deep in
[1:06:59] your heart
[1:07:00] and so brethren was talking to us about
[1:07:03] the conflict
[1:07:06] between god and satan
[1:07:10] and you know when you have a conflict
[1:07:13] it's because each kingdom
[1:07:17] was offering something when satan went
[1:07:20] to eve you noticed that
[1:07:22] that he was offering her something
[1:07:25] offering her that
[1:07:27] she would be wiser offering her
[1:07:30] uh something and so we we find out that
[1:07:34] the
[1:07:35] the the kingdom uh
[1:07:38] their ef their it's each
[1:07:41] a kingdom offering something and
[1:07:45] today we we see that same conflict and
[1:07:48] we see
[1:07:48] the same kingdom we have a great big uh
[1:07:52] election going on and each side is
[1:07:56] lying about what they're going to offer
[1:07:59] and we so we find that and so we find if
[1:08:02] we look at these two
[1:08:04] kingdoms that conflict is still going on
[1:08:08] today
[1:08:10] satan had a kingdom and he was offering
[1:08:13] and we find out that satan's kingdom
[1:08:16] you know was death sickness he disguised
[1:08:20] his death
[1:08:22] and the sickness with knowledge and
[1:08:24] science and education
[1:08:27] but god said that the day that you eat
[1:08:30] thereof
[1:08:31] is the day you die so his kingdom was
[1:08:34] offering
[1:08:35] eternal life and satan's kingdom was
[1:08:39] offering to eve something that she could
[1:08:42] see and we we just
[1:08:45] realized that something that could be
[1:08:47] seen
[1:08:48] it was a it was a a carnal kingdom
[1:08:53] and when he offered satan when satan
[1:08:56] came to jesus to
[1:08:58] tempt him that's what he offered to
[1:09:04] jesus he showed him
[1:09:07] all the kingdoms of the world he
[1:09:10] showed him something that could be seen
[1:09:13] something that could be
[1:09:14] tasted something that could be touched
[1:09:17] as brother graham said something that
[1:09:19] was extremely appealing
[1:09:21] so he appealed to the senses he appealed
[1:09:25] to
[1:09:25] reasoning but jesus's kingdom
[1:09:28] his kingdom was unseen
[1:09:32] and that's what he said he says my
[1:09:34] kingdom is not
[1:09:35] of this world he said if my kingdom was
[1:09:39] of this world wouldn't my my followers
[1:09:43] wouldn't wouldn't they come to to fight
[1:09:46] for me
[1:09:47] but he wasn't offering a cardinal
[1:09:50] kingdom
[1:09:51] he wasn't offering something that was of
[1:09:54] this world
[1:09:55] because satan's kingdom is is
[1:09:59] manifested in what he has to offer
[1:10:04] so you we've got to see that that
[1:10:08] there as brother branham said there's
[1:10:10] only
[1:10:11] god only had one weapon
[1:10:15] from his kingdom and that's his word
[1:10:18] and satan's kingdom he tries to disguise
[1:10:22] it
[1:10:23] but it's still death
[1:10:26] it's still frustration it's still
[1:10:29] confusion
[1:10:30] you know and so the only thing that
[1:10:33] satan can do for his kingdom as brother
[1:10:36] branham said in the tape
[1:10:37] is satan discredits the word of promise
[1:10:42] because the word is the only thing
[1:10:45] that proves the reality of the unseen
[1:10:49] kingdom okay now
[1:10:52] we're we're talking about something that
[1:10:56] satan has a kingdom and his reality is
[1:11:00] what you can see
[1:11:02] what you can hear what you can taste
[1:11:05] but the wages of sin
[1:11:09] is death you just talk about
[1:11:13] it any way that you want the everything
[1:11:17] that satan has the final
[1:11:20] end of it is death
[1:11:24] this great rock and roll star i saw the
[1:11:28] article today i i don't know what
[1:11:31] uh he who he played for i guess he
[1:11:34] played a guitar
[1:11:36] i guess he was famous i guess he might
[1:11:38] have
[1:11:39] accomplished great things in the
[1:11:42] quote-unquote music
[1:11:43] of rock and roll but
[1:11:46] they're going to bury him
[1:11:50] because that kingdom is
[1:11:53] a kingdom of death because
[1:11:57] he said the day that you eat thereof
[1:12:00] is the day that you die but god had an
[1:12:04] unseen kingdom so what the lord was
[1:12:08] offering is he was offering eternal life
[1:12:12] and that's what his kingdom is it's
[1:12:14] eternal life
[1:12:15] but because it's unseen and
[1:12:18] it's not something that you can touch or
[1:12:21] feel or or see his kingdom
[1:12:25] was only seen by
[1:12:28] revelation by
[1:12:32] divine revelation now
[1:12:35] we saw as he began to speak there the
[1:12:38] last things he says is that god
[1:12:40] put a man
[1:12:44] in charge so he gives man
[1:12:48] revelation and he put man in charge
[1:12:51] and so we are uh
[1:12:54] the only proof
[1:12:58] tonight and one he says she said
[1:13:01] eve lost her position
[1:13:05] but faith establishes you a position
[1:13:09] that you see the kingdom you believe
[1:13:12] the kingdom you believe the word of god
[1:13:16] you've taken the weapon
[1:13:17] and you believe it that every promise i
[1:13:20] love what he said
[1:13:21] when you believe it he said you believe
[1:13:23] the word of god you believe it's the
[1:13:25] master of every circumstance it's the
[1:13:28] master of every situation
[1:13:31] it's what will provide for you and take
[1:13:34] care of you
[1:13:35] and and that's the faith
[1:13:38] that you have that brings every promise
[1:13:42] in the word of god to pass because you
[1:13:45] have the
[1:13:46] revelation that that word
[1:13:50] is true
[1:13:54] any child teenager parent
[1:13:58] adult that knows that this unseen
[1:14:01] kingdom is real
[1:14:04] by revelation and so we've been made
[1:14:09] ambassadors that's what we
[1:14:12] are we're ambassadors of the kingdom of
[1:14:15] god
[1:14:16] to prove to this world that this kingdom
[1:14:20] exists
[1:14:22] and satan his whole thing was to
[1:14:25] to discredit the word of god that's why
[1:14:28] he put it in a religious
[1:14:30] covering he says he believes the word of
[1:14:33] god
[1:14:34] but he denies the power thereof
[1:14:38] he doesn't mind it being taught as a
[1:14:41] teaching he doesn't mind it being taught
[1:14:44] as a doctrine he doesn't mind
[1:14:48] it being taught in any way that
[1:14:51] he he doesn't care as long as he can
[1:14:55] get you out from behind believing
[1:14:58] all of the word of god
[1:15:02] it's what religion is but though he's
[1:15:05] made
[1:15:05] us ambassadors
[1:15:09] other words we are whom that god chose
[1:15:13] to prove that this
[1:15:16] other kingdom exists
[1:15:22] it has to be more than words alone
[1:15:27] because satan's kingdom is
[1:15:30] words
[1:15:34] it's just his words happen to be a lie
[1:15:37] but what did he do she believed satan's
[1:15:41] lies as god's truth
[1:15:43] and that's where mankind sits today they
[1:15:46] believe that their science can keep them
[1:15:49] from dying
[1:15:50] they believe that their education will
[1:15:53] make
[1:15:53] life advanced satan believe it or not is
[1:15:56] still
[1:15:56] looking for eternal life but eternal
[1:15:59] life only lies in one thing and that's
[1:16:02] god's word
[1:16:04] he's the author that's why he gave us he
[1:16:07] said eternal life
[1:16:09] he says he gave us his word because his
[1:16:12] word
[1:16:13] is eternal his word is life
[1:16:17] and life more abundant just think
[1:16:19] tonight you are
[1:16:20] representing an ambassadors of the
[1:16:23] kingdom
[1:16:24] that you will not die
[1:16:28] that's what we're saying
[1:16:31] that this kingdom gave us eternal life
[1:16:36] that's what they said well we're going
[1:16:38] to kill you and we're going to put you
[1:16:40] in a grave
[1:16:41] to prove that your kingdom
[1:16:44] doesn't have life he said you put me in
[1:16:48] that grave and in three days i'll come
[1:16:50] out of that tomb
[1:16:52] we're the only kingdom that points to an
[1:16:55] empty tomb
[1:16:57] so we have to understand that this great
[1:17:01] that that that goes on that satan is
[1:17:05] his kingdom is manifested
[1:17:08] with wars and rumors of war
[1:17:12] it's manifested with graveyards
[1:17:14] everywhere
[1:17:16] it's manifested with new disease all the
[1:17:19] time
[1:17:21] look at all the vaccines vaccines we've
[1:17:24] taken
[1:17:25] look at all the doctors offices
[1:17:29] that we've gone into look at all the
[1:17:31] medicines
[1:17:33] that we have but satan's kingdom just
[1:17:38] come up with a whole new mess you know
[1:17:44] it come up with
[1:17:45] something because they were fooling
[1:17:47] around
[1:17:49] looking for a better weapon looking for
[1:17:51] a better this and now the whole world
[1:17:54] is is under that kingdom
[1:17:59] and it that his kingdom has always
[1:18:01] manifested
[1:18:02] itself always manifested itself but it
[1:18:06] always manifests itself in death
[1:18:09] it can't get away from the
[1:18:13] true fruit of his kingdom
[1:18:17] is death and eternal separation from god
[1:18:21] but god offered eve eternal life they
[1:18:25] had that life
[1:18:28] and they lost their position now we're
[1:18:31] ambassadors
[1:18:34] because our eyes have been opened
[1:18:37] and we've had by revelation he's made to
[1:18:41] us
[1:18:41] his kingdom anew i love what he said he
[1:18:45] said i used to be this way
[1:18:47] but now i'm a new creature in christ
[1:18:50] jesus
[1:18:51] i was ready to fight with that guy
[1:18:53] because he said i look like a baptist
[1:18:56] uh preacher he said now it's the
[1:18:58] greatest thing you can say to me
[1:19:00] what happened something's transpired
[1:19:03] something's taken place
[1:19:06] you you've had a taste of the eternal
[1:19:08] kingdom of god
[1:19:10] you've had a taste of life
[1:19:13] and life more abundant so
[1:19:16] we got to come back to the reality
[1:19:20] that you have
[1:19:24] the proof of the reality
[1:19:28] of the kingdom of god
[1:19:31] you are the ambassadors uh you
[1:19:35] you uh it is given to you
[1:19:38] as an ambassador to
[1:19:41] represent and
[1:19:45] show what your kingdom has to offer
[1:19:50] unless you're part of the other kingdom
[1:19:55] unless you're lukewarm
[1:19:58] and you've mixed the two kingdoms
[1:20:00] together
[1:20:02] that's what denominational does
[1:20:05] that's what uh religious covering it's
[1:20:08] uncovering
[1:20:11] but our kingdom is in direct conflict
[1:20:15] god's kingdom is in direct conflict
[1:20:18] it's a conflict he knew the battle was
[1:20:22] coming
[1:20:24] he knew that satan would get more
[1:20:26] religious
[1:20:27] and more pretty and more scientific
[1:20:30] and have more toys and more games
[1:20:33] and more pleasure because sins of
[1:20:36] healing is attractive
[1:20:39] he's got more and more and more and more
[1:20:41] and more things to offer
[1:20:44] but make sure in your heart that you've
[1:20:47] been
[1:20:47] born again into the kingdom of god
[1:20:52] because he said my kingdom's not of this
[1:20:54] world
[1:20:56] so it's an unseen kingdom
[1:20:59] but yet it's satan's kingdom is
[1:21:03] a kingdom you can see
[1:21:07] and god's unseen satan's kings of a
[1:21:10] kingdom you can touch
[1:21:12] you can taste you can look around you
[1:21:15] and you can see the science you can see
[1:21:18] the education
[1:21:19] you can see the accomplishment like he
[1:21:22] said you look at generals they started
[1:21:24] out with bows
[1:21:27] now they've got atomic bombs
[1:21:30] now they've got weapons i guess from
[1:21:32] what i've heard that
[1:21:33] they can send sonic waves in and
[1:21:37] and sound waves and things that mess
[1:21:40] you up and make you sick they they have
[1:21:43] ways to poison you
[1:21:46] that's that battle but aren't you glad
[1:21:50] that we've got a
[1:21:52] weapon and our weapons every promise of
[1:21:56] the word
[1:21:57] and you're a representative of that
[1:21:59] kingdom how you can approve
[1:22:02] to the people in a carnal kingdom
[1:22:06] that what you're talking about's real
[1:22:12] that you have a spirit
[1:22:15] that that has love and
[1:22:18] joy peace longsuffering
[1:22:22] gentleness goodness godliness you know
[1:22:25] it and it's something that
[1:22:28] that has faith meekness
[1:22:33] something that's real because you have
[1:22:35] us the spirit
[1:22:36] of that kingdom which is the spirit of
[1:22:40] god
[1:22:41] dwelling in you and because you have
[1:22:44] that spirit
[1:22:45] that spirit and the fruits of that
[1:22:47] spirit is faith
[1:22:48] and you're a person that believes every
[1:22:51] promise of god
[1:22:52] but you're not just a people that
[1:22:54] believes every promise of god
[1:22:56] you're the people that's been chosen to
[1:23:00] manifest the word of god
[1:23:06] satan brings sickness what do you bring
[1:23:09] you bring the promises of healing
[1:23:13] as you heard this evening
[1:23:16] when you listen to that tape he was
[1:23:20] drawing in order for there to be a
[1:23:23] conflict there has to be a difference
[1:23:27] there has to be a different picture
[1:23:31] drawn and every army
[1:23:34] has got to have its soldiers
[1:23:39] and so you have the power
[1:23:42] that and the reality to prove
[1:23:46] that the spirit of this kingdom
[1:23:50] is real
[1:23:53] not by talking about
[1:23:56] an unseen kingdom but bringing
[1:24:00] that unseen kingdom into
[1:24:04] reality so who draws the conflict
[1:24:08] you do you are the conflict
[1:24:14] you're the problem
[1:24:19] with satan's kingdom because you're a
[1:24:22] people that don't believe in death
[1:24:26] you believe in life and life more
[1:24:29] abundant
[1:24:30] you believe in eternal reward and you
[1:24:33] can
[1:24:33] only prove the unseen
[1:24:36] kingdom by the manifestation of
[1:24:40] every promise of god's word
[1:24:44] like jesus said my kingdom's not of this
[1:24:47] world
[1:24:48] it came to a rabbi no man could do these
[1:24:52] things
[1:24:52] unless they come from god so
[1:24:56] someplace somewhere
[1:25:00] this conflict this difference between
[1:25:04] these two kingdoms
[1:25:06] has got to manifest someplace
[1:25:09] somewhere someone's got to stand up and
[1:25:12] say
[1:25:13] that's not the truth satan
[1:25:19] and we heard him say it tonight my
[1:25:21] father said
[1:25:23] my father said thus saith the lord
[1:25:26] thus saith the lord he said if you
[1:25:28] believed you had tb
[1:25:30] and you didn't believe that there was a
[1:25:31] god that could heal you may go make
[1:25:33] preparation
[1:25:35] go pick out your casket
[1:25:38] go by your plot of ground i'm going to
[1:25:42] die
[1:25:42] because science said i was going to die
[1:25:45] the kingdom of satan said i'm going to
[1:25:48] die
[1:25:48] but you stand up and say oh no it
[1:25:51] doesn't have to be that way
[1:25:54] i'm an ambassador it doesn't have to be
[1:25:58] that way
[1:25:58] someone is an addiction it doesn't have
[1:26:01] to be that way
[1:26:03] it doesn't have to be the way that the
[1:26:06] enemy says it
[1:26:08] is because i have the word
[1:26:11] of god i just don't have the word of god
[1:26:14] i'm
[1:26:14] fortified by the word of god and the
[1:26:17] word of god
[1:26:18] is he said was god
[1:26:22] that's our substance that's our barrier
[1:26:25] that's our life
[1:26:26] we're here to say that the word of god
[1:26:29] is
[1:26:29] truth and it's
[1:26:33] the way the word of god says it is
[1:26:37] we have an unseen problem solver
[1:26:41] an unseen answer
[1:26:44] that all that we can do is
[1:26:47] manifest it
[1:26:51] what is people's problems you know what
[1:26:55] the problems of the world are it's the
[1:26:58] manifestation
[1:26:59] of satan's kingdom because he caused the
[1:27:02] problems in the garden
[1:27:05] but what did god give us he loved us so
[1:27:08] much
[1:27:09] he sent his only begotten son
[1:27:13] that whoever believed on him he gave
[1:27:16] them
[1:27:17] the power to be the sons
[1:27:21] and daughters of the word
[1:27:25] the sons and daughters of god
[1:27:28] wasn't god the word he said what was the
[1:27:32] word
[1:27:33] it was god himself
[1:27:36] standing out for the believer
[1:27:40] and fortifying them against the kingdom
[1:27:44] so remember what we just heard i know
[1:27:46] we've heard so much
[1:27:47] he says but not only is it our
[1:27:49] fortification
[1:27:51] it's our weapon so when the kingdom
[1:27:55] comes in like a flood the kingdom of
[1:27:57] enemy comes in the flood
[1:27:59] and brings problems to your family
[1:28:03] problems to your life problems to your
[1:28:06] body
[1:28:06] you don't not only have the
[1:28:08] fortification
[1:28:09] of protection but you have the weapon
[1:28:13] of deliverance
[1:28:16] the best thing that god could give us
[1:28:20] was this work not only did he just
[1:28:24] give us his word to hide upon
[1:28:28] but he gave us his word to fight with
[1:28:33] and our kingdom is here to fight
[1:28:37] the kingdom of satan
[1:28:42] he said who will take his sword
[1:28:46] who will take the sword of the word and
[1:28:48] satan
[1:28:49] i've come the kingdom of god
[1:28:52] has come and we've come to stand up
[1:28:56] against your lies
[1:29:01] you're not taking our children
[1:29:04] you're not taking our health you're not
[1:29:07] taking the health of your friends
[1:29:10] when the satan's kingdom declares
[1:29:14] that it's doom and gloom
[1:29:17] and death and there's no
[1:29:20] healing there's no deliverance you're
[1:29:23] stuck
[1:29:25] because that's the fruits of his kingdom
[1:29:27] there's a little ambassador
[1:29:30] that stands up and says it doesn't have
[1:29:33] to be that way
[1:29:37] you have an ambassador that stands up
[1:29:40] and points out the fruits that's
[1:29:43] just the fruit of sin that's just the
[1:29:47] fruits of unbelief that's just what
[1:29:50] happens when you don't believe god's
[1:29:53] word
[1:29:54] but if you could believe on him
[1:29:58] whom the father hath sent there's life
[1:30:02] there's liberty there's healing there's
[1:30:05] eternal life
[1:30:07] all these things are on god's side death
[1:30:10] sickness hell and the grave is all on
[1:30:13] his side
[1:30:14] and we're the ambassadors of god to
[1:30:18] show the conflict
[1:30:21] between these two kingdoms
[1:30:25] to show the difference between these
[1:30:29] two kingdoms and
[1:30:32] each kingdom has to offer something
[1:30:37] and god's kingdom offers
[1:30:40] eternal life
[1:30:44] you're called
[1:30:48] to show the difference you're
[1:30:51] called as to prove that there's another
[1:30:54] kingdom
[1:30:55] exist another solution
[1:30:58] exists another reality exists
[1:31:02] it may not be seen
[1:31:06] but it's real it may be unseen
[1:31:12] except by faith but it's real
[1:31:16] and that's what jesus said my kingdom's
[1:31:18] not of this world
[1:31:21] and that's what we're ambassadors of
[1:31:24] we're the ambassadors
[1:31:26] of the unseen kingdom we're the
[1:31:29] ambassadors
[1:31:30] of the unseen
[1:31:33] benefits let's just don't let his
[1:31:38] reality be the only
[1:31:41] reality that's real don't
[1:31:45] let's not make satan's diagnostics
[1:31:50] the only diagnostics that's real
[1:31:55] don't let his kingdom be the only
[1:31:58] kingdom that's real
[1:32:00] because there's a conflict
[1:32:03] there's another reality there's another
[1:32:06] truth
[1:32:07] and god's got a people that possess
[1:32:11] that kingdom they possess that
[1:32:14] eternal life they possess
[1:32:18] those promises they possess
[1:32:21] the word of truth and they can't stay
[1:32:24] hidden forever
[1:32:29] if they don't come to the forefront
[1:32:32] the sinner the unbeliever
[1:32:36] they only know what they hear
[1:32:39] and they only know what they see
[1:32:42] but there's a people
[1:32:46] that's called chosen
[1:32:50] and elected that have another reality
[1:32:54] that have another spirit that have
[1:32:57] another life
[1:32:58] eternal life so let's stand
[1:33:02] ever true to the things
[1:33:06] that are true don't let
[1:33:09] satan pull you
[1:33:14] outside of that word
[1:33:17] don't let him give you away that's not
[1:33:21] the word way
[1:33:23] stay with the word stay with the truth
[1:33:27] and it'll do you and all
[1:33:30] the people you come in contact with
[1:33:33] it'll do many good things
[1:33:36] for them god bless you tonight let's
[1:33:38] stand together
[1:33:40] aren't you glad you've got
[1:33:43] your beautiful truth oh aren't you glad
[1:33:47] that you have
[1:33:48] what god's given you life and life more
[1:33:52] abundant brother billy if you could come
[1:33:54] and
[1:33:54] lead us in song and worship and
[1:33:58] we'll just bow our heads and pray
[1:34:02] tonight
[1:34:05] there's a great battle
[1:34:09] the battle of reasoning and the battle
[1:34:11] of truth
[1:34:13] and satan always makes sin
[1:34:17] appealing and where would this
[1:34:20] world be if there wasn't a voice
[1:34:23] if there wasn't a gospel if there wasn't
[1:34:27] the reality of god's word
[1:34:29] living in flesh you say lord when
[1:34:33] where am i and who am i
[1:34:37] i'm the reality of god's word
[1:34:40] living in flesh my testimony is
[1:34:43] is that every word of god is true
[1:34:47] and every word of satan's a lie
[1:34:51] i am not going to come out
[1:34:54] from behind the reality of god's living
[1:34:58] word
[1:34:59] it's my fortification it's my
[1:35:02] defense it's my strength
[1:35:07] and not only do i hide
[1:35:11] there as my resting place
[1:35:14] i am called to testify
[1:35:18] of its reality i'm called to testify
[1:35:24] of its fortification
[1:35:28] i'm called to testify of its might
[1:35:33] and its power
[1:35:37] because i know it will help
[1:35:40] others i know it will deliver
[1:35:45] others from the clutch of the lie
[1:35:50] of satan's kingdom and satan's making
[1:35:54] his kingdom look beautiful
[1:35:57] but how come his kingdom's got hospitals
[1:36:00] and
[1:36:00] doctors offices and and
[1:36:03] insurance programs and medicare programs
[1:36:07] and all those
[1:36:08] promises and all those institutions
[1:36:15] to tend to the fruits
[1:36:19] of his kingdom
[1:36:23] how come there are psychiatrists and
[1:36:27] mental health and pills by the
[1:36:30] box loads
[1:36:34] to attend
[1:36:38] the fruits of his kingdom
[1:36:43] how come there's so much crime and
[1:36:46] frustration
[1:36:49] and broken hearts
[1:36:53] so many prisons
[1:36:58] to attend to the fruits
[1:37:02] of his kingdom
[1:37:07] look around have our eyes and hearts
[1:37:11] open the world's not happy it's dying
[1:37:15] it's sick and there's more
[1:37:18] mental sickness and and and broken
[1:37:22] hearts and
[1:37:23] desperations and frustrations
[1:37:26] that's what the world's living in
[1:37:29] but there's a people that have a spirit
[1:37:34] of a new birth
[1:37:38] that are commissioned to go into this
[1:37:40] world
[1:37:42] and tell them there's hope
[1:37:45] there's life there's love
