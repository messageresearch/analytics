[13:28] gracious father lord we're so thankful
[13:31] to be gathering your presence lord and
[13:33] father just lifting up your name and
[13:36] showing your goodness in our lives and

[13:49] of the word father let you just your
[13:51] spirit come and walk in this isles lord
[13:54] to answer the needs of your people lord
[13:56] and father to touch the afflicted to
[13:58] heal the sick and father that's what the
[14:01] gospel is for to bring the good news to
[14:03] us this morning we commit ourselves in
[14:05] the service into your hands and invite
[14:07] you in the name of the lord jesus christ
[14:09] we pray amen
[14:18] good morning
[14:20] let's go ahead and
[14:22] turn to psalm 119 this morning
[14:25] i know about you but i've been enjoying
[14:26] going through
[14:28] this is one of my favorite psalms
[14:30] uh it's a work to read through it but uh
[14:33] i really uh really enjoy it we're gonna
[14:35] turn to uh
[14:37] verse 73 and read that section this
[14:39] morning and as i was reading that this
[14:41] week you know there was a couple
[14:43] statements that stuck out to me
[14:45] as i was reading that unusual statements
[14:47] and in verse 74 as david speaking he
[14:50] says they that fear thee
[14:53] will be glad when they see me
[14:56] because i have hoped in thy word
[14:59] and then once again in verse 79 let
[15:01] those that fear thee
[15:03] turn unto me
[15:05] and those that have known
[15:08] thy testimonies
[15:10] you know they seem like
[15:12] bit odd statements
[15:15] you know is this david asking that
[15:17] you know could i be a center of
[15:19] attention can i be popular
[15:21] you know
[15:23] almost seems like a self-serving or a
[15:25] self-exalting
[15:27] quest
[15:30] you know it seems strange that david
[15:31] would have a desire when we know that
[15:33] very often
[15:34] there's a reproach that comes with this
[15:37] life with this word
[15:39] for one to be asking that people would
[15:40] be attracted to him
[15:44] you know what jesus taught and
[15:46] many times with the disciples john 15 19
[15:48] he said if he were of the world
[15:50] the world would love his
[15:52] own but because you are not of this
[15:55] world but i have chosen you out of the
[15:57] world
[15:58] therefore the world hateth you
[16:02] so we've kind of been taught to expect
[16:04] to find ourselves at odds
[16:07] with a lot of people
[16:09] that the
[16:10] things that we believe the way that we
[16:12] walk are not going to agree with most
[16:14] folks
[16:16] that
[16:17] you know we expect incompatibility
[16:19] with many people around us even family
[16:21] members
[16:23] we expect to bear a reproach
[16:26] for the word
[16:28] so it might seem a bit strange that
[16:30] david is asking for something different
[16:33] but if you look closely at the way he
[16:35] asks this
[16:38] his desire was in spite of the fact that
[16:40] all that might be true
[16:43] that there would be a certain type of
[16:44] person
[16:46] that's attracted to him
[16:48] drawn to him
[16:51] be glad
[16:53] in his presence
[16:55] you know he describes it in verse 79 as
[16:58] they that fear the lord
[17:02] those that have known thy testimonies a
[17:05] special class of people his prayer is
[17:08] that they
[17:09] would be attracted to him
[17:11] and be made glad
[17:15] so because of his relationship with the
[17:17] word it says because i have hoped in thy
[17:19] word
[17:20] because of the relationship he had with
[17:23] the word
[17:26] there might be a certain class of people
[17:28] that would be attracted
[17:31] by him
[17:33] think about that prayer
[17:37] you know there's a maturity in the
[17:39] relationship with the word
[17:41] that takes us
[17:43] beyond separation from the world
[17:46] you know beyond bearing the reproach and
[17:48] those things are part of the walk
[17:51] but there's a maturity
[17:54] that where you get to a place where life
[17:56] begins to attract life yes
[17:59] life begins to impart life
[18:03] you know we know the word has an effect
[18:06] you know jesus describes this the
[18:07] condition as if you abide in me
[18:10] and i abide in you
[18:12] that whole section as jesus is speaking
[18:15] to his disciples in his kind of his last
[18:16] hours
[18:17] about a new way of living a new image
[18:20] being reflected but
[18:22] you know while the word is our anchor or
[18:25] hope there's a maturity that we seek
[18:27] that we desire
[18:29] that ultimately we get to a place where
[18:31] life is attracting life just as all life
[18:33] any life out in even though the the
[18:36] natural world there's a certain point of
[18:38] maturity that they all life reaches
[18:41] where it begins to attract
[18:44] other kinds of life
[18:46] and produce life
[18:48] and it's the same with the maturity with
[18:51] a word
[18:52] relationship
[18:53] there's a point we're able to attract
[18:56] like life
[18:58] and impart
[19:00] life
[19:01] and this was david's prayer
[19:03] you know paul described it in second
[19:05] corinthians of a condition where we have
[19:07] an epistle written in our hearts that
[19:10] are read of all men all men
[19:12] worldly men and godly men
[19:16] you know and second corinthians 4 speaks
[19:18] more of you know the effect of that word
[19:20] just shining a light out of our life
[19:24] with the daily walk that we have
[19:26] manifestation of the truth commending
[19:28] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[19:30] the sight of god
[19:33] that's the calling
[19:35] to get to such a condition with the word
[19:37] that an image is reflected from us
[19:40] that begins to attract
[19:43] life and impart
[19:45] life
[19:47] that was david's prayer lord made though
[19:50] because of my relationship with the word
[19:52] may i get to that place
[19:54] where like life is attracted to me
[19:58] where i'm quickening life to others
[20:00] making them glad
[20:03] you know it says in matthew 5 let your
[20:06] light so shine before men
[20:08] that they may see your good works and
[20:10] glorify your father
[20:12] which is in heaven
[20:14] you know sometimes if we're not careful
[20:17] we confuse witnessing with preaching
[20:20] right we make it all about a preaching
[20:22] activity or we make it more about the
[20:24] work that we do
[20:26] rather than the work he does
[20:30] and
[20:30] the most effective witnessing
[20:33] is when the image
[20:35] of the word
[20:37] is so reflected
[20:38] in your daily life
[20:41] that it begins to attract
[20:44] like life
[20:46] and impart
[20:47] life
[20:48] this was david's prayer
[20:50] more than just you know may i understand
[20:52] the word more
[20:54] more than you know can i get to a
[20:56] theological place more than can i have
[20:59] religious services or operate a church
[21:02] but can i get to a place
[21:04] where i have such a relationship with
[21:06] the word
[21:07] or i've submitted myself to the word to
[21:10] such a such a situation such a
[21:12] relationship that even without me
[21:14] knowing
[21:15] there's an image reflected from me
[21:17] that's attracting a certain kind of life
[21:19] that was david's prayer
[21:22] you know and i i was reading that and
[21:24] thinking lord that's my prayer as well
[21:26] you know it's not unusual for people to
[21:29] question you know what's my purpose
[21:31] what's my ministry what's my goal submit
[21:34] yourself to the word
[21:36] let that word
[21:38] have an effect
[21:39] so that it begins to attract life
[21:43] that's the calling
[21:45] they that fear thee will be glad when
[21:48] they see me
[21:50] because i have hoped in thy word so
[21:52] let's read that section of psalm 119
[21:54] this morning just those eight verses
[21:57] starting at verse 73 thy hands have made
[22:00] me and fashioned me
[22:01] give me understanding that i may learn
[22:04] thy commandments they that fear thee
[22:06] will be glad when they see me because i
[22:10] have hoped in thy word i know o lord
[22:12] that thy judgments are right and that
[22:15] thou and faithfulness has afflicted me
[22:17] let i pray thee thy merciful kindness be
[22:20] for my comfort according to thy word
[22:23] unto thy servant
[22:24] let thy tender mercies come unto me that
[22:27] i may live for thy law is my delight let
[22:30] the proud be ashamed for they dealt
[22:33] perversely with me without a cause but i
[22:36] will meditate in thy precepts let those
[22:39] that fear thee turn unto me and those
[22:41] that have known thy testimonies let my
[22:44] heart be sound and thy statutes that i
[22:46] be not ashamed

[40:22] i'm a little preacher
[40:24] i came i come from angola
[40:29] i am i think this is about the fourth
[40:31] week that i'm here with you
[40:35] can you see us
[40:37] i think this is the second sunday that
[40:39] i've been here we la cement passes the
[40:41] thirteenth cement pokemon uh last week
[40:44] was a very turbulent week a week for me
[40:49] i was a little demoralized
[40:56] on a stream of thinking hello invented
[41:00] there was an inner voice that that that
[41:02] said to me
[41:06] do you remember the the legend of the
[41:10] uh the speckled bird
[41:13] stan
[41:16] the speckled bird was a special vote for
[41:18] barbara
[41:28] during the crucifixion of the lord jesus
[41:30] christ that this bird was trying to
[41:32] remove the nails out of him
[41:35] but when i was born olier said to us
[41:40] instead of that buried for him to to cry
[41:42] again
[41:46] this time he came to sing with great joy
[41:54] it said that you always have to be
[41:56] joyful
[42:01] and that joy that brandon talks about
[42:03] it's not like the joy like you find in
[42:06] the world basket
[42:08] because everybody has joy melancholy
[42:11] but the joy that brother branham is
[42:13] talking about
[42:35] they said i'll be there early morning to
[42:38] pick you up so we can come to church
[42:42] that's the system of the devil
[42:48] he will come and try to take out of you
[42:50] all the unction of the lord jesus
[42:54] christ and what he tries to do is to
[42:57] move you away from your brothers
[43:01] he will keep you away from church
[43:07] but one brother did he told me that he's
[43:09] going to be there to pick me up to come
[43:10] to church
[43:12] and then i was i was really consoled
[43:14] within my soul
[43:19] that's why i want to express my joy with
[43:21] this song
[43:25] yeah this song is in many languages
[43:29] like as i have not uh
[43:31] come to speak english well
[43:36] i'm going to speak i'm going to sing it
[43:38] in portuguese

[43:48] william branham

[1:00:10] father for the great promise that

[1:00:15] work it to your perfect will
[1:00:18] we're so thankful that we can trust in
[1:00:20] your
[1:00:21] wonderful hand this morning we ask you
[1:00:24] to bless us this morning and jesus
[1:00:27] precious and wonderful name we pray
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:31] amen god bless you may be seated this
[1:00:33] morning
[1:00:39] certainly nice to be in the house of the
[1:00:41] lord in it
[1:00:43] amen i was thinking of how
[1:00:45] hot it is outside
[1:00:48] and
[1:00:51] and i just thought you know what we're
[1:00:52] going to a place that's not so hot
[1:00:55] i think what's happening after the
[1:00:57] rapture the lord's going to take all the
[1:00:59] believers from the earth and he's going
[1:01:01] to send everybody else to texas to spend
[1:01:04] the time
[1:01:07] but
[1:01:08] you know
[1:01:09] that's that's just how it is we just
[1:01:11] want to kind of give you a little update
[1:01:13] on things where
[1:01:14] we're you know we're sorry you have to
[1:01:17] deal with the parking
[1:01:18] the way that it is
[1:01:20] um
[1:01:21] i talked with my engineer the other day
[1:01:23] said david he said have courage
[1:01:26] he said you're in the ugly stage
[1:01:29] he says in the ugly stage is the hardest
[1:01:32] and
[1:01:33] and i you know i saw people scraping mud
[1:01:36] off their shoes and and uh you know
[1:01:40] those things so i do recommend
[1:01:42] that if in our present parking
[1:01:45] situations that you might
[1:01:47] uh ladies you might want to wear flats
[1:01:50] versus uh
[1:01:52] those other things that
[1:01:54] i i preach against
[1:01:56] but um
[1:01:58] anyway you've heard the expression being
[1:01:59] stuck in the mud
[1:02:01] well we certainly don't want that to
[1:02:04] happen to you but
[1:02:07] we've we worked out some things i wanted
[1:02:10] to thank all the brothers that came out
[1:02:13] yesterday and put their shoulder to the
[1:02:15] wheel we had some walls that
[1:02:18] we had built over the years
[1:02:21] to keep the water off the neighbors
[1:02:23] property and
[1:02:25] and because of the new configuration and
[1:02:27] the new drainage plan we had to remove
[1:02:30] those walls and everybody just jumped
[1:02:33] right in there and we got those faults
[1:02:35] down and
[1:02:36] and jonathan you look a little tired
[1:02:38] today man
[1:02:40] and were you aching at all the other
[1:02:42] night now you did good
[1:02:44] those blocks are heavy and the brothers
[1:02:46] grabbed them and stacked them and did
[1:02:47] everything so
[1:02:49] i i want to really
[1:02:51] extend my appreciation to you all we'll
[1:02:54] get through it
[1:02:55] and and it's going to be a hard year
[1:02:58] ahead
[1:02:59] um
[1:03:01] we it's going to be a lot of difficulty
[1:03:04] in labor but we've we're we've just
[1:03:06] turned a big corner this weekend
[1:03:09] and
[1:03:10] so i hope maybe in a month or so by the
[1:03:13] grace of god we'll have some of the
[1:03:15] parking lot in and it'll be
[1:03:17] it'll be good for you
[1:03:19] today's father's day and uh so happy
[1:03:22] father's day to everybody
[1:03:25] i'm grateful that
[1:03:27] you know the lord granted me children
[1:03:30] and that they've all found their way to
[1:03:32] the lord
[1:03:34] that's a blessing so good blessing to
[1:03:36] each of you
[1:03:37] also this is the 15th
[1:03:40] anniversary of brother jackson
[1:03:42] being a deacon for us
[1:03:45] for 15 years so we're appreciative of
[1:03:48] that this morning amen so
[1:03:55] i think jackson believes 15 years is
[1:03:58] enough for anybody i said oh well i can
[1:04:00] certainly agree with that i said that's
[1:04:03] how you feel about five years being a
[1:04:05] pastor you know
[1:04:07] but you go on and why why you go on you
[1:04:10] love the people and you love
[1:04:13] what the end of everything's going to be

[1:05:43] and we know we get on the other side of
[1:05:45] the country as you guys have most of you
[1:05:47] guys have seen the
[1:05:48] mission report that we've put together
[1:05:50] and he
[1:05:51] held his arms out and
[1:05:53] loved us and took us around and and you
[1:05:55] know just showed the love of god you
[1:05:57] know the bible says that that's how
[1:05:58] we'll know
[1:06:00] one with another is by that divine love
[1:06:02] that we can share with one another and
[1:06:04] when you can see that spirit just

[1:15:32] is using tapes and papers to reveal the
[1:15:36] message
[1:15:38] but the message actually is a person
[1:15:44] and his bride
[1:15:47] the message is revealing
[1:15:49] the bride
[1:15:51] groom
[1:15:52] and the bride
[1:15:55] so brother brennan preaches this message
[1:15:58] two times
[1:16:00] once in 60s
[1:16:03] and then in 63.
[1:16:06] so first he entitled
[1:16:08] what it takes to overcome all unbelief
[1:16:12] coma
[1:16:14] our faith
[1:16:15] so first time when he preached this
[1:16:17] message he preached it in this way what
[1:16:20] it takes to overcome all the unbelief
[1:16:22] our faith
[1:16:24] not our faith
[1:16:26] your faith made you well
[1:16:30] if you look in the bible you find out
[1:16:32] that not not the
[1:16:35] faith in me but you your faith you
[1:16:37] already have it in you
[1:16:42] so then in 63
[1:16:44] brother branham takes again this
[1:16:47] subject and he split it into
[1:16:50] in the morning he he preached how can
[1:16:54] i
[1:16:56] overcome
[1:16:57] not how not how
[1:17:00] can we
[1:17:04] how can we
[1:17:06] this is for the pentecost
[1:17:11] but how can i
[1:17:14] it is i
[1:17:18] she is him
[1:17:21] how can i overcome in this
[1:17:24] designation
[1:17:27] so the blood is not we
[1:17:30] it is i
[1:17:32] can i say man i closed the service
[1:17:34] already
[1:17:36] because he said what is it there
[1:17:38] you already see what i meant
[1:17:41] so you you you understand what dutch
[1:17:43] want to say in what he says
[1:17:46] so you you take what i meant what i want
[1:17:48] to say not how i say
[1:17:51] because i say wrong
[1:17:53] so bt be not afraid it is i
[1:17:58] my
[1:17:59] i like that
[1:18:00] so it's a question
[1:18:02] how can i
[1:18:05] overcome
[1:18:07] to make us think
[1:18:09] and look for the answer so the prophet
[1:18:11] will preach how can i overcome and then
[1:18:14] and the answer was in the evening
[1:18:16] message
[1:18:18] the message is in the evening light
[1:18:21] the message was not in the morning but
[1:18:24] the answer what is the evening message
[1:18:29] perfect faith
[1:18:31] so the answer is
[1:18:33] i
[1:18:34] can
[1:18:35] come over
[1:18:39] by perfect
[1:18:41] that word in greek is de leos
[1:18:44] which means mature
[1:18:46] complete
[1:18:47] in hebrew is
[1:18:49] shalom
[1:18:52] you must be shalom
[1:18:54] how my father in heaven is
[1:18:57] shalom
[1:19:01] so how can overcome by shalom
[1:19:06] faith perfect
[1:19:09] match or complete
[1:19:11] revelation
[1:19:13] is the way
[1:19:14] the great i
[1:19:16] overcome
[1:19:19] today
[1:19:21] so we just we just read it in in
[1:19:23] revelation
[1:19:25] chapter 3 verse 21
[1:19:28] he that has an ear
[1:19:30] so we want to to
[1:19:33] to look for some
[1:19:34] some answers in the message
[1:19:37] how can we overcome to come over how can
[1:19:41] i
[1:19:42] overcome
[1:19:44] so he the first things we we need to
[1:19:46] think about is he that has an ear
[1:19:52] so the first absolutely mandatory
[1:19:54] necessarily
[1:19:56] to overcome is to have an ear
[1:20:00] not a natural ear
[1:20:03] he don't speaking about the people that
[1:20:05] only the people they can hear are bright
[1:20:09] what is an ear the ear speaking is the
[1:20:12] gene of god
[1:20:14] that settles it
[1:20:16] this is the foundation this is where we
[1:20:19] come we start to build now
[1:20:21] so a gene of god a predestinated soul
[1:20:25] he then had a prayer i can read it in
[1:20:27] this way in this abraham hammock age
[1:20:32] he that have a
[1:20:35] predestinated soul
[1:20:37] a gene
[1:20:39] from the loins of elohim
[1:20:43] he can hear
[1:20:45] let him here
[1:20:46] not she
[1:20:48] not you
[1:20:51] let him
[1:20:53] so who is him
[1:20:55] it is god in you
[1:20:57] listening
[1:21:01] it is god speaking to god it is eagle
[1:21:03] speaking to the eagle it is attributed
[1:21:06] to the attribute
[1:21:07] is the eternal to eternal
[1:21:10] can you say praise the lord
[1:21:14] hey man
[1:21:16] so caught
[1:21:17] i skipped
[1:21:18] i became oh i didn't read this part
[1:21:26] no no i i just
[1:21:28] i just keep one quote
[1:21:30] so every code is very important
[1:21:33] so code number one
[1:21:37] so in this message perfect faith
[1:21:40] in the second paragraph the prophet says
[1:21:44] i like that
[1:21:45] always i had
[1:21:47] yesterday when i wrote down
[1:21:51] i had the jubilee
[1:21:54] i had the revival
[1:21:56] the rapture in face struck me
[1:21:59] look what says here
[1:22:01] but abram refers here
[1:22:03] that somebody
[1:22:05] need a pair of
[1:22:08] glasses not the pentecostal glasses
[1:22:12] but message glasses
[1:22:15] to can drink
[1:22:16] and see the way
[1:22:18] is on his pulpit
[1:22:21] look at here there is a pair of glasses
[1:22:24] here that somebody has lost
[1:22:26] if you lose the vision the message
[1:22:28] vision
[1:22:29] there is a glasses for you
[1:22:33] and being found in the church
[1:22:35] somebody when they went home they they
[1:22:39] forgot they have message glasses in the
[1:22:42] church
[1:22:43] but somebody don't take it with them
[1:22:45] they leave it in the church
[1:22:46] so when they come in the church you know
[1:22:49] they take the glasses
[1:22:52] they speak like
[1:22:54] they behave like they seem like
[1:22:57] but when they go home they
[1:23:01] you take it with you huh
[1:23:06] hey man
[1:23:08] you know i how i get older
[1:23:10] sorry brother how i get older
[1:23:14] you know i started to need glasses
[1:23:17] so i get some correction here in america
[1:23:22] so
[1:23:23] to don't forget the glasses at home
[1:23:26] to don't come with my own interpretation
[1:23:28] i see that
[1:23:29] the only thing is they don't see that i
[1:23:31] have inglis
[1:23:36] or you know samsung lost his eyes
[1:23:40] pentecostal age
[1:23:43] prophet age
[1:23:44] but something
[1:23:45] happened
[1:23:48] while sansone was
[1:23:50] grounding working to defeat the students
[1:23:54] the hair started to grow
[1:23:57] it was not something that he could
[1:23:59] perform it was not something that he
[1:24:01] could do
[1:24:03] it was a law
[1:24:06] and while he was there mocked
[1:24:10] and persecuted
[1:24:12] the hair
[1:24:14] which is the covenant
[1:24:16] he was born with a covenant
[1:24:18] he could not manipulate it
[1:24:21] is you know
[1:24:24] god was in control of it
[1:24:26] and his hair started to grow
[1:24:28] when his hair started to grow
[1:24:31] the mind of christ came in him
[1:24:34] hallelujah so this is what is going on
[1:24:36] the mind of christ came in the bride
[1:24:42] so if anybody if they belong to you well
[1:24:45] they are here on the
[1:24:46] platform
[1:24:50] message glasses
[1:24:52] i like that can you say praise the lord
[1:24:56] code number two
[1:25:00] how can i overcome
[1:25:01] how can i
[1:25:03] overcome in bright form
[1:25:05] notice
[1:25:07] overcome paragraph 10 7.
[1:25:12] 107
[1:25:15] everything perfect
[1:25:16] you know i'm a jew
[1:25:19] and the problem is when i get under an
[1:25:20] anointing i became more jew
[1:25:26] so i'm sorry this is the way i am so
[1:25:29] uh
[1:25:30] how notice overcome notice observe
[1:25:33] pay heed
[1:25:34] look
[1:25:37] the god that is
[1:25:39] in the church
[1:25:42] no brother is the goddess is in you
[1:25:46] elohim
[1:25:48] he said the word of god
[1:25:50] came to elohim
[1:25:52] no to
[1:25:54] singular elohim means plurality
[1:25:57] attributes
[1:25:59] so
[1:25:59] all that the world came to them
[1:26:02] you never prayed god sent elijah to my
[1:26:05] way to my father you never prayed just
[1:26:07] he came
[1:26:08] because the world
[1:26:10] came to elohim
[1:26:13] by his grace you are one of them yes
[1:26:16] amen hallelujah
[1:26:18] i am happy to be one of them nobody
[1:26:20] bought me nobody take me out
[1:26:25] that god as is in you
[1:26:28] is greater than the one that is in him
[1:26:30] in the world the god of this world is
[1:26:33] not as great as the god of heaven which
[1:26:36] is
[1:26:39] in you
[1:26:41] can you say amen
[1:26:43] i just called the prophet is not my own
[1:26:45] thoughts
[1:26:46] it's god's thoughts
[1:26:48] so he said that the god of heaven
[1:26:50] jesus could say
[1:26:52] who is the son of man he that is in
[1:26:53] heaven and in is on earth
[1:26:56] you can say the same thing today
[1:26:59] the god of heaven is in heaven but of by
[1:27:02] the same time the god of heaven is in
[1:27:04] you
[1:27:06] hallelujah no more than darkness can
[1:27:09] stand in the presence of light
[1:27:11] look the next paragraph that one that is
[1:27:14] in you
[1:27:16] is or in hebrew is light
[1:27:21] not a not only a revelation
[1:27:23] is a little button of light
[1:27:26] you have been born when your mama and
[1:27:28] papa have a little baby
[1:27:31] already elohim
[1:27:33] we go beyond predestination
[1:27:36] judas was predestinated
[1:27:39] the first work of grace that the lord
[1:27:41] made to us was election
[1:27:44] actually he torn up himself
[1:27:47] he took something from the pillar of
[1:27:49] fire
[1:27:50] and he places in the wall of jericho
[1:27:55] and you say praise the lord
[1:27:57] he places something in you that is a
[1:27:58] part of him himself that's why when you
[1:28:01] saw the pillar of fire you recognize you
[1:28:04] were original amen
[1:28:08] hallelujah
[1:28:10] blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:28:12] and then he said the one that is new
[1:28:14] that lied
[1:28:16] you never received that light you have
[1:28:18] been born with that light
[1:28:20] that's why the prophet said in the
[1:28:21] future home you have never be saved in
[1:28:23] one day
[1:28:26] you just recognized
[1:28:29] that you have you have been in him in
[1:28:31] his thoughts
[1:28:33] before the foundation of the world you
[1:28:35] you have been already in his plane
[1:28:38] of revealing himself
[1:28:40] and this is what is going on after the
[1:28:42] seven church edges has ended
[1:28:44] this is what they go what is going on
[1:28:47] the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:28:50] third poll
[1:28:52] seven thunders
[1:28:54] invisible union
[1:28:56] the heavenly bridegroom has returned
[1:28:59] there is a mystery of the returning of
[1:29:01] the pillar of fire
[1:29:05] and this is
[1:29:06] happening
[1:29:07] it is it is not a public show
[1:29:12] this is in your room
[1:29:14] what it is with the people that don't
[1:29:15] have a house
[1:29:18] this is your heart
[1:29:20] something invisible is happening right
[1:29:22] now the pillar of fire is knocking
[1:29:26] wanting to have spiritual relations
[1:29:28] intimate relationship with you
[1:29:30] and when you open your heart
[1:29:34] you can say the marriage has come
[1:29:36] let her let us rejoin and be happy
[1:29:40] oh hallelujah he that is in you is great
[1:29:43] and that he that is in the world
[1:29:47] but if you are living above that he that
[1:29:50] is you know has laid you above
[1:29:53] the darkness
[1:29:54] amen

[1:30:18] there's the way is to all believers
[1:30:21] they are a mystic
[1:30:24] the people don't understand because they
[1:30:25] live in a world to themselves
[1:30:30] jesus
[1:30:31] which is the word made flesh
[1:30:35] which is you
[1:30:37] do you believe that you are the word
[1:30:41] you know the difference between us and
[1:30:43] other people is
[1:30:44] when we read the bible we read the
[1:30:46] message we don't read about somebody
[1:30:49] else
[1:30:51] we recognize ourself in it
[1:30:55] we read about us
[1:30:58] the people don't understand because
[1:31:00] jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[1:31:02] could touch
[1:31:03] the disciples couldn't understand him
[1:31:06] when he spoke to them they say this
[1:31:08] and they say
[1:31:10] you talking riddles
[1:31:12] we don't understand this if we have time
[1:31:15] today or maybe
[1:31:16] afternoon we are going to take the
[1:31:18] riddles of the message
[1:31:20] parables of the message
[1:31:22] we you know we have parables in the
[1:31:24] message
[1:31:26] modern parables
[1:31:29] i like that
[1:31:31] hallelujah
[1:31:32] so this
[1:31:33] so so
[1:31:35] how can this be
[1:31:36] see they wasn't in the world
[1:31:39] that he lived in so we invite you in
[1:31:41] this morning
[1:31:43] let's go
[1:31:44] in his world
[1:31:46] is right here
[1:31:48] it's just a
[1:31:50] step
[1:31:51] ahead
[1:31:52] let's enter in
[1:31:55] and let's start to live there
[1:31:57] to be a prisoner of this message
[1:32:00] i am a prisoner of this message
[1:32:02] i cannot take anymore my decision
[1:32:06] i have to filter everything through the
[1:32:08] message
[1:32:11] actually
[1:32:12] goes farther
[1:32:14] i am the message
[1:32:17] the message became romanian flesh
[1:32:23] hallelujah glory glory glory
[1:32:26] it will be a great parade
[1:32:29] the world became flesh the message
[1:32:31] became flesh
[1:32:33] you were flesh
[1:32:35] and the flesh became the word
[1:32:38] every fiber
[1:32:40] i was so happy when i see the testimony
[1:32:42] of brother hickerson nine years old
[1:32:44] brother hickerson what is the message
[1:32:46] for you
[1:32:47] and he could not harvest the broader
[1:32:50] message
[1:32:52] is heavy fiber
[1:32:54] of my body
[1:32:57] we can say the same thing today
[1:32:59] the message is every fiber
[1:33:02] i said right
[1:33:04] why are looking to me like that
[1:33:08] because you say you must eat in the
[1:33:10] fight the brother brah said i never
[1:33:12] meant i need to preach and the people
[1:33:14] listen
[1:33:15] we are preaching together here
[1:33:17] i say something that you like it and you
[1:33:20] say
[1:33:20] amen say i believe it
[1:33:23] amen i'm happy
[1:33:25] i knew it before you just said it
[1:33:28] i had a chance to say to you you just
[1:33:30] already know it
[1:33:34] hallelujah amen blessed be the name of
[1:33:38] the lord
[1:33:39] so in
[1:33:40] wind
[1:33:43] and
[1:33:46] when when we enter to hit sometimes i
[1:33:49] don't understand my own writing
[1:33:54] which is good
[1:33:56] because you became dependent
[1:33:59] addicted
[1:34:01] to his spirit
[1:34:03] so we enter to his word
[1:34:06] when we enter in his word
[1:34:08] we have his faith
[1:34:12] so let's put it this way
[1:34:14] how can i overcome perfect revelation
[1:34:19] because faith
[1:34:20] is revelation
[1:34:22] that was a good boy gabriel i like it
[1:34:25] so i celebrate myself
[1:34:28] yeah a perfect
[1:34:30] revelation
[1:34:32] how can i overcome perfect revelation
[1:34:36] it is his faith it is not my faith it is
[1:34:39] not my intellect or peter's
[1:34:42] faith
[1:34:46] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:34:48] ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 says
[1:34:52] hallelujah
[1:34:54] i try to make you happy
[1:34:57] brother brown said you cannot be happy
[1:34:59] enough feel you are blessed with the
[1:35:00] holy ghost till you are happy
[1:35:03] happy enough
[1:35:05] verse 11.
[1:35:13] amen
[1:35:16] 4 11.
[1:35:18] and he have
[1:35:19] he gave some apostles and some prophets
[1:35:22] plural and some evangelists and some
[1:35:24] pastors plural and teachers
[1:35:26] for the perfecting
[1:35:29] of the saints
[1:35:31] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:35:33] edifying of the body of christ till we
[1:35:36] all come in the unity of faith
[1:35:40] not my faith
[1:35:42] his faith
[1:35:44] he is he believing in me
[1:35:48] and the knowledge of the son of god
[1:35:53] we all have to have his faith his
[1:35:55] revelation we have to come how i can
[1:35:58] overcome by his revelation
[1:36:02] that's why in mark 11
[1:36:04] verse 22 we read
[1:36:07] mark 11
[1:36:08] verse 22
[1:36:14] have faith of
[1:36:16] god
[1:36:18] so actually is his revelation number two
[1:36:21] adding
[1:36:23] to the gene of god
[1:36:24] to the little light that already god god
[1:36:28] places in you dividing himself
[1:36:31] towarding up parts from the pillar of
[1:36:33] fire placing in your heart
[1:36:36] adding these his revelation
[1:36:39] we are not living
[1:36:41] by sight
[1:36:43] we live by revelation
[1:36:45] in his revelation in you is that
[1:36:49] overcome
[1:36:50] and this is the place
[1:36:53] where the new bible
[1:36:56] his wife
[1:36:57] gave to him opened
[1:37:00] he gets a new bible
[1:37:03] quote number four
[1:37:05] amen
[1:37:06] hallelujah
[1:37:09] but when i opened the bible the first
[1:37:11] little reborn in the bible was a very
[1:37:13] strange things where it was was when
[1:37:16] solomon dedicated the temple of god and
[1:37:20] the glory of god was so glad the
[1:37:22] shekinah glory
[1:37:24] the srina in the building till the
[1:37:27] priest
[1:37:28] couldn't even minister
[1:37:31] and the next thing the next string was
[1:37:33] laying where ezra
[1:37:35] ezra was
[1:37:37] the
[1:37:38] the man who put together the old
[1:37:40] testament the canon of the old testament
[1:37:42] ezra
[1:37:43] returned
[1:37:44] and dedicated the temple
[1:37:46] and the third little market
[1:37:49] that my wife had gotten me
[1:37:52] and put it in the bible
[1:37:55] i like that
[1:37:57] not knowing with my name on it
[1:38:01] was lying laying
[1:38:03] mark 11 22.
[1:38:05] she just struck it in the bible stuck it
[1:38:08] in the bible and that's where it was
[1:38:11] and that if you say to this mountain
[1:38:15] be moved
[1:38:17] and all of you know when the scripture
[1:38:19] what that the scripture was in my mind
[1:38:22] you tape people
[1:38:25] that's when those squirrels came right
[1:38:28] into that
[1:38:30] exactly
[1:38:32] third
[1:38:33] pool
[1:38:34] so that makes me to remember
[1:38:38] matthew 16.
[1:38:40] maybe we can open material
[1:38:43] amen 16.
[1:38:43] 16.
[1:38:48] matthew 16
[1:38:50] 13
[1:38:51] we we realized that
[1:38:54] jesus was
[1:38:56] for jesus was important to realize if
[1:38:59] they know who i am
[1:39:02] to know who is he
[1:39:05] so what when happened is in matthew 16
[1:39:09] we find out it was in bania spring in
[1:39:12] caesarea philippi
[1:39:14] the place of philip philippe the brother
[1:39:17] of herodis
[1:39:18] so
[1:39:20] if you have been in israel this is the
[1:39:21] place they call it the gate of hell
[1:39:25] that was the
[1:39:26] pond the idol
[1:39:29] panic coming from that god
[1:39:33] the enter is in hell
[1:39:35] and jesus little his little body stood
[1:39:37] there
[1:39:39] and then he turned to his disciples
[1:39:41] asking them
[1:39:43] who the men say
[1:39:44] that i
[1:39:46] the son of man
[1:39:48] i the son of man am
[1:39:51] and then he turned to his disciples
[1:39:54] they then they answered verse 14 you are
[1:39:57] john the baptist
[1:39:59] you are elias elijah
[1:40:02] in jeremiah jeremiah to bring big dark
[1:40:04] of the covenant so you are john the
[1:40:06] baptist
[1:40:08] you know they are still john the baptist
[1:40:11] follower today
[1:40:13] sixty thousand they baptized with
[1:40:16] alone and they see that jesus was the
[1:40:18] fourth prophet
[1:40:20] they have more connection with
[1:40:22] john johanna
[1:40:24] the levi the priest johanna was the
[1:40:27] priest was a kohanim a levite
[1:40:30] john the baptist
[1:40:32] and they believe that joe the baptist
[1:40:34] was the
[1:40:35] main thing
[1:40:36] and they are still baptizing themselves
[1:40:39] for repentance
[1:40:40] and they speak about jesus jesus was a
[1:40:42] false prophet
[1:40:48] are you elijah
[1:40:52] elijah who has to come to present the
[1:40:53] messiah or
[1:40:55] are you jeremiah who bring back out of
[1:40:57] the covenant and jesus said unto them
[1:41:00] but
[1:41:01] whom say you
[1:41:03] that ego amy
[1:41:06] a here i shared a here
[1:41:08] i am
[1:41:10] who do you say
[1:41:13] but who say ye
[1:41:16] you see the answer is in the question
[1:41:20] so for the disciple he makes it simple
[1:41:23] he give the answer in the question
[1:41:26] praise the lord hallelujah
[1:41:31] he is very interested that we get it
[1:41:34] and he make it simple
[1:41:36] they say we have such a wonderful
[1:41:38] message
[1:41:40] amen how can i how can i overcome
[1:41:45] first john
[1:41:47] chapter 5 verse 4
[1:41:49] how can i overcome first we need the
[1:41:52] general god next we need to have his
[1:41:54] faith
[1:41:57] first john chapter 5 verse 4.
[1:42:00] whatever is born of god hallelujah
[1:42:06] we are born of the world
[1:42:08] whosoever is born of god whosoever is
[1:42:11] born from above
[1:42:14] god has to be my father
[1:42:17] god has to be your father
[1:42:19] whosoever is born of god
[1:42:22] born of god overcomes the word and this
[1:42:25] is the victory that overcoming the world
[1:42:30] his faith is our faith
[1:42:34] his revelation is our revelation
[1:42:40] luke 18 verse 8
[1:42:44] jesus never after 17
[1:42:47] after the apocalypses
[1:42:51] after he came down from the mountain
[1:42:54] chapter 18 he's he says something
[1:42:57] straight striking
[1:43:00] verse 18 says
[1:43:04] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:43:07] he was speaking from this day
[1:43:10] because he was there the son of god
[1:43:11] manifesting
[1:43:13] now he was speaking from a time when he
[1:43:15] is going to manifest again as the son of
[1:43:18] man
[1:43:19] he was two thousand years for son of god
[1:43:22] the holy spirit but now for a short time
[1:43:24] he is manifest he was manifesting in our
[1:43:26] generation in the way of a son of man
[1:43:29] the next time he will be the son of
[1:43:31] david
[1:43:32] but he was asking him here about the
[1:43:35] time we are living in
[1:43:37] and he put a question nevertheless when
[1:43:40] the son of man cometh
[1:43:43] shall he find
[1:43:45] he didn't come to bring
[1:43:49] he come to find
[1:43:53] he come to bring the faith that he
[1:43:56] already placed in the seed
[1:43:59] in sohora
[1:44:01] in the sea
[1:44:03] to bring it to manifestation
[1:44:05] to squeeze it
[1:44:08] to bring it to life
[1:44:11] hallelujah to discover faith
[1:44:14] to discover revelation
[1:44:17] to make you free
[1:44:20] you will know the truth
[1:44:22] no means intimate relationship
[1:44:26] like husband and wife
[1:44:27] not ginosko no not oida
[1:44:30] not that you learn
[1:44:32] something but to have a relationship
[1:44:35] with this message
[1:44:37] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:44:39] lord
[1:44:40] hallelujah that's why
[1:44:42] we are back in the book of
[1:44:46] matthew he agrees
[1:44:51] verse 16
[1:44:53] and sibo and peter answered unto unto
[1:44:55] him and said tower christ the son of the
[1:44:58] living god
[1:45:00] simon simon what means simon is he that
[1:45:04] can hear
[1:45:05] but his nature was very wavering
[1:45:09] unstable
[1:45:11] unsure
[1:45:14] how can he build
[1:45:16] his church over a wavering greed
[1:45:20] how can he build me on on such an
[1:45:23] instable nature
[1:45:27] in five verses you will find that he is
[1:45:31] called in the different names
[1:45:35] and simon
[1:45:38] peter answered tower christ the son of
[1:45:40] the living god and jesus
[1:45:42] jesus answered he as he
[1:45:46] blessed us
[1:45:48] so what is blessed nobody can curse
[1:45:54] simon
[1:45:56] jonah means dove
[1:46:00] the son of the dove
[1:46:02] the son of the holy spirit
[1:46:04] you simon the son of jonah
[1:46:08] blessed that town
[1:46:11] because
[1:46:14] not flesh and blood
[1:46:16] revealed it
[1:46:18] not even me
[1:46:21] not even jesus revealed it for you
[1:46:26] had a straight channel
[1:46:29] with the same god that jesus had
[1:46:34] he was not even baptized with the holy
[1:46:36] ghost
[1:46:39] he was not even born again
[1:46:42] but he have the same channel as jesus
[1:46:46] because jesus says i didn't reveal it to
[1:46:48] you
[1:46:49] he said not even flesh in your spirit
[1:46:53] but my father which is in heaven
[1:46:55] have the same connection with you as he
[1:46:58] has with me
[1:47:01] oh glory
[1:47:03] hallelujah
[1:47:05] amen
[1:47:08] then the word turns onto him and said
[1:47:12] so when you have that channel
[1:47:15] born with that channel
[1:47:18] is identified who you
[1:47:20] are the word when you identify the word
[1:47:24] the word is identifying you
[1:47:27] i cross in toward peter
[1:47:30] this is the real name in the name's book
[1:47:33] of life you are not simon a wavering
[1:47:36] sheep a man that is stable but you are a
[1:47:40] rock
[1:47:43] you are the little rock
[1:47:45] you are all little rocks
[1:47:48] then i will build my house and i will
[1:47:51] come and set them
[1:47:53] and dwell among them
[1:47:56] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:47:58] lord
[1:48:00] i am on them
[1:48:01] i am one of them and you are one of them
[1:48:06] nobody made me yes
[1:48:08] i was born like that
[1:48:10] we are not here to conquer to bring more
[1:48:12] people in
[1:48:13] we are here only to be the servants
[1:48:16] there we are just showing them the way
[1:48:19] welcome home
[1:48:22] welcome home
[1:48:24] the eagles came home
[1:48:27] nobody can come only what the father
[1:48:29] because where in the wedding he came
[1:48:32] down with a mere certificate
[1:48:35] that little book is the marriage
[1:48:36] certificate
[1:48:38] and my name is on that
[1:48:40] where from where you know that brother
[1:48:42] because when he preached these mysteries
[1:48:46] oh something in me that i could say
[1:48:48] amens it is me
[1:48:50] and this is the way i could see my name
[1:48:52] in the latest book of life
[1:48:56] it is not written level
[1:48:59] it is not little cosmic stefan
[1:49:01] but while he was preaching these
[1:49:03] mysteries
[1:49:05] it was calling my name
[1:49:09] that's why we are here this morning
[1:49:10] because our name is written in the late
[1:49:12] book of life
[1:49:14] and we had the prophet in the land and
[1:49:16] he said that says the lord
[1:49:17] when this mystery are preached
[1:49:20] i can say they said
[1:49:22] that says the midnight cry
[1:49:27] not the margo
[1:49:29] midnight cry is the message of dawah
[1:49:32] they try to copy
[1:49:34] you see actually the spirits of the we
[1:49:36] are the real pentecostals
[1:49:38] but the spirits of pentecost they try to
[1:49:41] push in the message to
[1:49:44] we are the real baptist
[1:49:46] because we baptize in the name of the
[1:49:48] lord jesus christ
[1:49:50] by the spirit of the baptist tries to
[1:49:52] come in
[1:49:53] we are the real
[1:49:55] later let's say
[1:49:57] the bride of christ in the later days
[1:50:01] you see by the spirits coming also try
[1:50:03] to
[1:50:05] we are the real catholics
[1:50:07] because we are the universal church
[1:50:10] we are the real jew
[1:50:12] the prophet said that
[1:50:14] a real jew is a predestinated seed of
[1:50:16] god
[1:50:17] i have the quote
[1:50:19] you see by the spirit son
[1:50:23] hallelujah
[1:50:25] blessed be the name of the lord so the
[1:50:27] words turn unto him and say tower peter
[1:50:31] your name is the lamest book of life
[1:50:33] because you have this revelation
[1:50:37] hallelujah
[1:50:39] when you identify the word the word
[1:50:42] identifies you
[1:50:46] you are christ and you are peter
[1:50:49] this message is from the lord and you
[1:50:51] are his bride
[1:50:54] hallelujah
[1:50:56] how can i
[1:50:58] overcome
[1:50:59] paragraph chapter five are you still

[1:51:58] 1963
[1:52:00] you see
[1:52:01] perfect fact
[1:52:02] 63
[1:52:04] rebecca lift up her eyes
[1:52:07] who is he
[1:52:09] who is he
[1:52:10] is my master
[1:52:12] so she came down from the camels
[1:52:16] now it was the time of the third pool
[1:52:19] when
[1:52:20] isaac the promised son
[1:52:22] will throw there
[1:52:24] in her mother's tent
[1:52:26] sarah attend
[1:52:28] where she tried to produce
[1:52:31] you cannot produce the promiser
[1:52:33] he's a promiser
[1:52:36] you cannot make
[1:52:37] me bride i was born bright
[1:52:42] in his due season now remember they had
[1:52:45] the word and the word was flesh then
[1:52:49] and the word or they might give you
[1:52:51] power amen i give you power and they had
[1:52:53] the power but they didn't have faith
[1:52:55] also you can have a lot of gifts
[1:52:59] but not faith
[1:53:01] the seventy was fundamentally perfect
[1:53:05] by they
[1:53:06] made signs and water
[1:53:09] with our faith
[1:53:12] this is what is going on today
[1:53:14] we see a lot of movement in the message
[1:53:16] let's go back to the charismatic
[1:53:18] movement
[1:53:19] let they prove that we are
[1:53:22] the seventies had it
[1:53:24] and the prophet said they didn't have
[1:53:26] faith
[1:53:27] that they had signs and wonders right
[1:53:30] it will be a pentecostal move
[1:53:35] you cannot feed the bride with
[1:53:37] pentecostals
[1:53:40] this mystery divine reveal will
[1:53:43] literally turn
[1:53:46] this is for me brother bill
[1:53:48] this is for you too yes
[1:53:51] amen
[1:53:52] this mysteries
[1:53:55] revealed we literally turn
[1:53:58] restore
[1:54:00] because we need restoration
[1:54:03] back
[1:54:04] to the faithful that's why we can read
[1:54:07] the message right
[1:54:09] when we turn it right
[1:54:14] but jesus
[1:54:16] he
[1:54:17] has he was the world
[1:54:20] and he had faith
[1:54:22] that what he said will happen
[1:54:26] so
[1:54:27] i see that everybody is happy when we
[1:54:29] speak about jesus ah he did it he did
[1:54:33] what he said will happen right jesus
[1:54:35] said we believe it
[1:54:37] he has faith with his power
[1:54:40] how he did it
[1:54:42] he said i can do nothing in myself
[1:54:48] why he relied upon what
[1:54:52] he was
[1:54:54] and we all agree yes jesus he lied he
[1:54:56] was the world he was
[1:54:58] yeah he relied he know that he was the
[1:55:01] world
[1:55:02] and he had faith in god
[1:55:05] who made him the world
[1:55:12] he was god
[1:55:14] the word
[1:55:15] and there was in him
[1:55:18] and that gave him faith because he
[1:55:21] understood
[1:55:24] his position
[1:55:28] we are coming to something now
[1:55:32] shall we stop now
[1:55:35] he's something more didn't it
[1:55:38] so he
[1:55:39] knowed what he was
[1:55:41] because the scripture
[1:55:43] he said he was this
[1:55:46] and the years every scripture tied in
[1:55:50] to prove that he was exactly
[1:55:53] what the scripture said he will be
[1:55:58] i'm
[1:55:59] finished now you know i'm polite

[1:58:57] romans 8 has come
[1:58:58] be blessed and we thank your father in
[1:59:00] jesus name amen amen amen hallelujah
[1:59:11] that's a big gospel right
[1:59:14] there how simple it is
[1:59:18] but how true
[1:59:20] you know
[1:59:21] when you
[1:59:23] even your faith
[1:59:25] is what you overcome by
[1:59:28] you overcome by your revelation
[1:59:31] it says a kingdom cannot be divided
[1:59:33] against itself
[1:59:36] you know what i mean so you if if you
[1:59:39] don't accept the fact that you're
[1:59:41] elected
[1:59:42] you don't accept the fact that god
[1:59:45] chose you and elected you
[1:59:48] and put your name on the lamb's book of
[1:59:50] life
[1:59:51] then it's the world fighting the world
[1:59:53] that's right
[1:59:55] and that there's you'll never get
[1:59:56] anywhere like that
[1:59:58] but if you can accept your position like
[2:00:00] our brother said except the fact
[2:00:03] that he chose you to
[2:00:05] carry the seed
[2:00:07] he chose you
[2:00:10] to manifest his message
[2:00:13] he chose you he put your name on the
[2:00:15] book of life
[2:00:16] and all that we need to pray for is pray
[2:00:19] for revelation
[2:00:21] that's right
[2:00:22] pray that that's revealed to you because
[2:00:25] what is revelation it's faith
[2:00:28] and then that's your victory even the
[2:00:31] faith right and what that he made you
[2:00:34] and and i'll tell you we fight things we
[2:00:37] don't need to fight
[2:00:39] and we struggle against things i'm the
[2:00:41] worst person in that in the whole wide
[2:00:43] world
[2:00:44] you know what i mean because i try to
[2:00:46] prove to myself
[2:00:48] that i'm a believer
[2:00:51] and
[2:00:52] when i fail in that
[2:00:55] then i get discouraged but when i accept
[2:00:58] the fact that he chose me
[2:01:00] he didn't have to do it
[2:01:02] but he did it
[2:01:04] amen i didn't seek him
[2:01:07] he sought me
[2:01:08] he found me he made me to be this he put
[2:01:11] me here in this age
[2:01:14] he revealed to me this word
[2:01:16] that i'm that that word might be
[2:01:18] revealed through me
[2:01:21] to others
[2:01:22] that some other person out there might
[2:01:24] also find out that that that seed in
[2:01:27] there
[2:01:28] that they might find what they've been
[2:01:29] looking for they might find that
[2:01:31] identity
[2:01:32] your identity
[2:01:34] because the scripture says it's from
[2:01:36] faith to faith the gospel goes from
[2:01:39] faith to faith from revelation to
[2:01:41] revelation from light to light amen
[2:01:45] and the very revelation coming alive in
[2:01:48] you will bring that revelation alive
[2:01:52] in somebody else and that's what he came
[2:01:55] into the world to do
[2:01:57] amen what a what a beautiful thought
[2:01:59] this evening
[2:02:01] or this morning it says i'm anxious to
[2:02:03] find out
[2:02:05] the riddles and the message
[2:02:09] not very many titles get me interested
[2:02:12] because you know i got my first thought
[2:02:15] was i didn't know there was any riddles
