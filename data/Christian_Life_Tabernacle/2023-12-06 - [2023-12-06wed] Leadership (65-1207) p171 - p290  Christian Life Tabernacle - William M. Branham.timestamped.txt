[18:57] is
[18:59] we've come this evening to Fellowship
[19:03] around your word to
[19:05] be blessed and we ask father tonight
[19:09] that you would Grant to us a individual
[19:13] blessing to each of our hearts we ask it
[19:16] in jesus' name amen if you have your
[19:20] Bibles and would open with me real quick
[19:24] to St John the 10th chapter
[19:28] and very familiar
[19:31] verses of
[19:39] scripture and we'll read start with the
[19:42] 25th verse of the 10th
[19:48] chapter and he said and Jesus answered
[19:52] them I told you and ye believe not the
[19:57] works that I do in my father's name they
[20:03] bear witness of me but ye believe not
[20:08] because ye are not my sheep as I said
[20:13] unto you my sheep hear my voice amen and
[20:18] I know them and they follow me and I
[20:24] give unto them eternal life and they
[20:28] shall never perish neither shall any man
[20:32] pluck them out of my hand my Father
[20:37] which gave them me is greater than Allen
[20:42] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[20:47] my father's hand amen I am my father are
[20:52] one amen you may be
[20:57] seated
[21:02] I I uh we were fellowshipping at
[21:06] lunch over leadership and we came to
[21:10] this quote and I don't know if it's
[21:14] possible uh for the brothers to find it
[21:17] real quick but it's in the Sam Samaran
[21:21] Church age on page
[21:25] 155 of the church age book and and I I
[21:29] and and we're going to just listen to
[21:31] the the last part of leadership that we
[21:36] listen to Sunday and uh I I hope that uh
[21:40] we can catch this is the last sermon
[21:43] that brother Brandon preached to the uh
[21:48] before communion
[21:49] service uh you know I don't
[21:53] know
[21:55] um you know what brother ran knew about
[21:59] what lied ahead for him he made a
[22:02] statement one place that a man knows
[22:04] when he's fixing to leave the scene uh
[22:08] this is a tremendous message he just
[22:10] lays so much just out for us but I'd
[22:14] like to read this statement out of the
[22:16] smar church Age and and what we're
[22:20] emphasizing is is because when we start
[22:22] listening to the tape tonight brother
[22:26] Brena makes this statement this start
[22:28] God calls
[22:30] individuals I stand at the door and
[22:33] knock If any man any person one
[22:37] individual out of a thousand it might be
[22:42] one in a million so but he stands at the
[22:45] door and
[22:46] knocks and and so he makes this
[22:50] statement and listen to this closely so
[22:53] you can understand uh we can't take
[22:56] comfort in a group you know what I mean
[23:01] or you can't take comfort because
[23:03] everybody around you confesses the same
[23:06] thing what that we've been trying to
[23:09] preach in these last few Services is the
[23:13] individual
[23:15] importance of each
[23:19] individual having leadership by the word
[23:23] of
[23:24] God in other words each of you have got
[23:27] to establish Lish a
[23:29] relationship with the word of God where
[23:31] that word of God speaks to you expressly
[23:36] and and that's what you follow you're
[23:39] not influenced by the pulpit you're not
[23:42] influenced by the fellowship you're
[23:45] steadfast amen so in other words my
[23:47] sheep hear my voice a stranger they will
[23:50] not follow so they that's what we're
[23:55] emphasizing that that you've got to come
[23:59] to where you're just not tossed to and
[24:02] fro by every wind of Doctrine or every
[24:05] move that you're anchored steadfast and
[24:08] you know the voice and this is what the
[24:10] messenger tells us and it's it's
[24:13] beautiful and I'll try to read it the
[24:16] best I
[24:17] can notice here that Jesus by the spirit
[24:23] in every age addresses himself to only
[24:28] one person relative to the word for that
[24:35] age amen and and we know that unto the
[24:39] angel of Unto the angel of Unto the
[24:43] angel unto the messenger he's addressing
[24:46] that one
[24:47] individual he says to that age only one
[24:51] messenger for each age receives what the
[24:57] spirit has to say to that
[25:01] age so we realize that we're not in
[25:04] another age we've got to receive the
[25:07] message for our age because the message
[25:10] for our age is given to meet the
[25:13] challenge of this age he says uh the
[25:18] messenger of that age and that one
[25:22] messenger is the messenger to the true
[25:27] church amen he speaks for God by
[25:32] Revelation to the churches both true and
[25:37] false the message is then broadcast to
[25:41] all but though it is broadcast for all
[25:46] who come within range of the message
[25:50] that message is received
[25:54] individually by only a certain
[25:58] qualified group in a certain way each
[26:04] individual of that group is one who has
[26:09] the ability to hear what the spirit is
[26:14] saying by way of the messenger
[26:19] amen those who hear are not getting
[26:23] their own private
[26:25] Revelation nor is a group getting their
[26:29] Collective
[26:31] Revelation but each person
[26:35] Hallelujah is hearing and receiving what
[26:39] the messenger has already received from
[26:45] God Amen so it it's like you you've it's
[26:51] like the the body is put together by
[26:56] individuals who re receive the word of
[26:58] God and by the word of God that they
[27:02] receive and they follow they're fitted
[27:05] and joined together to produce a body
[27:11] and and so that's how we begin to supply
[27:14] so this message is called
[27:16] leadership and basically you could you
[27:19] could look at it in a lot of lights a
[27:22] lot of different viewpoints from what's
[27:24] going on but the prophet of God is
[27:27] basically saying to the Full Gospel
[27:31] businessmen to the Pentecostal church
[27:34] that's heard them you've got to make a
[27:37] choice who you're going to
[27:40] follow and we've got to make that choice
[27:44] and remember we preached a couple
[27:46] Sundays ago that we have to meet the
[27:52] challenge in other words we're coming
[27:55] back back to the Faith of Our fathers
[27:58] and the last thing that this church has
[28:00] to go to is the
[28:03] complaint that he had with the church as
[28:07] they begin to lose their first love so
[28:10] we want to certainly come back to that
[28:13] uh this evening so let's just take it's
[28:15] about 41 minutes and we should be out
[28:18] pretty close by uh 8:00 or just a few
[28:22] minutes after uh once again you're more
[28:25] than happy to walk through the the
[28:27] church building they've been
[28:28] sheetrocking in there uh if you're okay
[28:31] with the white dust um feel free I think
[28:35] you'll be amazed how it's starting to
[28:37] come together but anyway let's listen to
[28:39] our our messenger and take into heart
[28:42] what he said he's speaking to
[28:45] you as an
[28:47] individual what he has received from God
[28:51] that you might personally have the
[28:55] Revelation not your own revelation
[28:58] but the Revelation that God has already
[29:01] given God bless you this
[29:04] evening God's calling individuals I
[29:08] stand at the door and knock If any man
[29:11] any person one individual out of a
[29:14] thousand it might be one out of a
[29:17] million as I said few nights ago when
[29:21] Israel come up out of Egypt there was
[29:24] just two million people come and just
[29:26] two Milli just one two people went in
[29:29] one out of a million did you know that
[29:32] Caleb and Joshua and Jesus when he was
[29:35] on Earth they said our fathers eat men
[29:38] of the Wilderness we're keeping the
[29:39] traditions and we're doing this we know
[29:41] where we're standing he said I know your
[29:42] fathers eat men of the Wilderness and
[29:44] they're everyone eternally separated
[29:47] their
[29:49] dead when the sper comes from the male
[29:52] or female there's a million eggs comes
[29:53] there's a million germs
[29:55] come and out of all them little germs of
[29:58] the kind if it's a if it's from the Bale
[30:01] cow or the man or whatever it is there's
[30:03] just millions of germs a million germs
[30:05] working in there there's only one of
[30:08] those germs that's ordained to
[30:10] life for there's one egg over there
[30:12] fertile to meet
[30:14] it that's right only one egg it'll meet
[30:18] just like this body here sitting here
[30:20] and The Germ comes from
[30:22] God and watch that little germ come up
[30:25] among all these other germs and wiggle
[30:26] around them right on pass them go over
[30:28] here and find that fertile EG and and
[30:30] crawl right into it the rest of them
[30:33] dies what if it was that way with the
[30:35] church today one out of a million see
[30:38] where it would be straight is the gate
[30:40] Nar is the way and few there will be
[30:43] that'll find it because broad is a way
[30:45] that leads to destruction and many there
[30:47] will be a going in there at is that
[30:49] truth brother BR I don't know but I'm
[30:52] Miss quoting scripture see now you're
[30:55] ordained to life you see it if you're
[30:58] ordained to see it if you're not
[30:59] ordained to see it you won't see it said
[31:02] they have eyes but they can't see ears
[31:04] and can't hear how thankful you should
[31:06] be Church how you should straighten
[31:08] yourself up from these things how you
[31:11] should be on fire for God that your eyes
[31:14] beholds what you see your ear shars the
[31:17] things you
[31:18] see leadership why did you come here
[31:22] tonight to hear a message like this
[31:24] branded across the world by the churches
[31:26] as a IC why did you come the Holy Spirit
[31:30] Led you
[31:32] here to
[31:34] listen circumcised cut away the things
[31:36] of the world except the leadership of
[31:39] Jesus Christ or you'll perish as sure as
[31:41] the world you have a choice of conduct
[31:43] how you conduct yourself that's up to
[31:45] you you have a choice of wife you go out
[31:48] and take your wife you want to take a
[31:50] wife you want to take one it's
[31:51] complimentary to your to what you what
[31:54] you plan your future home to be could
[31:56] you imagine a man a Christian man going
[31:58] out and taking one of these modern
[31:59] rickettes for a wife could you imagine
[32:02] what's a man thinking about what kind of
[32:05] homes he go to have he takes a strip
[32:07] teas a bur ass off of the street out
[32:09] here a street prostitute Bo say now wait
[32:12] a minute how does she dress
[32:14] herself
[32:16] am wear shorts and they say street
[32:19] prostitute oh you say now brother all
[32:21] them little old tight skirts look like
[32:22] you're poured into street prostitute
[32:25] Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman
[32:27] to lust after her has committed adultery
[32:30] with her in his heart then he's got to
[32:32] answer for that and what she do she
[32:34] present herself who's
[32:35] guilty
[32:37] amen think of it you say they don't make
[32:40] any other clothes they got goods and
[32:42] sewing
[32:43] machines no
[32:46] excuse
[32:48] exactly God don't want to hurt you and
[32:51] this is not a joke this is thus sayeth
[32:53] the Lord from the
[32:54] scriptures it's exactly true friend amen
[32:58] I'm an old man I haven't got much longer
[33:00] to stay but I've got to tell you the
[33:03] truth if this is my last message it's
[33:05] the truth see don't sister don't brother
[33:08] and you fellow that's hanging on to a
[33:11] Creed and knowing the word of God being
[33:14] Vindicated right before you the baptism
[33:16] of the Holy Ghost and these realities
[33:17] that we have today and then because of
[33:19] your Creed turn away from him amen how
[33:22] can you be a Son of God and deny the
[33:24] word of God that's predicted for this
[33:25] last days that we're living in
[33:27] how can you do it how can the Bible call
[33:30] this as I said last night about a a king
[33:33] one time down in the South when they had
[33:35] the color down there was sold for slaves
[33:37] well there's no more than just a a used
[33:39] car market you get a bill of sales on I
[33:42] was alarmed at a little place I read one
[33:44] day where a a broker come along to buy
[33:47] some and he said well now I'd like they
[33:50] sad you'd have to whip them make them
[33:52] work because his way from home they're
[33:53] sold slaves and they in a foreign
[33:56] country they know nothing about and
[33:57] never be back home again and they were
[33:59] sad you had to whip him make them work
[34:00] but this broker come by a certain
[34:02] Plantation one young follow there his
[34:04] chest out chin up he didn't have to whip
[34:06] him he was right up he kept the morals
[34:08] the rest of up the broker said I'll buy
[34:10] him he said he's not for sale don't you
[34:13] ain't go buy him because he's not for
[34:15] sale he said well what makes him so much
[34:17] different he said is he the ball
[34:18] shoulder rest them said no said do you
[34:20] feed him different said no he's a slave
[34:22] eats out there in the galley with the
[34:23] rest of him so what makes any so much
[34:25] difference he said I wondered myself to
[34:27] have found out over in Africa where they
[34:30] come from where the borers bought them
[34:31] and brought them over here and sold them
[34:32] for slaves over there his father is a
[34:35] king of the tribe and yet an alien away
[34:38] from home he knows he's the son of a
[34:40] king so he conducts himself that way
[34:43] hallelujah what a rebuke hallu to
[34:45] Christianity we're supposed to represent
[34:47] God in eternal life there's only one
[34:50] form of eternal life and that's God he
[34:52] alone has eternal life and we are
[34:54] products of his because we're James of
[34:57] his Spirit then we should conduct
[34:59] ourselves women and man like the Bible
[35:02] said for us to do not JZ bells of the
[35:05] street and Ricky of the organization but
[35:08] Christian gentlemen Sons and Daughters
[35:11] of God born to the spirit of God
[35:13] manifesting the light in our days and
[35:15] scattering it exactly right How Far
[35:19] We've drifted from it why the same thing
[35:20] this boy did here he rejected and
[35:23] refused eternal life because it would
[35:25] cost him his soul social standing it
[35:28] cost him his Li his his U uh luxury of
[35:32] money it cost him his Fellowship in the
[35:35] church it cost him a lot of things he
[35:37] knew what it was going to cost him he
[35:38] was a sensible boy and he felt that he
[35:40] couldn't pay the price yet he thought I
[35:42] just trust my religion and go on but
[35:45] down in his heart he know there was
[35:46] something about Jesus Christ was
[35:48] different from them priest of that
[35:51] day and any message that's come in a
[35:54] genuine born message of God is different
[35:56] from from the old Trend when our Divine
[35:59] Healing went forth not long ago you
[36:01] notice how the impersonators followed it
[36:04] and every one of them right in them
[36:05] organization stand there did anyone know
[36:08] that there had to be a message follow
[36:10] that while God don't entertain us he
[36:13] attracts our attention but something and
[36:16] when he attracts our attention then he's
[36:17] got his message look when he first first
[36:19] come on the earth and start his ministry
[36:21] oh young Rabbi we want you over here in
[36:23] our church we bring come on down here
[36:25] the young Prophet oh we want you here
[36:27] come here but one day he stood up and
[36:28] said I and my father are one Oh my he
[36:31] makes your God except you eat the Flesh
[36:34] of the son of man and drink his blood
[36:36] you have no life in you he's a
[36:38] vampire we have nothing to do with that
[36:41] them Apostles set right there thousands
[36:43] left him but those apostles were
[36:45] ordained to life he said so they
[36:47] couldn't explain it they believed it
[36:50] they stayed right with him because he
[36:51] said no man could do these works even
[36:53] the priests know that Nicodemus said we
[36:56] know the sanhan council that no man
[36:59] could do these works except it be from
[37:01] God see Peter on the day of Pentecost
[37:03] said Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of
[37:06] God among you God was with him look at
[37:10] the scriptures what the scriptures said
[37:11] would do Jesus said search the
[37:13] scriptures in them you think you have
[37:15] eternal life they are what testifies of
[37:18] me if you would have known Moses you'd
[37:20] know me for Moses rope that I would come
[37:22] in the farm that I would come in he come
[37:25] as a son of man he comes in three names
[37:29] it's God three like Father Son and Holy
[37:31] Ghost same God there three attributes
[37:34] now also uh justification sanctification
[37:37] Luther Martin and the and the
[37:39] Pentecostal same thing three attributes
[37:41] three stations three Church ages same
[37:44] thing water blood and spirit all this is
[37:47] go along the three elements that takes
[37:49] you back into the body like it brings
[37:51] you from your natural birth types your
[37:53] spiritual birth a baby's born the first
[37:56] things walk water next blood then life
[37:59] that's where you come into the kingdom
[38:00] of God the same way see that's where the
[38:02] church comes in the same way same thing
[38:05] now notice on these three things God has
[38:09] formed his forming his body now we find
[38:12] that in here that you have a right in
[38:14] your choice you choose the girl you want
[38:16] to marry she accepts you all right then
[38:18] another thing you have a choice or
[38:20] whether you want to live or whether you
[38:21] don't want to live you choose now
[38:25] between life and death
[38:28] you can live that boy had that choice he
[38:31] success and everything else a religious
[38:34] man but he know that when he spoke it of
[38:37] himself I've observed all these
[38:39] Commandments since I was a
[38:41] youth but he know he didn't have eternal
[38:44] life see and he had a choice to accept
[38:48] it or to refuse it and he turned it down
[38:51] that was the most fatal mistake he could
[38:53] ever made the rest of it wouldn't
[38:55] mounted doesn't Mount unless you take
[38:58] that choice now let us follow him his
[39:00] choosing and see where it led him to I
[39:03] see where he CH now look he was a he's a
[39:05] rich man he's a businessman he was a
[39:08] ruler and he was a religious man all
[39:11] that today would' say boy he's a genine
[39:14] Methodist or Baptist or a Pentecostal
[39:16] he's he's a real fellow real nice boy
[39:20] fine nothing you say about him friendly
[39:22] nice sociable and everything no immorals
[39:25] about him he didn't probably smoke drink
[39:27] or run around the shows and dances and
[39:29] whatever we'd call it today is we
[39:31] classic Christian but that ain't eternal
[39:34] life that ain't what we're talking about
[39:37] he might have been loyal to his church
[39:38] of what you probably was but you see and
[39:41] what did it lead him to Great popularity
[39:44] let's say if he was a preacher he could
[39:46] have been got a better church he could
[39:48] have been a state preser a bishop it
[39:51] leads you to popularity and it Le him to
[39:53] riches and to
[39:55] fame it might do the same thing today
[39:58] you have a great talent to sing I
[40:00] thought of that young man a while ago
[40:01] sing that song here I give that to the
[40:03] devil and I get back how different
[40:04] between him and E Presley and some of
[40:06] these Pat Boon in a group like that
[40:10] Ernie Ford them guys great singers and
[40:13] take their talents at god-given talents
[40:15] and use it to inspire the The Works of
[40:17] the
[40:18] devil that's right some great singers
[40:21] selling their god-given talents for Fame
[40:24] in this world to become
[40:27] somebody how could you become any more
[40:30] of a body and you could be a somebody
[40:32] than to be a Son of
[40:33] God I don't care if you own the whole
[40:36] city the whole
[40:38] world and you haven't accepted the
[40:40] leadership of eternal life of the Holy
[40:42] Spirit Christ how you go to who are you
[40:45] anyhow you're a dead mortal dead is sin
[40:48] and trespasses religious as you want to
[40:51] be as faithful as you want to be to the
[40:53] church preacher if you want to be in a
[40:55] pull pit but to turn bur
[40:57] down you
[41:01] die he was a great success he was a
[41:04] great success here in his life certainly
[41:06] we find him where we notic uh then we
[41:09] find this fell that he went we follow
[41:11] him a little bit we see he got a great
[41:13] successful and we following through the
[41:15] Bible we notice that he uh he we find
[41:19] him a rich man he's got such great big
[41:21] places he's entertaining the judge and
[41:23] the mayor of the city or what more he's
[41:25] up on top of his roof he has great
[41:27] Banquets and plenty of waitresses and
[41:29] women girls and everything else around
[41:31] him and there's a beggar laying at the
[41:33] gate named Lazarus he reeps the crumbs
[41:35] off to him we know the story the next
[41:37] thing he goes on
[41:39] successful just like the churches to a
[41:42] getting a businessman sitting here
[41:44] telling me right here in California that
[41:46] the church has to tell the labor union
[41:49] what to
[41:51] do he it's coming church and state again
[41:55] it's right on you see you're right in
[41:56] there and you take the mark of the beast
[41:58] not knowing it if you ever bought one of
[42:00] my tapes get this when I get when I get
[42:01] home the trail of The Serpent and you'll
[42:03] see where it's that see where this ends
[42:05] up at going home now to speak at the
[42:07] Lord willing it's about four hours so I
[42:10] couldn't keep it to one of the meeting
[42:11] like this I have to go up everywh the
[42:12] church suffers with me so long patiently
[42:14] notice but now you can listen to the
[42:17] tape sometime in your home notice this
[42:21] now we find out that he was a great
[42:23] success then we find him later till he
[42:25] was a greater success ESS until he said
[42:27] I have got so much boy he'd have made a
[42:29] real genuine guy this day would he even
[42:32] my barns is swelled out they're bursting
[42:36] and I've got so much to I said oh Soul
[42:39] take your rest but what he done at the
[42:41] beginning he rejected the leadership of
[42:44] Jesus Christ his church his intelligence
[42:48] his education and all had led him to a
[42:51] success all the Jews loved him he give
[42:55] to them he helped them he might have
[42:56] done this side or the other but you see
[42:58] he rejected the the the leadership of
[43:01] Jesus Christ to eternal life and that
[43:04] the Bible said he said thou fool tonight
[43:08] your soul is required th we find him the
[43:11] next place in Hell lifting up his eyes
[43:15] and seeing that beggar that he turned
[43:17] out the street in the bosoms of Abraham
[43:21] what a fatal mistake how that the
[43:24] churches had had had had
[43:26] had been all right in the way that they
[43:28] went but they still hadn't had eternal
[43:30] life it reminds me of a sermon I
[43:32] preached here not long ago a thinking
[43:34] man's filter you might have had it I was
[43:37] going walking through the woods a
[43:38] squirrel hunting this far and looked
[43:40] down and of course I can't call the
[43:41] cigarette company youo and there laid a
[43:43] a cigarette pack laying there and I just
[43:45] passed by looking for in the woods and I
[43:48] seen that package laying there and I
[43:49] look back again it said a thinking man's
[43:52] filter a smoking man's
[43:55] taste the start walking on through woods
[43:57] and holy spirit said turn and pick that
[43:59] up I reached down and picked it up a
[44:02] thinking man's filter a smoking man's
[44:05] taste I thought a American firm here
[44:10] selling death under disguiser to their
[44:13] own American
[44:15] citizens a thinking man's
[44:19] filter you and a smoking man's taste as
[44:23] it's a world fair with you Brian or BR
[44:26] them up there when he giving all that
[44:27] test how they put one cigarette and draw
[44:30] the across of marble and took the ri
[44:32] wiped up the nicotine and put it on a
[44:34] rat's back a white rat in seven days he
[44:36] a full of cancer he couldn't
[44:38] walk and they said you know they say a
[44:41] filter said it's a gimmick sells more
[44:45] cigarettes it takes so much nicotine to
[44:48] satisfy that
[44:50] devil that's right and when you take a
[44:53] filter cigarette it takes about four
[44:55] cigarettes to take the place of one it's
[44:58] a gimmick to sell you more
[45:00] cigarettes you cannot have smoke unless
[45:03] you got tar and tar you got
[45:07] cancer see how it is and the blind
[45:10] Americans looking for a rabbit to come
[45:11] out of a hat somewhere they fall
[45:15] far you can't have it it's death I don't
[45:18] care which way you go it's death anywh
[45:20] you
[45:21] go a thinking man's filter a thinking
[45:24] man wouldn't smoke at all
[45:27] that's rightall he's got any thoughts at
[45:29] all well I thought that just can apply
[45:32] to the
[45:33] churches I think has God got a filter
[45:37] yes and every church has got a filter
[45:40] that's right they fil the ones that
[45:43] comes
[45:44] in and they let a lot of death in
[45:48] too how could you ever draw a
[45:51] denomination through God's
[45:54] filter how could you do do it how could
[45:56] you draw a bob haired woman through that
[46:01] filter tell
[46:05] me how could you ever draw a woman that
[46:07] wears slacks through there when it's an
[46:09] Abomination for her to put on a garment
[46:11] pertains to a man see God's filter would
[46:14] catch her out there it wouldn't let her
[46:16] come
[46:16] in but the church has got their own
[46:20] filters so I say that there is a
[46:23] thinking man's filler that's God's word
[46:25] and it suits a holy man's
[46:29] taste that's right a holy man not a
[46:31] church man but a holy man's taste
[46:34] because it's pure Holiness unadulterated
[46:37] word of God there is a thinking man's
[46:40] filter and church member I advise you to
[46:44] use that one because it brings in the
[46:47] world and one lump of it is death one
[46:50] lump leavens or one little leaven
[46:52] leavens the whole lump whosoever shall
[46:54] take one word out of this or add one
[46:56] word to it his part will be taken from
[46:58] The Book of Life at the Garden of Eden
[47:01] what caused death and all this sorrow
[47:03] ever heartache every little dying baby
[47:06] every rattle in the throat every
[47:08] ambulance screaming every hospital every
[47:10] graveyard was because Eve doubted one
[47:13] word amen not all of it it just
[47:15] perverted it now God said man there he
[47:19] was to keep every word of God now that's
[47:21] the first of the Bible in the middle of
[47:23] the Bible Jesus come and he said man
[47:26] shall not live by bread alone but by
[47:28] every word that proceedeth out of the
[47:30] mouth of God not just part of him
[47:31] everyone in the last of the Bible
[47:33] revelations 22 Jesus give the testimony
[47:36] of himself the revelation of his of the
[47:39] Bible is Jesus Christ and he said
[47:40] whosoever shall take one word out of
[47:43] here or add one word to it his part will
[47:46] be taken from the book of life and you
[47:48] go through that thinking man's filter
[47:50] you'll have a holy man's taste when you
[47:52] come out of there you'll have a saintly
[47:54] taste
[47:56] sister you that wear those clothes think
[47:58] of it you're go to you say I'm virtuous
[48:00] to my husband I'm virtuous to my
[48:02] boyfriend I'm a virtuous girl but what
[48:04] about that sinner looked at you when he
[48:06] answers for adultery who did
[48:08] it amen be guilty written in the word so
[48:12] it's but see oh be a thinking woman be a
[48:17] thinking man say my what if it does
[48:19] happen to be that way he said so and one
[48:21] word Can't
[48:23] Fail the great man told me not long go
[48:25] call me into his room so I'm going to
[48:27] lay hands on you brother BR you're
[48:28] ruining your
[48:29] ministry preaching such things I said
[48:32] any Ministry that the word of God will
[48:33] ruin ought to be ruined see he said I'll
[48:36] lay hands on he said you sent to pray
[48:38] for the sick I said Do You Believe those
[48:40] things brother he said no but it's not
[48:42] our business I said who business is it
[48:46] then well he said that's a pastor's
[48:48] business I look at the
[48:50] congregation that's right you see every
[48:54] year I pass through preaching these
[48:56] things and I think surely they get it
[48:57] next year come back is more than
[48:59] ever it goes to show that many are
[49:02] called but few are
[49:05] chosen the leadership is the holy spirit
[49:08] friend it leads you and guides you into
[49:10] all truth when he the Holy Ghost has
[49:12] come now think of that take the thinking
[49:16] man's filter that's the Bible not your
[49:19] Creed not your church you'll be lost
[49:22] take the thinking man's filter that's
[49:24] where that boy didn't think he took the
[49:27] church filter he become popular great
[49:30] man but in hell he lifted up his eyes
[49:33] being in torment now you take the
[49:35] thinking men's filter Jesus Christ the
[49:38] word and you'll desire a holy person's
[49:41] taste because it'll satisfy that if you
[49:43] got the holy spirit in you this
[49:45] satisfies it if the Holy Spirit isn't
[49:47] there you say well I don't think that
[49:48] means any difference Look What You've
[49:50] Done Right There same thing ' done right
[49:53] back in the same place now let's go a
[49:55] little farther father now let's take
[49:57] leave that man there that didn't use the
[49:59] thinking man's filter he refused to
[50:02] accept the leadership of Jesus Christ to
[50:04] eternal life now let us take another
[50:07] rich young businessman a
[50:10] ruler uh with the same opportunity that
[50:13] this man had and um except it he
[50:18] accepted the leadership of Christ now
[50:21] there's two of them in the Bible that
[50:23] we're going to talk about that when we
[50:24] see that refie said now let's take this
[50:27] man another rich young businessman and a
[50:32] ruler and he accepted the leadership the
[50:35] scriptures tell us about this fellow if
[50:37] you want to mark it down in Hebrews 11
[50:39] uh 23 to
[50:41] 29
[50:42] Moses by faith refused to be called the
[50:46] son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[50:49] rather to suffer the afflictions of God
[50:51] esteeming the reproach of Christ amen
[50:56] greater Treasures than all the treasures
[50:59] of Egypt amen see he accepted eternal
[51:02] life Moses estem the the uh the reproach
[51:06] of Christ greater Treasures than all the
[51:09] treasures the world had Moses esteem
[51:11] that the greatest now this rich man
[51:13] didn't and Moses was a rich young ruler
[51:19] to become a pharaoh he was Pharaoh's son
[51:23] and was heir to the throne and he looked
[51:26] out to the impossible a bunch of mud
[51:28] doers a bunch of slaves but by faith he
[51:33] saw the promise of God through the word
[51:36] that his people would sojourn in a
[51:38] Strange Land for 400 years but would be
[51:41] brought out by a mighty
[51:43] hand and he esteemed that Hallelujah
[51:47] greater riches and all the treasures of
[51:50] Egypt for he forsook Egypt not knowing
[51:54] where he was going amen he was led by
[51:57] Christ amen he forsook and he had his
[52:00] foot on the throne and could been been
[52:03] the next Pharaoh in Egypt but he has
[52:05] seen the reproach of Christ the
[52:08] reproach to be called that odd one amen
[52:12] be call that fanatic to take his place
[52:15] with the muddobbers and the Fanatics
[52:17] because he seen that the hour that the
[52:20] scripture was promised to be fulfilled
[52:22] was there then and oh Church wake up

[52:39] and mother Church anything else follow
[52:42] the leadership of the
[52:44] spirit let us follow this Christ for a
[52:47] few this Moses for a little while that
[52:49] did that let's watch his life the first
[52:52] thing when he accepted to take the
[52:55] reproach of Christ and forsake his
[52:59] education forsake all his wisdom he was
[53:02] taught in all the wisdom of the
[53:03] Egyptians and all of his popularity his
[53:07] throne his seler his kingship his crown
[53:10] everything he had he
[53:13] rejected and this other fell wanted it
[53:15] and refused Christ and this man refused
[53:18] that and accepted Christ and quickly
[53:21] what happened hallu he had to separate
[53:24] himself
[53:27] Hallelujah the word means praise our God
[53:31] it's too bad that we're forgetting
[53:33] it he rejected the Thrones and the
[53:37] popularity he could have had young girls
[53:41] by the wives by the hundreds and he
[53:43] could have had suppers under Egypt rule
[53:46] the world the world laid right at his
[53:49] feet and he was aired every bit of it
[53:51] but by looking in the scripture and
[53:53] seeing the day he was living in and no
[53:55] told that's something in
[53:57] him the predestinated seat of God went
[54:01] to work I don't care how poer you could
[54:03] be or how this you could be you could be
[54:05] a pres you could be a pastor you could

[54:12] been for ordained into you and you see
[54:14] the thing at hand it goes to work moving
[54:17] out like that start coming
[54:19] out can get it and he refused to be
[54:23] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[54:25] because he esteemed the reproach of
[54:27] Christ greater Treasures than all the
[54:30] riches of Egypt or the world he Hasen
[54:33] that watch what he done he followed it
[54:36] quickly he was ousted from his people

[1:01:59] the faithful servant who has steem the
[1:02:01] reproach of Christ greater Treasures
[1:02:04] than all the riches of Egypt he come to
[1:02:07] the end of the road an old man 120 years
[1:02:09] old walked up on the mountain and you
[1:02:12] know what a death they before he looked
[1:02:14] over into the promised land he looked
[1:02:16] land every side there was his leader The

[1:02:36] Elijah talking to Jesus before he went
[1:02:39] to the Cross 800 years after death the
[1:02:43] the one that he esteemed the reproach of

[1:06:17] Stern cut message brother but I didn't

[1:06:24] people just to try to make them sing
[1:06:26] shout holler I've been in Heathen
[1:06:29] meetings where they've done the same
[1:06:30] thing I'm interested in your life I'm a
[1:06:34] servant of God that's got to answer to
[1:06:36] God someday and the ministry that the
[1:06:38] Lord has giv me has Vindicated itself
[1:06:41] thousands of times before you am
[1:06:44] remember Jesus said follow me follow me
[1:06:49] get rid of what you've got and follow me
[1:06:52] that's the only way to have each eternal
[1:06:54] life that's the only remedy he give this
[1:06:56] man is the only remedy he give this
[1:06:58] businessman it's the only remedy he

[1:07:03] decision it's perfect every time and we
[1:07:06] must follow him is the only way to have
[1:07:09] eternal life so the
[1:07:11] leadership of God is followed the
[1:07:14] Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy
[1:07:17] Ghost let us bow our
[1:07:21] heads statement isn't it let's just take
[1:07:25] a just a quick moment he said so the
[1:07:29] leadership of God is individually
[1:07:34] now each individual is to follow the
[1:07:39] Vindicated word of the hour by the holy
[1:07:47] ghost that that it it's it's nice to
[1:07:52] have Fellowship it's nice to have church
[1:07:53] church we do everything we can to uh
[1:07:57] because we're a number of people coming
[1:08:00] together to have order and to do things
[1:08:03] decently in order we have uh brothers
[1:08:07] who donate their lives as deacons to
[1:08:11] watch out over things that we can keep
[1:08:13] things operating We Got Musicians who
[1:08:16] donate their time and and their effort
[1:08:19] so that we can worship and the ministry
[1:08:22] preaches and
[1:08:24] we do all those things but not one of
[1:08:27] them accounts for
[1:08:31] anything you've got to know the voice
[1:08:35] and follow the
[1:08:37] voice and that and I hope you understood
[1:08:41] what he's saying he says that's a choice
[1:08:44] that everybody has to come
[1:08:46] to and there's a
[1:08:49] price when you when it comes to make
[1:08:52] that choice and that's what religion
[1:08:55] does religion covers up the the choice
[1:08:59] it's like putting a code on you don't
[1:09:01] have to make the choice you just put on
[1:09:04] the same clothing everybody else around
[1:09:06] you but we we want that eternal life we
[1:09:10] want to get that goal and and as you
[1:09:12] notice that he said he said that every
[1:09:16] time that you make that choice there's a
[1:09:18] cost and are we willing to pay the price
[1:09:22] and then he said and the minute you make
[1:09:24] that choice there's always
[1:09:27] separation and and I I know it's hard
[1:09:32] but we all don't have the same life
[1:09:35] therefore we all don't have the same
[1:09:37] Choice you've got to follow the word as
[1:09:40] the word speaks your heart Faith cometh
[1:09:43] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:09:46] God so how can you make a choice if you
[1:09:48] don't listen to the word you don't
[1:09:51] fellowship with the word you don't get
[1:09:54] into the word it it it you you've got to
[1:09:57] come within the range of that voice and
[1:10:00] make that choice so I just hope it's a
[1:10:02] blessing to you tonight we we we'll
[1:10:05] close service now so let's stand
[1:10:11] together and and and I
[1:10:14] say you know seek ye first the kingdom
[1:10:17] of God and all else will be added unto
[1:10:21] you amen listen to your Shepherd listen
[1:10:25] for your Shepherd hear ye him and let
[1:10:28] him come near let us pray this evening
[1:10:31] before Billy comes lead us in the songs
[1:10:34] of worship and dismissal our gracious
[1:10:37] Heavenly Father we heard

[1:11:08] finally come to the end of giving his
[1:11:11] message and he looks out at all
[1:11:17] the church
[1:11:19] world and says you got to
[1:11:22] choose

[1:11:34] going to follow the what God saw is
[1:11:39] placed before

[1:11:45] choice you got to separate
[1:11:49] yourself from anything that's contrary
[1:11:52] to it

[1:11:58] on what you're going to feed on and what
[1:12:02] you're going to believe and what you're
[1:12:05] going to
[1:12:09] follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:12:12] Spirit through the Vindicated
