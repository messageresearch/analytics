[17:24] with you
[17:25] in the name of our lord jesus christ we
[17:27] pray
[17:28] amen
[17:32] good to be gathered in the house of god
[17:34] this morning amen i trust you're excited
[17:37] to be here you know the scripture says i
[17:39] was happy when they say unto me let's go
[17:41] in the house of the lord amen welcome
[17:43] all our visitors as you invite porter
[17:45] mike for so i'm reading this morning
[17:47] amen god bless you
[18:06] good morning
[18:11] going
[18:12] uh going to turn to psalm 66 this
[18:15] morning
[18:16] give the sound system a minute to
[18:19] calm down
[18:23] you know this scripture begins
[18:25] with the verse it should be familiar to
[18:28] all of us it says make a joyful noise
[18:31] unto god all ye lands
[18:34] sing forth the honor of his name and
[18:36] make his praise glorious
[18:38] say unto god how terrible
[18:41] or awesome
[18:42] art thou in thy works
[18:46] through the greatness of thy power shall
[18:48] thine enemies submit thyselves
[18:49] themselves unto thee
[18:52] such wonderful words of praise
[18:55] and i was thinking as i was reading that
[18:57] you know passages like this are commonly
[19:00] used in worship services
[19:02] throughout the land really
[19:05] you know as praise leaders
[19:07] rally the people
[19:09] into a
[19:11] spirit of praise and
[19:13] celebration
[19:16] their call to worship make a joyful
[19:18] noise unto the lord
[19:21] praise because they are in church
[19:25] you know while you know this is
[19:28] certainly a call to praise there's
[19:29] another interesting verse not too many
[19:32] verses down
[19:34] that seems like it's kind of in an odd
[19:36] place considering this call to worship
[19:38] this call to praise and it's verse 18
[19:42] it says if i regard iniquity in my heart
[19:47] the lord will not hear me
[19:50] you know it's kind of a
[19:53] sobering reminder sure but it seems so
[19:55] out of place
[19:57] with this
[19:58] chapter that would
[20:00] seem to call
[20:02] all people to praise
[20:06] you know it's uh
[20:08] we tend to look at that verse and think
[20:10] that it refers just a prayer
[20:13] you know and certainly that's true i
[20:15] mean james said that ye ask and receive
[20:17] not because he asked amiss
[20:19] that you may consume it upon your lusts
[20:23] but this particular chapter is also
[20:25] speaking of praise
[20:28] if i regard iniquity in my heart
[20:32] the lord will not hear me
[20:35] you know there's
[20:37] praise
[20:39] that the lord will not hear
[20:42] just as there's prayer that the lord
[20:43] will not hear
[20:47] why
[20:49] if i regard iniquity
[20:51] in my heart
[20:53] what is iniquity
[20:55] the first time it's mentioned is often a
[20:57] clue what the definition is it's in
[20:59] isaiah 53 6. it's turning everyone to
[21:03] his own
[21:04] way
[21:06] doing your own thing
[21:08] is iniquity
[21:11] your own way of prayer asking amiss
[21:15] your own way of praise
[21:17] praising amiss
[21:20] you know it's uh often that people come
[21:22] to church and they praise because it
[21:24] seems like it's the right thing to do
[21:26] they're in church you praise when you're
[21:28] in church
[21:29] you praise because you enjoy it
[21:31] or it feels good
[21:33] or it sounds good
[21:35] or it really hasn't been a decent
[21:38] service if there hasn't been praise
[21:41] if i regard iniquity of my heart
[21:45] it doesn't matter how much praise you do
[21:48] it's not about you
[21:50] it's not about how you feel
[21:52] it is not about the work you perform
[21:58] you know it's uh
[22:00] it's interesting that there is a verse
[22:02] right after that if i regard iniquity in
[22:04] my heart the lord will not hear me it's
[22:05] verse 17.
[22:08] it says but verily
[22:09] god
[22:10] hath
[22:11] heard
[22:12] me
[22:14] he hath attended to the voice of my
[22:18] prayer
[22:21] you know the chapter closes with a
[22:22] little bit of a different tone than it
[22:24] opens it says blessed be god
[22:28] which hath not turned away my prayer
[22:30] nor his mercy
[22:33] from me
[22:34] see the difference between prayer that
[22:36] is heard or praise that is heard
[22:38] and praise that is not heard
[22:42] is who is doing the work
[22:45] you see because acceptable praise is the
[22:48] result of a work that god has done
[22:53] but praise is not a work that you do
[22:56] and many go to church
[22:58] praising because it's the work that you
[23:00] do in church
[23:01] but praise is what you do because of the
[23:04] work he has done for
[23:06] you amen
[23:09] you know praise is iniquity
[23:11] when you do it because it feels good
[23:14] because you enjoy it
[23:15] because it sounds good because you're in
[23:18] church and it's the right thing to do
[23:20] because it's not it's not a good service
[23:22] if we don't praise that's all iniquity
[23:24] that's you doing your own way all right
[23:28] but when it's the result of his work
[23:32] you know it's uh
[23:34] the question is
[23:36] really
[23:37] has he done a work for you
[23:40] that's the real question and it's so
[23:42] funny when you listen to some of these
[23:44] worship services that go out in the land
[23:46] where there's this great call to make a
[23:48] joyful noise and at no point in time
[23:50] where there'll be a challenge or a
[23:51] testimony of the work that god has done
[23:54] for them individually
[23:56] it's just praise him for his mighty
[23:57] works well what work has he done for you
[24:01] and on that are
[24:02] silent acceptable praise is when it's
[24:06] based on a work that he has done
[24:08] for you
[24:10] as we read further
[24:12] into psalm 66 you know just think about
[24:14] it the individual personal experience is
[24:17] his acceptable praise
[24:19] if god ever came by
[24:21] and did something for you
[24:24] met your need
[24:25] spoke to you in your dark hour
[24:28] touched you
[24:30] you have a basis of praise
[24:33] you read further in psalm 66 notice what
[24:35] it says verse 5 come and see
[24:39] the works of the lord
[24:41] praise is a testimony
[24:43] your testimony
[24:45] of the works god has done for you
[24:49] you know something you've personally
[24:51] experienced not something you've heard
[24:53] about but something you've seen
[24:55] something you've experienced
[24:57] just even as you read through some of
[24:59] these works which holdeth our soul in
[25:02] life
[25:03] and suffereth not our feet to be moved
[25:07] the fact that your soul has been
[25:08] quickens to life
[25:10] and that you recognize that he has
[25:13] continued to hold you
[25:15] you have a basis of praise amen he has
[25:19] touched you
[25:21] you know it says that for thou o god has
[25:24] proved us
[25:25] thou has tried us
[25:27] as silver
[25:29] is tried
[25:30] if there's anyone in here come on that
[25:33] feels like they're being proved or have
[25:35] been proved and tried that's the hand of
[25:38] god on you you have a basis for praise
[25:43] you know it says in verse 12 we went
[25:45] through fire and through water but thou
[25:48] brought us us out into a wealthy place
[25:52] if you've ever felt him reach down and
[25:54] lift you up and put you in a wealthy
[25:56] place he's touched you personally you
[25:59] have a basis of praise
[26:03] it says in verse 16 come and hear all
[26:06] that fear god and i will declare what he
[26:09] hath done for my soul
[26:12] praise
[26:13] a testimony of what he has done
[26:16] for you
[26:17] not praise because it feels good
[26:19] not praise because you enjoy it
[26:21] not praise because it's the right thing
[26:23] to do in church not even because you
[26:27] believe that a true good church service
[26:29] hasn't happened if there hasn't been
[26:30] praise
[26:31] that's all iniquity
[26:33] and oh by the way you don't even have to
[26:34] be in church to do this
[26:36] praise as a result of his work not
[26:38] because of where you're at
[26:41] so it's important as we read that this
[26:43] morning make a joyful noise unto the
[26:45] lord
[26:46] that the basis for doing that is his
[26:49] hand
[26:49] on you
[26:50] let's read psalm 66 this morning
[26:54] starting in verse 1 make a joyful noise
[26:57] unto god all ye land
[26:59] sing forth the honor of his name make
[27:02] his praise glorious say unto god how
[27:05] terrible art thou in thy works through
[27:08] the greatness of thy power shall thine
[27:10] enemies submit themselves unto thee
[27:13] all the earth shall worship thee and
[27:15] shall sing unto thee they shall sing to
[27:17] thy name selah come and see the works of
[27:21] god he is terrible in his doing toward
[27:23] the children of men
[27:25] he turneth the sea into dry land they
[27:27] went through the flood on foot there did
[27:30] we rejoice in him he ruleth by his power
[27:33] forever his eyes behold the nations let
[27:37] not the rebellious exalt themselves
[27:39] selah o bless our god ye people and make
[27:42] the voice of his praise to be heard
[27:45] which holdeth our soul and life and
[27:47] suffereth not our feet to be moved for
[27:50] thou o god has proved us thou hast tried
[27:53] us as silver has tried thou brought us
[27:56] thus into the net thou laid its
[27:58] affliction upon our loins thou hast
[28:00] caused men to ride over our heads we
[28:03] went through fire and through water but
[28:05] thou brought us us out into a wealthy
[28:07] place
[28:08] i will go into thy house with burnt
[28:10] offerings i will pay thee my vows which
[28:13] my lips have uttered and my mouth hath
[28:16] spoken when i was in trouble i will
[28:18] offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of
[28:21] fatlings with the incense of rams i will
[28:24] offer bullocks with goats selah come and
[28:27] hear all ye that fear god and i will
[28:30] declare what he hath done for my soul i
[28:33] cried unto him with my mouth and he was
[28:35] extolled with my tongue if i regard
[28:38] iniquity in my heart the lord will not
[28:40] hear me but verily god hath heard me he
[28:44] hath attended to the voice of my prayer
[28:46] blessed be god which hath not turned
[28:49] away my prayer nor his mercy from me
[28:52] amen

[55:48] father in a time of
[55:51] so many voices
[55:55] so many ideas and
[55:58] different attitudes
[56:02] so many things pulling one way or the
[56:04] other
[56:05] [Music]
[56:08] so many things trying to captivate our
[56:11] minds
[56:12] for the battle is for our mind and in
[56:16] our mind
[56:19] through it all this confusion of what we
[56:21] call civilization and education and
[56:24] science
[56:26] there's still one truth
[56:28] there's still one god
[56:30] there's still one way
[56:32] and one life
[56:34] and we're here this morning father with
[56:36] our hearts
[56:38] desiring that your spirit would come and
[56:41] make
[56:42] more clear to us that way
[56:45] that we would increase in revelation and
[56:47] understanding of your will
[56:51] that we would grow in the knowledge of
[56:54] the power
[56:55] that you
[56:56] have and father how that that power can
[57:00] come in and rule in our lives
[57:03] we just ask you to bless us this morning
[57:06] father we also ask you to show your
[57:08] mercy on us
[57:11] and forgive us father for we're weak
[57:15] lord and we're
[57:17] made in flesh and shaped in sin and we
[57:20] came into this world speaking lies
[57:24] but through your love for us
[57:27] you've redeemed us
[57:30] and you're building in us a statue of a
[57:32] perfect man and capping us off with the
[57:35] capstone of your love
[57:37] father we want to grow into our heritage
[57:39] this morning
[57:41] we ask you to bless us
[57:43] in jesus precious and
[57:45] wonderful name we pray
[57:47] amen
[57:49] and amen god bless you this morning
[57:51] while you're standing let's open our
[57:53] bibles to
[57:55] we welcome any visitors that we have
[57:58] with us this morning and
[58:02] just trust that
[58:04] something that's said in the word of god
[58:06] today will help you and your life and
[58:09] you'll be blessed and and
[58:12] god's word will continue to grow
[58:15] let's turn over the scripture we've been
[58:17] reading it quite a bit these last few
[58:20] services and as we continue on
[58:24] our subject matter that we've been
[58:27] talking we don't
[58:29] necessarily call it
[58:32] a series by any means
[58:36] but
[58:37] you know this morning we're just we just
[58:39] want to talk about
[58:41] uh
[58:42] the
[58:43] coming together
[58:44] of the mechanics and the dynamics and
[58:48] and um and
[58:51] really what makes
[58:53] the church
[58:54] uh
[58:55] what she's supposed to be
[58:57] and uh
[58:59] it's hard to stay in god's plan
[59:01] and just let him to bring it to pass but
[59:04] we trust we can do that romans the 8th
[59:06] chapter and the 11th verse
[59:09] because this is what
[59:11] we are
[59:13] desiring and talking about this morning
[59:17] of taking possession of
[59:20] so we're talking about taking possession
[59:23] of a promise
[59:25] something that we know about that we've
[59:27] been told about
[59:29] that we're even been told as is ours
[59:32] and and this the difference between
[59:35] believing it
[59:36] and then taking hold of it and actually
[59:39] having it
[59:41] faith is a substance
[59:43] amen it's not a hope you know it's a
[59:47] substance of things that you used to
[59:49] hope for or you used to believe for
[59:52] that and then that hope
[59:55] that mechanic comes in
[59:57] to
[59:58] possession and you actually have it and
[1:00:01] then it becomes a dynamic so let us read
[1:00:04] here but if the spirit of him
[1:00:08] that raised up jesus from the dead
[1:00:12] dwelling you
[1:00:14] so that that's this is our key
[1:00:18] that we've got to have that same spirit
[1:00:20] that dwelt in him dwelling in us
[1:00:25] he
[1:00:26] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:00:29] also
[1:00:30] he said if it if
[1:00:33] but if the same spirit of him
[1:00:36] that raised up jesus
[1:00:38] from the dead dwell in you
[1:00:41] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:00:45] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:00:49] his spirit
[1:00:51] that dwelleth in you
[1:00:54] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[1:00:56] word to us in his precious name we pray
[1:00:59] amen
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:02] so you may be seated thank you
[1:01:09] i i better do something i wanted to read
[1:01:12] a quote off of my phone
[1:01:15] but i i don't know these things very
[1:01:17] well
[1:01:18] so i'm i just turned down the sound so i
[1:01:21] hope it doesn't vibrate
[1:01:23] i don't know how to read on the phone
[1:01:25] without
[1:01:28] having it on
[1:01:30] and i don't know if you can turn off
[1:01:31] phone calls or not so
[1:01:33] i don't know whoever invented these
[1:01:35] things
[1:01:37] spent a lot of time trying to make it
[1:01:39] difficult
[1:01:42] i'm surely that i'm sure they didn't
[1:01:44] have me in their mind
[1:01:46] when when they made it
[1:01:49] but we want to review a little bit this
[1:01:51] morning we're going to play another 11
[1:01:53] minutes
[1:01:54] this morning
[1:01:56] and i hope that you have
[1:01:58] maybe went
[1:02:00] ahead and got one of your
[1:02:02] on your phone or whatever
[1:02:05] instrument that you use
[1:02:07] i like the books myself personally i i
[1:02:11] like to have them
[1:02:13] i like to go through them and and
[1:02:17] you know mark them up and just
[1:02:20] until every
[1:02:22] line is colored with
[1:02:24] a marker and every
[1:02:26] word has a
[1:02:28] underline under it as it as it becomes
[1:02:31] alive
[1:02:32] but
[1:02:33] you know it that you would have joined
[1:02:35] in
[1:02:36] with us
[1:02:37] on this study because you know you know
[1:02:39] that we're we're reading for and and
[1:02:42] gleaning if you could say the many
[1:02:45] nuggets and and truths that are hid
[1:02:48] within this great sermon
[1:02:50] that our messenger preached to us and
[1:02:53] this is a wonderful
[1:02:55] message it has a key
[1:02:58] like you know
[1:02:59] you know that the word of god is like a
[1:03:02] key
[1:03:02] uh we heard the sermon a door within a
[1:03:05] door
[1:03:06] and and you have the key that opens that
[1:03:10] door
[1:03:10] and so as you're going through life's
[1:03:12] journey maybe through school or when
[1:03:15] where you start to come in life and and
[1:03:18] of course the enemy comes in in your
[1:03:20] early teenage years your body's
[1:03:23] developing getting its different uh
[1:03:27] separations of of feelings and emotions
[1:03:31] and and the enemy comes in and
[1:03:35] then he offers you choices
[1:03:38] he he presents you stuff and presents
[1:03:41] you thinking and present you thoughts
[1:03:44] and
[1:03:45] and and emotions in in your flesh and
[1:03:49] you're caught in a battleground where
[1:03:51] where you all of a sudden there's you
[1:03:53] realize there's another force in another
[1:03:56] spirit in the world and it's beckoning
[1:03:59] you
[1:04:00] and it's calling you
[1:04:02] and and it begins to work in your mind
[1:04:04] with reason
[1:04:06] and
[1:04:07] and you have five senses now that are
[1:04:10] activated you see things that you've
[1:04:13] never seen before you feel things that
[1:04:15] you've never felt before and you're
[1:04:18] you're in this emotional turmoil and
[1:04:21] this turmoil of the five senses and then
[1:04:24] you begin to develop feelings you know
[1:04:26] what i mean you get your feelings hurt
[1:04:29] and and then you start protecting your
[1:04:31] feelings and you're caught up and yet
[1:04:34] all this time there's another force
[1:04:36] that's trying to captivate you
[1:04:39] and draw you in and make you a part of
[1:04:43] his kingdom
[1:04:45] and it's slavery
[1:04:49] you know he he's got to keep his great
[1:04:51] machine going and so he'll try to he'll
[1:04:54] get you in a walk of life and he'll
[1:04:56] you'll labor and you'll work and
[1:04:58] then you'll you'll uh
[1:05:01] you know try to achieve and he's always
[1:05:03] hanging a carrot
[1:05:05] above to your nose and and then if life
[1:05:09] is hard and there's struggles there well
[1:05:11] then he's got drugs and alcohol and all
[1:05:14] kinds of things to try to
[1:05:17] make life easier on you and and people
[1:05:20] just don't know where they're going
[1:05:24] they don't know what the end of the
[1:05:26] matter is
[1:05:28] and so now we have a wonderful
[1:05:31] wonderful
[1:05:34] gospel
[1:05:36] that it
[1:05:37] comes
[1:05:38] to tell us what the truth is
[1:05:41] and set us free from the captivation
[1:05:45] of the world
[1:05:48] and
[1:05:49] the wages
[1:05:51] of sin
[1:05:52] is death
[1:05:54] and you got the the definition of death
[1:05:57] is not going to a graveyard
[1:06:00] and and just
[1:06:02] laying somebody to rest as we would say
[1:06:06] i just got back this friday i flew to
[1:06:08] missouri to do a funeral for
[1:06:11] a sister and
[1:06:13] and you know a wonderful testimony
[1:06:16] wonderful sister and we've committed her
[1:06:18] back to the earth because that's where
[1:06:20] she came from
[1:06:22] but that's not death
[1:06:24] because she didn't die
[1:06:30] because she had life
[1:06:33] death is eternal separation from god
[1:06:38] that's what death is
[1:06:41] you know
[1:06:42] and that that's what hell is hell is the
[1:06:46] consuming fire that separates you from
[1:06:50] god
[1:06:52] for eternity
[1:06:54] until you're not
[1:06:56] that's death
[1:06:58] not this 70 years 80 years that god
[1:07:01] gives us or how many it ever years that
[1:07:05] he allots us and then our spirit leaves
[1:07:08] this body and this body they put it in a
[1:07:11] box and
[1:07:12] and maybe if you're fortunate somebody
[1:07:15] missed you
[1:07:16] you know others might be singing thank
[1:07:19] the lord you're dead this is the
[1:07:21] happiest day in my life
[1:07:23] you know it's the nicest thing you ever
[1:07:25] did for me was die
[1:07:28] you know but that's not what this is all
[1:07:30] about
[1:07:32] so we've got to rise above this flesh
[1:07:36] we've got to rise above this
[1:07:39] uh
[1:07:40] our our carnal mind
[1:07:43] because the carnal mind and the fleshly
[1:07:46] mind is at enmity with god
[1:07:50] in other words it's at a it's in a
[1:07:52] battle with god it's warring against god
[1:07:56] it's it
[1:07:58] it's kicking against the prick it's
[1:08:00] fighting against what god's real plan is
[1:08:03] for our lives so you can't think
[1:08:06] carnally
[1:08:07] and get anywhere with god
[1:08:11] you've got to we got to continually
[1:08:14] shake
[1:08:15] that carnal mind off of us we've got to
[1:08:17] continually
[1:08:19] shake the worldly thinking off of us
[1:08:24] education knowledge science politics uh
[1:08:28] opinions
[1:08:30] we've got to continually fight those out
[1:08:32] of our lives and the way we fight those
[1:08:35] out of our lives is with the washing of
[1:08:37] the water of god's word
[1:08:41] that's what cleanses us
[1:08:45] that's why you read your bible
[1:08:47] that's why you pray
[1:08:49] that's why you
[1:08:50] uh place yourself in a sermon study and
[1:08:56] and get into the presence of the lord
[1:08:59] it is to wash you
[1:09:03] to wash you clean to set
[1:09:06] to what it would what do they call it a
[1:09:08] reset
[1:09:10] to reset your mind i think they call it
[1:09:13] sometimes refocusing to refocus to get
[1:09:17] back in line with what is the real
[1:09:21] objective here
[1:09:23] [Music]
[1:09:24] what is the real plan here what is the
[1:09:27] real goal here what is the real end here
[1:09:32] um i know that
[1:09:35] we we have a natural survival
[1:09:39] tendency
[1:09:42] so we want to eat
[1:09:44] you know even our messenger told us he
[1:09:46] said when a man gets hungry enough he'll
[1:09:48] eat anything
[1:09:52] you know
[1:09:53] we're very fortunate that we haven't
[1:09:55] come to that
[1:09:57] place yet
[1:09:59] but you know it's going to be a real
[1:10:01] test one of these days
[1:10:03] i think we're just entering into the
[1:10:05] testing ground now
[1:10:08] people said well when people became
[1:10:10] critics of the message
[1:10:12] they thought that was the
[1:10:14] great falling away no i think the
[1:10:17] great falling away has hasn't even
[1:10:19] really begun yet
[1:10:21] because it's going to be so personal i
[1:10:24] think we're going to be forced with such
[1:10:27] great
[1:10:28] personal challenges
[1:10:31] and such pressure
[1:10:33] financially and mentally to just to give
[1:10:37] up
[1:10:38] you know what i mean and quit the
[1:10:40] pursuit and quit the fight
[1:10:44] that it's going to be so hard to hang on
[1:10:47] and he's just going to try to press it
[1:10:49] down to where there's such a few but now
[1:10:52] is when we need to fortify ourselves and
[1:10:55] and to make sure that we're driving that
[1:10:57] race not right out on the edge but pull
[1:11:00] right back out close to the mountain and
[1:11:03] drive as close to the word of god as we
[1:11:06] can
[1:11:08] so as we talk about this great review
[1:11:11] the ultimate end of the believer
[1:11:15] is the reward
[1:11:20] we are living in rapture time
[1:11:24] now some of us i hope i'm here for the
[1:11:26] rapture
[1:11:28] i had a a a greater hope of that
[1:11:32] when i was 20 years old
[1:11:35] than i do when i'm 72 years old
[1:11:40] you know
[1:11:41] sitting here this morning i could look
[1:11:43] down the road and i could look at my
[1:11:46] friends that have passed away at 80 and
[1:11:49] 82 and 78 and
[1:11:52] and and you know 85 86 and i sit back
[1:11:57] well that's 10 years
[1:12:01] and i could actually sit here and think
[1:12:03] i might by the grace of god have 10 more
[1:12:06] years 15 more years
[1:12:08] 15 year
[1:12:09] years from now i'd be 87 years old that
[1:12:13] is not very law
[1:12:19] amen each precious
[1:12:22] moment
[1:12:24] you know becomes precious
[1:12:27] and i trust that god will
[1:12:30] will
[1:12:30] place his spirit in my heart and in my
[1:12:34] mind and get my mind on the right things
[1:12:39] so that the time that i'm allotted is
[1:12:42] allotted for him
[1:12:46] now that's the way an old man looks at
[1:12:48] it
[1:12:49] but a young person ought to look at it
[1:12:51] like this he may come any day now
[1:12:57] physically i might be able to live
[1:12:59] another 150 years
[1:13:03] but
[1:13:04] this world may not have 50 years this
[1:13:07] life may not have 50 years you may not
[1:13:10] have 50 years let alone how many young
[1:13:14] people are
[1:13:15] are
[1:13:16] i lose their lives every year to many
[1:13:19] different circumstances sicknesses death
[1:13:22] heart attacks all kinds of things we
[1:13:24] don't know the time that we've got
[1:13:25] allotted but we ought to take heed that
[1:13:28] what we're working for is to make that
[1:13:32] rapture
[1:13:36] don't let satan try to talk you out of
[1:13:39] it that there's no such thing
[1:13:42] one of the very first lies he tells is
[1:13:44] that he don't exist
[1:13:47] i'm not for real
[1:13:51] anyway
[1:13:52] some
[1:13:54] i don't know who caused all this sin and
[1:13:56] misery and sickness and death but he
[1:13:58] don't take
[1:13:59] credit for it
[1:14:02] even though he's the cause of it
[1:14:04] so we understand that we're pursuing
[1:14:07] something here
[1:14:09] this morning
[1:14:12] and we have a revelation
[1:14:15] that
[1:14:17] god had a plan in the beginning
[1:14:20] amen
[1:14:22] and he has an elect people
[1:14:26] a people that were a part of him
[1:14:30] in the beginning
[1:14:32] and those people are possessors of
[1:14:35] eternal life
[1:14:38] and their possessors of eternal life is
[1:14:42] because god
[1:14:44] knew them in his heart and in his mind
[1:14:48] from the beginning
[1:14:50] so we read here if i could read this he
[1:14:53] said
[1:14:57] he's talking about when he was in
[1:14:59] arizona and in the
[1:15:01] great cloud that we have a picture here
[1:15:04] of came down and he got caught up in the
[1:15:07] vision and and he said
[1:15:10] and so there he spoke to me and said the
[1:15:13] seven seals will be open
[1:15:16] the seven mysteries and this is in
[1:15:19] paragraph twelve
[1:15:21] the the seven mysteries seven-fold
[1:15:24] mysteries of the bible
[1:15:26] that's been closed up since the
[1:15:28] foundation of the world
[1:15:31] will be revealed
[1:15:34] now think of the day that you're living
[1:15:36] in how blessed and privileged you are
[1:15:42] to be in a time and an age
[1:15:46] when things that were in the bible
[1:15:50] but they were hid and there was
[1:15:53] mysteries
[1:15:54] that were hid since the foundation of
[1:15:56] the world and you are the people that
[1:16:00] has been chosen for him to reveal that
[1:16:04] to you
[1:16:07] everybody had that opportunity
[1:16:11] but god provided a way
[1:16:14] that he was going to do it
[1:16:16] and that way was that he was going to
[1:16:18] reveal these mysteries through the
[1:16:21] ministry of the son of man in other
[1:16:24] words he was going to be the one that
[1:16:26] opened this mystery he was going to be
[1:16:29] the one that revealed it but he would
[1:16:33] choose a chosen vessel
[1:16:36] a man
[1:16:37] that had the ministry of being a prophet
[1:16:41] in other words he could hear from god
[1:16:43] lift a ear
[1:16:44] god could show him things without
[1:16:47] driving them totally insane
[1:16:51] how would you like an angel to appear to
[1:16:53] you you know i'd like an angel of
[1:16:55] hearing i'll guarantee you'd probably
[1:16:56] find yourself in the nut house
[1:17:02] because every single devil would say oh
[1:17:04] you're insane you're just saying you're
[1:17:06] that and then how would you like to go
[1:17:07] tell somebody
[1:17:13] let's have a mini taste test of faith i
[1:17:15] just come out of my office and i say an
[1:17:17] angel just appeared to me and billy a
[1:17:19] real man a real angel i really saw him
[1:17:23] and this is what he told me
[1:17:28] i know you
[1:17:31] i've worked with you ain't no angel ever
[1:17:33] talked to you when you were working with
[1:17:35] me
[1:17:40] you know what i mean the first thing
[1:17:42] would be there be a doubt
[1:17:46] i mean just think of it why did you
[1:17:49] believe it
[1:17:57] you know okay
[1:17:58] and
[1:17:59] and so i i'm just sitting here just
[1:18:01] figure we got 2 000 people here i don't
[1:18:03] know why i'm going down this road but i
[1:18:05] am
[1:18:06] and it and i look over there and i say
[1:18:08] you right there with that little boy on
[1:18:11] you not quite sleeping but anyway
[1:18:14] and you know you've done this and this
[1:18:16] and you're from here
[1:18:21] you think
[1:18:22] everybody believed
[1:18:24] it at the same time
[1:18:27] there was soo sayer fortune teller oh
[1:18:30] it's fixed it's planned the usher put
[1:18:33] him there i saw the usher see them there
[1:18:35] it's a gimmick it's a thing how would
[1:18:37] you like to face all that stuff no
[1:18:40] a prophet's made a certain way
[1:18:47] he's made to hear
[1:18:51] and handle
[1:18:54] the word of god
[1:18:55] it's a special being
[1:18:58] a special person he's got a special way
[1:19:01] in fact it's so much so that even the
[1:19:03] formation of his mouth was by god that
[1:19:07] he could speak the words just the way he
[1:19:09] speaks the sentence construction
[1:19:13] even of the words that the sentences
[1:19:15] that he's spoken
[1:19:17] is so designed to connect
[1:19:23] so there's an elected people here
[1:19:27] a chosen people
[1:19:30] and we we understand you've got to
[1:19:33] understand that you are that people.
[1:19:38] that's why the scripture says that who
[1:19:40] can lay anything to the charge of god's
[1:19:43] elect
[1:19:45] why because the seed of god remaineth in
[1:19:49] them
[1:19:51] satan may trick you
[1:19:53] he may trap you you may stumble you may
[1:19:57] fall but he'll send that word
[1:20:00] to contact that seed
[1:20:03] and to bring you back to repentance
[1:20:09] so we find out that the that there's
[1:20:11] this special being was brought in at a
[1:20:14] special time under a special sign under
[1:20:17] a special astrological sign all all
[1:20:20] things perfectly planned according to
[1:20:22] god
[1:20:24] and he said that was
[1:20:26] that's been closed up since the
[1:20:28] foundation of the world will be revealed
[1:20:32] and we
[1:20:35] yet a humble little group
[1:20:38] compared with all the world
[1:20:41] we've enjoyed these blessings
[1:20:46] hearing
[1:20:47] those
[1:20:48] mysteries
[1:20:52] praise god
[1:20:54] thank you lord
[1:20:56] why you
[1:21:00] i don't know
[1:21:02] why me
[1:21:04] i certainly don't know
[1:21:06] he didn't have to do it
[1:21:09] but he did
[1:21:16] so don't let the world talk you out of
[1:21:20] your privilege
[1:21:21] and your blessing
[1:21:23] tell me what the world has to offer you
[1:21:27] back in the old days maybe they'd offer
[1:21:29] you a horse and buggy
[1:21:34] or if you if you took this job or you
[1:21:36] get something i'll give you a horse
[1:21:38] how many would like a horse today
[1:21:44] a horse is a liability
[1:21:46] it's an expense
[1:21:50] it costs you
[1:21:52] nobody wants a horse
[1:21:58] but that was a big blessing
[1:22:02] you got hung on the spot if you stole
[1:22:04] the man's heart
[1:22:07] see the world
[1:22:08] changes
[1:22:10] there's only one thing that doesn't
[1:22:12] change
[1:22:13] and that's god's word that's god's plan
[1:22:17] that's what remains the same
[1:22:20] so we gotta reass we gotta have a reset
[1:22:24] we've got to have a refocus
[1:22:26] we've got to have a shaking we've got to
[1:22:28] come back to a real a reality of what's
[1:22:32] real
[1:22:33] this world is not real it's not real
[1:22:36] because it's ever changing and now it's
[1:22:39] out of control and doesn't even know
[1:22:42] where it's going
[1:22:44] the world's looking for a savior
[1:22:49] that's going to come
[1:22:51] and straighten it all out
[1:22:53] and it's going to get one and it's going
[1:22:55] to be the antichrist
[1:23:01] and people will be
[1:23:03] serving
[1:23:04] satan thinking they're serving god
[1:23:08] they're thinking they're going to say oh
[1:23:09] finally peace
[1:23:13] and prosperity
[1:23:15] and then come sudden destruction
[1:23:20] you don't understand what a wonderful
[1:23:22] repeat that we're in right now
[1:23:25] the prophet of god when he brought this
[1:23:27] message what was he talking about
[1:23:29] the nuclear bombs
[1:23:33] remember he said watch russia
[1:23:35] watch russia
[1:23:37] what's everybody doing right now
[1:23:44] they're all watching russia
[1:23:47] russia russia russia russia russia
[1:23:52] you know what scares me brother tim's
[1:23:54] what the catholic church is doing behind
[1:23:56] the scene
[1:23:59] i think there is just a little meeting
[1:24:00] here
[1:24:02] pope getting involved
[1:24:06] you know who holds the world economy
[1:24:11] yeah people want bailing out you know
[1:24:13] who can bail them out is the vatican
[1:24:18] there's no telling what's going on but
[1:24:20] we don't have to worry about all that
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:24:24] what we have to worry about is my sheep
[1:24:27] hear my
[1:24:29] and another they will not follow my
[1:24:32] sheep hear my voice
[1:24:36] so here we are
[1:24:38] we're this privileged little hunger
[1:24:40] group hearing those mysteries
[1:24:42] hearing that voice
[1:24:45] hearing the voice that is telling us
[1:24:49] what is truth remember modern events are
[1:24:53] made clear by prophecy modern events
[1:24:56] don't
[1:24:57] don't bring the prophecy to pass the
[1:25:00] prophecy already told you what the
[1:25:02] modern events will be and our messenger
[1:25:06] already told us that the mess that this
[1:25:09] world would be in
[1:25:13] we're not surprised
[1:25:21] he told us about the homosexual spirit
[1:25:23] when it was still in the closet
[1:25:29] but what do they call it
[1:25:31] coming out
[1:25:33] coming out of the closet
[1:25:36] well we knew you were in there
[1:25:44] right
[1:25:45] we were expecting you
[1:25:47] because the prophet told us as it was in
[1:25:49] the days of sodom and gomorrah so shall
[1:25:52] it be in the revealing
[1:25:54] of the son of man
[1:26:00] it doesn't matter what god did back 20
[1:26:02] years ago it's the revealing of the son
[1:26:05] of man to you
[1:26:06] as a person deity in flesh
[1:26:10] deity in your flesh is the revelation of
[1:26:14] the son of man
[1:26:27] marriage and divorce
[1:26:32] serpent seed
[1:26:33] all these different questions has been
[1:26:36] completely revealed to us
[1:26:39] not by man
[1:26:41] but by god
[1:26:43] himself
[1:26:46] that's opened those seven mysteries
[1:26:50] now the seven mysteries of what
[1:26:55] of what the church was
[1:27:00] so what was she
[1:27:02] she was the female
[1:27:04] part
[1:27:05] of adam
[1:27:12] it's what she was
[1:27:14] the bride
[1:27:16] she's separated from
[1:27:18] adam
[1:27:20] that's why
[1:27:22] the first adam was a living soul
[1:27:24] the second adam is a what
[1:27:27] a quickening spirit
[1:27:29] what's he going to quicken he's going to
[1:27:32] quicken
[1:27:34] his female part
[1:27:36] his bride back to life
[1:27:43] oh this is good
[1:27:49] if i could stand to look at myself i'd
[1:27:50] preach in the mirror
[1:27:57] that opened those missions of what the
[1:27:58] church was so what she was okay
[1:28:02] how it was in christ at the beginning
[1:28:07] okay we've been through those now this
[1:28:09] is actually what's going on right now if
[1:28:11] i could say it this way
[1:28:14] and how it would be revealed in the last
[1:28:18] days
[1:28:20] so how is this church going to be
[1:28:22] revealed in the last day how is this
[1:28:26] bride
[1:28:27] going to be quick and delight
[1:28:30] now and i don't just mean made alive
[1:28:32] you're all breathing
[1:28:34] i think
[1:28:37] you know i mean there's some people that
[1:28:39] are dead while they live
[1:28:42] but i don't want to be in that group
[1:28:45] do you
[1:28:46] but brought to life
[1:28:49] not living
[1:28:51] because there was a book
[1:28:53] that held people that were living
[1:28:58] that were alive they're alive they don't
[1:29:00] have nothing to do with god they're
[1:29:01] alive they live they work they eat they
[1:29:03] go to sleep they're going to die and and
[1:29:06] what their judgment is not mine to make
[1:29:10] but there's another people
[1:29:13] that are alive
[1:29:16] because they've come to the realization
[1:29:20] and the full understanding of where they
[1:29:22] come from who they are and where they're
[1:29:25] going
[1:29:28] now those people are really alive
[1:29:31] because they already know their future
[1:29:40] you know your end
[1:29:42] you are already sitting in heavenly
[1:29:45] places in christ jesus
[1:29:49] you're not going to live you live now
[1:29:52] you possess eternal life
[1:29:55] you know you have a place at the wedding
[1:29:59] supper
[1:30:03] you are alive that's right because there
[1:30:06] is no doubt of your future amen
[1:30:10] in fact you know where you're going and
[1:30:13] you know you're going to get there
[1:30:15] because he said so
[1:30:20] think of it
[1:30:21] that's the lamb's
[1:30:24] book of life
[1:30:28] those are those that what
[1:30:31] had eternal life
[1:30:33] if you have eternal life you what
[1:30:36] always had eternal life why because your
[1:30:40] name was on the lamb's book of life
[1:30:44] nothing can put it on there
[1:30:46] nothing can take it off
[1:30:50] i've looked at my life
[1:30:52] and i'm ashamed of it
[1:30:54] but a lot of my life has been an effort
[1:30:56] to take my name off the lamb's book of
[1:30:58] life
[1:31:02] but
[1:31:03] he said it
[1:31:05] that settled it
[1:31:08] the gift of god is eternal life lest any
[1:31:12] man should boast
[1:31:14] he settled it before i could mess it up
[1:31:22] think of it
[1:31:24] and then he will do whatever he has to
[1:31:27] do
[1:31:29] to bring your life into conformance with
[1:31:32] his perfect will no matter how many
[1:31:35] times you take his permissive will how
[1:31:37] many time you turn down his advice how
[1:31:40] many time you put against the holy
[1:31:42] spirit he will win
[1:31:45] i read the back of the book and we win
[1:31:56] so now he's revealing her
[1:31:59] or bringing her to life
[1:32:02] or resurrecting her
[1:32:04] what a resurrection that was when he
[1:32:07] came out of the grave what a
[1:32:09] resurrection this is of the bride rising
[1:32:14] up in this last days out of a dead
[1:32:18] denominational worldly
[1:32:20] system
[1:32:24] and rising to life
[1:32:27] by the hearing of the word of god
[1:32:32] jesus had the power
[1:32:34] in him
[1:32:36] not only to turn
[1:32:37] water into wine
[1:32:40] feed thou five thousands with a few
[1:32:42] loaves and fishes
[1:32:44] heal the blind the lame the leopard
[1:32:48] raise the dead
[1:32:50] but raise himself from the dead
[1:32:55] the first fruits
[1:32:57] of somebody coming up from the dead
[1:32:59] even though he typed it
[1:33:01] in many so a few others in the bible
[1:33:04] that came to life but he had to lay it
[1:33:07] in shadow so we could recognize it in
[1:33:10] the flesh
[1:33:14] now
[1:33:15] he's going to share
[1:33:19] that
[1:33:21] power
[1:33:23] and life
[1:33:26] the same life and power
[1:33:28] that raised him from the dead that he
[1:33:30] possessed to do all those works all
[1:33:33] those signs and wonders even to the
[1:33:35] place of laying his life down and taking
[1:33:38] it up again
[1:33:40] whatever that power was
[1:33:47] that spirit
[1:33:49] that ability
[1:33:52] which is beyond our comprehension
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:33:57] he
[1:34:01] came
[1:34:03] and went to calvary
[1:34:07] that the chastisement
[1:34:10] or the punishment
[1:34:12] of our sins
[1:34:15] would be on him
[1:34:19] so he paid
[1:34:21] the price of what you did wrong
[1:34:24] you stole the you you stole the cookie
[1:34:26] out of the cookie jar
[1:34:28] and you would get your little hand slap
[1:34:31] he put his hand there
[1:34:35] the father was going to give you a
[1:34:37] whooping for stealing that and drinking
[1:34:39] and getting drunk and smoking and
[1:34:41] wrecking the car and
[1:34:42] lusting and doing all the other stuff
[1:34:44] that we do gossip
[1:34:49] and god's ready to give you a weapon he
[1:34:51] steps in
[1:34:55] he takes the chastisement he takes the
[1:34:57] punishment he pays the price now
[1:35:00] therefore that cannot be laid on you
[1:35:04] because he already took it
[1:35:09] and if he could lay down on you that
[1:35:12] means that the punishment that he took
[1:35:14] was ineffective
[1:35:16] no good
[1:35:17] and didn't accomplish anything
[1:35:24] why do you punish yourself
[1:35:29] we have not because we
[1:35:31] believe not
[1:35:33] and we ask not
[1:35:35] and we ask not because we believe not
[1:35:39] you got guilt ask him to get rid of it
[1:35:41] he already took it
[1:35:43] you're not asking for the guilt to go
[1:35:45] away what you're asking for is a
[1:35:48] revelation of what that he's done for
[1:35:50] you
[1:35:53] beautiful hallelujah
[1:35:58] just to think a wretch like me
[1:36:02] a dog
[1:36:05] worse than snail trail
[1:36:10] that's how low
[1:36:12] he loved
[1:36:14] came
[1:36:15] and died
[1:36:16] that not one of those sins would be put
[1:36:21] on your record
[1:36:23] and when god pulls your name out
[1:36:27] he don't see red
[1:36:29] he don't see nothing he sees white
[1:36:32] because he's looking through the blood
[1:36:34] of his son
[1:36:36] and red on red makes white
[1:36:42] really put white
[1:36:44] next one white
[1:36:48] why
[1:36:50] because of the calvary
[1:36:53] now
[1:36:55] that would have been good right
[1:36:58] at least our sins were forgiven but what
[1:37:00] good of it do if we remained in the
[1:37:02] grave
[1:37:07] what does it do if you have no hope
[1:37:10] we do not sorrow as others do that have
[1:37:13] no hope
[1:37:16] but we know that
[1:37:18] we too will be changed in the twinkling
[1:37:21] of an eye
[1:37:22] to get meet the lord in the air
[1:37:25] brethren i would not have you be
[1:37:27] ignorant of them which are asleep
[1:37:29] oh let's read it
[1:37:32] oh that's good that thessalonians
[1:37:35] i think is second second thessalonians
[1:37:37] 4. we ought to just read that that's
[1:37:38] just how there is to it
[1:37:46] 413. this is nowhere near my notes and
[1:37:50] we're going to play 11 minutes i don't
[1:37:52] know what's happening with me
[1:37:56] but i would not have
[1:37:58] you be
[1:37:59] ignorant brethren concerning them which
[1:38:02] are asleep
[1:38:05] that ye sorrow not even as others which
[1:38:09] have no hope
[1:38:13] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:38:16] arose again
[1:38:18] even so
[1:38:20] then also
[1:38:22] them also which sleep in jesus will god
[1:38:27] bring with him
[1:38:30] for as we say unto you by the word of
[1:38:33] the lord that we which are alive and
[1:38:36] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[1:38:38] not prevent them that are asleep
[1:38:41] hallelujah
[1:38:43] whether i go by the grave whether i go
[1:38:45] by any other means i don't care because
[1:38:48] i still live
[1:38:52] we got these promises on both sides of
[1:38:55] the river
[1:38:59] isn't it wonderful
[1:39:03] for this we say unto you
[1:39:05] by the word of the lord that we which
[1:39:08] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[1:39:11] the lord shall not prevent them which
[1:39:14] are asleep
[1:39:16] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:39:18] heaven
[1:39:21] oh my you just want to jump right into
[1:39:23] the rapture tape right now
[1:39:27] with a shout
[1:39:29] with the voice of an archangel
[1:39:31] and with the trump of god
[1:39:33] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:39:40] you know there's a lot of dead people
[1:39:42] in christ that are alive
[1:39:50] and there is a resurrection going on
[1:39:52] right now in a rapture right now
[1:39:55] of bringing people that are in the
[1:39:57] darkness
[1:39:59] of their minds in the darkness of sin in
[1:40:02] the darkness of denomination who have no
[1:40:05] idea they're the elect lady bride of
[1:40:07] christ
[1:40:08] part of the rapture and those people
[1:40:11] right now are being resurrected by the
[1:40:14] word that was spoken through the mouth
[1:40:17] of malachi 4 5.
[1:40:20] it's a resurrection happening right now
[1:40:25] you may be coming to life this morning
[1:40:29] in the battle of your mind right now
[1:40:32] you may be
[1:40:33] considering for the first time that you
[1:40:36] need to have a life that's totally
[1:40:38] committed to the rapture
[1:40:44] and you're going to resurrect out of
[1:40:45] your habits
[1:40:47] you're going to resurrect out of your
[1:40:48] darkness
[1:40:51] you're going to resurrect into life and
[1:40:53] liberty in christ jesus and be filled
[1:40:56] with the spirit that is a resurrection
[1:41:01] that's this
[1:41:02] resurrection but there's also those that
[1:41:05] have gone on before
[1:41:10] then we which are alive and remain will
[1:41:13] be caught up together with them in the
[1:41:15] clouds
[1:41:17] to meet the lord in the air
[1:41:19] and so shall we ever be
[1:41:22] with
[1:41:23] the lord
[1:41:25] now that power that brought him out
[1:41:28] he's going to share this power with his
[1:41:30] bride
[1:41:34] and this is a lot more teaching but
[1:41:37] the bride
[1:41:40] so
[1:41:41] the life that was in him
[1:41:44] just like it was in eve
[1:41:48] that life came out of
[1:41:50] adam
[1:41:52] eve's life came out of adam
[1:41:56] so this eve's
[1:41:59] if life
[1:41:59] understand the second adam is a what
[1:42:02] a quickening spirit
[1:42:04] so now he has the spirit
[1:42:08] oh i hope i can say this right
[1:42:10] to put the life right
[1:42:13] back in
[1:42:15] eve
[1:42:16] that's right
[1:42:19] and you didn't sin
[1:42:22] eeps
[1:42:24] sinned
[1:42:26] but adam went out after her
[1:42:30] as a living soul
[1:42:32] do you know that jesus was the
[1:42:36] son
[1:42:38] that eve would have had
[1:42:41] if she waited
[1:42:45] everybody we would have been here
[1:42:48] how was
[1:42:50] how was jesus made
[1:42:52] not by any part of mary
[1:42:55] not by any part of joseph but it was
[1:42:57] spoken in the life
[1:43:00] that's exactly what would have happened
[1:43:02] to eve every predestinated son would
[1:43:06] have come in the perfect plan of god by
[1:43:09] spoken word
[1:43:11] and it would have been formed out of the
[1:43:13] earth and brought into existence
[1:43:17] the birth pains natural birth pains was
[1:43:20] part of the curse if it would have come
[1:43:22] the other way it wouldn't have been that
[1:43:25] way
[1:43:31] i'm helpless this morning
[1:43:35] so
[1:43:36] so we understand that
[1:43:39] that that this spirit now returns back
[1:43:42] on the bride
[1:43:46] you say well the baptism no
[1:43:49] this is above the baptism of the holy
[1:43:51] ghost
[1:43:54] this is above anointed ones at the end
[1:43:57] time
[1:43:58] this is above the rain falling on the
[1:44:01] just and the unjust
[1:44:03] this is eve
[1:44:07] the bride
[1:44:08] receiving the same
[1:44:11] life
[1:44:12] that was in christ
[1:44:19] you've got to take it above the baptism
[1:44:21] of the holy ghost
[1:44:22] what the world calls the baptism the
[1:44:25] holy ghost the restoration of gifts the
[1:44:28] emotional shouting the speaking in
[1:44:30] tongues
[1:44:34] this is something that's beyond that
[1:44:38] this is the restoration
[1:44:43] of the bride
[1:44:46] the restoration of the bride tree
[1:44:49] this is the restoration of the path of
[1:44:52] life
[1:44:54] that was in the beginning
[1:44:55] so when we get back to eden
[1:44:59] we will resume
[1:45:01] the plan that god had for us in the
[1:45:04] beginning
[1:45:05] we just dropped down here for a little
[1:45:09] time so god can reveal to us all his
[1:45:11] other attributes
[1:45:15] so that's right
[1:45:17] the same life
[1:45:22] that
[1:45:23] the second adam had
[1:45:27] the power to bring eve back to life
[1:45:31] is waved over the people again
[1:45:35] through revelations
[1:45:40] 17
[1:45:42] and 30.
[1:45:46] and so
[1:45:48] that's just a quick review
[1:45:51] and we realized that
[1:45:53] that life is what raised him up
[1:45:56] he is now a quickening spirit
[1:46:00] the rain's going to fall on the unjust
[1:46:02] in everything
[1:46:04] the spirit's going to go out and it's
[1:46:06] going to fall on people and they're
[1:46:08] going to rejoice but what are they they
[1:46:10] are anointed ones
[1:46:13] at the end time
[1:46:14] the anointing is right
[1:46:17] but they don't have the seed
[1:46:23] they don't have the bright inheritance
[1:46:26] gene of god
[1:46:29] and this ministry only brings to life
[1:46:33] the gene seed of god the bride
[1:46:40] now that bride is going to be brought to
[1:46:43] life
[1:46:45] that is the resurrection
[1:46:47] of the bride
[1:46:49] the quickening spirit this spirit that
[1:46:52] can take you out of the human being that
[1:46:55] you are
[1:46:57] he became you
[1:47:00] that you might become him
[1:47:03] we are still afraid
[1:47:06] to take our rightful position
[1:47:09] in the lord jesus
[1:47:13] today this morning myself included
[1:47:17] are still
[1:47:18] sitting here
[1:47:20] with a cloud of doubt and confusion
[1:47:24] that's keeping me
[1:47:26] from being a messiah
[1:47:33] to taking my rightful position that i am
[1:47:36] the son of god
[1:47:38] as he is
[1:47:40] so am i amen
[1:47:46] right now there's only one thing that
[1:47:49] can do that
[1:47:50] that's a spark
[1:47:54] it's a quickening power
[1:47:56] it's a power that comes
[1:47:59] and turns all the mechanics on
[1:48:06] okay this is where we're picking up
[1:48:09] so
[1:48:10] let we're just going to have a communion
[1:48:12] service tonight
[1:48:13] just communion and foot washing i would
[1:48:16] like your feedback on that if you if you
[1:48:18] like doing it that way
[1:48:20] trying it for a few times so you can sit
[1:48:23] there i like this instead of having a
[1:48:25] long song service 45 minutes to hour of
[1:48:28] preaching foot washing and everything
[1:48:31] that we come just for foot washing and
[1:48:33] then for those of you that want to have
[1:48:35] communion or foot washing that can't
[1:48:37] come to service we're going to try to
[1:48:39] work out a way that we can bring that to
[1:48:40] you
[1:48:44] okay so now we've just talked about how
[1:48:47] far we've got
[1:48:49] now the prophet of god is going to give
[1:48:50] us a warning
[1:48:53] this next 11 minutes
[1:48:55] is
[1:48:56] a
[1:48:59] a warning
[1:49:01] and an instruction
[1:49:04] of the trap
[1:49:07] that the church falls into
[1:49:11] okay
[1:49:12] and that trap is called mechanics
[1:49:16] so let's just listen to 11 minutes we'll
[1:49:18] close up with a little
[1:49:20] uh continuation of our study and so
[1:49:23] remember the reason that we're sitting
[1:49:25] here this morning is hearing this word
[1:49:27] is we want a clear
[1:49:30] revelation and leadership
[1:49:33] of god's word
[1:49:35] and then as soon as we close up a sister
[1:49:38] zoe he wants to be baptized this morning
[1:49:41] so we'll let her
[1:49:44] have her chance to
[1:49:46] join the fellowship all right lord
[1:49:48] richly bless you we're going to start in
[1:49:50] paragraph
[1:49:52] 103
[1:49:54] and that's where we closed last week
[1:49:56] that the only way this quickening power
[1:49:59] can come
[1:50:00] is through malachi 4 5
[1:50:02] luke 17.
[1:50:04] anybody that doesn't accept
[1:50:06] the
[1:50:07] spark from that ministry will never
[1:50:11] be quickened
[1:50:13] amen
[1:50:14] and don't start asking yourself oh what
[1:50:16] about people that never heard what about
[1:50:18] all this what about it
[1:50:20] you know what
[1:50:21] is it to you
[1:50:24] if he carries till i come
[1:50:27] follow without me
[1:50:30] amen lord bless you this next
[1:50:33] 11 minutes thank you brother mike god
[1:50:35] bless you
[1:50:37] no matter how much theologians claim
[1:50:40] how well you got your church set
[1:50:43] how much education you got how much like
[1:50:45] the bible until that wave sheath
[1:50:49] until that holy spirit comes upon that
[1:50:53] person to quicken that word
[1:50:57] the gasoline represents the word it's
[1:50:59] the truth but without the spirit it
[1:51:01] won't move
[1:51:05] we put too much
[1:51:07] stress on the mechanics and nothing on
[1:51:10] the dynamics
[1:51:12] we need the dominant power of god the
[1:51:16] resurrection power of jesus christ upon
[1:51:19] the church to manifest him
[1:51:22] and to bring to pass that this is
[1:51:24] gasoline
[1:51:28] it might be in a gasoline can it should
[1:51:31] still be water
[1:51:34] see
[1:51:36] but the only proof of it is put this
[1:51:39] life on it
[1:51:41] and it will prove worse gasps
[1:51:44] and when you try to put the holy spirit
[1:51:47] in the denomination you're as much as
[1:51:50] try you can get a splatter
[1:51:54] you'll
[1:51:55] ruin your engine by getting it full of
[1:51:57] carbon
[1:51:59] but all i'm so fast that there is a ten
[1:52:03] thousand power
[1:52:06] the word of god and a holy ghost tied it
[1:52:08] up
[1:52:09] and to resurrect the power of god into a
[1:52:13] man's life or a woman's life are into a
[1:52:15] church that shoved that cadillac down
[1:52:18] the road
[1:52:21] on the dynamic power
[1:52:24] of the holy ghost
[1:52:25] which came back to us waved over the
[1:52:27] people at the day of pentecost
[1:52:29] making him the same yesterday today and
[1:52:31] forever
[1:52:33] that was the first sheep come up from
[1:52:34] all the prophets which was the son of
[1:52:36] god the king of all prophets
[1:52:38] there's been churches churches brides
[1:52:40] brides churches rise brides but there's
[1:52:43] got to come one
[1:52:45] hallelujah
[1:52:47] that has to come a real bride
[1:52:50] there must come one that's not only got
[1:52:52] the mechanics but the dynamic shut
[1:52:55] [Music]
[1:52:56] up the church live
[1:53:02] in the power of his resurrection
[1:53:06] until we come to that place
[1:53:08] until we find that place
[1:53:11] what good does it do to polish the hubs
[1:53:14] what good does it do to give her a
[1:53:15] facelift or a simoniz job
[1:53:18] when there's no dynamics in it
[1:53:21] no matter how much the mechanics prove
[1:53:23] to be right
[1:53:24] there's got to be a dynamic to make it
[1:53:26] work
[1:53:28] that's what he proved
[1:53:31] hallelujah
[1:53:33] that's what easter proved
[1:53:36] he wasn't only the word but he was god
[1:53:39] himself the dynamics in the word
[1:53:44] pain
[1:53:45] the body of jesus christ
[1:53:47] whole stepping dead in the grave shaking
[1:53:50] the life and rise again and roll away
[1:53:54] i am he that was dead
[1:53:57] so dead till the sun said he was dead
[1:54:00] the moon said he was dead the star said
[1:54:02] he was dead all nature said he was dead
[1:54:05] now the whole world has to recognize
[1:54:07] that he's alive again
[1:54:09] he was not only the mechanics god's word
[1:54:12] he was a dynamic to prove it
[1:54:15] and is he being the group
[1:54:19] the bride has to come forth because this
[1:54:21] part of him
[1:54:22] and it can only be the manifestation of
[1:54:25] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:54:28] and the others that spoke of the bride
[1:54:30] it can only manifest if it's just
[1:54:32] something different from the groom it
[1:54:34] isn't the bride
[1:54:36] because she's flesh of his flesh bone of
[1:54:40] his bone
[1:54:41] life of his life power of his power
[1:54:45] she is him
[1:54:48] as man and woman are one and woman taken
[1:54:50] from his side she had taken his spirit
[1:54:53] defending his spirit coming the flesh
[1:54:55] from his side made both mechanics and
[1:54:57] dynamics the wife
[1:55:01] the spirit of him
[1:55:03] and the flesh of him
[1:55:04] had put it together and made mechanics
[1:55:07] and dynamics
[1:55:08] until the church or the people all these
[1:55:11] easter bunnies and ceremonies and big
[1:55:14] churches and pirates will fail and pass
[1:55:17] away until that church become both time
[1:55:21] and mechanics
[1:55:23] and the spirit of god that moved him to
[1:55:25] do the things that he did
[1:55:27] if he hit on 16 cylinders
[1:55:30] so
[1:55:32] hey
[1:55:34] why is that in john 14 12. he that was
[1:55:37] he before me the words that i do shall
[1:55:41] he you
[1:55:44] also give him a charge of my dynamics
[1:55:48] and his mechanics
[1:55:50] that's the world when i'll be able to
[1:55:51] withstand it
[1:55:53] and i'll raise him up again at the last
[1:55:55] day hallelujah
[1:55:56] all right
[1:55:58] that's the easter egg
[1:56:00] the time
[1:56:01] and the mechanics
[1:56:03] together
[1:56:04] the mechanics without the dynamics
[1:56:07] no good
[1:56:08] neither is the dynamics without the
[1:56:09] mechanics
[1:56:11] you can scream and shout and jump up
[1:56:12] down all you want to and deny this word
[1:56:14] amen amen they won't do any good
[1:56:17] you're just cranking around them the
[1:56:19] pistons have got sparked out of fire but
[1:56:21] no gas need to far back
[1:56:23] it'll only work as they come together
[1:56:27] amen
[1:56:29] so one will set steel and the other will
[1:56:30] go up
[1:56:32] that's the only thing there is to it yes
[1:56:33] they both might look like both claim to
[1:56:35] be churches no claim to be bribed but
[1:56:37] one has
[1:56:39] mechanics and
[1:56:41] it brings it to pass
[1:56:43] but what he said is the truth
[1:56:45] it just won't
[1:56:47] no matter how good the mechanics is
[1:56:49] until the dynamics comes
[1:56:51] a time and it comes that bar is made to
[1:56:54] connect with that octane in the gasoline
[1:56:57] and when that exposures it causes
[1:57:00] a combustion
[1:57:02] and that combustion moves
[1:57:06] every motion ever moves
[1:57:08] or he is the same
[1:57:10] yesterday
[1:57:11] today and forever
[1:57:13] that's the resurrection
[1:57:15] that's the real power of god
[1:57:17] but
[1:57:18] with the dynamics
[1:57:20] notice
[1:57:21] it's the spirits that quit it's the it's
[1:57:25] the spark that fires
[1:57:28] it's not the gas that fires it's a spark
[1:57:30] that fires the gas
[1:57:32] you can do nothing without me but with
[1:57:35] me you can do all things
[1:57:38] as he is the words the father living
[1:57:39] father sent me so send i you as the
[1:57:42] father has fired me and pushed me into
[1:57:44] everything i do only that which is
[1:57:46] pleasing to god
[1:57:47] now as he sent me so saying it was the
[1:57:50] same mechanics and it takes the same
[1:57:52] dynamics to operate it and these signs
[1:57:54] shall follow them that claim to have the
[1:57:56] mechanics
[1:57:58] the dynamics will take its place paul
[1:58:00] said the gospel came to us not in word
[1:58:02] only through gasoline only but through
[1:58:04] spark also to make it move
[1:58:08] it came to us in that manner
[1:58:10] it's the same spirit that raised him up
[1:58:13] that quickened the true believer to
[1:58:15] eternal life
[1:58:17] i remember potentially now watch as we
[1:58:20] are getting out of our time
[1:58:22] notice
[1:58:23] the same spirit now romans 8 1. let's
[1:58:25] just read that again in romans
[1:58:28] 8 1 and we'll see what that says
[1:58:32] all right and not romans i mean 8 11 i'm
[1:58:35] sorry and romans 8 11.
[1:58:38] but
[1:58:39] if there's a problem
[1:58:41] there's a sketch but if the spirit of
[1:58:44] him
[1:58:45] god the holy spirit that raised up jesus
[1:58:49] from the dead dwelt
[1:58:51] in you
[1:58:54] oh
[1:58:55] there you are
[1:58:58] if the bridegroom
[1:59:01] spirit dwells in the bride
[1:59:04] when god made his first bride grew
[1:59:07] he made the bridegroom first
[1:59:10] and he was both man and woman in spirit
[1:59:14] forming in the dust of the earth and
[1:59:15] making material
[1:59:17] and notice when he made e from adam he
[1:59:20] took
[1:59:21] not another piece of clay he took from
[1:59:24] the same piece of clay
[1:59:26] the same word
[1:59:28] or adam was a spoken word
[1:59:30] you see he took from him and then taken
[1:59:32] the he had masculine and feminist spirit
[1:59:36] and he took the feminist spirit away
[1:59:38] from adam
[1:59:39] and placed it in eaves who are still
[1:59:41] part of adam's fence
[1:59:44] is adam's flesh
[1:59:46] then it was adam's spirit the dynamic
[1:59:50] that quickened the mechanics of his body
[1:59:52] so the bride must also be
[1:59:55] flesh of his flesh
[1:59:57] and bone of his bones then how is this
[2:00:00] mortal flesh go become his flesh we'll
[2:00:02] get to it
[2:00:04] how is it done how what is this great
[2:00:07] transformation notice now if the spirit
[2:00:12] of him god
[2:00:14] that raised up jesus from the dead
[2:00:17] dwell in you
[2:00:18] he that raised up christ from the dead
[2:00:21] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[2:00:25] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[2:00:29] oh
[2:00:31] the predestinated ones
[2:00:33] of course like the seed laid up on the
[2:00:35] earth the one that had life and many of
[2:00:38] them are dead
[2:00:39] they were just rotten seeds
[2:00:41] but waters and things burn them out
[2:00:44] but you know there was a seed laying
[2:00:46] there
[2:00:46] ready for life god knowed it was laying
[2:00:48] there
[2:00:49] now
[2:00:50] the predestinated ones
[2:00:53] are the first to be quickened by the
[2:00:54] holy spirit for the holy spirit comes
[2:00:58] to claim its own
[2:01:01] how this is deep now
[2:01:03] be sure to catch this good
[2:01:06] now
[2:01:07] as the sun was sent across the earth
[2:01:10] not to bring rocks which was dirt also
[2:01:13] to lie
[2:01:14] it was not to bring all the dirt to the
[2:01:17] knife
[2:01:18] but was to bring the part of the dirt
[2:01:21] which
[2:01:22] was enclosed around the line
[2:01:26] not all men will receive christ
[2:01:28] oh no
[2:01:30] but those which god
[2:01:33] foreordained
[2:01:34] life
[2:01:36] is housed around some of the dirt of the
[2:01:38] earth
[2:01:40] that's when it comes to quicken they're
[2:01:42] the ones that now that dirt would lay
[2:01:43] there in the sun and say oh this old
[2:01:45] sun's so hot that rock said there's no
[2:01:47] sun so hot
[2:01:48] but that little seed said that's what
[2:01:50] i'm looking for
[2:01:51] and it began to spring forth the line
[2:01:53] it quickened that part of the dirt
[2:01:57] because the sun was sent
[2:02:01] not to quicken the rock
[2:02:03] not to quicken the dirt
[2:02:05] but to quicken the life
[2:02:08] of the seed
[2:02:11] now the holy spirit comes now
[2:02:13] of course it wasn't set why won't all
[2:02:15] the people receive it it wasn't said to
[2:02:19] god told me i don't believe i don't care
[2:02:20] what you say if you can raise up the
[2:02:22] dead or anything and heal the sick and
[2:02:23] prove it anyway i still don't believe
[2:02:24] that this turn on
[2:02:26] your unbelievers
[2:02:28] it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't
[2:02:30] sent to you
[2:02:31] it's said to those who will believe
[2:02:34] the message is to the believer
[2:02:36] to them that perish is foolishness
[2:02:39] but to them that are in christ and part
[2:02:41] of that seed is life
[2:02:49] now how many days do you think we could
[2:02:51] spend on that 11 minutes
[2:02:56] going in how you're part of the earth
[2:02:58] and the earth's in you and how you were
[2:02:59] quickened
[2:03:01] but
[2:03:02] and maybe we'll go back over that again
[2:03:04] but this just in closing this morning
[2:03:06] it's 12 o'clock
[2:03:07] we'll be out a shorter service tonight
[2:03:10] and anything
[2:03:12] and i i just spent eight hours in the
[2:03:15] airport
[2:03:16] uh yesterday because my flight was
[2:03:18] canceled
[2:03:19] and
[2:03:20] so
[2:03:21] i had plenty of time to
[2:03:24] study
[2:03:25] so i had prepared about a four and a
[2:03:27] half hour
[2:03:28] sermon
[2:03:30] but i just want to bring this point
[2:03:33] to you in closing so much more i want to
[2:03:36] go into but i'll just close this because
[2:03:39] i'm really excited about zoe getting
[2:03:42] baptized so
[2:03:44] those that have to go as soon as we get
[2:03:46] to that point you are dismissed uh you
[2:03:49] can go and those that would like to stay
[2:03:51] if you want to move closer or whatever
[2:03:53] be a glorious and
[2:03:56] so we'll do this great thing
[2:03:59] now
[2:04:05] he said now there's too much
[2:04:07] emphasis
[2:04:10] put on the mechanics
[2:04:14] now how does that
[2:04:16] apply to us
[2:04:19] we have put too much stress on the
[2:04:22] mechanics
[2:04:23] and nothing on the dynamics
[2:04:26] it needs a dynamic power of god
[2:04:29] the resurrection
[2:04:31] power of jesus christ upon the church
[2:04:36] to manifest and to bring to pass
[2:04:41] that this is
[2:04:43] the word
[2:04:45] so every time he says gasoline you you
[2:04:47] say word
[2:04:50] the word
[2:04:51] so
[2:04:52] everybody claims to have the
[2:04:55] word
[2:04:57] but there's only one thing that can
[2:04:59] prove that it's word it isn't the
[2:05:01] testimony
[2:05:03] that it's word
[2:05:05] i could have a bucket of
[2:05:08] water
[2:05:10] a bucket of diesel fuel
[2:05:12] and a bucket of gasoline
[2:05:16] how many knows what would happen if i
[2:05:18] lit a match and threw it on diesel fuel
[2:05:22] nothing
[2:05:26] because it's got to be put under
[2:05:27] pressure
[2:05:28] and turned into vapor and all the diesel
[2:05:32] mechanics no
[2:05:33] it takes a while it wouldn't flash it
[2:05:35] wouldn't blow up if i threw it on water
[2:05:38] it wouldn't fly but if you throw it on
[2:05:40] gasoline
[2:05:41] you're gonna know it's
[2:05:43] gasoline
[2:05:46] because it's gonna manifest the dynamics
[2:05:50] of gasoline
[2:05:53] so now you understand the dynamics
[2:05:56] what is the dynamics of something
[2:06:01] in other words what is what is the
[2:06:03] dynamics of
[2:06:05] of dynamite
[2:06:09] what is the dynamics of this what is the
[2:06:11] dynamics of that
[2:06:13] if the dynamics is
[2:06:15] what that produces is its dynamics it
[2:06:19] becomes the definition it's the result
[2:06:23] of what that it is
[2:06:26] so when you put the word
[2:06:30] or the dynamics on the word it'll
[2:06:34] prove its word
[2:06:36] by the dynamics that it produces
[2:06:41] give you an example stand up billy
[2:06:46] i'm a christian
[2:06:49] i've got the love of jesus
[2:06:51] in my heart
[2:06:53] i only read the red letters
[2:06:57] don't tell me about nothing it's just
[2:06:59] jesus
[2:07:02] jesus is so good
[2:07:05] jesus is so sweet
[2:07:07] i'm just you glory hallelujah
[2:07:11] praise god
[2:07:12] glory hallelujah now give me a little
[2:07:14] slap on the cheek
[2:07:17] i'm gonna rip you apart you dude
[2:07:27] now
[2:07:28] that's the dynamics of what that i
[2:07:30] really am
[2:07:36] but
[2:07:37] when you got the dynamics you don't have
[2:07:39] to go around saying you're a christian
[2:07:44] i just walked up to billy and billy
[2:07:46] slaps me
[2:07:47] oh
[2:07:49] oh
[2:07:51] oh i forgive you brother 70 times 70. oh
[2:07:55] i want you to know that jesus i know
[2:07:58] hallelujah
[2:08:05] dynamics
[2:08:12] that really proves it's the
[2:08:14] word
[2:08:17] now you can put music on me
[2:08:26] right
[2:08:27] that's music on me
[2:08:30] you can put an anointing on me
[2:08:33] glory to god hallelujah praise god
[2:08:37] right
[2:08:38] isn't that what he said i don't care how
[2:08:40] much you shout how much you jump
[2:08:42] you know
[2:08:43] it doesn't mean nothing
[2:08:47] so one of the first things we've got to
[2:08:49] understand
[2:08:51] is an understanding of what the
[2:08:53] mechanics is
[2:08:59] because he said we put too much emphasis
[2:09:01] on the mechanics
[2:09:03] do you think the baptists are putting
[2:09:05] emphasis on mechanics
[2:09:07] no
[2:09:13] they're not putting i think the
[2:09:14] catholics are putting emphasis on
[2:09:16] mechanics
[2:09:17] no
[2:09:20] so let's just take a quick look and then
[2:09:22] we'll close
[2:09:23] of what the mechanics are
[2:09:30] the revelation of the godhead
[2:09:34] is a mechanic
[2:09:37] it's the mechanics
[2:09:40] water baptism
[2:09:42] mechanics
[2:09:45] church order
[2:09:47] being here 30 minutes early
[2:09:50] praying for the service
[2:09:52] coming prepared
[2:09:54] not staying up until
[2:09:56] 12 o'clock
[2:09:57] playing
[2:09:58] a game because you've got service in the
[2:10:01] morning
[2:10:03] knowing you've got something to
[2:10:04] contribute
[2:10:06] reading your bibles trying to catch the
[2:10:08] mind of the spirit
[2:10:10] trying to fit into the anointing of the
[2:10:12] spirit that's why we don't want you when
[2:10:14] we the minute we call for the musicians
[2:10:17] that's when the spirit comes after the
[2:10:19] word the prophet of god taught that part
[2:10:21] of the mechanics getting up unsensitive
[2:10:24] to the spirit just walking out maybe
[2:10:26] walking by somebody that god's dealing
[2:10:28] with their heart
[2:10:30] mechanics
[2:10:33] dress code
[2:10:35] mechanics
[2:10:38] the the seals
[2:10:40] that's mechanics
[2:10:42] church ages
[2:10:44] mechanics
[2:10:45] divine healing
[2:10:47] mechanics all all that
[2:10:50] is is the mechanics
[2:10:53] of the word of god
[2:10:56] you understand the that it's the the
[2:10:59] reason it's the mechanics is because
[2:11:02] it's the truth
[2:11:05] you understand it's the true
[2:11:07] revelation of god's word
[2:11:11] the mechanics it's got to be the truth
[2:11:13] so the mechanics has got to be in place
[2:11:19] all of it
[2:11:22] so he uses a car
[2:11:24] as a
[2:11:25] kind of a
[2:11:27] type to draw a visual
[2:11:29] that if the wheels are off the car it's
[2:11:31] not going to roll
[2:11:33] if you can't get in the car
[2:11:36] it ain't going to roll
[2:11:37] i've got one of those cars
[2:11:39] or the church has got one of those cars
[2:11:42] that the door don't open
[2:11:46] you gotta have the key
[2:11:48] to open the door
[2:11:50] so the mechanics has to be there
[2:11:55] it's got to be both
[2:11:57] mechanics and dynamics
[2:12:01] so if it doesn't have a battery it's not
[2:12:03] going to go if it doesn't have this if
[2:12:05] it doesn't have that all of it's got to
[2:12:07] be there
[2:12:08] but he says we put too much emphasis on
[2:12:11] the mechanics we buff the hubs
[2:12:14] we give it a sam simon eyes job
[2:12:18] everything is about our doctrines right
[2:12:20] our our uh our teachings are right we
[2:12:24] have to that we have the true revelation
[2:12:27] of the teachings of god's word
[2:12:32] but that has to be right
[2:12:35] you can't you'll never have the dynamics
[2:12:38] with the trinity mind
[2:12:42] so both parts of it has to be there
[2:12:45] all the doctrines got to be right
[2:12:50] that's part of the mechanics
[2:12:52] you've got to have the
[2:12:55] uh so
[2:12:56] the the dynamics is a
[2:13:00] something that falls upon the mechanics
[2:13:05] so you've got to have the word
[2:13:10] you've got the word
[2:13:14] you know what the truth is
[2:13:18] if you've been a believer for a year
[2:13:22] that you've filled your tank
[2:13:24] with the tapes we've listened to
[2:13:28] do you filled your taint with the quotes
[2:13:31] and the fellowship
[2:13:33] and the scripture
[2:13:36] that that's all
[2:13:38] the mechanics
[2:13:41] filled with the word
[2:13:45] and we have that sitting there
[2:13:48] right in place
[2:13:51] we've got believers
[2:13:54] the sisters are wearing skirts they're
[2:13:56] not putting on high heels
[2:13:59] if
[2:14:00] you know if it starts pushing your body
[2:14:02] forward you know it's too too high it's
[2:14:04] it's not right
[2:14:06] i don't have a measuring tape you know
[2:14:08] what i mean of what a high heel is i
[2:14:11] think the leslie and you can look at
[2:14:12] some of the elder sisters in there and
[2:14:14] look at what kind of shoes they wear
[2:14:17] you know there's no one walking around
[2:14:19] in stilettos or or i don't i was going
[2:14:21] to say pumps but i don't really know
[2:14:23] what a pump is
[2:14:24] so uh
[2:14:26] but you know you don't see these high
[2:14:28] heels and if you're wearing them this
[2:14:29] morning we don't have we love you
[2:14:31] you know we just presume that
[2:14:33] you're doing what you know is best
[2:14:37] but that's what the word of god is
[2:14:39] you know it's the filter
[2:14:42] so that only
[2:14:45] pure gas
[2:14:46] gets in your tank
[2:14:48] pure word fills up your tank
[2:14:51] so you we've got the mechanics
[2:14:55] he said but we put too much emphasis
[2:14:58] on getting everybody's hair right
[2:15:00] everybody's dressed right church order
[2:15:03] right getting everybody to believe
[2:15:07] the right doctrine
[2:15:11] over and over again teach the right
[2:15:13] doctrine teach the right doctrine you've
[2:15:14] got to believe right you've got to have
[2:15:16] that
[2:15:17] right but dynamics is strong meat
[2:15:23] okay
[2:15:24] it takes your revelation
[2:15:27] and makes it manifest in the flesh
[2:15:31] or in other words it brings it into
[2:15:34] existence
[2:15:39] you say
[2:15:40] it's not what do you mean by bringing
[2:15:42] into existence in other words it brings
[2:15:45] it into a living
[2:15:48] reality now you're living
[2:15:52] the mechanics the mechanics has got to
[2:15:55] move
[2:15:57] it's got to do
[2:15:59] the works that he did
[2:16:01] now if you listen to this slow and if we
[2:16:03] went through it line by line
[2:16:06] but
[2:16:07] it is actually what your you finally
[2:16:10] work on the car
[2:16:12] you work on the church you work on
[2:16:14] yourselves you get yourself under the
[2:16:16] token you fill yourself with the word of
[2:16:19] god now that you're there something
[2:16:24] okay
[2:16:25] apart from the mechanics
[2:16:29] has got to come and ignite you
[2:16:37] to move into
[2:16:40] the
[2:16:41] predestinated work
[2:16:44] because you are foreordained unto good
[2:16:46] works that you should walk in now that
[2:16:49] you now perform the works
[2:16:53] that you were predestinated to perform
[2:16:59] that the works that i do
[2:17:03] shall you do also
[2:17:07] is that males over 30.
[2:17:14] is that old
[2:17:16] senile pastors
[2:17:22] or is it every man woman boy and girl
[2:17:25] whose name is written on the lamb's book
[2:17:28] of life
[2:17:30] there's got to be something
[2:17:34] outside of mechanics so the trap was
[2:17:37] is we put so much emphasis on the
[2:17:40] doctrine
[2:17:42] on malachi 4 5 this is god's prophet
[2:17:45] this is god's prophet how many know this
[2:17:47] is god prophet
[2:17:49] how many know it by divine revelation
[2:17:53] you don't need me to explain to you one
[2:17:57] more time
[2:18:00] that he's a prophet
[2:18:05] how is this church going to prove
[2:18:10] that they have christ in them
[2:18:15] how is it going to prove that they have
[2:18:17] word in them
[2:18:19] that they're full of gasoline
[2:18:22] that is not the mechanics only
[2:18:27] because it's got to be both
[2:18:32] you understand it's got to be both it's
[2:18:34] got to be the revealed
[2:18:37] the true revealed word of god
[2:18:39] what the bible really teaches
[2:18:42] right
[2:18:44] and that was what the teaching reign was
[2:18:49] and that could only come by a prophet
[2:18:53] it could only come by the opening of the
[2:18:55] seven seals
[2:18:57] there was no gasoline or no word
[2:19:01] in the church
[2:19:03] until the seals were opened
[2:19:07] and the word of god was now poured in to
[2:19:11] the tank
[2:19:13] of your heart
[2:19:17] now you've got the word
[2:19:20] you've got the church buffed up
[2:19:24] i think our deacons are the best
[2:19:26] mechanical polishers there are
[2:19:30] they keep all the hubcaps on
[2:19:33] they keep the wheels from falling off
[2:19:37] they keep it clean
[2:19:40] the mechanics is there there she sits a
[2:19:43] beautiful
[2:19:44] machine
[2:19:47] all in order all the bride marching
[2:19:50] in step to the word filled with the word
[2:19:53] of god
[2:19:57] and we need something amen
[2:20:00] we need to come to the time where we
[2:20:01] look back at her and says it doesn't do
[2:20:04] us one more bit of good to simonize it
[2:20:08] again
[2:20:08] to wax it again it's time we take this
[2:20:12] church on a trip
[2:20:17] that she comes out of the garage and
[2:20:20] starts finding and doing the works that
[2:20:23] she's predestinated
[2:20:25] to do
[2:20:29] so he's got to have the mechanics the
[2:20:31] mechanics is the true word
[2:20:34] the mechanics is the doctrines the
[2:20:36] teachings it it's it it's that part of
[2:20:40] you that oh you you know what i'm saying
[2:20:43] that it's it lives right
[2:20:48] right
[2:20:49] but see the dynamics makes you
[2:20:52] act different
[2:20:56] it makes you live different
[2:20:59] not in a mechanical way
[2:21:02] in other words it doesn't make you live
[2:21:04] right
[2:21:08] that's still mechanics
[2:21:10] believe right
[2:21:12] that's still mechanics
[2:21:14] have the right nature that still
[2:21:17] mechanics
[2:21:20] and that's what we put
[2:21:22] all the emphasis on
[2:21:26] let's be honest
[2:21:28] we preach about living right
[2:21:31] believing right
[2:21:34] believing malachi 4 believing the seals
[2:21:36] are open believing this the mysteries
[2:21:38] believing this believing that believing
[2:21:40] that
[2:21:41] and to have the right nature
[2:21:44] oh i'd rather have the right nature than
[2:21:46] the wrong doctrine
[2:21:50] that's what we put emphasis on
[2:21:53] and he's saying what we failed to put
[2:21:55] emphasis on
[2:21:57] is the dynamics
[2:21:59] is the power
[2:22:02] that's in the gasoline
[2:22:05] when it's ignited
[2:22:07] by the resurrection spirit
[2:22:13] and that isn't running around the church
[2:22:15] shouting and dancing and and everything
[2:22:18] because he just
[2:22:19] he just told us that i don't care how
[2:22:21] much you run around do you shout
[2:22:24] and
[2:22:25] and you dance
[2:22:28] he said if you don't have that life you
[2:22:30] can scream and shout and jump up and
[2:22:33] down all you want to and deny this word
[2:22:36] it
[2:22:37] won't do any good
[2:22:40] you're just cranking around the pistons
[2:22:45] the spark
[2:22:46] there to fire but no gasoline to fire it
[2:22:50] by
[2:22:51] you got to have both
[2:22:54] all right we put the emphasis
[2:22:56] on the mechanics
[2:22:58] we'll admit that
[2:23:00] she's buffed
[2:23:02] the hubcaps are polished it's been
[2:23:05] simonized over and over and over again
[2:23:10] so we understand so
[2:23:12] that that's the mechanics
[2:23:14] living right
[2:23:16] believing right dressing right having
[2:23:19] the right attitude i've got all that
[2:23:21] part of it
[2:23:22] now we need the dynamic power
[2:23:26] that's to put
[2:23:28] into actions the promises of god
[2:23:34] hebrews i mean
[2:23:37] ii peter
[2:23:39] 1 4.
[2:23:40] let me just find it real quick just to
[2:23:43] read it to you because it's
[2:23:45] it's so beautiful
[2:23:49] whereby are given unto us exceedingly
[2:23:53] great and precious promises
[2:23:55] here we are
[2:23:57] we've got a bible full of promises
[2:24:00] we believe it
[2:24:03] right
[2:24:04] those promises are in us
[2:24:07] we confess them
[2:24:10] we've got the gas
[2:24:14] you see what i'm saying
[2:24:17] we've got the gas
[2:24:19] by these exceedingly great and precious
[2:24:22] promises
[2:24:23] by these ye might be partakers
[2:24:27] of divine nature
[2:24:30] having escaped the corruption that is in
[2:24:32] the world through lust
[2:24:35] so now we've got these great and
[2:24:37] exceeding precious promises
[2:24:41] we've got everything the prophet of god
[2:24:44] said that we would be
[2:24:46] said that we could do
[2:24:52] but we substitute it with emotion
[2:24:59] we think when we shout and we dance and
[2:25:02] we run
[2:25:04] and we repent
[2:25:06] and we come to the altar a hundred times
[2:25:09] that is not the dynamics
[2:25:14] that's being talked about
[2:25:17] the dynamics is the
[2:25:19] the power
[2:25:22] that takes those promises
[2:25:24] that you have in your life it's an
[2:25:27] external spark
[2:25:30] it's something that doesn't come from
[2:25:32] within you it comes from without you
[2:25:35] it's a quickening
[2:25:38] power
[2:25:39] in other words that promise
[2:25:42] that you hold in your mechanics is
[2:25:45] brought to life
[2:25:48] then it takes the automobile
[2:25:51] that you are
[2:25:54] all buffed and polished
[2:25:57] right
[2:25:58] full of the word it sparks it and now it
[2:26:02] moves that automobile that believer into
[2:26:06] the fulfillment of that promise and
[2:26:09] bringing that promise into a fleshly
[2:26:13] existence
[2:26:18] it's out of the garage
[2:26:22] it's actually bringing now
[2:26:25] the very word of god
[2:26:27] to pass
[2:26:31] it causes her to step out and speak
[2:26:34] something
[2:26:36] that's the divine revelation of the word
[2:26:39] made flesh
[2:26:41] that's the dynamic
[2:26:43] it proves its word how does it prove its
[2:26:45] word because it brings the word of god
[2:26:49] to pass
[2:26:52] now we just heard that
[2:26:55] and we'll try to listen to it again
[2:26:59] the prophet of god said it takes
[2:27:02] the believer and turns him into the lion
[2:27:06] of the tribe of judah
[2:27:09] that
[2:27:10] power
[2:27:12] that quickening
[2:27:14] that makes you alive
[2:27:16] brings you into resurrection
[2:27:20] turns you into the bride of christ
[2:27:23] back together with him in an invisible
[2:27:26] union that the same works that i do
[2:27:29] you shall do also
[2:27:32] so now the church is beginning to turn a
[2:27:35] corner
[2:27:38] the car's
[2:27:39] polished
[2:27:41] it's full of gas
[2:27:43] it's now time for the church to take a
[2:27:45] trip
[2:27:47] not only
[2:27:48] up
[2:27:49] and out of here
[2:27:51] but it's time for her to start
[2:27:53] fulfilling
[2:27:55] the works
[2:27:56] that's been prophesied
[2:27:59] of her
[2:28:00] the dynamics
[2:28:02] is the power to bring the word
[2:28:06] to pass
[2:28:09] now we've got to understand that that
[2:28:12] power
[2:28:13] men call it the holy spirit
[2:28:16] but that falls on the just and unjust
[2:28:19] this spark
[2:28:21] this dynamic
[2:28:24] only falls on the elected bride lady
[2:28:30] because she's the one that now
[2:28:32] represents both
[2:28:34] mechanics and dynamics
[2:28:38] she is not a clunker
[2:28:41] driving down the road sputtering
[2:28:45] putting out all kinds of smoke
[2:28:50] she's a beautiful lady
[2:28:54] full of virtue
[2:28:56] full of the word of god
[2:28:59] imperfect union with her husband
[2:29:02] got all the mechanics in order
[2:29:05] now she's moving into a new
[2:29:08] part of her life
[2:29:10] the dynamic part of life
[2:29:18] we would spend forever
[2:29:21] trying to get every believer part of
[2:29:23] every individual's life
[2:29:26] into my perfect mechanical order
[2:29:31] there comes a time you got to start
[2:29:33] polishing your own car
[2:29:34] yeah amen you got to start buffing your
[2:29:37] own hubs you got to simonize it you got
[2:29:40] to vacuum it you've got to keep it clean
[2:29:42] and you've got to
[2:29:45] keep it full of gas
[2:29:48] and now we can sit there in this vehicle
[2:29:51] and lift our hands up and say lord
[2:29:53] quicken me
[2:29:55] what would you have me to do
[2:29:58] where would you have me to go
[2:30:00] what am i living for i want to drive for
[2:30:03] the rapture
[2:30:05] i want to pick up anybody along the way
[2:30:08] that i can and take them with me i want
[2:30:11] to show this world that you're the same
[2:30:13] yesterday today and forever that you
[2:30:15] still heal the sick that you still raise
[2:30:18] the dead you still cast out demons you
[2:30:20] still do all these works lord my car's
[2:30:23] ready
[2:30:24] i'm full of the word i've got the
[2:30:26] mechanics now lord i want you to spark
[2:30:29] me
[2:30:33] that the evidence
[2:30:36] of what the true church is
[2:30:38] is made flesh in me
[2:30:45] i drive by a house down the street and
[2:30:47] he's got a i think he's got a 56 a 57
[2:30:50] 55 56 and 57 chevy
[2:30:56] oh they're beautiful
[2:30:59] i'd like to go drive them
[2:31:04] i'd like to take it for a spin
[2:31:09] don't you want to take your mechanics
[2:31:12] don't you want to bring it into
[2:31:13] existence
[2:31:15] don't you want to take it out of the
[2:31:16] ground young ladies don't you want to at
[2:31:18] school take somebody that you know might
[2:31:20] listen and sit down and open your bible
[2:31:23] to them and explain what it means to be
[2:31:24] a real lady not to give away your virtue
[2:31:28] to wait for your husband
[2:31:33] how how how how that god could really
[2:31:35] some of you men at work guys at school
[2:31:40] you might as well let them know you're
[2:31:42] going to find out you're a believer here
[2:31:44] it's better they find out you're a
[2:31:46] believer here then wait till there and
[2:31:48] they find out you aren't
[2:31:53] i don't want to be ashamed of this
[2:31:54] gospel
[2:31:55] i don't want to be ashamed of the car i
[2:31:57] drive
[2:31:58] i don't want to be ashamed of the
[2:31:59] gasoline i have in my tank oh god
[2:32:02] quicken it
[2:32:04] the quickening power bring this bride to
[2:32:06] life
[2:32:08] hallelujah
[2:32:10] that's what we need to put the emphasis
[2:32:12] on the spirit that's going to bring us
[2:32:15] to life that the works that he does we
[2:32:18] do also
[2:32:21] amen she's finally back in the beautiful
[2:32:24] form of life god bless you this morning
[2:32:27] we're just starting down this beautiful
[2:32:29] road
[2:32:30] of the quickening power of the sheaf
[2:32:33] offering what was waved over it why it
[2:32:36] was waved over it how this bride will be
[2:32:38] revealed in the last day by the spark
[2:32:42] hitting the word that the prophet put in
[2:32:44] your tank
[2:32:46] and bringing you to life god bless you
[2:32:48] this morning let's stand
[2:32:59] how are we going to get into that spark
[2:33:02] i know let's say it this way i want that
[2:33:04] spark to get into me
[2:33:06] amen everything that i know
[2:33:09] everything i've been taught
[2:33:11] all the ways i've tried to apply the
[2:33:13] token
[2:33:15] lord now may it produce fruit
[2:33:19] that's what our hearts desire is
[2:33:21] brother jackson you're gonna help me
[2:33:23] baptize zoey i presume somebody will
[2:33:24] come back and help i guess sister laura
[2:33:27] you'll help her
[2:33:28] get ready and then you're welcome to
[2:33:30] come here take pictures from there
[2:33:32] and if you guys will all go get ready
[2:33:36] now
[2:33:38] and then those of you that
[2:33:40] have to go i understand some of you will
[2:33:42] have to go
[2:33:44] and and that's perfectly fine we'd love
[2:33:46] you to stay but if you have to go we'll
[2:33:48] just sing a song while we're standing
[2:33:51] and then you can make your way
[2:33:54] out
[2:33:55] but let's just bow our heads
[2:34:02] and i just wanted to ask you something
[2:34:04] in your heart this morning
[2:34:10] do you in your life
[2:34:12] [Music]
[2:34:15] feel that you can do more for the
[2:34:17] kingdom of god than you're doing
[2:34:23] do you
[2:34:24] in your
[2:34:26] heart
[2:34:28] [Music]
[2:34:30] realize that
[2:34:33] you're not testifying
[2:34:37] and sharing the lord jesus like you
[2:34:40] should
[2:34:46] you this morning in your heart feel that
[2:34:52] the word of god doesn't have full
[2:34:54] preeminence in your life
[2:35:01] may i ask it this way this morning to
[2:35:03] you this morning
[2:35:06] look at yourself and say you know what i
[2:35:08] i'm not really
[2:35:10] looking for the coming of the lord i'm
[2:35:12] not really living for the rapture
[2:35:15] it's just kind of a side thought
[2:35:18] [Music]
[2:35:20] don't feel bad that you feel that way
[2:35:22] this morning
[2:35:26] because there's more of us in here that
[2:35:28] are in that condition than we'll admit
[2:35:37] and we tried to speak this morning about
[2:35:40] a spark
[2:35:43] about a power
[2:35:44] [Music]
[2:35:46] that can come into your life
[2:35:49] and bring those desires to live right
[2:35:52] and do right
[2:35:55] put all that in order
[2:35:57] and then cause you
[2:36:00] to labor
[2:36:02] for the kingdom of god
[2:36:05] to go into all the world
[2:36:08] to share the gospel
[2:36:10] to lay your hands on the sick
[2:36:13] to cast out devils
[2:36:16] the works that i do shall you do also
[2:36:20] because i go unto my father i will not
[2:36:22] leave you comfortless but i will come
[2:36:25] again and spark you
[2:36:28] and set that word that's in your heart
[2:36:30] on fire
[2:36:32] that you bring those promises into
[2:36:35] existence
[2:36:37] in your life
[2:36:39] and you'd just like to lift your hands
[2:36:41] to him this morning and say lord spark
[2:36:43] me
[2:36:45] quicken me
[2:36:46] [Music]
[2:36:47] bring all that i believe in all that i
[2:36:50] am into life
[2:36:52] turn me into a little messiah this
[2:36:54] morning
[2:36:56] turn me into you
[2:36:58] [Music]
[2:36:59] you became me that i might become you
[2:37:03] that you'll be living through me i wanna
[2:37:05] i want your my life to change this
[2:37:08] morning
[2:37:09] [Music]
[2:37:12] i'm asking for that
[2:37:15] power
[2:37:17] that will resurrect me
[2:37:19] from a believer
[2:37:23] from mechanics
[2:37:25] to dynamics
[2:37:29] from mechanics into the proof
[2:37:32] that the word of god is alive in me
[2:37:36] because it's doing what the word said it
[2:37:38] would do
[2:37:39] that's what i desired this morning
[2:37:41] that's what my hands up for lord i want
[2:37:44] to be free from the bondage of the world
[2:37:46] i want to be free from just putting all

[2:46:17] amen
[2:46:20] you know we're all
[2:46:22] born in sin shaped in iniquity and
[2:46:26] come into the world speaking lies
[2:46:29] then the word of god comes our way and
[2:46:31] it quickens to life something in us
[2:46:34] and on the day of pentecost peter and
[2:46:37] them coming out of the upper room
[2:46:39] filled with the spirit of god
[2:46:42] and
[2:46:43] the people
[2:46:45] they they knew that they were
[2:46:49] from nazareth and and that their
[2:46:54] galileans in that their
[2:46:58] nature gave them away but they knew that
[2:47:00] they were with jesus
[2:47:03] and then the word of god began to be
[2:47:05] preached what jesus died for
[2:47:08] and that he said men and brethren
[2:47:11] this is what was promised in the bible
[2:47:14] that he'd pour his spirit out
[2:47:17] upon men and women and they would speak
[2:47:20] with other tongues they would prophesy
[2:47:23] they'd be fulfilled with the same power
[2:47:25] that he was filled with
[2:47:27] and
[2:47:29] with this stirring spirit in them
[2:47:32] their hearts were pricked
[2:47:35] and they said what must we do
[2:47:38] to receive this same spirit
[2:47:41] and peter said repent every one of you
[2:47:44] and be baptized
[2:47:46] and you shall receive
[2:47:48] the gift of the holy spirit
[2:47:50] here's where we pick up that story in
[2:47:53] acts
[2:47:55] uh
[2:47:56] the
[2:47:57] the second chapter
[2:47:59] and the 36th verse therefore let all the
[2:48:02] house of israel know it surely
[2:48:05] that god hath made the same jesus
[2:48:08] whom ye have crucified both lord and
[2:48:12] christ
[2:48:14] now when they heard this they were
[2:48:16] pricked in their heart and said unto
[2:48:18] peter and the rest of the apostles men
[2:48:20] and brethren what shall we do
[2:48:23] then peter said unto them repent and be
[2:48:26] baptized every one of you in the name of
[2:48:29] jesus christ
[2:48:30] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[2:48:33] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[2:48:37] for the promises unto you
[2:48:40] and to your children
[2:48:41] and to all them that are far off even as
[2:48:45] many as the lord our god shall call
[2:48:49] so the spirit of the lord moved upon
[2:48:54] zoe's heart to be baptized
[2:48:57] and now this promise awaits her too
[2:49:00] that her life might be quickened
[2:49:02] at her young age to manifest the word of
[2:49:06] god
[2:49:06] in her life
[2:49:08] so we're going to baptize her now
[2:49:11] it's
[2:49:11] nice to have her father here with us to
[2:49:14] help baptize her
[2:49:18] zoey upon your confession
[2:49:22] that
[2:49:23] the spirit of god moved upon you to be
[2:49:25] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[2:49:28] that you receive the promise of his holy
[2:49:31] spirit
[2:49:32] that you receive the same spirit that he
[2:49:34] had in him in you
[2:49:37] that you life will also be quickened
[2:49:40] into the resurrection of the dead into
[2:49:43] the rapture of the living saints to be
[2:49:46] with ever with the lord
[2:49:48] we have to do this according to the
[2:49:50] promise to go into all the world
[2:49:53] baptizing them in the name of father the
[2:49:56] son and the holy spirit
[2:49:58] and by divine revelation and by the
[2:50:01] teaching of the messenger of this age
[2:50:03] we baptize you in the name of the lord
[2:50:06] jesus christ
