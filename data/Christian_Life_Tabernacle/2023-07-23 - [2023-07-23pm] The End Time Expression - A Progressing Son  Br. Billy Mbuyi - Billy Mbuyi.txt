our reaction so when you come to church don't just come to park your body because if others can see it guess what he sees it as well and if others feel a certain way about it how does he feel that's

to do the song service the Lord laid dead on my heart it's like man anyway I'll start reading it out of this okay Psalm 8 4-6 it says what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visit him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and as crowned him with Glory and Honor what did you deserve to get this Crown of Glory and Honor thou mayest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands he made them and God gave you permission to dictate or have dominion over it thou has put all things under his feet now imagine that even if there's AI come on you got nothing Satan is that it you got nothing unbelief brother Brahm says will not stop the promises of God so we serve a living God and as we just heard in the song he had his foot on the land and the Sea

things in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen and God bless you want to welcome everyone back in the house of God let's open our Bibles will try not to be too long and Romans chapter 6. yeah let's start reading from verse 12. it says let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in in the lust of there in the last thereof neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin but yield yourself to God and those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness to God for sin shall not have dominion over you don't you believe that isn't that the promise to the believer whatever it is that we're fighting whatever it is that we seem to not be able to get over whatever it is sin cannot have dominion over you this is the word of God it says sin cannot have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace what then what shall what shall we well it says shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid it says know you not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servant you are to whom you your to whom you obey were for to whom hold on one second 16 know you not that to whom ye yield yourself servants to obey his servant you are to whom ye obey whether is sin to death or of obedience to righteousness but God but by God be thanked that you were the Servants of sin but you are you have obeyed from the heart that from of a Doctrine which was delivered to you being then made free from sin you become the servant of righteousness speak after the manner of man because of the infirmity of your flesh as for as you have yielded your member servant to uncleanliness and to iniquity to Unique to iniquity to iniquity even so now yield your member servant to righteousness to Holiness for when you were the servant of sin you were free from righteousness what fruit had you then in those things whereof you were you you you are now ashamed for the end of those things is death but but now being made free from sin and become servant of God you have your fruits of you have the fruits to Holiness and then Everlasting and then everlasting life it says for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our lord father we ask that you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus we pray and ask amen you may have your seats tonight there's just been a couple of things and that Brother David attached on this morning I had a thought in my mind but it completely just went different from what we heard this morning and and we will get there as we progress I want to speak about uh the the end time expression the end time expression we as we understand even as we was described this morning we we could certainly say that we live in the days of Expressions there's so many Expressions out there everybody is have a desire to express something the world is expressing a bunch of things and I want to say this the the the the it's gone so much that things that people used to be ashamed of they no longer ashamed of it they're not ashamed to say what they are whether it's something that changes today to tomorrow they don't really care and and they they just freely expressing themselves what they are and we we understand as the children of God that that's the work of the devil that's what was promised when you take God out of everything all you left off with is chaos people can't agree with anything they seem to today it's it's one thing tomorrow it's another and it seems like they want you to be okay with her expression of whatever they choose to be but your expression is offensive to them so how can it be a free Society where everybody can express themselves whatever they are but your expression is offensive to them so you find out that they are not ashamed to to express and to say what they are and all of those things and I believe as Christians we shouldn't be ashamed of Who We Are one who's been born out of sin and and God has come and this saved your life and they changed your life from what you were to what you are today there's nothing to be ashamed of because the the world is is built in a way where you know there's nothing there's no expectation of God doing something uh people they go about their things all they think of is evil continually as we heard it this morning all they think all of all they have to express is the darkness that surround us because that's the only thing that's left in the world and God is wanting us to be the expression that he promised for us to be in the end time so we have to understand that we are here for the purpose of expression and that is to express God so therefore as the world is not ashamed to express what they are as Believers we shouldn't be ashamed to express what God made us to be and I want to say this it's important important we also realize as Believers of this message that the end time expression is no different from the beginning expression when God came and he created the heavens and the Earth by his word as we know it when he came in he said letter b and he created all of those things and he came he came back and he said let us make men in our image in our likeness that expression is no different from you that are sitting here even as he came in the form of Jesus Christ to come and to die on the cross and to give up of his life so we could be saved and to pay for the sins that we had committed and all of those things that expression is not different from the expression that is sitting here today why because it's the same God fulfilling his word what makes it the same is is the same God who's continually bringing his word to come to pass the vessel may be different the person by which it does it may be different but it's the same God expressing himself so therefore we have to be happy and proud of the expression that God made us so we can know that we are here and the same God who promised for us to be here the same God who fulfill his word in the beginning is here to fulfill his word in the end time so we find out do people are here they're expressing themselves uh what what they like what they dislike the political parties and the sexual orientation and all those things what food they like and what they don't like what what they are and what they are not and we as Believers we have to understand as the prophet will tell us we are the only lights that's left to be made to be manifested in the end time the world is in total darkness as we know that and so we the Prophet will say that it's a time uh even uh but David touched it on it they said it's a time where you know like this no longer enough and I want to say this because when we say that it's got two sides because the prophet tells us that the the world is looking for the true manifestations of sons and that's the scriptures he talks about how nature is groaning for the true manifestation of sun and it says even ourselves the scripture will say we are groaning for the true manifestations of sons and daughters and the world is looking for genuine true Christians so we we as we are the expression we have to understand what kind of expressions are we to be what Venom talks about the story of his friend I believe his name was burnt who went to hand with him who had a whistle that he would uh whistle and call the little uh uh uh uh fund and he will come out and he wanted to shoot him and he said he will come he had no pity he had no remorse or any form of uh uh sadness towards doing things like that and then he said he will blow on and then he says the Fawn came and he said then the mother dear when he heard that she said she came and he looked at him he saw that he was ready to shoot him but he looked at him right in the face why because the mother dear heard the voice of a little one and he couldn't help it and he said that action by itself changed him why because he saw something that was real and I want to say this let's be real as Christians we we are not interested in anything that's fake we don't want to come to church even as our Pastor said this morning the devil will want us to come here and just fill the pews and come as one and more service and like the sincerity and come without expectation and come and just say well we went to church and we went and we came back he's wanting a church that that is a lukewarm Church he's wanting a church that's built after his character he doesn't want a church that's built with power and and and wonders from God a people that can come into the church with expectation I was reading somewhere where the Prophet is talking and they said oh we just gather here we don't know what God is going to do with us I thought I said that's how we need to come in the building of God and when we assemble ourselves together there has to be some expectation of the supernatural we there has to be some expectation that if a sinner walks in they can't go back the same way they came in there has to be because remember the prophet the same Prophet will tell us that we can only receive according to our own expectation so if we come we just like a desical well I'll just go and hear the preacher whatever Revelation they've got so they can tell me we will miss the mark we'll miss what God is trying to do with us God is here wanting us to be motivated to be sealed up and to be the people that come under the expectation is it today is this the day that I'm going to get my Deliverance this is today that that sister is going to be healed that brother over there will be saved is it today that my son will come back home what is it we come with the expectation when we pray when we sing we hold our needs before him and with the expectation that he will touch it oh like those on the pull of Bethesda they went with expectation oh oh they jump and they did all that they could but oh that was only enough for one more today we have the word and we have God the spirit of God moving in our meeting we can come with the expectation God touch me do something for my son do something for this one do something for that one so we we have such a great promise let's not miss it let's not just be like any other Church let's be a people that's on the expectation of the supernatural anytime we are told the Rapture can happen any moment we are told we don't know perhaps this is our last service so we have to live with the expectation that this could be it so we just can't come and and you know oh I don't know and and and our mind goes to whatever trouble we have going on and you know how am I going to pay this how am I going to get this how am I going to get this no when we come we have to have an understanding that I am in the presence of the almighty God if I have a need he knows about it if something I've been doing he knows about it before it even happened so I'm here I'm gonna put my needs to the side I'm going to worship him with everything that I have and I know he knows what I have need of he'll come and answer my name don't let that get in the way of God moving don't let get in don't let your needle whatever you have in your heart get in the way of God moving why because he knows your need and he will come to answer you in due time that's the kind of expectation so I want to say this as the elect the elect is here in the end time we as the elect the elect is a hungry for the reality of God oh I tell you they they you know there's not come the time where when we read the word and the expectation of the hour that our hearts just burns aflame to see the promises come to pass to see the things that God has promised for this time come to pass so we are not satisfied to just be a church member we are here not to follow in the Traditions or we you know we go to church we sing couple of songs the preacher comes and they preach no we are here as a group of people that have received the message of the hour and we are under the expectation that the message is working to transform Us in what God is wanting us to be you know the prophet is no one has ever come in the presence of God and go back the same so why do we think we go back the same why do we come with that expectation why do we come without sincerity why do we come we're just trying to just say oh we don't know what's going to happen we have to come under the expectation that God is here to fulfill his word our hearts should be a flame the anticipation that God's promise will come to pass we come with the expectation that God is going to move his word will be made True To Us whatever we have need of will be answered so the prophet will tell us that this is the time he he says it this way and I'm just trying to not take too long and and most of this I'm probably paraphrasing it then most of you know it so he will I said this is Satan zeed and as we know it and it says time where hell is on Earth you know just look at the temperature you know laughs I mean you have to look far everywhere you go it tells you that hell is on Earth but we know that there's a promise that heaven will also be on earth so to the believer your focus is not hell your focus is heaven and if your focus is heaven you need to look for the manifestation of Heaven wherever Heaven has to be made known so we have to come and know that I know God promised for heaven to be manifested I know he promised that heaven will be manifested the same as hell is being manifested I want to see the manifestation of Heaven in my life if by my eyes I see the manifestation of hell outside I need the manifestation of Heaven in my heart in and in my life why because heaven is not manifested in the air Heaven is manifested in you Heaven is manifested through your flesh Heaven Is the End Time expression for the Believers oh my the prophet will say in the greatest battle ever fought this is perhaps one of my just favorite quotes to just read and and he just reminds you and he puts you in position for you to know what's really happening around you he says Satan's Army brings diseases That's what Satan is he's the Destroyer Satan the whole Kingdom of Satan is sickness death sorrow frustration worries all on Satan and anybody experienced any of that that's Satan God is not the author of frustration he's not the auto of sickness he's not the author of all of that so if you find yourself with sickness with death with sorrow frustration worries all of that is on Satan and if you could put it up it's fine it says God is life in paragraph 341 God is life Faith joy peace over here he says now that's the two forces that's coming together right now they are battling they are battling right now in the building right now we I I think we we forget as well a Pastor said the awareness that there's a battle going on you know it is you you go you come the service will hear the word and all of a sudden you feel on the mountain top and you feel good and you go out and before the week is over my my the devil will pour it on you and you'll really realize that this is the battle I just thought I was winning this what's going on it's why it wants you God wants you to be aware that anytime you see that it's the devil battling against you but he also wants you to be aware that at the same time that the spirit of God is said to battle for you I'll be dismayed don't lose it all don't be all broken up because something didn't go the way you expected just know that God when the army of Satan is there battling you the army of God is there to do battle for you so here he says it says God is Faith joy peace over here now that's the two great spirit that's coming together right now they are battling they are battling here in the building right now they are battling day by day with you every Force Satan he says following you along that great big kindly priest Goliath trying to scare the liver out of you so you actually got it from the message China scared to live to live here he's right it's a gospel with a word of Truth around your loin so now I want you where is our fortification coming from it's coming from the word of Truth what is the word if the word is the word of truth then every Satan whatever Satan is presenting you is a Lie the word of Truth is there to tell you that's a lie that's a lie don't believe that don't fall for that don't follow after that is there what is it fortifying you're saying I'm the truth I'm telling you the truth I know what your end is I got everything under control whatever happens to you it's on me fortification to the Believers I'm not creating my own fortification I have the word of God to fortify me he says oh fortify amen with the gospel with the word of Truth around your loins Glory preacher he says he says preacher that's what it is the helmet of salvation The Shield of Faith the sword waving it or waving it in in your head Satan I'm coming to meet you you meet me with with will you meet me in the name of science you meet me in the name of culture you meet me with the name of organization you meet me in the name of this or the name of the author but I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel we have to learn to do battles don't don't let the enemy get you out of your element and you lose it all you got to be fortified you got to have the word of Truth you got to have the word of the Lord that you can go to battle with I'm coming after you give way even death itself can stand there but what I'm says the power of Satan the if you if you take it and compress it all together the best that it could do is death but it says faith looks at death and he sees the resurrection just take that I mean what what skin did the devil do apart from creating debt nothing else but God we have a God who came he went into hell death in the grave he actually took death and he took the sting out of death and the prophet is telling us now Death Becomes a doorway for the Believers he comes and says there is taken he took death and he took the sting out of death the ability for him to keep you in the grave and to keep you dead and everything God came and he took that away from you so the thing that he can do the worst that he can do is Bluff at you you have nothing to fear nothing but yet we are oh my it looks like I won't be able to get this one over no come to him who in the name of the Lord God of Israel come to him with the word of God in your mouth come to him with the where it says the truth the truth around your loin it says come to him with faith as your Shield the sword waving The Sword and then he says sword and waving it in your hands that we may have the word of God in our hands he says chop a hole right through it that's right whatever it is just take the word drop a hole why because Christ has done it for you Satan's Army brings diseases God's Army is commissioned to cast them out amen there you are every every time Satan throws anything unto you God's Army is cast them out God's Army is to cast him out cast them out it says that's the very technique that God used it says Satan uses Army of Destruction to disbelieve God's word and to set him up for a better Kingdom than Michael had God cast him out God's method how many believe God's method is our method so you don't have to wonder well God's method in fact is made for you so he had to create a pattern that we can go and use when God creates something is for his children it's for his heartstring it's for anybody who has a part of him in him so when he creates his method his children will use his method he says God method is cast out the devil gas down reasoning cast down Superstition cast down worry cast down diseases cast down sin amen you are above it I think a lot of friends needs to climb to a ladder a little bit you know we keep putting ourselves way down there you are above it right resurrected in Christ Jesus sitting in Heavenly places where with with with every devil under your feet or your foot it says if he starts to stick his head in there what just think about it so anytime the devil seems to just you just step on him that's where he belongs oh this is not going right just step on him let me say this outside of this position we are fighting out of position outside of what we are reading tonight you are fighting out a physician and you're never going to win the only place you have to take is what the word says is giving you is what the word is making you is what God is making you is what the scripture says to go with him where you go with the word because God is giving you the word so let me say this and I said I was not going to be long I guess preach so so and I want to say this because we we need to get off of this habit of being down and up and up and down and down and up and and all those things and I'm not even talking about necessarily sinful but I'm talking about you you you constantly being down because something is not going the way you think you should be the the prophet will tell us it says put the word in your mouth and he says you'll start to sing you'll start to Rejoice I I want us to get to where we can stop practicing what the prophet is telling us when when things are going wrong you start to sing a song and praising God and I want to say this we need to get in the spirit of the word we need to get in the spirit of the word because the Brother David read it this morning I believe in it most of what I'm saying here it just came from what we heard tonight and I and I just want he says there is two ways it says one was carnal carnal conception and the other was spiritual revelation I'm not sure if you heard it when we were reading when we went through the message he says the one is carnal uh conception of man the other is spiritual Revelation so what's the difference carnal conception is by knowledge it's by understanding it's by a man's ability to take the scriptures and put the scripture together and and try to figure out what it means and all those things and but the spiritual Revelation is God himself opening your eyes for you to see what it really is no don't ever forget that because conception it's easy to come to the same conclusion why because you've taken the scripture you've taken that scripture oh we can see that but but Revelation it's God who gives the revelation you you can look at your life I was thinking oh all about how uh he went to the hospital to pray for this child you know whose parents they called him and the nurse comes in and he looks at him and they are rejoicing after the child is prayed for nothing has changed nothing everything's so the same the same reading the same condition the same everything but yet they are rejoicing what was that that was spiritual Revelation they believed that the prophet had come and prayed they believe with all the heart that the child was healed regardless of the condition spiritual Revelation sees the results before anything can be moved [Music] carnal goes by how is it feel today you feel better oh praise God you feel bad well I guess we're gonna go have to go back to prayer again that's what we do what did Abraham what was counted to Abraham for righteousness Sarah how are you feeling today no different praise God we're gonna get a child praise God Sarah how are you today well same thing praise God we're going to get a child the condition was not what was manifesting the faith hallelujah it's the faith that kept moving and moving and moving and moving Faith was able to produce something even when there was nothing to be brought isn't that what the prophet said faith will bring things that are not in existence it will call from the kingdom of God it will bring it into manifestation it's not how you feel today how you feel tomorrow it's what the word said let's not walk by carnal conception let it be spiritual revelation that I know my life is in his hands but when it talks about it in India he talks about those animals that moved away from the buildings and they came in there was an earthquake that was to be and they yeah they are shifted away from all the buildings and everything and here are humans looking at animal going what's going on with these animals and then days later the earthquake happens and only then people realize what was really happening says if God can do that with animals how much more can you do with the sons and the daughters we need is faith in the word of God what we need is to know what an inheritance is what we need is to know what are we being brought into the word of God will produce the result every time we need to lift up the word in our lives for whatever is happening let the word be lifted up the scripture says in Galatians 5 and 6 then it says this I say then a walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so automatically you realize that carnal impersonation will only end with the Fulfillment of the desires of the flesh quickly the only way to avoid fulfilling the desires of the flesh is to walk by the spirit walk in the spirit then ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh and then he says in Galatians 5 and 25 it says if we live in the spirit let us there let us also walk in the spirit no I've always thought about this and you know and there's been times I remember you know you you you watched Sports and different things and um I I like to like especially you know when there's a big game usually they make this uh little eclipse of people how they prepare themselves and everything and I was watching one and you see how people will move away from the families and they will go into a camping to prepare whether to be a boxing or whatever they'll put themselves away and they will do all that they can what they what are they trying to do they're trying to get into the spirit of whatever is about to happen so that they are ready they can't live and and be subject to all other emotions and everything and then expect to go fight the next day they need to get them in condition for them to be ready for the big game I want to say this as Believers of this message but when I'm and I'll read it here but says the message of the end time is here to prepare the bride for the rapture yes so you can be out of the message of the hour feeding on whatever you need and then be ready for the Rapture those things can come together so as Believers the way we get into the spirit of God Is by feasting on the word of God it's by being inspired by the word of God it's by getting into the word of God because remember the spirit is the spirit of the word it's not a different spirit it's the spirit of the word that gets us ready for the word but whatever it says get into the get into the spirit first before it happens oh imagine if we can just all come to church already on fire for God already our hearts burning are not talking without necessarily screaming and all kind of thing but our hearts prepared and come under expectation and all that God is going to speak to me I'm here I know I don't care what that preacher prepare God is going to speak to me through that preacher my brother my sister this is the reality of the word of God amen we have taken and let our traditions cover over the very Supernatural of God which means we become satisfied we're just coming and clocking in and 12 o'clock or 12 30 we are already anxious to clock out we're already thinking about everything else that's supposed to happen what if God wanted us to stay here for another five hours it'll be a stunner I wonder how many people will just say I don't know what's going on here it's good I want to be under the expectation I don't care if we come for 30 minutes for one hour time is not of in essence it's what God is wanting to do the word of God is transcendent it's past all things it's the very creator of all things the word of God is the thing that makes things happen who knows if you were trying to get fired and God was over there fighting for you who knows if something bad was gonna happen for you and God is over there fighting for you and you are here just anxious oh I got to get out I gotta get out and God is trying to keep you away from all trouble foreign will say this he will say this in the patma's vision it says I it says I was in the spirit it wasn't it says I was in the spirit isn't that uh isn't that just beautiful my I love that he says you could just call those words the whole of Christian Life if you are going to live as a Christian we have to be in his spirit I'm not talking about emotions his spirit amen amen God your word is going on right now I want to be in the spirit when the word of God came they came with the intention of changing things it wasn't sent just so we can take it and add to our knowledge it was saying so it could actually bring births so he could change lives so he could take away the things of the world so it could change a person and make it or son and the daughter to God so when I received the word I have the same expectation that the word will do the same in my life paragraph 43 if you could put it out there I'm not sure if that's the yeah 43. he says if we are going to live we live as Christians we have to be in his Spirit John was not talking about being in his own Spirit it says that would that would not that would not have brought the these Visions he has he says he had to be in the spirit of God he had to be in the spirit of God he says it has to be the spirit of God with us too or all the efforts are in vain said I pray in the spirit I will sing in the spirit I will live in the spirit if there be anything good that will come to me as to be he says it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears so we we can't receive the word as some form of intellectual connections that we are building or exchange an intellectual exchange and forget to understand that there's a spirit that's here to make that word a reality every word when we read it from the Bible from the message there has to be an expectation there is a God behind this word who can take this word and change my life by my stripes you are healed there's a God who stands behind and let me say this every word of God every promise of God the prophet tells us God when he came to the Cross he says this is a finished work it's a finish work so when you receive the word you are receiving the final product you are receiving something that's been tested that went through all kinds of tests that went through all kinds of things so that when you take it it will produce the exact result that he promised you will do it's not a clinical trial it's not something with a bunch of side effects that you gotta wonder whether you should take it or not it's a finished product it means God himself as a proof of it God himself has been a goal to do it when he gives it to you he stands behind his own words he says now it says end as I assure assures John needed to be in the spirit to receive this tremendous Revelation it says fresh from from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the Revelation that God had given to us to live by in his word think about that the prophet will talk about people like George Washington they said he saw victory in his heart this is before any defeat has happened not enough guns no shoes not enough things to fight with and all the kinds of stuff yet somebody sees sin there and something within the hearts tell them you are an overcomer now God is not waiting for you to get to the other side for him to tell you I see I told you no he's here telling you through his word you are an overcomer you you keep looking at your defeat what about I'm defeated yeah I know but you are an overcomer don't look at your defeat look at the word be inspired by the word growing the word let the word lift you up so you can become the Overcomer that he said you are he says paragraph 44 says look at this way all too many read the Bible where it says in Acts 2 38 repent them be baptize every one of you in the name of the in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and knee shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it says listen to this and we just pass right on they don't see it if they saw it by getting it says if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit they would need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then and then God will be Duty bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the Holy Ghost now he's explaining I want the Holy Ghost no the word tells me if I repent and I'll be back I repent and I'll be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus it shifts from being my responsibility to God's responsibility now that's that's been in the spirit of it being outside of the spirit of it is a healthy I have it today I don't have it tomorrow but getting in the spirit of it is God I have repented I have been baptized now I'm here because you promised it's no longer my business but it's yours to fill me with the Holy Ghost and I say this this is for every promise in the Bible let's not come defeated let's not lift up our problems as if they were more than the word I think we shouldn't come to church and the one that the devil is attacking the most should be the one just jumping up and rejoicing the most praise God praise God imagine that it's God fulfilling his prophecy it's God bringing his word to capture price he says they never get in the spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says pray to God for Revelation by his Spirit he says that is the first step get in the spirit again he says did you ever ask for the holy he says I'll skip for the sacred time sorry he paragraph 44 and 3 says now if you ever notice how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to the ball games they're sporting events and the dances they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like Wallflowers like old dried up sticks they enter right into it into the field of things and become part of them of things but oh it says how they hate to create the Christians for getting into the spirit of God's word they call us Fanatics Holy Rollers there's not it says there's nothing they won't do they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing that they were coming for they were the way they were doing where it is coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship do you think they don't have troubles the people that paint the stomach and and all the faces and everything that they don't have any bills to pay or whatever I'm just asking they get lost they forget about all of that in fact they say it's okay if it comes right after but right now I gotta enjoy myself they get drunk they get told by the same problem still there but they do it anyway how much more we knowing that if we get in the spirit not only God is going to bless us but he also promised to take care of our needs all right he says the Christians ought to be as exuberant and full of pleasure in the Lord as the world is in the savior of the light of its pleasure both Christians and the world are human both have emotions they have he says the difference the difference is the Christians the heart hearts and emotions are purely on the Lord on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh as long as you don't do it for some fleshly emotions yeah but we could do it for God I want to say this God is expressing himself in the end time and it's important we we understand that even as we see here we are expressing something whether we we understand it or not whether we know what it is or what is not we are every day our lives are expressing something our lives are in fact the prophet will say that you know it says that our Our Lives speak louder than our words what we say is not necessarily because our lives they dare to be an expression what we do how we conduct ourselves is a form of an expression and we need to pay more attention to find out what is it that I'm expressing because I'm here to express him yeah and here's what the prophet said in the message the end time evangelism he says but the evening time but in the evening time that same great power of Christ would come upon the church like he did back there on the Eastern it says in the in the west it would be the same so that's why I want to speak on end time evangelism so this is a promise of the same light the same word the same God coming in the west to do the same things that he did in the East so that's why I said it's the same one he continues and says that's what it is it says getting the bride ready that's what it is it says now we are going to we are going to the end right here uh by by saying this the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepare for Rapture he says what can I do what can what can he do according to malachite 4 is bring them back to the faith of what was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the face faith of the father Pentecostal part in it says in the restoration time I will restore saith the Lord the end time evangelism so as relievers of the end time message we have to understand that the message is here to equip us the message is here he has the power inside of it to bring us back to the rapturing faith to give us what we have need of so it's not God said I'll send a message and then we'll find out what he will produce no the message in itself if you hear it if you listen to it if you eat it if you drink it it has within it the power to change and produce rapturing faith so there's no or I wonder what he will produce no rapturing faith the message has the power to produce a bride and I want to say this you can't to become the voice you need to hear and Believe The Voice right we cannot self-proclaim ourselves the voice of God in the end time if we didn't hear the voice that he sent if we didn't believe the voice that he sent because when he speaks to John when he says it's when you eat the book that you prophesy when you become one with a book that's when you prophesy so in order for me to for us to be the proper representation of the voice we need to hear the voice in Hidden life in Christ it says if you'll notice in the perfect type God did his own son the same way it says he taken three Witnesses in our pastor rated this morning where this is a different message he says they were on the uh there were it says where uh two or three witness every word be established Peter James and John love Faith and Hope he says it says he had taken them up on the mount that part uh from the rest of the world and there before before uh official Witnesses God adopted his own son he was transfigured before them and his Remnant did shine as the sun and the voice out of out of the cloud said this is my beloved Son uh he says hearing him he says he set him up on the mountain and put a witness there to see it clothe him in a robe as right as the sun shining um and the sun shining in this they they even Shine Like the Sun in its strength and God spoke out this is my beloved Son here he him God adopted his own his own child into the family here he him no longer no longer it says hear me no longer but this is my son whom who taketh over from here from here on amen he says that adoption is near the end time in parable of the church it's time for that Hallelujah when we read it we have to are we under the expectation of that they they is a word that when we read this morning that just strike me and I'll read the same paragraph We read this morning and that's the title I wanted to give my thought it says as a progressing son I thought I want to be a progressing son a progressing son the prophet say that but before I read that I want us I want us to really understand the the week we we desire to be the voice but we can only be The Voice by listening to The Voice we can only be The Voice by following The Voice Paul says be follow of me as I am of Christ so there's always this handing over from one to another it's never just coming out of the blue it's always God if God sent the message and he came and the prophet was a full expression of what God sent and we behold them we behold his life and notice that he was truly the expression of what God Said then in order for us to become the expression we have to believe the same word the same voice and I want to say this it's important we establish this God's desire was not so the prophet could preach and we recorded in tapes and we set it there and the expression remains on the tape no it was so that the people will come who will believe the word that the prophet said and the things that the prophet said will manifest into their lives what was it it's the expression of the hour God manifesting in his body Paul Peter said in First Peter 2 uh first Peter 2 and 5 it says ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual or built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ he's speaking about you he says but ye are not but ye are chosen a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that ye show forth the Praises of him that had called you out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light it says in that day you shall know the same way that I was in my father and my father in me and I in you and you and me how can you ever divide that how can you ever divide that we are his sons we are his daughters we are his servants we are his wife we are everything you can't touch it it's all God together manifesting himself whichever way he chooses so it's in hearing him we were the one in Spokane were the one we listened to it this morning so I'm going to read two portions of it so you can see paragraph 49 he says here God was standing here now he was doing exactly what he asked them to do now enough it says in the father's great heritage he says where he where he had he had many hired man working for him if he could find it he says now this is a little teaching here I hope I don't hurt I hurt I don't I hope I don't hurt but I just want to make a point get Faith started right so when you get started started we'll be on right we'll be on the right foot notice he says now when a baby son was born in the fam in in this family of this father he was born a son but yet he had no inheritance just as a son he says now it says there's where I think I think that the Full Gospel people let down a little bit on the our Doctrine see we take a person and say well now he's filled with the Holy Ghost and he speaks in with tongue that's it it says no that's not the only that's only it says that's just only begun it says you just begun you just been born into the family that's that's all that's the reason today that we our churches is not progressing the way we should be let me ask you today what is the Holy Ghost is supposed to be according to what the God is requiring for that age the requirement for the first age was justification and that's what was good for them the requirement for the second age was sanctification that was good for them so you can't just get sanctification or justification and think you've gotten there or you just can't be born and think you're an adult God is looking for maturity at the end time so therefore when we are to be born again in the end time the same spirit that births us is the same tutor that guides us to maturity so he can teach us so we can be placed son God is not going to place a baby that's just born today or therefore we see someone struggle we say they don't have the Holy Ghost it's just a baby the baby struggle that's okay let him give him a little bit milk give him a little more let him grow a little bit when he grows he'll be able to stand for for meat and now here's where I got this particular paragraph 67 he says now there you are he says what what a disgrace it says what a Pity that must there must be before the father when the tutor comes it comes up and the Holy Ghost and he brings that it says because he is he is our tutor we know that he says now this he says and the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible the Bible says so let me says man of all the move by the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible so the Bible is written by inspiration there's no private interpretation it's just the way it's wrote he says he says right there just take it believe it act on it God will bring it to pass it says it will never it says I've never seen him promise anything yet but what he done amen now that's maturity right there to see that regardless of the opposition the opposition seems great it seems scary remember it's like a roaring lion it will come and it will move everything that he can move but to stand there and say that I'm standing on God's word and God will do what he promised he will do that's maturity because if not mature you will run away you'll think your weapon is not good enough but God is telling you stand there believe it keep staying at it it says anything but he would do it he says he will always do it now Here Comes Here Comes it says here comes the tutor up now what if as it comes up before the father how that he how he feels he says he feels my comes up and say oh your son is progressing yeah your son is progressing I said God I want to be a progressing son I don't want to be just stuck here all the time every time the tutor comes it's the same thing every time it's the same thing no I want to be a progressing son what is progressing means I'm making ground I'm leaving I'm moving I'm I'm moving I'm doing something I'm in a movement something that is in move is dead is a progressing son he's just like a chip of all the of the old block as we call it down in the South it's just exactly like you he's just so interested in all in in all the sick and and The Afflicted he's so interested in Salvation of the people he says he says he's so interested in all of it he believes that every word you say you know what he's running the church just exactly like like like you would run it if you were there you if you were you were there he says you know the way that you your son runs he says when he was there when he when he was there yes that's the same way he's doing it he says you know it says you had to wrote it in there and it's the same yesterday today and forever well that's that's just exactly what he's doing he says oh my now how the father must say that's my son that's my child do we desire to progress do we desire to make ground you know the prophet talks about that fight that says he says if you can't bite him it says government you know if you can't move your hand move your toe move your finger what is that make progress cry out do whatever you can blow it up if you need to he will fix it don't just stay stagnant don't just get caught up in the today and tomorrow everything let God cause you to move move me oh God let me make progress he says in a message the word comes in flesh it says now you can express it by mental conception but if it comes if it becomes a reality a real revelation of God that you see it before it happen and Express in the word form that word takes hold and becomes material I want you to think of that oftentimes we try to express it with some mental you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you that you see that you see before it it happens and expressed in the word form that word takes a hold and becomes material what is the scripture says faith is the substance faith is the very evidence of things not seen when I have faith it's just as good as I have it if the musician could come and then it says Endo expressed oh my how God could if you if your heart and your mind is so and infilled with God's spirit until your thought becomes his thought it says amen there you are when your mind and your and when you're when your mind and your leading and you're guiding becomes a direct place a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being oh my what kind of people we should be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion you yes but the Holy Spirit as you so built up until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church we would be is a reality this is not some figment of imagination this is God manifesting his word what kind of people we would be this morning if if this Branham Tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why shouldn't we even use our own mind why we it says when we shouldn't even be used our own mind we didn't even use our own thoughts didn't even have no alternative to our own thought but just to be led by the spirit and let me say this this is the reality of what God is bringing us to and all of us together with one heart and one Accord we should say we want to see that we want to move we want to be moved by that we want to see that very expression made manifest in our midst we want to come to church I don't care what the sinner is I don't care what person comes in with the wheelchair I don't care what the disease is they have come in contact with the Living God something is going to happen it's going to start somewhere that Revival is going to be in somebody's heart it's got to be something that burns in your heart to see otherwise this won't expect that one to start that one expect this one to start I won't expect no it starts it in you God I'm going to church I want to see the supernatural your word when he comes forth we know it has the power of creation so I want when that word Goes Forth we want to see testimony comes forth we want to see the power of God change we want to see Miracles come we want to see it brings people to become Sons and Daughters to you why because that's the purpose of the end time message to gather a bride wherever she is that she could bring him to us that they will hear the message and become a son and a daughter to God to God let us stand [Music] I want to say let's not let our expectation down I don't care what the devil is poured upon you and don't don't come without expectation come expecting that God will speak to you and that same God will move and he will answer to your needs don't ever come and go back the same way you came come and when you hear the word of God believe that you will receive what you have need of and the same God who knows your heart who knows your need is going to move on the sin to produce it our gracious father we are so thankful Lord and yeah Lord perhaps we say this more than but I believe we don't say it enough is we need more of your Revelation Lord to understand that your word has everything now we have need of Lord and father to be so fortified by your word and where we could just read it and be strengthened to go and fight the enemy and know that the Victory Is Ours what we can be in condition where we don't need anything else we don't need somebody to play some instruments or whatever but when we hear it from your word oh God that we are so strengthened to go to battle for you to know that you've given us the victory be lifted up oh God and if there be any need represented father we pray that you may answer to it oh God we love you Lord and we commit what we are to you we are such things in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen let's just sing that as you invite our pastor amen oh I have your name your whole name [Music] [Music] and came the chance [Music] can grow let's stay

word that I promise that if you lay your hands on the sick they will recover if you lay hands that you would cast out tormentors that he would keep his word if you'd repent he'd be faithful and just to forgive it and throw it in the sea of God's forgetfulness As we sing that chorus again if you need the word ministered to you tonight the word will do what it promised it would do [Music] in my heart as I can just say I know that he's the same yesterday today and forever let's just sing that again if you need prayer this evening for anything we're here to pray for you because the Lane I believe that if we join our faith together you can have but your hearts desire just help me sing that again [Music] I don't want you to go in your presence [Music] aren't you you know all right
