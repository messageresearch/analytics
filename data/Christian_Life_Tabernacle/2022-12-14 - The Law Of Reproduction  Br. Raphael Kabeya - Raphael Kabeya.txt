you have need of even before you ask amen and he promised he would supply all our needs and so I will he's given us his word and he's chose the foolishness of preaching it's not foolishness to us but

it's marvelous what God can do amen amen so let's sing that little course only believe all things are possible as we invite our brother to come Minister and we ask you strength and brother Billy as

end time Universe they never want to miss that meeting that's why I bless them bless their souls bless their families activity bless all of the activities and have the glory and the honor ambience in blessing the pastor of our church in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen before you be seated a passage of scripture where the village is going to read in Genesis chapter 1 verse 24 to 27. foreign and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creatures after his kind cattles and cripping things and beasts of the Earth beast of the earth after the after his kind and it was so and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and the cattle after their kind and everything everything that creeped up on the up on the earth after his kind and God saw that it was good and God said let us make men in our image after our likeness and let let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowls of the air and over the cattle over over the cattle and and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth God so God created Man In His Image in His image of in the image of God created a him male and female created he them amen amen you may have your seats you can do business like you disappointment may the Lord bless the reading of his word I would like to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus foreign who is the pastor of this church to the opportunity for the opportunities given me once again to take its place and speak for uh to his congregation honestly speaking I'm very happy to be among you in this church just please see the frame David magary I appreciate Brother David McGarry there's a lot of things we share in common in the approach of the end time message is as much time as I spend here with with him and I see the the approach of the message I could say there's a lot of common things that we have in the world as auxiliaries of Malachi 4 Fidelity his Fidelity or his trust to the prophet places every individual uh in front of the message of the hour which is the word of God and Prophet God sent us a prophet and prophet salallah and the prophet is the word of God when the prophet is constantly being presented to you it's the the will of God that's being presented to you and we know that all that we have need of from the the new birth to the glory for us all of it is found in this message the testimonies that we hear many times in this place is it shows that God is in this place and I I invite you to come and support the work that that so to support the work with an honest heart because the testimony show that God is here is not a man who's working even though testimonies are not often what we are looking for we can have testimonies and not have God many signs and wonders doesn't mean you're walking with God and I believe preaching the word it's to bring the good news the Gospel of Jesus Christ resurrected and living among the people that have a need like we are the problem is people having situations and needs that need help that they want to see the presence of the Lord in that's why we preach the word so that people who have problems may find Solutions because we say all is possible to them that believe who believe what the word of God someone showed me because that that today the gospel has become a business where the personal interest is at heart first and I'm thinking I'm imagining that if Jesus was to preach the gospel that's preaches that's been preached in churches today um in order to receive acclamation and people like clapping handsome I believe you it will it would have never been crucified everybody would have wanted to be his friend you hear oftentimes did you like my message how did you hear the message it was really good in this evil age the message of the Lord Jesus Christ it was it was speaking to everybody without an exception to bring everyone to examine themselves I can give some examples but I don't really have a lot of time I can look in John chapter five it's it's it's evening service I'm gonna try to be fast in John chapter 5 verse 39 to 40. the Bible says it says search the scriptures because in them you think you have life but they are the ones who testify of me but you don't want to come to me he was talking to ministers the educated ones that were fully emerged in the scriptures they were happy with the knowledge that they were gathering and exposing it to people and speaking women but the very word that they were exposing to people was they in flesh and they wouldn't recognize it I have not gotten to my message when you go in all the the chapter Matthew 20 the 23rd chapter Jesus Jesus is Calling the the Pharisees and the scrub is calling them Hypocrites not just them the leaders but even those that were followers because if the the leader is blind he will even leave the ones that is leading uh in that in the in into fall message it was a message without compromise it was a message that was uh speaking to everybody without leaving anybody out the message the message of Paul and Peter to shiji's it was touching the hearts of people to have them change directions you can read in the book of Acts chapter 4 verse 12 at the same verse 7th for Acts chapter 5 verse 29. Galatians chapter verse chapter 1 verse 10. the Apostle Paul is speaking am I looking for favor with man oh God commission may change you see when I'm standing here come say if you tell the Jew as a servant of God I'm not looking to please man this is I'm seeking to please the one who called me to preach so that I can help those that are in need I'm not preaching to look at people and see how much they will appreciate the Apostle Paul is saying am I looking for favor with man or God am I trying to please man if I was still pleasing to men I will not be a servant to Christ that's the Apostle Paul and Peter and all the other Apostles it was a message that was directed to people so it could take down them out of Judaism and bring them into the word of the hour when we say that uh but Branham preached like Paul is a very type of Christ in this evil age I believe that with all my heart that William Branham is the true example of of Christ in this age is without compromise knowing that he was talking to a perverted generation like the one in the time of lot don't sit down in this age in this country and in all over the world lumos actually homosexuality is being proclaimed everywhere the lesbianism the changing and and choices of sex they teach to the kids the swazil pictures that they have the choice to make about what sex they want to be that they cannot say the boy or girl they have to make a choice the introduction of Satanism through kindergarten the kids that are being adopted by gay couples who finds themselves in complete confusions when his dad and mom come to find him at school foreign Spirits they hear in our churches how can we keep quiet or keep people in peace and tend to serve the god of William Branham when you hear William Branham you'll hear him say often times I don't have the intention to hurt you I'm not trying to to hurt your feelings I just want to be sincere as a servant of Christ it's going to say I'm gonna hurt you a little bit but what I desire in my heart is to just tell you the truth and I believe a servant of Christ the message of the end time corresponds and if we take it correctly the world will know that God sent a different message than what that which is being preaching to churches says in uh invent good and the unveiling of God paragraph 22. I will leave I will read it fully um now on my subject this morning I I put my confidence in God that he will reveal what he wants I've not I've not yet given the title of my sermon and every time when you take the tape and you listen to it I hope and I believe because that you that you have received a spiritual understanding of what god of what God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it out right out it's a thing sometimes we have to say things in such a way that he might thin down in our churches today we want to gather no do you know God is not there to just gather anything at this person Ally it might be in a way to bring some to go out some to leave certain a reflection some to ponder over you believe that the moment no matter if you may allow me now do you take the words of Barbara is in a message testimony um preach it's a July 7th 1953 paragraph 36. says we didn't come here for money we come here to help you and everywhere that we go man of God knows this we don't go for money we don't look for money because God blesses people one way or the other day but we come here to help you foreign I pray God to help me to bring somebody to look on themselves not just to be happy with the group it is just to help but there's one thing I kept my meetings pure para because of the love of God it's never we have to repeat the prophet okay it's never yeah I stopped let's like he stopped okay an organizator if if I meet an organizer who was trying to uh to to get to ask for money organization that was the last day for that organizer to be with me I didn't have this in my head supportive African casualties I want you to be patient with you Africans that I may say the first Africans who started coming to United States they were coming to ask for money Elizabeth and Americans had good faith to give them a lot of money or either to build churches and when they were going with that money is they were growing and doing businesses and they will eat all of that money and nobody will see that money is three decisions but to be having learned from those things I cannot travel without having the ability to support my travels I call my church even though everything works goes with money even so um it was the last day if God doesn't Supply the needs then it's time for me to go back you see that's exact there's nothing else I'm just here to help you and I believe by the grace of God that my little gift can help somebody tonight and I do all my best sister I ask you tonight that that for your support of faith and and your prayer as I'm serving the people I believe that William Branham Avenue he had the vision the same vision as power he used to put a delicious just to help people win the most of the the souls without asking for uh anything according to First Corinthians 9 and 9 and 7 7 to 19. and he knows that is the blessings of of the Lord that enriches and he doesn't follow it with any hurts that's how we try to walk in this world president to know that those that went before us they gave a wrong image of those that came from Africa and we want to walk with with balance I believe with all my heart because that the grace of God keeps the believer so they can remain with god without your personal efforts I believe in the eternal security of the church as long as you are in the church you are in you are under the security and you have to remain there remain in Christ Jesus God predestinated the church so she can appear before him without any read or anything the church will be without reproach without any read with no uh no wrinkles regardless of what happened God will have a church without a blemish or without any wrinkle me but I also believe you see all of those that gather into a tabernacle like the church here they are not in the church when we speak of the church it's not a gathering the church it's the body of Christ in all the categories of Believers in the church you see your trusted here there's three types of Believers and God knows what is feeding for each category this one now this category category and that same God speaks to all three categories [Music] and every single one of us we have to work our salvation with fear and trembling don't be airing oh God they're driven aside by all kinds of things that's why the gifts of God Work differently to a category and fast so it could put on the street three categories of Believers with in front of the the will of God which is the word of God I I don't want to speak of myself but in my in my work as I'm preaching I want to speak a little bit about me in my walk is I don't want to be an Armenian or a calvinist is I don't want to I belong to one group I want to be in communion with everybody because our Prophet is speaking with them with respect and and he was speaking about them that's what rejoices because I don't believe I'm the best preacher pedicated God has best preachers in all the groups this message is the entire word of God I believe it's the Full Gospel I believe I I I I believe with my and I'm just going forward interesting in his grace may God help us brothers and sisters that we may have respect for one another and to know that God is using us differently that we may remain each one in his own way of seeing things and remaining with our convictions a Christian has to have conviction and particularly a man of God it doesn't uh it doesn't hinder him from respecting the convictions that's not a word and the seed is not air with the shark bacovances paragraph 26. it says this is 30 years later later and I'm here still tonight proclaiming that message and around the world it went is and I'm glad to be back in my hometown where where I grew up to represent this Lord Jesus that I still love with all my heart each day he grows still sweeter than he was the day before listen closely I've never changed one iota in my Doctrine the first thing I started I still believe the same thing tonight it's the same yesterday today and forever he believed the same thing since he started and the Revelation grew and he never rejected what he began with so massage this message is divine foreign foreign poem is saying that he's he he's not he our brother who speaks at the pulpit he said so it's not I I think you understand because he says it's not he's not the one who speaks when he stands at the pulpit it says it's the light that was above his cradle when he was a baby this is in 1958. we have to doubt our doubt in the message of William Branham because this message is the finest God speaking in the message conference paragraph dues paragraph 12. the prophet says we find out that there's a lot of gathering as there were even more than before and I believe it's time for the people of God to be gathering even more I come and let us let us reason together God said you see Japanese I believe is the time for the church to gather together that that are little uh uh differences and all of it may be taken aside we are gathering to become one Jesus prayed that we may be one uh and this all shall know that you are my but in reality we don't pay attention to it okay simple in these people we shall know that you are my disciples when you have loved one for another is that in that we have to gather even more so that we may become one because we are not divided in reality we are not divided it's the devil who's dividing us in our thinking amen together you have to be like me no no something we are together Equity listen ERS the the appetite is not the same um we can all be hungry but they put food here this one has I'm hungry but I'm not I don't have really have an appetite foreign [Music] okay that's what happened in Christianity Christianity Christianity regardless of the differences in our organizations we are one no some um we are one because we are all children of God we are born by his Spirit Washed by his blood to clock you believe you are a son of God he believes is the Son of God and she believes she's a Son of God you you want to be believed that you are a son you also have to believe each one has its own experience that we are all tied to it was preached uh uh the the March 3rd March 13 1960. paragraph 40. do you know that God never made two men the same ground you that's why we'll find out that our God is a great God and to not believe God I can have been expected that there's no two people the same okay how a great God that we have there is not two of you in the whole world or it has never been members that's got the same thumbprint that's why today with science God was on plant with your fingerprint over the truth they can find it because you are unique cloud has made us each one unique oh don't try for me to be like you or you to be like imitation is of the devil God makes men different Ayla diverdo and he has diversity of gifts he lives and sends them to his church men are different gifts are different God sends them to his church listen to this carefully but we just cramped down on one and there you go dear what they don't different God sends different games oh I just like when that other one prayer you don't understand anything you understand that it's a prophet speaking [Music] we just cramped down on one and there you go you see you don't get the wisdom of the spirits that's the reason God can place us into the position where we should be in his body for to one is given this sort of get of a gift and no to another tell yourself to the doctor this sort of a gift I ain't no to another tell us another sword of gifts and see the sweetness and so forth but all the same body there is not one finger that can wash the whole face you see young ministers when they start preaching Pastor he has a his Idol passage they try to preach like him and and then movements like him we are different you cannot get there you must use the wisdom of the word the Bible's words of blueprint is I have Ministries in my church I tell each one to be uh free the Precision to make it big so they can find out that they can show that they found something I said it's going to bring you to to to their pride we don't want to build the doctrine on one one paragraph We believe all the whole world we don't break up the word God made us different do you know that is no particularity God receives us with our differences that's the prophet speaking we have to accept one another sentence God gave you the Holy Ghost with the Way You Are who obeyed him I believe you you're following me for particularly he gave you the Holy Ghost with the way you are you believe you have it he gave us the way he is but you are fighting yes there's something that's not right no now excuse me forgive me okay we have to come to to recognize one another as brothers and sisters we are all working together for a great purpose it means for his kingdom particularity and our differences God is not paying attention to that a little downtrend and those little things that means nothing is then let's stay away from um the objectives that are um help him selfish motives and and things I'm going to continue on the uh the seventh Church the uh the seven Church ages event s Christianity has become like a maze with divided faith in little pieces if you don't see like me no no yes there's something that's not right and if you if you reject one of these parts would it considering come analytic you are considered as a heretic what should we do La Salle shows necessary the only thing that's important is to return to Christ look to Christ as the only Chief and walk in the footprint or in his face to live all other ways until the day that we will all come to the same objectives having realized the unity of the faith the same way that our Master Built everything on the foundation of the scriptures the message is built on the foundation and we have to be founded on the scriptures then we have to abandon all of this little things that are are bringing out in our confessions and to be satisfied with the revealed word and this revealed word none of us will process possesses all of it himself no one can say he has all of it and he knows how to just preach it and see then I will come back excuse me for a moment and then we have to abandon all our little differences in our confessions and to be satisfied with the revealed word that belongs to us all so massage this message it's not your message it's not the message it's a message of God and it belongs to all of us Bible in the hands we have to be crying out I believe what God has revealed in this book I will obey to his commandment in the submissive Spirit on Supremacy I put my hope in his promises there is only one life and life and and death comes upon us in many different ways there is only one life it's a word in thousand different ways there is only one Christ but the millions of an antichrists do you know all Christians what is the only necessary thing or you come back to Christ who's the world or you go to a destruction like the Antichrist situations if you are wise if you want to live follow the master of life that's my brother my sister said it's a little introduction I believe it's useful to each one of usage my message I I told my wife I said what he preached he said I remember I preached something like that in in 2011. I started looking at my notes because we'll only bring death I will speak a little bit on the law of reproduction I don't know if I'll have time the time passing the time is gone I'm sorry I was asking me for my County ministers I need about 30 minutes I'll say this in finishings I didn't bring what I had in mind I tell you my brother my sister because each one of us is different particularly taking the difference we have different uh we have different we have differences or things that makes us different from one another particularly God accepted you with the way you are accepted the other the way he is mindfulness and walk hand in hand because we are all saved by grace let's bow ahead foreign father is I believe it's what you wanted me to say I didn't even touch my message may your name be lifted up for that because that these things that were said in a manner where it was scattered out that you may place it in each heart of your children that you may have that we may have the right position and that we may have a consideration for one another bless our pastors bless the one that works with him bless this church there may be firmed in the scriptures they are constantly reading the prophet bless this church and give to each one of us a good Christian spirit that will bring us to love one another prove it to prove that we are your disciples if there is a need there's a situation in somewhere in the hearts of someone extend your hand over them bless them Benny lay bless them don't forget Billy who's trying to make an effort then we got called recovered that we may strengthen him in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Applause] foreign I don't have my notes from last Sunday so God certainly makes us different you know but we have something that holds us together and that's an absolute kind Paul explained it like this he says if one be you know if all be the eye where would be the hearing or one would where would it all be but we're we're each members in particular fitted and joined together and and the the blood that runs through the body is the love of God and that love shed abroad in our hearts one for another and I I just feel that it's it's such a marvelous approach because when you think about it he called us different he called us from different places he called us from different walks of life so it lets us know how mindful he is of each of us and he tailored the gospel each one of us so we have a message but we each have a message and that's beautiful I love that I can go to this word and it speaks to me individually I love I can put on a tape and it talks to me individually I'm glad that I have a spirit that leads me in the walk that is set before me and it's not given to me to judge Another Man's Walk I thought of the scriptures when they asked the Lord you know what's going to be about him he said well what difference does it make if he tarries till I come you follow me amen it's a good attitude to have it's a good approach to have because you don't burden yourself down with all the false doctrines with all the false teachings with you don't have to carry that load you can love him you can walk with him you know who lives in your heart you know the book you read you know the voice that God sent you you stay true to that individually he'll play you like a great instrument and we'll all be playing the same song though we might be playing this different instruments but he's the great Orchestra and it'll all come together amen I think if we could keep that approach then we'll we'll never develop hatred or bitterness one to another because bitterness defiles the whole lump so let us know that God's been gifted his word and his son to each of us and let's great have that great respect let's stand
