[35:11] God bless you tonight let's open our
[35:14] Bibles to uh
[35:17] Saint John the 14th chapter
[35:20] and I will read some scripture there
[35:24] and we're going to just talk a little
[35:26] bit tonight on Fellowship on what was
[35:29] the Holy Ghost given for so what was the
[35:33] Holy Ghost given for I I think that I
[35:38] didn't think this morning was so hard
[35:40] that it ran that so many people off I
[35:43] thought it was a little soft myself but
[35:46] it's okay we know it's spring break and
[35:49] a lot of people are starting off on
[35:52] their vacation and we certainly wish
[35:54] them that they'd have a wonderful time
[35:56] and we hope that you have an opportunity
[35:59] to get away and spend time with your
[36:01] family and things and so we're grateful
[36:05] for that
[36:06] amen so we're going to start
[36:09] with the 12th
[36:13] this whole chapter is so fantastic you
[36:16] know
[36:17] I like it so much
[36:19] we this it kind of starts with Philip in
[36:24] them uh you know asking Jesus you know
[36:27] show us the father so let's start at the
[36:29] eighth verse and and read there and just
[36:32] enjoy the word of God and Philip said
[36:35] unto him Lord show us the father and
[36:39] it's suffice of us
[36:42] and you know this this really shows you
[36:45] how close you can be to something and
[36:48] not see it without revelation
[36:51] and Jesus said unto him have I been so
[36:54] long with you and yet hast thou not
[36:58] known me
[37:00] Philip
[37:02] he that hath seen me have seen the
[37:05] father
[37:07] and how sayest thou then show us the
[37:11] father isn't that great
[37:14] amen I bet you Philip had a revelation
[37:17] amen Philip have I been with you so long
[37:21] and you don't know who I am he who hath
[37:24] seen me have seen the father I'm the
[37:25] father made manifest in flesh Glory
[37:29] believeth doubt not that I am in the
[37:33] father and the father in me
[37:37] the words that I speak unto you I speak
[37:41] not of myself
[37:43] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[37:48] does the works amen that's important to
[37:51] us
[37:52] amen because this is the pattern of God
[37:56] and the law of God and and then we'll
[38:00] see that as we just read some of our
[38:02] Messengers but all that God was he
[38:05] poured into Christ right he says it's
[38:08] not me that this he that does the work
[38:11] believe me that I am in the father and
[38:15] the father in me
[38:18] or else believe me for the very work
[38:20] sake
[38:21] verily verily I stand to you he that
[38:25] believeth on me the works that I do
[38:29] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[38:33] these shall he do because I go unto my
[38:38] father
[38:39] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[38:44] that will I do that the father may be
[38:49] glorified in the son
[38:54] amen if ye shall ask me anything in my
[38:59] name I will do it if ye love me keep my
[39:03] Commandments
[39:05] and I will pray the father
[39:08] and he shall give you another comforter
[39:13] that ye may abide
[39:16] that he may abide with you forever
[39:21] how long
[39:22] forever ever that's got to be Eternal
[39:27] then right that's got to be eternal life
[39:31] even the spirit of Truth
[39:33] whom the world cannot receive
[39:37] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[39:41] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[39:46] you and shall be in you
[39:51] these are great promises amen
[39:54] I will not leave you comfortless
[39:59] I will come to you
[40:03] a little while
[40:05] and the world
[40:07] seeth me no more but ye see me because I
[40:12] live you shall live also
[40:15] and that day ye shall know that I am in
[40:20] my father
[40:22] and ye in me
[40:24] and I in you so in that day what we're
[40:29] going to know that this is what we're
[40:31] gonna know we're gonna know that he's in
[40:33] the father
[40:35] and and I'm in my father and you year in
[40:39] me and I am in you he that he that
[40:44] hath my Commandments and keep them
[40:48] he it is that loveth me and he that
[40:52] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[40:56] and I will love him and will manifest
[41:00] myself to him
[41:04] amen our gracious Heavenly Father we ask
[41:07] you to bless your word in Jesus name we
[41:10] pray amen
[41:12] may be seated
[41:20] what a what a great uh thing
[41:25] and then we could just drop down here
[41:27] and just read like the 24th 25th and
[41:30] sixth verse it says he that loveth me
[41:32] keepeth he that loveth me not keepeth
[41:36] not my sayings
[41:38] and the word which ye hear is not mine
[41:42] but the father with sent me these things
[41:46] I have I spoken unto you being yet
[41:49] present with you but the comforter which
[41:53] is the Holy Ghost when the father will
[41:56] send in my name he shall teach you all
[42:00] things and bring all things to your
[42:02] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[42:06] you peace I leave with you my peace I
[42:10] give unto you not as the world giveth I
[42:14] give unto you let not your hearts be
[42:16] troubled neither Let It Be Afraid we
[42:20] have heard how I said unto you that I go
[42:23] away
[42:24] and come again unto you if you love me
[42:28] you would Rejoice because I said I go to
[42:31] unto the father for my father is greater
[42:35] than I and I I just think this is just
[42:38] such a a beautiful uh relationship that
[42:43] the father had with the son and so we're
[42:47] just going to go and just take this
[42:49] little thought not be long this evening
[42:51] but just as we talked this morning and
[42:55] we wanted just to uh
[42:59] let us understand because what what
[43:01] we're what we're really looking for and
[43:04] what we've been talking about we're
[43:06] living in a very evil age it's the worst
[43:10] age that there's ever been never has the
[43:13] world moved this far away from God as
[43:17] they've moved now
[43:19] I mean it's un it's uncomprehendable we
[43:22] used to talk about
[43:24] about the Sodom condition and how there
[43:28] would be a Sodom condition but we never
[43:30] realized that that it would come to a
[43:34] place that they would even legalize
[43:38] the same gender marriages and if you
[43:43] want to look economically
[43:45] we we know the Bible told us that there
[43:48] would be such in this last day because
[43:52] it's a sign of of those that did not
[43:56] want to retain God in their knowledge
[43:59] the scripture says that if they do not
[44:01] want to retain God in their knowledge
[44:03] God will give them over to a reprobate
[44:06] mind doing those things which are
[44:09] unseemingly in other words not even
[44:12] natural you wouldn't even seem that they
[44:15] would think that way
[44:17] you know what I mean that there would
[44:19] even be attracted to such but because
[44:21] they didn't wish to retain God in their
[44:24] knowledge God let their mind become
[44:27] reprobate and then he gave them over to
[44:31] such things he said man with man woman
[44:33] with woman working that which is worth
[44:36] is unseemingly not even wishing to keep
[44:40] God in their knowledge and that's what
[44:42] we've come to
[44:44] they don't even want to retain God in
[44:46] their knowledge
[44:48] and then the scripture says it goes on
[44:50] farther in another place and tells us
[44:53] that they will come to the time that
[44:56] they think they're doing God of service
[44:58] by killing you
[45:01] now we wouldn't ever think that would be
[45:03] possible
[45:04] but we're seeing the world
[45:07] falling apart right around us we're
[45:11] seeing like we've never seen before the
[45:15] the world moving farther and farther and
[45:18] farther away from God and they don't
[45:22] even they don't even want to to to think
[45:26] like God that can eventually they took
[45:29] Bible reading out of the school they
[45:32] took praying out of the school they
[45:34] could they've done everything they
[45:36] they're trying to neutralize everything
[45:38] and they've got can you imagine coming
[45:41] to a place and our messenger told us
[45:44] that they won't even know whether
[45:46] they're a man or a woman
[45:49] what basic loss of sanity
[45:54] is that
[45:58] I mean they
[46:00] I mean I
[46:02] I can't even preach on it because I
[46:05] can't wrap my mind around it I can't
[46:07] even explain that Spirit but it leads me
[46:10] to understand
[46:12] why that we need his spirit
[46:16] why that we have to have his Spirit okay
[46:20] because we could not make it without him
[46:24] amen because there's he says I am the
[46:27] way the truth the life no man can come
[46:30] unto the father but by me
[46:33] so we understand that what was he we we
[46:38] talked about that this morning what what
[46:40] was the Holy Spirit it was the same
[46:42] spirit that was in Jesus Christ that
[46:46] allowed him to stand up against that
[46:49] religious age of that day who had taken
[46:52] every promise of God and absolutely
[46:55] turned it away from its real purpose and
[46:59] meaning
[47:00] in fact until he even came unto him and
[47:03] he said you say you have Moses if you
[47:06] would have known of Moses you had known
[47:08] me because I'm the one that Moses was
[47:12] speaking about here I am this is what
[47:15] all the laws and the prophets and
[47:17] everything's spoke of here I am the word
[47:20] that was prophesied every single thing
[47:23] about it standing right here amongst you
[47:26] Philip have I been with you so long and
[47:29] you don't know what I am I'm the
[47:31] Fulfillment of every biblical prophecy
[47:34] that was spoken
[47:37] it's all wrapped up
[47:39] right here in flesh
[47:43] and he knew
[47:45] that he he knew he knew uh the great uh
[47:50] god Jehovah was was in him and he looked
[47:55] out on us and he said father I pray for
[47:58] these they are that are in the world
[48:00] because they believed on me and I pray
[48:02] that you keep them from sin and unbelief
[48:06] because he knew we could not do it
[48:08] without him
[48:11] now there's a lot of things that men can
[48:14] do
[48:15] you know a man can believe
[48:18] we can believe on our own
[48:22] sure
[48:24] and we'll read a statement in just a
[48:26] while but you can believe in the Lord
[48:28] Jesus and not have the Holy Ghost
[48:33] so I mean we can believe on our own we
[48:36] can do a lot of good on our own there's
[48:41] a lot of people that do good and they do
[48:45] it for Humanity's sake
[48:49] you know that's why they do it they do
[48:52] it for Humanity say they do a lot of
[48:54] good for their own preservation and it's
[48:57] good I I don't I don't condemn any good
[49:01] I'm glad for the Salvation Army I'm glad
[49:04] for the Union Mission I'm glad for
[49:07] anybody that wants to do good
[49:10] amen good be God's good it's it's better
[49:13] I would rather have someone doing good
[49:16] than everybody robbing one another
[49:19] which seems to be coming pretty popular
[49:24] you know without regard
[49:27] you know it just man has lost control
[49:31] and the reason they've lost control they
[49:35] cannot stop the enemy because they have
[49:37] nothing to stop them with once you
[49:40] reject the word of God you've absolutely
[49:43] opened the doors for for the enemy to
[49:47] take free reign
[49:50] you can't stop them but there's one
[49:53] thing that stops Satan every time
[49:55] there's all we heard this morning
[49:57] nothing will defeat the enemy like the
[50:00] word of God like the word of God that's
[50:03] why you people don't understand the
[50:07] depth of what it meant when God sent a
[50:10] messenger in this age because man had
[50:13] lost the interpretation and the purpose
[50:16] of the scriptures
[50:18] they couldn't even find God in the
[50:21] scriptures anymore why because they
[50:23] mixed it with a polluted political mind
[50:28] they claim didn't look to the eyes of
[50:31] Eternity
[50:33] they looked everything at the present
[50:36] tense
[50:37] how does the word of God affect me this
[50:40] day and this minute
[50:42] to do what I want to do
[50:44] they never could give up they never
[50:47] could take their hands off of it and
[50:50] absolutely turn it over to God and his
[50:53] word and understand that God left us his
[50:57] plan
[50:58] and so a man can do a lot of good but he
[51:02] he cannot he can do a lot of good on his
[51:05] own
[51:06] but he can't make it on his own
[51:10] that's the one thing you can't do you
[51:13] can't enter there without him in other
[51:16] words he is the identifying credential
[51:21] to enter into the kingdom
[51:23] amen you know you have to go to these
[51:25] certain places you have a badge that
[51:27] always bothers me you know when I'm
[51:29] standing in line at the airport after
[51:31] you know for 20 minutes and some guy
[51:33] walks by one of them badges Jay you know
[51:36] what I mean he just goes
[51:38] and they let them in I go wait a minute
[51:41] I'm going to borrow one of them from my
[51:43] buddy next time and just go I don't even
[51:45] look at it
[51:50] you know sometimes things get so common
[51:52] they don't even check
[51:55] but but you're not going to make it
[51:57] there there's a credential
[51:59] right and that credential isn't good
[52:02] works
[52:03] because he said many will come to me in
[52:06] that day and say Lord Lord
[52:10] you know what I mean I did this and I
[52:13] did that and I did all these great
[52:15] things he said but I personally don't
[52:18] know you you're not packing you don't
[52:21] have within you the credential that
[52:25] shows that you're mine
[52:28] so we you we want to draw that clear
[52:31] conclusion and we heard that this
[52:33] morning there's a difference between a
[52:37] Christian and a born-again Christian
[52:44] and and
[52:46] so you can you can see the scriptures
[52:49] you can read the history you can know
[52:51] that there's a God because they found
[52:54] the Indians worshiping God
[52:56] totem poles and things that you can
[52:59] almost see the gospel in it and
[53:01] different things that they did that
[53:03] showed that they believed there was a
[53:05] God because God created in man something
[53:08] that wants to worship
[53:12] and man comes up with all kinds of
[53:14] different ideas
[53:16] so I there's
[53:19] and and man says well if you believe
[53:23] you're saved
[53:26] well you've got to believe to be saved
[53:31] but you can believe and not be saved I
[53:35] know that sounds terrible because we
[53:37] don't want to face the harsh reality of
[53:40] it but the harsh reality of of
[53:43] understanding the spirit of God is if
[53:46] you can understand you don't have it
[53:49] then you can get it
[53:51] but if you're deceived in thinking you
[53:54] have it when you don't you'll never look
[53:57] for it
[54:00] and that's the same principle that the
[54:03] prophet of God said he said when the son
[54:05] of man comes and does these things
[54:09] and you call it BL subabub there's no
[54:13] forgiveness for that in this life or the
[54:16] life ever to come because you've already
[54:19] denied the very Source the very Fountain
[54:22] of Salvation so if you think something's
[54:25] the devil you're never going to go back
[54:28] there and ask for it
[54:30] because you've already blotted it out
[54:33] you've sealed your fate
[54:36] and when the spirit of God came in this
[54:40] day to restore back to the church the
[54:44] true baptism of the Holy Spirit the true
[54:48] way to the kingdom
[54:50] look because there's wide was the way to
[54:54] destruction and many thereon but narrow
[54:58] was the gate and few be that found that
[55:00] and what did he do when he sent his
[55:03] messenger he sent his messenger so that
[55:06] he could make clear to his elected the
[55:10] way and who is the way he's the way and
[55:14] who is he he's the word
[55:18] there's not Jesus of yesterday and the
[55:21] word today they're the same person the
[55:26] same thing all the way from eternity it
[55:29] was in the beginning was the word and
[55:31] the Word was with God and the Word was
[55:33] God and the Word was what made flesh and
[55:37] dwelt them on us
[55:39] now we saw the prophesied word for our
[55:44] age made flesh
[55:48] right and if we saw it as the first
[55:52] fruit
[55:55] of the restoration of the seed down
[55:58] Through the Ages
[56:02] that's what happened
[56:04] we knew what the disciples had we knew
[56:06] what Paul had we knew what Peter had
[56:09] because this scripture tells us Silver
[56:11] and Gold Have I None
[56:13] you ought to go back and read that uh
[56:16] the message what is the what is the Holy
[56:18] Ghost brother Abraham dramatizes that so
[56:21] good he said Peter shows up there at the
[56:24] gate and he says they looked upon him
[56:26] and heck and and the guy says to him he
[56:29] says he says well I don't have any
[56:31] silver and gold but I've got something
[56:33] he says now Peter goes to talking about
[56:35] it he said 10 days ago
[56:41] Hallelujah he said 10 days ago I was in
[56:45] an upper room
[56:47] and we were waiting because he told us
[56:50] to wait until we receive power from on
[56:54] high because he knew we couldn't go out
[56:58] and preach this gospel on our own
[57:05] we couldn't do the works on our own he
[57:09] sent us out once before
[57:12] and we did it
[57:15] and when we came back we rejoiced over
[57:18] the wrong thing
[57:22] he said don't Rejoice because Satan you
[57:25] saw Satan falling like lightning
[57:28] that's not what we're interested in he
[57:31] says but rather Rejoice because your
[57:34] names were written in the Book of Life
[57:36] in other words rather Rejoice because
[57:39] you've been elected and chosen amen you
[57:42] have not chosen me I have chosen you
[57:46] how beautiful
[57:48] so he looked at him he says 10 days ago
[57:50] we were in the upper room and we had the
[57:52] spirit of God Came Upon Us the one we
[57:55] were following
[57:57] the one we believe to be the Messiah
[58:01] now we thought it was over
[58:03] because they killed them and then we
[58:06] heard that he had risen and and we were
[58:09] slow to believe that but then he
[58:12] appeared to us
[58:13] and we we saw him and he he talked to us
[58:17] and then we saw him being caught up into
[58:20] heaven
[58:22] and he said he told us to go wait and we
[58:25] would receive Kim because he would come
[58:28] again
[58:30] Eck he would be in US and he would be
[58:33] with us and we would know it and we were
[58:36] there and so now he's with me here and
[58:40] he's in me he says set your eyes fast on
[58:43] me and he said in the name of Jesus
[58:45] Christ rise up and walk
[58:48] oh my who did that
[58:52] it wasn't Peter that did that it was who
[58:56] was in Peter that did it
[58:58] and medical Church forgets sometimes
[59:01] it's not us that does the works it's him
[59:04] that does the work so how could it be
[59:07] God in Christ and not Christ in US
[59:11] it can't be
[59:13] Jesus didn't even take credit for doing
[59:16] the work
[59:17] he didn't even take credit for the words
[59:20] that he speaks the words that I speak
[59:22] tonight are not my words but they're the
[59:25] words of the messenger they're the words
[59:27] of our Lord Jesus Christ they're the
[59:29] words of the scripture I don't come up
[59:31] with this stuff
[59:34] why you wouldn't want to be following me
[59:36] we'd all be listening to Bob Dylan
[59:39] Sitting in some hippie junk house
[59:41] somewhere
[59:43] but he made the difference
[59:46] that's what it's about it ain't about us
[59:50] doing the work and us getting the power
[59:54] oh that is so warped what's out there
[59:58] right now
[1:00:00] it's not us
[1:00:01] it's him
[1:00:03] it's him in US
[1:00:06] it isn't about him giving us the power
[1:00:10] for us to do it
[1:00:12] it's about him dwelling in us so he can
[1:00:17] do it
[1:00:19] look just listen
[1:00:22] he's telling us
[1:00:24] he says
[1:00:27] now the purpose
[1:00:31] was if it's in the
[1:00:34] if you want to read along with me it's
[1:00:36] what was the Holy Ghost given for and
[1:00:39] this is paragraph
[1:00:41] 19. he says the purpose
[1:00:45] what was God's purpose in sending the
[1:00:50] Holy Ghost
[1:00:53] how many knows one of the principles
[1:00:56] that were taught by our messenger god
[1:00:59] never does anything without a purpose
[1:01:05] he never does anything without knowing
[1:01:07] the result
[1:01:09] he neither does anything that's not in
[1:01:11] the perfect time the perfect season or
[1:01:14] the perfect place
[1:01:17] so if he does something if he allows
[1:01:20] something in your life it's got a
[1:01:22] purpose
[1:01:24] if he let you fall it's for a reason
[1:01:28] and he doesn't let you fall for you to
[1:01:30] stay there
[1:01:31] he will come and pick you up
[1:01:36] because he's got a purpose
[1:01:38] and he made a promised word to you he
[1:01:41] would not leave you nor forsake you
[1:01:43] so we we understand this so we can just
[1:01:46] see it just plain as day that what was
[1:01:49] God
[1:01:50] what was God's purpose in sending the
[1:01:52] Holy Spirit
[1:01:53] I would Mark that down John 14 beginning
[1:01:57] at the 14th verse and read through the
[1:02:00] chapter for the basis
[1:02:03] God's purpose we find here in sending
[1:02:07] the Holy Spirit was one purpose that God
[1:02:14] himself
[1:02:17] might dwell in his church and continue
[1:02:22] his plan through the church that God was
[1:02:27] in Christ
[1:02:29] continuing his plan through Christ
[1:02:33] out of Christ into the church
[1:02:36] continuing his work through the Church
[1:02:42] God had one purpose
[1:02:44] it was the same purpose he had in Christ
[1:02:48] through Christ now he continues the
[1:02:52] purpose which was his Plan of Redemption
[1:02:55] how did he choose to redeem Fallen man
[1:02:58] back
[1:03:00] through Christ Jesus our lord
[1:03:03] that's what he did so he's continuing
[1:03:06] that's his same plan that that he did
[1:03:09] was to continue it to the church
[1:03:12] now we know what the holy spirit is we
[1:03:15] found out last night what it is it's God
[1:03:18] now when we think of God the father as
[1:03:22] Jesus spoke of here his father God the
[1:03:26] son as Jesus and God the Holy Spirit
[1:03:29] Holy Ghost as what we call it today now
[1:03:35] that does not mean there were three
[1:03:38] individuals distinct Gods it meant that
[1:03:41] there was one God in three offices
[1:03:47] may we say it like this all that God was
[1:03:51] he poured into Christ
[1:03:53] because he emptied himself and poured it
[1:03:56] into Christ and Christ was the fullness
[1:03:59] of the godhead bodily all that the power
[1:04:04] that God was was in Christ to create to
[1:04:08] do everything
[1:04:09] you say well what was Jesus's
[1:04:11] limitations Jesus's limitations was the
[1:04:15] will of the father
[1:04:21] that was his limitation
[1:04:23] I do nothing unless the father shows me
[1:04:28] how how much was he bound to that when
[1:04:32] he sat in the garden he says father let
[1:04:34] this cup pass from me but nevertheless
[1:04:38] thy will be done
[1:04:40] this is the purpose of the son to do the
[1:04:43] will of the father
[1:04:47] so that that's what he was
[1:04:51] that's it's it's for you Church
[1:04:57] you understand he thought it not robbery
[1:05:01] to be equal with God
[1:05:03] do you know what he wants us to come to
[1:05:05] where we don't feel it robbery to be
[1:05:08] like him
[1:05:16] I'm you know I'm just trying to get back
[1:05:18] into a positive mind I get so mad at the
[1:05:21] enemy and all his lies and his tricks
[1:05:24] that alls I want to do is blast them but
[1:05:27] forget him
[1:05:29] do you know what I mean he's a snail and
[1:05:33] there ain't no need wasting time on him
[1:05:35] because he's not going to change he's a
[1:05:37] deceiver he appears as an angel of Light
[1:05:42] you know what I mean you can't keep
[1:05:45] saying you know fake light fake like
[1:05:47] fake light
[1:05:49] you know what I mean
[1:05:51] if you know it's fake don't read it
[1:05:54] don't listen to it
[1:05:56] don't believe it
[1:05:58] but so what he just said he said
[1:06:02] all that he where was I see him May it's
[1:06:05] like this that God was he poured into
[1:06:08] Christ
[1:06:09] because he emptied himself and poured
[1:06:11] into Christ and Christ is the fullness
[1:06:13] of the godhead bodily all that Jehovah
[1:06:17] was he poured into Christ and all that
[1:06:20] Christ was he poured into the church not
[1:06:23] into one individual but into the entire
[1:06:26] body there's where we come together in
[1:06:31] unity
[1:06:32] we have power and that God was in Christ
[1:06:38] and all that Christ was is in you
[1:06:47] now you would have never come to that
[1:06:50] the church without a messenger
[1:06:53] you wouldn't ever have done to that
[1:06:56] until actually God put that on display
[1:06:59] through the ministry of the son of man
[1:07:02] that he actually came down and became
[1:07:06] one with that Prophet until actually you
[1:07:10] saw the very same Ministry of Jesus
[1:07:14] Christ except for the Corporal body
[1:07:18] you saw God veiled in man
[1:07:22] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:07:24] the heart doing only what the father
[1:07:27] showed him to do and saying only what
[1:07:29] the father told them to say
[1:07:31] and we saw that manifested
[1:07:36] now people get mixed up because they all
[1:07:38] want to run and do the prophetic work I
[1:07:40] don't want to do the prophetic work the
[1:07:42] prophetic work wants to be that's done
[1:07:44] that's been put on display but I want
[1:07:47] that life in me for what he has me to do
[1:07:54] he's not calling me to stand in front of
[1:07:56] thousands and manifest the son of man if
[1:08:00] they wouldn't have believed it in
[1:08:01] brother branham's day they're not going
[1:08:03] to believe it from a person like me
[1:08:09] you know what I mean so we need to give
[1:08:11] up on some of these fairy tale
[1:08:14] Christianity deals every time like every
[1:08:17] now I run across this land I found
[1:08:19] somebody who thinks he's a prophet
[1:08:21] somebody who thinks he's the messenger
[1:08:23] to Israel someone who thinks he's either
[1:08:26] Moses or Elijah all these you want to
[1:08:28] know something let God take care of that
[1:08:33] you know what I mean let God take care
[1:08:35] of what is
[1:08:36] what is it to you
[1:08:39] if he carries till I come follow without
[1:08:42] me
[1:08:44] so we just we'll just read this just
[1:08:46] because I just I like this it just gives
[1:08:49] such a beautiful understanding
[1:08:51] he says
[1:08:54] all that is was Christ in you for God
[1:08:57] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:09:00] First Timothy 3 16 if you're putting it
[1:09:03] down without controversy great is the
[1:09:06] mystery of godliness for God was
[1:09:09] manifested in the flesh we handled him
[1:09:12] god Jehovah made flesh and walked on
[1:09:14] Earth and we saw him with our eyes and
[1:09:19] then he comes down here to say he says
[1:09:21] now here it is
[1:09:24] the father was God over you
[1:09:34] we're saying we've been since Adam God
[1:09:38] the father was over Moses and the
[1:09:41] children of Israel in the pillar of Fire
[1:09:44] then God With Us in Christ
[1:09:48] he walked with us he talked with us he
[1:09:52] ate with us he slept with us
[1:09:55] right he created a body
[1:09:58] without sin because he couldn't dwell in
[1:10:01] that so he created a body that he could
[1:10:04] dwell in
[1:10:07] because there was a law that God had to
[1:10:10] follow
[1:10:11] well just and he says he says yes and
[1:10:15] now God was come into Christ and Christ
[1:10:18] had come into the church what is it God
[1:10:21] working in you
[1:10:23] anywhere in the world if he wanted to
[1:10:28] call on you you're right there
[1:10:32] working in you
[1:10:35] he said you're right there working in
[1:10:39] you to do his good will
[1:10:42] so what is it he's got the church all
[1:10:44] over the world
[1:10:47] how we ought to be thankful for that God
[1:10:51] the holy spirit is sent for the purpose
[1:10:54] of giving of purpose of God living in
[1:11:00] his church moving through each age
[1:11:03] working out
[1:11:06] his Divine will
[1:11:10] he goes on to say here
[1:11:13] and
[1:11:14] we we understand it that we talk about
[1:11:17] the Plan of Redemption see it had to be
[1:11:20] according to God's law
[1:11:22] God already set the law he showed it
[1:11:25] forth in Boaz the kinsman redeemer
[1:11:28] that's how you redeem something by the
[1:11:31] law if you lost a piece of property
[1:11:33] someone that was akin to that property
[1:11:36] would have to go up and make a
[1:11:39] propisionary either buy it back or make
[1:11:42] a claim so that family didn't lose their
[1:11:46] inheritance
[1:11:48] so that's what happened when someone
[1:11:49] didn't have a relative instead of that
[1:11:52] whole property going out of that whole
[1:11:54] family any member of that family that
[1:11:57] was the next one in line which could go
[1:12:00] there and stand before the Elders of the
[1:12:03] church and if there was a dead ode on
[1:12:05] that they could make the payment for
[1:12:07] that debt take that property back and
[1:12:10] keep it in the family Hallelujah
[1:12:13] what were we where is children we're the
[1:12:17] family of God so we had to have a
[1:12:19] Kinsman someone who was what we were a
[1:12:24] part of the family which was on the
[1:12:26] Lamb's Book of Life his book of life his
[1:12:29] book of kinmanship
[1:12:31] and he had to come and pay the price to
[1:12:36] buy us back that we wouldn't lose our
[1:12:39] internal inheritance
[1:12:42] oh makes you feel good
[1:12:46] don't it
[1:12:47] I was lost
[1:12:49] I didn't even know I had property
[1:12:57] you know we have a lot of those scams
[1:12:59] nowadays don't we
[1:13:01] I'm such an suction I've got this big
[1:13:04] property send me 10 grand and
[1:13:06] I'll go redeem the property and uh and
[1:13:11] then I'll share part of the wealth with
[1:13:12] you
[1:13:13] why I thought well if if they're going
[1:13:16] to offer 10 and get it back tell me
[1:13:18] where it's at I'll go offer 20 and keep
[1:13:20] it all
[1:13:22] it's a scam
[1:13:27] because Satan's the biggest scammer
[1:13:29] there is
[1:13:31] nobody can get that property back no
[1:13:34] church can get that property back no
[1:13:37] religion can get that property back
[1:13:39] nobody could redeem it for you but
[1:13:41] Christ Jesus himself
[1:13:44] no church confessional
[1:13:47] no priest
[1:13:49] No sacrifice that nothing
[1:13:52] all of the blood of sheeps and goats did
[1:13:56] was cover up the sin
[1:14:00] but it still remained
[1:14:02] but we had one that took it and threw it
[1:14:05] and then the Sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:14:08] to be remembered no more and while you
[1:14:11] were yet a sinner he threw it to the Sea
[1:14:13] of God forgetfulness and in order from
[1:14:16] to make the cross of none effect what
[1:14:19] Satan's going to do he had to come and
[1:14:21] reveal to you what he did so you could
[1:14:24] receive what he did and make what his
[1:14:27] did what he did come to a reality
[1:14:32] oh that ought to make you feel good it
[1:14:34] makes me feel good in other words he
[1:14:36] can't lie
[1:14:38] he can't fail
[1:14:39] all the father hath given me will come
[1:14:44] and so we just see how what what what
[1:14:46] beautiful
[1:14:48] uh what the beautiful Plan of Redemption
[1:14:51] was that it had to be a Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:14:54] and so we read here in 31 that's the
[1:14:58] purpose of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:00] it's the father again
[1:15:04] God the Father dwelling in you working
[1:15:08] out his plan his plans to finish his
[1:15:13] Plan of Redemption working through you
[1:15:16] making
[1:15:19] you a co-worker with him giving you a
[1:15:24] place giving you a part for your lost
[1:15:29] Fallen brother and sister giving you his
[1:15:32] spirit and his love to go hunt the lost
[1:15:37] as he did in the Garden of Eden
[1:15:43] to Play Your Part
[1:15:46] in the Plan of Redemption
[1:15:50] let's just look at the Plan of
[1:15:52] Redemption real quick
[1:15:54] if I could give you an overview and I
[1:15:57] know many of you could do it a lot
[1:15:58] better than me some of you can actually
[1:16:00] put dates and times and and different
[1:16:04] dispensations and everything on it he
[1:16:08] says but it says look he says look at
[1:16:11] the Plan of Redemption Adam's race had
[1:16:13] fallen right
[1:16:14] so they were just drifting every man did
[1:16:18] what he thought was right in his own eye
[1:16:21] it was kind of an eye for an eye and a
[1:16:23] tooth for a tooth
[1:16:25] you know what I mean you steal from me
[1:16:27] I'll steal from you were even
[1:16:31] you kill one of mine I'll kill one of
[1:16:33] yours
[1:16:35] what a way to live huh
[1:16:38] total fear
[1:16:39] but God had a plan to restore back his
[1:16:43] family
[1:16:44] to go get his chosen people
[1:16:48] who he knew were part of him because in
[1:16:52] order to be redeemed you had to be
[1:16:54] someplace
[1:16:56] right so you couldn't be redeemed if you
[1:17:01] weren't
[1:17:02] lost so he knew he had a family and you
[1:17:06] were part of it so he put a plan right
[1:17:09] so what did he do he came down to
[1:17:11] Abraham
[1:17:13] that's how he started his Plan of
[1:17:16] Redemption was to show up to Abraham who
[1:17:19] was 80 years old and say I'm going to
[1:17:21] give you a son
[1:17:23] what a type the son he was talking about
[1:17:27] wasn't Isaac
[1:17:30] it was another son that was going to
[1:17:33] redeem us all that's the son he was
[1:17:36] talking about but he always comes in
[1:17:39] flesh
[1:17:41] God always comes in flesh even when he
[1:17:45] showed up to Abraham who was melchized
[1:17:48] at it was God in flesh eating and
[1:17:52] drinking a perfect type of what was
[1:17:55] going to come so he instituted The Plan
[1:17:58] of Redemption through Abraham right and
[1:18:01] through Abraham he called out a people
[1:18:05] didn't he
[1:18:07] we talked about spring he gave him a
[1:18:09] sign
[1:18:10] this is going to be the sign of all your
[1:18:14] seed
[1:18:16] every part of your seed will circumcise
[1:18:20] will circumcise will circumcise
[1:18:23] so everybody that's up from Abraham's
[1:18:26] seed will bear the mark of circumcision
[1:18:28] in their flesh showing that they come
[1:18:32] from the tribe or from the people that
[1:18:37] God spoke to and promised a land to
[1:18:41] they were marked
[1:18:44] were marked
[1:18:46] right we talked about that this morning
[1:18:48] so what did he do they got in bondage
[1:18:51] right so what did he do he came down in
[1:18:55] Egypt remember we read in Acts 7 today
[1:18:57] and he he brought them out uh of the of
[1:19:02] of the land of Egypt by the prophet
[1:19:05] Moses which was a perfect type of Christ
[1:19:09] what was he doing he was revealing his
[1:19:13] Plan of Redemption in Shadows and types
[1:19:19] we could look at the shadows and types
[1:19:22] and if we looked he said if you would
[1:19:24] have believed Moses
[1:19:26] and you would have studied Moses and you
[1:19:29] would have looked at the scriptures the
[1:19:31] right way instead of trying to use the
[1:19:34] scriptures to bind the people with pots
[1:19:37] and pans and with services and all these
[1:19:40] laws you would have seen me
[1:19:45] you would have recognize I'm the Lamb of
[1:19:47] God that taketh away the sins of the
[1:19:50] world that's what John said when he saw
[1:19:52] him Behold the Lamb of God that taketh
[1:19:55] away the sins of the world
[1:20:00] who was this man
[1:20:03] no none ever spoke like him it was the
[1:20:06] Plan of Redemption coming down so he
[1:20:09] brought him out of Egypt and he gave
[1:20:11] them a land what's the what's the Israel
[1:20:14] what's the land the promised land a type
[1:20:17] of
[1:20:18] it's a type of where we're going
[1:20:20] it was a type of Eden in Shadows and
[1:20:24] types The Plan of Redemption
[1:20:28] The Book of Revelations is the
[1:20:31] revelation of Jesus Christ is the Plan
[1:20:33] of Redemption
[1:20:35] so it comes down he says then he spoke
[1:20:37] to it through Prophets
[1:20:40] right Sunday times in diverse manners he
[1:20:43] spoke to the church by the prophets
[1:20:45] and then finally he sent his own son
[1:20:52] Hallelujah
[1:20:54] paid the price now he spoke to us
[1:20:57] through his son
[1:21:01] didn't speak to them no more he spoke
[1:21:04] through us through his son will you say
[1:21:07] well brother Branham is a prophet
[1:21:08] brother Bram spoke the word
[1:21:12] he spoke what was in the scriptures he
[1:21:14] spoke when Jesus spoke
[1:21:17] he just spoke it in Truth and separated
[1:21:20] all the garbage out of it
[1:21:23] so you got it straight
[1:21:25] but ever since Jesus here he's always
[1:21:28] been speaking to the church and you say
[1:21:31] well he speaks to the Holy Spirit well
[1:21:33] who is the holy spirit it's the spirit
[1:21:37] of Jesus Christ dwelling in you
[1:21:41] it's the same spirit so we see the thing
[1:21:44] and then we understand right that that
[1:21:46] that seed went into the ground
[1:21:49] why did the seed have to go into the
[1:21:52] ground because he went into the ground
[1:21:55] he's following the law
[1:21:58] he's following the types
[1:22:01] where was the Gospel written It Was
[1:22:04] Written In The Clouds the sap going out
[1:22:07] of the tree coming up death burial
[1:22:09] Resurrection the sun death burial and
[1:22:12] Resurrection he's speaking out to
[1:22:14] everybody death burial and Resurrection
[1:22:16] Paul finally get so excited he says oh
[1:22:19] death where's your sting oh grave
[1:22:20] where's your victory
[1:22:22] I have fought a good race I fight when
[1:22:24] I'm going up to get the crown that
[1:22:26] awaits me
[1:22:29] we're not afraid of death
[1:22:33] oh Glorious Day
[1:22:40] I even the Jesus even told them
[1:22:43] if you love me you would rejoice
[1:22:46] because I'm going to the father
[1:22:50] we just love this whole world too much
[1:22:53] but I tell you when this bodies gets a
[1:22:55] few years on it you're just not as much
[1:22:57] in love with it
[1:22:58] as you are and when you know there's a
[1:23:01] new one waiting you start saying in your
[1:23:03] heart even so come quickly Lord Jesus
[1:23:07] talk is the Plan of Redemption so we
[1:23:10] come down the seed went into the ground
[1:23:12] right justification sanctification
[1:23:14] baptism of the holy spirit so what's he
[1:23:17] doing is the purpose of them is is to
[1:23:21] finish his Plan of Redemption working
[1:23:23] through you
[1:23:25] and hunting those lost as he did in the
[1:23:28] Garden of Eden Adam Adam Where Art Thou
[1:23:32] that's what the Holy Spirit does to a
[1:23:34] man or a woman
[1:23:36] when it strikes into their heart and
[1:23:40] takes its Abode there a thirst and a
[1:23:44] hunger for lost souls
[1:23:49] the church is built on converts it's not
[1:23:54] built on a prostolating from one Church
[1:23:57] to another
[1:24:00] it isn't getting a school bus
[1:24:03] or a church bus and driving to every
[1:24:06] neighborhood and Gathering up everybody
[1:24:13] I don't care who brings them to the Lord
[1:24:16] someone says well what happened if they
[1:24:18] if they come to the Lord if they come to
[1:24:20] the Lord Jesus
[1:24:22] they're coming to this message
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:28] they may have to go through this and
[1:24:30] through that
[1:24:31] they'll never be satisfied because
[1:24:33] there's never going to hear anything
[1:24:36] that bears witness with the born-again
[1:24:39] experience in their heart until they
[1:24:43] hear the true word of God and then it
[1:24:45] Bears Witness
[1:24:47] what is the new birth
[1:24:50] if the revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:24:53] personally
[1:24:58] that's what it is
[1:25:00] that person will go on
[1:25:03] and find the Holy Spirit
[1:25:08] and the Holy Spirit will lead them and
[1:25:11] guide them into all truth and
[1:25:13] righteousness
[1:25:16] never stop somebody from coming to the
[1:25:19] Lord someplace else because they don't
[1:25:22] believe your Doctrine
[1:25:24] you let him come to the Lord
[1:25:27] you let him get in his palm
[1:25:32] and if they're his sheep they'll know
[1:25:34] his voice
[1:25:35] and a stranger they will not follow
[1:25:39] it'll have to be
[1:25:42] according to the law of God
[1:25:45] and that's the law of God that put in
[1:25:48] there
[1:25:49] you come to the Lord Jesus you know him
[1:25:52] personally in your heart you will follow
[1:25:54] him and let's just finish reading it
[1:25:59] he says come that's what's the matter
[1:26:02] with the meetings today there's not
[1:26:05] enough Spirit touch in it
[1:26:08] go on going for The Souls of the Lost
[1:26:11] and the dying it's more to make a name
[1:26:15] or a church or a building or a
[1:26:18] denomination instead of Soul winning
[1:26:21] program how pitiful
[1:26:24] how we could stay on that too much
[1:26:28] how pitiful
[1:26:31] and that's why I said I don't care
[1:26:35] there's just a few here tonight we're
[1:26:37] not building that for believers
[1:26:41] we're building it for converts
[1:26:45] that's what we want to fill it up with
[1:26:48] we want to go to the highways and the
[1:26:51] byways in the hedges
[1:26:53] we want to get the those that are in
[1:26:56] Chains and those that are in bondage and
[1:26:59] those that are possessed and those are
[1:27:01] the ones we want to reach out to whether
[1:27:03] it's religious mental physical we don't
[1:27:06] care we've got a God that can deliver
[1:27:08] them
[1:27:12] but we don't have the compassion you
[1:27:13] know what's happened to us we're too
[1:27:15] into showing off one to another
[1:27:20] you build the one that'll build the
[1:27:22] bigger
[1:27:23] I'll have the biggest
[1:27:27] that's pretty bad real estate isn't it
[1:27:30] when there's only eight Souls saved
[1:27:36] forget that
[1:27:38] let's be the let's be spiritual
[1:27:41] what is the Holy Ghost given for so
[1:27:44] you'll have a burden for lost souls it
[1:27:47] isn't given that's the benefit of it to
[1:27:50] know you're saved to know you're sealed
[1:27:53] so you don't have to worry
[1:27:56] your life isn't always about trying to
[1:27:59] keep yourself straight he keeps you
[1:28:02] straight he's an advocate you get in
[1:28:05] this permissive will he works you back
[1:28:07] to his perfect will but you're about the
[1:28:10] father's business
[1:28:13] he says I have need to go by there I'm
[1:28:16] about my father's business there's a
[1:28:18] lost soul there he's walking down the
[1:28:20] street there's Zacchaeus up there he
[1:28:22] said oh Zach is hello

[1:28:26] there

[1:28:31] your place tonight
[1:28:36] by the time he was done with Zac gas He
[1:28:39] restored everything he stole
[1:28:41] he gave two-thirds of all he had to the
[1:28:44] poor and that little guy was on fire for
[1:28:46] God hallelujah you don't think his wife
[1:28:50] would have been praying for him what did
[1:28:52] he say her name was Rebecca is that what
[1:28:53] he said his wife's name he's just
[1:28:55] dancing in the spirit praising God
[1:28:58] the very one she believed
[1:29:01] was now at her table
[1:29:06] eating with her husband and he was
[1:29:09] eating it up
[1:29:13] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:29:18] forever
[1:29:19] that's what the Holy Ghost is given for
[1:29:24] God pouring himself into Christ correct
[1:29:28] Christ pouring himself into the church
[1:29:31] now watch
[1:29:34] at that day you'll know I'm I am in the
[1:29:39] father and you and me and I in you that
[1:29:44] day you'll know it
[1:29:45] for it's the whole thing is one Plan of
[1:29:51] Redemption
[1:29:56] it's part of the Plan of Redemption him
[1:29:59] coming in you
[1:30:02] and you going after the Lost
[1:30:06] you're part of their Redemption
[1:30:09] you're part of the Plan of Redemption
[1:30:11] don't you understand what we've done in
[1:30:14] this message we've left the Plan of
[1:30:17] Redemption and we've Fallen back into
[1:30:19] building churches and building names for
[1:30:22] ourselves and trying to show how much
[1:30:25] Doctrine we know and how smart we are
[1:30:28] and all this other stuff and we come
[1:30:32] high-minded puffed up we have Petty
[1:30:37] actually competing
[1:30:39] for one another when the Bible says your
[1:30:43] fools to compare yourself one to another
[1:30:45] let's get back to the father's business
[1:30:51] that's what he's in you for
[1:30:53] go into all the world preach the gospel
[1:30:56] I'm in you you lay hands on the sick
[1:31:01] you cast out demons
[1:31:05] you spread the good word
[1:31:08] you do it
[1:31:12] no
[1:31:14] Nickelodeon says conquered that and
[1:31:17] stole that from the people and if you
[1:31:19] get somebody sick you bring them to my
[1:31:21] holy office
[1:31:25] remember now I'm in charge of this
[1:31:27] movement
[1:31:30] and if I lay hands on them
[1:31:36] oh you know where you really find them
[1:31:38] how many knows the best place to find
[1:31:40] Jesus is
[1:31:42] it's in a closet
[1:31:45] that's where he's at
[1:31:47] he's in closets
[1:31:54] this inspires me I'm sorry you know why
[1:31:56] because it's bringing me back to my
[1:31:58] track bringing me back to where I belong
[1:32:01] getting me off of the negative putting
[1:32:04] me back on the positive
[1:32:14] that the whole thing's The Plan of
[1:32:16] Redemption coming down that God come
[1:32:19] back to live in and dwell with and
[1:32:23] commune to his people as he did at the
[1:32:28] beginning now then as soon as he gets
[1:32:31] his church
[1:32:33] in speaking condition
[1:32:36] he gets his church to that place he can
[1:32:39] flow himself through and love
[1:32:43] and persuade and fellowship then there
[1:32:48] will come a Eden he'll take his church
[1:32:50] back to where
[1:32:52] it left him
[1:32:55] back at Eden again where it fell
[1:33:04] how many times do we say it
[1:33:07] if we get that last one
[1:33:10] we're leaving
[1:33:13] why do we want a Revival here
[1:33:17] when we know the Revival is over
[1:33:23] you say well the bride's promised a
[1:33:25] Revival
[1:33:26] what's the Revival of the Bride
[1:33:30] doing the will of the father
[1:33:33] seeing them healed seeing demons cast
[1:33:36] out seeing people getting saved
[1:33:41] going about the father's business don't
[1:33:44] let Satan tell you that you don't have
[1:33:46] nobody to witness to
[1:33:51] you're trying to tell me you never go to
[1:33:52] the grocery store nobody ever asks you
[1:33:55] about how you look you never pump gas
[1:33:58] you know you'd have to absolutely be a
[1:34:01] recluse
[1:34:02] not to preach this gospel
[1:34:07] whistling him if you have to
[1:34:10] let them know
[1:34:13] right let them know and so we we
[1:34:17] understand that great Plan of Redemption
[1:34:20] now look what he says so you're part of
[1:34:23] the Plan of Redemption
[1:34:25] so we understand the Plan of Redemption
[1:34:27] right it came through justification
[1:34:29] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost now
[1:34:32] you're here to finish
[1:34:35] up the Plan of Redemption
[1:34:37] because he didn't finish all his work
[1:34:40] when he was on Earth
[1:34:43] he left a portion of it to be finished
[1:34:45] by his bride
[1:34:48] that she would bring forth children
[1:34:53] he says now in the age that we're in now
[1:34:58] living this age
[1:35:00] it's beyond Pentecost
[1:35:05] the age that we're living on is beyond
[1:35:08] Pentecost
[1:35:10] so we're moving up we're going up it's
[1:35:13] beyond that now this is the part that I
[1:35:16] think that we get I hope we can just
[1:35:18] settle in on and finish up on
[1:35:21] it says Now 49 now the church has come
[1:35:24] through those schools
[1:35:27] she married back Yonder a long time ago
[1:35:31] and become a denomination and an
[1:35:33] organization
[1:35:34] this is paragraph 49. but you notice the
[1:35:39] birth produced something else
[1:35:42] and now it's got to a place
[1:35:45] where the Pentecostal Church
[1:35:48] with the New Birth has been tested and
[1:35:52] tried and now it's come to a place God
[1:35:56] doesn't deal with the church just as an
[1:36:00] organization
[1:36:04] let's follow it he deals with the church
[1:36:08] as individuals
[1:36:12] so this last church that he puts
[1:36:15] together
[1:36:17] isn't put together by an anointing
[1:36:22] it isn't put together by a spiritual
[1:36:24] movement
[1:36:28] though Pentecost through the baptism of
[1:36:31] the Holy Spirit and the restoration of
[1:36:34] gifts and people going out and sharing
[1:36:37] that experience they came together and
[1:36:40] they began to unite around it but what
[1:36:43] happened God was moving past that to the
[1:36:48] individual
[1:36:49] so they organized in order to keep that
[1:36:54] revival going
[1:36:56] and when Pentecost started pulling away
[1:36:59] from the true word can you imagine
[1:37:02] Pentecost pulling away from the
[1:37:04] messenger when the messenger was doing
[1:37:07] every sign and wonder and every gift
[1:37:10] that they were trying to get
[1:37:15] what was the difference
[1:37:17] they didn't want to go on to perfection
[1:37:25] now it's not easy to die to yourself
[1:37:28] and let Christ live in you
[1:37:35] it's not easy
[1:37:42] to die out
[1:37:44] but it's the desire of the believer
[1:37:54] he said
[1:38:00] he says God
[1:38:03] he deals with the church as individuals
[1:38:05] each individual in the church
[1:38:08] each individual in the church and now
[1:38:12] it's got a Time
[1:38:15] it's no secret
[1:38:17] we all see it when man proves and God
[1:38:22] and God loves him he takes him out
[1:38:26] somewhere to himself
[1:38:28] there in the front of angels he does
[1:38:32] something for him he lifts him up there
[1:38:37] in the presence of God and gives him and
[1:38:41] fills him and sets him out that the age
[1:38:45] that's the age that were
[1:38:50] living in
[1:38:55] I don't know any better way to say at
[1:38:57] church than just the way brother Branham
[1:39:00] says it
[1:39:01] what is the egg we're Beyond Pentecost
[1:39:04] now
[1:39:05] this is the age that God deals with you
[1:39:08] as an individual so don't run off to a
[1:39:12] church movement
[1:39:13] don't run off oh they're doing this over
[1:39:16] here and they're doing that over here he
[1:39:19] told us they would say low he's here low
[1:39:21] he's there Loth you'll find them here
[1:39:24] although you'll find them there no
[1:39:25] that's not where you find them you find
[1:39:28] them as an individual he's dealing with
[1:39:30] the individuals in the church and what
[1:39:33] does he do with that individual he lifts
[1:39:36] that individual up in the presence of
[1:39:39] God in the presence of the Angel and
[1:39:42] gives him a gift and does something for
[1:39:45] him what is the gift of God his eternal
[1:39:47] life through Christ Jesus
[1:39:55] that's what he does
[1:40:00] he gifts him
[1:40:02] and fills him
[1:40:04] and sets him out
[1:40:06] that's the age that we're living
[1:40:10] in
[1:40:15] they didn't want to go there
[1:40:21] you know because to go there it changes
[1:40:23] your comfort zone
[1:40:26] what happens if all after all this time
[1:40:29] and all the labor I put in and
[1:40:32] everything I did when I got lifted up to
[1:40:35] that place he said I don't really want
[1:40:36] you to be a pastor
[1:40:38] Brother David
[1:40:40] I all I've ever really wanted you to be
[1:40:42] is a janitor
[1:40:46] ooh
[1:40:48] wait a minute
[1:40:50] I mean I kind of like that people saying
[1:40:53] pastor
[1:40:54] Brother David
[1:40:57] oh I like people coming for advice and
[1:41:00] oh that that makes me feel like I'm
[1:41:02] something
[1:41:04] reality you're nothing son
[1:41:09] you don't have a thing I didn't give you
[1:41:13] you've got by living off the prophet's
[1:41:16] message
[1:41:18] Hallelujah
[1:41:20] then I'll get a prophet's reward
[1:41:24] I like that
[1:41:26] what's your prophet's reward being a
[1:41:29] friend of God
[1:41:30] who else was known as a friend of God
[1:41:33] sounds like my father
[1:41:36] Abraham
[1:41:38] he was a friend of God
[1:41:40] amen who is David he was beloved of God
[1:41:44] God loved David for the letter rascal
[1:41:48] but God loved them why he had a pure
[1:41:51] heart
[1:41:53] he had every weakness there was in the
[1:41:55] book
[1:41:57] he even killed the man
[1:41:59] but when it came down to judgment
[1:42:02] David's heart had the righteous and just
[1:42:05] judgment in it and God loved that about
[1:42:08] David he said be it so unto me what was
[1:42:12] he a type of Christ let my sins let it
[1:42:15] let that judgment fall upon me I'm not
[1:42:18] above the law and the word of God
[1:42:21] oh my
[1:42:23] amen but that Plan of Redemption was in
[1:42:28] full swing Bathsheba was going to be God
[1:42:31] and there the story continues on isn't
[1:42:34] it beautiful aren't you so eternally
[1:42:36] secure
[1:42:42] he says the same holy spirit that saved
[1:42:45] the lutherans
[1:42:46] that Sanctified the Methodist
[1:42:49] that baptized the Pentecostal is Now
[1:42:52] setting in order the coming of the Lord
[1:42:56] Jesus
[1:42:58] when it'll be so powerful
[1:43:02] that body will come into a group of
[1:43:05] church that will draw the rest of them
[1:43:08] from the grave that'll be a resurrection
[1:43:11] that's what the Holy Ghost is for what
[1:43:15] is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot
[1:43:19] be made perfect they lived in one day
[1:43:23] under that we're living on in another
[1:43:26] day when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:43:30] the spirit of God will raise up a
[1:43:34] standard against it
[1:43:36] Hallelujah have you ever seen the enemy
[1:43:40] come in like a flood you are the last
[1:43:43] Light the last voice the last sign the
[1:43:48] last people that possess the true
[1:43:52] unadulterated word of God you are the
[1:43:55] standard his pride is the standard
[1:43:58] because this Eve isn't like the other
[1:44:01] eve and she will not be enticed by his
[1:44:05] laws she will not be enticed by his
[1:44:08] kingdom she doesn't care about his
[1:44:10] wisdom she doesn't care about his money
[1:44:13] she's married and become one with the
[1:44:16] bridegroom in an invisible Union and
[1:44:19] they are standing
[1:44:21] letting the light
[1:44:23] and the union of Christ in her
[1:44:26] showing the world that he's the same
[1:44:30] yesterday today and forever
[1:44:34] is that possible
[1:44:37] we saw it
[1:44:39] with our own eyes
[1:44:45] we saw the Plan of Redemption
[1:44:48] mature
[1:44:50] to the place that the angel put his foot
[1:44:54] on the land and sea and opened the seals
[1:44:58] why couldn't they see it because he
[1:45:01] veiled it
[1:45:03] in a little humble man
[1:45:07] and no matter what works he did
[1:45:11] they wouldn't believe it
[1:45:14] because they had nothing
[1:45:17] in them
[1:45:18] to believe with
[1:45:21] aren't you glad you've got something in
[1:45:25] you
[1:45:26] to believe with
[1:45:29] and in closing
[1:45:31] we'll just speak
[1:45:34] these words
[1:45:37] because we really want to draw the
[1:45:39] difference
[1:45:40] oh my dear friend
[1:45:43] paragraph
[1:45:45] 57.
[1:45:46] oh my dear friend from around this
[1:45:49] country
[1:45:50] and in this little city
[1:45:54] if I could only with my human voice
[1:45:57] Place into your heart
[1:46:00] the importance of receiving the baptism
[1:46:05] of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:07] it would be the most wonderful
[1:46:10] revelation
[1:46:12] that you ever had in your life
[1:46:15] to see
[1:46:17] what you must do it
[1:46:24] it's so important
[1:46:28] to receive
[1:46:31] the baptism
[1:46:33] of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:35] the spirit of God
[1:46:38] coming in you
[1:46:39] to do his work for the Plan of
[1:46:43] Redemption
[1:46:44] not a blessing of another age
[1:46:48] but that God has a portion
[1:46:52] of the Plan of Redemption
[1:46:54] that is set aside for you to perform
[1:46:59] and in order for you to perform that
[1:47:03] portion of the word that's giving to you
[1:47:06] you can't do it with an experience of a
[1:47:10] day gone by
[1:47:12] you must have that fresh Spirit of the
[1:47:17] age
[1:47:17] be baptized with his spirit and his
[1:47:22] person in you to fulfill the work that
[1:47:25] he has for this end time
[1:47:28] which is an individual affair
[1:47:33] you say I can't do it you can do it
[1:47:36] because he said you could
[1:47:39] I just can't overcome no
[1:47:43] but he can
[1:47:48] he can do it by his spirit
[1:47:51] it's the law of God by his Spirit you
[1:47:55] want to overcome something that's got
[1:47:58] you asked for the baptism of the Holy
[1:48:02] Spirit
[1:48:05] ask the mighty conquer
[1:48:07] to come in make himself real in you so
[1:48:12] you know wow I used to desire this who
[1:48:15] took that away
[1:48:18] when his big great guy stands up here I
[1:48:21] gave up smoking I gave up drinking
[1:48:26] you want to look at him and says did you
[1:48:28] die for my sins
[1:48:30] you don't even need the Lord
[1:48:32] you've done all these Mighty works
[1:48:36] but you don't know
[1:48:40] noem for yourself
[1:48:43] know him for your need
[1:48:45] not you know and I told the story and it
[1:48:49] was my ignorance being a really young
[1:48:51] Christian I'd never been healed
[1:48:56] and I wanted to be healed I'd listen to
[1:48:59] brother brahm's testimony of those
[1:49:00] people being healed and I thought man
[1:49:01] those people are so great
[1:49:04] I was too blind to realize what I had
[1:49:07] so I prayed oh God heal me
[1:49:10] well I didn't realize I was going to
[1:49:12] have to have something to be healed of
[1:49:16] but you won't know what
[1:49:18] God will give you the desire of your
[1:49:20] heart
[1:49:21] man I prayed that prayer in Earnest the
[1:49:23] next day my shoulder was out of joint my
[1:49:25] thumb was broken on my ribs my ribs were
[1:49:29] bruised I was just smacked my arm was
[1:49:32] hanging down by my side I couldn't do
[1:49:34] nothing
[1:49:35] guess what
[1:49:37] I was a candidate
[1:49:39] for Divine Healing
[1:49:43] I got in a meeting
[1:49:46] in the spirit of the Lord come by me I
[1:49:49] don't know if he came by everybody else
[1:49:53] I don't judge the spirit of the Lord by
[1:49:55] somebody dancing
[1:49:57] I don't judge the spirit of the Lord by
[1:49:59] someone he's singing
[1:50:01] I feel the presence of the Lord but I
[1:50:03] judge by the spirit of the Lord by him
[1:50:06] personally speaking to me
[1:50:09] and I'll tell you something there's a
[1:50:12] lot of difference between worship
[1:50:14] when you worship you get in the spirit
[1:50:17] of worship you're worshiping you're
[1:50:20] doing all the singing you're doing all
[1:50:22] the praising you're lifting the
[1:50:23] accolades to the Lord your I don't care
[1:50:26] if you shout and you dance and that's
[1:50:28] wonderful I'm not against Nancy if
[1:50:31] anybody if you feel that you have the
[1:50:33] gift of tongues or prophesy we'll meet
[1:50:35] in the church one night a week or we'll
[1:50:37] meet before service and we can exercise
[1:50:39] and practice those gifts
[1:50:44] and then we'll judge them
[1:50:46] and if they come to pass you all have
[1:50:49] the gift of healing
[1:50:53] you can heal somebody not even my laying
[1:50:56] hands on them
[1:50:58] but by believing
[1:51:00] by applying the token there's so many
[1:51:03] the way God works but you know so when
[1:51:06] we worship and we praise and we're
[1:51:08] rejoicing you notice we're doing all the
[1:51:10] thing but let me tell you something
[1:51:12] every time that God moves
[1:51:15] there's Dead Silence
[1:51:21] everybody stands in awe
[1:51:25] you watch the prophet when he shows up
[1:51:27] on the scene
[1:51:29] man everything gets real quiet
[1:51:32] everybody that comes up before him is
[1:51:35] reverent when John come into His
[1:51:38] presence he felt like dead the prophet
[1:51:40] of God every time he says he comes I
[1:51:43] feel like I died
[1:51:48] don't mistake worship
[1:51:51] and praise and joy
[1:51:55] and the joy of the Lord and the shout of
[1:51:57] the camp understand there's a difference
[1:52:00] between us worshiping in the spirit and
[1:52:03] God moving and performing his word
[1:52:08] on all for worship I'm all for our
[1:52:11] praise I wish we you had more of it I
[1:52:14] had more of it
[1:52:16] we just don't want to confuse the two
[1:52:20] when he's moves
[1:52:23] everything stops
[1:52:26] he demands reverence
[1:52:29] look at when when was it Isaiah that
[1:52:32] when the temple and he saw the angels
[1:52:35] and what did he say oh Lord
[1:52:38] I'm a miserable man take the coal from
[1:52:42] The Altar and touch my lips
[1:52:49] it's so important
[1:52:52] that you understand this and and you've
[1:52:59] got to remember he says
[1:53:02] oh he says
[1:53:05] what a wonderful Revelation the baptism
[1:53:08] of the spirit is he says let me make
[1:53:11] that clear
[1:53:12] about
[1:53:15] you're not converted Peter had been
[1:53:18] saved but believed on the Lord followed
[1:53:21] him Jesus told him who he was and he
[1:53:24] followed him he gave him power against
[1:53:26] unclean spirits
[1:53:28] and Sanctified him but after that
[1:53:32] and became the chief spokeman of the
[1:53:34] group as the Catholics would call it
[1:53:37] Bishop of the church or Pope or whatever
[1:53:40] was head of it and Jesus said that night
[1:53:44] of his betrayal loveth thou meet Peter
[1:53:47] and he said Lord you know I love you
[1:53:51] he said feed my sheep he said that three
[1:53:54] times and Peter said you know I love you
[1:53:57] you know Lord you know all things you
[1:53:59] know I love you he said I go with you to
[1:54:03] the end I'll go with you till the death
[1:54:06] and so forth he said before the Croc
[1:54:09] crows three times before the Croc closed
[1:54:12] you'll deny me three times but Peter I
[1:54:15] prayed for you now listen
[1:54:17] that's not all of it I prayed for you
[1:54:20] and after you are converted
[1:54:23] and strengthen your brethren after you
[1:54:27] are converted
[1:54:29] he had shouted
[1:54:31] he had probably danced in the spirit
[1:54:35] he had done all kinds of things but he
[1:54:38] hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet
[1:54:42] after you are converted then strengthen
[1:54:45] your brethren that's true carry out his
[1:54:52] plan
[1:54:59] and he goes on here he says now watch
[1:55:02] what Paul said
[1:55:04] paragraph 62. watch what Paul said that
[1:55:08] John every baptized under repentance
[1:55:11] not for remission of sins but unto
[1:55:14] repentance
[1:55:15] he said that's what you believe when you
[1:55:18] accept Christ as your personal savior
[1:55:21] you believe under the baptism of the
[1:55:24] Holy Ghost that is not the baptism of
[1:55:28] the Holy Ghost my dear Baptist Brethren
[1:55:32] it is wrong
[1:55:36] so there is a baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:55:39] after you believe
[1:55:42] you can believe
[1:55:44] with your own spirit
[1:55:46] you can repent
[1:55:48] with your own Spirit you can do good
[1:55:51] works with your own Spirit you can lose
[1:55:54] weight with your own spirit
[1:55:56] you can overcome habits
[1:55:59] with your own spirit
[1:56:02] you can Bridle your tongue
[1:56:04] with your own Spirit but you can't carry
[1:56:08] out the Plan of Salvation without his
[1:56:11] spirit
[1:56:15] do you understand that
[1:56:18] there's a difference
[1:56:20] and he said that this morning there's a
[1:56:23] difference between a Christian
[1:56:25] professing Christian and a Christian
[1:56:28] that's got the Holy Spirit
[1:56:33] may I repeat what the prophet said he
[1:56:36] says let it be known if I could with my
[1:56:39] voice how important it is to have the
[1:56:42] Holy Spirit you know a lot of people had
[1:56:45] the Holy Spirit and they gave up their
[1:56:47] leadership to pastors to church
[1:56:50] Authority instead of being led of the
[1:56:53] holy spirit because that church got him
[1:56:56] afraid
[1:56:58] you don't have to be afraid
[1:57:02] if God be for you
[1:57:04] who can be against you
[1:57:07] let's make sure
[1:57:09] that our children don't just believe the
[1:57:12] message let's make sure they have the
[1:57:14] Holy Spirit
[1:57:16] let's make sure the person of Jesus
[1:57:19] Christ has come into their hearts and
[1:57:22] their lives
[1:57:24] and if you don't you're not sure of that
[1:57:28] gather a few of the elders together
[1:57:30] kneel down and pray together
[1:57:34] until you surrender yourself
[1:57:38] to him
[1:57:40] it don't mean you don't believe
[1:57:46] it's just maybe something's been
[1:57:48] battling you and you haven't been able
[1:57:51] to overcome it you don't believe that
[1:57:53] you're not saved it doesn't mean you're
[1:57:55] not a Believer it's just that you can't
[1:57:59] finish the work
[1:58:01] of the Plan of Redemption which Christ
[1:58:04] wants to do in you
[1:58:06] while you're in that condition
[1:58:10] so you must receive the baptism of the
[1:58:15] Holy Spirit you must receive Christ into
[1:58:19] every part of your life even the part of
[1:58:23] your life that you're ashamed of
[1:58:27] you don't have to confess that part with
[1:58:30] everybody
[1:58:33] you don't have to share
[1:58:36] all your inner troubles with everybody
[1:58:40] but sharing with him
[1:58:43] because he already knows it
[1:58:47] he's a discerner
[1:58:49] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:58:53] he will come in and do for you
[1:58:56] exceedingly and abundantly above which
[1:58:59] you could ask or think
[1:59:02] just like our messenger said I can't
[1:59:06] if I could with my lips convince you how
[1:59:10] important it is
[1:59:13] to have the baptism of the Holy Spirit I
[1:59:17] cannot judge who has it and who doesn't
[1:59:21] you know in your whole heart and you can
[1:59:25] and that's why the scripture says don't
[1:59:27] grieve that spirit
[1:59:31] let it live back restore it back get the
[1:59:35] fire of it back lord return unto me the
[1:59:39] joy of my salvation and that's just what
[1:59:42] some people have lost
[1:59:44] they've lost the joy of the Salvation
[1:59:46] they they begin to doubt whether they
[1:59:50] not they have the Holy Spirit or not
[1:59:52] because of their sins if you sin
[1:59:58] and a man that says he sinneth not is a
[2:00:02] what liar
[2:00:04] for we've all sinned and come short of
[2:00:07] the glory of God but we have a
[2:00:10] propisionary right we have an advocate
[2:00:14] which is the Holy Spirit
[2:00:17] that make the advocate we go to him
[2:00:20] crying Abba Father
[2:00:22] and he's just and forgetful to forgive
[2:00:25] us our sins and to restore us back
[2:00:29] into the duty of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00:32] if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[2:00:35] you should know
[2:00:37] do you have the assurance
[2:00:40] do you have the sign you're different
[2:00:42] the world can tell you're different
[2:00:46] do you have the seal you know you're
[2:00:49] going there
[2:00:51] even if you stumble you know you're
[2:00:53] going
[2:00:56] You've Got The Advocate
[2:00:59] you got the comforter you've got the joy
[2:01:03] you know you have those things
[2:01:06] I've failed many a Time
[2:01:09] many a Time
[2:01:11] I I I'm ashamed
[2:01:15] of my failures
[2:01:18] but there's one thing
[2:01:20] I know
[2:01:21] he promised me
[2:01:23] he'd never leave me nor forsake me
[2:01:28] and when I'm about to give it all up
[2:01:31] he comes
[2:01:34] and he deals with my heart
[2:01:36] and he speaks to my spirit
[2:01:39] and he restoreth my soul
[2:01:44] because he don't look at the flesh
[2:01:47] he looks at the inward man
[2:01:50] that's what the holy spirit's for
[2:01:53] the Holy Spirit isn't here to restore
[2:01:56] the gifts in the church
[2:01:58] they never left
[2:02:01] the church is just moving in
[2:02:04] to a greater perfection
[2:02:07] where each individual is a living
[2:02:10] Messiah
[2:02:13] going about doing the same works that he
[2:02:17] did the works that I do you personal
[2:02:21] pronoun shall do also
[2:02:24] you say what's going to cause them to do
[2:02:27] that a spirit an anointing no the love
[2:02:32] of God shed abroad in Your Heart by the
[2:02:36] Holy Spirit
[2:02:38] that's what motivates the works it's the
[2:02:41] love of God you and him entering into a
[2:02:45] love song that's the whole message of
[2:02:47] this hour was a bride
[2:02:51] and her husband
[2:02:53] becoming one
[2:02:55] and now him living in his church
[2:02:58] carrying out the Plan of Redemption
[2:03:02] that's the age we live in now isn't he
[2:03:09] wonderful
[2:03:11] all the father hath given me will come
[2:03:14] nothing will pluck you out of the palm
[2:03:17] of my hand
[2:03:19] so quit being miserable
[2:03:24] you know what I mean
[2:03:26] don't be miserable
[2:03:30] the prodigal son was miserable
[2:03:34] he had a corner husk and in his mouth
[2:03:39] and there's a pig on the other end of
[2:03:42] that corner yeah and they're fighting
[2:03:47] hey he's wandering around in the
[2:03:50] pig slop
[2:03:51] trying to get life from a pig
[2:03:56] what does the scripture said
[2:03:58] he come to himself
[2:04:02] being
[2:04:05] what am I doing here
[2:04:09] the servants live better in my father's
[2:04:11] house
[2:04:12] I'm going to go back to my father's
[2:04:15] house and I'm going to repent
[2:04:16] I'm going to say father I'm not worthy
[2:04:20] I'm not worthy to be your son I've
[2:04:22] squandered everything you did for me
[2:04:27] but just let me come back and serve you
[2:04:30] I'd rather do pigs in your barn
[2:04:34] than in their Barn
[2:04:36] I'll do whatever you have what did the
[2:04:39] father do
[2:04:40] kill the fatted calf get the robe my son
[2:04:44] that was lost has returned there's more
[2:04:48] rejoicing in heaven
[2:04:50] over one Soul returning back then there
[2:04:54] is the 99 why because that's our hearts
[2:04:58] desire too because we have the same
[2:05:01] Spirit he has we want to see our lost
[2:05:03] loved ones we want to see our children
[2:05:05] it's time that we're going to fight
[2:05:08] it's time to beat our plowshares into
[2:05:11] swords and take the sword of God's word
[2:05:13] and start going to the father father
[2:05:15] that's my child I claim them in the name
[2:05:18] of Jesus Christ send your Holy Spirit
[2:05:21] move in somebody bring somebody by
[2:05:24] deliver them
[2:05:27] that's the work of redemption
[2:05:32] what a good of who we speak with tongues
[2:05:34] of men's and angels and have not charity
[2:05:38] oh I hope that I'm I I church I believe
[2:05:43] it just the way he says it
[2:05:46] what a wonderful message to listen to
[2:05:49] what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy
[2:05:52] Ghost given for for you people that love
[2:05:54] the study of the Bible he does types and
[2:05:57] he goes through this and he goes through
[2:05:59] that and he lays it out through the ages
[2:06:01] and he brings us right down to where we
[2:06:04] are in our day
[2:06:07] the teaching reign
[2:06:09] and then the latter rain
[2:06:14] how come the latter rain wasn't it
[2:06:16] what did he say it was the unrighteous
[2:06:19] partaking
[2:06:21] of spiritual gifts thy deviled inspired
[2:06:25] men
[2:06:26] but there will be a righteous partaking
[2:06:30] but what will that partaking be for
[2:06:33] it'll be for the purpose
[2:06:36] of doing our part
[2:06:38] in the Plan of Redemption go back
[2:06:43] study it
[2:06:45] see if that's not exactly what the
[2:06:48] prophet said the Holy Spirit was given
[2:06:51] for and we want to baptize people just
[2:06:54] so they can say they have the Holy Ghost
[2:06:57] it won't profit nothing until the
[2:07:02] baptism matches the purpose
[2:07:07] then you'll see these signs follow the
[2:07:10] believer I love you I don't sing very
[2:07:13] good so if the musicians would come and
[2:07:16] maybe I was long tonight will Jack stand
[2:07:19] together and and dismiss on a tune and
[2:07:23] and if you have chance this week
[2:07:28] and I'm sure you all have your own
[2:07:30] private studies going on and and uh
[2:07:37] but if you get a chance just to listen
[2:07:39] to those messages
[2:07:42] what is the Holy Ghost and what it's for
[2:07:44] you won't you won't start killing
[2:07:47] yourself
[2:07:48] whether you have it or not
[2:07:50] you will know that there is comforting
[2:07:53] you
[2:07:54] sealing you keeping you
[2:07:57] you make mistakes yes that's why he's an
[2:08:00] advocate
[2:08:03] does Satan come against you sure
[2:08:06] That's why nothing will pluck you out of
[2:08:08] the palm of his hand Church there's
[2:08:11] nothing like
[2:08:13] him
[2:08:15] taking his Abode in you
[2:08:17] and you may believe him with all your
[2:08:20] heart you may be doing everything you
[2:08:23] can with all your might and I thank God
[2:08:26] for that you'll have a greater chance at
[2:08:29] the Judgment living like that but you
[2:08:33] want to get that judgment
[2:08:35] seat completely out of your life you
[2:08:38] stay until you're positively sure you've
[2:08:41] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost then
[2:08:43] you'll never have to face that judgment
[2:08:47] you'll know he's in you
[2:08:49] and and we are here for you
[2:08:52] I I don't have no evidence to give you
[2:08:56] he's the evidence Giver
[2:09:00] but if he takes up his Abode in you
[2:09:03] you'll know it
[2:09:05] and you'll love it
[2:09:07] and you'll thank him for it
[2:09:09] and the frown will turn to a grim
[2:09:13] the stoop shoulders will fly back and
[2:09:16] you'll be able to say I am Bound for the
