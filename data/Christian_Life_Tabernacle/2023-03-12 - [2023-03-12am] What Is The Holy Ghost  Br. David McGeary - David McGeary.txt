[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] let's all stand the welcomed me to the house of the Lord we pray that you came expecting this morning I got to speak to you amen for the showers we just want to come open our service this morning [Music] thank you [Music] let's pray this morning we got away with you thanks for allowing us to be here again on a Sunday morning I'm going to come and praise your name and to receive of you Lord seeing the Lord like I said many maybe traveling this morning Lord and I mean it's been the week of the spring break we pray to keep them all in safety wherever they might be and we ask okay you come and speak to us this morning let your blessings come down and minister to us as we come here to praise you in Jesus name amen amen you can turn around and just shake the hand to somebody tell them God bless you good morning beautiful sunny day we're happy to praise the Lord this morning amen as we just invite our brother Mike to read his song this morning amen foreign [Music] know those of you that work in corporate environments or in big businesses of really any kind you will be familiar with code of conduct training ethics training basically and you know the whole purpose of that is to you know describe the code of conduct is to basically describe the principles that that business is going to work using so that they can be trustworthy so that you know their customers and their suppliers and the government can all trust that this business is going to conduct itself ethically but they'll be trustworthy that they're going to do the right thing and you know we recently had to go through ours and it was basically a lengthy training to teach everyone once again how to be ethical and do the right thing and every year I go through that I ask myself the question shouldn't this just be common sense and then just as quickly it occurs to me that no you know unless there is something in that person some part of God All That Remains is Beast nature which at its best is temporarily controlled by rules or by teaching or by Behavior or you know commitment you know and it's really a surreal thing to go through training that basically is reminding people how to be good and to commit themselves each year to the task it's basically an annual confession from the company that they're acknowledging that people are generally not going to do the right thing unless we constantly remind them constantly make them promise to be good to remember how to act in a right manner to have integrity you know and it's uh some form of goodness if you will that they're trying to commit themselves to and you know but it requires constant reminding constant training constant teaching constant commitment constant discipline every year having to be reminded this is how to be good you know it's no different than someone trying to live a religious life you know whether that book that rule book is a code of conduct or the Bible itself you know a lifestyle of disciplining yourself according to a program you know something that requires constant reminding and teaching and discipline and commitment you know it's nothing more than a covering of what Fester is underneath you know obese nature that will naturally drift to the wrong thing now the bottom line is it's all fake you know that's the takeaway you know it none of that actually changes who people are it just gives them a way to pretend to be something than what they really are you know and except even if somebody is the most faithful at following those rules at its best we know that it's nothing more than filthy rags you know David knew something about that we're going to read Psalm 12 this morning and we could be living a descript we could be reading a description of the very age we live in you know it starts out help Lord For The Godly Man ceaseth for the faithful fall from Among The Children of Men they speak vanity everyone with his neighbor with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak you know if that doesn't describe our day pretending to be good you know in many cases thinking that it's really working David says in verse 8 the wicked walk on every side when the vilest men or women are exalted that is in our hour a glorifying individuals who have the most perverted lives and celebrating them as Heroes examples of success voices of righteousness you know I read that and another scripture came to my mind and it was John 12 32 which said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me you know what's being lifted up you know what's being exalted based on what people are being pointed to you know all that program all that training all those Rule books at the end of the day they never bring people to Jesus Christ they bring you to the voting booth or to a training class or to a consultant or to a church or whatever but never too Jesus Christ himself and that tells you who's really being lifted up you know what caught my attention is this verse in verse six and this was a real blessing to me it said the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of Earth purified seven times you know I thought of that as with all the fakeness the fake good that's about you know I'm so grateful that we have access to Pure words you know this is this phrase caught my attention as silver tried in a furnace of Earth you know that speaks of the refining process purifying process they used for silver back in his day and they still use it today the process is called compilation if you want to read it up read look it up and read all the technical details but you know the short story is this a little bit of silver is placed in a little Earthen vessel that silver is covered with all kinds of natural impurities but then a little bit of fire begins to be put on that Earthen vessel and all those impurities begin to be drawn out of that silver and All That Remains is pure silver you know purity is something that stands the test you know it proves fire proves what it is you know the word is want something that stands the test as well it's hands it stands the test so well that he's trusts it to put it in Earthen vessels full of impurity and in there it is made known even when the fire is applied to the Earth and vessel you know you think about all that goodness that's out there and it may create the appearance of goodness for a Time but just apply apply a little bit of fire to it and it'll tell you what's really made of but you know we want something that's placed inside something that is proven by fire something that matches the original the original pure silver you know not Earthen vessels painted silver but vessels filled with silver the word you know it's not about disciplining ourselves to be good we can go ahead and stand we're going to read that short we'll Psalm together or teaching ourselves to be good or disciplining ourselves to stay good or line up with the scriptures but it's about getting that silver inside our Earthen vessel you know John said it this way in first John 2 20 but ye have an unction from the Holy One and know all things and in verse 27 but the anointing which he have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it has taught you ye shall abide in him silver in Earthen vessels you know so let's go ahead and read that Psalm together just think of what job said but he knoweth the way that I take when he has tried me I shall come forth as gold let's read that help Lord For The Godly Man ceaseth for the faithful fail from among the children of men they speak vanity every one with his neighbor with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak the Lord shall cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that speaketh proud things who have said with our tongue will we Prevail our lips are our own who is Lord over us for the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now will I arise saith the Lord I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of Earth purified seven times Thou shalt keep them O Lord Thou shalt preserve them from this generation Forever The Wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted amen

God bless you this morning you may be seated um we have an announcement that we need to make this morning it's uh nice to have brother and sister McKinney with us today from South Carolina they've come out to be with us but also it's to announce the engagement of their daughter grace to the Emmanuel Cabello where are you guys at are you here together stand up you look pretty good in this suit and tie their early man she's already having a good effect on you amen God bless you so much nicely to announce that engagement and to have everybody with us you love the Lord this morning amen we're gonna just have Bible study this morning and because we're good musicians thank you so much this morning I work in Lord willing this is what everybody tells me and you know if God tells you something you can count on it if man tells you something you got a 50 50. you know what I mean but I've Been Told that they're going to start digging the plumbing in this Tuesday so we are going to start having some open ditches and so where you have to be extra careful to watch your children and some of the ditches will maybe be almost four feet deep most of them will not be but Rita's got to take extra care so if he takes Extra Care in this and then this coming week some of you brothers that might have spring break we do have a few projects that we have to get prepared in order for everything that come to pass so we certainly ask you to do help us out this next week if you can if you're on spring break and that will give you a coupon to McDonald's so we appreciate that you love the Lord this morning amen you know God's good to us and you know one of the promises of the scripture is that he would increase our understanding and we know our congregation is unique we're unique uh by uh the coming together of of many different countries different languages uh uh different people but all purchased by the same blood amen and and we're grateful uh for that uh we're also unique because we have a wide range of uh growth in the message we have a lot of new Believers we have a lot of people have been in the message two three four five ten years and then we've got those that have been longer and so our our our range of the uh word of God is is almost like from kindergarten to uh to college I guess if you would want to use that and so we can always grow and increase in the understanding of God's word but isn't it unique that God's work can reach you no matter what level you're at he's got something for you um so um this morning it just come on my heart uh to just talk to us a little bit this morning about what is the Holy Ghost that always seems to be the issue of do I have the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost you know the prophet of God made a statement that is uh really something he said you know man doesn't know what electricity is they don't know what it is uh they they've got the they've got they can harness it uh they can make it turn on a light they can do all these things exactly but they don't know exactly what it is and they still don't I mean they know that they put two magnetos together and they rotate them and it produces some sort of field and and it's it's phenomenal but as much as they use it and they don't they can't put their finger on it and describe what it is except The Holy Spirits like that we don't know we can't really ever comprehend in our mind what it is the you know what I mean but uh but there's a there's a way that we can understand it and so that's what our hearts desire is this morning is to have Fellowship around the word to to establish a strong and understand it where it is that we're going so we've talked about we've talked about the God of this evil Age and and how many of those he's really stepping up on his throne I mean uh uh and and we know this is perilous times just to be honest with you uh if there's ever a time now that you need to Anchor in your faith and don't be afraid is is now they just had a large uh Bank collapse in California uh I heard one lady interview she said I had 10 million dollars in that bank and she was trying to reassure all her stockholders and everything but we're divest we have money every place else you know but you could just see the dread in her face and I thought you know I'm glad I don't my hopes are in nothing less than Jesus Christ in his righteousness Amen on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand and I thought oh there you know there goes one and they say oh this is going to call the layoffs everywhere and and this and that you know what and I just thought wow the scripture says the righteous shall not beg bread amen be content in whatever state that you're in amen so I'm glad I'm in the state of Texas but the uh about uh I just thought you know it's it that Bank California Bank Silicon Valley all that technology and stock and everything has just taken a crash in everything thought technology was the savior of us all there's still one savior amen and there's still one spirit by where we're all baptized One Faith one Spirit there's one word amen so let's just Fellowship this morning let's build our faith build our hearts up in him maybe you'll take comfort this morning and understand that God's for you he's not against you and he'll do all that he can to do whatever he can for you in fact he'll leave the 99 to go after the one he'll he'll do everything he can to heal you to mold you to build you to comfort you he's a great Lord so let's stand this morning and turn in our Bibles okay and we're going to read in Acts 7. and uh so this is Paul uh standing before the council and uh they had brought Paul in because of what that he's preaching and Paul is now addressing the council and the Jews and the elders and he begins to speak to him and we're going to take this text from the seventh to the eighth verse then said the high priest are these things so and uh and and he said men Brethren and fathers hearken the god of Glory appeareth unto our Father Abraham when he was in mesopedonia before he dealt in Charon and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and come unto the land which I shall show thee and he came out of the land of chaldea and came out of the Lamb the Chaldeans and dwelt in Charon and from hence when his father was dead he moved him into this land wherein ye now dwell and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child Hallelujah and God spake unto this why God spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a Strange Land and that they should bring them into bondage and then treat them evil 400 years and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge say God and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place and he gave him the Covenant of circumcision and so Abraham begot Isaac and circumcised him the Eighth Day and Isaac begot Jacob and Jacob begot the 12 Patriarchs May the father bless his word in Jesus name we pray amen maybe she's I'd like to read this little statement here before we start because I thought it was uh pretty comforting as we go forward in our our thing today but we'd like to make this there is nothing that will defeat Satan there's never been nothing on the earth yet that would defeat Satan like the word of God Jesus said in his greatest battle he said it is written amen and I I thought this would just be nice to read he said in this morning well I've been listening a few days ago to a broadcast that seemed to want to tell that creation just come from some ashes blowing together and some phosphate and a few chemicals on the earth and the warm sunshine created The Germ of life and brought out life said how ridiculous when the sunshine will kill any germ of life lay a germ out in the sun shine and it'll kill it immediately and there is no such thing but Satan trying to punch at me and after I had taken my little Rebecca to school this morning and on the road back I started to turn the radio on again and I thought I'd get into that stuff again so I just turned it back off and and as I was going up the street Satan said to me he said do you know that this man that you call Jesus was just a man like one day in his life like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts he was just a man that they began to have a few people together around him and to say he's a great man and after a while he became greater and then he become a God to them and now it's scattered all over the world since he's dead and that's all Satan telling them you know and I thought how a liar you are and then I turned just as I was crossing Graham Street I said Satan you that's talking to my conscience I'd like to ask you a few things who was it that the Hebrew Prophet spoke of that would come who was the anointed Messiah what was upon those men that foresaw him and told his life a thousand years before he got there who was it that foretold it just to the letter and when he come they said he would be numbered with the transgressors and he was he was wounded for our transgressions and he was he was he made his grave with the rich but he should rise on the third day and he did and he promised the Holy Ghost and I've got it so you just might as well get away from it because it's written in the word and every word is true then he left just give him the word that does it he can't stand the word for it's inspired amen so he said he said to it he said and he said and he promised the Holy Ghost and I got it so you might as well get away from it and so he began to take this message he says well what is the Holy Ghost and in approaching this I I I'd like to read these things and then we'll just preach a little bit on what's there you can always go get the message yourself and I encourage you that you do foreign he said upon this place we wish to her the scriptures we just read we wish to approach the subject which I was think is an outstanding subject today of the what is the Holy Spirit what is it and now the reason I have taken these subjects in line like this is you can't you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit and let you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you so that that's something you know what I mean you're not going to seek something you don't think's for you all right if this is for you and then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings now that's a great one isn't it you don't know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings back and so that's where so many people had got confused because different people started coming up with the different definitions of the results thus came the false doctrine that tongues was the evidence of the holy spirit that it it's uh in fact tongues is the least of all the gifts when you hear that somebody speaking in tongues you can know one thing they have a long ways to go because they're just at the bottom amen of course it's it it became to where it was a false Doctrine that's the the uh that's the evidence of it and so they people had to have that evidence because they they wanted to know what result it brings so how do I know I got the Holy Ghost okay did you speak in tongues and then they say well that's the result of the Holy Spirit do you think the holy spirit is so little that that's the result of it oh no it goes It goes beyond everything it's marvelous tell what it is so we're just going to run down and approach this research you've got to know you've got to know uh uh what results it brings and if you know what it is and who it's to and what action it brings when it comes then you'll know what you've got when you get it and then that settles it then you'll know what you got when you did it how many people have received the spirit of the Lord and they're still not sure whether they've got it Satan just continually uh Badgers you and Badgers you and because if you're not sure of it you won't use it is so we're just going to just take a little approach this morning the the way our our messenger I I took it and and so we know that uh with Abraham with Abraham Abraham is a type of the believer how many knows that in fact he's the father of our faith so when you see how God deals with Abraham you know that if God ever deals with one son he'll deal with that son always and so if he deals with that son the way he dealt with Abraham and what Abraham's righteousness was attributed to Abraham was his faith that he believed God in fact the fact that he told the king that his wife was a sister wasn't even held imputed to him it wasn't even held against them and he just didn't do it once he did it twice you understand but he he but what was righteous about Abraham was that he believed God he believed God I think there was just something in Abraham that down in his heart he was waiting on the Lord he knew that he knew oh I'm in trouble here and and I'm going to do this and I'm going to lie but I think in his heart he felt the Lord would get him out why because he had a covenant he had a promise and that's what was Imperial to Abraham for righteousness and so Abraham being a type of a Believer Abraham was told move out come out of your land come after me and I'm going to show you a land and your seeds gonna possess the land it's going to be like the stars in the in Abraham believed that and he came out of the land and then God gave him a sign of circumcision and that is a type of the Holy Spirit Coke and just look at each of us today as we just Fellowship around this in our lives right each of Our Lives Many of Us come from different places and different times in life I came out of the 60s so you know at that time hippie-ism and music and all that stuff was the thing that was gathering and collecting young people up and we all ran around with long hair and uh and now the only time you'll see long hair on somebody is is if they're in their 70s or something it's the whole style changed the whole music changed the whole look changed you know again it just something but but each of us in our life no matter where we were at in our life no matter where we come from whether or not you grew up in a Christian home you know Christians in a Christian home still have to have a Christian experience and so we find out that the that the he said so each of us no matter where we are living how deep in sin or how what we might call a little sin or not such a bad life it doesn't matter you understand when you're in sin you're away from God and so no matter where we were the the Spirit by the hearing of the word of God brought us under conviction and your heart was pricked and you felt condemnation that's what happened God convicted you and uh and so when when God convicted you and brought you under condemnation and you realized that that you're lost I'm lost I'm not going to go to heaven in the condition I'm in I'm separated from God a lot of us realize we didn't have any control over our lives Spirits were just running our lives I had a terrible terrible temper and if I mean if you popped my cork there was no telling what would take place okay it was it was terrible I I needed the help of the Lord and and I was Chained and bound with complexes and and all those things and then the spirit of the Lord by reading the Bible I read in Romans chapter one and when I heard it I I realized what condition I was in what group of people I was running with uh the crowd that I was was was hanging around with in the spirits that was around me was exactly what Paul describes as he went down through Romans 1 and I I wanted out I didn't want to go where that was going I didn't want to be the way that I was and and so that's what happened to all of us and we cried out unto the Lord and then the Lord made a covenant with us in in that that's what he did he made a covenant with each of us and so he made a covenant with you if you would repent and turn from your ways and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that I'll give you the Holy Spirit that's what he said so that was his promise that was his Covenant promised to the believer so to Abraham when heat came out of the land and he did what God said he was obedient he came out of the land God gave him a sign that he accepted Abraham's faith and he gave him the sign of circumcision so first thing we know what the holy spirit is it's a sign it's it's it's a a sign now and as we do this we've got to I'm going to read this statement he says now there is a vast difference between just a Christian and a holy ghost-filled Christian now this is good because we want to know what it is we want to I want to know I've got it I want to know what it does what action it brings he says between a holy ghost filled with us and now we're going to get this from the scriptures and place it just exactly in the scriptures the first place there is a Christian professed to be a Christian but if this Christian has not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost he's only in process of being a Christian there's nothing wrong with the process as long as you understand that there's no condemnation right you're in the process when I first became a Christian uh I you know I still had all my music I still had everything I believed in the Lord I wanted to be different right but it took me a while to to Really prove to the Lord that I really wanted to come out so you can profess and struggle you understand but as long as you're kind of running back and and going back in and out back and forth and traveling your professing you're believing unto you know what I mean but it could but there's there's something that's going to happen it's okay Abraham had to come out and when he came out then God accepted it it said but if a Christian has not yet been for the Holy Ghost he's only in the process of being a Christian see if he profess us to believe it he's working to it but God has yet to give him his Spirit of the Holy Ghost he's not yet reached that goal with God that God recognizes it well the thing about it is is God knows whether you're sincere or not he also knows when you're going to be sincere but you can't go you can't get rid of the labor process that's what they want to do today they don't want anybody doesn't want to go through to the labor to have a child you know what I mean they'll do anything to get out of it in fact they don't even want children nowadays I actually heard this with my own ears I couldn't believe it but look I heard several women says well we don't want to have children because I suffer with environmental stress I suffer with environmental anxiety I'm so worried about the environment I am so worried about the failure of of the stars in the moon and the air in the water that that I don't want to have children because I don't want them to bring them into a Dying World well how about a dying soul you know that's a Godless Society that thinks that this the water and and the wind I know one that's the master of the wind I know one that's the master of the sea I know one that will provide he can feed 12 000 with some fishes and some loaves I'm sure he can take care of me they eat that there he said that as we're reading he says because that God made a covenant with Abraham after he called Abraham which is a type of calling the believer today he called Abraham and Abraham moved out of his country and went into a Strange Land to dwell among strange people and that was a type of when God calls a man to stop his meanness repent of his sins he turns then from the crowd that he was in to live in a new crowd amongst the new type of people and then after God found Abraham to be faithful to the promise that God gave him that he would have a child and through this child all the Earth would be blessed then Abraham confirmed his faith by giving him a sign and that sign was circumcision and circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost so after the after you believed and you come out of the crowd and you you separated yourself now he's going to he promised you right if you repent and you're baptized that he would give you the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit is a uh is a a sign to you circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost and he gave Abraham's circumcision sign after he had accepted God on his promise and walked out into a strange country see and that's what God uses today it's a sign of circumcision of the heart the holy spirit that makes God's Church separated the church from all Creeds faiths denominations they're in all kinds of denominations but yet they are a separated people so the the holy the holy spirit is a sign to you it's the sign that God has accepted your sincerity and that you believe it's a promise and that you believe that he forgave you so if you believe that he forgave you so you're brought under conviction you're you're you you realize you're wrong you want to come out you you tell God that I'm sorry I want to be different but if you don't change anything if you if you you don't make no difference the Holy Spirit isn't an add to right that's what it is it's just not an attitude it's not something that you you use one is well we just keep going onwards it is so what what's it it it's a sign to the believer it's a distinction so what did what did circumcised decision to Duke to Abraham it was a sign that Abraham had this promise right now the promise was to him and do his seed so every offspring of Abraham cooked the sign of circumcision and that's what distinguished them and separated them from all the other peoples in the land was this Mark and that's what the holy spirit is it's the mark upon the believer that he's of God that he's not of this world in fact he's been separated out because that he's different it's a sign to you that's what he gives you if you've been sincere and you've been sincere and so don't don't try to take it into that if you don't accept it at its first level then you're wanting it to be something that is not that's the first thing that the Holy Spirit does it's a sign to you it's settled it's a sign it's a sign of separation your your spirit is now what different it's changed you you've got something now in your heart that makes you different it you're not you don't run with these people no more now the flesh is still Satan always is going to war against the flesh you're going to have that but you that he's given you something it's a sign to you that that that he's that that you've been separated that you're a distinct person that you know that you're different I'm just not what I used to be I've been changed I I I've caught this that something took place and and you you want to know something is not only assigned to you it's assigned to everybody else around you what happened to him he used to the scripture says he they think it's strange that you no longer run with them you no longer talk the way you talk if you no longer act the way that you act that you wanted to be different you wanted to be separated God called you he brought you under conviction he heard the word you answered that you said you were sorry you came out from amongst them you can you you you you you're not you don't go where they go you don't you stopped your meanness you stop those things and God looks upon you and you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you're sincere he promised you I'll give you my spirit I'll be with you even in you till the end so if you're battling within your sincerity and there's still things of the world you like then you can never come to the assurance that you have that indwelling spirit so what will happen is is that there's a compromise out there a false Revival that'll let the rain fall on the outside but it's not what's the desire of your heart and a Spirit-filled Christian is desire is to serve God to be free from the world to be free from the sins of the world to be free from anger and bitterness and talking and backbiting and all those ungodly things and christ-like things you have such a desire for it that you're longing for it you're longing to have that right spirit and when when that's really there so what happened to the world that they they people didn't want to give all of their life to Christ so they gave them a false sign of speaking in tongues but the real spirit is assigned to the believer that God has accepted your faith and accepted your call and accepted your desire hey amen oh it's just it's wonderful but what else is it it's a seal okay so when you when you when you have the Holy Spirit if it's a seal and I hope this morning by talking about it if you you say well I don't have that then you will say I want it and then you know the formula to get it repent be baptized in the name Lord Jesus Christ you say well I have done that that then then follow the rest of it separate yourself circumcise your life cut away the world when you do that that was the process then you can number yourself amongst the separated and he will give you his spirit you say well I want a sensation I'll tell you if I lose the desire for something that's entangled me for years and years I know that ain't me so it's a seal like Ephesians 4 30 says it says grief not the Holy Spirit where you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption so what is it if it's God letting you know that it's a finished work in other words nothing's going to pluck you out of the palm of my hand no that's that's not talking about knowing it in a you know that bears witness with your spirit that it's finished the work is finished it's over I'm saved I'm Glory bound I'm going to heaven I've been purchased the spirit is a seal that bears Witness that he's accepted you and sealed you which means it sent you to your destination we know our messenger uses the rail car he says when that car is ready to be shipped to its destination that there's a seal to put on it that uh that lets them know that this is where it's going and nothing can stop it from going there it won't be opened but he makes this this statement and I thought this was good he says notice how long does that seal last not until the next Revival until the next time something goes wrong until the day of your Redemption that's how long you're sealed until the day of your Redemption when you are redeemed up in to be with God that's how long the Holy Spirit seals you in other words I will not leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you till the end that's what it is so when you have the spirit you have the witness of God's word in your heart nobody's going to rob that but he says here's what happens he says that's what's the matter we don't get sealed so much we're too loose about things when the inspector goes through to inspect your life to see if you're you're not just a little loose about things a little loose about your prayer life a little loose about your temper a little loose about the tongue to talk about others uh He he'll never seal the car some dirty habit some vile things some Bulgarian mind he can't seal the car but when he's found everything in its in its place the inspector then he seals it dare anybody open that seal till that car reaches its destination to where it's sealed for there it is touch not mine anointed doomed by prophets no harm for I say unto you could be better for a millstone to be hanged about your neck then and you were drowned in the depths of the sea then tried to offend or shake a little one of the least of these that's been sealed you see what it means it's a seal so you're saying what is the holy spirit these are the things he gives you we want a sensation but it's it it it's a uh it's a seal that that that lets you know that uh it it it lets you know the work's over I've done the work I've accepted your faith you've you can't get a pardon tell you what accept it so I I've received the pardon you can't be sealed if you're still not sure he forgave you and if you're not sure he forgave you it's because you don't believe his word he said if you confess your sins I'm faithful and just to forgive them we're talking about how do I know I have the Holy Spirit Well if you know you've been forgiven and you know your life's not the same and you know your desires have been changed you know you're not the person that there's been a nature change in you you've received the you've received that sign from God because then now there's a different Spirit In You you didn't make that Spirit up you all of a sudden didn't go sit down with Zig Ziglar and come out and and now you've got a new attitude on life no something changed you something came in you God did something in your heart and there's a and we'll bring this we'll just talk on this so it is it's it's a comfort that's what he is he's a comforter you're you're at rest you understand you've put the question of where you're going behind you you you it so you you've entered into the rest because you know he's with you and you talk to someone that's that they they know they've got that peace that that Blessed assurance that comfort they they know that God's done something for him okay and there there no they know they're Heaven bound because they know that he redeemed them and they've entered into that rest and and they know he's with you and you he you know he promised I'll never leave you nor nor forsake you okay and that if he started the work in you he'll finish it you could say I'm not perfect Lord I'm growing but I know you're with me I have the comfort you won't forsake me that's the Holy Spirit that's the spirit of God that's doing that that's his presence because that's giving you that comfort that's giving you that assurance why people get well they'll they'll get like signing one to come in and buy the gifts I want this power how can I get it here how about a few G's okay that's what he Peter told me he said you need to repent what did he do he put him right back into the process you need to come out from all that thinking you need to come out from all that you need to repent you need to get your heart right you need to separate from the things of the world if you do those things you will receive the holy spirit because it's a covenant promise [Music] but God gives you a peace that's her path's understanding and all of a sudden that's not the spirit of God he gives you a a seal that you know you're Heaven bound you know where you're going praise God I'm on my way to Glory the storms don't matter because the sickness doesn't matter the trials don't matter it doesn't matter I'm Heaven bound praise God I've got a kingdom waiting I've Got a Mansion waiting for me I'm going to Glory what's that what is that seal the holy spirit's a seal because the seal the believer knows I've been sealed in my heart that I'm I'm going to Glory I've been purchased with the price a guy said on the the rail I'm going you say what ends if the car Falls over you know what happens if the car Falls over he writes it back up he repacks it and he puts it together because nothing can break that seal hey man if I started a work I'll finish it saith the Lord my sheep hear my voice I cut another they won't fall if if it's it's it's your it's your assurance that Spirit when you have the Holy Spirit it's an assurance there's no doubt I I know he paid my price for my sins I'm assured of it everybody's taught it like it's going to make you some side some sort of uh Maestro wizard that's gonna zap people no it's a piece that's her path to understanding it's a joy unspeakable full of Glory it's his spirit that gives you a sign and the world a sign that gives you the sign you're separated and it gives the world a sign you're separated it's a seal that you know that he's got you in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand does it mean Satan won't lie to you no Satan no lie all the more does that mean Satan won't tempt you no he'll tempt you all the more does it mean your strength is in your flesh no your flesh is weaker than it's ever been but it's not my spirit not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord can you know you have this assurance you know you have this peace you know you've been called out you know you've been made different you know you're different than the world you know where you're going how many no's were there going is there a question in your life whether you're going to heaven or hell or not didn't he say if you were faithful and just to confess your sins that he'd be faithful and just to forgive them and that he would wipe away all your iniquities that what the holy spirit is when you've got that Blessed assurance when you've got that peace that's your path's understanding you've got that Joy you say well I I get I get down yeah well you want to know something I've been down to but there's something in there that keeps twinkling yeah one day I'm gonna come out of this deep depression one day I'm going to come out of this sickness because even if this sickness takes me I'm Bound for heaven oh if this body get destroyed I have one waiting for me that's the spirit that's the Holy Spirit I would rather have that than all

remembrance of everything the word says you ever have that where something comes up and all of a sudden that word of God will pop in your mind or you'll think about a scripture who is that who's

what did he come in you for what did he come in me for was to continue the works of God amen so when when the father sent Jesus right what did he do he put his spirit in him and then Jesus said I don't do nothing till the father shows me I only speak those things with the father tells me to speak why because God was sending him so he put his spirit in him if if you're if you you if you don't

what about jairus's daughter they're all boohoo and they mocking him he says oh she's sleepeth oh he's crazy doesn't he know she did enough she sleeps you know why because he knew her name was written on the land of life he knew I am the resurrection and the life he knew he had power over death hell in the grave he knew what he was he knew what it was that God gave him and what God put in him and that's what our promise Was the Same Spirit that was in him would dwell in us and if that same spirit that dwelt in him dwells in us it will also Quicken our mortal bodies and the works that I do shall you do also you look at the works of the Lord it never was in no great big fantastic shouting showing the band wasn't playing and the people weren't screaming up and down the street no he did every work he did in the midst of unbelief but he was a conqueror conquered it he didn't care about the unbelief he didn't care about the odds he cared about one thing I am the resurrection and the

you the holy spirit is Jesus Christ in you it's the spirit of Jesus Christ in you so exactly what it is people who want to know what's the Holy Spirit what's the holy spirit it's the spirit of Jesus Christ in you exactly what it is it'll never change it'll never be different it's him if it's always him and what was he so if we're going to continue the works he did we got to know his works the man that was chained he was so full of demons that all they could do was chain them with chains and they put them in the graveyard and everybody that came near him that didn't know he was in there he would pounce on one day Jesus walked by oh so here he come he thinks he's going to pounce everybody stand back on me and he's walking right down that road by that Cemetery down there where that demon

wool whole weekly talk about the woman at the well we could talk about the woman at the blood issue we can talk about all those things what is it it's the mighty conqueror it's the one who conquered hell death in the grave that was his Spirit when he came he came back to redeem Adam's Fallen race he came back to redeem every single one of us that was born in sin shaped in iniquity who had the spirit in US of our first husband which was our birth through sex by Adam and he come to take that Stony heart out of us and replace it with a heart of Flesh he come to change that nature that we had and replace it with his nature he said if you can do all signs and wonders and speak with tongues and have all the gifts and you have not loved it profiteth you nothing you say can people do all these things and and have these gifts and signs and do all these things and not have him in his heart yes because the rain falls on the just in the end yet I'm not worried about the unjust I just want my heart right I want him in my heart I want the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the spirit of Jesus Christ coming into my life the prophet of God said the mystery of this age was receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit without sensation how do you know you've got it because you know what action it brings you know if you're turning the other Chief do you know if you believe the word of God you know if there's forgiveness in your heart you know if there's compassion and competing you know if you're the Good Samaritan or the Scribe or the Pharisee that drives by you know that by the love of God that shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit what was Jesus he was the love of God God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son whoever believeth him he shall give them power to become the Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah think of it it's him and you believing his word that's what got lost that's what he told them he says go wait in the upper room in Terry until you're endued with power from on high well when they came out of there that day they began to preach what do they preach they preach Jesus Christ o men and Brethren this same Jesus whom we call Lord and Savior you did crucify you hung them but this was The Lord Of Glory and they were pricked in their heart and they said what must we do they said repent we baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and you shall receive his Spirit In You the gift of the Holy Spirit Christ in you when he found those guys they didn't even know whether there was such Holy Spirit he said how are you baptized we are baptized under repentance so they were doing the works under the spirit of repentance and Paul brought him and brought him into the liberty of the spirit where we're set free how why are you set free because you know he's with you you know I think sometimes we've just like the lamb and the dove he's been with us but we just kind of been getting loose and getting away and he's just got to wait he's got to step back he can't go with you there but he'll start getting that word working he'll start sending those hound dogs to Hell after you he'll start creating that desperation it won't be long you'll be right back crying for Him Father come back to me restore me I got away from you I'm not letting you live in my heart the way that I ought to let you live in your heart okay I've grieved the Holy Spirit come back lord I want to be in fellowship with you forgive me forgive me you know what he said in no wise will he turn you away he'll be faithful and just behold I stand at the door and knock why look someplace else for him when he's right here what happened to the church it it got away from him it just it just it got a it it just got so far away to where they they no longer they wanted the knowledge but they didn't want the life they wanted to know about him and talk about him but they didn't want him so what did they do they put him on the outside of the church and he's knocking to get in and he said If any man will open the door I will come into him and I will sup with him I will feed him the evening meal I'll commune with him I'll make things right I'll straighten out your life I'll deliver you from the problems you've got in I'm an advocate I'm your protector I'm your seal I I it's me the one who died for you it's me I'm here to be with you even in you I mean I'd like to just close when reading these statements the church got away from it so till all the tables we're filled with vomit you couldn't find the Life of Christ anywhere the ministry had turned in no longer being servants but lording over God's Heritage the Nickelodeon Spirit was raging everything was about bigger this bigger that money this money that man teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men they got away from the word but there was a promise to God's seed I will restore saith the Lord all that the Palmer on the canker worm the caterpillar butterfly and I'll restore everything that was lost but first the seed has got to go back into the ground and when it goes back in the ground it'll start coming up again so I'm going to read these thought last thoughts to you this morning he said little babies say well I go to the church my mama belonged to this church I have nothing against that dear brother and I realize this is being taped that's all right belonging to Mama's church but listen Mama walked in one light you're walking in another Luther walked in one light Wesley walked in another Wesley walked in one light Pentecost walked in another but were walking on higher than that today and if there's another generation it'll go beyond us who is that other generation you are then come along he said back in the early days when things were wide way wide Luther taught justification by faith that was just to bring the people from Catholicism to protestantism so he said in the beginning it was real wide justification was a real wide sweep it was a real white sweep he said and he says into the fellowship around the word justification by faith that was a big wide sphere and they never moved from that and Along come another revile Revival called John Wesley it shook them down from that and brought her down to sanctification live good clean holy lives Sanctified by the word of God give joy in your heart that shook off a lot of the Lutheran Doctrine then Along Came Pentecost with baptism of the Holy Ghost and narrowed it down again by receiving the Holy Ghost that's right and now that's been shaken down and the gifts and the restoration and the spirit of God has come in in the fullness of signs and wonders into the church and has shook Pentecost what is it we're so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus until the very spirit that was in him is working in the church doing the same things that he did what is the holy spirit it's the same spirit that was in him for what that the church can continue the works who who is the church somebody ought to stand up and say I am I'm the church I'm going to do the works it's in me if the same spirit that was it was in Christ dwell within me it's going to Quicken my mortal body he didn't say he was going to Quicken the church he said he would Quicken you make it personal make it personal you know if you have the spirit of the Lord he said and when he was here on Earth he never been anywhere back from the time of the Apostles till this time why see it's wide Narrows Narrows Narrows what is it just like your hand coming to a shadow the negative the negative the negative well what is it it's a reflection what was Luther a reflection of Christ what was Wesley a reflection a reflection of Christ he says now the holy spirit of God has worked under justification Luther under sanctification Wesley the baptism of the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and here it is in the last day performing and doing the very same thing that it did when it was in Christ what is it the church and Christ has become one and as soon as they connect together the last link shall grow through the sky shouting up will come Wesley Luther and the rest of them back there in their days he'll that's first will be last and the last will be first and there will come the resurrection what we're at the time listen that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost by justification just a light shadow of it the Holy Ghost by sanctification a deeper shadow of it the Holy Ghost by the baptism of it a deeper shadow of it but now the Holy Ghost by the restoration of its very person being in here forming and sign in wonders like he did at the beginning Glory you can call me a Holy Roller anyhow you might as well get started now Hallelujah we're not going backwards those are just Shadows with shadows just think everything that Pentecost was it was annoying if it was a restoration of gifts but this is Christ in you this is the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride this is the age where the where where the church the Bride In Christ become one they become the same thing that's what the holy spirit is it's him in you continuing the works the church got away from that it went into the ground but you hear what he said by restoration he sent the ministry of restoration not to bring us to a lesser light or a light of an age come by but to mature us by sitting in the ripening of the Sun by setting under the word of God to bring us to where that very Spirit of Christ is in US herein is the love of God made perfect that as he is so are we in this world the Capstone how is the Capstone made perfect because as he was so are we in this world what is the Holy Spirit it's the spirit of Jesus Christ in you continuing the works that he did making you a mighty conqueror the question is do you believe he can do that in you as I was listening brother Ben was telling the story when he got married he'd been his wife had died five years and sister meaty the Lord dealt with her heart and the Lord dealt with brother Bam's heart and they became married and they were up on a uh that the honeymoon trip we always called that a hunting Moon and you know the story how he got up hunting he thought he'd go get so they they'd set up a little lean to him by the cabin and the ranger is going to come up and open up the cabin and then they would spend the night in the cabin and then he would hunt and and uh so he thought he'd go out and get a little meat so they could have some venison to cook and Hunt called Camp meat and he got up there and he got lost and he said you know I thought I was a Woodsman he said my mama's happy Indian and and he said I love the woods and I love nature and I love being outside he said my conversion never took that from me and he said but I got lost I didn't think I could get lost oh I started out I know where I'm going he said he kept coming back to his deer and finally he just put it all together in his mind and he said I'm I'm going this way he said Alice marching straight for Canada he said I never made it he said but I felt a hand come on my shoulder and turn me around he said I stopped and thought what was it snow what it was he said I felt that hand turned me around he said I turned around and all of a sudden the clouds opened up and I saw that mountain I was going the opposite way and he said I just started that way as hard as I could he said I knew I ran a phone line from that Tower to my cabin and if I could just cut across there and get that phone line so he put his hand up and he walked with his hand up thanking the lord praising God I know that lifeline's there I know that Lifeline there I'm trying to tell you today there's a Lifeline for your life he's the mighty conqueror I don't care what you're bound by alcoholism cigarettes drugs spirits in the flesh depression or whatever it is there's a lifeline so that leads to life and he just put his hand up and kept going until he finally grabbed a hold of it and he knew once he grabbed that line he had the Assurance he was going to take him there it was a sign that he was on the right way it was a seal that he knew were the end of the journey was going to take him it was an assurance to him that he was no longer lost he knew where he was it was a protection as long as he held on to it he would not go astray it was his Advocate it made all the wrongs and wrong turns he did right it made everything they failed in every false Trail he took it was already now because he had a hold of the lifeline to what is the Holy Spirit it's our lifeline it's our life It's Our Hope it is everything that we need because it's him I will come again and I will be with you and I will be in you till the end and he held on to that line but now that line holds on to us nothing will pluck you from the palm of our hand we just need to turn our hearts back to him letting him Unite with us until we know it's him in US Jesus says it's not I that does the work it's the father that does the works in me you're not going to say this day it's not by our power and not by our might but it's by his spirit in US that we can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens us it's him he's the only hope of glory what is the holy spirit it's the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ giving him the power to do the works that same Spirit comes back onto the believer and dwells in you and if that Spirit dwells in you as it quickened his mortal body so will it also Quicken your mortal bodies you're the conquerors today it's him in you on the Earth today doing the same works that he did through you his bride His Image in Bride form today with the same power that raised him from the dead living in you aren't you glad for that you say can I do all things I can do all things through Christ the holy spirit that strengthens me can I pray for the sick I can pray through the sick through Christ Jesus who is in me and strengthens me it's not I that does the work it's Christ in me that
