Description:
Youth With Passion: Youth On Fire
Br. John Andes
Saturday Evening Service 
May 15,  2021 
CLT Annual Youth Meetings
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

========================================
[Music] [Music] you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen happy to be in the house of the lord tonight or would you rather be in bed amen we see that there's still some that are struggling to get here that we had a nice time at the gym i i really thought uh brother trevor did a wonderful job amen you'd enjoy that today uh one of the uh little girls that are staying at my house said that that was her favorite preacher and and just uh she said that she'd like to hear him again and she'd like for me to have him again so i thought that was good now not that she wasn't prejudiced a little bit but what can you say it's good to be your favorite you know so that that's really wonderful so i really wanted to thank brother trevor i thought he did a really good job let's give him another have your wife stand up [Applause] so that is who makes trevor what that he is so we're certainly grateful for that i'd like to also uh before we start service of you know thank everybody that helped with the today with the meals and some help financially others cooked and everything but they put a lot of great uh effort into it so we really thank them for all that they did we also uh like to thank billy and and matthew and andrew of they're the ones that put this meeting together i've hardly raised a finger in the whole thing in fact i didn't even raise any fingers so they did it all and they did a wonderful job so we certainly like to thank them for all the work that they've uh put into the meeting amen and also there's quite a few uh in our church here that are graduating so i don't know if all the people that's in our congregation here locally that are graduating this time would you stand up there's supposed to be nine of you so anyway are you there you go so that's three so that means six of the people that oh four that's it so if you find out who the other five are and let me know okay okay well thank you and then wait a minute stay standing all the anybody else from any other place that's visiting that's graduating is anybody else visually or a couple over here all righty amen thank you very much thank you all right um anybody that dropped out as any any dropouts so there is hope for dropouts amen but we really uh we we really uh appreciate the effort that it took for you to put forth to graduate and of course all of you that homeschooled i know you graduated at the top of your class and i think that's wonderful but uh lord richly bless you this is kind of a graduation weekend across the country but um this was the weekend that we could get brother john so we took it i know there's other people that are graduating in the marriage across the country this weekend too so we certainly congratulate them before we start service i'd just like to say a few things to our young people here that we have this meeting for our young people plus inviting their friends and fellowship around the word of the lord but we we spoke a scripture out of mark which we refer to as the great commission and brother branham said these words in a message called the influence of another he says what the church needs tonight is first to be reverent next thing to be humble then get yourself in action yes sir and you know no army ever will be able to sustain itself without new recruits the very law of attrition and the very [Music] effects of battle will cause an army to deplete itself and to diminish just by time itself and if there isn't new recruits or new people entering the battle their numbers cease and we have a day that the enemy is growing larger and larger by the day he's come to the place where he's now taking over the conversation of the country politically educationally and everything and if there's ever an hour that we need people to join in the commission and that's what i wanted for our young people here that this weekend would put a burden on your heart to take up the commission we need people that pray for the sick we need people that go into all the world and witness this gospel the enemy has moving down in its rank for to younger and younger and younger ages he's attacking and there's no way now that we can cover all the ground that needs to be covered the harvest is great but the laborers are few and after this weekend i hope especially the people that are fellowshipping here and laboring in this part of the country and our young people that you'll feel a burden on your heart to go into all the world to go into your world the people that you come and contact the people that you know and so let your light shine amongst men that your good works might glorify that your father in heaven so i hope to the young people here the the ones that labor here i hope that this weekend stirs your heart to get into action and that you will take up your cross that you'll follow him and that you'll become ministers of this gospel to your friends to your loved ones to your homes to all your workplaces and everybody that you come in to contact with so let's just stand together as we say a word of prayer and turn the service over to brother billy but i hope that this service tonight will set your hearts on flame to be a great warrior for it they once again they have some sandwiches planned for you for after service and so we'd like to say that first of all we'd like all our guests and young people first our guests in our chaperones and our visitors to be the first to eat and then after that what's ever left over is for the local people because they can always go home i don't mean local like like like a local cabeza

old soldier to stand with you and to relieve you and to carry on the fight [Music] and as you get weary i'm strong and young and i'm here to carry the battle to the enemy father we're here today to

tonight i already see some of you yawning amen my lord help us jesus have you ever heard of the jericho march so if we if anybody starts falling asleep we might do a jericho march we'll just move these chairs and we'll do a jericho march and then just keep on going what do you all say all right what does that amen mean does that mean we're not going to fall asleep i just pray the fire of the holy ghost come in this place and hallelujah hallelujah somebody that's really in love you want to be with them hallelujah brother jackson might have to pass out toothpicks for tomorrow morning i heard some of you stayed up till two in the morning or something you all must really like one another i'm finding out some of you love one another i was a little offended today you know i love brother saunders over here and he flew all the way from phoenix and isn't that wonderful and i was talking to him today i thought my he really enjoys us to come and hear us and he's a wonderful friend then i find out later i'm nobody to brother saunder i'm kind of like way down the line somewhere there was somebody else he came here for and i'm i'm like oh i see i get it all right all right brother saunders i love you too brother hallelujah there's nothing wrong with these things fall in love with jesus and he'll seek first the kingdom of god and all his righteousness and may he add tonight to you tonight we're speaking on youth with passion and youth on fire and i know we have several hundred here but there's a lot more that are streaming tonight and we heard right after the service from africa and new zealand and there's a lot of people that are streaming these meetings there's a lot of hunger globally for what god's doing and i found out there's young people and believers all over the world they they can't gather together like this some of them are locked down they don't have the opportunity and they just want to be with you and i think that's wonderful we can't see them but they can see you so just i want every person to understand that there's needs in this building but there's also needs around the world and god could lay it on somebody's heart just to be tapped in tonight and can we include them and just say god minister to them talk to them along the road may our hearts burn within us youth with passion and youth on fire acts chapter 1 is the acts of the holy spirit and what he was working in verse 1 it was the apostle luke that wrote this he was a physician acts 1 1 did i say something else did i say another chapter okay acts 1 1 this was luke that wrote this that's why he said the former treatise have i made o theophilus theophilus was thought to be a roman man he was writing of all that jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he threw the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom to the apostles also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god now i believe the lord had this weekend pre-planned and uh yet last night yesterday happened to be the 40th day from easter till last night this is saturday so if we would go back 2 000 years ago we're all in the upper room let's call ourselves upper room youth tonight can we do that you know the superstar ascended up into heaven on the 40th day and here here we all are is us but he promised he'd come back so here we're the upper room youth and on verse 3 it talks about his passion now tonight this is going to be something you've just i'm going to turn it for you and it's going to be a different kind of passion maybe you you know maybe you've never heard it like this before but jesus went through his passion the time of that week and when we speak about youth with passion it's different than maybe what might be in your mind right now so hold this in your thought verse 4 and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait let's all say wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john john the baptist truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons whom the father hath put in his own power his own power but ye shall receive power now this is a young people's weekend and so i'm focusing our attention and our focus on you not one amen hallelujah so i know there's older ones and there's helpers and there's different ones that have made it possible and are we thankful for that pastor david mcgarry sister leslie the assembly and the workers some are right behind me tonight brother trevor spoke but this is for the young people ye shall receive dynamics the dynamo after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and in dallas and in new york in phoenix arizona hallelujah and in africa and china and india and under the uttermost part of the earth is that okay hope i'm not adding to the word but when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight my who would have liked to have been there and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel we're all looking up in the sky saying where's jesus we need jesus we where are you going and these angels said unto him ye men of galilee why stand you gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven so what did these believers do after jesus said go and wait and tarry verse 12 they went into jerusalem and they waited on the lord for how many days does anybody know bible trivia he went up 40 days how many days did they wait in the upper room 10 days hallelujah they waited and they tarried god bless you you can have your seats tonight there's no need to wait there's no need to tarry the tearing days are over so let's be upper room youth that can recognize this is our day this is our hour i shared my title with a pastor in europe this afternoon and he said we pray that it would be more than a sermon that the lord would make this a reality and we're in this room here tonight in bedford dallas fort worth texas but i pray the holy ghost would come and fill all of us hallelujah we're living in another book of acts you are youth with passion and your youth on fire say well i don't feel it i don't see it i don't know about it but you just let a good fire take place you get around somebody that's on fire just get it close to him you're right where you need to be tonight might you might not even know what's happening to you you might not even be in the spirit but you're in the right place for that fire just to consume you and you don't even know what's happening the bible says while they yet heard the word they were filled with the holy ghost there's other times in the book of acts they laid hands on them and they were filled with the holy ghost it doesn't matter how you receive the holy ghost but i want to be filled with the holy ghost and i believe you can be healed sitting right in your seat i believe demon spirits can be cast out of you while you hear the word there's some people that talk bad about young people's meetings and gatherings let me just share with you what a prophet said is that okay last night we spoke on lord remember me he said this in phoenix in remembering the lord he said he had just heard a young man preach there in uh the phoenix meetings and he said that certain young man got up and was talking about the young people's rally see back in the 60s they called them rallies youth rallies we have young people's meetings or meetings for the youth and brother branham said the young man was talking about the young people's rally and i told my daughter now brother branham was a father and he had uh children and one of them was rebecca she was a teenager and she was in the meetings and brother branham told his daughter said now you want to make it your business to get in there he's talking about the youth rally the youth meetings make it your business so don't be down at the mall don't be you know at starbucks don't make it a social media night i'm kinda sick well now make it your business to be in the youth meeting but she said maybe what we've all felt things like i don't know nobody in there you know it's kind of a strange place it's a different church and different things you know i don't know nobody in there i said you'll know somebody or somebody will know you just go on in anyhow say well nobody knows me but somebody might know you well the lord knows you just go on in there then he said this he said i'm praying that she receives the baptism of the holy ghost during this rally up there so brother branham supported youth meetings he loved youth meetings and then is that that was early in 63 before um february and then march you remember the sword came down in brother branham's hand there was a great blast in the mountain how many remember that my brother daniel andes is in tucson and he was just there today i got photos of him there on pulpit rock there where the sword came down and so just a few months after that in june uh rebecca and one of her friends i think her name was marilyn was graduating and so they had brother branham come and speak like to some young people and uh this is an amazing quote because it really ties back to to tonight brother branham is praying on june the 1st 1963 and he said lord jesus we are grateful for this time and and we're grateful we know that we're assembled here the young and the old and the middle aged and we have assembled this side of eternity once more to speak about you and about the things that pertains to everlasting life and these young ones sitting in here tonight some of them are graduating some have already graduated but i realize lord he's praying i realize lord something that happened just a few hours before that great shock or that great blast had taken place in the mountain north of tucson when the angels of the lord came down i remember what was said and especially about the young people incredible we talk about the seals the third pool the mysteries of god and brother branham is talking to young people and remembering when that great shock and blast happen now he's talking about when the angels came to him i remember what was said and especially about the young people i pray thee lord to help us to understand and may i be able to say something to these young folks tonight that will help them along the journey for lord we all need help at this time so he's talking to young people we're going to have a jericho march be careful here i'm serious we can move eight chairs in two seconds and we can all be so stay with us tonight a prophet is remembering what happened in the mountain and what was said about young people i'd like to know what was said about young people i'd like to know what god has for for this generation so tonight let's just go right away in acts chapter one here back to verse three this service tonight is just for you but i want to come from another a perspective and that is verse 3 when jesus was showing himself alive to his disciples acts one verse three he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days jesus had walked through a week of passion the greatest week of all the year and that was easter is coming [Music] you know when we talk about passion youth with passion and youth on fire sometimes the word passion it would come into your mind and especially today it's thought of so many different things your mind could be going in a lot of directions about fire and about passion passion has to do a strong desire and it has to do with fire that has strong urges i'm speaking to adults tonight young adults and young people youth with passion that means they are fervent they are ardent they are zealous when we speak about youth with passion you're you're obsessive and you're not normal anybody wanna anybody wanna join the club amen they were gathered in one mine and one accord we can't be looking around talking about each other's sandals and our hair amen oh lord it's in the fire just now upon all of us just y'all are sitting really nice you know really comfortable but if the fire alarm would go off here fire we would get your attention that would arouse you but we're talking about when a person has passion that they are obsessive they have spiritual desire and a hunger spiritual thirst and an appetite and a craving for more of god not just for more meaning they don't have it they want more of what they got when we read the book of acts and we hear what a prophet said about this end time that my i have so many things in front of me we won't even have time to share but there are promises that lay in the word for the end time and there will be people alive and remain to the coming of the lord and i don't believe they're going to be backslidden and half in the world there's going to be some youth that have some passion they're on fire do we all believe that tonight so passion tonight is not for sinful worldly things i'm moving some of your thoughts away from from that that thing that would be sinful or worldly but passion for christ passion for god fire of the holy ghost put that in me lord put something in me it's kind of like a person that has drink uh drunk a lot all right and they're they're totally uh drunk they're sauced and you talk about them you tell jokes about them and they're just falling on the ground and they're buying everybody drinks and they just want to share and they're happy you know and they they they just you know go out they just go out and you kick them you kick them no response i mean they're totally under the influence that's what i'm talking about youth with passion and youth on fire and i'm going to get into it just a little bit later but we are going to be passionate for christ in spite of our failures in spite of your past you will be passionate and if you're not tonight we're just gonna give you some time like jesus gave peter and thomas and all the disciples that ran in the garden they were cowards and the scripture we read tonight was a bunch of people in a room that were cowards they were afraid but you just give them a few days [Music] now peter was cussing and swearing and saying i don't even know the man but you just give him a few days [Applause] thomas was saying well unless i put my hands in his side and unless i see his nail prints just give him a few days don't you worry sister don't you worry brother jesus is going to appear to you [Applause] hallelujah say well i'm not going to move you know i'm not gonna move i'm not gonna respond i'm not gonna you just let somebody put fire under that person but you put a willingness in a person to say lord whatever you say and whatever you do i want to move now that's god changing our attitude he's already changed some of your attitude in the last five minutes because i said passion and you already down some other trail somewhere that's just what the world has done to all of us brother branham said every generation is 10 times worse how many know he said that brother john had that on my uh wall of my office um so that i saw it every day that our children have it 10 times worse than we ever had so we have to have respect for one another and recognize that every generation has it 10 times worse and brother john was young before and we've had three children and now we have three grandchildren that if my children had it ten times worse my grandchildren gonna have it ten times worth that's a hundred times more so i have a lot of respect for you tonight i mean brother billy brother andrew brother steve brother matthew our our ministry and leaders here brother david and brother trevor and anyone that works with young people it should always be with whatever we got to do to reach their heart and i don't believe in beating the turtle i don't believe in beating the turtle with sticks and throwing it in the in the river to try to get him to move i believe a real fire of god will cause anybody to move but you know what's really up to us you older ones if you've been there and done that well let's show that by having some pull tonight and having some fire ourselves let's give the new generation young people something that they want what we got not be a dead church you want passion well it's got to take some things to get there hallelujah if you want to see the fire of god move and the breath of god and see people under the impact of the holy ghost that's not just always everybody doing what they want to do and then oh wow at the end it's just going to explode i want it to be real on monday tuesday next wednesday wherever you go and wherever you're going gonna be i'll be in another state preaching for somebody else but i want you to have something that you can have that's real do you want that so let's look in acts chapter 1. you can put that back up brother parks thank you for working with us tonight to whom also acts 1 verse 3 he showed himself alive after his passion the only time this word in the english is in the whole bible in the greek and hebrew it's also mentioned but this word passion has to do with his suffering he was afflicted he was vexed he felt the pain i'm going back to a week of of his passion that you know mel gibson made a big movie about in hollywood of the passion and that was just the inspiration that someone in the world that's not even a believer tapped into that even people in the world can cry and get all emotional about but if you and i are the bride of christ we've got to go deeper than that what did that passion do for mel gibson what did it do for hollywood i don't really care whether you saw the movie or not it doesn't matter we need to see the same lord jesus in our day he went through a time of passion so young people tonight being raised in a very soft soap easy age social media and a world that is just not even real it's fake trying to grab our hearts you're being introduced to another passion and that is jesus after his passion and after his suffering he was afflicted he was vexed he felt the pain he experienced it that week are we all together he underwent this episode for you in mind he was torn apart and blood and i could have started that way tonight the blood and the screaming and them ripping off his garment and now he's all his friends are gone and they put a crown of thorns on his head and they hit on the thorns that drove down into his brain they spit on him some of us can't even hardly take a text or an email we get all bent out of shape they spit on him they railed him they accused him of things if you're the christ all these things and now it's come down to them taking off his coat and now there's that man that was trained that roman to give him whips on his back it was for criminals does anybody know how many stripes he received for you 40 save one 39 and they were trained they were trained to rip apart the flesh and go down to the bones and the roman that was trained like that had done it many times and as he's whipped on jesus and took that whip upon his back right up from the top of his head it would come down and just strip anybody have ever had back problems nerve problems sciatic nerve whatever it has no it's not even a touch to what jesus went through blood's going everywhere this is jesus going through passion and we want our massages and we want our spas and we want an easy life and we want to go to college and we want to make the six figures and we want all this and that's not bad i'm not speaking about our easy life we live in america and some of you have come from uh africa and other places america the land of the free home of the brave here we are in the lone star state tonight where the flag is flying and we're able to have a service and not social distance and have a lot of masks and one year ago this would have never happened hello everybody wake up we're living in another season we're living in another time and daniel said it is god that's in charge of the seasons it's god's that's in charge of the times this is another season and what's happening globally in the young people the message is this is the time of another wave this is another surge the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost and fell on many of your parents and many of you that are in the back of the room or could be streaming that surge of the holy ghost that move of the holy ghost that brought them out of the world and transformed their lives that wave brother billy is happening in the message globally right now hello we still want it easy you know we just want to we just want it easy though brother john no passion is different than just some pleasure it's more than satisfying yourself or going to a party where you can satisfy somebody else or get satisfied i'm just going to go there bisexual things of this world the sin in the garden has become the sin at the end and if you don't get what she got in the garden it'll just tantalize you and play with your mind and torment your spirit i'm speaking about youth with passion and youth that are on fire for god they desire the word of god but it was sad when he was beaten when he was torn when he was bleeding and he bore your shame he bore your sin and he felt every single pain and suffering can anybody say thank you jesus my brother trevor if we had a little video cam into that place where now we're just focusing in on the soldier and jesus is just now it's 30 31 32. now there's blood everywhere now there's blood all over the ground there's blood on the roman soldier it's getting on his garment it's it's getting on everything and and he felt no virtue this was his job this is what he did for a living and when it got to 39 times he just you know washed his hands you know and went home to his wife and put his garment up there there was no power in him there was no virtue brother steve and that roman soldier he didn't realize what he was doing in those last few minutes of that through that action there was going to be a group of believers there might be somebody here tonight that isaiah said by his stripes [Applause] by his stripes you are healed does somebody need healing tonight that same jesus has already healed you that roman soldier felt no virtue no power thank you lord there was no faith in him to touch the hymn of his garment and be healed it's your approach it's the atmosphere's got to be right everything's got to be ready i'm going to say it again by his stripes you are healed you can be standing right in the same room and not feel anything and somebody else is just trembling just trembling it's just coming from the top of their head to their bottom of their feet that's a believer that's youth with passion that's youth that's on fire lord may that happen tonight in the week of your passion you bore this let there be somebody tonight in this time of this service realize that our spiritual lives with christ isn't all fun and games it's not looking to the next vacation or the semester getting a degree or getting married that should consume us tonight we're consumed with god and if you're not lord consume us then consume me lord hallelujah we're not passing around alcohol tonight we're not giving out free beers we're not on netflix right now i know some of you are struggling but you got to enter into it you know you could be laying over to the side and and you don't realize that it's just in the next few seconds the angel of the lord could come down and start troubling the waters and and if you don't jump in you could miss it that's why we came this weekend the food's been great the fellowship was excellent we had great time at the volleyball today and enjoying one another but this is what it's all about if we have a few services and you take just the core of that there's a few hours of this weekend that's what it's all about so are you willing to lay aside every weight are you willing to lay aside every sin are you willing to say lord forgive me are you willing to say lord if this is true do something for me come on friends lord remember me we can be all dressed up and all nice took a shower got all dressed brushed her teeth but now we're making ourselves ready to be passionate with the king now some of you know what passion is and the fire you know um if you looked it up on instagram or twitter or facebook you know everybody's interested in being liked you know they're just so liked there's actually syndromes today of people that they get a a negative or they get 16 negatives you know and they just go into depression because the world has created this environment you don't even need to be real you can just have your pajamas on and so you know post all kinds of stuff and then you're getting all this and that and like that and then people go into depression young people commit suicide i'll say this publicly in the last 14 months that we've gone through this uh bleeply bleep do y'all remember that we're not going to give no glory to no bleeply plea you all know what i'm talking about we talked about it last night we're not going to talk about it but for the last 14 months and the things that have gone on and messaged churches and globally two shutdowns and all the things we've gone through had to be distanced from one another i'm more concerned about people dying spiritually i've seen more believers of the message get cold and indifferent and lose their spiritual breath and oxygen level go to almost zero [Music] than to those that have been taken from us in our churches and you know i know of churches i know of one uh in the united states where at least 14 believers died they passed away so it's not just it's not just something funny and i know for young people and young adults it didn't really hit that age group it was maybe a lot of older ones or people that had pre-existing we understand that but i'm more concerned about the spiritual death and the lethargy and the spiritual leprosy that's all over and spirits that have come in and what have you been doing with your downtime you that used to go to school and university and college and now you've been in front of a zoom and then you've been in front of a monitor even churches have resorted back to that when they couldn't gather and and it was shut down you know it seemed like a monitor or screen are we gonna get together and stream it became their church and we can become people where we don't respond because it's just a screen it's just a number out there that we it's just something in another state it's happening in india it's a wave it's a whatever they want to say but let's just turn spiritually where that wave would come and take hundreds of thousands of people's lives that we didn't even know about this thing months ago and it has literally shut down global economies and not just churches it shut down sports teams it shut down malls it shuts down restaurants there's a spiritual something behind all of that how's your spiritual life where's the fire of god on the altar where's the power of god moving i believe god is showing that in spite of all this global nonsense and fear that there's young people and youth that are being set on fire with the same holy ghost that was in the bible the same holy spirit that brother branham had the same holy spirit that was on the book of acts same holy spirit that was on those brother trevor that gave their lives under that anointing is in this building tonight [Applause] hallelujah it's like the waves of the ocean it comes in and then it goes out then it comes in again and then it comes out and if they're surfers here and you that have been to hawaii or in california you know people that love surfing and they're waiting for the wave they're waiting they're just getting excited they'll come down there with their big boards and everything and it's in their blood it's just it's some it's a passion they're surfers they want to be part of the move they're not staying at home and getting all stuffy and i'm not glorifying that i've never done it in my life but there's something about waves there's something about something that comes in and then goes out and god puts a hunger in your life can i go back to instagram just for a minute twitter facebook and these things i a few weeks ago i looked up you know some of the most popular people that have the most followers let's all say followers because we're followers of jesus christ we're passionate about jesus christ i want to fall in love with god we are christian and we're not ashamed of when it talk about older generation younger generation middle we're all a body there's one message one holy ghost but on instagram and twitter if you want to look it up the most followers that people have you'll find the top 10 or top 20 are sports stars hollywood stars singers actors i didn't see one of you on there i didn't see one message minister i didn't see brother matthew on there i didn't see brother billy brother hannah brother david brother steve it's like that's what the world is following sports stars the number one in the world is is a is a soccer player ronaldo people's following after things they're following after and and if you want to look it up i'm not encouraging you to but the actors and the singers they're sexy they're worldly they're modern people are passionate and they're naked that's the top 10 20 stars of the followers on instagram and twitter and there are millions of people following their stars and they're consumed with it tonight who are you following what turns you on what what causes you to get a you want to be connected you want to find out what's happening here look at there and we become a generation you know what we just want all the selfies you know and we want to look the thing and all this part and but who are you following millions they have millions of followers and most of them are going to go to hell let's just say it tonight you might like some of them and i don't want to offend you but i want to hurt you enough to put some fire under you [Applause] i'm not here to offend any person but i am here to encourage every single one of you and myself to be more passionate and on fire for jesus christ spiritually they're bankrupt spiritually they are not satisfied they divorce they separate i mean just talk to melinda gates tonight okay let's have an interview melinda gates she's married to one of the richest men in the whole world bill is his name they live down in seattle near where we live we've been you know you can take a brother phillips probably done this down on lake washington a boat and you can go by where they got their house and the elevator and comes down and all their boats and yachts and all of that and they just announce their separation so money isn't everything so tonight some of you that are running after that just look at life and say that doesn't make people happy and you can talk about mr bozo whoever of amazon he's already separated what's his name what's his name bazoo bozo they're just flesh and blood like you too they sleep eat and that's right and if god doesn't save their souls they're gonna go to hell and all their money with him we just got to talk real friends i mean people live in a fantasy realm oh my loving brother when the world's on fire don't you want his bosom don't you want his bosom don't you want to say i'm passionate about the right thing so the yacht won't make you happy having a billion dollars or 125 billion melinda she said i don't need spousal support she's already a billionaire even if she gets half she don't need half she needs one percent she already told them i don't need your spousal support they got money coming out their ears billion million hundred thousand some of you would say brother john just fifty thousand would be fine they got everything they would want all funniness aside they got everything they want and they don't have the main thing and some of you are craving after you're desiring the things just you're clawing to get one percent of one percent of what they have and they're not happy when are you gonna wake up and say that i believe there's something there's something in this about being passionate for christ being on fire for god are we doing okay you're doing better you're doing good tonight this after tonight it'll be two-thirds over of our services our brother trevor did good today let me tell you a little something about that do you remember the picture brother trevor had up on the screen at the very beginning of the lions coming out and all the believers that were in the cat they were in the coliseum do you all remember that brother john looked at that exact same picture in my office minutes before coming to the service the same photo on my computer not because i also had that photo on my office because it's an amazing picture of a group of believers that this is the last moments of their life and there were old people there were middle age and there were young people there and little children and they were just getting ready to be eat by the lions they had just let the lions loose it's called the martyr's last prayer because some are kneeling some are standing and they're in that posture they're not worried about somebody's sandals and somebody hurt my feelings in the youth group or i'm fee i'm feeling a little sick tonight you know i can't worship because i'm feeling a little sick well if you knew what they had said about me on their instagram and my facebook and my twitter and we get all twisted up and our cell phones can be a device that we are addicted to and i don't want to hurt your feelings some of you are addicted to it and somebody tell you you're addicted to it you get offended no i'm not i'm not you're addicted do you know that do you know that words in the book of acts addicted there were people that were addicted to the saints and to the work of the ministry god help us to be more like that and they just let the lions loose what would be your last prayer i'm just kind of going slow because it needs to sink in we can be shouting and screaming yes yes and all standing but i wanted to sink in what would be your last prayer if the lions are just let loose this is serious this is this is bringing the coming of the lord present tense so that none of us are without excuse do you know that brother branham said in more than one place that there will be people coming to the altar after the bride is gone thinking they're getting saved how many know he said that there will be meetings going on when the bride is gone it's called a tribulation and people are gonna be coming forward thinking they're getting saved and they don't even realize the holy ghost is already lifted he's already gone the young people that were ready to go are already gone there's going to be some say to hold jesus oh jesus coming to an altar and crying out and do you know what that shows all of us whatever they had before the rapture wasn't real because it didn't get them in the rapture so then whatever crying and sign is going to go on is it is it what we need in this building tonight we need a real godly repentance that will cause a change i don't care if it's one person there ought to be 99 of us saying lord help that brother help that sister lord i'm willing to get in the harness i'm willing to get in the saddle and ride this out and it's not even for me it's for my sister it's for my brother it's somebody that came here with all kinds of ideas and god's getting their attention you're passionate about the wrong thing you're going in the wrong direction somebody going down for the last time but jesus heard their cry and he pulled them out of that and we had meetings in dallas and it was for one sheep [Music] georgie carter and we might not never know sister leslie we might not never know on this side that that sister was delivered we might not never know that brother that he was set free but god was dealing with him he became passionate she turned the corner may that happen in these meetings that god put a further flame and a godly fire in our souls and give us a greater desire because let's just take the negative for a minute the world has passion for their immorality they are not ashamed to show their nakedness and it's getting worse and worse and worse they're skinned down they're ungodly when brother branham saw the vision it was the modern church of usa that was rocking and and dancing to the beat of rock and roll music it was not hollywood and it wasn't paris it was the church it was people that thought they knew jesus it was people that thought they knew the lord and they were passionate you look at it i could show you videos on the screen of people with earrings and makeup and they're just they're just moving and swaying they are under something there's some anointing i struck the earth they feel the pull of the hour they feel the pressure you see it when there's a natural a national catastrophe or something you see it on all their billboards pray pray pray and churches are filled up we don't need that kind of uh pull as believers that's emotion and a few a few months go by and they're right back out in the world too busy too busy church is secondary serving the lord is whatever god give us a power of holiness that would just drop down into our lives we we don't need to be screamed at and yelled at and told this and that we just need god to come in our lives and the earrings come out automatically you spend so much time with jesus and crying in tears it would mess up your makeup so bad even just naturally say i don't need that no more i'll just say this publicly to all of our sisters you don't need makeup to be beautiful we just think you're fine well brother john it would probably scare you all if you knew what i really look like without this makeup no we receive you because if jesus receives you we receive you [Applause] hello brothers we all agree okay i'm going to take a vote in this building right now i'm not the pastor but i'm going to take a vote from all you brothers do you think that the sisters look beautiful without makeup stand on your feet stand on your feet are you all serious that's right brother matthew do you think that's it okay i'm going to preach to brother matthew [Laughter] brother matthew do you believe that sisters are beautiful without makeup glory praise god i mean he's a little slow but he got there so ladies ladies can you look so so anybody here that's spiritual are these brothers we all agree so there's no pressure from us stop saying i'm trying to get a husband i'm trying to get married i'm trying to look beautiful we all agree let me ask another question you brothers that are standing do they need to cut their hair for you to think they're beautiful okay then sit down if you think well you don't need to cut your hair just sit down brothers i'm taking another vote they don't need to cut their hair so i think it's pretty good unanimous you know hallelujah we we're talking about holiness the world is passionate about their immorality i'm not going to take a vote sisters i'm not going to embarrass you the world is passionate about wrong music the number one and number five and number 10 in america is not going to be a song written by believers and whatever you music you listen to just make sure it's what we heard about last night that it's something you'd be proud to be played through heaven and it's amazing we said we quoted that last night and i heard it today because i've listened to about five or six messages since last night brother branham said your thoughts are heard louder in heaven than your words are on earth so just be mindful whatever music you think is in for you that it's it's fine to be played in heaven where there's holy angels and seraphim singing holy holy holy unto the lord don't don't be forcing the angels to be rushing over to the volume switch and say okay i'll i'll give her the next 30 minutes you know she's not where she needs to be with the lord very good don't embarrass the lord jesus he's done so much for you hasn't he i've just talked about a little bit of his passion of his stripes that any person in this building are suffering from a sickness you can claim it right now you can claim it right now and say it is finished when he said it was finished that means my healing tumors can fall off cancers can leave [Applause] i believe in medicine doctors nurses i i believe in those things i have nurses in my family my daughter-in-law is a registered nurse we go on down the list my daughter's a cna but only jesus heals you by his stripes you are healed friends let's tap into the supernatural hallelujah it's 756 in dallas and we want more of jesus i've got a group of young people that are passionate for him they're on fire and there's not a lot of smoke going on i believe there's fire in your lives i believe you are following the lord the world is just passionate about their perversion and their sodom they're willing girl girl boy boy to put it in your face and they don't just want to be accepted they want you to celebrate them they want you to celebrate their perversion it's nothing but the truth they don't just want to do their thing quietly they want to call you a whatever if you don't celebrate that's true do you all know do you all know that tonight what we believe is a minority group we're a minority group you might as well just get out of your mind being famous and rich and you either want to be a soccer star and a baseball star you'll probably never be that you can tell i'm not a psychologist because they're saying oh you can be whatever you want to be just be whatever you want to think you want to be and i'm just here to be reality probably none of you will ever be on an nfl team brothers none of you girls will ever be chosen for a leading role an actress for a movie praise god so stop stop trying to impress everybody you're just fine love the lord with all your heart serve him every day of your life [Applause] i'm working on passion i'm changing some of your thoughts about passion and what it is and pleasure and you gotta have it now and you gotta have it now i we read out of acts 1 verse 3 that jesus that we're following is our example and it was a week of passion but the world is passionate about their politics is that true they're passionate about their sports they're consumed with it they'll tear off their clothes and paint big letters on their chest and wear big weird hats and color their hair this is our team our team is good and it could be in last place but you know we're we're passionate about our team and we got the colors on and we want the world to know what's what's wrong with being passionate for jesus they're caught up in their social media they'll walk across down the road across you know a crosswalks and everything i've just come in here in the airport and they'll just go down the like it's crowded with people oh excuse me excuse me they're bumping they're possessed by it they're addicted everybody's got earbuds in you go to a restaurant and there's three or four people and they're all on their cell phone and it creeps right into the message they are passionate about the internet passionate about movies fashion glamour business education they are obsessed with worldliness the world is obsessed with worldliness and they call you crazy and odd and weird when if you'd even want to go is there anybody that would like to give your heart to the lord you know like this and they say you're crazy you're a bigot you know is there anybody here that loves the lord with all my heart with all my heart they're just with all my heart can't you just see it with all my heart i i'm so passionate about jesus can't you just see it on my face just so passionate about the lord i'm consumed with jesus i love him with all of my heart why don't you get your hands up there in the air i love you lord jesus i love you lord you're everything to me well i can't sing well over a thousand tongues and say blessed be the name of the lord praise the lord hallelujah thank you jesus hallelujah hosanna hosanna blessed be the name of the lord do you know people are so possessed with this what i'm talking about and the negative they can be so influenced on palm sunday they're doing that hosanna hosanna taking off their clothes and throwing it down by thursday night and friday the same people are saying crucify him crucify him our opinion changed the majority rules he's a loser that's what the bible says so they're all yes yes he's coming in the name of the lord hosanna blessed me and by friday the crucifying it happens today something happened on friday and by tuesday they're already denouncing god fill us with the holy ghost give me power give me power let's go to matthew chapter four i've been commissioned tonight to ask for reinforcements and recruits to join the lord's army not just initially what some of you thought because probably most of you have given your heart to the lord probably most of you matthew chapter 4 verse 18 are saved i'm taking it to the next level part two part two i'm going to the next level you want to go with me [Applause] you say come follow me come be a christian be baptized most of you have already followed and you're serving the lord and whatever level you are so i'm not talking about that but if you're not saved and you haven't given your heart to the lord and you've never repented or been baptized this is a good time to consider that and in your right mind and in your senses say i choose to follow this kind of jesus that said i'll never leave you nor forsake you and it's not because brother john it's not because i have a bunch of people in this room saying yes yes yes it's because in my heart i have made a decision and i want to see god come behind it and put fire in my heart now let's go back now i'm going rewind to matthew 4 18 when jesus was walking by the sea of galilee and seeing two brothers simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers and he saith unto them what's the next two words follow me i'm called this is the call of peter and andrew follow me and i will make you fishers of men and they just put their arms like this and said who do you think you are telling us to leave our business our father and who are you i don't even know you no that this is the call and they followed him straightway right away they left their nets and followed him going on from fence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother so it's james and john and a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them he called them by name and again it's like who do you think you are i'm i'm caught up in my nets man can't you see this net man can you just see here i've got that minion and fish are awesome man fish are just fantastic i'm not going to follow you follow you on dry ground when i can go fishing i'm going fishing forget you no watch their attitude see it's a change of attitude immediately they left their ship and their father and followed him has god ever called you would brother philip wallman please stand on his feet brother trevor why didn't you stand on your feet brother i didn't call you i mean sister karina's sitting back they're so beautiful she's related to brother phillip but why did you stand up karina i mean i know you really good she's from the renton seattle church she plays the piano like fantastic you all didn't know that but i'm giving you a little bit more information don't you be thinking that i'm talking about karina over here why didn't she stand up like i know her really good i talked to her today i know her father brother mcmahon and her sisters and all of this and why didn't she stand up like i'm offended corrine philip stood up you know why because i called him and the brother really nice brother right next to him man he's like his strong brother he didn't stand he didn't move in fact philip stood up and he's like chuckle chuckle you know philip's being called on again brother danny steeman called on him by the trevor guard mother john now i mean brother jackson you didn't stand up because i didn't call him friends you can be in the same room and god call someone so don't be embarrassed don't be ashamed but i would i'm getting a little jealous somebody called brother philip's name i want my name to be called thank you brother philip and now we have peter you have james you have andrew and john they're serving the lord they're following the lord for how long brother billy years they followed the lord right up through that week of his passion and even when they didn't have the holy ghost they didn't have the holy ghost they had a lot of revelation thou art the christ the son of the living god blessed art thou peter and you don't even have the holy ghost that's where a lot of people in the message and even young people can have revelation and all these things but we need the power of god and peter peter cursed and swore and this is one time of the week of his passion that young people was mentioned and that's a young maid a damsel said i know you i know you peter your speech betrayeth you you all talk like message believer and he got so mad with peer pressure i'm not going to say it but he cursed and swore [Music] peter had already heard from the lord before the crows you're gonna deny me thrice let me know that oh lord and the bible says he ran out bitterly he's like i'm embarrassed he's given me the keys to the kingdom i've been like one of those guys that's jumping out of the boat and i'm first and i'm you know we always look at peter and say oh he's always out of order and jumping out of boats and doing stuff well what do you do you stayed in the boat peter at least jumped out there well lord save me oh the person's always in trouble they're this and that and giving song specials then you don't know where they're at and this and that and well what are you doing mrs critic [Music] and you definitely don't want to preach a sermon anybody that wants to preach is crazy anybody that has a desire to preach you're crazy you lost your mind you better make sure it's god amen hallelujah they say public speaking is the number one thing people would rather die what are we doing up here tonight it's not public speaking i just gave my body to jesus and he's putting some zeal in some of you some passion you're look you're seeing the message from another angle i'm not giving you a class and an intellectual lecture i refuse to force our young people to be bored in church hallelujah it's not head knowledge it's the spirit of god moving making the word alive even in a teacher even an apostle and a pastor we need the holy ghost can you say amen tonight i i believe that most of you in this room are like peter and andrew his brother and james and john you have followed the lord you've given your life to the lord so let's turn to john chapter 21. is it okay if we read some scripture john 21 are we doing okay some of you have actually gotten more awake since the service started i'm impressed man i'm so happy no jericho march tonight brother jackson hallelujah there's been awakening there's some fire here some are actually enjoying the house of god lord help our church services be more like that where we can laugh and cry and be sincere then we'll go a little bit lighter and we'll talk about and what what's god doing he's opening up your heart he's opening up your spirit he's opening up your heart so that when you receive the word you become the word as you receive the word it takes some work fallow ground flout you know get it hardened and get it softened back up again and lord send the rain amen some of you didn't realize that's what was happening but that's what's happening and you're a disciple and you gave your heart to jesus young lady or a young man or any believer you're a disciple so now in john 21 this is now after this week and things and jesus is talking to peter in verse 15 and he starts talking to him about feeding the lambs we have that on the screen right to you that don't have a bible you can see this he said feed my lambs take care of the young people take care of the children and we see on down here he's asking about his love in verse 16 he said feed my sheep it's the last three words of verse 16 feed my sheep verse 17 he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me peter was upset he was grieved it's like why are you asking me this i've been a disciple for all these years in the message and when i bore for you and you've asked me three times now he was grieved because he saith the third time loveth thou mean he said un to him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep just give them the word feed them the word number one brother trevor this is for you feed my lambs and brother comas would i say your name wrong say your name yes sunday school yes yes take care of the young people take care of the sheep don't despise them don't look down on the young people don't say oh you're just your young people your children we've been there we've done that we know it all that's what you're saying i know it all right so and then the young people that you know they're beaten down and you talk down to them you degrade them by speaking condescending always always paul said to timothy he said don't let people when they do that to you don't let it affect you because they will try to despise your youth they will say you're nothing you're little you're nobody you haven't looked down on you and paul which was the messenger and timothy was a young man coming up paul wanted to make sure that timothy was encouraged be strong don't let no one despise and look down on you with disdain am i getting into somebody's personal life if you've been abused you've been looked at and somebody's done something wrong to you that was the devil using instruments and the wrong spirits you're better than that you're bigger than that you're not a victim the rest of your life you rise in the name of the lord and come out of that arise you're a disciple passionate in spite of our failure in spite of my past this is peter he's upset again brother matthew why are you bringing this up again three times that i love you i'll pull out my sword and you're not gonna die you're not going to be taken from us jesus is telling him i've got to go and what manner of death they're going to kill me no you're not and he pulls his sword lord i'll die for you and just in a matter of time he's cursing and swearing and that's the weakness of our flesh all our determination and all of our zeal we can do this yes we can you're not gonna catch nothing that's in the same chapter right here they say i go efficient you know it's saturday and there's nothing going on and jesus died on the cross and everybody's run let's just all go fishing that's the attitude and seven other brothers said we go too yeah we're going fishing too well let's go man let's all cry together this is horrible isn't it this is so bad and they go all under they didn't have the holy ghost friends we need the holy ghost we need the power of god to raise us up lift up our chin lift up our attitude even on the emmaus road they were talking so sad don't you even know what's going on around here and and jesus was already risen easter and they were talking about the way it used to be and don't you know and now he's dead and by the end of the conversation jesus is talking to them talking to them like i'm talking to you tonight and by the end of this conversation that one was about six hours but they walked all the way to emmaus and my they were enjoying this fellowship and he made like he was going to keep on walking listen we got to go in now it's church time we got to go in now we're going to have some and will you come with us constrain him and they brought him into the room and would you just bless and break the bread and he began and they saw and they knew him their eyes were open the way he broke bread is what he did before it's the same jesus it is the lord he was there all the time he was walking with us for these last hours and we were so caught up in our past and our downtrodden and our thoughts but by the more he talked about the word our hearts burn within us and now we're all saying it is jesus hallelujah let's all say jesus young people that are passionate and on fire say jesus do you know there was a little boy laying in the womb of a mother for six months hadn't moved [Applause] and a teenager a teenager a young girl about 15 years old to 18 had a a visit from an angel and before she even took a pregnancy test before she even felt any movement mary ran to elizabeth and started to confess the word and while she gave the testimony and said are you serious you're pregnant well you're not even married elizabeth said to mary you're you're not even why didn't you invite me to the wedding no no no no we've never been married it was the angel it was the word that said i'm this the word said i'm passionate [Applause] [Music] well what are you going to call him i'm sure his name shall be jesus and all of a sudden instead of elizabeth [Applause] they weren't talking about the movie and somebody done somebody wrong song they were talking about the words they were talking about isaiah's prophecy joseph and mary didn't have a carnal relationship before they were married she was a virgin hello wake up everybody we're talking about being passionate a young lady was passionate about the word and at the very name of jesus she was friends with her with elizabeth that was of the older generation hallelujah elizabeth was barren too we're not going to go into the whole story but even the high priest got struck dumb because he didn't believe how was these things going to be and god said because you didn't believe i'm striking you dumb boy that'd kill some of us wouldn't it hello you can't talk for nine months that'd be horrible wouldn't it zechariah was the high priest well mary said almost the exact same words if you go back to the how is these things going to be but it wasn't unbelief so someone that should have known better said well how is this going to be you know and mary says well how is these things going to be god didn't strike her dumb it shows how a young person can just be asking questions and it's not ungodly it's just the lord needs to reveal that in the next few minutes she's telling elizabeth of the promise and life is coming that's why i said let's all say jesus because we don't know what's happening in this room right now we don't know what god could do right now somebody that's been dead and even lazarus is asleep and all of a sudden he heard the name stinking rotten his nose falling in grave clothes wrapped around and all of a sudden he hears his name he's way out there somewhere in paradise and his name is called what am i supposed to do brother billy well go back there brother branham said there was so much power in his voice that if he would have said rise every person that was dead would arose from the dead but he said lazarus come forth tonight tonight the holy spirit is calling your name he's speaking to you come forth and you feel that little something you feel that little quickening you feel that little life mary didn't run and get a pregnancy test she was confessing the word before she saw any physical signs i'm quoting to you some of you thought well brother john why'd you bring that ipad so many quotes of brother branham well if you know the message i've been quoting brother branham throughout this whole weekend brother branham said before she even was positive she's confessing the word do you know he also said that about the upper room before they even received it they were confessing it lord we believe we believe you said go terry in jerusalem i i called you tonight the upper room youth yes before you even feel it before you even see it before you even it strikes your emotion something strikes your soul [Applause] so now we're getting back to john 21 excuse me for the delay and we're going to skip verse 18 but verse 19 it's a good verse 18 but this signifying by what death he should glorify god jesus talking to peter sorry john 21 19. then he says these other two words that i'd like to speak about for a few minutes to some somebody here and the rest of you can just listen when he had spoken this or maybe it's somebody on the internet the lord wants to talk to him a little or her a little bit do you all have time welcome to the service you've been a disciple for years you've given your life to the lord before but now he's saying in verse 19 he said unto him follow me well lord we've already been following you i've been your disciple that's not what i'm talking about i'm taking you to the next level follow me peter and knowing him because peter's a type of the church he probably got a little upset and frustrated uh verse 17 said peter was grieved why you keep asking me this peter i'm going to go away in a few days and i know your nature and i know you love me and you're passionate and you're zealous because you took your sword out and in the garden you're gonna take off that guy's head and he just moved a little bit you got his ear how many remember that dark knight peter wasn't going for his ear where'd that come from i mean he was going for his head i'm going to take out anybody that blessed the lord i'm going to take off this guy's head and you oh sh and he took off his ear jesus didn't say that's my man that's my man he said come on peter i'm right in the middle of this season put away your sword that's not how it's going to happen jesus reached down on the ground that definitely wasn't sanitized he didn't get out the bottom one squirt squirt squirt and put it back on he just picked it up put it back on and let's go like miracles are happening things are going on judas is kissing jesus and betraying the lord and jesus is just lifting and putting ears back on blessed are your ears for you here right he could be doing that tonight putting somebody's ears back on putting their eyes back on i see it's been the lord all the time [Applause] cripples like i said last night i don't see any crutches here tonight no wheelchairs but there's people that have been broken young people is brother trevor said we live in an age that it seems like we're not unfit to live in and we can get broken mentally broken and jesus is here to say i'm here to heal the wounded in heart remember maybe it's somebody on the internet listen really good jesus is saying to peter in verse 19 follow me follow me well lord i i did that years ago can you put that up brother john 21 19. i did it i followed you don't you remember hello i i was the the gnets and all that and fishermen and all and i followed you what are you talking about and it goes on to talk about in verse 20 21 22 and and you know verse 21 is peter saying you know what about this other guy verse 20 and 21 is he's talking about john and john's not going to say his name john's writing this and john is so humble he just says the disciple whom jesus loved in verse 20 and that was leaning on his breast that was john and they all said well tell us tell us who's going to betray the lord and they asked john because he was close to jesus verse 21 peter seeing him say it to jesus lord and what shall this man do or what's john gonna do what about and again jesus is having to talk to him and say if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee in other words stop worrying about everybody else peter peter i'm trying to get your attention stop worrying about john and everybody else and what they're called to do worry about yourself get passionate about your own life stop worrying about everybody else hello tonight shake off that selfishness it's all about me it's not all about you and we're not going to let you control the service and the spirit that's on you we're not going to let control the service there's too many of us that have been praying for a holy ghost move and there's too many of us you're outnumbered devil [Applause] you probably didn't feel comfortable here 15 minutes ago but right now devil we're telling you to leave and go out of here leave these young people leave their minds leave their spirit leave their bodies we curse you tonight devil you demon spirit you ungodly thing that's trying to take our young ladies and tell them they're no good they're not beautiful i'll just go out and commit suicide you're not a judas get back in here jesus was trying to bring his arms around peter help me help me now everyone he's putting his arms around peter and saying don't worry about everybody else verse 21 the last three words what does it say say it out loud verse 22 verse 22 sorry brothers what's the last three words he's saying it again i can already see the blood rising up rising up rising up peter's blood pressure's rising out you're telling me follow me lord he still don't get it he still didn't have the holy ghost but jesus was saying i've just got a few more days with you now i just got a little bit more time and i've got to go away you got to get this you got to get this i'm not talking about years ago when you were baptized and gave your heart to the lord you have followed me you're you have been my disciple i'm taking it to the next level i'm trying to get you to understand i went through a week of passion and you're going to have to follow me and go the same place do you understand you're going to have to be willing to die on the cross are you willing to do that that's what i'm talking about tonight and i'm nailing it down right here i'm not talking about when you first gave your heart to the lord follow me follow thou me he was saying i know your future and you're gonna need something more than what you've had in the past and all your zeal and passion and what you thought was you know meeting the grade we got to go to the next level we've been holding hands we you know we've been taking you out for you know meals but we got to go to the next level will you marry me do you want to be my wife now i'm talking spiritual it's time to move from bride to wife his wife has made herself ready go deeper now come on young people you're big enough for this his wife has made herself ready not his bride you know coming down the aisle and everything everybody's all happy and streamers hey and everybody i'm so happy his wife responsibility is settling in now i gotta take up my cross i gotta take up my cross daily oh man oh man if you just said every few months or at special meetings i can bear a cross in church man and i'm with a couple hundred other young people every christians we're believers i'm not talking about that i'm trying to get you to the next level to monday and tuesday to where you're willing to follow the lord when jesus has ascended up and he's gone and you're not hunting with him no more and you're not fishing with him no more and you're all alone hello out there on the internet amen it's got silent in here but that's exactly what you needed to hear we're not babies no more young people all the cursing and swearing and lying and what about so and so was before the holy ghost came on you it ought to be lord i'm pressing on if i've got to stand alone i don't need a couple other 100 young people to be patting me on the back saying good job good job good job throwing their hats up and cheering i'm looking to the balcony because there's somebody up there called my master he's trained me and i'm looking for that little smile of approval i'm looking to jesus i know you all love me and i love you too but i'm looking when i go back to my motel room tonight and i'm all alone for the lord jesus to say that's exactly what i wanted to say you hit the mark yes if there'd be five of you ten of you or a hundred of you or somebody out there would catch the vision and say it's this not come follow me to the altar come follow me to be baptized it's now come follow me in my passion and a sacrifice and suffering are you willing to do that and that's where you probably lose a lot of people right there just give me my coffee and my starbucks and i'm good you know my bank account i got a good car and god was saying no peter will you follow me in service i'm closing my bible will you give your life including to death will you take up your cross and follow me all the way how many know history says when peter came to the time he was going to be put on the cross he remembered back there when he said i don't even know the man it stayed with him his whole life he denied the lord saul became paul always remembered when stephen was there the first murderer and and he was such a coward saul was he just said i'm not going to throw the stones i'm just going to sit over here everybody put your garments around me and everybody's throwing and bastion in stephen and saul's over there saying i got another one of those guys and for the rest of his life paul remembered that and that's why he said i am the chiefest among you sinners i persecuted i killed your mother i killed your brother i killed the song leader of that church the pastor of that i i signed his death warrant and sister so and so whenever that brother comes to preach at the church she's always like this you know why because you killed my husband three of my children that i bore and burnt you killed them i'm not going to receive bless god no you need to get out of the way that was a different person that was saul this is paul but do you all understand saul paul remembered that forever that's why he said i'm more passionate i'm more ardent than anyone and now peter's at this time of death and he said i'm not worthy to die like my lord and they hung him upside down god give us youth that are on fire for god hallelujah jesus give us young men and young ladies say lord you know my life you know what i've done i'll serve you with more passion some of you god has forgiven you of so much you ought to give the rest of your life for him no sob stories no whimpering if nobody ever shakes your hand if you're a pauper and live under the the bridge where you live but you go to heaven and you're part of the bride god bless you tonight see whom that has been forgiven much you love him more some of you need to rise up even older ones and say i've been forgiven much i'm going to serve the lord with gladness but some of you that's been raised in the message and i have been too we ought to just say from our hearts because the lord has saved me from much i love him much amen can we go to that level some of you are teens and you're just kind of coming up like this and you just need to realize there's responsibility to life it's not all just coming and just jumping with everyone and and coming and giving your heart and baptizing i'm taking you to the next level take up your cross be a real lady be a real man hallelujah lord give us that kind of men and women that will say daily i want to follow you lord maybe our musicians can come in spite of failure i will be passionate amen look into the face of jesus tonight if you can and say that peter and thomas i'm so embarrassed thomas after all these years of following the lord said unless i put my hands in his side and listen and you know what jesus did he didn't say because you did that you'll never do anything for me the next time thomas was in the room jesus comes in and he says oh by the way thomas do you all know why because thomas was the son of god he didn't say all because of your unbelief and because you're no good and just because you didn't see you don't believe no no he said thomas here i am i'm trying to make myself known to you you're my disciple i'm not throwing you to the side i need you for future victories i need you and brothers and sisters i'll be honest with you my time is over brother john i'm 49 my prime is in the past and i'm not being humble or nothing i'm man enough to know i'm past my prime it's time for some of you young men to step into the channel and be real leaders and ladies this is your time to rise in the beauty and be an esther how many know esther was a teenager when she became queen how many know that she was a teenager she was beautiful she wore the burden of the message as a teenager and if i perish i perish do you understand what god is saying tonight it's saturday night and it seems like not a lot's happening but little do you know god is ripping the keys off satan [Music] oh you say brother john it just seems like it's dark outside look it's getting dark and we're gonna go out and have some sandwiches and fellowship in a few minutes it just seemed like it didn't really affect me brother john but little do you know in this service the devil has already been kicked smashed in the face [Applause] jesus that was on that cross and they thought that he's just dead over here and the two please show us a webcam view of jesus to just be laying in a tomb somewhere on saturday little do you and i know he's down there killing the devil ripping the keys of death hell and the grave up kicking him over he's coming up through paradise paradise where all those brothers and sisters in the old testament is a big room full of people and he knocks on the door can i just have a couple more minutes [Music] can i have a few more minutes he's knocking on the door and he opens it up praise god there's a great big rejoicing going on back there daniel and ezekiel they all start talking come over here abraham there's a commotion what's going on back he's here he's here my my blood is still wet on the cross and i'm here it's almost sunday morning it's almost easter praise god hallelujah we're going to be free and the bible says in matthew that many of the saints arose some of you think that oh jesus arose sunday no the dead in christ that were in the old they arose too but who's that man over in the corner he just walked in he just walked into this room and there's all kinds of people that stood for christ and were disciples he's like what am i doing in here all you brothers and you sisters [Music] esther and ruth what am i doing in here i i stole i'm a thief i'm a killer i'm a robber what am i doing in here this just happened did i go into the wrong room just a few minutes ago i was on a cross i was hanging on a cross gasping for hair there was a man in the middle and the other guy over there that had just been visited by jesus too down in the regions of the lost this guy over here when jesus walked into the regions of the lost to grab those keys off there's one man over there that said that was my last chance if i would have known and jesus didn't have an altar call no mercy no more grace no more love the door was but now here's another man over here and he looks into this i never was baptized i never was at a youth camp i never went to the temple what am i doing here i'm not worthy to be here all you people are worthy you've lived good lives i'm unworthy what's going on it's the thief on the cross amen he said three words that is incredible lord remember me some of us need to say that tonight amen lord remember me i mean we stumble over our words we stumble over our past we stumble over a lot of things we need to just have that kind of faith and say lord today you shall be with me in paradise he was there the last one to make it the last one and jesus looked over to him and said it's time to go and he included the man on the cross and all those believers say it's time to go for easter sunday morning our resurrection who wants to go who's passionate about this yes ma'am they were on fire [Applause] [Music] we're just gonna give you some more time because a few days before you cursing swearing lying you're doing this that other i'll we'll give you two months and you're going to be a totally different people i'm talking about all of the disciples that ran and all kinds of things in 50 days they were totally different did you all catch that give me two months brother billy and that person that was dead dry no life they're on fire they're leaders in our church god's done something for mother matthew friends can we give one another that kind of grace and mercy can we do that tonight just give them some more time you say we don't have time if time tarries there's going to be more battles i have that right in my notes in closing just give them 50 days two months and they're totally gonna be transformed and come busting out of that room they used to be cowards they used to be deniers but they're on the front lines maybe that's some of our young people here tonight i feel embarrassed brother john i'm ashamed if you knew my past life isn't it amazing that the god that knows all of our private lives is still preaching to us like this turning the corner saying it's time to go to the next level it's time to move on now here's your sword here's your shield here's your encouragement this is real [Music] who'd like to sign up for this what i'm talking about tonight peter follow me heavenly father this is a room full of sons and daughters of yours and i pray your holy spirit would just come and cap off this evening service with the supernatural and vindicate that what brother john has spoken was your mind and your will as soon as we walked into the gym this morning and saw that picture that brother trevor had on the screen that was enough witness of what i just saw a few minutes before in my little motel room there's a mind of god for this there's a pre-planning for all of this what you laid on brother david's heart sister leslie's heart and this assembly to invite us and to come all of us this weekend and all the expense and all the labors was for our good it was to give a reflection of god's grace and mercy that means there's some that are here or will stream this service or is watching right now that is saying in their hearts lord make me more passionate give me a love and a fire in my bosom that i won't even be able to contain it let it be fire in my bosom would you do that lord for us tonight would you confirm your word with signs following would you cast out the evil lord if there's any sin among us that we've taken some time of these precious people's time and their energy to spend in a service but we'd much rather be here we'd much rather be a door keeper in the house of our god than to dwell in the tents of the wicked [Music] we'd much rather one of our sisters be simple and humble and homely among us than to be a cheerleader for the dallas cowboys or a dance flaunting her virtues for some lustful eyes some spirit of the enemy trying to choke out the life breathe on us breathe on this congregation and teach us how to breathe again teach us how to breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out let us be thankful let there be spontaneous praises as the young lady that was 18 years old it wasn't an ordinary service it was a time of the young people gathering that she stood up in the meeting and said lord jesus i love you with all of my heart and the power of god fell in that meeting and over a hundred thousand souls were one to christ in the welsh revival but it started with a group of young people that became passionate and on fire and didn't care what everybody else thought about them but they said lord they were praying they were praying and a young man 22 years old coming out of the coal mines and other brothers and sisters earl roberts and others that if i showed their pictures maybe some would even laugh maybe a little bit their mustaches or their little dresses but they became they become the leading fire brands of the revival oh god give us give us youth that are on fire tonight lord oh father we stand here on this saturday after the 40 days and it might seem like we're waiting and waiting and what are you waiting for oh lord cinder power and your fire just now don't let it be a verse in the bible and just an old story of when the day of pentecost was fully come but let it be
