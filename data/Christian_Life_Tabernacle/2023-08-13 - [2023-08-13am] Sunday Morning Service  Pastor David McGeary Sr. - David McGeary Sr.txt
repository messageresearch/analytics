we've been there but all the places we've traveled and all the things we've went through everybody sends their love and their greetings to the people to the Bride of Jesus Christ the pastor and it's the same spirit that unites us it's the word of the Lord amen amen we're just gonna sing a verse this morning as we just said my brother Mike to just come and open in the word of prayer into the psalm reading let's just sing this verse as we remember the mic let the weave [Music] oh amen and let the weeds [Music] say I can see what the Lord [Music] animals [Applause] [Music] at us [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus again [Music] go ahead and bow our heads just commit the service unto the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we love you this morning and once again just so grateful for the opportunity to come together Lord to learn of you to worship you to lift up your name Lord the world pulls Us in so many directions and requires so much of us the Lord to have a place and a time set aside that we can set all that apart Lord and to come into your presence and to welcome you and Lord I pray that Lord as your word is said that where two or three are gathered in your name Lord you've called us by your name Lord Jesus and as we come in that door there's Lord all kinds of needs questions burdens third things that we have in our heart Lord You're the answer to everyone Lord and you promised you're the need meter you're the burden Bearer father you're the Healer Lord You're the deliverer Lord You're the lifter of every burden and father we just commit the service to you that your word would have preeminence Lord that you would Lord take control of every spirit that would seek to hinder the moving of your hand and the delivery of your word Lord that you would be lifted up and glorified in our midst Lord that this would not be about a man or the works of men but father that you would Lord just when we all leave here we could say that the hand of God was clearly seen among us we pray we commit this service to you once again we thank you in Jesus name amen amen maybe seated take a load off your feet for a minute you know we have a tendency when we I don't want you but when we look at the scriptures we have a tendency to look at some of the Great characters of the Bible and make them superhuman in our minds you know we read of their great works they're great victories how the Lord spoke to them in such Mighty ways and maybe found themselves in Hebrews 11 as a hero of faith but we make them something greater than what we are right we make them Larger than Life you know so much greater so much stronger so much more useful you know and if we're not careful we can let the enemy Rob us of our potential because we make the examples that the word gives us something that is beyond us something we can't reach you know what's so wonderful about the songs is it gives us kind of an up close and personal intimate look at the struggles of one of these Great Men in these scriptures we can see what it was really like for David a man who is after God's Own Heart has he struggled day in and day out the one who slew Giants the one who defeated Kings the one who ruled Nations and yet you can see that he was just like the rest of us you know we read last week that David got to a place where he was so exhausted so worn down by just all the trivial things of Life the things that just don't matter and he got to such a place where he found himself wondering if God hated him even though he was a man after God's Own Heart you know the enemy uses those same tactics on the rest of us you know and he saw himself in a place where he needed to lay hold of the same one that we need to lay hold of in those times of exhaustion you know it helps us realize that David was just like us he had the same mind battles that we do the same kinds of daily struggles he was just human dependent on the Lord just like the rest of us there's no such thing as superhumans and little humans there's just regular men and women struggling through life trying to lay hold of the Lord that's what I appreciate about the song you know in Psalm 13 which we'll read this morning David is once again in a place where he's in need of God you know it's just a short song but you know as we read this we'll be reading statements that could just as easily come from any one of our own lips Maybe it was even something we prayed this morning in verse one how long will you forget me O Lord how long will you hide your face from me verse 2 is my enemy that thing which comes against me how long will he have victory over me but you know as we read this there's a statement here that David makes as he's crying out to the Lord which you don't want to take a look at and again it really doesn't matter what he was struggling with in this hour one day all those things were long forgotten amen but notice in his prayer what he asks for in verse 3. he says consider and hear me o my O Lord my God lighten mine eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death in the middle of his circumstance his cry was light in mine eyes enlighten me cause me to see you know that caught my attention because you know here's this man after God's Own Heart praying in his time of need and he's not asking for relief he's not asking for healing he's not asking for deliverance he's asking for sight he's asking the desires would be lightened he asked for revelation Lord enlighten me help me to see open my eyes you know it caused me to wonder how many times I look at my problem and I pray that God would deliver me from my problem but how many times do I ask him to open my eyes and reminded of that prophet in the Old Testament who had a servant who in an hour of great trial was in desperation and the prophet said open his eyes that he can see the rest of the story help me to see what you're doing helped me to see as you see give me thus saith the Lord you know brother Branham said in the church ages book that the importance of Revelation cannot be overemphasized he said it's more important than perhaps we realize he said if you could pray for anything pray for revelation Enlighten my eyes that I may see David said in Psalm 119 Verse 18 open thou mine eyes light my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law you know this isn't just about seeing great scriptural truths of the age show me my circumstance according to your word where I am today nobody can teach you that from a Pulpit only God can do that if we'll ask the question is is do we ask you know I know my first reaction is to to a problem is to take it away but the scriptures show time and again those asking open my eyes David said in Psalm 18 28 for thou Wilt light my candle the Lord my God will Enlighten my darkness you know again this is more than just being able to see him in a dark age this is about him me as an individual seeing him in my dark hour this is about being quickened by his word in our daily circumstance that's the daily lamp to our feet that the scriptures speak about also in Psalm 119 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light onto my path he said in Psalm 27 11 teach me thy way O Lord lead me in a plain path not a hidden one that I can clearly see lighten mine eyes oh Lord did you know it's a word promise that he opens eyes that he reveals secrets that he shines a light if we will but ask you know we all know First Corinthians 2 9. it says I hath not seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but you know the problem is is we stop right there we make that our promise we're satisfied with that and we call it faith I believe that the Lord has good things for me and I'm trusting in that but that's only half the promise if you keep reading it says in verse 10 but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the Deep things of God that's the promise that he hath revealed them if if we would but ask you know you can keep on reading in First Corinthians 2. it's just a wonderful chapter he says for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received the spirit we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given of us by God for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of the Lord Enlighten my eyes open my eyes cause me to see nothing is out of control everything is happening according to plan open my eyes let me see lighten mine eyes if we will but ask let's go ahead and stand there's a promise that we can be shown and we can see thus saith the Lord in our day this day where I am today and will but ask as David does in Psalm 13. pray for revelation it's the most important thing to see as he sees to see by his word to have our path lightened by that lamp not just Mysteries of the age but to see in the darkness of my hour now let's just go ahead and read that little Psalm Psalm 13 this morning light in mine eyes let's start in verse one how long will thou Forget Me O Lord forever how long will thou hide thy face from me how long shall I take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me consider and hear me O Lord my God lighten mine eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death lest might enemies say I have prevailed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved but I have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation I will sing unto the Lord because he hath dealt bountifully with me amen amen God bless you you can turn around and shook a hand of somebody tell them good morning God bless you amen amen in the Henderson the key of f please in that City where the lamb is the light amen there's a country far beyond the Starry Sky and there's a city [Music] [Applause] real nasty [Music] lies [Music] [Applause] [Music] anywhere to land [Music] [Applause] there's the flowers [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] alive here we have our disappointed [Music] right below in [Applause] that City where the land is [Applause] [Applause] and I'm free I am [Applause] doing that the sunshine [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] I wonder [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if I should Joy CE [Applause] this song such as I [Music] did [Music] Buy [Applause] such love [Music] [Applause] address [Music] [Music] I will [Music] [Applause] [Music] be wide open are his arms [Applause] [Music] such a love that he gave his only begotten son so we have his love amen but the Jolla Villa has a special this morning if he wants to come at this time and then after him we're going to ask social sister Victoria and friends to come afterwards [Music] foreign [Music] then throw them [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] then through them [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] dead [Music] soon [Music] [Music] La crew [Music] then throw them [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] thank you uh greetings from Cloverdale um the lord gave me this song during covid so I just pray that it's a blessing to you [Music] since curse is broken the victories [Music] I walk in Victory every day Steps of Faith I'm taking the foundation has been laid and the price has been paid with confidence upon his work I can't say this it is done since curse is broken the victory is defeated [Music] [Music] amen amen amen and to every word being unto me for you've already won in English [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] victories [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it is finished because my Lord and Jesus he took this thing of death on Calvary and he's just a bluff amen we have a few announcements this morning the youth choir members to stay after the service this morning and meeting the Overflow so if you're in the youth choir just after the service on the back they're going to have a meeting also we're going to announce that Sunday school starts back tonight between ages four and six and seven through nine so if the children are ready for Sunday school they could come tonight and 10. but the chase here also has a request and it says please pray for brother John's heart that may his heart rhythm back to normal so we know that the word of God delivers for some of those things we just have to believe amen he never changes Saints he's always the same it's a matter of our attitude and how we approach the word if we go if it reverence if we give it humility if we humble ourselves to the word and accept it really in our heart he really will Deliver Us amen and we have a testimony here that justifies of that sister Gail Singh is saying here she says God has begun to answer the unspoken prayer request for multiple people the Saints have prayed for one of which was my daughter-in-law whose body was rejecting all treatments for her cancer says she got bad side effects this treatment was stopped three weeks ago but tests showed yesterday that there were good news today they're able to resume the chemo treatment I believe prayer of the Saints was answered also my severe pains have disappeared by God's healing Grace I walked and felt much better and and so much that she's here with us this morning so his word his word is the same he never changes if you have a need upon your heart this morning you can raise it before him if it's small or big however his work covers it all because his blood had been shed on Calvary and it's already a done work amen nothing he could do for you that he already has done it amen let's just bow our heads that we just approached the king this morning Heavenly Father Lord we're such a privileged people a lot of people that has access to your blood of people that you redeemed before the foundation of the world Lord and now we're just walking through the steps that you foreign before us to walk into and love and so Lord we're here in humility this morning asking Lord that whatever need there is on your Bright's heart and the ones that were read and all the testimonies that we've read Lord that you come and you deliver and you provide and let the Holy Spirit come and do a work because it's a perfect work Lord and the trials that we go to is not some strange thing Lord but it's something that you've allowed us to go through because it's the faith that takes us out of the situation so this morning by your blood we ask Lord to cleanse us to heal us to deliver us to fill us to give us more of your spirit more of your character and so much that we reflect you Lord every day of our life every hour that we are able to look upon your word that you give us Revelation just like we heard Lord we asked this morning that you bless the man of God that would step behind here and that you fill them and then you just speak to us this morning Lord Lord we're in such a unique and special time where you're uniting with your bride Lord it's intimate it's special let us not miss it because we want to be there Lord Jesus we want to pull on your gift we want to pull on your word we ask Lord that you bless us you be with us and you also bless the tithes and the offerings Lord and further and for your kingdom in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you sing this song I adore you you saw me [Music] and through it all [Music] not safe my sin and shame forever I will bless your holy name I adore for you [Music] adore you the Lamb of God my savior [Music] good morning [Music] you saw me in my name you paid the price for me and through your love I have been set free [Music] now I am not the same you took my sin and shame forever I will bless your holy man [Applause] I adore you I adore myself [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] belong to worship let's all stand as we invite Brother David [Music] face [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] off to shame less [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] and let's pray together our heavenly father Lord you're worthy of all praise and worship father is humans were incapable of giving you the worship that you deserve the Lord you chose to shed Your Love upon us that we can be partakers of your great nature and we're so grateful for that this morning Lord we ask that you touch our hearts today and our lives and build us up make us strong in you that we might obtain victories that we never even thought could be possible may we Rise Above All doubt and all fear and may we come to know you in the power and might of your great resurrection and your creative power we ask that you'd impart yourself to each of us this morning Father that we could love and serve you better we asked these things this morning in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning amen if you have your Bibles this morning uh thank you musicians certainly enjoyed that those specials and and uh um yeah I just I just thought they're perfect with this morning's service and also uh the psalm reading I thought it went perfect that and it's nice to have a Stefan's back and a lot of of us back a lot of us are gone for the wedding and different things but it's nice I guess brother Tim I guess you didn't realize you had so many brothers and sisters did his family got together this last week I think all 10 of is it 10 all 10 of the brothers and sisters for the first time in almost 20 years so I I thought that was really spectacular I just got to spend a few days in Montana I went back to where Sharon was born and back to the ranch and and uh up to the places I worked and I is blessing but you know it's beautiful country and but God has me here so would just rejoice in that amen I appreciate it so much let's turn it into Hebrews and and we want to read in the 11th uh chapter am I of Hebrews here and the very familiar scriptures to you all I'm sure you have a memorized but we want to just um think deep on these things this morning now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear how do you know that by faith by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God hath translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God now just for me to interject that there you know we're part of that enact type right and so just let's let's just run that uh go back over that verse Again by faith in it was translated so he possessed something that translated him that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony so before he was translated he had to have this testimony that he pleased God so keep pleased God now look at how that he comes back and tells us how we please God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated uh certainly a uh a wonderful a scriptural reading and we know that the word of God tells us this morning that we're living in perilous times and uh and that this would be a time that man would no longer wish to retain God in his thinking or his knowledge so man doesn't even want to consider the involvement of God in his affairs if I could say it in this words like this that man has decided to take care of himself because they have made a decision in their heart that we can make it we can make the decisions we can make the things that we have need of we can use science we can use education we can use civilization that they they seek after all things that are carnal and all things that are within their understanding and their reasoning but they have eliminated and separated the supernatural from their life and this is uh uh very uh meaningful to me this morning because I I feel in my heart that the the church World in general and Christianity in general is relying to more on theology than faith and the great part of what was going to be restored to the church in this last day was the faith that our fathers had and so so it's so important and and I want to listen this morning to 30 minutes out of the sermon called uh the the super sense and and also preached as The Sixth Sense the fact that there's an uh something that a Believer has within them that's called faith we know that faith is synonymous with the word revelation but it's something inside the believer that they have and it is a gift of God lest any man should boast you never created your own faith you know you can't muster up Faith you can't you can have a strong mental attitude you can try to think that it's uh uh Mind Over Matter uh books and things are are written about how that if you can think right you can think straight or you can do this that you can do all things through the the power of the mind uh I believe that even Scientology comes to that point where they feel that if you can think in the right way and you can think in the right attitude and and you can accept approach things in a certain mindset that that will give you Victory and and I don't want that to be my victory if you understand I I want to see God in my life I want to see the hand of God I want to see the Supernatural and I I believe that God expresses his love to us because he gave us exceedingly great and precious promises that by these promises we might be partakers of divine nature so God wants to have fellowship with us God wants wants to be in our lives he didn't set us out and put us in a maze and just say I hope you can wait make your way through this Maze and and figure your way out and acting down life's path you know there's things you should do and things you shouldn't do I I want to get out of the place where my life is in my own hands now that's hard to do it's hard to die to yourself it's hard to die to your feelings it's hard to die to your emotions if it's hard to die to uh not that that self-preservation instinct that we automatically have I always ask myself you know and in my heart I I hear great Heroes and and uh like our law enforcement and First Responders those people that put themselves in In Harm's Way because of a duty to a service I always Marvel when when they the at the trying to assassinate when the uh the gentleman tried to assassinate a president Ronald Reagan how they showed that uh that that secret service agent turning and jumping in front of the president and and taking that uh that uh bullet to stand for his president and that's in the world that courage for something that he believed you know that's not something to mock at because that that's not something to put down you know look I mean we just had a policeman get in a very serious accident right here on our church grounds after the other day A car pulled out in front of him and he ran his motorcycle into him these people possess something you understand they're willing to lay down their lives they're willing to do for their Duty uh and I think that's honorable and I asked myself you know would I do that do I have that within me to to uh if if it came down to Choosing My Life or somebody else's life would I sacrifice my life for their life and yet that's what he did he laid down his life that we could live and so I think it's time that that there's the believer has got to move out of his head into his heart there's got to be another source that's that's moving up from within sight of us the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit that great love that he had no man hath greater love than to lay down his life for another that's that's quite the test wouldn't you say and I haven't had to be put to that test again I I pray that if that challenge ever came to me that there'd be something inside of me that could meet that challenge that I would be so confident that there is a land beyond the river that there be I'd be so confident that there was life after death that I'd be so confident that that that there's no way that a good work would go unrewarded that I know that this life isn't my life that Beyond this realm that I see in that there's a God that lives Kenny wants to be in the Affairs of men he wants to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above that which you can ask or think and there's one Avenue to that and that's by faith it's hard to let go and we battle and we listen to this great explanation of the The Sixth Sense of of what that it is what where it is how that it works what it identifies itself with what it what it what it attaches itself to faith has got to have a resting place it's got to have an absolute it's got to have something that it believes above all other things that this is the reality that that's what it has it can't be Ever Changing like science it can't be Ever Changing like knowledge it can't be Ever Changing like technology if it's real it is it always has been and it always will be and it's not it's not a thought it is a substance faith is the substance it's the evidence of things hoped for not yet seen it's absolutely a possession that you have it within your soul it's something you know you've got you know that's there and it responds it's not governed by time it's not governed by circumstances it's not governed by what you see or what you feel it's something that you've got you've got it you know it's there and it's unmovable and I believe that's the church that God's looking for we know that faith and love are are in unison if I could say that may I don't have the vocabulary but it's a union it's a partnership you can't have one without the other it's an eternal Bond just like doubt and fear right right are tied together and perfect love cast out all fear and lack of fear will give you faith we're striving for this and I think our failure so many times and I'm only preaching to this body this morning those that God I'm not preaching a worldwide sermon and I'm not trying to reach across the Airways and actually just for us that our fellowshipping one with another here in this body to be a burning light and a a shine him out in our daily lives and contact the people that we have contact that they might be able by looking at you and your faith know that he's the same yesterday today and forever that they might inquire of you what is this hope that you have what is this Joy about you what is this peace you have what is this expectation that you've got what is this what is it that you're living for oh I'm living for a land beyond the river amen I know there's a in my father's house her many mansions I would not tell you if it were not so I've got something to live for amen there's a hell to shun and a heaven to gain amen I I'm sold out for what he taught I believe it with all my heart have we know that we have an enemy that goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and I hope this connector in a little bit this morning he's not so much about devouring your flesh but he's a whole lot about devouring your faith he wants to take away your confidence in the Living God just think if he can break that down all he wants you to do is disbelieve the one that can do all things for all things are possible only believe all things are possible the value of faith to the bride in this last hour cannot be overemphasized revelation it can't be over emphasized it we've got to move from the realm of understanding which I believe the word of God is given to be understood I will even sound doctrine that you must have sound Doctrine because that you're you're thinking needs to line up with the word of God but I believe that God with all my heart is trying to give his children the possession of of the the sense that activates the word of God and that where they live by the word of God they think by the word of God they trust in the word of God the word of God becomes a reality because remember Faith doesn't lie amen so if if you would uh uh bear with me this morning and maybe it's not in the Traditions that you would normally do but if you could just listen with me this morning if you would just indulge me in listening to this 30 minutes of the understanding of the difference between faith and senses and what is ruling man and how man has to change his headship to what governs their life there's also in this little 30 minutes a wonderful explanation for those of you who love to study the scriptures of the the the these verses that are some of the most misunderstood verses can as out of the First Corinthians the 12th chapter it says now conspiring concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you be ignorant for ye know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols even as you were LED wherefore I'd give you to understand that no man speaketh by the spirit of God calleth Christ the cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost and that's a very misunderstood scripture because a lot of people say Jesus is Lord a lot of them take his name in vain but there's a deep understanding to that it unfolds in this we won't go into that this morning but I hope that you could pick it up I believe this morning no matter what your background is no matter where you're from the word of God will bless you and and I believe listening to this and this great explanation of how that the word of God has got to come in and govern it and then me as the pastor of this assembly it's my way of this morning to reaching out to all of us to say we need our faith increased we need to start moving and trusting more in the Supernatural this world is slowly turning against the freedoms that we are are having now for the freedom of speech the freedom of religion the freedom those are slowly beginning to erode as man begins to feel that they know what's best we know what's best can you imagine the day that they declare the preaching of Divine Healing as a false hope or you can't you can't speak against the the sins of Solomon Gomorrah because they feel that's degrading another human being can you imagine slowly but surely legally taking your rights to have free speech the scripture tells us the time will come that they will take your life thinking that they're doing God a service can you say oh is there scripture just think Paul went about imprisoning the church in order to rid Israel of this heresy called Christianity can you imagine the religious rulers of our day wanting to rid the Pentecostal experience the born-agained experience the gifts of God of Divine Healing and can the moving of the spirit of God to rid that heresy from the church world oh let me tell you the mark of the beast is in the air amen it's coming soon if it's not already here in a spiritual form so we just trust this morning that your faith that'll contact something in you that you'll see the need for you to possess faith and if you lack Faith cry out this morning Lord help my unbelief help me Lord move more into the realm of faith help me step up higher help me believe your worth help me Lord I'm needy are you needy I need more faith this morning I need to love them more I need to serve them more I can't live in this Wilderness of of of risk dry religious Wilderness any longer I want to move up in the Realms of faith I want to believe for the impossible I want to see him manifested in the Supernatural just Lord bless you this morning as we listen from the sermon called a super sense of 12 27 1959 you say oh that's awful low 59 that's 56 years ago the word of God has never changed I believe if we go back in time we could have heard a sermon very similar to this preached by Paul God bless you this morning I believe it will be a a blessing to you thank you brother Mike senses we are taught that the natural man has five senses in those five senses control his is or give God gave him these five senses to contact his Earthly home and those senses are known as sea taste feel smell here those five senses which are known to the Natural man and they are good and we cannot operate or live a normal life when one of these senses fail to act your sight hearing feelings smelling or tasting we cannot be normal without them there's something missing some potion of life that we cannot contact without that sense acting and they're good and they're useful and they were given to us by God gave those senses but they're given to you as a gift and it depends on how you watch you yield these senses to will be the way that your life is controlled the way you yield those five senses your what you see what you hear what you taste smell our field whatever those senses are yielded to they will dominate you and we are grateful to God that we have the five senses but by no me no Meats was these five senses given to you to guide you they were given to you for Earthly contact but there was giving you the Sixth Sense and that's Sixth Sense is belongs only to the Christian and you cannot have this Sixth Sense until you become a Christian is the only way that you could ever have any more than the five natural senses for the natural person but Sixth Sense is better known to the Christian as faith it's the one that governs and guides you and it is superior to all the other senses it's a superior to all of the senses the other five senses now I would not say that because that we receive the Sixth Sense that the five senses are no good no more yes they are those five senses were given to you by God and they are to be used but when the five senses act contrary to the word of God than they are lying Now The Sixth Sense cannot lie it's a super sense and that's what I want to speak about this morning I spoke on a super sign and tonight on the super sense and the super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you and if you let the five senses be yielded to The Sixth Sense it'll guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of that super sense for it's so far above the natural sense as a spiritual man is above the natural it's as far as high as the heavens is above the natural man and his five senses it makes you believe things that you cannot see it makes you act or you do not think the five senses would ever think about it the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense that's far beyond his reach that come from God it's called faith faith is that great thing and the five senses does not control the sixth sense but the Sixth Sense controls the five senses the super sense controls the natural senses and the these five senses is see tasty of smell here and the super sense is something that will make you believe God's word well that's the only thing it'll speak about and it'll make you believe for things that you can't see tasty you'll smell or hear because it'll take God's word and it will deliver that word to you and make you walk contrary to any other thing there is but God's word by faith Faith doesn't now in giving this illustration of the senses the natural man is born with these senses so they are nature given senses and that's really only thing you'll ever know about it in his intellectual thinking he can only think as the man you can see as a man he can understand as a man here is the man but when he becomes govern are regenerated or we would call it born again then that's six Super sense takes a hold of him in doing so that's super sense raises him up into a spot don't worry yes Faith to believe things that he could not hear things that he could not see understandings that he could not understand he believes it anyhow because he's governed by that Sixth Sense not super sense oh how marvelous it is to know it and to think how simple it is to believe it now you cannot believe it until you are regenerated the Bible said that no man can call Jesus a Christ only by the Holy Ghost we went through that this last week and it's been such a stumbling block especially to the Pentecostal of believing people when they hear me say that Jesus said and Saint John 5 24 he that heareth my word and believeth on him it sent me has eternal life eternal life comes from God Alone and no man can say Jesus is the Christ only by the Holy Ghost you're only taking what somebody else said what you learned by intellectual what you learn by the natural five senses but when the Sixth Sense comes in the Holy Spirit it takes away all the reasons of these six senses and five senses and lifts you up into that sixth sense to make you believe things that you can't see taste does something to you then you can say Jesus is the Christ because you have witnessed it not what intellectual teaching has taught you but what you've experienced what is the sixth sense to do then brother Branham why did The Sixth Sense come The Sixth Sense come for this reason now six senses of Faith the super sense now if the Sixth Sense come for this reason only that was to make the five senses in you deny anything that's contrary to God's word that's what the sixth senses are the scripture speaks of casting down reasons the the fear five senses will you can reason well now why should this man why should but the Sixth Sense doesn't see that at all it's so far beyond it it's so much higher than it is until it don't even have any reasons no with it we believe it far beyond anything that the five senses would have to say about it now get ready for a healing service see we believe it you walk by that Sixth Sense you talk for that Sixth Sense that's Sixth Sense you God I'm about to have Sixth Sense and rise for that sixth sense that's super sense something that's in you that's different from what the natural man is the natural man only has these and they're all right if they can be brought in submission to The Sixth Sense if the natural mind says read the word of God and says that is the word of God is speaking the truth but if it reasons that's not all the word of God or or it was something it was one time but it isn't now then that Sixth Sense comes in and says he's the same yesterday today and forever see that's the difference that's why that so many people fail to be healed they're trying to come with an intellectual conception they say oh I um I do this or I believe this and so forth but if that Sixth Sense is saying that there's nothing you'll ever shake them from that Sixth Sense the Sixth Sense is come upon the human being to make them deny anything that's contrary to the word of God any symptom any symptom that's contrary to God's promise the sixth sense as it is man if the Christian that's born again and the first thing you know is some Infidel unbeliever gets around to the Christian and so now look here there's no such a thing as that Holy Ghost you're just mistaken in that you're crazy if you believe such stuff is that there's no such a thing as it that's success straight to work let me show you in the Bible where you can't receive the Holy Ghost you see I can show you where the disciples are got it but uh but yeah well you say look at the sixth sense of points you always say but he said the promise isn't to you to your children well that meant their children there that didn't mean for you it isn't for you but that Sixth Sense knows better why it's already in you they've said it too late you've already received it people who talking there is no such thing as the Holy Spirit don't know what they're talking about like a boy once peeling an apple and was asked by the Infidel debating a meeting he said what do you want what do you want up here he said I'm going to ask you a question while he was eating the apple and enjoying it a very simple sort of a look like a delinquent person with the hair hanging in his face and one tooth out in front of an old dirty overhaul jacket on he said just one question I want to ask you the infidelity just said there is no such a thing as God it's all emotion is nonsense to it is all it is and the boy said I want to ask you a question Mister is this apple sweeter sour is it a hard-on or I'm not eating it he said that's just what I thought walked right back how do you know when you haven't tasted the Lord how do you know when you've never received the Holy Ghost whether he's real or whether he is not how do you know where there's faith and power how do you know there's not Giants speakable and full of Glory when you've never tasted to see it The Sixth Sense leads you to them The Sixth Sense declares that to you there's no intellectual Powers at all I'll ever bring that to you the intellectual Powers will reason and say well it's psychology it's something this way it's emotion with the people but when the Sixth Sense comes in it denies all of those sayings and moves the person straight into the bosoms of God either come to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him by Faith by faith Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jacob all by faith it's the Sixth Sense that does it Sixth Sense denies all Simpsons all symptoms anything contrary to God's word any feeling emotion somebody say oh well I was praying for but I just don't feel any better six cents would never stand still for that Sixth Sense and say it's a lie better I'm getting well God said Soul that's settled River amen Plum said so Sixth Sense only feeds on the word of God that's super sense it's super above the senses it's a greater sense it's a faith it's a power that stares and drives Hallelujah amen it's something that makes you do things that you never thought you would do it's the Sixth Sense the super Saints you get prayed for it say you got a hand you get prayed for your hand you come up there and you believe that God's going to heal you the pastor prays for you you go back the old natural man will say this you don't feel any different in that hand you're no better than what she ever was but the Sixth Sense comes along and said that's a lie you've been prayed for that settles it yeah amen like a woman to come to a meeting one time and she come to your meeting to him they crossed the platform they'd seen the discernments them women were just just swallowed up they were both real Christians one come up and not Spirit came and said you are suffering with a stomach trouble utter Pace lit up she said that's true ah and the Holy Spirit said to me said and it's an ulcer it's caused from a nervous condition you've been examined by a certain Doctrine he said that you could not have that I had to have an operation to have it cut out she said every word of that is the truth and then seen she's such a great believer then it said your name is Miss so and so you come from so and so in such and such a place she said that is the truth what was it the Sixth Sense catching it amen the sixth sense in the Holy Spirit was standing side by side the Holy Spirit was speaking The Sixth Sense was saying amen here it is something has to happen when Martha run out to find Jesus I want you said Lord what's the sixth sense if thou would have been your my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you there's the Sixth Sense Jesus pulled himself together and said I am the resurrection in life he that believeth in need though he worked dead yet shall he live whosoever live with them believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this what are you going to say reasoning there's a man laying on a dead and the worms is crawling through him but he's just got to say he was the resurrection and the life it's God's word that's Sixth Sense beyond the doctor's care beyond the thoughts of scientific research they found to find all reasonings and cast them down wow it's witness into God's word I am I not a will be how I was I am now I'm in the resurrection of life amen he that believeth in me though he were dead yet he shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this he said since I believe that you are the Son of God that should come into the world my brother shall rise again oh my God to the Grave they went them two together something had to happen that was a super sense with god-standing presence something had to take place the sense was super sense was God there was something telling Martha that she'd seen him she knowed him she didn't recognize him to be the very Messiah and she note if she could only get to him she could only get close to him and present the case just share one promise come from me that's all she wanted when he said I am the resurrection wife ye that believeth in me though he were dead that's all Martha wanted to hear oh she won't even cause the sixth sense to Super sense her faith was moving her to confessing believe him this woman when she left the platform it was thus saith the Lord go home and eat Jesus Christ makes you well she went home that night a friend of hers living in the neighborhood was stirred her forth behind her she had a big knot on her neck and here she come all thrilled about their our neighbor it was going to be healed that ulcer that had bothered her so much this is one of the hundreds of cases thousands of them and this big knot sticking out on her neck and she come up I said no one would have to discern that but you're happy about something you've been thrilled because that woman sitting over Yonder is a neighbor of yours Holy Spirit she thought how in the world could that man know that it has to be something to reveal it to you so when that was sin he said you're thinking about your neck yes do you believe it or leave I believe it she said with all my heart I said thus saith the Lord go home and you will receive your healing the natural man looked around and couldn't see no sign the woman with the ulcer went home and tried to eat in my she liked to died all the natural man the natural sense of feeling still declared the answer there so after about a week or two had passed she went to the neighborhood to all of her people in the church testifying the Lord has healed me and they said are you eating now no not exactly everything I want but she said I'm already healed for by his stripes I am healed no matter what well she's even anyhow one morning the children had gone to school and she got real hungry she was standing washing the dishes by the window she came to the meeting another meeting about a year later and she was washing the dishes and when she first thing she felt a real funny feeling go over and she thought what was that felt like I wanted to scream and her husband had told her said honey you quit talking about that healing that because although he was a Christian said you're bringing a reproach upon the calls how far into his word you'll bring a reproach if you don't testify that if you were healed you were healed she said that man stood and looked me in the eye and told me my conditions and the things that I had done and who I was and where I come from she said I hadn't been in the building 15 minutes when he come to the platform how in the world could this man know that I never saw him in my life and he told me that saith the Lord you're healed and she said I'll believe it until I'm dead he said I don't believe it anyhow so her and her sister a blower a friend had Covenant to God that they'd hold that pain that morning she felt real funny and a few minutes she got hungry so the children had left some oats in a plate a little dish and said oh it's always just burn her up if anybody ever had an officer you know what it is so she reached down and took a couple of nights of those oats oh my she said I have to pay for it I suppose but one of these days I'll be all right but she noticed she was still hungry so she just finished up the dish she waited a few minutes see what happened nothing happened felt good still hungry she fried her a couple eggs and poured her a cup of coffee and got some toast and had her real Jubilee she just eat all she could eat you want to help washing the dishes in about a half hour later she was hungry again no ill effects she put on her little Bonnet and down the street she went into this neighbor's house and when she got there she heard she thought they'd been a death baby in her family they were screaming and shouting and walking around the woman had slept late that morning and got up and far the growth that was on her neck and it had disappeared during the night it wasn't God at work up here title Tabernacle when we had that meeting that crippled boy that come in there was prayed for him many of us are to see him they brought him back in that emergency room Billy led me to him they had him on a platform for three or four nights they're on the in the building he didn't get a prayer card so they put him in the emergency room I went in and prayed for him looked at him he said Mr Branham can you tell me some consolation I said yes sir son polio got you this way he said that's right I said your name is such and such and come from a certain place that's right he said he said what about my healing I said by his stripes you were healed yeah he went home testifying giving God praise and he brought such a reproach they claim in the neighborhood until one Sunday a group of ministers come in and sit down by him and said you must stop doing that you're bringing a reproach upon the calls and the young man sitting there said mister if you were setting where I am if you were in the chair that I'm sitting in you would try to rob me of the last hope I got in Christ that by his stripes I am healed and you know lord said that sitting there paralyzed hands body back and the whole war that he's setting that in out of the Chariot glorifying God what his natural senses said he'll sit there the doctor said he'll be there forever or as long as he lives but the sixth sense says by his strike I am healed and he wouldn't have nothing to do it's casting way everything contrary to what God Said that's what the Sixth Sense is for that's what we need you know you can get lost in in so many things the Mysteries like Paul said though I understand all the Mysteries though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and I have not charity then it profits me nothing and and so many things are unprofitable the scripture tells us because it's not mixed with faith faith is contrary to reason faith is contrary see faith is now getting contrary to society it's contrary to civilization it's contrary to education it's it's contrary to everything and it it sets you apart and that's where there's coming the time there's coming a time there's going to be a separation between the sheeps and the goats and it's not by intellect is by what pleases God it's by faith is that that's something that's in you that says this is what the word says it doesn't matter how I feel how I think but I see what I taste in everything it it latches on to the word of God and calls everything contrary to it a liar this is the identity of the church because we know in the beginning the fall when Eve fell what she did is she disbelieved the word of God Satan got her to reason he said the day that I eat thereof is the day that you'll die he says no you won't die you won't die if you if you eat this tree you'll be like God you'll you'll have knowledge you'll you'll know all things you will you will you will you know he says if you if you do this you will you will there there he planted that seed of reasoning and unbelief because she just couldn't stay with it she had to let another thought come in another idea another voice something else another influence she got to thinking about it she got the reasoning about it oh well you know am I supposed to do this and am I supposed to do that and and it could just got her all stirred up in her mind and everything and and so she just she accepted Satan's lie as God's truth she let go of that she let go of that faith and took reasoning and then you know something what he said came to pass you will you will well now we're here we're living in the fruits of the tree of knowledge Forever Learning and never coming to the realization of God never coming to seeing the supernatural to believe for something we only want to believe for the things that we understand we only want to believe for the things that we can have a concept of how that they will come to pass how many times have you designed your own miracle I designed my own Miracle all the time if this would happen and that would happen and this would happen then God could do it and I'll give God God do it this way if you just give brother such and such a common such and such would do this and such and such would do that and you put this all together and I'll have a miracle Faith doesn't go by what it sees it goes by what he said now here we are we're living in the fruits of the tree of knowledge everything that Satan promised her if she would leave faith is here but now he's supposed to have a new Eve a new bride a new church a new restorated believer and she's got to go right back through that tree of life that tree excuse me that tree of knowledge got to go right back through it back to the beginning to get the faith that she said when she spoke it he said that's what she had she said the day that we eat is the day we die that's what he says and she got talked out of it well this whole world today is designed through education through science through civilization through the news through everything that you're hearing and everything to take that same Faith she had in the beginning that's what's got to be restored back to the church he said so that's the way it is Faith does not lie it's the end of the story but now we gotta socially fit things in you can't preach against homosexuality it's socially not right it is a sin and it is a spirit and it can be cast out and people can be delivered from it but don't ever tell me that it's God's way of life it's death I get phone calls so if you keep preaching like that they'll put you in prison praise God I'll preach to them and there they can get delivered everything is to get you to use your mind instead of your heart [Music] because faith loves God's word it's connected in the heart it's not connected in the mind when you hear it something on the inside of you says I love his word I love his scriptures I love what he said I believe it they teach them there's three gods they teach them this they teach them all that stuff the word of God hasn't changed boy you couldn't preach wives being subject to their husband he'd empty out the churches that you get a sister that's subject to your husband that's one happy sister she's got the joy bells ringing she knows God's gonna take her her husband might be Dumber in a mud fence but if she believes God's word God will take care of her God's word works everything else fail s it's been failing wars and rumors and Wars diseases they can't get control of this chaos there's only one way out then that's a promise of God's word look up your Redemption is near I have gone to prepare a place for you if it were not so I would not tell you I'll come again and receive you that where I am you may be also Hallelujah what happened to believe in that what happened if not taken no thought for tomorrow you know sometimes their sisters get so worried whether they get going to get married well you get worried you don't look very pretty quit worrying put this joy of the Lord on your heart a real Son of God will fall in love with you because you're going to fall in love for you for the right thing you don't got to go join Jenny Craig for five months to get married need to get the Holy Ghost I'm serious what doesn't do us good to go on in an intellectual concept just keep going over the Mysteries keep going over the history keep prove it I don't need to prove to any of you that God sent a Prophet this day he proved it himself but what did he come for was it to educate Us in the church ages wasn't to educate Us in the seals it wasn't the educators of the godhead it wasn't education it was the restoration of the faith that our brothers and sisters had that accepted them in the beginning that could believe in miracles could believe in the Supernatural and it was free it wasn't take you in the back room and say Well if you really believe then you'll give a two thousand dollar seed offering we're not going to send you up there on the platform to be prayed for if you can't demonstrate for to us that you believe First by giving a seed offering oh you don't think that goes on it's exactly what goes on I like the way God gives it Hallelujah he says you sir you're suffering with such and such you've been through something you're healed that's saith the Lord by his stripes you are healed free of charge don't need no gimmicks this world's dying for the true gospel God sent the true gospel in this age I'm not ashamed of Malachi 4 5. Luke 17 30. Revelations 10 7 because it's the promised word of God come to pass on this day and it's the only thing that's going to return rapturing Faith back to the church [Music] I want to get raptured yes and it's the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwelt in you it will also Quicken your mortal body get rid of all the stuff get rid of all the gossip get rid of talking about one another start believing God's word let the love of God be shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit back to God's word back to Faith back to Faith not to reasoning back to believing I like what he said he says faith will let you believe for things that you can't hear smell touch see taste or seed it'll let make you do things you never thought you could even do we almost only believe God if the if he works through a doctor I believe in doctors go to a doctor I believe it but when that doctor says it's all over don't you let us in there sorry doc appreciate you you did all it all you could I thought I'd give you a try I know you got to make money you didn't do this Because You Loved Me you did it because my insurance company patient 10 times what you're worth but that's okay I'm all for you but I want to tell you one thing before I walk out the door Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and by his stripes I am healed and and if if the skin worms eat my flesh yet I'll see God King live forever may you prosper and be in good health but I'm not going to duck but thou bound to that Idol and my God's more than able to save me but I still won't Bow Down Into the Fire they went oh we want the we want that Fourth Man to be there before the fire he's always in the fire he comes in the fire he comes in a pillar of fire he comes with a baptism of fire he's in the fire God's in the fire almost oh I just don't know how to say it sometimes we just get to thinking that the only Miracle is is it was when we don't have no trouble kind of Miracles that if he ain't after you he's got you if he ain't trying to steal your faith that means you ain't got no faith yeah he wants to steal your faith for your faith is his defeat he's defeated by your faith his plan is defeated his Kingdom's defeated everything's defeated by your faith [Music] true oh I wish we could have a mind transplant I think I can get knees I can get hips you can get almost anything replaced right when we need is a heart replacement we need a mind replacement we need to go back to Faith how simple is faith what he said is the truth faith is given right right the reason he gave Faith The Sixth Sense for one reason and one reason only to deny everything that's contrary to the word of God I don't care if he's got a Roman collar on I don't care if he's got a PhD lld when I went up to Seeley Lake I remember when I sat there and talked to the general of the great Regional General thing of the Baptist church and we talked water baptism oh he's a doctor so and so and so but you know one thing Dr so-and-so couldn't do he couldn't find baptism in any other way than in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Bible oh he went to the Greek you know can he got this Greek scholar and before long he was he was quoting aristotles and and Apollo and all these unbelievers you know why wasn't the God's word right just hold them to God's word one name we're in a man to be saved one name one name there's no other name given under a heaven all things that you do do in the name of the Lord all things but water baptism you pray in his name you repent in his name but not that finally he got so frustrated he says well the bible really don't care how you baptize the Bible don't care that's exactly what you believe sir you need to be borned again you need to have the Holy Spirit faith it's faith if God be for you who can be against you the gift of God to you is faith he'd put a seed it's in you he give it to you he's given you something to believe with you're not going to get these people out here to believe that God's going to heal that God can deliver that's Supernatural things can happen that that things Beyond reasoning in fact if you even step out by faith they think you're a fool but faith is is a gift of God because Enoch had this testimony before he was translated he pleased God can Paul goes on to explain without faith it was impossible may I read it like this without faith it was impossible for Enoch to please God because Enoch believed that God was and a rewarder of him that diligently sought him yeah Church in your life in your prayer start building your faith you're not too old to believe you're not too young to Believe come back to Faith faith the statue of a perfect man is founded on faith faith believe what God's words whatever it is it is God's word doesn't need to be explained it wasn't written to be explained it was written to believe catch all God's word was written for it is to believe how is he going to do it I don't know when is he going to do it I don't know why is he going to do it I don't know but he said he was in that settles it have faith you believe also in God believe also in me Jesus said have faith Lord bless you this morning let's dance [Applause] let's don't be hearers of the word please don't be here as a word but let's be doers of the word doer of the word start believing start believing you got something in your life something in your heart you know you wouldn't even ask God to forgive you if you didn't believe him he wouldn't if you got a sin working in your life a sin that so easily beset you can't you believe he can deliver you from that the very fact that you know what's wrong right the very fact that you know that you have it that you're not doing right ought to be able to tell you I'm not doing right I need to be delivered how am I going to be delivered are you going to get a Deliverance program I'm not going to do this I'm not going to do that I'm not going to do this and then pretty soon he just tricks you right back into it and there you are doing it again you don't even know how you got there you know how you got there you never got healed you never asked him to heal you you never ask him to take it from you you never took your faith and took it from intellectual and take took it and attached it to a scripture you've got to take what you're believing for and attach it to a scripture you've got to have a he said he said when you have a he said there's one thing God can't do he can't lie in every good and perfect thing comes from him above so when you can take it and you can say when you can say you got a wayward loved one when you can take that Wayward love and then you can come back here and says God said to you give me my house [Music] when he said they let the unbelieving I might have a good conversation that she might win the unbelieving husband once you got word once you got word Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word won't pass away once you've got word that's the one thing Satan can't do even when Jesus he is tempted Jesus Jesus never come up with who he was he didn't need to he knew who he was but he knew what defeated Satan every time and it was the word he said it is written it is written it is written thank you I want to ask you this morning is your life attached to the word are you going to the word of God when that word speaks to your heart are you attaching your faith to it I said I believe this Lord I believe my healing I don't feel it I feel terrible I'm worse than I've ever been but you said but you said and I like that woman she says I'm going to believe it till I die [Music] nothing's going to shake me he said so he said so that settled that's about our heads ask you this morning [Music] are you a little detached from God's word [Music] maybe your faith isn't where you want it to be here [Music] maybe you just find it hard to believe because you're looking at all the symptoms you're looking at all the circumstances but if you could just Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus and just say Lord You're the creator of Heaven and Earth and there's nothing you can't do and I want to believe you this morning I want a renewing of my faith I want to rededicate my life father to you this morning that I could come back to where I believed your word foreign [Music] and that anything that's contrary to your word I call it is not so the only reality I have is your word perception is not a reality God's word is reality whether I see it whether I hear it whether I feel it whether I taste it whether I feel it doesn't matter Lord I want to believe what you said I want to hang on to it and I want to confess it John Ryan sitting in that barber chair mock for days finally he said it for the probably the hundredth time in the week
