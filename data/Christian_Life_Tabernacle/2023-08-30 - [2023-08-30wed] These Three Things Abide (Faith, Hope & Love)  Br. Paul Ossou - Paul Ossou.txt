your people [Music] as we have nothing because reflect woman that it may be you Lord through us coming to the demand as we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] [Music] let's open in the Book of Luke Luke chapter 8 in Long lecture it's going to be a long reading Luke with a party University current Luke chapter 8 verse 40. and he came to pass when Jesus was returned the people gladly receive him for they were all waiting for him foreign [Music] and behold there came a man Jairus and it was a ruler of the synagogue and it fell down at Jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his house [Music] he had one dog he had one only daughter about 12 years age she is dying but it was but he went to the people thoroughly attempted universities and a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which had spent all her living up on Physicians neither could be healed of anybody [Music] um came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and he meet and immediately her issue of blood's strange and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter and they that were within and said Master multitude trunk tree and and pristine and saying thou who touched me and Jesus said somebody had touched me for I perceived that virtue is gone out of me declaration and when the woman saw that she was not here she came trembling and falling down before him and declared she declared him before all the people that for that was caused she had touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good Comfort thy faith has made thee whole go in peace while he was yet spake they came one from the ruler of the synagogue's house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not to master synagogue but when Jesus heard it he had answered him saying fear not believe only and she she shall be made whole lot and when he had come unto the house he suffered no man to go in save Peter James John and the father and the mother of the maiden I'm going to go to verse 54 and he put He put them all out and took her by the hand and called saying made arise it's an experience and their Spirit came again and she arose straight away and he commanded to give her meat alone we're going to take First Corinthians chapter 13. thank you Peter in First Corinthians chapter 13. it's the chapter of love is a synonym it's uh the theme of tonight uh news we'll go to verse 12. foreign for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known respirons and now abided faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity deal let's pray we bless your Holy Name we write your words for the people that know how to read message [Music] may you give us to it tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen my subject tonight it's a verse 13 of of chapter 13 of First Corinthians and these three things abide it says these three things abide La Foie faith lamu faith hope Faith love Faith love and charity that's what the Bible is telling us if we want to talk about the love of God like the poet said that if we took all the oceans and we fill them all up together and if we took the skies and they were parchments and every man was a writer and then every every every uh tree was a pen okay and every one of us will sit down to write the love of God it said that the oceans will dry the sky will be filled we're not even not going to finish up all of the the the descriptions the Lord I placed on my heart the subject uh it looks like I lost my house but it's okay the Lord will lead me okay I deleted it as I was looking at it the demonstrations last Sunday we were really blessed God and foreign but it's God who sought us to save us to to help us to attract us to him to bring us to be in His image in his resemblance that's the love of God the Bible says love God so loved the world that he gave sufficiently his only begotten son the world didn't do anything the the world didn't ask for anything but God so loved the world says when you go out or you look at all of those that didn't believe on the millions and billions of people but it's to you that God came to you it's to you that God reflect his love to attracted to attract you to him to make of you his son or his daughter foreign let's go to perfect faith paragraphs paragraph 132. perfect faith says and when we were Sinners alienated without God without God Don Lemon dollar salute in the world in the mark in the mud as I talked about this morning God came to us God sought us you never sought God no man can come to me except my father draws him first and God came down in the mark where where you were here it's God who came in the mark where you were he didn't look at our condition he reflected his love he came in that Mark is he is he sought you out and he brought you out so like David that are to create a perfect love look at what you was and look at what you are what did that somebody that loved you Allah for me can't you have faith in what is Promised You then how can you not have faith for what he promised you real genuine love will create confidence in his word we were bad don't listen in the mark in his great love he made us what we are confused on me so we can have more confidence in him that everything that he promised he's able to fulfill it foreign paragraph 133 he caught me when I was nothing I'm still nothing that's speaking that's why it's astonishing or um when you see a servant of God he said he's saying that it's big it's only him that God hears because you please when I pray God hears me and if it's by the grace of God all the glory belonged to him because he loved me because of his great love it he made of me his servant this is your prayer to chill if I can be useful cut about yourself when we talk about a servant is someone who serves is not a king says is the one who serves it's the one whom the servant is serving to he's the one who asked and say I want this if they bring it I said I'm a Son of God I'm sick God said that you are a servant that you may serve me pray for me foreign you are working for somebody the glory is for the one that you work for because you are nothing and you were nothing it's only by the grace of God said somewhere I don't have the the quote here I believe it's in the image of Christ says when you see a servant of God or a preacher and he says all the time and he's wanting you to help him he's not gonna try to bring attention on himself but on his master says he caught me when I was nothing I'm still nothing but I mean his hands he he caught me he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you when you were unlovable May evil that transformed me but he changed you there just like the color the colored sister said that that time in her testimony it is she said I'm not what I ought to be she knew she had come somewhere something happened we have such a great desire to be like Jesus to have the love that Jesus had and but sometimes we we fail but we know that we know that we are not what we used to be because that we have made some ways and we have to have confidence the one who took us from nothing that he will be faithful to take us where he wants us to be he says okay she she comes she comes somewhere something happened and that's it that's in the that's in the way it is and he says when it says and if God when I was alienated from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up don't confuse those disease that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he seen something in you if God came to find you and to bring you to church tonight it's because he saw something in you because she wants to do something in you [Music] no one can take your place and no one can take your place no one can take you out of that place even if a preacher comes and shows you that with what you did you're gonna go to hell you say Jesus Loves Me He has a purpose for me to do Larry where he placed me surely I have confidence in him no one can take my place I know that I'll get there no one can take your place he says you are in the economy of God they have certainly Fair no one can do it it is love towards you hello then [Music] what you love Want Your Love reach back to him saying it says and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is circumstances is governed by this love that creates that the Lord this love that creates the faith God give with them then when God loves you and you love God and you love one another that brings the faith all right then he can't keep from bringing out just exactly what God promises what creates the faith in you it's the love that God has towards us it's what God has done for us it's what God has done through us and because of that love comes the book like this great uh hymn that we sing Oh I love him I love him because he first loved me it's because he first loved me when I was unlovable that would love him back that I have confidence in him that I have faith that he loved me when I didn't ask when I ask him something he's going to give it to me because of that love the the Christian walk is a love story it doesn't work by itself This Love companies we were in Corinthians that these three things abide love less parents Hope and Faith I'm sorry in love faith hope and charity they abide together so when Jesus came on Earth says that Peter represented Faith John represented charity is and and uh James represented hope so First Corinthians 13 tells us that that uh Peter John and James they are the three things that remains and we read the story of Jesus as he was on the way Jesus who was the love of manifested who was the love made flesh as he was on the way Jairus came to him he says oh Jesus I want you to come to my place because my my young daughter who's 12. she's she's uh terribly healed and she's she's ready to die and as Jesus was still looking at Jairus case and as Jesus was manifesting his love with all this power there's this a woman who came by behind yeah and he went and he touched the the the the His Garment and there were many people that were touching Jesus even to the point when Jesus asked the question who touched me Peter Peter rebuked him he said but everybody's touching you come on what do you mean somebody touch it means the way of touching it was not the same God when we come to the Lord we are not touching him the same way this woman who lost all her belongings this woman who had nothing she spent all the money to doctors solution got the life anniversary but when she came to Jesus there was no scripture it is like a constitution about this but if you touch his mental you will be healed but she had a revelation maybe she said to herself that if I come before him they're gonna reject me if I extreme maybe they're gonna push me to the side but I know good sister but this man he has all the power of God my way of approaching these two features that all I need is because I have no way to talk to him he's still working on Jairus case silver I'll just touched and when she touched him yeah The Virtue came out of Jesus she didn't touch like everybody else and that's how God wants us to approach him my testimony is not the same as the brothers my testimony is not the same as the sister's testimony she has a testimony with God others with her way to approach God he has a testimony with God but all God is for us to realize that the love that he had for us that in return we have confidence in him that if he was able to love me when I was a prostitute to love me when I was smoking dope to love me when I was drinking alcohol he loved me he attracted me to him if he did it without me asking foreign it's a love that attracts faith says be beyond the curtain of time it says faith brings us before the canal but it's the law that gets us in life that Jesus he he put parentheses around Jairus he looks at the woman yeah he projected his love says in uh uh projecting his love projecting is all he says uh uh uh uh paragraph 13. it says that love that God had love is a powerful force amen and when love is projected and it comes to the end of his strength Sovereign Grace will take it and put it from there love is a powerful force it and when we come to the end the end train coming from like this woman with a blood issue you explained everything that she has she came to the end of her strength she came close to love and when she came to the end of her strength that love was projected to her and she received her healing and he comes to the end of his strength he says Sovereign Grace will take it and put it from there and project and project the object that love has asked for that's the reason we have a savior tonight is because God so loved the world that he that he is love being projected to the world produce a savior God wanted to see you well so much he loved when you were out in the and and it's produced an atonement for your sickness and as your as your sins it was the love of God that constrained him to do it [Music] God wants to see you well regardless of the situation that you find yourself when you come closer to the god of love he will protect his love and Sovereign Grace will give you what you have need of [Music] your daughter is already dead your daughter is dead Jesus said don't worry Jairus your daughter is not dead I love you let's go cause there is when Jesus gets to Jairus place the house was full of unbelievers were full of people that were lamenting oh my situation oh it's like God that's in here is over there taking care of the temple he only has one daughter and now she's dead what is he gonna do now oh we are crying when Jesus comes the Bible says he says Jesus asked for all those people to go out who did they leave yeah Peter for Faith John love Zach James let's put on Hope he said you come with me you come with me because with you if I have love in my heart if I have faith in myself if I have hope nothing will stand before me [Applause] yes Jesus remove all unbelief that was in the room all the fear that was there all the doubts that was around he brought Faith he brought hope and he brought love he continued and when they get in even if it comes to the end of his strength this love of God with faith it was going to be projected to give what is being asked for that's Jesus in Jairus Jesus was to spend a difficult time Matthew 24. and get some money Jesus he took all his disciples they came and he realized that there was Thomas there was Philip it was a difficult time they're not going to help me he said wait for me here he says Peter James John John come with me you want to teach me something [Music] all thy diseases take me out of this place he can do it today he can do it tomorrow but he can do it the day after tomorrow but between all this time all those three things has to abide Peter James and John have to be at your side faith hope and charity you keep love because that because of his great love he made me what I am today there's nothing else that can stand before his love sometimes we don't realize the love of God we don't realize what God has done for us sometimes even in a simple way compared to personally how many people were born at the same time as we and how many have gone why is God kept us it is love well not here we didn't do anything person don't know no none of us it's not even know that after this service that we're gonna get home so when we leave church we get home it is love it is Grace and if he does it every day is able because of that love to give us all that we have made of yeah my um and when Jesus was to be glorified in the moment of Glory in the time of blessing where God places you upon the mountains where you are a happy from day till night who did you bring Peter James and John let's go to the mountain in traffic Transfiguration faith hope and charity the Bible says these three things abide but the great the the greater of all those things it's charity and if we have to talk about love it's a great subject and if God loved us why can we not love our neighbor if God gave me his grace to take me out of the muck foreign izing him but foreign when he's talking about uh uh uh uh love brightly love it says in that situation I put myself at the brother's place I put myself at the sister's place if I am in the same situation as that person how would I want to be treated to be helped you and that's what God is trying to bring us to California talks about the vision that he had uh uh beyond the curtain it says on the other side it was only perfect love it is I am very convinced that nothing else will enter in if not perfect love that God will give us that by his grace even when we get to move mountains we'll know that it's only by the love of God but the thing that we have to look for but the thing that will get in is perfect love when I was reading First Corinthians chapter 13 it was almost like a scandal the Bible says because your problem is it that I can give all like all my goods to the poor but if I don't have love thank you I give all my goods everything I have but I don't have love What is love it's God what replaced in us God in our hearts just to manifest God manifested in us if I move mountains if I don't have love if I that means if I don't have godam says don't you see uh yeah what do without here he says Grande men and women can grow up and watch you along some powers [Music] man and woman can grow up shouting praising God speaking in tongues and belonging to the church dancing in the spirit and paying the tithes still not be in their heart that still small voice of God's Rich deep love though I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice and have not loved I'm nothing cause your distributed though I give all my goods to feed the poor I'm still nothing I have faith to move mountains I'm still nothing I do speak with tongues of men and angels I'm still nothing it's that it it's that still Small Voice that speaks down in the heart that changes every attitude makes the nature different universe and you become a new creature in Christ yeah he says in perfect faith paragraph 123. you didn't know notice now to point elementary perfect faith is the master of all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters yes watch when you believe anything do anything foreign no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it if it's in the room of sickness and the Lord reveals that this certain things is going to happen you just speak and go on that's that just don't ask any questions it's already over just just keep going forever a masters all circumstances well if you do this so and so until the fair and going and so and so forever you see it's already got it's it's already got it mastered but I got something paragraph 125 la [Music] [Music] because you can't have faith unless you got love Pastor convertible because your faith is in a god who's the very essence of love Faith and love works together we can't have uh perfect uh faith without love we can have faith to move mountains when there's no love I'm nothing because this faith without love is able to curse his brother I have the power to make you blind but when you have love going forward that God told him one day that he was going to have a a a trial but he didn't know what was the trial what was the the Temptation he comes to church there was two uh young uh uh people that were kissing one another he had the power yeah the first thing that came was you can curse them may God hit them it was the trial I told you give them forgiveness close a perfect faith Divine love you paragraph 173 verse 72. he speaks about the story of the possum Eddie he said um and the old person with a with a leg so full of maggots and and so directed behind her swell twice its size stood up on that leg picked up those babies it's in a pocket he said walk down walk down through their just as normal as any Beast ever seen walk turn around to me [Music] as is as if to turn around and say thank you kind sir so far that I know it says they are they are real happy with their babies today why because when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes its place my brother my sister there is only one there's only there's only got one thing to do in your life there's only one God one there's only sorry this only got one thing to do in your life that's love the Lord your God vote with all your heart with all your soul with all your strength and with all your mind and believe that every word that he has said is the truth and when you come to the end of your road and when you can't go any further Allah then Divine like gratitis Sovereign Grace will be projected [Music] that we cannot go any further because of that love God will project his grace the musicians can come it is many people think I I live in mysterious life the only thing I can tell you I don't have a mysterious life but I have love it's love that brings me I think to to show us to conquer everything it's love that brings me I need you to bring God In Action my brother my sister God is asking us tonight with all our thinking our mind to believe his word that everything that he promised is able to bring it apart and when it will come [Music] that we lose all our strength that we don't have any hope he's not going to leave us alone he will protect his grace he will project his power he will take us out of that situation because it's his promise God comes most time when we lose hope you can't understand when we don't know what to do something like the woman with a blood issue they are very deposited she spent all that she had members so even if they told her now that oh there is another better doctor over there she had nothing no money to go give another period She had no hope foreign who was there for years after years he had no one to to place him in that to put him in this in the pool it was a dark hour for him he had no hope but God projected his love the Bible tells us about Jairus who lost his daughter his only daughter every three days before he had no hope it showed that when he went back to his house when he saw everybody cry but thank you foreign [Music] he had no hope but when he didn't have no strength love projected his grace God is always there to project this grace because he loved us so much when we had nothing when we were just sinners you know that he attracted us he gave us the grace to believe this message [Music] will he be not will it be impossible for him to help us with everything we have in life what is your problem that you think is not Ableton what is your burden that you think is not able take the love of God take Faith I keep hope [Music] thank you it's very our gracious father [Music] surely words would fail as low to describe who you are Lord the only place we know how to stand is on the grace that you've extended Lord that we may be called Sons and Daughters to you Lord [Music] to have brought us from all kinds of places or garden watches for all our sins and everything and made a way that we could be called sons and daughters father God we pray tonight for the words always spoken thank you Lord let it sink deep within our hearts and create the faith and the love that we have need of Lord and that we may go out of here no matter how we came in to know that God has got my situation under control [Music] your Prophet will say if you would care about the little fish and you will give it life back how much more you Hallelujah you say if you will dress in the birds of the sky you'll give them the food how much more are we Lord thank you Lord Lord you've given us such a special place sometimes we forget to realize that you forgive our unbelief or God and fill us with your love and faith tonight Lord that we may go out of here knowing that the Lord is my savior the Lord is my light and my salvation I shall not want the Lord is the strength of my life no matter what happened the Lord is with me Lord Healing The Sick and Afflicted no matter what the need is whether we Financial spiritual natural Lord and father we pray that love may fill our hearts as we go out of here to know that the Lord is going to take care of it because he promised you'll do it we thank you for the word and thank you we commit ourselves back to you Lord and we invite you to just come even now move upon the hearts of your people Lord and help us that we may be better Christians than what we are lorded that the love of God that was projected may be reflected in our daily lives Lord and that we may live happily knowing that the Lord has got everything under control we thank you we ask you bled up you bless our brother Paul and father the word that he came in the inspiration you give him to come and bring the word Lord that we may receive it and let it fall on
