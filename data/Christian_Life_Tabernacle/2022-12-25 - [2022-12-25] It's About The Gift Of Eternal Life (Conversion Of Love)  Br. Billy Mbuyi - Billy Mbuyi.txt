you do for us we pray in Jesus name amen until your closest neighbor Merry Christmas God bless you as we remember the mic for for some reason Merry Christmas Merry Christmas everyone I didn't get a chance to tell anyone on my way in so I'm just telling you all hey man you know Christmas is just thinking about it the other night you know Christmas is probably one of the most globally recognized and celebrated holidays of the year I don't know that they may celebrate it in different ways and you know focus on different things but pretty much don't have to tell anybody what Christmas is everybody knows what Christmas is and you know most folks have at least heard some version of the story if for no other reason than they've seen decorations somewhere they're vaguely aware that it involves a baby that was born and you know even if that's all they know that's you know certainly well enough for them to build a worldwide holiday around you know I got to thinking about that and what's interesting is in spite of how popular Christmas is today at the time that great event happened almost nobody noticed you know they what's recognized by everyone today back then it was just another day nobody had any idea that there was any work of God being done in their midst outside of the handful of folks that the Lord chose to make it known it was you know nobody saw any difference in their day or in the things that they worried about or their day-to-day lives you know and you know it's even more interesting is even when a group came and directly questioned a king you know about where this was supposed to happen the religious leaders of the day you know we're very very quick to be able to say well this is what's supposed to happen but they still didn't recognize it was happening you know it wasn't a globally televised streamed event that everybody saw and was aware that a birth had happened and that a work of God was underway they just didn't recognize it they just didn't know it you know they came and went about their normal lives as anybody does you know and really from the moment of his appearing back 2000 years ago until the moment that he gave his life on a cross really except again just for a handful of folks it went totally unnoticed you know I think that you know brings to mind some of the things that brother Branham preached things like the presence of God unrecognized things like one in a million and you know I was just thinking about here you have Christmas with the whole world celebrating this great event but outside of the hand of God nobody noticed what he did you know and I was just you know thinking about that and we turned to Psalm 85 this morning was a reading Psalm 85 and here you have the witness of the sons of Korah a group of people among the Israelites and if you read as we read that chapter this morning they are truly laying out the work that God was to do in the Earth even hundreds of years before it even happened and you have a people that are able to perceive and to see what his hand would do even when all those that lived in the day that it actually happened were not aware that anything was happening you know if we look at a few of the verses he says verse 2 thou Hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou has covered all their sin thou has taken away all thy Wrath thou has turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger turn us o God of our salvation verse 8 I will hear what God the Lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people this could almost be them witnessing the event that God was doing when a baby was born and here they are hundreds of years removed from that you know Paul said it this way in Colossians 1 and verse 20 and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight you know it just struck me how you have folks hundreds of years from when it happened knowing what the work of God would do And yet when the work of God came to do it nobody in that day saw it except for those to whom he revealed it I think of Simeon who's standing in a crowded Temple a whole line of babies to be dedicated to the Lord and somehow he lays his eyes on one and he says mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people you know and as I was thinking about that and as we read Psalm 85 how precious it is to have noticed to have been made to notice to have been caused to recognize the work of God because for the vast majority of those in this day it's just another day the presence of God the work of God completely unnoticed completely unrecognized you know it says in verse 13 of Psalm 85 righteousness shall go before him and Shall Set us in the way of his steps they might as well have been quoting Ephesians 2. in verse 10 which said for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works righteousness which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them the way of his steps you know as we celebrate this whereas the world celebrates this great work that God did one day you know I don't know about you but I'm grateful that I'm able to see that he has caused me to notice that he has caused me to reconcile recognize and turn aside to see this thing that God is doing when everyone else is just another day you know and to me I mean I I enjoy Christmas I think we all do I think it's a wonderful time of year but to me it's just a reminder of how precious it is that he's given us eyes to see that it's just not another unnoticed work you know and I'm so grateful that there's a handful of folks Simeon Zechariah the sons of Korah who knew something about Redemption we're able to perceive the work that God is doing so as we read you know Psalm 85 this morning the Christmas story according to the sons of Korah let's just thank the Lord that he's given us eyes that we might see his hand extended let's read that together verse one Lord thou has been favorable unto thy land thou has brought back the Captivity of Jacob thou has forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou has covered all their sin sealing thou has taken away all thy wrath thou has turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger turn us o God of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to cease will thou be angry with us forever wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations will thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee show us thy mercy O Lord and grant us thy salvation I will hear what God the Lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his Saints but let them not turn again to Folly surely his salvation is neither them that fear Him That Glory May dwell in our land mercy and Truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven yea the Lord shall give that which is good and our land shall yield her Increase righteousness shall go before him and Shall Set us in the way of his steps amen amen God bless you you may have your Saints sing that song this morning there's not a friend like the lowly Jesus amen no not one I haven't found one yet please [Music] there's not a friend let's [Music] go Jesus knows all about our struggles there's not afraid no [Music] friend like him afraid friends there's not a

dedication amen thank you Foreigner can come at this morning I mean I thought it was fitting and just today it's the 25th and I was studying on the message but when I'm preached God wrapped gift and and I thought it was it preached it on the 25th and I thought what what a fitting gift this morning that God will give us the promise and of his son amen amen we're so thankful for that amen let's just sing that as Alberta come and they bring the baby for dedication oh and bring them in oh bring down oh bring down a wants to Jesus Jesus oh bring down [Music] to Jesus God bless you God bless you amen amen I was this morning I when they told me I was going to do baby dedication I asked if they wanted to wait for Brother David I said no they wanted to do it this morning and man I thought of this scripture that came to my heart in Psalm 127 it says accept the Lord buildeth a house they delivered in a day that labor in vain that built it except the Lord kept the city The Watchmen watches in vain it is vain for you to rise up early and sit up late to eat bread of Sorrow for it's he that giveth his beloved sleep he said Lord children are inheritance of the Lord and the fruits of the womb is is its reward as errors are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth he says happy is a man that had his quiver full of him he says they shall not not be ashamed but shall speak with the Enemy at the Gate amen I thought this morning that you mean as we pray for the baby's name is Sylvia Elaine benini so we pray this morning that says the Lord will certainly bless her and certainly be with us that she will be one that fills the quiver that she could stand at the gate With the Enemy so we'll ask Alberta to pray as is accustomed for the baby and then we'll certainly pray all of us together for the baby if you can go ahead and pray shall we pray oh merciful and ever loving God we thank you for this moment father we know what you have done and that's why we are grateful this moment we petition your presence your ever loving and all-knowing persons in her life and Sylvia Elliott's life now dear Lord you shall be with her that she shall endure this Wiki generation she should go through it and that she shall be a blessing not unto us alone but to everybody father even as parents we ask for wisdom yes that will be able to see her towards the right the path of righteousness that are the end Glory and Honor shall be yours we thank you we give you glory there's no reactional in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen it's just about our heads this morning our gracious father you the author of eternal life give of all good gifts yes Father there's nothing you say that out of this parent he said whom the son will ask for bread will give a stone or womb gods for a fish will give a snake he says how much more your heavenly father this morning as our brother asks Lord we come together as a body to just ask father that you may be with silver Elaine Lord the father you remember all his siblings you'll be with them you give the parents the means by which they can raise her father that you may come and be made known unto her yourself Lord that she may be your daughter to serve you Lord into your kingdom father we commit them into your family pray that you may God their footsteps Lord father that you may provide for them when they don't have whatever they have need of you give to them that their job may be full we love you and commit everything to your hands and ask us in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen God bless you this morning let's all stand we're gonna amen are you happy to be in the house of God this morning hey man we'll try not to be long I know many of you have not finished cooking and some have left I don't know if we're in the oven or crock pots or whatever it is I will try to just take as much time we need and and be out of here we only have one service today so you don't have to worry about it and man let's open our barbers in Luke's chapter 2 the second chapter and we'll start from verse one foreign that they went out a degree from Caesar Augustus that that the whole world should be taxed and this testing was the first made by sirenius was when cyrenius was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone in their own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth in Judea into the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the House of the lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his spouse his spouse wife he's a spouse wife being with uh great with a child or child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that they should be delivered and he brought forth his firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloth and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end let's also turn to Matthew the second chapter and and let's start from verse one it says it says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold they came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him that's just by our heads our gracious father we ask that you bless your word to us we thank you we commit everything to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may have your seats this morning I'm learning to preach from a iPad so pray you be patient with me um this morning as a by means of a title to just guide our minds to know where we're going which direction we want to speak um I want to title it it's about the gift of eternal life it's about the gift of eternal life you know I was meditating on this and as I said I was studying in the message God wrapped gift and and you you you come you you your own Hearts you begin to have a desire within your heart you say you know you you want us as Believers to come to an understanding of what Christmas is all about and will most certainly go some to some quotes that brother random speaks and the things that is spoken and you you understand even in view of this message if I could say that this morning that it was really never about doctrines about teachings or about the things we know the things we don't know and how each one can explain the Bible and your Revelation how is it differs from mind and all of those things you really if you can sum it up the whole Gospel of Jesus Christ you'll realize that it was all about eternal life that was being given and I could say this morning many times as humans I feel like we forget that and and Paul will speak and said that if I speak with tongues of men and angels it said hey if I have uh if I have if I know all the Mysteries and I have all the knowledge and I could sit with you and expend the whole Bible and and show you great things but he said but if I lack charity I have nothing it says I'll be like a sounding symbol and just the noise that could be heard and why because he lacks the very substance of what the message was all about and the prophet would even tell us you know that many that this talk about even God it will say things like in the beginning God who was The God Who created the whole Heaven and Earth he said he had no ending or no beginning he covered all time in space but he would make a statement that always has stayed with me and will say that God was this great Fountain Of Love it would say God was this great Fountain of love and he would want us to understand that the motivation behind the entire creation was by love that it was God projecting his love and his creation so that everything that it was will be seen and you can even think I can even take it further and say this morning even the very Judgment of God is not so that it can hurt you or because he he didn't like you he wants to do you wrong but the very Judgment of God is based on that same Fountain of love it's because he wants to correct you he wants to bring you right back in the path he wants you to bring you back into the understanding that it's all about love you know people have even Twisted what love is all about and if they think it's giving flowers and doing this and all and all of that is good but the prophet will tell us that the very love of God is corrective love it would say that it will chastise you so he could bring you right back in the fold it's not because he hates you it's because he loves you and so I began to think we because you realize we live in the world where many people are interested in in having the power many people wants to do the works of God but how many are willing or wanting to do it by love you know that's why the prophet will tell us that power without character is satanic because why people wants to do great work they want to go and raise the dead and do all of that but they lack the very motive that they that God had in doing those things so in giving the power that he gave that's why he says in the scripture scriptures as many will come and say have we not done this and it will not done that he will look at them and say depart from me doers of iniquity I never knew you why because they didn't have the same heart that God did they didn't have the same desire that God did and I thought if I could perhaps change my title this morning I thought if we could have a conversion by love you know the people out there they're not looking for your theology or your knowledge or what you can explain or or you sit with him so they can see your Doctrine like you've seen it then they can believe no they want to see love come on display This Is The Life Of God was the life of love your fellow being a life that could go an extra mile a life that could look at somebody you don't have to come to my church you don't have to go to the same place I go you don't have to know who I am but the person who's only willing and Desiring to project the same love that God projected for them that's what the message is all about and and if we can only have that kind of heart that's the heart of God to have to understand that Christmas is about love the prophet will say this and will say uh even the many misunderstanding and the things that people have projected and we know we understand uh uh what what Chris is Christmas is all about and I'll read some quotes how the prophet is trying to bring it into the very perspective being in this season it will say in question answer I said I so appreciate all your prayers and by God's prayer God's help and Grace he says a very merry merry Christmas to every one of you it says remember my saying it's not Santa Claus this is for Jesus now and I want to say this the prophet is not trying to do away with the whole season but he's wanting you to understand the reason for the season because he's trying to bring it in perspective because if you're not careful you could take it too further oh we don't do this now I want to see you celebrating April or May I want to see you do something so there's got to come a time where this is brought back to remembrance so he's saying it's not about Santa Claus but it's for Jesus you see Christmas Means Christ and we were writing last night showing the kitties all the house decoration and everything which is an awful nice but I thought if I ever if anything on my house that I ever want to write it says would be on me on sign it says trusting Christ will be in your Christmas so he's wanting you to to to understand the the reason for the season and to put it right back in perspective and and not get lost into everything else that's happening and said bring bring entrusting that Christ is brought right back into Christmas he says that's right put Christ back into Christmas there's not nothing wrong with with you celebrating or having a good time but you have to understand the reason for the season he would say in the message sir we would see Jesus he says God bless you not exactly Merry Christmas but God's blessing of Christmas be upon you it says may the Christ of Calvary hide you in himself blanket you so write you and in uh enshroud you in his word till his word will be made flesh in you and so it's not all thank God for sending a baby send thank God for sending your son no that that's not good enough that's not the end of it the end of it is that son has to be in you that that son the promise has to be made flesh in you the son has to be manifested in your flesh and he says in your flesh is my prayer God bless you and I'm going in a little fast for the sake of time as I said I don't want to be too long uh in the message we have seen it start and come to worship Him it says I wish you the very merriest of Christmas that God will send his star from the East thy Rose in the East to 19 years ago and they will guide you through the word made flesh the purpose for this story is always to guide the purpose for the son is always to send you somewhere and it's to send you back to his word back to the understanding of the hour back to what he's trying to achieve in that season back to what the the reason why the son was given he's trying to ring it right back into perspective and now in the message presuming it says now this is a little bit longer or just just be patient with me as I'm laying the foundation it says now we have just passed two of the major holidays and he preached this in January so he's referring to the holiday that just passed it says and we know we know here in America to be Christmas time and New Year's it's actually not Christmas it says it's not it's not a Christmas it's a day that we set aside course we realize it is in the it isn't the Lord's birthday he couldn't have been born in December 25th because it's cold up there Shepherd could not have been on the hills and so forth it says it was uh if if you ever was in Judea along that time it says of the year you could see it wasn't it wasn't in the winter time but it start perhaps along in April or May when limbs are born and he says and like he came by all nature just like irregular Lambs are born he was born he says he was the Lamb of God and he was born along that time so now he's showing you this is not the real dates we understand that this is not a season for it he couldn't been in December and all of that and we understand where all of that came from the Roman Calendar and all those things but here's what I'm trying to get to the message that he's trying to give us he says but it start like a regular Olympia was the Lamb of God along that time but I it says but I don't suppose that he cares what day we set aside he says but I don't suppose he cares what date was set aside because it's the the actual day is lost it is it says it is in commemoration of his birthday so he's wanting us to look at this in commemoration of his birthday because we don't know what the actual day was it says instead of making it a commemoration of a day of worship to God for he fulfill him sending his son to us we we have celebrations we we we celebrate Christmas it's not a celebration we couldn't celebrate Washington's birthday or Lincoln's birthday or some other greats Mane's birthday you might celebrate it but Christ but Christmas should be a day of worship right now oh my it's not a day where we just oh you know a gift's exchange buy this and do this he's wanting to know it's the day of worship he says we have Twisted it around and creative another great commercial day it's all fixed up in past uh passing presence to one another and having feelings hurt if we don't do it you forgot to get me a gift oh my goodness I said you know it's going to take a year to fix it you know it it it you know here we are the prophet is he's showing us what the world has done with it they have forgotten this is about eternal life that was given they are focused on just gifts exchange and and all those things it says we've Twisted all up completely we've we've taken it and commercializing it in everything now and I want to say this because I thought this was so important and yet we are people uh are going through and for and and buying things and this is the great commercial time that there is and people are forgetting the reason for the season now I was looking at this and I thought perhaps you will bring into perspective what's really happening out there you know they're saying that Christmas and this is an article I came across it speaks about Christmas it says Christmas is typically the large just economic stimulant for Many Nations around the world it says and the cells increased drastically in almost all retails area during this time so in 2022 the total holiday retail sales were projected were projected to reach a height of 942 billion US dollars I'm sure you acquainted with what they referred to as stimulus so something that brings the very economy is based on borrowing an interest and and consuming and all of those things so so if you take out all the holidays you take everything combined the the year end is the biggest time that the U.S economy or all the economies of the world are relying on in order to move on so without the celebration or without this uh gift-giving and all those things the one there won't be any economy because it's 942 billion and and and the economy relies on it you know people spend money they don't have and well either we work and we work and then we come towards the end of the year we spend everything that we have and January comes we go back to work we're stuck in this cycle where we save up everything and if we don't thank God for credit card we can we pawn it on and pay later and do all those things so that's the reason for the season that people have taken it that's what they're constantly getting stuck on that's what they do and the property is here to remind us that's not the reason you know as Believers we have to constantly be reminded because it's easy to get caught up or we didn't get a gift for this one we forgot to do this and we forgot to do this and oh we didn't get kids enough gift and they need two each and they need three each and oh this is the the list from so and so this is what you got to do and if you forget you forget what the season is all about and the prophet is wanting us to be reminded it's not about what you can buy and what you can do all those things will perish you're not the first one to do it right now now he's speaking about these things and what year is this is speaking in 1962 he's realizing what has been done and and the economy and all those things and now is reminding the believer when it comes time to the season you put everything in perspective if you don't have money to spend don't spend it people get stressed out and because they want to do things and they want to please everybody the prophet is here to remind you he says Christmas is about Christ stay with it so the projection for 2020 it was about 852 billion 2021 it was about 886 billion and 2022 is projected to be a uh between 932 to 942 billion dollars span during the season you think about Thanksgiving you think about uh uh uh Christmas you think about New Year's so it's all combined together that's why I was joking the editor I said Christmas is right the date right after Thanksgiving why because the season continues it's time you know 50 off and 50 percent off fifty percent of uh of a thousand is still a lot of money so they they come and they they up the price and it puts the wrong stickers on and they dropped the price and it's all commercialization it's all trying to get the money out of your pocket not the prophet is sending us put it right back in perspective put it right back to what it's supposed to be this is the time where the greatest gift on Earth and God came and oh my if this morning you can come and realize that I I was born a sinner I was lost and I didn't I couldn't find my way and even as the scripture says it says oh Kenny Ethiopian changes Canal can a leopard remove his Mark you couldn't do it you were stuck in sin it was condemnation by representation it was the way you came and you couldn't have done nothing about it but oh God wrapped themselves into a gift and and he came and he gave you the gift of eternal life and I want to say that that has to be the identification of every new born-again believer it's the understanding of coming into the realization that I was lost and I I didn't save myself and if I am what I am is by the grace of God he opened my eyes to see that someone died for me he opened my eyes so I can accept his word and by accepting this word he became to make he started making the changes in my life he took this out he took that out he made his word a reality in my life so he wants us not to forget what the season is all about he wants us to understand that it was about a life that was given and the prophet will say now it says and now but in this hour of Darkness I say I say that we that we are living He says still Christmas should be holding forth that light I I read it wrong let me read it again and it says now in the hour of this Darkness as we say we it says that we are living in a still Christians should be holding forth that light that there is still there is a true truth to Christmas he doesn't want you to say well you know Christ was not born in December and and I won't do anything and I want uh I'm not going to do anything I'm just going to say he wants you to be remembered that there has to be a truth for Christmas if this is the time that has been chosen that people are celebrating your your work or your job is to go to those people when you meet them to tell them what the true Christmas is all about to remind them it's not about buying exchanging gifts it's about a life that has been given and what God is looking out of you is to receive that light so you may be saved but what I'm going to say in the message the seal and we know this in the Easter seal you know this very well it says I I wonder today if you if if it happened what happening as we we're really getting people to God or are we just trying to get them to church because and I remember this is not just oh it's Christmas Day come to church many people that have never that spent the whole year they don't go to church today they're probably in temples and churches and everywhere why because it's Christmas Day but through Christmas is not just to come to a once in a time in the building and come and show your appreciation and walk away but through Christmas is to be born again and have the life living inside of you having that life directing your life every day having a life leading you every single time he says we must give them to Christ he said we're the quickening power is he says it's good to go to church sure it says but if that's as far as it goes it's not far enough it says when you come to church it's good but go on to Christ it says from the church because we must receive this quickening power and if we ever receive if we're ever going to receive that that General if we're going to accept that to be in that if we're going to expect to be in that General Resurrection he says because it's the only thing that will ever bring us back to come in contact with Christ himself oh my many people will read the Bible today many will stand up before and they will have services and they will help people come and and and offer their offerings and they will do all of those things and but yet it's just an empty ceremony the very purpose why the day was given the very purpose why Christ came is a very lost in them they don't understand that it's all about a life that was given a life a life that was sent and what was that life sent for that life was sinned so it could take you that was a bonus Sinner and return you into what you were supposed to be in the mind of God in the beginning this life was the only way of escape from this best house that we are in this life was saying so he can take you and give you the power to overcome the daily things that bothers you to overcome the sin that bothers you to overcome the Temptation that comes at you and there's no other form of life except this life and that's why we need to be born again as Sons and Daughters of God to receive the spirit of Christ within us because it's the only thing that will overcome because because he says if I live you shall live also to miss that life is to miss the power to overcome everything the prophet will say the scripture will say the prophet will say it says I think what's what it says that's what's matter with with the church with the churches brother he says when he gets to the place that we put our church first instead of Christ meaning your Your Allegiance your your your obligation is just oh if I don't go they won't see they'll see that I was missing I know or you know I'll come and you know just so people can see that I'm a Christian it says if you put your church first it says instead of Christ it says we are going right straight down when we put them as individuals we put your church first your social life first instead of your spiritual life you are going to fail oh my I I I I I believe there's no plain words you can put that this morning is here trying to let you know you that I I called yourself Christians you that have received this uh child or this this uh a new birth and you that have received this gift that God had given that if you live your life and your priority is not this life you are surely going to fail and and he didn't say well if you do a little bit and then you add something else no he's saying if your priority is not this life you surely going to fail if your job is first if your family is first if your career is first if whatever you do is first the moment you put that first you are surely going to fail the prophet says oh my why because I want to say this let me just jump and I'll just get towards the end because everything that you have need of is in this gift this gift was sent to you to provide for you both naturally and spiritually this gift was not sent so you can just say well he saved me spiritually but on the natural I gotta have to do my best and do no this gift was provided so you can have everything that you have need of this gift was given so he can take you from birth into the body change oh my oftentimes we neglect this gift and we go after things that don't have life we go after things that are only provide a temporary uh relief or a temporary excitement and after that we come back and and the reason why we are up and down all the time is because we neglect this life but if you can get this life and let they lead you it will take you to the destination why because he did it with Christ he will do it with you thank you that scripture was picked in John chapter 1 and verse 4 it says in him was life and life was the light of men this life was supposed to be your Guiding Light it was what supposed to direct your path to tell you where you should go what you should be doing it's a light that's supposed to Lead You In places it's a light that's supposed to govern your life it's the light that's supposed to lead you from here all the way to Eternity but when I will say he says in just a little while from then on the world was going to receive its greatest gift that he ever received and the Lord says a little package wrapped up a little first it says first the the first little Christmas package that was ever wrapped in the world God wrapped it up think about all the gifting and all the things that you do the first gift that ever was wrapped God himself wrapped it and here's what he says and I want to break into my thoughts and say this he says the greatest thing that ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it God himself wrapped his own self in a Christmas package and send it to the world my brother my sister there's nothing greater in the world and that's what the prophet is talking about there's nothing if you can understand it this morning he took his own life he didn't send the son that was separate from him but the son was the creation of the Father the Son was the father changing forms because in the form that he was of God God cannot die but there had to be a deity that was given in service for death he takes his own life and he wraps it together and he puts it in a human flesh and but when I will say that flesh will take that deity within it and will walk on earth and it suffered like you suffering he knew it was tempted by all things that you attempted that life came and he came in contact with the devil but all he overcame for you so that you don't have to go through the same thing this is not a life that was given now we can just come and say oh praise God that was just God and and he was in The Godly body and he did all of that by God no he came he took your place so you can take his place he tasted sin so you don't have to go the way you were going he took your life so you can take his life oh my if that could ever sink just in our mind and I want to say this he didn't have to die you have to understand this he did not have to die God could have wiped out the whole world and created a new seed and created a new generation but oh he was this great Fountain Of Love and the prophet said that God he didn't want to be defeated these were seeds that he created this were created in His image it was created by his word and this word can never be defeated so God wrapped himself into his own word he came down so you might have life this morning don't ever forget it don't ever forget that Oh my he says this in the message uh God perfecting his church I'll just jump quickly he says he says he says now uh he says now God himself came down in a blood cell and wrapped the blood around him he says the blood cell The Germ of Life Of God himself wrapped into the blood cell and brought forth a son Christ Jesus it says now he did he he doesn't buy he says that makes you perfect and brings you back into Fellowship now this is the first purpose he says he brings you through that blood cell into himself you get it he says through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus you are you you are that that invailed that in veiled that life the life of Jehovah and we coming through the blood cell comes a part of that life so deity itself lays in the man that received the Holy Ghost so when we when we speak about this life this is not says there's only one form of eternal life so God cannot send a life in Jesus Christ and give you a different life from the life that was in him he says there's only one form of eternal life and if you ever had eternal life you cannot lose it so this was the seed of God that would never come into fruition so God sends his own son to come and die for the sins and everything and through the Holy Ghost God can come and Quicken our life and bring you up so you can have the same life that he had he says you are a son I'm a brain and by birth and the part of Miss and Mrs Branham is in me if you become a son or a daughter of God part of part of deity raising you but look at us do we really understand that we really live by it oftentimes something strike a moral thoughts are the first to take over our moral thoughts are the first what am I going to do woe is me how am I going to get out of this and blah and this and this and this here is the gospel reminding you part of God is in you he gave it to you so you can overcome the world but when I will say in paragraph 38 of deity of Jesus Christ it says one of the greatest gifts that God ever gives the world was Jesus he says we know that and now I want to speak this morning upon the deity of Jesus of the D of upon his deity who he is so many has him as a little baby laying out there in the cradle and so forth it says but that was just a that was just one of the picture it says just one of the settings forth of the drama to bring it up to what he really is his deity why is he saying so you understand you are deity if his deity you are deity if his deity he dwells in you you become deity you become even as part of himself as he was paragraph 62 it says notice then that blood came down and was it was Christ Jesus and God himself I love this and God himself coming out of spirit went into Christ Jesus God coming out of spirit he was the spirit that covered all time in his face he came out of the spirit and came into Christ Jesus and the Bible says God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself is that right God himself Jehovah lived in Christ and was made Kingsman to us because he was born in human flesh like we are is that right he says that the blood cells were developed by God the flesh the cells were developed in the womb of Mary that brought forth the child and God came down and live in human flesh and was tempted in every manner just like you are do you believe that is that right it says now then when he did that he freely gave his blood he didn't have it to do it he made that sacrifice he could have went right up into Glory he he says he could have he could have been transfigured like it was on the Mount of transfiguration went into heaven and never died for us but he says to be willing to die for us he gave freely his blood at Calvary that's right he picked up he picked out he was made he was a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and made a public testimony why so you can have that life this morning so we would walk and have his life that life live in us so we could stand here and say that the works that I did you shall do also why because the same life that was in Christ being us and I want to say this I think some of the reason is because we don't hunger for it enough we don't hunger to see the works that Christ did being done in us we okay with the superficial you know I come and I just come and I listen and I hear what God is wanting us and I try to do my best and I said no God wants us to give all he gave all so you can give all and the only reason you can get into that fullness is if you give all of you because as long as there's a part of you that's holding back you cannot come into the fullness now just moving on now here we are and and as we read in Luke Chapter 2 it talks about the taxation by the emperor Caesar Augustus and and he came and and the prophet will use this and he talks about it was a time for taxation so everyone had to go back to their own City where they were born into their own place and you will talk about how you you think about how all of this and it says think about all of the the ones that were sick and all of the ones uh perhaps had a a uh uh all kinds of illnesses or couldn't walk and all those things everybody had to go back to the respective place he says remember and think about how many could have cursed the king or the emperor because of that and pray and say you know that that God May reverse the decision but he said but all of that was done so that the prophecy may be fulfilled he says you think about their nightmares and all the things that were happening you you look at it and looking at it from the natural eye it just seems like oh I can't believe this this is what we have to do now and you know you think about all the stuff that happened you think about inflation and all to the human eyes it just looks like natural well I can't believe the cycles of economy now we have to pay higher inflation and and the historians will come and bring you a statistics inside and in 19 and so and so this happened also and the inflation rate when up to this percent and now it's their sin so it's the cycle of the economy and they go back and they said what did we do to bring it down and they do and all of that is looking at it through the human eyes but those that knew what the scripture says they understood the reason why the king made the decree those that understood the reason why they understood that the prophecy those that knew the prophecy knew that son was to be born in Bethlehem and I want to say this morning God will move Kings God will move presidents God will move Governors God will move you to fulfill his word there is nothing that can stop the word of God God is able to create something new out of nothing so when the time comes for his word to be fulfilled he will move whatever needs to be moved and I want to just say that because often time we hear and and we look at the burdens of life and all those things and say how can me with this condition that I am in every day how can I obtain the the the the the the Rapture or the body change God will bring forth the battery the body change when it's time for the body change to come you continue in his word you continue to do what he told you to do it's for him to bring it to pass in that word we let's not concentrate on things that we don't have business doing let's do the things that we are called to do the scripture says that all things work together for them not love him so your job is to love him your job is to praise him your job is to thank him for all that comes to you your job is to rejoice in whatever condition you'll find and it's God's job to take the negative and the positive and work it all together for good you you you it would say oh look at them that little mother and you always about to expecting and you put him on a little donkey in and have him go so many miles it was so uncomfortable but it was a promise it was for a purpose for the prophecy to be fulfilled and barabbana will say this he will say this it says it says now in this last day in these last days there was a great persecution against the church Caesar Augustus had made a great plan that it would tax all the people and that was the only that was only to be done for one purpose listen now he says that the God's Great prophecy will be fulfilled now listen to this only thing you have to do when you see something in the Bible that sounds just a little Mystic and a little suspicious superficials super superstitious to you just give God a little bit of time I love this I love this I Pray oh God give us patience to give you time you know we go through difficult things and and each one can come here you know we can talk about the things that you're facing and I know each Believers has a battle that they're fighting and I know that for a fact if you don't have a paddle you need to check yourself but I want to say this each one we go through things and we have things that we have before the Lord that we don't understand why and we pray day and night and God knows it because those things are constantly on our minds and God will allow it and yeah this Prophet said give God a little bit of time it says God is in no hurry we are the ones that gets in a hurry just give God a little bit of time and you will see those old prophetic Wills cogs run up into the picture we're not the one developing the picture we're only part of the story God has the whole picture God knows exactly what to teach you so he can bring the the sound that he's looking for and God knows exactly in what condition to put you so some words can come out of your mouth and perhaps those words will bless somebody or will do something to somebody but he's saying that you just give God time and watch what he's doing it says he's the one that developed we he will run up into the picture it will develop just like like just like the bringing up of a picture I want to say this if we can this morning understand it's God who has the picture it's God who's developing the picture whatever is happening to you whether good or bad you just keep it in God's hands you just continue to show it to God God knows when the time is for him to come and save you God knows what time is it so he can come and perhaps take you out of that situation why he's waiting for his time oftentimes we want God to operate on our time you know I was thinking about you think about Lazarus being dead I've always thought that's the greatest understanding of what God's time means you think about what happened yeah they are and they they're calling upon him please come please come please come and and he hears that Lazarus is sick and he delays because why he had a vision but they didn't understand the picture they didn't have the full picture they didn't know what God was about to do all they were looking for they knew is they needed Deliverance they needed someone to come and save them and he waits and Lazarus died and perhaps within their hearts I could have said well you know I've seen him heal the sick perhaps if he comes when he's sick it can heal him and then he died and perhaps within the mind they said well I seen him raise the dead or if he can come just now as he's still dead perhaps he can raise him but Jesus delays until the Decay but when I'm says the news sunk and he says corruption began to take his place and at that time they had no physical evidence of anything that is done that they could point to and say he could still rise no wonder he says oh if he will only come if you had only been here in time my brother would have not died and Jesus looked at him and says I am the resurrection and the life and Martha looks and says yes I know but I know my brother will rise in the last day and all those things he looks at him and says no he that is speaking to you right now I am the resurrection and life oh Mount of Faith got brought from the future into the present she said even now I believe that whatever you say God will honor it what is it you do she opened the door for eternity to be manifested and Jesus stood there and he says Lazarus come forth and Lazarus came out what was it that was God's time your time may have passed you can look at your time and say my time has passed and there's no way I could have a baby there's no way this could happen there's no way that I can do that's your time how about God's time this morning if you can only invite God's time you can say I'm sick I don't know what to do the doctor says this condition will stay upon me forever that's the doctor's time how about God's time what we need is to invite him so he can come and and take us from our time and bring us into his time his time is eternity his time is the present he says I am the resurrection and the life the prophet will speak he will say you think about Mary yeah they are and he will talk about how he dramatized it and they're coming and and they go up and and they go up and and all those things and he says they will come in in all the situation it will think how cruel this King was even them they didn't understand the very purpose they just do well the decree is done and we're going to go and and everything and that's all we're just going to go and register it says many times we look at the scripture in our own way of looking how many has done it every day we look at it it says one thing it says one thing and and we look at it and all of a sudden something else began to rise like I never saw it this way it says he seems very hard but if we study a little while we found out that the all all-wise God knows just what he's doing is the all-wisdom god he knows what he's doing it says and he knows how to do these things and knows how to deal with man he knows your pinpoint he knows what he could come he could get you screaming right now he knows exactly where he needs to touch he can get you to jump and happy he knows where to touch he knows everything he made you but when it says it says he knows he says he knows how to deal with man he knows what's in man and then he says he he knows him we don't we only know from the intellectual side he knows what's really in the man we only know from the intellectual side my mind these things can kill you you know oftentimes we get information processing comparing charts come out and I don't know if your brain works like that I know it's like you get information and you go you look at your your storage your database and your check is this really something that could happen and you compare with everything else that you've heard and all of that and you come to a conclusion not happening why because I don't have any records of it happening before you know and all that God says that's your intellectual side now he think about who we're dealing with here this is the creator of Heaven and Earth you know this is not your life this is his life what it's looking for is for you to come out of your life and come into his life his life is where all things are possible your life is a mortal life it will come to an end but his life is Immortal he's a it's the very beginning and the ending he's the one who knows the end and before the beginning oh my let me just run for the second time now he speaks and it says he speaks in the message God's Wrath gives it says but all the things but about all things but all things are foreign of God he says that works together for the good of them that love him he was ordained of God that they should be there should be a heartless King in that day a bloodthirsty uh Herod God knew that no God knew about that he says God knew about the tax the taxes and how this brutal government uh did that to have no thoughts of of Mercy on those poor mothers it says that was just about that was just about to to be ready for the delivery to deliver her firstborn son just in few days but he commanded that there should be that they should come to the native birthplace and pay taxes it says no matter what condition she's in she's got to come anyhow God knew all about that he foreknew all things he knows all things and he makes everything work together for good what's your situation this morning it's it's hidden to me but it's revealed to God there is nothing that we go through that God doesn't know you know oftentimes we you know the scripture will speak and you know we people are wanting to sell this Christianity that's without a trial you know oh if you become a Christian all the things will be Rosy and you all have to face pain or anything and all of that and all right don't ever buy that don't ever bite her it says I have become a Christian to fight I have become a Christian to get into the fight we have not been called to a picnic we've been called to a battlefield we we have a real enemy who's after us so therefore when you become a Christian God has given you the weapon or the ability for you to pull down his kingdom and I want to say this because this is very important oftentimes even as Christians yet we are often damn things happening and people have this passive attitude oh you know what God will do it when he wants to do it and no that's not what we are called a true a True Believers don't want to see the devil come when he sees the devil attack he's ready to fight he's ready to go to fight he will fight till the end a True Believer doesn't give up will talk about that dog he says if I didn't have any teeth I will come amen it's not the size of the dog but it's size of the fight in the dog a True Believer is ready to attack the enemy wherever he sees him come don't don't have this passive attitude God will do it no the reason why you feel bad about it is because God wants you to do something about it and let me say this I wasn't praying to say it but I'll just say it but when I'm I can't I don't remember what message I was listening to he talks about a kid who was eating up with cancer on his mouth was in the hospital and he says his tongue was coming out even funny he said naturally I looked at him I couldn't stay there longer naturally I looked at him I said I couldn't even I didn't have a string and the father called him to pray and I'm paraphrasing this and he came and he looked at him it says within his heart he began to pray he just said it says I know the great Jehovah who created all Heaven and Earth he said you didn't create this kid to be this way or to go through what they're going through oh father if you can only do something and then he says and then he heard a voice speak to him and says I was waiting to see what you were going to do I was waiting to see what you were going to do oftentimes we take it and we just give it in God oh no God wants to see what your reaction is going to be are you gonna go to battle or are you just gonna look at it are you gonna go to battle and fight or you're just going to look at it but when I'm says this and I've always loved the squad you probably heard me read it before he speaks about our trials he says uh oh okay this is in the prayer says give us our hearts desire we says we are truly we truly have this desires to serve you in this witness weakening conditions and affliction and the things of the world that are put Upon Us sometimes to perfect us he says we've been told that and then he said think of thinking not strange that these trials will come they are only working out for you for for our good and to perfect us and to bring us into that place what place the place that he has for you he says these great deserts of experience where righteous men are molded into Saints these deserts of experiences will experience where righteous men are molded into Saints we thank thee for this experience Lord we would not he says we says we would we would no means no wise want to do anything contrary to your will in other words saying is if my way be forward try if my wife will feed forward battles if my wife will fall with all of these things God I'll take it gladly I'll grow the way that you want me to go I don't want to detract to the left or to the right the way that you want me to go that's the way I will go because I understand that all those things are sent to perfect me it says and sometimes we think that our burdens am I just inject in here that we think our burdens are so heavy sometimes that there's nothing like it in the world how many feel like that sometimes like I don't know how I'm gonna make it out of this it says this isn't a message we have seen a star paragraph 47 42 and then it says do you know that all those things are good for you did you say good for me good for you it says they are all to mold you make you prophets and Sages was molded on the backside of the desert in the hot blazing sun it says through tribulations and trials and persecutions and these things that we have today there's nothing perhaps there is nothing happening to us that hasn't happened to other Christians before other Christians had had to stand in the hour of Darkness like this and even be fed up the lion fed the lion for the testimonies let's fight don't say war is me say thank you Lord thank you Father I don't understand it I I can't explain it but I know you're doing something it's because you want to perfect me it's because you want me to go continue to fight and I tell you this if all of those things are taken out what benefit will they be to be a Christian so you could just be happy lucky and jumping up and all of that no a Christian is the one who can intercede and the intercession comes when you understand what someone is going through so when you stand there you said Lord God heal that person you know what that means why because you have had to go through that so now we understand that they're going forth into Bethlehem it was all designed by predestination or by foreknowledge because God knew that the son that Jesus was to be born in Bethlehem and we don't have time to go through it but brahmanam will talk about you know we know he preached a message why he had to be Bethlehem and he speaks for the reason and I would just summarize this these are a few of the people that are connected directly to Bethlehem in fact if you go to channel I'm sorry to Matthew chapter one it speaks about the genealogy of Jesus you could see the whole line and how it got to how it got to Joseph and down to Jesus and but when I'm going to say that this this city of Bethlehem he says he was established and founded by one of Caleb's Sons and he spoke about how that they limit and his wife Naomi were connected they came from Bethlehem Boaz who was the Kingman Kingsman who was married to Naomi and who was the kingsman for elima like we understand that he came from Bethlehem oh bad the son of Boaz and Ruth and uh and uh by Ruth basically because we understand that Boaz had to come and redeem them and marry Ruth and then from then on they had Boaz and Jesse the son of Obed the father of David and Joseph was a descendant of the household of David as the Bible will say and then Jesus the Messiah will find out that he also spoke about how you you will take how even Reya became connected to Bethlehem for the fact that he married the general who who came from the army of Israel and was married to him and she was married to her and and why ahead because Bethlehem was part of Judah and we know that new Kings come unless it comes out of Judah that's why they have to go he drive them all the way and but he says what is Bethlehem it says it's the house of God's bread and every believer has to be born in Bethlehem every believer has to be born in this place why because that was where the living bread came from I could explain but I don't have time we every it's the and it's directly connected why Jesus will stand on the day or Passover and says I am the bread that's come down from heaven you eat of the natural bread you die because it was a feast they were all eating bread and all of those things he looks at him he says I am the living bread of life if you eat of that natural bread you will eat it but I at the end you shall die but if you eat of this bread you shall live and that's when they took him and they wanted to kill him so so and you would say Bethlehem was the lowest place that there was Bethlehem was the lowest place that there was I think about the prophet's message and some of the things that he speaks about himself he said being a kid has said I would wear a coat and I didn't have any shirt on and I had it buttoned up and I was sweating out but I didn't open I didn't want to open because I didn't have I could relate to that he he didn't send this gospel but upon Him says to the wise to the reaches and to the others he founded the lowest place that there was to send this gospel God is the god who takes nothing and makes something out of it if we come here and we think we are somebody God will never use us if our gathering is made of intellectuals in our degrees and our things that our achievements our jobs our ability to read and write and expand and explain we are lost but if we understand that all of that amounts to nothing God can come and use us why because he's looking for the nothing so he can make something out of it why because he's looking for the lowest so he could have if it's already elevated what can he do about it he he could have oh think about the celebration if he would have come to the Pharisees and all of them think about all the parties and all of those that it was going to vindicate what they were saying but he came to the humble through the poor to the needy to the little to the poor in spirit that he can come and make himself known says there was no room for him in the end and I just want to summarize this because I know like I said I don't plan to try to be too long he asked a question he came and there was no room in the nas what was he rejected and and I just summarized because it would just take too long to go through each one he says why did I refuse it why couldn't they see it why didn't they turn why did he turn it down why did why didn't they want it says the same reason they don't want it tonight it was it wasn't handed to them in the custom that they were used to gift being handed I want you to think about that it was given it wasn't given in the custom that they are used to having gifts that's the reason they rejected it yet tonight he's speaking about then he's speaking about today it's because it's not handed to people in the custom that they've been used to receiving gifts and what about them go on to say but God wrapped his own package he's got the right to do it he's the one that's giving it he has the right to wrap it any way he wants to wrap it it doesn't make any difference how it is he's got the right to do it because he's the one that's giving the gift you're like why are they receiving why are they not receive this message why have they rejected or why have that rejected this word this message that came in this Prophet who will stand the night after night and it will raise the dead and and do this greater miracle and will bring crowd into the the the myths and the churches will grow and all it did he did nothing but good he did nothing but Prosper them and and helped them grow their churches never came with the intention he will he will pick days where he knew that they didn't have churches because he didn't want to draw people from his building and he will find time and he will tell people or if you have church don't come today go back to your local church he did all of that why did I reject it he says because see it came in the way that they were not the receiving gifts but in one place but one of them he says he says they rejected it because they were not predestinated to receive it they're rejected it because they were not part of what God was trying to build and he says the rejected it also let me just if I could sum it up tonight this morning they rejected it because it was contrary to the custom in what they believe what how they view everything how everything should operate this message when he came he was in conflict with the lies that's why they wouldn't reject they wouldn't receive it and in one place he says they rejected it because when the message came they had to give up something this message when it comes to you you have to give up something and they didn't want to give up anything they wanted their life to remain the way it was they didn't want the reproach of it now I'm no longer talking about their churches I'm talking about us the reason why people don't fully Embrace a message is sometimes they they don't want something that will change your lifestyle you know people some people want a clean fun you know a clean fun they want to you know they want a separation I've said this before between them and the word they don't want to be fully emerged because it's going to condemn them so they want to celebrate and do things like the world does but they still also want to be part of the message if you are lukewarm it will vomit you out of his mouth they don't want to fully give in they don't want the reproach they don't want they don't want a message that will make a mess out of them they don't want a message that will cause them to cry and to give their lives to God and they don't want a message that will come and take away sins and and change lives and a message that will come and cut out the things of the world no there's a part of us that wants to preserve some things that we just don't want to give up you know I I believe the message but you know this is I don't see you know all things are lawful I don't really see they don't want to give up certain things and I wonder this morning if we have certain things like that if we do we have not fully received them when you receive it not you the message is there to flesh out everything it will tell you this is not it take it out this is not it this is not it this is not it David said oh thy loving kindness is better than life but when I'm says they are here they are they're drinking and smoking and and rejoicing and committing all kind of immoral things he says they call that life that's death that's death what kind of life it is that you get drunk and you do all kinds of things and and all kinds of immoral stuff and you come back and you regret for all the things you've done what kind of life is that what kind of life that would cause you to be addicted to cigarettes or to things and you you smoke and you do all of that and it causes lung cancer and you die and you call that life that's not life that's death but David will say that loving kindness is better than life to me in other words the life that comes by him and let me say this today people think that we are here that we are bound and we are slaves and because of the way we dress and all of those things you think that's that's freedom to me that's the freedom of the Holy Ghost you don't have to do something that you don't have to you don't have to dress like the world you don't have to call somebody to fall because of the way you dress and you don't have to tell a dirty joke and cause somebody to do wrong that's Purity to me amen you call that Liberty Liberty when you go spend and you get drunk and when you get sober all of your problems are still there Liberty when you are addicted you don't have enough money to buy food but yet you have enough money to buy alcohol and cigarette you got that Liberty when you you you you get so addicted to video games that people die while playing that's Liberty that sounds like bondage to me you call it Liberty when you wake up and and you are this one and no one is looking for you and they're looking for you you are everybody and you you live in constant fear you don't know what's going to happen to you you call that Liberty that's not Liberty Liberty you they call it Liberty you you you you you go out and and and you come back and your house is all alarmed and everything and you block everything up so nobody will steal you call that Liberty that's not Liberty and the scripture says Heaven and Earth will pass away it don't matter I tell you this people go to the gym and they do all kinds of exercising a week later they die oh there's only one form of Liberty and that's the Gospel of Jesus Christ there's only one form of Liberty and that's the word we have received this world will change your life this world will change your body when it comes time to it this word will give you the life that you were supposed to have in the first place let me say this Heaven and Earth all of those things are temporal there's only one thing that's eternal and that's the word of God and I want to invite us tonight and this morning and just say oh my let's not run away from it let's be committed with everything within us let's be fully committed you say well I received the message the scripture says Jesus said he said if you love me you'll keep my commandment that's the end of it if you love me you'll keep my commandment I'm not talking about something you're struggling with he's there to take it out of you he's there to give you the victory as long as there is something in you that don't want it he will come and it will give you the victory I'm talking about things that you know and you never pay any mind to it he says they didn't want to pay the cost you know there's a cost to being a Christian Jesus said I Sanctified myself for their sake you know our pastor comes in near day in and day out and and he stands and he studies and he does all of that it's it's it's to help us it's to feed us the word it's to let us know what God Said and what God is requiring and I believe as Believers just think a word fellowshipping in the brother's breakfast I believe last weekend and we're talking about you know the desperation I said oh just think about it as Believers if we can get in desperation you know we read often time and the scripture will say you know Jesus and then he'd done this and he went here and he did this we can even talk about the prophet we talk about the third full manifestation and all of that and we could say but yet we are here and those things we're talking about it as they were right there how come we're not getting that desperation if God promised it a Believer he's one who pulls Heaven down but when I'm says you pray till you take the promises of God and you bring him down that's what God wants us to do it's not one with a passive attitude oh God I pray you give it to me amen no he wants you to fight for it he wants you to show that you want it he wants to see that you really need it the scripture says that the kingdom of God People Press into it in other words they go with force and they say God I want this like like talk about Uncle Buddy Robinson I'm not living here until you give me the Holy Ghost that's the kind of attitude we need to have not a passive attitude well no people on fire for God they want to see God move in the midst they want to see healing in the midst they're not just for them for other people they want to see a a sinner walk in and then the word is spoken and God changes his life that's the third pool and that's the time we are living in what the word has moved from the head and it is in the bride don't we say that the word is in the bride and says the same power quickening power moves from the body from the head into the body he says this if the musician could come up I'll just I'll just jump quickly here so I can get to it close he says foreign I wondered tonight in the building in this building of this Christmas time it says in commemoration of nearly two thousand years ago when God gave the first Christmas gift I wonder tonight if you'd like to look inside of the package and see sinners that there isn't somebody in in there who would love somebody who died for you somebody who gave the life for you would be willing tonight to take the swaddling cloth off of him and dirty cloth that they call it the fanatic and the Holy Roller and wrap himself in it and take the way of the Lord despise few it says if you are in the building tonight like to remember in like to be remembered in prayer it says would you raise your hand and say oh this Christmas night I want to receive Christmas gift of God God's true Christmas gift God bless you lady God bless you girly God bless you Sister God bless you God bless you the young lady God there there it says there there'll be some more that would like to remain remember God bless you brother now he says one place that in the first time when it came it was God's gift wrapped in Christ but it says but in the end time is the gift wrapped inside into Sons and Daughters of God what was whether the first gift that came that was wrapped into Christ did it gave his life for others what is the second coming gift coming into the sons of daughters supposed to do give his life for others we have the word in our meds but God is wanting us to put the Christ right back into Christmas understanding it's not about theology it's not about what I can say it's not what about what I can expose or what I could do but it's about Christ being born in my heart they said oh God truly what I desire is your birth in my heart to produce the works that you have predestinated for me to produce now he said a lot had rejected him remember we went through he would speak about how because they didn't want what the Holy Ghost will do with them they didn't want to give up something they they were happy with the way they were you know sometimes you had to realize for a person to need Christ for a person to want Christ but when I must say that they have to be in the condition where they need them if a person is there where everything is working well for him they have no need of it but God knows how to bring the need something will go wrong and oftentimes things do it says then when you come with the gift of Life they realize I need this I need something my money can give me my fame can give me my connections cannot buy me all of those things cannot get me and that's when they come in real estate realization I need this and all work on Earth is to be that Christmas for them is to realize that I have been placed here and but for me to do it I need this power to move through me I need his work to be made a reality in my heart he said they rejected him but remember there were predestinated wise men that were sent specifically so they can recognize him we have seen a star and have come to worship him what was it while even in Jerusalem King Herod and all the people sitting around they had no idea what was happening yet there were three men from the East [Music] three men who saw his star they came all the way to worship him why they were predestinated to see it they were predestinated to view him to see him now I want to say this I want you to realize when they came they all didn't have the same gifts that they brought forth each one had his own revelation about who this person was one said oh I could recognize deity had gold significance of the deity one came and he had myrrh and all those things and and one came and he recognized him as a priest one came and recognized it in his death they came and recognized it for the different things but it was all of those things [Music] oh I say tonight this morning I want to come into Revelation that he's given me and I want him to reveal more and more himself to me so I may know who he is and worship him in the way that he wants me to worship him I can only worship it based on my Revelation I can only worship on based on what he has revealed to him if I say anything outside of what is made known unto me I become an idolater a contrary let's all stand oh I hope it's your heart desire that Christ may be your Christmas this morning that for life that was given may be common that he may come and be manifesting you let's just bow our heads our gracious father we're so thankful this morning Lord and [Music] Lord to know that it's about eternal life it's about your life that you place inside of us Lord we pray that you may lead us on the way Lord [Music] father like your Prophet will say that star was given to guide them and he said that the Tsar was the sign Lord you've given us the sign in this end time and we have seen it and the sign was to guide us to the word Lord and I prayed father this morning that your word may come and abide in our hearts Lord father God that you may bring us into the reality of what the true Christmas is where it's about worship because when they came and they saw it they came in the city of Jerusalem they began to walk around and say where is he that is born King of the Jews father this word was not given so we can keep quiet he was given so we can go and find out and say oh what is it that you're saying Lord that we may become the things which you promised lead us oh God father we remember those that are traveling and those that are home father wherever they are we pray that this your word may just resonate with them oh God to account that all of us together we may come into our understanding father remember our pastor once again and his family we ask that you bless them where they are Lord
