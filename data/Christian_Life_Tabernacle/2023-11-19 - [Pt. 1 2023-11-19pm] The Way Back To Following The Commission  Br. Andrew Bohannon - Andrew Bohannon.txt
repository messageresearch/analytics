Description:
The Way Back To Following The Commission
Br. Andrew Bohannon 
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 19, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

us pray together Heavenly Father Lord Here We Stand oh God knowing that you're present and knowing that you've purchased us and there's something that you have for us this evening something Supernatural Lord you're a God that is beyond just natural Realms Lord but you're a supernatural Living God and you pray you'd strengthen him Lord May virtue be restored to him Lord continue to strengthen him as he Endeavors to complete what you the vision of the building of the church and providing all that that would provide the Sunday School rooms and surely there's a lot work done but there's a lot more to go and so father we're trusting that you would continue to build him up Lord f physically spiritually Lord financially Lord we're just Lifting Up Your Great Name believing that you oh God will finish what you started not just in the building but in the house of the Living God your bride father we commit this little time of Fellowship praying that you'd bless every heart and the needs here we commit it to you now in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen well we certainly count it a grand privilege to be here and to share a heart with you we just trusting that the Lord will have his way uh I tell you I got a full heart but I don't know exactly how the Lord's going to unpack the service but you know we come with an expectation and God is faithful to his word amen how many are expecting God to speak to your need I don't know your need but God knows your need amen and by the promise of God word he's here to meet you personally individually I believe that I certainly appreciated how the Lord moved on our pastor and I'll just maybe start off with that scripture reading that he read um this morning and that's the faith that was once delivered there in Jude in verse three we'll just start there and trust the Lord will'll add a read a blessing to the reading of his word there in Jude verse three beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you to earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints amen you may have your seeds you know it was something that was on my heart we were praying for the special meetings and you know you go through different seasons in life you know sometimes you're needing a new job or sometimes you know there's a transition in your life and well you need God to come on the scene because it's not something vague you need something specific right you go through challenges and trials in life and our God wants to be there present as a living help amen not just uh you know like the the quote said I like that so much he's he's not just a halfhazard bystandard but he's there concerned about your needs he's concerned about your relationships he's concerned about your finances he's concerned about your health amen but he's provided something in the word of God to meet every need amen now the thing is is you know will we look inside and examine I I just so appreciated that you know that call to examine ourselves what was this Faith Delivered for what is it to produce what kind of results are these Faith to to to bring us as individuals right and it it got me you know the the uh you know the prayer service before our meetings I I just come to a desperation I said God and and it really shouldn't just be before special meetings it should be every time every day every moment of the day God don't let me make these decisions without your hand in my life I don't want to just you know take the big decisions and go to God oh I want to take all my choices cuz I've chosen to follow Christ amen amen there's there's nothing too significant for us to go to God and say God I need your leadership I need your direction there's nothing too small for God to say I'm mindful of that amen and I just took some little uh notes as as the Lord just placed something on my heart when we were having all these um you know expectations wanting to see how the Lord would deal with us as a body you know and special meetings are wonderful I I tell you in 2007 the Lord supernaturally touched my body just miraculously moved on my life changed me forever physically I can say from that time I was sitting about where leonte brother Leon sitting I was standing there and I was in pain and I was struggling but something there was a voice that say just stay a little longer you might be in your trial and God's just saying stay there a little bit longer just wait upon the Lord you'll renew your strength you'll Mount up as wings of eagles I was sitting there and I was saying I'm in so much pain I can't stand anymore but that voice said just stand a little longer how did I know what was around the corner of that commission that just stay at my word hold forth don't move don't sit down don't back up Hold Your Position I got something for you and I'm standing there and I'm in pain and I want to relent I want to Bow I want to Cave to the pressure I wouldn't just sit down and say ah I can't take it but oh my there's a rewarder who listened to the voice of God and take heed to the warning and I stood there and I was burning on fire my neck was hurting so bad I've never been in a service so long but oh my God blew my expectation out of the Waters I mean it was just glory and praise from my heart and tears of rejoicing because there was such a breeze of the spirit coming to fulfill his promise and all of the pain and all the dysfunction for years God delivered me he set me free healed me I praise God and His keeping power to keep that healing has never left salvation is good as long as you keep testifying keep giving God praise for saving me despite my condition despite the circumstances my God Lives not just does he live but he lives in me amen that's what he does he lives in you he's here to perform his good word to you praise God he's a personal God my God Lives that's the testimony when we go into all the world we have experience people want to know know that your God is real not just 20 years ago but he's here today what did he do for you today it might not be as what we would say big but oh God when he comes and speaks that still Small Voice Hallelujah Hallelujah now that's the kind of thing that pulsates in the Sons and Daughters of God my God still speaks amen well that's just enough to close the service but I thank the Lord for his faithfulness you know we we just you know we're a called out people and the called out uh the church means called out we were called out of Egypt called out of the world we were to be a separate people holy where the scripture says and I was going to read it and maybe we'll just go there and Peter just because we want to be identified with every scripture in First Peter I believe it is maybe by the help of the Lord I'll just maybe I can give a title to my thought but the way back to to following the commission and I just feel like that's the inspiration from what our P what was on our pastor's heart so the way back to following the commission so in 1 Peter chapter 2 you know a lot of times Our Testimony is I'm well I'm just a sinner but what the blood did for us is it's changed us you you know the scripture says in First Corinthians you are new creatures in Christ Jesus behold all things are passed away behold all things are made new how many can testify that your life's not the same that it used to be because there's a God that come on the scene amen he spoke the words of life to you you had a heart to believe it and God fulfilled and manifest what he he's the only interpreter of his word amen the Liberty that we experience is because God has interpreted his word to us Amen in First Peter chapter 2 praise the Lord hopefully I don't get carried away with time I I know the last time I was I was thinking it was Wednesday and so like that clock is wrong oh my the scripture says there in First Peter chapter 2 and verse one it says wherefore lying laying aside all malice and all Gile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speaking as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow hereby if so be that you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto the Lively Stone the living Stone disallowed indeed of man but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen and so we just you know know we just had this thought about you know the way back to following the commission and I you know as I was pondering in that um prayer meeting you know it just sometimes in life you know we lose we lose our vision of why God came by our way and spoke to us you know how many here can say God spoke to me I mean that every single one of us should have a testimony God spoke to me amen really because that we're not even on first base as the carnal way of saying it you know we got to hear from God and how does God speak you know some people say well God spoke to me in the sunset and the the songs of the birds and you know I just seen the way people conduct themselves and oh God speaks to me there's a people that still honor God and I you know people can but God always speaks by his word it has to have a scriptural voice and so we got to stay with the word amen and so I got to thinking about you know when the Trials come and you're in a fiery fliction when you're in the furnace and when you turn this way there's Well's belly like Jonah you know you look this way and it's troubles it's insurmountable to human ability you look this way and I can't see a way past this everywhere you look is troubles but but once more will I look to the one who made the promise and we have to put our eyes back on what it was that God spoke to us in the beginning he told those disciples he said go into all the world what what I've done for you go tell somebody else so I just thought you know what is the purpose why God spoke to us you know each one of us you know because God is not just going to talk to us just to show that he can talk to us there's a reason there's a purpose in what he speaks to us amen and it's so personal every single one of us must receive the word of God as a personal commission it's my duty this is what I'm called to I'm called to fulfill this word of God Amen and as I was praying I was like you know I'm called out to serve his purpose purposes you know and something that as Brother David was going through the uh Church age I thought I'd read this because this is out of the Ephesians church and um not sure exactly what paragraph This is but it says this in the Ephesian Church age these Ephesians were Christians they bore a name and that name was Christ who was the spirit of God within them and which was one of the three-fold names of their lord and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted these Believers were were not laboring for Paul or for an organization they weren't committing committed to programs and institutions whereby they build up Holdings of value they worked for the Lord when God speaks he's got something for you to do do and it's not for man it's for God we got to keep our eyes on the price we got to stay personal this is my duty to God he saved me I only owe him my everything why do we hold back are there secret things in our lives that we want to say well I can't give that to him because well he can't do nothing with it well I tell you if you will sell out everything else if you trust it into God's hands I don't care what it is if it's in his hands he could use it now don't tell them how to use it I told the Lord after I got the men in gidas I said Lord I'll serve you all the rest of my days no more arguing that's the challenge that's the challenge God you can use me to do this and to do that but don't don't use me to do that my Lord help us amen help me they didn't go to church on Sunday and talk about the name and then forget about it the rest of the week they didn't give lip service to his name no sir they was it was their lives they were given and all they did they did in that name you know if you can't do something in jesus' name leave it alone right if you got a question about it don't play games we want our faith to be pure we want to be able to walk forward and know I I have no condemnation in my heart amen all they did they did in his name and that name in the name they acted but if they could not act in that name they refrain from acting these were Heavenly places these were Heavenly placed Christians who Behavior was in the Lord but the false Vine the group that wanted to defile the name and hung the skulling wolves in the dark waiting to get in and tear down but the Saints stood the test and kept the word and the name how many know you come here to be tested lift your hand if you know you've come here to be tested amen I've come here to be tested the test is the greatest thing for you with no test no overcoming if you're facing a test it's because God has confidence that if you'll commit it to him and let him lead you he'll give you the victory because he's already conquered it he's conquered the worst H death hell and the grave he made us to where we were impotent we couldn't we couldn't produce the Son of God or the daughter of God we always wanted to do I don't want to do that I don't want to be like that I don't want to talk like that I don't want to act like that but praise God when we come in contact with a life that had some kind of living character oh my we had a dying character we just lived for ourselves but like we heard when we go to that day on Calvary and we have we understand what that day on Calvary meant for me changes everything because we no longer are bound to our sin nature our selfish nature I me my and everything else is mine too sometimes we get these attitudes like this is my church this is my Pew and you know they don't control the things like I would do them oh my goodness gracious Lord help me the complaint of God Revelations 2:4 nevertheless I have somewhat against thee that because thou has left thy first love to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone these are this message is to the entire age which would last about 120 years its message then is to all the generations in that span you know one of the things that brother brandom taught and I I'm paraphrasing so I'm just kind of going out there but you know when you go through and you look at all of the church ages there's a rebuke and a complaint but then there's an admonition you know and from the day of Ephesus from the start of where Paul was preaching and he was seeing all this was coming in and it was who is going to get like quick quick go down into the ground but we at the end time all of the reward to the Overcomer we have access to Ephesians they just had access to the the reward of the first age Overcomer the second age Overcomer the third age Overcomer but oh my we're such a privileged people that we can take and have the full reward if we'll just steal away and get along with God and let him speak to us again oh my oh my think that God wants to have this kind of fellowship with us you know that's part of his purpose in speaking to us he's like I got so much for you but sometimes we're so filled up with other things it's hard to empty out and let go that's what we were do we were made to empty out and a lot of times we get tricked into holding on to stuff you know entertainments you know movies video games you know you name it success in business money chasing after careers or whatever we get all filled up we're all guilty of it but God says if you would just surrender and give your future to me I'll make it exactly what I promised it'll be I and you and you and me oh what a Divine Fellowship I don't want to lose the I don't want to lose the purpose which God has called me to why he spoke to me in the first place oh my I've been called out from Egypt not to look like the world but to look like a Son of God under the tutorship of the Holy Ghost the tutorship of the Holy Ghost led me to this message Led you to this message he wants you to be a fruit bearing tree a brid tree that's rose up and has end time fruit cuz there's been an end time seed sign it's been Jesus Christ coming to speak to you and say you come from the mind of God I have things for you I have I know my thoughts towards you thoughts of Peace not of evil to bring you to an expected end you know it's just when you when you seek the Lord with all of your heart you know sometimes we give half hearted offerings to God halfhearted you know our sacrifice can only go so far today tired I don't feel like it but oh God let the Insight man have preeminence cuz there's no weakness in there but it's when we blend the carnal mind and try to be in that lukewarm God I'll just give you part of me but he deserves all of us amen amen amen amen oh my where am I at you know it's that's where true worship happens when we can surrender all when God spoke to me in March 2nd 2002 I you know I was just in the world really just a nominal believer and never heard the message but you know I I really believe that there was more in life than just living a half-hearted life you know still in the world believing that there was more I just couldn't I couldn't attend to it I didn't have that something that could overcome I never come in contact with the message of the hour at that time but I had a longing all I had was a longing I was hungry you know and we know that hungry children will eat out the garbage can so I'm trying to take in this preacher and that preacher and this preacher and that preacher listening to Radio preaching trying to fill up but never victory over the sin in my life and one day by The Sovereign choosing of God God spoke to me I was talking to my mom on the phone I've shared this testimony before but she told me I was at work and she called at lunch she said you know I just want to let you know when you get off of work I know you're working but why don't you stop by the hospital we had to take your grandmother to the hospital she was having shortness of breath and I was under the intoxication of my lunch break and just being worldly and you know gifts and callings are without repentance you either have a
