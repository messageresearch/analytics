[24:34] behalf or every situation
[24:37] Lord but you said there's
[24:40] a a

[39:53] salvation oh gracious Heavenly Father
[39:58] father how you went down and walked
[40:02] through the Earth
[40:05] and found
[40:07] us Lord like in a scrap
[40:13] pile and you purchased
[40:19] us and then you cleaned us up
[40:23] and you molded us in made us into
[40:27] something that you
[40:31] desired and you put your own Glory upon
[40:35] it Lord and nobody can buy it
[40:39] back oh I'm so grateful for that yes
[40:43] it's
[40:44] yours father we the purchase of the
[40:47] price of
[40:50] Calvary Lord and we rest in that this
[40:53] evening and we're so grateful for that
[40:55] father
[40:57] we just ask
[40:59] that you would bless us tonight and help
[41:03] us
[41:04] understand what our faith is
[41:07] in our faith is not in a hope so or in a
[41:12] might be but our faith is in the
[41:16] revealed word of God that it will happen
[41:21] exactly the way that you said it would
[41:24] we trust in that in Jesus name we pray
[41:29] amen amen we're going to continue this
[41:33] evening and listen to another 40 minutes
[41:36] uh from the message uh I I believe it's
[41:41] um God's power to transform or God's
[41:46] transforming power I keep getting them
[41:48] mixed up and so the the purpose of what
[41:52] that we're uh doing is we want to build
[41:56] our faith we're going to have to have
[41:59] faith in a measure that we've never had
[42:03] it before and we've got to uh totally
[42:09] understand where that you're standing
[42:12] and so this message really explains
[42:15] what's transpiring all around you and if
[42:19] you can see what's transpiring around
[42:22] you and who that you are and in your
[42:27] election is going to build your faith
[42:29] because if he started a work in you
[42:32] he'll finish it to the end and all the
[42:35] father hath given me will come so and
[42:41] our scripture that uh we read was in
[42:43] Romans and you remember in that
[42:46] scripture I'm sorry I can't read it but
[42:48] he said be ye not be not uh be ye
[42:53] transformed and not conformed
[42:56] and so this is God's power to transform
[42:59] you and no matter how bad this world is
[43:03] he has the power to turn you into what
[43:06] he wants you to be and to fulfill his
[43:10] promise in you and so we're happy to
[43:14] play the message I don't believe you can
[43:17] separate the message from the messenger
[43:20] I believe it with all my heart that our
[43:24] Salvation is tied
[43:26] to receiving God's word for the age that
[43:30] we live in so let's just have a prayer
[43:33] we'll start playing the message you may
[43:35] be seated uh is is this the what is this

[44:38] he made his mistake and there's where
[44:40] you'll make the mistake there's where
[44:41] I'll make the mistake the very minute we
[44:43] walk out of the presence of God Cain
[44:45] went from the presence of the Lord and
[44:47] dwelt in the land of not on the East of
[44:50] Eden see how religious it was went
[44:52] around to the east side east side and
[44:54] Cain knew his wife and she conceived and
[44:56] bear Enoch and Enoch buildt a
[45:01] city see
[45:05] civilization he built a city and called
[45:08] the name of the city after the name of
[45:10] his son Enoch and
[45:13] Enos was born aod and Aid be uh and aod
[45:18] be took unto him two wives the name of
[45:22] the one was Adra and the name of the
[45:26] other was
[45:27] zela and Adra bar jabel and the father
[45:32] of such dwelt in tents and of such that
[45:34] has cattle and his brother's name was
[45:39] jubil I guess ju ubl he was the father
[45:43] as such as handled the harps and organs
[45:46] see music sign coming in and Ze also
[45:50] bear tuban an instructor of ever um uh
[45:58] a r t i f i c e r a brass and iron in
[46:01] other words kind of molding putting it
[46:04] together and uh the sister of tub tuban
[46:08] was naam and liik said unto his wives
[46:12] adri and Zella hear my voice ye wives of
[46:16] lamech hearken unto my speech for I have
[46:19] slay a man to
[46:23] my wounding and a young man to my heart
[46:27] if can shall be a ventage seven times
[46:29] truly liic 7 s folds Sevenfold now
[46:34] notice as soon as they went out from the
[46:38] presence of the Lord they started
[46:40] building cities they started making
[46:42] instruments they started in science they
[46:45] making brass and iron and playing music
[46:48] and so forth
[46:50] see see now where did it come from who
[46:53] went out
[46:54] king the serpent
[46:56] seed understand it Cain went out and
[47:00] notice he went out from the presence of
[47:03] the Lord and started working in
[47:05] science now look where he's Still
[47:07] Working Science Education cities culture
[47:12] it's of the devil who started it the
[47:16] devil who is it on today the devil
[47:19] atomic bombs and things to destroy us we
[47:22] live in it we have to live here we're a
[47:24] being we have to here but God's Great
[47:27] civilization won't have any of that in
[47:28] it see and science is taking is taking
[47:32] the natural things and perverting it to
[47:34] do things that it wasn't intended to
[47:37] do and so is scientific religion it
[47:40] takes a word of God and makes a church
[47:42] organization out of it instead of doing
[47:44] the things that it's supposed to do they
[47:47] said the days of Miracles is passed the
[47:49] Bible said he's the same yesterday and
[47:50] forever there is no such a thing as
[47:52] Divine Healing go ye into all the world
[47:54] and preach the gospel ever creature
[47:56] these signs shall follow them that
[47:57] believe in my name they shall cast out
[47:59] Devils they'll speak with new tongues if
[48:01] they take up serpents or drink that they
[48:02] think that won't harm them if they lay
[48:04] their hands on the sick they shall
[48:05] recover well all nations everybody Every
[48:09] Creature oh I am with you even to the
[48:11] end of the Earth into the the world
[48:13] Cosmos the whole thing into the
[48:15] consummation these absolutely there and
[48:19] now see they take signs and say oh well
[48:22] as long as we gather together in johar
[48:24] church and we become this a good
[48:26] straight member we pay our uh see it's
[48:28] it's not saying oh there is no such a
[48:30] thing as God you heard my tape on the
[48:32] false Christ in the last days see not
[48:34] the false Jesus Satan know better than
[48:37] that see but false Christ Christ means
[48:39] the anointed one and they're actually
[48:40] anointed Anointed with what the Holy
[48:44] Spirit to do signs and wonders and they
[48:47] do it but see when it comes down now
[48:49] we're in the last age not back in the
[48:51] Pentecostal age there we're over here in
[48:53] the last age in the first age begin with
[48:56] the word which was Christ and the last
[48:58] age has to end with the word which is
[49:01] Christ and these other things is Shucks
[49:03] and so forth explained is just carriers
[49:06] of the word to serve its purpose until
[49:09] it comes into the full statute see of
[49:11] what the original Green was now 25th
[49:13] verse and Adam knew his wife again and
[49:16] she bear a son and called his name Seth
[49:21] for God said she has appointed me
[49:24] another seed and instead of Abel whom
[49:27] Cain slew and to Seth and to Seth to him
[49:31] also there was born a son and he called
[49:34] his name enus and then man be to call on
[49:39] the name of the Lord see how that
[49:43] serpent seed went off into science
[49:46] education cities music and great things
[49:49] and education and Science and so forth
[49:51] but the seed of the righteous one who it
[49:55] was see Eve didn't have a seed you know
[49:58] that the woman doesn't have a seed
[50:00] female she has an egg but not a seed but
[50:02] she appointed a seed see appointed for
[50:04] God's appointment she took the seed the
[50:06] great seed course from the woman was
[50:08] that God gave seed God appointed her a
[50:10] seed instead of the one that Cain slew
[50:13] that the enemy death Serpent's Seed slew
[50:17] God's seed in perversion there you see
[50:19] God appointed to the woman a seed which
[50:22] is
[50:23] Christ see to bring back The Original
[50:26] Seed again you see it and so you see the
[50:30] perversion brought death through
[50:31] education and intelligence and what we
[50:34] call today science and religion and so
[50:36] forth it brought death but she appointed
[50:39] him the SE and then man be to call upon
[50:42] the name of the Lord it begin to come
[50:44] back to the word again see and remember
[50:48] follow that seed as we track it in a few
[50:50] weeks on this serpent you follow that it
[50:52] switches right through the scripture
[50:54] watch it and two Vines grow right
[50:56] together as you heard my message on the
[50:57] vines they come right up together and so
[50:59] close together that it would almost
[51:02] deceive the very elected if possible in
[51:04] the last days when they come to the Head
[51:06] it puts forth a grain just like a wheat
[51:08] but it isn't a wheat see it isn't it's a
[51:10] shf yet now see there's civilization
[51:14] education I think I've got about 10 more
[51:17] scriptures you see WR down there but I
[51:18] think not to go through that but we
[51:20] understand by this that education
[51:22] science and civilization is of the devil
[51:27] right it isn't of God it is of the devil
[51:31] now I don't say you shouldn't have it no
[51:33] certainly not a little later on I can
[51:36] would prove that that God just like you
[51:38] wearing clothes you women Us Men We
[51:40] wern't supposed to wear clothes in the
[51:41] beginning but see we live in this age we
[51:44] do we must wear clothes see it's
[51:46] appointed to us to do that we must wear
[51:48] them but in the beginning we didn't have
[51:50] to see because we knew no sin but now we
[51:53] have to now we have to have a moiles now
[51:56] we must go places and visit and so forth
[51:58] in automobiles in science and so forth
[52:00] but it isn't of God it is not of God
[52:04] education but there God's form of
[52:07] Education civilization science is in its
[52:10] original condition it goes beyond this
[52:13] what we're doing now look they take uh
[52:16] uh certain things and put certain things
[52:17] together and it makes a chemical that
[52:19] will destroy now leave them in their
[52:21] right position they're all right put
[52:23] them together you're all wrong see see
[52:26] it brings death and when you try to take
[52:28] the word of God and put it in religion
[52:30] of this world you bring death to
[52:32] yourself it kills the
[52:34] subject see what I mean it kills the
[52:37] person you say well now look you believe
[52:39] in god oh now you don't have to believe
[52:41] that you you you are church right then
[52:44] that's the boom that kills a it kills a
[52:46] subject you've got to let everything
[52:49] fall aside and take the word
[52:51] only stay right with that word don't
[52:54] leave when God said so that's just what
[52:56] it is I don't care what education can
[52:58] prove in the days of Noah they could
[52:59] prove there was no water up there in the
[53:01] skies but God said there was coming some
[53:02] down and he come that's right they say
[53:05] today there's no fire out there to fall
[53:06] but watch it fall one day how we go to
[53:09] do this and do that watch God do it he
[53:11] he said it would do it and that seed
[53:13] will take a hold somewhere glory to God
[53:15] the only thing he's looking for today is
[53:17] a beding ground somewhere it can bed
[53:20] it'll start in somebody it'll pervert it
[53:21] spray it like it at Eve it started in
[53:23] Eve for her to bed forth and bring forth
[53:25] sons of God not Sons of Satan but she
[53:28] was a betting ground and it fell in the
[53:30] wrong place so will the word fall in an
[53:33] unbeliever or doubter or skeptic true
[53:36] you don't make a church member out of
[53:38] never a son or daughter of God you tell
[53:40] them what their hair girl they laugh in
[53:42] your face they tell them to do this or
[53:44] that man do it they laugh in your face
[53:46] it's not sons of God it's a wrong
[53:47] betting ground yet they're holding the
[53:49] seed see the false anointed
[53:53] ones they're anointed yes with the Holy
[53:55] Spirit speak in tongues and do signs and
[53:57] wonders but it's of
[53:59] Satan Jesus said many will come to me in
[54:02] that day and say Lord Lord have not I
[54:03] cast out devils and work great Mighty
[54:05] works and wonders in your name he said
[54:07] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[54:10] what is
[54:11] Iniquity David said if I conceive
[54:13] iniquity in my heart God will not hear
[54:14] me
[54:15] see iniquity is something that you know
[54:18] that you ought to do and you won't do it
[54:20] you know better but won't do it it's
[54:22] iniquity see you know these your St with
[54:25] the word of God but for the church sake
[54:26] or somebody else's sake or something
[54:28] else you'll stray from the word of God
[54:30] and do what the organization says well I
[54:32] don't know my church says we should do
[54:34] it this way and I believe it this way
[54:36] and you right before you that you
[54:38] shouldn't do it that's iniquity depart
[54:40] from you you that work iniquity look at
[54:42] the great St Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 He
[54:44] said though I speak with tongue of men
[54:46] and angels you that want somebody wanted
[54:48] to lay on to that that's the evidence of
[54:50] the Holy Ghost Paul said though I speak
[54:52] with tongues like men and angels and
[54:54] have not charity like you all have here
[54:56] I'm nothing see you can speak with
[54:59] tongues yes because it's a word a
[55:02] preacher can take this word and go forth
[55:04] and preach it and say that word and that
[55:06] word will grow but the preacher could be
[55:08] a hypocrite himself it's a word see but
[55:11] the true living creature of God take all
[55:14] of the purpose word man shall not live
[55:15] by bread alone but by every word that
[55:18] proceedeth out and you add something
[55:20] else with that you got a perverted plant
[55:22] if I start out here with a wheat and put
[55:24] a a cuckle bur with it and in breed him
[55:26] together if it could be done so over the
[55:28] pollen and put in that I got a wheat
[55:29] cuckle
[55:31] be see it looks like a wheat yet it's a
[55:34] CLE it ain't genuine life it can't
[55:36] reproduce itself
[55:38] again it'll come forth but it can't
[55:40] reproduce itself a a a donkey can breed
[55:45] to a m horse and she'll bring forth a
[55:48] mule but that mule can't breed back to a
[55:51] mule it's a hybrid let every word bring
[55:53] forth of its kind
[55:55] see it can breed once and the church can
[55:57] come as organization once but it can't
[55:59] rebreed itself it brings out another
[56:01] organization Lutheran can't breed the
[56:03] Lutheran it brought out a Methodist and
[56:05] Methodist brought out a a Pentecostal
[56:07] see it can't rebreed back because it's
[56:10] dead it can't start a Revival where did
[56:12] God ever start a Revival in an
[56:13] organization look over your history he
[56:16] never did it's the organization forms
[56:19] behind the Revival when Luther the man
[56:21] of God came forth to the message of
[56:23] justification behind him come the
[56:24] Lutheran Church they could never could
[56:26] build up then God sent a man by the name
[56:28] of John Wesley there come a Revival
[56:30] behind that what they do organize it
[56:31] never could re ring itself again see
[56:34] it's sterile Hallelujah but the word of
[56:37] God shall ever endure that's right it'll
[56:41] bring forth this time here come a
[56:42] Pentecost along you can't look what it
[56:44] done organized it can't rebreed itself
[56:46] they can have old Roberts and everything
[56:47] else all over the country it cannot do
[56:49] it it'll hang right back to that old
[56:51] natural breed of the mule it cannot no
[56:54] matter how many CS it has is still how
[56:57] many of the spiritual um Affairs it has
[57:01] and whatever it has is you you're adults
[57:03] you know what I'm talking about no
[57:05] matter how many husband and wives it has
[57:07] and whatever more how many little
[57:09] sisters it builds up out here and little
[57:10] churches and organizations it cannot
[57:13] read a Revival it's finished it crossed
[57:16] up to the world from the word of God and
[57:18] it cannot reproduce itself again God
[57:21] raise up some other something and start
[57:23] his word moving on if it organizes it'll
[57:26] die
[57:27] too right it cannot reproduce itself
[57:30] because it's a
[57:32] hybrid correctly look at your hybrid
[57:34] corn today they say that's the best corn
[57:36] it's it's a killer it's what's killing
[57:39] you your lives wasn't made for your
[57:42] bodies wasn't made for that your bodies
[57:45] was made for the original grain that's
[57:47] the reason your fathers and mothers and
[57:48] so forth live longer that's the reason
[57:50] they were tough man 70 80 years old was
[57:53] rough and tough see they lived on the
[57:55] Natural Things watch these old mountain
[57:56] man out here live on deer and and the
[57:59] original grains put a man in here in a
[58:01] city here he comes along a big SLO but
[58:03] about 35 40 years old
[58:05] soft
[58:07] certainly H get off the subject don't no
[58:11] but I'm trying to get it over to you
[58:12] that's civilization what we call culture
[58:15] culture you hear so much about
[58:17] that uh you ever hear what my estimation
[58:19] of culture was it's a man that ain't got
[58:22] nerve enough to kill a rabbit but can
[58:24] eat a belly full of after somebody else
[58:26] kills it so that's what I I I I think a
[58:28] culture is it's it's
[58:31] right we don't God don't come there a
[58:34] culture of man into God you don't
[58:36] civilize him into God he's born a seed
[58:39] of God from God always was God and can
[58:43] never be nothing else but God you're not
[58:45] cultured into it now how he has his kind
[58:50] of eeden and by deformed seed Satan has
[58:54] made his great e even in great Eden now
[58:55] what is it culture science beautiful
[58:59] churches High Steeples fine polished
[59:01] preachers education d a d PhD LL D
[59:06] doctor of literature doctor of divinity
[59:08] doctors every time he's pronounced that
[59:09] it just takes him that much farther from
[59:11] God the St in PL away and the
[59:13] congregations don't want somebody St
[59:15] there and use their words to hit H and
[59:17] tote and carry and fetch they don't want
[59:18] that they want some beautiful something
[59:21] that's the same thing Kean had on his
[59:23] mind or daddy at the beginning offered
[59:25] flowers and fruits of the land when God
[59:27] wanted
[59:28] sacrifice a man with the revelation of
[59:31] God it was blood not a pear or peach or
[59:34] Plum or whatever it was or ocot as they
[59:36] say now it was a blood that brought us
[59:40] out of the Gard of being a a degraded
[59:43] blood a woman that let the seed of the
[59:46] wrong person be planted in the womb and
[59:49] start it now we find to prove the
[59:51] messeng is is timely what I'm speaking
[59:53] to you about to Pro it look at the days
[59:56] of high breeding today trying to make a
[59:58] prettier
[59:59] species look at high breeding look in
[1:00:01] the plant life here last summer as this
[1:00:04] summer it was I had a little wild flower
[1:00:07] you showing me out there a few minutes
[1:00:08] ago come on my mind little wild flower I
[1:00:09] had in a bed there I had to water that
[1:00:11] thing twice a day to keep it alive it
[1:00:13] was a hybrid but it originated from
[1:00:15] another little yellow flower which was
[1:00:17] put together but something else to make
[1:00:19] this flower and that little guy stood
[1:00:20] out there when you could dig 10 feet in
[1:00:22] the ground and couldn't find even a
[1:00:24] enough marer to spit see it was it was
[1:00:28] it was just living in the dust and it
[1:00:30] was just this pretty and it didn't have
[1:00:31] to be
[1:00:33] watered it was original it wasn't hybrid
[1:00:37] it was nothing mixed to it it was
[1:00:38] genuine flour and this is something
[1:00:41] mixed with it had to water it and pet it
[1:00:43] and baby it see this you didn't no bugs
[1:00:46] got on it we had to spray it and
[1:00:48] everything else to keep them flies and
[1:00:50] gats and things on off like you don't
[1:00:52] kill them you don't have KN when come
[1:00:54] near you
[1:00:55] oh that's a real genuine born again
[1:00:58] Christian you can temp him with anything
[1:01:00] you want to he's still a Christian tempt
[1:01:03] her wherever you want to be she's still
[1:01:05] a Christian little lady from one of your
[1:01:08] brothers here some of your people their
[1:01:09] Church wrote me a letter today said
[1:01:11] Daddy don't want me to go to baseball or
[1:01:13] basketball game brother BR We Believe
[1:01:15] said was 12 years old said brother BR we
[1:01:17] believe you have the word of the Lord
[1:01:19] and what you tell us now said I kind of
[1:01:21] think Daddy's wrong but said what you
[1:01:23] say I'm going to bleed now sweet little
[1:01:24] girl see I thought well I said honey
[1:01:28] look if you are a Christian you're a
[1:01:30] Christian anywhere no matter where you
[1:01:31] at you're still a Christian but I said
[1:01:34] you see on the basketball floor what
[1:01:35] Daddy's thinking about you hear them
[1:01:37] kids swearing and carrying on like that
[1:01:38] I still believe you'd be a Christian but
[1:01:40] you see Daddy's more advanced in life
[1:01:42] than you are see I said now you're 12
[1:01:44] years old you said you had a little
[1:01:45] sister four now she wants you to cut
[1:01:47] paper dolls oh go on I ain't got no time
[1:01:48] to cut paper doll see you're a far Advan
[1:01:51] in little sister uh that's where the
[1:01:53] church ought to be today further
[1:01:55] advanced in the word of God not
[1:01:56] Methodist Baptist Pentecostals
[1:01:58] Presbyterian but advanced in the word
[1:02:01] the Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:03] God all right all right the message
[1:02:06] being timely proved by science by his
[1:02:09] science and research you see they have
[1:02:11] tried to pervert everything make a
[1:02:13] different seed make a different
[1:02:14] something make it prettier look at our
[1:02:16] sisters I remarked a while ago about how
[1:02:18] pretty they look oh you might stand them
[1:02:21] up out here in a World's contest with
[1:02:23] some of this Glory swan or some of these
[1:02:25] strip teasers and things over here in
[1:02:27] California they miss it a million miles
[1:02:28] but they M ain't on that book of Fame
[1:02:32] it's on the Book of Life see a Meek and
[1:02:35] a humble spirit is a great treasure to
[1:02:38] God and the Bible said for for our women
[1:02:41] to Adorn themselves with a Meek and
[1:02:43] humble Spirit subject to your husband
[1:02:46] and sweetness that's what's a great
[1:02:47] price and sign of God that's right not
[1:02:50] all this year that's what they done they
[1:02:52] Max Factor has be beautified women
[1:02:55] outwardly which is of Satan all that
[1:02:57] stuff is of the devil do you know that
[1:03:01] certainly it's all of the devil I
[1:03:03] remember my little wife when she's
[1:03:05] pretty and young she didn't wear makeup
[1:03:06] no she come up I baptized her in the
[1:03:08] name of Jesus when she's little KNE
[1:03:09] dresses like
[1:03:11] that but now she's getting old she said
[1:03:13] I'm just getting so wrinkled I said you
[1:03:16] know as you get older my eyes get dimmer
[1:03:19] I remember the way you was and I
[1:03:20] remember KN in my heart what you're
[1:03:22] going to be some
[1:03:24] with a quiet and sweet spirit that you
[1:03:26] have God will get us together you know
[1:03:29] around that's that then would never be
[1:03:31] changed then so why but you see in the
[1:03:35] days of Noah when the sons of God saw
[1:03:37] the daughters of man were pretty they
[1:03:42] taken unto them women for wives see the
[1:03:45] sons of God saw the daughters man
[1:03:47] because they were sexy and and dressed
[1:03:48] like that they they lusted for the women
[1:03:51] and they went for them see um thankfully
[1:03:54] but you sons of God seen beyond that H
[1:03:57] that women make themselves see but what
[1:03:58] is it it's all pretty it's a high
[1:04:01] breeding take some of them wased your
[1:04:03] face a you wouldn't know what you had
[1:04:07] see that's right maybe enough dier to
[1:04:10] find a bus all and and nasty and
[1:04:13] honoring and filthy and run around with
[1:04:15] other men I don't care what my wife I I
[1:04:19] respect loyalty in anymore when I was a
[1:04:21] little boy I always said if a negro
[1:04:23] woman wanted to be I shed the last drop
[1:04:25] of my blood to keep her that way I
[1:04:28] respect what's right a right thing I've
[1:04:30] tried to live that all my life I was
[1:04:32] young then now I'm old I haven't changed
[1:04:35] my ideas a bit see sign in the same
[1:04:38] pattern Eve did he also has done to the
[1:04:41] church pervert her over he carried out
[1:04:45] his plans today through his hybrid
[1:04:47] Church his modern Eden that we have
[1:04:49] today we're living in a scientific
[1:04:53] Eden Satan's Eden a scientific Eden if
[1:04:57] you want to turn to it now Isaiah 14:12
[1:05:00] I quote it to you if you want to if you
[1:05:02] want 12 and 14 Satan said in his own
[1:05:04] self I will exalt myself above the most
[1:05:07] high you'll have a kingdom that he be
[1:05:10] even the sons of God would worship him
[1:05:12] and that's just exactly what he's done
[1:05:14] he's done it through church religion
[1:05:17] like he started in the beginning
[1:05:18] religion he's done it also as the
[1:05:21] prophet Paul seen in 2 Thessalonians the
[1:05:23] second chapter he he heads up in E his
[1:05:27] great scientific Eden in this day in
[1:05:30] scientific and education civilization
[1:05:33] and has made himself and will finally
[1:05:36] head up in ecumenical council where all
[1:05:39] churches will have to bow to him and see
[1:05:42] what it is it's that Spirit of delusion
[1:05:45] working among the people sons of God
[1:05:47] which were made in the image of God and
[1:05:49] Daughters of man which was made in the
[1:05:50] image of man has taken them under
[1:05:52] falsehood like he did Eve and has formed
[1:05:55] himself through his own gimmicks of
[1:05:57] Science and education and culture to
[1:05:59] he's got himself a modern scientific
[1:06:02] death Eden where God by his word spoke
[1:06:05] and he had a Eden without death no
[1:06:08] science no education like we have today
[1:06:11] or no
[1:06:13] civilization You See It Now understand
[1:06:15] it now he's got his Eden look all the
[1:06:19] churches worship Him second
[1:06:21] Thessalonians said that man who calls
[1:06:24] himself God sitting in the temple of God
[1:06:27] all upon the Earth shall bow down and
[1:06:28] worship Him whose names were not written
[1:06:30] in the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:06:32] foundation of the earth see it's a
[1:06:33] modern Eden now what's he done himself
[1:06:36] he's moving himself
[1:06:38] Rome this final great eating edting
[1:06:40] place you see why the pope come over
[1:06:42] here the other day you know what all
[1:06:43] them 13s that happened then he spoke 13
[1:06:45] words had 13 taking communion uh uh SP

[1:06:54] Revelation 13 stripes 13 stars 13 bars
[1:06:57] 13 numbers on the coins 13 stars on the
[1:06:59] co everything's 13 and a
[1:07:01] woman here comes the Pope the head to
[1:07:04] the woman the false Antichrist to the
[1:07:06] false bride of science which our world
[1:07:09] our American Eastern World here Western
[1:07:12] world has led the world in science comes
[1:07:15] to her in his scientific church and now
[1:07:17] the whole prence is bwing to
[1:07:19] him on
[1:07:22] 13 this
[1:07:25] everything is a 13 our whole nation
[1:07:27] everything else is 13 A Woman's World
[1:07:30] see here we are we got it it turned into
[1:07:33] a woman's world the Garden of the Eden
[1:07:35] but it'll be God's world someday notice
[1:07:37] now also the uh these prophets and
[1:07:41] things is foretold it and now all again
[1:07:43] has come like it was before God moved
[1:07:47] upon the Earth it's become a spiritual
[1:07:52] chaos certainly it had
[1:07:54] here notice the second eent type closely
[1:07:58] to the first to deceive almost to take
[1:08:01] the elected notice now I'm going to
[1:08:03] compare here just a few minutes I'm
[1:08:05] going to have to stop because it's 11:00
[1:08:07] and um so listen these two Edens how
[1:08:11] this Eden has tried to type just like
[1:08:14] Satan did at the beginning to Eve in the
[1:08:16] real Eden the first Eden just watch them
[1:08:18] type together now see we got now
[1:08:21] everybody understand clearly a
[1:08:22] scientific Eden we're living in see now
[1:08:27] it wasn't God's Eden God's Eden doesn't
[1:08:30] come with Science Education culture it
[1:08:32] comes by the word calling all these
[1:08:35] things as though they were not notice in
[1:08:38] the Garden of Eden that's just compar
[1:08:40] now notice the man and his wife head of
[1:08:43] in the Garden of Eden the pair was naked
[1:08:46] and didn't know it is that right and
[1:08:50] God's Eden the pair was naked and didn't
[1:08:52] know it now they are naked again and
[1:08:55] don't know it Revelations 3 the lady of
[1:08:58] seean church because Thou Art
[1:09:00] naked miserable poor wretched blind and
[1:09:06] don't know it now in God's Eden they
[1:09:09] were naked and didn't know it and now in
[1:09:11] Satan's Eden they by science and
[1:09:14] education they're naked again and don't
[1:09:16] know it what a perversion look at today
[1:09:20] look at man trying to wear his wife's
[1:09:23] underne clothes and she's trying to wear
[1:09:26] his clothes and he's trying to let his
[1:09:29] hair grow like hers and she's cutting
[1:09:30] hers off like
[1:09:32] his oh my man try to be women women try
[1:09:36] to be man a perversion that's the same
[1:09:39] thing the church is doing same thing the
[1:09:41] lady of see and age notice the reason
[1:09:44] that they didn't know they were naked in
[1:09:45] the beginning there was a holy spirit
[1:09:48] Veil them from nakedness they didn't
[1:09:50] know it the Holy Spirit was over their
[1:09:52] eyes they seen nothing but their brother
[1:09:54] and sister LW they didn't know they were
[1:09:57] Holy Spirit now the spirit of unholiness
[1:10:01] un cleansiness and
[1:10:03] lust has veiled him education
[1:10:08] science why it's scientific where shorts
[1:10:10] is cooler the Indians teach you better
[1:10:14] than that they wrap up in a blanket to
[1:10:15] be air conditioned see and put on them
[1:10:18] see education has absolutely come back
[1:10:21] to a Time the very thing that they think
[1:10:23] that brought to culture and civilization
[1:10:26] has put them back in ignorance again
[1:10:29] worse than there was in the first
[1:10:31] place schooling education look at
[1:10:33] schools look down there at University

[1:13:46] to because I got so much I never get to
[1:13:48] it anyhow to of things so maybe I can
[1:13:51] come back again and get it to you oh I
[1:13:54] just got through preaching the other day
[1:13:55] a thinking man's filter you all read
[1:13:58] that produces a holy man's taste think
[1:14:02] Breen whatever you do think Ephesians
[1:14:04] 5:26 and there said and we talk about
[1:14:07] the word of predestinated you see that
[1:14:10] stumbles so many am it's God's word he
[1:14:13] uses it for we're predestinated by the
[1:14:15] word of God and it uh and that we when
[1:14:18] you're predestinated well it has to
[1:14:20] happen because it is a God God chose you
[1:14:22] because he know what you do from the
[1:14:24] beginning don't let the devil spray you
[1:14:26] with education and poison and stuff like
[1:14:28] that you have to be modern you have to
[1:14:30] be this you don't have to be nothing but
[1:14:32] Sons and Daughters of God if you're born
[1:14:34] of the word you do notice that spray of
[1:14:38] you take a seed a good seed and you
[1:14:40] spray
[1:14:41] it it'll it'll kill it and when they
[1:14:44] spray this denominational stuff over the
[1:14:46] top of you it'll ruin the influence of
[1:14:48] the original word if they tell you have
[1:14:50] to do this all the other girls do it the
[1:14:51] other man do it don't you believe that
[1:14:53] it'll ruin God's influence of his word
[1:14:56] upon you you know that our text says
[1:14:59] don't be conformed sprayed but be
[1:15:02] transformed the seed that's in you
[1:15:04] people of the day act like they don't
[1:15:06] even believe there is a God do you know
[1:15:09] that they act like that now I don't want
[1:15:11] to call them fools but they act like it
[1:15:14] for Psalms 141 says the fool is said in
[1:15:18] his heart there is no God you shouldn't
[1:15:21] call a person a fool but they certainly
[1:15:22] Act like they are because they don't
[1:15:24] they act like there is no God this word
[1:15:26] is just ignored look here the other day
[1:15:28] they called me room to watch Billy Paul
[1:15:30] I believe there some of them had said
[1:15:31] there was a a religious program on the
[1:15:33] television we don't have television
[1:15:35] won't be one in my home never but there
[1:15:37] was a if you want them that's up to you
[1:15:39] but God told me not to do it and uh when
[1:15:42] we moved in our rent from this sweet old
[1:15:44] sister up there she had a television
[1:15:45] because they had to have it for to rent
[1:15:47] her house and I let him look at a
[1:15:49] religious program so they were they
[1:15:50] called and said there was a gospel
[1:15:52] singing on and you talk about a bunch of
[1:15:54] Ricky up there act like they call
[1:15:57] themselves gospel singers it was a
[1:15:59] discredit to Jesus Christ to see the way
[1:16:02] he kind of shaking themselves and and
[1:16:04] these Ricky fied haircuts and everything
[1:16:05] you know it just it just look it just
[1:16:08] look like is a mockery came of such a
[1:16:11] person religious indeed certainly but he
[1:16:14] had the wrong seed in him and therefore
[1:16:18] it brought forth the serpent seed Satan
[1:16:20] had hissed over this seed of Eden and
[1:16:22] that's what brought forth the king he
[1:16:23] put his poison upon him he Kain knew the
[1:16:27] perfect will of God he knew the perfect
[1:16:30] will of God Kain knew it why but he
[1:16:32] refused to do it he proved then to be
[1:16:35] the serpent seed when he seen the
[1:16:37] perfect will of God he refused to do it
[1:16:39] he had seen God vindicate Abel's message
[1:16:42] he know that was the will of God he seen
[1:16:45] God vindicate Abel's message and what
[1:16:47] did God say to him and he just he said
[1:16:51] do the same do worship like your brother
[1:16:53] and and you'll do well but you see he
[1:16:55] seen the perfect will of God but he
[1:16:57] didn't want it he want to add something
[1:16:58] to it and these theologians see this
[1:17:00] Bible they read it but they don't want
[1:17:02] to do it see it shows the serpent seed
[1:17:06] yet seen it Vindicated and and so simply
[1:17:09] before the people but it seems like it's
[1:17:11] so hard for people to Humble themselves
[1:17:12] to the word of God don't you all find
[1:17:14] when you're talking you women to girls
[1:17:16] about wearing long hair and they say why
[1:17:18] you got your hair long see why you wear
[1:17:20] your skirts down long you go talk to
[1:17:22] them they kind of give you the shoulder
[1:17:24] isn't that right see they know that's
[1:17:26] right if there if there's any lady in
[1:17:28] them see they know that's right but you
[1:17:30] see they can't humble themselves to that
[1:17:33] that's what see how Cain did he couldn't
[1:17:34] humble himself to the Vindicated word of
[1:17:36] God he couldn't do it oh even the
[1:17:39] Pentecost glory to God hallelujah I cut
[1:17:41] my hair and speak in tongues that shows
[1:17:44] right there there something wrong the
[1:17:45] seed's bringing forth something
[1:17:46] different a seed cannot a seed of God
[1:17:48] cannot bring forth a bob haired woman it
[1:17:51] cannot do it just can't do it because
[1:17:53] the Bible said so it can't do
[1:17:56] it now it seems so hard to Humble to
[1:18:00] God's word notice this in Genesis 46 and
[1:18:02] 7 Miss reading off some scripture here
[1:18:04] do as Abel did he said if you see what
[1:18:07] your brother said go ahead and do what
[1:18:09] Abel did do the same kind of a service
[1:18:10] that he did and and I'll bless you if
[1:18:13] you don't sin layeth at the door now sin
[1:18:16] is unbelief if you don't do as Abel did
[1:18:18] you seen I Vindicated him and made him
[1:18:20] right now if you don't do that then it
[1:18:23] shows that it's sin unbelief lays at the
[1:18:26] door see and today they see what God
[1:18:28] vindicates they see what God's doing
[1:18:29] they see all these things happening they
[1:18:31] know about it God showing his signs in
[1:18:33] the heaven above and on earth below and
[1:18:34] all these things like that they see
[1:18:36] what's taking place but they won't do it
[1:18:38] see Satan serpent seed smart come out of
[1:18:41] seminaries educated to the spot every
[1:18:44] word every Everything stand up hope it
[1:18:46] just is correct and every word has to be
[1:18:48] exactly their grammar has to be right
[1:18:50] and everything like see sure they can't
[1:18:52] humble themselves oh Gody like that see
[1:18:55] they just can't do it they don't they
[1:18:57] just can't do it now if not sin lies at
[1:19:00] the door unbelief then he become
[1:19:03] willfully
[1:19:04] disobedient and when you know to do good
[1:19:07] and doth not to you it's sin if you know
[1:19:09] what's right and you don't do it see
[1:19:12] then he become will prisent after the
[1:19:14] word had been Vindicated then he crossed
[1:19:16] the separating line then he was ousted
[1:19:19] from Eden when he cross there's a line
[1:19:22] that where you just go so far and if you
[1:19:24] go any further over on the other side
[1:19:26] you're out you know that don't you
[1:19:28] there's a line if you don't believe it
[1:19:30] you read Hebrews 1026 that's the
[1:19:31] scripture I was referring to there see
[1:19:33] for if we sin willfully after we have
[1:19:37] received the knowledge of the truth
[1:19:39] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:19:41] sin that's New Testament that right if
[1:19:43] we sin willfully After we receive the
[1:19:45] knowledge that's been preached to you
[1:19:47] read to you proved to you and to receive
[1:19:49] the knowledge of the truth and you go
[1:19:51] ahead and unbelieve will y there's no
[1:19:53] more sacrifice for sin but a fearful
[1:19:57] looking to the far ignation who shall
[1:19:59] Devour the adversary is that right you
[1:20:03] can cross that line like the children of
[1:20:05] Israel did in their Journey coming
[1:20:07] through the Wilderness Israel did the
[1:20:08] same after they heard Moses message and
[1:20:10] seen it Vindicated listen to a false
[1:20:13] prophet it said oh now look children
[1:20:16] we're all the same we should marry one
[1:20:18] one another and we should do this and
[1:20:19] Moses had told him different and seen
[1:20:21] God Vindicated because bam seemed to be
[1:20:24] a more uh uh instructive man than Moses
[1:20:28] was see he come from a great nation
[1:20:29] where his great people and is all
[1:20:31] organized together the land of Moab
[1:20:33] great armies and great things that the
[1:20:35] people of them days would have feared
[1:20:36] here come a prophet now a prophet
[1:20:38] anointed one false anointed one see come
[1:20:42] down to a anointed one look how close
[1:20:46] and taught the people and many of them
[1:20:48] went after that don't you never forget
[1:20:51] that went after the thing that wasn't
[1:20:54] the word the Vindicated proven word
[1:20:57] don't let someone come in here and tell
[1:20:58] you something different watch what God
[1:21:00] vindicating and proving now then people
[1:21:02] look back say Moses god appeared in the
[1:21:05] skies and the man spoke into existence
[1:21:08] fleas flies frogs took out of existence
[1:21:11] BS and diseases opened up the Red Sea
[1:21:14] and we come and F us Mana Out of Heaven
[1:21:18] oh that's our Prophet but here come
[1:21:20] another Prophet down glory to God I'm
[1:21:21] Prophet too
[1:21:23] say now you all I tell you I I you
[1:21:25] understand I use better grammar than
[1:21:26] Moses and I'm this way and that way see
[1:21:28] so forth and the first thing you know
[1:21:30] they fell apart and every one of them
[1:21:32] perished right in the wilderness not one
[1:21:34] of them lived they never they won't be
[1:21:37] in heaven not one of them Jesus said
[1:21:39] they said our fathers eat man in the
[1:21:41] wilderness see Pentecostal is right
[1:21:43] really come through all the experiences
[1:21:45] they my fathers eat man in the
[1:21:46] wilderness he said and there are
[1:21:47] everyone dead death is eternal
[1:21:50] separation they'll never rise again
[1:21:54] although they've been through all these
[1:21:55] experiences figured he speaking they
[1:21:57] spoken tongues and danced in the spirit
[1:21:59] and everything but when it come to the
[1:22:01] showdown between the word between two
[1:22:03] prophets one of them on the word and the
[1:22:04] other off the word both of them
[1:22:08] Prophets You Understand say Amen one on
[1:22:11] the word and the other off the word both
[1:22:14] of them prophets proven to be prophets
[1:22:17] but one was with the word see false
[1:22:18] anointed ones in the last days one
[1:22:21] prophets
[1:22:23] both of them prophets one on the word
[1:22:25] one one Vindicated by the word and the
[1:22:27] other was not Vindicated by the word
[1:22:29] Cain and Abel again see the two false
[1:22:31] false and true all right but every one
[1:22:33] of them rotten in the wilderness and
[1:22:36] perished their souls are dead and gone
[1:22:38] and they are right in the path of Duty
[1:22:42] going to church and the Very things that
[1:22:44] God ordained them to do but accepted a
[1:22:47] false teacher who wasn't Vindicated by
[1:22:49] the word to be proven to be right yet he
[1:22:52] was the doctor Divinity and whatever
[1:22:53] more you want to call about a real
[1:22:55] Prophet but wasn't proved spiritually by
[1:22:58] the word and by the signs of God and
[1:23:01] they perished in the wilderness
[1:23:03] righteous honorable religious people
[1:23:06] died and will never be in
[1:23:08] heaven see where we got to
[1:23:11] walk understand don't lay it look same
[1:23:15] as in the times Noah seed word erected a
[1:23:19] floating
[1:23:20] transformation from the Earth to the the
[1:23:22] sky it sound crazy to the people to have
[1:23:25] a little cult like Noah had and he told
[1:23:28] him said thus sayith the Lord God has
[1:23:31] spoken and there's coming a rain science
[1:23:33] and the educated and religious of that
[1:23:35] they say look that old quack he's
[1:23:36] getting old his mind slipping see but he
[1:23:39] was right because he was a Vindicated
[1:23:41] prophet and then at the end time his
[1:23:43] message was truly
[1:23:45] Vindicated what would he do he
[1:23:47] transformed from the Earth to Glory by
[1:23:50] Arc of the word that he was preaching it
[1:23:52] was transformed the scientific spre
[1:23:56] rotted the rest of them in the Judgment
[1:23:57] they had rotted up on the Waters of the
[1:23:59] Judgment of the flood what are people
[1:24:01] trying to do today in this great
[1:24:03] scientific age of Education the Eden
[1:24:05] Church restored again to its Eden
[1:24:09] scientific condition instead of the word
[1:24:11] word are they exalting the word of God
[1:24:14] is people trying to exalt the word of
[1:24:15] God are they trying to exalt
[1:24:17] themselves which is it wonder the church
[1:24:22] is form seed knowledge program has
[1:24:25] caused the whole race again by
[1:24:28] scientific to be scientifically ignorant
[1:24:31] of the word of
[1:24:34] God scientifically
[1:24:37] ignorant of the word of God that's a big
[1:24:40] mouthful isn't it but they are they
[1:24:43] can't be it was when Jesus came the day
[1:24:46] that Jesus came them man know that word
[1:24:49] of God just Bel letter didn't they sure
[1:24:51] but they were ignorant of who he was
[1:24:53] when they seen God on the wings of a
[1:24:56] d perform and do just exactly what he
[1:25:00] said he would do and he done just what
[1:25:02] the word said if I do not the works of
[1:25:03] my father then don't believe me but he
[1:25:06] did just as the word said he would do
[1:25:09] and they were scientific man in them
[1:25:11] days but scientifically ignorant to
[1:25:14] willfully sin lust and blinded they need
[1:25:18] God's word to show her to show her
[1:25:21] nakedness in Revelations 3 said I
[1:25:24] counsel the to buy from me Sav that your
[1:25:26] eyes might be open that you might see
[1:25:28] your nakedness the sav is God's word the
[1:25:31] healing of the eyes that brings you from
[1:25:34] natural things of the world and
[1:25:35] transforms you by the power of God into
[1:25:38] his
[1:25:39] presence then you see you say I once was
[1:25:42] lost now I'm found I was blind but now I
[1:25:46] see It'll be different that's what the
[1:25:49] church's call is today is our counseling
[1:25:52] to come by of me Saad for your eyes that
[1:25:56] you might be Anointed with my Sav and
[1:25:58] then you'll see let the Holy Spirit come
[1:26:00] upon any person that's truly got
[1:26:02] something down there that a healing
[1:26:04] comes from the inside let that healing
[1:26:06] come from the spirit it's in you if it's
[1:26:09] a genuine Spirit anointing the genuine
[1:26:12] seed it can't do nothing but bear a son
[1:26:14] or daughter of God but the genuine
[1:26:16] Spirit can come up a a cuckle bir seed
[1:26:18] the rain can fall Upon A cuckle and
[1:26:20] it'll make it live just as same as it
[1:26:21] falls upon a wheat and make that live
[1:26:23] but by their fruits you know them we're
[1:26:26] a fruit tree of God bearing his word
[1:26:28] Jesus
[1:26:29] said let a man deny himself and follow
[1:26:32] me let him deny his education deny his
[1:26:35] knowledge deny his degrees take up his
[1:26:37] cross and follow

[1:40:04] good to be in his presence
[1:40:07] amen I just was you know the prophet
[1:40:10] doesn't ever say anything uh with no
[1:40:14] reason and I was in my heart when he
[1:40:16] said you know what I think of culture he
[1:40:18] said uh I think it's like some somebody
[1:40:21] that you know won't won't shoot a rabbit
[1:40:24] but they'll they'll eat a belly full of
[1:40:25] it and I was just thinking
[1:40:27] what what is that even mean and I just
[1:40:31] felt the Lord impressed on my heart that
[1:40:34] we get we get culture too where we just
[1:40:36] come to church and want to be blessed
[1:40:38] and we just come and let the preacher
[1:40:41] preach and come let the pastor uh be
[1:40:44] divinely led to play the word of God for
[1:40:47] us and we just fulfill Our obl
[1:40:49] obligation and our duty I think that's
[1:40:51] what the Lord the Lord was telling me if
[1:40:54] we're not careful we just let culture we
[1:40:56] become culture oh just feed me preach me
[1:41:00] preach me happy and then we go out but
[1:41:02] are we
[1:41:04] praying are we
[1:41:06] listening are are we going home I wonder
[1:41:09] how many of us have been listening and
[1:41:10] feeding on the power of
[1:41:13] transformation well there that that's
[1:41:15] that's hunting down that rabbit yourself
[1:41:16] that way we we come
[1:41:18] together and I thought Lord help me Lord
[1:41:20] I don't want to I don't want to become
[1:41:22] cultured by science and education and
[1:41:25] and just think my good works of going to
[1:41:28] church and being a good message believer
[1:41:30] I I want to do my part amen let's just
[1:41:33] go before the Lord in prayer Heavenly
[1:41:36] Father we thank you for your word
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:42] Lord Lord I think of when
[1:41:45] you stood on this Earth
[1:41:49] you spoke spoke one time you said the
[1:41:52] words that I speak unto
[1:41:55] you they are
[1:41:57] spirit and they are
[1:42:00] life Lord we're so privileged to live in
[1:42:03] an hour where you've come
[1:42:06] again we don't have to think about a
[1:42:11] story 2,000 years ago and wonder what it
[1:42:14] was like Lord but here you are again
[1:42:17] standing in the midst of your
[1:42:19] bride the same yesterday today and
[1:42:22] forever speaking
[1:42:23] words of life and words of
[1:42:27] spirit love secrets to your bride that
[1:42:30] we can be impregnated by your word and
[1:42:32] bring forth the
[1:42:34] reality of what has been spoken we're
[1:42:37] such a privileged people
[1:42:39] Lord forgive us Lord where we've taken
[1:42:41] it for
[1:42:42] granted where we've become compl
[1:42:46] in Lord where we'll just gather together
[1:42:49] and sing the songs and hear the preach
[1:42:50] preaching and get a belly
[1:42:52] full but yet we won't go home and hunt
[1:42:55] it out ourselves and seek your
[1:42:59] face Lord I I take heed to the word
