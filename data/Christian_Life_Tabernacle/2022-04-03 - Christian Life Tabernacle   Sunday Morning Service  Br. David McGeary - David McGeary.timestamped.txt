[15:41] spirit may come and
[15:43] fill us that we may think like him act
[15:45] like him and he may do all things like
[15:47] he would do amen we invite brother mike
[15:50] right now to come and open up in a word
[15:52] of prayer and read our psalm this
[15:54] morning
[15:54] certainly welcome everyone in the house
[15:56] of god this morning it's good to be in
[15:58] the presence of the lord amen man
[16:00] there's no place better place to be than
[16:02] to be with him amen amen
[16:13] let's go ahead and pray commit the
[16:15] service to him father how we
[16:18] so appreciate the opportunity to come
[16:20] and to gather together in your presence
[16:22] lord to be
[16:23] given the opportunity father to once
[16:25] again sit at your feet to hear from you
[16:28] to learn of you father
[16:30] as the song says we pray that you
[16:32] created us a clean heart
[16:34] that you'd renew a right spirit within
[16:36] us lord as we come in from the highways
[16:39] and the byways where we're
[16:40] constantly
[16:42] pummeled by all the voices
[16:44] all the influences lord and what a
[16:46] precious place to be able to come to
[16:49] lord to just be found among your
[16:51] believers
[16:52] and to be here with your presence we
[16:54] welcome you in this place
[16:56] we pray that you would have
[16:58] dominion over all things from the
[17:00] beginning to the end of the service we
[17:01] committed utterly to you
[17:03] that your word would have preeminence
[17:05] lord that you would deal with hearts
[17:07] lord that you would
[17:09] direct us in the ways that you'd have us
[17:11] to go
[17:12] and lord that you draw us closer to you
[17:14] we welcome your presence we pray these
[17:17] things in jesus name
[17:18] amen
[17:20] amen there's
[17:24] there's a story in second kings
[17:29] 22
[17:30] 23 of a king king josiah who assumes the
[17:34] throne and
[17:36] you know discovers that he needs to
[17:39] re-familiarize the people
[17:42] with the word as he's
[17:44] as he's rebuilding and restoring the
[17:47] temple and they discover the law
[17:49] in second kings 3 2 we read how he
[17:52] gathered all the people into the house
[17:55] and as they stood he read
[17:57] the entire book of the law to the
[18:01] children of israel
[18:03] with that in mind we're going to turn to
[18:05] psalm 119 this morning
[18:09] no we're not going to read all of
[18:10] someone
[18:12] just wanted to see who was listening
[18:15] but we are going to read out of psalm
[18:16] 119 this morning and
[18:19] you know i thought we might take the
[18:20] next few weeks
[18:22] and just go through the entire chapter
[18:25] such a wonderful chapter it's
[18:27] divided into
[18:29] 22
[18:31] eight verse sections
[18:35] probably take
[18:37] a section a week
[18:39] just spend some time
[18:40] there that almost every single one of
[18:43] the 176 verses
[18:47] have some reference to the word of god
[18:51] i'm going to read the first eight verses
[18:53] this morning in a certain verse stuck
[18:56] out to me in verse 5.
[18:59] it said o that my ways
[19:02] were directed to keep thy statutes
[19:06] it's interesting how this
[19:08] references two different
[19:10] things
[19:12] my ways
[19:14] and his statutes
[19:18] two
[19:19] separate and different things
[19:22] you know it is a psalmist crying out oh
[19:24] that my ways
[19:26] kept
[19:27] your statutes
[19:30] you know and that's
[19:31] that's that doesn't sum up the battle
[19:35] i don't know what does
[19:37] i think that's what we all struggle with
[19:38] every day
[19:40] my ways
[19:42] versus his statutes
[19:45] you know it says in isaiah 55 and verse
[19:48] 8 for my thoughts
[19:51] are not your thoughts
[19:53] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[19:57] lord
[19:58] for as the heavens are higher than the
[20:00] earth
[20:02] so are my ways
[20:03] higher than your ways
[20:05] and my thoughts than your thoughts
[20:08] the two couldn't be further apart
[20:12] you know anyone
[20:14] who has an experience with the lord will
[20:16] surely recognize the struggle every day
[20:19] of getting our ways to match his word
[20:22] you know that's what his statutes are
[20:24] his word
[20:27] you know my ways
[20:29] the way i do things
[20:32] the way i am
[20:34] the way i act
[20:37] the way i behave the way i think
[20:40] the way i see it
[20:42] all
[20:43] my ways
[20:46] you know and we know that our ways
[20:48] conflict with the word
[20:52] oh that my ways were directed to keep
[20:55] thy statutes
[20:57] now notice in verse 1
[21:00] blessed are the undefiled in the way
[21:06] the way
[21:07] who walk in the law
[21:09] of the lord
[21:11] now notice that there's my ways
[21:14] which conflict with his statutes or his
[21:17] word
[21:19] but those who walk in the word
[21:22] are undefiled in the way
[21:25] so there is from my many ways to his one
[21:30] way
[21:34] you know we all recognize the problem we
[21:35] all deal with it the struggle to keep to
[21:38] get my ways to keep his word but where
[21:41] we run into trouble
[21:42] is when we try to use my ways to keep
[21:46] his word
[21:48] you know you can't use my ways to get my
[21:51] ways to match my his way
[21:54] you just can't be done
[21:58] you know the psalmist says something
[22:00] important in verse 5 he says oh that my
[22:03] ways
[22:05] were directed
[22:08] to keep thy statute
[22:10] there has to be a director there
[22:13] there has to be something directing
[22:16] in order for my ways
[22:19] to keep his statutes
[22:22] you know in three verses later in verse
[22:24] eight he says this i will
[22:26] keep thy statutes
[22:29] so we go from verse 5 oh that my ways
[22:35] were directed to keep thy statutes to
[22:37] verse 8 i will
[22:39] keep thy statutes
[22:41] something happened between those two
[22:43] verses
[22:45] somewhere in there
[22:47] he found the directing
[22:49] to get his ways to keep his word
[22:52] it says in psalm 32 8
[22:55] i will instruct thee
[22:57] and teach thee in
[22:59] the way
[23:01] which thou shalt go
[23:03] i will guide thee
[23:05] with mine
[23:06] i in order to be undefiled in the way
[23:12] in order to get my ways
[23:15] to keep his statutes
[23:18] i need direction
[23:20] i need someone
[23:22] an instructor
[23:24] to teach me the way
[23:27] to guide me not in the way i see things
[23:31] but the way he sees things
[23:35] your brother branham preached a sermon
[23:36] on that verse called god's eye
[23:42] says in verse 7 psalm 119 7 i will
[23:44] praise thee with uprightness of heart
[23:47] when i shall have learned
[23:50] thy righteous judgments
[23:52] a learning process direct my ways
[23:56] instruct thee
[23:58] teach
[23:59] thee
[24:00] when i shall have
[24:02] learned between the cry o that my ways
[24:06] were directed to keep thy statutes and i
[24:08] will keep thy statutes
[24:11] there was an encounter with a teacher
[24:14] and that's ultimately
[24:17] the secret to bringing my ways
[24:20] in line with his statutes
[24:22] where my ways become his way in his way
[24:25] becomes my ways
[24:28] you know as we read psalm 119 you know
[24:31] the question would be to make sure that
[24:33] we are in fellowship with the teacher
[24:36] that we know
[24:37] the teacher
[24:38] the director the instructor the one who
[24:42] would guide us with his eye
[24:44] as we
[24:46] read
[24:47] psalm 119 the next few weeks it's
[24:49] important that the entire book the
[24:52] entire chapter rather is all about a
[24:54] relationship with the word
[24:58] and so we'll read the first eight verses
[25:00] this morning and i guess
[25:02] my prayer and hopefully the prayer for
[25:04] all of us is that
[25:06] you know our ways would match his way
[25:09] that we would spend time with the
[25:11] teacher
[25:12] and maybe we don't know all things but
[25:14] like brother branham said we know the
[25:15] author really well amen
[25:18] let's read psalm 119 1-8 this morning
[25:21] starting at verse 1 blessed are the
[25:23] undefiled in the way who walk in the law
[25:26] of the lord blessed are they that keep
[25:29] his testimonies and that seek him with
[25:31] the whole heart they also do no iniquity
[25:34] they walk in his ways
[25:36] thou has commanded us to keep thy
[25:38] precepts diligently oh that my ways were
[25:41] directed to keep thy statutes then shall
[25:44] i not be ashamed when i respect unto all
[25:47] thy commandments i will praise thee with
[25:50] a brightness of heart when i shall have
[25:52] learned thy righteous judgments i will
[25:55] keep thy statutes oh forsake me not
[25:58] utterly amen
[26:02] and god bless you may have your seats

[49:32] and held fast to the word
[49:35] even to the chopping off of the head of
[49:38] king father that
[49:41] because your word said so
[49:43] father may he have that great
[49:45] stand for the word of god
[49:48] i ask that you bless this family father
[49:50] may they grow
[49:52] and prosper
[49:53] and be in good health
[49:55] in jesus precious name we pray amen amen
[49:59] god bless you so much
[50:01] god bless you sis beautiful amen
[50:05] hallelujah
[50:06] okay
[50:07] thank you musicians
[50:10] um before we um
[50:16] start
[50:18] uh
[50:20] preaching this morning
[50:22] i just want to um
[50:29] bring a few things to you and i think
[50:31] the best way
[50:33] for me to do it is
[50:36] maybe to
[50:39] start with
[50:41] an apology
[50:43] and you know
[50:45] um
[50:47] there's a lot of pressure that goes with
[50:51] being a pastor um
[50:54] and it's not an easy job
[50:57] and of course
[50:59] you feel within yourself you're not
[51:04] capable of doing it
[51:06] and you deal with all your
[51:09] personality flaws in your complexes
[51:14] and because of that
[51:16] many times you
[51:18] shrink away
[51:20] from your duties
[51:22] uh what god's called you to do and
[51:26] the obligation
[51:28] and responsibility
[51:31] that you have to the word and
[51:34] i
[51:34] you know i'm i'm sensitive
[51:37] to hurting people's feelings
[51:40] and
[51:42] i'm i i always
[51:45] kind of
[51:47] wait till things back me and to a corner
[51:52] and then i come out fighting and
[51:55] sometimes i come up fighting too hard
[51:57] and i'm
[51:59] trying to be
[52:00] more gentle
[52:02] but you know
[52:05] i let things slip
[52:08] a lot
[52:09] because with every
[52:11] circumstance or with every incident
[52:16] there's always a person involved
[52:19] and i always have a little saying i tell
[52:21] myself
[52:24] i said there won't be any people in
[52:26] heaven
[52:28] and basically because of human nature
[52:32] but i want to address
[52:34] something that
[52:36] brother branham addressed quite a bit
[52:39] in the message
[52:41] god in simplicity
[52:44] and he talked
[52:45] in
[52:46] god in simplicity he's
[52:49] talking about
[52:50] the sanctuary
[52:52] and what goes on in the sanctuary
[52:56] and how
[52:57] we should conduct ourselves
[53:00] in the sanctuary
[53:02] and he said now this may seem a little
[53:05] rude
[53:07] but it's not a place to visit
[53:10] it's a place of worship
[53:12] and you know and um
[53:16] he said we should never
[53:19] even murmur a word inside of here
[53:23] outside of worship
[53:25] to one another unless it's absolutely
[53:28] necessary
[53:29] we should never rally around we should
[53:32] never run through the building
[53:34] or let our children
[53:36] run through the building
[53:38] therefore dedicating ourselves let us
[53:41] remember
[53:42] when we enter that sanctuary keep still
[53:46] to one another and worship god
[53:49] if we want to visit each other there's a
[53:51] place
[53:53] we may visit each other
[53:55] like that but never walk around
[53:58] where you can't hear yourself think
[54:01] and some person
[54:03] and some person come in
[54:05] and they just don't know what to do see
[54:08] it's so much noise in things
[54:11] just
[54:12] humanly
[54:14] you know
[54:16] and and he says i've seen churches until
[54:19] it's made me feel real bad
[54:21] because we we do not come into the
[54:24] sanctuary of the lord to meet each other
[54:28] we come here to worship god
[54:30] and then go to our homes
[54:32] this sanctuary is dedicated to worship
[54:36] stand outside talk anything you wish as
[54:39] long as it's right
[54:41] and holy
[54:42] and go to one another's home visit one
[54:45] another in places
[54:47] but when you enter that door keep quiet
[54:50] you come here to talk to him
[54:52] let him talk back to you
[54:55] the trouble of it is we do too much
[54:57] talking
[54:58] and don't listen enough
[55:00] then when we come in here
[55:03] wait on him
[55:05] and
[55:07] you know
[55:09] i'm even guilty
[55:11] of this maybe more so than you realize
[55:15] but
[55:17] you know there's a way too much visiting
[55:20] going on
[55:22] in the four-year the deacon standing
[55:24] outside
[55:26] and we need to become more conscious
[55:29] of the presence of the lord
[55:32] and the holiness of his sanctuary
[55:36] now we know that this is just brick and
[55:38] mortar
[55:39] and the prophet of god said the
[55:42] real church is the character of the
[55:44] people
[55:46] in the church
[55:47] and our character comes from obeying
[55:50] god's word
[55:52] that's our character that's the
[55:53] character
[55:55] of our church is
[55:57] that we've set forth the word of god
[56:00] in our lives each of us to live
[56:03] the word of god
[56:04] and and therefore you know
[56:07] we begin
[56:08] to let things slip
[56:10] and we do it because
[56:13] we don't have a place to practice music
[56:18] and
[56:19] and
[56:21] practice specials and things
[56:23] but to be a hundred percent honest with
[56:25] you the sanctuary is not the place to do
[56:28] that we probably really should maybe get
[56:33] a piano or something in the back room
[56:36] where we could practice
[56:39] our specials
[56:41] and i know
[56:42] people have a lot of
[56:45] camaraderie
[56:46] and fellowship but this just isn't the
[56:50] place to do it
[56:52] and i've let it go on and let it go on
[56:54] and i don't know how to fix it
[56:57] but there's things that got to be fixed
[57:00] you've noticed that we've are let we
[57:03] have musicians
[57:05] and we never want to think that one spot
[57:09] is a person has that spot
[57:12] and that's their spot
[57:14] that's why we've got with the people
[57:16] that want to play and we've been
[57:18] rotating them
[57:19] and letting the different musicians play
[57:21] different things
[57:23] but work
[57:24] we'll do that with our song leaders at
[57:27] times we'll do it with the psalm reading
[57:30] at time
[57:31] you know the prophet of god said when we
[57:33] come together we we read a song you know
[57:36] the way it used to be done
[57:39] is that we he would read a verse and
[57:42] they would read a verse
[57:44] but since we're so many different
[57:47] cultures and languages
[57:49] we've went ahead and allowed that
[57:52] to be done together
[57:54] but one of the main things that i've
[57:57] really got to
[57:59] approach and that i've left slipped
[58:03] is the kind of music
[58:05] that we're
[58:06] allowing in the church
[58:10] and
[58:13] i know gifts and callings
[58:15] are without repentance
[58:18] and we like music
[58:20] and we like inspiration
[58:22] but there's a lot of artists out there
[58:25] today
[58:27] that have a gift
[58:30] and they write very inspirational
[58:34] music but
[58:36] music
[58:38] isn't
[58:39] can be an instrument of the devil
[58:43] and
[58:45] you know sometimes we'll
[58:47] have an artist and then we'll go look at
[58:50] that artist
[58:52] and and we'll pick his music
[58:55] and and i think it's important
[58:58] that when we teach our
[59:01] our
[59:02] children choirs or our youth choirs
[59:05] if we're gonna practice a song and it's
[59:08] an inspirational song and it's a good
[59:10] song
[59:11] and there's hardly not a song that you
[59:13] can pick that you don't have to take all
[59:16] the boogie woogie
[59:18] out of it
[59:19] and all the country twang because they
[59:22] don't do that music they you might think
[59:25] that they do it to worship if they only
[59:27] did it to worship they wouldn't collect
[59:29] a nickel
[59:32] and they wouldn't take a reward
[59:35] it's christian entertainment
[59:37] and what's happened is is that the
[59:40] christianity
[59:42] the music of christianity this all this
[59:45] contemporary music is nothing but rock
[59:48] and roll
[59:49] with uh with christian lyrics
[59:53] and
[59:58] just entertainment
[1:00:00] and then those songs end up
[1:00:04] in our church
[1:00:07] and without us ever vetting
[1:00:10] the songs looking at the origin looking
[1:00:13] at what the message is
[1:00:15] okay
[1:00:16] and i mean i i looked a video out here
[1:00:19] that was brought to my attention and
[1:00:22] and as i was this was on my heart
[1:00:25] and
[1:00:26] you know i i i don't know the song i
[1:00:29] don't care maybe we've sung it here
[1:00:30] maybe views sung it but when i looked at
[1:00:33] it you know here's all the people going
[1:00:37] he's not going to tread
[1:00:41] and just guitars ripping and everything
[1:00:44] in lyrics like
[1:00:46] the blood ran down the tree into his
[1:00:48] throat and choked me
[1:00:51] i mean rap songs
[1:00:54] rap lyrics
[1:00:56] worldly
[1:01:00] you know we might pick the group
[1:01:02] you know and and and you got to look at
[1:01:04] it they might like a good song
[1:01:07] you know but
[1:01:09] i'll just be honest with you i mean i'm
[1:01:12] shaken
[1:01:15] and and i noticed they're not popular
[1:01:19] you know what i mean but we've got to
[1:01:20] start vetting
[1:01:23] you know what vetting is right
[1:01:25] you get all the dirt out of it
[1:01:28] and i don't think we ought to if we're
[1:01:30] going to teach our children a song
[1:01:32] and and there's inspiration there
[1:01:36] and and there's there because
[1:01:38] those people are annoying it and there's
[1:01:40] an anointing
[1:01:42] but we don't need them to teach our song
[1:01:45] if you find a song
[1:01:47] you get with the musicians you practice
[1:01:50] it you play it you introduce it but
[1:01:53] let's quit playing these artists
[1:01:57] you know i mean
[1:02:00] you know getting our kids here and
[1:02:02] playing a video
[1:02:04] so they can learn a song quick sending
[1:02:07] them to the internet
[1:02:09] to listen and watch these guys perform
[1:02:11] because that's the standard of
[1:02:13] christianity
[1:02:15] that you're setting
[1:02:17] and let me tell you christianity today
[1:02:21] doesn't have any resemblance to what
[1:02:23] real christianity is
[1:02:27] and
[1:02:28] and the music today
[1:02:31] you know and i know that you you can't
[1:02:34] always do away with the song
[1:02:37] because of the artist i understand that
[1:02:39] albus presley sang amazing grace
[1:02:43] so i don't throw amazing grace out
[1:02:45] because
[1:02:46] albus presley wrote it
[1:02:49] i like the song egypt i believe
[1:02:51] laura and
[1:02:53] and
[1:02:58] clever
[1:03:00] sing it
[1:03:02] but i i i don't
[1:03:04] throw that out because the group kane
[1:03:08] saying it
[1:03:09] and i'm sure nobody in here would ever
[1:03:11] listen to a group that had the name kane
[1:03:15] mean i did business
[1:03:18] uh
[1:03:20] with a guy one time
[1:03:22] and i i just should have known
[1:03:24] by his last name
[1:03:26] not to do business with him i think his
[1:03:28] last name was deceiver
[1:03:31] and
[1:03:32] you know
[1:03:33] and
[1:03:34] you know and uh
[1:03:36] so
[1:03:37] and yeah he got to me
[1:03:39] but
[1:03:40] i'm just saying
[1:03:42] and i don't have time to listen to every
[1:03:44] song
[1:03:45] but parents listen watch what your kid's
[1:03:47] listening to
[1:03:49] watch how we teach our kids and what
[1:03:52] songs we're picking and what and there's
[1:03:54] nothing wrong with an old-fashioned
[1:03:56] gospel song music is a way that satan
[1:04:00] uses to communicate
[1:04:03] his views on god
[1:04:06] and what he feels our views on god
[1:04:09] should be
[1:04:11] you can sing a song that god's merciful
[1:04:14] god loves everybody you know
[1:04:17] and and and everybody's going to be
[1:04:19] saved because of the love of god and it
[1:04:22] might be the most beautiful anointed
[1:04:24] song but the words in it that's not true
[1:04:28] it's not true so we're
[1:04:30] we're going to try to do better
[1:04:34] with the music and our song specials
[1:04:37] and and i would
[1:04:40] really like the opportunity when we have
[1:04:42] a choir song
[1:04:44] and i'm not very musically inclined and
[1:04:47] that's why i shy away from it
[1:04:49] so much
[1:04:51] but i i think that we need to be in a
[1:04:54] greater position
[1:04:56] to vet
[1:04:57] and this is what the prophet of god said
[1:05:00] he said
[1:05:01] well this morning i don't
[1:05:03] say
[1:05:04] this sacrilegious
[1:05:06] i heard one of them great famous
[1:05:08] organizations
[1:05:10] and my daughter and i was listening to
[1:05:12] the radio as we went
[1:05:14] to dedicate a church
[1:05:17] and a song they sang some kind of
[1:05:20] something another by so and so
[1:05:23] some of that classic singing that sounds
[1:05:26] to me like a woman holding their breath
[1:05:29] till they're blue in the face
[1:05:32] and then think that singing
[1:05:35] that's squeaking
[1:05:37] i like good old pentecostal singing
[1:05:41] right from your heart
[1:05:44] you couldn't carry a tune in a coal
[1:05:46] bucket
[1:05:47] but yet your singing
[1:05:49] making a joyful nose to the lord
[1:05:52] i think that's spiritual
[1:05:55] i like it
[1:05:57] but that holding your breath till you're
[1:06:00] just blew in the face and
[1:06:02] die away and then come back
[1:06:05] you don't even know yourself
[1:06:08] what you're singing
[1:06:13] that you know
[1:06:15] goes for all of
[1:06:16] us how you expect somebody else to know
[1:06:21] that's it jesus said we speak them
[1:06:24] things we know
[1:06:26] that's right that's right we ought to do
[1:06:31] what we ought to do
[1:06:33] is sing what we know in our heart
[1:06:37] what we feel
[1:06:40] not some tune
[1:06:42] because it's anointed
[1:06:45] you know what i mean not because it's
[1:06:47] entertaining not to it like but really
[1:06:49] what we should sing and what but the
[1:06:51] reason i'm saying this is because
[1:06:54] we can't accomplish what god is wanting
[1:06:57] us to accomplish in this hour
[1:07:00] but continually lowering our standard in
[1:07:03] our bar
[1:07:06] because the filter is getting tighter
[1:07:09] and what goes through the mesh is
[1:07:11] getting smaller
[1:07:15] and and it
[1:07:17] and
[1:07:19] i should have clipped a lot of this in a
[1:07:21] bud a long time ago
[1:07:24] and it would have never had to get
[1:07:26] to this point
[1:07:28] that's my fault
[1:07:32] and
[1:07:32] i apologize to that
[1:07:35] i've let conduct go on our preliminary
[1:07:39] services are too long
[1:07:43] we need to shorten things up we need to
[1:07:45] bring it back under the guidelines that
[1:07:47] the prophet of god told us to
[1:07:50] to bring
[1:07:52] and
[1:07:53] my obligation is to the word
[1:07:56] and too many times i let my obligation
[1:08:00] be to the people because i love them and
[1:08:03] i don't want to offend them and i don't
[1:08:05] want to hear them and i don't want to
[1:08:06] tell them they're wrong
[1:08:13] the authority of the leadership of the
[1:08:16] church
[1:08:18] has been delegated to me and
[1:08:22] honestly
[1:08:24] i never wanted it
[1:08:27] never wanted to be a preacher
[1:08:30] i never wanted to be a pastor
[1:08:33] but i didn't have control over it
[1:08:38] and
[1:08:39] and i don't
[1:08:40] like what i am
[1:08:43] i look in the mirror and i want to be
[1:08:45] different
[1:08:46] every day
[1:08:48] but there's one thing that's true
[1:08:51] and that's god's word
[1:08:54] and there's one thing he did do is send
[1:08:56] us a messenger
[1:08:58] so i'm not
[1:09:00] looking at any person i just wanted to
[1:09:02] let you this morning
[1:09:04] know that i have let
[1:09:09] the bars down
[1:09:13] in
[1:09:14] many
[1:09:15] areas
[1:09:17] and
[1:09:19] i'm going to try to reestablish
[1:09:23] some of the boundaries
[1:09:26] that
[1:09:26] i've let go
[1:09:29] and it doesn't
[1:09:32] have to do with anybody
[1:09:34] feeling anybody's personalities
[1:09:37] or any things like what was said this
[1:09:40] morning
[1:09:41] this
[1:09:42] is our leadership
[1:09:45] and you know this only because it was
[1:09:49] interpreted to you
[1:09:53] by a prophet
[1:09:56] there is something in this book that was
[1:09:58] allotted to this
[1:10:00] age that people have been studying this
[1:10:04] book for years and they could never see
[1:10:06] it
[1:10:07] but in this hour
[1:10:09] it's been pulled out of there
[1:10:11] because it was sealed up in there
[1:10:14] just for us
[1:10:16] and i think that's what we've got to
[1:10:19] make sure
[1:10:21] that we line up with
[1:10:23] and i don't mean to the point of
[1:10:25] legalism
[1:10:27] but i mean to a point of a guideline
[1:10:30] where we pray about it and we we we go
[1:10:33] about it in prayer
[1:10:36] and
[1:10:38] and so i could continue on
[1:10:41] here and i'll finish this with the music
[1:10:43] and with things
[1:10:44] and and when they got through my
[1:10:46] daughter studies music and she said
[1:10:49] brother
[1:10:50] she said that was really a classic
[1:10:53] and i said yes but how many of them
[1:10:55] choir
[1:10:56] at that choir of about 50 people do you
[1:11:00] think had a cigarette on their breath
[1:11:04] how many of that choir do you think last
[1:11:07] night being saturday night
[1:11:09] they didn't have a little social drink
[1:11:12] how many women in there had bobbed hair
[1:11:16] how many had pain on
[1:11:18] when the pastor of the church said a few
[1:11:20] days ago
[1:11:21] god made
[1:11:22] a prettier world when he invented paint
[1:11:26] when you know that those
[1:11:28] these one woman in the bible painted her
[1:11:32] face and god fed her to the dogs
[1:11:35] and we anybody that knows anything about
[1:11:38] the church and about heathens knows that
[1:11:42] paint
[1:11:42] is a heathen trait always has been
[1:11:45] and yet women do it and men smoke drink
[1:11:49] and carry on and stand there and sing
[1:11:52] voices like that
[1:11:54] we'll get to that in a few minutes right
[1:11:56] here all right belong to an organization
[1:12:00] thinking when there's going to be a
[1:12:02] disappointment at the judgment
[1:12:05] when
[1:12:06] my opinion
[1:12:07] so
[1:12:08] don't you take it this morning as
[1:12:12] me
[1:12:12] scolding you
[1:12:14] take this as
[1:12:17] an apology
[1:12:20] from me to you
[1:12:24] from
[1:12:26] being
[1:12:27] not having the courage
[1:12:30] to stand up
[1:12:32] and
[1:12:33] face
[1:12:34] these issues
[1:12:36] because
[1:12:38] of
[1:12:39] my complexes
[1:12:41] because of the timidness of my spirit
[1:12:45] with confrontation
[1:12:47] so
[1:12:47] you know what the prophet said
[1:12:50] go read the first part of god in
[1:12:52] simplicity
[1:12:54] and
[1:12:55] take it from
[1:12:57] the messenger
[1:12:59] himself
[1:13:00] and let us all try
[1:13:03] to
[1:13:05] move to that perfection
[1:13:08] in our music so we need to pray for our
[1:13:10] songs pray for our children's choir pray
[1:13:13] how we teach them pray for our adult
[1:13:15] choirs how we pick our songs
[1:13:19] how that we don't emulate the artist
[1:13:22] when you find a song that's good
[1:13:25] and
[1:13:26] let's try to
[1:13:28] move forward in that
[1:13:30] we all agree i hope this morning
[1:13:34] amen i'm glad the pastor can't be voted
[1:13:37] out
[1:13:39] you know that don't you
[1:13:42] i just want to make sure you know
[1:13:44] that you know
[1:13:50] god doesn't run things by democracy
[1:13:54] and we know that don't we
[1:13:56] all right so let's get to some better
[1:13:59] things
[1:14:00] let's get to our predestination
[1:14:03] okay it's what time so it's 11 what
[1:14:06] let's make let's just try to go a
[1:14:08] million miles a minute and let's be out
[1:14:10] of here by
[1:14:12] 12 and we'll just have communion service
[1:14:14] so let's stand and read
[1:14:16] this morning
[1:14:19] and as we we're on our great journey
[1:14:23] through this beautiful message
[1:14:26] um
[1:14:28] and we're going to turn to ephesians
[1:14:30] again i know this probably one of the
[1:14:32] scriptures uh
[1:14:37] and
[1:14:45] and let's start with ephesians 2 and 4.
[1:14:52] the ephesians 2 and 4 the epistle of
[1:14:55] paul and he said
[1:14:58] but god who is rich in mercy
[1:15:01] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:15:07] even when we were dead in sins
[1:15:11] hath quickened us together
[1:15:15] with
[1:15:16] us together with christ
[1:15:19] even while we were dead in sins hath he
[1:15:22] quickened us together
[1:15:26] with christ
[1:15:28] by grace ye are saved
[1:15:31] and hath raised us up together
[1:15:34] and made us sit together
[1:15:36] in heavenly places
[1:15:38] in christ jesus
[1:15:41] that in the ages to come he might show
[1:15:45] the exceeding riches of his grace
[1:15:49] in his kindness towards us
[1:15:52] through christ jesus
[1:15:55] that he might showed us in the ages to
[1:15:57] come this is a prophet speaking
[1:16:01] for grace for by grace are ye saved
[1:16:04] through faith
[1:16:06] and that not of ourselves
[1:16:09] it is the gift of god
[1:16:12] not of works lest any man should boast
[1:16:16] for we are his workmanship
[1:16:19] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:16:22] which god hath before ordained that we
[1:16:27] should walk in them
[1:16:29] amen so god has something for ordained
[1:16:33] for all of us that are sitting here let
[1:16:35] us pray our gracious heavenly father we
[1:16:37] ask you to bless your word
[1:16:39] to us in your precious name we pray
[1:16:42] amen amen god bless you
[1:16:50] we've been
[1:16:52] looking at this wonderful easter message
[1:16:55] the rising of the sun
[1:16:57] and
[1:16:58] we've
[1:17:00] looked at it because
[1:17:02] uh
[1:17:04] it is the
[1:17:07] last
[1:17:09] easter
[1:17:11] year that brother brahms ministry
[1:17:15] was here on earth
[1:17:17] and as we begin to look at it we're
[1:17:19] going to just do a little quick
[1:17:22] review to as we begin to move forward
[1:17:26] in this message
[1:17:28] so we understand that the
[1:17:30] prophet of god
[1:17:32] explained to us
[1:17:33] that
[1:17:34] there was a seed
[1:17:37] that
[1:17:38] is in all of us
[1:17:39] and that seed is
[1:17:42] the word of god
[1:17:44] and that god had us in his thinking
[1:17:49] from the beginning
[1:17:52] and he went through the scriptures in
[1:17:55] type
[1:17:56] and began to show in type
[1:17:59] that god
[1:18:02] placed it in type
[1:18:04] that by the types we can realize what
[1:18:08] god's doing
[1:18:10] and i think this morning i think that's
[1:18:13] what would help us all
[1:18:15] in our lives if if we could understand
[1:18:18] what's god doing with my life
[1:18:20] what is it that he's wanting to extract
[1:18:24] from me
[1:18:25] because that's what he said the sun
[1:18:28] pulls the seed out
[1:18:30] so there's something in you
[1:18:33] that god's trying to extract
[1:18:36] he's trying to pull out
[1:18:39] and that's why satan comes early in our
[1:18:41] lives and he scars our lives he scars
[1:18:45] our thinking he scars our feelings he
[1:18:48] scars our emotions we know the story of
[1:18:52] a
[1:18:52] a a little girl who had was suffering
[1:18:56] all kinds of depressions and fears and
[1:19:00] anxieties and
[1:19:02] and she she had a great
[1:19:06] battle
[1:19:07] in her mind and the prophet of god
[1:19:11] uh as he began to look through her life
[1:19:14] he said this was all brought on to you
[1:19:16] because a dog
[1:19:18] chased you
[1:19:19] and scared you when you were just a
[1:19:22] young child
[1:19:24] and so here's that effect on that person
[1:19:28] okay all their lives and there's a lot
[1:19:30] of things that has affected our lives a
[1:19:33] lot of circumstances a lot of failures a
[1:19:36] lot of history
[1:19:38] and and satan's the day that you were
[1:19:41] placed here on earth he started a
[1:19:43] long-range plan
[1:19:45] to to
[1:19:47] put so much
[1:19:49] concrete over you
[1:19:50] if they use that expression to put put
[1:19:53] such a heap of a mountain of things on
[1:19:56] our hearts and on our minds and our
[1:19:59] burdens and our past and everything and
[1:20:02] he does it because he doesn't want us to
[1:20:05] go forward he does not want this church
[1:20:09] to reach the perfection that is
[1:20:11] prophesied
[1:20:13] satan's whole journey is to discredit
[1:20:16] the word of god and
[1:20:18] he's not talking about discrediting this
[1:20:21] word of god because this bible kills the
[1:20:24] word of god is not in letter form the
[1:20:27] word of god is sitting here this morning
[1:20:31] in human form
[1:20:34] and what he's trying to do he's placed
[1:20:37] it in you in seed form he had you or his
[1:20:41] workmanship if you couldn't boast he
[1:20:43] knew what he wanted you to be he knew
[1:20:46] what he wanted to mold you into
[1:20:49] he knew what his plan was and he had a
[1:20:52] plan and he chose to unfold it the way
[1:20:56] that he unfolded it now we've come to a
[1:20:59] very unique time in the history of the
[1:21:02] church and that's where god moves from
[1:21:05] dealing with the groups like he did in
[1:21:07] the church ages and he begins to deal
[1:21:10] with individuals and he's trying to
[1:21:13] extract
[1:21:15] out of that individual
[1:21:18] hear me
[1:21:20] the image
[1:21:22] that he had of that person
[1:21:25] in the beginning
[1:21:29] sometimes he's got to take that vessel
[1:21:32] and completely break it down
[1:21:35] and remold it again
[1:21:37] but you'll find out like paul found out
[1:21:41] he's going out doing all these things he
[1:21:44] thinks he's
[1:21:45] he's got authority to do
[1:21:48] because the high priest get gave him
[1:21:53] the authority and he's carrying out his
[1:21:56] plan just like the disciples in the
[1:21:59] upper room today they looked out and
[1:22:01] they thought oh well we need to replace
[1:22:04] the judas
[1:22:05] and so they drew straws
[1:22:08] but
[1:22:09] it wasn't their
[1:22:11] authority
[1:22:14] to replace that
[1:22:17] it wasn't the what god chose to do
[1:22:20] and how god chose to do it
[1:22:23] so god goes gets a man and this man's
[1:22:26] riding down the road and just feels he's
[1:22:28] carrying out the will of god and
[1:22:30] everything and all sudden he gets
[1:22:32] smacked and he says it's hard paul
[1:22:36] to kick against the print
[1:22:38] and it's it's hard for us
[1:22:42] when we battle against
[1:22:46] what god is trying to extract out of us
[1:22:54] don't worry about this
[1:22:57] body
[1:22:58] because you're going to get a new one
[1:23:02] it's the character
[1:23:04] that we take with us
[1:23:06] it's the spirit
[1:23:08] on the inside
[1:23:10] that we take care of it
[1:23:12] so god's been bringing this church up
[1:23:14] through the ages
[1:23:16] and now there comes a time that he wants
[1:23:19] that church to come into the maturity
[1:23:24] that he had in his mind
[1:23:26] you say well what is that what did god
[1:23:30] have
[1:23:31] well
[1:23:32] christ
[1:23:34] was the mystery of god
[1:23:36] revealed
[1:23:38] what what he had in his mind
[1:23:42] for us
[1:23:44] he showed us in christ
[1:23:46] jesus that's why as christians we say to
[1:23:50] be like jesus that's our goal to be like
[1:23:54] him
[1:23:55] amen
[1:23:56] you know to know when to braid the cord
[1:24:01] and clean the temple
[1:24:04] to know when to turn the other cheek
[1:24:08] to know when to pick up the ear
[1:24:12] and
[1:24:13] put it on
[1:24:17] there's so many aspects
[1:24:19] he i mean he wasn't always what you
[1:24:22] would call sweet oh you vipers you know
[1:24:24] you hypocrites you know
[1:24:28] you buried the prophets but
[1:24:30] before you he knew
[1:24:32] he knew when to be what he had to be
[1:24:37] and
[1:24:38] we know that religion is a covering
[1:24:41] so it allows men to be religious god
[1:24:44] don't care about religion he cares about
[1:24:47] you
[1:24:48] he cares about what he wants you to be
[1:24:53] does he allow us to do things yes most
[1:24:56] of the time i would speak to myself i
[1:24:59] find myself in the permissive will of
[1:25:01] god but he promised that he would take
[1:25:04] the permissive will of god and turn it
[1:25:07] into the perfect will because there's
[1:25:09] one thing that god can't do is he can't
[1:25:11] lie
[1:25:12] and if he thought something about you
[1:25:15] and he doesn't bring it to pass in you
[1:25:18] that would make him a liar
[1:25:23] now sometimes he's got to take somebody
[1:25:25] home
[1:25:30] in order to accomplish what he's going
[1:25:32] to accomplish you know the story about
[1:25:34] the minister that finally got so
[1:25:36] discouraged he went and got some beer
[1:25:38] and he's gonna sit down behind his
[1:25:41] platform and just drink and he's willing
[1:25:44] to cash it all in
[1:25:46] well god had to take him home because
[1:25:48] god was not gonna allow that to keep him
[1:25:52] from meeting
[1:25:54] what god's expectations are
[1:25:58] so don't look at your complexes
[1:26:04] look in the mirror
[1:26:06] of god's word
[1:26:09] and know that god
[1:26:12] had an image of you
[1:26:19] before you ever started this life's
[1:26:21] journey
[1:26:23] we've created our own image of ourselves
[1:26:28] but that didn't stop him did it it
[1:26:30] didn't stop him from finding you from
[1:26:33] saving you
[1:26:34] from doing things for you that you
[1:26:37] didn't deserve preserving you and
[1:26:40] keeping you and just think you sit here
[1:26:42] this morning and you have the ability to
[1:26:46] hear god's word he's kept you thus far
[1:26:52] and if he started to work in you he'll
[1:26:55] complete it
[1:26:56] the prophet of god said we would just
[1:26:59] save ourselves and god a lot of trouble
[1:27:03] if we would just humbly submit
[1:27:07] to
[1:27:08] his will
[1:27:10] and so we understand the churches we
[1:27:13] understand these things so we're just
[1:27:14] reviewing real quick
[1:27:16] so
[1:27:18] there was a time
[1:27:21] you understand the church wasn't what it
[1:27:23] is today
[1:27:25] it it when it moved in justification
[1:27:29] we know they came out of the catholic
[1:27:31] church the catholic church was not the
[1:27:33] representative of christianity
[1:27:36] but anytime the world wants to put a
[1:27:39] religious figure in some sort of
[1:27:41] entertainment or some sort of
[1:27:43] explanation of everything it's always a
[1:27:46] priest it's always the catholic church
[1:27:48] they've become the symbol for religion
[1:27:51] because that's satan's symbol of
[1:27:53] religion that satan's system to have a
[1:27:57] nickel ladianism spirit to have to have
[1:28:00] the people ruled over by ideas or
[1:28:04] interpretations instead of the pure
[1:28:07] revelation of god's word
[1:28:09] how that you're led is you're led by
[1:28:12] revelation divine revelation if you're
[1:28:16] if you have a revelation it's never
[1:28:19] going to be contrary to god's word god
[1:28:22] doesn't give revelation contrary to his
[1:28:24] word but now if you if you accept an
[1:28:27] explanation
[1:28:31] or an interpretation
[1:28:33] you might come up with anything
[1:28:37] and it might seem good for a season
[1:28:40] but the farther down the road it gets it
[1:28:43] starts to stray it starts to move until
[1:28:47] finally it's off target
[1:28:49] and
[1:28:51] it in our lives we're not off target as
[1:28:54] far as the building goes we're not off
[1:28:56] target as far as this goes because we've
[1:28:58] got the mechanics
[1:29:01] but that wasn't what god was trying to
[1:29:04] target
[1:29:06] he's trying to target something in you
[1:29:12] an image
[1:29:15] of you
[1:29:16] that he had in his mind
[1:29:20] that had to be
[1:29:22] comparable to the image of the lord
[1:29:26] jesus
[1:29:27] because he was the mystery of what god
[1:29:30] had in his mind revealed
[1:29:34] he didn't come in a system he didn't
[1:29:36] come in an organization he didn't come
[1:29:38] answering to man he answered to the word
[1:29:44] and that word that is
[1:29:46] they're so subject to that word
[1:29:49] that when it was brought up before the
[1:29:52] high priest then
[1:29:54] and he
[1:29:55] and i i forget about paul or stephen one
[1:29:58] of them was brought up before the high
[1:30:00] priest and the high priest uh said
[1:30:02] something and and uh the guy came up and
[1:30:06] smacked he says does that revile us the
[1:30:09] high priest you know what he said
[1:30:11] forgive me
[1:30:15] that's how timid those guys were
[1:30:18] that's how that i didn't know he was the
[1:30:20] high priest
[1:30:22] even though he's wrong
[1:30:24] even though he's
[1:30:26] he's
[1:30:27] mistaken
[1:30:29] i would never do anything to undermine
[1:30:31] him i wouldn't do anything to bring
[1:30:33] disrespect because his message was about
[1:30:36] something that was farther down the road
[1:30:38] something that was to come an exodus
[1:30:41] that's going on and we're in a great
[1:30:43] hour right now of a great exodus
[1:30:47] the exodus isn't over it's just
[1:30:49] beginning
[1:30:52] it was prophesied to us
[1:30:56] so each of you this morning
[1:30:58] god has an image
[1:31:00] of you
[1:31:03] and he put it in you in seed form
[1:31:07] what he had in his thinking in the
[1:31:10] beginning of you what he saw
[1:31:14] he put it in you
[1:31:17] and now
[1:31:19] because he planted it
[1:31:22] he's got to extract it
[1:31:26] amen
[1:31:28] just like a seed goes into the ground
[1:31:30] right
[1:31:31] the seeds lying there it gets watered
[1:31:33] but then the sun comes
[1:31:36] and extracts it
[1:31:38] he's been extracting this church
[1:31:40] through seven ages
[1:31:43] through justification through
[1:31:45] sanctification
[1:31:47] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:31:50] through seven ages the church has been
[1:31:52] coming up
[1:31:54] but finally after seven ages one came on
[1:31:57] the scene
[1:32:02] that matched the image
[1:32:06] of his son
[1:32:12] now though i know the church world don't
[1:32:14] like that
[1:32:17] but that image of his son
[1:32:19] was to be manifested in our age
[1:32:23] in the fulfillment of prophecy
[1:32:28] because nothing can be outside of god's
[1:32:31] word
[1:32:32] so there had to be
[1:32:35] the image
[1:32:36] which was christ jesus
[1:32:38] went into the ground
[1:32:42] it started out at the day of pentecost
[1:32:44] didn't it silver and gold have i none
[1:32:47] rise up and walk people were healed just
[1:32:50] by standing in their shadows
[1:32:54] think of it
[1:32:57] that was the image
[1:33:00] that was the church
[1:33:02] why was the church like that
[1:33:05] because they had to see you didn't
[1:33:07] choose me
[1:33:08] i chose you
[1:33:10] and all that the father hath given me
[1:33:13] will come
[1:33:14] but that church was what it was
[1:33:18] because on the day of pentecost
[1:33:21] he sent back the same spirit
[1:33:25] that was in jesus name
[1:33:29] i will not leave you comfortless
[1:33:32] but i will come again now don't look at
[1:33:35] yourself all your failures all your
[1:33:37] mistakes all your feelings and
[1:33:39] everything that don't mean nothing to
[1:33:41] god in fact he already paid that off
[1:33:45] there's nothing can be laid to the
[1:33:47] charge of god's elect because the seed
[1:33:50] of god remaineth in them
[1:33:55] i don't care what you've squandered
[1:34:00] every one of us has the right of the
[1:34:03] prodigal son
[1:34:07] you know that story right
[1:34:10] he wasted everything
[1:34:14] all his money all his inheritance on
[1:34:16] right unrighteous ravelous living
[1:34:19] gambling women everything until finally
[1:34:22] he was in a pig pen
[1:34:24] but you know who was in that pig pen
[1:34:27] a son of god
[1:34:30] bone of his bone
[1:34:32] flesh of his flesh
[1:34:34] and when he showed up at his father's
[1:34:36] doorstep a wreck
[1:34:40] i'm not worthy to be called your son
[1:34:45] let me be a servant i i'm good at pig
[1:34:47] feeding
[1:34:49] let me go down and fig feed pigs i'd
[1:34:51] rather feed pigs in the house of god
[1:34:54] than be
[1:34:56] out in the world
[1:34:58] amen
[1:34:59] how did the father respond
[1:35:02] the only
[1:35:04] way he could
[1:35:07] because he already had an image
[1:35:10] in his mind that that was his son
[1:35:14] so what did the father do the father
[1:35:17] returned that son and restored that son
[1:35:20] to what that he was
[1:35:25] kill the fatted calf
[1:35:27] go get the king's robes
[1:35:32] and
[1:35:33] the legalistic
[1:35:35] brother
[1:35:39] come up and say how can you do that
[1:35:42] look at what he done
[1:35:45] and look at the father
[1:35:47] the father says
[1:35:49] all i have is yours
[1:35:53] you've already got it
[1:35:56] why are you jealous
[1:35:58] rejoice
[1:35:59] because this is your brother that was
[1:36:02] lost and has now returned praise god
[1:36:10] okay so he knew what that sun was
[1:36:13] so no matter how far that sun went
[1:36:17] he extracted from that sun the
[1:36:20] inheritance that he already possessed
[1:36:23] and restored him back hallelujah
[1:36:27] i will restore saith the lord all the
[1:36:31] palmer worm and cankerworm and lucas and
[1:36:34] caterpillar has eaten i will restore my
[1:36:36] sons and my daughters back to their
[1:36:38] rightful position
[1:36:44] but he had a way of doing it
[1:36:48] and he said that way was is that when
[1:36:51] that crop finally came to maturity
[1:36:55] right it went into the ground a seed
[1:36:59] but then it started a journey
[1:37:02] and when it came back to seed again
[1:37:08] in the old testament type
[1:37:11] they went out and they cut that stock
[1:37:13] down
[1:37:15] that was now mature wheat
[1:37:18] and they waved it over the people the
[1:37:21] field
[1:37:24] saying
[1:37:25] all the rest of this field
[1:37:28] is going to come into this maturity
[1:37:34] what was jesus
[1:37:37] he was the first person that fulfilled
[1:37:39] the law
[1:37:42] hallelujah
[1:37:45] that's what he said
[1:37:47] i fulfilled every jot every tittle
[1:37:52] search the scriptures because in them
[1:37:54] you think you have eternal life but they
[1:37:56] are which testify of me
[1:38:01] he was a fulfillment of the law
[1:38:04] i'm the fulfillment of all the laws and
[1:38:06] all the prophets i'm the first fruit of
[1:38:09] the of the law
[1:38:12] we're exiting out of the law into grace
[1:38:17] and then he took the spirit
[1:38:21] that was matured in him
[1:38:24] and went to the church in seed form
[1:38:29] because the church of the day of
[1:38:30] pentecost was only sitting there
[1:38:33] in seed form
[1:38:36] so he said you go up there and you wait
[1:38:39] because i'm going to come again
[1:38:43] and i'm going to be with you
[1:38:45] even in you till the end
[1:38:48] and he waived
[1:38:50] the first fruits
[1:38:53] of the law
[1:38:54] and the resurrection
[1:38:56] because the law was the law of what
[1:39:00] sin and
[1:39:01] death
[1:39:05] so now he was the first one that came
[1:39:07] out of
[1:39:08] sin and death
[1:39:10] because there was no sin that could be
[1:39:13] found in him
[1:39:15] oh
[1:39:16] hallelujah
[1:39:19] right
[1:39:20] and then he said i have overcome the
[1:39:22] grave
[1:39:23] death hell in the grave
[1:39:27] so there he was the first fruit
[1:39:31] the curse of that the garden was gone
[1:39:37] oh i should just jump in i just got to
[1:39:39] say it
[1:39:40] because the prophet of god said when he
[1:39:42] rose you rose with them
[1:39:48] waved out
[1:39:49] over the people
[1:39:52] what was he doing he let the jews go
[1:39:57] he waved it out over the people
[1:40:02] at the day of pentecost
[1:40:04] the first fruits
[1:40:07] and what did that do
[1:40:09] that
[1:40:10] sparked them
[1:40:13] and anointed them
[1:40:15] to become
[1:40:17] what
[1:40:18] god's image of them was
[1:40:23] he commissioned them
[1:40:26] so now we've come to this age
[1:40:30] through seven ages the church is to
[1:40:32] mature
[1:40:34] and finally we've come to the hour where
[1:40:37] we've got to enter into maturity
[1:40:41] so there had to be a sheep offering
[1:40:44] that was waved over the people again
[1:40:48] and so i want to say this in our
[1:40:50] understanding
[1:40:54] william branham's ministry
[1:40:57] was not a ministry
[1:41:00] that was based on him reading the bible
[1:41:06] his ministry was based on the sole fact
[1:41:10] that he had to fulfill prophecy
[1:41:16] and not the prophecy of malachi 4 5.
[1:41:22] that's just the description
[1:41:24] of his office
[1:41:27] not the prophecy
[1:41:32] of
[1:41:34] revelations i believe it's 3 and 14.
[1:41:38] again that was the description of the
[1:41:41] office
[1:41:42] it wasn't the
[1:41:45] fulfillment
[1:41:47] as we would think
[1:41:49] of the scripture
[1:41:51] in revelations 10 7.
[1:41:55] that was all the prophecies
[1:41:59] concerning the ministry
[1:42:02] but when he fulfilled all those
[1:42:04] prophecies
[1:42:05] that described the person amen
[1:42:09] that this person would come
[1:42:12] he would be a prophet he would be a
[1:42:14] messenger and his duty was to reveal the
[1:42:19] mysteries that were contained in the
[1:42:21] word
[1:42:24] but can you say then okay if that was
[1:42:26] him what was his ministry
[1:42:32] his ministry
[1:42:33] started with a pillar of fire at his
[1:42:36] birth
[1:42:38] never read a book
[1:42:40] never read a bible
[1:42:44] right
[1:42:44] his ministry was a whirlwind in a bush
[1:42:50] all this was his ministry
[1:42:56] don't
[1:42:58] drink or smoke
[1:43:00] or defile your body in any way for i
[1:43:03] have a work to do for you
[1:43:08] down at the
[1:43:10] river
[1:43:12] the ohio river
[1:43:18] your ministry
[1:43:20] shall forerun the second coming of
[1:43:22] christ
[1:43:26] so
[1:43:27] what he was
[1:43:30] and what he was doing
[1:43:32] he wasn't fulfilling malachi 4 5
[1:43:36] yes he was
[1:43:39] but
[1:43:40] it wasn't the fulfilling of malachi 4 5
[1:43:43] that we rest in
[1:43:46] it's the work that malachi 4 5 was going
[1:43:49] to do
[1:43:52] that we rest in
[1:43:54] we don't rest in the fact that he was
[1:43:56] the messenger to the lady osean church
[1:43:59] age
[1:44:02] but we rest in the fact he said if you
[1:44:04] will open up i'll come and sup with you
[1:44:08] we don't rest in the fact that he was to
[1:44:11] open the seals
[1:44:15] but when we look we understand that his
[1:44:18] ministry
[1:44:19] though it fulfilled all the
[1:44:22] prophets and what was prophesied of him
[1:44:25] it was something that was waived over us
[1:44:31] the whole ministry
[1:44:33] from beginning to end
[1:44:35] was waved over the people in this day
[1:44:39] put before same signs and wonders same
[1:44:42] ministry that jesus had why because it
[1:44:45] was the sheep wave offering that
[1:44:48] stimulated the revelation that we too
[1:44:52] could come into this maturity
[1:44:58] it's our hope
[1:45:02] it's because we saw that
[1:45:06] and experienced that
[1:45:09] that i believe there's something in me
[1:45:11] that can overcome me
[1:45:13] hallelujah
[1:45:20] all the battle wounds all the scars all
[1:45:23] the heartaches all the fears
[1:45:27] he said it to take you from being a
[1:45:29] coward
[1:45:34] it was the chief offering
[1:45:39] that's
[1:45:39] what this
[1:45:41] ministry was
[1:45:44] if we just could go back in our book
[1:45:47] real quick
[1:45:48] to paragraph 90. i was going to play a
[1:45:51] little portion of tape i'll play that 10
[1:45:53] minutes tonight right before communion
[1:45:56] go back to the paragraph
[1:45:58] uh
[1:46:00] 90.
[1:46:04] and why isn't the sun i'm sure they can
[1:46:06] find it
[1:46:08] and today
[1:46:19] he's
[1:46:20] talking about the chief offering
[1:46:22] first one that came up from that he says
[1:46:25] nine paragraph nine and today he was the
[1:46:27] first son of god to come to full
[1:46:29] maturity to be in god
[1:46:33] he was plucked up from the earth
[1:46:36] and is waved over the
[1:46:38] people the first one
[1:46:41] although he had
[1:46:44] been typed in many times as we'll see
[1:46:48] later
[1:46:49] he was a type but this was really
[1:46:52] the first fruit of them that slapped
[1:46:56] and it was waved over the promised seed
[1:46:59] that had
[1:47:00] the had promise of life
[1:47:05] he was waived at the day of pentecost
[1:47:08] when there came a sound from heaven
[1:47:12] like a a waving mighty wind
[1:47:15] now that wave
[1:47:19] then is not the maturity that we're
[1:47:22] coming to that's right
[1:47:26] now it's it's
[1:47:28] a greater maturity
[1:47:31] now don't look at yourself
[1:47:35] because it's not in your thinking
[1:47:40] the kingdom of god was placed inside of
[1:47:43] you that you can neither understand the
[1:47:45] beginning of the end
[1:47:47] why we look at one another and we see
[1:47:49] failure
[1:47:52] he looks at it he sees the blood
[1:47:56] he sees the purchase
[1:48:00] he sees your name on the book
[1:48:04] he's a
[1:48:06] my peace he has waved over the people
[1:48:08] the pentecostal people that was up at
[1:48:11] pentecost waiting for the blessing to
[1:48:13] come
[1:48:15] and is to be waived and to be waived
[1:48:18] again
[1:48:19] we realize in
[1:48:22] the last days
[1:48:23] according to luke 17 30.
[1:48:27] so it wasn't luke 17 30 that was
[1:48:30] fulfilled it was the waving over the
[1:48:33] people that was fulfilled
[1:48:37] what good would it have been if he was
[1:48:39] luke 17 30 malachi 4 5
[1:48:42] revelations 10 7
[1:48:45] but there was going to be no effect of
[1:48:48] that ministry
[1:48:51] i'm going to hurry
[1:48:54] he said
[1:48:55] he says
[1:48:57] luke 17 30 in the sunday
[1:49:01] in the day that the son of man
[1:49:04] will be revealed
[1:49:07] or
[1:49:08] waved again
[1:49:10] over the people
[1:49:12] so we're just stained yes this is all
[1:49:14] coming up to what we're talking about
[1:49:16] it it
[1:49:18] there had to be something
[1:49:22] that was mature
[1:49:25] because god put it in his plan
[1:49:28] to be waived over the people
[1:49:32] that they could come to maturity you're
[1:49:34] fooling yourself
[1:49:38] if you think you can come to maturity by
[1:49:40] you reading the bible
[1:49:47] and coming to your own understanding
[1:49:52] no
[1:49:55] how many denominations do we have
[1:49:58] how many denominations within the
[1:50:00] denominations
[1:50:04] i mean
[1:50:07] how many
[1:50:08] people after service
[1:50:11] they all have a mini sermon in the
[1:50:12] parking lot of court a mini sermon here
[1:50:16] i'm i'm all for it don't bother me
[1:50:20] but that's that's all good that's all
[1:50:22] fellowship but god already knows what
[1:50:26] he's extracting
[1:50:28] and he knew the only way he could
[1:50:30] extract it
[1:50:32] or bring it into maturity was to wave
[1:50:36] something that was matured over the
[1:50:39] people
[1:50:43] and he had to bring that ministry into
[1:50:45] maturity so he started it the day he
[1:50:49] came
[1:50:50] the pillar of fire showed up
[1:50:56] he's packing the water
[1:50:58] voice in the bush
[1:51:02] he goes out to arizona it's going to be
[1:51:05] a cowboy
[1:51:07] and that old guy starts playing that
[1:51:09] comb
[1:51:11] adam
[1:51:13] where art thou
[1:51:16] william branham
[1:51:19] i have an image of you
[1:51:21] in my mind
[1:51:23] and the image i had was you fulfilling
[1:51:25] malachi 4 5
[1:51:27] luke 17 30 revelations 10 7.
[1:51:31] i have a work for you to do
[1:51:34] i'm going to mold you and make you you
[1:51:37] don't think he was molded and made
[1:51:39] lost his wife lost his baby went through
[1:51:42] the greatest battle he ever went in i
[1:51:44] can't even i
[1:51:46] i used to think well
[1:51:48] i'd want to go through that i want to
[1:51:50] prove i want to do this
[1:51:52] i don't know what i would do
[1:51:54] i would have to do one thing it would
[1:51:56] have to be the grace of god that kept me
[1:52:03] so the ministry
[1:52:06] was what was waived over the people
[1:52:12] sure the sick were healed
[1:52:16] how many of those people do you think
[1:52:17] that were healed back in the early 50s
[1:52:20] are with us today
[1:52:22] how many people you think are healed
[1:52:24] than they still died
[1:52:27] that's not what he was trying to do is
[1:52:29] heal these bodies
[1:52:31] the ministry had come because there was
[1:52:32] a seed
[1:52:34] that he wanted to quicken
[1:52:37] so we understand that that's what his
[1:52:39] ministry was
[1:52:41] it was the maturity waved over the
[1:52:44] believer
[1:52:45] and then we went through this part of it
[1:52:48] he began to explain
[1:52:51] he said
[1:52:52] it's like an automobile
[1:52:56] that is perfectly tuned up
[1:53:02] and it's got gasoline in its tank
[1:53:08] but it doesn't do any good
[1:53:12] until there's something that sparks that
[1:53:15] gasoline
[1:53:18] that's right
[1:53:19] and he looked at the church
[1:53:22] and he said you're setting beautiful in
[1:53:24] order
[1:53:26] you have your dresses on you have your
[1:53:28] hair nice
[1:53:29] you got your church set in order all
[1:53:32] these things are there
[1:53:34] and he said there's been brides and
[1:53:37] churches and brides and brides and
[1:53:40] brides we are not the first people that
[1:53:43] called ourselves the bride
[1:53:46] go down to waco
[1:53:49] go over to the homestead
[1:53:53] you'll see just godly people
[1:53:57] they feel they're called out
[1:53:59] they feel their elect
[1:54:02] but there had to be something come that
[1:54:05] proved it was gasoline
[1:54:10] to prove that it was the word
[1:54:14] and that was a spark he used the type as
[1:54:17] a spark
[1:54:19] his ministry
[1:54:22] the ministry that god committed to
[1:54:25] william branham
[1:54:27] through the prophecies of malachi 4 5
[1:54:31] luke 17 30 and revelations 10 7 that was
[1:54:35] the and john 12 that was committed to
[1:54:39] him
[1:54:40] to fulfill the ministry
[1:54:43] but what the ministry was was to bring
[1:54:46] the spark
[1:54:52] to the word
[1:54:55] that was
[1:54:56] in
[1:54:58] the tank
[1:55:01] let me say it again in this form his
[1:55:04] ministry was to come and germinate
[1:55:09] the seed
[1:55:12] that he placed
[1:55:15] or
[1:55:15] let me say it another way or to start in
[1:55:19] motion
[1:55:23] the extraction
[1:55:27] of the image that he had in his mind
[1:55:31] before the world ever begun
[1:55:37] it was a spark
[1:55:40] it was the only thing that could bring
[1:55:43] it into the image that he had
[1:55:46] no ministry
[1:55:51] great ministers preach the lord jesus
[1:55:55] great ministries do great works and good
[1:55:58] things
[1:56:01] i enjoy listening to good baptist
[1:56:03] preachers
[1:56:07] i enjoy hearing the word of god when
[1:56:09] it's the word of god
[1:56:10] i can eat pie
[1:56:14] i can spit out the seeds
[1:56:17] but nothing
[1:56:20] will germinate and spark
[1:56:23] the
[1:56:24] beginning
[1:56:26] of coming into the image
[1:56:28] of what god had in his mind of you until
[1:56:32] you're sparked by malachi 4 5 luke 17 30
[1:56:36] and revelations 10 7.
[1:56:39] you might get all the mechanics right
[1:56:42] you might be able to explain every
[1:56:44] scripture in this bible
[1:56:46] you might be able to go online and look
[1:56:48] at all these different teachings on this
[1:56:50] subject and that subject and all those
[1:56:53] things but let me tell you you will
[1:56:55] never come into the maturity of god's
[1:56:58] word until you are sparked
[1:57:02] by the revelation of malachi 4 5 luke 17
[1:57:06] 30
[1:57:08] and revelations 10 7. amen
[1:57:14] you say you sure are counting a lot of
[1:57:16] people out i don't count the people out
[1:57:19] i count their revelation out
[1:57:22] i count their wisdom out
[1:57:24] i have con
[1:57:25] account their cumulative knowledge out
[1:57:30] but if you sit back in your heart and
[1:57:32] you think i have more confidence in this
[1:57:34] bible
[1:57:40] then i do what was fulfilled
[1:57:43] in
[1:57:46] that ministry
[1:57:50] you have confidence in your own self
[1:57:55] you have confidence in your own idea
[1:57:58] your own teaching and you know you can
[1:58:00] get it you can get a complica get used
[1:58:02] to a diet
[1:58:04] i'm on a new diet now
[1:58:07] if it tastes good spit it out
[1:58:09] if it tastes like cardboard you can eat
[1:58:11] it
[1:58:15] but you know you can be taught
[1:58:18] how to read the bible
[1:58:22] you can come under influences that allow
[1:58:24] you to go through the word and just
[1:58:26] bring out the things that you see in it
[1:58:32] but if it ain't malachi 4 5 luke 17 30
[1:58:36] revelations 10 7 i'm sorry
[1:58:39] it's wrong
[1:58:41] amen
[1:58:43] that's right exactly what the word i was
[1:58:45] going to say
[1:58:47] you can take over right now buddy i know
[1:58:49] you got the inspiration though okay
[1:58:52] billy said absolute
[1:58:57] it's the absolute
[1:59:00] it'll never spark your gas
[1:59:02] to get you to move
[1:59:06] and it's the only thing that proves
[1:59:09] that what's in your tank
[1:59:12] is gas
[1:59:17] because if it's water
[1:59:23] let's go here a little bit
[1:59:26] let's let's bring this thought in
[1:59:32] we got too much
[1:59:37] that's what happens to our music when
[1:59:38] it's not right
[1:59:41] it's not moving the car
[1:59:48] and how many times you think your car
[1:59:50] sparks when you go down the road
[1:59:55] one spark
[2:00:04] it's got a spark
[2:00:06] i don't know how many does anybody know
[2:00:07] how many times the car sparks
[2:00:10] in a minute
[2:00:13] no mechanics
[2:00:16] i'll just take your guess
[2:00:19] a lot
[2:00:20] thank you
[2:00:23] a lot
[2:00:25] right it's got to continually spark pop
[2:00:27] pop pow pow to get you to move to move
[2:00:30] to move
[2:00:32] you don't get one spark
[2:00:34] you don't get one revelation
[2:00:36] you don't sit back and say i believe
[2:00:38] malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. i
[2:00:42] i believe it i've got gas in my tank
[2:00:45] i've got my church ordered down i've got
[2:00:47] the mechanics no that's not what it is
[2:00:50] this ministry is the spark
[2:00:52] on the word
[2:00:54] that moves you all away to the rapture
[2:01:02] praise god
[2:01:05] don't look at the
[2:01:06] negative
[2:01:08] look at it that he didn't say
[2:01:11] in in
[2:01:12] revelations 3 and 14
[2:01:15] he didn't say
[2:01:17] who gets it all right
[2:01:20] he says he that have ear
[2:01:22] to hear
[2:01:24] let him hear
[2:01:28] what is it that we're hearing
[2:01:31] it's it's him saying
[2:01:35] i've come
[2:01:38] to wave over you
[2:01:42] the maturity
[2:01:45] so you can see
[2:01:48] what
[2:01:51] a real son of god
[2:01:53] looks like
[2:01:55] amen
[2:01:58] we all have an idea
[2:02:01] of what jesus was like
[2:02:05] i always got him to be a big guy
[2:02:09] prophet god said he was a little guy
[2:02:11] so all us little guys we take hope
[2:02:15] all you big guys don't be discouraged he
[2:02:17] loves big guys too
[2:02:21] he makes them in all shapes rather than
[2:02:23] walking
[2:02:24] don't don't worry
[2:02:26] you you paid a great price for this
[2:02:28] kingdom
[2:02:32] he's not interested
[2:02:35] in
[2:02:36] what you think you are
[2:02:39] he's not interested
[2:02:41] in
[2:02:42] what
[2:02:43] place you've got
[2:02:45] yourself into
[2:02:46] he's only interested in one thing
[2:02:49] and that's to bring his word to pass
[2:02:54] the only thing he's interested in is an
[2:02:57] extracting out of you you know what
[2:02:59] extract means right to pull out just
[2:03:02] like the sun pulls the seed out is what
[2:03:05] he had in his mind in the beginning
[2:03:09] that's in you
[2:03:11] that's what he's trying to bring
[2:03:14] you say how can i move into that
[2:03:19] there's got to be
[2:03:21] the spark
[2:03:26] it can't be a secondhand spark
[2:03:29] how many knows what a second hand spark
[2:03:31] is
[2:03:33] that's when your car's dead
[2:03:35] sitting on the side of the road with two
[2:03:38] wires coming out of the hood
[2:03:45] that means it's not running on its own
[2:03:50] and you might fire it up and it'll run
[2:03:53] awhile
[2:03:54] and then you'll find yourself dead on
[2:03:56] the road again
[2:03:59] needing another revival
[2:04:01] needing another jump start
[2:04:10] when you come to the understanding
[2:04:14] that there's an absolute
[2:04:17] that there's a sheep offering
[2:04:19] that's where you're going to get your
[2:04:21] spark
[2:04:22] from then when we begin to understand
[2:04:26] what was fulfilled he says no matter how
[2:04:29] much theologies claim or how well you
[2:04:32] got your church see how much education
[2:04:35] you got how much
[2:04:36] like the bible until that sheaf wave
[2:04:43] glory
[2:04:44] until that chief waves waves over you
[2:04:48] you don't even know where you're going
[2:04:51] you don't even know what image you're to
[2:04:53] become in
[2:04:55] you say brother mclaren it sure sounds
[2:04:57] to me like you're following the man
[2:05:01] just read what paul said
[2:05:04] he said be ye followers of
[2:05:09] wow
[2:05:10] how could he say that
[2:05:14] because he meant the spark
[2:05:18] amen he had the sheath wave
[2:05:22] waved over him
[2:05:24] it didn't matter where he was it didn't
[2:05:25] matter what he was doing but when that
[2:05:27] pillar of fire came
[2:05:29] ken was waved over him in the
[2:05:31] fulfillment of the word of god
[2:05:35] amen
[2:05:37] there he was
[2:05:40] blind
[2:05:44] i think that's the first thing that
[2:05:46] we've got to do to move forward is get
[2:05:47] blind
[2:05:49] blinded to the things of the world bind
[2:05:51] into the teachings of the world blind to
[2:05:54] the influences of all of these guys
[2:05:58] and and
[2:05:59] everything
[2:06:05] come steadfast
[2:06:08] i'm not against reading in fact i used
[2:06:09] to have a lot of the books great
[2:06:11] inspired book sister ellen gave a lot of
[2:06:13] them to me of the early church warriors
[2:06:15] and what those guys went through and
[2:06:17] what their sacrifice was
[2:06:20] smith wigglesworth and
[2:06:22] and them great vibes and the revival
[2:06:24] methodist revival coming out charles
[2:06:26] finley some of those guys are you see
[2:06:28] what they put into the gospel
[2:06:33] but they couldn't go no higher
[2:06:37] because the sheath wave the sheaf wave
[2:06:40] was the separation
[2:06:42] malachi 4 5 the ministry of malachi 4 5.
[2:06:46] jesus christ veiling himself
[2:06:50] in a man called william branham
[2:06:53] was the test
[2:07:00] it was the maturity
[2:07:03] and only those that recognized it were
[2:07:05] going to come to that maturity
[2:07:08] that we're going to listen to the spark
[2:07:12] that was going to spark the word in them
[2:07:15] and keep them moving
[2:07:17] into the rapture
[2:07:23] and that was
[2:07:24] just
[2:07:26] the preliminaries of what that i was
[2:07:28] going to preach
[2:07:31] and we were going to start at paragraph
[2:07:33] 40
[2:07:35] because now we he's going to go into how
[2:07:38] far back do we go and what the abstract
[2:07:41] is
[2:07:42] how far is god taking you back
[2:07:47] the abstract
[2:07:49] takes
[2:07:50] it all the way back
[2:07:53] to the beginning
[2:07:54] of the property
[2:08:00] those people that went in oklahoma
[2:08:02] they had steaks
[2:08:06] and when they found a piece of ground
[2:08:08] they wanted they drove stakes
[2:08:14] and then they went and surveyed it
[2:08:17] and that became the abstract
[2:08:20] because that's when it was originally
[2:08:25] brought into existence
[2:08:27] as a claimed piece of property
[2:08:33] when were you brought into existence
[2:08:37] to be a claimed
[2:08:39] piece of property
[2:08:44] before the foundations of the world
[2:08:47] where does your authority go back to
[2:08:52] it's not voted in
[2:08:57] glory
[2:08:59] hallelujah
[2:09:01] it's not earned
[2:09:04] why is it mine
[2:09:08] why do i have the abstract
[2:09:10] because i was created in his mind in the
[2:09:14] beginning
[2:09:16] that's how far back my claim goes
[2:09:21] and satan's taken a lot of it away from
[2:09:24] me
[2:09:25] my courage
[2:09:27] my power
[2:09:30] my works
[2:09:33] but praise god
[2:09:36] there was a wave offering that came
[2:09:39] and said this is yours
[2:09:41] and now there's a spark
[2:09:44] that doesn't make us cowards anymore it
[2:09:47] makes us create just just say satan shut
[2:09:50] up
[2:09:54] it's mine
[2:09:56] well how far back does it go you're
[2:09:58] saying can only take you he can only
[2:10:00] take you he can only take me back to
[2:10:03] october 27 1949.
[2:10:08] all the farther he can bring me back
[2:10:11] and he can show me everything
[2:10:14] from then till now
[2:10:18] praise god
[2:10:21] but now somebody come with the abstract
[2:10:25] and they said no you were with me
[2:10:34] i don't want to stop but i'm going to i
[2:10:35] promise you
[2:10:37] i'm good
[2:10:40] that's why he said when he raised up
[2:10:44] you
[2:10:45] raised up with him
[2:10:49] are you looking for a resurrection you
[2:10:51] already have a resurrection you are
[2:10:54] already resurrected you are already
[2:10:58] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[2:11:00] jesus
[2:11:02] but if you look at yourself and you look
[2:11:04] at the mirror
[2:11:07] you won't get the courage to go take
[2:11:10] what's yours
[2:11:15] but if you left the revelation
[2:11:20] that's contained in the seven seals
[2:11:24] sparked you
[2:11:28] it'll start to bring to life
[2:11:30] the image that god had of you
[2:11:36] and you'll start
[2:11:39] taking steps what do we say preached on
[2:11:41] a million times
[2:11:43] step is
[2:11:44] possession
[2:11:46] you shall possess the gates of your
[2:11:49] enemy
[2:11:50] every doorway
[2:11:52] that he came into your life
[2:11:54] every scar every complex every sin every
[2:11:58] mistake
[2:12:01] you'll start claiming it back
[2:12:04] until you drive them outside of your
[2:12:07] gates
[2:12:09] how's that gonna happen
[2:12:10] he sent a spark
[2:12:15] that's part's called revelation
[2:12:20] of the sheaf wave offering
[2:12:23] and what's contained in it
[2:12:26] and
[2:12:26] you this morning
[2:12:28] and myself this morning as miserable
[2:12:32] as a wretch
[2:12:35] that i am
[2:12:37] i rejoice
[2:12:42] don't rejoice
[2:12:44] because you have power over devils
[2:12:47] he says but rather rejoice
[2:12:50] because your name
[2:12:52] is written in heaven
[2:12:58] this morning
[2:13:00] i believe god has an individual for us
[2:13:02] ever
[2:13:03] he wants to extract
[2:13:05] as individuals
[2:13:07] i believe he
[2:13:09] has an image of what he wants to bring a
[2:13:11] congregation into
[2:13:15] what his church is
[2:13:17] and what his
[2:13:19] bride is
[2:13:20] i believe he has all those things
[2:13:23] in plan
[2:13:24] and
[2:13:25] let me say this
[2:13:28] the quicker time goes
[2:13:30] and the quicker we get to the appointed
[2:13:32] end of time
[2:13:34] the quicker god's going to move
[2:13:37] to bring his church
[2:13:38] into perfection
[2:13:41] so we didn't go much farther in the
[2:13:44] message this morning but i think if we
[2:13:46] can just let that set in our mind
[2:13:49] the only way god could extract the image
[2:13:55] that he had of you in the beginning
[2:13:59] was to wave over you the ministry of
[2:14:02] malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7.
[2:14:08] the only thing that's going to spark the
[2:14:10] word gas that's in your tank is that
[2:14:13] ministry amen
[2:14:16] you say are you shutting the world out i
[2:14:19] i don't know about them
[2:14:23] what is it to you
[2:14:26] if they tarry
[2:14:27] until i come but follow me
[2:14:31] amen
[2:14:32] follow me
[2:14:35] and
[2:14:36] what a privilege this morning
[2:14:40] to know
[2:14:42] that you're
[2:14:43] elect
[2:14:46] that's right
[2:14:49] brother matt why
[2:14:55] you asked matt why
[2:14:58] heidi
[2:15:00] married him
[2:15:03] gotta hear his testimony poor heidi had
[2:15:05] to go bail matt out of jail
[2:15:09] it predestinated
[2:15:13] beautiful
[2:15:15] all that he foreknew
[2:15:20] he predestinated
[2:15:24] and all that he predestinated he
[2:15:26] sanctified
[2:15:28] and now all that he predestinated he's
[2:15:31] going to glorify
[2:15:32] praise god for his
[2:15:34] workmanship in christ jesus god bless
