[Music] god bless you let's pray dear lord this morning we come to you father as we were singing father i was thinking about david father when he has to pronounce a judgment they told him about a mandate father he didn't know that that man was him what a judgment father he said such a man is to die all father but when they told him that man it's you father he cry that's how we are father this morning we just feel ourself as david father we are able father [Music] to pronounce judgment different things for other without looking ourself in the mirror father but father we don't wanna be so this morning we wanna come close to you father look ourselves in that mirror father and see actually what we are father father we just saying father we know there is enough grace and mercy this morning father we don't want to hide ourselves further we want to see ourselves like we are and cry to you father for mercy father forgive us father for our judgment father forgive us because we need that mercy this morning father as we come close to you and we come to hear what you have to say about us father let us father you really give ourselves like we are father and let the world watch us father oh lord be with the preacher father because we know behind the man father you will be hiding yourself this morning and speak to your bride father because you choose us father we didn't choose ourself father you saw us before the foundation father oh we recognize our calling father we are here this morning father whatever what the devil say about us father we don't believe that but we believe the word of god that you said for us in this time father and we claim every promised body that belongs to us father that's why we believe that every sickness father don't have all god and authority on your children this morning father because we you say we are free free and dead father because we believe father in your name the name of jesus christ the name that has been given father to us for victory father we accept that victory this morning father let us claim every in every thing that hold us back father we say we are free because you say so father let us let us get what you have for us this morning and enjoy your presence father and let the holy ghost be now made because you say so we believe it and glory be unto you in jesus christ in jesus christ we pray amen [Music] amen amen amen it's good to be gathered in the presence of the lord we want to welcome everyone and then all our visitors we welcome you this morning and then all that are viewing online we welcome you this morning it's invited by the mike for so i'm reading god bless you good morning we're going to do this little old fashioned again this morning don't have someone back there to work the verses so we'll just read it in our bibles this morning you know psalm 84 and verse 1 says this how amiable are thy tabernacles oh lord of hosts what struck me about that verse is is that statement thy tabernacles not tabernacle singular but thy tabernacles plural how amiable are thy tabernacles plural then it says in verse 4 it says blessed are they that dwell in thy house so one house but many tabernacles many courts verse 2 verse 10 but one house verse 11. know and as i was meditating over that you know obviously the scripture came to mind where jesus was telling his disciples in john 14 in my father's house are many mansions he goes on to say i go to prepare a place for you that where i am present tense there ye may be also many tabernacles many mansions many courts one house you know a house or a tabernacle or a mansion is a dwelling place you know when the children of israel were first led out of the land of egypt you know they experienced a change of dwelling place you know when they first were living in egypt they had houses in the best part of the land goshen you know but that those houses became a place of death for them if they didn't have blood applied to those houses and you know it was after that one night with the bloody lamb that became the last night they ever dwelt in those houses from that point in time their dwelling place changed and they never dwelt in those houses again they moved from their houses to his tabernacles it says in leviticus 23 42 it says ye shall dwell in booths seven days all that are israelites born shall dwell in booths that your generations may know that i made the children of israel to dwell in booths when i brought them out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god it says in verse 34 that that time of remembrance that he's speaking of is called the feast of the tabernacles it was a reminder to them that god had changed their dwelling place that they went from dwelling in houses to dwelling in booths tabernacles temporary dwelling places and interestingly enough those temporary dwelling places were in the presence of the pillar of fire says in psalm 84 10 for a day and thy courts is better than a thousand i had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of wickedness now how how many are grateful that they experienced a change in dwelling place amen you know there might have been a time when we lived comfortably in egypt but then after a night with a bloody lamb we found ourselves in a temporary dwelling place dwelling with the pillar of fire that where i am their ye may be also you know tabernacles are a temporary dwelling place in fact they're usually made of skin interestingly enough you know for the children of israel there was that whole period of time where they had a temporary journey living in temporary tabernacles of skin you know as we read in john 14 it says there's a place prepared for each of us a mansion a tabernacle a house a booth whatever you want to call it but a dwelling place where he is there we may be awesome you know there's all kinds of uh there's all kinds of lifestyle magazines that might flood our mailboxes you know you've got country living you've got southern living you've got coastal living apparently there's a south lake living it comes to my mailbox and i don't even live in south lake all of them these lifestyle magazines that speak of a lifestyle this lifestyle is tabernacle living you know and as we read psalm 84 this morning which by the way was once again addressed to the sons of korah people that knew what redemption was you know this talks a little bit about tabernacle living it's so important that we don't write that off as a future dwelling place you know as we read this issue of tabernacle living notice what kind of lifestyle this is it says in verse 2 my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh cry out for the living god i think about that my very flesh cries out for the living god you know we know that we battle our flesh daily that would constantly pull us back to egypt but with tabernacle living there's a submission of that flesh so that it cries out for his tabernacles tabernacle living in verse 4 blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee continuous praise no matter when you look in this house those who dwell there are a constant praise to the lord verse 5 blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them i like the way that the new king james says it whose heart is set on a pilgrimage the new american standard says in whose heart are the highways of zion that's pretty good the lifestyle of tabernacle living verse six i like this one who passing through the valley of bacca make it a well you know that valley of bacca isn't mentioned anywhere else in scripture and it actually means in the hebrew the valley of sorrow or the valley of weeping no tabernacle living isn't that you won't go through the valley of sorrow but that even when you're there can be found a stream of living water those who passing through the valley of bacon make it a well tabernacle living verse 7 every one of them in zion appeareth before god while you might read casually about those that seek god in southern living in tabernacle living you have a place in his presence in verse 11 the lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly you know i think i agree with verse 10 i had rather be a doorkeeper in tabernacle living than to dwell in everything that country living and southern living and luxury living and coastal living might offer so as we read this together this magazine that describes the lifestyle of tabernacle living you know i hope that you can put yourself in the scripture that where i am there ye may be also let's read psalm 84 together starting in verse 1 how amiable are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god yea the sparrow hath found in house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars o lord of hosts my king and my god blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee selah blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them who passing through the valley of bacca make it a well the rain also fillet the pools they go from strength to strength every one of them in zion appeareth before god oh lord god of hosts hear my prayer give ear o god of jacob selah behold o god our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed for a day and thy courts is better than a thousand i had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of wickedness for the lord god is a sun and shield the lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly oh lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee amen god bless you i have your seats oh my heart was a straightness a whole video frown all i know in the pace where my sins dragged me down oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] on the runway [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music]

the lord jesus christ father there's going to be tithing and offerings be brought up in your house because it's written that bring your fighting and offering in the house of god that you may bless it

there's a levels of the world around us men want to go to the moon and men want to go to mars father but we want to go to beautiful land men want buildings and mansions and properties and votes and things father but we want a new bodies or there's something else somewhere and there's something in us that knows it's real now we ask you father too take us there we ask that you would grant it to us this morning in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated we have a baby dedication this morning so uh we're going to dedicate anna l cabala patrick dan's daughter and i wanted to read a scripture patrick wanted me to read a scripture if they would get ready and prepare to come at this time and it's found in romans chapter 12 and the 12th verse and as you know patrick will give a little testimony but they had a very difficult pregnancy and a child birth very premature and patrick said this is the scripture that they held on to so as they're getting ready to come it says rejoice in hope patient and tribulation continually instant in prayer and they just hung on that so let's just sing uh bring them in this morning do you help me billy saying that um jesus bring the little ones to jesus you know it it's a miracle that someone could produce you know like this can produce something so beautiful as this amen amen you know i love patrick's testimony i i like to give it because you know brother patrick was working on a job somewhere and he just never could sleep and he was tormented and and he just felt demons were just driving him crazy so he made a comment to the fellow standing next to him he says you may not see me tomorrow i think i'll just go kill myself and the guy said wait a minute before you do diet go talk to these people well he was a brother that used to go to church and backslidden went out in the world but it just tells you once you got this you can't get away from him and so patrick came over billy was it you that brought him over and billy brought him over and we sat in the couch that day and we talked to him we prayed for him and uh and uh so he said i i said now you you'll sleep and i said we prayed we asked that demon to leave them and uh i said billy just give him a tape or a book and belly gave him demonology you know so and uh so then one day i see patrick he's coming across the parking lot and of course i want to know if he's been sleeping right so i said patrick you're going to see me says oh no i can't sleep i just can't sleep i listen to these tapes all night long he said i just cannot keep leasing and doing so i you know this is uh he's always been a great friend of mine and and this is one of the real genuine conversions that i've seen you know what i mean brother tommy's another genuine conversion i've seen that i've really seen god supernaturally do some wonderful things so patrick i know you want to say a few things about your daughter in the journey you've been on god bless you i thank you all for your prayers we went to many trials in this because my wife all the time was going to like when she gets pregnancy she going to miscarrying all the time like twice and this is the third one and i remember that day at the hospital when we came when she was witness for this baby the doctor said oh this is going to happen the same thing you know we don't understand how this comes but we have to check everything and see and my wife was saying okay or we thank for that but let's go home my wife told me let's go home we just have to go and pray and after some days my wife started waring about what's going on why this happened and one scripture come to me one court of brother branham in the resurrection of jesus found in 56 or 405 i read for my wife because she was wearing some time or what is coming to me it said this god don't want you to be frowning god wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy where it will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset just walk in love and after that my wife never complained about anything and after that we went to hospital oh we look everything is fine now and it's going to be okay and after that here she is and we really thank the lord for that isn't that just the devil he al that's just one of his tricks you know all things remain the same you're trying to overcome all things remain the same but no you say i'm gonna overcome i'm gonna be well god's a victory amen brother patrick we just ask you to ask a blessing on your daughter and we'll praise the congregation god bless you lord jesus we thank you once again with this great gift that you have given to us lord we know in this life it's very hard to raise up kids with all that going on all that the devil messed up in this life but we rely on you lord you have given us this baby and we give you this gift back so that you can make him rise in your way lord jesus i read brother branham saying like teach the kids the way of the lord when they will grow they will remember it lord jesus we thank you for everything we thank you for this blessing we ask you to bless our blessing lord jesus as we commit this baby to you we thank you for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray and ask amen amen let us all pray together as a congregation our heavenly father lord we know that nl's a miracle father the doctor said that she shouldn't be here but father some place in your mind she was father and you placed her name on a book and father that book cannot fail lord god we ask that you keep her father may you guide her parents may she have fellowship may her and her mother be so close father that they're such a friendship that only a mother and daughter can have or we ask you to continue to camp your angels about them may they prosper and be in good health we thank you for this testimony father of your miracle and your love for this couple in jesus name we pray and we dedicate her back to you in your name lord jesus amen amen amen i'll look at you look at me yeah thank you brother patrick amen god bless you you love the lord this morning amen so nice to be in the house of the lord and to fellowship around with the word of the lord we're going to continue this morning on preaching from the message does god change his mind about his word and we're going to build a little bit on what that we spoke on wednesday night i just really enjoyed wednesday night and the fellowship with the people and wait a minute i know that there's somebody here somewhere oh there he is is that justin there it is is that his lovely wife stand up i got to see you guys hey man i i i think i picked justin up at the bus station when he was about as high to my knee and just and he's just grown up and got married now that's wonderful to have you sister genie glad to have him home with you a little bit amen so that's so wonderful hallelujah so we're we're talking down this line does god change his mind about his work and and we try to go through some emphasis on wednesday night about the word that god is uh not changing isn't this book as a put together sermons and edifications and prophecies and writings as god moved on the prophets of old and they they gathered these works together i believe by the leadership of the holy spirit and they put them together in a book that became known as the bible and and you could go back in the history of the church and how they hand wrote these and and then king james organized and brought it together and and they produced the king james bible and what they found it was that there was perfect continuity from all the writings of all the things everything that god wrote by his spirit fit and it fitted and joined together perfectly but there was some books that were written along the way that didn't match up and by the grace of god they were discarded from the word and we remained with this uh this book here that we call the bible but there's a great mystery in this book because the lord said the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so by the same book some people die and by the same book some people live and so the great the great uh understanding is is that it wasn't what god collected that didn't change it was what god thought in the beginning that didn't change and then we begin to talk about how that you were in that thought so this morning we want to just continue down that road because i believe that we're coming into something that's wonderful for the church i believe he's got something in store for us he's got something that is marvelous for us to behold but that he's got to guide us there and so this message was on my heart to play last wednesday night and and then the lord moved on me to to go ahead and speak but it i found out after the fact that this was also the message that the brothers chose to fellowship around the morning and our brother's breakfast and i really encourage you to find out when the brothers breakfast is and and your brothers that can come out make the special effort it's some really marvelous fellowship around the word of god so we're going to play 20 minutes this morning of the message the guide and when brother brown goes to read the scriptures you can stand up and read at that time but what we talked about wednesday night was that that if god thought it he's the keeper of his thoughts he's the keeper and and and so he keeps his sheep so he knows what he's doing and he's keeping you so this i just thought this was a marvelous message it's preached in i believe 19 and six is a 62 is when was it preached i think it was 62 and i think it's a great foreknowledge of the things that's uh coming forth so just sit back for the next 20 minutes and we'll make a few comments this morning and fellowship around the word of god but listen to the scripture and then listen to the description of what a guide is and then each of us i hope this morning comes to realize that we have our own personal guide and we'll fellowship a little bit about that afterwards so uh uh if you go ahead and place this uh scripture up there in it where we're gonna start from and it says we're gonna read it it's out of uh saint john and i don't really see the verse number here but anyway we can look at that when it comes on the board so let's stand together and pray as we listen to the and when the scripture says i think is the seventh verse of the 16th chapter of saint john let's pray our gracious heavenly father we ask you to bless this word to us this morning father we're here because we want to know of you father we're here because we have a promise that if we would gather together in your name that you would be in our midst father we have another promise that you know what we have need of even before we ask father and you promised us that we wouldn't have to bake bread and we're not worried about the bread of the world father we're worried about the bread of life this morning and father we ask that you would break to us the bread of life that you would feed our souls and our spirits if we're down-hearted father we ask that you lift us up if we have fear father of our destiny we ask that you would comfort us well we just want you to have the preeminence this morning lord jesus the small group that's gathered here father that just wants to serve you and dedicate their life to you with their whole heart father we ask you to come fight our battle for us this morning ask you to be with us in jesus name we pray amen god bless you this morning now i wish to read tonight a potion of scripture found over uh in the book of saint john now these little uh scriptures that we read and refer to are to give us a basic for what we're trying to say and always i have never one time as i ever remember of ever coming to the pulpit to try to just say something to be singer i always try to wait watch study pray until i feel that i have something that would help the people if i can't be a help there's nothing to be standing here and see is try to help and now tonight uh of course the bigger part of our crowd is moved out from this morning and uh they had to go home many of them but tonight i told you if you stayed over we're trying to have just about a 45-minute talk on something that i hope would help us and we're going to base this now on saint john the 16th chapter and let's begin about the um the seventh verse of the 16th chapter and read to the the 15th verse nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how big when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come for he shall glorify me or he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father has had are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you now in this 13th verse how be it when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you unto all truth amen when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth what is truth the word for he shall speak you shall not speak of himself but what he hears he'll speak what he hears he'll speak in other words he'll be the one that will reveal the thing mercy and the fourth chapter of hebrews the bible said that the word of god is sharper more powerful than a two-aged sword a discerner of the thoughts of the mind the heart see what he hears he'll speak and he will show you things to come what's going to do that the holy spirit who will come in the name of the lord jesus and i would like to take these next few minutes to call your attention upon the word guide a guide you know i've had some quite experience in the woods a god someone to show you around you have to have a guide when you don't know where you're going and being acquainted with hunting and of the world around i've had the opportunity to meet guides and i am a guide myself in colorado because knowing the country ranching so forth i can guide in colorado now a guide has to know the way he has to know where he's going and what he's doing and how to take care of you along the road he's got to see that you don't come up lost a guide is a selected man the state selects this man if he is the guy and now in going on a trip into the wilderness where perhaps you're not used to going it's not a good thing for you to go without one frankly some places you can't even go without one for instance canada the the guide has to sign your license to the game warden you have to sign yourself in and he is responsible for you if anything happens to you it's his responsibility he's got to take care of you he's got to see that you're not lost he's got to be sure that he don't send you in somewhere that you don't owe your way back and if you do get lost he's got to know the country so well he can pick you up yes they need him he's got to know all these things or he cannot be a guy you cannot be licensed to be a guy for these things sometimes you have to have an appointment call ahead and make arrangements get reservations to be taken out and if you're uh sometimes he's filled up and he cannot take you you have to put it all for a while uh of the earthly god you never have to do that with god's god he's always ready always ready now if you don't get these preparations made and you're figuring on taking a trip into the wilderness where you haven't been before you may come up lost and perish you got about one percent chance to get out of the wilderness that is if it isn't too dense you might have one percent chance to get out by yourself but if it's a very bad wilderness way back you haven't got a chance to get out there's no way to do it because you find yourself on the death wall and then you you're done then you're finished now and you'll perish if you haven't got a guide that knows the country and knows how to get back many of you are acquainted with the article you have read last year out of tucson arizona those boy scouts yet they were trained to know how to take care of themselves they were scouts and they were not just cub scouts they were full scouts and they took a trip up into the mountains and a snow storm come nature changed its position and where they found themselves lost and all of them perished is because that they something change comes along from the regular routine they didn't know how to get out and i forget how many boys there was that perished in the mountain though they had helicopters and the militia out and the national guards and volunteer help and everything but they were lost no one know where they were at and they could not take care of themselves they all perished in the snow because they didn't know whether it was going east north west or south up or down or how it was everything looked the same now a guy knows where he's at regardless of the weather he's uh he's equipped to do that he knows what he's doing he's familiar with everything he knows the looks of everything so he can just be in the darkness he can feel a certain thing for instance here's an old trick to a guide you know if you can see the stars anyone can tell which way you're going if you watch the stars and you always want to watch the one true star there's only one true star and that's in our star the only one he stands in the same place that represents christ the same yesterday today forever others might wander away but he remains the same churches may draw you off this way or some draw you off that way but not him he's always the same well now if you can't see this north star and it's cloudy then if you'll notice if it's daytime and you're lost if you watch the trees the tree is always the moss is on the north side of the tree because the south side of the tree gets the sun more than the north side but what if it's dark and you can't see the moss if you close your eyes and don't try to do any thinking close your eyes and get a slick bark tree put your hands around the tree like this to your fingers neat and then start moving around that tree real slow and when you hit a place where the bark is real thick broke up that's the north side the wind and you can tell which way you're heading north or south and that way all there's many things but it takes guides to know how to do those things just an ordinary man could have been saying i don't feel no difference anything you've got to be trained for that guiding and these boys no doubt that they were fine scouts they might be able to not they might be able to make fires with rocks and so forth like that but to know your way out that's the honey they they did not know their way out so therefore they all perished because they didn't take a guide with them an unthoughtful father two years ago in colorado oh he's going up into the mountains he had a little boy about six seven years old just go take him on his first deer hunt so he went high up on the mountain and the little boy said to his daddy i'm getting tired get on my back we're not high enough up yet the viewers are high on all went to man until he got he didn't know he was a city man he didn't know nothing about how to hunt or where to go any man that knows anything about wilderness knows the deer don't stay up high they don't go up there goats stay up there not deer they're down where they can feed they got to get worthy something to eat and so but this man thought if i get way up in the rock somewhere up there i'll find a big buck he's seen a picture or something stand up on uh standing up on the rock and he thought that's where he'd find him don't pay attention in magazines read my oh my you'll have a nightmare there's only one thing to do is take a guy or you know where you're at and that father had come up a rain oh it was up there we'll have quick reigns that comes and the man hunted too late until it got dark and he couldn't find his way back and then the winds come across the top of the mountains and he himself moving fast and that you have to know how to survive if you're caught out there's another thing know how to survive i've climbed up trees and slid down and climbed up trees and slide down up and down like this to keep alive i'll tuck snow when it would be four foot on each side bust the stump and lay it down and so hungry that i couldn't hardly stand it and bust up these old stumps and light them and let it get hot and melt the snow down and then about one o'clock in the morning two o'clock pull the stumps back and lay down on that warm ground to keep alive and you have to know how to do these things and this man didn't know what he was doing he had nobody with him to direct him and he held his own little son against his bosom until he felt him cool off and died unthoughtful he just took a guide with him he could have brought him right back down the mountain regardless of what time it was see but he waited until it gets dark then he couldn't see his way around that's the trouble with christians today they wait till the darkness settles over then you find out that you've left without the god the god why did you ever see a man that was lost did anybody ever have the experience of bringing a man lost it's the most pitiful thing you've ever seen when a man gets lost he goes wow you don't know what he's doing we caught a man out there a boy and he'd been lost in the woods and he was thought he was a rancher but he's in a wrong territory and he got lost turned around and when they found him three days later he was running like a wild man screaming to the top of his voice his lips was all eat up and he threw his gun away and he didn't know what to do and when his own brother when they had to catch him the time when his own brother come to him he fought at him like an animal god divided he didn't know where he was at why he was lost when a man's lost he's in a state of bewildered and he don't know that he's in that state because his being lost sends his fever upon him then he doesn't know where he's at and how he's acting so is it when a man's lost from god he'll do things that he ordinary wouldn't do he'll do things that it's beyond the thoughts of a human being doing a lost man from god a lost church from god a church that's gone away from god got away from the principles of god's bible will do things that sometimes that you wouldn't expect to find in a church of the living god they'll get their money by bunker games playing lottery gambling anything that they can do they'll teach anything let anything get by pat man on their back who's big payers in the church and so forth like that to let them get by with it trying puck deacons on the boards been married four or five times just in order to get by with it to make ends meet there's only one in you've got to meet that's your obligation to god stand and tell the truth loss lost man is in a bewildered state he's a madman that god has understanding how to go on what to do god in god has always sent a guide to his people god has never failed he sends a god but you've got to accept that god you've got to believe it you've got to go the way he says if you get into a wilderness and your god says we go this way and yet you think you go that way you're going to come up lost now when you god sends us a god to guide us we've got to follow that guy no matter what we think what looks reasonable and what looks ridiculous we're not subjects to divide that the god is the only one god in the old testament sent prophets they were guides because the word of the lord came to the prophet they were guides they instructed the people as we had last night of isaiah uh and uh uzziah they was instructed and they instructed the people and guided them and now god has always sent his guides he's always never been without a god all through the ages god's always had somebody that represented him on this earth and all ages now sometimes they get off the guy off the beam as we call it when jesus is here on earth don't you remember jesus said to the pharisees you blind guides blind gods blind to spiritual things now they were supposed to be guide guides to the people guiding the people to salvation but jesus said you're blind and he said let them alone forth the blind lead the blind won't they for both follow the ditch blind guides oh how the world has been contaminated with that blind guiding he doesn't want you to rely on your own understanding god does not want you to rely on your understanding or your thoughts or any man-made thoughts god sends a guide and god wants you to remember that that's his appointed guide and we must remember him here it says jesus said i will not leave you but i'll pray the father and he'll send you another comforter and this comforter when he was to come was to guide us to all truth amen amen and the word of god is the truth and the word is christ i am the way the truth and the life he is the word in the beginning was the word the word is with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us then if we follow the real true god the holy spirit he was to tell us what he had seen what he had heard and he was to show us things that is to come amen there you are he is going to show you things to come and when the churches today reject that how can we ever expect to go to heaven when the holy spirit was sent to us for a god we'll take some cardinal some bishop some general overseer or somebody like that to guide us when the holy spirit was given to us to guide us and the holy spirit always speaks all the word i've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he'll guide you to it amen i believe that's the reason the coming of the seal at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god should be finished amen to know who god is what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up here by that time amen bring us into the full stature of sons and daughters of god a church that's washed in the blood of christ that's bought without money it's paid for by the blood of jesus christ now here we are a guide and he is god's provided god now we're going through a wilderness and we're on a road somewhere and we can't get along without this guy and dare anybody or try to substitute any other guy if you do he'll take you off the line this guy knows away he knows every inch of the way he knows every thought that's in your heart he knows everybody's here he knows who you are and what you've done and all about you god's god the holy spirit and will reveal things to you and will tell things that he's heard can repeat your words right back and say what you said amen tell you what you've been what you got where you're going that's right a god the correct god and he will guide you to all truth and his word is the truth really not much could be added to that i thought it was pretty plain the real question is do you have one you know that that's the real question it is is our lives uh is our lives uh being led uh you know there's a difference in being believing and being led you can believe something you can believe things you know or and you can set up comfort and you can set up camp now remember as we've been going through this message this message is very timely because we we know that god doesn't change his mind about his word so if if when god created heavens and earth in the beginning he knew why that he created them he knew where they were going what they would be how the ages would change and how the things would come forth so god has a complete understanding of those things and so he mentions about a guide he said a guy has got to be able to take you in and take you out take you in and take you out well god took us in to this wilderness is that right in other words he knew in the beginning he allowed adam to fall and come from where that he was into the garden and go into the wilderness which is this world i believe this there's a song that goes something this world is old a wilderness you know i'm looking for my deliverance you know and so we find ourselves in this world that we're in and it's constantly changing if technology is changing the thinking of man is changing what they're teaching in school is changing how to even how to look upon one another it is changing and and things are just got so to the place that it's become such a sodom and gomorrah that we're to a place that we don't know our way out we don't know our way out we don't know how what we're going to do or or or do we know how to survive in this how are we going to fight these spirits how are we going to deal with those that have your children in public school when they begin to teach there's no god and they begin to teach you can't pray and and all the different things that are coming along you've got to understand this world has rejected god they are there i don't care what face they put on it or or what things i'll tell you you're gonna see the day they'll it's gonna be offensive to put in god we trust on our money you know what i mean they took the ten commandments out of the courthouse they had the ten commandments they took that out why what do you think this is it's two hundred thousand demon demons that are turned against the bride they're sent loose on the bride they're trying to change your landscape this used to be a christian country this used to be you you know like when i first came to texas remember those tip brothers and we had those blue laws you couldn't buy alcohol on sunday you with restaurants certain clothing stores weren't open they had all kinds of things they honored the sabbath but now they don't i think we're up to two o'clock on sunday now you know so maybe a drunk don't run into somebody that's coming home from church thank you you know bedford use didn't used to be what was called the dry city now we've got liquor stores you know there's a little church around the corner they call it the message church and and uh and uh you know the message a lot of people refer to the bible as the message i do too it's the message from god we just have the interpretated message so we got the real message but they turned that to a liquor store you know on my street corner where i come out i got a liquor store on each side of the street you don't think the landscape changed the political landscape has changed the uh educational landscape has changed the spiritual landscape has changed now that the church world believes that they can let any perversion in you just heard prophet of god tell it in other words it's starting to rain it's starting to snow the wind is starting to blow it's starting to get dark all these things you understand these descriptions that he gave that everybody was fine when they were walking in the light and walking in the sunlight and where everything looked the same and they could see and they could see the trees but when darkness came in and don't you understand that we are this is the end time it's either day or night at the time the light doesn't shine it's dark dark you know and and you come against things you look out and you think that it's it's good and if you go back and listen to this message it's if it's uh he testifies when he got lost in the woods and and how he went how he found and it and it goes much farther but when we come to the place that we can recognize that the conditions are really really rapidly around us not only changing economically you i you i listen to a little bit of news they're talking about food shortages how many of you have even considered that to be a reality no we're so fat and sassy we're so comfortable they're they're out there supply chain stories i go to the store i went to buy a mirror no mirrors i thought good no you understand we're not serious i guarantee you don't even think there's a chance in the world that you can get lost don't let he said don't let somebody another guy come come along and take you off in another direction don't let somebody else come and say this is the way this is the way uh this is what's gonna be look at the look at the the conditions you're saying if we were a christian nation and god was in our churches and god was in our pulpit then why are murders up more than they've ever been up why are robberies up why are cries crying up why is everything up because it's not having any effect you know why isn't it have any effect because they have no idea where they're going they don't know where they're going just think of it and they're getting matter and matter and matter the world don't know where they're going i mean at least because he showed us things to come we know there we know what this world's headed to so i it behooves me to ask myself what do i have that's going to lead me through these dark days that are so rapidly approaching do i have a guide because we're told don't go into the wilderness without one don't go don't take that trip don't go in there don't prepare don't go into where that that what you don't know don't don't be foolish enough to think that you possess the goods you hear what he called that man he said the unthoughtful father everybody's living for today like i said this is not a staying message this is a leaving message those boy scouts they knew how to stay they could tie their knots they could start their fires right they could do that but they didn't know their way out they didn't know their way out you know we hit ourselves in a lot of predicaments a lot of situations a lot of bad decisions a lot of things that come into our lives and and it causes us to get in financial fixes and and moral fixes and emotional fixes and all kinds of trouble you want to know something there's only one way to get out of that trouble is to have somebody that knows where they want to take you i've done a lot of counseling with people who have done a lot of things in their life and they don't know how to get rid of the guilt they don't know how to get rid of the shame they don't know how to take their eyes and turn them from the past to to the future they don't know how to take those they leave those things which are behind behind and press for a higher calling of christ but you've got to know when you sit down there and you talk to him you better know the god that can forgive you of all unrighteousness and the prophet of god said that guide has been there before and he knows it so well from beginning to end that he knows every bit of it i tell you i've been in this pits of hell i know a god that can take you from wherever darkness that you think you're in i've sat down with them you know and i i i left the catholic church a long time ago i don't believe in confessing sins and then doing penance i believe in confessing sins and having deliverance i believe in a god that can say you're forgiven and go and sin no more a god that can change a god that can make differences and you got we've got to have that guide none of us in here got this thing figured out i guarantee you we don't i have no idea what's going to come out of this country anymore i don't know what's going on in quote-unquote washington i don't know what's going on in the world i i don't know what china's doing i i don't know what all the people that are coming into our country a hundred you know 95 000 people are marching to our border right now in texas it's going on and i know that we we don't care because we just get up in our morning and we you know as long as we got some little cream of wheat i'm sitting on the table and we're going to go to our little work and we're going to come a little home and we're going to live in our little world and and we don't even realize how many people in egypt got up that morning i didn't know the death angel was coming but some people had a guide and they told them they needed to apply the blood to the post they needed the uh passover meal ready they they needed to be ready to go forward now we understand that the guide if he's a guide we just heard these definitions and i know that all of you are spiritual enough to understand that not only was that related to the spirit but the spirit in our day according to the word of god was going to come and take on the form of a prophet in other words because spirit was going to expressly speak through the ministry of malachi 4 5 that he was going to use the sign of revelations 10 7 to show that he was a heaven-sent guy and he was going as he this was 1962 he makes references to the seals you know it wasn't the seals he says that's why these upcoming seals let me just read it listen to this and the holy ghost always speaks of the word i've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he'll guide you to it now listen he's got guiding us to something that's the reason the coming of the seals you don't think he knew those seals were coming he's a guide he knows where to take us he knows what to take us to you're very privileged people to have god god sends you a guide that is going to lead you through this dark time but you want to know something you've got to have confidence in that guy you've got to believe that guy you've got to put all your trust in him you can't be holding back there there comes a time you just got to humble yourself to it and let them do what that he wants to do he says i tell you he says at the finishing of the seven seals the mystery of god should be finished to know who god is now this is what he's guiding us to okay in other words the guide has got to know where he's taking you to isn't that right so now he's telling us at the finishing of the seals this guy the holy spirit back then he said i can have many things to tell you but i can't tell you now so he comes back in our day veiled in the ministry of a prophet that's right the same word the same spirit now he's going to tell us those things that he couldn't share with us then because it would be too hard for us to bear and he's going to tell us of things to come you know what the things he said are coming our cup are here and it's not even affecting our lives it's not making us any more prayer it don't make us we still miss communion we still miss foot washing we still we still aren't dedicated to service we still don't give our offerings our tithings we don't have any good works we're still pursuing the world the snow's falling the rain's falling the sun's setting it's dark and he said everybody always waits till it's too late to get the guide do you think brother graham is just telling stories you think he suffered the way he suffered the criticism and the mockery and bearing the burden of the gift that made him an oddball thank god amen you said well he wanted to be somebody that was the most nobody man you would have ever met amen and he could have could have been wealthy look at his church our church is better than the church he had did he had theater seats and remember they were working on the air conditioning and the place would get hot he wasn't going to build a kingdom here and and so in other words a guide he he's almost got to become one with that wilderness you understand he's got to know what the signs are what the things are and and the guy shows you know why a guy tells you these things as you go i've had a guide and i i'd look at him and said man i think he's lost not only that i thought he was crazy anybody turned around to me says we're going to go up here about another 300 yards and there'll be some barbed wire finale on this fence on this tree up here where they ran a temporary cattle line down there you know pumping up there man you don't know what it felt like to feel let's see that bob wire there at least he knows he's here well how many times does he have to show us that we're here to where we're going to understand this guide is taking us someplace you understand the the guide isn't a you know like a tour guide this guy ain't a tour guide you know i i i've been overseas and i i you know into her and my first trip over there i took rick steve's book and i looked like every other tourist walking around there and that's where everybody was going everybody was going to the places in the book well i found out i don't even need take the book they've got the book i'll just follow them and i just walked up and said what did he say well what do you think the most crowded restaurants in the whole city were the ones in the tour guide you know what denominations are their tour guides they're just showing you the sights they're showing you what's ben they're showing you history this is what it was this is what it used to be this is it isn't it pretty isn't it nice but a real guy is guiding you through where you've never been now it's up to you to decide whether or not you need them and i'm not talking about as a body of believers i'm not talking as a married couple i'm talking as an individual you want do you want to have a marriage get put back together and be in great shape right away if you're having troubles and fussing people get married and they fuss now leslie was always smarter enough to fuss she'd never fussed with me never talk back or nothing i think she just prayed me around you know that's all she'd have to do just pray me around if i must say pray me out i wouldn't be upset i want to do this praying me this way pray me that but drink me that way hallelujah you don't have to you know something you both get the same kind hey brother brown goes and he says he doesn't guide us different ways he keeps us together because we're all going to the same place but we're going to where we've never been before you understand me spiritually we're going to i believe that we're going to receive things of the father that we've never received before we're going to have measures of faith that we've never had before and there's only one way to get there there's only one way to reach that there's only way one way to understand that is first of all you've got to hire he said in the natural you've got to hire yourself a guide well in this case he said god never leaves his people without of god you as an individual in your life whatever your education level is whatever your upbringing is whatever your ethnicity is whatever your cultural background is that doesn't mean one thing because he sends you a guide and the guide is going to take the african the mexican the irish the anglo the chinese the japanese i don't care how many of them you can name he's gonna all take him to the same place and because he's never changed his mind about his word he's going to take him the same way you see he can't change the way because he can't change his mind about his word so we wednesday night we said you're the word that he can't change his mind about so he when he saw you right the color of your hair the statue your eyes what you are he saw you now that's why the battle's in the mind because he's always telling you that's not true and i'm telling you it is true your name's on the lamb's book of life you're one of his i don't care what he tells you that's the word of the lord to you satan says he's you know i had this saying growing up it helped me if ands buts and wise are all satan's lies you know if god loves you if you know the word of god says this but this will and you ever add your and i did this well let me tell you and this is the reason and this is that and then you know look they're all things god's word is the same amount he doesn't change his mind about it so in other words he he knew where he was taking you he knew where he was taking you he let you come into this wilderness and now he's going to take you out of it we're in going out time we're in the time of being taken out he let us come into this wilderness so we could be conformed into the image of his son he knew what it would take to leave here what does it take to leave here it takes the same spirit that dwelt in him to dwell in you to take you there now let's let's listen again further he said at the finishing of the seven seals the mysteries of god should be finished to know who god is what he is how he lives his nature his being that's what the guide's going to do he's going to tell you he's not a trinitarian he's not three spirits he's one he's got one thought how he thinks you know it it it's beautiful how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up here by that time that that's where we're supposed to be another the guide is sitting here telling us this is where we ought to be we ought to be way up here and let me just finish the quote because it ties everything so beautifully together you're supposed to be be all the way up here by that time see bringing us into the full stature of sons and daughters of god a church that's washed in the blood of jesus christ that's bought without money is paid for by the blood of jesus christ look that's where so the the guide knows where he's taking us so in other words jesus knew because the holy spirit in jesus is the same thing the spirit the spirit of god in creation the invisible things around us are clearly seen uh the invisible things are clearly seen by the visible things around us that same spirit now makes flesh begotten a son creates a body a kinsmen without sin came through the same way but he was the father created both a female part and male part to brought them together by the spoken word brought forth a body like in ours tempted the same way we're tempted fatigued suffered pain everything like we were so he could be a kinsmen pay the price for us so we could be redeemed and then sent us back a guide to lead us to what that he had in mind in the beginning that's what god can't change his mind about he can't change his mind about the image that he had of you in the beginning he knew what he created and i i have the quote laying on my desk and i'll just i'll just uh say it out the way that bill graham said it he said that god put in every seed that he planted the power within that seed to transform into what that he made it to be if you have an apple seed that's that power doesn't come from any place else it's in the seed if that seed is planted in the conditions that god spoke for that seed to be transformed in it'll grow the atmosphere the elements everything is all part of the plan of bringing that seed to life now i want you to send your life the world that you're in the job the heir the people you've married the family around you and all that is all part of the earth that god planted that seed in to bring it forth you understand what i'm saying so you can't compare yourself to somebody else you can't compare your trials to somebody else you can't look at somebody else and say they're blessed i've watched people that i thought man they got everything in life blow their brains out they were missing something maybe they just didn't have what i had then i realized well in order to get what they've got i've got to trade my soul for the demon that gave it to him i ain't ready to do that i believe there's something else don't you i believe there's someplace better i believe there's a place where i'm never going to die i believe that i can receive the earnest of that expectation now in this life so god he totally understands what that he made and what that he planted and what he wanted that seed to be and he knew that that seed because we can see the visible things the hidden things of god are clearly seen in the things around us we can understand you cannot plant bananas in canada i would recommend if someone's going to sell you a canadian grown banana that that thing is a hot house hybrid something or other now you can grow weed up there you can they got miles and miles and miles and miles of it but you can't grow it because the atmosphere and the conditions and the nutrients and the situations were all necessary for it to bring forth your very life the way you got converted the life you were brought up in the people you were raised how everything around your life you might look back and says my life's a shipwreck well it took a shipwreck for you well i messed up here and i messed up here and i got involved with this person and i got involved with that person and i shouldn't have done that and i shouldn't have done that you know what all becomes part of it he who has forgiven much can love much we can't fix nothing you know a person doesn't get out in the wilderness to say i'm lost i'm going to turn this into a desert so i can see he's got to lead you from where you are a lot of search parties have went in for people and got lost themselves a lot of people have jumped in into rivers and waters to save people and perished somebody has got to know what they're doing now i'm persuaded and this is also in the message by divine vindicated revelation that god has provided us a guide someone who can take us out amen amen because we can't see it doesn't matter what comes or goes we can't understand it we don't know but if we'll place our confidence in that guide then we understand that god's provided us something that will take us from where we are to what it is that he wants us to be in other words he's not just taking us from one mess to another you understand that he's just not taking us from one fix to the other he's got an intended outcome for his word so if we understand that he's taking us someplace so what if what is he trying to do i like to read the scriptures if i could ins in the gospel of saint john and the and the the verse uh chapter 4 of the first four verses he said beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world try the spirit in other words where is it guiding you to what is it guiding it to what what is it that that and and it lies right within your own conscience if you really look down in your heart you know balaam never loved those people anyway he hated him he hated what they stood for he didn't like the fact they were poor he didn't like nothing about him so really what began to rule balaam was his heart that's why he kept going to try to change uh the word of god to match his heart i was looking for my book i know it's just right up here but there's a quote in it i'm the only guy in the world can lose a book right in front of him in this much space but he he he says he says listen to this he said brother you judge god by his word he keeps his word and identifies it the truth so remember friend as this is in uh does god ever change his mind about his word paragraph 187 he says he keeps his word and identifies it the truth so remember friend as long as you live don't you never forget this god doesn't change his mind yet he'll bless he will let you go in his permissive will but he won't change his mind he won't change his plan he won't change his word for you no sir you know that's that's a paradoxical statement in other words he's not going to change his word for you and in another route he's not going to change his word for you otherwise i'm not going to change my thoughts of you i'm not going to change my plan for you and there's another space he's looking at someone that wants it changed and that's what balaam did he wanted the plan changed oh i got to say am i am i becoming a balaamite i want the pre-planned plan that god has for me the route that he's taking me the route that he's leading me on the afflictions the situations the circumstances the mental battles the spiritual battles the hurt the pain i get my feelings hurt it drove me into deep deep self-consciousness i learned to protect myself by not getting close to anybody i'd never turn my spirit into anybody's hands and let them ever hurt me again it's hard to be like that and be christ-like i needed someone to take me out of that i would have become a recluse sounds good to me today sometimes it does but he's not going to change it he's not going to change his plan for you another that's what balaam did he wanted to change the plan i want to change the plan i i don't want to go this way hey guide i don't want to cross that stream you want to go a different way yeah i don't want to cross the stream okay we're going to go all the way up this mountain all the way up this hill through this direction all of these stones and valleys you know what he's going to do he's going to bring you back to that stream and now you're ready to cross it oh i'll be glad to cross this dream because he can't change his mind about his word he's the guide he knows where he's taking you he knows what he's taking you through he knows what he's what the finished product is going to be right the statue of a perfect man so he's going to take you through faith he's going to take you through virtue he's going to take you through i guess knowledge he's going to take you through those places and there's a guide takes you from one point to the next point to the next point to the next point because there's no other way to get there there's no other way to get to the statue of the perfect man but to put you through the situations where you have to have faith that's right or virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and then the capstone of love where we should be but you're never going to fall into that love until you have a hundred percent confidence that he's leading your life and you're willing to lay your life down he who saves his life shall lose it but he who loses his life shall save it we've got to come to that place where we understand he's in control he's the guide i'm going to follow him he is not going to forsake me i will never leave you nor forsake you but i personal pronoun will be with you even until the end i go away where it's needful for me to go away so you can develop as an individual into the vision that god had of you in his mind in the beginning and he can't change that he's the keeper of that he's got to keep you he's got to fulfill his word in order to remain god and there's only one thing that god can't do is fail so you're lost out in the wilderness you're confused churches confuse people preachers have done things and taught things and and handled situations that have made people to turn away from god i've talked to many a young man that have that's been in school and they get some teacher who's who's bitter and tired of life and that teacher stuck there maybe you're in ninth grade or tenth grade and you get a teacher and you can't stand them you know where that teacher is going to be five years from now in that classroom why let that one person ruin a life that you've got ahead of you why let that one boss pack up your tools you pack up your tools one time you'll be packing up the tools the rest of your life because there will always be someone there to get under your skin but if you could ever realize wait a minute god put this guy here this is the way he's taking me this guy is on my journey to perfection this tribulation is on my journey to perfection it's going to perform in me the and make come to life the step and the place of virtue that i'm supposed to go to because the guide is leading us from step to step into perfection let's just read down know every spirit he says hereby know ye the spirit of god even the spirit that confesses that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god what is jesus the word what flesh is he coming into come on this is our confession that the word right is god's thought in the beginning the spoken word was original seed that thought that god had of me is going to come in the flesh that's why the prophet told us he says he is word you are word the word became flesh now the flesh is becoming what word look what the guide is telling us i i'm going to tell you what he is i'm going to tell you how he thinks i'm going to tell you how he lives i'm going to tell you what he had in mind you can't bear it now but i'm going to show you things that are to come now he's back being made flesh invisible union of the bride how many sermons could we go through that he knows he doing that he's come in the flesh so that thought that god had he's got to guide you along any road that it would take in order to bring you to the place and the thought that he had of you in the beginning now you looked at paul and said paul it's hard to kick your against the prick do do you understand that do you believe that for you are you hoping to just get out i don't want to hope to get out if i could use the carnal thing is i want to get my guide now i want to resolve in my heart today that i need a guide you know how how many single mothers we have single teenage mothers across this country because they just let some little boy flash their eyes at them and and say words and work on their emotion just what satan did to ever you know and if if they had a guide or they reject the guide you know parents say that boy's no good don't hang around that boy don't go with that boy oh no mama he's a good boy he's got a hundred hours of community service you know you don't listen to the guide you're going to do it your way uh-huh and then you know you end up with a baby and then you just pray to god some guy is going to come along and accept that baby is his no i can't do nothing about the past but i can guide the those that i can at least share the truth with how many things how much you know why do we have drug addicts like we've got in alcoholics and all these things you know why they're substitutes the only way to get out of it is to get the guide that can take you out the only way to get out of the place you are in is get back with the guy you got trouble in your marriage you know what i can sit down with you in five minutes and tell you why you're gonna have trouble you don't listen to tapes together you don't read your bible together you don't pray together and you're not confident in your own salvation that was a marriage seminar really are you both trying to leave or did you marry a fashion model you don't want to marry a fashion model i want to marry someone i'm going to spend eternity with i'm over these are things brother graham said i want to marry someone that's going to raise my children be a good mother he told us what to look for many of you want children that's a desirable thing you have a scripture you're saved through childbearing we need to get out of the woes me and we need to start laying hold of the promise of god and say god has brought me this route because there's something that he's trying to perform in me and create in me amen he is the potter and he has power over the clay let's just finish our this reading and we'll go to the next every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ is coming the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now is already in the world let's jump over to the 17th verse because this is where god's taking us you understand he's trying to make us into something you understand that is that clear enough i don't care what brain battles you've been through i don't care what problems in life you've had all of it's in his hands and he can guide us out of them all many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth us from them all he says herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment how many believe we're in the day of judgment we're having another toilet paper shortage they're rationing paper towels there's no end in sight gasoline is up to five dollars a gallon and they don't even know what's going to happen to heating we've got thousands and thousands hundreds of thousands of homeless people living on tents on the streets of our cities crime is everywhere they don't even arrest you for shoplifting you you understand that the lord spoke in his scripture that those that were servants or policemen or those in authority were to carry out the righteous and the wrath of god against the unrighteous so what's happening to this country they're abandoning god no okay we're not going we're not going to enforce that that punishment you can do all these minor misdemeanor things with no no punishment it may not be at your front door but it's coming pretty soon your car will be broken too and you'll call the police and they'll say we don't have enough of us would you please would you please fill out a form online and if the 3 000 officers we have just happened to run across that item in the 16 million people that we're policing we'll give you a place to pick it up it's the way it's getting i mean we might as well face it we're at the end of this thing no democracy has lasted 200 years we're bankrupt we are bankrupt we're going to print money we're going to tax everybody if you do a transaction over 600 dollars the government's going to check on you parents are standing up at school board meetings arguing about what the schools are teaching they should have a say the fbi is going to their houses yes to see if they're an insurrectionist i don't know how i've got away with it so long i'm just glad nobody listens to me no i'm serious it's just where we are and then if we i i had another a place that i i wanted to read that i thought was just so perfectly uh fit in but uh we'll just go on and close now because we're trying to make our point today is that the it's a it's a scripture in romans that says the potter have potter over the clay to make one unto honor and one to dishonor probably some of you guys with your phones can have that in a matter of of seconds but uh it's it's romans 9 21. it says now let's take this to heart for a moment hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endureth with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afford prepared unto glory we can't get out of the plan of god and he's not going to change his mind and whatever pathway when you settle that guide in your heart whichever way he leads you you're confident that what he leads you through is to the perfection of the vessel that he pre-prepared for honor so whatever place he's taking you whatever you're going through whatever you're suffering you never have to look like there's no hope i'm stuck with this thing you're stuck with whatever you're going through till the season of its accomplishment if it's the train of your faith let it work perfection be patient because he's not going to change he's going to guide you you we think well if he guided me i wouldn't go through this no he guides you through it because when he created that seed it took all of those things to put into that seed what it's going to become and what are we coming he says he's bringing us into that statue of a perfect man that that same spirit that dwelt in christ jesus would also dwell in us and if it quickened his mortal body it quickens our mortal body he learned obedience by what the things he suffered until he became fully obedient even unto the death of the cross so much so that he could say i have power to lay my life down and i have power to take it up again amen don't let satan beat you over the head that you have no faith to get well that would mean that you have your destiny in your own hands you can raise your hands and say lord help my unbelief lord i wouldn't have come this way there's no way that i've come that you didn't know you knew the beginning from the end you knew where you were taking me when i committed myself prophet of god said when you become a christian he says that's when the battles begin but we've got to come to this place we need a guide we're in the darkest mess we've ever been in and god sent us one it was the spirit of the lord jesus christ it was none other than the same spirit that dwelt in jesus christ but he veiled himself in a messenger in some physical form so that he could speak to us show us vindicate to us prove to us beyond of a shallow doubt i'm the guide i've been there i've lost a wife i've lost a child i was tormented i was going to blow a boy's brain that's out i was going to do this and do that but one day up on the hill i heard that old cowboy plane the old rugged cross and i heard the voice blow through the trees going adam where art down oh yeah and then he went back and the angel of the lord came to him and told him what he would do and he let his mother-in-law for his wife sake talk out of it you don't think he paid the price to know what it meant to stay with god's word we're not best based on whims we're based on raw reality and the raw reality is we shouldn't take another step until we get aligned with this guide because god is not going to change his mind about his word for nothing he's not going to change his mind about you he's going to do whatever he needs to do to get you in line he's going to do whatever he needs to know he puts your name in the book and he's going to get you to be the person whose name is in that book that character that we'll take with us we took nothing into this world we'll take nothing else out but our character and that character is going to be in christ i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in fire i counsel thee to buy white raiment to cover thy nakedness he counseled us he's counseling us this morning let's clean out the thoughts of the world he knows what we have need of before we ask let's center our lives on his leadership and all else will be provided he'll take care of everything else this evening i hope you come back i hope you're not working today i hope you're not too busy today but if you can come back we'll listen to the rest of this tape this evening and i i just trusted bless you i encourage you to listen to the message of the hour i i i i'm imploring you this morning to form your own personal relationship with your guide it'll bring everything together in your life in perfect harmony because he's not going to lead you trials you go through trials like he said you want to hunt goats you got to climb the rocks you want to fly fish high mountain streams you got to take the trails into the streams you've got to go the way that leads you there and you have to have a guide to lead you and he knows where he's taking you he knows what he's making he knows what he's building he knows what you have need of even before you ask all you have to do is have confidence in your guide and he'll get you all the way there god bless you let's stand this morning i'm glad god didn't give up on me i'm glad with all my heart that he saw something in me that i didn't see that he put something in me i would have never seen myself in this pulpit i'd never want to be here i don't understand it but i can't use my weaknesses as an excuse and i can't use my abilities so i'm stuck with one thing right yes my grace is sufficient for you amen i'm stuck with one thing lord okay i'm in a lot of places i shouldn't be i have a lot of thoughts i don't want to have i have a lot of feelings but they're there for my good and i believe you can take me i'm going to commit myself to this word actually evidence of the holy spirit is following that guide following that word and i trust it's going to lead me because i i'm confident lord that you're taking me someplace and i'm not going to complain anymore about hard days and the things that i don't think might be right i'm not going to complain father about the criticisms and those things i'm going to believe that i'm in the palm of your hand and nothing can pluck me out i'm going to believe that you're the potter and i'm the clay and you're the one that is shaping me into what that it is that you wanted my vessel to be father i realize that every vessel in here is in your hands and you're molding every life in here and lord you're standing here this morning offering yourself to each person you're saying let me guide you let me lead you away from your dark past let me take the guilt and the shame away will you believe me when i tell you that you're forgiven that when i was on calvary and they drove those nails into my hand i was doing that for you when they scourged me i was doing it for every sick person when i was in despair and i cried out father let this cup pass me but i said nevertheless thy will be done and i took captive captive and i've set my people free this morning if you may believe the message i'm not doubting that but it's time not to just know there is a guide and there's a time that you're just not following in in the crowd but there comes a time where it's got to be you making your decision then i'm going to make it to heaven i can see this world is crumbling around me and i want to align myself with the only person the only message that can take me out of this dark wilderness i'm going to make a vow in my heart to myself that i'm going to bring this leadership into my life as much as i like music and i like the beat and i like the song and i like the style and i like the way that it makes me feel i know that that's just taking me deeper into darkness though i like the personalities of my friends and the way they make me feel and the sensations that unbelieving boy brings i'm going to bring my body under subjection i'm not going to be led by any other spirit because they're guiding me and they're guiding me somewhere and they're guiding me deeper and deeper to a place that i can't find myself out of the lord you're offering me a guide this morning you're offering me someone that knows what lies ahead and will show me things to come lord and we need that soul just so badly lord i confess to this people this morning i need you i need you to show me which way to go i i've got quotes i wanted to read lord about you've got to change your experiences god of so many quotes father but you know each heart and i'm trusting this morning father you will come by and you will guide each heart that you'll touch each heart and tell them i'm here for you i'm here to guide you i'm here to take you into the palm of my hand that nothing will pluck you out and lord i accept that leadership this morning father oh i know the time is near where everything i hold here all i want to see all i want to see is jesus will lay before all i want to see all i want to see is well done my face all i want to see is jesus amen this morning if you need prayer maybe your past is just haunts you or maybe you're in a place that you just don't know how to get out and you're fixed if you have a need not just i want more of the lord or but if you actually have a real need in a real situation and you would like us to pray for you as a body and as a pastor we'd be happy to pray for you this morning if you need it if you're not you can have what you need right at your seat but if i just want to say if you feel prayer will help you we want to offer that help god bless you brother is me is jesus me oh grace all i want to see is gracious father so thankful to be in your house lord we desire this guide oh god in our lives father father we desire this guide every decision we make everywhere we go father to be led by your spirit lord father we
