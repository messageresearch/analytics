Description:
Sanctification 
Br. Randy Vertin
Wednesday Service: August 4,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

was [Music] is [Music] glorious [Music] amen let's just power his heavenly father lord no doubt father we're all looking forward to that day oh god lord i just couldn't help but be struck it oh god how we live as christians we live a life of a paradox as your prophet told us lord we in the flesh lord we mourn the losses that happen in our lives lord i think of even our sister lord as she's gone on to be with you father i may not have known her lord according to the flesh particularly but according to the the spirit and the holy ghost lord that's among your believers lord we i believe it was your your prophet paul lord spoke if if one part of the body grieves there's not the rest of it hurt with it oh god lord certainly we grieve according to those things oh lord we think of the different titles that our sister would have held a mother a wife a daughter a grandmother i believe maybe even a great grandmother father and we mourn according to those offices that she held but oh god in our soul there's a rejoicing to greater offices lord to know that she was a daughter of god to know that she's a member of the bride of jesus christ oh god lord and so we mourn according to the flesh o god but in our souls and our spirits we can rejoice knowing that we'll understand it all by and by father and all the different things that we go through in our lives lord lord you gave us this great promise that all things work together for good lord to them that are the called according to your purpose so father and as we've come to hear from you this evening oh god we just pray that you'd bind up the brokenhearted lord you'd heal the wounded lord lord you deliver those that are afflicted and oppressed lord you'd heal those lord that are under sickness and even spiritual sickness oh god lord for only you can do it father and it's the anointing that breaks the yoke so god we just come in the sweetness of the holy ghost right now and just brood over your people this evening lord as we open the word lord we know that only one can truly open up the word and that's you o father that tutor lord the holy ghost the comforter that's come to speak to each and every one this evening may we come with expectation to hear from you father may we each get out of the way lord and lord may you just work your miracles lord in the hearts of each one of your people oh god we thank you lord for your grace and mercy ask that you're perfect what would be done this evening lord and just as you'd be with us now as we open up your word in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen we'll just get right into the word if you would i'm going to read a couple scriptures john chapter 17. how many of you glad to be in the house of lord this evening and then if you just want to at least have it in your minds after we read here we'll go to first corinthians chapter 13. well we'll read just a little bit here we'll start at verse 11 and and we'll read on down to verse 19 and john chapter 17 and the lord said and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gave us me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now i come to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that thou should has take them out of the world but thou should has keep but that thou should has keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth amen let's just turn to first corinthians chapter 13. and we'll just read one familiar scripture there in verse 11. when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things amen let's just bow our heads one more time in a word of prayer heavenly father's now we've read your word oh god we just ask that your holy spirit oh god would just come now and reveal it to the hearts of your children this evening lord just once again we ask that you'd have your perfect will and way in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen may you may be seated now good and uh my wife gave me permission to tell this story that just happened before service here so i'm gonna tell it but uh the devil devil likes to fight in every way he can he can think of and i was kind of just kind of trying to meditate a little bit on the word and get ready for service and all of a sudden i walked out into the the kitchen and i kind of smelled a weird smell and my wife's got a my little tool box that i have sitting on the kitchen counter and she's got a hair dryer stuck to her head and the devil had the hair dryer suck in hair through the back of the hair dryer and so we spent about 20 minutes right before i tried to come to leave for service i was disassembling a hair dryer and trying to get the hair out of there by the grace of god we were able to get through there and it's just amazing you know i was thinking about it because we were doing that and had to break off a piece of the hair dryer then start taking the screws out and disassembling it because it got stuck in the little fan and uh you know we didn't want to obviously pull the hair out there and damage anything as best we could so taking there had her sit down there and i'm kind of acting like a surgeon on the on the on the hair dryer and uh we're by the grace of god got it all disassembled and took it out and the last little piece there's like a little you sisters would probably know you know more than anybody but there's usually they have like a little mesh guard on the back of the hair dryer where the air flows in to stop things from getting sucked in there well the hair had gotten sucked right through that little hole and it was kind of stuck in there so you couldn't really get it out and i didn't really want to take some metal things to cut it because i didn't want to risk cutting her hair and so we're just kind of trying to slowly gently get the hair through the hole and the lord kind of put it on my mind we should just get some oil some coconut oil and put it on there to get it like slick like and get it through there and and i and we by the grace of god we got it out of there and i was thinking about it the lord kind of quickened it to me it's like it's amazing how that tree and lounge of good and evil would try to take out the word of god take out my wife's hair but but the lord said you just put a little oil on it you know just massage a little oil into it there and uh and the lord will make it out come out right so i think a lot of times that's what we need to do right is just apply apply that token apply the holy ghost apply a little bit of that to the problem and we'll see the lord will work us right through it so and i just i told my wife i was like well if the devil is fighting that hard then it must be we must be getting ready to have a good service so i said praise the lord for that you take comfort in those things and um you know i i was uh let me just tell you where i got the inspiration here and uh just kind of listen to the message he cares do you care and maybe not taking a lot necessarily directly from that message maybe just mostly the inspiration but it kind of quickened something the lord had kind of put on my heart a few months ago and and you know as we're coming up into this right at the time of the rapture you know i we were we've been talking a lot lately about how as christians were we're coming to a place of maturity and we're called as paul said we're not called even though we're called to have the faith of little children he said if you accept you be as this have the faith of this little one you can in no wise enter the kingdom but at the same time we're also called to come up in maturity the lord is calling us to a higher place not to be caught to and fro with all the cares of the world and all the things that the world chases after and i just had this thought about sanctification and if i were to have a title i guess that would just be the title sanctification the lord really had struck it on me this particular scripture in john chapter 17 where the lord jesus says he says and for their sakes i've sanctified myself and i thought about how powerful of a of a thought that was how jesus came and he and he sanctified himself and and many times we think about that word sanctification we understand it's a compound word cleaned and set aside for service how many of you heard that we've probably heard that uh a hundred thousand times if we heard it once and and i really thought that the lord really impressed upon my heart the the second half of that you know so many times we focus sanctification we got to clean up we got to clean up we got to clean up and no doubt we have to watch those things we must continually be underneath that washing of the water by the word even the lord before he even talked about how i i've sanctified myself he said he said sanctify them through your truth and thy word is truth and by the preaching of that word the the washing power of the word sitting underneath the word as we come to service and in our daily lives meditating upon the word of god and and listening to the word and god is constantly washing us out i believe the lord with the prophet he talked about that rock box just being constantly washed out on top of the hill just bubbling and boiling out all the trash and different things in our lives and when we come to the service of the lord here at the at the church or even at home listening to a tape or something or listening to a previous message here at the church even the that water of the word is always new it's always fresh because the lord promised it would be a well springing up into eternal life of living water it's not just old dead letter it's not just a ritual and brothers and sisters we haven't come here for a ritual we haven't come here just because it's our duty to come here although it is your duty to come here but we haven't come here just to fulfill a duty many times i think we kind of get caught up the lord kind of really i thought about that term you know people get caught up in the rat race i said well there's a reason we shouldn't get caught up in the rat races because we're not racks we're eagles we're supposed to soar above those things and i think so many times because of the way the world is constructed now and everybody's running to and fro even the book of daniel said that men would do that they'd run to and fro knowledge would increase and and if we're not careful our spirits get caught up into that to where even with good intentions the things that we do in our lives maybe just become a ritualistic religion and we don't want we're not just about it's not just a religion to us this this message that we've received is not just a it's not just a religion but it is life it's not just a covering that we have i believe our brother even spoke this weekend about it's not just coming underneath the umbrella of what we call a message but it's being born into a body it's being born into an actual life that's lived out through the believer but as i was meditating on these things in the lord just impressing upon me about sanctification and and how many times we focus on oh we've got to clean up and and no doubt we all have things in our lives that we're trying to clean up there's all things in our lives many times we fall short and i believe we've even spoken before as a as brother brandon even told the story of the the one who had the i believe he had the dream where he had gone on and he's getting closer to that closer to that light and as he got closer to that light the things he thought weren't so bad became darker and darker and if you come to realize that the little things you let slip they weren't as they weren't as uh not they you thought they weren't so bad but you as you get closer to the lord you start to see you start to become to a more realization of just how holy he is of just how perfect god is and how much how much how short we fall of it when we try to do it ourselves god's called us to a higher place you know if we read if you were to read on in john chapter 17 there after that the lord jesus is constantly talking about how he would he's trying to bring us to that place where we would be even as he is with the father how i would that they be one even as we are one and i want them to have the glory that i shared with you i've shared with them that way they may be one as we are one see the lord jesus is trying to bring his bride to a place of oneness and fellowship with him to where that life that was in christ is being expressed through his people just the same not a deluded form not something a little bit less but that very same life we put everything on a pedestal out of reach the devil always puts it all out of reach oh you can't possibly reach that you can't possibly reach that but but the only bar that's been set is jesus christ and many times we're measuring ourselves against ourselves looking at one another oh if i could just live like brother matthew or if i could just live like brother david or you know maybe maybe many people look at their pastor and say oh i just wish i could live like them but i i really had you know and forgive me if i seem a little scattered it's just the way the lord deals with me sometimes and the way he brings it but i thought about the idea of leadership and i think maybe what the lord kind of got there because i know our pastor is kind of going along the lines of some of the last messages that brother branham preached and i know one of the last ones he ministered was on leadership and i started thinking you know the world has perverted that the idea of true leadership of what it means to be a real leader see everybody everybody wants a a worldly leader is someone who takes credit for all the good things and puts blame for all the bad things it's so i will take credit for all but real leadership is is see in order to be a real i i i wish i could the lord would help me to explain it the way i see it you know you can't really speak a revelation necessarily the lord's got to give it but you know in order to be a true leader you have to be a true follower first you have to be a true follower how paul could say follow me as i follow christ because there was a there was a fellowship in a leadership that he was being led by and therefore he could cause people to follow that same leading because he was never pointing to himself even our prophet the same way would say it's not me but it's him he's the one that's here he's the one doing the works if you're going to follow anybody follow the lord jesus and that's the leadership that we're looking to have the world would say oh follow me i want to do this i'm going to do this i'm going to do this that i i will see we're coming back to a garden of eden condition both sides the devil as well as the bride is coming back to a place of of where the devil began when he said i will ascend above the throne of god i'll ascend above the stars of god i'll exalt myself above all those things and meanwhile the bride of christ is becoming more and more humble more and more little in her own sight so that she can she can live in the will of her husband because that's where the bride has to live is in the will of her own husband not our own will not our own ideas i thought i remember i saw you know all the the athletic companies they always had their little campaigns and everything and i remember seeing one that just struck me you know they had nike as those the the you know just do it and all these things and i've never seen one for under armour they've had it i think they're still doing it and i remember seeing it we had been in like a shopping center and they had it plastered on all the walls and you know what it was it was a very it was it was satan's motto it said i will that was the under that's the under armour model right now is i will trying to make it up to me something you know when the going gets tough on the gridiron i will you know tackle the guy or whatever it is they're gonna do with their sports and all the things but it was i will do this i will do that i will do this and we can see the very nature of satan just brooding over the people of the world meanwhile the bride is coming to a place that's like jesus was nevertheless not my will but thought be done that's leadership that's that's true leadership is allowing him to lead see the lord jesus came he said to be an example for us to show us what we could do and if the very son of god god in flesh himself our example would say i can do nothing except the father's will shows me so then never did jesus say because i will no he said the only thing i will do is i will surrender all that i am to the will of the father and that is that is the place the bride is coming to brothers and sisters it's coming to a place of laying aside everything that you thought you wanted to be we sing that song all of my ambitions hopes and plans i surrender these into your hands but how much have we truly surrendered i want to issue a challenge to the people of god because there's got to come to a place where we are so surrendered the prophet said if he could just get one person fully in his hand not part way not a little bit of the way not a fraction of the way but sold out to god he'd shake the world and he did it through a prophet we call him william branham but there was nothing but a man that had surrendered himself that's why we don't point to the man himself because we understand the reason god could use him was because he'd come to a place of surrender he had his struggles and i love i appreciate brother branham because he would admit those things how he had to lose his wife and his daughter for disobeying god but god had to show him that the only way to fulfill the calling in his life that god had was to be totally surrendered seemed like a little thing to give into a little pressure from your mother-in-law and look what it cost him but god was teaching him a lesson i remember reading on the life story and all the different books that you know when they talk about the stories and brother branham talked when he went to south africa and they had the agenda laid out for him and the lord said go here and all the minister brethren come to pressure him brethren the ones that are sponsoring him and they say oh but we've already scheduled this and this and this and this and see and you and we put ourselves in those shoes oh surely if i had an angel of the lord visiting me i would have just turned my back on those guys and went but you don't know the pressure that he's under you could you imagine being you're a small town what you call in his own eyes he was a nobody he said he was uneducated and yet he's got all these ministers trying to push him and push him and push him all these push and pull and then the angel says go ahead but you're going to suffer and he suffered but why god's teaching him and god see we get ourselves into our own situations and our own problems we suffer we suffer trials and tribulations we get spanked we get beat down sometimes it isn't always because of disobedience don't get me wrong remember blessings are not a surefire sign of god's approval and tribulations are not a sure-fire sign of god's disapproval so remember there's balance you go one side or the other someone will go out of here say bless god i must be doing okay i'm just right on track that doesn't mean that we better be watching up with this word the word is the ultimate line but see the lord is trying to get us to a place where we are so surrendered so totally gone from our own thoughts and ideas that his words he can't trust he can't trust his power his his virtue to someone who would wield it brother branham said his power without character is satanic so if we want to come to a place where we can say all i want to do in the greater works oh we want to do this and see this happen we must be fully surrendered to him and i thought about this as as jesus said i sanctify myself for their sakes oh what an example for the people of god how we ought to be underneath that word cleansing ourselves and then on top of that setting ourselves aside for service to the lord and not just for our own sake remember this the thought that just has been really pressing is it what is eternal life it's living for others what is eternal life it's living for others and and where so many we live for ourselves in so many things i'm just issuing a challenge this isn't meant to to beat anybody down this isn't meant to bring anybody under condemnation but if there is conviction praise the lord for conviction but i we're in such a selfish age everybody wants what they want i want my rights i want this i want that i have a right to this and i have a right to that but we've got to lay that down god wants to see us i believe he said paul said look not unto your own things but under the things of others and he wasn't talking about always looking oh wow brother david's got a new truck i sure want that truck no that's not that's not he's not talking about that he's talking about with care about about being watchful being a watchman being being careful to watch over your brothers and sisters is in a protective manner in a caring manner in a in a you know the way the lord looked after his people the way of the lord is always on the guard ready to to get down and attack that devil when he gets on a brother or sister but we get we get selfish it's easy to do that's why the lord really put the scripture on my heart in in first corinthians said when i was a child i thought as a child i speak as a child i acted as a child that's my toy that's my thing i want this and we see that amongst people sometimes oh i want i want that ministry or i want to do this job and it looks good maybe that maybe in their in their minds they've got good intentions oh because i want to do something for the lord but you have to do what the lord's got for you to do david had his good intentions he said i want to build a temple unto the lord and and i believe it was nathan said that's a good idea but it's not for you to do i i love it because just because the lord put something in it may not be for you doesn't mean it's wrong it just might not be for you to do maybe the lord's given it to you to inspire someone else and i loved what is david's response david didn't kick his feet and say well bless god i'm the king so i should be able to do whatever i want what did he say he said no he said if i can't do it i'm going to put my shoulder to the wheel and do everything i can do to help the one that will he won't even think about building our new church here not everyone's going to be driving nail not everyone's going to be there cutting wood or putting shingles on but if you can't do any of those things the very least we could do is pray for the cause the very least we could do when brother brahm called blocking for the one with the ball get that on your knees get out there spiritually and say lord i've heard my pastor talking about those guys with the permits and everything lord soften the hearts lord remove every obstacle why because god's in control but i thought about as i'm listening to that message he cares to you care brother branham said something a number of times through that message he says god cares but he first he wants to see that you care first and many times we sit back and say lord if you care well you just do something and the lord says well if you don't care enough to do a little something well then maybe you don't really care and it's not that you save yourself but see remember the lord's working on both ends you say oh well the christian going to church and everything going to a church doesn't make you a christian no that's true but a christian goes to church you know doing the works of god just doing the natural work doesn't make you a christian because if that was the case there's a lot of people out there that have us all beat brother bran talked about the kind old priests those pharisees who was always there for you looks good on the outside no but a christian will do those things i believe the last time we ministered we talked about that boogie man the devil's always putting the scarecrows out there the scarecrows are to help us to rejoice because it proves that the real is out there to be had and when the devil puts a scarecrow out they said bless the lord there must be something in that field that the devil don't want me to get because he's putting all these fakes out there trying to run me away from it well what's the thing about a scarecrow he ain't got no life to him he can't move he's stuck but we've got we've got to get to a place where that nature where we've dissolved our our own nature our own desires and all these things just let the lord come in and just take complete control he said i sanctify myself for their sakes you know we we look at things so many times and hey i'm guilty i look at my life and say lord woe is me i'm fighting this and i'm fighting that and i'm struggling here and my face feels sore because i've face planted on it so many times but you know you know the ultimate motivation you'll find is when you know i found this out you know when i got married and the lord hasn't blessed us with children yet but by the grace of god we know they're coming but even just being married you find out you have different priorities you know it used to be i go to work you know if i didn't feel good oh well i don't care i just won't go to work today because it's only me i got to worry about i can live off of spaghetti for another two months i don't you know it doesn't bother me but now that i got a wife she didn't want to eat spaghetti for a month and a half straight like i did before she she wants to at least to get a nice turkey sandwich in there sometimes you know so your priorities become different what happens you start to learn that the life that you're living isn't just for you anymore that life that you're you're living that when i go to work i'm not going to work just because of myself i'm going there because i have responsibilities now you know as a christian as we're maturing you know what is that that's called being more mature you know i i was young i was working different jobs all by myself i could you know do whatever he wanted to do quit that job move on to another one do this do that i think before the lord blessed me with what i have to either work like 15 different jobs you know trying to find what i wanted to do couldn't find nothing either they didn't like me well enough or i didn't like them well enough and i would move on and the lord blessed me to have those but it was immaturity many times because he just well i don't want to do this anymore so i'm going to do something else but then once you once you get to a place where i got responsibilities i've got to come up a little higher i'm not some i'm not i'm not the only one depending on this anymore i've got someone else that i'm looking out for and that's what is that it's growing up that's becoming more mature it's realizing that your life doesn't affect just you and when you become married to christ your life doesn't affect just you anymore your life affects you look around just look i want you to take a look around at this building right now this isn't even everyone that goes your life affects every single person in here you're not living for yourself anymore whether you realize it or not your life affects every one of us someone's healing could be hindered or helped by your attitude towards the word of god someone's deliverance that they've been waiting years for could be hindered or helped by your attitude and the way you're living your life and the way you come into the presence of god because god doesn't play games maybe times we've got a little too comfortable was saying we're the bride well that we'll see the bride of christ even esther when she went before the king she went down and she touched the golden scepter and she said oh lord you know what you whatever you want if you just let me have this but she went with reference and respect and we ought to come to the house of god with reference with respect with expectation we come knowing who we are but also knowing who he is the king of kings the lord of lords the lord of glory be out we sing these songs he is the lord of glory he is the great i am do we have a real comprehension a revelation of what that is the very god of heaven is here right now and he can touch you where you sit if you can accept it if we could get into that atmosphere and you know he'll do it probably many times right when you're not expecting it right when you go out of your way maybe to pray for your brother or sister the lord will come by your way why because it pleases him when he sees his children living for each other look not unto the things of yourselves but look each one to the things of one another what does my brother have need of you know you could be in tune with the things of god that way you could see a brother or sister downtrodden fighting come in here and pray the lord we know brother branham taught that because he tell the people you put your hand one on another and don't pray for yourself you pray for one another why that's eternal life [Music] he wants us to depend fully on him if we were you know we're part of a body he wants us to be completely dependent on him we had we heard the brother preach the other the other morning mastering the thought of human ability it ain't based on how well i can preach because if i was well we're all doomed right now because i know i can't do anything i know enough about myself to know that i'm just dust to dust in this flesh but by the grace of god he he he put a gift to maybe get a little bit out of the way and you can pull on the gift that god can work we believe in a five-fold ministry but we also believe in the ministry of the body one to another there's such a balance to all of it see because god doesn't want us just to depend solely if every if all my hopes always hinge when brother matthew would preach because i just liked the way he preached and i always felt like i got so much under that and that may be true but if i hinder my hopes on that well then that becomes an idol to me but if we could just get ourselves out of the way see getting out of the way isn't just isn't just exclusive to the minister it's to the people of god to receive what god's got for them i hope this is okay i want to see i want to see the p see the the people of god are overcomers you may not even know it yet but you're an overcomer you may not see it yet but you're an overcomer why because that seed that's in you has already overcome he said fear not little i've already overcome the world that's just not it just hasn't you haven't seen it yet it's stamped in the mail it's already sealed it's about to be it's being delivered right now it's kind of a double meaning it's going to be delivered and you'll get to deliver it's coming it's here god's waiting on us he wants we have to be more sincere that's another thing i heard brother branham speak in that message he cares that you care he talked about it so he said we've got there's got to be more sincerity there's got to be a deeper sincerity and i believe there is a lot of sincerity here we know that but in each one of our lives let's just check it up a little more because god's calling us how many of you want more of god how many of you want to see god live in your life more well then you know what our prophet said about that if you have a hunger it shows that there's more of it for you and you couldn't hunger for it if it wasn't there so that ought to give us encouragement that only give us more of a desire to get down and say lord reveal to me what i have need of lord how can i sanctify myself lord how can i cleanse myself up and then on the other hand the one part i really want to think about is how can i set myself aside for your service that's what the thought really struck me is setting yourself remember clean and set aside for service many of us have been cleaned we've been cleansed but now our vessels are so busy running about doing this and that god wants to go reach on the shelf for you but you're off doing something else he wants us to be set aside for his service the lord jesus said i do nothing except the father show me first now that doesn't mean we all have to be seeing the visions and all these things but if i could maybe say it this way we always want to set our desires on the sideline so that any moment the master calls we would avail ourselves to him for what he wants done in that moment you think about the prophet how when he was waiting for that plane to memphis i believe if i remember right he didn't even he didn't even see a vision he just heard a voice he said just go this way and so you think there wasn't a battle there with his natural desires knowing that the plane was waiting it was going to leave but what did he do he followed the voice that still small voice and many times what is that with all those things i just said well lord i don't know but i'm just going to trust i'm going to follow i'm going to go with this leading and i'm going to go and we know that the lord held the plane but it wouldn't have been any more miraculous if he wouldn't have held the plane many times he rejoiced about the plane i rejoiced about the fact that god heard the need of one of his daughters and came on the scene and the side effect the lord said you know just to prove that i'm god of all things i'll even hold the plane for you you know i remember i went out and i i was up in ohio and i was i ministered for a brother up there this is probably last year a year and a half probably had to be a year and a half ago i don't know if it was during all the coven things or not i can't remember now time is so strange after the covid things you know but i remember afterwards i just felt led to go up and talk to my my grandfather who lives up there in michigan because i was flying out of detroit and i just felt led i had a i just felt led to really talk to him about the lord and he's a christian uh maybe more nominally but he believes in the lord i think he came out of the catholic church years and years and years ago and understands a lot with that but maybe just hasn't you know come up come up a little higher you know and i just really felt impressed like lord i got it i have to at least tell about the baptism and tell about tell them about a prophet that came to this age and at least just just show a little bit because i've maybe mentioned it before but never had a chance to really sit down with him because i don't live anywhere near him or anything and i happen to have one of the the baptismal tracks that the voice of god gives out i had him with me and i just felt such a pulling to go and we talked and i'm sitting there looking at my watch get my flight leaving in about an hour flight leaves in about 45 minutes and i'm like i ain't gonna make it but something just pulled me like i got to stay there and you know what the lord didn't hold my flight i had to catch another one but i tell you one thing the lord allowed me to change my flight without any extra costs i still made it home that night and you know what the lord put a piece on my heart to know that i did what he put on my heart to do to to minister the word to someone that needs it and you know that's as simple as it is for the people of god we want everything just to be always raped you know the lord made the lord maybe you'll let the flight you miss the flight just to test you to see what your attitude is you remember jonah think about jonah how even after all he went through coming out of the belly of the whale preaching to nineveh people repenting putting sackcloth on their animals and then he goes and pouts underneath the tree because he just got an attitude and that's sometimes the lord wants to see are you going to have a jonah attitude after i led you this way and showed you these things lord help us not to maybe have that attitude when sometimes maybe we suffer a little bit for the cause of christ like missing a flight or doing something else or maybe they you get rejected when you try to minister the word but you don't know what that seed is going to bring one planet another on water but god gives the increase i don't care who who reaps it as long as they make it and lord if you let me be part of the process praise the lord i counted a privilege in an hour just to be there a part of that to say that i put my shoulder to the wheel we've got all these expectations of how we think things ought to be oh lord we it should be this way and it should be that way you know we'll understand it better by and by maybe there are sometimes you were right maybe it should have been this way but something messed up here messed up there we don't know but you know what as long as we press towards that mark of the high calling as long as you're fixing your eyes on him like lord help us just to become real mature level just nothing can sway us anchored in the anchored in the rock the waves are going to come and go but let us just be anchored down deep in that to know that he's in total control you know the world it's it's full we were talking about that that perverted i'm just going to close here in a minute i don't want to hold us very long this evening i you know the world has that perverted idea of leadership of what real leadership is and they want this person and their remember brother branham said they're going to get it they want their superman they're going to get him it's going to be everything they want him to be you know they've got this perverted idea of leadership it's really interesting because brother branham told us he said everyone is following something all these people that want to act like they're leaders you know i i just think it out the lord you know the lord just gives you thoughts and you just start to meditate down a little bit and it just kind of branches off here and branches out there and he shows you little things and i thought about you know i don't deal with any of these things in particular but i know you know and i know brother matthews hit on these things before and praise the lord he has you know you talk about the tick tocks and the twitters and all these different things and i just thought about it what are they all obsessed with obsessed with they want to get more followers they want to get more followers and more followers and these people one and it was just like it's the same spirit brother brain i'm hammered when he had to tell the people about the the the president's wife and how she cut your hair one way and pretty soon the whole nation's caught up in it they all think they got an original idea but really they're just following they all think they're original and they're just following and they don't even know that that person that they were following that thought they were original was getting what they were following was the spirit of the devil and it's the same way today all these people on these social media platforms and everything trying to that's what they call them right as influencers trying to influence what that i want you to think about it next time you go to look at your tick tocks or your twitters and these influencers that are trying to tell you something they're being influenced by something they call themselves influencers but they're just a channel to influence you straight from the pit of hell they used to do it through tv i remember growing up and they on the tv shows one woman on the tv show would cut her hair a certain way pretty soon the whole country's cutting their hair that way same thing at brother branham's saying same thing in this day same spirits just different methods of operation it's time we matured as christians and realize the filth of that stuff realize what it is it's nothing but the devil try to use the devil's tools against him i think not just better to leave it alone i tell you what hey you you be convicted the way the lord convicts you i just tell you what the lord convicts me you know but that but that's what it is right they call themselves influencers they they they get all these millions of they call them followers and they think they're leaders and they're all they're doing is leading people straight down the pit of hell right on a one-way highway right there because everybody thinks that they've got these unique ideas oh look at the way i can do this and the way i can do this there's nothing new under the sun i mean goodness even i haven't even lord i'm only i'll be 38 this year i'm getting you know getting close to that 40 mark and i'm even amazed at how even since i've been alive fashions have rotated in circles already i mean when i was growing up when i was in high school i remember all the girls they started wearing the bell-bottom jeans again and i was like i know that was just like 30 years ago and if the lord were to tarry another 30 years we'll see it again why because the devil doesn't have any new tricks he doesn't have anything new but the word of god is fresh and new to his people every day the lord can satisfy you the lord can bring into a place where you don't have no thirst for that garbage we hunger we try to satisfy things with worldly things we work ourselves to the bone in our natural jobs when the lord wants us to work for his kingdom what kind of kingdoms are we trying to build i want lord if the lord would help me my my prayer i i can't even remember where i heard this now but i i i heard someone say it somewhere but you may be able to find the quote it's not a brother branham quote specifically but it was just a really i love the thought of how if if the actions that you take every day ought to have eternal consequences when we do something what are we doing it for are we trying to progress the kingdom of god or are we trying to progress our own kingdom and that brought me right to the thought where brother branagh was telling the story of the man he said everything you talk about the man was hogs because he rode rose hogs he said everything you talk about was hogs and hogs this and hogs that and oh i got the hogs today and this over here he says there's more life than hogs and i've caught myself you get caught up in either politics or work or family matters or all these different things there's more to life than that life is jesus christ life is this word life is living for others you won't fulfill yourself building yourself a natural kingdom you will not fulfill yourself you will be empty i don't care how much education you get someone's going to be smarter than you i don't care how much money you get someone's going to have more than you who care how much wealth or favor whatever it is you can get naturally there's always going to be more and it will not fulfill specifically for you young people because that is the message that all of these influencers are spreading get more get more do this be this do this it's that same spirit of what i said that under armor free i will i will do this i will become this i will get this i will do this i will become this i want to be what he wants me to be i'm tired i'm tired of brother randy if i could say i'm tired of randall verton i want randall verton to be gone totally gone i'm tired of him i look in the mirror he's losing more hair and then the hair that's going away is turning gray on the beard you know and it just go you know you know you look at yourself and you know you're always your own worst critic even when it comes to the natural things you look at yourself and yep yep i knew that right i was two millimeters lower than the left one i'm lopsided you know and what is it because the devil's trying to get you to focus on all the natural things this body's about ready to be dissolved anyway it's in a current state of dissolving it's in a steady decline it is it's happening get used to it so quit trying to pamper it so perfectly we work we get so caught up in all these things oh i want to look a certain way i want to do this and i want to do that it's like lord spiritually let me look up let me look the way you want me to look lord when i can look in this mirror of your word let me see let me see your reflection shining in me your character your ideas i know these things are simple but this is the challenge of the hour because as we're remember we're going back to eden and what was the temptation and eden was i will because eve said i will get that knowledge i will understand these things i will what was he doing satan said you will be his gods knowing good and evil she didn't she didn't have the revelation she already was she already was see satan tries to give you and that's why it's so simple for god hiding himself in simplicity revealing himself in the same she didn't even realize you know i believe i believe maybe one of these things because you know the devil remember brother branham said it's going right back to that where we're going back to that showdown and that you know what the devil's gonna do if you if you this revelation this super secret revelation may be part of it i don't know i'm just saying this is just what the lord put on my heart this little revelation because that's one of the things that we fight in this message because we want to know more about god people hunger for it and so what do they do to start going off in all these little paths but the simplicity of the gospel said the devil comes to eve and says you'll know good and evil if you do this but you know what i believe the bride would have would will say when she's putting that same side she says i already do know good and evil to follow the word of god is good and to do anything contrary is evil it's so simple but she already knew good and evil but she reasoned herself right out of it brother brain i might you can look it up i don't remember the exact quote i just listened to it today though and brother branham talked about that experience in the garden he said he said that reasoning he said that struggle with reason is what brought all this stuff on in the first place and that's why i have to hit that so hard so many times i just feel it in unction because look at the world around us everything is reasoning believe the science believe that that's what you hear the mantra now brother branham warned us of that i i so love this message because we're seeing modern defense made clear by prophecy we are watching it come to pass people thought he was nuts if i can say i'm forgiving for saying that that way but that's just the way it is they thought he was insane science this and science that and science this and science that and you watch the news for a half hour i see it at work because they always had the tvs with news on her i hear different things that's all they hit science science science if you don't believe the science you've got to believe the science this and science inside they it's their god they're going to get their scientific superman they're leading right up we can see it why because we had a prophet who thus saith the lord told us these things would come to pass and we're watching it happen that's why i could say like brother brandon said you can't you can't tell me i've already seen too much now you can't you can't tell me otherwise now i've seen too much i have it's been revealed that's revelation right revelation faith is a revelation faith is sight spiritual sight that's how you see the spiritual things is by faith and faith can only be given by revelation lord help our unbelief lord help raise our faith lord give us a give us a higher portion of faith help us to have the faith to know that he's in total control we can lay these things aside not worry what tomorrow holds put it into his hands sanctify ourselves for each other's sake just like our lord told us not just for our own sakes although it is freed or sick too but for one another living one for another i hope that's okay let's just all stand i'm not gonna hold you any longer than that i i just want to issue that challenge to us all you know we're we're coming to that place i believe it i see it i truly do i i believe the lord is bringing us to these places you know he's bringing us closer and closer together all these trials that we're going through you know the different things that everybody's maybe fighting and trials and tribulations we're going through they just draw us closer they just draw us closer you know i i had i don't know about anybody else that was here on sunday night but i had a wonderful time when the power was out you know all the creature comforts that we get used to and you know what it was it was just like i thought i was just like man this is almost like a little preview of what the squeeze might be like when we're all hiding out in a house somewhere and still praising the lord with no power i don't know what it's going to be like but i just said lord lord we know we don't need all these natural things we just need the spirit of god the spirit of the living god the holy ghost the word and his living through his people amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father lord we're just longing lord jesus for that day lord will we meet you in the arrow father lord the trials and tribulations that we go through lord they can't even begin to be compared lord with the glory that will be revealed in us lord these light afflictions lord and in the moment they seem so big just like jonah in the in the belly of the whale many times we look around and all we see is our situation our circumstance but lord we had a prophet who came and we have a word that declares that the word of god will overcome the devil any place any time and under any condition lord because you promised it to us lord jesus we're resting on the promises lord we can't rest on anything else lord you said heaven and earth would pass away but your word would never fail lord it's that it's that hope and that faith lord in a resurrection as we see loved ones go on lord as we see different ones that are that we love that may be astray in the world but lord we've sent the holy ghost after him lord lord we send our prayers after him father lord and even as we maybe spoke a little tonight lord we sanctify ourselves lord for their sakes lord so that there wouldn't be any hindrance in our lives nor that there wouldn't be any hindrance in the body of christ but lord that all the channels would be open lord for you to work through lord may you forgive us of all of our iniquities father all of our shortcomings all the things that we struggle with oh god you know the hearts of your people you know the cries of your people lord i believe our brother even prayed this this evening earlier that lord even before you called lord before we even called or even prayed things lord you already knew what they were but lord as i heard your prophet say today listening to the message father lord that you care for us father so much but lord you also want to see that we care lord may you give us a deeper sincerity lord may you take away any blinders lord of things that lord if we're short-sighted looking at things that are around us maybe our jobs or circumstances and families or you know different situations that we come into father how the devil tries to set up build up these walls around us so we can't see the truth of your gospel but lord i believe if you would just take us lord with the wings of your word and just lift us above all those things father we're eagles that can fly above all the the hindrances all the blockades of the enemy lord give us that spiritual insight lord that revelational god to see lord that have the faith of abraham lord to know that once the promise was given the work was already done lord you said it was finished at calvary lord we believe it father lord help our unbelief lord help us o god grant us a greater measure of faith lord grant us a greater measure of divine love and holy the holy spirit shed abroad in our hearts lord lord anoint our hearts lord with oil lord god break up the fallow ground o god lord we love you so much father we know that your word is true we know lord god that all things are working together for the good of them that are the called according to your purpose father right now even lord you're working lord we may not see it naturally but we know it because you promised it we rest in that father lord we have no other resting place lord faith lord has no other resting place but your word and we anchor it right now in the in the word of the lord knowing oh god that you cannot lie we love you lord jesus may we just go from this place lord encouraged lord may we take these things as a challenge oh god to come up higher lord help us not to be selfish lord in anything that we do or say or think or act o god but help us to truly live one for another lord we would find the real fulfillment lord to to live one for the other lord to have that true eternal life oh god laying down our lives one for another preferring one before the other humbling ourselves before another we just commit these things to you father and ask that you would be with us as we each go our separate ways father may you anoint your people oh god as we go out into the world lord to jobs and to school and to different places of business and work and shopping and all the different things that we have to do oh god may our lights shine brightly lord may our lamps be trimmed may we be just full of oil oh god may we be set of fire by the holy ghost oh god to shine in the world lord no matter what the trivial tribulations and trials may be lord no matter the rejections or the reproach thor that we have to bear and then we just counted all joy we just committed to you right now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen just have our brother billy come and lead us in a song let's just sing this [Music] i'll go [Music] the way [Music] i'll go with them through the garden [Music] oh i go with him with him all the way where he lives [Music] will follow [Music] [Music] i'll go with him with him [Music] all the way i'm going all the way i will not rest until i see he's shining face on us with [Music] oh god i know [Music] [Music] i want to do my best [Music] oh is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i am going all the way [Music] i'm [Music] is [Music] amen [Music] [Music] you know living for others the gift of god is eternal life just think what it is that you possess that god gave you eternal life and he just simply said it was freely given freely give you want to live for others impart the life that you have in them the eternal life that you have pass it on amen we're especially this week keeping brother tim pruitt in the family in prayer sister karen has gone on to be with the lord and and she possessed that eternal life her spirit bore witness to it that there was something that lived inside her and she showed it every day by that just steady life that just lived a real servant to her husband and her children her grandchildren and to the church and now she's not in this realm anymore but the hope that lies within us is a hope for that other life that other world that the life that it's in us belongs there how many are realizing it don't belong here anymore amen so as our brother encouraged us tonight let's let that light shine let's share and give what we possess give it away amen it was freely given to us freely give i don't want to give people all the problems i have or all the doubts i have and all the mental battles i have that's not what i'm trying to share with the world i'm sharing the gift that god gave me the thing that's going to transport me from this world to the next so leave those things that are behind behind and press for that holler calling so let us pray tonight our father our hearts go out to our brother he's lost his queen the one that so adjourned with him from just a boy preacher to the ministry known around the world she stood there they ministered to thousands of souls how many youth were served and she was just a strength there all the time father a part of us has gone on and we know we have this comfort because you live we live also and lord we just ask that you comfort each one i know their comfort is in the fact that we'll meet again so we don't sorrow as the world sorrows we sorrow but we don't sorrow the way they sorrow without no hope and so father there's no tribute that could really be given to our sister and the part that she played in the universal body but father we'll see it that day when that crown is so full of jewels that that quiet simple life possess so much of you or we don't have words but what we do have father is our brother so gallantly preached we have the possession of eternal life and quickening power and father may we light that candle and set it on the hilltop may we share it may we be convinced so that we're concerned bless us this week father we pray bless the people as they go in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen god bless you tonight [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
