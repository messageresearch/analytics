[16:01] How thankful we are to be here. Let's
[16:03] just go to him. Heavenly Father, we have
[16:07] to encourage our hearts, Lord, sometimes
[16:09] and remind ourselves how great you are,
[16:12] Father. Lord, there's many things that
[16:16] try to exalt themselves, Lord, many
[16:19] times just in our own mind, our own
[16:21] cares, our own worries, our own fears,
[16:24] Father. But truly, you're the great one,
[16:28] Lord. And you're so mindful of us, as
[16:30] our brother Billy said, you've drawn us
[16:32] once again to this place. And Lord, as
[16:35] we would put a marker and just mark a
[16:37] year that's complete, it's been nothing
[16:39] but your grace that has seen us through.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Father, I ask even just my own heart in
[16:46] dieting the matter. Lord, where I have
[16:49] not exalted you as the one who's great
[16:51] above all my cares, all my wants, and
[16:53] all my worries. Lord, forgive me. And
[16:56] Lord, as I look forward, I want to give
[16:57] you the first place and the preeminence,
[16:59] Lord.
[17:00] each one that's gathered here tonight,
[17:02] Father, we're gathering to give you the
[17:05] first place, Lord. So now, as we've
[17:08] come, each one bringing a lick of fire
[17:09] and faith, Lord, may you come and Lord,
[17:12] sit upon the thrones of our heart. We
[17:14] worship you, Lord. And we call you the
[17:16] worthy one, Father, for truly you're
[17:19] worthy of all our praise, all our
[17:20] adoration, all the glory, all the
[17:23] thanksgiving for all the great things
[17:25] you've done, continue to do, and will
[17:27] do, Lord. And we want to just the needs
[17:29] that are represented now, commit them to
[17:31] you, Father, that we could come into one
[17:34] mind, one accord now. That you would
[17:36] have your will and way in this service
[17:39] that everything would be done pleasing
[17:41] to you. Each song that is sung, each
[17:43] word that is spoken, Lord, and may each
[17:46] heart see you, Father. Open our eyes
[17:48] that we could see you. We commit this
[17:51] service to you, Father. May we fall more
[17:53] in love with you. I pray in Jesus
[17:55] Christ's name we ask these things. Amen.

[26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll pass on to the baptism at
[26:22] this moment. Amen. You may be seated.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; I hope we don't make it through 26.
[26:45] Even so, come quickly, Lord Jesus.
[26:48] Amen. And brother Crisen
[26:51] uh has dedicated his life to the Lord
[26:54] and he wants to start the new year
[26:58] serving the Lord and being baptized in
[27:02] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[27:05] showing outwardly that God is working on
[27:09] the inside.
[27:11] And uh I hope that's our year is that
[27:16] God's going to work on the inside of all
[27:18] of us
[27:20] &gt;&gt; that the inward man might come alive
[27:23] this year.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; What we really are, what we've been
[27:27] predestinated to be. That we'll be a
[27:31] manifestation
[27:33] of what God's thought of his church was.
[27:37] So that's our goal. And uh so we're just
[27:41] so blessed to baptize uh uh Christian at
[27:45] this time. And so we'll open our Bibles
[27:48] and we'll read out of the book of Acts.
[27:52] And you know, uh, this is a wonderful
[27:56] sermon, uh, that was preached and and
[28:03] has he typed it down through time, all
[28:07] the scriptural promises.
[28:09] And then he said, "This same Lord that
[28:11] you
[28:13] have crucified, he's made both Lord and
[28:16] Christ." And and that's what we believe.
[28:20] It says, "Now when they heard this, they
[28:23] were pricricked in their heart and said
[28:26] unto Peter and the rest of the apostles,
[28:30] men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[28:34] Then Peter said unto them, Repent and be
[28:39] baptized every one of you in the name of
[28:43] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[28:46] sins. And ye shall receive the gift of
[28:50] the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto
[28:54] you and to your children and to all that
[28:58] are far off, even as many as our Lord
[29:02] God shall call. And the Lord has called
[29:05] brother Christian. So the word continues
[29:08] alive. And with many other words did he
[29:12] testify and exhort, saying, save
[29:15] yourself from this up towards
[29:17] generation. And they that gladly
[29:20] received his word
[29:23] were baptized. And the same day they
[29:26] were added unto them about 3,000 souls.
[29:30] And we add one more to the great kingdom
[29:33] of God this evening. That's a wonderful
[29:37] thing to do a baptism on the last day of
[29:39] the year. So God bless you,
[29:45] my precious brother. according to the
[29:48] word of God and what was spoken. Go into
[29:53] all the world, baptizing them in the
[29:56] name of the Father, the Son, and the
[29:59] Holy Ghost. Peter, with the keys to the
[30:02] kingdom, and with the revelation of the
[30:05] Godhead, he knew who that name was and
[30:09] where the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[30:12] dwelt. And for that reason and purpose
[30:16] we baptize you in the name of the Lord
[30:19] Jesus Christ.
[30:36] Amen. Amen. Aren't you glad God is still
[30:39] heading to the kingdom?
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're still looking for that
[30:42] last one. Amen. Oh, there is a blood.
[30:49] Thy cost
[30:54] that pay my way.
[30:58] Oh, and that is
[31:03] when it flows
[31:06] out from the cross.
[31:10] My sins dwell on.
[31:15] My sins for
[31:24] Christ.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, and his precious blood. Oh king,
[31:35] oh mighty dream,
[31:40] he breathe the king
[31:44] and go to stand
[31:48] in my face.
[31:52] So I come
[31:55] to tell you he's alive.
[31:59] to tell you that he
[32:09] come
[32:11] to tell
[32:15] to shout and to proclaim
[32:19] that he's coming back for you.
[32:24] There is aren't you glad there's a black
[32:27] tonight?
[32:32] Oh, and he
[32:36] Oh, and
[32:40] oh, he has the power
[32:45] to free them
[32:49] as change.
[32:53] I want
[32:57] to glory
[33:01] to cleanse my soul. Oh, and let it sl.
[33:12] Oh, I
[33:17] to make me whole.
[33:21] Oh my
[33:23] God. Oh, I
[33:33] tell you.
[33:36] Oh to the night.
[33:40] Oh every tear the father.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Oh to shout and to proclaim
[33:56] that it's coming back for you.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:03] Amen. That's a promise that he made
[34:06] &gt;&gt; that is coming back for you. Amen. You
[34:09] may be seated. Amen. We have uh quite a
[34:13] lot of specials and we'll try to get
[34:14] them as quick as possible. Amen. At this
[34:17] moment, we'll invite brother Andrew to
[34:19] just come up and man say a few words and
[34:21] then we'll jump into some specials in
[34:24] the next of the program. Amen. God bless
[34:26] you.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Good evening. God bless you all. We're
[34:34] so grateful to the Lord that we can
[34:35] assemble together and bring in the new
[34:37] year. You know, um there's a birth pain
[34:41] upon the church of the living God. You
[34:43] know, we can look back and see that 2025
[34:47] is about to be dead.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; But praise the Lord. You know, as
[34:51] Christians, you know, every experience
[34:54] with the Lord, you build and you build
[34:57] and you grow. Aren't you thankful for
[34:59] the grace of God in the development of
[35:02] character? I'm so grateful. You know,
[35:04] and you know, as I look back in 2025,
[35:08] this time last year in my heart, the
[35:11] Lord put the desire is to have the right
[35:14] vision, you know, and I believe that
[35:17] through the year when I look back, I can
[35:20] say that God spoke to us. I believe that
[35:22] it wasn't just a desire of my heart, but
[35:24] I believe it was something that God
[35:27] declared about the path forward for us,
[35:29] you know, to have the the missionary
[35:31] mindset to to have the right heart. And,
[35:34] you know, when I look back, I could see
[35:36] God's faithfulness, you know, to answer
[35:39] back to our desire and my heart's
[35:41] desire. And you know, as I was thinking
[35:45] about the service tonight, the Lord just
[35:48] put this scripture on my heart and I'll
[35:50] read this and just maybe share a couple
[35:52] of minutes. But you know, it's out of
[35:54] Matthew 25.
[35:57] Matthew 25. And if you want to turn with
[35:59] me there, it's in um Matthew 25 and 46.
[36:06] Well, we might as well read 45.
[36:11] I'll stop there.
[36:13] But the scripture says this in Matthew
[36:16] 24
[36:18] and verse
[36:20] 45
[36:22] says, "Who who then is a faithful and
[36:25] wise servant
[36:27] who has
[36:29] who his lord had made him ruler over his
[36:32] household to give them meat in due
[36:35] season.
[36:36] Blessed is that servant who the Lord
[36:39] when he cometh find him doing so doing
[36:44] you know and I think that's something
[36:45] that's on my heart you know as as we
[36:49] desire to do the will of the Lord you
[36:51] know it's my desire you know uh in 2023
[36:55] I was you know I felt like you know the
[36:58] Lord put it on my heart about when God
[37:00] come would he find faith you know and
[37:03] God has given us revelation and he's
[37:05] built and he showed us, you know, what
[37:07] the right vision is. And, you know, I
[37:10] don't want to just be a hearer and I
[37:12] don't want to just have revelation, but
[37:13] I want to be acting on the revelation.
[37:16] And so this year as as we're entering
[37:19] into a new season and no doubt God has
[37:23] touched you and you know we're all going
[37:25] through different times and there's
[37:28] things that God is doing in our season,
[37:30] you know, but like it says in
[37:32] Ecclesiastic to every time there's a
[37:35] purpose and season. Amen. And so as God
[37:38] has dealt with you and dealt with me, I
[37:41] just believe with all of my heart that
[37:43] as as God has given us this food and you
[37:47] know this wonderful message, you know, I
[37:49] want to be under expectation that I
[37:52] would be doing his will when he comes.
[37:54] And it would be something that would be
[37:57] a heart of worship, a heart of
[37:59] thanksgiving, a heart of praise. And so
[38:03] just a simple little thought, but you
[38:05] know, I want to be found doing the will
[38:07] of God.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; And so not looking over my shoulder to
[38:11] the left or to the right, but you know,
[38:14] God places something in your heart as an
[38:16] individual that he's entrusting to your
[38:19] care. Like I can't do your service and
[38:22] you can't do mine. But if we'll all do
[38:24] the will of God together, I believe
[38:26] God's program will go forward.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Lord, bless each and every one
[38:31] of you. We love you and we just trust
[38:33] that the Lord will bless you this new
[38:35] year. Amen.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Isn't that our
[38:45] heart's desire? Amen. That we may be
[38:48] found to be about our father's business.
[38:50] Amen. Whatever it is that he wants us to
[38:52] do that he places on our hearts and that
[38:55] we may certainly uh be looking for that.
[38:57] Amen. We're going to invite a couple of
[38:59] people to sing the special. Uh, Sister
[39:01] Sheila, if you could bring your special
[39:03] and right after that, Sister Hannah can
[39:05] bring hers right after. Amen. God bless
[39:07] you, man. What do we sing? Uh, we place
[39:10] you in the highest place as sister
[39:12] Sheila comes. I believe. Amen.
[39:18] We place you
[39:21] in the highest place.
[39:25] Oh, and for you
[39:30] are the great high praise.
[39:34] We place you
[39:39] high above
[39:41] all
[39:48] else.
[39:50] Oh, and we come
[39:53] to you. Oh, and in worship.
[39:59] Just sing it one more time.
[40:02] Oh, we bless you
[40:06] in the highest place.
[40:11] Oh, for you
[40:15] are the greatest.
[40:19] We place you
[40:24] high above
[40:32] all else.
[40:35] Oh, and we come
[40:38] to you

[40:44] to you.

[42:32] Aba

[42:53] John.
[43:22] Oh,
[43:28] good.
[43:34] Oh,
[43:36] we sha
[44:03] papa.
[44:06] Good.
[44:16] If you aunt
[44:39] and we shall
[45:18] I've had many tears and sorrows.
[45:24] I've had questions
[45:27] for tomorrow.
[45:30] Many times
[45:33] I didn't know right from wrong.
[45:40] But in every situation,
[45:44] God gave me blessed consolation
[45:49] that my trials
[45:52] only came to make me strong.
[46:01] Through it all.
[46:05] Through it all,
[46:10] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[46:14] I've learned to trust in God.
[46:20] Through it all,
[46:24] through it all,
[46:28] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[46:37] And I've been a lot of places
[46:42] and I've seen a lot of faces
[46:47] there were times
[46:49] I felt so all alone.
[46:56] But in those lonely hours,
[47:00] most precious lonely hours,
[47:05] uh Jesus lets me
[47:08] know that I'm his own.
[47:14] Through it all,
[47:19] through it all,
[47:23] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[47:27] I've learned to trust in God.
[47:32] Through it all,
[47:37] through it all,
[47:41] I learn to depend upon his word.
[47:50] So I thank God for the mountains
[47:54] and I thank him for the valleys
[47:58] and I thank him for the storms he's
[48:02] brought me through.
[48:07] For if I never had a problem,
[48:11] I wouldn't know that God could solve
[48:15] them. I wouldn't know
[48:18] what faith in God
[48:21] could do.
[48:25] Oh, through it all.
[48:29] Through it all,
[48:33] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[48:38] I've learned to trust in God.
[48:43] Through it all,
[48:47] through it all,
[48:51] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[49:00] Through it all,
[49:04] through it all,
[49:08] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[49:12] I've learned to trust in God.
[49:17] Through it all,
[49:21] through it all,
[49:25] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is our peace, is our hope, is our
[49:46] everything. Amen. We trust on him. At
[49:49] this time, we'll invite Brother Paul to
[49:51] just come and say a few words. Why don't
[49:53] we sing that song? God is so good. He's
[49:55] so good to me. Amen. I believe it's G.
[50:01] God
[50:03] is so good.
[50:09] God
[50:11] is so good.
[50:17] God
[50:19] is so good.
[50:24] So true
[50:27] to
[50:30] set my soul holy soul.
[50:40] Oh, and he set
[50:43] my spirit
[50:46] free.
[50:48] Oh, and he healed
[50:51] my broken
[50:54] heart.
[50:56] He's so good
[51:00] to you. Oh, I love him so
[51:05] I
[51:08] love him so
[51:14] I
[51:16] love him so
[51:22] I
[51:24] love him so
[51:28] he so
[51:36] God bless you.
[51:38] I believe that we love him tonight.
[51:41] Uh I didn't ex accept that uh we'll talk
[51:45] tonight
[51:48] but I believe that all along 2025
[51:53] God has been so good for us.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Uh God did a lot of thing for us.
[52:01] And from the beginning of the year,
[52:05] our pastor brother David
[52:08] preached about the path forward.
[52:13] I think that each one of us
[52:17] can
[52:19] see his life
[52:21] and find that he came from somewhere
[52:26] &gt;&gt; and is somewhere.
[52:28] is going is going in the relationship
[52:33] with God.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Uh
[52:37] I can read something in the Bible in the
[52:39] book of John chapter one.
[52:50] The Bible says,
[52:53] "In the beginning was the word, and the
[52:57] word was with God, and the word was God.
[53:02] The same was in the beginning with God.
[53:08] All things were made by him, and without
[53:10] him was not anything made that was made.
[53:15] In him
[53:17] was life.
[53:20] and life was the light of man.
[53:26] When I'm thinking about the life,
[53:31] I remember
[53:34] 11 years ago,
[53:38] one of a lovely brother,
[53:41] his sister Jida Brothers
[53:44] in France called me and asked me,
[53:47] "Brother, I feel a burden to start a
[53:49] church in Paris.
[53:53] I want you to join me and help me to
[53:56] start it.
[53:58] So I'm available to do it. So I join
[54:00] him.
[54:02] We start this church and after the first
[54:06] service
[54:09] we were thinking about the name of the
[54:12] church.
[54:14] We have three choice
[54:18] and one of them was life tabernacle
[54:27] and we thought that we pray that
[54:30] everybody will come to the church may
[54:33] have the life of Christ then we choose
[54:37] this name. So I believe that maybe
[54:41] brother David in the choice of Christian
[54:43] life tabernacle
[54:46] that about the same thing and I believe
[54:49] that for 2026
[54:52] may God help us
[54:56] to not only come to Christian life
[54:59] tabernacle but to become
[55:02] &gt;&gt; a Christian life tabernacle.
[55:05] I think that's my prayer for myself and
[55:09] for each one of us. God bless you and
[55:12] happy new year.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; God bless for the David.
[55:24] Amen. That's what we desire that his
[55:27] life may become our life. Amen. We have
[55:30] uh we're going to take the offerings. We
[55:33] have a couple of requests. you want to
[55:34] read at this time.
[55:37] Amen. Brother Adrienne Martinez is
[55:40] asking prayer for his uncle is in the ER
[55:42] with uh for a kidney surgery. Uh his
[55:46] name is uh Miguel uh uh Gammon. We
[55:50] certainly want to remember him tonight
[55:52] and just pray the Lord will touch him.
[55:54] Sister Lzette Wright u uh for my grandpa
[55:58] Mario has been battling cancer for a few
[56:02] years. He had some tests done last week
[56:05] and the doctors have said that the
[56:06] cancer is spread throughout his body.
[56:09] He's starting in chemo in January 8. Uh
[56:11] please keep him in our prayers. Amen. So
[56:14] we certainly uh want to just remember
[56:16] and keep those needs in our on our
[56:18] hearts. If you have a need upon your
[56:19] heart, why don't you just lift your hand
[56:21] up at this moment. Amen. We'll invite
[56:23] Brother David Jr. to just come and uh
[56:26] pray for this needs. Amen. The brothers
[56:27] that are taking the offerings if you
[56:29] could come.
[56:31] Let's
[56:35] just go before him.
[56:38] Heavenly Father, there's serious needs
[56:41] that have been brought before us, Lord.
[56:45] Cancer and surgery, Father. And Lord,
[56:49] you're the great physician.
[56:52] You're the Lord God that health all of
[56:54] our diseases.
[56:55] Lord, we don't have to fear cancer,
[56:58] what it could do, Lord, but it is in
[57:02] coming to you and making our petitions
[57:04] known and asking that we could receive.
[57:06] So, Father, we ask, Lord, that you would
[57:10] go and provide a healing touch
[57:12] completely, Lord. You know the purpose
[57:14] for which these things come.
[57:16] Lord, I believe it's all for your glory.
[57:19] That we could be strengthened and
[57:21] settled. That we could know you as a
[57:22] healer. Father, for you to reveal a
[57:25] loving hand that in the darkest of
[57:27] nights can lift us up, lift us up and
[57:30] give us light. So, Father, we ask that
[57:33] you'd be present to these needs. This
[57:35] ties and offering, Lord, at the end of
[57:37] the year, Father, what a fitting time
[57:40] just once again to come to you and give
[57:43] back to you, Father. little portion. All
[57:46] that we have is from you, Lord. You're
[57:48] worthy of it all. May you bless the
[57:51] portion that we give and further it for
[57:53] your kingdom. We pray. We ask these
[57:55] things in the mighty name of our Lord
[57:56] and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[58:00] God bless you.
[58:06] Go ahead and say something.
[58:08] Yeah. While they're just taking the uh
[58:12] offering up, we'll just share. You know,
[58:14] it's it's something to look back at a
[58:17] year and and appreciate everything that
[58:20] has been said. It you know, you look
[58:22] back to where you've come from, you look
[58:24] forward and you know that God's the same
[58:26] God who's been with you is going to see
[58:28] you through through another year. And uh
[58:31] one of the things that just kind of came
[58:34] upon my heart I today was a day where I
[58:37] I didn't conduct myself as the Christian
[58:40] that I would love to. The Christian life
[58:42] tabernacle this tabernacle didn't
[58:45] display the Christian life and I was
[58:47] faced with this situation and I just
[58:49] responded in a certain way and in front
[58:51] of people and it's like where's my
[58:53] testimony at? You know what where did
[58:55] this come from? from the abundance of
[58:57] the heart. The mouth speaketh and it it
[59:00] uh disquited me and it and the Lord
[59:03] started to speak to me and uh it was in
[59:07] John chapter 14
[59:10] and 26 says but the comforter which is
[59:14] the Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[59:17] in my name he will teach you all things
[59:20] and bring all things to your remembrance
[59:22] whatsoever I said unto you. Peace I
[59:26] leave with you. My peace I give unto
[59:29] you. Not as the world giveth, give I
[59:33] unto you. Let not your heart be
[59:35] troubled, neither let it be afraid. And
[59:38] I I recognized that I really wasn't
[59:42] letting the peace of God rain in my
[59:44] heart. And and it wasn't the peace of
[59:47] God that made me respond the way that I
[59:51] did. And I and we're all full of
[59:53] something.
[59:55] you're you're filling yourself up with
[59:57] something. And I and I I
[1:00:00] often when I'm weak in my body and
[1:00:02] sickness, I just become contankerous.
[1:00:05] It's that time of weakness that as my
[1:00:07] brother was saying, under pressure
[1:00:09] sometimes you just show what you're
[1:00:11] really made of. And I I find sometimes I
[1:00:15] find out I don't have what I I want to
[1:00:17] have.
[1:00:19] But I know that God's promised us peace.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And he he he's given us that. Matter of
[1:00:24] fact, I would say if when it really
[1:00:27] comes down to it, his peace he's left in
[1:00:30] your heart. And you're not going to find
[1:00:33] a peace outside of Christ.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; And and when when you find that that uh
[1:00:42] that peace is lacking,
[1:00:45] it's because we've sought peace in other
[1:00:47] things. We've allowed other things that
[1:00:50] are sinking sand, that weak link,
[1:00:52] whatever it is, that temporal piece,
[1:00:55] whatever it was that that just couldn't
[1:00:58] hold when this when the pressure
[1:00:59] mounted.
[1:01:01] Then you find out that you weren't
[1:01:03] drawing from the right source. And so my
[1:01:06] prayer just in this coming year is that
[1:01:08] I would let the peace of God rain.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; That it wouldn't be the peace of the
[1:01:12] world
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; that I'm trying to It's not my job. It's
[1:01:16] not anything that I've tried to place a
[1:01:18] a a
[1:01:20] my comfort in. I I want to renew my
[1:01:23] strength in the Lord and let the peace
[1:01:25] of God reign in my life because anything
[1:01:27] that sinking sand can be shaken. But my
[1:01:30] encouragement to you is you have his
[1:01:31] peace he's given unto you. It's a it's
[1:01:34] his promise to you and he can he'll
[1:01:37] continue to be your peace in the midst
[1:01:39] of the storm. God bless you.
[1:01:55] Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; You know the scripture said, "Here is
[1:01:58] the love of God made perfect
[1:02:02] that as he is,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; so are we
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; in this world."
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our goal, isn't it? Just to
[1:02:13] become more like him. Uh, it's exciting
[1:02:17] tonight. Uh, I believe Clever and
[1:02:20] Rebecca are in the house. Where are you
[1:02:23] hiding?
[1:02:25] Stand up.
[1:02:27] Our newlyweds.
[1:02:40] Amen. No better than having part of your
[1:02:45] honeymoon in church.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Now, that's what I call starting it out
[1:02:49] on the right foot.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So nice to have them. And
[1:02:55] also, it's nice to have uh Brother
[1:02:59] France Haw and Sister Susan with us from
[1:03:03] uh Switzerland. And brother Francois has
[1:03:08] been doing a lot of the translations
[1:03:12] uh from French uh from uh English to
[1:03:15] French and and and recording tapes and
[1:03:19] translating tapes and laying the
[1:03:21] foundation for books and been with that
[1:03:24] for many many years. And uh as he
[1:03:27] testified uh that's what brought him and
[1:03:30] his wife together. So, we're blessed to
[1:03:32] have them. And uh so, Brother Francois,
[1:03:36] we'd like to have you come and say some
[1:03:38] words to us this evening. And as we uh
[1:03:43] just dedicate this time to the Lord, you
[1:03:47] know, God's just so wonderful and he can
[1:03:51] do above even what we can ask or think.
[1:03:55] So, this year, I want to put my eyes on
[1:03:58] the above. What is it that God's doing
[1:04:02] beyond my mind?
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Give me Isab
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; that I might see.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen, my brother.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Without fear or favor,
[1:04:12] spare no flesh.
[1:04:16] Speak the truth.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; The truth shall set us free.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you, brother.
[1:04:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:30] Well, good evening.
[1:04:33] God bless you.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Where are the French speaking amongst us
[1:04:39] tonight?
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Ah, nice. Raise your hand way up high.
[1:04:47] Good. Good. Well, a a good portion of
[1:04:49] the congregation is French speaking in
[1:04:54] Franco. Welcome. you.
[1:04:58] Amen. Now, tonight I have a pulpit to
[1:05:01] preach.
[1:05:04] Yesterday it was different. It was a
[1:05:06] wedding ceremony.
[1:05:11] No pullpit.
[1:05:15] It's hard for a preacher to stand in the
[1:05:17] front of people without a pullpit.
[1:05:24] You don't know where you put your notes
[1:05:26] and your things.
[1:05:30] Amen. So, please bear with me tonight.
[1:05:32] It will be bilingual again
[1:05:38] just for a little change
[1:05:42] to break the routine
[1:05:46] routine. Amen.
[1:05:51] I'm very happy with my wife. How many
[1:05:54] people of our church do we have here?
[1:05:59] Okay. Over there.
[1:06:03] God bless you. Happy to have you. Amen.
[1:06:06] Amen. Amen.
[1:06:12] I really appreciate the support.
[1:06:19] So uh I want to bring to you the
[1:06:22] greetings for from our little church
[1:06:24] Rosanna in Switzerland.
[1:06:31] We are about 100 people and a bit more
[1:06:34] with the children.
[1:06:39] But we love the Lord Jesus with all of
[1:06:41] our heart.
[1:06:46] And I'm so happy for the the church that
[1:06:49] the Lord gave me to to minister to.
[1:06:59] And I believe that my heavenly father
[1:07:02] always gives me the best.
[1:07:08] Do you believe that also
[1:07:12] Jesus said if you are evil know how to
[1:07:15] give good things to your children
[1:07:22] how much more your heavenly father
[1:07:29] Amen.
[1:07:31] So I believe God gave me the best wife I
[1:07:33] could ever have.
[1:07:39] If I had to do it all all over again,
[1:07:43] I would I would choose the same lady
[1:07:49] because it was God's choice.
[1:07:53] God gave me the best children I could
[1:07:56] ever have.
[1:08:00] Even though a couple of them are
[1:08:07] But still I learned so much through my
[1:08:10] children
[1:08:14] and I believe God gave me the best
[1:08:16] church he could give me.
[1:08:22] I don't say it's the best church in the
[1:08:24] world.
[1:08:26] I just say it's the best church for me.
[1:08:32] I had the opportunity to preach to over
[1:08:34] 10,000 people in Congo.
[1:08:41] It was really an experience experience.
[1:08:45] I think about three balconies.
[1:08:49] I could see only the silhouettes of the
[1:08:51] people.
[1:08:54] I could only recognize a few faces in
[1:08:57] the front.
[1:09:01] But I I was telling myself,
[1:09:04] Lord, how does my brother do it to
[1:09:07] pastors so many people?
[1:09:14] I can hardly handle 100 people,
[1:09:22] but how can I handle over 10,000 people?
[1:09:27] Come on.
[1:09:30] But you know, God equips his men
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; with everything they need
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; to do the job.
[1:09:49] And I have no no envy for
[1:09:53] something else
[1:09:56] because I know my heavenly father.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; He always gives me the best.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; God gave me the best parents
[1:10:12] even though they divorced when I were
[1:10:13] three or four years old.
[1:10:18] But in God's predestination,
[1:10:23] they had to be there.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; So, how can how can I have bad thoughts
[1:10:30] about the parents God gave me?
[1:10:37] No, they had to be there the way they
[1:10:40] are, they were
[1:10:43] to bring me to this world.
[1:10:47] So, I want to be thankful, grateful for
[1:10:51] the goodness of God.
[1:10:55] Amen. Amen. I'm not going to question
[1:10:58] him.
[1:11:01] He knows what he's doing.
[1:11:03] in faith. Do you believe that?
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; My road has not been easy and your road
[1:11:15] has not been easy.
[1:11:20] But it was the best road that you and I
[1:11:23] we could walk on.
[1:11:29] God knew what it it would take to bring
[1:11:32] us to the statue of a perfect man.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; It's not an easy road
[1:11:44] and God told his prophet in French
[1:11:49] because thou has chosen the narrow road,
[1:11:53] the harder way.
[1:11:59] He didn't say the hard way.
[1:12:02] He said the harder way.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Let me confess that to you. I've gone
[1:12:09] through hard years ministering in
[1:12:11] Switzerland.
[1:12:18] Switzerland is a beautiful country,
[1:12:21] but spiritually speaking, it's hard.
[1:12:27] God's prophet came twice in Switzerland
[1:12:29] in 55
[1:12:35] I think in in May or June he was in
[1:12:38] Zurich
[1:12:40] and at the end of August last week of
[1:12:43] August he came to Loausan Switzerland
[1:12:49] he enjoyed the country he did some
[1:12:51] sightseeing visit
[1:12:55] He loved the country and at first when
[1:12:58] he was in Zurich and all the bells were
[1:13:00] ringing,
[1:13:05] he said, "Oh, this is heaven here."
[1:13:09] But when he he saw what hard time the
[1:13:13] Swiss gave Billy Graham
[1:13:17] like difficulty Billy Gra he said wow
[1:13:22] he's not so nice
[1:13:24] and he he said I was coming right behind
[1:13:26] Billy Graham in Zurich.
[1:13:32] So u he wanted to come back to
[1:13:34] Switzerland in 57 and and so on
[1:13:39] and God said don't go
[1:13:44] and he he sent another minister
[1:13:47] in hisstead you know
[1:13:50] and they really gave him a hard time
[1:13:54] he was not even allowed to pray for the
[1:13:57] sick in the meeting.
[1:14:01] So anyhow, so I was born in that country
[1:14:05] and I I labored in this country from
[1:14:09] year
[1:14:11] 1972
[1:14:18] and we try to evangelize from city to
[1:14:20] city
[1:14:23] and with hardly any result.
[1:14:29] We would put advertisements, put
[1:14:31] posters, pass out the invitations
[1:14:39] and hardly anyone would come. I was so
[1:14:41] discouraged.
[1:14:44] I told my wife, I said, "No, Jesus said
[1:14:47] no man can be a prophet in his own
[1:14:49] country.
[1:14:56] Let's go elsewhere. I don't want your
[1:15:00] being that my wife is American I said
[1:15:02] okay let's go to the states your country
[1:15:06] Americ
[1:15:10] was a little church in Ohio they didn't
[1:15:11] have any pastor
[1:15:14] but said well come here they may take
[1:15:17] you as a pastor
[1:15:25] I went there
[1:15:27] I already had my green card
[1:15:32] for a whole week. I preached my heart
[1:15:35] out.
[1:15:40] And at the end of the week came the
[1:15:42] vote.
[1:15:45] And people said, "Oh, thank you. That
[1:15:47] was a good sermon, brother."
[1:15:52] They were so happy.
[1:15:55] There was a vote and I didn't pass.
[1:16:02] What a disappointment.
[1:16:06] Another time, brother George Ferguson in
[1:16:09] Quebec.
[1:16:11] God had blessed him in the I mean it was
[1:16:14] in the in the 70s 80s in the 80s and
[1:16:18] many people were starting to believe the
[1:16:20] message in Quebec. There was a revival
[1:16:30] Brother Ferguson came to Switzerland. He
[1:16:32] met with
[1:16:46] And brother F had a small church. I had
[1:16:48] a small church. We said, "Oh, praise the
[1:16:50] Lord. This is our opportunity."
[1:16:55] And after a few weeks, Brother Ferguson
[1:16:58] changed his mind. He said, "Well, um, I
[1:17:00] will keep Montreal. I will keep Shawigan
[1:17:03] and the church in Quebec City will be
[1:17:06] for brother Fay." He said,
[1:17:14] And no more church for
[1:17:19] again. Disappointment twice the Lord
[1:17:23] shut the door in my in my face.
[1:17:31] It hurt. But you know what?
[1:17:34] I was looking for an easier way.
[1:17:40] And God said, "No, my way is the harder
[1:17:42] way."
[1:17:47] Just to encourage you. Amen.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; No. As human beings, we want the easy
[1:17:52] way.
[1:17:56] But God's way,
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; as he told his prophet,
[1:18:03] it's the harder way.
[1:18:08] So be encouraged.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; It is if it seems to you like it's
[1:18:13] getting harder and harder,
[1:18:17] it doesn't mean that God is not with
[1:18:18] you.
[1:18:21] No, he knows what is best for you. He
[1:18:24] says,
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; and then when I saw the doors closing on
[1:18:30] me,
[1:18:33] I said, Lord,
[1:18:35] not my way. your way.
[1:18:46] And you know this is what God was
[1:18:48] expecting from me.
[1:18:51] And when
[1:18:54] I changed my attitude
[1:18:57] attitude, things started to go better.
[1:19:03] God started to bring new people into the
[1:19:05] church
[1:19:09] and especially
[1:19:12] people
[1:19:14] and I bless God for my brothers and
[1:19:17] sisters
[1:19:22] now church
[1:19:24] the majority is our color people
[1:19:30] we have Seven African countries
[1:19:33] represented
[1:19:36] African represent. We have a family from
[1:19:39] the Philippines Philippine, a family
[1:19:42] from South America, Brazil,
[1:19:45] Brazil, and from Europe and
[1:19:49] so from North America and different
[1:19:52] places. So I'm blessed.
[1:19:54] Amen. I like variety.
[1:19:59] like God's bouquet, you know, beautiful
[1:20:02] flowers, different colors,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; the bouquet, the beer, the different,
[1:20:09] the bride of Jesus Christ. So,
[1:20:13] so uh greetings from our church
[1:20:19] and thank you so much for praying for
[1:20:22] sister Susan, my wife.
[1:20:26] Suzanne Monip
[1:20:28] in August of this year. She had a very
[1:20:31] big operation of cancer.
[1:20:37] It was a saroma cancer in the in the
[1:20:40] abdomen.
[1:20:44] It was a big test. Unexpected
[1:20:48] test.
[1:20:50] But what I really thank the Lord for.
[1:20:56] No, it created a move of solidarity
[1:21:04] in the local church.
[1:21:08] People started to pray like never
[1:21:10] before.
[1:21:15] Some started fasting.
[1:21:19] even a sister of the church. She she she
[1:21:21] prayed in the hospital, you know, during
[1:21:24] the whole time of the operation, four
[1:21:26] hours.
[1:21:30] There was a place where she could pray
[1:21:32] for four hours the time of the
[1:21:34] operation.
[1:21:35] Our family that was a bit scattered.
[1:21:38] They just came together around their
[1:21:41] mom.
[1:21:48] beautiful, you know, and then as the
[1:21:51] news spread around
[1:21:55] in many places, many places around the
[1:21:58] world, people were praying and praying
[1:22:00] with us.
[1:22:04] It it it vindicates what the prophet
[1:22:06] said.
[1:22:09] He said, "Sometimes we think, oh, it's
[1:22:11] nothing but divisions in the body of
[1:22:12] Christ." you know, everyone on his own.
[1:22:17] But the prophet said, "Let something
[1:22:19] happen to one of us."
[1:22:24] And we forget about about our divisions
[1:22:29] and we come together
[1:22:32] and we pray in one heart and one accord
[1:22:38] and God hears from heaven.
[1:22:43] And he answers in I said, "Lord, what a
[1:22:47] beautiful experience."
[1:22:50] I want to give God all the glory.
[1:22:54] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:22:57] Amen.
[1:23:03] For many years, I've been so discouraged
[1:23:06] by seeing all the divisions under the
[1:23:09] umbrella of the message.
[1:23:16] I said, "Lord, but you didn't send your
[1:23:18] prophet for us to be all separated
[1:23:26] like that." But you know, the bride of
[1:23:29] Christ cannot be divided.
[1:23:35] It's not because someone mentions in the
[1:23:38] name of the messenger of the hour that
[1:23:41] he is or she is a member of the bride.
[1:23:50] No, Christ cannot be divided.
[1:23:56] And there is according to the word of
[1:23:58] the hour
[1:24:02] an invisible union of the bride of
[1:24:05] Christ.
[1:24:09] I have seen it.
[1:24:11] When I travel, I meet people I've never
[1:24:14] seen before.
[1:24:20] And it doesn't take hours for us to be
[1:24:22] one heart.
[1:24:26] We have the same spirit.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; We have the same Bible.
[1:24:33] The same message of the hour,
[1:24:36] the same respect to say only what the
[1:24:38] tape say.
[1:24:42] We don't need to argue who is right, who
[1:24:44] is wrong.
[1:24:48] It seems like we have always been
[1:24:50] together.
[1:24:53] This is God's work.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; I've tried hard for years and years to
[1:24:59] bring the minister together wherever I
[1:25:02] would go.
[1:25:06] And every time I was disappointed
[1:25:10] by those ministers meetings I don't know
[1:25:12] about here.
[1:25:16] It was battleground.
[1:25:20] I mean, Bible scriptures against Bible
[1:25:23] scriptures,
[1:25:27] quote against quote. I mean, it was it
[1:25:30] was pitiful.
[1:25:32] It was a shame that us ministers would
[1:25:37] use the word of God to fight each other.
[1:25:44] Amen.
[1:25:45] Some brothers said, "Brother France, I
[1:25:47] came because I love you,
[1:25:52] but such a meeting I would never go back
[1:25:57] and it was it was painful."
[1:26:02] I said, "Lord have mercy on us.
[1:26:06] The message should bring us together.
[1:26:12] But now I have changed my my vision, my
[1:26:15] my visual. I said, Lord, whatever I see
[1:26:19] on the outside,
[1:26:22] I know your word cannot fail.
[1:26:27] There's one Christ, there's one bride,
[1:26:30] and she's one.
[1:26:35] Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; It's an invisible union, but it is real.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] And I bless the Lord for that. So coming
[1:26:45] here for the second time,
[1:26:49] I don't need to ask what do you believe?
[1:26:51] What do you believe?
[1:26:54] I feel good amongst you.
[1:26:59] I feel a kindred spirit,
[1:27:05] a welcoming spirit
[1:27:09] because the Holy Spirit is here
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; because the word has molded you like it
[1:27:14] has molded me.
[1:27:20] Praise the Lord. So, uh, just thank you
[1:27:23] for letting me open my heart a little
[1:27:25] bit.
[1:27:29] Um
[1:27:32] um our people in Switzerland really
[1:27:35] enjoyed brother Clever and Stor Rebecca,
[1:27:38] the believers in Switzerland really
[1:27:40] enjoyed watching the wedding ceremony
[1:27:47] ceremony and thank you for the tech team
[1:27:53] for making the wedding ceremony
[1:27:56] available online.
[1:28:02] Amen.
[1:28:04] And
[1:28:06] thank you, Pastor David, for your kind
[1:28:08] invitation to perform the wedding
[1:28:10] ceremony.
[1:28:18] Marage, brother Clever and Sister
[1:28:21] Rebecca, the Clever Rebecca. And on
[1:28:24] Sunday, I was so blessed by the sermon
[1:28:27] of brother Matthew.
[1:28:32] Amen. So, praise God for true ministers.
[1:28:42] One thing that he said,
[1:28:45] God takes away the wise.
[1:28:53] Human beings have so many wise.
[1:28:58] But years ago, I made a little study on
[1:29:00] the wise in the Bible.
[1:29:06] And not going into the subject,
[1:29:10] just look at your Bible.
[1:29:14] The first why that was ever mentioned in
[1:29:17] the holy scriptures,
[1:29:22] it was not a human being asking God why.
[1:29:30] It was God
[1:29:33] who asked human beings why.
[1:29:40] God had provided a beautiful garden. you
[1:29:42] have
[1:29:45] and they disobeyed God disobeyed you and
[1:29:47] God said why did you do it
[1:29:52] so I believe
[1:29:54] if we can answer God's wise
[1:29:59] God will probably answer our wise
[1:30:10] amen so praise the Lord God is
[1:30:12] wonderful. And you know, we have arrived
[1:30:16] here uh Saturday night late at midnight.
[1:30:20] So we were in church with you on Sunday.
[1:30:26] But and now it's Wednesday. So Sunday,
[1:30:29] Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, four days.
[1:30:35] You know what? I'm starting to getting
[1:30:37] attached to you.
[1:30:44] just shaking your hand,
[1:30:47] smiling at one another.
[1:30:52] It feels good.
[1:30:56] The prophet said, "I like a tangible
[1:30:58] God."
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet like to give a
[1:31:03] good handshake.
[1:31:08] So, thank you for blessing me. Merceni.
[1:31:13] So we will leave my wife and I and our
[1:31:16] daughter Elizabeth and her daughter
[1:31:18] Noelene tomorrow midday.
[1:31:31] visit, but there's so much work to do,
[1:31:32] so we have to go back.
[1:31:38] Thank you so much for being so sweet and
[1:31:40] kind to us.
[1:31:43] But you know what? One of these days,
[1:31:49] we will not say goodbye anymore.
[1:31:54] I'm looking forward to that day.
[1:32:00] Since our first visit about nine years
[1:32:02] ago, the Lord has really blessed your
[1:32:05] church. Their visit,
[1:32:11] I can see it has grown tremendously.
[1:32:15] We were still in the old building, your
[1:32:17] fellowship hall,
[1:32:22] and you have a beautiful, beautiful
[1:32:25] building.
[1:32:27] It's a dream to have such a building.
[1:32:30] Appreciate it.
[1:32:35] We have been looking for years to have
[1:32:36] another building. It's and it's it's
[1:32:39] really difficult in Switzerland.
[1:32:46] Yesterday when we went to the reception
[1:32:49] after the wedding
[1:32:53] there was it was written love is a
[1:32:57] journey.
[1:33:01] Do you believe that?
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Do you feel that you are a a traveler on
[1:33:07] this earth?
[1:33:11] So let's take the Bible now and we will
[1:33:13] readm
[1:33:15] please
[1:33:18] I don't know if you want to stretch a
[1:33:21] bit and get up for a few minutes
[1:33:28] verse 19
[1:33:36] Nehemiah 9:19
[1:33:39] NeiF enough. Yet thou in thy manifold
[1:33:43] mercies,
[1:33:45] forsookst them not in the wilderness,
[1:33:49] the pillar of the cloud departed not
[1:33:52] from them by day to lead them in the
[1:33:55] way, neither the pillar of fire by night
[1:34:00] to show them light and the way wherein
[1:34:03] they should go.
[1:34:06] Don't
[1:34:23] Lord, we pray that you bless your word
[1:34:25] for us tonight as we end year 2025 and
[1:34:29] we are just about to start 2026.
[1:34:33] for
[1:34:40] encourage us through thy word
[1:34:46] Lord. No, everything is shaking around
[1:34:49] us.
[1:34:51] But your word is stable.
[1:34:55] It is unmovable.
[1:34:58] It is our rock.
[1:35:02] Lord, encourage us once again tonight.
[1:35:07] We ask it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:11] Amen.
[1:35:13] You may be seated. Thank you.
[1:35:18] Today we just told with brother David
[1:35:21] and sister Julia bit
[1:35:25] Dallas and we went to Fort Worth, you
[1:35:27] know, and just to see the Longhorns and
[1:35:29] things like that.
[1:35:42] It was nice for the family.
[1:35:45] Then I was really tired. I caught a
[1:35:47] cold.
[1:35:52] So I just rested a little bit, you know,
[1:35:54] on the bed.
[1:35:57] But you know, I mean, there are
[1:35:58] different preachers here.
[1:36:01] You know when when um
[1:36:05] you receive an invitation to minister,
[1:36:10] you know, the inspiration starts pouring
[1:36:15] because at first I said, "No, I'm going
[1:36:17] to tell brother David I'm not feeling
[1:36:19] good. I'm weak. I'm not going to say
[1:36:22] anything tonight. Maybe just say hello
[1:36:23] and that's all.
[1:36:32] But then the inspiration was coming and
[1:36:35] just a few things came together not long
[1:36:37] but just something to live with you for
[1:36:41] the coming year.
[1:36:45] I'd like to entitle it
[1:36:50] Third Exodus organized
[1:36:55] guided tour.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Third Exodus
[1:37:01] organized
[1:37:03] guided tour.
[1:37:10] Exod
[1:37:17] we know from our prophet we are in the
[1:37:19] third exodus.
[1:37:23] So if we look at the first exodus
[1:37:28] we can learn and understand what is
[1:37:30] happening right now.
[1:37:36] So the verse we just read no
[1:37:41] is is going over what God did for them
[1:37:45] previously
[1:37:51] and he says in thy manifold mercies
[1:37:56] for sust them not in the wilderness.
[1:38:05] Can we update that? Can we bring that to
[1:38:09] today?
[1:38:12] Can we say that in 2025
[1:38:16] you here in America as in Switzerland or
[1:38:19] some of you in other countries
[1:38:27] in 2025?
[1:38:31] God has not forsaken us in the
[1:38:34] wilderness.
[1:38:38] Can you say that?
[1:38:44] If you are here tonight,
[1:38:47] it's the proof that God has not forsaken
[1:38:50] you.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; And God
[1:39:01] sent the pillar of cloud and the pillar
[1:39:04] of fire by day, by night to show us
[1:39:08] light.
[1:39:21] wherein we should go.
[1:39:24] Lord, brothers and sisters, I mean, it's
[1:39:28] hard to walk the Christian life in this
[1:39:31] world.
[1:39:36] There's so much darkness,
[1:39:40] so much perversion,
[1:39:43] so much sin.
[1:39:47] It's terrible to to look at in what
[1:39:50] shape the world is.
[1:39:55] You agree?
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; So, we need we need God's guidance.
[1:40:05] We need God to to shine his light on our
[1:40:09] path.
[1:40:14] Otherwise, we'll we'll
[1:40:17] just bang against this and that and
[1:40:19] stumble.
[1:40:24] Amen. I mean, we the in this world is so
[1:40:29] filled with traps.
[1:40:32] the
[1:40:35] to make everyone fall.
[1:40:39] But the God doesn't want his bride to
[1:40:42] fall in the traps.
[1:40:52] his light on our path.
[1:40:58] Otherwise, we we don't know where we are
[1:41:00] going.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 20.
[1:41:08] Thou gavest also thy good spirit to
[1:41:12] instruct them,
[1:41:14] and with heldest not thy mana
[1:41:20] from their mouth, and gave us them water
[1:41:24] for their thirst.
[1:41:39] Let's try to apply this verse 20 to the
[1:41:43] end of 2025 and the beginning of 2026.
[1:41:49] Thou gave us thy good spirit to instruct
[1:41:53] them or to make them wise.
[1:42:01] God is just one spirit.
[1:42:04] It is called the Holy Spirit.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; So can we say in 2025 God gave us his
[1:42:15] holy spirit.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; What would we do without the Holy
[1:42:23] Spirit?
[1:42:26] Think about it.
[1:42:35] and will withheld us not a mana
[1:42:40] from their mouth.
[1:42:43] What manner is he speaking about?
[1:42:48] I believe he's speaking about the hidden
[1:42:50] mana.
[1:42:53] Do you know what it is?
[1:42:57] I believe it is the stored up spiritual
[1:43:01] food on the tapes.
[1:43:19] Have you listened to those tapes?
[1:43:23] How many have listen to the tapes?
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed.
[1:43:28] Amen. The prophet said, "Listen to these
[1:43:32] tapes in the cool of your room."
[1:43:37] And nothing wrong with listening to
[1:43:39] tapes in church.
[1:43:43] The prophet spoke about that as well.
[1:43:45] The prophet.
[1:43:48] So brothers and sisters in this time of
[1:43:51] spiritual famine,
[1:43:55] God has provided for you and I hidden
[1:43:59] mana.
[1:44:06] And I thank God for that.
[1:44:10] There's no other spiritual food
[1:44:13] available today
[1:44:18] for you and I
[1:44:21] to strengthen us
[1:44:25] spiritual vitamins
[1:44:28] to make us overcomers.
[1:44:34] No. Who will win? Which which which dog
[1:44:37] will win?
[1:44:39] the one you feed the most.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, I have some defeats, some some
[1:44:47] failures.
[1:44:52] Which dog have you been feeding?
[1:44:57] So, thank God for spiritual food
[1:45:01] available
[1:45:03] any time of the day and night.
[1:45:12] church meetings. Wonderful.
[1:45:16] We have them. You have them.
[1:45:20] But it's what? Three times a week.
[1:45:24] Okay. We also have three times a week.
[1:45:27] It's not enough.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; You need those eagles.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; To go look for that food yourself. Amen.
[1:45:41] Don't just sit and wait for someone to
[1:45:45] to feed you.
[1:45:50] You are eagles.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Fly. Look around.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Look for fresh food.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Fresh where on the tapes.
[1:46:07] Read your Bible every day.
[1:46:11] Pray. Talk with God.
[1:46:16] I mean, it's getting so so tough.
[1:46:21] Unless we do that, we will collapse
[1:46:33] and gave us them water for their thirst.
[1:46:43] What kind of water?
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; I believe living water.
[1:46:53] Did you feel that God has been
[1:46:56] regenerating you by his living water?
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; No. Water is is essential to life.
[1:47:10] If you can go without food for a few a
[1:47:13] few days, but not without water.
[1:47:17] Our
[1:47:19] bodies made with a lot of water.
[1:47:23] If you don't drink good water, you'll
[1:47:26] die.
[1:47:30] But God in the third Exodus
[1:47:35] is providing for his children living
[1:47:38] water.
[1:47:42] AND I THANK GOD FOR THAT.
[1:47:46] When we come to the end of a year, it's
[1:47:48] time to say, "Lord, thank you. Thank
[1:47:50] you. Thank you."
[1:47:55] Mercy, mercy, mercy. Amen. That's that's
[1:47:58] all I can say.
[1:48:01] I have no right to complain.
[1:48:05] I can only say, "Lord, thank you."
[1:48:09] Mercy.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, let this night be a night of
[1:48:12] thanksgiving.
[1:48:21] Verse 21.
[1:48:24] 40 years did thou sustain them in the
[1:48:28] wilderness.
[1:48:37] God has been sustaining us
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; all through 2025.
[1:48:47] you and I we don't know each other so
[1:48:50] well
[1:48:52] here here or in Australia in South
[1:48:56] America wherever
[1:49:02] God has sustained us.
[1:49:07] HE DID NOT FORSAKE US.
[1:49:11] He cannot forsake us.
[1:49:15] So let's recognize that.
[1:49:21] So they so that they lacked nothing.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; If I am
[1:49:34] in the journey of the third Exodus
[1:49:36] today,
[1:49:41] I want to confess that
[1:49:46] in 2025 I lacked nothing.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; God has provided
[1:50:01] brothers and SISTERS JUST SAY THANK YOU
[1:50:03] LORD.
[1:50:07] What can we do
[1:50:10] but say thank you?
[1:50:13] You cannot pay it back
[1:50:16] but God is expecting at least a thank
[1:50:20] you a sincere thank you
[1:50:26] not just from the lips
[1:50:30] but from your heart.
[1:50:34] Amen. If God had not kept his promise
[1:50:36] toward you,
[1:50:40] if he had not kept his covenant, his
[1:50:42] unconditional covenant,
[1:50:47] where would you be tonight?
[1:50:51] Where would I be?
[1:50:54] Where would my wife be?
[1:50:57] Where would my wife be tonight?
[1:51:01] But God has been faithful.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, their clothes wax not old, and their
[1:51:09] feet swelled not.
[1:51:16] I I want to say, Lord, what you did in
[1:51:19] the first Exodus, you are doing it right
[1:51:21] now in the third exodus.
[1:51:31] And I tell you, thank you. In Hosea
[1:51:34] 12:13,
[1:51:40] yeah,
[1:51:46] and by a prophet, the Lord brought
[1:51:49] Israel out of Egypt.
[1:51:55] Israel
[1:51:56] and by a prophet was he preserved.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Did God fulfill that for you?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The third exodus is coming out of
[1:52:14] denominations,
[1:52:16] the world and denominations
[1:52:22] and to go into the rapture.
[1:52:26] But but who has been leading us?
[1:52:31] Not just a man.
[1:52:34] Said the prophet of this day is the Lord
[1:52:37] Jesus Christ.
[1:52:42] Yes. Veiling himself in a man. William
[1:52:44] Brham.
[1:52:46] William.
[1:52:50] It's through this message that we were
[1:52:52] set free of men's organizations.
[1:53:00] Amen.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; And by a prophet we have been preserved.
[1:53:11] in the message countdown September 62.
[1:53:19] Oh, but the church glory she's spreading
[1:53:23] some fire too. Amen. The countdown is
[1:53:27] coming. Amen. Justification,
[1:53:30] sanctification. Paragraph 113. Baptism
[1:53:33] of the Holy Ghost. Laudy churches. We
[1:53:37] are at the end. Jesus Christ the same
[1:53:41] yesterday, today, and forever. What's
[1:53:43] the matter? 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 zero.
[1:53:50] They won't be crying, but they'll be
[1:53:53] singing and shouting and praising God as
[1:53:56] a church takes its astronaut move into
[1:54:00] the skies to be with Jesus Christ.
[1:54:07] Oh.
[1:54:13] Amen.
[1:54:16] AMEN.
[1:54:47] AMEN.
[1:54:49] Why did I give the title to the message
[1:54:51] tonight?
[1:54:57] Third Exodus organized guided tour.
[1:55:07] How many of you know what 2026 holds for
[1:55:12] you and I?
[1:55:20] Unless God give you a revelation,
[1:55:24] none of us knows anything about 2026.
[1:55:32] Yes, we have general information in the
[1:55:34] word in the message
[1:55:40] but but specifically or precisely
[1:55:44] specific.
[1:55:47] Do you know what will happen in January
[1:55:49] or in March or in September 2026?
[1:55:58] I know nothing about it
[1:56:01] and sometime we fear about the future.
[1:56:08] But
[1:56:10] let me encourage you tonight.
[1:56:14] We are on a wonderful journey.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; But it's not a journey where you are
[1:56:22] trying to to find your way. Should I go
[1:56:25] here?
[1:56:34] No, it is a an organized
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; guided tour.
[1:56:46] What does it mean?
[1:56:48] Israel did not know what would be the
[1:56:50] next step,
[1:56:55] but God knew.
[1:56:59] But
[1:57:01] in the in the wilderness, BUT WHAT SHALL
[1:57:04] WE EAT?
[1:57:07] It's none of your business.
[1:57:11] But we have little children.
[1:57:14] Who will we sleep?
[1:57:18] is none of your business.
[1:57:22] It's an organized guided tour
[1:57:29] organized
[1:57:38] guided tour. Have you done that before?
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Raise your hand. Okay. So did you have
[1:57:45] to worry to say well what will I eat
[1:57:48] today
[1:57:52] at the end of the day where will I sleep
[1:57:54] sleep
[1:57:57] no you don't worry you just relax
[1:58:04] somebody has planned everything for you
[1:58:11] but if you travel on your own yes You
[1:58:14] may wonder what shall I eat? Where will
[1:58:17] I sleep?
[1:58:25] I don't know the country.
[1:58:28] What will I see? What what what will
[1:58:30] happen?
[1:58:32] But this is not the journey we are in in
[1:58:35] the third exodus.
[1:58:39] was exod.
[1:58:41] God showed that to me in the first
[1:58:43] exodus.
[1:58:46] They had to have no worry at all.
[1:58:54] Brothers and sisters, let's be true
[1:58:56] believers.
[1:58:59] Amen. Don't worry about tomorrow.
[1:59:05] Don't worry about 2026.
[1:59:10] You have been invited by the Almighty
[1:59:13] God
[1:59:17] on an organized guiding tour. the
[1:59:22] participary
[1:59:41] pastor David Mgari he's a wonderful
[1:59:44] pastor pastor but he doesn't know
[1:59:46] everything in part but the prophet
[1:59:49] preached my died.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; The prophet Mid Who is he?
[1:59:57] Let us trust him.
[2:00:01] Thank you very much.
[2:00:07] I have five minutes to to stop. I'm at
[2:00:09] the end. Be encouraged.
[2:00:15] In the seventh seal books,
[2:00:18] the prophet said that the seventh the
[2:00:22] seventh seal it was relaxing time.
[2:00:32] Let's relax.
[2:00:36] Ruth had to relax because Bose was
[2:00:42] looking after her.
[2:00:48] She had done her part.
[2:00:51] Now said, "Stay here. Don't worry. I'm
[2:00:55] doing my job."
[2:00:59] And Bose did and redeemed her.
[2:01:04] Brothers and sisters, I want to relax as
[2:01:06] much as I can
[2:01:09] because my Bose is taking care of me.
[2:01:15] Amen.
[2:01:18] So let us just be happy happy Christians
[2:01:22] you know and the um
[2:01:26] I I am 75
[2:01:30] and the older you get the more you look
[2:01:34] forward to the change of the body.
[2:01:40] But what
[2:01:43] stimulates me in my Christian walk
[2:01:48] is that there is a countdown going on.
[2:01:55] And every year that passes, every month,
[2:01:59] every week, every day that passes,
[2:02:03] an
[2:02:06] brings me closer
[2:02:09] closer
[2:02:12] of my body change.
[2:02:16] And as soon as that happens,
[2:02:20] I'm I enter into my eternal body. for
[2:02:24] eternal. I'm looking forward to it. Are
[2:02:27] you?
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; So, let us pray. Heavenly Father,
[2:02:35] just a exhortation that you put on my
[2:02:38] heart for these lovely
[2:02:41] believers.
[2:02:47] Lord, nothing to worry about concerning
[2:02:50] 2026.
[2:02:57] Lord, the third exodus we are in is an
[2:03:02] organized guided tour.
[2:03:11] You are the guide.
[2:03:14] The pillar of fire is right with us.
[2:03:18] You are protecting us.
[2:03:21] You are lighting our path.
[2:03:26] You are providing for all our needs.
[2:03:31] Lord, we are blessed people.
[2:03:35] And Lord, we just want to say with all
[2:03:38] of our heart,
[2:03:42] thank you, dear Lord. Mercy,
[2:03:47] you are so good, so wonderful.
[2:03:51] and we love you with all of our heart
[2:03:56] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[2:04:01] Amen.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I thought that was extremely
[2:04:17] nice of our brother to invite you all to
[2:04:20] Switzerland,
[2:04:22] his beautiful country. So, you all try
[2:04:24] to get over and visit them there. We
[2:04:28] think that's wonderful. I I thought when
[2:04:32] he when he said he went to minister
[2:04:35] meetings and uh they're just a battle, I
[2:04:39] I looked at Billy, he says, "That's why
[2:04:41] I don't have them."
[2:04:43] you know, and then he said, "I take he"
[2:04:45] He said, "I took they took a vote and uh
[2:04:49] they didn't uh I didn't get the vote."
[2:04:52] And I looked at Billy and I said, "Well,
[2:04:54] that's why I don't have them."
[2:04:56] So, uh you know, God is so good. So,
[2:05:02] what we're going to do is we're going to
[2:05:03] try to have communion about midnight
[2:05:06] as the world
[2:05:08] uh blows their horns and shoots their
[2:05:12] guns in the air and and uh
[2:05:17] and do do all their things because
[2:05:20] they're going into another year. We're
[2:05:22] not going into another year. We're going
[2:05:24] into eternity.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; And and like I said, this isn't a
[2:05:29] staying message. It's not a message
[2:05:31] about how to live here. It's a message
[2:05:34] about how to leave here.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; And that's what our goal is. And I
[2:05:39] thought he said an organized guided
[2:05:42] tour. The footsteps of the righteous
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; are ordered by the Lord. And if we could
[2:05:49] just have God order our footsteps this
[2:05:53] coming year, then we would know beyond a
[2:05:56] shadow of a doubt that our lives are
[2:05:59] organized
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; and guided
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; to where he wants to bring us
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; in our journey here. So, the way we're
[2:06:08] going to conduct the communion is that
[2:06:11] we're going to have you come up, take
[2:06:14] the piece of bread and your cup,
[2:06:18] and go
[2:06:19] back to your seat.
[2:06:22] And if I was bilingual, I would tell you
[2:06:25] that in French.
[2:06:28] I would tell you that in Spanish,
[2:06:32] in lingala, in Chaluba, in Swahili,
[2:06:37] in Portuguese,
[2:06:39] in Hindi, and whatever languages are
[2:06:42] spoke here. But so if the person next to
[2:06:46] you doesn't speak
[2:06:49] English, tell them,
[2:06:52] "We're going to go up. We're going to
[2:06:54] take the cup. We're going to take the
[2:06:57] bread. and we're going to go back to our
[2:06:59] seats
[2:07:01] and then we're all going to take it
[2:07:02] together.
[2:07:04] So, don't stop and take communion like
[2:07:08] we normally do.
[2:07:11] Just take it,
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; go back to your seat,
[2:07:18] and then we'll all stand and take
[2:07:20] communion. We'll read the scriptures and
[2:07:24] take communion together. So, uh, uh,
[2:07:29] well, and I guess we'll just, uh, uh,
[2:07:34] I guess we can just, I don't know,
[2:07:36] should we start at the back or come to
[2:07:38] the front or start at the front and
[2:07:42] just start at the front. The the chief
[2:07:44] organizer has spoken.
[2:07:48] You didn't know I was subject to the
[2:07:50] deacons, did you?
[2:07:53] So they they come and tell me every
[2:07:55] Sunday all the things I have to
[2:07:56] straighten out. So I just do what I'm
[2:07:59] told.
[2:08:01] So, I think what we'll do is maybe we'll
[2:08:04] have uh uh uh
[2:08:08] uh brother Pedrosa sit uh Thiago and
[2:08:12] your family maybe as you could just sing
[2:08:15] to us while we're walking and getting
[2:08:18] our our our bread and our wine. So if
[2:08:23] you'd come up and
[2:08:25] or
[2:08:28] alls my note says is familia pedrosa
[2:08:35] and I guess that means you
[2:08:40] allighty all righty as they come and
[2:08:43] they they'll sing better you guys can
[2:08:46] start uh so I guess you just go back and
[2:08:51] go around and then come out just like we
[2:08:53] normally do, but just go back to your
[2:08:55] seat. All righty. So, uh, as they sing,
[2:08:59] go ahead and come and, uh, get your, uh,
[2:09:03] uh, your, uh, your bread. So, go ahead
[2:09:07] and have start, Chris.
[2:09:10] Yeah.
[2:09:12] Yeah. Just go ahead and like you
[2:09:14] normally do and just just like you
[2:09:16] normally take communion. So, just go on
[2:09:19] back and come down the each aisle just
[2:09:21] like you normally take communion. Just
[2:09:24] go ahead and start in your lines down
[2:09:26] the down each aisle. Just like normally
[2:09:29] you take communion, but you don't take
[2:09:31] communion.
[2:09:35] I'm not a very good communicator,
[2:09:37] brother.
[2:09:39] There we go. Just like we normally take
[2:09:41] communion. And just uh go ahead and sing
[2:09:44] for us. God bless you.
[2:10:01] He say she
[2:10:05] been so
[2:10:09] if I sill
[2:10:13] the host
[2:10:25] It is the pass.
[2:10:37] Amen.
[2:10:41] Amen.
[2:10:47] Amen.
[2:10:53] Amen.
[2:10:57] Amen.
[2:11:06] Give them mercy.
[2:11:30] I see the past.
[2:11:42] Amen.
[2:11:46] Amen.
[2:11:52] Amen.
[2:11:58] Amen.
[2:12:01] Amen.
[2:12:22] preschore.
[2:12:54] Amen.
[2:13:00] Amen.
[2:13:04] Amen.
[2:13:10] Amen.
[2:13:16] Amen.
[2:13:20] Amen.
[2:13:34] It does feel
[2:13:50] feels. We feel
[2:14:00] amen.
[2:14:18] Amen.
[2:14:22] Amen.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Give sing.
[2:14:58] Are you sure?
[2:15:37] That's good.
[2:15:43] Amen. Let's all stand together.
[2:15:49] I thought as our brother exhorted us
[2:15:53] uh
[2:15:55] telling us that
[2:15:58] this should be a time of unity
[2:16:01] and
[2:16:05] the things that you unite around are the
[2:16:09] word of God.
[2:16:11] And
[2:16:13] Jesus spoke these words. He said that if
[2:16:16] you love me, you'll keep my
[2:16:19] commandments.
[2:16:21] So it was more than just the
[2:16:26] acknowledgment
[2:16:27] of his existence
[2:16:30] or the acknowledgment
[2:16:32] that he is the creator of heaven and
[2:16:35] earth.
[2:16:36] But it's a commitment in your life to
[2:16:41] obey.
[2:16:43] And obedience
[2:16:46] is always tied to sacrifice
[2:16:50] because Satan has planned his world to
[2:16:53] come into conflict with God's word.
[2:16:59] Everything in his civilization,
[2:17:02] everything in his education
[2:17:05] is to discredit God's word.
[2:17:09] And he offers a reward
[2:17:13] for disobedience,
[2:17:16] but it's a carnal reward.
[2:17:19] It's a temporary
[2:17:22] reward.
[2:17:24] But God's reward is eternal life.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; The gift of God is eternal life.
[2:17:33] And so as we
[2:17:38] take communion.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; We understand that it's one of the
[2:17:43] commandments that God requires
[2:17:47] that we take communion,
[2:17:50] we wash feet,
[2:17:52] and we're baptized.
[2:17:55] And so as you take communion
[2:18:00] and you commune with him,
[2:18:04] your communion should be, and I hope
[2:18:06] mine is tonight, Father, I haven't
[2:18:09] obeyed you the way that
[2:18:14] I should,
[2:18:16] but
[2:18:18] I'm going to rededicate
[2:18:21] my heart
[2:18:23] to your word.
[2:18:26] Our brother exhorted us to study to show
[2:18:31] yourself approved
[2:18:33] that you might know what the will of the
[2:18:37] father is
[2:18:39] because that's what we want to do. We
[2:18:41] want to do his will
[2:18:44] and please him.
[2:18:47] And so that's what communion is about.
[2:18:50] It's our outward sign that I'm obeying
[2:18:54] God's word. The thing I love so much
[2:18:58] about God's word is that he's a rewarder
[2:19:04] of them that diligently seek him.
[2:19:08] He's always a rewarder.
[2:19:11] You can never do anything for God that's
[2:19:14] not repaid to you a hundfold in this
[2:19:18] life. and the life to come.
[2:19:23] He's always so faithful
[2:19:27] and just to confess our sins, to forgive
[2:19:31] our sins, excuse me, if we'll confess
[2:19:34] them. Communion is a time of making
[2:19:39] things right and confessing your sins,
[2:19:44] confessing your unbelief. And my my
[2:19:48] prayer for my life this year is that the
[2:19:54] rapture and eternal life
[2:19:59] and heaven
[2:20:02] because I believe in heaven
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; that it becomes a greater reality to me
[2:20:08] than ever.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; I want to almost taste it. I want to
[2:20:12] smell it. I want to touch it. I want to
[2:20:15] feel it. I want to understand that every
[2:20:18] action of my life, every word that comes
[2:20:22] out of my mouth is for the purpose of my
[2:20:25] eternal destination. I want to live for
[2:20:29] the kingdom I'm going to
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; and I want to walk to that gate
[2:20:35] and enter to that city and know that I
[2:20:40] was a soldier on earth to keep that
[2:20:43] kingdom alive.
[2:20:46] that that domain of that kingdom ruled
[2:20:50] on earth in me
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; and that I'm returning home from the
[2:20:55] battlefield
[2:20:57] that I I wasn't I was a soldier when I
[2:21:01] was here. I kept the truth. I kept the
[2:21:06] banner. I stood for the king's laws. I
[2:21:10] stood for the king's name. I obeyed the
[2:21:13] king's ordinances. I lived as the king
[2:21:17] commanded me to live. And now I'm not
[2:21:21] returning defeated.
[2:21:23] I'm not returning
[2:21:26] with shame and guilt.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; But I'm returning from whence I came,
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; knowing that I let my light shine.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; I casted my vote. I stood for that
[2:21:40] kingdom on this earth. And he told me
[2:21:43] that if I would stand for him here, that
[2:21:46] he would stand for me there. Amen.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; That every choice that I make, every
[2:21:53] confession that I make of his glorious
[2:21:57] name, every time I bring myself subject
[2:22:01] unto the commandments of God's word and
[2:22:04] become a reproach and a fool in this
[2:22:08] world, that in that life
[2:22:11] I'll receive the honor. do a soldier,
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; do a prince
[2:22:18] and princesses
[2:22:20] of the kingdom
[2:22:22] of God.
[2:22:24] So let us turn in our Bibles. They would
[2:22:28] put these scriptures
[2:22:30] on the
[2:22:33] on the board Corinthians 11th chapter
[2:22:39] in the 23rd
[2:22:41] verse.
[2:22:44] And tonight we're standing here saying,
[2:22:47] "Father, I'm standing and making my
[2:22:49] stand for your communion.
[2:22:53] I'm going to take this bread and wine
[2:22:54] and it is my confession
[2:22:57] that I believe that your word is true.
[2:23:01] Your kingdom is real. Jesus said, "My
[2:23:04] kingdom is not of this world." And I'm
[2:23:07] testifying this evening by taking
[2:23:10] communion. I believe
[2:23:13] in that eternal kingdom.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; I believe just beyond this realm that we
[2:23:18] can see lies an eternal life. full of
[2:23:22] those that have gone on before us,
[2:23:26] full of men that have stood for this
[2:23:28] word and laid their life down for this
[2:23:31] word.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; And I want to join those ranks tonight,
[2:23:35] don't you?
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; I want to be numbered
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; with the saints
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; when they go marching in.
[2:23:43] Lord, let me be among that number when
[2:23:47] the saints go marching in.
[2:23:51] For I have received of the Lord that
[2:23:54] which also I delivered unto you.
[2:23:58] That the Lord Jesus the same night in
[2:24:01] which he was betrayed took bread.
[2:24:06] And when he had given thanks,
[2:24:10] and he broke it, and said, "Take, eat.
[2:24:15] This is my body which is broken for you.
[2:24:19] This do ye in remembrance of me.
[2:24:25] And after the same manner also he took
[2:24:28] the cup
[2:24:31] when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is
[2:24:34] the new testament
[2:24:37] in my blood.
[2:24:40] This do ye as often as ye drink it
[2:24:46] in remembrance of me.
[2:24:49] For as often as you eat this bread and
[2:24:53] drink this cup,
[2:24:55] ye do show the Lord's death till he
[2:24:58] come.
[2:25:00] Whosoever shall eateth this bread and
[2:25:03] drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily
[2:25:06] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[2:25:11] the Lord. But let a man examine himself,
[2:25:16] and so let him eat of that bread and
[2:25:19] drink of that cup.
[2:25:24] We examine ourselves.
[2:25:26] Make your commitment.
[2:25:29] Make your confession.
[2:25:31] Set a goal in your heart
[2:25:34] to serve him. And then enter into a
[2:25:38] covenant,
[2:25:40] the covenant of communion with him. If
[2:25:44] you help me, Lord,
[2:25:46] I'll walk with you.
[2:25:49] And he promised us, I will not leave
[2:25:51] you, nor forsake you.
[2:25:55] For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[2:25:58] unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth
[2:26:00] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[2:26:03] Lord's body. For this cause many are
[2:26:06] weak and sickly among you, and many
[2:26:08] sleep. For if we would judge ourselves,
[2:26:12] we should not be judged. But when we are
[2:26:17] judged, we are chasened of the Lord that
[2:26:21] we should not be condemned
[2:26:24] with the world. Hallelujah.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we should not be condemned
[2:26:30] with the world. Wherefore, my brethren,
[2:26:32] when you come together to eat, tarry one
[2:26:35] for another. And if any man hunger, let
[2:26:38] him eat at home, that ye come not
[2:26:41] together unto condemnation, and the rest
[2:26:44] will I set in order when I come. Isn't
[2:26:49] that
[2:26:51] beautiful? Let us pray.
[2:26:54] Our gracious father,
[2:26:57] we've assembled tonight in this city.
[2:27:02] We've come to this place that you've
[2:27:05] provided.
[2:27:07] We've brought ourselves just the way
[2:27:10] that we are. Our faults,
[2:27:14] our problems,
[2:27:16] our fears, our doubts.
[2:27:20] But Father, we're willing to stand
[2:27:22] before you
[2:27:24] with open hearts,
[2:27:28] not hiding anything from you,
[2:27:32] but telling you that we're a needy
[2:27:34] people.
[2:27:35] And in the year set before us, we need
[2:27:38] you to give us that great guided tour
[2:27:43] to lead our footsteps in righteousness.
[2:27:48] And Father, we want to dedicate
[2:27:50] ourselves
[2:27:52] to you this evening,
[2:27:58] a reconsecration of our hearts.
[2:28:02] Father, we don't want to have a
[2:28:04] traveling mind,
[2:28:07] but we want to bring our minds subject
[2:28:10] to your word.
[2:28:14] Father, we ask you this evening to take
[2:28:16] us in your hand.
[2:28:21] Each one of our hearts,
[2:28:23] each one of our minds,
[2:28:26] that we might serve you with our whole
[2:28:28] heart, our whole mind, and our whole
[2:28:31] body.
[2:28:32] and that we might love our neighbors as
[2:28:35] we love ourselves.
[2:28:38] Father, in these things
[2:28:40] we please you
[2:28:43] and all things.
[2:28:45] Father, now as we take this communion,
[2:28:50] we ask you to bless us in Jesus' name.
[2:28:55] Amen.
[2:28:59] It's 3 minutes to midnight, which we
[2:29:02] know for the believer is a great sign.
[2:29:05] God bless you. Let's all take our
[2:29:07] communion together.
[2:29:20] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless
[2:29:23] you.

[2:31:55] In all my days,
[2:31:58] I've been held in your hands.
[2:32:03] From the moment that I wake up
[2:32:07] until I lay my head.
[2:32:11] Oh, I will sing
[2:32:14] of the goodness
[2:32:16] of God.

[2:33:17] Oh, I have live

[2:35:02] Amen. Amen. Brother Mark David has a
[2:35:05] special. Amen. Right after that, Sister
[2:35:08] Linda can bring her. Amen.
[2:35:39] God bless you church
[2:35:41] and um happy new year to every one of
[2:35:43] you.
[2:35:45] Um I want to sing um until you've known
[2:35:49] the love of God.
[2:35:51] Um couple months ago I was just
[2:35:54] deliberating in my mind and um you know
[2:35:59] I I was reminded of the word the prophet
[2:36:02] said that says nothing will make it
[2:36:04] except for perfect love. Um, so in my
[2:36:07] mind I started wondering what's that per
[2:36:09] what's that perfect love? I I was trying
[2:36:12] to imagine what what a perfect love
[2:36:14] would look like. Um, you know, I just
[2:36:17] kept on telling everybody around me. I
[2:36:19] said, "Hey, uh, not the doctrine, not
[2:36:23] anything, but just perfect love among
[2:36:25] the bride." And then he said, Brother
[2:36:28] Brown said, "Only among the bride will
[2:36:30] you find perfect love." Um, and so, uh,
[2:36:34] I used to remember my dad would sing
[2:36:36] this song while I was very little that
[2:36:38] you've know nothing until you know, um,
[2:36:42] the love of God.
[2:36:45] Now, I'm not going to understand how to
[2:36:47] sing the first and the second stanza. I
[2:36:49] only know the chorus, but I'll try.
[2:36:54] If you could home
[2:36:57] all the world
[2:37:00] and its money,
[2:37:04] build castles tall
[2:37:07] enough to reach the sky above.
[2:37:14] If you could know
[2:37:17] everything
[2:37:20] there was to know about life's game.
[2:37:25] Yet you've known nothing
[2:37:28] until you've known
[2:37:31] God and his love.
[2:37:36] until you've known the loving hand
[2:37:42] that reaches down to a fallen name
[2:37:47] and lift them up from out of sin
[2:37:53] where he has strong
[2:37:58] until you've known just how it feels
[2:38:03] to know that body's
[2:38:07] really real and you've known nothing
[2:38:12] until you've known the love of God.
[2:38:20] If in your lifetime
[2:38:23] you could meet
[2:38:26] everybody
[2:38:30] and you could call
[2:38:33] every name
[2:38:35] from here to young.
[2:38:40] But if you've knocked him face to face
[2:38:45] with Jesus hand
[2:38:48] saving grace and you've known no one
[2:38:53] until you've known the love of God.
[2:39:01] Oh, until you've known the loving end
[2:39:07] that reaches down to a falling man and
[2:39:13] picks him up above the plane
[2:39:18] where he had drawn.
[2:39:23] until you know
[2:39:26] just how it feels to know that God is
[2:39:32] really real. And you've known nothing.
[2:39:37] Until you know the love of God.
[2:39:44] Oh, until you know
[2:39:47] the loving end
[2:39:50] that reaches down to a falling man
[2:39:56] and picks him up
[2:39:58] from heart of sin
[2:40:01] where he had ch
[2:40:07] until you know just how it feels to know
[2:40:13] that God is really real. Saying you know
[2:40:18] nothing
[2:40:20] until you know
[2:40:23] the love of God.
[2:41:16] Goodbye. See you.
[2:41:22] When I'm feeling
[2:41:24] afraid,
[2:41:29] full of uncertainty
[2:41:35] when the plans that I've made
[2:41:40] all fall apart
[2:41:45] when the future's
[2:41:48] clear
[2:41:51] and all that I can do is wait.
[2:41:58] There is a promise
[2:42:01] echoing in my heart.
[2:42:08] He will be faithful
[2:42:11] to the end.
[2:42:15] He will provide time and time again.
[2:42:22] He will be faithful.
[2:42:27] So faithful
[2:42:29] to
[2:42:30] the end.
[2:42:36] He will be there when nothing else
[2:42:41] fails.
[2:42:43] His love is stronger
[2:42:46] than my pain.
[2:42:51] He will be faithful.
[2:42:55] So faithful
[2:42:57] to the end.
[2:43:03] There is grace I can measure.
[2:43:10] Mercy I don't deserve.
[2:43:18] There's forgiveness
[2:43:20] a sinless
[2:43:23] for me.
[2:43:32] Oh, what a blessed assurance
[2:43:38] to know how deeply I'm loved.
[2:43:45] And I'm always reminded
[2:43:48] that he will be all I need.
[2:43:57] He will be faithful
[2:44:00] to the end.
[2:44:04] He will provide time and time
[2:44:09] again.
[2:44:11] He will be faithful,
[2:44:16] faithful
[2:44:18] to the end.
[2:44:25] For he will be there when nothing else
[2:44:30] fails.
[2:44:32] His love is stronger
[2:44:35] than my pain.
[2:44:39] Oh, he will be faithful,
[2:44:43] so faithful
[2:44:46] to the end.
[2:44:53] He will be faithful,
[2:44:58] faithful
[2:45:00] to
