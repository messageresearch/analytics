[Music] [Music] sorry oh my name is [Music] [Music] [Music] time [Music] foreign [Music] open our service in prayer and our Psalm reading this morning amen [Music] and welcome to the house of the Lord thankful that we have his word to rely on and in obedience to his word we've not forsaken to assemble ourselves together and realize it's by his promise that he's to meet us here we have to set our hearts to know that we won't leave here the same person that we want to be determined to be closer to the Lord and have benefits from the word being open for before us singing the songs of praise surely delivering our hearts and worship to him surely but the word of God it's quicker and sharper than any two-headed sword it'll discern what we have need of today and he's here to provide it let's just go the Lord in prayer [Music] our gracious and kind Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once again to the beautiful sunshine of this day Lord we're able to gather together Lord we pray would be in unity in one Accord one mind one purpose Lord that is to give you the preeminence and Lord It's not the issue in life that we're rejoicing in this morning but it's ESO in life Lord we're thankful for the gift that just keeps on giving Lord Lord so many times a holiday season we remark and amazed at how little Credence is given to the to the gift that was given maybe a few hours a day a week they're thankful but Lord truly there's a people Lord that you're sustaining you're quickening their life by your life Lord that we lean on you and you're this rock in a weary land Lord that's where we're going this morning that's we have desire to to rest upon is that cleft in the Rock today Lord is still a provision you're still on The Mercy Seat you're still a Healer you're still a savior Lord we need all these things sustain us we pray preserve Us by Your Word Lord as we look into this portion of your word pray that you'll be a blessing to each one that hears it Lord may you just prepare our hearts for the the later preaching Lord that it may fall on fertile ground you can water it with this your spirit Lord and spring up to everlasting life Grant it to us today Lord we look to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen we're going to read from Psalm 121 this morning just a very short reading um and I just don't hardly have enough fingers to to stick in the places you could refer to even from just this little portion of scripture but I focus there on the and it's a song of degrees my Bible says and obviously the praise of David's heart and the meditation and there's uh certainly promises and blessings within it but verse 8 well for seven and eight it's talking about preservation of the Lord he said the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forevermore that's our promise our going in and coming out is preserved by the Lord and I was thinking about preservation just and it wasn't even on my heart to say these things but uh being a hunter and you harvest game and you want to preserve it and and get the benefit of it sometimes you're in the field and you have to put ice on it you know you can preserve a little while with just ice you can preserve like the old-timers used to do with smoke sometimes with heat with salt different means of of preservation but they only last for a season right think of this the preservation of life itself you take an animal's life and and it turns it starts dying we know brother around taught us in 72 hours after a spoken a cancer goes out sometimes it swells up and the person that oh I'm worse off than I was I'm not healed it's just that life dying and it's trying to to mortify well there's a life Giver that can sustain us and preserve Us by quickening life back to us these bodies are failing they're going down getting arthritic stumbling they age they're gonna die but we have a life within us that's going to Quicken us into everlasting life amen and I just think of the way Luke put it and he's talking about the Lord Jesus he says and the time came when he he was to be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem brother sister this is the time we have to steadfastly set our faces to the job and the task is set before us and realize that the Lord is doing the keeping he's preserving us very quickly it would go to John and of course brother Brown probably uh quoted this as much as he did Saint John Ford the woman at the well Saint John 14 12 was one of his favorites he said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the work shall I do The Works that I do shall he do also and the Greater Works than these shall they do because I go unto my father but we're going to drop down in just a little bit and look at verse number 21. he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him okay the original promise that God gave to Abraham was totally unconditional he said I have already done this I have established thee and thy seed it's going to be forever and I see it shall be like the Sands of the sea okay Abraham didn't have anything to do with that it was already done the children of Israel later they said if you will stay in that land when they got out of that land they didn't get the promise he said go take the land every footstep you take is yours possession they get out of the land they get out of the will of God don't mix yourself with inhabitants and other lands okay we have a promise too if we keep his Commandments amen I wanted I want to say we need strict adherence to the word of the Lord we've got to keep his Commandments and Judas saith unto him not as scary Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not into the world he has a secret group of people a select elect group Jesus answered and said if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me you know and I started looking at hearing and keeping and in the Hebrew it's amazing how tied those two are together and uh I just read and you can take your own discernment of what it means and Quicken to you foreign just very quickly it says is Shamar a primary root to hedge about this is keep to hedge about as with thorns guard generally to protect attend to beware be circumspect take heed to self keep look narrowly observe preserve and regard save self sure that lay wait for are a Watchman amen he is all those things when he preserves us and here is here so here he that heareth my words you know I was I was growing up to understand there's a difference in listening and hearing you may hear your parents but listen to them and respond there's a difference he that heareth and understandeth my word he that hath an ear we have a special ear this morning and the word of the Lord is going to come and fall on those ears and it's going to Quicken it to your heart it can hit that ear and not be dropped down into your heart you pay no attention to it that's when he's talking about he that heareth my words the hate man him the father love it amen to hear intelligently often implied of attention obedience caused to tell attentively call gathered together carefully certainly consent consider be content declare diligently discern give ear cause to let make to hear indeed listen make noise he obedient obey perceive make a proclamation think of that regard report show forth and make a sound surely tell understand whosoever heareth Witness it's amazing how when you read a scripture and people get something different from the same scripture you just read that's God's word amen brother John and I were talking about music and I said it's time for him to pick up a new instrument he knows music I don't know music if you don't probably understand my my key is B flat doesn't matter what key it is I'm gonna be flat but for him it's natural and I think God in the beginning music is divine music is an inspiration of God the devil has perverted it just like he's done everything else but music proclaims God and we're going to enjoy that here in just a few minutes with music Amen Let It come down and sweep your soul amen but let's go to Psalm 121 before I get along here amen it's just I want to say it just envelops you you get into the word of God and it ties together all over whatever you have need of he is a provider amen let's read that together Psalm 120 let me add this real quick first my son Joshua his wife Hannah family are with us today I'm thankful for that little Cooper Margot and Ellison back there we appreciate the Lord preserving them amen blessed be the name of the Lord psalm 121. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from which cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not Slumber behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand the son shall not smite thee my day nor the Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forevermore blessed be the name of the Lord amen God bless

attitudes May the love of God be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit we ask you to bless us father and keep us in the spirit of your word we ask it this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning trust the Lord will bless you let's turn in our Bibles I believe this Psalm 27 if we want to read these the beautiful scriptures found there in psalm 27. and uh I love the psalm reading amen I I certainly identify with brother Tim when when he said he doesn't know music but I certainly know that's true but brother Tim used to lead songs so I know he I know he knows how to sing so it's a blessing to us psalm 27. I'm excited about the word this morning I just trust that I can bring it in the spirit that our messenger brought it that's all I can hope for the brothers we're going to put up and and go through and read some wonderful statements this morning out of the message the rapture I really encourage you if you can to go listen to it and study it this is the scripture that brother Branham uses to open that and I thought it was beautiful this message was preached just very shortly I think it's in December uh I think I have the date here uh let me see I got it here somewhere what December 4th so uh uh we'll do that there were December for well I think I ran off and left my book in there so Billy would you go get those that my books for me there's two of them there the Rapture it says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes come upon me to eat me eat up my flesh they stumble and fell though the hosts should encamp against me my heart shall fear not fear the war should arise against me in this will I be confident one thing I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life and behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire of his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secrets of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock our Lord bless you this morning you may be seated I think yeah I found him right here what's that one is that okay okay we certainly loved the Lord this morning and are certainly trusting that uh it'll be our portion I want to make sure I have the uh the word because I I just want to go through this uh this message was preached just shortly before the prophet of God left us um I think it's extremely significant that that the message that he preached before communion was the rapture the Rapture is the most important thing in our lives amen that's if it's if I could say anything for us this morning it's all about the rapture Titus tells us and and because even the Lord Jesus tells us to the when the Watchmen cometh he says when the master cometh he said watch be prepared be ready Titus talks about 213 looking for that blessed and glorious hope of of the uh coming of the Lord of his soon appearing the scripture tells us look up for your Redemption draweth not and so I think that uh if there's such a great event lying before us it would uh behoove us as individuals do uh seriously uh take it into consideration of what a serious matter it is and and how that uh it would be important that we prepare for it many of you who have been through school i i i as you all know I dropped out of high school and I I went the a way of a sinner of my day but God's gracious Mercy uh saved me but for those of you who would prepare for a test you you would study you would you'd be prepared you'd put effort into it because that had some value to you and so I'd ask this morning what value does the rapture have to you I think it would be something that we certainly wouldn't want to miss and so I want to uh talk to you this morning about it and and how it comes about to the believer so how is God preparing you for the rapture because God provides everything that the believer has need of that's one thing he's Jehovah Jireh God's a provider so God has a provided way so if God has a Rapture for you he has a provided way for you to see it he has a provided way for you to prepare for it and he has a way for you to know if you're part of it and I think that uh the the reason that people are going in so many different directions today is that there's something about it that there that's imperative to them they know something's happening I mean if they're watching the world fall apart right in front of their eyes and they don't know how to stop it and the more they try to heal it fix it the worst to give they have such a bad drug problem in certain areas of the country so many people are dying of drug overdoses you know they're dying of drug overdoses because they haven't received the life that God's offered to a a person the gift of God's eternal life through Christ Jesus right now look so they're going to try to fix the problem so they put up vending machines that have crack pipes so they can smoke crack without getting infected that give them new needles so they don't have to use needles they give them and I overdose drugs and and they're just going to put them in a dispenser and and hand them out to everybody well it's just it's ignorance because they don't know what the solution is I know what the solution is for every drug addict in this country is to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior and be baptized with the Holy Ghost that's the solution it's a solution God had a solution for a dying generation he had a solution for this generation in this age and in this time it breaks my heart a lot when that solution is no longer felt to be able to do what it was sent to do in other words it's abandoned well this doesn't work anymore and that's a great deception Jesus told them he says I have not come to destroy the law but I have come to fulfill it every jot in every Tittle everything that was spoken of me and that the prophets wrote of me I'm here to do it I am and so they they looked upon it and they rejected it and their end is destruction what I want to just let it really sink deep in you is make sure that that that you understand and that you are not rejecting the very thing that God sent to prep you and direct you to the rapture so God has a way of of doing it and how many knows his ways his word is that right we know that we know that God does everything by his word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God everything that was made was made by him it was made by the word of God in the beginning was the word so can every age and if the brothers want to follow along this is from the message the Rapture page paragraph 47 God allots his word out of each age and each one of those ages has to manifest that so each one of those ages has to manifest the word that's allotted for that age not another age so you understand that you have to receive the word that's allotted and God has to manifest that word to you so you know it is the allotted word now I can preach the gospel of another age I could preach justification I could preach sanctification and it would be good I could preach the restoration of the gifts and all those things that be true because they're part of the word but the important thing is to understand be a part of the word that's allotted not to do away with that because that's what leads us but to understand that there is an allotted portion of God's word to you and he has also foreigned men for that age to fulfill that word this is a deep Foundation of what we're laying this morning every time he allots his word he allotted a man for it God's always dealt with this church by what in Sun Dry times in diverse manners God moved upon his servants the prophets we know that the word of the Lord comes to a prophet so in every age that God wanted to turn a corner in every age that he allotted a word he allotted a man to bring that word and manifest the spirit of that age which was allotted basic Bible but what happens if you reject the man or what happens if you don't feel you need the man anymore or what happens if you feel that his message has gone by what happens if you feel that it wasn't complete and it wasn't full enough well a very simple they that's the way he chose to do it he said he allotted a man to fulfill it when he lauded Moses time he had lauded Moses to it when he allotted the time for the Son of God to be born he allotted him to it every age he allots his man forordained as the Bible said oh you can't separate the man from his message understand it deeply this morning if God is infinite Almighty all-powerful omnipresent uh omnipresent omnificent why he knows all things from the beginning so he knowed there's nothing out of character it's just us thinking it is he's going hit thinking it is it's everything running look back in his word and see what he's doing and then you'll have understanding so we know that God in every age a lot his man for the job so when we understand in our age that God sent the seventh Church age messenger that we were promised Elijah the prophet we are promised the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 5. so we understand that if that within looking at that man we understand we can look at it and we can say this life was that promised word manifested so we could see in the man the manifestation of the light of the word what was Jesus it was every prophesied when he prophesied Jesus he was the one that fulfilled it Moses fulfilled everything that was to prophesy so we have a we have a great Anchor Place that we can stand so we know there's a word allotted to every age you understand that and a man to bring that word to live that word and manifest that word you all have that I trust that you've received that revelation and then so there there's one thing that we certainly understand about the word of God and and the word of God has got to see self-care he said I was speaking the other night in Shreveport in communion when they killed the sacrificial lamb there was to be no leaven among them through an entire seven days no leaven no leavened bread everything had to be unleavened that represents the seven Church ages that we get in the book here and there's no leaven what it's something mixed with it okay there can't be anything mixed with it and we mix Creeds and denomination and everything with the word and still try to call it the word no leaven shall be in the entire seven days it's open no 11. so I have a question for you where are you gonna get the pure unadulterated unleavened word of God Where Are You Gonna Get It Where Are You Gonna you can't eat it can't be mixed where are you gonna get the word that's not mixed with I creeds denominations in other words systems that try to bring men all into the same thinking all in the same form all into the same action spirits that try to clone people's uh uh actions and directions and personalities good right evidences where are you going to get somebody where are you going to get the pure word from the man that God allotted for the age that's the source can't have any leaven in it 59. even when it is eat today don't try to keep it for tomorrow burn it with fire before Night comes for there's a new message coming forth and a new thing thank you see try to hold it over but that's been the attitude of the church try to hold it over he said no he said there's a new thing there's something new for the people that's allotted for the age don't hold it over you know that goes on in our lives God deals with us he shows us a few things we set up camp on those few things and we we depart from the journey and we we settle down and and the worst spirit in the world for that's a Catholic Church I'm a Catholic well I believe for a long time just because I was a Catholic and the Catholic was the true church that being a Catholic is what made me go to heaven there's millions of people that think that way they think because what they believe is what's going to account what you believe doesn't account for anything okay so I hope that all of your hearts this morning want to move towards the rapture don't get to that con of that subtle deception that says oh the Rapture is come and whoever it comes for that's who it'll get and one day the bride hath made herself ready you prepare you prepare for the day of the Lord he says and keep it for tomorrow burn it with fire for there's a new message coming forth a new thing see trying to hold it over but that's been the attitude of the church every Bible Goes Forth and the first thing you know within three years they start organizing over it a denomination starts to organize and so we we understand that that there's got to be no leaven so what God has to has provided for Seven Ages there's coming in age because God sent a man to manifest the unleavened word that you can now eat unleavened word word that's not mixed with anything don't mix it stay with it so we're we're talking about this rapture so one of the characteristics of those that are preparing for the Rapture their lives have no leaven in it eleven free life now you say well is that Fair look in other words if God gives something that manifests then he can give the church something that removes the leaven he's got to give something that is unleavened something that you can look at and and see and say okay what is truth and what is leaven he's got to raise up a standard he's got to raise up something that that speaks the truth that reveals the truth and shows the truth in this age one of the things that the word of God Did It revealed the son of perdition and we know in this last day the angel of Light would be exposed where does God do that with his word what is his word is it the Bible or is it at the Bible made flesh so if God allotted a word for every day and he lauded a man to bring and manifest that word for every age then the work is in the message that God sent not held over things from days gone by but a pure true unadulterated word that the believer could feed on and live by and prepare by and this word would manifest in them so it can't have any leaven now what is the rapture going to be is it just a random act in time in other words you're just walking along and living your life and boom you rapture is it something that's unfindable or something that you can't understand is it just the mystery no he says make this statement did you know the Protestant and Catholic Church is predicted in the last days to be blind the same thing to the scriptures with Christ on the outside trying to get in because thou saith I am rich and have need of nothing and know it's not thou are miserable poor wretched naked and blind and don't know it Revelations 3 there you are back to the blindness again trampling over the things of God as if they didn't mean nothing to them scoffers making fun of it that's what the Bible said yes just trembling over the things of God it's not important you know I mean it's not serious life isn't a party you know what it isn't Church than Fellowship Church then Fellowship let's call it let's go to the restaurant let's have a barbecue let's do this no you must eat the word of God with singleness of heart with fear and trembling preparing yourself for that great and Dreadful day and I say use that which God hath given you to prepare amen but what is the rapture but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her so what is the rapture it's a revelation where are you going to get that revelation [Music] it's a revelation may I I mean could you imagine I'm sorry I'm just not spiritual enough to come up with better uh explanations and things but could you imagine the Rapture being passed out like a ticket like a token like a price paid here my brother here's the rapture who else wants the rapture well you're going to get it this morning what is it that receive it's a what a revelation the Rapture to the Bride is a revelation let me ask you this morning if the Raptors are revelation okay you've got to ask yourself do I got it and if I don't where do I get it in every age God allots the word what is the word that's allotted for our age the revelation of the rapture oh yeah it's a revelation why why is the Revelation freely given because the word was freely given let's just walk a little bit this morning do you like to walk in God's word the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the revelation of the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture Hallelujah that's what she's waiting for she's waiting for that revelation of the rapture she's looking up hurry Jim's dying nigh now here comes a man ordained of God with a message what's he packing he's packing the revelation of the rapture not an event the Rapture is a condition is when that bride gets that Rapture in faith when she's prepared herself she's made ready there's an invisible Union and her and the bridegroom have become one Hallelujah Not A tingle or a chill but something that's so deep down inside will be waiting for the revelation of the rapture now it's a revelation for Revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that God's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that God that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so Molloy I love the launch right there if it hasn't been revealed to you I don't care what's said you don't go after it if there's a question raised pray about it pray for revelation the answer is not explanation it is in fancy words and enticing words men of great speech Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words but I came to you with power and demonstration of the spirit the ability to discern between good and evil between right and wrong between false and Truth [Music] solid rocks like he said them that I might dwell in your house forever that my feet might be established upon the rock serious but joyful as though it wasn't so now faith that that's what faith is it's the revelation of God the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body it's got to be revelation then you can't be tossed to and fro by every wind of Doctrine every breath of air everything that moves I've been in this message a long time over 50 years I've been Revival after Revival rise up rapturing Doctrine after rapturing Doctrine rise up but I can tell you one thing that I found I found it's exactly the way that brother Branham said it would be where did rapturing Faith Lie what was going to be the source of this rapturing faith because this is what he said in paragraph 73 he said he said flesh him blood never revealed this to you but my Father which in heaven has revealed it to you Upon This Rock I'll build my church now what is it Upon This Rock I'll build my church The revelation of the word in its season so there's a word for the season now you can't go back and look back 50 years ago and say that the word remained there then Noah's message would be good now we know that God chose this man for this age how he would deliver his message to the church and God told them that this message would be delivered how are you going to deliver to the church he says I am going to store it up I am going to record it and others have taken it and printed it out it doesn't matter what God Said I am going to store my word up because there's a reason for that it had to be a voice for the Lord himself shall descend with a shout a voice a message so that was going to be stored up and now that feels food by the spirit of God would be brought forth in season not a different word same word that was stored quickened to you by revelation if you have a storehouse and you know there's Revelation on there not only revelation but rapturing revelation how important would that voice come to you how important would it be for you to hear it the Rapture is not a second hand experience is food the church is built on the revelation of the word in its season I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it The Book of Revelation is the last book of the Bible it's sealed to unbelievers in there the Bible says in the 22nd chapter whosoever take one word from it or add one word to it I'll take his part from The Book of Life I'll tell you it would behoove you to know if somebody's adding or taking away don't go by a feel good or don't go by a demonstration we'll get into that this in a little bit but how are you gonna know whether something is counterfeit or not by taking it to the original and we have the original word of God message of the hour because God's word comes from to a prophet and a prophet is a Divine interpreter of God's word [Music] how simple has he made it well prove to me you're a prophet you have this wrong I see you right here you're with the doctor you're with that blind eyes death dead raised every Vindicated sign that proved that Jesus was the Messiah every single one of those same signs proved and Vindicated that this message was from God sure it was scoffed not and impersonate it but not to those that get through revelation it's not by flesh and blood though so many of us are now are trying to Anchor it on a fleshly experience brothers and sisters pitch to your heart he says the revelation he said it says that the table of a book we realize that then it was altogether given for believers and it opens the Book of Revelation and reveals who is the author of the entire book is he is to look upon as Alpha and Omega from Genesis to Revelation Jesus Christ just the same right straight through he reveals a complete mystery of himself and his plan for his church ages to come and it was sealed with seven seals where are we going to get this Revelation from and the whole plan now not in other ages they all be part of the Rapture though they haven't come to that but we're not in that age we're in the lady of CNAs we're in the seventh age we're in the opening of The Seven Seals so where are you going to get your rapture where are you going to get your revelation because it was sealed up but this messenger he's going to open those Seven Seals and he's going to reveal the church the mystery of the word of God that's going to allow them to receive the revelation of the rapture what those seven Thunders help now the book was written but then remember it was sealed with Seven Seals and these Seven Seals was not to be opened Revelation 10 tell the sounding of the last Earthly angel on Earth Revelations 10 7 and in the days of the sounding of the last Angel's message the seventh angel the mysteries of God should be finished in that age and that that's the age we're living in now there's people that go around preaching that this Seven Seals were opened in the first church age they weren't opened nobody saw it in the first church now you look back and historically see it you can see that the white horse rider went out nobody saw the Weiss writer going out nobody saw the deception of Satan nobody saw that Satan appeared as an angel of Light nobody saw he had access to the name of Jesus Christ and what he was doing sowing false Doctrine sowing leaven sowing ideas nobody saw it it was opened in this age why was it open to you because you're the people that need the revelations of the rapture I'll move right along and these days the sounding of the last seventh angel message that's it we all know that we're living in the lady of CN age there will never be another age to it it can't be so we're living in the lady you'll see in age and the Seven Seals that held the book is from mysterious two people should be open at that day that's what he promised now it won't be nothing outside of the word because you can't add to it or take away from the word it's God to remain always the word but the Revelation is to reveal the truth of it what it is to make it fit with the rest of the scriptures and then God vindicates that it to be the truth Hallelujah isn't that right so we know that the Rapture is a revelation we know that that who had that revelation had no leaven in it it was pure unadulterated word and we understood that the mystery of it was hid until the Seven Seals were open and then we could understand where the revelation of the rapture is it's in the message Revelation comes by what hearing faith and Revelation the faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God I can't believe no I won't go there you know that's my hobby horse you know how I feel about things but each of you if I ask how many of you would have a phone it's on there you can listen to it you can read it the question is are you are you diligently seeking the revelation of the rapture now if you don't believe it's good exists I wouldn't waste my time if if if if you don't come to the house of the Lord do you hear the word of God so you can make preparation to be ready then what are you coming for go see a psychiatrist he can give you little pills that make you feel good no I want to make the rapture I want to be ready I want to know I want that revelation well who is the Rapture for right who's going in the rapture it wouldn't that be a great question to answer that that we want to know who it is okay so it's it's got to be there there's God God to be something the question so let's just read this it says and then when the bride is being called out how are you going to put it out it's the revelation of the manifestation of the word made true first of all it's the revelation of the manifestation of the word made true behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day the revelation of the manifestation of that word being made true in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the revelation of the word of God made true do you need to get that brother I want you to take it outside okay instead of don't worry we've got people shopping on Amazon so it's a revelation of the word made True what do you think the cloud was it was a revelation of the word made true what do you think the promise of the son of man was that deity would stand in flesh and do the same works that he did before it was the revelation of the word of God made true do you understand what God's done for you he's he's revealed to you that the word of God for this hour has been manifested and made true oh praise God made true and we're living in that day praise God the revelation of the mystery of his self [Music] now the Rapture this Rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride [Music] remember the Bible said and the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years this great rapture if there's if there's not a Rapture friends where are we at my goodness where are we going if there isn't an escape for us out of this place they're taking our kids they decide I think I want this kid to be a a girl well he's not a girl he's a boy well we don't care we think in his mind they're discussing laws about being able to take a child that's already been born 21 days after its birth if it looks like it's not going to have a a normal life God don't care about this life what happens if he put that little name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world they've got more life than the people that are living they're dead and they don't know it setting themselves on the throne as if they are gods listen close the Rapture that we're talking about is only for revived remember this great rapture there's not a Rapture friends where we're at what are we going to do what age are we living in what promise do we have there is going to be a Rapture the Bible said there will be and it'll be only for the elect the elect lady the Bride of this day that's pulled out the church the very Word Church means called out of as Moses called the nation out of a Nation the holy spirit is calling a bride out of the church a church out of a church members from every denomination making up the bride the bride tree and it is in the tape it is in the tape the bride tree the bride coming out calling and that's the one that and that's the one the bright treat is the bride rather is the one that's going to be in the rapture that alone nothing but the bride the elected ones foreknown by God from the beginning the father's spiritual Gene oh my God there's got to be something that comes that gives the revelation to that spiritual Gene the elected people that were elected to receive it he says he says and now so were you in you've got you've got eternal life in God before there ever was a world you were a part of the Son of God an attribute of God he know the very Apes that you're coming oh my he knew you'd be here Church he he predestinated you to that age to take that place and no one else can take it care how many impersonations and things you've got to be there because he knowed you would be there and you are made manifested now you can fellowship with him and that's what he wants he's longing for fellowship and worship amen is that right folk it is for that elected predestinated person now I'd I'd like to I'd make that sure right how is it how does it how do you know you're an elected person by revelation by revelation not by your works not by how you like God reveals to you that you're his I'm going to finish up now we got a few sleepings so we we take that as a sign so we know all those seeds are predestinated and the body of Jesus Christ the bride will be a part of his body he was the word and the bride will have to be the word word added to word added to word Luther justification Wesley sanctification Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Spirit restoration of gifts and the rest of it that goes with it see it's got to be word on top of word germ on top of germs life on top of life to bring out the full statue of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ now remember you was an attribute and now the thing of it is after we find out these things that Christ is coming for us Pride now how do we get in to that bride that's the question so what's been our question right our questions then where do you get the pure unadulterated word where do you get the Revelation from who is the bride so now our question is how do you get into the bride foreign say join our congregation don't that spirit's out there right now Church one of them wants a certain type of baptism one wants to do this and that you must beat in tongues or you haven't got it the other one says you don't have to speak in tongues one says You must dance in the spirit this one says You must Shout that he got a sensation it's all all right and then still it's all wrong there's got to be something that clarifies it it's all all right but yet at the same time it can be all wrong right right no I'm just I'm just reading out of a book but I just happen to know that book's truth I just happen to know that book's life I've had a divine revelation that this is the voice of God the Holy Spirit didn't even come to speak of itself but to bring us into remembrance of all things that he said it's always the word he said he says yet it's all wrong now how do we get into this body First Corinthians said by one Spirit we're all baptized into this body by one's Holy Spirit baptism that if you want to put that down it's First Corinthians 12 13 and by one Spirit we are all baptized and the spirit is the Life of Christ is that right The Life of Christ and the life of any seed which he was the word seed brings the seed to life it's the word life that brings the seed to life what is the baptism of the holy spirit it's the word bringing the seed life in you to life it is the Life of Christ Glory you get it if that life is laying in the seed and the baptism of the spirit comes upon it it's bound to bring that seed to life this is where the great confusion is church because a person can intellectually recognize that Jesus Christ died for their sins they can even be convicted by the sins that they committed and feel the guilt and the shame and they can acknowledge that Jesus Christ paid the price for that sin now somebody comes along and says that's enough that's all you have to do confess your sins confess that he's Lord and that you're a sinner and you shall be saved or they hear truth and there's something that rings in their heart and they say that's truth so with all their knowledge and all their ability they dedicate their life to Christ and they do everything they can do to follow that's wonderful but it's not the baptism of the Holy Spirit the baptism of the holy spirit is the change of your nature where he personal pronoun I will not leave you comfortless but I will come again I'll be with you even in you and I'll lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness you know beyond the shadow of a doubt that there's been a change in your heart a change in your nature now the flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these things are contrary one to another but there's something in you that quickly cries out of the father because there's no longer a desire for sin is true yeah there's no more a consciousness of unbelief the baptism of the Holy Spirit ends the question of whether you believe or not I believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit I believe in the life of Jesus Christ being manifested in the flesh by the baptism of the Holy Spirit without evidence the spirit Bears record of itself took if you have the spirit the spirit Bears record to the word it Bears record to the man that God sent right it Bears record to the unleavened bread it be Bears record that the Rapture is a revelation it Bears record that if only the Divine elected that's going to be in the Rapture it does not their record to sensation don't do it they're born to Kin what are they born of they're born of the word of God what caused the birth it's the word that caused the birth the message of the hour causes the birth of the Bride in this age and that's what happens that's what the baptism the holy spirit is is when the spirit of the word comes in you there's record with the word of God and now produces the Life of Christ in you and now you can say The Works that he did I do also why because the same mind is in you that was in Christ the same compassion is in you that was in him the same attributes are yes you got a longing for lost souls what would be to our record if we had the most glorious Hallelujah Jericho March and we left the sinner in his seat and not one of us had discernment to know if God was moving upon a soul or not or with one was depressed or if one needed a coat or if one needed to go another extra mile all the real evidences of the Life of Christ are throwing out the window for a religious experience what good would that do us what what good would it be we've got to have this baptism up Upon Our Life we've got to have that seed come forth because Jesus wants fruit of for himself his wife must bring forth the kind of children that he is no this is what I want to make sure you understand this morning forgive me for waiting so long to get here we know these things don't we but don't we also know that Satan is like a roaring lion in the last days there will rise a deception that true if I could just maybe read it because we understand the great church ages and we understand the word you all are understand that and we know that how does the church get into this it's the spirit quickens it it must be quickened or brought to life this bright character must be brought to life Christ in you must be brought to life what brings it to life the word the word the spirit quickens or makes That Word Alive that's what the Holy Spirit does it makes that word live in you church it's ever a time we need to take ourselves personally stand in front of the word of God and the mirror of the year of thunder and said is my life lining up to the message of the hour that's your urine fandom not Asia's gone by yes the living word for now he says he says I'll just read this and close him like the sun the sun rises in the morning it's a little baby born it's weak it ain't got much heat to it ten o'clock it comes out of high school in the middle it's entering into life three o'clock in the afternoon it's getting old five o'clock it's dying old and weak again going back into the grave and at the end of it it'll rise again the next morning look at the trees they put forth their leaves everything that they do and we find out the leaves drop off and go back what the life goes down to the root of the tree and at the end it comes back up next spring with new life now watch the church how it's done the same thing in Reformation it come out the corn of wheat fell into the ground and died under the Dark Ages persecution it went into the ground it had to die any man's spiritual can see that unless the seed dies and rots it abides alone it has to go into the ground under the Dark Ages and lay there rotted and it comes forth in two little blades of the Lutheran Church out of the Lutheran Church brought off the blades Zeke field and so forth and from that come out the tassel which was John Wesley the great missionary age it drops back out of there and comes that deceiving age that Pentecostal age the corn of wheat why is the Pentecostal age the deceiving age because this is the age that there's an anointing without the word this is the age at the rain falls on the just and the unjust everyone here that's Ever Raised wheat you can look at the wheat when you look at it and when you go out and say I've got wheat and and it looks like you got wheat there but open it up real close and watch you haven't got no wheat at all you've got a shock didn't Jesus warn us that Matthew 24 22 in the last days that the two Spirits would be so close together it would deceive the very elect wheat itself if it was possible now watch it's a carrier what what the a great deception now that's the age that we're living in now the seventh Church age now it's the manifestation of the grain of wheat at the end another comeback now if you take Luke 17 chapter in the 30th verse he says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man begins to reveal himself what is revealed make revelation of what he is in this day what was the opening of the seals what was the revelation of the son of man it was the revelation of him making himself known for what he is in this day now there's a great deception along with that because Satan comes and appears as an angel of Light and we know that the rain falls on the just in the unjust and took the very deception of this age is the anointing that's where the deception lies it allies in the anointing because it's the same anointing so if you put your evidence in the anointing and you say you're anointed I feel the anointing I manifest the anointing I'm anointed there's how are you going to measure that that that's not a deception think of it there's got to be something that ties back something that connects genuine to something that finally brings it took to the things that we know so how do we know because now so we're in this great deceptive age Pentecost because it's the pale horse rider the anointing's falling on everybody there's prayer lines going and and all movement of the spirit everywhere is it the spirit sure it's his beard yes sir but the question is what's it on yeah so you can't measure it you can measure it by the anointing you can't say I feel anointing or I want anointing so you've got to you've got to understand that so how how is he going to bring this Rapture right to pass for the Lord himself shall descend right with a shout correct with a voice and with a trump so we understand that the colloid himself because the first part of it is is a shout is a message to gather his pride together so that he can feed her the unleavened word of God open the Seven Seals to her that she can have the word of God to compare the the deception to she's cutting out he puts within her hand the ability to discern between Good and Evil what's real now he provides something to do that right now if the deception is so close I'm not the judge of that I've only thing that I can go back is find how can I discern it and that is that is just end with this there are three things that happens a voice a shout a voice of trump has happened before Jesus appears now a shout Jesus as all three of them when he's descending a shout what if the shout it's a message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride the first thing he does to get you for the Rapture is he brings the living bread of life right the living bread of life to bring forth a bride where is the bride going to come from forth it's going to come forth from the word that the messenger brought not from the anointing the anointing's the deception so there's got to be something else the believer has to Anchor in else you won't know whether the anointing you have or not is true another if it doesn't anchor in the word it won't last you've got to be able to ask that question in yourself am I anchored to the word is my source of life coming from the shout because that's what the shout was for right it was a revealed word the open word to bring forth the bride by Revelation because she's the only one going in the Rapture Hallelujah aren't you glad for the message of the hour the first thing comes when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together a message comes forth first now lamps trimming time rise and trim your lamps what watch what what what watch was that the seventh not the sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did and some of them found they didn't have any oil in their lamp but it's lamp trimming time I have to go into the whole teaching of the seven candlesticks to tell you that the oil has been stored up the oil is in the tapes the bride's anointing is on the tapes the anointing is the same yes fallen on the just an unjust how do I know what the anointing I have is because that anointing on the bride lines up with the tapes no leaven every word every God every tittle it's their source of life no man in between no explanation no great teachers it's been revealed to you I am the voice of God to you he says it's lamp trimming time he said paragraph 146. didn't Jesus says the rain would fall on the just and unjust put a cockle bar out there and a wheat out there pour water on them and keep them under keep them under fertilized and things like that won't they both live by the same water amen sure well what is it one of them will bear a cockover because that's what he is a cocklebur will raise his hands and Shout just the same as the wheat now the Bible said in the last days there shall come false christs not false jesuses false Christ anointed ones falsely anointed to the word denominationally anointed but not to the word what is the deception false anointed ones that's the deception is the anointing for the word will bear record of itself it don't need nothing else it'll bear record of itself now there will come false anointed ones you get my tape on that get my tape on the seals get my tape on the bride tree get my tape on the anointed ones what a message he's telling back to the church you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on that Church if there's this spirits would be so close it would deceive the very elected possible but what does the elect have they have this affinity with the spoken word for their age they have this love affair with the spoken word for their age they've got an inclination because they've got something inside of them that says my sheep know my voice another they won't follow they quickly run back to the source of their life which is the word of God it burns in their heart the message of life to them it's their security it's what they hear that's put their bread and born on that's what they're corrected by that's what they're strengthened by he said he says you call them and say or are you Jesus oh certainly not they wouldn't stand for that but when it comes and says Oh Glory I got the anointing and it's a genuine anointing remember campus had it too and prophesied so did Balaam have it and prophesy they won't stand to say in their Jesus but they'll claim to have the anointing but that don't have nothing to do with this inside unless that was God's seed his genuine from the beginning predestinated you're finished I don't care how much you shout speak with tongues run and Shout It has nothing to do with it it's fine but remember it don't have nothing to do with this on the inside it don't have nothing to do with the rapture why does he preach this right before he leaves the scene you don't think he knew what was coming you don't think he knew what was there what was going to come that the anointed would be the deception that they would be turned to shouting and and speaking in tongues and running you think our messenger didn't know what's going on why would he say it has nothing to do with it and now all you hear is it has everything to do with it I didn't come to you with enticing words but the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit yeah a couple bird can count just as much as the rest of them I've seen heathens rise and shout and speak in tongues and drink blood out of a human skull and call on devils so you any of them Sensations and things forget it it's your heart listen what he says all those sensation and things forget it is your heart in that word and that's Christ bring in there and watch it make itself known just as it opens up like any other seed it declares itself for the age we're living in therefore the message calls the bride together the shout the same one he with the loud voice he screams out the shout and the voice that woke Lazarus with a loud voice he cries Lazarus forth The Voice wakes up the sleeping bride amen and amen and I'll just leave it there because this is how he says she has to model and she has to be molded and made into the image of Christ and Christ is the word that's the only thing see it's in there in the word there cannot be one thing added it cannot be a woman with one hand like a man and the other hand what like Paul like a dog it's got to be exactly word of the Lord like he is the word the bride is part of the bridegroom the woman is part of her husband because she's taken out of her husband Eve was part of Adam from his side so the bride not taken from a denomination but taken from the bosom of the word of God for this day the rapture how beautiful how beautiful of what you are part of the word think of it the word has come through the mouth of a prophet in a message to the bride what was the message this Shout the beginning of the rapture the calling of the Bride bringing her together in invisible Union between Christ and the bride what was this message we received from this prophet that was Vindicated that opened the seals provided a word to give us a revelation with no leaven in it and directive to you the revelation of the rapture to give to you the Revelation it's only for you that you could possess it not be looking for it to get through the deception it gave you a method to get through the deception how am I going to discern this anointing does it line up with what he says if someone says well the seals were opened in the first age ding what was restored the unadulterated word of God what what what was what was the final conclusion he says all the sensations he said forget it that's him forget it is your heart in the word asked yourself this morning has something robbed your heart from the word is your heart in the word I love this word I love this voice I love this Storehouse I love this food it's where my Revelation for the Rapture is coming from it's where I'm going to be molded into His Image because of the same spirit that was in him is in me it'll Quicken my mortal body my anchor holds in the storm what a challenge for this age that the anointing the very anointing itself would be the test and deception of the true and false fine unbelievable but yet he revealed to us exactly what we would be facing okay now where's my soul rest I'm anchored in the Haven of Rest I've anchored my life in The Voice of God's messenger for this age this Holy Bible revealed in its season what was sealed up in here has been made known to me and this is where I rest that's what I know I know if that's my heart is in that word my anointing is true otherwise I can't tell it apart no evidence not the heaven the evidence is the nature of Christ and Christ always amends the word church I beg you make the rapture a serious serious part of your life the revelation of the rapture is contained in the third poll Feast on it and live bring your life in subjection to it when he talks about gossip get rid of gossip when he talks about life bring yourself subject to the word of God don't tape a substitute if you're blessed praise God you're blessed when your Nature's change some Shout some Fallen wheat some are speechless some just worship the transformation is so real but remember one of the mysteries of this age is that you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation he said forget it you go read it listen to The Rapture it's a message strictly for the elect lady and it follows a message called leadership and things that are to be and as the prophet of God closed up his life and his message he had finished storing the food that the bride needed he says there's going to be a rapture how many believes that I'm looking for that Rapture aren't you God bless you this morning brother Billy [Applause] and I saw a stand this morning amen as the word spoken to you this morning amen amen aren't you thankful for the

in the presence of the Sun and ripen Lord that time is very special Lord it's the time that you said that you would have with us Lord in this age that it wouldn't be a public show anymore [Music] I pray that we would each go home Lord and learn to have that time with you Lord and cherish it and appreciate it foreign over us as we leave Lord protect each one of us as we go home and watch over our cars Lord and just help us to be able to make it back to tonight's service Lord with Lord the same expectation that we came with this morning Lord with each service that we come into Lord that we wouldn't take for granted Lord the time that we get to come in here Lord and hear your word and have you speak to us Lord we just we don't want to take that for granted Lord each time we come we want to be able to have the same Faith Lord and bring our Pillar of Fire to the church Lord we just ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen we know it's hot outside so and we're trying not to visit in the sanctuary the four years which we can but if you would like you can just go down the walk and go into the building under construction it might not be so hot in there so you're welcome to visit in there uh just keep your conversations clean and and don't let your children just run around crazy wild and it'll just be a little a bit better I I know that um uh and just be careful going in and out use the walkway that would be the best so Lord bless you for those you can come back this evening we'll love to have some fellowship around God's word if not just pray for us and we just trust that the Lord will be your portion so feel free to go under the shade and fellowship there and be careful all right Lord bless you thank you oh can't you see [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]
