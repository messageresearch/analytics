[44:28] mark 11 24.
[44:32] just be reading a few scriptures here
[44:43] maybe we'll back up a few
[44:49] maybe we'll just back up to verse 22
[44:54] and jesus answered and saith unto them
[44:56] have faith
[44:58] in god for verily i say unto you that
[45:01] whatsoever
[45:02] shall say who shall ever say say to this
[45:04] mountain be thou removed
[45:06] and be thou cast into the sea and shall
[45:09] not doubt in his heart but shall believe
[45:11] that those things
[45:13] which he saith shall come to pass he
[45:15] shall have whatsoever
[45:17] he saith therefore i say unto you
[45:20] whatsoever things
[45:22] you desire when you pray believe that
[45:24] you receive them
[45:26] and ye shall have them let's just read
[45:29] john 15
[45:30] 7.
[45:46] maybe we'll just read verse 6 as well if
[45:48] a man abide not in me
[45:50] he is cast forth as a branch and has
[45:52] withered and men gather them and cast
[45:54] them into the fire
[45:56] and they are burned if ye abide in me
[45:59] and my words
[46:00] abide in you ye shall ask what ye will
[46:04] and it shall be done unto you may we
[46:06] just ask a blessing to the reading of
[46:08] the word you may be seated
[46:10] we also just want to read out of
[46:12] galatians chapter 1.
[46:19] be reading verse 11.
[46:33] but i certify you brethren that the
[46:35] gospel which was preached of me
[46:38] is not after man for i neither received
[46:41] it of man
[46:43] neither was i taught it but by the
[46:45] revelation
[46:46] of jesus christ for ye have heard of my
[46:49] conversation in time
[46:51] past in the jewish religion how that
[46:54] beyond measure i persecuted the church
[46:56] of god
[46:56] and wasted it and profited in the jews
[47:00] religion above many my equals
[47:01] and my own nation being more exceedingly
[47:04] zealous of the traditions
[47:06] of my fathers but when it pleased god
[47:08] who separated me from my mother's womb
[47:11] and called me by his grace to reveal his
[47:15] son
[47:16] in me that i might preach him among the
[47:18] heathen
[47:19] immediately i conferred not
[47:22] with flesh and blood
[47:26] amen i just want to pull from this
[47:29] scripture read it might
[47:30] be an odd text but just something the
[47:33] lord placed on my heart
[47:35] not received of man i just want to speak
[47:38] to you a little bit about that
[47:40] because here pulling from that verse 12
[47:44] it says for i neither received it of man
[47:46] neither was i taught it but by the
[47:48] revelation
[47:49] of jesus christ so this gospel that paul
[47:53] is preaching
[47:54] he's he's writing to the galatians there
[47:56] and he's telling him look this
[47:58] this message that i've i've received you
[48:00] know i didn't i didn't receive a message
[48:03] and then
[48:03] run up to jerusalem and and have a
[48:05] little conference with the
[48:07] the disciples that had went before me i
[48:09] didn't run back to my
[48:10] my pastor or or my old church and tell
[48:13] them uh uh
[48:14] look what happened to me on the road to
[48:15] damascus but but paul starts to testify
[48:18] look uh you know i i was zealous
[48:22] for for the traditions of my fathers and
[48:24] and i was going about my own
[48:26] way i had received the traditions of my
[48:28] father but but on my road i was going
[48:31] about to do these things i was even
[48:33] going to persecute
[48:34] the church and i'd i had letters to bind
[48:36] them and put them in the prison
[48:37] but oh something happened to me along
[48:39] the way i was going on and all of a
[48:41] sudden
[48:42] a bright light a pillar of fire struck
[48:44] me down on the road to damascus
[48:46] and oh i wondered what it what it was
[48:48] and he
[48:49] and something spoke to me and said uh
[48:52] paul it's hard to kick against the
[48:54] pricks and
[48:54] and i said lord who art thou
[48:58] he said i am jesus who now
[49:01] and oh i think of paul when he's given
[49:03] this testimony to king of grip he says
[49:05] i wasn't disobedient to the heavenly
[49:07] vision and as he testifies of the
[49:10] message of what he had received from god
[49:12] even king of grip says oh paul thou
[49:15] almost myself persuades me to be a
[49:17] christian
[49:18] why there was such a conviction paul had
[49:21] received something from god
[49:23] he didn't have to confer with man he
[49:25] said i didn't i didn't
[49:26] i didn't go confer with flesh and blood
[49:29] but he had received
[49:30] something from god he didn't receive
[49:32] something from man
[49:34] and that's just something we want to
[49:36] speak on our hearts tonight
[49:38] to you about receiving something from
[49:40] god what you have received
[49:41] if you've received it of man it can be
[49:44] taken away from you
[49:45] but when you receive a revelation from
[49:47] god nothing can take that away
[49:50] just think of paul running there just on
[49:53] that religion and that education
[49:56] and i wonder if some of us maybe fit
[49:57] that mold maybe we're kind of running on
[50:00] intellect and we're kind of running on
[50:01] education
[50:03] kind of running by things that we've
[50:05] heard and and the way we can kind of add
[50:07] it all up
[50:08] but here paul said i didn't get it from
[50:10] seminary
[50:12] i i didn't read the bible and call up a
[50:14] brother and then go over there
[50:16] and then have have him give me his
[50:18] revelation
[50:19] now i'm not taking away the importance
[50:21] of iron sharpening iron and
[50:23] it's good to fellowship amongst the
[50:25] brothers and it's it's good to listen to
[50:26] the word it's it's good to come to
[50:28] church and hear the preachers
[50:30] preach but there has to come a time
[50:34] where the word is revealed to you
[50:36] personally
[50:38] and when that happens i don't care if
[50:40] the very men that introduced you to the
[50:42] message fall away
[50:44] you won't fall away with them but so
[50:46] many times men get caught up
[50:48] with a man's uh a personality they get
[50:51] caught up with a man's charisma
[50:52] and this man came with great ability to
[50:55] explain the message
[50:56] and oh you go down the line and maybe
[50:58] they've been going to church with them
[50:59] for several years
[51:00] but all of a sudden some type of seed of
[51:02] discrepancy pops up
[51:04] and he starts to weave the message this
[51:05] way and that way and all of a sudden you
[51:08] find the people just following right
[51:09] after them
[51:12] when the prophet taught look if your
[51:14] pastor leaves the message leave your
[51:15] pastor
[51:17] and i know our pastor would stand to say
[51:19] that the first time first thing we've
[51:20] heard him say many times
[51:22] oh if he ever left this mess you stay
[51:24] with the message
[51:26] but the problem is if you don't have a
[51:27] revelation how can you stay with
[51:30] something that hasn't been revealed to
[51:31] you
[51:33] so when the man the man behind the
[51:35] pulpit starts deviating
[51:36] or some person comes over to to the
[51:39] house and tries to start giving you
[51:40] their little doctrine and their little
[51:42] way of seeing things
[51:43] all of a sudden you start gravitating
[51:45] over to why because it's been explained
[51:47] to you in such an intellectual way
[51:49] but i believe there's a place that the
[51:51] believer can come to just like paul
[51:53] that can say look what i've received i
[51:55] haven't received it of man
[51:57] where a brother could come and try to
[51:59] talk you off the word of god and say
[52:00] look brother
[52:01] i'm sorry to disagree with you but i'm
[52:03] standing upon the solid rock of
[52:05] revelation
[52:06] i know this is the truth
[52:10] oh we get we get too much of the time
[52:14] start to lean
[52:16] on what we've perceived in our minds
[52:19] i imagine if we were to pass out a
[52:21] message exam tonight
[52:23] oh my maybe we all could pass it we've
[52:26] all been raised
[52:28] a lot of us have been raised right in
[52:29] the church we've all been around it
[52:31] might we can just
[52:32] answer answer all the questions just
[52:34] right but let's talk about a life
[52:36] let's talk about the power let's talk
[52:38] about the example that was set before us
[52:42] let's talk about living it i think about
[52:44] moses you know he
[52:46] he had heard the message he had heard
[52:47] there was a deliverer he heard he was a
[52:48] proper child
[52:50] he was believing these things were true
[52:52] but moses had received it intellectually
[52:55] and so what happened when moses went to
[52:57] execute the message
[52:58] intellectually he got intellectual
[53:01] results
[53:03] but there had to come a time because
[53:06] moses was predestinated for the job
[53:08] where moses met god on the backside of
[53:10] the desert
[53:11] then he had a conference with god then
[53:14] he had a revelation
[53:17] you know he didn't he didn't come down
[53:18] he didn't come back down to pharaoh and
[53:20] say well you know
[53:22] pharaoh just to let you know i'm very
[53:24] aware of all your army and
[53:26] and i've studied it really well and i've
[53:28] developed counter-attacks because you
[53:29] know i was
[53:30] i've studied all this and you know all
[53:32] those little tactics that y'all use out
[53:34] there in warfare i actually designed
[53:35] most of those so
[53:36] i came up with an alternate plan to it
[53:39] didn't come to him intellectually
[53:42] he didn't come with some man's program
[53:44] but he came back with a message
[53:46] he came back with thus saith the lord
[53:50] he came to pharaoh with the message that
[53:53] thus
[53:53] saith the lord let my people go
[53:56] and we have received a message of thus
[53:58] saith the lord
[54:01] we've received a word from god and we
[54:03] should be able to stand just like moses
[54:05] stood there
[54:06] with a message if you've had a
[54:08] conference with god if you know where
[54:10] you're standing
[54:12] the prophet of god says and no man has a
[54:14] right to claim to be a christian
[54:17] no woman no child no preacher especially
[54:21] until he himself has come upon the
[54:23] sacred sands where he's met
[54:25] god all the theologians in the world all
[54:28] the infidels in the world
[54:29] can't explain that away from him he was
[54:32] there
[54:33] it happened it happened to him he knows
[54:37] where he stands if man didn't if
[54:40] if man didn't give it man can't take it
[54:42] away
[54:44] but if man gave it a rob you of it
[54:45] they'll be able to come in and try to
[54:47] try to talk you out of it or talk you
[54:49] this way or that way amen
[54:52] look at that though we start talking
[54:54] about your joy and your peace and your
[54:56] salvation this message who gave that to
[54:58] you
[54:59] who gave that to you
[55:02] god gave that to you so when satan tries
[55:05] to come in and starts to war against you
[55:08] and tries to start take away the
[55:09] promises of god
[55:12] no sir you don't have to back down you
[55:14] say devil it's my
[55:16] it's my joy it's my peace it's my family
[55:19] it's my message i have thus saith the
[55:22] lord
[55:24] oh sure we know he's an accuser of the
[55:26] brethren we know he's always trying to
[55:28] point
[55:29] to your faults and try to point to your
[55:31] failures but oh my one moment in his
[55:34] presence
[55:36] you look at moses oh my he seems so
[55:39] defeated he seems so far away from the
[55:41] call of god
[55:44] there 40 years there in egypt now 40
[55:46] years on the back side of the desert be
[55:48] like
[55:48] moses you missed it you totally
[55:52] missed the will of god for your life
[55:55] you're 80 years old you're washed up
[55:57] you've been in this man you're telling
[55:58] me you've been in the message
[55:59] for 15 20 years and this is only so how
[56:02] far you've gotten
[56:04] you're telling me that you're the bride
[56:05] of christ and you're still struggling
[56:07] with all these things
[56:08] all you have to tell that devil devil
[56:10] whatever you're trying to say look
[56:12] i just know one moment in the presence
[56:14] of god will change everything
[56:16] and i've come to the house of god
[56:17] tonight and i believe where two or three
[56:20] are gathered in my name
[56:21] there i am in the midst and i tell you
[56:23] whatever you have need of tonight just
[56:25] one moment in his presence
[56:26] everything can change i don't care how
[56:28] far sin has dragged
[56:30] you out there in the world i don't care
[56:31] how bad your family situation looks
[56:33] i don't care how discouraged you feel
[56:35] right now
[56:37] one moment in his presence it changed
[56:41] everything
[56:42] for moses moses looked defeated he
[56:45] looked like he didn't have a chance
[56:46] he looked like he was weak he looked
[56:48] like he was incapable
[56:50] how could an old man with a stick ever
[56:52] march down to egypt
[56:54] and and perform a deliverance to the
[56:56] people of god
[56:57] but what happened he was one time in the
[57:00] presence of the pillar of fire
[57:02] and everything changed i believe the
[57:04] same thing is available tonight for the
[57:06] people of god
[57:07] his presence is here he'll give you a
[57:09] revelation where you're no longer
[57:11] standing upon
[57:12] man's ideas or man's creeds but you're
[57:14] standing upon the solid
[57:15] revelation of jesus christ
[57:21] oh that's what we have brothers and
[57:23] sisters we have a message from god
[57:28] then moses he was no longer operating by
[57:31] the ways of the flesh
[57:33] he was operating by thus saith the lord
[57:37] we have thus saith the lord
[57:43] look you're going to fulfill every
[57:44] promise that's been spoken of you
[57:48] you're the predestinated you're the cult
[57:51] you're placed here to do it matter of
[57:54] fact i believe i believe god
[57:55] come i believe god came himself and he
[57:58] spoke a bride into existence
[58:01] i believe god himself according to a
[58:03] divine promise
[58:05] has come in the end time and he him own
[58:07] self has spoke a word
[58:09] concerning a people and there was a
[58:12] predestinated people to receive that
[58:13] word and here they are
[58:15] oh the bride of jesus christ ones that
[58:18] believe
[58:18] every single word that are believing
[58:21] they're going in a rapture believing
[58:22] they're going in a body change
[58:25] not because something they can do in
[58:26] themselves but because he said so
[58:29] i'm not standing upon my ability to
[58:32] perform it
[58:33] i'm not standing upon some way that i
[58:35] can figure it out in my mind
[58:36] i'm standing upon the fact that he said
[58:38] it and i believe
[58:39] it so i want to tell you stay with it
[58:45] stay with him keep believing if he said
[58:48] it
[58:49] you believe it what did jesus tell the
[58:52] disciples he said but go terry
[58:55] terry in the city of jerusalem and until
[58:58] you be endued with power from on high
[59:01] so what did they do they believed
[59:04] they went and tarried there but i'm sure
[59:07] you could imagine
[59:08] in their minds could you imagine i
[59:11] wouldn't doubt they sang songs and they
[59:13] told stories and i
[59:14] i i bet they got emotional i bet they
[59:16] got excited i bet they were feeling some
[59:18] stimulation maybe i'll but they're like
[59:19] oh yeah you remember that time we went
[59:20] down there he braided the whip he
[59:22] started beating everybody out of the
[59:23] temple
[59:24] oh my and then and then we we remember
[59:27] remember how when we saw that all of a
[59:28] sudden
[59:29] with the words of the prophet came upon
[59:30] us is like oh the zeal of thy house
[59:32] has eaten them up that's it we're
[59:33] watching the fulfillment we're watching
[59:35] the very manifestation of what the
[59:36] prophets have spoken
[59:38] oh and there they go they could just
[59:39] start telling testimony a testimony you
[59:41] remember that one time
[59:42] uh the woman there that touched touch
[59:44] the hymn of his garments and
[59:45] we told him the master what do you mean
[59:47] who touches you hundreds of people are
[59:49] touching you
[59:50] and there all of a sudden out of the
[59:51] whole bunch he picked out one of them
[59:53] that had touched his garment because
[59:54] virtue went from him
[59:55] oh i imagine maybe they they started
[59:57] getting getting worked up and getting
[59:59] enthusiastic and
[1:00:00] maybe they started feeling like hey
[1:00:02] maybe we can go maybe we can go tell
[1:00:04] somebody about this i think
[1:00:05] you think we got it i don't know man i
[1:00:07] think those roman soldiers are out there
[1:00:09] yeah
[1:00:11] yeah well you know they did they did
[1:00:12] crucify him
[1:00:14] yeah maybe i don't know
[1:00:18] i don't know about testifying just yet
[1:00:19] you know maybe we ought to stay here a
[1:00:20] little longer
[1:00:23] you know he didn't say terry until all
[1:00:25] of a sudden there
[1:00:27] they were sitting around there according
[1:00:29] to a divine promise
[1:00:30] and also all of a sudden a pillar of
[1:00:34] fire dropped in there
[1:00:36] little licks of fire started coming upon
[1:00:38] the believers
[1:00:39] and all of a sudden they started to get
[1:00:40] endued with power on high
[1:00:42] oh and when that happened nothing could
[1:00:44] hold them nothing could contain them
[1:00:46] all of a sudden they started coming out
[1:00:48] the windows they kicked out the door
[1:00:50] oh and they come out in the streets they
[1:00:52] were testifying
[1:00:53] and what did they start saying oh who
[1:00:54] are these guys these are drunk guys
[1:00:57] what are they doing to peter stood they
[1:00:58] say men and brethren oh this is no we
[1:01:00] are not drunk as you suppose
[1:01:02] but this is what the prophet joel has
[1:01:04] prophesied
[1:01:05] oh we shall i'll see visions and dream
[1:01:07] dreams and talk in tongues
[1:01:09] this is the manifestation this is the
[1:01:11] fulfillment of it
[1:01:13] why because they stayed there and they
[1:01:15] carried believing in the promised word
[1:01:23] they had received something that didn't
[1:01:25] come from man
[1:01:28] it came from god that's what malachi 4
[1:01:32] has been promised to do
[1:01:35] is to restore us back
[1:01:38] to that same faith malachi 4 has
[1:01:42] promised to restore us
[1:01:43] back to that same faith and power that
[1:01:46] was delivered at pentecost
[1:01:48] the prophet of god says in christ the
[1:01:50] mystery of god revealed he says then
[1:01:51] when we
[1:01:52] are born of him we are filled with him
[1:01:56] see your life his life is in you
[1:01:59] then all our actions should declare him
[1:02:03] it's like taking life out of it out of
[1:02:05] one tree and putting it into another
[1:02:08] taking life out of a pear tree and put
[1:02:11] it in an
[1:02:11] apple tree it'll bear pears it got to
[1:02:15] because the sap the life in it the germ
[1:02:18] is pear tree all right then all of our
[1:02:20] actions should
[1:02:22] declare him we have his name is that
[1:02:25] right
[1:02:26] we should bear his name and remember we
[1:02:29] are now as his bride
[1:02:30] pregnated with his spirit oh my the
[1:02:33] church
[1:02:34] bearing children pregnanted by his
[1:02:37] spirit with his name
[1:02:39] bearing his name bearing his life
[1:02:41] bringing forth the signs of his life
[1:02:44] evident with the preeminences evidence
[1:02:47] of his resurrection
[1:02:48] showing that he is not dead but alive
[1:02:51] forevermore
[1:02:52] this is eternal life and vindicates to
[1:02:55] the world
[1:02:56] that we are alive in him how do you know
[1:03:00] because you're a church member because
[1:03:03] christ
[1:03:04] is living through you so pregnanted with
[1:03:07] his spirit that you're a prisoner to
[1:03:09] anything you're a prisoner to anything
[1:03:11] else
[1:03:11] you're confined oh my to the gospel
[1:03:14] confined
[1:03:14] to the word and all the children that
[1:03:18] you bring forth
[1:03:20] is that because you're a prisoner
[1:03:23] you can't commit adultery you're already
[1:03:26] pregnated glory
[1:03:28] he can't take a hold the womb of life is
[1:03:30] closed to anything else
[1:03:32] you're already his by predestination
[1:03:35] that seed has come to life no the world
[1:03:38] can't get in
[1:03:38] oh how we'd like to stay on that for
[1:03:41] about an hour
[1:03:42] i'm sure you understand christ and his
[1:03:44] alone
[1:03:45] already finished the seed was there
[1:03:48] when was it put there before the
[1:03:51] foundation of the world
[1:03:53] he has predestinated us unto eternal
[1:03:56] life
[1:03:59] and as soon as the life-giving flow that
[1:04:02] seed lay in there
[1:04:04] other seeds just couldn't come in it
[1:04:06] wouldn't take hold
[1:04:07] oh my friends do you realize what he's
[1:04:10] saying
[1:04:12] if it wasn't for that predestinated seed
[1:04:15] oh i'd probably be dead i'd probably be
[1:04:17] locked up
[1:04:18] i'd probably be in some institution or
[1:04:20] maybe i'd i'd have gravitated to some
[1:04:22] uh when i started wanting to look for
[1:04:24] god maybe i'd have latched on to the
[1:04:26] pentecostal religion maybe i latched on
[1:04:28] to some
[1:04:29] charismatic movement oh but there was
[1:04:31] something
[1:04:32] else there that would only be satisfied
[1:04:35] hallelujah by one thing
[1:04:37] and that was him that was his word it
[1:04:39] was his life and it was predestinated
[1:04:41] there laying there
[1:04:43] waiting until that word come and sought
[1:04:45] me out
[1:04:46] came and sought you out come and spoke
[1:04:48] to your heart you wonder why you weren't
[1:04:50] happy anywhere else
[1:04:51] you wonder why you weren't happy there
[1:04:53] in the world why because there was a
[1:04:54] deep calling to a deep
[1:04:56] and there was a deep to respond and that
[1:04:58] was the message of the hour
[1:04:59] it was christ coming and revealing
[1:05:02] himself to you
[1:05:05] other seeds that just would come
[1:05:08] couldn't take hold
[1:05:10] just couldn't do it but when that seed
[1:05:12] come in quickly it stopped up the womb
[1:05:14] all the rest of the seeds was drove out
[1:05:16] and you become a prisoner surrounded in
[1:05:18] christ christ in you
[1:05:20] his life bringing forth his evidences
[1:05:23] his signs oh my my my look
[1:05:27] bringing his signs of life as evidence
[1:05:31] of his resurrection proving to the world
[1:05:34] that eternal life vindicates to the
[1:05:37] world that we're alive in him
[1:05:38] well that's a packed quote but we're
[1:05:42] talking about what this message is
[1:05:43] producing
[1:05:44] in you talking about receiving something
[1:05:48] from him and think of it alive with god
[1:05:51] our redeemer
[1:05:52] who created us for the very same purpose
[1:05:56] the church and his creative life
[1:05:59] is in us oh my brother matthew that
[1:06:02] sounds really good
[1:06:04] you sure picked a good quote there you
[1:06:06] know it sounds really good but i really
[1:06:07] don't see all these evidences and i
[1:06:09] don't see all these preeminences and i
[1:06:11] don't see all these signs and wonders in
[1:06:12] my life
[1:06:16] oh my it's quiet
[1:06:21] oh my if we do we we get out who's
[1:06:24] keeping score
[1:06:26] who's who's tracking their works
[1:06:30] i'm glad there's not a tally book
[1:06:34] the question is is do you believe it
[1:06:39] do you believe what he said
[1:06:43] i believe these signs shall follow them
[1:06:46] that belief i believe i believe i shall
[1:06:49] lay hands on the sick
[1:06:51] and they shall recover i believe i
[1:06:53] believe i have the ability
[1:06:55] through the shed blood of jesus christ
[1:06:56] and by the power of the holy ghost
[1:06:58] to lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:07:01] recover to cast out demons
[1:07:02] why because his word said so oh the
[1:07:06] devil will get you in a corner and he'll
[1:07:07] start to corner you out
[1:07:09] and try to try to beat you down but i
[1:07:11] just want to reassure you brothers and
[1:07:12] sisters
[1:07:13] if you got that faith there on the
[1:07:15] inside you keep holding to that word
[1:07:17] you keep believing that word don't make
[1:07:19] excuses
[1:07:20] don't start to chalk it up well maybe he
[1:07:22] meant something else
[1:07:24] we've seen a sheath wave we've seen one
[1:07:27] come and manifest this word
[1:07:29] with power and demonstration with the
[1:07:32] spoken word with the third pull on
[1:07:33] display
[1:07:34] with that token life showed us how to
[1:07:37] live it
[1:07:38] proved it god proving his word
[1:07:42] such a transparent life all the way down
[1:07:45] to where
[1:07:46] if he would have told his wife oh just
[1:07:48] tell him just just tell him i'm not here
[1:07:49] and it would go out
[1:07:54] god captured that for us for a purpose
[1:07:57] to show us what kind of life it takes to
[1:08:00] show us what kind of life it produces
[1:08:03] you can't get by with little white lies
[1:08:06] i was telling the brother something
[1:08:08] happened
[1:08:09] to me the other day i called a customer
[1:08:11] and and i called him
[1:08:12] i didn't i can't remember their names
[1:08:14] i'll just see bob and sharon
[1:08:16] and the phone answered and and bob
[1:08:18] answers phone hello i'm like hey bob
[1:08:20] it's like oh oh no this is sherry
[1:08:23] oh sorry i can't hear you uh
[1:08:26] hello hello oh sherry
[1:08:30] well i got done with the call and
[1:08:33] something come on my heart and was like
[1:08:35] that wasn't right well it wasn't right i
[1:08:38] you told her you could you couldn't hear
[1:08:41] you could hear her just fine
[1:08:44] you mean i got to make that right yeah
[1:08:47] that wasn't right so i had to make it
[1:08:50] right
[1:08:51] so i looked for the opportunity and god
[1:08:53] gave me the opportunity and
[1:08:54] and i told her i said sherry i just i
[1:08:56] just wanted to let you know that uh
[1:08:58] i wanted to make it right the other day
[1:09:00] when i told you
[1:09:01] i i'm mistaking you for for bob i i said
[1:09:04] i couldn't
[1:09:05] hear you uh because i was embarrassed
[1:09:07] that i thought i thought you were bob
[1:09:10] and she was like oh it happens to me all
[1:09:12] the time you don't worry about it i tell
[1:09:14] you what
[1:09:14] god bless you it's good to have
[1:09:16] christians that care or something like
[1:09:17] that and all of a sudden it turned into
[1:09:18] a little exchange
[1:09:20] where she was appreciative that there
[1:09:21] was people with character and i thought
[1:09:23] praise god that i didn't shriek from my
[1:09:25] responsibility
[1:09:26] but look god's interested in everything
[1:09:29] we
[1:09:29] do and say we must be portraying the
[1:09:32] very life
[1:09:34] and the very essence of jesus christ
[1:09:38] that's what the preeminence is that's
[1:09:40] what the message is producing
[1:09:42] is where the very zoe life of god has
[1:09:45] come into your tabernacle
[1:09:47] and he is taking complete control of
[1:09:49] your thoughts
[1:09:50] of your actions of your hands of your
[1:09:52] feet
[1:09:53] of your mouth of your eyes to where you
[1:09:55] can speak the word
[1:09:56] and we saw a sheaf wave among us that
[1:09:59] was so surrendered out to god
[1:10:01] that when god would speak to him he
[1:10:03] would walk straight in the face of death
[1:10:06] knowing it would cause him his life but
[1:10:09] oh he had been molded
[1:10:11] he had been shaped he had suffered
[1:10:15] i don't know why this saying comes to my
[1:10:17] mind now it's maybe not a good one but
[1:10:19] they say
[1:10:19] a smart man learns from his mistakes
[1:10:23] but a wise man learns from others
[1:10:25] mistakes i pray oh god
[1:10:27] thank you for for the prophet's life
[1:10:31] thank you for your life that you lived
[1:10:33] out in the prophet's life
[1:10:34] so i could see an example so i can see
[1:10:37] what your word is
[1:10:38] asking of me and not in myself that i
[1:10:41] have to produce it
[1:10:42] but it's showing me what this word can
[1:10:44] produce
[1:10:45] therefore as a believer look we don't
[1:10:47] shrink from that it's something to look
[1:10:49] forward to
[1:10:51] i think that's the problem many of us
[1:10:53] are shying away from the challenge
[1:10:56] oh you mean that's what the word
[1:10:57] requires you and i go i got
[1:10:59] you know i got to lay hands on the sick
[1:11:00] and they recover and you mean i i
[1:11:02] i got to be perfect well you know i kind
[1:11:05] of comfortable over here in my little
[1:11:06] zone you know i got my good job
[1:11:08] i'm in ladies everything's just right i
[1:11:10] got i got the message
[1:11:11] everything i got church three times a
[1:11:13] week everything everything's good even
[1:11:15] kovit didn't get me i got my mask and
[1:11:17] i'm working from home and i think i'm
[1:11:19] making it i'm doing pretty good
[1:11:21] i'm in my comfort zone we should be
[1:11:23] embracing the challenge
[1:11:26] they should be testifying you might as
[1:11:28] well turn some people's head sideways
[1:11:30] here and there because it's going to
[1:11:31] happen but
[1:11:31] hey did you know i'm going to go in a
[1:11:33] rapture did you know this body's going
[1:11:35] to be changed
[1:11:38] you might just find out somebody's
[1:11:39] hungry for what you got
[1:11:44] i i you look brother branham had
[1:11:47] countless converts
[1:11:48] just out in his normal daily life
[1:11:53] countless converts i who knows
[1:11:56] who knows and i think we should have
[1:11:58] that same heart
[1:12:00] today i was just in in my office
[1:12:03] studying i looked out and this
[1:12:06] this guy was walking down the street and
[1:12:09] you know
[1:12:10] if he showed up and you're in the back
[1:12:11] praise god but
[1:12:13] he he looked rugged i mean he done a lot
[1:12:15] of time and
[1:12:16] he had a lot of ink on him and he passed
[1:12:19] this guy
[1:12:21] running and and i presume that the guy
[1:12:23] that passed him wasn't trying to be
[1:12:26] rude he just probably is trying to
[1:12:27] analyze what he just saw
[1:12:30] and kept looking back like did i really
[1:12:31] just see that well the other guy was
[1:12:33] looking back at him too and also when he
[1:12:36] turns around he's back peddling and i've
[1:12:37] seen this before right
[1:12:40] so i'm like oh man all right so so i
[1:12:42] walk out i walk out the house i'm like
[1:12:44] what's going on man you about to throw
[1:12:46] hands or something

[1:12:50] me man he was looking at me crazy and i
[1:12:51] was almost like well yeah
[1:12:55] but we we just got we just got to
[1:12:57] talking
[1:12:58] and uh rugged but i just told him he
[1:13:01] needed god and goes you know what i
[1:13:02] believe that's the truth i should be
[1:13:04] dead

[1:13:06] anybody out but we could we can do our
[1:13:09] best to just be a light
[1:13:11] in everything if even if look i tell you
[1:13:14] what
[1:13:14] you know who you got to be a witness the
[1:13:15] most to is yourself
[1:13:19] you you need to be a witness to yours
[1:13:21] young people you need to grab this
[1:13:23] little flesh

[1:13:42] i know you ought to just say you know
[1:13:44] what self come here we're serving god
[1:13:47] it's time to go to church it's time to

[1:13:52] to go in the body church i'm sick and
[1:13:54] tired
[1:13:54] of you flesh man keeping me from the
[1:13:56] promises of god
[1:13:58] where's the greatest battle ever fought
[1:14:00] who's your greatest enemy ought yourself
[1:14:04] the devil's already defeated he's just
[1:14:06] playing and catering to your mind to try
[1:14:08] to make you think things are real that
[1:14:10] aren't even real
[1:14:11] there's only one thing that's real and
[1:14:13] that's what he said
[1:14:15] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:14:18] word
[1:14:18] shall never pass away and when you've
[1:14:20] received that word
[1:14:22] on the inside of your soul and you've
[1:14:24] got that revelation
[1:14:25] not something from man but something
[1:14:27] from god oh
[1:14:29] now you got something that has power
[1:14:33] now you got something that's real now
[1:14:36] you got something to witness about now
[1:14:37] you got something to testify
[1:14:39] now you can go down to egypt like moses
[1:14:41] did now you can stand there in the face
[1:14:43] of all the sadducees and pharisees
[1:14:45] and all them leaders of the day like
[1:14:47] paul and why because it's not
[1:14:49] paul's life it's not moses life it's the
[1:14:51] very life of god
[1:14:52] and it's the very life of god that's
[1:14:54] living on the inside of the bride of
[1:14:56] jesus christ
[1:14:57] oh hallelujah the same life that was in
[1:15:00] our prophet
[1:15:01] will produce the same works the same
[1:15:03] signs the same wonders
[1:15:04] the same humility the same sincerity
[1:15:08] in you do you believe it
[1:15:20] you cannot see the kingdom of god unless
[1:15:23] you've been born again
[1:15:31] we always want to invite you be born
[1:15:34] again
[1:15:36] things ain't adding up maybe that's
[1:15:39] where you need to start
[1:15:42] you have nothing to lose and everything
[1:15:43] to gain i can promise you that
[1:15:47] first corinthians 2 9.
[1:15:51] but as it is written i have not seen nor
[1:15:55] ear heard
[1:15:57] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:15:59] man the things which god hath prepared
[1:16:02] for them that love him
[1:16:06] but just keep reading but god
[1:16:10] hath revealed them to us by his spirit
[1:16:15] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[1:16:18] the deep things of god
[1:16:20] for what man knoweth the things of man
[1:16:23] save the spirit of
[1:16:24] man which is in him
[1:16:28] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:16:30] but the spirit of god
[1:16:32] so what a person perceives what he knows
[1:16:34] and what he's understanding is by the
[1:16:35] spirit that's within him
[1:16:37] look you filter everything through your
[1:16:39] life experiences
[1:16:40] you filter what you're what you go
[1:16:43] through and
[1:16:44] and you know i mean there's people that
[1:16:45] are afraid of dogs why are they afraid
[1:16:47] of dogs well they probably had a bad
[1:16:48] experience with a dog before
[1:16:51] you find out the reason why people are
[1:16:54] like certain things and dislike certain
[1:16:55] things
[1:16:56] you know or maybe certain cultures wide
[1:16:58] because it's something
[1:16:59] that's been taught to them or it's been
[1:17:01] something that they've learned it's
[1:17:02] something
[1:17:03] they've grown up with life experiences
[1:17:06] and and you can only me what
[1:17:09] the things you're dealing with and the
[1:17:11] things that you're experiencing
[1:17:12] you can only identify with that by the
[1:17:15] spirit that's within you
[1:17:18] you can only interact and react with it
[1:17:20] by that spirit that's within you
[1:17:22] and that's the very thing where where
[1:17:24] the devil tries to take all these
[1:17:26] uh things of your past or things of your
[1:17:28] uh your
[1:17:29] your childhood or things that you've
[1:17:30] grown up with and that's what the devil
[1:17:32] tries to use against you
[1:17:34] he tries to tap into those those
[1:17:36] memories he tries to tap
[1:17:38] into that past he tries to tap into that
[1:17:40] life of sin he tries to
[1:17:42] draw back into your memory back into
[1:17:44] your mind
[1:17:45] oh i say pray pray god give me a mind
[1:17:47] like your mind lord
[1:17:48] let me start forgetting those things
[1:17:50] lord may you just wash my mind and
[1:17:53] purify my mind oh because you'll be
[1:17:55] going along and all of a sudden
[1:17:56] uh something will remind you and also
[1:17:58] you'll be back in that spot you'll be
[1:18:00] back in that place
[1:18:01] and satan will pull something back up in
[1:18:03] your mind and we got to be careful we
[1:18:04] got to be guarded we got to realize we
[1:18:06] don't want to identify with those things
[1:18:08] we don't want to resurrect that dead man
[1:18:17] this might be an odd way of saying this
[1:18:18] but when a man receives something then
[1:18:21] it's man doing something
[1:18:24] when a man receives something then it's
[1:18:27] man
[1:18:28] doing something and maybe for a poor
[1:18:30] example you know if you
[1:18:32] if you hire if you hire a carpenter
[1:18:36] or you hire a plumber to do your tree
[1:18:38] work
[1:18:40] you've hired a plumber to do tree work
[1:18:41] you're probably not going to get the
[1:18:43] right results
[1:18:45] right so when man when you when man by
[1:18:48] the spirit of man
[1:18:50] and by the intellect of man takes the
[1:18:52] word of god
[1:18:54] and tries to manifest it
[1:18:57] you're going to get the wrong picture so
[1:19:00] when man
[1:19:02] receives something then it's man doing
[1:19:04] something that's
[1:19:05] exactly what moses did moses had
[1:19:08] received
[1:19:09] what he had heard he knew where he had
[1:19:13] come from
[1:19:14] he knew that his people were in bondage
[1:19:15] and moses knew that they would be
[1:19:17] delivered so what did moses do moses
[1:19:19] thought all right
[1:19:20] let me try to let me try to jump in here
[1:19:22] and see if i can help
[1:19:23] but it was man trying to fulfill the
[1:19:26] word of god
[1:19:27] so when the word of god comes if
[1:19:31] the word of god comes when if it's just
[1:19:33] man receiving it and then man trying to
[1:19:35] do it it's man doing it
[1:19:36] but we want to move past we want to move
[1:19:39] past the spirit of man we want to move
[1:19:42] past the intellectual thought
[1:19:44] we want to move to where that word that
[1:19:46] you received oh
[1:19:47] that's fine if you know the the mind is
[1:19:50] the womb to the spirit
[1:19:51] we have to allow the word of god to come
[1:19:53] into these gates
[1:19:54] oh but we don't want it to stop there
[1:19:58] we we want to listen to the word and i
[1:20:00] think so many times
[1:20:01] where we might get ourselves in trouble
[1:20:03] and i've had to to to learn and to wait
[1:20:05] on the lord
[1:20:06] well i'll read something and i'll get
[1:20:08] all of excited and i want to share it
[1:20:09] share it with a brother why don't you
[1:20:12] share with your lord jesus christ a
[1:20:14] little while
[1:20:15] why don't you wait on the lord and see
[1:20:17] what he's trying to show you
[1:20:18] and what he's trying to reveal but oh we
[1:20:20] get so excited and also we want to run
[1:20:22] this way just want to just wait upon the
[1:20:24] lord a little while
[1:20:26] and i found out sometimes while i waited
[1:20:27] upon the lord that it was just my mind
[1:20:30] getting all excited
[1:20:32] i started to run it out a little bit and
[1:20:34] wait on the lord and realize oh
[1:20:36] okay lord i see now
[1:20:40] i that was my intellect trying to plug
[1:20:43] things two things together that didn't
[1:20:44] come together
[1:20:46] oh i i've been inspired i'm like oh man
[1:20:48] this is great let's see what the prophet
[1:20:49] said about it
[1:20:51] like where did i get that inspiration
[1:20:55] oh we need to pray church
[1:20:58] we need to listen with sincerity
[1:21:01] with earnestness and pray and say god
[1:21:04] reveal yourself to me because that's
[1:21:06] what we want we want that word now to
[1:21:07] drop down into the soul
[1:21:09] oh when it drops down there brother then
[1:21:12] it's no longer
[1:21:13] man receiving something it's the god
[1:21:15] inside of you receiving his own word
[1:21:19] oh hallelujah that that's that's when
[1:21:22] phase final resting place is in the word
[1:21:23] of god now something's quickened
[1:21:25] now something comes to life
[1:21:29] we just need to surrender and be humble
[1:21:32] be sincere look god will bring his word
[1:21:36] to pass
[1:21:37] those that wait upon the lord they shall
[1:21:40] mount up with wings
[1:21:42] like an eagle they shall run they shall
[1:21:44] not faint
[1:21:46] look god has given the promise
[1:21:49] we believe it keep believing it keep
[1:21:53] staying with it
[1:21:54] keep waiting upon the lord oh like
[1:21:58] eagles you're going to mount up brother
[1:22:01] branham tells a story about
[1:22:04] one time he was out hunting on the
[1:22:05] mountainside
[1:22:07] and i believe a little little rain came
[1:22:09] by and he kind of tried to find a little
[1:22:11] cover as for some trees and it
[1:22:13] it had gone on by and i believe the sun
[1:22:15] was starting to come back out and shine
[1:22:17] a little bit
[1:22:17] and oh brother brandon was just looking
[1:22:19] around and he started to look down there
[1:22:21] and all of a sudden
[1:22:22] he he saw a rainbow come out across the
[1:22:24] valley there
[1:22:25] and he started just thinking of
[1:22:26] revelations four he's to look upon like
[1:22:28] sardis and jasper and
[1:22:30] he had a rainbow above his head he said
[1:22:32] austin he heard the coyote holler up
[1:22:34] from the canyon there
[1:22:35] and oh he just started seeing god and
[1:22:37] everything he just started to get so
[1:22:39] excited
[1:22:39] brother brandon just started running
[1:22:41] around the tree oh he'd stop and look at
[1:22:43] how he started running around the tree

[1:23:14] because i got so excited and i was
[1:23:16] running around the tree
[1:23:17] and then he noticed he said oh no he
[1:23:19] wasn't excited about me
[1:23:21] there was a little eagle that got come
[1:23:23] down out of the storm there and he said
[1:23:24] he was
[1:23:25] kind of finding some shelter under some
[1:23:26] blow down trees that
[1:23:28] had blown down in a storm as that eagle
[1:23:30] had just come out from amongst those
[1:23:31] trees and

[1:23:55] this eagle
[1:23:56] and he started to look at the eagle and
[1:23:58] he goes oh yeah
[1:24:00] okay maybe because it's it's brave
[1:24:03] yeah the eagle's brave and god

[1:24:15] he says that that's what it is he goes
[1:24:17] huh he's brave though
[1:24:19] i wonder why he's so brave and he's like
[1:24:21] thinking you know what

[1:24:26] maybe put his hand on his gun but say
[1:24:27] you know i'd never do that
[1:24:28] i hear that squirrel keeps going chatter
[1:24:30] chatter chatter chatter
[1:24:32] and brother branham says you know i
[1:24:33] noticed something though every little
[1:24:35] bit he'd step he kind of
[1:24:37] he kind of flutter his wings a little
[1:24:39] bit and he said that's it
[1:24:42] that's it before i could even get my gun
[1:24:45] up
[1:24:46] and shoot that eagle he would just set
[1:24:48] his wings and fly
[1:24:51] and brother branham starts to dramatize
[1:24:52] how old he just
[1:24:54] he got sick of listening to all the
[1:24:55] chatter of that squirrel he got sick of
[1:24:57] listening to all the chatter of the
[1:24:59] world
[1:24:59] he got sick to listen all the chatter of
[1:25:01] covet 19. he got sick of listening all
[1:25:03] the chatter of the economy
[1:25:05] he got sick of listening all the chatter
[1:25:06] of trump and biden
[1:25:08] he got tired and sick and tired of
[1:25:10] listening to everything
[1:25:12] and all the confusion in the world that
[1:25:14] all of a sudden
[1:25:15] that little pine squirrel chatted for
[1:25:17] the last time and that eagle just
[1:25:19] jumped and flopped his wings just a
[1:25:20] couple of times and the prophet says oh
[1:25:22] he just set his wings
[1:25:25] and mary lifted higher and higher above
[1:25:28] all the confusion
[1:25:29] above all the nonsense above all the
[1:25:31] noise all and
[1:25:33] you know god's prophets are likened on
[1:25:35] the eagles but you the bride are liking
[1:25:37] on the eagles also
[1:25:38] we just need to set our wings to the
[1:25:40] winds of faith and just keep rising
[1:25:43] higher
[1:25:43] and higher into heavenly places in jesus
[1:25:46] christ
[1:25:47] oh just wait upon the lord keep trusting
[1:25:51] keep believing
[1:25:55] it's continuing on in that scripture
[1:26:02] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:26:04] the world but the spirit which is of god
[1:26:07] that we might know the things that are
[1:26:09] freely given to us
[1:26:10] of god you we could spend forever right
[1:26:14] there
[1:26:15] that we might know the things that are
[1:26:17] freely given to us of god
[1:26:20] everything that you have need of freely
[1:26:22] given your joy
[1:26:24] your peace your salvation gentleness
[1:26:27] kindness meekness godliness
[1:26:29] temperance patience love faith
[1:26:33] everything everything he's freely giving
[1:26:36] it to us
[1:26:37] which things also we speak not in words
[1:26:39] which man's wisdom teaches
[1:26:42] but which the holy ghost teaches
[1:26:43] comparing spiritual things with
[1:26:45] spiritual
[1:26:46] but the natural man receiveth not the
[1:26:48] things of the spirit of god for they are
[1:26:49] foolishness unto him
[1:26:51] neither can he know them because they
[1:26:53] are spiritually discerned
[1:26:55] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[1:26:57] things
[1:26:58] yet he himself is judged of no man for
[1:27:01] who hath known the mind of the lord
[1:27:04] that he may instruct him but we have
[1:27:07] the mind of christ look we have
[1:27:11] the mind of christ not just a portion of
[1:27:13] the word
[1:27:14] we have the fullness of the word
[1:27:18] no man is telling us what we can believe
[1:27:21] we don't have some religion or some
[1:27:22] denomination telling us we can only go
[1:27:24] so far
[1:27:25] we don't have some organization or some
[1:27:27] man to answer to we have the word of god
[1:27:29] to answer to
[1:27:31] and it's in the word where everything is
[1:27:33] freely given to us that we're more than
[1:27:35] conquerors
[1:27:35] in jesus christ all we got to do is take
[1:27:39] him
[1:27:39] at his word look we have been
[1:27:43] resurrected from dead unbelief in his
[1:27:44] word
[1:27:45] that's what the denominational ages have
[1:27:47] had before us
[1:27:49] they've been able to only go so far but
[1:27:52] jesus christ has come again
[1:27:55] by divine promise look and as i say this
[1:27:58] as we've been speaking about not
[1:27:59] received a man
[1:28:00] we don't want to miss the program of god
[1:28:03] because the scripture says in amos 3 7
[1:28:05] surely the lord god will do nothing
[1:28:07] but he revealeth his secrets unto his
[1:28:10] servants
[1:28:11] the prophets so you got to receive the
[1:28:13] word
[1:28:14] the manifested word which it was the
[1:28:15] word coming through the mouthpiece
[1:28:18] of the prophet so if you don't read if
[1:28:20] you don't accept
[1:28:21] or receive that word the way it was
[1:28:24] manifested you're not receiving him
[1:28:26] you're not receiving the word from god
[1:28:29] but we've got to get in line with god's
[1:28:31] program we have received
[1:28:33] the promise of the hour look at this
[1:28:36] message has been vindicated
[1:28:37] just as paul was struck down by a pillar
[1:28:40] of fire just as
[1:28:41] moses uh met a pillar fire in a burning
[1:28:43] bush and there they were led by a cloud
[1:28:45] by day and a pillar of fire but i
[1:28:47] this message has been vindicated by a
[1:28:49] pillar of fire
[1:28:51] none other for 2 000 years the church
[1:28:53] had been gone
[1:28:54] without a prophet but according to
[1:28:56] divine promise in malachi 4
[1:28:57] luke 17 30 the very things that we're
[1:29:00] familiar with god has once again come
[1:29:02] amongst his people
[1:29:03] and he has been resurrected among us so
[1:29:05] we can live that same very life
[1:29:09] yet a little while in the world seeth me
[1:29:11] no more
[1:29:12] but ye see me because i live you live
[1:29:16] also
[1:29:17] look church you can do the greater works
[1:29:20] you are placed here to do the greater
[1:29:23] works
[1:29:26] look don't shrink away from it don't we
[1:29:29] don't have to make excuses like well
[1:29:31] um this happened over here and that
[1:29:33] happened over here and
[1:29:35] and try to add it up well we're doing
[1:29:36] the greater works look
[1:29:38] god brings his god reveals his word by
[1:29:41] bringing it to pass
[1:29:43] just continue to believe it know that
[1:29:45] you're walking in it
[1:29:47] and he will manifest it just like our
[1:29:49] prophet our pastor was talking about
[1:29:51] how god will allow circumstances god
[1:29:53] will allow
[1:29:54] situations to arise in your life where
[1:29:56] that word that's in you will come into
[1:29:58] manifestation
[1:30:00] we don't have to go out looking for it
[1:30:01] you just keep playing your part
[1:30:03] you can just keep doing what you know to
[1:30:05] do you just continue to be faithful
[1:30:07] you just continue to be sincere you just
[1:30:08] continue to believe and these things
[1:30:10] will start to unfold in your life
[1:30:13] look abraham was not weak in faith
[1:30:17] the scripture says abraham was not weak
[1:30:19] in faith and i was thinking about that
[1:30:20] you want to know why he wasn't weak in
[1:30:21] faith he didn't receive a weak promise
[1:30:25] it wasn't weak in faith because he
[1:30:26] didn't receive a weak promise
[1:30:28] there's some people if they tell you
[1:30:29] they're going to do something it's kind
[1:30:30] of a weak promise
[1:30:32] hey i'll be over there at five
[1:30:36] well there's some people that tell you
[1:30:38] they'll be there five you know they'll
[1:30:40] be there at 4
[1:30:40] 50. maybe we'll just get on church
[1:30:45] church starts at 5. there's some people
[1:30:48] you know that'll be here at church at 4
[1:30:49] 30 or 4 40.
[1:30:51] there's some people that'll be walking
[1:30:53] in or they won't even come back because
[1:30:54] we're talking about five that would be a
[1:30:55] sunday evening
[1:30:57] and right now we're not even having that
[1:30:58] so let's change days but you see the
[1:31:00] point
[1:31:02] there's just some people you know if
[1:31:03] they say they're going to be somewhere
[1:31:04] yet you kind of see their
[1:31:05] their track record oh but but
[1:31:08] abraham he was strong
[1:31:12] in faith because he knew who made the
[1:31:15] promise
[1:31:16] was able to perform it
[1:31:20] so there abraham didn't consider
[1:31:24] by intellectual knowledge his condition
[1:31:28] his age it says he didn't consider his
[1:31:30] own body dead
[1:31:31] and the deadness of sarah's womb he
[1:31:34] didn't even consider those things the
[1:31:35] only thing he considered
[1:31:38] was who made the promise and i believe
[1:31:40] that's the same thing for the bride of
[1:31:42] jesus christ who was it that appeared in
[1:31:45] this generation
[1:31:46] who was it that spoke the word who was
[1:31:48] it that made the promise
[1:31:49] who's the one that said you're going to
[1:31:51] body change who's the one that said
[1:31:53] you're going a rapture
[1:31:56] that wasn't a man
[1:31:59] that was more than a man that was god
[1:32:01] himself
[1:32:02] or what did the prophet say i'm just a
[1:32:04] mute
[1:32:06] the microphone's just a mute it has no
[1:32:09] ability to speak for itself but i have
[1:32:11] to have a voice come
[1:32:12] we got to listen to the voice of the
[1:32:14] sign
[1:32:16] it was god speaking and we've received a
[1:32:19] message from god
[1:32:23] oh i love what our pastor said he said
[1:32:27] if you possess the promise
[1:32:31] you possess the results if you possess
[1:32:34] the promise
[1:32:35] you present whole glory to god i possess
[1:32:37] the promise
[1:32:39] i received the promise that means i got
[1:32:42] the results
[1:32:42] you're looking at rapture results you're
[1:32:45] looking at body change results you're
[1:32:47] looking at healed results
[1:32:48] glory to god i'm healed why because i
[1:32:50] received the promise
[1:32:56] we read what things soever ye desire
[1:32:58] when you pray
[1:32:59] believe that you receive them and you
[1:33:02] shall have them all things are possible
[1:33:04] to him that believe
[1:33:10] look when you've received it from god i
[1:33:11] don't care how long it takes
[1:33:16] i don't care how long it takes you think
[1:33:17] of the story of daniel
[1:33:20] daniel there in the chapter 10 he was
[1:33:22] praying
[1:33:23] he was he was wanting to hear from god
[1:33:28] and finally after three weeks i believe
[1:33:31] the angel shows up and says hey daniel
[1:33:34] i would have been here sooner
[1:33:38] but i had some trouble getting here i
[1:33:40] ran into some adversaries along the way
[1:33:44] see the prophet takes that scripture and
[1:33:46] says look
[1:33:47] sometimes it might take a little while
[1:33:49] for the results
[1:33:51] but you just need to keep standing upon
[1:33:53] the word
[1:33:56] look i i love what our pastor preached
[1:33:58] to put yourself in the story
[1:34:02] put yourself okay if daniel was praying
[1:34:05] for something
[1:34:06] and believing for something and if you
[1:34:08] can see the transparency here the
[1:34:10] angel's on his way
[1:34:14] and yet it took a little while for him
[1:34:16] to get there oh put yourself with us or
[1:34:18] maybe you're praying for something
[1:34:20] maybe you're believing for something put
[1:34:22] yourself in the story
[1:34:23] i was just thinking about that all one
[1:34:25] time brother branham was leaving dallas
[1:34:27] and he was flying over and a storm came
[1:34:30] up and his plane got grounded in memphis
[1:34:34] and there he is he he's in his room he
[1:34:36] he says oh i could have i could have
[1:34:38] i could have never stayed in that i
[1:34:39] would have never stayed in that nice
[1:34:40] hotel a peabody hotel there in memphis
[1:34:43] i'd have never stayed in that but you
[1:34:44] know the airlines it got grounded and
[1:34:46] they were the ones putting us up in the
[1:34:47] room and so
[1:34:47] so i was put up in the room and and
[1:34:49] while i was there i thought i'd send out
[1:34:50] i'd pray over some
[1:34:51] prayer cloths and it's a prayer request
[1:34:53] and i'd go put them in the mail the next
[1:34:55] morning so
[1:34:56] he comes out of the hotel he's going to
[1:34:57] walk over the post office and he's going
[1:34:59] there and he's walking along and
[1:35:01] something tells him to turn and go back
[1:35:02] and he's like uh
[1:35:04] you know maybe that's just my own
[1:35:06] thinking
[1:35:07] oh my you mean that happened to the
[1:35:09] prophet too you mean all those times you
[1:35:11] felt that little holy unction to testify
[1:35:13] to this person
[1:35:14] or to wait a little bit longer at the
[1:35:16] house or to do this or that
[1:35:18] you mean that that could be the holy
[1:35:19] ghost
[1:35:21] he as many as are the sons of god
[1:35:23] they're led by the spirit of god
[1:35:24] god wants to lead you just like he let
[1:35:27] us profit
[1:35:29] oh we don't have a no we don't have the
[1:35:30] office of a prophet but you take to
[1:35:32] heart to what we're saying
[1:35:34] and he started to go along and all of a
[1:35:36] sudden hear the
[1:35:39] and the prophet says he stopped and he
[1:35:42] started to pray
[1:35:43] and say lord what would you have your
[1:35:44] servant do
[1:35:47] and then he stood there for 60 seconds
[1:35:48] and went back to his room no
[1:35:50] he says he stayed there and he says
[1:35:53] he stood there for about 15 20 minutes
[1:35:55] just staying right there
[1:35:57] and the lord told him turn back and go
[1:35:59] this way the prophet start turns around
[1:36:02] he's
[1:36:02] he passes the hotel and he comes up over
[1:36:04] a ridge and i believe he starts
[1:36:06] walking down he starts getting down into
[1:36:08] just some some of the older
[1:36:09] neighborhoods and
[1:36:11] he calls them shanties or i can't
[1:36:12] remember the word he used for those
[1:36:13] homes he starts coming down towards the
[1:36:15] river
[1:36:15] and he starts coming down to this
[1:36:17] neighbor he's like lord i wonder where
[1:36:18] you're leading me
[1:36:20] lord where am i going and he comes on
[1:36:23] down the way there and the prophet he
[1:36:25] said is i
[1:36:26] there are people almost everywhere whose
[1:36:28] hearts are all aflame
[1:36:29] with the fire that fell at pentecost
[1:36:31] he's just singing some little song you
[1:36:33] know just some little tune just
[1:36:34] going down he's he's coming in this
[1:36:36] whole neighborhood there and he
[1:36:38] he looks up and and uh he sees down the
[1:36:40] way there's
[1:36:41] he calls it calls it like an aunt jemima
[1:36:44] just
[1:36:44] an auntie sees that t you know over
[1:36:46] there just leaning over
[1:36:48] about 100 yards away leaning over a
[1:36:49] white picket fence and he says
[1:36:51] he just said i just stopped i just
[1:36:53] stopped to
[1:36:54] i just stopped singing but i just kept
[1:36:56] walking along and
[1:36:58] i got a little bit closer and tears were
[1:37:01] rolling off of her
[1:37:02] big fat cheeks he says and she looked up
[1:37:04] with a smile and she goes
[1:37:05] good morning parsons
[1:37:09] and he goes oh morning he goes well uh
[1:37:12] say how did you know i was a parsons
[1:37:15] well you ever read that story in the
[1:37:18] bible about the shunamite woman

[1:38:08] walking on down the road
[1:38:12] oh glory to god she'd put herself in the
[1:38:15] story

[1:38:18] this door and he says well
[1:38:20] and she goes and proceeds to tell me you
[1:38:22] know last night i was praying
[1:38:24] and i had a dream of you coming down the
[1:38:26] road wearing your hat in a brown suit

[1:38:41] door there and he said god bless our
[1:38:42] home
[1:38:44] and he come in and she started to
[1:38:45] explain the condition there and
[1:38:47] say oh oh oh parcel i just can't stand

[1:39:02] and pray first he says oh my
[1:39:05] if you ever heard somebody that knew how
[1:39:07] to pray she started to pray and plead
[1:39:09] her case before god
[1:39:12] i want to read something in daniel
[1:39:17] in daniel 12 at daniel chapter 10 verse
[1:39:20] 12 says then saith
[1:39:22] said he unto me fear not daniel
[1:39:26] for from the first day that thou didst
[1:39:28] set thine heart to understand
[1:39:30] and to chasten myself before god thy
[1:39:33] words were heard
[1:39:36] and i am come for thy words
[1:39:39] how god hears your words he hears your
[1:39:42] prayer
[1:39:43] he heard the prayer of that little aunty
[1:39:44] that said i was like that shooting my
[1:39:46] woman
[1:39:47] and there she was receiving the very
[1:39:50] fulfillment of her prayer
[1:39:53] finished praying the prophet god said
[1:39:55] lord this must be it i don't even know
[1:39:58] i don't even know why why you sit me
[1:40:01] down
[1:40:01] i don't even know what's going to happen
[1:40:02] i just know i'm here and he starts
[1:40:04] praying lord would you heal him
[1:40:06] and all of a sudden he started going
[1:40:08] it's getting light in here
[1:40:09] and within five minutes time he was
[1:40:11] sitting up there hugging his mother
[1:40:14] oh my god god was coming for her words
[1:40:17] god's coming for your words
[1:40:19] you keep believing you keep standing
[1:40:21] upon that promise
[1:40:23] i'm reminded of of the prophet talks
[1:40:26] about these
[1:40:26] neighbors ladies who come through the
[1:40:28] prayer line
[1:40:30] and one of them had an ulcer in her
[1:40:32] stomach

[1:40:35] as she come through the angel of the
[1:40:36] lord pronounced or healed
[1:40:38] and said go home and eat
[1:40:41] and then a few a few people down the
[1:40:44] line i believe it was it happened to be
[1:40:46] her neighbor
[1:40:47] and she also came through the line and
[1:40:49] she had a a
[1:40:50] a growth on her neck a couple inches of
[1:40:53] a sizable growth that was
[1:40:55] that was visible on her neck and the
[1:40:56] angel lord pronounced that she was
[1:40:58] healed
[1:40:59] said go on your way and believe well
[1:41:02] that lady
[1:41:03] who who had that ulcer in her stomach
[1:41:05] you know the angel lord told her
[1:41:07] go on home and eat so she went home you
[1:41:09] know what she did
[1:41:10] she ate but she couldn't quite she
[1:41:13] couldn't keep it down
[1:41:15] she would eat it and she would vomit it
[1:41:16] back up oh and she was believing god
[1:41:20] but there was no sign of her healing
[1:41:24] one week went by two weeks went by and
[1:41:27] three weeks went by
[1:41:29] one morning her husband said honey i
[1:41:32] think you're becoming a reproach to
[1:41:34] jesus christ
[1:41:37] oh that poor little lady there just
[1:41:39] believing what god had told her
[1:41:42] the prophet says if you're professing
[1:41:45] if you're confessing the word of god you
[1:41:47] can never be a reproach
[1:41:50] you say i'm healed i don't care how bad
[1:41:53] it looks
[1:41:55] that's a promise from almighty god and
[1:41:57] if you've received it from god
[1:41:59] and if you've prayed and you've asked
[1:42:00] him he's coming for your words
[1:42:04] [Applause]
[1:42:05] and all of a sudden here she was
[1:42:08] a couple more days went by she was
[1:42:12] standing there washing the dishes
[1:42:14] she was just crying lord i
[1:42:17] i know you said it lord i believe it
[1:42:21] she's not getting any better she's

[1:43:29] praising god
[1:43:31] and what did the prophet say
[1:43:34] the prophet of god said the angel of the
[1:43:37] lord

[1:44:26] i say that jesus christ is here
[1:44:30] i say if he can pass through a
[1:44:33] neighborhood

[1:44:38] upon a promise
[1:44:39] how much more can he pass through here
[1:44:42] tonight
[1:44:44] and speak to your heart speak to your
[1:44:46] need
[1:44:54] oh you're talking we're talking about
[1:44:55] not receiving something from man
[1:44:59] we have received something
[1:45:03] from god we've received a message from
[1:45:06] god
[1:45:06] we've received a divine promise from god
[1:45:08] we've received faith from god
[1:45:10] we received a revelation and nothing can
[1:45:13] take that away
[1:45:19] just to come back to our text as they
[1:45:21] play something softly
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:26] verse 12 says for neither
[1:45:30] i received it of man you know as i was
[1:45:35] just in the back you're about to come
[1:45:36] out i was reading my text
[1:45:39] and i started to think about that
[1:45:40] explosion and by root lebanon if any of
[1:45:42] y'all have
[1:45:43] seen it it just was on my heart i was
[1:45:45] been praying for the people there
[1:45:49] everybody just living a normal daily
[1:45:51] life
[1:45:53] coping with the signs of the times but
[1:45:56] just going through the routine and just
[1:45:58] like that
[1:46:00] a whole city completely obliterated
[1:46:03] changed
[1:46:05] why because the things of man are
[1:46:07] temporary
[1:46:08] if you're trusted in your job temporary
[1:46:13] you're trusting in your health the lord
[1:46:16] tarries
[1:46:17] look we get healed and get sick again
[1:46:21] we're waiting for the redemption of
[1:46:22] these bodies
[1:46:26] but i praise god he's allowed
[1:46:27] opportunity for us to experience his
[1:46:29] power
[1:46:31] to experience his grace to experience
[1:46:32] his healing power because that's what he
[1:46:34] wants to do is have fellowship
[1:46:37] neither was i taught it but by the
[1:46:39] revelation
[1:46:41] of jesus christ you have heard of my
[1:46:44] conversation and time passed in the
[1:46:46] jewish religion
[1:46:48] [Music]
[1:46:50] i pray god we come to a place where we
[1:46:52] say you know
[1:46:54] i remember in times past when i thought
[1:46:56] i had it all figured out
[1:46:58] i thought i had the message figured out
[1:47:00] kind of thought i knew what it was all
[1:47:02] about i
[1:47:03] kind of thought i had it all put
[1:47:04] together and i was zealous for it
[1:47:08] i left beyond measure i persecuted the
[1:47:10] church god and i wasted and profited in
[1:47:12] the jewish religion above my equals
[1:47:14] my own nation being more extremely
[1:47:17] zealous of traditions of my fathers
[1:47:19] but when it pleased god who separated me
[1:47:22] from my mother's womb and called me by
[1:47:24] his grace
[1:47:26] to reveal his son and me
[1:47:29] that i might preach him among the
[1:47:31] heathen immediately
[1:47:33] i conferred not with flesh and blood
[1:47:37] why he had a conference with god
[1:47:41] he had met god and he had had a
[1:47:44] revelation
[1:47:45] he didn't need to talk it over and see
[1:47:46] what other people's opinion was
[1:47:49] he didn't have to go to other people but
[1:47:52] paul was willing to die for the message
[1:47:56] and i say this message is worth dying
[1:47:58] for
[1:47:59] but you know what it's worth living for
[1:48:07] [Music]
[1:48:10] leave me lord i will fall
