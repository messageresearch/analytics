[54:53] he says for this melchizedek
[54:56] king of salem priest of the most high
[54:59] god
[55:01] who meant abraham returning from the
[55:04] slaughter of the kings
[55:06] and blessed him to whom also
[55:09] abraham gaveth a tenth part of all
[55:14] first being by interpretation king of
[55:18] righteousness and
[55:20] after that also king of salem which is
[55:23] king of peace
[55:25] without father without mother
[55:28] without descent having neither beginning
[55:32] of
[55:32] days nor ending of life
[55:35] but maiden like unto the son of god
[55:39] abideth a priest continually
[55:42] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[55:44] word to us this morning
[55:46] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[55:50] god bless you you may be seated this
[55:52] morning and
[55:55] um
[55:59] we're just going to uh
[56:02] have a little kind of a bible
[56:06] type study this morning and
[56:10] as we we told you last week we
[56:14] talked a little bit about uh
[56:18] that we were going to minister on the
[56:20] subject
[56:22] present tense manifestation
[56:25] present tense manifestation and we
[56:30] challenged you all to maybe think of
[56:33] that
[56:33] in your mind a little bit of
[56:36] what it might be or what that you might
[56:40] think is a present tense
[56:44] manifestation and so we want to continue
[56:47] on our our subject that we've been
[56:50] uh talking about and ministering about
[56:54] about uh this present tense
[56:58] manifestation now
[57:02] a present tense
[57:05] of course we understand what present
[57:07] means but the
[57:09] definition of present tense is
[57:12] expressing an action that is currently
[57:16] going on an expression of an action
[57:20] that's currently going on
[57:24] so and then it's also the state of
[57:27] current existence so we
[57:30] we want to uh uh
[57:33] when we talk about uh
[57:38] present tense in the realms that were
[57:41] speaking on this morning i
[57:44] i think that it's uh really important
[57:48] to understand that there's
[57:51] only one thing that is
[57:54] present tense as you
[57:57] sit here you are not in uh
[58:01] it existing believe it or not you're
[58:04] changing
[58:05] by the second you just all of you have
[58:10] just got
[58:11] older since i've stepped out here
[58:15] you've probably had some brain cells die
[58:19] since you've begin to listen you've
[58:22] uh you know so something has
[58:25] transpired in a so
[58:29] we do not remain the same
[58:33] so you can't put this in the framework
[58:36] of time
[58:37] you can't put it in the uh
[58:40] a framework of what we would consider
[58:45] present day in other words we
[58:48] say that now we're living in this this
[58:51] time we
[58:52] uh we know our news reports and our
[58:56] our radio uh everything that we talked
[59:00] about
[59:00] nowadays is talking about politics or
[59:04] talking about the virus talking about
[59:06] this talking about that
[59:08] and it's in such a constant turmoil
[59:12] and a constant flux but there is
[59:15] something
[59:15] that remains the same that's unchanging
[59:20] and as i was writing with leslie the
[59:23] other day i
[59:23] i just said you know i said i've noticed
[59:26] something
[59:27] if you turn off the radio
[59:30] and you just don't listen to nothing
[59:33] and everything and you just sit back and
[59:36] have fellowship
[59:37] with the spirit that's in your heart i
[59:41] said you find out that this is a pretty
[59:43] peaceful world
[59:46] you know we were just driving down the
[59:48] street and and it
[59:50] you know the traffic wasn't bad and we
[59:52] just that we're gonna go
[59:54] uh get something to eat and
[59:57] and i thought you know it it's really
[59:59] not bad if you
[1:00:01] shut out all the other voices if you
[1:00:04] turn
[1:00:04] off all the noise and all the
[1:00:08] all the trouble and everything and you
[1:00:11] realize this morning that you're in the
[1:00:14] the palm of his hand and that you have a
[1:00:17] promise that nothing can pluck you out
[1:00:20] of the palm of his hand and that he
[1:00:22] promised to give you
[1:00:23] peace that surpassed understanding okay
[1:00:27] when
[1:00:27] the storm comes you uh you know
[1:00:30] that that he he's got you he
[1:00:33] he's the anchor in the storm he's the a
[1:00:36] rock that you're built on he's the
[1:00:39] he's a part of your life he's somebody
[1:00:42] that
[1:00:42] that you've meant and that you know
[1:00:45] personally he's
[1:00:46] not just in the pages of of a book and
[1:00:50] and though you can learn of him from
[1:00:52] that but
[1:00:53] it's somebody that you know that is real
[1:00:56] to you and you know that he loves you
[1:01:00] and you can look in your life and and i
[1:01:03] i love that
[1:01:04] song i've been redeemed
[1:01:07] kister laura saying that for us i
[1:01:10] thought the the part of that song that
[1:01:11] just
[1:01:12] got me so much is that you know i i was
[1:01:15] shackled
[1:01:17] i was shackled i was bound by
[1:01:20] the things that i did i was bound by
[1:01:24] the things that i said the very actions
[1:01:27] there and the
[1:01:28] sin that was in my life it had
[1:01:31] rule over me okay and so
[1:01:35] no matter what that i did
[1:01:38] these things became a part of the
[1:01:41] personality
[1:01:42] and the nature that i had you know
[1:01:46] that's
[1:01:46] one of the greatest things people don't
[1:01:48] realize about sin
[1:01:50] and about doing things and treating
[1:01:52] people wrong
[1:01:53] it leaves a scar on you
[1:01:56] it puts a kink in in the hose and
[1:02:00] it doesn't allow your life to flow
[1:02:04] because that's always there working you
[1:02:06] over
[1:02:08] it's kind of like you know what you
[1:02:10] really are
[1:02:11] but one day hey hey man
[1:02:14] one day on a rooftop
[1:02:17] i meant somebody that was going to
[1:02:21] uh he was going to make a difference in
[1:02:24] our lives
[1:02:25] he was going to cause a change he was
[1:02:28] it wasn't that you could add him to your
[1:02:31] life
[1:02:32] i didn't have to add him to my life
[1:02:35] i didn't have to to just take
[1:02:38] up all that i was and then add him to my
[1:02:42] life
[1:02:42] and say now i can go on different
[1:02:46] no he did more than that he wasn't an
[1:02:49] add-on amen he was a transforming power
[1:02:53] amen he took the old man and he took
[1:02:57] that nature away and he created
[1:02:59] us a new man in him
[1:03:03] that's what was wonderful
[1:03:07] that's why we're here fellowshipping
[1:03:09] this morning
[1:03:10] you know we're we're we're not here as a
[1:03:13] organization we're not here as anything
[1:03:16] we're just a local people just
[1:03:18] come together here because we've met him
[1:03:22] we've heard his word and and our hearts
[1:03:25] are
[1:03:26] set to the purpose of living that word
[1:03:31] and so as we begin to approach this
[1:03:35] great subject
[1:03:37] of a present
[1:03:40] tense manifestation
[1:03:44] i believe it is it is so reflected
[1:03:49] in this person
[1:03:53] called melchizedek
[1:03:57] melchizedek was a present tense
[1:04:01] manifestation abraham met
[1:04:05] him when he was coming home from the
[1:04:08] slaughter of the kings and as
[1:04:10] paul described him he said who was this
[1:04:12] person
[1:04:14] he didn't have a beginning of days
[1:04:17] he didn't uh
[1:04:21] have a father or a mother
[1:04:25] scripture says
[1:04:28] that he had no descendants
[1:04:33] so he he stood on his own
[1:04:36] now this is a a very uh
[1:04:41] it is i can say it this way it it's
[1:04:44] important to us
[1:04:46] and it behooves us to understand
[1:04:49] who that this is because
[1:04:53] it's it's going to play an important
[1:04:56] part
[1:04:56] in our lives the understanding
[1:04:59] of who that this man was what was he
[1:05:04] what was it he was there in the form
[1:05:08] of a man he was standing there
[1:05:12] in flesh we've
[1:05:15] seen him again as he
[1:05:19] he meant abraham when he gave
[1:05:22] abraham the promise this great
[1:05:26] person and you know many people
[1:05:29] have different ideas of who that he is
[1:05:33] because some claim that he's a type or a
[1:05:36] myth
[1:05:37] that that's very common with great
[1:05:40] scholars of the scriptures
[1:05:42] they believe that job is not really was
[1:05:46] never really a person
[1:05:50] they believe that job was a a
[1:05:53] parable or an old jewish
[1:05:57] a tale something like rip van winkle
[1:06:01] and they also believe that jonah
[1:06:05] was also a parable it was a tale
[1:06:09] it was a something that was given
[1:06:12] as an analogy or something and that you
[1:06:16] know pretty soon if you take that
[1:06:18] approach then you you put
[1:06:21] everything into a myth so there's no
[1:06:24] real
[1:06:25] baptism of the holy spirit there's no
[1:06:28] real divine healing there's no real
[1:06:31] salvation
[1:06:32] okay he begins to say that salvation is
[1:06:35] a
[1:06:36] state of mind well i can tell you
[1:06:38] salvation is far
[1:06:39] beyond a state of mind salvation is a
[1:06:43] way of life
[1:06:44] it's a living fountain that grows up
[1:06:47] inside of you and
[1:06:49] it nourishes your mind nourishes your
[1:06:51] heart
[1:06:52] nourishes your spirit because it's
[1:06:55] something that's real
[1:06:56] it's resurrection life that god has
[1:07:00] shared with you
[1:07:03] amen he actually shares his person
[1:07:07] with you it's real it's not a myth
[1:07:11] it's a person and some believe that it's
[1:07:15] a priesthood
[1:07:17] because he came it's an order another is
[1:07:20] it's something like you join like maybe
[1:07:24] a uh
[1:07:27] uh uh the knights of columbus or the
[1:07:31] or the eternal fraternal order
[1:07:34] of uh church janitors or
[1:07:37] or something like that it's an order
[1:07:40] it's a
[1:07:41] it's a club it's a organization this
[1:07:45] mel keys adapt but it's not
[1:07:50] amen he was a person so as i read a
[1:07:53] little bit
[1:07:55] uh to us this morning and as we walk
[1:07:59] through this this morning
[1:08:03] it it if you start placing yourself
[1:08:08] in this picture this morning
[1:08:11] because we're not a mishap this morning
[1:08:15] we were created with a purpose
[1:08:20] the scripture tells us in ephesians that
[1:08:24] were his workmanship in christ jesus
[1:08:29] foreordained unto good works that we
[1:08:32] should walk in them that he's revealed
[1:08:35] to
[1:08:35] us the mystery of his will
[1:08:38] that he proposed in himself after his
[1:08:41] good pleasure
[1:08:43] so god did not make mistakes
[1:08:47] this morning in regards to you this
[1:08:50] world in this universe just didn't come
[1:08:53] out of
[1:08:54] some something bumping up there together
[1:08:57] somewhere it's it's not it's something
[1:09:00] that was
[1:09:00] created and it was created by a god that
[1:09:05] had
[1:09:05] something in his mind he he had
[1:09:09] he had in his mind what that he wanted
[1:09:11] to do he had in his mind
[1:09:14] what he was purposing he he had proposed
[1:09:17] it in himself
[1:09:18] the scripture also speaks in one place
[1:09:22] it says that after the counsel of his
[1:09:25] own will
[1:09:28] so god received if i i can't comprehend
[1:09:31] that scripture
[1:09:33] i'm sorry it's so deep but the scripture
[1:09:36] says he proposed it after the council
[1:09:39] of his will in other words it's what he
[1:09:41] willed
[1:09:42] what that he wanted to accomplish what
[1:09:45] that he wanted to achieve what that he
[1:09:48] wanted to do
[1:09:49] so you can't just sit back and be a bump
[1:09:53] on the log you just can't go about your
[1:09:55] life
[1:09:56] getting a paycheck you just can't eat up
[1:09:59] your days
[1:10:00] and think well one day i'm going to pass
[1:10:02] away
[1:10:03] no that's not why god put you here he
[1:10:06] could have bypassed
[1:10:08] all that
[1:10:12] but there was something that he was
[1:10:13] achieving something that he was
[1:10:16] bringing to pass something that was
[1:10:18] unfolding
[1:10:19] and so that's what god's always done
[1:10:22] he's a great in a form he's a
[1:10:24] he he's a evolutionist
[1:10:27] he evolves he he has to start somewhere
[1:10:31] and evolve he had to start something
[1:10:35] in order that he could be realized
[1:10:39] and understood and that's what god wants
[1:10:43] he wants to have
[1:10:44] fellowship with you he wants you to
[1:10:46] understand him
[1:10:48] he wants you to know he wants you to
[1:10:51] know
[1:10:51] him he doesn't want us looking back
[1:10:56] 2 000 years
[1:10:59] at calvary and say that was
[1:11:02] jesus
[1:11:05] and this is what he did
[1:11:08] and because he did that and i've
[1:11:12] confessed that i'm a sinner and that
[1:11:15] i confess that he's lord that
[1:11:19] someday after i die
[1:11:23] he's going to put me in heaven you've
[1:11:26] left a lot of space
[1:11:28] out you're looking back at what that he
[1:11:32] did
[1:11:34] and you're looking back to what that
[1:11:36] he's going to do
[1:11:38] but you've missed the present tense
[1:11:41] manifestation
[1:11:45] you you've walked life just you went
[1:11:48] from
[1:11:49] a to z and then you
[1:11:52] rest in that and you say all that i have
[1:11:56] to do is be good
[1:11:59] and some uh of of a viewpoint armenians
[1:12:04] and
[1:12:04] and calvinist and that one lays all
[1:12:07] their
[1:12:08] they lay all what they have on what he
[1:12:10] did at calvary
[1:12:12] and others say no i have to
[1:12:15] i have to do works
[1:12:19] and we believe in works because works is
[1:12:21] faith expressed
[1:12:24] works as a result of something that he's
[1:12:26] done for you
[1:12:28] but it goes so far beyond that
[1:12:32] and it comes to what we we realize
[1:12:35] and we see as being something that is
[1:12:39] it is present tense
[1:12:43] a present tense manifestation
[1:12:48] he says now speaking of this person
[1:12:51] so we're talking about what is
[1:12:55] present tense there's only one thing
[1:12:58] that can be present tense he says
[1:13:04] he says it can't be that the fourth
[1:13:07] verse says that
[1:13:09] he was a person a man
[1:13:12] so in order to be a person he has to
[1:13:16] be a personality a man
[1:13:20] not a order but a person
[1:13:24] so he was not just a priesthood order
[1:13:27] neither was he a myth he was a
[1:13:31] person now understand that he's a person
[1:13:36] in order to be a person he has to have a
[1:13:39] personality
[1:13:40] so we're talking about somebody who is
[1:13:44] real
[1:13:46] we're talking about someone who is
[1:13:48] present
[1:13:49] tense and why is he present tense
[1:13:54] and this person is eternal
[1:13:58] if you notice he had no father he had no
[1:14:02] mother
[1:14:03] he had no time he ever began
[1:14:06] he had no time he ever ended
[1:14:10] and and ever who
[1:14:13] it was is still alive today
[1:14:17] because the bible said here that he had
[1:14:20] neither father
[1:14:22] nor mother beginning of days
[1:14:25] or ending of life so it would have to be
[1:14:29] an eternal person
[1:14:32] an eternal person so it could
[1:14:35] only be one person and that's
[1:14:39] god because he's the only one
[1:14:42] that's eternal god so
[1:14:46] who is this eternal person he
[1:14:49] is the i am there's only one
[1:14:53] present tense and that's the i am
[1:14:57] everything else changes everything else
[1:14:59] passes
[1:15:01] no matter how healthy you are believe it
[1:15:04] or not
[1:15:04] jacqueline anybody know who jacqueline
[1:15:09] is
[1:15:10] i am old i don't even know who the new
[1:15:14] jacqueline would be but
[1:15:16] anyway he was a guy that was just super
[1:15:18] healthy and ran exercises shows and
[1:15:20] everything but guess what
[1:15:22] he had an ending of days and he had a
[1:15:25] beginning of days
[1:15:27] but this person
[1:15:32] you have to say this person was god
[1:15:37] this person was god this person had a
[1:15:40] personality
[1:15:42] he wasn't he wasn't a myth he wasn't
[1:15:46] an order we're talking about somebody
[1:15:49] who is real a real
[1:15:53] person this morning you know
[1:15:59] and he says now
[1:16:04] he was god
[1:16:08] because he's the only person that can be
[1:16:11] immortal and god changed himself
[1:16:16] into a person
[1:16:20] god changing himself into
[1:16:24] a person now remember when god existed
[1:16:28] he was just the great i am he was the
[1:16:31] self-existing one
[1:16:33] there there was there was nothing that
[1:16:36] existed
[1:16:37] but him
[1:16:40] and so now this god in himself
[1:16:44] he he had attributes
[1:16:47] so we understand that god so i it's hard
[1:16:51] for us to comprehend
[1:16:52] but that's why that we're made in the
[1:16:54] image and likeness of god because we are
[1:16:57] made
[1:16:57] a person with a personality
[1:17:01] so god before that was just the
[1:17:03] self-existing one
[1:17:05] he like he said that timothy said you
[1:17:08] couldn't
[1:17:08] behold his glory you couldn't see him no
[1:17:11] man have seen them no man could come
[1:17:13] into that light
[1:17:14] or into that presence it look
[1:17:18] it it was it was so mighty
[1:17:21] and so powerful that the absolutely
[1:17:25] nothing could even fellowship with it or
[1:17:28] see it or comprehend
[1:17:30] it but so god in his great love
[1:17:33] for us he became something
[1:17:37] that could be loved and could be
[1:17:39] fellowshipped with
[1:17:41] he became a person
[1:17:46] so i don't know what he was before all i
[1:17:48] can say he was elohim
[1:17:51] the self-existing one there okay
[1:17:54] there i don't know what was there i
[1:17:56] don't know if he created
[1:17:58] worlds before i don't know how long
[1:18:01] time is i only know my little 70 years
[1:18:05] and i don't remember most of it
[1:18:09] but this god became a person
[1:18:13] now that's important to us as we unfold
[1:18:16] this this morning
[1:18:17] that he became a person he became
[1:18:21] something that he could express
[1:18:24] himself he took on
[1:18:28] he took on a form he became a person
[1:18:33] and so and you can't
[1:18:36] be a person without a personality
[1:18:43] so god has a personality you notice
[1:18:46] that you have a personality
[1:18:49] all of us are different we can be raised
[1:18:53] in the same home
[1:18:54] by the same parents eat the same food
[1:18:58] go to the same school go to the same
[1:19:01] church
[1:19:02] sleep in the same bedroom wear the same
[1:19:04] clothes
[1:19:05] but yet each one of us comes out
[1:19:08] different each one of us has a
[1:19:11] personality
[1:19:13] that personality is because god created
[1:19:16] you
[1:19:17] to have a personality because he had a
[1:19:20] purpose
[1:19:21] in you having a personality because he
[1:19:24] was a personality
[1:19:26] he became a person and in this great
[1:19:29] person of god
[1:19:31] there were attributes we understand that
[1:19:35] he was inaccurate he had attributes
[1:19:37] he had things that he was this
[1:19:39] personality is
[1:19:41] you notice some people are kind
[1:19:44] that's an attribute some people are
[1:19:47] ornery
[1:19:48] that's an attribute some people you just
[1:19:51] love to be around
[1:19:53] other people you step across the street
[1:19:58] they call you on the phone and the first
[1:20:00] thing you look at is
[1:20:02] is the caller id
[1:20:06] you know i i didn't have caller id for a
[1:20:09] long long time i'd have to say hello
[1:20:12] and it was hello oh no
[1:20:18] you know what i mean and people would
[1:20:20] start in and you couldn't get a word in
[1:20:22] edge right you didn't even know how to
[1:20:24] say
[1:20:25] uh i've got to go
[1:20:30] you would tell your wife call me on the
[1:20:32] other line
[1:20:34] you know what i mean you do you do
[1:20:36] anything some people that was their
[1:20:38] personality
[1:20:39] and and i've i've met people like that
[1:20:42] but i just couldn't hardly
[1:20:44] be around but when i took a little time
[1:20:47] to get to know them and i took a little
[1:20:50] time
[1:20:51] to to stand in their shoes and
[1:20:54] express a little brotherly kindness and
[1:20:57] and
[1:20:58] try to look at them and figure out why
[1:21:00] they're this way and then you
[1:21:01] you make contact with something in them
[1:21:04] that you know it's really not as bad as
[1:21:06] you think
[1:21:08] and then you begin to learn to enjoy
[1:21:10] them and you can go out to coffee with
[1:21:12] them you know
[1:21:13] and and finally you know your conscience
[1:21:15] is bothering you because of all the bad
[1:21:17] thoughts you had for him
[1:21:18] for so long you know what i mean and
[1:21:21] then finally that one day you're over
[1:21:23] the cup of coffee and you'll say brother
[1:21:25] you know what
[1:21:26] uh i hate to say this but there was a
[1:21:27] time i really couldn't stand you
[1:21:33] but uh you know i've i've come to know
[1:21:36] you
[1:21:37] and and i've come to see that you really
[1:21:39] love the lord
[1:21:40] and that you're really trying to do your
[1:21:42] best and
[1:21:43] and and and i'm glad you know
[1:21:46] so you know that's why we draw a bigger
[1:21:48] circle
[1:21:50] you know what i mean if you don't don't
[1:21:52] be so quick to judge
[1:21:54] don't be so quick to point a finger
[1:21:56] that's selfishness
[1:21:58] that that's all it is you just want to
[1:21:59] protect your little world you don't want
[1:22:01] to have to give of yourself
[1:22:03] but you know sometimes if you run across
[1:22:05] especially you teenagers and
[1:22:07] you people that are in school you know i
[1:22:10] i
[1:22:10] i was elected freshman class president
[1:22:13] don't i don't know why
[1:22:15] but uh they elected me freshman class
[1:22:17] president
[1:22:18] and i i just remembered the thing i
[1:22:20] always used to love i was popular in
[1:22:22] school
[1:22:23] not because the teachers like me i think
[1:22:25] i was popular because
[1:22:27] all the teachers wanted to throw me out
[1:22:29] so all the kids they like that you know
[1:22:32] so i was kind of a rebel type of fella
[1:22:34] and all the kids like me but
[1:22:35] i just remembered i always like to take
[1:22:37] what everybody thought was a nerd
[1:22:40] i think that's a term right it wasn't in
[1:22:43] my day we had another
[1:22:45] term for it you know what i mean and so
[1:22:48] we had these
[1:22:48] but i would like to go hang out with
[1:22:51] those guys
[1:22:53] and you know my whole goal was is if you
[1:22:55] know if you hung out with them long
[1:22:57] enough they would become popular
[1:22:59] you know what i mean all of a sudden the
[1:23:01] whole thing would change
[1:23:02] you know and you can change things for
[1:23:04] people you
[1:23:06] can make a difference in people's lives
[1:23:08] if you see someone at school that
[1:23:10] everybody makes fun of you be the first
[1:23:12] one to stand up
[1:23:13] you gotta understand there's a soul in
[1:23:15] there there's a personality in there
[1:23:18] there's somebody in there might be
[1:23:19] hurting there's somebody
[1:23:21] in there there might be somebody in
[1:23:24] there that
[1:23:25] god wants to manifest himself through
[1:23:29] so so don't ever get caught up in
[1:23:32] in this popularity thing at school don't
[1:23:35] ever get caught up
[1:23:36] in exciting at work you stay away from
[1:23:39] the gossip
[1:23:40] stay away from things you stand there
[1:23:42] with the love of god in your heart
[1:23:44] and you reach out to the kids around you
[1:23:46] you reach out to the
[1:23:48] people at school the things that aren't
[1:23:51] the people that aren't so popular
[1:23:56] they become a christian get bored again
[1:24:00] they're popular amen they may not be
[1:24:03] popular with this world
[1:24:05] but they're popular with the host of
[1:24:07] heaven they're popular with
[1:24:09] angels and and saints and and believers
[1:24:12] around the world so so never get like
[1:24:16] that so we're talking about this
[1:24:17] personality and god that god
[1:24:20] formed himself into
[1:24:23] a a person and he created
[1:24:26] us to be persons so these
[1:24:30] personalities could now
[1:24:33] contact one another so god
[1:24:37] made you so you could contact him
[1:24:41] and he made himself into something
[1:24:45] that he could contact you with
[1:24:48] so this so god created this because he
[1:24:52] wanted to fulfill
[1:24:54] this purpose we are not rats in a maze
[1:24:58] seeing if we can get through the maze of
[1:25:00] life
[1:25:01] and get out on the other side and and
[1:25:04] say we made it
[1:25:06] oh no oh no that's not where this is
[1:25:10] at hallelujah this is much more
[1:25:12] beautiful
[1:25:13] than that it is a much greater
[1:25:16] relationship
[1:25:17] than that this is more wonderful than
[1:25:20] that to think the
[1:25:22] wonderfulness of that god made you
[1:25:26] a person that he made himself a person
[1:25:29] so you too could come in contact with
[1:25:32] one another
[1:25:33] god wanted to make contact
[1:25:37] he wanted to express himself he wanted
[1:25:40] to express
[1:25:41] everything that he was so and so
[1:25:44] and that's why the you can never know
[1:25:47] god
[1:25:48] outside of revelation
[1:25:52] they asked jesus who do men say that i
[1:25:54] am
[1:25:56] he says some say you're this and some
[1:25:59] say you're one of the prophets some say
[1:26:01] you're john
[1:26:01] turned from the dead sometimes say
[1:26:03] you're elias
[1:26:05] he said but who do you say that i am
[1:26:09] and peter said thou art art the christ
[1:26:12] the son of the living god
[1:26:15] and he looked at him and said peter
[1:26:18] flesh and blood
[1:26:20] hath not revealed this to you
[1:26:23] in other words no flesh showed you this
[1:26:27] but my father which in heaven has
[1:26:29] revealed this to you
[1:26:32] and he said to him he says thou art
[1:26:34] peter
[1:26:35] upon this rock i'll build my church now
[1:26:38] i was raised the catholic
[1:26:39] we always thought the church was built
[1:26:41] on
[1:26:43] peter
[1:26:46] that's weird and then you know
[1:26:50] when i when i talked with my protestant
[1:26:53] friends
[1:26:54] they said the church was built on jesus
[1:26:57] christ
[1:26:58] well it wouldn't do you no good to build
[1:27:00] it on jesus christ if you didn't have a
[1:27:03] revelation
[1:27:04] of who that he was so the church is
[1:27:08] built on the revelation of the word of
[1:27:11] god
[1:27:12] that's where the church is built on god
[1:27:15] in heaven not man not flesh and blood
[1:27:19] not organization not denomination not
[1:27:22] human teachers but the church is built
[1:27:25] on god
[1:27:26] the person almighty father revealing to
[1:27:30] you
[1:27:31] who that he is
[1:27:34] that's a relationship this is not a
[1:27:38] lodge
[1:27:42] it's not a human fellowship it's not an
[1:27:45] organization
[1:27:48] it's not a social event you are here
[1:27:52] this morning and i hope you've come
[1:27:54] to sit and hear the word of god
[1:27:58] and have god give you a personal
[1:28:00] revelation in your life
[1:28:03] of whether you're right with him whether
[1:28:06] you understand him
[1:28:09] whether you've been injected with
[1:28:11] humanism
[1:28:13] but that when you walk out in your own
[1:28:15] personal life
[1:28:17] you've made contact with somebody that
[1:28:20] you can talk to
[1:28:21] and can talk back to you
[1:28:25] god doesn't believe in one-sided
[1:28:27] relationships
[1:28:30] and he doesn't want you to do all the
[1:28:32] talking
[1:28:36] hear ye him he wants you to listen
[1:28:41] he wants to reveal things to you he
[1:28:44] wants to enlighten you he wants to
[1:28:46] increase your understanding
[1:28:48] you say when will it stop it'll never
[1:28:50] stop
[1:28:51] it'll take eternity for him to reveal
[1:28:53] himself
[1:28:54] what a fellowship so we understand that
[1:28:58] god
[1:29:00] in becoming a person he was starting to
[1:29:03] change his form
[1:29:07] god changed himself
[1:29:10] into a person
[1:29:14] so god was
[1:29:18] he he became if we wanted to use
[1:29:21] a word of changing himself
[1:29:25] the terminology for that is e morphe
[1:29:31] the means to change and so
[1:29:34] we see that god changed himself
[1:29:38] and and so it came from
[1:29:42] the greek word emorphy comes from
[1:29:45] changing characters
[1:29:47] and it was like in a play like
[1:29:51] you would have a play and
[1:29:54] and so in this play you might have one
[1:29:58] person in this play play three or four
[1:30:01] parts okay knock i think you're going to
[1:30:06] start
[1:30:06] picking up on where i'm headed so
[1:30:09] this person in one scene he would run
[1:30:13] and he would change into a villain
[1:30:16] and he would come out in that act
[1:30:20] of that play as the villain and he's
[1:30:23] playing the part of the villain
[1:30:25] but yet he's still the same
[1:30:28] person and then he would run
[1:30:31] back and he would change his costume and
[1:30:34] maybe he would come out and play another
[1:30:37] part
[1:30:38] so it's the same person
[1:30:42] playing different roles
[1:30:48] he was playing different uh
[1:30:52] taking a different place
[1:30:55] and so we might ask ourselves this
[1:30:58] person
[1:31:00] what was the his present
[1:31:03] state of manifestation
[1:31:09] so this person now was manifesting
[1:31:12] himself as one act
[1:31:14] so you would look at that and say oh now
[1:31:17] he's manifested as a villain
[1:31:20] so you would say that's his present
[1:31:23] state
[1:31:24] of manifestation that's the part he's
[1:31:27] playing
[1:31:28] but and again the part changed
[1:31:31] but the person never changed
[1:31:37] the person remained the same it was the
[1:31:40] same
[1:31:41] person all the time not three persons
[1:31:48] so there's not god the father
[1:31:52] as one person and then god the son
[1:31:56] as a person and god the holy ghost
[1:32:00] as a person it's not
[1:32:04] three persons making up
[1:32:10] one god
[1:32:13] three personalities in order to have a
[1:32:16] personality
[1:32:18] or to be a person you have to have a
[1:32:20] personality
[1:32:22] so okay so they begin to express and
[1:32:24] they say well there's three gods
[1:32:28] and that's what i raised you knew i was
[1:32:30] raised a catholic before my conversion
[1:32:32] i studied in the pre-seminary program
[1:32:36] considering to be a priest and so i
[1:32:39] studied that
[1:32:40] out i understood what they felt
[1:32:43] they believed it took three persons just
[1:32:46] three completely
[1:32:47] separate persons and these three persons
[1:32:50] in some
[1:32:51] unity together made up what god
[1:32:55] is but god is
[1:32:58] the self same person
[1:33:01] the present state tense manifestation of
[1:33:05] god
[1:33:06] is i am
[1:33:12] the i am not the we
[1:33:15] are or the we will be or the we was
[1:33:20] but the present tense manifestation of
[1:33:24] god
[1:33:24] is i am i
[1:33:28] am the lord thy god thou shalt have
[1:33:31] no other gods besides me not a first
[1:33:34] person god
[1:33:36] not a second person god not a third
[1:33:38] person god
[1:33:39] the word of god commands us to worship
[1:33:42] that one person
[1:33:48] glory why is that so important to us
[1:33:53] because we begin to understand
[1:33:56] what it means to have a present
[1:34:00] tense manifestation
[1:34:05] not a future tense hope
[1:34:08] one day
[1:34:12] not looking back at what was
[1:34:16] but realizing that there is a present
[1:34:20] tense manifestation another
[1:34:23] understand the present tense is
[1:34:27] that person he's the only one
[1:34:31] that's present tense he's the only one
[1:34:34] that doesn't change
[1:34:36] he's the only one that remains the same
[1:34:40] he this person this god
[1:34:43] this one that changed himself into a
[1:34:47] person
[1:34:47] this god is the only thing
[1:34:51] that is present tense
[1:34:55] the only one nothing else
[1:34:59] is present tense because
[1:35:02] present tense is eternal
[1:35:06] and there's only one
[1:35:09] being that's eternal
[1:35:13] and that's why if you weren't part of
[1:35:15] that eternal being
[1:35:16] in the beginning if you weren't a part
[1:35:19] of him
[1:35:20] in your thing in his thinking if he
[1:35:23] didn't know you
[1:35:24] before you came here if he didn't create
[1:35:28] you if he didn't have you in his mind
[1:35:31] you'll never be there
[1:35:34] but if you're a part of him and a part
[1:35:38] of what he's manifesting
[1:35:40] and you're part of that present tense
[1:35:42] then you have eternal life
[1:35:44] so let's just unfold this for just a few
[1:35:46] moments and we'll close
[1:35:49] he said he says so
[1:35:53] this this character in the greek word
[1:35:55] means a forfeit
[1:35:56] which means changing his mask
[1:36:01] and that's what god did it's the same
[1:36:03] god all the time
[1:36:05] god in the form of the father the spirit
[1:36:09] the pillar of fire the same god made
[1:36:12] flesh
[1:36:12] and dwelt among us in more faith brought
[1:36:16] out so he could be
[1:36:19] seen now understand this is the purpose
[1:36:23] of god
[1:36:24] is to be seen
[1:36:28] he created adam so he could be worshiped
[1:36:32] so he created adam and he'd come down in
[1:36:35] the cool of eden
[1:36:36] in the evening and he would walk with
[1:36:38] adam and adam would have fellowship with
[1:36:41] him
[1:36:42] but all the time that god was walking
[1:36:44] with adam
[1:36:46] adam never knew god was a healer
[1:36:50] he never knew god was a deliverer
[1:36:53] he never knew god was a savior
[1:36:56] so here's god he's got a son
[1:36:59] and this son is perfect
[1:37:03] he's the first adam
[1:37:07] he's the son of god adam was the son of
[1:37:11] god
[1:37:12] echo there he was and and god had
[1:37:16] he put all that he was in adam and and
[1:37:19] there
[1:37:19] adam was but yet there's a whole part
[1:37:21] adam never knew about the father
[1:37:23] there was only one way that adam could
[1:37:26] ever know
[1:37:27] the father well
[1:37:30] god couldn't create somebody who was
[1:37:32] lost
[1:37:34] oh wow i should pray you should have
[1:37:36] jumped out of your seats
[1:37:41] you said i said pray god god couldn't
[1:37:44] create somebody who was lost
[1:37:51] not if he created it it's eternal
[1:37:55] now there's a he made a way for a lot of
[1:37:57] things to be created out here
[1:37:59] or not created perverted
[1:38:05] so he secured adam
[1:38:08] in himself the word he put his name on
[1:38:11] the lamb's book of life before the
[1:38:13] foundation of the world he knew where
[1:38:16] adam would end up
[1:38:17] but he allowed adam to fall not to be
[1:38:21] lost
[1:38:25] you understand not to be lost
[1:38:28] all the father hath given me will come
[1:38:32] nothing can pluck them out of the palm
[1:38:34] of my hand
[1:38:36] if i begin the work i will finish the
[1:38:39] work
[1:38:41] but he allowed adam to false so
[1:38:44] he can now show adam
[1:38:47] that he was a savior a healer
[1:38:52] a deliverer he had these attributes that
[1:38:55] he wanted to manifest
[1:38:57] now adam was able to to know that he's a
[1:39:01] father he could worship him and know
[1:39:02] that he's a savior
[1:39:04] jehovah jirei a provider
[1:39:07] and god began to let the whole thing
[1:39:10] begin to unfold he began to have
[1:39:13] different manifestations
[1:39:18] of his present tense
[1:39:22] because he's present tense but he began
[1:39:25] to put on
[1:39:26] different masks he began to show himself
[1:39:29] so that he could be seen now he could be
[1:39:32] seen as a savior
[1:39:33] he could be seen as a deliverer he could
[1:39:36] be just seen
[1:39:37] as a healer he could be seen as a
[1:39:39] provider
[1:39:42] adam could never see that part of god
[1:39:45] but god couldn't lose him
[1:39:48] so he secured him by putting his name on
[1:39:51] the lamb's book of life
[1:39:52] your name was put on that book also
[1:39:56] your name was put on that book before
[1:39:58] the foundation of the world
[1:40:00] nothing can put it on nothing can take
[1:40:03] it off
[1:40:04] he knew you he knew when you would be
[1:40:06] here the color of your eyes the color of
[1:40:08] your hair
[1:40:09] the statue that where you were in he
[1:40:11] knew you then
[1:40:13] though it might have taken a thousand
[1:40:15] years for you to get here
[1:40:16] he knew you then he knew where you come
[1:40:19] from
[1:40:19] he knew where you were going
[1:40:23] god doesn't run the kind of ship that we
[1:40:26] would run
[1:40:28] he's the author and the finisher of our
[1:40:31] faith
[1:40:31] he's alpha and omega he's the beginning
[1:40:34] and the end
[1:40:38] he's the one in self-existing
[1:40:42] i am present tense
[1:40:48] he's the only present tense
[1:40:51] he's the only i am this person
[1:40:58] melchizedek was this person
[1:41:01] in a present tense manifestation
[1:41:07] he was this person in a present tense
[1:41:11] manifestation in moses
[1:41:14] he poured his fullness in the present
[1:41:17] tense
[1:41:18] manifestation of jesus christ
[1:41:22] god always veiled himself
[1:41:26] in a personality
[1:41:34] he brought so he could be seen now that
[1:41:37] same god
[1:41:38] is the holy ghost is the father
[1:41:42] not three gods three officers three acts
[1:41:46] of the same one god
[1:41:49] they're present tense manifestations
[1:41:52] every time i say present tense you think
[1:41:55] i
[1:41:56] am you think of this person
[1:41:59] this one god person that's here
[1:42:06] he's here but he's veiled to the
[1:42:09] unbeliever
[1:42:11] satan has veiled him in denominational
[1:42:13] systems
[1:42:14] he's veiled them in religion he's kept
[1:42:17] people from seeing who he is
[1:42:19] with false doctrine withholding the word
[1:42:22] of god and unrighteousness
[1:42:24] with with putting all kinds of systems
[1:42:27] all kinds of
[1:42:28] programs and and gymnasiums and swimming
[1:42:32] pools and
[1:42:33] and social classes and all these things
[1:42:36] still there's only one way into the
[1:42:38] kingdom of god
[1:42:39] and it's not a program you must be
[1:42:43] born again
[1:42:48] you must come in contact with this
[1:42:52] present tense
[1:42:54] and this present tense
[1:42:57] must become a part of you
[1:43:05] the bible said there's one god
[1:43:08] but that's how you can't
[1:43:12] get this straight out and have three
[1:43:15] gods
[1:43:17] you would never sell the jew that tells
[1:43:20] you that one who knows better he knows
[1:43:23] there's only
[1:43:24] one god now listen to what he just said
[1:43:26] you'll never
[1:43:27] get this straightened out you'll never
[1:43:31] understand this one god
[1:43:35] manifesting himself you'll never
[1:43:38] understand
[1:43:40] what your position is in the plan of god
[1:43:43] you'll never be able to figure it out as
[1:43:46] long as you've got this
[1:43:48] idea there's three gods you miss it
[1:43:55] because you can't see yourself as being
[1:43:58] part of the word of god
[1:44:00] you can't see yourself of having eternal
[1:44:03] life
[1:44:04] if you have eternal life you've always
[1:44:06] had eternal life
[1:44:08] because you were in his thinking in the
[1:44:10] beginning
[1:44:13] you think you just got here because of
[1:44:16] your father and your mother
[1:44:20] even david said thou art my god i was
[1:44:23] cast upon thee
[1:44:24] from my mother's womb
[1:44:27] you don't think i go farther back
[1:44:30] than morton emmett and rosemary
[1:44:35] mcgeary
[1:44:39] you think that i just came through my
[1:44:41] life i can always use myself as an
[1:44:44] example
[1:44:45] and one day i just happened to come
[1:44:50] to the realization that there was a god
[1:44:57] he knew me when i got here he knew i was
[1:45:00] his
[1:45:01] that's what makes him a redeemer
[1:45:04] redeemer means to be brought
[1:45:06] back redeemer means to to restore
[1:45:09] back to redeem you
[1:45:13] that means you were his in the beginning
[1:45:15] my sheep know my voice
[1:45:17] another they won't follow all the father
[1:45:20] hath given me
[1:45:21] will come he knew you
[1:45:24] you were a part of him you were a part
[1:45:26] of that thinking
[1:45:28] you were a part of his mind you were
[1:45:30] there in the beginning with him
[1:45:32] your time was whatever time he put you
[1:45:35] here
[1:45:37] but he knew you would be here
[1:45:42] he's infinite
[1:45:46] all that he foreknew he predestinated
[1:45:51] all that he predestinated he justified
[1:45:54] all that he justified
[1:45:55] he sanctified all that he sanctified he
[1:45:58] came
[1:45:59] filled with his glory he glorified
[1:46:03] the beautiful plan of god unfolding
[1:46:06] in your life let's close down as we
[1:46:09] follow because this subject's bigger
[1:46:11] than i can
[1:46:12] spit out notice like a sculpture
[1:46:18] he hides a mask over it
[1:46:21] that's what god has done to this age
[1:46:24] it's been hid all these things has been
[1:46:27] hid
[1:46:28] and is supposed to be revealed in this
[1:46:30] age
[1:46:31] now the bible says that there would be
[1:46:34] revealed
[1:46:35] in the latter times it's like the
[1:46:38] sculpture keeping his piece of work
[1:46:41] all covered over until the time he takes
[1:46:44] the mask of
[1:46:45] off of it and there it is
[1:46:49] so understand he's kept this covered all
[1:46:52] this time
[1:46:52] and now he's going to pull the mask off
[1:46:55] of it and there it is
[1:46:59] and that's what the bible has been it's
[1:47:02] been
[1:47:03] a work of god that's been covered up
[1:47:08] and it's been hid since the foundation
[1:47:11] of the world
[1:47:12] and its sevenfold mysteries and god
[1:47:16] promised in the last days
[1:47:18] at the age of the lady elsia church that
[1:47:22] he would take the mask
[1:47:23] off the whole thing and we could see it
[1:47:27] what a glorious thing
[1:47:31] we could see it what a glorious thing
[1:47:35] god emorphae masked
[1:47:38] in a pillar of fire gaudi morphe
[1:47:41] a man called jesus god
[1:47:44] amorphy in his church
[1:47:48] god above us god with us
[1:47:51] god in us the condensation of god
[1:47:56] god in us the present
[1:48:00] tense manifestation of god being seen
[1:48:05] in a personality
[1:48:12] your personality
[1:48:15] god be seen in your personality
[1:48:19] that's the condensation of god gotti
[1:48:22] morphe he changed into a person
[1:48:25] then he was with us now in this
[1:48:29] age he's in us god being
[1:48:32] seen in a personality
[1:48:36] whose personality your personality
[1:48:39] the personality he gave you
[1:48:46] you say who's the present tense
[1:48:49] manifestation the present tense
[1:48:53] manifestation
[1:48:54] is the present tense the i am
[1:48:58] manifested in a personality
[1:49:05] so he could be seen
[1:49:11] god always fails himself in man
[1:49:15] now the unbeliever don't see it
[1:49:19] the unbeliever looked at the lord of
[1:49:21] glory and perceived them not
[1:49:24] in fact they called him beelzebub now
[1:49:27] you would never
[1:49:28] do that because you're a believer
[1:49:33] but they looked at them and they saw a
[1:49:34] man
[1:49:36] the predestinated looked at it and they
[1:49:39] saw god
[1:49:44] that was god's plan
[1:49:49] that was going to be the tense
[1:49:53] the present tense manifestation of god
[1:49:57] is god the manifestation of this person
[1:50:02] elohim this one
[1:50:06] god this one person
[1:50:09] this one present tense remember there's
[1:50:12] only one thing that's present tense
[1:50:14] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[1:50:17] word
[1:50:18] will never pass away in the beginning
[1:50:21] was the word
[1:50:22] and the word was with god and the word
[1:50:25] was
[1:50:25] god and the word was made flesh and
[1:50:28] dwelt among us
[1:50:32] now where is he where is this present
[1:50:34] tense
[1:50:37] where is this present tense
[1:50:42] this present tense spirit this
[1:50:45] unchanging god
[1:50:47] what is he doing he's condensing
[1:50:51] he's coming down from god to a person
[1:50:57] then showing himself in shadows and
[1:51:00] types
[1:51:00] in the old testament then creating a
[1:51:04] body
[1:51:07] yes god created a body
[1:51:11] in the womb of mary mary was not the
[1:51:14] mother of god
[1:51:16] god did not impregnate mary seed
[1:51:19] god created both seed and germ
[1:51:22] in mary
[1:51:27] he wasn't the son of mary
[1:51:33] he was god
[1:51:36] but he had a present tense
[1:51:39] manifestation in the person
[1:51:43] of mary
[1:51:46] and he came into the world and he was
[1:51:50] tempted like we were tempted
[1:51:56] you know it's real uneasy to make jesus
[1:52:00] god because he was the fullness of the
[1:52:03] present
[1:52:04] tense person was in him
[1:52:09] he was the fleshly manifestation
[1:52:12] of the present tense god jesus had
[1:52:16] the personality of god
[1:52:19] but he did nothing until the father
[1:52:23] showed him first he did nothing amen
[1:52:26] and he finally said if you can't believe
[1:52:28] me for my words
[1:52:30] believe me for my works and even the
[1:52:33] leaders of that day said no man could do
[1:52:35] these things
[1:52:36] unless the father be with him
[1:52:40] in fact philip finally says show us the
[1:52:42] father
[1:52:44] and he say philip have i been with you
[1:52:46] so long
[1:52:47] and you know not who i am he who hath
[1:52:50] seen
[1:52:51] me has seen the father
[1:52:56] why it was the present tense
[1:52:59] manifestation
[1:53:00] of the one person god in flesh
[1:53:08] that's who this melchizedek was he was
[1:53:11] this person
[1:53:13] god
[1:53:17] taking on personality
[1:53:22] and now he takes on personality
[1:53:26] that's the relationship that the
[1:53:29] believer has
[1:53:30] it's it's god in us
[1:53:34] condescending of god
[1:53:37] up there holy no one could touch him
[1:53:41] he settled upon the mountain and even
[1:53:44] the animals touched the mountain had to
[1:53:46] die
[1:53:47] and then god came down and changed his
[1:53:50] tent
[1:53:51] and come down and lived with us
[1:53:55] become one of us and we held him
[1:53:59] the bible says first timothy 3 16
[1:54:03] without controversy great is the mystery
[1:54:06] of godliness
[1:54:07] for god was manifested in the flesh
[1:54:10] handled with hands god eat meat god
[1:54:14] drank water
[1:54:15] god slapped god cry he was one of us
[1:54:18] beautiful typed in the bible he was
[1:54:21] at that present tense manifested in
[1:54:25] flesh
[1:54:28] oh glory
[1:54:32] that was god above us god with us
[1:54:37] now it's god in us the holy spirit
[1:54:40] not a third person the same
[1:54:44] person
[1:54:47] you say what is the present tense
[1:54:50] manifestation
[1:54:52] what is it it's that same
[1:54:56] god manifested
[1:55:00] not in a church
[1:55:05] not in a myth
[1:55:09] of doctrine or dogmas
[1:55:12] or creeds not in a study
[1:55:18] a watchtower magazine or
[1:55:22] uh uh uh the scriptures
[1:55:25] uh as maybe taught by theologians
[1:55:29] not in the intellect
[1:55:34] but the reality
[1:55:37] of that present tense
[1:55:41] manifested in your
[1:55:50] personality
[1:55:53] see you just got to be yourself
[1:55:57] it's not about us changing into
[1:56:00] something
[1:56:03] it's not about us setting us a bunch of
[1:56:06] works up
[1:56:07] to do it's not about us
[1:56:12] it's about the present tense it's about
[1:56:15] the i
[1:56:16] am
[1:56:19] it's about that being
[1:56:24] being seen in a personality
[1:56:30] that's why he made you the personality
[1:56:34] you are
[1:56:34] don't try to be different than what you
[1:56:37] are be yourself
[1:56:38] that's where he wants to manifest
[1:56:40] himself he wants to manifest in you
[1:56:43] the way that you are become one with you
[1:56:46] that's why he gave you your personality
[1:56:49] so he could be present tense
[1:56:52] because once he became a person
[1:56:57] he could only manifest himself in a
[1:56:59] person
[1:57:02] because he can't change his program else
[1:57:05] he didn't do it
[1:57:06] right the first time
[1:57:12] so he was going to do it in the church
[1:57:16] then that's what you'll end up with
[1:57:18] you'll end up with a basilica
[1:57:21] sitting on six hills of rome
[1:57:24] with a triple crown in the mark of the
[1:57:27] beast
[1:57:29] that's what you'll end up with and
[1:57:32] you'll end up with a bunch of
[1:57:33] denominational daughters
[1:57:37] which are nothing but prostitutes to the
[1:57:41] teaching that there's three gods because
[1:57:44] nobody in the bible
[1:57:45] that was ever baptized in the name of
[1:57:48] the father
[1:57:49] the name of the son in the name of the
[1:57:52] holy ghost
[1:57:54] nowhere in the scriptures peter on the
[1:57:58] day of pentecost
[1:57:59] he said men and brethren these are not
[1:58:01] drunk as you suppose
[1:58:03] but this is the present tense
[1:58:05] manifestation
[1:58:07] that joel spoke of i'll pour out my
[1:58:10] spirit upon all flesh
[1:58:19] what no system
[1:58:22] they said what must we do they were
[1:58:25] pricked in their heart
[1:58:27] they said what must i do he said repent
[1:58:29] every one of you
[1:58:30] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:58:33] christ
[1:58:34] for the remission of sins and you shall
[1:58:37] receive the present tense manifestation
[1:58:45] that's why it's there is there to blind
[1:58:51] because you can never wrap your mind
[1:58:53] around three gods
[1:58:58] because you're in eternal confusion is
[1:59:01] it jesus
[1:59:03] is it the holy spirit
[1:59:06] is it the father no
[1:59:10] there's only one present tense there's
[1:59:13] only one i
[1:59:14] am there's only one god and that god
[1:59:19] manifested himself
[1:59:22] in jesus christ so
[1:59:26] in this world as he is so shall we be
[1:59:32] herein is the love of god manifest
[1:59:35] as he is so shall we be
[1:59:38] in this world
[1:59:43] in contact and fellowship
[1:59:47] with the present tense a present tense
[1:59:51] manifestation and i'll close
[1:59:56] it's the same person god come down and
[1:59:59] became flesh
[2:00:00] and died to death in christ so he could
[2:00:02] clean
[2:00:03] the church in order to get it fit for
[2:00:06] fellowship
[2:00:08] god loves fellowship that's what he made
[2:00:10] the man
[2:00:11] in the the first time for was fellowship
[2:00:15] god dwells alone with serpents
[2:00:18] but he made man so he could reveal
[2:00:21] himself
[2:00:23] and there's so much more i could go and
[2:00:25] you understand we covered some of it
[2:00:27] last week
[2:00:29] about the great
[2:00:32] attributes of god
[2:00:35] manifesting and how each of you became
[2:00:38] part of that manifestation
[2:00:41] but we what i so
[2:00:44] want to express to you today is you're
[2:00:48] not
[2:00:49] you are called to enter into a
[2:00:53] union with the present tense
[2:00:57] that god is alive he's here this
[2:01:01] morning his presence is here
[2:01:06] he can be known he's here to do the same
[2:01:10] works
[2:01:11] he did 2 000 years ago he's the same
[2:01:15] yesterday today and forever
[2:01:19] he's present tense
[2:01:22] he's here for whatever that you have
[2:01:25] need of
[2:01:27] he's not afar off
[2:01:31] if he was afar off he would be future
[2:01:33] tents
[2:01:35] if he was back in history he would be
[2:01:38] past tense
[2:01:40] he's not future tense he's not past
[2:01:43] tense he's present tense
[2:01:47] and he wants to manifest himself
[2:01:51] in a personality
[2:01:54] maybe your personality is physically
[2:01:56] sick
[2:01:59] hallelujah oh present tense
[2:02:03] manifest yourself
[2:02:06] manifest that attribute of healing in me
[2:02:10] maybe you're lost this morning you know
[2:02:13] this present tense
[2:02:15] your parents have told you about him
[2:02:18] you've felt them you've sat in service
[2:02:20] and felt his anointing you felt his
[2:02:23] spirit move across
[2:02:24] you heard a song and that song touched
[2:02:27] your emotions and
[2:02:28] here's a song about jesus and for some
[2:02:31] reason tears start running down your
[2:02:33] tree can
[2:02:33] you have no control over the heart
[2:02:36] that's beating inside of you
[2:02:38] all of a sudden you feel conviction
[2:02:42] you say what's that conviction it's the
[2:02:44] present tense
[2:02:46] knocking on your heart i want to come in
[2:02:49] i want to manifest myself in your
[2:02:52] personality
[2:02:53] i want to i want to take my abode in
[2:02:56] your personality
[2:02:58] i hope i can lay that down we are not
[2:03:01] changing our personality god gave us our
[2:03:04] personality
[2:03:05] god changed his form but he didn't
[2:03:08] change his personality
[2:03:15] he didn't change his nature but he
[2:03:17] changes your nature
[2:03:19] but he doesn't change the nature your
[2:03:22] personality
[2:03:23] that he manifests himself in because
[2:03:25] he's got to manifest himself
[2:03:28] in a person
[2:03:32] oh it's beautiful beautiful
[2:03:35] i mean i'm part of the plan of god this
[2:03:39] has been his purpose from the beginning
[2:03:41] i've worked all these years trying to
[2:03:43] become something different
[2:03:47] trying to change the way i am
[2:03:50] sin isn't the way you are sin
[2:03:54] is the influence of the devil on you
[2:03:58] sin is of the devil
[2:04:04] sin is in the flesh and the flesh warts
[2:04:07] against the spirit
[2:04:09] and the spirit against the flesh and
[2:04:11] these two are contrary
[2:04:13] one to the other
[2:04:16] but that great spirit god made us
[2:04:22] people
[2:04:24] man makes saints
[2:04:28] god makes sons and daughters
[2:04:34] in closing because i will just continue
[2:04:37] on this subject
[2:04:38] and in this message if you would like to
[2:04:42] study and read it the bible said
[2:04:46] jesus is the same yesterday today and
[2:04:50] forever
[2:04:51] jesus says the works that i do
[2:04:56] shall he that believeth on me
[2:04:59] do also that's right notice
[2:05:02] that's the real malkeside
[2:05:06] now
[2:05:10] that's the real person
[2:05:14] now the works that i do
[2:05:18] you should do also
[2:05:21] who is this one person who was this
[2:05:24] melchizedek
[2:05:26] it was god made flesh
[2:05:30] who was this melchizedek it was that
[2:05:33] person
[2:05:34] in jesus christ who was that mount keys
[2:05:38] of that
[2:05:39] it was that person in his church
[2:05:42] who is this melchizedek it was god
[2:05:47] made flesh whoever believeth that jesus
[2:05:50] christ has not come in the flesh
[2:05:54] is antichrist is anti-anointing
[2:05:59] is anti-fellowship is anti-invisible
[2:06:04] union
[2:06:06] he's against
[2:06:09] he's against the person
[2:06:14] the i am the present tense
[2:06:19] abiding in
[2:06:22] flesh manifested
[2:06:26] present tense
[2:06:30] the world system of religion
[2:06:33] is against this revelation
[2:06:38] it's against the revelation of god
[2:06:41] the god the one and only
[2:06:45] true person god dwelling
[2:06:48] in human beings they always have them up
[2:06:52] there
[2:06:57] and then they create a third person to
[2:07:00] sprinkle a little anointing
[2:07:04] and that anointing never manifests
[2:07:06] itself the same way
[2:07:09] some say if you speak in tongues you've
[2:07:11] got it
[2:07:12] some say you shout you've got it
[2:07:15] you can go watch and someone will say a
[2:07:18] holy ghost outbreak
[2:07:20] and people are dancing and running and
[2:07:22] jumping and
[2:07:23] and falling all over and they say it's
[2:07:25] the spirit
[2:07:27] it's a spirit
[2:07:31] but yet there's still one god
[2:07:34] there's one person and that one person's
[2:07:38] desire
[2:07:40] was you
[2:07:44] not you to become something else but
[2:07:47] that he
[2:07:48] could manifest himself in your person
[2:07:52] present tense that's the malacca keys
[2:07:55] adapt
[2:07:56] today and i have many other things but
[2:07:59] we'll just take our time and and and
[2:08:03] spend these other days because this
[2:08:09] present tense god
[2:08:12] this only one god only one person
[2:08:18] this only one spirit
[2:08:23] is what is the rapture
[2:08:28] and that's why he wants that union to be
[2:08:31] there
[2:08:32] when that union starts and that growth
[2:08:35] starts
[2:08:36] the minute that you begin in that
[2:08:39] present tense
[2:08:40] reality the rapture begins
[2:08:44] it's already started in you
[2:08:48] now this morning my simple
[2:08:52] question is and i know i covered a lot
[2:08:54] of doctrine and
[2:08:55] maybe raised a lot of questions
[2:08:58] and i i hope i did because
[2:09:02] there's an answer and it's the word of
[2:09:05] god
[2:09:08] it's not man's interpretation of the
[2:09:11] word of god
[2:09:12] it's god interprets his own word
[2:09:15] by bringing it to pass and i hope this
[2:09:19] morning if
[2:09:22] if i didn't do anything this morning and
[2:09:25] not trying to explain
[2:09:27] but i want to stir up your pure hearts
[2:09:31] and your pure minds
[2:09:35] and i want us to bring back
[2:09:38] because the greatest thing that's
[2:09:41] happening
[2:09:42] with this so-called plague
[2:09:45] that's on the world is it's causing
[2:09:49] people to become loose
[2:09:54] everybody speeds everywhere because
[2:09:56] they're not writing tickets
[2:10:00] nobody shows up on time because they got
[2:10:03] a built-in
[2:10:04] excuse
[2:10:07] people start to stay home people start
[2:10:10] doing things all these things become
[2:10:13] part of your life it begins to work on
[2:10:15] your consciousness
[2:10:17] but you should never
[2:10:20] never stop being in fellowship
[2:10:24] with that person with the
[2:10:28] present tense manifestation
[2:10:32] of god in your life don't let that slip
[2:10:37] and if you've covered that up with
[2:10:39] religion
[2:10:41] that's all religion is it's a covering
[2:10:45] it's something you can put over yourself
[2:10:48] and say i am this
[2:10:50] i'm a methodist i'm a presbyterian i'm a
[2:10:54] baptist
[2:10:54] i'm this i'm that blasphemous names
[2:10:58] is all that there are and just a
[2:11:01] covering
[2:11:02] that you cover yourself up but you never
[2:11:06] come in contact
[2:11:07] with the revelation of the resurrection
[2:11:12] i am the way the truth the life
[2:11:15] i am the resurrection and the life
[2:11:19] i am the i am
[2:11:22] who do you say that i am thou art the
[2:11:25] christ
[2:11:26] okay looked at him and said you're not
[2:11:28] yet a man
[2:11:30] but but 50 years old
[2:11:34] and he said before abraham was
[2:11:38] i am i'm the present tense
[2:11:42] manifestation of the present tense
[2:11:46] i am the manifestation
[2:11:49] of the present tense are you this
[2:11:52] morning
[2:11:52] the manifestation of the present tense
[2:11:59] if you're not he's here
[2:12:05] because he created you that he could
[2:12:09] manifest himself in your personality
[2:12:13] let the word of god come in
[2:12:17] and cleanse your heart let the word of
[2:12:20] god
[2:12:20] deal with you amen not for those of you
[2:12:24] that need to go this morning

[2:27:52] gonna
[2:27:52] just say a few words before we baptize
[2:27:55] him go ahead brother
[2:27:56] turn
[2:27:59] uh hello brothers and sisters and
[2:28:02] friends
[2:28:02] um most of you already know a
[2:28:06] portion of my testimony because my
[2:28:08] brother was baptized a couple weeks ago
[2:28:10] so i think he's covered
[2:28:12] a couple of things over that but i was
[2:28:15] raised
[2:28:16] in a face where we thought brother
[2:28:18] random was
[2:28:19] god and i was raised from that
[2:28:23] and just having that basis uh we were
[2:28:25] taught
[2:28:26] to read the bible uh reading between the
[2:28:30] lines basically uh
[2:28:31] the issue with that
[2:28:36] you know you couldn't really accept the
[2:28:38] bible as
[2:28:39] the whole truth and uh once
[2:28:42] i started reading the bible for myself
[2:28:44] once i got his age
[2:28:46] i got the i got the whole truth from
[2:28:50] myself
[2:28:52] and i
[2:29:00] [Applause]
[2:29:05] i realized jesus christ was the lord and
[2:29:08] savior
[2:29:08] amen and i got to the truth
[2:29:12] and uh here to be baptized
[2:29:20] amen
[2:29:25] [Applause]
[2:29:27] and reading in the book of acts in the
[2:29:29] second chapter
[2:29:31] in the 32nd verse this jesus hath god
[2:29:35] raised up
[2:29:37] whereof we are all witnesses therefore
[2:29:40] being
[2:29:41] by the right hand of god exalted and
[2:29:44] having received of the father
[2:29:46] the promise of the holy ghost he hath
[2:29:49] shed
[2:29:50] forth this which ye now see and hear
[2:29:54] for david is not ascended into the
[2:29:56] heavens
[2:29:57] but he said himself the lord saith unto
[2:30:00] my lord
[2:30:01] sit down on my right hand until i make
[2:30:05] thy foes thy footstool therefore let all
[2:30:08] this house of israel know assuredly
[2:30:11] that god hath made that same jesus
[2:30:15] whom he had crucified both lord
[2:30:19] and christ and when they had heard this
[2:30:22] they were pricked in their hearts and
[2:30:25] said unto peter
[2:30:27] and the rest of the apostles men and
[2:30:30] brethren
[2:30:30] what shall we do then peter said unto
[2:30:34] them
[2:30:34] repent and be baptized every one of you
[2:30:38] in the name of jesus christ for the
[2:30:41] remission of sins
[2:30:43] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:30:45] holy ghost
[2:30:47] for the promise is unto you and to your
[2:30:51] children
[2:30:52] and to all that are far off even as many
[2:30:56] as the lord our god shall call and with
[2:30:59] many other
[2:31:00] words did he testify and exhort saying
[2:31:04] save yourselves from this up towards
[2:31:07] generation
[2:31:08] and they that gladly received his word
[2:31:11] were baptized
[2:31:13] and the same day they were added unto
[2:31:16] them
[2:31:16] about 3 000 souls amen
[2:31:20] just think repent
[2:31:24] and receive the present tense
[2:31:28] of god amen our brothers come to be
[2:31:32] baptized
[2:31:33] amen our precious brother
[2:31:37] according to the word of god jesus told
[2:31:40] him to go into all the world
[2:31:42] and to be baptized in the name of the
[2:31:46] father
[2:31:47] the son the holy ghost and peter with
[2:31:50] the keys to the kingdom
[2:31:52] and the divine revelation of the godhead
[2:31:55] knew that that name
[2:31:57] was the lord jesus christ for he came in
[2:32:00] his father's name
[2:32:02] and according to the word of god in the
[2:32:05] scriptures
[2:32:06] the word of god in this last day we
[2:32:09] baptize you
[2:32:10] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:32:36] amen
