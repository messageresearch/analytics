Description:
Happy Birthday
Br. Matthew McGeary
Wednesday Evening Service: October 27, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

and break the bread of life lord as only you can we surrender ourselves to you lord as your prophet said lord it takes both anointing the speaker and anointing the hearer lord so we're asking that you would do this now in your precious name the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord if you have your bibles we'll be reading out of uh the book of daniel amen we're just humbled by the opportunity to speak to you this evening and it's certainly a a special evening to be able to speak to you it's my dad's birthday 72 years and it is also my son's birthday he's two years old so i told my dad on when my son was born i said i couldn't think of anything better to get you than a grandson so so now he has to share his special day with my son every time so but but we're thankful we have this opportunity we do want to bring you uh greetings from the saints there in galena missouri from brother brown's church they send their love and greetings so just continue to pray for them as they're continuing to press the battle you know uh brother brown was the pastor there for us i don't know if it's 40 or 50 maybe almost 50 years and so they're looking to the new chapter for that pastor that god would bring along so just let's just bind together with them in prayer and we know that god has the right man for the job amen praise the lord let's just read out of daniel chapter 11 verse 32. and it reads and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the but the people that do know their god shall be strong and do exploits and also first john 1 7 first john chapter 1 verse 7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin if you just turn now to chapter 5 and verse 4 it says for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen we just ask the lord to add a blessing upon the reading of the word you may be seated and just in reading that last scripture for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world i mean how many have been born of god well i want to say to you tonight happy birthday happy birthday maybe that's what we'll speak on a little tonight is happy birthday i think that would be all right you look into the message and brother branham would even say those words you know about his birthday he says i'm not counting i'm not counting the natural years but i'm counting the natural and i read one quote he said it's been 24 years since i was born again and i tell you what if you've ever been born again you just read this scripture right here it says for whosoever is born of god overcometh the world well i might that might sound simple but you can just start you could just start rejoicing right there if you have been born of god if you have been born again that means you overcome the world i tell you what you get to looking around at the world nowadays and to think that god has done something for you that when you have been born again when you have been born of god you overcometh the world and he said this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith which is a gift of god look uh when god birthed you into his mind and into his thinking and when he brought you forth in this day and age he provided you everything that you ever had in need of amen so we can be a happy people we should be rejoicing we should be able to say happy birthday amen because we we have been born into the family of god there's a joy i tell you there's a joy in serving god we're a part of something special we're a part of the family of god and and as we just move here a little bit we've been uh uh just some of our inspiration coming out of there's a man that can turn on the light he says this in paragraph 269 he says there is a man here that can turn on the lights all right what does he do by vindicating his word for this day now that that's really important right there by vindicating the word for this day earlier on in this message he would say that's the problem is everybody wants to put on their ecclesial ecclesiastical glasses and they want to look at god through their ecclesiastical ways of thinking and and something that's been on my heart as we read this word uh as we continue on the prophet is going to say that by vindicating his word for this day jesus the son of god who promised the word for this day is right here with us don't get scared don't pay any attention to what they're doing you you you'll walk in darkness be wise they that do wise daniel said and these last days will do exploits for their god see they'll walk in the light as he is in the light and i want you to just focus here how the prophet is taking now daniel 11 32 that they will know their god they will be strong into exploits and he's tying that together to first john and and so many times when we think of exploits we start to think that well well oh we start to think of signs and wonders and we start to think thinking of these big evangelistical moves and these meetings and we got to be running around and doing all these things but notice the prophet now he's entering into the third pool the final stage of his ministry and he's tying daniel 11 32 to 1st john and he's saying that those that know their god they will be strong and they will no exploits if you walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another so what we want to do is we want to manifest the word for our hour for our day we we want the word to be vindicated and made flesh to us the individual not looking at a day gone by not looking at it today gone past and trying to resurrect something in the past that was manifested in another age but god has exploits for the bride he has a work for the bride that's something that she is doing under this revelation under that that third pull revealing that has been given to you and many times what we do is we put on our ecclesiastical glasses oh we're going to know our god we're going to be strong we're going to do exploit and we start to filter through our mind and filter through our ideas of what we think the exploits and the works of god are and that we really if we're not careful we start to try to manufacture something and impersonate a move of god that's going on somewhere else look we're all guilty of it we look at something we see the move of god going out there's something we appreciate those things we're thankful for the move of god but we want the move of god in our life we want the move of god in our church we want to move god in our family in our house when i wake up in the morning i want the move of god in my life i'm not looking for something afar off and trying to look at something that way out there and trying to bring it into manufacturing but if you're walking with him if you're walking in the light as he is in the light and you have been born again and there's a faith that has made you an overcomer and you're walking with jehovah jireh he's the one that's providing for you he's the one that's leading you he's the one that's guiding you he's the one leading you at all truth and righteousness and if you're walking with him why then you've surrendered to the word and it's no longer you that liveth but it's christ that liveth in you and now that you've surrendered yourself to him he can pick up your body he can speak through your mouth he can walk into the restaurant he could he could walk into the church house he could walk over to the neighbors and now what is it it's god becoming tangible god living in a party god living him a bride doing exploits in the last days what did he say he said the third pool wasn't a public show we want some public show with what we want we want some big big mighty big fantastic to get everybody's attention and what does it do it vindicates you is all it does it causes a lot of problem because you get the glory you get the vindication look what we did look at the mighty move and what we're doing but god isn't interested in those things he's injured to a pride that's dead to the things of the world dead to denominational unbelief in his word trying to trying to manufacture something trying to he praise on herself and look what we did look how many people we fed look at how many homeless shelters we've built and all they're doing is heaping praise upon themselves but god wants a love relationship with a bride in the end time that's a sudden secret going away a union between the earthly bride and the heavenly bridegroom and it's a secret it's a secret catching away oh he says by vindicating the word for this day there is a man who can turn on the light and he's tying now daniel 11 32 with first john and he says they'll walk in the light as he is in the light don't worry it may be dark looks like they're going to force us everyone all these you see their proclamations going out and all these little churches and things are got to come in now you've got to come in or they're going to close you up they're going to make it now we want to hit that real hard tonight when i when i get to this time now that work they're saying we're going to close you up you have to be one of them or not you're either into that or you or you can't do nothing you can't even buy or sell that's it you dares not pray for the sick if you are caught ministering to the sick or any other person with any spiritual thing in there you're subject to federal law to be executed that's exactly right see you know that that's right it's in their papers yes sir so you cannot do it you have to belong to the cult brother let me tell you something you better get christ sure in your heart right now because there's coming a time uh where you're really going to need it well i say you must be born again i say there's no time like the present if you need to be born again if you need to be filled with the holy ghost i tell you we can have a birthday here tonight we could be saying happy birthday there's water come ye who are all who are heavy laden and i will give you a rest look there's no time like the present so many times we want to look and try to figure everything out he says when the squeeze comes you know how things are going to start tightening up watch the third pull then and everybody is looking for what the third pull is going to be well my the third pool is the spoken word and we're gonna you know we're gonna speak things when we when we need it and and if we're not careful we become just denominational believers waiting for federal law to come into place waiting for some uh a political move and some political power and things should be starting to tighten up there for us to finally get our act together what is it going to take church is it going to come to it's going to take federal law going around and knocking on your door and and asking you about so he's going to take closing up the church is it going to take your children being taken away from you because they've been documenting everything that's ever been said over this pulpit and they're going to label you and they're going to tell you you're a hair chick and you're a detriment to society and that everything that you believe is poison and we've got to annihilate that and they have caps built up around the towns and they want to take your family and put them are you waiting for that if we're waiting for that i tell you if that time comes it might be too late but i tell you you better get christ sure in your heart right now because if we're not careful we start to look for some type of manufa manifestation in the future brother biscuit said many years ago he said look everybody paraphrased into a sense he said everybody talks about what the third paul's going to be but we know what it is that's the important thing we know what it is we don't have to look into the future and start to wonder well what is it going to be look god reveals his word by what bringing it to past so that we don't have to look out there and wonder but if you're walking in the light as he is in the light and you're walking with him then it doesn't matter what comes your way you're walking with jehovah jireh i'm not looking into the future waiting for something in the future to happen to make me get my act together but if you've been born again if you're walking with the guide if you're walking with jesus christ then he's leading and he's guiding you and if these times come if perilous times come if they start seeking you out if they start hunting you down then if you're walking with him you have everything you have need of he will guide you through the perils he'll guide you through the darkness he'll lead you amen there's no time like the president the prophet says and look away to jesus he said it's tightening and when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where you're pressed out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then and it'll be absolutely to the totally lost but it will be for the bride and the church so god has given us something and if i could say this just maybe not to leave you out there but we know that the third pool is the opening of the word and we know that the third pool is to the total lost and we know the third pool is the spoken word it's creation we see he said i now know what the third pull is and what it does and so i'm looking at the exploits and what the bride is going to do he's moved us now into the end time message that we received we're not trying to manufacture a as the as god has built up the body he's built up the church ages through justification through sanctification and then the outpouring of against we don't necess we don't do away with those things because god is building up a body but now we're living in the hour of the revealed word where we've been called out from all of those church age ideas and we've been gathered together in christ the word and we've come into here and this is where god wants to manifest his word he wants you to be united with a capstone and in there with his mind that's the exploit and the works that god wants to manifest not looking back to an age gone by and trying to wonder what we can do to resurrect something god's done in the past but looking for what god is doing right now but the people that do know their god shall be strong to do exploits so we're just looking at how he ties those two scriptures together and i want to say if we're going to know our god if we're going to be strong and do exploits then you have to be born again and i want to say it like this there has to come a birth under malachi 4. your birth on the pentecost your birth under denominational it's not going to produce the life that god is looking for he said when i when i come again will i find faith in all the earth will i find faith well god we got the answer will he fight find faith he sent a word to produce a perfect faith he sent himself he came himself and gave us a complete open book that would produce rapturing faith that would produce a perfect faith and that is the faith that he is looking for not a faith of a glare of another age but a faith that the vindicated word in our age has produced and we saw one come to that maturity who is able to stand there on the earth with the third pull and the restoration of the word right there and be able to speak creation be able to speak to the storm what was it that was a great exploit i was fellowshipping with a brother and and he just pondered the question thinking that you know maybe it's going to be uh uh uh uh the the spoken word and the bride that starts to to do miraculous things that gets the government's attention and they really start to hunt us out and close us up and i just thought well you know i just know one thing that the prophet of god said it wasn't a public show and every time that he manifested the third pool it wasn't it wasn't some big thing out there it was something it seemed so simple it would seem so significant little fishy i give you your life back why you know and then and then when he speaks squirrels into existence he's out there by himself and then he goes out there and does it again and so brothers are talking about well where was that seventh one and and i believe he goes back out there and he's looking for it and and any in in it's he's he's looking for this seventh squirrel there's like a little bush there somebody and he's like well where he goes well you speak you say oh yeah it'll be right there and he look there it is and he comes back in now now now there wasn't no big crowd there wasn't a big big gallery that was watching the third pool unfold but no he was in that individual walk with god where those things were being manifested and then he comes back into the house there where there's a few brothers and hatty right and he starts to tell the story well you know what he was right there where i said that and hattie wright said well brother ran on how can that be and he said well all i know is he's still jehovah jireh and just as abraham needed a ram he provided it and she said that's nothing but the truth and her response to the word what did it do it brought hattie right into an atmosphere it brought her under an anointing because she said amen to the word and now she becomes a partaker of that third pool manifestation being set because she said that's nothing but the truth and now the first time you're ever going to see this the prophet would say manifested on a mortal being is that that little poor humble woman sitting there and saying howdy whatever you ask for ask for a million dollars and you'll have it she i believe she even says what should i ask for brother brandon i don't know you got a sick sister that's been in a wheelchair you have you you're poor you need money and i believe brother brandon was even sitting there with twenty dollars in his pocket because she made 200 a year and she had made a donation of 40 for the building fund and one of the brothers said brother branham go ahead and give 20 dollars back to him the prophet was actually was actually going to give her 20 dollars back and god spoke to her and said i got something better for her oh my you're looking for finances and you're looking to make a living and you're looking to the world to provide for you but if you'll just give god just give his first just say amen to the lord i say he got something better for you church he got something better than this world can offer he got something better than lady aussie ass he has something better than your job can offer oh he got something better for you he got the revealed word of the hour that if you've been born again you have overcome the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even your faith that comes by the revealing of the word in this hour that will produce a body change it will produce a rapture it will produce a perfect faith that you can put every devil under your feet oh i'm talking about a bride that is victorious in the name of jesus christ oh glory to god you might think i'm a little fanatical you might think i'm a little crazy but something has started there has been a reaction that has started inside of me it is something i can't stop it is changing me little by little step by step and one of these days i'm going to take my last step i'm going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye i'm going to be gone why because i've received this message in this hour oh it's a great word it's a great message if you can just say that's nothing but the truth oh hallelujah praise his name hallelujah there's something that has been opened up to the bride and i say it's under this message that you've got to be born again oh we got to be washed by the water of the word you can't hold on to your way of thinking you can't hold on to your way of doing things but if you walk with him and he is the word and his word is the guide it's the message it's what's leading you and guiding you through this lady ought to see your age and leading you into the body change but as soon as we start to lean at our own thinking and lean on our own standing then we start to separate ourselves from the guy and you know what's so special about this guide when you make a right hand turn do you want to go do your thing he'll follow behind you and he'll wait you'll get out there you'll make this turn you'll make that turn you'll get yourself in all of a kind of a mess and a situation oh but when you get there if you'll finally repent and you'll just look away to jesus and turn back around you'll find him faithful he's been there all the time and you'll just say lord jesus i'm sorry lord forgive me and you'll say lord son i love you i paid the price on calvary why don't you just take me by the hand and what he'll do he'll start leading you back he'll start leading you back and get you right back on the right track he'll take all the permissive will he'll take all your wrongs and he'll make every single one of them right oh what a blessed word what a blessed consolation to know we serve a god that's so great that could give you a revelation and say you're justified you never did it in the first place oh my oh hallelujah oh you talk about a victory i feel that many times we're struggling to catch the revelation of justification there is no way that you have caught the revelation of true justification from another age that was a partial truth that was a partial truth but jesus christ came in our generation and said you're justified that means you never did it in the first place you talk about redemption he wants to take you back to where you were in the very beginning to take you out of any other sin condition where anybody that would come and try to tell you oh jackson i saw you living out the way you you did all this out in the world and if they could stand right there before then say that the lord you go i don't know what you're talking about can you imagine how mad that makes the devil when he goes to accuse you before the lord and he tries to tell him about your faults and about your failures and here's god that knows everything he knows everything about every single situation and the devil knows that and he comes up an accuser of the brother and he says look at sister so-and-so do you know what she did you remember she did it she did oh yeah the other day she was over at that friend's house and this is what happened and she started to do this and that and he looks right at him and goes no i i i don't know what you're talking about you imagine how mad that makes the devil when he tries to go and god see a forgetfulness but you know there's a sign there that says no fishing saints if we have been born again if we have been forgiven then there is now no condemnation to them who are in christ jesus talk about a happy birthday blessed is the man in whom the lord will not impute sin that's what we're happy about that's why we're excited because we have been forgiven we have been justified the holy spirit has sanctified our our lives and our vessels and he's brought us into a fellowship with the holy ghost oh glory to god oh hallelujah oh i just can't help at church i know what i used to be i know what i used to do but oh when you experience the loving tender hand of almighty god how could you ever look down on another individual how could you ever look down on somebody else that's out there and sin when you know what you used to be but god rich in mercy we're in this great love that he loved us reached down his hand and pulled you up out of the mucking mire when you've experienced that type of love you want everybody else you come in contact with to experience that same kind of love oh you shall know they are my disciples by their love one for the person who always takes care of you and and always is lifting you up and always complimenting you and and and why wouldn't you cater to him no by your love one for another just another why don't you just show the love of god to another to common man to another human being especially those of the household of faith oh my there's something that has taken place because faith is a revelation faith is a victory that overcometh the world it's our faith and there is a people that know god that's the scripture that says they shall know their god they will be strong and they will do exploits there's a people that know to god when you look out at the world and you know that that 200 million demons have been loosed at the river euphrates and we're seeing the depth of sin we're we're seeing things now coming into the human beings and the acts that are there that are being committed are really if you're in it's incapable of comprehending what would what would overtake somebody and how that these things could be i was at work and my secretary asked me there there was a a big thing on the news about a a young couple and and it's just one of those news stories where unfortunately they went by the way of the the grave and and she goes i just want to know what happened i just want to know why i said you know it's that kind of thinking that'll drive you crazy i said it's that kind of thinking that'll destroy you when you start to think upon those things and you meditate and you start to wonder well why was this why was it that you know the world you you can't comprehend that wickedness out there it's it's demon evil spirits that are pressing their cells into flesh look if you if you if you could see the news and the things and i don't recommend it where where the things that were committed and and they were news breaking now it's just commonplace it's happening all the time and then now the age limit's getting lower and lower and lower to where where you're finding out that eight-year-olds are committing suicide and things are taking place and you wonder oh my goodness how could it be that bad where a young child would take that in into their own hands and take their own life but you know if if the wickedness has gotten so dark and it's so dark out there where where where where you know the devil's pressing himself and the people like that and they have their movie stars and and there's these anointing and people are hearing voices and they're hearing demons and they're worshiping their sex queens and they have their so-called superstars and everything trust me they know the god of this evil age they worship when they they're seeing the fruits of the way they're living and look the denominationals are no different oh come on the the jesus said these people in matthew 15 80 said this people draweth my enemy with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their hearts is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for the doctrine the commandments of men in vain do they worship him well i got news there's a group of people that have gathered together in bedford texas tonight and they are not worshiping the lord god in vain oh no there's plenty of households out there a plenty of churches that have gathered around the dallas fort worth uh a metroplex and in vain do they worship me teaching the doctrines of the commandments of man oh but there's a little place where a people have gathered together under the revealed word of the hour and he said i seek those to worship me those that will worship me in spirit and in truth and we have received a truth and this hour that has introduced us to our lord jesus christ and the word says where two or three are gathered i'll be in their midst i want to tell you jesus christ is here he inhabits the praises of his people you didn't come in here leading songs in vain you didn't come here lifting up your hands in vain you didn't come in here wondering if god was going to be here but you got a divine promise that jesus christ is here in the building tonight i ask you then what do you have need of what is it that's troubling you oh we worship our lord jesus in spirit and in truth and by divine promise he is right here he is right here right now oh but we see all this wickedness we see the wickedness of man but the scripture says when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him oh it's dark all around it looks like there's no way out oh this god forsaken land it's evil plagued by death and by disease by lust but the spirit of god has come upon you by his word to lift you up to lift you out of the prophet would take psalms 27 5 and say for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret place of his tabernacle he shall hide me he shall set me up upon a rock notice he says i will set you up upon a rock that's the rock of revelation that he set you up on where they came when when they when jesus asked him say who who do they say i the son of man in well someday i'll say that or jonas some say that are elias some some say thou art elijah but who do you who do you say i am that's a question that we need to ask ourselves what are we following what do we believe in what do you say this message is what do you say malachi 4 5 was what was revelations 10 1-7 is it buzz phrase is it catch phrase just to get the people excited it was is it is it our cult is it our little clique we believe a prophet we're going in a rapture oh we might just be good baptist we might just be good pentecostal but you might want to ask yourself in your heart the lord is speaking to you who do you say i the son of man and there comes a revelation that'll break out in your heart where when you meet the lord jesus christ just like paul was struck down there on the road to damascus he says saul it's hard to kick against the prick maybe you're going through that maybe you're struggling maybe you're fighting maybe you wonder why things are going the way they are maybe you ought to say lord who are you i am jesus whom thou persecutest what happened there came a revelation and paul had to be born again there came a translation in paul's life where he came to the revelation that he knew who that was he knew that was none other than jesus christ and i invite you to take a look at the word and see what we've heard and what has been manifested and asked the quest who do you say this is who do you say i the son of man in thou art the christ the son of the living god oh when you meet him it'll change you it'll change out the way you think and the way you act you'll become a new creature in jesus christ old things will pass away all things will become new oh that's the revelation of this hour that we're walking in the prophet says don't fear little sister there is a man here who can turn on the light oh my with all this darkness maybe you feel like it's dark maybe you feel like it's hopeless don't fear little sister there's a man here who can turn on the light he can make this word live that's what we need church we need the guide we need the lord jesus christ there is a man here who can turn on the light he can make this word live the problem is we've been trying to make it live the problem is we've been trying to make this message live with our efforts and our ideas and our understanding and with our works and it can't live through your abilities it can't live through your knowledge it can't live through your understanding oh my but when you meet him there is a man here that can turn on the light and he will make this message live we don't know how he's coming we don't know when he's coming i don't know nothing about it but he is here it's like quit worrying about uh sometimes we get our mind in such a pickle wondering well is the coming of the lord in 63 or is the coming of the lord it's going to be the meeting in the air and the third pool will it's speaking creation and oh my goodness the feds are gonna have to hunt us up and then when that starts happening it gets really tight and i thought it was gonna happen here they closed down our church but then that wasn't the prophecies of field so maybe we'll wait for the prophecy to be filled and then we'll start getting the squeeze and then maybe these are going to be the things that you know and then he's going to come hey no look you don't have to worry about all that he's here he's here a vindicated prophet malachi 4. looks like the son of man ministry god coming down and taking a man's vessel and stepped into it and said i'm here i'm here don't you don't have to fear little sister i'm here i can turn on the light i'll chase away the darkness whatever you're going through i'll walk with you oh he's here you don't have to try to figure it out if you'll just pray listen to the word be in fellowship shun the appearance of evil do the simple things and walk with jehovah jiren he'll provide all those things that you have need of oh the prophet said this so plainly well i don't know how we he's coming well i don't know when he's coming i don't know nothing about it but he is here he can turn on the lights how are we going to get out of it i don't know but he's here everybody wants to know how are we going to get out of kovic how is this all going to get back together look if any of us are honest with ourselves we kind of want this whole thing to get put back together kind of want this whole vaccination thing and this whole uh pandemic thing just to go away so we can keep living our nice comfortable lives it was just so much better before that thing happened i was just kind of things were easier and if we're not careful we jump on the bandwagon trump was back in the office this is this biden guy he's the reason why it's all happening you know they need to do this and they need to build a boy come on do you think those puppets are having anything to do to control the signs and times no there's only two powers that's the power of god and that's the power of satan and the power of satan is having control over his evil he can only do as much as god allows them to do and he's just a puppet in the hands of god god just allows him to go so far he just allows them to do this even in your own life the prophet of god said he's the great shepherd that sits at the gate and no sin no sickness nothing can ever come upon your life unless the great shepherd permits it and he if he has permitted it he has allowed it for your good it's going to bring good into your life it's going to work out a character it's going to work out a gold in you it's going to be something that has an eternal weight of glory oh you can just look that old devil say watch out devil the character of god is being formed in my life every blow of the enemy every death everything that he throws at you oh it cannot affect you because you're in the bosom of jesus christ he's allowing those things to move into your life that will bring out the character of christ in you there's a character in you that you don't even know you have there is a part of god in there that's doing exploits you know why you're here tonight because god kept you this ain't something you've done church we ain't a bunch of denominational believers who got some form of ideas and we've formed some clique and came here none other than almighty god has kept your life he has saved you he has redeemed you he put a pool on your heart and he's trolled you here that he could speak to your heart oh i didn't give it up a long time ago i've sat in my bedroom and felt i was losing my mind and i said oh god i don't know what to do where would i go lord i don't know where to turn i don't know where to go but where could i go thou o lord thou hast the words of eternal life god's the one that's keeping you there is a life inside of you an eternal uh uh attribute of god that has been placed there and he is actually allowing this time to bring out the fruits of that seed that he put there if we'll just yield to it we'll just surrender to it just like abraham he was walking with jehovah jireh he didn't know what was going to happen he was just being obedient to the word and he got up on that mountain and the prophet of god said look look who spoke that ram jehovah jairus spoke that round you keep walking with god if you have need of something you have the spoken word that'll provide you with every need that you have if you'll just surrender to it if you'll just feed on it if you'll just believe it what did he say it's it's those who are born of god have overcome the world and this is your victory even your faith what are you putting your faith in faith cometh by hearing the word oh we got to be feeding on that word he's the one that can turn on the light yes sir he is the one he's here and he can turn on the lights how are we going to get out of it i don't know but he's here and he's the one that can turn on the lights yes sir he is the one he is the light he just makes himself known watch that now he just makes his self known that's how he turns on the light i want to say talk about a happy birthday there was one day i was in darkness i couldn't find my way out oh but the prophet said he just makes himself known that's how he turns on the light and one day i got in a situation and i said oh god whatever that is it's bigger than me and i need your help and all of a sudden it was like there was a man here that could turn on the light and he turned on the switch and the light came into my life he chased away all the darkness he chased away all the unbelief oh i was born again i was filled with the holy ghost you talk about a happy birthday i've never been the same since and i've been waking up with a gift that has never stopped giving his mercies are new every single morning oh i rejoice in that i tell you what that's the greatest birthday you could ever have because his birthday god for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and because of that birthday you can be born again you can have a spiritual birthday you don't have to keep living and fighting like like you've been fighting but there's a man here who can turn on the light oh praise god i say there's somebody here tonight that just maybe needs the joy of their salvation back oh because when i start to think about what he did for me you might be going through a spell you might be going through a hard time but david said restore unto me the joy of my salvation maybe you've gotten a little weary and you've gotten tired you've even started to doubt your own experience that's okay we go through times like that you know it was it was it was this day 85 years ago that brother branham and his wife hope welcome sharon rose into the world 85 years ago today october 27th and what a joy that would have been to have his baby girl but little did he know nine months later nine months later he'd be standing there in the hospital looking at his little sharon rose and her ledge twitching in her eyes going across his wife laying there in the morning three days later three days earlier and then the devil come start telling them yeah this is the kind of god you serve the prophet said you couldn't couldn't tell me it wasn't real i've done seen too much or maybe you've seen a lot maybe you know god's real but the devil keeps trying to come to you and say you ain't got what you think you got you just ain't the bride you ain't bright material you better just start hoping you can be foolish virgin oh oh my i guarantee you said it to somebody here well no you might not go in the rapture but maybe you you'll just you'll just uh maybe you'll go in by being good to the bride and then the prophet is he's discouraged the prophet of god said that whenever you get discouraged that's when the devil really poured on you and there in that discouragement there in that heartache there looking at his little baby girl just nine months old and her little eyes crossed over heartbroken and near the devil you went to pray to god in that black curtain just come down you better know what you're talking about then but even brother branham and himself said you know what then we'll keep telling where your brother's died your mom has died we're not your mom or your daddy you've packed them away and and he starts going down the list and he finally said you know what it is he don't love you brother braham said you know it's just about that time well if that's the way it is i'll just quit but right when he started to have that thought he said oh there was something that caught there was an anchor there is something that cut and out of that darkness something said no he's slain yet i will trust him why it wasn't william branham that was living it was none other than the lord jesus christ that was living in him that in his darkest trial there was something there keeping him when he would have quit god was there to keep him and i want to tell you you might feel run down you might feel weary you might be questioning your own experience oh but there is something inside of you that is keeping you when even in yourself you would want to throw in the towel even when you would want to quit and give up and many of us have been there but something in your heart there is an anchor that is keeping you and it's going to take you to the end oh praise his wonderful name there is a man that can turn on the light oh like david would say the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life and whom shall i be afraid when the wicked hallelujah when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumble and fail though in host should have kept against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing i have desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble living in a time of trouble church we're living in a time of trouble the book of daniel talks about it we're living in a time of trouble revelations talks about it we're the group that's living there trouble on every hand trouble on every turn but let's get our eyes off the trouble for a minute for in oh praise god for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will i offer in this tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yay i will sing praises unto the lord you're not worshiping in vain church oh the mighty angel christ has descended to speak to you to call your name and he is here right now oh you can worship him you can praise him that in a time of trouble oh that was the prophet's rapture message in a time of trouble he will set you up upon a rock the revelation of the opening of this word in our day dave would say yo that the year that i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil oh thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me that prepares to table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever oh the bride is doing exploits she's walking in the light we'll just come to a close here in about 15 minutes we'll just by god's help just close out on this line of thought but the bride is doing exploits because she's heard the shout she's heard the message of the hour she's been impregnated with the word what do the prophets say the the word is here is the secret the word is in the bride she has the mind of christ she has thus saith the lord or she stands still you know what it struck me about this she she has the mind of christ we're always looking at that like it's a database like my goodness i've got 1100 sermons that i got to memorize i got a whole book from genesis to revelation and if i can just memorize all of these things i'll have the mind of christ you know that's where people get themselves in trouble self-taught complicated you know you know where people get themselves into trouble they they they read a book like okay yeah i'll go into the woods and i can just yeah if you just cut down these sticks and everything and you know i read the book i'm gonna go do it and people they they they they're self-learners they read a book and then they go out in the woods or they go somewhere and they think that they're just gonna go reproduce what the author of the book was was able to pin down and they don't realize the years the training they don't realize how many times he messed up to get it right you don't know how many storms he weathered and how many things that's that's the problem of the church we read we read the word like it's a database and then we're just going to go out there and live it but you know what i i don't i if if you got the author of the book if you just go out there with the guide if he is with you then you you don't have to memorize everything i mean you try to re memorize the road map and you try to make it all on your own but if the guide is with you he's there teaching you he's there leading you he's there guiding you he's there walking you through all of those things where you don't have to rely on your own ability oh but the mind of christ is to allow the word to become a revelation allow it to be revealed to you that you just continue to walk with him be in prayer waiting on the mind of god waiting on the word of god waiting for him to reveal himself to you oh if you're doing something wrong he'll convict you he'll condemn you he surrounded you with the family of god he's given you a pastor that you can talk to he's giving you brothers and sisters oh god has surrounded you and equipped you with everything you have need of in this journey he's given you malachi 4 5. he's giving you the revealed word of the hour he's given you access to the holy ghost to be filled with the holy ghost and if you got the message you got the word of god you got the family god what else do you have need of church you don't have to fear you don't have to worry you don't have to be upset there's a man here that can turn on the light oh don't be conformed but but be transformed by the renewing of your mind the prophet says that life only comes by the word made manifest as long as it's just in a book like this it still can be questioned there it is as long as the message remains on tapes and books it can be questioned that's why you're his victory that's why you are the vindication because malachi 4 was sent to get a bride if there was no bride there would still be a waiting for a manifestation or a vindication of the message that was sent to a bride but we're here we've received it behold i send you elijah you're the you that received elijah you are the vindication of the message so that all of the things that have been spoken is for you you're the bride without spot without wrinkle you never we've heard all of those things over and over and over and i wonder if it's become dead letter to us and we keep doubting our calling we keep doubting our election we keep getting pushed down and we have to go and have people build back up our self-esteem what is this there is a man here that can turn on the light you're walking with jesus christ you have everything you have need of he says in paragraph 190 and today the church ought to be jesus christ in action upon the earth because i live you live also and my life will be in you the works that i do you'll do also see the church has got to get to that place and he promised he would do it it has to come that way it got to be that way and he starts talking about noah i know it was the light in his day and we'll just end on this subject right here that noah was the light in his day and he came and he preached that god was going to judge the world by water and he said that that uh uh there's gonna be a big boat we're gonna have to get on this boat the animals are gonna come in two by two this is god's ark of safety that was his message and you know noah moved by faith with fear and built an ark they could have questioned moses's message but then when the boat was built they couldn't question that part then when the animals came in two by two they couldn't question that part and then when the rain started to fall they couldn't question that part you know that's what's happening right now bride modern events made clear by prophecy after prophecy being fulfilled all around us and that's the light of the hour so here moses think about this now this is this is really where i wanted to move to this is my message right here so we'll make a strong push here just a few minutes so that was the light and that noah was the light now i was just looking at this moses right god calls moses and now moses is the light he's the light to call the children of israel out and god vindicates them by signs and wonders led by a pillar of fire in a cloud by day and i just as i saw this visually i just saw and like here here's god's people and the message of moses and there's there's light just as there was light and gosh and there's light there's light in egypt but now as god continues to move the children of israel on just like the church ages the light just starts to move it's moving now out of egypt it's moving now into the wilderness and and almost you could just picture a map with a little lamp on it you could just see this this beamy light just moving right it's just moving now it's into the wilderness and now it's crossing it's coming up it's coming up to the to the the uh to the jordan river there and now the light's coming to the jordan river and god has gathered his mighty prophet to him and now the commission's going to go on through joshua a type of the holy ghost and now the light's going to cross over and now that light it's approaching jericho and it comes to the city jericho and and there just happens to be in this city jericho a lady by the name of rahab a harlot and she she notices there's some spies that have that have come from the camp of israel and she receives them into her home and she receives them into a home and and and and the king had noticed that she had received him and they sent uh messengers there to find out those those spies that had come in and they inquired and she said oh no she'd hit him up on the rooftop and the flax and oh no they're not here and and and then they went on and she starts to testify to him she's like you know what we've heard about your god we've heard how we dried up the red sea we heard about what he did to the amorites and all the men of the city man their hearts are fainting that you're gone oh she started saying i know you're god's real oh i just i can't i just know there's something real about it about your god and i i i and i've heard of all the testimonies and everything i want to ask you will you give me a token because of the kindness that i show to you and those spies looked at her and they said yes well all right we'll give you token shields i want a token but i want that token i want it for my mama i want it for my daddy i want it for my brother i want it for my sister i want it for them relatives i want it for all of my father's house oh i got to thinking about that because she had received those spies and she had asked for a token because she believed the message that they were preaching something inside and said i've heard about what your god done i've heard about the exploits over there at the ranch i've heard about the exploits in egypt i've heard about the exploits there in the wilderness and oh my give me a true token that i might be saved by my family and i might be saved and they say we'll give you a token by this scarlet thread that you've let us down out of the window that'll be a token oh my if rahab a harlot could receive two spies under the commission of joshua and she would have enough faith to ask for a mama and her daddy and her brothers and her sisters and all of her father's house what about a bride of jesus christ that has been baptized and filled with the holy ghost is an under the token of the blood of jesus christ oh and we live so far below our privileges we allow the devil to push us this way and that way you ought to just stand upon the token upon the word of the hour and say i claim my mommy i claim my daddy i claim my brother i claim my sister i claim their household i claim it all on why because you've given me a true token you've given me the holy ghost and i've received a word in this hour that i'm standing on that heavens and earth will pass away but your word will never pass away and she gathered them all in there on that jericho law and the scriptures would read like this joshua chapter 2 say now therefore i pray swear unto me since i have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness under my father's house and give me a true token that you will save a life of my father and my mother and my brethren and my sister and all that they have and deliver our lives from death oh faith faith faith is your victory if you can see it in the word of god and have faith in the word of god you can have what you ask for there you go you can see it right you've been wanting to believe for your family you've been worried about your family you've been wondering all this time and the devil's been having you in a nervous wreck why don't you just go allow faith to rest in the word of god it's right there it's there it's playing just go ahead and anchor it and believe in it and trust in it and watch the word work exploits in your life and so now joshua comes there and it says in joshua chapter 6 verse 16 8 more minutes i mean i might be 15 but we will be eight now there the air in joshua six it says and it came to pass at the seventh time so now they've they've marched around jericho on the seventh day they marched seven more times and when the priest blew the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for the lord hath given you the city and the city shall be accursed even in and all that are therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that was sent you think it was by chance that rahab encountered those spies you think it's by chance that you encountered the message you think it's by chance that god has kept you alive when you should have been dead how many times you think it's by chance you're sitting here tonight oh it's not by chance it wasn't by chance rahab was in the mind of god i could just imagine they're in heaven god was watching the planet like oh watch this they're getting close to jericho maybe all the angels were sitting around like well what is why are you gonna wipe them all out again i mean you've wiped out everybody else like don't live don't leave anybody alive and just kill them all i know what's in jericho what's special that's in jericho what's special that's in lady osea what's special that's in the dallas fort worth metroplex oh hallelujah at the light was nearing there into jericho i could see lord and the banister well i got it i got a predestinated elected see there watch she received the messengers now watch this okay here comes the shout and there with the shout the people shouted and what happened that shout was judgment and destruction to the whole city of jericho and the walls came tumbling down oh and everybody was destroyed but there was a group of people that were up there on the wall under the token message that were standing there and the shout that was judgment the shout that was destruction to the whole uh a city of jericho was was uh was was grace and mercy to rehab and her family and her whole world was destroyed around her but for rahab it was a new beginning oh i could see god's standing up there looking at ray abbott said happy birthday reb happy birthday all of your accusers all in the old city everybody that try to bring up your past it's all destroyed it's all gone it's all over because you received my message you've received a true token oh glory to god and we'll end on this by his grace see now think about this thinking now ray god had special plans for rahab all my special plans for rahab now god has taken her from her old life taking her from her old ways now he's brought her into the family of god married salman a prince in israel could you imagine if rahab kept saying to sam salmond take me back to the red sea i want to see it dried up again salmon take me back i want to i want to do all those exploits they did in the other ages god had his own exploits he had something special for rahab there was a purpose that god wanted rahab to serve that was why he called her that's why he elected her that's why he chose her that god was going to grab a hold of her and he was going to manifest his very thoughts through rahab's life and if reyab would have kept looking off this way and kept looking off that way and turn around and look into the past ages and say well i want to go back there and i want to see those mighty works i want to see the red sea i want to see the rock i want to see all these things that god did in the past when god was right there saying rahab do you realize who you are rahab do you realize who you are and rahab went on with salman and she was the founder the prophet of god said she was the founder of him and salmon were the founder of bethlehem and the prophet says preaching and why little bethlehem and he mentions it right here at the beginning and there's a man that could turn him light he said why it had to be bethlehem he says they went there and founded the city of bethlehem because it was a great wheat country he said it was the the bread place of the world he said it was the the bread place of the world and he said wonder jesus had to be born there this mighty exploits oh if rahab would have kept looking in the past for some for some vindication and some uh past work but she was walking oh church i want you to know you're walking in the calling you're walking under the revealed word of your god's pleas with you god is so proud of you you're actually doing great exploits you my people they will know their god they will be strong they will do great

everything you have need of [Music] oh church what do you have need of you imagine being born in the house of god's bread and saying i'm hungry i'm hungry i don't have nothing to eat oh my this message is inexhaustible you keep walking in the light as he is in the light under the revealed word of the hour that we've received that's how you know your god that's how you're strong that's how you do exploits personally now the third pull is not a public show god doing exploits in your life it's an individual affair don't get your eyes off of what god's done in you think back oh my has he saved you did he call you did he redeem you did he predestinate you you're walking with him just keep walking with him don't get your eyes out on everything else and think you got to manufacture this and i got to do that and and be like a rahab trying to manufacture something the church had already done but god has a great plan because you know what's going to happen here could be tomorrow could be the next day [Music] there's going to be something that's never happened in the history of mankind hallelujah i'm just fooling us enough to believe it i believe it could be next week might be in two weeks i don't know but one of these days i'm going to take my last step on this side i know that because i'm walking with him oh a virgin had never conceived but she just said be it unto me according to your word no one's ever gone in a a body change rapture in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and the whole the whole bride is gone [Music] and the world's burnt over with fire the end of time the end of all no none that's but we're living in the hour church just keep walking with him there are two rows [Music] um oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] is foreign [Music] your mountains [Music] hey [Music] is [Music] you know i can't have a better birthday present than have my son preach the unadulterated gospel but there's something else i'd like to do i'd like brother daniel hawks to come i'm going to pray for him i went to his work today and and he was wearing a necklace and i looked at him and said you look like a i mean he did he looked like a girl to me wearing a necklace he said brother he said this is alabaster some stone or something you know and he said it helps my shoulder you know and you know and i never thought nothing out you know and he'd come back out and he didn't have that necklace on so i believe that because he took that necklace off i told him i'd pray for that shoulder now either i was wrong and saying that necklace made him look like a which it did i didn't use the word i used another word that starts with an h and so anyway i believe god's word and then matthew's gospel the third poll brother brown spoke the squirrel right and he spoke the storm and all the floor but at the same time he was speaking a bride into existence amen i believe that so i'm going to pray for daniel and his shoulders going to get well because god's not going to have them walking around looking like a what's your thing and if you have any need prayer i would be happy to pray for you also but brother daniel come here i can't i know the only reason that you had that on is because that pain drove you to that we're gonna drive that thing amen watch daniel come a long way into drugs i'd meet him in his workplace and talk to him i've seen all kinds of things amen that god's calling you to get prayed for don't be ashamed amen our gracious heavenly father lord i spoke harsh words to your son he spoke to and said it's not right to give god's meat to dogs and she said that the dogs eat the drugs from the table lord i called daniel worse there's no way that you can turn and he did it from the depths of his heart that this exploit was manifested in daniel's life
