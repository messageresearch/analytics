[1:10] saint mark chapter 11. just was
[1:14] fellowshipping a little bit
[1:17] over the
[1:18] past weekend and
[1:20] just
[1:21] a little something the lord put on my
[1:23] heart on
[1:24] see if i can get out of the way to
[1:25] deliver my burden amen
[1:28] so in mark chapter 11
[1:31] very familia familiar scripture reading
[1:35] found in verse
[1:36] 22.
[1:49] the scripture reads here in
[1:51] mark 11 22 he says and jesus answered
[1:54] saying unto them
[1:56] have faith in god for verily i say unto
[1:58] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[2:01] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[2:03] cast into the sea
[2:05] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[2:07] shall believe that those things which he
[2:10] hath said shall come to pass he shall
[2:12] have whatsoever he saith
[2:16] therefore i say unto you what things so
[2:18] ever you desire when you pray believe
[2:21] that you have received them
[2:23] and ye shall have them and when you
[2:25] stand praying forgive
[2:27] if you have ought against any that your
[2:29] father
[2:30] also which is in heaven may forgive you
[2:33] your trespasses
[2:34] but if you do not forgive neither will
[2:37] your father which is in heaven
[2:39] forgive your trespasses amen and then
[2:42] also
[2:43] i want to take a scripture out of
[2:46] james
[2:47] chapter 4.
[2:53] we'll start there in verse
[2:56] 7.
[3:00] scripture reads in
[3:02] james chapter 4 verse 7
[3:06] submit yourselves therefore to god
[3:08] resist the devil and he will flee from
[3:11] you
[3:12] draw nigh unto god
[3:13] and he will draw an iron to you
[3:16] cleanse your hands you sinners and put
[3:18] your hearts purify your hearts ye
[3:21] double-minded be afflicted and mourn and
[3:24] weep
[3:26] let your laughter be turned in the
[3:27] morning
[3:28] in your joy into heaviness
[3:30] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[3:32] lord and he shall lift you up
[3:35] amen you may have your seats trust the
[3:37] lord what a blessing to the reading of
[3:39] his word
[3:41] you know as we were going through the
[3:43] the message
[3:45] perfect faith
[3:47] brother branham said in
[3:49] verse 19 the perfect faith he says now
[3:51] faith is based on forgiveness
[3:54] then and then we
[3:56] said the morning trying to get to the
[3:58] church to a place where we can really
[3:59] see apostolic times moving among us
[4:03] that's what we hung we all hunger
[4:07] it's just laying right at the door
[4:10] we see it but we want to see more of it
[4:13] amen how many have seen it how many want
[4:15] to see more of it amen
[4:18] praise god
[4:20] we want to see more of it we want to
[4:23] it to
[4:24] such a flow that it'll help us
[4:29] flow out of
[4:31] it will help us us flow out to others
[4:36] remember jesus he never used his power
[4:39] for himself he used it for others and
[4:41] that's what it was sent for
[4:44] and you think sometimes
[4:46] why a man so full of power like him
[4:49] that he would have to ever be sick yes
[4:52] sir
[4:53] and then he goes on to read about the
[4:54] book where he had the headache you know
[4:56] and it just it's just striking how you
[4:58] know we all have a common place and
[5:00] that's under the shed blood of the lamb
[5:02] of god amen and so that's where our
[5:05] fellowship is is
[5:07] and that's where our faith remains is
[5:09] what it's based on forgiveness you know
[5:12] there was a perfect
[5:13] love that that spread his arms on a
[5:16] cross called calvary amen and though
[5:20] you know we we come into this world the
[5:22] bible says we come into this world
[5:24] speaking lies
[5:26] we we were born in sin shaped in
[5:28] iniquity amen and
[5:31] and we didn't live by
[5:33] the faith that
[5:34] has been restored in this hour but we
[5:36] lived by an intellectual
[5:40] understanding right amen and so as we go
[5:44] through just want to maybe lay up
[5:47] a little bit of a thought on your mind
[5:49] where
[5:49] the lord's just kind of directing me is
[5:52] we want to
[5:54] be submitted
[5:55] to his love
[5:57] amen
[5:58] you know and and for the cause to yield
[6:01] a peaceable fruit you know
[6:03] god's called us in this time he said now
[6:06] you abide in me and my word abide in you
[6:09] you will ask what you will
[6:12] and and it is god's desire amen it is
[6:15] god's desire that we be fruitful for the
[6:18] kingdom of god amen and so we want to
[6:20] come to a place where we're submitted to
[6:23] his love so that he can yield his fruit
[6:26] in its season amen we're not trying to
[6:28] get out there in the world and rub
[6:30] shoulders with the world so we can bear
[6:32] a bunch of business fruit and have a
[6:34] bunch of stocks and bonds and and you
[6:36] know if if god blesses us with that
[6:38] that's great but we want to see the
[6:40] resurrected savior bearing the fruit of
[6:42] that brings peace you know the scripture
[6:45] says in one place he says we want to
[6:47] have peace with all men
[6:49] amen and there's so much strife going on
[6:51] in the world
[6:53] and and where is there a peace where has
[6:55] the the introduction of shalom come amen
[6:59] i believe there's a people tonight that
[7:00] have heard the call of shalom
[7:04] good morning
[7:06] aren't you grateful that god made peace
[7:08] like like when he died on the calvary he
[7:11] he said it was by the blood of the cross
[7:13] that he made peace amen aren't you glad
[7:16] you've been invited to have peace
[7:18] and that the the burden of sin no longer
[7:21] is is you're not holding the burden of
[7:23] sin no more that you've turned it loose
[7:37] this word submit
[7:40] is to leave the approval or the
[7:43] judgment
[7:45] of a plan
[7:46] to someone else for consideration
[7:50] so if you submit like the plans to the
[7:51] church
[7:52] we're looking for approval
[7:55] how many people in this world are
[7:57] looking for others approval
[8:01] you know there there's a people that are
[8:04] looking
[8:05] for the approval
[8:07] of someone to give them a thumbs up on
[8:09] twitter or whatever those
[8:11] you know give me a like or
[8:13] you know
[8:14] uh
[8:15] how can i gain someone's approval
[8:18] can i be the net you know the next
[8:20] widget maker you know that that
[8:23] you know uh makes me the millions
[8:26] you know there's something hungering for
[8:28] approval
[8:30] right
[8:32] what is that
[8:34] there's a hunger in a thirst placed with
[8:38] in a human being that drives them god
[8:41] placed that hunger and that thirst in
[8:43] them to to reveal and to expose what
[8:46] they have need of
[8:48] right you start getting real thirsty
[8:51] well
[8:51] it's 108 degrees or whatever it's been
[8:54] maybe when was the last time you had a
[8:56] drink of water
[8:57] you know
[8:59] and all of a sudden you know sometimes
[9:02] life circumstance happen
[9:04] you get you know
[9:06] you get a little sickness
[9:08] and then all of a sudden there's
[9:09] something inside that says i'm i'm
[9:12] hungry for some healing
[9:15] you know you start seeing uh there's
[9:17] some loved ones that are lost
[9:19] and all of a sudden you start hunger and
[9:21] i want to see a savior on the scene
[9:24] what is that what is that we want to
[9:26] submit to some power
[9:30] there's no greater power than the love
[9:32] of god amen
[9:34] if you've ever tasted that love in the
[9:36] way of forgiveness you're never the same
[9:40] amen
[9:49] you know the um
[9:51] the submission is to yield or to
[9:53] surrender
[9:55] your authority or your control in your
[9:58] choice
[10:00] you know
[10:02] it's it's a hard thing to die out to the
[10:04] will of it
[10:05] isn't it isn't it something
[10:08] it's almost like you have to lose all of
[10:10] your identity all what your self-worth
[10:13] was
[10:17] and that's not easy
[10:23] you know the scripture says
[10:25] in hebrews comes to my mind it says
[10:28] in hebrews
[10:30] to please god it has to be by faith
[10:33] he that cometh to god must believe that
[10:36] he is
[10:38] and he is a rewarder of those that
[10:40] diligently seek him so this is not
[10:42] something we'll just approach him
[10:44] haphazardly where all the sudden we can
[10:47] just show up and not give all
[10:52] we you know we can't just be
[10:53] half-hearted in our submission
[10:56] you know this
[10:57] the kind of love that we want to submit
[10:59] to is not a human love
[11:01] this is a love that gave all
[11:05] this is a love that
[11:07] is unending like the song says
[11:10] i mean
[11:11] to be able to stand
[11:12] and he endured such a contradiction
[11:17] with sinners
[11:19] and he was he he they could not
[11:22] they accused him
[11:24] but where did he not fulfill the
[11:26] scriptures
[11:30] you know and and
[11:31] you know if there's a is if there's a
[11:33] painful desire in my heart is to have
[11:36] the same love that he had for me to go
[11:38] out to others amen
[11:40] isn't that a craving you want to yield
[11:42] that peaceable fruit that you can
[11:45] yield your life in such a way the same
[11:47] love that he loved you with
[11:50] that you can bear
[11:52] when someone crosses you
[11:55] when someone actually
[11:56] mocks you
[11:58] ridicules you spits in your face
[12:02] and you got a 50 on that test
[12:05] are you a dummy
[12:09] and you know what maybe i could have
[12:11] studied a little bit better
[12:14] you know
[12:15] they call it taking the high road
[12:18] you know doesn't love covered a
[12:19] multitude of unbelief
[12:22] amen isn't there power of life and death
[12:25] in the tongue
[12:27] i mean
[12:28] you're talking about
[12:30] a life
[12:31] that's
[12:32] that's yielding a peaceable fruit can
[12:35] stand there so submitted to another love
[12:37] another life
[12:39] that they can
[12:41] though they've been
[12:43] cast off
[12:44] and isolated
[12:47] all alone feeling like nobody's there
[12:50] and yet you know that god hasn't left
[12:53] you nor forsaken you
[12:55] and that's enough
[12:57] and we don't have to ridicule because
[12:59] so
[13:00] that's what he did
[13:02] he held his peace
[13:05] amen i believe that love can
[13:07] help us to hold our peace
[13:09] and to speak
[13:11] when it's needed
[13:20] god we stroking you some rain it's been
[13:22] hot
[13:24] you know our farmers they're probably
[13:26] drying up parched
[13:28] you know we could pray for some some of
[13:30] the farmers to have some rain and
[13:33] you know maybe some farmers in here
[13:34] sowing some seeds of faith out there
[13:37] they can ask for some rain we want to
[13:39] see a harvest
[13:42] we want to see the seeds of love go out
[13:45] because we want to see the fruit of
[13:46] peace
[13:48] you know we can point say i want that
[13:50] one to do it i want that one to do it
[13:51] but what about this one
[13:53] you know where are we gonna give an
[13:55] account
[13:58] you know this is where we get
[14:00] i mean we we can have we can go
[14:02] rejoicing we can do the running on the
[14:04] aisles but really where the real grind
[14:06] is where the real christian faith the
[14:09] rugged is in the trenches
[14:12] you know when you're driving down the
[14:13] road and the guy cuts you off
[14:16] you know
[14:18] i like it one of the brothers was
[14:20] testifying during the
[14:22] the brothers breakfast about how the
[14:24] power of the the perfect faith that had
[14:27] been exposed in his life when when
[14:30] someone would cross him and he would get
[14:31] he used to get real angry but now it was
[14:33] a real miracle
[14:35] because he wasn't getting mad
[14:38] you know sometimes it's in the little
[14:39] things
[14:40] that we overlook
[14:43] you know there's a great victory in the
[14:46] little things if we can just recognize
[14:49] that's god
[14:51] that's god doing for me that's because
[14:54] his love for me being a recipient of his
[14:57] love he wants us to have victory in the
[15:00] little things not just the big things
[15:03] oh i had a broken back god's
[15:05] supernatural that's great
[15:07] and i made a vow i would serve him
[15:12] you know but i'm certainly grateful that
[15:14] he's teaching me
[15:16] aren't you glad you have a teachable
[15:17] spirit that's another fruit of his
[15:19] peaceable love amen that you're
[15:22] teachable you know
[15:23] oh i'm i'm i'm sealed i'm saved and
[15:26] you know ain't nobody can tell me
[15:28] nothing
[15:29] what kind of attitude
[15:36] hi
[15:39] scripture says in second timothy 3 16 it
[15:42] says
[15:43] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[15:45] god
[15:46] and it is profitable for doctrine for
[15:49] reproof for correction
[15:51] for instruction and righteousness that
[15:54] the man of god may be perfect thoroughly
[15:57] furnished unto all good works amen isn't
[16:00] that what we want we want this the
[16:02] inspired scriptures
[16:05] to give us that reprove you know
[16:08] this love that we're speaking of when we
[16:10] submit to it a lot of people don't
[16:12] understand love but praise god that we
[16:15] know that love is corrective you know if
[16:18] you have children and you just kind of
[16:19] let them run in the streets and and do
[16:21] whatever they want that's not real love
[16:25] that's that's a dodie grandpa
[16:27] but but a real father will step in and
[16:30] say you're going the wrong way there's a
[16:32] there's an enemy out there there's a
[16:35] danger
[16:36] that that's liable to take your life
[16:40] put you in bondage
[16:43] but thanks god thanks be to god that the
[16:46] scripture is given
[16:50] by inspiration of god not of man
[16:53] amen this wisdom come not from man it is
[16:57] profitable for doctrine reproof and
[16:59] correction
[17:02] and instruction in righteousness
[17:06] praise god
[17:08] you know we're living in a great time
[17:10] where we know that it's been promised a
[17:12] rapturing faith we know that third pool
[17:15] is on we know that we've been given
[17:17] authority we've been given power that we
[17:20] can speak
[17:21] creation
[17:23] it's not just taking what was created
[17:26] and and
[17:27] multiplying
[17:29] creation but now this is actually
[17:32] creation by the spoken word
[17:35] my now you're talking about
[17:38] something
[17:39] as a body
[17:40] like god's not just going to give it to
[17:42] show off we're going to need it
[17:45] we're coming to a place where like
[17:48] you know it just reminds me
[17:51] you know we want to know
[17:53] what we are what we've been called to a
[17:55] lot of times people
[17:57] if you don't know you've been given
[17:59] authority and you're speaking you can be
[18:02] speaking creation
[18:04] on things that are negative
[18:09] the scripture says the things that job
[18:12] feared
[18:14] he brought it to him
[18:17] what was that
[18:19] what was that
[18:20] because there is an authority
[18:23] in a child of god
[18:26] amen
[18:28] so we want that
[18:30] unruly member to be governed by love
[18:33] what what what does my father god is
[18:36] love what did what did god say
[18:38] concerning this
[18:46] praise god
[18:53] the scripture says in hebrews 12
[18:59] i won't be very long tonight lord
[19:01] willing would just
[19:03] share this kind of
[19:06] a direct thought about just being
[19:08] yielded and submitted to this love
[19:11] because we want that peaceable fruit to
[19:14] be manifested in our lives and through
[19:16] our lives
[19:21] hebrews 12 and verse 3 for consider
[19:24] him that endured such a contradiction of
[19:26] sinners against himself
[19:28] lest ye be wearied and feigning your
[19:30] minds
[19:32] you have not yet resisted unto blood
[19:35] striving against sin and ye have
[19:37] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[19:39] unto
[19:41] unto you as unto children my son despise
[19:44] not thou the chastening of the lord nor
[19:46] faint when thou art rebuked for whom the
[19:49] lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth
[19:52] every son
[19:54] he receiveth
[19:56] if you endure chastening god deal with
[19:58] you as sons
[20:00] for
[20:01] what son
[20:05] is he whom the father chasteneth not
[20:10] amen what an identification a son
[20:13] chastise who who loves that
[20:16] who wants to be nobody wants
[20:18] correction but praise god what an
[20:21] identity
[20:23] like
[20:25] you know
[20:27] none of us were born adults knowing
[20:30] that even jesus himself was born in the
[20:33] scripture says he learned obedience by
[20:35] the things that he suffered amen we want
[20:37] to have the right vision of the things
[20:39] that we're enduring today
[20:42] god is training us up
[20:45] god has given us power
[20:47] over
[20:48] our speech
[20:54] if you endure chastening god dealeth
[20:56] with you
[20:58] as with sons for what son is he whom the
[21:03] father chasteneth not
[21:05] but if
[21:06] but if you be without chastisement
[21:09] whereof
[21:11] all are partakers
[21:13] then are ye bastards and not sons
[21:16] furthermore
[21:17] we have had fathers of our flesh
[21:21] which correct us
[21:23] and we have given them reverence
[21:25] what shall we not much
[21:28] much
[21:30] rather be in subjection unto the father
[21:33] of spirits and live
[21:35] for ver for they verily for a few days
[21:38] chastened us after their own pleasure
[21:41] but he for our prophet
[21:44] that we might be partakers of his
[21:46] holiness
[21:48] what a benefit
[21:50] i mean
[21:51] who
[21:52] you put that reward out there we can be
[21:54] a partaker of his holiness that's what
[21:56] this thing says holy bible
[21:59] we want to be a partaker of his holiness
[22:02] what a what an entrance that's been made
[22:05] that we can be corrected and god could
[22:07] come and live his own life out and bear
[22:10] the fruit of righteousness in our life
[22:13] that's what we want to be surrendered to
[22:14] is that great love
[22:17] to see him coming in his word in our
[22:20] sanctified vessel because he paid the
[22:23] price now he can live in you he can live
[22:26] in you he can live in you
[22:29] and he can perform the very same works
[22:32] he did when he was on earth in your
[22:34] world in your situation in your work
[22:37] environment
[22:38] in your household
[22:41] now will we let him do it
[22:43] we have to come to that place
[22:45] where it says
[22:48] the submission is to yield to another
[22:51] one's authority
[22:54] to give up that control
[22:58] and be the choice of another
[23:00] well i tell you if you've ever tasted
[23:02] the love of god
[23:04] you want more of it
[23:08] it's worth surrendering to
[23:10] i don't know how the devil he's so
[23:11] conniving and so tricky
[23:14] he's like oh you don't want that the
[23:16] best thing available to man
[23:18] the very love of god in
[23:20] forgiveness to become a son or a
[23:24] daughter of god to be in relationship
[23:27] to grow in grace and knowledge my
[23:33] praise the lord
[23:43] in verse 11 it says now no chastening
[23:45] for the present seems to be joyous but
[23:47] grievous nevertheless after it yielded
[23:50] the peaceable fruit of righteousness
[23:51] unto them
[23:53] which are exercised thereby
[23:55] wherefore lift up the holy hands which
[23:58] hang down and the feeble knees and make
[24:01] straight the paths of your feet
[24:04] lest
[24:06] that which is lame is turned out of the
[24:08] way
[24:09] but let it rather be healed
[24:12] follow peace with all men
[24:15] and holiness
[24:16] for without it no man shall see the lord
[24:20] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[24:24] the grace of god lest any root of
[24:26] bitterness spring up and trouble you
[24:29] thereby many are defiled
[24:32] my
[24:34] you know we want to see the lord we want
[24:35] to see jesus amen
[24:48] you know an outstanding statement that
[24:51] brother branham made in perfect faith
[24:54] it's found in
[24:56] paragraph 132.
[25:00] he said now when we were sinners
[25:01] alienated without god in the world
[25:04] in the muck and mire of sin
[25:07] and
[25:08] and god sought us he sought us out
[25:11] in the scripture says no man come to me
[25:14] except the father draw him
[25:16] god came down in the muck
[25:18] where you were and sought you and
[25:21] brought you out
[25:23] that ought to create a perfect love
[25:26] look what you was look what you are
[25:29] what did that
[25:31] somebody
[25:33] that loves you
[25:35] can't you have faith in what he promised
[25:37] you then
[25:39] real genuine love will create confidence
[25:42] in his word amen
[25:44] oh i love that i love that and brother
[25:46] branham's making this
[25:48] it's this is where we want to
[25:49] personalize this
[25:51] you know he he he caught me when i was
[25:53] nothing and i'm still nothing
[26:03] is anybody here had something that they
[26:05] could offer god when he came to you
[26:07] i mean
[26:08] i'm nothing
[26:10] and i'm still nothing but i'm in his
[26:12] hands
[26:13] that's that's my identification
[26:16] i'm nothing if it wasn't for the grace
[26:18] of god we we'd all perish
[26:21] but i'm in his hands
[26:23] you know when the devil comes and he's
[26:25] starting to push you around say wait a
[26:27] minute
[26:28] i'm in his hands
[26:33] who can bring anything
[26:35] to the charge of god's elect i'm in his
[26:38] hands
[26:39] you're in his hands
[26:41] the devil can come make accusations but
[26:44] you could just point to a cross
[26:46] you can point to an empty tomb
[26:49] you can point to a heart that's
[26:50] pulsating with the king living inside
[26:55] i'm in his hands
[26:58] he caught me
[27:00] he loved me when i was unlovable
[27:03] he loved you when you were unlovable he
[27:05] changed you
[27:07] just like that colored sister said in
[27:08] her testimony i'm not what i ought to be
[27:11] i'm not what i want to be
[27:13] but i'm not what i used to be
[27:15] hello
[27:17] i'm not what i used to be praise god and
[27:20] that's because of love hallelujah
[27:25] she know
[27:26] she was
[27:27] she had come somewhere
[27:29] something happened
[27:31] and that's the way it is if god when you
[27:34] when i was alienated from him
[27:37] so loved me till he stooped down and
[27:40] picked me up
[27:42] it gives me confidence that he wants to
[27:44] use me
[27:46] he's got a purpose in doing it
[27:49] he's seen something in me he's seen
[27:51] something in you he's got a reason to
[27:53] save you
[27:55] look at the people that's in the unsaved
[27:57] today
[27:58] look at the millions that he could have
[28:00] took beside you but he took you
[28:03] amen
[28:05] no one can take your place amen
[28:08] no one can take your place
[28:11] you're in god's economy
[28:14] no one can do it that's his love to you
[28:18] amen in that wonderful
[28:20] god came to you in your dark hour
[28:24] when you had no hope
[28:26] when life wasn't worth living you didn't
[28:28] even regard the life that was in a seed
[28:31] form inside of you
[28:33] you were just minding the things that
[28:35] you were in front of you
[28:37] let me try to figure this world out what
[28:39] where's my place in this world am i a
[28:41] part of this group
[28:43] where am i going to make my greatest
[28:44] impact this is where my lasting value
[28:47] this is where i'll leave my legacy
[28:51] we had like a vision of
[28:53] what we thought how
[28:55] how it should be
[28:57] but god one day
[28:59] he pulled you out of that he says i got
[29:01] something so much greater
[29:05] and it gives us a confidence that he
[29:07] wants to use us
[29:08] that devil comes and says you ain't no
[29:10] good you ain't got no testimony
[29:14] why did god come satan why did god come
[29:17] and pay the price for me why did he pay
[29:20] the price for you
[29:24] he said he wants to use you he's got
[29:27] something for you to do
[29:30] amen
[29:35] praise god
[29:37] i'm glad that god's got something for me
[29:39] to do
[29:41] you know i heard it said this way
[29:44] he said anything that god that serves
[29:46] god's purpose
[29:49] is going to have a resurrection amen
[29:53] so how many in here care tonight to know
[29:55] what your purpose is
[30:00] god is resurrecting a divine love and a
[30:03] people
[30:04] in this dark hour in satan's eden where
[30:08] man is running to and fro seeking
[30:11] purpose
[30:12] meaning in life
[30:14] and yet there's a people that are
[30:16] shining the light of god's love amen
[30:18] praise god
[30:23] well
[30:25] i'm so happy
[30:30] you know this this perfect faith that
[30:33] brother branham was preaching about as i
[30:35] was digging in this i started realizing
[30:37] how little i really
[30:38] know
[30:39] what he's talking about but i know the
[30:42] author and i know there's something that
[30:44] pulsates inside that says amen
[30:47] you know he's talking about faith and
[30:49] not just any kind of faith but perfect
[30:52] faith
[30:53] a perfect faith that
[30:55] knows what the word says and how god
[30:58] wants to execute it in our lives
[31:01] to be yielded to be submitted to be
[31:04] surrendered that god himself comes and
[31:07] energizes the promise
[31:09] to make it live we can't do it we need
[31:12] god to do it
[31:17] and there's a love
[31:19] that anchors that says i believe he's
[31:21] going to do it because he promised
[31:24] he was going to bring that to perfection
[31:26] what's concerning us amen
[31:35] in verse
[31:37] or in paragraph
[31:39] 76 in in perfect faith he says notice
[31:42] where he said unto us
[31:44] he said to us if you abide in me and my
[31:46] word abide in you saint john 15 if you
[31:49] abide in me
[31:50] see if you abide in me and my word
[31:52] abides in you you can ask what you will
[31:54] now see
[31:57] he knew who he was therefore he had
[32:00] faith faith could produce what he knew
[32:04] what he was
[32:05] now if you abide in me and my word in
[32:08] you you know what
[32:10] you know what you are
[32:12] amen
[32:14] how many want to do more abiding
[32:16] i want to do more abiding
[32:19] this is where we know where we are we
[32:20] can look into the mirror of god's word
[32:22] and say i can take you at your word
[32:25] i can have a confidence of what the word
[32:27] says about me it is written of me how
[32:30] many want to grow in that and say to the
[32:33] devil when he comes knocking and trying
[32:35] to accuse and say it is written of me
[32:43] this is coming into that perfect faith
[32:47] he says
[32:48] you know who you are you ask what you
[32:50] will to be given
[32:52] won't that be wonderful tonight
[32:55] if everybody could come in the prayer
[32:56] line and say i'm a christian there's no
[32:58] condemnation
[33:00] i know that my heart is
[33:03] condemning not
[33:06] something tells me that tonight's the
[33:08] end of my suffering
[33:10] that's you believe
[33:12] you'll go away with something no matter
[33:14] how much you come in emotion
[33:17] how much you do it won't work that
[33:20] perfect faith has to manifest and
[33:23] identified itself in you as a substance
[33:28] and then and
[33:29] when it does there's nothing going to
[33:31] shake it
[33:34] shake you from it
[33:39] now
[33:43] you just trust the lord to kind of
[33:44] change something because
[33:46] the scripture is noticing and
[34:09] if your heart condemned not
[34:12] you can have confidence towards god
[34:15] you know and the scripture i i believe
[34:17] it was the
[34:19] mark 11
[34:21] says
[34:23] verily i say unto you that whosoever
[34:25] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[34:27] removed
[34:29] and do thou
[34:30] and be thou cast into the sea and thou
[34:32] shall not doubt in his heart
[34:35] you know doubt is an ugly thing doubt is
[34:38] sin doubt is unbelief and see saying
[34:41] right here if you don't
[34:42] if there's no condemnation in your heart
[34:45] you can ask what you will you know
[34:48] that's where the devil tries to snare me
[34:50] up he's trying to snare you up
[34:52] oh oh you remember that day
[34:54] do you remember that would you remember
[34:57] that day
[34:59] you remember that day
[35:01] do you remember that day when he
[35:02] appeared in the cloud
[35:05] and he restored authority
[35:07] do you remember that day he spoke about
[35:09] the
[35:10] the statue of a perfect man
[35:16] well
[35:18] if our hearts condemn us there's one
[35:20] greater hallelujah
[35:24] you know the devil is a defeated foe
[35:29] he's just bluffing us trying to keep us
[35:31] from taking the land that god already
[35:33] paid for us to possess
[35:37] blind devil
[35:49] the
[35:54] message
[35:55] we would see jesus
[36:00] in in paragraph 21 he says when a man is
[36:02] converted his eyes are set towards
[36:05] calvary
[36:06] if he's still just a little nervous if
[36:09] you don't watch it him he will go over
[36:11] on the fanatic side
[36:13] if he's just a little scholarly he'll go
[36:16] over on the starchy side
[36:19] but right in the middle of the road is
[36:20] the same sensible born again
[36:23] spirit-led endured endued church of the
[36:25] living god
[36:27] going straight down the road with christ
[36:29] that's the real coming from
[36:32] that's the real coming from both sides
[36:34] we went
[36:36] one way
[36:37] and and one went the other way
[36:40] shows fanaticism and the others
[36:42] scholarly too stiff to bow
[36:44] you know more about the word of god than
[36:47] about the author
[36:49] to know him
[36:51] to to know the word
[36:54] to work
[36:55] to know the words not life but to know
[36:58] him as life to know him
[37:01] you don't have a scholarly
[37:03] you have to be a submitted person
[37:05] you have to be
[37:08] and when you submit yourself to christ
[37:10] christ is obligated to feel that vacancy
[37:14] and that you poured out
[37:16] on the altar to him he's obligated
[37:20] to his word to do it and he will not
[37:22] fail
[37:25] aren't you grateful it's just that
[37:27] simple
[37:29] you know god's not looking for the
[37:30] scholarly he's not looking for
[37:32] the starchy he's looking for one that
[37:34] would submit their heart you know and
[37:37] it's not just a one time
[37:39] you know when i was 13 and or when i was
[37:41] 18. but it's in every day
[37:44] i want to submit
[37:46] i want to surrender
[37:49] i want to be a submitted person
[37:52] you know walk humbly before the lord
[37:54] amen
[38:01] you know another thing brother branham
[38:03] was talking about in perfect
[38:05] perfect faith he said
[38:07] you know you want to you want to know
[38:08] that these things are for you and the
[38:11] devil is always trying to say
[38:13] it's not for you
[38:15] you know
[38:16] you know about culture or where you were
[38:19] born at or how you were raised up and
[38:22] your family's broken and all of those
[38:24] reasons why it's not for you but the
[38:27] bible says he died for you
[38:29] and it's to you and to your children and
[38:32] to as many as the lord our god shall
[38:34] call and he's still calling tonight so
[38:37] these promises are for you so you can
[38:39] have faith that god said it's for you
[38:43] amen
[38:52] you know
[38:54] in this
[38:55] this really stood out in perfect faith
[38:58] in in
[38:59] paragraph
[39:00] 97 he says now you must recognize or you
[39:04] must believe what you asked for
[39:07] if you are a believer recognize yourself
[39:09] a believer recognize that these things
[39:12] are for you if there's condemnation in
[39:14] your life straighten that
[39:16] first
[39:17] see if you got condemnation in
[39:23] he says you might have
[39:25] oral roberts and a dozen people who have
[39:28] faith come over here and pray over you
[39:31] and jump up and down and pour oil by the
[39:33] gallons and still it won't move that's
[39:35] right
[39:37] what falls off from oral roberts
[39:39] meetings and that
[39:40] i checked him through the prayer lines
[39:42] and i hear that him say
[39:44] his prayer before them a man with dark
[39:46] hair and a kind of big fellow with big
[39:50] jaw that oral roberts see and and that
[39:52] certain city and certain thing yes
[39:54] that's right see
[39:56] you was prayed for such and such man see
[39:58] that but here it is here's your trouble
[40:02] see
[40:03] go make that thing right
[40:05] go out there and confess that sin to
[40:09] your husband to your wife go do this
[40:12] thing
[40:13] it'll never do you
[40:15] any good no matter who you pray for
[40:19] until they make that right condemnation
[40:22] in your heart god will not come in a
[40:23] condemned a heart condemned see
[40:26] but god don't dwell in that
[40:29] you got to make it right
[40:31] then when you do
[40:33] you have you must have faith
[40:36] if everything's right
[40:38] you must have faith and believe and
[40:40] don't be afraid
[40:41] amen see that fear that job had and
[40:44] brother branham goes down into speaking
[40:47] of it that was a that was a substance of
[40:50] something
[40:51] and that's what we don't want to
[40:52] manifest we don't want to manifest when
[40:55] condemnation comes when we did wrong and
[40:57] then now we're speaking from a
[40:58] standpoint of fear
[41:02] can we discern within ourselves if if
[41:05] what we're speaking from is from the
[41:06] standpoint of god has covered me god he
[41:10] loves me and now this great love is
[41:12] projecting out through me or is am i
[41:14] starting to get a little nervous is what
[41:17] i'm saying
[41:18] is this out of a heart of fear and doubt
[41:22] because we we're living too late of an
[41:25] hour to get tripped up by the devil
[41:28] constantly trying to tell us all of
[41:30] these things where we have to oh i'm
[41:32] going to panic i'm not gonna make it no
[41:34] god's already put your name in the book
[41:36] of life
[41:38] he sealed your eternal destination
[41:43] the price that he paid was worthy of all
[41:45] sin
[41:48] so we just want to get that thing right
[41:51] and get to go we want to see that
[41:53] apostolic faith moving again
[41:55] it doesn't matter how many times we've
[41:57] been prayed for and who prays for us and
[41:59] how much oil they
[42:01] but if we got things that aren't right
[42:03] let's make them right amen
[42:06] let's go to the devil and tell them you
[42:07] devil you've been locking me down with
[42:10] this thing for too long i'm done with
[42:12] you
[42:15] amen does there are people that have the
[42:17] courage tonight to be able to say to the
[42:20] devil i'm done with you
[42:23] you've lied to me long enough
[42:33] you know i noticed that there's this
[42:35] thing and and brother branham talks
[42:37] about in a he asked a medical doctor the
[42:40] first thing you try to do is get
[42:42] get
[42:43] to do is to have confidence in the
[42:45] medicine they're giving you
[42:47] if you haven't got no confidence in it
[42:51] you better leave it alone sure
[42:53] what is it
[42:54] it's faith that does the healing
[42:57] it's faith that does it all the time
[43:00] and isn't it something that
[43:03] medical science
[43:06] they do a lot of their testing on new
[43:08] medicines and things they have
[43:10] these clinical trials
[43:12] where they would have these study groups
[43:15] this group over here would take the new
[43:17] medicine and then this
[43:19] group of people
[43:20] they would take like a sugar pill
[43:23] and then they would test to see the
[43:25] effectiveness of the medicine
[43:27] versus the other group and so
[43:30] a lot of the people who are taking the
[43:32] sugar pills are getting healed
[43:35] what's going on with that
[43:38] you know if they got eczema and they
[43:39] come up with this new product and the
[43:41] the two thousand people over here going
[43:43] man i'm not itching as much and the
[43:44] eczema is going away and i can tell it's
[43:46] working and then half the people over
[43:48] here going yeah this is really working
[43:50] the eczema is going away
[43:52] what wait a minute
[43:53] and so it's not disclosed until later
[43:55] what is it
[43:56] it's their faith working
[43:58] it's faith that heals they call it the
[44:00] placebo effect
[44:03] see what you can believe for
[44:05] you can
[44:06] create if you let your fear go to work
[44:09] what is it going to provide you
[44:11] a bunch of chaos a bunch of uncertainty
[44:25] faith
[44:26] that does the healing
[44:27] amen
[44:34] i love this point and we all know it
[44:39] in verse
[44:40] in paragraph 114 it says so when a man
[44:43] lives by faith he walks by faith i mean
[44:47] substance faith
[44:49] he is isolated from the entire world and
[44:52] becomes a new creature in christ
[44:54] there is now
[44:57] and there now we're getting into bride
[45:00] material you're getting into rapturing
[45:02] condition now that means for each one of
[45:05] us
[45:07] not just the pastor now deacons trustees
[45:10] that means for the laity and every
[45:13] individual that walks in the world
[45:16] walks in a world with god alone
[45:19] amen
[45:20] in that wonderful
[45:22] you know what what a high calling
[45:24] god he's provided us and and that's just
[45:27] the thing though sometimes we're afraid
[45:29] to walk alone with god
[45:31] we're not going to go in the group
[45:34] now we come together
[45:36] because of what the work that god's done
[45:37] we have that common fellowship
[45:40] but oh my
[45:42] to walk with this substance faith we
[45:44] walk with god alone
[45:47] amen
[45:53] my my
[45:55] this is plunged full of good nuggets
[46:04] you know i
[46:06] i was
[46:07] like never before when i was
[46:09] when i was reading the message and i was
[46:11] hearing brother branham talk about
[46:13] the woman
[46:14] that touched jesus garment
[46:17] you know she's seen something in jesus
[46:21] that she believed that if she could just
[46:23] touch
[46:24] his garment
[46:25] that she would be well
[46:29] you know
[46:30] i'm not exactly sure if brother branham
[46:32] talked about her having
[46:34] any other scripture or any of the
[46:36] scrolls to validate that but she
[46:39] believed it
[46:41] so much so that when she got the healing
[46:44] virtue other people started touching him
[46:48] you know
[46:50] our lives when we touch jesus they have
[46:53] an effect on others they say wow what is
[46:57] the difference
[46:58] i want to go and touch jesus like he did
[47:01] and get the same result god's no
[47:03] respecter of persons
[47:08] i love it how
[47:10] he says
[47:12] here in uh
[47:14] paragraph 141 he says by
[47:17] by his faith
[47:18] in his word
[47:20] we he conquers
[47:22] we can conquer anything
[47:26] both death hell in the grave
[47:28] we know that god is god
[47:31] that perfect faith in a perfect
[47:34] god's perfect word he conquers anything
[47:36] that comes in contact with death
[47:40] he conquered everything
[47:44] death could not stand in his presence
[47:46] sickness could not stand in his presence
[47:49] flowing from him was like rivers of
[47:51] virtue going out constantly
[47:54] virtue going from his garments these
[47:57] people were laying in the shadows
[48:00] just put their finger on his garment and
[48:02] was healed when the woman done that then
[48:06] everybody wanted to touch his garment
[48:07] because they seen that there was virtue
[48:11] going out of him constantly flowing like
[48:14] rivers
[48:15] there he was
[48:16] walking walking in a world
[48:19] perfect faith because he was the word
[48:22] now if you abide in me through him he
[48:25] brought the word to you and my word
[48:28] abide in you then walk the same kind of
[48:31] way virtue flowing from you rivers of
[48:34] god's fountain and blessing just flowing
[48:37] out to the people
[48:39] amen isn't that wonderful
[48:41] that that same fountain of blessing can
[48:44] flow to others and they can come and
[48:46] touch you
[48:47] and what god can do for them through you
[48:50] oh my
[48:53] woo
[48:54] praise god
[48:56] well i'm so happy about that
[49:02] oh my
[49:09] paragraph 148
[49:12] look he knew that he pleased god my i
[49:16] believe there's there's a place that we
[49:18] can come to
[49:19] that in our testimony we can know that
[49:20] we please god
[49:23] he knew that he pleased god
[49:25] he knew that there was nothing on his
[49:27] life
[49:28] god had already testified this is my
[49:31] beloved son in whom i'm pleased hear him
[49:34] this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[49:36] pleased to dwell in
[49:38] at the day of his baptism i'm pleased to
[49:41] make my abode in here there's no
[49:43] condemnation in him at all
[49:46] now when the same god comes to you and
[49:48] is pleased to dwell in you
[49:50] please to honor your word what your
[49:52] decision is
[49:54] oh my
[49:56] you see how the correction has to come
[49:58] first the condemnation has to be dealt
[50:01] with first
[50:04] there's things that we we do that's
[50:05] wrong
[50:06] but there's a grace there's a blood
[50:09] there's a power in confessing our faults
[50:11] one to another because he's faithful and
[50:13] just to forgive us
[50:16] we're our identity is not in our failure
[50:18] our identity is in what he did when he
[50:21] died and gave us the victory
[50:23] we don't have to be afraid of the
[50:25] devil's bluff
[50:27] we don't look at each other through our
[50:29] failures
[50:30] we look at each other because he chose
[50:32] us and he paid the ultimate price
[50:45] praise god
[50:50] that's just so wonderful
[50:54] aren't you thankful to be called
[50:57] to be the voice in this last hour
[51:01] to be able to be the the very
[51:04] vessels of mercy
[51:06] to be able to live out your life
[51:09] what god's done for you and then it
[51:11] contact the world and they can see that
[51:14] god's not dead
[51:16] god cares so much that he sends you to
[51:18] their world
[51:20] my
[51:24] in james 3
[51:26] 1-2 it says my brethren
[51:28] be not many masters knowing that ye
[51:31] shall receive the greater damnation
[51:34] for in many things we all offend if any
[51:37] man offend not in word the same man is
[51:40] perfect man and is able also to bridle
[51:43] his whole body
[51:45] you know this is a very important aspect
[51:48] of our walk because it's by our
[51:50] conversation it's by our actions it's by
[51:53] what we do and say that shines a light
[51:56] to others
[51:58] so we want to make our
[52:00] conversation always seasoned with salt
[52:02] to give grace to the here amen
[52:08] and also knowing that the way that we
[52:10] judge others is the same way we'll be
[52:12] judged
[52:14] my
[52:19] brother branham saying this and and no
[52:20] it did not in paragraph 122. now the
[52:24] outside man is the flesh that's what you
[52:26] look at what we see
[52:29] and that has five inlets to the body and
[52:31] any grammar school child may
[52:34] as myself would know that the five
[52:36] senses control the body see taste touch
[52:38] smell here without that you cannot touch
[52:41] the body
[52:42] that's
[52:43] the only way that we have
[52:47] to the body is see taste
[52:49] feel smell and hear you see it you taste
[52:52] it you feel it now that's the evil one
[52:54] and on the outside now inside of that is
[52:57] the spirit
[52:59] which you become when you're born into
[53:01] this world and the breath of life is
[53:04] breathed into him
[53:05] that's
[53:06] spirit is of a worldly nature because it
[53:09] is not given from god but it is
[53:11] permitted by god
[53:13] now you got that
[53:15] for every child that's born into the
[53:17] world is born in sin shaped in iniquity
[53:20] came into the world speaking lies that's
[53:22] right so that person on the inside is a
[53:25] sinner to begin with
[53:26] my
[53:28] oh my
[53:30] i'm not going to make excuses for that
[53:31] outside guy no more he's just the sinner
[53:34] and that's the evil one and i'm not
[53:36] concerned that because what is on the
[53:39] inside is going to bring the outside
[53:41] subject amen the love of god can cause
[53:44] this outside man to come subject to
[53:47] every word
[53:55] further down in james 3 and 16 he says
[53:59] for where
[54:01] envy and strife is there is confusion in
[54:04] every evil work
[54:06] but
[54:07] the wisdom that is from above is first
[54:10] pure
[54:11] then peaceable then gentle and easy to
[54:15] be entreated full of mercy and good
[54:18] fruit without partiality without
[54:21] hypocrisy the fruit of righteousness is
[54:24] sown in peace to them that make peace
[54:26] amen praise god blessed are the
[54:29] peacemakers
[54:30] you know blessed are the pure in heart
[54:33] my this is just down to the simple
[54:35] gospel amen
[54:38] sometimes we just get back to the the
[54:40] simplicity of
[54:42] what god's done for us and how he's made
[54:44] it so plain
[54:45] it's so tangible we can be a partaker of
[54:47] his very holiness
[54:54] we're wrapping up here in
[54:56] proverbs 15 i thought this was marvelous
[55:02] proverbs 15 23 it says a man hath joy by
[55:05] the answer of his mouth
[55:08] and the word spoken in due season how
[55:12] good is it
[55:13] oh my how many can testify of a word
[55:15] spoken in season how good is it
[55:22] the light of the eyes rejoice at the
[55:24] heart and a good report maketh the bones
[55:26] fat the ear that heareth the reproof of
[55:30] life abideth among the wise
[55:32] he that refused instruction divide
[55:36] despise his own soul
[55:38] but he that heareth reprove geteth
[55:40] understanding the fear of the lord is in
[55:43] instruction and wisdom and before honor
[55:47] is
[55:48] humility
[55:50] praise god
[55:52] you know i remember the testimony when
[55:54] brother branham was preaching influence
[55:57] you know isaiah is
[55:59] isaiah yeah he was
[56:01] he was ordained of god to to be a
[56:03] prophet
[56:05] and he is a young person and he had a
[56:08] young friend that um
[56:10] his father passed i believe it was and
[56:13] and his
[56:14] he was going to be king and god called
[56:16] him to be a king and he seen that
[56:18] when his father was
[56:20] prospering in a way he seen that you
[56:22] know when a man would put god first and
[56:25] honor god's word that the blessings of
[56:27] god would come
[56:28] and and as he began to serve as king and
[56:33] he realized that all these blessings and
[56:35] things
[56:36] of a god called king
[56:38] was was blessing him and then he got to
[56:42] a place where
[56:43] he felt lifted up
[56:45] where he could do anything
[56:47] he didn't have to give account
[56:49] for all of his actions well he was a god
[56:52] called king he had an influence
[56:55] amen you know these attitudes can creep
[56:57] up
[56:59] you get you get so long where you forget
[57:02] where he pulled you out of the mire
[57:05] you forget what power of love it took
[57:09] and all of a sudden
[57:10] the reverence is lost
[57:13] oh i can do whatever i want
[57:17] but there's a people that are
[57:19] in submission to his love
[57:21] i i love your word lord i love you i
[57:24] love your people
[57:25] i don't want to be arrogant i want to
[57:27] remain humble
[57:29] in subjection
[57:30] but you know
[57:32] it became a testimony to
[57:35] isaiah
[57:37] when his friend
[57:39] he ended up
[57:41] getting out of his position
[57:44] he was he was blessed in his position
[57:47] as king
[57:48] but when he started to take the incense
[57:51] that was out of his calling
[57:53] and when he was told
[57:55] that he was in the wrong
[57:59] he had an attitude
[58:01] he ended up
[58:05] he couldn't take the correction
[58:08] you know and and you see that outside
[58:11] man sometimes can get stirred up so we
[58:14] want to defend things that aren't worth
[58:17] defending
[58:18] just turn them down
[58:20] turn them down my identity is in the
[58:24] love of christ amen
[58:26] you know that okay nature you know he's
[58:29] he uh he refused to
[58:31] he saw the humble offering
[58:35] of his brother but instead he
[58:37] out of petty jealousy he murdered him
[58:40] and that's what the enemy wants to do
[58:42] with us when we get into the wrong and
[58:45] he tries to snare us
[58:47] and we get to a place sometimes where
[58:49] we're unwilling to forgive but now faith
[58:52] perfect faith is based on forgiveness
[58:55] and so we've renounced our rights as
[58:58] believers
[58:59] to the one who loved us amen
[59:03] aren't you grateful that you have the
[59:04] ability to humble yourself
[59:07] to a love like this
[59:08] to serve a god
[59:10] that's so mindful that he's prepared
[59:13] he's going to prepare a place for you
[59:16] for where i am there you may be also
[59:19] praise the lord
[59:27] my
[59:30] you know i'll leave you with this last
[59:32] quote and we'll wrap up but
[59:35] i thought it was outstanding
[59:37] the testimony that brother branham gave
[59:40] about uh and it's in a couple messages
[59:43] but
[59:44] you know there was a young man that he
[59:46] went off uh he was going to be a doctor
[59:48] and so he went out and he was going to
[59:51] pursue his career in in india
[59:54] and he was going there and he left his
[59:58] his mother behind and
[1:00:00] while he was there he changed careers he
[1:00:02] started becoming an electrical engineer
[1:00:05] and
[1:00:05] in his practice you know he
[1:00:08] he became known and
[1:00:10] and
[1:00:11] he became very wealthy
[1:00:13] and
[1:00:15] he uh
[1:00:16] the the the the report came and i'll
[1:00:19] just read part of it here he says
[1:00:21] now the woman got
[1:00:23] poverty restriction
[1:00:24] stricken
[1:00:26] she just didn't have nothing
[1:00:28] and so
[1:00:29] uh charity was trying to come and take
[1:00:32] care of her
[1:00:33] and so they
[1:00:34] investigated the case and when they
[1:00:37] investigated they found out that the
[1:00:38] woman had one support
[1:00:42] and that was his son that was very
[1:00:44] wealthy in india
[1:00:46] and said well why don't your son support
[1:00:48] you
[1:00:50] she said oh
[1:00:51] i can't ask him
[1:00:54] i'm his mother
[1:00:57] i'd just rather take charity than ask my
[1:01:00] son
[1:01:02] don't you never hear from don't you
[1:01:05] never hear from him she said oh i hear
[1:01:07] from him once or twice a month said he
[1:01:10] writes me some of the sweetest letters
[1:01:12] that you ever read
[1:01:14] well
[1:01:15] it looked like if he loved
[1:01:18] his mother enough he had plenty of money
[1:01:21] he would have
[1:01:23] trying to take care of her instead
[1:01:25] of her trying to have charity
[1:01:27] well perhaps if he knew
[1:01:30] i was in this way
[1:01:32] he would
[1:01:34] he would care for me
[1:01:36] but said you know he doesn't know
[1:01:40] and i just feel embarrassed to tell my
[1:01:41] son like that
[1:01:43] and
[1:01:44] he still writes you sweet letters
[1:01:47] she said
[1:01:48] oh yeah the sweetest letters said
[1:01:50] he sends me the prettiest pictures you
[1:01:52] ever seen said the prettiest pictures
[1:01:55] he said so
[1:01:57] let's see some of them
[1:01:59] so she went through her bible and she
[1:02:01] began to pull out
[1:02:03] and she and you know
[1:02:05] when
[1:02:07] when it was it was what it was it was
[1:02:09] bank drafts
[1:02:11] india puts pictures on bank drafts
[1:02:15] and she had plenty
[1:02:18] see india puts pictures on bank drafts
[1:02:21] and she uh
[1:02:22] at pretty pictures
[1:02:25] she had thousands of dollars converted
[1:02:27] from in indian money into american money
[1:02:30] what was it
[1:02:31] in the ledgers of her bible she had
[1:02:34] treasures that she thought was just
[1:02:37] pictures
[1:02:38] but come on
[1:02:40] come to find out
[1:02:41] it was real value to her
[1:02:44] amen you know
[1:02:45] the enemy is just trying to paint
[1:02:47] pictures
[1:02:48] like these are just pretty pictures
[1:02:51] the devil is trying to lie and say that
[1:02:53] this is just a painted fire
[1:02:57] but how many here can say man that this
[1:02:59] is not a painted fire there's a real
[1:03:01] holy ghost there's a real promise for
[1:03:04] filler he doesn't just give the promise
[1:03:07] to leave it hanging on the shelf as a
[1:03:09] pretty picture or some childhood story
[1:03:13] book imaginary tale
[1:03:16] praise god
[1:03:18] it's become a real value to her
[1:03:21] hallelujah why don't we stand
[1:03:28] we can invite the musicians

[1:04:15] the lord's been speaking to you about a
[1:04:17] situation or circumstance or
[1:04:20] where
[1:04:21] maybe you can submit more to his love
[1:04:23] and
[1:04:25] the the fruit of righteousness can flow
[1:04:28] through you
[1:04:30] and you just want to ask god that
