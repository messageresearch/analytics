[13:57] somebody tell me you're looking good in
[14:02] spite of it all god bless you each we're
[14:06] certainly glad to be here and towards
[14:10] giving us a beautiful somewhat muggy day
[14:14] we were talking about work this week
[14:18] others were talking I was on on the edge
[14:20] listening about the whole idea of
[14:23] conspiracy theories because they're
[14:27] everywhere people were talking about
[14:30] they saw this on Facebook and they heard
[14:33] this on the news or this on talk radio
[14:35] and my goodness there's evil on every
[14:39] hand which is no surprise to us but to
[14:43] the world kind of unsettling governments
[14:47] are suspicious medicine is suspicious
[14:51] who knows who's everybody's suspicious
[14:54] and and it was kind of an intriguing
[14:57] thought and discussion as you know some
[15:00] people were blowing it off and others
[15:02] were kind of committed to this all idea
[15:04] that it's one big conspiracy the truth
[15:08] is it is one big conspiracy
[15:10] it started in heaven long time ago
[15:14] when Satan said I will ascend into
[15:18] heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[15:21] stars of God I will mount upon the Mount
[15:25] of the congregation's and the sides of
[15:27] the north I will ascend above the
[15:30] heights of the clouds I will be like the
[15:33] Most High and everything that's ever
[15:36] happened since that time has been part
[15:39] of that great conspiracy you look down
[15:43] through history you're a history buff
[15:46] Rome was nothing but one conspiracy
[15:48] after another you study the royalty of
[15:52] England it was always a conspiracy
[15:55] something was afoot every culture every
[15:59] society all down through scripture all
[16:03] down through history everywhere you look
[16:05] there was conspiracy Wars politics our
[16:09] own history in ancient Israel the
[16:14] stories are full of history of
[16:16] conspiracies Saul was obsessed with the
[16:20] idea that David was conspiring against
[16:23] him
[16:23] Absalom conspired against his father
[16:26] King David after King Solomon came there
[16:30] were many conspiracies in the books of
[16:33] Samuel and kings and chronicles some
[16:35] chapters have they mentioned three
[16:37] different conspiracies in one chapter
[16:38] and it's just an ongoing manifestation
[16:43] of that one big conspiracy but what we
[16:47] know is that despite all of the efforts
[16:49] of humankind
[16:50] Satan working through our history to
[16:54] achieve his I will
[16:57] he isn't able to overcome the great I am
[16:59] and that's the that's the blessing to us
[17:02] you know that's that's not a conspiracy
[17:04] theory that's a biblical truth that's a
[17:07] fact and and so yes there is a
[17:10] conspiracy but yes we know the outcome
[17:13] of it we know who the victor is and you
[17:15] know it's kind of this is this is not
[17:17] old news Martin Luther wrote about this
[17:21] 500 years ago when he wrote and though
[17:24] this world with Devils filled should
[17:28] threaten to undo us we will not fear for
[17:32] God hath willed his truth to triumph
[17:35] through us the Prince of Darkness grim
[17:39] we tremble not for him his rage we can
[17:44] endure for lo his doom is sure one
[17:48] little word shall fell him and we have
[17:51] the word that we know will fell that
[17:54] enemy and you know if you're in a
[17:56] physical emergency
[17:57] we're told you dial nine-one-one every
[18:01] kid learns that at a very early age
[18:04] you're in a spiritual emergency it's
[18:07] been suggested you dial 33 three that
[18:11] would be Jeremiah 33:3
[18:13] which says call unto me and I will
[18:17] answer thee and show thee great and
[18:20] hidden things that you have not known he
[18:24] goes on to say because on to say behold
[18:27] I will bring it health and cure I will
[18:29] cure them and will reveal unto them the
[18:32] abundance of peace and truth and I will
[18:35] cleanse them from all their iniquity
[18:37] whereby they have sinned against me and
[18:40] I will pardon all their iniquities
[18:43] whereby they have sinned and whereby
[18:44] they have transgressed against me and it
[18:47] shall be to me a name of joy a praise
[18:50] and an honor before all the nations of
[18:52] the earth which shall hear all the good
[18:54] that I do unto them and they shall fear
[18:58] and tremble for all the goodness and for
[18:59] all the prosperity that I procure unto
[19:02] it so I guess if we feel all worked up
[19:07] about some conspiracy or so
[19:10] torment The Devil's bringing upon us we
[19:13] could just dial 33:3 call upon the name
[19:15] of the Lord because the great I am has
[19:19] overcome that I will and Isaiah 26 says
[19:23] that I will keep him in perfect peace
[19:24] whose mind is stayed on thee let's turn
[19:28] to Psalms 97 this morning as we read it
[19:41] together at home and here the Lord
[19:44] reigneth let the earth rejoice let the
[19:47] multitude of Isles be glad there of
[19:49] clouds and darkness are round about him
[19:53] righteousness and judgment are the
[19:55] habitations of his throne a fire going
[19:58] before him and burn ahthe up his enemies
[20:00] round about his lightnings and lightness
[20:04] the world the earth saw and trembled the
[20:06] hills melted like wax at the presence of
[20:09] the Lord at the presence of the Lord of
[20:12] the whole earth the heavens declare his
[20:15] righteousness and all the people see his
[20:18] glory confounded be all they that serve
[20:21] graven images that boast themselves of
[20:24] idols worship Him all ye gods Zion heard
[20:28] and was glad and the daughters of Judah
[20:31] rejoiced because of thy judgments O Lord
[20:34] for thou Lord aren't high above all the
[20:37] earth thou art exalted far above all
[20:40] gods he that loved the Lord paid evil he
[20:44] preserveth the souls of his Saints he
[20:47] delivered them out of the hand of the
[20:49] wicked light is sown for the righteous
[20:52] and gladness for the upright in heart
[20:55] rejoice in the Lord do you righteous and
[20:57] give thanks at the remembrance of his

[51:42] this is racist by the creatively
[51:49] father your subject to have come this
[51:51] morning to worship You Lord to lift up
[51:55] your name Oh God
[51:58] they just come into the realization we
[52:01] are people created by you Lord to
[52:04] worship You Lord to give you all the
[52:07] honor and everything Lord will cast our
[52:09] crowns down and and fell at your feet
[52:12] this morning and and say that worthy is
[52:15] the lamb by the way I reminded when the
[52:18] book was taken when you stood up and you
[52:20] went in and he says John says that he
[52:23] began to cry because he knew that that
[52:26] book was so important that somebody had
[52:28] to take it and and Oh God that how he
[52:31] looked and he looked they look under the
[52:33] sea and a young earth and in heaven and
[52:37] they couldn't find no one worthy but all
[52:39] there was a lamb that was slain and the
[52:44] scripture says that he came out of the
[52:46] throne and he began to walk towards the
[52:49] book and and as you walk towards the
[52:51] book and he took it and says that the
[52:53] whole heaven just started shouting
[52:55] nobody they began to worship You Lord
[52:58] and for the lab he who died is worthy
[53:01] Lord father this morning we can
[53:04] certainly worship you this morning you
[53:06] deserves worship why because you were
[53:09] worried Lord and you are worthy this
[53:11] morning we were bound in sins and
[53:13] darkness and places and came from all
[53:16] over the places and all kinds of sins
[53:19] and all kinds of stuff Lord but the word
[53:22] lamb that was what he came by our way
[53:24] and He gave His life so that we may live
[53:27] and we could certainly say like Paul
[53:30] this morning that my life that we have
[53:32] this morning is not our own but is yours
[53:35] be lifting up Oh God and forgive our
[53:38] shortcomings and our sins Oh God and
[53:41] that's so often beset us Lord and we
[53:45] want us to be such in the clear clarity
[53:48] of mind and spirit and and in such a
[53:51] freedom that when we stand before you
[53:53] Lord and we know that you hear our
[53:55] prayers and we know that you are there
[53:57] answering to our needs

[54:34] Christ amen amen amen are you happy to
[54:38] be in the house of God and then so glad
[54:41] to see many out in the house of God amen
[54:44] amen let's just open our Bibles some few
[54:49] scripture readings the first lists open
[54:56] in Isaiah chapter 55 we're gonna read a
[55:02] couple of scriptures in there
[55:16] I believe that price to use the
[55:18] scripture not long ago we just want to
[55:23] peek up and then just continue on that
[55:27] same thought line I say we're gonna
[55:30] start from verse 3 chapter and 55 in
[55:32] verse 3 it says incline your ear and
[55:36] come unto me says here your soul it says
[55:41] here and your soul shall live and I will
[55:45] make an everlasting covenant with you
[55:47] even the short mercies of David behold I
[55:52] have given him for a witness to the
[55:55] people a leader and a commander to the
[55:58] people behold thou shalt call - shall
[56:03] call a nation that knoweth not that
[56:07] knoweth not in the nation that knoweth
[56:09] that knoweth North d shall run unto thee
[56:12] because because of the LORD thy God and
[56:16] for the Holy One of Israel for he had
[56:19] glorified II so basically he's gonna
[56:22] give you what's yours that what you know
[56:24] and what you don't know all of that will
[56:27] be added unto you
[56:28] it says Sikhi seek ye the Lord while he
[56:32] may be found call ye upon him while he
[56:37] is near let the wicked forsake forsake
[56:42] his way and the unrighteous man his
[56:44] thoughts and let him return unto the
[56:48] Lord and He will give mercy upon him and
[56:51] to our God for he will abundantly pardon
[56:56] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[56:59] neither are my ways your ways saith the
[57:02] LORD for as the heavens are higher than
[57:06] the earth so are my ways higher than
[57:10] your ways and my thoughts than than your
[57:14] thoughts for as the rain cometh down to
[57:18] snow from heaven and returneth not
[57:22] thither but watered the earth and maketh
[57:26] it to bring forth and bud
[57:29] they may be they may give seed to the
[57:31] sower and bread to the eater so shall my
[57:35] word be that goeth out of my mouth it
[57:39] shall not return unto me void but it
[57:42] will accomplish that which I have I
[57:45] please and I and I sent it for ye
[57:50] he says for ye shall go out in joy with
[57:55] joy and be led from hence with feast and
[58:00] the mountains and the hill shall break
[58:03] forth before you into singing and all
[58:07] the trees of the field shall cast a
[58:10] toccata hence instead of the throne come
[58:15] up with the fierce tree instead of the
[58:18] Brier shall come up with merrill tree
[58:21] and it shall be to the Lord for the they
[58:26] shall be to the Lord for a name for an
[58:29] everlasting sign shall not be cut off so
[58:34] what what a mercy to the what an
[58:36] invitation did those that would comment
[58:38] and I will do those things you may be
[58:40] seated
[58:41] keep your Bibles open we're going to
[58:43] read a couple of more scriptures
[58:45] let's also turn in a very familiar
[58:47] scripture reading Luke 17 we're going to
[58:50] read from verse 28 28 to 30
[59:10] the scripture says likewise also it
[59:14] shall come it shall it was in the days
[59:18] of lot they did eat they drank they
[59:22] bought they sold they planet they
[59:25] builded it says but the same day that
[59:28] lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[59:31] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[59:35] all even thus shall it be in the days
[59:39] when the Son of Man is revealed it's
[59:43] also turned to John chapter 1 it says in
[59:55] the beginning was the word and the Word
[59:59] was with God and the Word was God
[1:00:01] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:00:04] and all things were made by him and
[1:00:07] without him was not anything made that
[1:00:11] was made
[1:00:12] in him was life and life was the light
[1:00:16] of men I want you to see the progression
[1:00:20] in him was life and the life was the
[1:00:23] light of men
[1:00:24] says and the light shine ahthe and
[1:00:29] darkness and darkness comprehended not
[1:00:33] there was a man sent from God whose name
[1:00:36] was John the same came for witness to
[1:00:39] bear witness of the light that all men
[1:00:42] through him might believe he was not
[1:00:46] that light but he was sent to bear
[1:00:48] witness of the light that was he says
[1:00:52] that was the true light which lighteth
[1:00:54] every man that cometh unto the world he
[1:00:59] was in the world and the world was was
[1:01:03] made by him and the world knew him not
[1:01:06] he came unto his own and his own
[1:01:09] received him not received him not but as
[1:01:13] many as received him
[1:01:16] to them gave he power to become sons to
[1:01:22] become two sons of God even them that
[1:01:27] have believed on his name Amen so this
[1:01:33] morning just for a few moments we're
[1:01:35] gonna try to not be too long I would
[1:01:38] like to just bring out some thoughts and
[1:01:42] some things even some of the things that
[1:01:46] were or whether you mentioned by our
[1:01:47] pastor just trying to see if we can add
[1:01:52] something this morning that could be
[1:01:54] helpful to us I want to speak on the the
[1:01:58] endtime manifestation the endtime
[1:02:01] manifestation as we read the Bible in
[1:02:05] Isaiah we realized that there was a
[1:02:07] promise that God made to them all that
[1:02:10] will come to him and and even as we read
[1:02:13] in Luke 17 30 the scripture speaks that
[1:02:16] what happened in the time of Lord will
[1:02:18] come in this time and we can certainly
[1:02:20] sit here this morning and realize that
[1:02:23] we live in a time of manifestation you
[1:02:27] know I was looking for quote in the back
[1:02:30] I just it just came to my mind but a
[1:02:32] Brenham speaks I believe it's Israel in
[1:02:34] the church he spoke about even Moses the
[1:02:38] coming of Moses to Israel he speaks
[1:02:41] about the children of Israel being in
[1:02:43] bondage it says they came he said that
[1:02:46] you would look and perhaps they were in
[1:02:49] bondage in and for 400 years and sitting
[1:02:53] there and then he makes a statement he
[1:02:55] says but when the hour of deliverance
[1:02:57] came he says that those great God cogs
[1:03:01] of prophecy was grinding up towards the
[1:03:04] time God was not a minute late he was
[1:03:07] not a minute early he did it exactly the
[1:03:11] time that he planned to do it and and
[1:03:14] that gives us comfort to know that we
[1:03:16] are not here gonna be here a moment late
[1:03:18] or a moment early that everything that
[1:03:21] will happen will happen according to the
[1:03:22] prophecy so he brings forth and he says
[1:03:25] you can look at the children of israil
[1:03:27] housing
[1:03:27] Kame that everything worked out to be
[1:03:30] exactly as God planned it you know one
[1:03:34] of the scriptures or one of the stories
[1:03:36] that comes to mind is also of Lazarus it
[1:03:39] was the case where men could have looked
[1:03:41] at and say perhaps that for sure that it
[1:03:44] was late that time that that everything
[1:03:46] that happened that if he had just shown
[1:03:48] up before he died and and perhaps he had
[1:03:51] shown up just right after he died
[1:03:53] something gonna happen and but we
[1:03:55] realized that he showed up even after
[1:03:57] death to show you that even after death
[1:04:01] a man was already dead but because it
[1:04:04] was according to a prophecy because it
[1:04:07] was according to something that God
[1:04:08] showed him that God was still on time
[1:04:11] and it gives us comfort this morning
[1:04:14] because we are here according to a
[1:04:16] prophecy we are here according to
[1:04:18] something that God promised he will do
[1:04:21] in our time and we have to find the same
[1:04:24] comfort to know that regardless of what
[1:04:26] state we are in this morning it is not
[1:04:29] too late it's according to God's time
[1:04:31] and is here to fulfill the things that
[1:04:34] he said he will do as we read in Isaiah
[1:04:36] he he God comes here in his fix and says
[1:04:39] that oh that has the rain cometh in me
[1:04:42] and the waters to stir the field and it
[1:04:45] comes and it goes over the dudes and all
[1:04:47] those things and and he gives the seed
[1:04:49] to the Soron and and all of those things
[1:04:51] they said so are my words when they go
[1:04:53] forth they don't return to me void
[1:04:56] unless they accomplish the reason why I
[1:04:59] spoke it I tell you this morning we
[1:05:02] should find comfort in every word of God
[1:05:05] that he's spoken to us we should this
[1:05:07] morning have common and that everything
[1:05:09] that has spoken about us and for us that
[1:05:12] he will come to pass if God promised us
[1:05:15] healing and he says it's a healer we can
[1:05:17] hold on to that word and know that it
[1:05:20] will come to pass the scripture says
[1:05:21] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[1:05:24] word
[1:05:24] will not pass away I think often time we
[1:05:27] think about God as a man you know we'll
[1:05:30] say so many vain words and we'll say do
[1:05:33] so many things said in fact we'll have
[1:05:35] thoughts and forget about them and all
[1:05:37] those things but we realize that God is
[1:05:39] not so as we read in Isaiah he says that
[1:05:42] your thoughts are not my thoughts and
[1:05:44] and and just it says my thought just as
[1:05:47] the heavens is far from the earth
[1:05:49] my thoughts are higher than your heart
[1:05:51] and I want to say this morning we need
[1:05:53] to put some God thinking within our
[1:05:55] thoughts we need to be lifted up from
[1:05:58] the earth because we so many times
[1:06:01] roughly pound and we think in terms of
[1:06:04] counting and numbers and this and this
[1:06:06] and and God is inviting us to be lifted
[1:06:08] up into his talk so we can see what it's
[1:06:11] saying so we realize it's the seed time
[1:06:16] and as we read it and I want to say this
[1:06:19] this morning the the manifestation time
[1:06:22] or the endtime manifestation it brings
[1:06:25] us into a condition perhaps that's
[1:06:27] different from the other ages in a sense
[1:06:30] that we realize but when I'm closed this
[1:06:32] time the harvest time because this time
[1:06:35] it's the reaping time if this is not
[1:06:38] necessarily a time when anything is
[1:06:40] being soared
[1:06:40] but it's the time where everything that
[1:06:43] was sword is being manifested everything
[1:06:46] that was planted everything that was put
[1:06:48] into the ground we have come to a time
[1:06:50] where all of that is coming into
[1:06:52] manifestation now he speaks and now he
[1:06:55] says he speaks about the the condition
[1:06:58] the Bible speaks in Matthew 24 and and
[1:07:02] and we're just going to skip some for
[1:07:04] the second time and then it says for
[1:07:08] many shall come in my name and say I am
[1:07:10] Christ and shall deceive many and he
[1:07:13] shall hear wars and rumors of wars and
[1:07:16] ye shall and and ye be not you be not
[1:07:19] troubled for this things must come to
[1:07:21] pass but the end is not yet for nation
[1:07:25] shall rise against nation the Kingdom
[1:07:27] against Kingdom and they shall come and
[1:07:29] famine and pestilence and earthquakes in
[1:07:32] and in diverse places
[1:07:34] it speaks again in FEMA t chapter 3
[1:07:37] we're going to pick up from verse 2 it
[1:07:39] says for many shall be lovers of their
[1:07:42] own selves and and covetous in and
[1:07:44] bolsters and proud and blasphemers and
[1:07:48] disobedient of parents and untenable and
[1:07:51] unholy without the natural affection
[1:07:54] trucebreakers false accusers incontinent
[1:07:58] it says fear despising of those things
[1:08:00] that are good
[1:08:01] it says traitors highly high-minded
[1:08:04] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[1:08:06] god having the form of godliness but
[1:08:09] denying the power thereof for such turn
[1:08:12] away so we can read the scripture this
[1:08:14] morning and we can go in the Bible and
[1:08:17] it says and we can look across the land
[1:08:20] and say that this scripture is fulfilled
[1:08:22] today why because now the scene was not
[1:08:25] sown at the end time the end time was
[1:08:27] not the time that the seed was to be
[1:08:29] sold the end time was the time where the
[1:08:32] manifestation of all these things was to
[1:08:34] be taking places so we can look at what
[1:08:37] Paul's spoken what Paul is referring to
[1:08:40] here in the Bible what Matthew is
[1:08:42] referring to in the Bible and stand here
[1:08:44] this morning and say that we see that
[1:08:47] you know we just had a little episode
[1:08:50] here with cover 19 and all the same we
[1:08:54] can go back to the Bible and say we see
[1:08:56] that why because the scripture have been
[1:08:58] fulfilled in our very eyes we have seen
[1:09:01] that God's Word is true we have seen
[1:09:04] that the things that he said II will
[1:09:06] come to pass have come to pass so we can
[1:09:09] rest assure and I want to say this
[1:09:12] morning it's not just good enough for us
[1:09:14] to look at those things and look at the
[1:09:16] negative and see God in it because
[1:09:19] that's what often times our minds tend
[1:09:21] to go to when we see it out in the world
[1:09:23] we believe it we see it and we can
[1:09:25] recognize it but yet what God is doing
[1:09:27] within our midst and in our own flash we
[1:09:30] fail to recognize that word from the
[1:09:32] past oftentimes we have the ability to
[1:09:36] see God afar off in other people and
[1:09:39] working and doing according to his
[1:09:42] promise in the end time people getting
[1:09:44] saved and people getting delivered
[1:09:46] but yet we come to a place it becomes
[1:09:48] difficult for the promise that was meant
[1:09:50] for us for us to accept it and often
[1:09:53] time we fall into our own mind and we
[1:09:56] begin to say well perhaps I'm not good
[1:09:58] enough for it and this was just not that
[1:10:00] time well how can I be this and be this
[1:10:03] at the same time how can I do this and
[1:10:06] react our way at the same time and I
[1:10:08] want to say this morning that's what the
[1:10:10] devil wants you to do this morning he
[1:10:12] wants you to be caught between two
[1:10:14] opinions and never coming to the
[1:10:16] realization and the belief or what the
[1:10:18] promise word for the hour is he wants
[1:10:20] you to be tossed to and fro always
[1:10:23] looking always comparing always thinking
[1:10:26] and always that's why the scripture says
[1:10:28] that your thoughts are not my talk what
[1:10:30] we need to do this morning in put God's
[1:10:33] talk in a thought but God minded on
[1:10:36] behind because God minds will bring his
[1:10:39] promise worth to come the past so it
[1:10:42] continues on as we rely as we say we
[1:10:45] realized that those seeds were sown
[1:10:47] before and now it's a manifesting time
[1:10:50] we're running fixing the message the
[1:10:52] endtime seeds time again I'm just for
[1:10:55] the sake of time I'm trying to just read
[1:10:57] the parts that I have need of it says
[1:10:59] jesus says jesus said that there'll be
[1:11:03] fearful sign sites in heaven and many
[1:11:07] hearts felling fear and perplexity in
[1:11:10] time of distress it says between nation
[1:11:13] don't you see those seed time it says
[1:11:16] don't you see that see time is here now
[1:11:19] harvest time the things that the Bible
[1:11:22] will say will come to pass he says that
[1:11:25] seed has been planted now I want to just
[1:11:28] be careful in a way I say this when we
[1:11:31] say seek time it doesn't mean that it's
[1:11:34] the seed that was planted what it means
[1:11:36] the seed time it means what was planted
[1:11:39] is coming back into the manifestation at
[1:11:41] seed time in other words if an apple was
[1:11:45] planted when you say it's C time it
[1:11:48] means we have seen an Apple come to the
[1:11:50] manifestation now because when the seed
[1:11:52] was planted we didn't know what seed
[1:11:54] went into the ground
[1:11:55] we didn't know what seed went into the
[1:11:57] crowd because the scripture
[1:11:59] tell us it's by their fruit that you
[1:12:00] shall know them when we see them on Afra
[1:12:02] station then we know what seed went into
[1:12:05] the ground so the things that was spoken
[1:12:08] the things that were made that was
[1:12:10] spoken even about this day we see them
[1:12:13] come to pass he says now in the message
[1:12:16] god of this evil age he says the two
[1:12:18] spirits one of them the Holy Spirit the
[1:12:23] other one is the devil Spirit working in
[1:12:26] deception the people of the earth are
[1:12:29] now making the choices and now that's
[1:12:33] the time that we live in people have to
[1:12:35] make the decision as a believer we have
[1:12:38] to make our decisions we can't be caught
[1:12:40] between two opinions forever we have to
[1:12:43] make a decision whether what God said is
[1:12:46] true whether we'll believe what the
[1:12:48] promise is whether we believe what is
[1:12:50] made main known unto us or we'll
[1:12:53] continue to work in our own minds and
[1:12:55] continue to think our own thoughts it
[1:12:57] continue to try to figure this thing out
[1:13:00] so he says they have to make their
[1:13:02] choice
[1:13:02] he says the Holy Spirit is here calling
[1:13:06] out a bride for Christ that's the time
[1:13:10] when we living in the Holy Spirit this
[1:13:12] year calling out a bride for Christ he
[1:13:14] is doing it by vindicating his word of
[1:13:18] promise to her now it's not a lie and I
[1:13:22] want to be very very clear on where
[1:13:26] we're going because he's making it clear
[1:13:29] by making beyefendi heading the word to
[1:13:32] her what word the promise word of
[1:13:34] yahuwah what was what was spoken for
[1:13:37] that time was what the word said about
[1:13:39] the time that they were living in what
[1:13:41] it was supposed to transpire the things
[1:13:43] that were though they were supposed to
[1:13:45] see that's what he's making it clear to
[1:13:47] her it says for this age showing that
[1:13:49] Christ showing that it is Christ he says
[1:13:54] he says if a finger is supposed to move
[1:13:58] in this age the finger will move if the
[1:14:02] foot is worse to move in this age the
[1:14:04] foot will move it says if the eye is
[1:14:06] supposed to see in this age the eye will
[1:14:09] see the spirit of
[1:14:11] as it grows into the full stature of God
[1:14:15] is the age that we are living in now the
[1:14:20] Holy Spirit is here Vanda cating the
[1:14:23] message of the hour it says and the Holy
[1:14:28] Spirit is doing it so that the people
[1:14:31] that believe God will be called out of
[1:14:34] this chaos why is he doing it to get you
[1:14:38] out of the chaos now I want to say this
[1:14:41] this morning the scripture tells us that
[1:14:44] when the bride when that believer at the
[1:14:47] end time when she recognizes who she is
[1:14:50] I asked you this morning how do you come
[1:14:53] to the recognition of who you are it's
[1:14:56] this Holy Spirit speaking to you showing
[1:14:59] you the funding carat word of the hour
[1:15:01] showing you what is culture to be in the
[1:15:04] end time showing you what the promised
[1:15:07] hour for the ages and in you believing
[1:15:10] it that's when you come into the
[1:15:12] realization and I want to say this is
[1:15:14] Laurie we recognize that the world is
[1:15:17] falling apart and that's wonderful we
[1:15:19] recognize that everything is set in
[1:15:21] motion and that's wonderful and I tell
[1:15:24] you this morning it's about time we
[1:15:25] begin to realize who we are - it's about
[1:15:28] time we begin to act out what the
[1:15:31] switcher is talking about us if we can
[1:15:33] see how the world is falling if we can
[1:15:36] see how the things are going if we can
[1:15:38] see all of those manifestation don't
[1:15:40] fail to see this other manifestation and
[1:15:43] that is God moving within your being why
[1:15:46] because you are the manifestation of
[1:15:48] Christ for this hour
[1:15:50] there's no scripture that it says that
[1:15:52] Jesus will comment and you will walk in
[1:15:55] the flesh of Galilee but he will work
[1:15:57] with the robe and there people will see
[1:15:59] it
[1:16:00] in fact Birmingham says see if one come
[1:16:02] with Mal Scott hand in his hand he's an
[1:16:05] impostor he's a liar but the
[1:16:08] manifestation of this hour is Christ
[1:16:11] well with and his bride doing the same
[1:16:14] signs and wonders that he promised he
[1:16:16] will do it this time
[1:16:17] it's Christ veiled within your flesh
[1:16:19] doing the purpose of the hour that's
[1:16:22] what the world says it's going to be in
[1:16:24] the end time so he speaks and he says it
[1:16:29] says he's supposed to move he will move
[1:16:31] to get you out of the chaos it says but
[1:16:35] the devil are the Holy Spirit he's here
[1:16:38] calling his church by error
[1:16:40] he's here to saw the error to
[1:16:43] misinterpret the Word of God to bring a
[1:16:46] different understanding his ear says as
[1:16:49] usual by perverting of the Word of God
[1:16:54] like he did in the beginning see it
[1:16:57] comes right back to that seed time again
[1:17:02] he says from Eden he's here again so we
[1:17:07] realized that's what that time is that
[1:17:10] time of manifestation is to come in
[1:17:12] plain view again the scripture tells us
[1:17:15] in Matthew 13 and 30 says this is the
[1:17:20] parable of the seat Ronnie says after
[1:17:23] the master is so nice he didn't the
[1:17:25] workers went and they realized that
[1:17:27] there was stair that was sown into the
[1:17:29] ground and then it's there they asked
[1:17:31] her master she would go in and go and
[1:17:34] plug it up and and here's the answer
[1:17:36] that Jesus says he's given to them it
[1:17:38] says let them grow together until the
[1:17:41] harvest time and in the time of harvest
[1:17:45] they have they will they will say to the
[1:17:48] Reapers gather ye together first the
[1:17:52] tares and bind them to bind them bind
[1:17:56] them in bundles to be burned by gather
[1:18:01] their seed into them into my porn
[1:18:04] now is specifically speaking about what
[1:18:07] is supposed to be how that the the the
[1:18:11] denomination of the seed will be gather
[1:18:14] up how that the tear will be gather up
[1:18:17] together first and the seed will go into
[1:18:19] the barns but what random speaks about
[1:18:22] this timing is in the message the the
[1:18:25] the spoken word in the original seed he
[1:18:28] he makes mention of three seeds that
[1:18:31] were planted he speaks he says that I
[1:18:35] believe that is is near the harvest time
[1:18:38] and the seed have been planted again
[1:18:41] he's making very clear that the seed was
[1:18:44] already planted the seed was already
[1:18:47] planted
[1:18:47] he says denominational seed of the
[1:18:50] church such as defense evangelical like
[1:18:55] the Baptist and the Presbyterian and
[1:18:57] Lutheran and others and other the
[1:18:59] Pentecostals so there was a the
[1:19:02] evangelical seed and then there was the
[1:19:05] Pentecostal seed that had been planted
[1:19:07] into the Pentecost organization by great
[1:19:10] men like Oral Roberts and Tommy Hicks
[1:19:12] and Tommy Osmond great man it says great
[1:19:17] man of God and I believe that the word
[1:19:20] has been planted now he recognizes the
[1:19:26] planting of the other seed but he said
[1:19:28] but I also recognized that the word was
[1:19:31] also planted and and he says that the
[1:19:35] word was planted has been planted
[1:19:37] unadulterated away from any organization
[1:19:41] that's what the matter the seed must be
[1:19:46] planted it says the seed must be planted
[1:19:49] water before it could grow
[1:19:51] he must be watered he must have water to
[1:19:55] fall before the seed have been planted
[1:19:57] to grow now I want to say this you you
[1:20:00] cannot expect and harvest unless you
[1:20:03] plant a seed first we we we cannot have
[1:20:12] a harvest time unless there was a
[1:20:15] planting time that took place now it's
[1:20:18] big
[1:20:18] here and and it says that it must be
[1:20:22] planted and then he continues on it says
[1:20:24] the seed must be planted and it must be
[1:20:26] watered in order to grow and it says it
[1:20:30] says now you say well for Brenham I'm
[1:20:32] going to express your thought here and
[1:20:34] the water that's correct and it says
[1:20:37] skip on he says but now wait we did have
[1:20:41] in the planting time the form of rain it
[1:20:45] says if you look at the world the word
[1:20:47] in intro chapter 2 when he speaks about
[1:20:50] the form of rain
[1:20:52] it says the Hebrew raters Maura which
[1:20:54] means the teaching rain he speaks about
[1:20:57] the teaching rain that went forth
[1:20:59] he made now makes this statement the
[1:21:01] denomination teaching rain has went
[1:21:04] forth a million in 44
[1:21:07] it says the Baptist and so-and-so
[1:21:10] members of the church are Robert and and
[1:21:13] and them brothers in the Pentecostal
[1:21:16] movement in the economy become economic
[1:21:19] and then it says the great Pentecostal
[1:21:21] movement they moved into the millions
[1:21:24] that's right and the seed has been the
[1:21:27] see that as went forth and as when forth
[1:21:32] the word for the minority their group
[1:21:35] now it says then the kind of seed use
[1:21:40] you have you have planted in the field
[1:21:43] will be the kind of crop that you will
[1:21:46] rip it says if the denomination wants
[1:21:50] more members it says that's what they're
[1:21:54] going to get it says that's what they've
[1:21:58] gotten the Pentecost so one more
[1:22:00] Pentecostal and that's what they will
[1:22:03] get right but the word is going to
[1:22:06] produce sons and daughters of God that's
[1:22:09] coming to watch look at that great lot
[1:22:13] of rain supposed to be done here and it
[1:22:16] would run over the wall and leap over it
[1:22:18] says how that the great army is coming
[1:22:22] now this is 19 and 62 how the great army
[1:22:26] is coming and just a wait a minute the
[1:22:29] kind of crop is you go
[1:22:31] to get it is the kind of seed that you
[1:22:34] will put in the field now I just wanna
[1:22:38] want us this morning it's easy for us to
[1:22:41] just look at this morning and say you
[1:22:43] know you're is very descriptive speaking
[1:22:47] about the seed of the Pentecostal and
[1:22:49] the street are the seed of the
[1:22:52] Frangelico the Baptist's and the
[1:22:54] precipitation and all of them and we
[1:22:57] have to be careful this morning because
[1:22:59] we we ourselves have to every word of
[1:23:02] God applies to all of us we understand
[1:23:05] that when the word comes was it comes
[1:23:07] and we have to look at it and be able to
[1:23:10] see ourselves and make sure we pay
[1:23:13] attention to what it says and and this
[1:23:16] morning we the Pentecostal seed and the
[1:23:19] Baptist seed the reason why brother
[1:23:21] Branham is representing all those two
[1:23:23] it's because denomination it was a group
[1:23:26] of people that put God into a box it was
[1:23:30] a group of people that determine the
[1:23:32] boundary of what God can function and
[1:23:34] confront cannot function it was a group
[1:23:37] of people that had an understanding
[1:23:39] about anything that didn't a fill up
[1:23:44] their understanding or they teaching or
[1:23:46] their doctrine they kicked it out but we
[1:23:49] have to be careful that we find
[1:23:51] ourselves we don't find ourselves in
[1:23:53] that same box yet we are saying it was
[1:23:55] denominational Steve but yet we are
[1:23:57] sitting here and the promise word has
[1:24:00] been spoken to us and here we are
[1:24:02] putting God in the box and and then
[1:24:05] thinking well can God really do that is
[1:24:07] that really mean and cannot really
[1:24:09] happen to me God has promised this in
[1:24:13] the end time will not really be to be
[1:24:15] able to manifest those things we have to
[1:24:17] be careful that we don't find ourselves
[1:24:18] in the same box that these people were
[1:24:21] in because this is just not a safe a
[1:24:24] nametag
[1:24:25] but this is the behavioral or the
[1:24:28] attitude of of a believer towards the
[1:24:31] Word of God the attitude was they didn't
[1:24:33] want to believe the full Word of God
[1:24:35] they didn't want to believe
[1:24:38] realized that God can do the impossible
[1:24:40] it was a group of people that only
[1:24:43] believe certain things and rejected a
[1:24:45] part of the word but it said but the
[1:24:47] right seed has been shown because in the
[1:24:50] end time that will come a group of
[1:24:52] people and they will believe every word
[1:24:54] of God
[1:24:55] they'll believe all that's of
[1:24:57] them and it will manifest that why would
[1:25:00] they manifest it because they will
[1:25:02] believe it it's not according to their
[1:25:04] own strength it's because they believe
[1:25:06] he was a word he said we're
[1:25:08] bringing to pass and that's what was
[1:25:10] attributed to Abraham as righteousness I
[1:25:13] want to say this morning you know
[1:25:15] oftentimes we think about Abraham and
[1:25:18] everything well we realize that even as
[1:25:20] we read Luke 17 and 30 there because it
[1:25:23] says what happened whoever ahem will
[1:25:24] happen to his seed it's the same thing
[1:25:26] that happened what was the faith of
[1:25:29] every hand build upon it was built on
[1:25:31] the simple fact that this man in his
[1:25:34] life amazed us like we are heard the
[1:25:38] word of God God spoke to him something
[1:25:42] that didn't make any sense something
[1:25:45] that he didn't have a frame of reference
[1:25:47] that he can attribute it to it and say
[1:25:50] yes this match is there so yes I had
[1:25:53] heard this before no it was somebody
[1:25:55] with no frame of reference just believed
[1:25:58] the Word of God and in believing the
[1:26:00] Word of God faith was created within his
[1:26:03] heart and God brought back to pass
[1:26:07] everything that he said he was gonna do
[1:26:09] to him and I want to say this this
[1:26:11] morning ever him knew that God
[1:26:14] everything that God said unto him will
[1:26:17] come to pass why because when he come
[1:26:20] and asked him to offer his son ever had
[1:26:22] when and did it why because the
[1:26:24] scripture says that he believed that God
[1:26:26] who gave him I said from the dead that
[1:26:29] the same God is able to raise Isaac from
[1:26:32] the dead why because he was a promise
[1:26:35] huh why because he was what God promised
[1:26:38] he would come to pass
[1:26:39] oh I wonder this morning if we can come
[1:26:42] to the realization that what God
[1:26:44] promised for us is going to come to pass
[1:26:46] what God said
[1:26:48] this hour will come to pass will come to
[1:26:50] pass
[1:26:51] why because he's God and he promised it
[1:26:56] he continues on it says but the world
[1:26:59] but the word will say now he uses this
[1:27:03] that's all Robert now he brings into
[1:27:06] Plainview the other one he says but the
[1:27:09] the word will stay with the elect the
[1:27:12] royal seed Emin jesus says as it was in
[1:27:17] the days of sodom socially be in the
[1:27:20] coming of the son of man so he puts his
[1:27:25] focus on this as it was in the days of
[1:27:28] sodom so shall it be in the way in the
[1:27:30] days of the son of man he speaks out it
[1:27:34] continues on it says we believe that we
[1:27:38] are in the end time do we he asked the
[1:27:41] congregation and they said amen he says
[1:27:44] the do you believe do you believe that
[1:27:47] before you have a crop now you have to
[1:27:51] plant seed amen
[1:27:54] see why he says you see why I've let
[1:27:57] I've let the churches turn me out tell
[1:28:03] me everything call me all kinds of name
[1:28:05] everything else just stay right with the
[1:28:09] word amen there is a plant seed has been
[1:28:13] planted it's already planted friends
[1:28:17] it's already done this is 19 and 62 he's
[1:28:22] letting you know that he the seed was
[1:28:24] already they called him all kinds of
[1:28:26] name they called him all kinds of things
[1:28:28] that rejected him and all those things
[1:28:30] but he knew what his message was and he
[1:28:33] knew the purpose of his calling he was
[1:28:36] so he can plant that unadulterated seed
[1:28:39] and he was confident that he did that
[1:28:41] that he planted that seed and he says
[1:28:45] and I say it now it's over it says right
[1:28:49] she's done been planted all yes and it
[1:28:53] says and so is the denominational and
[1:28:55] the rest of them he's now confirming
[1:28:58] that this seed has been planted this
[1:29:00] seed that I'm
[1:29:01] talking about has been planted in and
[1:29:03] there's no reason for you to wonder why
[1:29:06] because I've stayed with the things that
[1:29:08] I've been told I've stayed and I
[1:29:10] preached exactly what I've been told I
[1:29:13] have done everything that God has called
[1:29:15] me to do I have come here and preached
[1:29:18] the word exactly like he taught me to
[1:29:20] preach it now I want you now to realize
[1:29:23] a shift that happened in a marriage in
[1:29:27] the image in the message the the
[1:29:30] marriage of the Lamb but when I'm says
[1:29:32] he makes this statement he says he says
[1:29:36] and now this is after reading the
[1:29:39] scripture I believe he read the
[1:29:41] scripture and everything it says and and
[1:29:44] and it says and now we know that there's
[1:29:47] going to be a bride now it's not asking
[1:29:51] a question whether there shall be a
[1:29:53] bride if the bride will will it come if
[1:29:55] we don't know what exactly will bring
[1:29:58] forth the bride he says we know that
[1:30:01] there was there's going to be a bride
[1:30:03] and that there's going to be a wedding
[1:30:05] supper in the skies he matched those two
[1:30:08] absolute statement to let you know that
[1:30:11] these things are going to come to pass
[1:30:13] there is going to be a bride and it's
[1:30:16] going to be a wedding supper and then he
[1:30:18] says that's just as sure to be as God is
[1:30:22] because here's the word he says and we
[1:30:26] know the doors that are going to make up
[1:30:28] the bride is going to be in his church
[1:30:31] and they're going to appear before him
[1:30:34] without spot or wrinkle all they have I
[1:30:37] said and they have the material on earth
[1:30:40] now to make themselves ready united side
[1:30:43] now what you to just if we can just
[1:30:46] dissect this for a moment the messenger
[1:30:48] now is coming he's making it clear to
[1:30:51] the believer he's making it clear to the
[1:30:55] people in the audience that you need to
[1:30:57] know insurance we are sitting here as
[1:30:59] sure as we can confirm that we are able
[1:31:02] to see the outside and see the seed that
[1:31:04] was sown and be able to see the endtime
[1:31:07] conditions and be the sodom and gomorrha
[1:31:10] to be able to see all kinds of
[1:31:12] the parts and everything even in the
[1:31:14] church see the gathering of both the
[1:31:17] tares and all those things it says that
[1:31:19] that we have to come to an understanding
[1:31:21] and I believe that there was a promise
[1:31:24] for the wedding supper that there's
[1:31:26] going to be a bride and he's going to be
[1:31:29] at the wedding supper those two things
[1:31:31] will not miss and I'll say this you
[1:31:34] might as well know what you're you want
[1:31:36] to count yourself in and out I don't
[1:31:38] want to say this that's not gonna be one
[1:31:41] more seed extra or once it lasts we're
[1:31:44] not gonna get there and say oh we didn't
[1:31:47] know you were gonna be here let's get
[1:31:48] another chair no but just as sure as God
[1:31:51] knows what I just gonna be that and it
[1:31:56] says here that we need to know for
[1:31:58] certainty that there's going to be a
[1:32:00] bride but that's going to be a wedding
[1:32:03] supper you know and in the scene of God
[1:32:06] was think you should say I want to be
[1:32:08] part of that I'm part of that how do you
[1:32:11] know I tell you you have to come to a
[1:32:13] place where you add it all up together
[1:32:15] where you come from and how you got here
[1:32:18] and where you going a new trajectory and
[1:32:21] be able to decide within yourself is
[1:32:23] this God or is it not God we can't be
[1:32:27] caught up within our own minds and find
[1:32:29] out how do we go from here and what's
[1:32:31] happening here as as far as making the
[1:32:34] absolute statement he's wanting to let
[1:32:37] you know that these things are going to
[1:32:39] happen this world has an expiration date
[1:32:44] the scripture says so the scripture
[1:32:52] tells us that many of them says where is
[1:32:54] the promise of his coming for since our
[1:32:57] father died it seems like everything
[1:32:59] continues the same but we find out that
[1:33:04] that's that was the mind of people
[1:33:07] that's what the mind of man does to them
[1:33:09] but the scripture tells us that it's
[1:33:11] going to coming in and we know that will
[1:33:13] happen so as he speaks it says that will
[1:33:16] come a bride and she will be and there
[1:33:19] will be a wedding supper there has to be
[1:33:21] something within us that recognizes that
[1:33:24] word to be
[1:33:25] and say I'm part of that I'm part of the
[1:33:28] wedding supper and I like this and he
[1:33:30] says and and and they have the material
[1:33:34] the word on earth now to make themselves
[1:33:41] ready if you notice she has made herself
[1:33:45] ready and I just want to ask you this
[1:33:48] question are we making the necessary
[1:33:50] preparation in order for us to be there
[1:33:53] I want to say this morning if I was
[1:33:56] invited to a party and if I knew what
[1:33:59] time and what date that party was going
[1:34:01] to be in I would make the necessary
[1:34:03] preparation and I just want to ask us
[1:34:06] this morning you know I was thinking
[1:34:08] about this covered 19 and stuff it seems
[1:34:10] like it was just a dead space and you
[1:34:13] know time of questioning and everything
[1:34:15] and if we are not careful we will drop
[1:34:17] down and pick up exactly where we left
[1:34:19] off and continue with our lives with all
[1:34:23] kind of the devil trying to cause all
[1:34:25] kinds of beasts innocent and I gotta go
[1:34:27] here I got to do this and if we are
[1:34:30] absolutely sure that we're going to be
[1:34:32] at this wedding supper then there has to
[1:34:34] be a preparation made you say what
[1:34:38] preparation the scripture says that the
[1:34:40] bride has made herself ready by what by
[1:34:43] the word that she has received and I
[1:34:46] want to say this if you expecting a baby
[1:34:48] if you know there's a baby coming you go
[1:34:52] by the crib and you're gonna go find a
[1:34:55] place where the baby is going to sleep
[1:34:57] and you'll go get the clothing of where
[1:34:59] the baby is gonna be dressing and you'll
[1:35:01] do all the necessary preparation why you
[1:35:04] know the baby's coming why you know you
[1:35:06] expecting something you know and I
[1:35:09] wonder sometimes if our lives express
[1:35:12] what we are preparing for if we are this
[1:35:16] morning
[1:35:16] I know anticipation I'm expecting that
[1:35:19] rupture to happen any minute I'm
[1:35:22] expecting him to break out any minute
[1:35:24] the scripture said it can happen in the
[1:35:26] twinkling of an eye I wonder if we make
[1:35:29] the preparation how do you prepare
[1:35:31] yourself if you invite me to your place
[1:35:34] I want to know what the visit is all
[1:35:37] about
[1:35:38] I want to know if I want to bring
[1:35:40] something I want to know what is this
[1:35:42] all about and and all those things the
[1:35:45] invitation is in the word that you
[1:35:47] receive that's what you get ready for if
[1:35:51] you know you're gonna have somebody over
[1:35:52] you transmit the message over that
[1:35:56] person is getting ready and you are
[1:35:58] getting ready to receive them and so is
[1:36:01] the Word of God of this hour that's
[1:36:03] going to be a bride and those I've
[1:36:06] received a message themselves ready
[1:36:11] we cannot kid ourselves and do all kinds
[1:36:15] of things and live all kinds of life
[1:36:17] with no thoughts at all about the
[1:36:20] wedding supper and expect to just wake
[1:36:22] up one morning and find ourselves at the
[1:36:24] table the Scriptures the brightest
[1:36:28] weather sounds ready how by the word
[1:36:30] that she has received in the word tells
[1:36:33] you what kind of dress you need to have
[1:36:34] when you show up the word tells you what
[1:36:37] kind of character you need to have when
[1:36:38] you show up the word makes you ready but
[1:36:42] well that's the work in you the word
[1:36:44] provides what you have need of in order
[1:36:46] for you to be there all you need is an
[1:36:49] invitation this morning how many of
[1:36:51] receive that invitation this one is that
[1:36:53] I have and I'm making my son's ready by
[1:36:56] eating his world follow instruction by
[1:37:03] knowing what kind of shoes I need to
[1:37:05] have in what kind of trust I need to
[1:37:07] conduct myself what kind of attitude I
[1:37:09] need why I have received the world
[1:37:14] that's that's what we need to be about
[1:37:16] we are people that have received
[1:37:19] something we're not just left in our own
[1:37:21] mind whether it's a forward and not what
[1:37:24] is yet to prepare us now I just I just
[1:37:29] want to make a lip because I'm running
[1:37:33] out of time the scripture says in the
[1:37:38] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:37:41] with God and the Word was God
[1:37:44] but when I'm speaking the message who's
[1:37:46] this Melchizedek it says God was with
[1:37:49] this heart but they
[1:37:51] intent of God from the beginning was to
[1:37:53] him to become flesh was always for the
[1:37:57] world to become flesh but whatever even
[1:37:59] tells us the word manifested is light we
[1:38:01] just read it it's the word manifested
[1:38:04] that's light life is understanding light
[1:38:08] is illuminating something that helps you
[1:38:10] see that helps you understand where
[1:38:12] you're going so now we are here the
[1:38:15] touch of God and they have to be
[1:38:17] manifested into flesh but yet within
[1:38:20] between the thoughts and the flesh
[1:38:23] manifestation
[1:38:24] that's what is known as the word what is
[1:38:26] the word is the thought of God Express
[1:38:29] and now I just want to get your
[1:38:32] attention for a minute so as long as God
[1:38:36] is not expressive we don't know what the
[1:38:38] thought is when God is not expressive we
[1:38:43] don't know what the thought is as if
[1:38:45] when he said let there be light it was
[1:38:48] the thought being expressed and now that
[1:38:51] became light and the light becomes a
[1:38:54] life of men so now we realize that same
[1:38:57] we are here if we unless we've heard the
[1:39:01] word you're gonna send me unless we
[1:39:04] don't know what for thought was but the
[1:39:07] message of the hour the Word of God
[1:39:09] revealed to us what the thoughts of God
[1:39:11] was now it just didn't reveal what the
[1:39:15] thought of God was because the Word of
[1:39:17] God has creative power to understand the
[1:39:21] Word of God has creative power but when
[1:39:24] I'm says that when God said let her be
[1:39:26] he says that God believes this one word
[1:39:29] as he spoke dead even leave the short
[1:39:32] word in other words when the word of God
[1:39:34] was it was coupled with the face of God
[1:39:37] attached to it so that when he went out
[1:39:39] and brought to exactly what God wanted
[1:39:42] to see so is every word of God the
[1:39:45] school whatever live it was hahaha it's
[1:39:48] coupled with the faith to bring forth
[1:39:51] what God wants to see it's couple words
[1:39:53] what God wants to see manifested come to
[1:39:56] manifestation so if God say that's gonna
[1:39:59] be a bride
[1:39:59] this I think I can stop it if we just
[1:40:03] don't we never heard it that's wonderful
[1:40:05] then we don't know but EFS it and
[1:40:08] we can find it in a Bible then we can
[1:40:11] hang on to it because that God won't
[1:40:13] become manifest we can cut up within
[1:40:18] ourselves so many times that's why I
[1:40:20] fight us this morning so we can put on
[1:40:23] the mind of God and the thoughts of God
[1:40:26] which are very high than our thoughts
[1:40:34] the scripture speaks about the foolish
[1:40:40] and wise virgins the very first thing
[1:40:47] that strikes you when you read that is
[1:40:50] that there were all virgins so it wasn't
[1:40:57] the fact that the way virgins made them
[1:41:03] all qualified the word went forth the
[1:41:08] virgins heard it but it was he who made
[1:41:12] themselves ready by the word that they
[1:41:15] had received was the one who went in the
[1:41:20] one who took lightly the invitation that
[1:41:22] went forth and just stay there because
[1:41:26] when the script when the voice says here
[1:41:28] comes a bridegroom going out to meet him
[1:41:30] the scripture says that they trimmed
[1:41:33] their lap the word that went forth
[1:41:35] caused these virgins to trim the lamp
[1:41:39] and be ready and make sure they had oil
[1:41:42] but the foolish version heard the same
[1:41:44] word and never made ready and I hope
[1:41:50] this morning we can see where we're
[1:41:52] coming to it's he who makes themselves
[1:41:54] ready he who takes the word within their
[1:41:57] hearts ever have believed the Word of
[1:41:59] God regardless of which situation and
[1:42:03] I'm not talking about making ready as in
[1:42:05] something that you have to produce
[1:42:06] because remember God will not take
[1:42:09] anything that man has to produce
[1:42:12] so what this is all about what this is
[1:42:14] all about is to receive the word because
[1:42:17] remember the Prophet tells us that when
[1:42:19] you receive the word you become the word
[1:42:23] you eat the word you become the word the
[1:42:26] word has the face of God attached to it
[1:42:29] to bring forth what God is desiring to
[1:42:31] see it says God has God it says it says
[1:42:41] God has gotten amazing grace to save you
[1:42:45] and says everybody will not do it but
[1:42:48] you will fight every inch of your way it
[1:42:53] says I've been behind the pulpit going
[1:42:57] thirty 31 years and every inch of that
[1:43:04] has been fight constantly
[1:43:06] it certainly has I'm not speaking about
[1:43:12] a perfect world where you just woke up
[1:43:14] I'm the bride I'm the ride
[1:43:16] I'm speaking about when the enemy comes
[1:43:19] in like a flood when you feel like well
[1:43:22] I just acted like a complete unbeliever
[1:43:24] I just I just don't deserve this there's
[1:43:27] no way that's what moves me about what
[1:43:30] brother Matthew was preaching on on
[1:43:31] Wednesday it's just to come to the
[1:43:33] realization oh I hear the stings and I
[1:43:36] see their sayings oh there's just the
[1:43:39] one like me someone I says you look at
[1:43:42] your own just where he got you from and
[1:43:44] where he pulled you from and all the
[1:43:46] things all the mistakes and all your ups
[1:43:48] and downs but you realize absent Downs
[1:43:51] didn't stop Abraham from believing the
[1:43:54] promise and if we didn't stop ever ahem
[1:43:58] you will not stop the seed of Abraham
[1:44:00] why because the same scene I was
[1:44:02] identifying ever have that same seed is
[1:44:05] identifying these children
[1:44:07] will not stop the up and down they have
[1:44:09] the mind fed up and nothing can stop
[1:44:11] them the same way that God speaks it I
[1:44:14] think and stop him nothing can stop this
[1:44:16] people why because they are believers
[1:44:19] that would make you believe there's
[1:44:21] nothing too great for them I want to say
[1:44:23] this fear this morning that's no
[1:44:25] challenge to lay the Prophet tells us
[1:44:29] that the Word of God the manifested Word
[1:44:32] of God the message of the hour will meet
[1:44:34] the challenge of the hour I ask you this
[1:44:37] morning what's your challenge you just
[1:44:39] take the word whatever that challenges
[1:44:42] there's no one here to meet the
[1:44:44] challenge there's no one here to produce
[1:44:46] what God promised let's not take
[1:44:49] ourselves and put ourselves in and then
[1:44:52] drop ourselves down we are here because
[1:44:55] God wanted us to be here I always say
[1:44:57] this and I'll say it again a man cannot
[1:45:00] put this kind of people together a day's
[1:45:04] nomadic mathematical model or an
[1:45:07] algorithm that you can run for you to
[1:45:09] have all these people here together the
[1:45:12] only thing that can do it is God and if
[1:45:15] God is able to do it if he's able to
[1:45:18] bring you here this morning oh I tell
[1:45:20] you this morning when I woke up I made
[1:45:22] my preparation to coming here from God
[1:45:25] why because there's something within my
[1:45:27] heart beating I want to be at the
[1:45:29] wedding satphone
[1:45:30] I want to sit at that table I know
[1:45:32] that's my heart display not for it I
[1:45:35] know that the place will be over there
[1:45:39] we-we'd the Word of God is higher than
[1:45:44] our thoughts he says let don't let the
[1:45:47] devil bring in confusion don't let the
[1:45:50] devil get you focused upon your own self
[1:45:53] God is not asking you to come up with
[1:45:55] the remedy the remedy is provided that
[1:45:58] we may take the word that we may obey
[1:46:00] the word and see ourselves over there he
[1:46:04] says in the message in the message the
[1:46:08] seat is not Airy to shock
[1:46:16] he says he says Revelation chapter 10
[1:46:23] the full word is to be borne into
[1:46:27] manifestation again it says and
[1:46:31] vindicated by the Spirit of God in the
[1:46:34] full in the full strength as it was when
[1:46:39] he was here on earth he manifested it
[1:46:42] says manifested in the same way doing
[1:46:45] the same thing that he did when he was
[1:46:48] you're on earth a many brewster's in an
[1:46:50] a that says Jesus Christ the same
[1:46:53] yesterday today and forever I want to
[1:46:56] just let us know this morning we you
[1:46:59] don't have to look outside of yourself
[1:47:01] for the manifestation of Jesus Christ in
[1:47:04] this hour that's not the promise of this
[1:47:07] age the Bible tells us in Birmingham
[1:47:10] uses it it says in that day shall know
[1:47:12] that I am in my father and my father
[1:47:14] knew it says all that God was he poured
[1:47:17] into Christ and then he says all that
[1:47:21] Christ was he poured into his church his
[1:47:23] body in other word he's body becomes the
[1:47:27] full function of Christ Christ Himself
[1:47:30] the head of the body and the body is
[1:47:32] manifesting exactly what they had did
[1:47:35] the body is here not doing his own works
[1:47:38] not singing its own glory
[1:47:40] but the body is here to manifest what
[1:47:42] the head is in other words if you want
[1:47:45] to see the Christ you have to look into
[1:47:47] his body and I want to say this this
[1:47:50] morning however and whether you feel you
[1:47:53] have to come to the realization that you
[1:47:55] are the one that's called to do that the
[1:47:58] word is here to make you into that you
[1:48:01] have to take the preparation you have to
[1:48:03] take that word and say God I heard this
[1:48:06] and your word closed for this and I
[1:48:09] don't see that in my life I'm taking the
[1:48:11] word because I believe that that's me we
[1:48:15] can't just go and come and go and expect
[1:48:18] God to just drop out in the sky and do
[1:48:21] some wonderful things that's not
[1:48:23] biblical so here you go know the word
[1:48:25] will
[1:48:26] you said if we believe the world if we
[1:48:28] stay with the word he says it continues
[1:48:32] on it says the world is in the sudden
[1:48:35] condition in the church went into Sodom
[1:48:38] with it and lot and his wife and I say
[1:48:42] that is in a light search somewhere
[1:48:44] who's work who's in the world that's
[1:48:48] pulling out aside from all those things
[1:48:51] and the manifestation of God has
[1:48:54] attracted its attention we are in the
[1:48:58] last day what's attracting you attention
[1:49:01] what is drawing you what is it that's
[1:49:05] motivating you what gives you one wakes
[1:49:07] you up in the morning well what is the
[1:49:09] heartbeat of your heart what is it that
[1:49:13] that just works you up in and that you
[1:49:15] you look forward to when you work up is
[1:49:18] it your job is that the things around
[1:49:21] you is it going to work and pay your
[1:49:23] bills and all those things as long as
[1:49:25] you do that then you satisfy I say
[1:49:28] there's a higher calling than that
[1:49:29] there's a higher place and it's calling
[1:49:32] us than that let's not be fearful let's
[1:49:35] not look down upon ourselves let's look
[1:49:37] at the word and let the word produce
[1:49:39] yourself it says now if you if you have
[1:49:46] those attributes of God we cannot live
[1:49:49] by creative we cannot live by
[1:49:51] denomination we must live by the word
[1:49:55] because the bride is part of the
[1:49:58] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[1:50:00] husband therefore we must be that word
[1:50:03] bride and what is that word bride oh I
[1:50:07] love this the manifestation of this hour
[1:50:11] what is that word bride is the
[1:50:14] manifestation of this hour I'm telling
[1:50:17] you I'll say like I said last time when
[1:50:20] Birmingham says it says all I'm so
[1:50:22] hungry I'm so desiring to see the Spirit
[1:50:26] of God moves why because the Spirit will
[1:50:29] come and make us into this witness into
[1:50:32] the place where we can manifest these
[1:50:34] things this Bible tells us that my words
[1:50:36] are spirit and truth
[1:50:38] so when you receive the Word of God
[1:50:41] there's a spirit of God that will come
[1:50:43] and confirm what you ever see this is
[1:50:48] the manifestation of this hour it's you
[1:50:51] you are what God has been planning
[1:50:54] question mister of God revealed here is
[1:50:57] Christ revealing God in the beginning
[1:50:59] now remember it was the son who came out
[1:51:02] of God the logos he says as the son
[1:51:05] sitting at the doorstep and the only
[1:51:07] everything that we knew about the father
[1:51:09] came from the Sun everything that we
[1:51:13] knew about God the Sun revealed him and
[1:51:16] I want to say to you this morning
[1:51:18] everything that we'll find out about
[1:51:20] Christ about his character its ability
[1:51:23] and all that it can do he's blessed it
[1:51:26] into a body so they can reveal him he
[1:51:31] came he was the fulfillment of the Old
[1:51:33] Testament and I want to say this you are
[1:51:35] the fulfilling before everything that I
[1:51:37] spoke about in the New Testament and we
[1:51:41] have to believe that you say that's hard
[1:51:42] I say wonderful you believe the hard
[1:51:45] things you believe what seems impossible
[1:51:48] you believe what you cannot understand
[1:51:55] take your heart and exploded and break
[1:51:58] now work to come to pass why because
[1:52:03] it's not for you to bring it out it's
[1:52:05] heaven you manifesting is what Christ
[1:52:08] said I do nothing except what the father
[1:52:10] showed him this bride can do nothing
[1:52:13] except Christ comes and manifest himself
[1:52:15] to her it says but it will come it will
[1:52:27] come that it is the promise of this age
[1:52:32] we are living in the church we are
[1:52:35] living in the age that is coming that
[1:52:38] his coming will be in she must be
[1:52:42] identified in him a woman must be
[1:52:46] identified with her husband for the two
[1:52:49] are one
[1:52:51] and Christ Christ bride has to be
[1:52:54] identified with him for the 2r1
[1:52:57] he is the word not a denomination the
[1:53:00] word we are we are to be the children of
[1:53:04] the light and the light is the word
[1:53:06] which is made light for this age we do
[1:53:10] know lights we do know light except it
[1:53:14] is from the word all right the word made
[1:53:17] flesh is light of the age when we see it
[1:53:22] in the Bible and the Bible said so the
[1:53:27] Holy Spirit is here on earth looking for
[1:53:31] those individuals that had ordained that
[1:53:35] God had ordained to life in this age he
[1:53:40] says as it says and as soon as it finds
[1:53:47] it it does it just exactly like he did
[1:53:51] on Jesus Christ
[1:53:52] the great super son of God who redeemed
[1:53:56] us all it comes down and he takes the
[1:53:59] place and abodes in the human life
[1:54:03] now notice a breath brought the
[1:54:07] quickening power now the quickening
[1:54:10] power that come upon Jesus quicken him
[1:54:13] to manifest every promise of the word of
[1:54:17] that day so that's the Holy Ghost so
[1:54:23] that's the Holy Spirit that comes upon
[1:54:25] us in this day if it's not the mockery
[1:54:29] of the Holy Spirit you are not the devil
[1:54:33] holy mockery if it's not the devil
[1:54:35] marking the Holy Spirit but the real one
[1:54:38] the true Holy Spirit it will manifest
[1:54:41] the promise of this our West
[1:54:48] why is it difficult
[1:54:52] because we look to the flesh because we
[1:54:56] get caught up in the flesh but I want to
[1:54:58] remind us this morning
[1:55:00] that there's a Holy Spirit here to bring
[1:55:04] the word forth into manifestation there
[1:55:08] is a word here making a bride ready for
[1:55:12] her to go into the rapture if the
[1:55:14] musician could come
[1:55:27] you look in the Bible you realize
[1:55:33] because the question we asked ourselves
[1:55:35] this morning is why me why is he calling
[1:55:39] me and how do I even get there
[1:55:41] I say just like you provided the word to
[1:55:46] Abraham to get him there he provided the
[1:55:48] word to get you there when God created
[1:55:53] Adam I want you to realize that even
[1:55:58] when Adam woke up it says God said the
[1:56:01] scripture says that God put him to sleep
[1:56:02] and he took out a rib out of him and he
[1:56:06] made of Eve and he brought Eve to Adam
[1:56:08] Eve didn't show up before Adam and say
[1:56:12] hey look at me I'm such-and-such I'm
[1:56:15] this and I'm the church I'm your bride I
[1:56:17] this she never said a word she just
[1:56:20] stood there and the scripture says that
[1:56:22] the bridegroom looked at Eve and he says
[1:56:25] this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my
[1:56:29] bone her identity came from Adam Adam
[1:56:33] told her who she was
[1:56:35] Hatem gave her hair identification and
[1:56:38] all did Eve did was to accept it and
[1:56:41] believe what Adam said and I was good
[1:56:44] enough for her she walked and she acted
[1:56:47] exactly according to Adams word she did
[1:56:51] everything exactly how Adam told her she
[1:56:54] acted like a bride she talked like a
[1:56:56] bride she did all of that why because
[1:56:58] the word that came out of Adam she
[1:57:00] believed it and I'm telling you in this
[1:57:03] end time we didn't call ourselves bride
[1:57:05] we didn't what we were we didn't even
[1:57:07] know anything about the bride we didn't
[1:57:10] know anything about the church we didn't
[1:57:12] even know if some of us didn't even know
[1:57:14] anything about the Bible we just heard a
[1:57:16] few stories here and there but all when
[1:57:19] he came just like he came to I when he
[1:57:22] called Nathaniel it says behold an
[1:57:24] Israelite in whom there is no guile he
[1:57:27] looked at
[1:57:28] in the column so he says when did you
[1:57:30] know me he said before Philip knew you
[1:57:33] before Philip find you when you were
[1:57:35] under the tree and I'm telling you in
[1:57:37] the invisible union where a bottom
[1:57:40] speaks now when he makes mention of you
[1:57:42] he doesn't say met you under the tree in
[1:57:45] the tree is saying talking about a bride
[1:57:48] that he knew before the foundation of
[1:57:50] the world you are a people and I want to
[1:57:55] say this you are put in this place so
[1:57:58] you can be tempted and if you attempted
[1:58:01] this morning that's all right that's the
[1:58:03] purpose why you were put in the flesh
[1:58:04] but no let the temptation overtake you
[1:58:07] because within the flesh crud clay
[1:58:09] something that is called the seed of God
[1:58:12] that is supposed to return and believe
[1:58:14] the Word of God so when he came to you
[1:58:17] he spoke about your natural marriage he
[1:58:20] said oh you were born and as far as a
[1:58:23] woman lives
[1:58:24] she cannot this force this husband and
[1:58:26] it goes through all the time and it
[1:58:29] shows you how impossible it is for you
[1:58:31] to get there it shows you how that your
[1:58:34] flesh can never get there this shows you
[1:58:37] the other is coming out your flesh
[1:58:39] already it's nothing to do it your flesh
[1:58:41] but he said all but before the
[1:58:44] foundation of the world I want to say
[1:58:46] this God the Creator he created his own
[1:58:50] Drive everything that he knew the bride
[1:58:52] was gonna name he married in the
[1:58:54] beginning we are here as the finished
[1:58:57] product of what was spoken
[1:58:59] we are not here to invent anything new
[1:59:02] let's see that you are what's the scene
[1:59:05] I was planning in the beginning all you
[1:59:07] have to do is just received the word and
[1:59:09] burst out of that natural flesh and
[1:59:12] receive your word why because the scene
[1:59:15] that he knew was splendid by him in the
[1:59:19] beginning so that he can come in this
[1:59:21] time and say you are my bride let's all
[1:59:24] send this morning we didn't make
[1:59:33] ourselves wide
[1:59:34] none of us woke up and you know I said
[1:59:38] oh god I'm your bottom over I know he
[1:59:41] called you he told you that he elected
[1:59:45] you he predestinated you and I want to
[1:59:49] say this morning he further just
[1:59:50] improved you this morning we have
[1:59:53] received the invitation we know what the
[1:59:57] invitation the invitation tells you what
[1:59:59] the requirements are and the invitation
[2:00:02] provides the material that is needed in
[2:00:05] order for you to be ready I want to say
[2:00:07] this morning
[2:00:08] let's walk according to the invitation
[2:00:10] let's eat that invitation let's take
[2:00:13] that invitation when when the scripture
[2:00:16] says in heaven when when when John was
[2:00:19] there and he says that he came and he
[2:00:21] says there was no one to take the book
[2:00:23] the scripture says that he knew that who
[2:00:26] whose name was on the book he knew that
[2:00:28] his name was on the book and if no one
[2:00:30] took the book that the salvation will
[2:00:32] not come that everything that Jesus
[2:00:34] taught what is in brain therefore by the
[2:00:37] lamb taking the book now I want to just
[2:00:40] say this this morning the left of the
[2:00:42] book nothing had happened yet
[2:00:46] nothing had happened yet he had not
[2:00:49] opened the sails by by taking the book
[2:00:52] they began to rejoice why because they
[2:00:55] realize that and we say not to what
[2:00:57] promised it was gonna talked about
[2:00:59] everything that this lamb died for that
[2:01:02] the blade will be come to a fully
[2:01:04] proficient and therefore that's why we
[2:01:07] have to come this morning
[2:01:08] when we read the word and realize what
[2:01:10] he's doing within our time when we read
[2:01:12] the promise of the hour we got a
[2:01:14] rejoicing to that why because everything
[2:01:17] that the word says he will come to pass
[2:01:20] why because it's no longer just a
[2:01:24] thought it's been spoken and if it's
[2:01:28] been spoken right it's going to come
[2:01:30] back god bless should have smoked let's
[2:01:33] just my hat our gracious father was so

[2:02:00] live in this age

[2:11:03] our brother Billy said how eve was
[2:11:06] standing there
[2:11:07] oh she she maybe didn't know she didn't
[2:11:09] know anything she didn't know where she
[2:11:10] came from she didn't even know why she
[2:11:13] was standing there but then all of a
[2:11:15] sudden her headship came unto her her
[2:11:17] husband and said your bone of my bone
[2:11:20] and flesh of my flesh you realize that's
[2:11:22] what the message is done in this hour oh

[2:11:33] understand why our life was so confusing
[2:11:35] and why was so peculiar why nothing in
[2:11:38] the world would satisfy us we tried this
[2:11:40] and we try that and then one day
[2:11:43] oh Jesus Christ came and said you are
[2:11:46] flesh of my flesh your bone of my bone
[2:11:49] your life of my life you are my bride
[2:11:51] and all of a sudden we started looking
[2:11:54] at him who's our identification and we
[2:11:56] see everything that's in him and he's
[2:11:57] telling us we are him and we look at
[2:11:59] ourselves and we start to worry about
[2:12:01] all of our conditions and all of us off
[2:12:03] and all of my failure sorry the
[2:12:04] anointing scale up again I better stop
[2:12:06] all that we get to looking around and we

[2:12:10] failures and he says just look at me

[2:12:16] and as we start looking at that word he
[2:12:19] just keeps telling us you're an

[2:12:54] your word to know that you have called
[2:12:58] us Lord you've elected us and you've
[2:13:01] chosen us to think Lord Jesus that you
[2:13:05] had a thought in your mind before the
[2:13:07] world had ever formed that you want to
[2:13:09] do achieve a bride not only achieve a
[2:13:13] bride that you would achieve a bride in
[2:13:15] the wickedness most darkest time that
[2:13:18] the world had ever known
[2:13:19] well you'd predestinate a bride that
[2:13:21] could not fall you'd predestinate a
[2:13:24] bride that would overcome you
[2:13:26] predestinated a bride that would be able
[2:13:29] to set their wings to the winds of faith
[2:13:30] and arise above it all order rejoicing
[2:13:34] in that Lord we rejoice that we're
[2:13:36] living in the manifesting time of those
[2:13:38] seeds and that we are your word seed
[2:13:41] that is coming into maturity we love you
