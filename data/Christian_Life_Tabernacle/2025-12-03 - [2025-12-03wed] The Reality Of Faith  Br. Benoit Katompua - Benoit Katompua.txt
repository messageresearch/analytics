As they continue to play that, we'll ask brother Andrew [music] to come and just open the service in prayer. Also, if there would be an unspoken prayer request, you just want to [music] make that known by an uplifted hand. We'll ask the brothers uh to come at this time [music] and we'll also take up the tithes and offerings. Amen. It's [music] good to have brother Andrew back and brother Billy back with us in service. Amen. I'm looking forward to what God has for [music] us this evening. God bless you, buddy. Amen. So good to be back and be with everyone. How many is expecting to hear from Jesus? I know that's my heart's desire. And [music] to lift up the name of Jesus, the one who set us free, who healed us, who brought us here tonight and has [music] something very special. You know, I think that we just want to shake off those heavy bands and [music] you know, this the expectation for a special meeting, you know, we're [music] able to somehow turn loose of the things of the world and what is was weighing on us. I say if [music] we just can have that same expectation tonight. I believe that God can do great things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us bind our hearts together for the needs that [music] are upon the loved ones. You've know the request. We've seen the testimony of the young brother that had the all of the skin grafts. Oh, just whatever you have need of, God [music] is able. Let's pray together. Our precious Lord, it's so good Lord to know that you're our father. And Lord, there was one that came and gave all, Lord. And [music] you spilled that blood, Lord, that can make a way for us. Lord, we're [music] so grateful, Lord, tonight that that wasn't the blood of a man, but that was the blood of God that loosed us from sin and the shackles and bondage, Lord, that we can come rejoicing knowing that we've been [music] set free, Father. Lord, here we are here, Lord, in that freedom and that liberty to worship you and to praise your great name, Father. You see the hearts, Lord. You see [music] the need, Lord. We're so under expectation, Lord, as we're binding our hearts together, Lord, for the needs. And Lord, you know the secret thoughts, Lord, that Lord, it's it's [music] a desire that we want to be more like you, Lord. It's it's a desire to live like you lived. And [music] oh God, we pray tonight, Lord, as our hearts are looking to you, Lord, that you'd speak to us, Lord, and that you would make the change, Lord, in our heart that, oh God, we can see you for who you are, Lord. Grant revelation, Lord. Grant a special [music] service tonight, Lord. Use the man of God, use testimonies, songs, Lord. Even hear our prayer, Father. We just pray for our pastor, Lord. I pray you bless him, Lord. And even the tithes and offerings that will be collected here tonight, Lord. We pray that [music] you'd use him, Lord, and may it bring souls to the kingdom. Father, we commit this service from [music] beginning to end, asking you'd be glorified in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You may have your seats. Well, I am thinking of the [music] rapture in our blessed home. Oh, [singing] and the redeemed are gathering. [music] And how we'll raise our heavenly in that city. Oh, [music] in the redeemed our gathering. Oh, [music and singing] hallelujah. With the redeemer, our [music and singing] gathering. Oh, wash our soul and [music] our sin.

We believe they say this mountain can't be moved. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's good to be in his presence. Just looking forward to what the Lord would have for us this evening. Let's just sing this song as we start [music] to change the order of the service. Y'all can help me. They say this mountain can't be moved. [music] Maybe I'll have some of y'all help me get that started if you want to help me. Do we know this one? They say this mountain can't be moved. They [singing] say these chains [music] will never break. [singing] But they don't know you [music] like we do. There [singing] is power in your [music] name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So much power in your [singing] name. [music] I move along. [singing] [music] God [singing] we believe. God we believe [music] for it. From the impossible we'll see a [music and singing] miracle. God we believe. God we believe [music] for it. We know that [music] for there is [music] still we [music] in your [music] name. [singing] So much power [music] &gt;&gt; in your name. [singing] [music] [music] God we [music] impos [music and singing] God we believe. God we believe [music] for it. You said [music] I believe [music] it is [music] [singing] to say it. Oh, [music] I believe it. Oh, you said [music] it. It is done. great [music] we [music] might not we from [singing] thee will see a miracle [music and singing] that we God, we believe [music] forever. &gt;&gt; You said it. Oh, you say [music] I believe. Oh, [music and singing] it is. hope you stay. I believe [music] to say [music] I [music] move all [singing] the great [music] wee. [music] Oh [singing] God for him [music] from the impossible will see a [music] miracle. [singing] God we believe God we believe [music and singing] for him. Hallelujah. Do you believe for him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go before him in prayer. [music] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, truly what a fitting song to that which you put on my heart. Lord Jesus, Lord, I pray you spend a [music] little time with us now, Father. Break open your word, Father. Speak to [music] your children, Lord. Something, Lord, that may be a blessing to them. Father, set me aside, Lord Jesus. You be the one that takes control of the [music] vessel. Father, a man could do but so much. Study, put some notes together, [music] think on a subject. Father, but unless you come, Father, you be the amen to what you've allow us to study, Father. Then it's all for nothing, Father. We didn't come here for nothing, Lord. But we've come because you said where two or three are gathered in your midst, you will be there, Lord Jesus. We know who's here. We know who's present, Lord Jesus. Nothing is done in vain if it's done in your name, Lord Jesus. Father, we [music] long to see you, Father, and hear from you. Help us, Lord Jesus. We love you, Lord Jesus. [music] Calm my nerves, Father. We ask this in the precious, mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We're so thankful for having brought [music] Brother Billy back and Brother Andrew, Lord Jesus, from their travels. Father, be with us [music] now. We thank you. We ask this in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, musicians. While you're standing, we'll just go ahead and read in um Second Thessalonians. We won't be long. I just want to just an anchor this point that struck my heart so much listening to our pastor Sunday morning and brother Matthew preaching Sunday night. I trust we all enjoy the services. It was truly good the choice of faith and uh identified by the pillar of fire. Such a blessing to know what we've been identified with in this hour. It reads uh 2 Thessalonians 1:4-5. So that we ourselves glory in you and the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God. What is the manifest token of the righteous judgment of God? It's the enduring with patience the persecutions and the tribulations. He says that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which ye also suffer. We'll also turn to Hebrews 11:1 and2. It reads, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated for a moment. Now I I just love when God takes control of a service, when God takes control of of everything because when when man's got a part to play, he messes it up. So, I'm I'm glad God's in it because you just saying they say this mountain can't be moved. &gt;&gt; They say these chains will never break. But they don't know you like we do. &gt;&gt; There is power in your name. &gt;&gt; See, the only way you can say that is because you had to have first experienced a mountain that they said could not be moved. And then when he moved it, now you can say they don't know you like we do. &gt;&gt; There is power in the name because you've experienced that power. &gt;&gt; You just said move the immovable. &gt;&gt; Break the unre unbreakable. &gt;&gt; God, we believe. &gt;&gt; Now, did we just sing it because it's a good song and it's got a good rhythm and it sounds good or did we sing it because it's actually got meaning to us? &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'm thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; You also sang from the impossible. &gt;&gt; We see a miracle. &gt;&gt; God we believe. God we believe it. He said and then you sang one moment. I love this song. In the second verse, you said, "We know that hope is never lost, &gt;&gt; for there is still an empty grave. &gt;&gt; God, we believe no matter what, there is power in your name." Hallelujah. So much power in your name. &gt;&gt; I want to speak to you a little subject. I I'll title it the reality of faith. &gt;&gt; You know, my I I don't even know where to launch from, &gt;&gt; but we'll just we'll just go. It says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen, for by it the elders obtained a good report." In Hebrews 11:1, the King James version translate uses translation uses substance to mean a firm foundation, assurance or guarantee for things hoped for. The original Greek word hypothesis means that which stands under and implies that faith gives reality, &gt;&gt; confidence, and a tidal deed to unseen promises from God, &gt;&gt; allowing believers to act on them with conviction. Hypothesis can be understood as the basis of foundation upon which hope is built, assurance, and confidence. Faith provides a deep sense of certainty and confidence that God's promises will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; I want you to keep in mind the the song you just sang, even if they aren't visible yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Reality and title deed in a legal sense. It can refer to a title deed, which is a document that guarantees ownership and make something real in a legal sense. For believers, faith serves as the title deed for God's promises. &gt;&gt; Now, we know faith is possessive. Faith is a is a victory. Faith conquers. Faith overcomes. &gt;&gt; You'll hear a prophet of God describe it and says faith beats down. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's that's an interesting description that he uses, but it's true. Anything that stands above or in line with the things of God, faith must triumph over. &gt;&gt; Faith is not here to make peace with the things of go with things of the world. Faith is to tear completely down the things of the world to bring you into a higher form of living. &gt;&gt; You become a possessor. Like you own. It's like if if I told you, hey, I wrote your name on this title for this property, this big batch. You're like, "Oh, really? You put my name on it?" Well, if your name's on the title deed, you have ownership of that. &gt;&gt; Nobody could come in and say, "That belongs to me. My great so- and so had it." And then this, that, and the third. The question is going to be said, "Whose name is on the deed? That's the person that owns it." See, oh, thank you, Lord. You might think because you came from a family that, you know, that wouldn't born, they don't have a long history of people born in the message. You don't have a long history of well this is just generation to generation to generation passed down. I had to believe. You might think that because of that that somehow you don't get the same benefits but you're you're still a son. You're still a daughter. Your true existence is not the lineage that came before you. Your true existence is what he said it was. And he said he had you in mind in the beginning. You were a part of him then since then. So then it didn't really matter how you came here. All that matters is you are here. And if you are here, then you are a possessor of all the divine promises of God. Every promise in the book truly is mine. &gt;&gt; I love what our pastor said. He said, "Faith is how you look at it." And that struck so much because what tends to happen is we put the wrong perspective when it comes to the things of God. somebody I care uh deeply for and have a lot of love for made the statement and said, "I feel like the devil. I'm being made to feel like the devil." Like every action that I do, everything that I do, somehow I'm being made to feel like the devil. I go to church, the the minister is preaching and I feel like he's preaching against me. &gt;&gt; He's attacking me. Like I'm the I'm the terrible person. Like I've done something wrong. You see, that's not God. that thing that tells you, "Hey, you're the devil." That's not how God deals with his children. He doesn't call, he doesn't need to call you the devil. He'd rather spend his time calling you out of that stuff rather than trying to beat you down into a complex. But what the devil does is when the word goes forth and it's being preached, if it hits your address, the devil wants to say, "It's a personal attack." &gt;&gt; Faith says, "I need that, &gt;&gt; Lord. I need that to overcome whatever I'm going through in my life. That's for me. Amen. And I press on. I can't dwell just because well, you know, I might have told this person and then this person might have told that person. So that might have got to the pastor. And because it got to the pastor, now when he preaches, now you're filtering everything through your lens because all this revolves around you. This is what the devil does. You sit in church and he tells you you're the only person this concerns. Everybody else is living right. You're the devil. &gt;&gt; Wow. What a bluff. &gt;&gt; All that for what? So you never recognize &gt;&gt; that the promise that says you can overcome that is yours. &gt;&gt; All that just to keep you down. It says Hebrews 10:38:39, "Now the just shall live by faith, &gt;&gt; but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him." In this first part, the just shall live by faith. To draw back, you could all you could use the word to backslide, to have made a mistake and came back on. See, the devil says, "Because you've made an error, because you drew back, you're now a part of the son of predition." But no, I heard my prophet say, "You backslide every day." We've all heard that. He said, "You backslide every day." But there's something in you that says, "I got to make this right." See, in them, there's nothing in there saying, "I need to make this right." &gt;&gt; Don't identify yourself with things that don't concern you. &gt;&gt; But identify yourself rather on the things that tell you who you actually are according to his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Not what the flesh identifies to, but what the word, the spirit he placed in you identifies to. Why would God call you, predestinate, elect you? Let me just use this terminology. Why would you feel so tormented by the desire to live right? That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; If you were the devil, &gt;&gt; what what is that? See, what is that torment? Oh, man. Every time you make a mistake, oh, I got to make this right. Lord, I'm so sorry, man. I just can't seem to get it right. I just can't seem to get it right. But you are trying to get it right. You are working to try to get it right. And because you fall and you make an error, you now look at yourself in the wrong lens. You start now attributing yourself to depart from me you that work iniquity, for I never knew you. I I love that story. Said, man, he was preaching. He called me a buzzard. He called me an eagle. &gt;&gt; It all depends on how you look at it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it it it's it struck me. He says, "But we are not of them who draw back unto predition." &gt;&gt; Draw back unto all the way to predition. It says, "But of them that believe to the saving of the soul." Predition, this word means ruin, loss, or destruction. It can refer to eternal damnation in hell. or a state of severe ruinous consequences within one's earthly life. Now, why as a son or daughter of God would you ever listen to the devil that would tell you that you belong with such a bunch? When you know his word said, "My sheep hear my voice &gt;&gt; and another they will not follow. Of all that you have given me, I will not lose one." &gt;&gt; You aren't lost. You aren't the devil. You aren't ruined. The God of heaven is still calling at your heart. Why else would he would you keep trying to live right? There's a deep on the inside. I I want to lay a couple of these uh foundations before jumping into the the sermon that inspired me. But it's there's a deep on the inside that's crying out saying this life of up and down is not the life I'm promised to live. There's something on the inside that says I can live a life &gt;&gt; where I'm stable &gt;&gt; and I'm consistent and I've laid aside all weight of this world and I'm focused solely on the things of God. Something in your heart cries out for that. &gt;&gt; There could only be that cry in your heart if God could fill it. &gt;&gt; So if if there's a desire for it, don't fixate on the errors, but fixate on that desire. walk towards that desire that says I can live right, I can be right. Brother Brandham says in faith is our victory. Paragraph 58 10:04 not paragraph uh the year 58 104 [snorts] he talks talking about Abraham here he says paragraph 48 one day while Abraham was praying no doubt he prayed through till he struck the hand of God. How did he do it? By faith. &gt;&gt; Perhaps he thought like this. If there is a God who made the ark and let Noah float through, he still lives today. Somewhere in the land of heathens where he was a sojouring, he touched the hand of God and in there God gave him a revelation that there was a city whose builder and maker was God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If Abraham received such a vision &gt;&gt; of that, how much more you in this hour, what was preached to us by God's prophet, what were you promised? &gt;&gt; It was said of you that you would be a spotless bride. &gt;&gt; It was said of you that you will do the greater works. It was said of you that you will be perfect. &gt;&gt; It was said of you. And and when brother is preaching a series of Hebrews, he says you're going to get to the point you're not living a life that's like this. &gt;&gt; That's your promise. Con you don't want the the uh the the complex that comes with I've been good for this many weeks, I make a mistake. Not going to be good again for a couple more and then I make another mistake. Be good for a couple more and then make another mistake. No, that's not your cycle. &gt;&gt; You're not meant to be in that. You're supposed to be like a boxer. If you get knocked down, get up. Keep going. &gt;&gt; Don't even dwell on it. It ain't over till that bell rings. &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you, when that bell rings, the prophet said, "You are victorious." &gt;&gt; So, you don't have to worry how it finishes. He already told you how it would finish. You would be victorious. Now, if the vision is victory, if the vision is overcoming like Abraham, what must we do? walk towards that vision. There is a land whose builder and maker is God. Man's hands got nothing to do with this land. We know brotherham says that the Holy Ghost is the land &gt;&gt; and you must possess the land. &gt;&gt; He says and we read that all Abraham's life he was a pilgrim and a stranger to the world for this one ambition was to find that city whose builder and maker was God. He struck something. He caught God and a faith in that God that he foresaw the new Jerusalem. And he put his pack on his back and became a wanderer. Not just floating about without any purpose. He had faith. There was a city whose builder and maker was God, an eternal city. He had a purpose in life to find that place. May I say that one day when the battle was over, he met the king of that city and he gave him the communion bread and wine, Melzdc. Oh, you can't purpose, this is so good. Oh, you can't purpose anything of God's promise in your heart without finding the reality to it. &gt;&gt; You can't purpose in your heart. I'm want to be a sold out lock, stock, and barrel believer &gt;&gt; without finding that reality somewhere. You have got to find it &gt;&gt; because God's God is not like man. He cannot lie. It's impossible. So if the desire in you is that, then God has something to feed to quench that desire that you can look and see, hey, I this day, this scripture is fulfilled in my life. &gt;&gt; That's what God desires. He doesn't just make empty promises and hope so promises so that you could just try and try. Man, I made all the efforts to get there and you fall short. He didn't want you to fall short. He didn't call you to fall short, but he called you to go all the way. &gt;&gt; Something our pastor said that struck me so much. He said, "So many people come down to the altar here." He says, "They come recognizing that they're wrong, but they don't want the deliverance. They're comfortable with just the feeling of recognizing I've done something wrong. Oh, I've got such a conviction. When that brother was preaching, my soul, my heart, I just felt so low. I I felt like I was I was terrible. like I I needed God. I needed God. And you go up to the altar, you get prayed for, and you're just satisfied with that. You had the conviction. A believer doesn't say, "Oh, you know, I'm happy I felt convicted." A believer says, "I need to get over this thing. &gt;&gt; I can't stay here. I've got to press through it. I've got to move beyond it. &gt;&gt; I can't be fighting the same thing 10 years down the line. It's one day I've got to get over this thing. &gt;&gt; Now, God has an appointed time for everything. So, if you find yourself fighting the same thing 10 years down the line, don't look at, oh, it's been 10 years. No. Every day you say, this is the day this thing will finish. &gt;&gt; And you walk towards that till you see it fulfilled in your life. &gt;&gt; He says you'll have a purpose in what you're seeking for. He says, "Oh, you can't purpose anything in God's promise in your heart without finding the reality to it." If your soul has been tormented by sins and doubts and ups and downs and frustrations, there's something down in you that's telling you that there's somewhere you can overcome that. Why do you float around in from church to church and from place to place? Brother Brandham's advice is so profound. It's so deep. It's like this the the seals times 10 when he's describing how to get past these things. One of his like algebraic formulas is just kneel down till you strike heaven. That's so complex. Just kneel down till you strike heaven. No. What you want you you want me to you want the min the ministers to come up and say, "Come up here. We'll pray for you and I'll give you this thing. You'll never taste what victory is like on your own. what it means to push through something, to fight through. You think God wants to make you dependent on a man. &gt;&gt; He wants you to be dependent on him. &gt;&gt; If he uses the vessel, praise God, but your faith is not in the man, but it's in God. &gt;&gt; You need to know how to overcome things. You need to know how to fight things. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham would say, &gt;&gt; you could come up for prayer. He said, "Now, sister, you've been misdiagnosed. There's a spirit of doubt on you and that doubt is causing you to not be healed. He said now this is the prophet who when he prayed limbs grew &gt;&gt; dead risen. He so many miracles we saw we heard and saw in his life. &gt;&gt; He said sister I can pray for you now. I can take it away but I can't keep it away. &gt;&gt; You got to do that. What is faith? &gt;&gt; Faith says, "Oh, I got to keep it away. I'mma keep it away. &gt;&gt; It's It's got no more control over me. It's got no more power over me. It's not every single time. I just need that brother to come and pray for me so I can get through this thing." You're being you're being dependent. You're not a child. Grow up. gets a get a backbone in you and says, "I'm tired of this thing." &gt;&gt; Do you think it would have had the same effect in Brother Matthew's testimony if he'd have asked somebody else to take bolt cutters and hit that TV? Do you think it would have had the same effect? &gt;&gt; Oh, please. Oh, big brother David, could you please go and do that for me? It wouldn't have the same effect. Something struck him. &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with this. Oh, you think you're gonna get me? Watch this. And he got it. &gt;&gt; But we think we just have to always always I just need this person to to pray for me. I just need this person to pray for me. I just need this person to pray for me. There is a faith that has been given that if you feel the elders should lay hands on you, they lay hands on you and you shall be healed. The word says that if you come with that expectation, you will receive what you have asked for. But there is also a faith that our prophet spoke of when he speaks to the sister and he says &gt;&gt; you I thought you said you had all faith. I do have all faith. He said, "What are you doing up here? [snorts] If you had all faith, you'd receive it where you were at." &gt;&gt; What was he trying to tell you? He was trying to paid a greater than all of them is here. He said, "I must decrease, so Christ must increase." What were we being told he is here, and if he's here, then anything I have need of? If I know the word says it, faith makes me a possessor of that said promise. Therefore, I can come humbly. I know the word says this, and I can say, "Satan, get thee behind. This is my promise. I'm walking towards this." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Kneel down and strike heaven." And I and I said last night, go beyond the sound barriers and then you'll have a purpose in life. You'll have a purpose in belonging in church. You'll have a per purpose in being baptized. You'll have a purpose in what you're seeking for. Because we know that God is honest and God is true. And God cannot lie. And if God placed that into Abraham's heart by his voice, his word, then God has placed in before us in his Bible, and by the witness of the Holy Spirit, by the returning of the Holy Spirit in signs and wonders that Jesus Christ still lives and is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Then why would we seek any longer for those things that we desire? If you need any need whatsoever that God has promised in his Bible, he's here tonight to meet that need. &gt;&gt; No need seeking farther. His presence is here. His spirit is here. He's willing and ready and longing to give you that what you are seeking for. Why would you wait any longer? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. the condition we sometimes get in where God's trying to bless us with something and give us something. We know that we're struggling with something. We're fighting with something and we're trying to get over that thing. But rather than getting down to business the moment in which you realize this is a problem, you say, "I'm going to wait for the next meeting when we have that when that atmosphere is just right and everybody's just right." Who told you you'd make it to the next meeting? &gt;&gt; All you've got is today. So if something's burning in your heart, I need to get this out of my life today. Don't make a Wednesday service routine. Don't make a Sunday night service routine. God is here. And if he's here, deliverance is here. Now, we know our prophet said, "Where light is, darkness can't be. Where life is, death can't be." So how can we sit here dead when Christ is in our midst? &gt;&gt; Something's got to give and say, "I need life &gt;&gt; and LIFE MORE ABUNDANT. I'VE GOT TO GET PAST THIS THING. &gt;&gt; If we came with that attitude, every single time service the doors were open, oh, what lives would we live when we knew the King of Kings is present here? &gt;&gt; And anything I have need of, he's more than willing and able to perform it. &gt;&gt; But no, but we we come to church. I say we, I'm including myself in it. We come to church. It's just routine. We sit down. The minister is laboring. He's preaching things that are true. He's preaching the word and rather than amening and claiming and saying this is my showdown. I'm not going any longer. I'm dealing with it today. No, it's just a Wednesday night service. I'll wait till Sunday morning. I'll wait till next year. Remember the Tom Ray is here and when he reads that quote again from Christ in the midst of God revealed, &gt;&gt; then I'll get it. No, you need God now. today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says sometimes we got to get out of order &gt;&gt; long enough to be saved. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? If something's crying in your heart right now that says, "I need God." &gt;&gt; Don't wait till they say, "Come up for prayer if you need it." You move with the uncction he puts on your heart. &gt;&gt; We're so routine-based. &gt;&gt; Something's got to be this way. Things got to be that way. No, he gave you a holy uncction. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Move according to the uncction he put in your heart. &gt;&gt; If you've got the faith that says, "Right here where I'm at, Lord, you will find me here." &gt;&gt; See, the devil goes, "But you got work tomorrow. You got to be up at 3:00 a.m. God knows why, but you got to be up at 3:00 a.m. so you can go to work and be there at 5. Man, you can't stay long on a Wednesday. You can't pray through till you get it on the Wednesday because you got something to do tomorrow. Oh, it's Sunday. Well, you know, Sunday morning was good, but I got to eat lunch, man. When is the service going to get over with? I got to eat. Did we laugh? But I've thought of these thoughts. I've sat there preach preaching the word on a Sunday morning. I'm like, what am I going to eat for lunch today? And missing the very opportunity If if the president of the United States was here, what would our attitudes be? You might say, "I don't care for him. I don't care for the president of the United States." Okay, we'll have your favorite pop star then. If he was here or whoever you admire, if they were here that you hold to such a prestige, what would your behavior be then? &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving till I get my autograph. I'm not leaving till he sees me. Remember that little child that said I waved. Did you see him? I saw him, but he ain't seen me. But we come here every Wednesday, every Sunday unimpressed and we go right back home. We This It's business time. &gt;&gt; We're done playing church. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. The cry the cry in my heart. I I I I I I it's almost the Lord strip stripped every part of the humanity in me reading this and seeing how God is breaking this down. You you can't stay the same. &gt;&gt; Something says I I I need a change. &gt;&gt; I need something real in my life. Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, if I know the King of Kings is here, my the you know, I've I've had the the well, I say privilege, sometimes it's an unfortunate privilege to have conversations with with certain uh atheists that just will insult God from A to Z because they just have no care in the world. And they always make this statement. And they say, "Well, if God was here and he appeared, I would believe him." You know, I I I know I would. I hate his guts, but if he appeared, I would believe that he was God. If we're not careful, we start having that same attitude. The at if the atmosphere feels right, if I start tingling in my flesh, then I know God is here. No, he's here because he said he would be here. &gt;&gt; And if he said he would be here, &gt;&gt; what's your attitude now that he's here? &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm just a child. I I there's there's there's no point in me trying to make a move for God. I'm young. Little old me. I'm just a girl or I'm a young man. I don't have any responsibilities yet. So, church isn't really my thing. saying, "I really go cuz my parents forced me to be here." But then something strikes. If you've met him, something strikes and you know when that presence is there. You know when when when when the waters were disturbed in the pool of Bethesda, everybody knew this is the time to get in. &gt;&gt; The waters disturbed. Get in now. But when the very one &gt;&gt; who gave power to that pool, that water was right there &gt;&gt; and just walking &gt;&gt; unrecognized. &gt;&gt; You know, I I don't know if our prophet preached this, but I've always thought of this title, the unrecognized presence of God. &gt;&gt; The unrecognized presence of God. We're no longer impressed. Our behavior tells us that, our attitudes tell us that &gt;&gt; if I'm sorry, but I just got to pour out my heart. If we know Christ is here and we know we came into these doors and what we had on wasn't right, whether it was too tight, whether it was healed, whether it was the wrong hairstyle, whatever the case is, we do believe the King of Kings is here &gt;&gt; and he deserves reverence. in how we behave, how we talk, how we dress, how we act. If that's the case, shouldn't our behaviors align? &gt;&gt; But we we're taking liberties now. &gt;&gt; We're we're having fun. Have fun in church by all means. But the one thing it said about my prophet was he knew how to have good clean fun. It wasn't just fun. It was clean fun. You come to church, you're here to hear from him. You're here to have a conference with him. &gt;&gt; The reality faith says, your word says where two or three are gathered, there in the midst I will be. &gt;&gt; He made that promise. &gt;&gt; Well, if God is here, what mountain in your life &gt;&gt; can't be moved? What's the circumstance? What's the situation? What's the obligation that's more important? But if we said, I don't know why I'm, but if we said, every time you come to church, I'll give you this amount of money. Every single person that would come to church, I'm going to give you this amount every time you come to service. They'd be, man, we we'd have to build a bigger church. We'd need to sit people here, sit people there. People would be standing up everywhere because they knew they were getting a blessing, &gt;&gt; especially because they some of them would be in need of it. &gt;&gt; It's like, "Oh, I'm I'm in need. I'll go I'll go by faith because I know they're going to give it to me." But we know God said, "No man comes to him and returns the same." So we we know we should know and have the belief that if we've got something we're going through and fighting when we come into his house, it's done. &gt;&gt; You just have to have that kind of faith that says it's finished. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter that it's a Wednesday night service. This may be the last service. &gt;&gt; It's finished. &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving here the same. Pray for me. I've been fighting the sickness he's trying to give me, but it's finished tonight. &gt;&gt; He says, [clears throat] "Whatsoever you need, God has promised. His presence is here. His spirit is here and is willing and ready and longing to give you that what you are seeking for. Why would you wait any longer? When you come to him, don't come as a floater. I'll go up and try and see if it works. You'll never get nowhere. But when you come with this kind of determination that you have sold out lock, stock and barrel, when you're tired of the world and sin and unbelief and frustrations and doubts and come to the living God with an anchor surely tightened in the rock of ages, the Holy Spirit is here to pull you into the presence of the living God that will give you faith that will overcome anything there is in the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did he say anything or some things? &gt;&gt; Anything. &gt;&gt; Faith that'll overcome anything there is in the world. Sickness, disease, and even death itself. &gt;&gt; Now, we know a lot of times our prophet says death. He's not just speaking about the natural death. He's speaking about the spiritual one. &gt;&gt; So, if you came in here dead spiritually, you'll walk out with life &gt;&gt; if you believe that he is here. You say, you said death, brother Brandham. And that's what I meant. Death. &gt;&gt; Was it not Lazarus who was laying dead in the ground and already corrupted? Corruption set in when Jesus said to Martha, "Where have you buried him?" And you won't doubt, you shall see the glory of God. And if you won't doubt, oh, hallelujah. And if you won't doubt, you shall see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Got to stop doubting, saints. &gt;&gt; If you want to see the glory of God, don't doubt. There's no reason to doubt. He's never made a promise he hadn't kept. &gt;&gt; He says, "Did not I tell you not to doubt?" He said to Gyrus that night or that day, "If you'll only believe, you can see the glory of God. Then faith overcomes death. Faith is the victory over death. Faith is the victory over sin. Faith is the victory over sickness. Faith is the victory over worry. Faith is the victory over frustrations. Faith is the victory over the world. &gt;&gt; You say, John, when he wrote that, he did not have in my troubles. He did not have to deal with the folk that I deal with. He did not have to go through the things that I do. That's right. Oh, we've all, if you're honest, you've been through that same thought process. That person didn't have to deal what I had to deal with. His situation was a bit easier. Mine's dire. Mine Mine's more troublesome. He may not had to deal with the same folk. He may not had to overcome the same thing, but he never excluded them. &gt;&gt; For he said this, the faith is the victory that overcomes the world, &gt;&gt; the whole thing. &gt;&gt; How is it? Get faith in it &gt;&gt; right above it. When we have the written word of God laying before us, the Holy Spirit here performing and showing the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with the divine promises written here that whatsoever thing you desire when you pray, &gt;&gt; believe you receive it and you shall have it. &gt;&gt; What do you have? What do you have to do then? Have faith. &gt;&gt; Not just floating faith. Not just makebelieve faith, but a real faith. Now faith is a conqueror. Faith is an overcomer. It just isn't a peacemaker. It overcomes. Faith is the victory that overcomes the world. What does it do? What is faith? What is to conquer? Conquer and victory is the same. To conquer, it means to beat down, to override, to handcuff, to throw into prison. It means that sin that once ruled you, you rule it now. It means that you have overcome it. You are, you've whipped it. &gt;&gt; You are greater than it is. &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel religious right now. &gt;&gt; My boy, that feels good. He says you are greater than it is. &gt;&gt; And what is the lie the devil tells you? It's greater than you. It can't be overcome by you. You're weaker than it. It's got power over you. You've tried to overcome it and it hasn't worked. But my prophet said, "You are greater than it is." &gt;&gt; Where are you looking at it from? the standpoint of the flesh trying to live a righteous life &gt;&gt; which is impossible or the the spirit that looks and says this word is my promise and I live after the spirit not after the flesh and I will take this flesh under subjection by the spirit it all depends on the lenses in which you're looking at it from &gt;&gt; this oh this this was so good which was first a sinner or a savior a savior. For a savior is more powerful than a sin. &gt;&gt; Which was first, the healer or a sickness? It couldn't be a a healer less he was over the sickness. &gt;&gt; It is a healer. It can conquer the sickness. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to pause here and interject this. What was first? The fault you made yesterday or your existence? What was first? Your identity or what he tells you just chronologically if we're just simple. What comes first? One or two? &gt;&gt; One. Okay. So, if you were there in the beginning, &gt;&gt; rejoicing with him, then &gt;&gt; how then can the thing now have more power than that which he made then? It can't happen. &gt;&gt; You came before it. &gt;&gt; In fact, it only came to show you more of what it was. &gt;&gt; Without this thing that took place here, you would have never known just how great that victory was. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, "And faith is the victory that overcomes every curse of sin, every curse of the devil." Faith is the victory. Faith is what? Not faith in your church, not faith in your creed, not faith in some man, but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise. That's the victory. What is it? It is the victory. See, my arm is still crippled, but faith is the victory. I still feel sick, but faith is the victory. Oh, it overcomes the world. When you can climb into God by prayer, until you see the thing conquered under you, &gt;&gt; there is nothing that can hurt you. Then &gt;&gt; see, our problem is we're not sitting there till we see it conquered. We're just sitting dwelling on how powerful it is &gt;&gt; when it only has as much power as we give it. We all know our prophet taught us that the devil only does what you allow. &gt;&gt; If you don't open any gates for him, he can't come in. But if you leave a gate open, he enters in. And how he loves to enter in. &gt;&gt; He enters in better than us. He comes every service. He don't miss. &gt;&gt; Because if he can get into your mind during the service and see how the devil works is you'll come into church, the word will go forth. It'll deal with your heart. Something that God placed on the inside says, "I want that." And you start making the moves towards that. You start acting towards that thing. And then you leave the service. You walk outside and that close believing friend of yours says the wrong thing to you. And you completely shuts you down from what you were about to do. You felt an uncction to make a move for God. See, it's not it's not that your believing friend is the devil. No. But sometimes we say things that aren't really the the right reflection of who we are. When he told Peter, "Depart from me, Satan." Was he speaking to him or what he said? It's the words that came out of him. Depart from me, Satan. He wasn't calling Peter Satan. It was those words. We have to break past even the friendships we have and realize this is business. If I have to be with God alone and just me and him and all my friends go away from me and they don't want to hang out with me, they don't want to be friends with me anymore because I'm solely focused on the things of God. So be it. &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, I'm going to get a hold of him. &gt;&gt; I lost many of friends &gt;&gt; being behind here, &gt;&gt; living for this message. mainly I I remember the first time I preached my closest closest friends said oh because Ben's preaching now we can't talk to him anymore we can't associate with him anymore because now he's serving as if this made me any greater than them in fact in God's economy I'm lower I'm serving you there is no bone in me that wants to have power over you not a single I don't have power over myself. But I you you start to see what the devil does. He makes you think because you want to live lock, stop, and bear for the things of God that everybody's going to leave fall leave you away. No one's going to talk to you. You're going to be alone. You're going to have nobody. That's not the case. &gt;&gt; You've got him. &gt;&gt; If I got Jesus, I got it all. &gt;&gt; If he blesses me with friends, praise God. But if he don't, all I got is him. That's all I need. &gt;&gt; It's an easier life when all you got is you and him. When there's nothing in between that channel and it's just you and God, not this friend saying that, this person saying that, no, God, you speak, I say, "Amen. I live it." &gt;&gt; But when you start adding a bunch of people into the mix, you having different channels. You want to do this thing for God. This person says, "Well, you don't have to do it that way. You can do it." No. Listen to the uncction in your heart. He put it there for a reason. &gt;&gt; What's okay to them may not be okay for you. &gt;&gt; You may be given a greater measure of faith because of your obedience. &gt;&gt; Time is getting away from me. There's too much in here. Um he says [snorts] when you can climb into God's into God by prayer until you see the thing conquered under you there is nothing that can hurt you then you've overcome. You've got 50 miles of elbow room. &gt;&gt; You're sailing free then. You who have been a drunkard and a slave to whiskey, you will be master over him. Then that old devil of alcohol that made you drink. Notice how he said that it wasn't you, which the devil wants to make you think it's you. He says that old devil of alcohol that made you drink. You could put that old devil of gossip that made you gossip. You could put that old devil of whatever whatever you're fighting with that old devil that made you do that. He says made you drink. He's your master now. But when you get faith, &gt;&gt; I don't mean makebelief, &gt;&gt; real faith. &gt;&gt; He's your servant then. &gt;&gt; You can't lay down tobacco. You women and men, when it comes to a place to where you can get to that spot to where you have by faith, you'll master it then. Brother brother Ram then gets into a story. He's talking about a sister. He says, I don't want to uh read all of that, but he he's describing a a Baptist sister who was going through a circumstance and he says and brother in paragraph 75 and brother Robertson is back there and Mr. wood there. Wood sitting there somewhere and I and where I go down hunting I believe somewhere in the truck and the Holy Spirit seemed to move us to go away up through the knobs to where she was and when I got there she had a dream and when the Holy Spirit came into the room she got down to real business. She never smoked a cigarette from then on and she has gained many pounds of weight and they can't find a trace of the cancer. Now I want to draw your attention to this. But Abraham says what is it? It's faith that overcomes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Why didn't it overcome what I was praying for her here?" She was just fluttering around. But when the doctor says, "You got cancer and going to die," she got to business. &gt;&gt; That's the way it has to get. When you get to business, why wait so long? &gt;&gt; Why not get down to business now? &gt;&gt; Put your faith in God. &gt;&gt; What if the woman had her faith in me? It have failed. &gt;&gt; What if the woman had her faith in me? It have failed &gt;&gt; cuz I'm a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when she changed her faith, not in the Brandham Tabernacle or William Brandham or in anyone else, but placed her faith in Jesus Christ, then she got faith. She raised up above all the fears and doubts and got and God healed her and she overcame. Faith is the victory that overcomes. Man, I love that so much. He says, "Why did she wait? Then brother Brandham starts talking here and he's mentioning how we put our faith when a doctor gives his diagnosis. A doctor says you've got this sickness. You say, "Well, I do." He prescribes you a bunch of pills. You take the pills. You don't even know what's in the pills. But you take the pills. You just don't question. But then little old God says, "You have this problem. This is the prescription we want to wrestle and [snorts] fight. We listen to the doctor because he's a professional. He's an expert at diagnosing diseases and prescribing medicine or treatments. But God, the creator of heaven and earth, the creator of all things, who knows you in and out. In fact, he said, "I knew you when you were in your mother's womb. I formed you." That God gives a prescription for your life of what you need, of what I need. And our attitude is, "Well, maybe I'll take it another time. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll take it later. It's not dire. I don't need to take it right now." Are we waiting for the doctor to diagnose you with something that's life and death? &gt;&gt; It's life and death every day. You got breath. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if you're actually dying. &gt;&gt; Everybody has an appointed time &gt;&gt; where you die. &gt;&gt; So each day that goes by, you're only getting closer to that appointed time. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be better if our attitude was today &gt;&gt; because I'm not promised tomorrow. Today &gt;&gt; I'm going to mean business today &gt;&gt; because Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; He says brother Bam's talking about Christians when they come up to him and they're and they're flustered in the interviews and how he's talking with them. is trying to contact their spirit and see what's going on. He says he tends to find out that they're just floating. That's why they're struggling. They haven't made ambitions on the on Jesus Christ. They're floating about everything else. When I'm going to get the new job, the new car, the new this. Rather than fixing their eyes on Christ, they fixed their eyes on everything else. And brother Brandham, he tells him, he says, "What are you drifting for? Get some ambition about you. Set your goal on Christ and quit tallying with the world. &gt;&gt; You'll pick up a magazine. It'll say, "Now the divine healers of this day, there is no such divine hero that'll put a doubt in your mind." Someday get on the radio and say, "Oh, preach a pretty good sermon, but say the days of miracles is passed and you'll support it." See, that weakens you. Notice this. Sell out. Get right with God. &gt;&gt; Either be what you are or don't be at all. God's Bible doesn't teach it, then get away from it. &gt;&gt; If it does teach it, stay with it. &gt;&gt; It reminds me, for instance, if we're ever going to take a little trip, I'm trying to find something. He says in paragraph 82, "And when you just frustrate yourself by joining one church and then the other, you'll accumulate more junk. But if you'll think of where you're going, you'll get rid of a lot of that doubt and nonsense. You'll have real faith." I say to people, "Are you brother Brandon that prays for the sick?" Yeah. Well, that's against my faith. Then you haven't got any faith. The Bible teaches it. And now many people come into the line and they say, "Well, I got all faith." Then what are you doing up here? Uh, it isn't. So real faith knows no defeat. It cannot be defeated. Even death itself can't defeat it. It knows no defeat. Trials know defeat. But faith knows no defeat. It cannot be defeated. And it is the only way that you can please God. For without faith, it is impossible to please God. Finding a place to close here. He says, "Many of you have faith in your doctors." And you should have if you got a doctor. Now, when something gets wrong with you, you'll get to the old faithful doctor that you believe in. That's what you should do. That's good. And then you submit your case to him. If he says you should go to the hospital, you don't do a thing but go home and pack up your clothes and take off to the hospital. Notice how we just don't question anything. Sure, you got faith in the doctor. And if he doesn't decide that you want to go to the hospital, or you should go rather, he'll write out a prescription and give you a sack full of pills and you'll swallow them and you don't know what's in those pills. But you got faith in your doctor. How about God? and you are scared to swallow some of the gospels that he gives you. &gt;&gt; By his stripes, you were healed. Faith is the victory that overcomes the world. Swallow it and see what happens. It's a confidence. You show that what confidence you have in your doctor by taking his medicine that you don't know what it is. You show your confidence in the doctor by submitting yourself to an operation. That proves your confidence to the doctor. But when it comes to Christ, you're scared to take him at his word. How is it? Faith is the victory. You could submit your case to Jesus Christ tonight, just as you submit your case to the doctor. Give me anything you want, Lord. You're the doctor on the case. Then you've got the victory. Then you got faith that overcomes. You'll never hunt another prayer line. You'll never hunt nothing else. You'll have it right there. It'll be settled. You'll never jump from church to church. See if this one has got it or that one has got it. They haven't got it. You've got it. Then &gt;&gt; when you've got the faith, you have the victory. &gt;&gt; I tell you what we need tonight in America and what we need tonight here in this tabernacle is to let Dr. Jesus come in and perform an operation on our faith. &gt;&gt; The doctor tells you, "You got a little appendix. It's all poison. It ought to come out. You got this or the other. It's wrong. It's got to come out. Well, he takes it out so the rest of you function right. What's the matter with our faith? We're afraid to let God take his operating word, his knife, sharper than two-edged sword, and operate on us and tell us that our little fang dangled humugging around is wrong. And we got to turn loose every shutter, and sail towards God's eternal promise. Oh, if we'll do that, Jesus will perform an operation upon our faith, taking away all the doubt, all the fears, all the worry, all the sin, everything there is. And when when and then when our faith is clearly operated on, we come out a new creature. We're different then. We need an operation. Can you trust Jesus Christ for the operation? Can you believe in him? Can you say, "Lord, at thy word, at thy word, the musicians could come. He says, paragraph 97, you may have tried to get rid of that illtemper, that slandering tongue, tongue, not gossip on the telephone. You might have tried every remedy you know how, but if you'll just let Jesus Christ come into you tonight, he'll operate on your faith and give you a faith that will climb beyond anything that the world can produce. Why? Faith is the victory that overcomes the world. How could you doubt when Jesus the son of the living God is present now his great Holy Spirit in this building the word promised that lo I am with you always even to the end of the world it was promised by the Lord God has to keep his word do you believe that when he promised he promised he would do these things God is solemnly obligated to do such &gt;&gt; oh Uh, and if you get the chance when you get home, I would really read from paragraph 99 on down to 119 as he's praying for people. And he's talking about the condition that they're in, man. That that'll do something to you when he starts breaking in and looking at people and he's saying, "Look at your life." the question he asked him. Now I want you to think it over. If you have [music] sin, if there's anything wrong in your life, I want you to think it over while we bow our heads just a moment for prayer. And he asked the question, I'd like to ask if there was a man, woman, boy, or girl that's in the building that would say by an uplifted hand, "Lord, I just seemingly can't overcome. [music] It seems like I know that I shouldn't do these things. I know I shouldn't do this and [music] that, but I want you to operate on my faith right now after this message. I want you to give me a complete [music] checking over and operate on every little disease of my faith that would keep me from overcoming these things. Hold up your hand to him. Will you [music] do it? The Lord bless you. Place just full of hands. and he just starts when brother Benham gets into those times and now he starts discerning what's going on in the audience and he's describing that when God points this sister [music] out and he's talking about what she's going through and it's true and he doesn't know her and she believes this sister over there gets a hold of faith [music] and she gets something. In fact, in this sermon, brother said he gets more reports from people that are sitting in the audience of what God has done than those that came into their prayer line. He says that in the sermon, [music] you go and find it. Why? Because they get a hold of faith. It's not where you're at, whether you're there or here. It's get a hold of faith. Get a hold of him. If you can get a hold of him, you'll have a report. &gt;&gt; If we'll [music] just stand. Um I'd like to sing healing is here. Oh, Jesus is here. [music] Here. Jesus [singing] is here. Yes, he is. Oh, [music and singing] and Jesus sit here and I receive [music] it. Oh, and Jesus is here. [music] Jesus [music] is here. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, and Jesus is here. Here and I [singing] believe. [music] I reach my hands. I reach my hands [music] to the heart. I lift [music and singing] my eyes where my help comes from. Oh, I look to you. You are my rock, [music] my healer. I trust in you. Oh, [music] I [singing] reach my hand. I reach my [music] hand to the heaven. I lift my eyes [music] where my help comes from. Oh, I look [music] to you. You are my [singing] rock, my he. Oh, I trust in you. Sickness can't stay [music] any longer. Oh, and [music] sickness can't stay any longer. Oh, [music] your perfect love is casting down. Oh, and [music] you are the God of your power. You got to believe it. [music] And it is your will that my life is. Oh, [singing and music] sickness can't stay any longer. Oh, and your perfect [music and singing] love is casting down. Oh, and you [music] are the [singing] God of all power. Oh, and it is your will [music] that my life is here. And so [music and singing] I reach my hand to [music] the heaven. I lift my [singing] eyes where my hand comes from. [music] Oh, I look to you. You are [music] my rock of [singing] my healing. I trust in [music] you. &gt;&gt; Just your voice is lifted up to him. Oh, [singing] and so I reach my hands [music] to the [singing] heavens. I lift my eyes [music] where my help [singing] comes from. Oh, when I look to you, &gt;&gt; you are my rock, [singing and music] my healer. I trust in [music] you. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, all we've got is trust in you, Lord Jesus. Father, we need you, Lord. Father, it's time, Lord Jesus. For our entire beings, Lord, all that we are, Father, we've held on to too much, Lord Jesus. It's time to [music] surrender it all, Father. Give it to you, Lord. Purpose in our hearts, Father. We're tired of the routine, Lord [music] Jesus, that we've made it, Father. You still show up every service waiting, looking for that one that you could touch. Father, light a fire in our hearts that every time we come to service, we can say, "Jesus is here. I receive it and I [music] believe it." and whatever problems we're dealing with can't stay any longer. Lord, that's what's needed in [music] this hour. Father, if we could but have that kind of faith, Lord, like our prophet said, we wouldn't have needed nothing else. We would have it, Lord Jesus. Father, I leave the [music] people in your hands. I pray something was said to somebody. Father, if it was just me that was dealt with, Father, [music] I needed it, Lord Jesus. I needed it, Father. My way [music] only leads to more problems, Lord. Your way is greater, Jesus. We love you, Father. You see your people. You see their hearts. [music] If [snorts] there's a soul crying out saying, "I got sickness in my faith. I've let things come in that have tampered [music] with the faith and I need healing that I can have more faith. [snorts] That I can get up out of my condition and I can walk. Father, that's the kind of faith we need. The faith that moves us to action. Father, not an idol faith. one that works, Lord Jesus, as we heard a God with skin on them, Lord, that we can say, "I've seen the [music] tangible." God, [snorts] I've witnessed it. I know what it's like. Father, raise our faith. Father, it is a reality in this hour. [music] Father, for the faith that was delivered to us in this hour is to make a rapture, Lord Jesus. Father, we need a lot more faith. If we can't believe in simple healings and simple things in our lives, [music] how could we have the faith for rapture, Father? But Lord, I'm thankful. Faith is a gift you give, Lord Jesus. If we could just surrender our hearts [music] and say, I want that faith. [snorts] I want that faith that looks in the face of a problem and say, "Get behind me, [music] Satan." I want that faith that looks at the face of cancer and says, [music] "It is finished." [snorts] I want that faith, Lord Jesus, that changes things. Lord, I leave your people in your hands in Jesus [music] name. Amen. Let's just sing that as we invite brother Matthew to come. I reach my hands to [music and singing] the heavens. I lift my life. Oh, [singing] I rock my heel. I trust in you. Sickness can't stay as [music and singing] sickness can't stay any longer. Perfect love is casting [music] out fear. &gt;&gt; You are the God [singing] of all power. And [music] it is [singing] your will and my life is sickness can't stay [music] any longer. Your perfect blood is casting our feet. Oh, you are [music] the God of all power. It is true and my life is. So I reach my hands [music] to the I lift my eyes [music and singing] where my help comes from to you. [music] I walk by. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the word that we heard. Faith is a reality. You know, as he ministered, I thought, you know, faith is a reality. [music] What what's the opposite of faith? It's unbelief. And it's unfortunate, but a lot of people's reality is just the world that they see around them, you know, their [music] their job, their career, what they see on the news and the internet. And that's just their reality. It's their [music] their life. It's it's their joy is like the stock market. It's just up, it's down, it's up, it's down. But we know faith is a revelation. And so when when it's revealed to you, then we're living by that sixth sense. And I I just thought something struck me I just thought I'd share because it meant a lot to me. [music] Um but you know when brother Brandham said he he said you know faith beats down faith handcuffs faith casted into prison. [music] You know it's you're either going to be you're either going to be handcuffed or you can handcuff it. And and I thought when he said he said [music] you master it then it serves you. What how how is country music gonna serve me? How how is drugs and how is addictions how are those things going to ser serve me? Think think of the woman at the well [music] here she has been married four times the the or the the woman the man she's with ain't even five times. The man she's with not even uh her husband and she's in a li her life is a shamble. She's in bondage. But yet, when she comes into the presence of the Lord Jesus side, Lord Jesus Christ, and that seed's quickened, what does it do? It takes her past &gt;&gt; and now it serves her [music] &gt;&gt; because now she's able to run into the city and say, "Come see a man &gt;&gt; who told me all the things that I done." And it struck me while while the word was going forth. I I here was in in um in North Carolina and we were sitting around the brothers fellowshipping out shopping and and this man came up and he went the wrong way and we were sitting in this little gazebo and he come up and and &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh he he just realized he kind of came to a dead end and looked at us. I said, "Come on in." He said, "Well, where's the drinks at?" [music] I said, "Well, I I uh you know, I got a little coffee here. That's about all I got. But the the kind of drinks you're looking for, I said, "God delivered me of that 25 years ago." And [music] it went from just that statement to him coming in and sitting sitting in and then we had the opportunity to introduce him to the message of the hour and invite him to church. And and [music] isn't it wonderful when God can take your past &gt;&gt; and it becomes a testimony? So the very things that that that that God has delivered you from or you've struggled with, God is able to take that and it actually serve you. And if you find yourself struggling with music, I I I say as as how brother Ben ended the service, let's let God do an operation on [music] our faith. If there's things that you're struggling with in your life, Jesus Christ is here and he can perform an operation to take that struggle where you're where you're no longer serving it or battling it, but it serves you and you finish it once and for all and say, "You know what? I I've been struggling. I haven't had total victory over this, but you know what, God? Would you come and and perform an operation in my life, and I want to take this struggle and I want it to serve me now? I want to handcuff it. I want to throw it into prison. Therefore, I can go and testify. God, YOU'VE BEEN GOOD TO ME. GOD, YOU'VE HEALED ME. You delivered for me this. I struggled with with this for years, but now we can go tell our family and we can testify. [music] And and I want to sing that song. And as uh before we're dismissed, I was made for more. And I don't know, Brianna, you probably you think you could help me sing it? Why don't you come help me sing it? I I want to I know our voice has been struggling, but I I [clears throat] just say as um we sing this, why don't you just maybe personally just uh why don't you invite God to come maybe do an operation &gt;&gt; on your faith? I believe that's a challenge to every one of us here that we can live higher &gt;&gt; there. There's faith is the victory that overcomes the world. Faith beats down. It conquers. And we ought to be the most victorious people on the face of this earth. And I I just not to get too carried away, but but [music] what is I believe it's Romans 4:19. It says, "Abraham not being weak in faith, [music] he staggered not." So if you're weak in faith, you stagger. But if you're strong in faith, you give praise to God, KNOWING HE'S MORE THAN able to perform that which he's promised. And I I say, "Lord, as [music] we finish out the ser God, do an operation on my faith." I like how brother Ben brought it down and he said, "Tonight, &gt;&gt; don't wait for Sunday. Don't wait for Thursday. Don't wait for another." TONIGHT, LORD, COME DO AN operation on me, Lord. I want to go in a rapture. I want to go in a body church. I want to be more victorious. I want to have perfect faith tonight, Lord. It's my night. IT'S MY TIME. I WAS MADE FOR MORE. I WAS MADE TO be an overcomer. I was made to be a conqueror, Lord. I WASN'T MADE TO BE UP AND DOWN AND IN AND OUT. LORD, I WAS MADE THAT FAITH WOULD BE A REALITY. Not the STOCK MARKET, NOT MY JOB, NOT MY PAYCHECK. That's not my reality. My reality is this living word, the revealed word of the hour. That the the reality IS WHAT MY REALITY IS WHAT GOD SAID. MY REALITY is that I am an overcomer. I can do the greater works. [music] Why don't we just sing that? Help help us sing this. I know who I am cuz I know who you are. [singing] The cross of salvation [singing] was only the [music] start. Now I am chosen. [music] I'm free and forgiven. [singing] I have a [music] future and it's [music] worth the living. [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, cuz I wasn't made [music] to be tended in a grave. [singing] I was called by name. Born and raised back [music] to [singing] life again. I was made for more. [music] And [singing] so why would I lay a bed in [music] my shame when a fountain of grace is running in my [singing and music] way? I know I am yours and I [singing and music] was made for more. I know who [music and singing] I am. Oh Lord, do an operation tonight. &gt;&gt; I know who you [singing] are. &gt;&gt; The [music] cross of salvation [singing] was only the start. [music] Now I am chosen, [music and singing] free and I [music] have a future and it's [singing] worth the [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Why don't you worship the Lord? [singing] I wasn't made to be tended and grave. I was called by name. born and raised [music] back to life [singing] again. I was raised [music] for more. And so why would I [music] make a bed in my shame [singing] when a fountain of grace is running in my way? [music] I know I am yours and I was made more. [music] You call out [singing] my name [music] and I'll sing out your praise. Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; You bring my passes and I'm not [music] going back. Hallelujah. [music and singing] You call out my name. So I'll sing out your praise. Hallelu. [music] [singing] You buried my past and I'm not going back. Oh, cuz I [singing] wasn't made to be [music] tended in a grave. I was called [singing] by name, born [music] and raised back to [singing] life again. I was [music] made for more. And so why [music] would I make a bed in [singing] my shame when a fountain of grace is running in my way? I know I am [singing and music] yours. I was made for one more time. Hallelujah. [singing] You call [music] out my name, so I'll sing out your praise. [singing] [music] [singing] You buried my passing. I'm not going back. [music] Hallelujah. [singing] You called out my name. So [music and singing] I'll sing out your praise. Thank you, Lord. [singing] You buried [music] my passion. I'm not going back cuz [singing] I wasn't [music] made to be tended a grave. [singing] I was called by name. born [music] and raised back to life again. I was made [music and singing] from war. So [music] why would I lay [singing] in my shame when I found your love is running in my [music and singing] way? I know I am yours and I was made for all. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just praise the Lord? Why don't you just thank God for the message of the hour? Thank God for his word. Brother Matt Thomasac, if you'd come and we'll dismiss in [music] prayer, remember those that aren't with us this evening. Just look upon the needs in the body. Amen. As brother [music] Matt just closes out the service, just invite him to come perform that operation in you and make this word a living reality. [music] Amen. God bless you. Heavenly Father, Lord, we were made for more because you made us. &gt;&gt; Yes. You're our maker, our Lord, and our God. Lord, I just [music] pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you'd strengthen your people, Lord, to lay aside every weight that and every sin that so easily besets us, Lord God. We are so needy and so frail, Lord. Lord, this world's [music] going one way and trying to drag us down with it, but we're made for more. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And when the enemy comes in like a flood, Lord, you raise up the standard against it, Lord. And when you raise it up, we're magnetized [music] to you, we'll raise with it, Lord. Help us to shake off the things of the [music] world and press on. Lord, like brother Ben said, Lord, if we get hit, if we get knocked down, [music] quickly pop back up because we're predestinated [music] to win this fight. Lord, we claim every loved one. &gt;&gt; Yes. [music] &gt;&gt; Present or not present, Lord. &gt;&gt; For your honor and your glory. &gt;&gt; You said you wouldn't lose a one. &gt;&gt; Yes. We speak in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that they would come into the fold. Lord God, it's time to go home and we want to leave here. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not going to dwell in the past, but we're going to press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ. the calling that [music] you've called us to walk in. We love you, Lord, and thank you for your goodness and your mercy and your grace. Be with my brothers and sisters, [music] each one of us, Lord, as we leave here, Lord. May we purpose in our heart to come up a little higher. We love you. We thank you for your word. What a blessing it's been this week, Lord. This is Truly, it [music] was good to be in the house of the Lord. We love you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. There's just a a wonderful presence here. We'll dismiss [music] you. Those that want to continue to worship, we'll just worship the Lord. Amen. Let's try to sing. Stay. Stay.
