Description:
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
The Path Forward: Faith For The Journey
April 2nd, 2025
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[Music] Let's just approach him together. Heavenly Father, Lord, we do come before you with grateful hearts, Lord. And we want to tell you thank you, Father, for your blessings, for the good reports, Lord. And Lord, if not for your grace and your love that's in our lives, Father, we would be so lost without you, Lord. And we just want to come before you with thanksgiving, Father. And Lord, that it would create a boldness in our hearts to know that truly you're for us, Father, and you desire good things. And Lord, you know what's on the heart of each person that's been gathered together here. And Lord, you're mindful and you care. And Father, we ask that our faith would rise up to believe that that's right. You have a provision for us and that your word is for us and that we would accept it. And Father, to put that upon our lips and to speak it and give you the glory, Father, that you desire and Lord, we commit the needs to you, our brother Darien. Father, that you would grant them favor, Lord, in the interview. And Lord, you're a provider. And yes, Lord, we're just trusting in you. And Lord, there's I know a hunger in each of our hearts, Father. And you've told us that blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. Lord, may your glory just touch each one, Father. We commit it all to you and ask that you'd be glorified. And Lord, just thinking of the camp. Lord, you knew there was a time as a young man, Lord, and to thank my brothers to go to minister at the camp, Father. Yes, Lord. Lord, just may your grace start to prepare a way, Lord. This was a heart of rebellion. Lord, I didn't want to go to that camp, Lord. But it was better that you would start a work, Lord. Lord, you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Father, Lord, may you just be merciful to each young person's heart. And may you make a way, Father. We just commit it to you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You are the [Music] healer, healer of my heart. [Music] Oh, and maker and the God of all we [Music] are. I was a broken vessel in your name. You [Music] are here. [Music] [Music] You my surrender.

Oh my [Music] go is in the Lord forever. Amen. Let us pray. Father, where else can we put our hope? You alone are the creator of heaven and earth. You alone know the beginning from the end. Father, you alone created the plan and order the footsteps of the righteous. Father, to whom else could we go? For you alone have the words of eternal life. We just ask you to bless us tonight, Father. And as the world seems to hold less and less thoughts of you, the world seems to have less and less desire to acknowledge you. The church world is serving social issues and but yet, Father, we believe there's a people that want your will and your way. Let us be among those that are numbered, Father, that want to feast on your word. ask you to touch each heart tonight and bless each person. May they just rejoice in the good things of God and and just leave this place with their heart lifted up more confident in their election, Father, more determined to walk the straight and narrow. We ask it in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you tonight. Nice to be in the house of the Lord and to fellowship around God's word. If we have our Bibles, let's just open up. Uh I'm going to try not to be long and uh so what I'm so you can just sit there anticipating the end of the sermon. You know, when's this going to end? When is this going to end? You know what I mean? and uh and maybe it'll it'll uh be a blessing. Uh so I'd like to just read uh uh let's just read from uh the gospel of James and we just want to read the 27th verse and uh then a few verses in the second chapter in James 1 and 27. 7 says this pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world. My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons? For if there cometh unto your assembly a man with gold ring and godly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile reignment, and ye have respect to him that is that that weth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sitest th out here in a good place, and say to the poor, Stand out there or sit here under my foottool and ye are then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts. Hearken, my brethren, my beloved brethren, have not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith and hes of the kingdom which he had promised them that love him. But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seat. Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by whom ye are called? If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scriptures, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Do ye well. But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin and are convinced of the law as a transgressor. And whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point is guilty of all. Amen. Our gracious father, we ask you to bless your word to us this evening. In Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. and God bless you tonight. You may be seated. We certainly uh trust that the Lord is blessing you and and you enjoy to be in the house of the Lord tonight. And uh we just have a little thought uh on our heart just uh maybe you know just kind of a evangelistic and and just some uh Christian principles. And if we had a title, uh, we'd like to call it, uh, the path forward, faith for the journey. And we've been talking about the path forward. And and the reason for that is is that it it's on my heart. Uh, several messages that our our messenger preached to it. One of them that he ministered to us was going beyond the camp. and and we can never forget that we are on a journey. We're pilgrims and we're strangers or we're seeking a city to come. So we're we're always hungering and thirsting after righteousness. We're we're always desiring in our heart to have more of God and to go uh further with God. In fact, th the whole purpose of of us being here tonight is to draw closer to God. That that this the scripture says, "If you draw nigh unto me, then I'll draw nigh unto you." And and so we see that that God is looking at us and just your effort to be here tonight pleases the Lord because he sees that you're here because you want to draw closer to him. And I think that's what we want to do. We want to draw closer to him. We want to know, are we on the path? Are we going forward? And I think that means a lot. I look at myself sometimes and I look back over and I say, "Well, I haven't gone as far as I want to." You know what I mean? And and what do we call it when you shrink back? when when you were you kind of were kind of in a good place at one time and then things sent you topsyturvy and all of a sudden you seemed like you've fallen back and and we say, "Oh, I've backslid or I've went backwards." You know what I mean? And and but it doesn't matter. You just get back up and you keep going forward. And so what what we don't want to do is we we don't want to set up a camp. And and what I mean by that is we finally get what we believe and we finally get what we teach and we finally get our dress code down and we finally get our church order down and we finally get everything set in a place and everybody's got their spot and their position and everything's kind of in order and and we know what we believe and so we're just going to sit back. You know what I mean? and and let everything just happen around us. And that's a condition that we don't want to get into. We all we want to be constantly listening to his voice. We we're we're ready for service. You know, we're we're here, Lord, what would Lord have me to do? Uh you know, we're we're seeking a a path forward. We're seeking more of him. We're seeking uh uh to draw closer to him. And we got to believe that there's more of him for us to know. Now, wouldn't it be sad if I walked up those steps and I came here and said, you know, I know all about God that there is to know. I'd just pack my bag. I just get up and say, "If here you that's where you're at and you know all there is about God to know adios." Well, you know, some people have that idea towards the word. You know, they've studied the Bible. They know the Bible. They know everything that's in the Bible. They know what Peter taught. They know what James taught. They know what uh Corinthians taught. They know the scriptures. They know all the verses. and and they know everything that there there is to know. You know, I I I've seen men that you start a scripture and they'll finish it. In fact, I'll be honest with you. I was in a service one time with brother Roy Borders and I was sitting there and brother Roy was preaching at the church and brother Roy started a a scripture and the man in the audience quoted it before he finished. Now Royy's been in a lot of meetings, brother Roy. So he he thought he'd put the guy to the test. So I watched him just take his Bible over and just flip it over here and he'd start reading someplace else and the guy finish it and then he'd flip back over here. So you know the one that really gets in the book of Revelations. Oh, he just fixed over Revelations and and the guy finished it. The guy knew the book. Now, why he knew the book is because I think he spent a lot of years in a little square room studying the book and he memorized the book and and so uh we took the man to the to the bus depot and and me and uh brother uh Ray Robson, we took uh the brother to the to the bus depot to get him a ticket. And we come to find out that he took his uh he had a ticket to Flag and then he changed bus and Flag and went down to Phoenix and he he took his ticket and he uh he hawkked it and sold it to somebody and then got a little bit of spirits to uh hold him through, you know. So he he wasn't in the best spiritual condition, but yet he could quote every scripture. And so finally Rey was so curious. He said, "Uh, where where are you coming from?" He said, "I'm coming from Wyomi." He says, 'Well, what were you doing up there? He says, "I was in an insane institution." And we said, "Well, what what were you doing in the insane institution?" He says, "Well, they put me in there for trying to commit suicide." And he said, "I don't know why they did that. I only tried it once. And that always stuck with me. Not not the humor of the story, but how could that he he he he knew the scripture and yet the letter killth and it's the spirit that good gives life. So you could you could set up camp. You know what I mean? You could get what what we believe. And we have we have the things we believe about water baptism. We have the things we believe about the Godhead. We have the things that we believe about the opening of the seals and the church age. And those are wonderful things to fellowship around that they they uh they throw your soul. I I love listening to it. Brother Ben's been working with me the last couple days and and he would put on brother Brandham's tape. He's listening to Brother Bram's tape and and you know I I'm just attracted to that voice. So I start following him around, you know, because I want to keep hearing what Brother Bram's saying. Finally, I said, "Ben, will you stay still so I can hear what he's saying?" See, we want to be moving. We want to be moving forward spiritually. We there's a path before us to go forward and and what is it that we we want to go we want to go uh forward in? What what is it that we want to uh we want to experience? We know we want to make the rapture, right? That's our that's that's a goal of our path. But there there's a journey to get there. You know, it's people don't even a seed. We understand that when a seed is planted, there's a journey for that seed. There's a path that that seed's got to take. Every seed's got a path that was predestinated within it. You know, a a a tree grows different than a corn stock and and a wheat stock. And it's got a path it goes. It's got certain ground that it it germinates in. It's got certain weather conditions that cause it to be pollinated. It It's got to find its path. It's got to find its journey in order for it to produce the fruit. And we want to be fruitful because the tree that's unfruitful is heed down and cast into the fire. The fig tree that didn't produce fruit. It was cursed in a type show showing us and the scripture tells us be neither unfruitful or barren. Well, we have to understand there's a path towards that. There there there's things that that you do for the journey in order to receive it. We just don't sit there and hope for it. We lay for ourselves a pattern of good works. We pray with without ceasing, seeking the face of the Lord. We believe with all our hearts. We believe that there's more of God. And and I I guess that we would sum it up in this journey that we don't want to walk this journey on our own. We want to walk it with him. We want him to be with us, him to be beside us because he promised it. I'll be with you even in you till the end. Well, we want to have that experience. We want to be blessed like that. We want to be more like him. And so, uh, I think that our final desire is that we want to be partakers of his nature. And we know his a his nature is summed up and manifested in his attributes. You know, we we know that he's merciful and we know that he's kind. We know he's our provider. We know that he's our counselor, our prince of peace, our our mighty God. And we just don't want to sit there and and he praises on them and say, "He's a mighty God. He's the creator of heaven and earth. But but we want to participate. Lord, counsel me. Lord, supply my need. Lord, uh you have wisdom and and you you're gentle and you're longsuffering. And we want to enter into the fellowship where the attributes that he possesses, we're in fellowship with those attributes and partakers of those attributes. I want to experience his attributes. Now, I know what it's like to have him show mercy. I know he's a healer. And I and I I I rejoice in the times that that that I felt his healing hand. I I just don't want to sit back and say he's this and he's that and and he and worship praise, but I want to participate in what I'm praising him for. Just like the word of God. I just don't want to read it because it's the word of God. I want revelation of it. I want it to speak back to me. I want to see what it says. And all you Bible readers, you know, when you started out, you marked certain scriptures and then you went on and you got a different color pen and a different color pen and and then you read something and you say, "I've read that chapter a hundred times and it means something different to me today." Why? because it's living word. You don't want to kill it. You don't want to kill it with creeds. You don't want to kill it with your ideas. You don't ever want to kill it thinking you already know what it means. Because I believe that the word of God never changes. But you change. And as you change, that word ministers to your change. And we should be changing. That's the idea about the journey. It's a journey of change. It It's a journey of transforming. As our messenger said, he said in uh I believe it was who who is this Malchisedc? He said it was a metamorphe. It was a the transl transforming going forward like the caterpillar and the stages of it. And he talks about the stages of the weed. He talks about the stages. We talk about the seven church age stages. What is it? It's a journey. It's a change. It's a path. We're going forward. So, first of all, we got to know that we're trying to go forward. We're not trying to stop. We're not trying to see who can we get in agreement with us. That was the problem that the children of Israel had. God told them, "Don't stop. Don't talk to those people. Don't mix with those people. If you use any of their water, if you use any of their land, pay them for it, but keep going. Keep moving and and you know, don't don't let anything discourage you. And so we're talking about a faith for the journey because we're gonna have to have a special kind of faith because after all we know one thing that if if the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in us that's what's going to quicken our mortal body. And James is speaking here. He's speaking about the idea of respective persons. Well, the whole principle is is that you don't have respect of persons. Well, you you don't have respect of situations either. There's our God can do anything. There's nothing impossible for him. And yet we have the things that we think God can do and the things that were not sure he can do. And it's the same thing. We have faith in regards to certain things and not faith in regards to other things. Part of our problem is is that not your problem. Excuse me. You're all saints, but I'll mark myself as the chiefest of all sinners. The part of my problem is is that I think there's only certain areas that I use faith. I don't need faith on the job. I I I got a contractor's card and I as a licensed electrician and and you know I I've got a utility contractor's license and I'm registered in three or four I I don't I don't need faith for that. See I have a respect. Most all of our faith all of what we feel that we have to have faith for is always comes down to healing. We need faith for spiritual advancement. We need faith so it's not with respect to persons. In other words, we can believe for with somebody that believes. I remember we first came into the message. Well, the first people we wanted to share the message with was the UPC people cuz they look like message believers. They got so tired of hearing about Brother Brano. You'd run up to them and say, "Do you believe in Brother Brano? You got a long dress on. You got long hair. you know, so oh, you know, they were all nice. Oh, yes, we heard of Brother Ram. It was a a had a great ministry. Thank you very much. And we couldn't go no further because we we had a respect. But yet some sinner, you know what I mean? Somebody that uh you know was on a street corner wasn't doing so good. you know, we we wouldn't sew a seed there because we didn't have no faith. And therefore, our faith became a respector of persons and and we let so many things keep our faith from working. Now, we're talking about a faith that we're going to need to have on this journey. And so that faith has got to become unencumbered. We can't let everything Satan throws up at us take our faith away from us. So that's why James said that what we've got to do is we got to keep ourselves unspotted from the world. We we've got to incorporate holiness in our life. We've we've got to we've got to steadfast resist temptation and and resist the the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes because those are things that that rob your faith because then you put yourself under judgment and now you even have respect of persons towards you and you don't feel that you can freely partake of the promises of God. And every bit of faith is based on promise. So, I'd like to read this statement to you that I was chasing Brother Ben all around the house uh trying to hear. And this is from uh a reaction to an action. So God's watching, how we react. And in this sermon, he talks about how God tests us, how he loves to test us. Brother Ram preached that many times. Be certain of God, understanding those things. But I I love what he said here. This is the story of Elijah and the meal offering. And it's the story of this. I'll just read it. When Elijah one time at the school of prophets had come up there and they sent some of them men out from the school and they didn't know the difference between wild gourds and and peas. Now, brother Bram says some prophets, you know, but he could say that. But he picked up a a lap full of wild gourds and throwed them into the pot and one of them screamed out, "There's death in the pot." Now listen, Elijah's now going to start describing faith. Elijah said, "Don't get excited." Our messenger said, "Don't get excited. Be still. Know that I'm God." No matter what the storm rages, no matter how high the billows rage, no matter how dark it seems to get, faith will stand there. You understand? Because as we go farther down this road, you get farther away from the camps, you get farther away from everybody's comfort zone. You've got to have a personal comfort in God's word. You have to have a perfect You have to have your own perfect connection with the voice and with the word of God and with the spirit of God. You got to know you have the Holy Spirit. You've got to know that you're forgiven. You've got to know that he walks with you. You got to know he promised you he wouldn't leave you nor forsake you. So no matter how bad he can paint the the picture, you know, the picture isn't what controls your life. You know what controls your life is the promise. That's what we live by. By these exceedingly great and precious promises, we're partakers of divine nature. This is a beautiful story. There's death in the pot. And Elijah said, "Don't get excited." He went and got a handful of meal and he throwed it into the pot and said, "Eat." Why? When Christ is put in death. When Christ is put into death, it don't matter when there's death. What? The wages of sin is what? Death. Right? Sometimes you're you're if if you don't feed, you'll starve. It doesn't matter if you I it don't matter what sickness you may have that's trying to take the life from you. And he says, "But when Christ is put into death, life comes in instead of death. I don't care how far you're gone, how low you've sunk, how immoral you are, how degraded you are, how sinful you are. When Christ comes into the heart, death fades away and life comes into the same place. from death in the pot to life in the pot. Hallelujah. That's part of the what we're going to need for the faith to complete the journey that if we put Christ into the situation, if we put the Lord into the situation, he'll take that situation and bring it to life. the life you want to live. You wouldn't be here tonight if you didn't want to live. Right. You say, "Well, I'm just here because I'm afraid to go to hell." Good enough. Wise. I'll take a church full of people that are afraid to go to hell. I'd rather have that than somebody just thinks that they they're so set on going to heaven that the word of God won't even put them under conviction. I'd rather have that little sinner boy saying, "Father, forgive me for I have sinned." than a house full of scribes and Pharisees saying, "Oh Lord, I've done this and oh Lord, I've done that." Why? He come to the poor of this world, rich in faith. He came to the sick, to the brokenhearted. Which one of us here isn't a sinner saved by grace? Oh my. I'll have you all to know that since the day I come out of my mother's womb, I never broke one promise, never told a lie, never stole anything, never said one bad thing about anybody. I'd be wearing my halo, but it's just too big. There ain't none of us like that yet. We'll draw conclusions about one another. We'll look at one another's lives. We'll we'll we'll think this person has faith and this person don't have faith. This person knows more about the message for so we think that they they're more apt to have faith than a miracle. And we build all these statuses. We build all these statuses. We build all these conditions. We build all these fake images. And none of it has to do with us. It has to do with putting the meal in the pot. Putting Christ in our lives. So how dark you fall, how big of a mistake you make, no matter how deep you've stumbled, if you let Christ, it'll put life back in your life. You say, "Well, I've done the same thing five times." You know what Jesus said? He said, "Forgive him 70 times 70." I'll tell you one thing I know about him. I don't know very much, but I know one thing. He practices what he preached. You got to have confidence. So, and if your heart condemns you, God's greater than your heart. So to have the faith to go forward, we know we're going to have to work real hard on keeping us spotless from the world. Cutting off the avenues that Satan gets to us in. Uh cutting off the sin that so easily besets us. Satan's got a punch coming and you got to protect that. You got to do what you can. You don't if someone drags you down, don't walk with them. Don't fellowship with them. Don't be around somebody every time you come back you're angrier and hotheaded and all mad. Just be polite. Bow out because you want to be right. This is the kind of faith we're going to need for the journey. Not a faith that's that is temporary, right? Not a faith, but it's got to be a faith that that you can't bluff. Now, you can't bluff it. You got to have it. You can't bluff it. Satan knows when you're bluffing. And he also knows when you've got it. Your heart condemns you not. And you're a Christian. You have a right to every promise that God made in his book. So you So what we're trying to bring out here tonight is that faith only comes by the word of God. So faith has to have a resting place, right? So, so faith is based on what promise you have. And we'll go to that here in just a moment and try to close. You have the right to every promise in this book. It's yours. No matter what the consequence is and what the outcome, you don't look at that. You look at the faith that God give you to the promise, then it stands there. Nothing will move it. It's the faith that God gives you to the promise. Now, sometimes we take faith and think it's something that we muster up like like strong will. You ever eat a meet a child that they just get stubborn? I ain't going to move. I ain't going to eat that. They'll just say no and they'll scream and they'll holler. You know what I mean? And and they've planted their foot down and nobody knows how to move that child. They just they're just stuck. Well, we know how to move a child. Spare the rod and you lose the child. I don't believe in beating kids. I believe you can spank them. Reasonable. But sometimes kids just needed enough to be able to go. I remember one time uh Davey took a a slingshot and and and so he took that slingshot. I hope I don't get you two guys mixed up, but he took that by the rubber and he swung it and that thing went out and bap and stabbed him in the head. And my dad really give him one and told him really uh really put it on him real hard and then after about 30 40 minutes he'd come in and you know and he sat next to grandpa and he says well grandpa I love you. That's the attitude. Lord, if I'm wrong, correct me. I want to be right. It's not going to change who you are. But if your heart condemns you, if it does not condemn you. So, let's on the journey going forward. You want the promise, you've got to make sure that you're meeting the qualifications for the promise. Confess, make right, bring forth meat meant for, you know, apply the token. Move those things out. Bring them under control. Purpose in your mind. I'm not going to read this stuff. I'm not going to watch this stuff. I'm not going to go do this. I'm not going to go do this. God, I surrender. lead me back because he wants to. He wants to be one with you. Father, may they be one as we are one. But if not, then we become respectors of persons. In fact, we even become respectors of ourselves. Oh, I'm not good enough. But he said, "No matter how low you are, no matter how degraded you are, you put Christ into death and life will take its part." So we we don't want nothing that's fake, you know. And when real faith catches the vision, it can't keep silent. No, I say, excuse me. And when real faith has caught the vision, it can keep silent and rest calmly because it knows it's going to happen. Don't forget that. It don't have to be stress. I believe I believe I'm going to make this happen. you know, I'm going to have such positive faith and and such No, what's the vision? It's in his hands. It's his promise. Your faith is in what? What he promised. And I'm gonna just read a couple more statements and and just hope that when it's all said and done, we can understand we're talking about a kind of faith for the journey. Not a temporary faith for a circumstance. Not a temporary faith for a challenge. Not something that we we've that we is called into action by desperation, but in every day believing that every promise in the book is mine. And every promise in that book applies to me. And I have a a I'm entitled to every promise in this book. No matter what it is, I'm entitled to it. But sometimes we get such respect to persons that we don't even believe it's entitled to us. We take ourselves out of the equation. And it's good for everybody else but not me. If it's good for anybody, it's good for you. because God's not a respector of persons. And he says, "Don't forget that faithful rest with perfect assurance." No matter what the storms are saying, how contrary it looks. Faith rest with assurance. Faith can take it and stand upon a rock. Look into a grave or into the waters where a lovely little chunk of your own heart has been buried. And faith can look across the sea to him that said, "I am the resurrection and the life." Faith rests assurance. So, so we see how in important it is because there's something about faith that we've got to understand that faith has two parts. And too many times, you know, it's like an epoxy. You know, we I was in the painting business for a while and we have the paint there and he I sent a man to the paint store and he took two part A's and he got on the job and he put those part A's in a bucket and he mixed them up and then he rolled the whole floor, showroom floor with part A and 6 hours. It wasn't hard. So, we put some heaters in there overnight. It wasn't hard. Somebody got to the job before us and of course he thought they painted this yesterday and he walked out across it and he got out in the middle and it's a sticky gooey mess. He left out a part. And if you leave out the part, it doesn't solidify, if I could use the the thing, it doesn't hold. So, we So, we want a faith for the journey, a faith that doesn't have to be worked up, a faith that's at rest, a faith that has confidence. One of my favorite scriptures is that if he started the work, he'll finish it. That's a promise. I can rest on that. I can hold to that. I can believe in it. No matter how low I get, I can look up and grab a hold of that promise. I can't rescue myself, but he will rescue me by his promised word. cuz we have the faith of Abraham. We believe that God's able to perform that which he promised. You can't create a promise that God didn't make and then expect him to do it. He gave us every promise we need to make it. And that's what faith does. It links up to the promise. I'd like to close with this quotation. And and he says, "And the spirit and the spirit Jesus told the woman at the well." He said, "The time has come when God seeks people that will worship him in spirit and in truth." That's the word with the spirit. Some people has the word, other has the spirit. But when you get spirit and truth together, something has got to happen. Let us read farther. And it was just a little bit, just a little bit, but it was all she needed. God, let this sink deep into the people's heart. When the prophet of God makes statements like that, let it sink deep. I my antennas go up. In other words, it's he's saying this is something the people need. It's not just a healing service. It's not just an evangelistic service. It's almighty God speaking through his prophet messenger giving the church what they have need of and we don't want to take part of it. We got to have it according to formula spirit and truth. Some people have the spirit they don't stay with the word. Some people have the word and they don't have no life, no spirit, nothing to make put the word into action, nothing in their lives that lets them anchor on that promise till they feel the reality of that promise coming to pass in their life and they know they're a partaker of the divine nature of God because that attribute is manifesting in their lives. We're entitled to that. That's God's promise for us. That's what he wants for us. For you to partake of divine nature and have divine nature alive in your life. He don't care about your religion. You can't be religious enough for him. You can't be righteous enough for him. Our righteousness is as filthy rags. But you can have a heart for them. David had a heart for him. A friend of God. Abraham. Look at these guys. Their lives seem to be in shambles. But the only thing that beat on their hearts, they wanted him. So he he says he says so she only had a little bit of meal and a little bit of oil. Now the prophet God wants this to sink in. It don't matter how much if you have faith the size of a mustard seed. We've heard that parable over and over again. But we're never satisfied with mustard seed faith. We want to we want to make up our own big faith. He don't need your faith to do anything. The only faith that he's looking for is not a faith that produces, but a faith that believes. This is true. God made the promise. The promise is to me. He's able to keep it. He's able to change me. He's able to change the circumstance. He's able to do exceedingly and abundantly above what I can ask or think. Oh, then you start resting. Hey, the Lord has this. And so he says this. He says, "But it was all she needed. God, let this sink deep into the people's heart. You may be down to your last handful. I've heard people say, "I don't have very much faith, Brother Brandham." But what but what you got, if it's real faith, mix it with God's word and look what it will do. See, you have faith. But you got to mix it with the word. You've got to take that faith and find a promise and take that promise out of the word of God and personalize it. If you just have the faith and you don't have the spirit and the word mixed together, then it's not complete. It's got to be mixed. I go continue and close it. You may be down to your last handful. I've heard people say that, Brother Bram, but what you got if you real faith mix it with God's word. Look what he'll do. You say, "Well, Brother Brandham, I've been to every doctor, been at every clinic. Oh, I've joined church for my sins and I've done this. I can't help what all you've done. What little faith. You got enough faith to be out here tonight. Then mix that with the word and get ready. She stirred it up together. That's the only thing between her and death. That may be the only thing left for you tonight. Between you and death is what little spirit that you can muster up in your heart to believe it. Mix it with God's eternal word. And when she did, I can see her put her little ragged curtain back and look in and the little boy holding his little stomach. Mother, are you ready to cook the little cake? And and uh and she stirred it up together. That's the only thing between her and death. That may be only thing left for you tonight. between death is what little spirit you can muster in your heart to believe it. Mix it with God's eternal word. And when she did, I can see her pull the ragged curtains back. The little boy holding his stomach. Mother, mother, are you cook the little cake? Yes, dear. Just a few minutes. Mother's mixing it up. Mother's breaking into two. And you take half of it. Oh, honey. And we'll take care of that. And what was it now? The word and spirit mixed together. And you know the rest of the story. She walked out there and she heard the voice. Give me to drink. Give me to eat. So what was her story? See, we don't if we get into the spirit of it. You see, everything that we're involved in has two ends. Don't forget, no matter what your problem is, there's another end. God works on both ends. He works on both ends. Don't forget there's another end. Don't forget there's another part. God's already working. He's already working on the other side. He made the promise. He's already working to fulfill it. He wants you to take what little faith you have, what little spirit you can muster up and mix it with his word, knowing he's on the other end. He's working on your behalf. You say, "Brother McGary, you don't know how afraid I am." It don't matter. His word promised to cast out all fear. You can say, "I'm afraid of this, and I'm afraid I'm going to get sick, and I'm afraid I have that." Don't let that rule your life. Take that promise, take that desire in your heart, mix it with the eternal word of God. Find yourself a promise to anchor that faith to because you've got to mix it with the word. It's got to be mixed together. Faith for this journey has two parts. It has what your spirit can muster and the word of God. It's got truth and life. Truth and spirit. Spirit and truth. And when they get mixed together, it produces the result. And if we need faith for this journey, we've got to be absolutely assured of two things. One, it's by the promises of God that we're partakers of his attributes. And he promised he wouldn't lose a one. And that's what our faith is. Our faith is I can be a partaker of divine nature. I can be a partaker of his mercy. I can be a partaker of his kindness. I can be a partaker of his justice. I can be t partaker of his forgiveness, of his strength, of his deliverance. All that he is, he is for me. And I'm going to believe what he said. And I'm going to put all that I have into it. Doesn't have to be a lot. just a little bit that makes you reach out and seek for that word to hold on to. Remember, he's alive and he's working on the other end. So, this faith for the journey is a long range faith. It's not a shortterm faith. It's not a faith that you have to uh just get up to get something done. It's not a faith that you got that you got to rev. It's a resting assurance that every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line. He called me and I answered. I confess my sins. He was just and faithful to forgive them. And if I stray, he'll leave the 99 and come find me. If I get prodal, I know in my father's house there are servants that are living better. and I'll come to myself and I'll return to my father's house and the father will kill the fatted calf for you. He'll put the robe of all his promises on. He'll restore you to your sunship and your daughtership. He'll take you back for what you were with him eternally. And we're going to need this kind of faith. A faith that's so sure. A faith that's relaxed. to face that steadfast. We're going to need that kind of faith for this journey. So the path forward is the faith for the journey. Let's don't go forward without faith. Without it, it's impossible to please God. Amen. It's simple. Take what's in your heart, mix it with the eternal word, and watch what God will do. God bless you tonight. Lord, be with you. Bill, could you lead us some some worship? Amen. I tossed in. Amen. Mixing our faith with his word that he may work for us. Bless. See, blessed [Laughter] assurance Jesus is mine. Oh, what a forest of glory divine. Oh [Music] sales of God for his spirit.
