Trail of the Serpent
Br. Danny Stemen
September 02, 2023
2023 Labor Day Youth Meetings
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

desire of their heart may they have met together Lord and you would show them Father your great love Lord I just pray if you can move me to the side you can just speak your word Lord may it be a revelation to their heart father something the enemy can never take from them Lord we're speaking we've all gathered like this and we've sung the songs but Lord It's to encourage it's to it's to heal it's to deliver and most of all it's to go to the Lost call them I pray Lord and show yourself the Mighty God to each heart or commit ourselves to you now in Jesus name amen and amen how may love the Lord this evening certainly wonderful to be back in the house of God and we have certainly have enjoyed the fellowship in in all the hospitality that you've given to us and we just want to say thank you amen and we're just expecting the Lord to do even Great and Mighty things for us amen amen if you turn in your Bibles to the Book of Revelations the 12th chapter amen I had started on a subject last night and it was not one that I had intended to preach on but um as as we come close to the service it just seems the mind of the Lord amen he he turned it in another Direction and it can be a scary place for a minister to be after he's prepared things and got ready and then all of a sudden the Lord wants to turn it at another angle and so when he does that you just trust the Lord and amen and just keep walking and so what we started last night we want to continue on today with the help of the Lord so Revelations 12 verse 1. and there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 Stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head and his tail drew the third part of the stars of Heaven and did cast them to the Earth and the dragons stood before the woman which is ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man-child who's to rule All Nations the rod of iron and her child was called up to God into his throne you can be seated may the Lord bless your eating of his word he's speaking about last night of of Isaiah 14 that God had through his Prophet had exposed the spirit that was in this this King this power of Babylon and he didn't call him by the his given name he didn't call him uh by by what he was on Earth he called him the identified that spirit for where it came from and and he called him by the name that had been given to him in heaven and that name was Lucifer and and he began to to say what was in his heart and and to say what his desire was and then he made a proclamation a prophecy and that prophecy was that he would be cast down and that it would come to a place they had realized that he didn't have any more power than any other man amen even though in his lies and his deceit in his tales that he has told he has weakened the Nations his influence has has disrupted homes and disrupted powers and and corrupted everything that he has touched because that's what he is he's a perverter right he's not a Creator he cannot create amen so when the prophet comes amen he comes to expose amen his works he comes to expose where he's at so Isaiah could say when he looked at this King this Babylonian power he could say this power that is in you and he identified him explicitly to be the power of Satan we saw the same thing in Ezekiel when he looked at the prince and he said you've been in Eden I've recognized you and I see where you're at and you begin to describe what he wasn't eating and begin to say the great uh talents that he had in music and everything you see because in heaven Lucifer was the original Archangel of God this enemy that we have amen was an enemy with a position and his position was one to worship God Amen is one to lead the people in a place where it was holy holy Lord God Almighty there are some powerful sort of power in that worship that in his heart something began to happen that he desired that power and the Bible says he was perfect in all his ways until iniquity was found in him but he was a creature of beauty amen you would never look at someone like that and say there's the serpent right there's the Dragon come on you would never look at something like that and and and and make him out to be something ugly he was beautiful and and this is what the spirit was wanting amen his people to see that when he comes his plans are always in Beauty always in something appealing and in the appealing is the deception because something so beautiful could not deceive us could it but this is what he was and so I just want to describe him a little bit this this evening you know if we can take away from these services this thing that no longer do we have to fear this enemy [Music] amen amen no longer amen the Bible calls him a man amen God says I'm not a man come on church he says I'm not a man a man will lie but I'm not a man I want you know the one that has come here in this hour the one who is here in this meeting is not a man he's greater than a man he he will not tell you a lie if he places a desire in your heart that is not a lie it is from God and it's meant to be received amen it's meant to be filled if he's placed in you that desire for the Holy Ghost it's meant to do exactly what it is that desire did not come from Satan come on Church Satan's a man God Amen became man to take away the power of that man that will lie to you he became man so that you could stand in the grace amen that God has given you in this hour and you can stand up and not be afraid you don't have to be afraid of suicide you don't have to be afraid you're going to fail you don't have to be afraid that you'll be lost hey you can look at me all you want I'm going to preach to you on Church Satan amen will put a lie over you you understand the hour we live in I'm in the hour we live in God allowed that Pillar of Fire that all these prophets have talked about amen Moses talked about him Abraham talked about him amen all of these prophets talked about the pillar of fire but God allowed science Amen to take its picture to say this is the god do you notice where the pillar of fire is it's over the top to lead the people Prophet said he's come back in this hour to lead the people again where did he lead them to he led them out of Egypt he led them through the Red Sea he led them through the Wilderness he led them to the promise he placed them in their land he didn't bring you here to lose you he brought you here to place you blessed be the name of the Lord he brought you here to place you so so he allowed this picture to be taken and then another picture that was taken was of the hood of death Satan his power it was not over their head it was over their eyes completely covered their head one is on top to lead the other blinds you whether it's disease whether it's indifference misconception it is a blindness that comes over you now brother Branham said in in his ministry we know these things and we preach these things because amen first amen a prophet announced we can see it through the eye of a prophet before we even experience it we can see it through the eye of a prophet Jesus said if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you receive a prophet's reward what does that mean that means all that God has poured through that Prophet is yours amen if you can receive it by faith and I want you to know it's not going to be your faith it's his faith amen that has come to you this is what Peter confessed that the gate beautiful he said it wasn't my faith it was by the name of Jesus Christ it was by the power of Jesus Christ it was the faith of Jesus Christ that done this work this is why God wants your body not your ability come on church it's not going to be you walking around I said look what I'd done it's not you trying to get to a special man or a special person God is here tonight we put our thoughts on this man or this person if I can just have him lay hands on me or him pray for me or him look over me no no no amen the one who made us the one who created us it's right here tonight he's in this room and he'll come by the preaching of the word he's going to come by the word he follows his word blessed be the name of the Lord so we want we want to when we leave we want to leave this place with not a fear of the enemy and that's revelation now brother Adam said that they're is a deception that comes in this hour and I want to I want to dwell on this and this is why I've read Revelations 12. I want you to bear with me because I want to just take this principle that we see in Revelations 12 and apply it to this this meaning and and what's happening amen but because of the scripture we now Know The Enemy through many different titles right we know him as the serpent we know him as a an angel an angel of Light he's called a serpent he's called an angel of Light he's called a roaring lion amen he's caught a dragon we read here he's he's called a dragon what a dragon is nothing but a serpent but it's a larger serpent he's called the old serpent in the Greek he's called he's caught a pollen in the Hebrew he's called a badon and they both mean Destroyer Destructor one who tears down he tears down lives he tears down expectations he tears down desire he tears down amen your desires to come to church your desire to enter in he'll tear it down and then he'll tell you that there's nothing there for you he's a destroyer he's an old serpent he's been around a long time he's been called a champion which means he's won many battles right he's been successful in many tactics but God wants to expose him and and he wants to expose him just not in a corporate way but in your life and and and so I just want to read a number of these things brother Branham said he said now every Revival every Revival produces twins right yeah amen my church we have I don't want to call it an epidemic it's not an epidemic I mean we just it's a lot of twins we got five sets of twins in our church starting with my boys my boys were the first twins my my grandfather on my wife's side he called me one day many years ago Brother David and he's like uh Hey listen I'm preaching on twins in my church can you send me a picture of your boys and I said no you're not preaching about my twins one's false and one's real both of my twins are sons of Gods so he laughed and I never sent it Hallelujah he moved right on to somebody else anyway but I want you to think about this principle of twins because brother Branham points this out and and he had said I want to preach on the trail of The Serpent and I'm going to go back home and doing it and he goes and he speaks about twins and and what it is he says it's it's just like Cain and Abel yeah right we know about Cain and Abel they grew up in the same home all nourished under the same roof all hearing the same instruction it was not able hearing about Jehovah and Cain hearing about something else they were both under the same teacher both under the same environment brother Branham said the only difference only difference two different fathers but the same wound but two different fathers same environment two different fathers he said it's just like Cain and Abel it's like it's like Jacob and Esau and then he goes it's like Judas and Jesus now we can we can look in the scripture we just find this principle going everywhere it's like Ishmael it's like Ishmael and Isaac even though Ishmael did not come from the same womb the difference of it was Abraham tried to manufacture the promise and he was so convinced that what he had done was right that he told God let Ishmael live before you he was willing to Forfeit the promise for Ishmael he was so willing to accept that life of Ishmael and bypass Isaac that he said God let him live foot before you but you know if God makes a promise if God makes a promise he is not going to change it he's not going to reinterpret it he's not going to send the prophet back and say it again come on somebody if God made a promise it doesn't matter what man says it doesn't matter what the devil says God will keep his word now if God promised to meet you and to give you an experience with him and to give you the Holy Ghost he promised it you're here the word is being preached he's not going to change yeah right that's it now the prophet said the church age book he said when the spirit wants to give a revelation Satan cannot stop it let me say it again when the Holy Spirit wants to give a revelation amen this Satan cannot stop it he knew everything in his power to stop that Revelation from striking your heart come on at a young age he'll try to stop it because he knows what Revelation does to you I can tell you what the word says about Revelation the word says amen the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against revelation of who he is if you get the Revelation tonight that the Lord Jesus Christ is greater than your sin has forgiven you he's greater than your life that his grace is over you tonight if you get the revelation Satan cannot stop it [Music] praise the Lord there's always twins the prophet said now don't forget it so I think it's important that we don't forget it so if there's twins that one is deceptive right and one is true brother Brian said there's always twins don't forget this little flock the church and the last days how many agree were in the last day he said the church in the last day is going to be twins so closely to deceive the very elect if possible I want you to do me a favor tonight quit trying to figure out who I'm talking about I'm not interested in your opinion and I'm not interested in who you think I'm only interested what the prophet said and these are spirits I'm not pointing at a man I'm putting it a spirit [Music] and if you realize that God took the power of that spirit and brought him down to a man who would die then you realize when he exposes it it can't hold you anymore you know when you come in here and you're bound I want to I want to say this I don't say it while you're quiet you're bound by something weaker than you but somehow it's convinced you to give up that's how deceptive the spirit is it's a spirit that convinces you of another angle he said it's going to be so close I want you to listen he says it's Matthew 24 24 he says it's a Pentecostal move again I want you to not give your opinion it's a Pentecostal move well what is a Pentecostal move Pentecostal move is the promise of the Holy Spirit that's Pentecost original Pentecost is the promise of the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the birth so now Satan will deceive where the birth is this is why he says it's a Pentecostal move and these twins are so close and they're both in the same framework and the prophet says in the church age book he says that if the church can get the revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the church discern it and withstand it right discern it and withstand it again I'm not wanting your opinion and I'm not wanting your Grudge it's so easy to to have a grudge or an opinion about somebody put a label on me no you know we live in the hour of labels and politics and I hate political Devils amen that call themselves religious and they want to label you and they want to call you names and if we just put a name over you we don't have to bother with you oh I'm so glad to serve a God that he would go behind the labels well there's a woman called an adultery and he says well let me go talk to her right right some of you wouldn't darken the doors of these places to help a lost one and I'm not interested in recycling people come on he came to seek and save that which is lost you might have your opinion of that woman at the well and you're like hey you know what before before the disciples were converted brother Billy God had to send them away to get groceries so he could talk to this woman at the well hey you go get groceries because you're not going to understand what I'm doing but this woman needs help there's somebody in here needs help that's the one we're interested in I'm not interested in your religion I'm tired of religion I came out of religion I want life and don't you tell me what life sounds like life is the one that gets down in your soul [Applause] changes you from death into life there's a voice inside of you he called it a still small voice amen hallelujah now whisper comes in your ear says give up that voice says but you're mine [Applause] so much like the real thing to see the very elective possible and later on if I get the chance I want to explain how that election comes here brother man I'm talking about deception and election it's going to deceive them because it's almost like the same thing two fathers same mother same church same movement same thing the betting ground is the same where the word false but one of them is perverted amen one of them is a perversion because it's a wrong father and he's stirring people to an organization instead of the word it's a wrong father Stern him to an organization organization is a party thought group thinking it's an organization instead of the word it's the wrong father he said well we're not an organization but it's the spirit he's talk enough it's a cane move you say this is a weird youth meeting what are you he said I go home I'm going to preach on the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end and Trail him right through the Bible what a message that can find him everywhere that exposes him we know what our message is come on church we don't need to re-explained we know what our message is the center of our gospel is Revelations 10. we know it come on Church and that message it wasn't William branham's against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper yeah but it's the will of my father what's the will of my father you're the will of my father was his will that this message would go forth because it's the message as it goes over the people even a prophet Amen in his own thinking thinks is it over is Mercy over is there more look at all the people that are here when he was thinking that you weren't even here but Mercy was not over Mercy is not over because the message is going forth and it's going to go over that life oh we might have to send some preachers off to get groceries [Applause] that woman who's tried she's married five times and the one she's living with is not her own come on she's giving up hope amen the law said she should die but God rich and mercy said I am not done with you yet because amen Satan is done he's wrote his life over yours he's convinced you to give up amen but you come from the seed of the right father and where that seed is Satan can't hide it from God yeah hey man you know we got off the plane amen and I don't know where sister Gabriel is she says welcome to the concrete jungle you know concrete this place didn't used to be concrete there's life there was grass there were Seeds of Life all laying there and all this concrete's poured out you know you can walk around and oh it can be thick but also it's cracked here and cracked here's a you can reach down and just rip that grass out because it's so weak in itself the grass is not strong because it's grass You're Not Strong amen because you're human amen but it was the drawing power amen that is it moved it that concrete could not stop it came in the draw in power went down through what had been laid over its life that whatever was laid over was a lie it could not stop it from coming forth and expressing the power of the seed that is inside of it and if you're a Son of God Amen the word comes over you something in you will say Amen to the word amen it's not the condition it's the seed for when the seed responds to the word the condition has to give way [Applause] speaking to someone in that condition it's a that's what prophet said this is like Judas and Jesus this is this close he said even the Holy Ghost in the Antichrist s are twins the Antichrist don't look like the Pope with all their images the Antichrist looks like the Holy Ghost but he's not so you keep in mind these descriptions of Lucifer he's a serpent he's an old serpent he's a dragon the scripture he read to you in Revelation 12 he's a dragon he's much larger than the serpent but it's the same one this is Satan in his power working through religious and political powers and he's there standing in front of the woman who's getting ready to bring forth the child and he's determined to kill that child at Birth this is the principle that I'm talking about is that's what he wants to do is kill it at Birth so he stands before it do you realize that is that a church service like this is both natural and Supernatural I'm looking through senses see feel taste smelling here you are doing the same thing you're looking back at me you're responding we're contacting one another through these senses but these senses are not even made to contact God so we have the natural and the supernatural that is here amen it's faith that contacts him amen and his faith is here so if the natural can move out of the side and let Faith begin to see what the natural cannot see amen it brings that word amen into effect in your life even before you see it before you feel it I mean everybody wants to feel it everybody wants to see it but that's not what's going to impress God Amen it's when you can believe it amen amen I don't want to be a Thomas here unless I see it or feel it I'm not going to believe it unless I put my hand in his side I'm not going to believe it but there's going to be some Gentiles amen say you don't even have to come to my house just speak the word and I'll believe it [Applause] because his word means so much to this wonder how many today are impressed with the word that's in their midst she was impressed with it amen you would amen we'd be like the bereans who are more noble than those of thessalonica who search the Scriptures Daily to see if these things were sore or not it never said scope the internets live stream every church just search the scripture look and see don't you know they're trying to prove the message wrong through the internet amen but it's by the scripture God never sent the internet he sent the scripture and it's by the scripture we know these things are true hey that's hey man you know our problem is we don't have enough pioneering spirits Hardy and stick it out it's not to the one who runs the fastest 20 endures how do you think these churches started but I had to lay a burden lay a burden on brother David's heart move to Dallas and it didn't start like this start like that in our place in Sarasota started with my dad amen he had been converted and he'd come to when he come to the Lord amen he hears a knock on the wall in his in his in his bedroom and it's knocking and it says feed my sheep feed my Lambs Lord is that you come back the next night feed my sheep feed my Lambs he'd go on the job he was in construction and he said I'd hear knocking everywhere and I'd go around and check the doors I checked the windows and there was nobody there and I finally said Lord if that's you you show me what to do I'll do it he said the knocking stopped the Lord laid on his heart go to Florida where he had went around testifying this message was a cult go back to Florida he said Lord if that's you he said I'll go there for two weeks he says Lord I'm going to lay a fleece out if that's you I will be invited into people's houses to talk about the word without me asking said every night for two weeks he was invited to people's houses to talk about the word without him asking he got the message my mother said Lord if that's you amen let this house sell without advertisement in two weeks the house was sold without advertisement God wanted him down there but he never made it easy on him if you're not a Pioneer in spirit you're not going to be able to make it things get hard you're going to run ain't nobody sit there and we lived in a hotel for a couple weeks and I remember it as as a young boy and and he told the Lord he said Lord I'll live anywhere in Sarasota but I won't live in pinecraft Pine craft is a Mennonite Amish area where he testified he was a cult and so for the next 30 years we lived in pinecraft because you don't tell the Lord where you're going to live because when God places something on your heart it's not for you it's for them [Applause] and we need some pioneering Spirit some people that amen when the going gets rough can you imagine a man standing his congregation was us kids Hallelujah and that was Dad and Dad preached to us for years with the Revelation that God had sent him there his wife and his three kids four kids later five kids he preached to us in the in the room in the living room and that was the church but if it hadn't been a pioneering Spirit to know God has called me here he wouldn't have stuck it out right you see me it wasn't for him it was for you we need people that can stick it out what you don't feel like it or not you know that he called you you know that he spoke to you that you have an anchor God has sent me here he has brought me to this place and I'm going to stick it out because his purpose is greater than my purpose his desire is greater than my desire his will is not my will but my will must be his will Lord not my will but thine be done I wonder if we could pray that tonight not my will but thine be done in my life not what not what I want not my education not my career amen but your will Hallelujah just keep in mind now let's see brother Branham announced that we're in Satan's Eden and that old serpent through his political powers and his religious powers has again challenged the creation of God even changing what a man or a woman is changing them in their genders you can choose be whatever you want whatever you think and he comes in a confusion and he anoints the people with this confusion and he gets them to believe a lie that there's somebody that they're not right you understand this is the hour amen the people are so confused but he's here to show you the holy spirit is here to show you your identity in him brother man said I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of the people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed listen it isn't the people that I'm talking about it's that Satan has got a hold in their lives through sin and indifference and disease notice sin which is unbelief indifference you know we'll go to the services I I mainly came because of the volleyball but I'll come in here tonight you know and I'll sit here but you're indifferent to what the Lord will do you're under end disease he said Satan gets a hold of people's lives this way but you should see their faces when Satan knows he's going to be exposed the most peculiar changes come over their faces over their countenances he says these changes is because Satan is afraid if we could just change his position in this room tonight to not one of power over you but to one a fear of you amen he is afraid because he knows that the spirit of God is about to let the people know of his works that's why he hates these meetings so much when names are called and diseases are revealed Satan's hate hate it hates it what is it it's not mind reading it's not telepathy nor is it witchcraft it is a revelation of the Holy Ghost the scripture I read to you in Revelation 12. brother bam said that she's clothed in the sun he said it's the dispensation of Grace the woman clothed in the sun is a dispensation of grace and the Moon is under her feet he says it was the law as it was passing away in the crown of 12 stars is the apostolic Doctrine he said it is the church bringing forth Jesus Christ so notice the position the of the Dragon is to stand before the church and stop the birth of the Holy One right when Jesus was born we saw it amen there was a proclamation issued by the Roman Empire to sway all the children from two years down because we've missed him be missing but we got to kill him why he's a king whenever a king is born it's a threat to the current King on the throne whenever a king is born it is a threat to the current King on the throne so we gotta kill him we got to stop his influence amen how in the Garden of Eden and I'm gonna I'm gonna say some things that are familiar to you and that is we see a serpent he's more subtle the Bible says in all the beasts of the field he had characteristics that Satan took advantage of Satan knew what to use now Satan is such a person now he may not be stronger than God but what he is is very cunning and what he does is he plans by studying we read about Napoleon who was a great warrior and great General before he'd ever come into a country he would take the map of that country and lay it down and he'd look at every Creek and every bridge and he would look at every field and he would look at everything and he'd plot a strategy of how he's going to take that country Over Now The Prophet says Satan studies you what do you think about that he studies you you say I'm not important then you must be if he studies you he studies your life and how why does he study it he wants to see how you use the word how you use the word he's going to study you he's going to study your nature he's going to study your family tree he's going to plot out your life he's going to study the weaknesses of your flesh amen he's going to study the Tendencies of the parents and of the grandparents he's going to study do they have anger issues is there nervousness in this family is there cancer in this family come on church is there abuse in this family is there this and this and he's going to study it because he's going to use it over your life and his whole purpose is to study how you use the word because he has to stop the birth because if anybody knows the quotes it's Satan don't think because you know the quotes you got the Holy Ghost anybody knows who knows the word it's Satan he he knows it the difference between Satan and Jesus is Satan knows the word and Jesus is the word so when Satan says it he's saying it to argue with it but when Jesus saying it it's saying it because it's him he said I know you're tired if you need to go get groceries get them but let the woman at the well sit here because we need to preach tonight we need to have some Pioneers in here because we're going to get through to that person come on one of the scariest things in the Pulpit is to watch the preacher take a drink because you know he's just getting fuel praise the name of the Lord so he's study in your life well you just I mean it's gone it's good time to be you know the best time brother Andrew to be transparent is in church be honest amen a lot of people they come up now you know I just want to be right I just want to be right with God I just you know I just want but there's things in their life that Satan has studied and he's held up put a hold over that and they don't want to say what it is so he studied their strategy they're going to be honest with it are they going to say it are they going to talk about are they going to expose it so he just said nice you just go on out there young people you're just going up there you you pray cry a while but don't confess and if you think amen that what you do up here is going to change you without confession you're wrong brother said all your prayers all your fastings will not do anything with God the only way you'll know you're overcoming is in the word come on so Satan wants to transplant he wants to change the formula because he studied you he knows what makes you excited and what doesn't how's the Dallas Cowboys doing oh let me tell you man this year we're going to win the Super Bowl you're going to church [Music] who's preaching Danny he's not my favorite you know foreign who's the quarterback of the Cowboys Everybody's scared to death I bet you these boys could tell you see he studies you you know I look over a congregation we watch Him worship Him raise their hands but I wonder behind that hand is how many unconfessed sin no why did I even say that let's get happy you see he stands before the woman she moves over here he moves he's standing before her because I've got to stop her from fulfilling the word he knew that the birth of this child he knew that the birth of this child was his defeat his total absolute defeat he studies you he knows my family he knows my family tree how many has ever done that ancestry.com thing just learn to you anybody else want to be honest good now it's coming I've done it because my wife made me she wanted to know where I came from I tried to tell her you know when you look at your ancestors a lot of times somebody told you you're from here and you're from there and you're from this place and you're from that place and then you you go and look at where you came from and it I'm not from there he said I was from over here but I'm from over here Satan studies your family tree that way you know I heard all my life I was German so I thought I have to act like them all right I am thinking of it I'm sorry uh just the way it is you know I I'm German so I gotta be that way well I'm a Mennonite I must be German not German you know some of you need to take a birth test find out where you're from because I could have lived all my life thinking I'm I have a Heritage in the men of that church and I'm German [Applause] Hallelujah Martin Luther just salute my face now I'm Scotland bagpipes dresses [Applause] I'm not who I thought I was I'm here to talk to you tonight where somebody told me all my life where I came from and it was a twin he was not the one I thought it was he told me I had to be like my family he told me my family tree was in the stemens and in the Goldens and it ended over here and it started over there come on buddy and it come over there but then hallelujah I begin to read the word and it was another birth test amen and that birth has said in the beginning was the word [Applause] God and the Word was God and then I turned a little bit over to Ephesians 1. I want to tell you you're blessed tonight not just the Ephesian church but the saints that are here because you are already in him before the foundation of the world I want to look around and I want to find where that guy who lied to me about where I'm from I want to find him tonight and I want to tell him I don't have to act like a German I don't have to think like a German I don't have to conduct myself like a German I have another father and neither do you you don't have to stay under that father that tells you you have to live under abuse live with suicide live with these lies you have another father [Applause] don't like this don't worry about it I'm running out of here well Glory Brother John why I found out something else funny my little sister blonde headed blue-eyed took the test and found out she's part Nigerian somebody's lying I said somebody's lying yeah come on that's right oh how the devil wants us to get confused it's the trail of the serpent you don't have to live under his influence here anymore I say unto you in the name of the Lord amen for his promise is unto you and unto your children and even as many as the Lord untouchable that's your father thank you Lord he was a serpent he went from this great singer he went from this great singer in heaven mother Brown said his tail and we know that this red dragon we're going to talk about him for a minute because he's describing him he's a red dragon he's seeing him John's looking at him he says there's a dread Dragon we know it's symbols before he'd been a serpent but it never described him with color he never said what the color of the serpent was but now he gives a description calls him a red dragon because he's identified with something he's identified with one of his twins and one of his children his name was Esau he came out and he's red and he's hairy and they caught him Esau because he's red but that's not what made him eat him his name was changed when the birthright came in yes and in a time of pressure he wanted soup he wanted what his passion desired right instead of what God had promised God said before he's ever born I hated him and the reason I hated him is because he took my promise and he cheapened my promise and made it something physical right right oh my God made it a bowl of soup you can eat it when I feel like it if it's a Birthright you can't ever get away from it Amen brother Jonathan you'll never run farther than it ask Jacob when you get the chance got to show up show up in your dreams show up in your backsliding yeah when you run and get so far from God now you're going to end up in a place and you're going to try to sleep it off God will appear to you you know where that happened to him it happened to him at Bethel and he took a stone and he laid on it the the Jewish Jewish history says it was actually a stone that had come off the altar that his father Abraham built when he first entered into Canaan you know what our grandfathers have built and our forefathers have built we start treating them like they're pillows we sleep on it was actually meant to worship and he was sleeping on it and God appeared to him and he saw the latter Angels ascending and descending did I do that right amen is going up and down he said God appeared to him he said I've remembered my promise Father Abraham your father Isaac and I'll not leave you not leave you this is a man who the church had tried to give him the birthright and it didn't work you see you can't get the birthright from the church you got to get it from him you see the mother the mother had already sold him listen I know your brother's in line see the church can lose faith because God had already told her that it's the Elder Shall Serve the younger he's going to get the birthright he'd already promised it but she couldn't hold on she couldn't be a pioneer so Satan used their affections because Isaac had his favorite and she had her favorite and that's a problem in a Christian home when you have your favorites and so Esau had the ear of his father Jacob had the ear of his mother and she knew that Isaac was wanting to bless Esau give him the promise she runs into Esau you know last night you were Moses today your Esau praise the Lord I'm not asking you to take off your shoes if you knew what was under there you'd think man Hallelujah Eagle socks she said Esau is going to get the blessing from your father but I know how to make the soup that he likes I'll make the soup for you you see when the church thinks it can make the soup you got a problem because this is not produced by the church we're only here to bring what we have in US and she says and I know where his clothes are so what in the world you've gotten that Puppet Man it weighs 20 pounds Brother David aren't you glad that I didn't ask for your coat you like this how does it look on me come on come on so now the mother church has fixed me up in my brother's coat and I'm going to go get the blessing with what he wears you see we try to imitate one another and think we got it I smell like him come on here's a blind prophet here's up now I'm changing now you're a blind prophet it is he just is a great night there's a blind prophet he can't see me but he can feel me and he can smell me oh yes this is him this is him even a prophet was deceived and he gave him a blessing young people don't ever think that you have to act like someone else this actually fits this is scary this fits me it's like the holy spirit in the Antichrist it fits but it's not mine hey you glad I didn't wear your coat Hallelujah you see God doesn't want you to act to talk to be like someone else he doesn't want me to preach like Brother David he don't want Brother David to preach like me he don't want any of these preachers to act like me neither does he want me to act like them and so he gives me my own coat it's the same code everybody will get but it's his Spirit on an individual vessel it's his coat not my brother's coat hello you know I've used this example many many times people deceive themselves to think if if they got to act like somebody else they must have it yeah right that's right if I act like somebody else I'll get it because you know I know they got it so if I act like them I'll get it he didn't ask you to act like he don't want me to act like you right right come on Brother come on Church let's all sing together tonight Hallelujah we love the Lord I'm almost sounding like you you need do you need your crease cut I'll cut them for you yeah we're not supposed to be like one another you see the Holy Spirit he likes to use this example because I remember one time I was I was out in India and I was I used this and I was attracted over to these bunch of ministers sitting over there and there's a guy sitting right in the front he was big and tall he had a real shiny suit real shiny he's sitting there and he's looking at me and I'm preaching this and I took this example and said here give me your quote and you're going to be the blind prophet and I took I said now bless me father bless me father I know before him had him put his hand on me and I said bless me father bless me and and as I begin to do that now he never looked at me like he was happy to be there at all he was sitting there and he was staring at me like he was scared to death my daughter what in the world this guy he's a strange believer you know he should be saying Amen to this because it's it's a good example and he wasn't saying amen and he was looking more scared and as we say in Florida more scared her and more scared her and more scared and he's looking like that and I'm saying you know God doesn't want you to follow a a blind prophet's blessing and and wear someone else's coat and he's looking at and there's this young minister in the back he says hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and this guy's looking like this and I finally took the coat off and I gave it to him and he got up and left the meeting I'm glad well you're not him and and and he left the meeting I'm like what in the world is going on you know I found out later he was the Pentecostal overseer of that area and the young man in the back who was hollering amen was a man he'd been telling he was a young Pentecostal Minister and he was telling that Minister that this message is a cult and it's false and God just want me to use his coat and tell that other minister don't wear his coat and try to be like him [Applause] he had the sin he had to send somebody out to get groceries because he's after that election he has said in his word I will not lose one of them that Antichrist Spirit has come in and over your life and he's told things to you he's told you you can't be free but I want to tell the devil something tonight it's time for you to go get the groceries [Applause] and I got daughters here they're not of the genealogy they thought they was [Applause] yes red is the color of Edom yes the one who sold the birthright sorted out it wasn't worth it to him it's that kind of spirit just try to kill the birth don't you ever settle for what your flesh desires can I say it again don't you ever settle for what your fleshed desires amen it's a deep calling to the Deep amen and where there's a deep calling there's a deep to respond blessed be the name of the Lord can I go just a little bit further well my watch tells me I got 41 more minutes 41 more minutes amen he's a real enemy and because he has so many different names that's what makes him a real enemy because he's adapts himself to every situation he can be called Satan he can be called The Serpent he can be called a preacher he can be called a brother he can adapt himself to anything he can jump right beside you he can praise the Lord right beside you he can sit in this meeting and say Amen brother hey man come on but by their fruits you know them by their characteristics you know them it's because of his adaptability remember Judas was one of the twelfth but the man said he didn't have a devilish Ministry he said he had a god-given holy ghost Ministry he cast out devils he came back rejoicing do you know how many people were healed today in my meeting let me tell you who's the greatest Among Us Judah says I'm one of the greatest now but you know I'm one of the greatest you know here they are standing with the greatest who's ever been ever will be ever should be ever can be and they set their hey who's better Jeremy Andrew Billy brother Dave who is the greatest Among Us well who's greatest to you which one do you like the best foreign you're so carnal here's the greatest and he turned and looks and I'm Not Jesus okay you understand I'm just being what he was he eternally said hey what are you talking about what are you talking about well Lord we're talking about um what were we talking about groceries [Laughter] uh he said did you read who should be the greatest here in this church here they are who is the king of glory Lord God mighty and battle yes open the gates let him come in what were you talking about Brothers do you know where I've been where I've preached who I've talked to what were you talking about Judas was one of them right Satan has proven over and over you're going to bear with me now I am a champion I'm a champion I defeated your fathers I'm not afraid of you in church not afraid of you how loud you sing I'm not afraid of you I don't mind if you come to church even when they don't have church I don't mind how faithful you are that's right I don't mind if you think you raise your hand so you got it life yes yes behind the name it'll make the demon tremble you know I I've been I've seen a lot of things over the years only because I'm getting older as you get older you see more I gotta say brother I've probably seen more than you you know why I'm three times older than you that don't make me a greater person this makes me older but I've seen people come right up to the name of Jesus and turn around and walk away because another father had told them they can't be free they came right up to the greatest name ever has been ever will be ever could be given the name of Jesus there's power in that name Satan hates that name so he has to try to make a substitute for that name his only chance of having any Victory is in lie that's true the guy can make you think tonight at the name of Jesus will not change my situation but it's going to take Danny or she'll have to take one of these preachers Amen to speak to you you have missed it behold I set before you an Open Door this was the the crutch the The Crossing between Philadelphia and laodicea and he said it goes far into the last age and why was it that God sent to God showed that prophet he said I had a dream he said I believe it came from God and I saw a man abusing his wife beating her and beating her with a club every time she would try to rise up he said there's a church trying to receive Revelation he would beat her down with her his Dogma with a three-cornered club the dogma of the trinity amen I know what it's like to be confused I have I have relatives in in the church believe in the Trinity and they say we don't know who to pray to we go we don't want to offend one of them they use it over their life and beat them down every time she tries to get up he beats him down with a lie but he was sent to this age the word was sent to this age to go and take that man by the caller sorry buddy if you were sleeping you're not now amen taken by the caller he said sorry I hope you love me if you love me call me brother amen he said he was bigger than me he said but when I took him by the collar said you treat her like that again you're going to have to deal with me and he said look like he was afraid of me thank you buddy I love you now you're not that guy but I'm just giving an example he looked like he was afraid of me what was it the word that has come in this hour is greater than the lie that has been over the church for generations and generations I'm here to tell you amen that the message of the hour is the revelation of Jesus Christ to tell you who you came from amen praise the Lord trailer The Serpent he'll weave his way into your life and you make you give up and he weaved well brother Danny I just got to say this all right it's okay if you don't like it we don't have to have church tomorrow amen he's going to say what brother Danny I uh you know I'll be able to be strong and I'll be able to have I'll be able to serve God if I if I'm in the perfect church with the perfect atmosphere and the perfect worship and and perfect everything Perfect Adam and Eve how that turned out come on they lived in perfect air conditioner I mean they couldn't even sit in church and complain it's too hot over here it's too cold over here hey you ain't gonna like it I don't care I'm gonna preach I'm going to preach to myself brother Dan if you don't like the air conditioning here get over it yeah I just called myself brother ain't no wonderful in a perfect atmosphere fellowship with God every night perfect health I'll be able to serve God if I feel good perfect health what's your complaint they have perfect health perfect environment and a perfect marriage it's like the look of that perfect marriage there was nothing they can complain about right the only complaint there was was there something with no soul who said to who had it was called The Serpent who Adam had named who Adam had dominion over right my something of a lesser order that Satan studied their characteristics yeah I can use him he's going to go arrange Pastor Adam's sermon for sister Eve and he's going to become Eve's interpreter I like hearing that when I say that he's going to become he's interpreter everybody goes um isn't that great great Acoustics in here it's awesome Eve had another interpreter of the message and he began to make her dissatisfied with perfect environment perfect marriage perfect health perfect Dominion gods of the Earth I mean what more could I get what do you need huh what do you need well you know if I just had more money if I had well they had everything I've given you my word you're in dominion over this place you're to keep it you're to guard it if you go study them words it is you are to take what I have placed you in and bring out of it the potential that's there I'm every service should be like that we come in here to this garden and we bring out the potential brother Branham said if you could only realize the potential of this meeting it's not because I flew from Florida that there's potential here the potential is that you have come and he has come amen and he is here to give you the desire of your heart that's in the word he's here to give it to you bring it right to you perfect environment nothing was wrong until the serpent said hey you know that sermon that was preached the other day I have a little bit different angle than that she goes man what's your streaming address can I subscribe to you well you know it's the beast at the beginning he's the beast at the end good very good and he began to tell her something so convincing that she began to misquote the word of God brother Branham said all it needs is one word missing and it's a gap Satan can pour His poison into you know maybe Adam was not the best preacher that ever hit the face of the Earth serpent was a good one two different fathers here Satan has used him and he's deceived Eve Eve was actually deceived and he impregnated her and she came back to her husband so happy Adam I've got something to tell you it is so good and full of life and she didn't know she was full of death brother bam said she actually thought that boy was from the Lord yes that's right I have life and Adam was God of the Earth Lord over all of that creation God had set him in Adam looked at her he knew what had happened and he looked at her now I have to choose right perfect environment perfect health perfect Fellowship do I want all this but if I keep it I lose her I'm going to change the meeting for just a minute and let Adam himself come and stand here and tell you I loved her and I didn't want to lose her but I knew if I stood up and said what you have is wrong I'll lose you forever and you'll be destroyed I can't lose you Adam's the god of the earth he knows what he's doing right his last Act as God of the Earth is to step out and take her to himself as soon as he partook in her sin first Adam he lost his consciousness of who he was and he fell and the environment was lost the perfect church was lost everything is ruined isn't it everything is ruined he thought he knew God he went and told his wife said listen we're in trouble now we've messed up let's make us some figs fig leaves and cover ourself and maybe God will accept it and they went and they covered themselves and they heard the voice of God walking right Adam why did you come to this meeting this weekend why are you here what have you done do you know how pitiful it is when a man lose sight of his genealogy and he becomes less of a man than what he was born to be I tell you what Lord if you hadn't give me that woman I wouldn't have had this problem it's the woman you gave me he lost his mind because while he was God he took him to herself himself yeah when he lost his mind he blamed her and he turned his whole home into a wretched place a waste howling wilderness God said I've heard what you said it's pitiful what an excuse to blame your wife and to blame me maybe some of you are sitting here like that blaming someone else for your condition but you're before the Lord tonight and he turned to the woman what have you done the woman said well here's exactly what happened the serpent beguile me and he turned to the serpent now you weren't there but can you imagine the extreme fear because this serpent we're told he settled he can talk and Satan has anointed him he can give an excuse he can give a reason he can turn children of God and convince him perfect environment is not perfect perfect health is not perfect he can convince them that God's word is not enough and he's clearing his throat to say well the devil made me do it but God didn't even ask his opinion he turned to him and said because you've done this you're cursed and on your belly you shall go can you imagine those two standing there in that courtroom and they see this upright Beautiful Beast go right down to the ground and their thought I'm next I'm next what did Satan attack he attacked the birth he attacked the birth because he attacked the birth of Sons and Daughters of God God came down and when he cursed the enemy he's on the ground and they're looking at that and they're sitting here in dread what is he going to tell me God told him there's consequences of what you've done but I want to make a prophecy over this situation there be enmity between thy seed and the woman's seed I want to make a prophecy in this hour of darkness when everything has been lost I'm making a prophecy and I'm going to show you something Adam what you covered yourself with is not enough and he killed a lamb he placed that bleeding Lamb's clothes around him he says you're going out of the garden but there be a day you're coming back [Music] what was a symbol there brother Benham began to describe it he said I can look and I saw them weeping as they're going out of the garden but there's something beating something beating against their legs and it's what God has placed around them they are victims amen they've become victims of a satanic attack the serpent at the beginning but there's a prophecy and he says God couldn't stand it as he watched them walking out with that blood running down them he said but there be enmity your head will bruise his heel what does that mean it didn't mean God's just going to step on and say ouch that meant God was going to take a hold of Satan's plan and draw it close to him and he was not going to be able to let Satan was not going to be able to get free from Amen brother man said let me turn your attention now to another time and I see a man walking up a hill and I hear something else beaten again something walking coming down his legs who is it amen it's not a lamb it's the Lamb of God he's going there because he knew the trail of the serpent would come into my home and I couldn't be free of him while I was yet in sin he died for me he took my enemy close to himself the enemy said there's only one thing's never been defeated and that's death every Prophet has died every great man has died every great one's succumbed to it and he said this man's crying this man's screaming just like any other man he looks like just any other man he bleeds like just any other man he looks like just any other man and he stung him with his stinger and when he did God grabbed a hold of him let go that said let go hold on to it let go of me finally pulled himself free but something had happened yeah yeah right Hallelujah what he had held over people's life for thousands of years was no longer in his hands amen this is why we have meetings like this because I'm here to tell you the Lord amen of death has lost his lordship amen the king of the bottomless pit is at the mercy and permission of the king of kings do you know young people Satan cannot hold over your life this fear anymore because the trail of the serpent has been exposed do you know amen he can't hold you with your past anymore because

taken the seed of another amen that was not my husband amen my husband came to me oh Hallelujah do you know that one is in the room this is not the first Adam this is the second Adam the first Adam

complicated we make it hard on people to serve the Lord we make it hard on them to come to him yeah why don't we believe the example God has placed before us he has told us how if you go back and look at looking to the Unseen Brother Band preaching Los Angeles 1959 he's asking how many is there a sinner here wants to raise their hand and ask forgiveness and be and be free and people raise their

ah you know I love the Simplicity of the Gospel how many know how simple it is there's a devil and there's our Lord and savior amen all right that got summed it all up all the knowledge of all the world of all the wisdoms of all the books there's a devil and there's a God hallelujah he's casted his vote against you all right he's casted his hope for you now you decide who you want to be but you know we have a flaw that's how we're human and God knew that so he made us a promise I'd like to read just this a little story in the Bible found in the 19th Chapter of the books of Acts and as it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have ye received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto him we haven't even know so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto John's baptism now I love that because he said wait a minute you don't have the Holy Ghost and you don't know what it is he says then then how are you baptized because he knew there was a promise that if you were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's right so he knew if they didn't have the Holy Ghost he knew that the formula wasn't following all right that's it that's good Paul believed the word amen and so what did he say he said and then Paul said John verely baptized unto repentance that's how far most of us go a lot of times we've been to the altar a hundred times repenting [Music] you know why because we're human right because we do things wrong but listen as we read a little farther he said John very baptized unto repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him should who should come after him and that is on the Lord Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands on them they received the Holy Ghost see we're human right so what God did for us he said you go on the upper room and you wait there until you're endured with the power from above we have lots of names for that we call it the new birth we call it being born again we call it the baptism of the Holy Spirit but remember there's one thing that it was you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is God's gift to you it's it's a power that could be manifested in many different ways but it's a Wellspring of Living Waters that bubbles up inside of you amen and I want you to know tonight that you know whether that's happened or not I like how Danny put it once that's happened to you if you backslide it calls you back and it calls you back and it calls you back you can never deny it [Music] I've not always been what I wanted to be I haven't always been what I should be but I'll guarantee you when he met me on that roof that day in my life I've never been the same I look in the mirror and I don't see and like that guy that I see there but I know he gave me a gift I didn't earn it but I needed it [Music] if this formula was so important to Paul to get the Holy Ghost then I want to offer that to you tonight if you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] there's a pool back here the formula simple repent repent isn't getting a list a mile long of all the sins that's what I used to do when I was a Catholic I'd go into the priest and I'd kneel down and say father I stole the candy bar and I did this and I did that that was a list what the sin was I didn't believe I didn't believe that he could send a power to change me and you've heard that power preached tonight you've heard the gospel preached in the power of the Resurrection and you know the baptism the holy spirit is a possession it's not something you can buy it's not something you can purchase because he already purchased it's a free gift all you have to do is ask for it Lord I need a power I need something from you a Wellspring in my heart a power sent from on high that's going to keep me that's going to change my nature that's going to make me different amen [Music] there was another group of people that heard the same gospel and they cried out in their heart men and Brethren what must we do what what what can I do to to to get this the power this this anointing this blessing that I I see on these feet but what must we do he said repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit amen Paul was so sure of that word that when they didn't have it he said then where how you been baptized because if you were baptized right [Music] baptized right your heart repented Lord I'm just a sinner it's not what I did not all the accident it's what I am and I want to be different and I can't be different if you don't give me a power from on high and if you ever get it you won't have to be up here time and time again you won't have to have preachers huddled all around you trying to encourage you know that Spirit comes by and it convicts you of sin and you quickly say Abba Father yes I'm sorry Lord and you get right to do it in your seat it's over all right because nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand and if he started a work in you he'll finish it to him [Music] and I ask you have you received all right the Holy Spirit tend to believe you want to quit struggling with the flesh all the time there's a power called the gift of God yes it's called the spirit of God and it convicts you of unbelief and when you stray it calls you back and when you get angry it it convicts you so bad you make it right when you offend your brother it makes you go over and grab him and say brother I didn't mean to do that I'm sorry and it keeps you yes it seals you and it takes you and the best part about it it's for you but you gotta come the way he provided he paid the price [Music] he wiped your slate clean now if you're here tonight [Music] and after this great sermon that was preached I believe the devil's been exposed I'll believe tonight if you don't know that Satan's real [Music] now and see this world falling apart but our brother also told us something else he told us that he's real yeah and he can abide in your heart today and I don't care I known people that have been baptized 30 years they've been baptized right and one day the spirit of God come on and they were different [Music] that's God's gift to us as his children is his spirit gift it's a free gift the baptism of the Holy Spirit so young people old people any people [Music] if you don't know you have that spirit [Music] go deep in your heart as I be a brother Danny really touched on it he said if you really confessed have you really poured your heart out to him and if you want the baptism the Holy Spirit I invite you to repent yes to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit how many believe that amen I'm willing to stake my life [Music] aren't you glad he loves you yes yes I mean I'm so glad that he loves me oh my goodness I could I could almost shout he loves me so much amen there's so many songs I want to sing and I don't even know how to sing so I won't bore you with that but I want to just tell you if you haven't been baptized and you haven't received the Holy Spirit he's here this weekend yeah amen and tomorrow we'll have baptism we'll lay hands on those that want to receive the Holy Spirit and we're not going to walk out of here ever to come to this place again [Music] we're going to walk out of here with the victory we've talked about with the freedom we talked about it and it's not going to be our by our might it's not going to be by our power it's going to be by his Spirit saith the Lord so the baptism of the holy spirit's for you amen it's real it's genuine and it comes in your heart I don't care what it does on the outside but never ever mistake is our brother so beautifully laid out and outside experience for an inside birth don't ever confuse the two amen and you'll know it's so good amen let's sing that song we like that this poor man cries I I was that poor man all right Hallelujah Lord bless you you're dismissed tonight go in peace
