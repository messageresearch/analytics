[40:15] is when you when you have something so
[40:18] precious and you never lived life
[40:19] without it you don't know what it's like
[40:21] not to have it
[40:22] but I I thank God for a Godly mother
[40:26] who stood in the gap for me
[40:28] means so much
[40:30] amen we're just reading out of
[40:32] Revelations chapter one we'll read verse
[40:34] four through six also just before we
[40:36] start I believe Brother Richard is here
[40:38] with his wife
[40:41] brother good to have you the Lord uh
[40:43] brought made our past across and
[40:47] um Richards come on and been working
[40:48] with us
[40:49] and uh it's been wonderful to be able to
[40:52] Fellowship around the word and it's nice
[40:53] to have your wife with us as well we
[40:55] pray God be your your portion she's
[40:57] reading out of Revelations chapter one
[41:01] man I need to get there myself
[41:05] Revelations chapter 1
[41:08] we'll just read verse 4 5 and 6 would
[41:11] read like this
[41:12] John to the seven churches which are in
[41:15] Asia Grace be unto you and peace from
[41:17] him which is and which was and which is
[41:21] to come and from the seven spirits which
[41:23] are before his throne and from Jesus
[41:26] Christ who is the faithful witness and
[41:27] the first begotten of the Dead the
[41:29] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[41:31] him that loved us and washed us from our
[41:33] own from our sins in his own blood
[41:36] and hath made us Kings and Priests unto
[41:40] God and his father to him be glory and
[41:43] Dominion forever and ever amen you may
[41:45] have your seats and also if you could
[41:48] just turn in your Bibles we'll also read
[41:50] out of
[41:51] um Hebrews chapter 6
[41:54] verse 19 and 20.
[42:05] Hebrews
[42:07] in chapter 6 verse 19 and 20. would say
[42:13] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[42:16] Soul both sure and steadfast which
[42:19] entereth into that within the Veil
[42:22] whether the Forerunner is for us entered
[42:24] even Jesus made an high priest Forever
[42:26] After the order of Melchizedek so just
[42:30] by way of maybe launching out tonight
[42:32] we'll just kind of uh use this as a
[42:35] foundation as we ministered last time to
[42:38] you on Melchizedek the Forerunner if you
[42:41] look into your Bibles in Genesis Chapter
[42:42] 14 verse 18 it would say it would read
[42:45] like this in Melchizedek king of Salem
[42:48] brought forth Bread and Wine and he was
[42:50] the priest of the most high God and the
[42:52] prophet of God would say this and who is
[42:54] this Melchizedek he would say notice
[42:55] after the battle was over Melchizedek
[42:59] served his Victorious child communion
[43:03] think of that part of himself now we
[43:07] want to see here in type here is in view
[43:09] the communion after the battle he gave
[43:12] of himself because the communion is part
[43:14] of Christ and after the struggle is over
[43:17] after you've done got yourself whipped
[43:19] out then is when you partake of Christ
[43:22] become part of this being you get it
[43:24] Jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't
[43:27] turn him loose until he blessed him
[43:29] that's right battled for life and after
[43:32] the battle is over then God gives you of
[43:35] himself that is his true communion the
[43:38] little bread and wafer just represents
[43:40] it you shouldn't take it unless you've
[43:41] wrestled it out and become a part of God
[43:43] I wonder have you ever wrestled it out
[43:46] and become a part of God he speaks of uh
[43:50] uh uh Jacob wrestling it out with the
[43:52] angel and he said look I'm not going to
[43:54] let you go until you bless me and I
[43:56] believe that's a place where every
[43:57] Christian ought to come to in their walk
[44:00] with God where they realize there's
[44:02] something inside of them they say oh God
[44:03] there gots to be more there has to be
[44:06] more than what I got there has to be a
[44:08] greater blessing there has to be
[44:09] something more you know I've gone over
[44:11] here and I've heard this way of thinking
[44:13] and I've gone to that church and I've
[44:15] heard that way that it's been preached
[44:17] I've come into contact with this this
[44:18] group over here and and maybe I'll I've
[44:20] come in contact with good people that
[44:22] have been living good life but Lord God
[44:24] there's something inside of me that's
[44:26] crying out I need more and you come to a
[44:29] place where you get so desperate and I
[44:31] believe when a Son of God comes to the
[44:33] place where he's thirsting for life and
[44:36] he's in desperation he's saying oh God
[44:37] there got to be more than this church
[44:39] down the street there got to be more
[44:41] than this experience Lord I Thank you
[44:43] what you've done for a man in my life so
[44:45] far but Lord something inside of me is
[44:47] crying out for more I want to tell you
[44:48] if there's something in your heart
[44:50] that's crying out for more then there
[44:52] gots to be more of God for you or who
[44:54] put that desire in there that is God
[44:56] that's a deep calling to the Deep
[44:58] there's a part of God a seed on the
[45:00] inside of you that's crying out to
[45:02] express itself health
[45:04] oh there's something inside of you it's
[45:06] crying on oh God I want more and when
[45:08] you come to that place
[45:10] where you've wrestled it out
[45:12] you've battled for life has anybody ever
[45:14] been in for a battle in life
[45:16] what I want to tell you it's not just a
[45:18] one-time thing
[45:19] you don't just wrestle it out one day
[45:21] and get up and dust off your hands and
[45:23] say well
[45:24] I got the devil whipped it's all over
[45:25] now
[45:28] you better watch out real quick we gotta
[45:30] stay in the word we got to stay in
[45:32] communion we got to stay listening to
[45:34] the word and listening to the prophet
[45:36] and coming to church and reading our
[45:38] Bibles and staying in prayer because if
[45:40] you watch out something will happen you
[45:42] know the prophet talks about a besetting
[45:44] sin or the devil got to punch coming and
[45:46] you got to keep yourself covered up
[45:48] because as soon as you think you got it
[45:49] all figured out as soon as you say well
[45:51] I got the Holy Ghost and I'm
[45:53] predestinated and I can't fall man and
[45:55] I'm just going to soar around Victorious
[45:57] and nothing can bother me and then you
[45:59] start entertaining the old things you
[46:01] used to entertain you start going back
[46:03] and talking to the same friends you used
[46:04] to talk to you start coming over here
[46:06] and start doing the little things and
[46:07] all of a sudden Something's Gonna Wallop
[46:09] you on the head you're gonna come
[46:10] crashing down you're going to find
[46:12] yourself on the ground and you're gonna
[46:13] start wondering god what happened did I
[46:15] really have an experience was it really
[46:17] real when I went to church and I went
[46:19] through the prayer line and the presence
[46:20] of God came and it delivered me and I
[46:22] claimed I had the Holy Ghost Lord I've
[46:24] been soaring for one week two weeks
[46:26] three weeks five months six months a
[46:28] year Lord but how did I get into this
[46:30] condition again and you wonder why you
[46:32] got knocked down it's because you got
[46:34] away from the very thing that got you up
[46:35] in the sky look we got to stay in the
[46:38] presence of God we got to stay in the
[46:39] word we got to stay feasting upon this
[46:42] message we got to keep listening to the
[46:43] voice of this Prophet oh my what is it
[46:47] it's life he said the words that I speak
[46:49] to you
[46:51] the words that I speak to you they are
[46:53] spirit and they are life and if you keep
[46:56] feeding on that word it's going to keep
[46:58] you it's going to protect you
[47:00] oh praise God I know what I'm talking
[47:02] about

[47:14] with the Holy Ghost and you've been
[47:15] changed you become a new creature all
[47:17] things pass away and now you've entered
[47:19] into a communion where the things of the
[47:21] world don't matter anymore it's not a

[48:42] five steps I started walking away oh

[48:48] I don't even drink anymore
[48:51] and I was happy and excited I didn't get
[48:53] down like oh man Christians don't drink
[48:56] Boomer what am I gonna do with my time
[48:58] now
[48:59] sir no you broke through into another
[49:03] sphere you broke through into another
[49:06] world you broke through the carnal
[49:08] Realms you've entered into the spiritual
[49:10] realm where old things have passed away
[49:13] come on I'm preaching the Bible to you
[49:15] it says old things pass away and All
[49:18] Things become new I'm talking about the
[49:20] Battle of life where you've battled it
[49:22] out and you've come to a place of change
[49:24] where the old Nature has passed away and
[49:27] All Things become new now you're in
[49:29] communion
[49:30] nothing like it
[49:35] so just here in
[49:37] just starting our text here just reading
[49:40] Melchizedek was the high priest or the
[49:43] priest of the most high God
[49:46] and I found it interesting
[49:51] thank you
[49:54] you know the the when when you read this
[49:56] out of Genesis you know the the word
[49:59] priest has never been used in scripture
[50:01] before Here Comes this one coming to
[50:03] Abraham to serve him uh bread and wine
[50:07] and communion in in scripture there's no
[50:09] communion there's no bread there's no
[50:11] wine these that these things haven't
[50:13] even been instituted and here I I'm the
[50:14] priest of the most high God there's no
[50:17] levitical law there's no priesthood
[50:18] there's nothing in the scriptures to
[50:20] even mention a priesthood and here comes
[50:22] this one Melchizedek who is the priest
[50:25] of the most high God and so you look
[50:26] into the scripture where did this come
[50:28] from and you start to walk it down you
[50:30] start the what is a priest a priest is
[50:32] somebody who's authorized
[50:33] to carry out the the religious duties in
[50:37] the house of God you look into the
[50:38] levitical law and and that priest and
[50:40] the high priest and the priest had the
[50:41] showbread and and they were keeping the
[50:43] lamps and and uh aligning the incense on
[50:46] the Altar and then once a year what
[50:48] would the high priest do he would come
[50:49] in behind the veil and then he would
[50:51] take uh the blood from the heifer and he
[50:53] would sprinkle the mercy see and he
[50:54] would come in and that was the order of
[50:57] of of the the priesthood under under the
[51:00] aeronic law but here we look into the
[51:02] scripture here come this one he was the
[51:04] priest of the most high God and if you
[51:07] jump into Hebrews chapter 7 verse 11.
[51:13] it says if therefore Perfection we're by
[51:15] the levitical priesthood for under it
[51:18] the people received the law
[51:20] what further need was there that another
[51:23] priest should arise after the order of
[51:26] Melchizedek now I can't preach it or say
[51:28] it any better than the prophet Paul
[51:29] preached it
[51:31] you follow this clear if therefore
[51:33] Perfection were under we're by the
[51:36] levitical priesthood
[51:38] for under it the people received the law
[51:41] what further need was there that another
[51:43] priest should rise after the order of
[51:47] Melchizedek and not be called after the
[51:51] order of Aaron by God's grace we'll get
[51:53] down uh to our day where we're living at
[51:55] for the priesthood being changed there
[51:59] is made a necessity change also of the
[52:02] law because it was the law that the
[52:06] priest operated by
[52:07] without the law without the air without
[52:11] the the law that Moses had given to
[52:13] Aaron and to the priest then there was
[52:16] nothing for though religious duties for
[52:18] the priest to carry out and what he's
[52:20] pointing out then so then if there's
[52:21] been a change if we've now come under
[52:24] the order of Melchizedek then the law
[52:27] has also changed there has to be another
[52:29] word or there has to be another law that
[52:32] we're living under and and Paul would
[52:34] say this in Romans 8 verse 2 he would
[52:36] say for the law of the spirit of Life In
[52:39] Christ
[52:40] Jesus has made us free from the law of
[52:43] sin and death that that's what those
[52:46] statutes were that's what those laws
[52:47] were it was a law of sin and death it
[52:49] was a bunch of do's and don'ts and and
[52:52] he's made us free from the law sin of
[52:54] death for what the law could not do
[52:57] and that it was weak through the flesh
[53:01] oh praise God I don't know about you I'm
[53:03] weak in this thing
[53:05] I have no ability to live the word of
[53:08] God in this thing
[53:10] and if any of you think that you have
[53:12] the ability to manifest the word of God
[53:15] and you think that you can come to some
[53:18] religious conception and understanding
[53:21] and fulfill the word of God I want to
[53:23] tell you if you can do anything to Grant
[53:25] salvation for yourself then what did the
[53:27] prophet of God tell you then Christ died
[53:29] in vain if there's anything man can do
[53:32] to Warrant salvation if there was any
[53:34] good work if there was any good word if
[53:37] there was anything you could do that
[53:39] would make you good enough for salvation
[53:41] then Christ died in vain
[53:43] now let God speak to you because the
[53:45] devil wants to condemn you he wants to
[53:47] try to tell you your life is not lining
[53:49] up he wants to point to all your faults
[53:50] and all your failures but we're not
[53:52] under the aaronic law I'm not under the
[53:55] law of sin and death I have come under a
[53:57] new order now I am under the order of
[53:59] Melchizedek this is a spiritual
[54:02] priesthood I have a high priest who can
[54:04] be touched by the feeling of mine
[54:05] infirmity
[54:10] in that it was weak through the flesh
[54:12] God sending his own son and the likeness
[54:14] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[54:16] sin in the flesh
[54:18] that the righteousness of the law might
[54:20] be fulfilled in US
[54:22] who walk not after the flesh but after
[54:25] the spirit
[54:27] praise be to God
[54:30] when you've battled for life
[54:32] and you've battled it out
[54:34] and you've died to your ways of thinking
[54:36] and your ways of doing things and you've
[54:38] come to a place of desperation
[54:41] or you finally come to a place many
[54:43] times you deal with people they come
[54:45] through a prayer line over and over and
[54:47] and you deal with people who who are
[54:49] going through Cycles over and over and
[54:52] they and you realize you know they've
[54:54] just never got to a place where they've
[54:55] truly surrendered
[54:58] they say they've surrendered Lord I'll
[55:00] do whatever it takes but then they hang
[55:01] on to all those things they know they
[55:03] shouldn't be doing
[55:04] they hang on to those little apps and
[55:06] those little it's the little foxes that
[55:08] spoil the vine you don't think those
[55:10] things make a difference you think you
[55:11] can handle it
[55:14] look I love the scripture where Jesus
[55:16] said I sanctify myself for their sake
[55:19] it struck me one day I was like what did
[55:22] Jesus have to sanctify himself for no
[55:24] Jesus the prophet of God said Jesus how
[55:26] to write to a home he had a right to he
[55:28] could have done all those things he
[55:29] could have been like any of us but he
[55:31] Sanctified himself for your sake he
[55:35] Sanctified himself for those disciples
[55:37] sake because they were going to take
[55:38] this gospel to the world
[55:40] well then if Christ is living in US
[55:44] if Christ is living in you
[55:46] well you're saying well I can handle it
[55:48] I can watch this little show I can watch
[55:50] this little movie you know it's not
[55:52] going to bother me I'll just get a few I
[55:53] won't tell everybody in the church that
[55:55] I'm going to the movie house but you
[55:57] know it'll just be me and another friend
[55:58] and we'll go down there because you know
[55:59] it doesn't bother me it doesn't affect
[56:01] me it's not going to take me away I'll
[56:03] still come to church I'll still come do
[56:05] those things you know I'll listen to a
[56:06] little music you know I know it's in the
[56:08] gray area and it's a little rocked up
[56:10] and it's a little Rocky and everything
[56:11] and and it's called Christian music even
[56:13] though it sounds you know if you can't
[56:15] hear the words you don't know if it's
[56:16] the number one hit in the Rock world or
[56:18] if it's a number one Christian hit you
[56:19] don't know what it is but look I'm
[56:21] telling you if you luck Devils start to
[56:22] blend lines he'll use those things to
[56:26] pull you out from behind the protection
[56:28] of the word and then all of a sudden
[56:30] you'll get that Haymaker coming you'll
[56:32] fall flat on your face and you'll say
[56:33] how did I ever get here and people go
[56:35] through a cycle over and over and over
[56:38] again I wonder is it as they ever really
[56:40] come to a place for a battle of life
[56:42] look if you've ever gotten desperation
[56:44] is there somebody here that's ever got
[56:47] into desperation where you flip over
[56:49] every leaf you flip over every rock you
[56:51] say God come into my heart search it out
[56:54] to God search me oh God try me fine if
[56:57] there's any wicked way in me Lord I Want
[56:59] to Be Right Lord I don't want to miss it
[57:01] I need more Revelation Lord I got to
[57:04] have more of you Lord if there's
[57:06] something in my life that's not pleasing
[57:08] to you Lord please reveal it because I
[57:09] want to have communion with you
[57:12] see we go through Seasons we go through
[57:14] valleys we go through look we when
[57:16] you're on the Mountaintop boy it's easy
[57:19] but when you get down into the valley
[57:22] and what did they say you know if you
[57:23] stay up on the on the Mountaintop your
[57:24] fruit are free so you got to come down
[57:25] in the valley
[57:27] really test to see what if you really
[57:29] got something
[57:31] you know because you go through the
[57:33] trials and you go through the hard times
[57:34] and if you've ever really truly battled
[57:37] it out
[57:40] let the storms come
[57:42] Let The Trials come you know where
[57:45] you're standing
[57:46] but you see when you when you've
[57:47] accepted some Creed or you've accepted
[57:49] some died or you've accepted some
[57:52] experience and it hasn't been a reality
[57:54] of a change and and you're pointing back
[57:56] to an experience but you realize you're
[57:58] still having little foxes that spoil a
[58:00] Vine you'll come up to a trial in your
[58:02] life and you'll find out you don't got
[58:03] the goods
[58:07] but don't don't let the devil continue
[58:10] for that that's the grace of God showing
[58:12] you that there's more for you
[58:15] that's what the devil wants to do he
[58:16] just wants to say oh look you fell down
[58:18] you fell to that again you went to that
[58:20] website again and you fell down and then
[58:22] what does he want to do he wants to hold
[58:24] you in a state of condemnation and keep
[58:26] you from coming back to the house of God
[58:28] look the best place you can come when
[58:30] you fall flat on your face is come back
[58:32] into the house of God say oh God feed me
[58:35] Lord Jesus Wash Me by the water of the
[58:37] word Lord I need to be cleansed I need
[58:39] to be washed Lord I need to come into
[58:41] your presence Lord build me back up Lord
[58:43] start to build me back into the statue
[58:45] of a perfect man Lord I've fallen I fail
[58:47] Lord I got iniquities I got sin but oh
[58:50] God I'm pleading the blood of Jesus
[58:51] Christ
[58:55] we got to be quick to repent
[58:58] but the devil wants to hold you there in
[59:00] a state of condemnation
[59:01] I want to keep you from coming to the
[59:03] house of God
[59:06] but we want to walk after the spirit
[59:08] we don't want to walk after the ways of
[59:10] the flesh I like this quote here this is
[59:12] what we're launching from the prophet of
[59:13] God would say this in Melchizedek the
[59:15] great king the great Prince and King he
[59:17] says wither the Forerunner now we're
[59:19] speaking of Hebrews 6 20 here he says
[59:20] wither the Forerunner for us is entered
[59:23] even Jesus
[59:25] the Forerunner of what
[59:27] so what is Jesus the Forerunner the
[59:29] Forerunner of our Salvation physically
[59:32] and spiritually for he was wounded for
[59:35] our transgressions bruised fire iniquity
[59:37] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[59:39] him and with his stripes we are healed
[59:42] the Forerunner of our Salvation has
[59:45] already entered in the Assurance already
[59:49] entered even Jesus made an high priest
[59:51] Forever After the order of Melchizedek
[59:54] now I just got a little bit excited when
[59:56] we started to Fellowship along these
[59:58] things last time when you start to look
[59:59] up in the scriptures you know that this
[1:00:01] is the only time in scripture the word
[1:00:03] Forerunner is mentioned now we know that
[1:00:05] John was a forerunner and God promised
[1:00:07] Malachi 4 to 5 to be a forerunner again
[1:00:09] before the second coming of the Lord
[1:00:11] Jesus Christ but we're just dealing with
[1:00:12] the word Forerunner would you take it
[1:00:14] back to the Greek in the scriptures it's
[1:00:16] only used one time and it's here that
[1:00:18] it's used in Hebrews 6 20 and if you
[1:00:21] look up that word you take it back to
[1:00:23] the Hebrew of the Greek whatever you
[1:00:24] take them it's only used one time and if
[1:00:26] you find another time please help me but
[1:00:28] what I found out is there's a definition
[1:00:29] on that word as a forerunner it says one
[1:00:32] who was sent before to take observation
[1:00:34] or act out as a spy or a scout boy that
[1:00:37] was enlightening to think of what God
[1:00:38] had done with those uh uh with the
[1:00:40] children of Israel when they came down
[1:00:42] to cadish barnia and it came time for
[1:00:44] them to enter into the promised land
[1:00:45] they came to a place of decision and
[1:00:47] what did the prophet do Moses he sent
[1:00:49] over 12 Spies they went over as a
[1:00:52] forerunner if you will Joshua went on
[1:00:54] over into the promised land and when
[1:00:55] they came back Joshua and Caleb gave a
[1:00:58] good report
[1:01:00] you know why because that was their land
[1:01:04] I thought about it when they came back
[1:01:06] packing all those fruits
[1:01:07] that was their fruits but those other
[1:01:10] ten spies who brought an evil report
[1:01:12] they didn't have faith to take the land
[1:01:15] so then Joshua was a forerunner that
[1:01:17] went over and said hey I want to tell
[1:01:19] you guys something it's a good land this
[1:01:22] Holy Ghost Gospel believing
[1:01:25] life this word of God this message it's
[1:01:28] a good land I'm telling you you want to
[1:01:30] come on over there well there's Giants
[1:01:32] in the land there's a lot of problems
[1:01:33] there's a lot of Heartache people have
[1:01:35] labeled that occult people have labeled
[1:01:37] that a hate message they've labeled it
[1:01:39] all these kind of things well I don't
[1:01:41] know what other people's called it but
[1:01:42] look at the grapes look at the fruit of
[1:01:45] the land look there people are being
[1:01:47] healed the dead are being raised blind
[1:01:49] eyes are being opened all the thoughts
[1:01:51] on the thoughts and the tents of the
[1:01:52] heart oh they're being discerned why
[1:01:54] don't you come on over come on over to
[1:01:56] the promised land where everybody else
[1:01:58] gave an evil report but I wonder about
[1:02:00] you when I heard the message when I
[1:02:02] heard that Scout tried to stop to tell
[1:02:04] me it was Discerning the thoughts and
[1:02:05] intents of my something inside him he
[1:02:07] said it's a good land it's a good land I
[1:02:10] want to go on over I want to take the
[1:02:12] land
[1:02:14] yeah but you find out the rest of the
[1:02:16] people didn't want to fight for it
[1:02:18] but I wonder are we willing to fight for
[1:02:20] it are you willing to fight for the
[1:02:22] message are you willing to fight for the
[1:02:24] Lord Jesus Christ are you willing to
[1:02:26] fight for your salvation are you willing
[1:02:27] to fight for your family are you willing
[1:02:29] to fight for your brothers and sisters
[1:02:30] are you willing to fight to get to the
[1:02:32] house of God
[1:02:35] you find out when you fight to get to
[1:02:37] the house of God you get a good blessing

[1:05:44] yeah by the time we get down there it
[1:05:46] looks like service is going to be close
[1:05:47] to ending
[1:05:49] so I got into church guess what there
[1:05:51] was 10 minutes left of preaching you
[1:05:53] want to know who that 10 minutes left of
[1:05:54] preaching was for
[1:05:56] I had a faith in me to believe that that
[1:05:58] 10 minutes was for me I tell you if you
[1:06:01] come with an expectation of the house of
[1:06:03] God you say oh God if I get 10 minutes
[1:06:05] that 10 minutes for me if I get 30
[1:06:07] minutes that 30 minutes with me I've
[1:06:09] come to be in the presence of God and
[1:06:10] Lord you said we're two or three you're
[1:06:12] gathered in my name you are in the midst
[1:06:14] of God take the fivefold take the pastor
[1:06:16] take the Evangelist take the men of God
[1:06:18] and speak the word to my heart I want to
[1:06:21] be in communion with you
[1:06:24] We Made It by his grace and I do it
[1:06:27] again
[1:06:28] because I want to be in the house of God
[1:06:32] if anything
[1:06:33] just to show the devil whose side I'm on
[1:06:36] I don't like to be called you know I
[1:06:39] can't I can't think of it I I try to go
[1:06:42] back and think of of the times but you
[1:06:44] know even after surgeries and certain
[1:06:46] things and some people have found me you
[1:06:47] know I I might not have been in
[1:06:49] condition to be here but I wanted to be
[1:06:50] here
[1:06:51] people are you okay I'm here I'm here
[1:06:54] might be all on something from the
[1:06:57] doctor getting out of surgery but
[1:06:58] something inside of my heart wants to be
[1:07:00] in communion something in my heart wants
[1:07:01] to be in the house of God so just
[1:07:04] fellowshipping along this lines on this
[1:07:05] Forerunner think about this now here's
[1:07:07] the definition I want to get to it says
[1:07:09] a forerunner is one who comes in advance
[1:07:11] to a place where the rest are to follow
[1:07:16] now that just makes me happy
[1:07:18] because Jesus Christ Melchizedek the
[1:07:22] Forerunner has come to a place where the
[1:07:24] rest are to follow so you know he cannot
[1:07:27] be a forerunner
[1:07:28] if nobody is coming after him
[1:07:31] that what makes him a forerunner because
[1:07:33] he's showing up to a place he's showing
[1:07:36] up to a position he's coming to a place
[1:07:38] of maturity or manifestation and he's
[1:07:41] declaring I am the Forerunner I have now
[1:07:44] come to a place and now I got a whole
[1:07:46] family that's following after me they're
[1:07:49] coming just watch out they're coming and
[1:07:51] that's what Paul would say here just
[1:07:53] moving along in the scriptures think
[1:07:54] about this now Romans 8 29 I know we're
[1:07:56] familiar with it but he says for whom he
[1:07:58] did for no he also did predestinate to
[1:08:01] be conformed to the image of his son
[1:08:03] that he might be the firstborn
[1:08:06] among many Brethren now he's the
[1:08:08] firstborn among many Brethren because he
[1:08:11] foreknew you because he predestinated
[1:08:13] you to become the same thing that he is
[1:08:16] to be conformed to the image of Jesus
[1:08:19] Christ the Forerunner the first fruits
[1:08:22] of them that slept
[1:08:24] what does the scripture go on to say
[1:08:26] moreover whom he did predestinate
[1:08:29] them he also called and whom he called
[1:08:32] them he also justified in whom he
[1:08:34] justified them he also glorified look
[1:08:36] the Forerunner of our salvation
[1:08:39] physically
[1:08:41] and spiritually this isn't Up For Debate
[1:08:46] this isn't a question uh am I gonna make
[1:08:49] it this isn't a question well he
[1:08:51] justified me will my life ever become
[1:08:54] Satan no he's the Forerunner he made the
[1:08:57] way for you he he purchased your
[1:09:00] salvation he foreknew you and he
[1:09:02] predestinated you and those he foreknew
[1:09:05] he called you he Sanctified you he
[1:09:07] justified you and he said and I have
[1:09:09] already glorified them this ain't Up For
[1:09:12] Debate you're not sitting around and
[1:09:14] wondering am I ever going to make it I
[1:09:15] think I can I think I can look you ain't
[1:09:17] The Little Engine That Could
[1:09:19] I think I can I think I can I think no I
[1:09:21] just can't do I think I can I think I
[1:09:23] can and you're just thinking you can do
[1:09:25] it no this goes Way Beyond some mental
[1:09:28] conception this goes beyond something
[1:09:30] that you could think of this comes
[1:09:32] Beyond something that you can try to
[1:09:33] Manifest this is something the
[1:09:35] Forerunner Melchizedek Jesus Christ has
[1:09:38] already entered in he's already made a
[1:09:40] way for you he's predestinated you he
[1:09:43] Sanctified you he's Justified you he's
[1:09:45] already glorified you it's not up to
[1:09:48] debate this is something that God has
[1:09:50] already done
[1:09:53] yeah we'll just whip the devil with that
[1:09:56] thing
[1:09:58] come on I'm tired I'm tired of the devil
[1:10:00] trying to rob us of our joy trying to
[1:10:03] rob us of our peace trying to rob us of
[1:10:06] the gifts of God in our land I'm tired
[1:10:08] of the devil trying to tell me I'm not
[1:10:10] gonna I'm tired of the devil trying to
[1:10:12] point out my pet I'm tired of the devil
[1:10:14] trying to take my joy I'm tired of them
[1:10:16] trying to take my victory
[1:10:19] well then why don't you do something
[1:10:21] about it God's already done everything
[1:10:23] he's ever going to do for you all he
[1:10:25] wants to do is get a son or daughter of
[1:10:27] God to believe in what he did
[1:10:29] believe in what he said if you just
[1:10:30] start believing what he said about you
[1:10:34] this ain't the words of a man
[1:10:38] this is what God said about you
[1:10:41] and then we let the devil just whip us
[1:10:43] up with passion failures and faults and
[1:10:46] what happened yesterday and how you ever
[1:10:48] going to get through this trial and and
[1:10:50] the reason your family's battling this
[1:10:51] sickness is because there's sin in your
[1:10:53] life and he starts to put little lies
[1:10:55] into your heart and say well the people
[1:10:56] in the church they're looking at you a
[1:10:58] little funny and they think it's because
[1:10:59] the way you handled this and it's the
[1:11:01] way you did that and you know that
[1:11:03] that's that's the way that's the reason
[1:11:05] why your your life is the way it is is
[1:11:07] because you're suffering for your
[1:11:09] iniquities oh the devil shrewd
[1:11:12] if he could ever accomplish anything he
[1:11:14] would want to cause division in this
[1:11:16] church
[1:11:18] he would try to pitch you against the
[1:11:20] pastor he'd try to pitch you against
[1:11:21] your brother he'd want the so little
[1:11:23] some little white liar or or I you know
[1:11:26] it sounds funny but you know people are
[1:11:28] offended over hands not getting shook
[1:11:31] they get offended over where they're sat
[1:11:33] in the church
[1:11:34] they get offended over parking spots
[1:11:36] they get offended over not being invited
[1:11:38] over for dinner they get offended over
[1:11:40] everything now I'm not trying to
[1:11:42] belittle that because people have really
[1:11:45] gone through battles and heartaches
[1:11:47] because of those things and I'm just
[1:11:49] trying to say that the devil would want
[1:11:51] to use that to cause a division but I
[1:11:54] tell you we ought to look around and we
[1:11:56] ought to show the Christian character of
[1:11:58] love and look out and extend the hand of
[1:12:00] fellowship if you notice somebody ain't
[1:12:02] befriending you like they used to why
[1:12:04] don't you go up to say hey I just wanted
[1:12:06] to make sure is there something that
[1:12:07] I've done to offend you and if there is
[1:12:09] I want to make it right
[1:12:12] or are we too prideful are we too scared
[1:12:15] to go on that auction how many times has
[1:12:18] God put an unction on your heart to make
[1:12:20] a phone call or go up to somebody and
[1:12:22] you shun the holy unction and come down
[1:12:24] the road later and you find out you wish
[1:12:26] you'd have been obedient to that only
[1:12:28] option the first time now I want to be a
[1:12:30] mature church I want to be a mature Son
[1:12:32] of God I want to be a church that comes
[1:12:34] together in unity and we put out all the
[1:12:37] nonsense that we can come together and
[1:12:38] be United for a rapture
[1:12:42] he's made a way
[1:12:44] he's made a way for us
[1:12:48] just thinking along those lines look
[1:12:50] Moses Moses didn't think he could do it
[1:12:55] but I love that sermon perfect strength
[1:12:57] and perfect weakness
[1:12:59] God told Moses look at Moses I don't
[1:13:01] need your excuses
[1:13:03] and I don't need your abilities
[1:13:06] yeah he hit it from both sides
[1:13:09] Moses when you try with your abilities
[1:13:10] you produce a dead Egyptian
[1:13:13] when you try with all your intellect and
[1:13:15] all your doctrines and all your methods
[1:13:17] and you just thought you were going to
[1:13:18] be able to bring the plan of God into
[1:13:19] manifestation on your own without
[1:13:21] consulting me and you just thought you'd
[1:13:23] rise up to nope that's not how it works
[1:13:25] I'll take you out on the back side of
[1:13:27] the desert and it lets you get to a
[1:13:30] place where I've taken all of your
[1:13:32] intellectual knowledge out I've taken
[1:13:34] away your human ability all your
[1:13:36] strength and all your I think I can I
[1:13:39] think I can he'll take it all out and
[1:13:41] get you to a place where you're hurting
[1:13:42] sheep on the back side of the desert and
[1:13:44] all of a sudden you'll something will
[1:13:46] catch your attention
[1:13:48] and you get something in your heart
[1:13:49] you've been looking for something all
[1:13:51] your life
[1:13:53] and all of a sudden you come in the
[1:13:55] presence of something what is it Moses
[1:13:57] what is it it's God calling your name
[1:13:59] it's God calling you and they say look
[1:14:01] Moses you can't do it on your own yes
[1:14:03] you were born a proper child yes you are
[1:14:06] a deliverer but you're not going to
[1:14:08] serve me with your strength you're not
[1:14:09] going to serve me with your intellect
[1:14:11] you're not going to serve me with your
[1:14:13] ability you're going to serve me based
[1:14:14] upon my word
[1:14:17] oh I'm happy for it
[1:14:19] I'm I I I I've made a way for you Moses
[1:14:22] I am the I am
[1:14:25] take off your shoes where you're
[1:14:26] standing Holy Ground Moses
[1:14:28] oh but God
[1:14:30] I I I can't go down there and deliver
[1:14:32] the children of Israel
[1:14:34] I'm past my Prime
[1:14:38] I'm past any abilities I I forgot all of
[1:14:40] our war plans I forgot all the gates of
[1:14:43] the city I forgot where they kept the
[1:14:45] secret weapons my mind's failing me now
[1:14:47] I can't even re-quote the Bible I can't
[1:14:49] uh pull scriptures like I used to pull
[1:14:51] them I can't pull quotes and Page books
[1:14:53] uh like that Moses I don't need that
[1:14:57] I don't need your eye I can't speak it
[1:14:59] right I stutter when I talk Moses I
[1:15:01] don't I don't need your excuses
[1:15:03] I don't need your excuses and I don't
[1:15:05] need your abilities
[1:15:07] all I need you to do is take me at my
[1:15:11] word
[1:15:12] so here comes a man down to Egypt and I
[1:15:16] tell you what oh we've heard it
[1:15:17] dramatized several times Here Comes This
[1:15:19] old man with hair down to his waist with
[1:15:21] a stick riding on a donkey Here Comes
[1:15:23] his wife he's coming down to the most
[1:15:25] Mighty greatest nation on the face of
[1:15:27] the Earth and he's going to come up to
[1:15:29] pharaoh and say let my people go
[1:15:32] well we know one spear one bow and arrow
[1:15:36] one hammer would have just ended that
[1:15:38] whole thing
[1:15:40] intellectually
[1:15:44] but Moses had the saith the Lord
[1:15:47] that means nothing
[1:15:50] nothing
[1:15:51] could stop Moses from coming back to
[1:15:53] that mountain because look he said you
[1:15:56] will worship me back here at this
[1:15:57] mountain so Moses knew if God told me
[1:16:00] that he predested me if God told me he
[1:16:02] Sanctified my life if God glorify me
[1:16:05] then there's nothing that's going to
[1:16:06] stop me from entering in will
[1:16:08] Melchizedek has already gone where the
[1:16:10] Forerunner has already entered then I
[1:16:13] have to come with him
[1:16:16] Moses knew I'm going back there
[1:16:20] John 15 16 says you have not chosen me
[1:16:22] but I have chosen you and ordained you
[1:16:24] that you should
[1:16:26] go and bring forth fruit
[1:16:28] and that your fruit should remain
[1:16:31] that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
[1:16:33] father in my name he will give it to you
[1:16:39] ye have not chosen me but I've chosen
[1:16:41] you

[1:18:20] we spoke about the woman at the well
[1:18:24] her situation was unfixable
[1:18:27] an unfixable situation
[1:18:30] where there was no way
[1:18:33] Jesus Christ Made A Way
[1:18:36] where there was no way no man no Priest
[1:18:40] No Church no Doctrine no Creed no doctor
[1:18:44] nobody on the face of the planet could
[1:18:47] have fixed the woman at the Wells
[1:18:48] condition she was an outcast she
[1:18:51] couldn't even have fellowship with the
[1:18:52] people in the town because of the way
[1:18:54] she lived but there came a man one day
[1:18:57] he come on down to the well said give me
[1:19:00] a drink
[1:19:01] oh you know it's not customary for you
[1:19:03] to talk to me at somebody else oh if you
[1:19:05] knew if you knew who you were talking to
[1:19:07] you would ask me for a drink because
[1:19:09] guys I'll give you a Living Waters
[1:19:11] you'll never thirst it again don't give
[1:19:13] me them Waters
[1:19:15] that's what happened just like Moses on
[1:19:18] the backside of the desert he came into
[1:19:19] the presence of the I am what did that
[1:19:22] what did that woman at the well did she
[1:19:24] came in the presence of the I am who was
[1:19:27] it it was Melchizedek the same one that
[1:19:29] Abraham came into the presence of oh my
[1:19:32] god with Abraham when it came time they
[1:19:34] were well stricken in age there was no
[1:19:36] way for them to bring forth the promise
[1:19:38] who came to the tindor
[1:19:41] Melchizedek came to the tent door and
[1:19:43] what did he say oh Abraham where is your
[1:19:46] wife
[1:19:47] wasn't even looking for Abraham
[1:19:49] why because it's time now according to
[1:19:52] the appointed time you're going to have
[1:19:54] that promise that I gave you
[1:19:57] what was it it was Melchizedek he's the
[1:19:59] Waymaker he spoke a word in that word
[1:20:02] has to come into manifestation
[1:20:05] well why don't we talk about faith a
[1:20:06] little bit
[1:20:07] you got a little bit of faith
[1:20:10] you got a little bit of faith for
[1:20:11] salvation
[1:20:13] why don't you take all the word take all
[1:20:15] the promises of God
[1:20:17] prophet of God would say this and who's
[1:20:19] this Melchizedek God vindicates that
[1:20:21] that's always been right God vindicates
[1:20:23] it to be true so plainly the
[1:20:25] predestinated is the only one that's
[1:20:27] considered in Redemption
[1:20:29] now we're talking about where you came
[1:20:30] from
[1:20:32] we're talking about that you're
[1:20:33] predestinated
[1:20:36] you're talking about you've been
[1:20:37] ordained
[1:20:39] God vindicates it to be true so plainly
[1:20:41] the predestinated is the only one
[1:20:45] that's considered in Redemption
[1:20:49] did you get it
[1:20:50] let me say that again
[1:20:53] the predestinated
[1:20:55] is the only one that's considered in
[1:20:57] Redemption
[1:20:58] people might be making like they think
[1:21:00] they are
[1:21:01] but the real Redemption is those that
[1:21:05] are predestinated because the very word
[1:21:08] redeem means to bring back
[1:21:12] now I take that Faith we're talking
[1:21:14] about and believe this for yourself
[1:21:17] Devil's gonna try to rob you right here
[1:21:19] you tell that Old Devil to shut up
[1:21:21] you're predestinated
[1:21:24] you are Redemption
[1:21:28] people might be like uh like think they
[1:21:32] are but real Redemption is those
[1:21:34] that are predestinated because the very
[1:21:36] word redeem means to bring back is that
[1:21:38] right
[1:21:39] the redeem is sent to redeem anything
[1:21:43] is bring it back to its original place
[1:21:46] the prophet says hallelujah
[1:21:49] Hallelujah
[1:21:51] hey he's talking about me you're telling
[1:21:54] me Prophet when I showed up here
[1:21:57] and this sinful flesh that this wasn't
[1:22:00] my first existence no
[1:22:04] it's to bring to its original Place
[1:22:05] Hallelujah so it's only the
[1:22:07] predestinated that will be brought back
[1:22:10] because the others didn't come from
[1:22:12] there
[1:22:15] see bring back be an eternal with him at
[1:22:18] the beginning the eternal life that you
[1:22:20] had
[1:22:21] his thoughts of you was only he he
[1:22:24] wanted me to stand listen to this now
[1:22:28] I can't do it justice but why don't you
[1:22:30] grab a hold of it
[1:22:31] being Eternal with him at the beginning
[1:22:33] the eternal life that you had his
[1:22:36] thought of what you was only he wanted
[1:22:38] you to he wanted me to stand in the
[1:22:42] Pulpit say he wanted you to sit in the
[1:22:45] seat tonight

[1:22:50] and the one that left home only come to
[1:22:54] the Earth to serve his purpose is that
[1:22:57] right all right then after it's finished
[1:22:59] it's brought back in a glorified State
[1:23:02] it's matured and brought back again
[1:23:07] don't you realize that you are the
[1:23:09] spoken word seed of God that has stepped
[1:23:12] out of Eternity you've been sold into
[1:23:15] lady osia that you might come through a
[1:23:18] maturing process and go right back to
[1:23:20] where you came from oh that's Redemption
[1:23:23] Hallelujah that's why I get excited I've
[1:23:26] been predestinated Redemption means to

[1:24:37] prudent revealed and debate such as

[1:25:42] presence of the sun it's ripening me

[1:25:52] of an eye I'm gonna be gone all your
[1:25:55] trials will be over all your heartache
[1:25:57] will be over all you're wondering and

[1:26:29] I am redeemed what are you talking about
[1:26:32] well redeemed means to be brought back

[1:26:36] predestinated to me it's you be you're
[1:26:37] redeemed and redeemed means he's taken
[1:26:40] me back to Eternity where I was with him
[1:26:42] in the beginning well friend that sounds
[1:26:44] fanatical yep Hallelujah
[1:26:46] Hallelujah I know it sounds fanatical
[1:26:48] you know Moses looked pretty fanatical
[1:26:52] there was ever a nut on the earth it was
[1:26:54] Moses
[1:26:57] you imagine you imagine
[1:26:59] going up to the White House and knocking
[1:27:01] on the doors
[1:27:02] said I'm going to be president
[1:27:05] foreign
[1:27:06] you'd be talking to four walls three
[1:27:08] walls and a jail cell
[1:27:12] but if he had thus saith the Lord
[1:27:15] be nothing this government could do to
[1:27:17] stop you and I tell you it's time
[1:27:20] for the Bride of Jesus Christ to
[1:27:22] recognize when what Christ has done in
[1:27:25] this generation just as the logos out of
[1:27:29] that burning bush spoke to Moses God
[1:27:31] took that vessel and he apprehended that
[1:27:34] vessel and he put his words and that
[1:27:36] vessel to speak his word to the people
[1:27:38] that is none other than what we have
[1:27:40] received in this generation my Divine
[1:27:42] promise God said as it was in the days
[1:27:44] of Noah so shall it be in the revealing
[1:27:46] of the son of man that God would send a
[1:27:48] prophet like in the Moses that would
[1:27:51] come and discern the thoughts and
[1:27:52] intents of the heart
[1:27:54] who is this Melchizedek
[1:27:58] the prophet of God would say this
[1:28:00] speaking of that Dew Drop he said and
[1:28:02] that's the way with a Christian
[1:28:03] Hallelujah we know when we walk into the
[1:28:06] presence of God something in US tells us
[1:28:09] that we come from somewhere and we're
[1:28:11] going back again by the power that's
[1:28:14] pulling us
[1:28:15] look there's a power pulling you
[1:28:17] you might not know it but there's a
[1:28:19] power on your life
[1:28:20] you should have been dead you shouldn't
[1:28:22] be here you should have been gone a long
[1:28:25] time ago but something's keeping you
[1:28:26] something's holding you something's
[1:28:28] pulling you when the devil wanted to
[1:28:30] Snuff you out when drugs wanted to take
[1:28:32] you out with that life you were living
[1:28:34] want to take you out when you almost got
[1:28:36] killed on the job and it was going to
[1:28:38] take you out there was a power over your
[1:28:39] life there was something pulling you in
[1:28:41] the manifestation that said look I'm not
[1:28:43] done with them I got a result I'm
[1:28:45] looking for I'm going to keep them from
[1:28:46] this I'm going to keep them from that
[1:28:48] why because I want to see my very image
[1:28:50] inside of him and when he serves his
[1:28:52] purpose then I'll take him home
[1:28:54] something is pulling you
[1:28:58] well you might as well just surrender to
[1:29:00] it
[1:29:01] maybe that's the problem with somebody
[1:29:03] here
[1:29:04] you wonder what's wrong with your life
[1:29:07] is you have not fully surrendered to the
[1:29:09] power of God that's been pulling on your
[1:29:11] heart you've never come to a complete
[1:29:13] surrender you've come around the message
[1:29:15] you've come around the things of the
[1:29:17] message something your heart knows it's
[1:29:18] right but you got one foot in and one
[1:29:20] foot out it's time look at the time it's
[1:29:22] over
[1:29:23] the time of playing church is over
[1:29:26] we're on the ark and we're preaching
[1:29:28] through the window
[1:29:29] I believe the door's open
[1:29:32] look we're in the third pool now
[1:29:35] the third pull is what to the eternally
[1:29:37] lost
[1:29:39] and to the bride
[1:29:40] we've come into the third pool we've
[1:29:43] entered into the eye but we're preaching
[1:29:44] to souls
[1:29:46] that are eternally lost but I praise God
[1:29:48] the door's still open
[1:29:51] but it could be tonight it could be
[1:29:54] tomorrow
[1:29:55] well it's this time to have a battle of
[1:29:57] life
[1:29:58] it's time to battle it out if you got
[1:29:59] loved ones get them in
[1:30:06] get them in
[1:30:09] think about Rahab
[1:30:11] get them in get them in under the token
[1:30:13] get them under and under this word
[1:30:18] I don't know if I finished that quote
[1:30:20] there's a power of God that's pulling us
[1:30:23] the little Dew Drop he glistens and
[1:30:25] shines and shouts because he knows he
[1:30:28] come from up there and that son is going
[1:30:30] to draw him right back up again and a
[1:30:32] man that's an attribute of God born of
[1:30:35] God knows Hallelujah when he come in
[1:30:37] contact with the Son of God he is going
[1:30:40] to be drawn up from yet from here
[1:30:41] someday for if I be lifted up from the
[1:30:44] earth I will draw all men unto me amen
[1:30:48] oh what shall we say to these things
[1:30:51] if God before us
[1:30:54] what shall we say if he's predestinated
[1:30:56] you come on now
[1:30:58] if he's done all these things what shall
[1:31:00] we say to these things if God before you
[1:31:03] then who can be against you nothing can
[1:31:06] stop you nothing can pluck you out of
[1:31:08] his hand all the father has given me
[1:31:10] will come
[1:31:11] I was thinking about that you know you
[1:31:13] start to think about the the uh
[1:31:15] Patriarchs
[1:31:17] in the Bible
[1:31:20] Abraham no chance Sarah no chance Moses
[1:31:25] no chance
[1:31:27] they had received a promise that in
[1:31:28] themselves could never manifest
[1:31:32] but was it by faith
[1:31:34] by faith
[1:31:36] by faith
[1:31:38] by faith Abraham by faith Sarah by faith
[1:31:42] Moses by faith Enoch by faith Abel
[1:31:46] by faith Joshua by faith well you know
[1:31:49] how you're going to do it
[1:31:51] by faith by faith and then how does
[1:31:54] faith come
[1:31:56] faith comes by hearing the word so then
[1:31:59] God had to send a word to produce the
[1:32:02] faith to make you an overcomer and the
[1:32:05] prophet of God said it takes a perfect
[1:32:06] Faith or more faith than we've had in
[1:32:08] any other age to go into a Rapture then
[1:32:10] he had to send a word that would produce
[1:32:12] rapturing faith and that's what we're
[1:32:14] feeding on we're feeding on a word
[1:32:16] that's producing a faith to change our
[1:32:18] bodies
[1:32:19] it looks impossible
[1:32:22] Sarah it looks impossible Abraham it
[1:32:26] looks impossible Moses it looks
[1:32:28] impossible but by faith I have heard
[1:32:31] from Melchizedek has given me a promise
[1:32:34] it said according to the time of life
[1:32:35] you shall have a body change Oh Glory to
[1:32:39] God I'm glad I'm caught right now in the
[1:32:41] Rapture cycle of the change of my body
[1:32:44] you say brother Matthew I can't see
[1:32:45] anything no well Melchizedek he is the
[1:32:48] Forerunner of me both spiritually and
[1:32:50] physically and I tell you right now
[1:32:52] glory to God spiritually I'm seated in
[1:32:55] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh we
[1:32:58] are bone of his bone and flesh of his
[1:33:00] flesh we are a life of his life and
[1:33:02] power of his power and soon and very
[1:33:04] soon this whole body this flesh body
[1:33:07] that my Forerunner was a forerunner for
[1:33:09] both physically and spiritually for my
[1:33:12] healing and for Divine Healing which
[1:33:13] Divine Healing is just a type of our
[1:33:15] body change and soon and very soon we're
[1:33:17] going to be changed
[1:33:19] Oh Glory to God it might sound like a
[1:33:22] mystery it might sound like a fairy tale
[1:33:24] but by faith
[1:33:26] I know that I know because it's the
[1:33:29] Sixth Sense
[1:33:30] it defies the natural senses it defies
[1:33:33] what I can see touch tasty or smell it
[1:33:35] defies my reason conscious memory
[1:33:37] affection
[1:33:38] it defies all those things because faith
[1:33:41] is more real than the reality you're
[1:33:43] looking at with your very own eyes you
[1:33:45] say what are you talking about look at
[1:33:46] Moses
[1:33:48] it made no sense for him to go down to
[1:33:51] Egypt
[1:33:52] but God had ordained him to do it and
[1:33:55] God has ordained a pride in the evening
[1:33:57] time to go into rapture
[1:34:02] wherefore sin we are compassionate about
[1:34:04] with such a great cloud of witness
[1:34:07] let us lay aside
[1:34:09] every weight
[1:34:11] we'll try to work towards her clothes
[1:34:12] I'll just ask
[1:34:15] maybe we can sing that song again if
[1:34:16] Brother Joseph can come to the piano and
[1:34:19] I'll call for the singers here in just a
[1:34:21] moment
[1:34:25] wherefore seeing we are also compassed
[1:34:27] with such a greater cloud of witness let
[1:34:29] us lay aside every weight
[1:34:33] church is time to lay aside every weight
[1:34:36] it's time to lay aside your complexes
[1:34:37] time to lay aside your doubt time to lay
[1:34:41] aside your unbelief
[1:34:42] I tell you one person you want to want
[1:34:44] somebody I'm I'm really lately I've
[1:34:46] gotten a little tired with I'm gonna
[1:34:48] call his name out
[1:34:50] his name is Mr skeptic
[1:34:53] I really don't like that guy
[1:34:56] because he's skeptical of every promise
[1:34:59] of God he's skeptical of the message
[1:35:01] when the man of God gets up and preaches
[1:35:04] you know the message you know there's
[1:35:06] there's a preacher gives his title and
[1:35:08] he he starts to bring it well either
[1:35:10] this is ordained of God or it's not
[1:35:12] either the fightful ministry is of God
[1:35:14] or or it's not you know that Mr skeptic
[1:35:17] wants to sit there well you know I mean
[1:35:18] it's really it really not about that
[1:35:20] that's not the way it is and he starts
[1:35:22] to run his mouth you know why don't you
[1:35:23] give all Mr skeptic the word test when
[1:35:26] people try to speak against the world
[1:35:27] why do you give it the Bible test give
[1:35:29] it the word test say okay let me take it
[1:35:31] back and see what the word says it says
[1:35:32] oh therefore is there now no
[1:35:34] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:35:36] Jesus blessed is the man whom the Lord
[1:35:39] will not impute sin he who is born of
[1:35:41] God cannot commit sin because the seed
[1:35:43] remaineth in him whose seed is it it
[1:35:46] ain't your seed it's a predestinated
[1:35:48] seed that God placed inside of you
[1:35:50] because you're part of redemption and
[1:35:52] Redemption means to bring back to where
[1:35:54] you were in the first place Glory to God
[1:35:57] why don't you shut yourself your mouth
[1:35:59] Mr skeptic I am the redeemed purchase
[1:36:01] bride of Jesus Christ I am going back to
[1:36:04] where I came from I am part of the
[1:36:06] Redemption story he shed his blood for
[1:36:08] me on calorie he prayed us today to me
[1:36:10] he placed his seed inside of me and soon
[1:36:12] and very soon I'm gonna be gone
[1:36:15] why don't we lay aside every weight that
[1:36:17] so easily besets us and the sin
[1:36:21] which does so easily beset us and let us
[1:36:23] run with patience the race
[1:36:25] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[1:36:28] the author and finisher of our faith
[1:36:30] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:36:33] endured the cross
[1:36:35] what a forerunner
[1:36:40] despising the shame and is set down on
[1:36:43] the right hand of God on the right hand
[1:36:45] of the Throne of God
[1:36:47] looking under Jesus
[1:36:51] what does it say looking unto Jesus
[1:36:54] the author
[1:36:56] and finisher
[1:37:00] of our faith
[1:37:03] so then if it was by faith
[1:37:06] Enoch walked with God and was not
[1:37:09] who authored that story
[1:37:12] well I'm about to get excited
[1:37:14] who authored that story
[1:37:16] Enoch didn't author that story
[1:37:19] you think Moses sat around one day and
[1:37:21] drafted up that story
[1:37:23] that wasn't Moses's idea Abraham wasn't
[1:37:26] sitting around one day and he wrote a
[1:37:28] pretty little story today Sarah what do
[1:37:30] you think about this we're going to get
[1:37:31] really old and stricken in age
[1:37:35] no that was God's story
[1:37:37] that was what God wanted to bring forth
[1:37:39] God was the author of that story but I
[1:37:42] want to tell you he is the finisher I
[1:37:44] want to tell you church God is going to
[1:37:46] finish what he started you might feel
[1:37:48] like you ain't going to finish but you
[1:37:49] ordained to finish this thing why
[1:37:51] because he's the author and he's the
[1:37:53] finisher he who begun the good work in
[1:37:55] you he is faithful he will finish it why
[1:37:58] because he's not only the author of your
[1:38:00] life glory to God he is the finisher of
[1:38:03] your life he's the author and finisher
[1:38:05] of your faith and faith is a gift of God
[1:38:07] lest any man should boast oh my if you
[1:38:10] got faith on the inside of you you got a
[1:38:13] pile of God
[1:38:16] praise His wonderful name
[1:38:18] he's the one that started this
[1:38:21] is the one that's the same one come on
[1:38:24] the same one who offered Moses story The
[1:38:28] I am he said I started it Moses I'm
[1:38:30] going to bring you out of Egypt I told
[1:38:32] Abraham I told him I'd bring him out
[1:38:34] what did he do he got him to the Red Sea
[1:38:37] everybody started crying
[1:38:40] is that what we do we come to an
[1:38:42] obstacle we come to a place in our life
[1:38:44] we come to a trial we come to a
[1:38:46] situation it seems like there's no way
[1:38:48] out it seems like there's no way around
[1:38:50] it and what do we do do we start to
[1:38:52] murmur and complain and say oh God what
[1:38:54] did you do did you bring us out here in
[1:38:55] the wilderness to die would it have been
[1:38:57] better for us to stay back and Egypt
[1:38:59] would have been better to stay back in
[1:39:01] the Sin of our flesh would have been
[1:39:02] better to stay back in denominations
[1:39:04] no who brought you to the Red Sea who
[1:39:07] brought you out of Egypt well the same
[1:39:09] one that brought you out of Egypt is the
[1:39:10] same one that brings you to the Red Sea
[1:39:12] who is it that feeds you a man in the
[1:39:15] wilderness who is the water from the
[1:39:16] rock who is the one that brings you
[1:39:18] across Jordan it's the author and the
[1:39:20] finisher of your faith the one that
[1:39:22] started it he will finish it
[1:39:24] but that's his wonderful name for if you
[1:39:26] can start playing that brother
[1:39:29] clever if you could come help me and
[1:39:31] Brianna
[1:39:36] I am the one that called you
[1:39:39] I am the one that elected you
[1:39:42] you didn't choose me
[1:39:45] I chose you
[1:39:50] no doubt Abraham and Sarah were
[1:39:52] wondering
[1:39:56] Lord when's the promise ever going to
[1:39:57] come to pass Lord
[1:40:03] I believe
[1:40:06] you gave me a promise Lord
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:09] I believe
[1:40:11] I don't need to go through prayer lines
[1:40:12] anymore
[1:40:14] I don't even need to have hands laid on
[1:40:16] me anymore
[1:40:19] because I've received your promise
[1:40:21] and I know beyond a shadow of an out God
[1:40:27] you gave me the promise but Lord
[1:40:30] when are these things gonna be
[1:40:33] and all of a sudden that same one that
[1:40:35] served
[1:40:37] Abraham
[1:40:39] Bread and Wine
[1:40:41] after the battle
[1:40:43] showed up there at the tent door
[1:40:47] there he is Sarah that's him
[1:40:49] come down
[1:40:52] started to worship Him called him Lord
[1:40:57] so where's your wife
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:00] I made you a promise Abraham
[1:41:03] and I intend to keep it
[1:41:07] and even while Sarah
[1:41:09] was in a condition
[1:41:12] to not believe
[1:41:13] it didn't change what God had promised
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:17] oh
[1:41:19] how was it in the condition to believe
[1:41:20] this message
[1:41:29] I wasn't in a condition
[1:41:32] to come into His presence
[1:41:37] I wasn't a good candidate
[1:41:39] to preach the gospel
[1:41:44] but what I was yet in sin
[1:41:48] Christ died for me
[1:41:51] because it wasn't about what I could do
[1:41:55] it was all about what he had done
[1:42:00] and if I could just now look at my
[1:42:02] problems and look at my past and realize
[1:42:05] Melchizedek has come in the evening time
[1:42:10] then where is my bride
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:14] I don't care about your past
[1:42:17] I don't care about your family situation
[1:42:20] [Music]
[1:42:23] according to the time of life
[1:42:27] you're going to bring forth the promised
[1:42:29] son
[1:42:31] and even though Sarah laughed
[1:42:34] and said how could these things be
[1:42:38] she was predestinated
[1:42:40] [Music]
[1:42:42] and the scripture would say by faith
[1:42:46] Sarah
[1:42:47] receive strength
[1:42:49] to conceive
[1:42:52] God has sent a word
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:42:56] to produce a faith for you to conceive
[1:42:58] the message of the hour
[1:43:00] and bring forth the full manifestation
[1:43:02] of the word
[1:43:03] all the way through the Rapture cycle
[1:43:05] until we behold
[1:43:07] him in the meeting of the air
[1:43:10] well it sounds crazy brother Matthew
[1:43:14] it sounded crazy that an old man and an
[1:43:16] old woman's body would be changed to
[1:43:19] bring forth the promised son
[1:43:20] it sounded crazy for an old man to go
[1:43:23] lead a people out of Egypt
[1:43:26] the Bible's all written about crazy
[1:43:28] people I
[1:43:30] saw a crazy little group like us
[1:43:33] could see a pattern in the word of God
[1:43:35] and say if he did it for them
[1:43:38] Allelujah if he did it for Abraham he
[1:43:42] could do it for me if he did it for
[1:43:44] Sarah he can do it for me if he did it
[1:43:47] for shamgar he could do it for me if he
[1:43:49] did it for Rahab he could do it for me
[1:43:51] if he did it for Moses he could do it
[1:43:53] for me if he did it for Peter he could
[1:43:55] do it for me if he did it for Paul he
[1:43:57] could do it for me if he did it for
[1:43:58] Daniel he can do it for me if he did it
[1:44:00] for Sean Rock Me shot gonna Bendigo he
[1:44:03] can do it for me he is the fourth man in
[1:44:06] the fire he is Melchizedek he is your
[1:44:09] Forerunner he is the Waymaker he is the

[2:02:31] he's such a
[2:02:32] wonderful God
[2:02:36] I think there's a great
[2:02:40] desire in God's heart
[2:02:43] for his people
[2:02:46] and that's why there's such a cry for
[2:02:50] the church to get their lives right and
[2:02:53] to take on the
[2:02:56] the position
[2:02:59] and the promises that
[2:03:01] God has given them
[2:03:05] because there's promise to work
[2:03:08] that there would be a short quick
[2:03:11] powerful work
[2:03:13] in the hearts and the lives of
[2:03:18] God's elect
[2:03:22] and there's no other voice to this
[2:03:25] generation left but your voice
[2:03:29] there's no other light to this
[2:03:31] generation but your light
[2:03:33] [Music]
[2:03:37] how to experience today that
[2:03:43] move me deep inside
[2:03:47] started out this morning with a phone
[2:03:49] call
[2:03:57] from a
[2:03:59] woman that's got to go to
[2:04:03] Court
[2:04:06] and address
[2:04:10] the court in the sentencing
[2:04:16] of the person that
[2:04:19] murdered her daughter
[2:04:24] [Music]
[2:04:29] that I
[2:04:32] I want to forgive them
[2:04:36] but I don't know how
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:42] and I thought as Matthew preached
[2:04:45] tonight
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:51] it's all her heart's desire is
[2:04:54] foreign
[2:04:57] she's come back to God through it all
[2:05:02] that stuck with me in my heart and I
[2:05:04] went by
[2:05:05] [Music]
[2:05:08] to brother
[2:05:09] Tim seather's work today and he began to
[2:05:12] talk to me about the
[2:05:14] that work that the bride was gonna do
[2:05:19] how he said it wouldn't be a public show
[2:05:23] it would be something that just come out
[2:05:26] from the hearts of the believer
[2:05:30] I meditated it
[2:05:34] I walked in just sitting in the yard
[2:05:37] today and
[2:05:40] I just felt compelled to drive to this
[2:05:44] supply house and
[2:05:45] buy some
[2:05:48] hoses
[2:05:51] I I mean I it was absolutely like
[2:05:55] really
[2:05:57] I don't need houses go to this place and
[2:06:00] buy this hoses
[2:06:02] I got in there and ordered my hoses and
[2:06:06] I was ready to take them out and one of
[2:06:09] the guys that are there that works there
[2:06:11] said can I carry these hoses out
[2:06:17] to the
[2:06:18] truck for you and I thought well yeah
[2:06:20] that's nice
[2:06:23] I walked out there and he turned to me
[2:06:27] this is a worldly guy
[2:06:31] and he says do you give any counseling
[2:06:36] begin to talk to the man about his life
[2:06:40] and never before Did It Strike me
[2:06:44] how needy this world is
[2:06:52] I mean the guy's sitting there
[2:06:55] tears running down his face and
[2:07:03] he said I he needs God I need God he
[2:07:06] said
[2:07:08] he said I've quit drinking for three
[2:07:11] weeks now
[2:07:13] so that ain't very long
[2:07:17] but I'd never seen someone just so
[2:07:19] hungry
[2:07:21] and so lost
[2:07:24] and and
[2:07:27] we've got to get past where we're always
[2:07:30] the ones running to the altar
[2:07:33] you don't understand we've got to settle
[2:07:36] these issues
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:39] got to come to the place like Matthew
[2:07:42] said tonight
[2:07:43] we have a purpose
[2:07:45] we have a work to do and it's not for
[2:07:49] each other
[2:07:51] it's for this world out there
[2:07:55] if we could take that power in each of
[2:07:58] our hearts
[2:07:59] that man has got such a burden on my
[2:08:02] heart and of course I invited him to the
[2:08:04] house of God
[2:08:06] but he needs God
[2:08:08] he needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:08:11] he needs the cleansing power
[2:08:14] of our God
[2:08:17] and you're the possessors
[2:08:20] The Works that I do
[2:08:23] shall you do also and Greater Works than
