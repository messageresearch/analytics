[12:25] good morning this morning just welcome
[12:27] to the house of the Lord
[12:30] and today's a a Sunday school service
[12:33] and it's our way of letting our children
[12:37] know that we care for them and that the
[12:40] Lord cares for you and that no matter
[12:44] how young you are you can feel the
[12:47] presence of the Lord amen that his holy
[12:50] spirit is there for you I know we as
[12:54] adults talk a lot about the Holy Spirit
[12:57] but it's it's the same holy spirit that
[13:00] was in the Garden of Eden and he's here
[13:03] to touch your lives and to be there for
[13:06] you and we'd love for you to learn that
[13:10] you can call on his
[13:11] name amen he's a present help in the
[13:14] time of trouble so we just want to let

[13:45] Heavenly
[13:48] Father Lord we often refer to that great
[13:52] scripture suffer the little ones to come

[14:00] the scripture unless you become like
[14:02] Little

[14:43] hearts that you would open their minds

[34:12] inheritance he found him in a desert
[34:15] land and in the waste howling
[34:18] Wilderness he led him about he
[34:21] instructed him and he kept him as the
[34:25] apple of his eye
[34:27] as an eagle stirreth up her nest and
[34:31] fluth over her young and spreadeth
[34:34] abroad her wings and taketh them and
[34:37] beareth them on her

[35:49] seats how many like
[35:52] animals raise your hand let me see how
[35:54] many enjoy animals that's
[35:58] all I thought there' be well hold them
[36:01] up high I guess there's more I love
[36:04] animals and I love nature because you
[36:07] can see God in nature you can how many
[36:10] like to be in the mountains how many
[36:12] like the
[36:13] mountains how many like the
[36:16] sea how many like the desert God is a
[36:19] god of variety isn't he how many like
[36:23] how how many like
[36:25] lions how about grizzly
[36:30] bears
[36:32] jellyfish no no go on Jelly one two
[36:35] jellyfish a few
[36:37] jellyfish how many like birds
[36:41] peacocks
[36:43] crows
[36:45] chickens
[36:47] Eagles that's what I want to preach
[36:49] about this morning how did you know I'm
[36:50] going to preach on Eagles an eagle is an
[36:53] interesting Bird yeah it's God builds
[36:57] everything God is a god of variety and
[36:59] so he makes the deserts different than
[37:01] the mountains and different than the sea
[37:03] and then all of God's animals they're
[37:05] distinct and they got their own
[37:07] qualities their own ability to
[37:09] camouflage their they've got their own
[37:11] nature and it's it's just marvelous to
[37:13] see how God designs creatures but one of
[37:16] the most interesting creatures of the
[37:20] Bible uh that God has made in creation
[37:23] is the eagle and the eagle not only is
[37:26] an amazing creature but he has spiritual
[37:29] significance in the
[37:31] scriptures and uh he's a bird of prey do
[37:35] you know what that means that means he's
[37:37] a hunter he's an avid Hunter he sees
[37:40] well he's quick and he can kill and not
[37:43] all animals are that way like a dove you
[37:45] know a dove is not a a predator a dove
[37:48] just eats grains and things but an eagle
[37:51] has sharp eyes and he has the ability to
[37:54] to catch his prey and he's he's a a bird
[37:57] that lives in the
[37:59] heavens now a chicken is a
[38:02] bird but a chicken lives in the earth
[38:05] amen he's got
[38:08] wings but he cannot fly to the heavens
[38:11] Like an Eagle an eagle is real special
[38:15] it's specially built brother Brenham
[38:17] said it's one of the highest flying
[38:19] birds and he said that it's its uh
[38:22] feathers are so tight in its body that
[38:25] you can't even pull a feather out with
[38:28] pliers because when he gets up there
[38:30] could you imagine if he soared into the
[38:32] heaven where the mountain tops and all a
[38:34] sudden he started losing his feathers
[38:36] he's like a and he plummets to the
[38:38] ground he's got to keep those
[38:40] feathers and so God makes sure he puts
[38:43] those feathers in there real tight so
[38:46] when he Soares to the heaven he won't
[38:48] lose a feather he needs everyone to get
[38:50] up there praise the Lord he's a special
[38:53] built bird I'm going to see if I can
[38:56] make make this work look at him how many
[38:59] like that
[39:01] picture he's got binocular vision I
[39:05] can't remember how many times his their
[39:08] eyes are better than ours and and they
[39:11] can see when they get up in the Heights
[39:14] they can see so far that any movement
[39:17] and and they can get to their prey very
[39:20] quickly I just love his eyes and God
[39:23] build him so he so he lives in the
[39:26] heavens uhoh Houston we got a
[39:28] problem oh look at that how do I go
[39:31] back see what impatience
[39:35] does there look at that no no no no go
[39:40] back
[39:42] back go to go to go to two there we go
[39:46] yeah go back one
[39:49] more there we go look at that how many
[39:52] would like to be an
[39:54] eagle to fly in the heaven
[39:57] wouldn't that be so fun to be an eagle
[39:58] for a day how many want to be a chicken
[40:01] for a
[40:04] day how many want to be an eagle for a
[40:07] day praise the Lord now he's specially
[40:11] built he's made to
[40:14] soar to soar into the heavens and
[40:17] brother brandham said that that not
[40:19] every bird a chicken could never live at
[40:21] this
[40:22] altitude even his ability to breathe his
[40:25] ability to see
[40:27] his ability just to just to soar through
[40:30] the
[40:31] heavens and brother brandham said
[40:33] Christians are special built
[40:36] people that God has created as he
[40:39] created this Eagle to live in the
[40:41] heavens God has created us to live in a
[40:44] spiritual Heavenly
[40:47] atmosphere we are built to be filled
[40:49] with the Holy Spirit we are built to see
[40:52] the things of God by
[40:54] faith we are God's
[40:58] Eagles and the eagle is special because
[41:01] God types himself as an
[41:04] eagle his wing tips go from tip to tip
[41:08] about eight feet and so he's a big bird
[41:11] and he needs big wings to carry his
[41:13] weight in the heavens God made him that
[41:16] way isn't that awesome he's got he's got
[41:20] a ratchet claw so when he catches
[41:23] something he sinks his claws in and he
[41:25] don't turn it loose
[41:27] and I think that's the way Believers
[41:28] ought to be when God gives you something
[41:30] we are in these meetings just sink your
[41:33] sink your Talons into it and the old
[41:35] ratchet claw won't turn it
[41:37] loose someone had told me that it's like
[41:40] a like a ratchet and he's got to eat the
[41:42] meat out from between his fingers in
[41:44] order to turn it
[41:46] loose praise the Lord he can go 40 miles
[41:50] per hour that's fast and he can go a 100
[41:53] miles per hour in a dive so they can fly
[41:57] and they their their ability to sail
[41:59] through the air is absolutely incredible
[42:02] Supreme hunters and they kill duck and
[42:04] they kill rabbits and they kill deer and
[42:07] they can kill they can just kill about
[42:09] anything it's amazing and what I want to
[42:12] explain is he is designed for that place
[42:16] God made him to be
[42:18] there praise the Lord I love it and God
[42:21] calls himself an
[42:23] eagle Papa eagle Jehovah eagle and God
[42:29] calls His prophets
[42:31] Eagles you know why because a a prophet
[42:35] is a
[42:36] Seer and the higher he goes in the
[42:40] spirit the further he can see and he
[42:42] could see storms coming he could see
[42:45] judgment coming he could see things
[42:47] coming so God had called His prophets
[42:52] Eagles and this is the best part God
[42:56] calls his children
[42:59] Eagles we are eagles we're spiritual
[43:03] Eagles how
[43:05] beautiful God wants us to climb into
[43:08] spiritual attitud
[43:10] altitudes we are not Earthbound we're
[43:14] Heavenly
[43:15] bound and I believe when we come
[43:17] together in worship it should be
[43:19] Heavenly places that our worship should
[43:22] be Heavenly worship that our faith
[43:25] should be in the heavens our mind should
[43:27] be in the heavens our heart should be in
[43:29] Heavens our our our affections upon
[43:31] things above we are looking
[43:35] upward our destiny is
[43:39] upward praise the
[43:42] Lord now another detail that I love
[43:46] about the eagle is that h a a husband
[43:50] and wife Eagle they are mates for life
[43:54] they stay together which is really neat
[43:57] see if I can I do the next slide please
[43:59] I think that might be the easier way to
[44:01] go brother Craig was messing things up
[44:04] so bad can everybody can everybody read
[44:06] that in the back it says doth the eagle
[44:09] Mount up at thy command this is out of
[44:11] the Book of Job or make her nest on high
[44:15] she dwells and abides upon the rock upon
[44:20] the crack of The
[44:21] Rock and the Strong
[44:24] place from then she seeketh the prey and
[44:27] her eyes Behold a far off her young also
[44:31] suck up blood and where the slain
[44:35] is there is
[44:38] she praise the Lord the eagle builds her
[44:42] nest in the mountain
[44:44] peaks far above the
[44:47] coyote far above the fox or the snakes
[44:50] or ones that would want to eat her
[44:52] babies she flies so high that nothing on
[44:55] the earth can can harm
[44:57] them and that's where God wants to put
[45:00] his church this morning so high from the
[45:03] devil that he cannot reach you a wolf
[45:07] would love to to sink his teeth into a
[45:10] baby eagle how many like to eat chicken
[45:12] fried
[45:14] chicken I imagine a young a young eaglet
[45:17] would taste like fried chicken to a
[45:20] coyote oh he licks his lips if I could
[45:23] just sink my teeth in the water and be
[45:25] like just having a a a chicken
[45:28] dinner but how is he supposed to get
[45:31] there when he when he builds his nest in
[45:33] the mountain
[45:35] peaks he lives there how
[45:39] beautiful and look look at there builds
[45:42] him a Nast out of sticks and up there
[45:45] who who's going to get
[45:47] him and you know when you come to the
[45:49] Lord God is our protector and we are in
[45:52] the CFT of The Rock and nothing can harm
[45:55] us when God build when God births Us in
[45:58] the mountain peaks praise the Lord
[46:02] everybody love the
[46:04] Lord Brother bham told a story of a time
[46:07] he went to Cincinnati Zoo I won't hold
[46:11] you long and if if if you start
[46:13] lessening on the amens I might just
[46:16] break into my long preaching so stay
[46:18] with
[46:19] me brother Bram went to Cincinnati Zoo
[46:23] and he said I saw the wor one of the
[46:25] worst things that I had ever seen in my
[46:27] life he said I Saw an Eagle he was in a
[46:33] cage and he said the eagle was looking
[46:36] up to the heavens and he said it was
[46:39] trying to get out of the cage and it
[46:42] would it would make flops and it would
[46:44] hit the cage and it would fall back onto
[46:47] the floor and he said his eyes was
[46:49] rolling and he said he had bruised his
[46:52] head and his wings was all beat up and
[46:55] he said said and he was looking up he
[46:58] looked bewildered and he wanted out of
[47:00] the
[47:01] cage he said it was so sad because he
[47:04] was not meant to live in a cage but he
[47:07] was meant to live in the heavens in the
[47:10] mountaintops with the clouds but his
[47:13] heart was longing to be there but a man
[47:16] had put him in a
[47:18] cage isn't that
[47:20] sad here God had created him to be
[47:24] free God had created him to live in The
[47:27] Wide Open Heavens and here he is some
[47:30] man outsmarted him and stuck him in a
[47:33] cage and brother Brenham said it was one
[47:35] of the saddest sights that I ever saw he
[47:37] said but there is a sadder sight he said
[47:40] a son or a daughter of God that was
[47:43] meant to be a son or daughter of God he
[47:46] said that is caged up with addiction
[47:49] caged up with sickness and caged up with
[47:52] sickness when he ought to be free in the
[47:54] heavens
[47:57] and brother brandham said what I would
[47:58] have done the money I would pay to set
[48:01] that to set him free because he's
[48:04] longing for the
[48:08] heavens because he was meant to live in
[48:11] the power of
[48:13] God I'm trying to let you know young
[48:16] people we Are Spiritual Eagles we are
[48:19] not an Earthbound people our souls are
[48:23] to be in the Heavenly places that God
[48:26] can speak to us and God can deal with
[48:29] us how many say Lord I want more faith I
[48:33] want to climb up higher in my
[48:36] experience we are created to live above
[48:39] the world and above sin and
[48:42] death we're created to live above all
[48:44] the dangers of the earth praise the
[48:48] Lord and you know Jesus when Jesus came
[48:52] do you know the Bible said he said the
[48:54] spirit of the Lord has anointed me to
[48:57] preach the gospel to the poor and so
[48:59] forth and he said to open the
[49:02] prison do you know that's what Jesus
[49:05] does is when eagles are in the cage
[49:07] Jesus opens the cage and he said you're
[49:10] free and you could fly out of that cage
[49:12] into the heavens that's what sin did Sin
[49:16] put us in a
[49:17] cage that's what the devil did to the
[49:20] human race it stuck us in a
[49:23] cage but Jesus opened the C ages said
[49:26] fly little ego you're
[49:29] free hallelujah how many would it be
[49:32] free whom the son is made free is free
[49:36] indeed I want you to tell the devil that
[49:39] I'm free
[49:41] indeed that's the way God made us to be
[49:44] as free as that eagle we saw flying
[49:47] that's what God wants you to be in these
[49:49] meetings God wants you to be free from
[49:51] the world free from sin free from
[49:54] complexes free from Fear God wants you
[49:57] to be
[50:00] free
[50:02] Hallelujah we ought to be soaring like a
[50:04] flying eagle this
[50:06] morning I pray I praise the Lord for his
[50:09] goodness to us free from sin forgiven
[50:14] free from the
[50:15] past and bear with me here she
[50:18] builds her nest in the mountain
[50:23] peaks yeah would you go back to the one
[50:25] you just
[50:26] had how beautiful that's a gold eagle
[50:29] look how high right up there in the
[50:31] cliff nothing can harm him nothing can
[50:34] hurt him now when she prepares her nest
[50:38] go
[50:40] back yeah when she prepares her nest
[50:43] look how big that is some of the biggest
[50:45] Nest uh I don't know I don't have the
[50:48] dimensions but they can make some huge
[50:52] nests and so they go get sticks and grap
[50:55] V and twigs and and they build them
[50:58] strong enough to to be up there in that
[51:00] mountain
[51:01] place and she line she goes down brother
[51:05] brandom said she'll go down and she'll
[51:07] find a rabbit she'll kill that rabbit
[51:10] and has anyone ever petted a rabbit
[51:13] raise your hand if you've touched a
[51:15] rabbit you ever felt how soft and warm
[51:17] it is will that eagle will line that
[51:21] that nest with with soft rabbit fur or
[51:25] he'll go kill a little
[51:26] lamb and he'll take that lamb skin and
[51:29] he'll make it real soft and then he'll
[51:32] take straw whatever he could find soft
[51:35] and he will he will build the inside see
[51:38] how many sticks are on the outside he'll
[51:41] build the inside real soft like a mommy
[51:43] tries to wrap her baby real sweet and
[51:46] snuggly that's what the Eagles do to
[51:49] their
[51:50] babies so that she builds the nest real
[51:53] nice and she starts brooding over it and
[51:57] so well do you know what brooding is who
[51:59] knows what brooding
[52:03] is what's
[52:09] brooding is
[52:13] what well what they what it is have you
[52:15] ever seen a a bird just cover their eggs
[52:18] like this they sit on the eggs they're
[52:21] creating an
[52:23] atmosphere because eggs cannot just come
[52:27] forth without an
[52:29] atmosphere and God has baby eagles here
[52:32] and they've got to have an atmosphere
[52:34] and it's got to be the right kind of
[52:36] atmosphere how many want to see some
[52:38] Eagles hatch out of this meeting we need
[52:40] an atmosphere of the Holy Spirit and
[52:43] Mommy Eagle creates that atmosphere
[52:46] that's what the pastor is doing that's
[52:48] what the elders are doing they want to
[52:50] see Eagles come out of this
[52:53] meeting so they create an
[52:55] atmosphere that'll keep that I I saw a
[52:58] picture of of an eagle totally covered
[53:01] in snow it was totally covered in this
[53:04] its nest and it had eggs under it
[53:07] because the snow was not going to harm
[53:09] those eggs whatever happens in this
[53:12] world it's not going to harm this
[53:15] atmosphere it's determined to create an
[53:18] atmosphere and if the atmosphere is
[53:20] created whether we live in the darkest
[53:22] Tower or not Eagles will be born
[53:29] Hallelujah and so now she Broods that's
[53:31] what brooding is honey she Broods over
[53:34] that that's her job now she's got to
[53:37] stay on those eggs creating an
[53:39] atmosphere
[53:41] until they break out of that egg is that
[53:45] wonderful in other words you see look at
[53:47] the there we go perfect picture she's
[53:50] right over top of those
[53:52] eggs nothing is going to hurt them
[53:54] there's a special Nearness of God in
[53:57] these kind of
[53:58] meetings how many feel that the Lord is
[54:01] near God is speaking to us God Is wooing
[54:06] Us
[54:08] special what the whole purpose of the
[54:10] brooding is to bring forth the eagle out
[54:13] of the egg and the yet now on on the
[54:17] outside that's what you see but on the
[54:19] inside of the egg something special is
[54:23] happening God is forming this little
[54:26] Eagle inside of this egg and as it gets
[54:30] bigger and bigger pretty soon it gets
[54:33] too big for the egg and God created
[54:37] what's called a pipping tooth on the
[54:41] beak of the little
[54:43] eaglet and that pipping tooth is a tool
[54:47] that'll fall off after it gets out of
[54:49] the egg it's a tool to help crack itself
[54:53] out so the mama can create the
[54:57] atmosphere but the eagle has to have
[55:00] their own faith the eagle has to have
[55:03] its own
[55:04] desire that I'm getting up out of this
[55:07] egg I'm going to come into the
[55:09] congregation of the Saints I'm going to
[55:12] come into the presence of
[55:14] God and God built on the neck of that
[55:17] eagle a muscle it's a pipping muscle
[55:20] strong and it starts losing its air it
[55:24] can't breathe through the pores of that
[55:26] egg as it as it fills that egg so it's
[55:29] got to get out or it'll die and that's
[55:32] the way God wants you to come to the
[55:34] promises I've got to have the Holy Ghost
[55:36] I've got to know God is my savior and so
[55:39] he starts pipping he starts amening the
[55:43] word I'm going to receive something in
[55:45] this meeting God's going to meet with me
[55:48] in this
[55:50] meeting and now the mom can produce the
[55:53] atmosphere but it takes the
[55:55] eagle to want to get
[55:59] out of that
[56:01] egg how many want more of God you young
[56:05] people how many want more of God see you
[56:09] God sees that desire and God has put a
[56:12] little pipping tool in your heart that
[56:15] cries Amen to the word of God that that
[56:19] faith will start beating on that shell
[56:21] I've got to come out of here it's life
[56:24] and death
[56:25] you've got to know God as your own
[56:29] Savior and so he starts pipping and it
[56:32] takes two to four days to get out of
[56:34] there and then he breaks it and when he
[56:38] breaks it oxygen comes in what's he
[56:41] doing he's trying to break into another
[56:46] world let me tell you there's something
[56:48] much more than this
[56:50] Dimension when we come into these
[56:52] meetings that's our desires to break to
[56:55] that other world the place where all
[56:57] things are
[56:59] possible
[57:01] Hallelujah tipping its way out of the
[57:03] egg Satan get off me Satan move out of
[57:07] my way I'm coming through I'm coming out
[57:10] of this condition I'm coming out of this
[57:13] depression I'm coming out of here
[57:17] hallelujah the eagle designed to break
[57:19] out of that ache and the mother is
[57:22] sitting there watching her babies
[57:24] Jehovah Eagle is watching this meeting
[57:26] he's watching you on the front row and
[57:28] on the second row he knows your name he
[57:31] cares about you and he's watching over
[57:33] you when he does all he can do he
[57:36] watches because now it's got to be
[57:38] something that comes out of you
[57:42] Hallelujah the word Eagle means feed her
[57:46] with the
[57:48] beak have you ever seen an eagle feed it
[57:51] or any bird have you ever seen any bird
[57:54] feed its
[57:55] babies how do they feed them
[58:06] yeah good job good job that's exactly
[58:09] what they do she if you didn't hear her
[58:12] she said they go hunt worms and they
[58:14] take them in their mouth and when they
[58:16] get to the nest the babies are going
[58:18] like this and they drop it right into
[58:20] their mouth and so Eagle is called
[58:23] theater of the Beast or Ripper of the
[58:26] beak because they only eat
[58:29] meat years ago I was studying on my
[58:31] front porch and it was as quiet as could
[58:35] be and in my pine tree all of a sudden I
[58:38] heard out of nowhere these little birds
[58:44] start out of nowhere it was totally
[58:47] quiet and when I looked into the pine
[58:49] tree the mama had just brought food and
[58:53] as soon as food arrived a Revival
[58:57] started and that's why God feeds his b
[59:00] his baby eagles he feeds them with his
[59:03] beak the word of God he feeds us from
[59:07] heaven with his
[59:09] mouth and when God feeds us with his
[59:12] mouth a Revival breaks over the
[59:17] church mommy me next me next me next how
[59:21] many are hungry for the word of God
[59:24] hallelujah hallelujah Wonder
[59:28] hungry-heart people fresh meat every day
[59:30] every service praise the Lord now this
[59:34] is where it gets good am I doing okay on
[59:37] time it's because you're amening I was
[59:40] afraid we're going to be here for a long
[59:42] time but you're aen and well so the one
[59:45] thing it's a little
[59:47] gross about the eagle is when he eats he
[59:53] regurgitates I'm talking about the
[59:55] babies so I want you to picture now that
[59:58] Nest I described nice and cozy and
[1:00:03] soft but the longer they're there the
[1:00:06] Nester The Nest
[1:00:08] gets and you got to remember he's
[1:00:10] catching fish he's dropping fish in
[1:00:13] there dropping snakes in there dropping
[1:00:17] rabbits in there and then the babies are
[1:00:20] regurgitating and so the nest is full it
[1:00:24] starts getting filled with waste it
[1:00:27] starts getting
[1:00:29] nasty in other
[1:00:32] words comes a
[1:00:34] time where we got to leave the
[1:00:38] nest there comes a time where God wants
[1:00:41] to call us to what he made us
[1:00:45] for there is a nurturing stage of our
[1:00:48] journey and when we come to the Lord God
[1:00:51] babies us he softens everything thing
[1:00:54] around us Andy and it closes a special
[1:00:57] love a special closeness of his presence
[1:01:00] but there comes a time where God said
[1:01:02] you will not always be in the nest am
[1:01:06] you will not always be a baby but I have
[1:01:10] plans for you what me sailing in the
[1:01:13] heavens you have ego
[1:01:16] potential and that ego wants to see you
[1:01:19] live your
[1:01:22] potential right now we have a little lot
[1:01:25] of baby
[1:01:26] eaglets and our job is to protect them
[1:01:30] and to feed them the word of God and to
[1:01:32] create an environment where they hear
[1:01:34] the word of God and can be born again
[1:01:37] but they will not always stay little
[1:01:40] eaglets God made them to be Sons and
[1:01:43] Daughters of God God made them in such a
[1:01:47] way that they can believe with their own
[1:01:49] faith and cast out devils and lay their
[1:01:52] hands on the sick and they recover God
[1:01:54] made them to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:01:57] God God knows the potential lays in
[1:02:03] them so you know what the eagle
[1:02:06] does the eagle starts stirring the
[1:02:10] nest and that stirring of the nest what
[1:02:12] that means is she begins to remove all
[1:02:15] of the soft
[1:02:18] comfortable all of the Lamb skinned all
[1:02:21] of it she begins throwing the down out
[1:02:24] out of the nest and and all of the
[1:02:27] sudden the the the little eots are
[1:02:29] getting poked and and
[1:02:33] uncomfortable and what he what God is
[1:02:36] trying to do is make them willing to
[1:02:39] take a leap of
[1:02:41] faith pretty soon The Nest that they
[1:02:44] loved it becomes it becomes a place that
[1:02:47] is no longer
[1:02:49] comfortable and Mommy Eagle is trying to
[1:02:52] get them to set their affection
[1:02:56] above so it removes the
[1:02:59] Comfort sometimes God gives us trials he
[1:03:02] gives you hard trials to make you so he
[1:03:06] is not trying to harm you he wants to P
[1:03:08] pull your potential out you don't have
[1:03:11] to have the pastor's Faith you've got to
[1:03:13] have your own
[1:03:17] faith pretty soon that warm little Nest
[1:03:20] now this is all the little ones
[1:03:23] know God's about ready to do something
[1:03:28] wonderful so she pulls out the
[1:03:31] down she starts stirring the
[1:03:34] nest I like that that word stir means
[1:03:39] awaken she is trying to awaken the eagle
[1:03:43] to what it
[1:03:44] is he wants you to know your own
[1:03:48] potential he wants you to know that all
[1:03:51] things are possible to them that believe
[1:03:54] yes and he stirs and he stirs and the
[1:03:58] more that she stirs the more
[1:04:00] uncomfortable the little eaglets become
[1:04:03] and there's nowhere to
[1:04:04] go what do we do young people what do we
[1:04:09] do where do we
[1:04:11] go there's one
[1:04:14] chance the Eagle's like this is
[1:04:16] absolutely
[1:04:18] miserable I feel like a
[1:04:21] chicken my life has come to this
[1:04:33] after a few
[1:04:37] days usually they lay two eggs brother
[1:04:40] Eagle said hey I got an idea what is it
[1:04:45] look what is
[1:04:47] this we got wings like Mama
[1:04:51] got look you look just like like Mama
[1:04:55] thank
[1:04:57] you you look like Papa thanks hey we
[1:05:02] don't have to stay in this
[1:05:04] Nest I
[1:05:06] think
[1:05:08] no you
