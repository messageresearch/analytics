[49:20] describe your
[49:21] glory your power your

[49:41] all the worlds of plant life and animal
[49:44] life and human
[49:48] life the great
[49:51] variety of your majesty is beyond
[49:54] description
[49:57] but Lord we've come here today
[50:00] because we feel that you beckoned us to
[50:04] come worship
[50:05] you there's a call in our heart and a
[50:08] desire in our heart to give you the
[50:11] praise that you so worthy of to call you
[50:15] King of Kings Lord of lords the God
[50:20] creator of all
[50:22] things father please accept our
[50:27] humble service this morning to your
[50:31] greatness as unworthy as we are you
[50:35] chose to love us and father we thankful
[50:39] for that today and we ask you to bless
[50:41] us in Jesus precious name we pray amen
[50:46] amen God bless you may be
[50:49] seated I uh
[50:52] uh would like to just listen to 20
[50:55] minutes of a sermon
[50:57] uh this morning before we start I think
[51:00] it's uh mindful you know uh the uh this
[51:05] week we got a a
[51:07] testimony um I believe that I I think it
[51:11] was sister uh Lily uh Matt and Heidi's
[51:16] daughter uh they diagnosed uh some uh
[51:20] complication that can come with
[51:22] pregnancy and and so I I don't know the
[51:26] words are exactly all that it is but it
[51:29] can be harmful to the mother so they
[51:31] rush her to the hospital and when they
[51:33] get to the hospital the people at the
[51:35] hospital said of course Heidi put out
[51:38] prayer request and you know maybe some
[51:40] of you got it and we prayed and so when
[51:43] they get to the hospital they say they
[51:46] get her there and they say to her they
[51:49] say uh well how in the world did they
[51:51] come up with this
[51:54] diagnosis and they sent them back and I
[51:57] thought well they asked the wrong
[52:01] question you know what I mean no what
[52:04] they needed to ask how did from there to
[52:07] here did everything go away you know
[52:12] sometimes it's important that you ask
[52:13] the right question you know what I mean
[52:16] and and that that I just thought you
[52:18] know I just thought that was striking
[52:20] you know that God moves in such a way
[52:24] that he's always hides himself in simp
[52:26] licity uh uh so many times we we think a
[52:30] miracle is something that's got to have
[52:33] a a a great uh big orchestration and got
[52:38] to be way out and you know like they
[52:40] show in the movies you know uh those
[52:44] leopards were healed and nobody even
[52:46] knew only one even came back to said
[52:49] Thank you and so you can just imagine
[52:52] that uh we think all these great things
[52:55] took place but believe it or not all the
[52:58] great miracles of god took place in the
[53:01] midst of
[53:02] unbelief there was only a very few
[53:04] people that even recognized them as
[53:07] Miracles you know that people explain
[53:10] them away and there's coincidence in
[53:12] everything but I just thought that was
[53:14] marvelous the hand of God doing
[53:17] something and once again here he is in
[53:19] our midst and he goes
[53:22] unrecognized but praise God we recognize
[53:24] who it was he amen amen so if you have
[53:28] your Bibles let's turn to
[53:31] uh we're going to turn over to the uh St
[53:36] John the 9th chapter and we're going to
[53:39] start with the 26th verse and I'm not
[53:42] going to read it uh our messenger is
[53:44] going to read it and I just this just
[53:46] say 21 minutes but I want it to be the
[53:49] foundation of where uh that we're going
[53:54] uh this morning CU I want to preach on
[53:57] uh a a little subject called the
[54:00] greatest possession of the believer the
[54:04] greatest possession of the believer what
[54:06] it what is it that the Believers
[54:08] possesses that's the greatest thing so
[54:12] uh we' like to talk about that but
[54:13] before we do this this is from the
[54:15] message called taking sides with
[54:19] Jesus very important message I think
[54:21] it's very
[54:23] timely uh for the atmosphere and the
[54:27] things that are
[54:28] transpiring around us not only within
[54:31] the political natural scientific worlds
[54:35] but also within the church world it's
[54:38] very important that we learn to take
[54:41] sides with Jesus so the minute we're
[54:43] done reading these scriptures uh then we
[54:47] just uh simply uh and the last uh
[54:52] statement of this scripture says and
[54:55] Jesus has heard heard that they had cast
[54:58] him out and when he had found him he
[55:02] said unto him does thou believe on the
[55:06] Son of God so at that point we'll sit
[55:09] down so God bless you I hope you enjoy
[55:12] this this morning after the scripture
[55:13] reading sit down and and we'll have a
[55:16] good time of Fellowship for the Lord
[55:18] richly bless
[55:21] you now in St John the 9th chapter I
[55:25] want to read from the 26th verse unto
[55:29] the 35th now just for a few minutes and
[55:32] then we'll we'll close in the next 20 to
[55:35] 30 minutes or maybe before that time the
[55:38] Lord willing now I want to read these
[55:40] scriptures now from St John 26 to uh St
[55:44] John 10 9 uh 26-35 I've got roll down
[55:49] here just something I was thinking of
[55:51] then said they unto him again what did
[55:57] he do to
[55:59] thee how open he thine
[56:02] eyes and he answered them I have told
[56:05] you already and you did not hear
[56:09] wherefore would you hear
[56:12] again will you also be his
[56:16] disciples then they reviled him and said
[56:20] th his disciples but we are moses'
[56:24] disciples we know that God spake unto
[56:27] Moses but for this fell we know not from
[56:31] whence he
[56:33] is the man answered and said unto
[56:36] them why herein is a marvelous thing
[56:42] that you know not from whence he is and
[56:44] yet he has opened mine
[56:47] eyes now we know that God heareth not
[56:50] Sinners but if any man be a worshipper
[56:53] of
[56:55] God and and doeth his will him he
[56:59] heareth since the world began has it not
[57:03] heard that any man has opened the eyes
[57:06] of one that was born
[57:08] blind if this man were not of God he
[57:12] could do nothing then
[57:15] answered they answered and said unto him
[57:19] thou was altto together born in sin and
[57:24] does thou teach us and they cast him out
[57:29] and Jesus heard that they had cast him
[57:32] out and when he had found him he said
[57:35] unto him does thou believe on the Son of
[57:40] God
[57:42] now I'd like to speak just for a few
[57:44] minutes to you Brethren knowing at my
[57:47] little talk here I don't know what will
[57:50] become of it trusting that God will use
[57:53] it in some way and now in this upon his
[57:55] word word so I know that brother Saint
[57:58] brother Neville or one of you ministers
[57:59] usually preach and just being here with
[58:01] you uh if you pardon me I just like to
[58:04] speak to you a little bit on this manner
[58:06] now I want to take a subject here of
[58:09] taking sides with
[58:12] Jesus the
[58:14] Pharisees and leaders of his Day always
[58:18] tried to belittle him before the
[58:22] people that was just a way that the
[58:27] devil had a
[58:28] working all the Pharisees and the
[58:32] teachers of his day constantly tried to
[58:37] belittle
[58:39] Jesus they all the throw that they could
[58:42] give to him they done
[58:44] it they watched him constantly to find
[58:48] where they could find a fault and they
[58:50] never spoke of that they could belittle
[58:52] him about and say you see look here here
[58:56] if he was a man of God he wouldn't do it
[58:58] this way or if he was a man of God he
[59:01] wouldn't do it that way they were trying
[59:04] to cast The Shadow upon him to get the
[59:08] people to disbelieve him
[59:10] amen that's the work of the
[59:13] devil and that old scheme has never
[59:17] ceased there's many times that a
[59:20] minister will make a
[59:22] mistake and if he comes into a
[59:24] neighborhood a precious brother who
[59:26] who's trying to do what's right and to
[59:28] lead the people right everything that
[59:31] the devil can point to the unbeliever or
[59:34] the so-called Christian in that
[59:36] neighborhood to throw off on that man
[59:38] he'll do it you know the real Christian
[59:41] way is to hide everything you can from a
[59:44] brother don't tell his bad things just
[59:46] tell his good things just tell what you
[59:49] know about him's good if anything's bad
[59:51] let it alone poor Fell's got enough
[59:54] against him anyhow don't try to take a
[59:57] pole and shove a man further into the
[59:59] ditch the Christian attitude is pick him
[1:00:01] up and take him out of the ditch they
[1:00:03] don't never try to shove him down he's
[1:00:05] down already try to help him up and but
[1:00:10] too many of us today too many people
[1:00:12] today I might say try to do that if they
[1:00:16] could just get something and other that
[1:00:18] they could say that was real bad now for
[1:00:21] instance if if one of you brethen make a
[1:00:24] mistake and do something's wrong which
[1:00:27] you're subject to do it I am too every
[1:00:30] one of us but as we go along let's
[1:00:33] remember we are
[1:00:35] brothers we are brothers and if we got
[1:00:38] any fighting let's fight with one
[1:00:40] another bring it together bring it
[1:00:42] before our Brethren and settle it now
[1:00:45] they used to in the Brandon family if
[1:00:46] one of the little ones done something he
[1:00:48] go tell Bill about it because I was the
[1:00:49] biggest and I had to stand there and see
[1:00:52] which was right and wrong well my
[1:00:54] decision was that uh if they uh which
[1:00:58] one is right and wrong if they still
[1:00:59] didn't believe it then they got around
[1:01:00] behind my back and fought it out but
[1:01:02] they were still Brothers you see that
[1:01:04] fight in the backyard with one another
[1:01:06] and fight in the front yard for one
[1:01:08] another so that's the way it was see and
[1:01:11] it were still Brothers well that that's
[1:01:13] the way we we got to do this see if you
[1:01:16] got something against somebody you're a
[1:01:18] brother don't tell somebody else about
[1:01:20] if it's wrong go to him and tell
[1:01:24] him and then if if he go to argue with
[1:01:26] you then take somebody else with you
[1:01:29] then bring it up the way the Bible said
[1:01:31] but
[1:01:32] Jesus they they just tried to find every
[1:01:36] little shadow that they could find to
[1:01:39] try to belittle him in the sight of the
[1:01:42] people and that's what the devil wants
[1:01:45] they want to they want to hurt your
[1:01:48] influence before the people that's why
[1:01:51] you want to watch careful what you do
[1:01:54] walk like real man of God talk like man
[1:01:56] of God see act like man of God live like
[1:01:59] man of God because a devil your
[1:02:02] adversary is going about like a roaring
[1:02:04] line trying to devour what he
[1:02:06] can why did they do this they were
[1:02:10] jealous of him that was what's the
[1:02:12] reason they tried to belittle him they
[1:02:14] were jealous of his
[1:02:16] ministry and that's the reason they were
[1:02:18] trying to belittle but he had the
[1:02:20] ministry of God and they knew that but
[1:02:23] it was contrary to their Creed so they
[1:02:25] were trying to belittle him make
[1:02:27] everything every little flaw that they
[1:02:29] could find get him out of the way they
[1:02:32] want him to quit they want the people to
[1:02:34] denounce him they want to say now uh
[1:02:37] this guy's nothing look here now there
[1:02:39] he is he he he did this and you know
[1:02:41] that's not right we've been taught all
[1:02:43] of our life that we should believe the
[1:02:45] elders and Y he just stood right there
[1:02:46] and Bal that Elder out he disagreed with
[1:02:49] the tradition of the fathers and we've
[1:02:51] been we are to believe the tradition of
[1:02:53] our fathers we've been taught that by
[1:02:55] each Rabbi all the years through and
[1:02:57] here this man comes around and disagrees
[1:02:59] with him see well the man like that
[1:03:02] ain't fit to be a preacher see they were
[1:03:05] trying to belittle him but in all of
[1:03:08] that the ones that believed him and
[1:03:11] loved him and had seen his scriptural
[1:03:14] Miracle signs would not be hindered by
[1:03:19] them no sir them who believed him
[1:03:22] believed him amen those who loved him
[1:03:25] stood
[1:03:26] F they would not see what others pointed
[1:03:30] out to them oh if we could do that if we
[1:03:34] could just not see if somebody turn
[1:03:36] around here and say you know what they
[1:03:38] say you're a Pentecostal not by
[1:03:40] denomination what you was the you you
[1:03:43] the kind of baptizes in Jesus name yep
[1:03:45] that's right well let me tell you
[1:03:47] something I Know a Man one time was
[1:03:48] baptized like that and he did so and so
[1:03:50] but look it that has nothing to do with
[1:03:52] it it's a devil trying to throw a shadow
[1:03:55] on you amen they're always trying to
[1:03:57] point you to some old ship that got
[1:03:59] wrecked upon the seashore but they're
[1:04:01] not pointing you to that one that made
[1:04:03] the void safely that's right that's
[1:04:06] right they're always trying to throw a
[1:04:08] crowbait out there and say this is
[1:04:10] example here's what did it uh I know a
[1:04:13] certain preacher that was a Holiness
[1:04:15] preacher and he did this that the other
[1:04:17] but they don't point out others that
[1:04:19] wasn't Holiness did that also you see
[1:04:22] and they don't part the great things
[1:04:23] that God did like somebody say oh he
[1:04:26] this man went too far he he went too far
[1:04:29] he might have done that he wrecked
[1:04:31] himself up he went too far he become a
[1:04:33] fanatic he might have done that but
[1:04:36] while they're pointing to how many that
[1:04:37] went one that went too far how about
[1:04:39] these millions that never went far
[1:04:42] enough Fable to see that see what I mean
[1:04:46] so the people tried them Pharisees and
[1:04:50] Sadducees and hypocrites and herodians
[1:04:53] and all tried to cast the Shadow on
[1:04:56] Jesus but them True Believers that was
[1:05:00] predestinated to hear that message heard
[1:05:03] it and see no fault in it at
[1:05:06] all same now those who believe him love
[1:05:11] him those who believe him see no fault
[1:05:13] in him they don't see any heresy they
[1:05:16] don't see anything wrong they don't see
[1:05:18] anything wrong with his word they don't
[1:05:20] see anything wrong with these people
[1:05:21] they just see Jesus and that's all
[1:05:24] they're they're they're it predestinate
[1:05:26] eternal life so they just take sides
[1:05:28] with Jesus and stay there we used to
[1:05:31] write sing a little song brother Roy uh
[1:05:34] R we used to sing a little song here I
[1:05:36] guess time you come here I take the way
[1:05:39] with the Lord's dispise few I started in
[1:05:42] with Jesus and I'm going through I'd
[1:05:45] rather walk with Jesus alone and have
[1:05:47] far my pillow like Jacob a
[1:05:50] stone well you've heard the little song
[1:05:53] that's right I'd rather take the way of
[1:05:55] the
[1:05:56] discard take the way of the despised
[1:05:59] take the way of the talked about and
[1:06:03] walk with Jesus see no fault in it at
[1:06:06] all don't see another Fell's eror just
[1:06:09] keep on going that's all now that's the
[1:06:12] way they did to Jesus they didn't they
[1:06:14] didn't and you must teach your people
[1:06:16] you pastors to do the same if somebody
[1:06:18] comes along and says uh you know uh your
[1:06:21] church they was so and so they yes sir
[1:06:23] they maybe a dozen of them sitting there
[1:06:24] then but about that one it's it's it's
[1:06:27] all right sitting there see you're
[1:06:29] you're you're you just can't see the
[1:06:31] woods for the trees that's all that's it
[1:06:33] right back again see now and so they
[1:06:37] tried they was not willing to admit that
[1:06:40] he was doing the work of God so they
[1:06:43] were trying to so discard and get the
[1:06:46] people not to believe but them people
[1:06:48] who believe him stayed right with him
[1:06:50] they took Sid you know I thought you're
[1:06:53] a couple of people I got wrote down here
[1:06:55] the blind man would not be changed by
[1:06:59] them that man he just give his s we know
[1:07:01] the story and um he gave them a very
[1:07:05] stinging question beside now they come
[1:07:08] up there and Jesus walked by and he was
[1:07:11] a man that was despised and hated the
[1:07:14] Bible said he would be rejected uh there
[1:07:17] be no beauty of him we should desire him
[1:07:20] and all we like sheep have gone astray
[1:07:22] is a man of sorrow acquainted with grief
[1:07:25] and and how all the Bible said what he
[1:07:27] would be he'd be despised and
[1:07:29] rejected and we see that man now those
[1:07:32] who believe the word they know that the
[1:07:34] very things that Jesus was doing and the
[1:07:36] things was of his life they knew who he
[1:07:39] was so they couldn't put nothing light
[1:07:42] on him because they couldn't see it and
[1:07:46] you know love is blind anyhow Same Love
[1:07:50] covers up a multitude of sin you know
[1:07:52] perfect love cast out fear and sin sin
[1:07:56] all Discord love does now this blind man
[1:08:00] was sitting there and Jesus and his
[1:08:02] disciples come by and I Think Jesus gave
[1:08:04] them a little lesson here when they seen
[1:08:07] this poor blind man they thought well
[1:08:09] now surely there's a sin behind that
[1:08:11] somewhere when we see something happen
[1:08:13] to a man we always say well he sin he
[1:08:17] got out of the way of the Lord somewhere
[1:08:19] brother Chris hit the post he got out
[1:08:21] with a lord somewhere somebody's idea
[1:08:23] when the gun blow up on me well
[1:08:26] is is out of the will of the Lord
[1:08:27] Brother Neville hit the car is out of
[1:08:29] the will of the Lord that's not exactly
[1:08:31] right no sir it isn't God permits those
[1:08:35] things Jesus turned around and taught
[1:08:38] him a lesson they said his father must
[1:08:40] have sinned or or did his mother sin or
[1:08:43] did he sin Jesus said neither of them
[1:08:47] sin but that the works of God might be
[1:08:50] made manifest amen see God lets things
[1:08:53] happen just to for the works of God to
[1:08:55] be made
[1:08:56] manifest now and so he said told the man
[1:09:01] and give him his sight and he went he's
[1:09:03] waiting and here come the Pharisees up
[1:09:05] when that was rumored around here was
[1:09:07] the man as blind set now they're begging
[1:09:09] and here he could see and that's a
[1:09:12] rumored around among them and oh my that
[1:09:14] stirred up something and here they come
[1:09:16] up there and they see that the blind man
[1:09:19] could see and first they went wanted to
[1:09:22] find some way to put a fear of upon all
[1:09:25] the people because they had already said
[1:09:28] if anybody goes after this new doctrine
[1:09:31] and this new Prophet called Jesus of
[1:09:33] Nazareth immediately they'll be handed
[1:09:36] their paper and fellowship from the
[1:09:37] church they cannot go to synagogue no
[1:09:39] longer if you associate with him 10 one
[1:09:41] of his meetings or anything you can't go
[1:09:43] no more so they want to make a big
[1:09:46] display out of it because they hated him
[1:09:49] they wasn't thinking that poor blind man
[1:09:52] but they wanted to make a big display to
[1:09:54] make the people keep away from him they
[1:09:56] said they wanted to ask his father and
[1:09:58] mother so they went and got the father
[1:10:00] and mother they said is this your son he
[1:10:02] said yes sir was he born blind yes sir
[1:10:07] and uh what means does he see and the
[1:10:10] father and mother was afraid the Bible
[1:10:11] said because they know they'd be put out
[1:10:13] of the synagogue if they admitted it it
[1:10:15] was and see there it was taken down they
[1:10:18] said now we know this is our son all
[1:10:21] probably a few thousand people stand
[1:10:22] there but if he could if them stinking
[1:10:26] Pharisees could only put a blight on his
[1:10:28] name right there or done something to
[1:10:30] scare the people they running out of
[1:10:31] there for that meeting see all his
[1:10:34] influence have been lost so they said uh
[1:10:37] a bunch of them come up there at their
[1:10:39] Priestly garments on and they said uh

[1:13:20] hundreds of
[1:13:22] years and uh you speak of a coming

[1:13:27] place just in the shadows of time when
[1:13:31] the deliverer is coming to see us and
[1:13:33] you tell us that when he comes that that
[1:13:36] what all he's going to do and here you
[1:13:39] the spiritual leaders the high priest
[1:13:42] and priest of this community standing
[1:13:45] here together before these people trying
[1:13:48] to Blacken his name trying to say
[1:13:50] something evil against him and the man
[1:13:53] come and open my blinded
[1:13:56] I was born blind here's my father and
[1:13:58] mother giving witness that I was born
[1:14:00] blind been sitting right here among you
[1:14:02] for all these years born blind and that
[1:14:05] has never happened since the world
[1:14:08] began and you're a man can come and
[1:14:11] perform a miracle that hasn't been done
[1:14:13] since the world began and you the
[1:14:16] spiritual leaders and don't know nothing
[1:14:17] about it
[1:14:22] am and I say this is a marvelous thing
[1:14:27] you took sides with
[1:14:29] Jesus see he was permitted to be blind
[1:14:33] so the works of God could be manifested
[1:14:36] see because he come on the side of the
[1:14:39] Lord Jesus he took sides with him now he
[1:14:42] put a stinger to him you know what they
[1:14:44] did they said now we know you were born
[1:14:46] in sin try to teach us and shoved him
[1:14:48] out of the church knocked him out pushed
[1:14:50] him out throw him out but as soon as he
[1:14:54] was sold out to did you notice Jesus
[1:14:56] found him again
[1:14:59] amen amen Lord Jesus found him again so
[1:15:05] don't worry if they throw you out he'll
[1:15:07] find you
[1:15:09] again all right and he said to him does
[1:15:12] thou believe on the Son of God he said
[1:15:15] Lord who is he he didn't even know but
[1:15:18] the only thing that he know that where
[1:15:20] he was blind he could then see I know
[1:15:23] this one thing brother you might call
[1:15:25] this fanaticism and whatever you want to
[1:15:27] but wh and I was once the
[1:15:29] sinner I've come into Grace now
[1:15:32] something has happened to see this one
[1:15:34] thing I I now know by trusting his word
[1:15:37] by believing him I've been kicked out of
[1:15:40] every organization are the face of
[1:15:42] Heaven there's none of them that will
[1:15:44] receive me anymore you know that some of
[1:15:46] their man will out here good man will AC
[1:15:48] but every organization is thumbs down on
[1:15:50] me that's right but he's found me you
[1:15:52] find me somewhere that's that's right
[1:15:55] come along like that and um so it'll be
[1:15:57] all right because we want to take sides
[1:15:59] with Jesus and the only way you take
[1:16:01] sides with Jesus is taking sides on what
[1:16:03] he said believe in his word so let's
[1:16:06] take sides with
[1:16:14] him great lesson
[1:16:17] there amen and we want to
[1:16:20] U Fellowship a little bit along those
[1:16:25] lines about the greatest uh possession
[1:16:29] that a Believer could have and I I
[1:16:32] believe our messenger uh mentioned it
[1:16:35] when we were reading and listening there
[1:16:38] in paragraph
[1:16:39] 150 uh he made this statement and see if
[1:16:42] I can find it here for us real quick and
[1:16:46] read it again now those who I'm sorry um
[1:16:51] he said and now those who believe the
[1:16:54] word they know that the very thing that
[1:16:58] Jesus was doing and the thing was of his
[1:17:03] life they knew who he was and they
[1:17:07] couldn't put nothing bright on it him
[1:17:11] because they could couldn't see it and
[1:17:15] you know love is
[1:17:18] blind now I want you to know what they
[1:17:20] said they couldn't find any criticism in
[1:17:22] them because they couldn't see it and
[1:17:26] you know the the the prophet of God is
[1:17:28] telling us right here he says don't let
[1:17:31] somebody come and bring you something
[1:17:34] negative about somebody else don't don't
[1:17:38] let them try to get you to see something
[1:17:41] that you're not
[1:17:42] seeing you know point it out they
[1:17:45] couldn't they couldn't accept it because
[1:17:48] they couldn't see it and and so uh and
[1:17:52] he makes this statement he said they
[1:17:54] were always always want to put a a
[1:17:56] blight on them something on them a mark
[1:17:58] on them you you know that uh like when a
[1:18:01] plant's got blight it's got black marks
[1:18:04] on it you know it's it they always some
[1:18:07] sort of criticism trying to put over
[1:18:09] them oh he don't believe this he don't
[1:18:11] believe that he don't you know and and
[1:18:13] just and he's telling us right here
[1:18:15] don't you listen to it don't don't don't
[1:18:20] do it if you love them you don't see it
[1:18:25] if you love them you don't see it and
[1:18:26] this is what he says he says because
[1:18:29] they couldn't see it
[1:18:32] they so they couldn't put nothing blight
[1:18:36] on him because they couldn't see it you
[1:18:39] know love is
[1:18:42] blind anyhow to them things love covers
[1:18:47] up a multitude of sin you know perfect
[1:18:51] love cast out fear and sin and all
[1:18:54] Discord love does and and so from that
[1:18:59] Foundation I'd like just to uh share a
[1:19:02] little fellowship with you this
[1:19:04] morning um in along the lines of the
[1:19:07] greatest possession that the believer
[1:19:10] has what is the greatest possession that
[1:19:15] you could have as a Believer and there
[1:19:18] words if you could take something out of
[1:19:21] Christianity or something out of the
[1:19:23] Bible or or something that you could lay
[1:19:26] your hands on and say this is what I
[1:19:29] would like to have this is you know I
[1:19:32] have a coin collection and and I've I've
[1:19:35] collected all the coins uh in this
[1:19:39] certain collection except for one
[1:19:42] coin it's the one coin I don't have and
[1:19:46] it's a very rare
[1:19:48] coin and uh uh uh and if I was in the
[1:19:53] realm of of the coins I would say I
[1:19:57] would love to possess this one
[1:20:00] coin if I could have this one
[1:20:04] coin and now I didn't know that when I
[1:20:07] started collecting these coins I just
[1:20:10] would buy one and was good and buy
[1:20:12] another one it's good and then somebody
[1:20:14] sold me some and and all of a sudden I
[1:20:17] have this all the coins except for this
[1:20:20] one so I went to look for this
[1:20:22] one and when I finally got out there I
[1:20:26] found out that this one
[1:20:28] coin the cheapest
[1:20:31] price on this one coin is
[1:20:39] $65,000 and I thought
[1:20:42] m i I don't have that in all my
[1:20:46] coins but this is the one coin now that
[1:20:50] I'd like to have it's the one thing I'd
[1:20:53] like to possess yes if I could say
[1:20:55] anything about anything I would say I
[1:20:58] would like to say I have a you know
[1:21:03] 1892 uh S silver
[1:21:07] dollar that might not be the exact
[1:21:11] description because I don't want any of
[1:21:13] you to go out and buy that for
[1:21:17] me but it be now it's if I had that I I
[1:21:22] would have more than all that I have so
[1:21:25] that one coin becomes the greatest
[1:21:28] possession of all the coins so what is
[1:21:32] the greatest thing that a a a Christian
[1:21:38] the greatest possession a Christian
[1:21:41] could have and I believe that greatest
[1:21:44] possession that a Christian could have
[1:21:47] is
[1:21:50] love that that's the greatest thing and
[1:21:53] and
[1:21:55] when you possess something it's
[1:21:57] something you know that you have it's
[1:22:01] yours you have the evidence of it right
[1:22:05] if if I had that coin I could go in
[1:22:08] there and open my little box up and I
[1:22:11] could take the coin and and and I could
[1:22:14] hold it in my hand and I would know that
[1:22:17] I possess it I have this it's mine I
[1:22:22] have it I own this no I I can talk to
[1:22:25] you about this coin I can tell you all
[1:22:28] about how many were printed and the
[1:22:30] dates it was printed and what kind of
[1:22:33] conditions they they are but it's
[1:22:36] unobtainable for
[1:22:38] me you you understand I realize that I'm
[1:22:41] not going to go out and put that kind of
[1:22:44] money into that when there's so many
[1:22:46] other things to do but but uh so I can
[1:22:51] know about
[1:22:53] it I can have great conversations and
[1:22:56] I've had tremendous conversations about
[1:22:59] that
[1:23:01] coin that guy meant a man that has
[1:23:05] one he has it in mint
[1:23:08] condition I even wanted to look at it
[1:23:12] and I don't think he wanted to take it
[1:23:14] out you know the coins worth over a
[1:23:17] million dollars one
[1:23:20] coin and he's got it oh it was great
[1:23:23] talking about
[1:23:25] but get when I walked out of there he
[1:23:27] had it and I
[1:23:31] didn't I didn't possess
[1:23:34] it and I couldn't talk him out of
[1:23:37] it because he knew what he
[1:23:42] had he knew what he
[1:23:45] possessed he knew the value of it he
[1:23:48] knew the Rarity of it and may I say this
[1:23:51] today that real genuine Christian love
[1:23:54] is a very rare
[1:23:59] thing very few people possess it and we
[1:24:05] just we just heard our messenger go
[1:24:07] through talking about uh uh what Satan
[1:24:10] does and and and how he casts doubt on
[1:24:13] people and he says bad things about
[1:24:16] people and he just runs people he just
[1:24:19] jealous as as can be and And yet when he
[1:24:22] begin to describe the he described a
[1:24:25] Christian don't do that a Christian
[1:24:28] don't see that a Christian doesn't think
[1:24:30] evil a Christian doesn't take sides with
[1:24:33] that that's our
[1:24:36] brother that's our
[1:24:39] brother he said we we we we fight in the
[1:24:43] backyard but we stand together in the
[1:24:46] front
[1:24:49] yard you
[1:24:50] don't the how does Satan uh destroy a
[1:24:55] army he gets it divided against itself
[1:24:59] gets it criticizing itself gets it
[1:25:01] taking sides take sides with this
[1:25:04] Doctrine take sides with that Doctrine
[1:25:06] take sides with this approach this is
[1:25:09] the way this this church does this this
[1:25:12] is the way this church does that do this
[1:25:14] church does it right this church does it
[1:25:19] better wait a
[1:25:21] minute every church is sovereign
[1:25:27] we don't we're not trying to
[1:25:30] denominate it isn't about it's about
[1:25:34] whether us as
[1:25:36] individuals whether you as an
[1:25:39] individual possess the love of
[1:25:43] God God so loved the
[1:25:46] world that when he projected his love he
[1:25:51] gave us his only begotten son that as
[1:25:54] many as believed on him had power to
[1:25:58] become the Sons and Daughters of
[1:26:02] God to possess that
[1:26:06] love that the father had for you and if
[1:26:10] you would turn in your Bibles and you
[1:26:12] would and we would look at the gospel of
[1:26:16] of uh St John in in the 17th chapter and
[1:26:22] the starting at the 20th verse
[1:26:25] uh I want you to see that this is
[1:26:29] something that Jesus
[1:26:33] possessed because if God so loved the
[1:26:37] world he gave his only begotten son then
[1:26:40] Jesus was the love of God Jesus
[1:26:44] possessed the love of God and so when he
[1:26:47] came across that blind
[1:26:51] man The Compassion that he had and the
[1:26:55] love that he had he caused him to go
[1:26:58] down and mix that mud and put it on his
[1:27:01] eyes and and and I love that Bible story
[1:27:05] I just love it I love the how that
[1:27:10] somebody could be so cold in their
[1:27:14] heart have such so caught up in the
[1:27:18] pride of what they believe so caught up
[1:27:21] in the pride of the stand that they take
[1:27:25] so filled with such
[1:27:30] self-righteousness you know my
[1:27:31] interpretation right my vision's right
[1:27:34] the way that I interpret things is right
[1:27:37] the way I believe is right that actually
[1:27:40] they could take no
[1:27:43] joy and a a boy that been blind all his
[1:27:48] life now he was he was old enough to
[1:27:50] speak for himself in our country we'd
[1:27:53] say was 18 then it might be 12 I don't
[1:27:57] know but he he
[1:28:02] sees and they couldn't even lift their
[1:28:04] hand to go praise God this boy sees God
[1:28:09] is with
[1:28:11] Israel no they were so jealous that they
[1:28:14] didn't do
[1:28:18] it that they could take no joy in it
[1:28:24] they they
[1:28:28] lacked they they didn't
[1:28:31] possess the
[1:28:33] compassion that Jesus had they didn't
[1:28:37] possess the feeling that Jesus had for
[1:28:40] that boy oh his mama sinned his daddy
[1:28:45] sinned it's the sins visiting oh I don't
[1:28:48] want you know if you take that judgment
[1:28:50] seat that's the Judgment seat that
[1:28:52] you're going to be judged by
[1:28:57] he told us when somebody somebody
[1:28:59] something befalls somebody you don't all
[1:29:03] of a sudden say oh there's a reason
[1:29:04] behind that you know I know why they got
[1:29:06] in that
[1:29:08] wreck you know I know why they lost
[1:29:10] their
[1:29:11] job great
[1:29:14] discerners of
[1:29:17] life you
[1:29:21] know you just you you sit back and you
[1:29:25] think what's happened to
[1:29:27] people we don't we don't need to sit in
[1:29:29] the Judgment seat of one another we
[1:29:31] don't need to be comparing ourselves one
[1:29:34] to another it's not about that what is
[1:29:36] it to you if he terries till I come
[1:29:39] follow thou
[1:29:42] me I want to know that I have and
[1:29:47] possess the greatest thing a Christian
[1:29:50] can possess and that's the love of God
[1:29:53] shed abroad in My Heart by the Holy
[1:29:57] Ghost that's what every
[1:30:00] believer ought to be contending for no
[1:30:05] bitterness no hatred no vile words no
[1:30:10] backbiting why the scripture says what's
[1:30:13] wrong with us we we you're devouring one
[1:30:20] another it gets to be like a cancer
[1:30:27] you know I don't care what's going on I
[1:30:30] I I I do not step into this Pulpit
[1:30:33] preaching to anybody who's online if you
[1:30:36] want to know what I believe I don't
[1:30:38] believe in online
[1:30:41] preaching we have it because of covid
[1:30:44] and we have it because some of our
[1:30:46] people can't make
[1:30:49] it but when if you staying home when you
[1:30:52] could be in the house of the Lord don't
[1:30:55] count that as a mark for
[1:30:59] you it's evidence against
[1:31:05] you
[1:31:08] and I just don't want to get out there I
[1:31:11] don't want to be caught up in all the
[1:31:13] fussing I don't want to be caught up in
[1:31:15] all the fighting I don't want to be come
[1:31:17] up in all the doctrinal explanations in
[1:31:20] anything I want to follow the word of
[1:31:23] God Amen
[1:31:24] I want to take sides with the word I
[1:31:27] want to stay with the message of the
[1:31:29] hour that's why we played this this
[1:31:31] morning because our messenger telling us
[1:31:34] don't go
[1:31:37] there you don't need to figure out who's
[1:31:40] right and who's
[1:31:46] wrong if you stay with the word of God
[1:31:48] you find out that in the word of God all
[1:31:51] things are covered you know the prophet
[1:31:53] of God said that sometimes God allow a
[1:31:55] preacher to go out astray what seemingly
[1:31:58] is astray just to go out somewhere that
[1:32:02] he might pick somebody up and bring them
[1:32:05] back
[1:32:09] in now could you imagine me somebody
[1:32:11] going oh that preacher's off on a false
[1:32:13] Doctrine he's going down the wrong road
[1:32:16] he's doing all this all this and all the
[1:32:18] time it's God right that's what they did
[1:32:22] oh this guy's blinding because who
[1:32:24] sinned his parents his grandparents all
[1:32:27] this everybody wanted to know why did
[1:32:29] this curse come and the whole reason he
[1:32:32] was blind is that the glory of God might
[1:32:35] be manifested what side of that judgment
[1:32:39] would you have wanted to been
[1:32:45] on would you like your
[1:32:48] opinion to have fallen on the side that
[1:32:52] his family was sinners
[1:32:58] that's what the Pharisees said you were
[1:33:00] all together born in sin that's right in
[1:33:04] other words they said you were born
[1:33:06] blind that was the result of sin Jesus
[1:33:10] saying no it's not he was been born
[1:33:14] blind that the glory of God might be
[1:33:18] manifested now the only way you would
[1:33:21] have been able to make that judgment and
[1:33:24] that discernment is if you possessed the
[1:33:27] love of
[1:33:32] God cuz you wouldn't be thinking no
[1:33:37] evil so it's the greatest possession
[1:33:40] that the believer in St John 17 Jesus
[1:33:44] says
[1:33:46] this the 20th verse he says neither pray
[1:33:49] I for these
[1:33:51] alone but for them also which Shall
[1:33:54] Believe on me through their
[1:33:58] word
[1:34:00] hallelujah I like that scripture because
[1:34:02] it places me in every scripture in the
[1:34:09] Bible it makes every word in that book
[1:34:13] for me I don't have to put an age on it
[1:34:16] I don't have to put history on it I
[1:34:18] don't have to say this days are gone
[1:34:20] these days aren't gone no I believed it
[1:34:23] I received it by their
[1:34:27] word and Jesus
[1:34:29] prayed for me that's
[1:34:33] right and this is what he prayed for
[1:34:36] me and I and I believe it was placed in
[1:34:40] that order so we could grab a hold of
[1:34:45] it this is what he's praying for all
[1:34:47] them that believe on me through their
[1:34:50] words this is what I'm praying that they
[1:34:52] have that they all all of us them and
[1:34:57] the US that
[1:34:59] believed that they all might be
[1:35:09] one no not we're
[1:35:15] here of this city or of this ministry I
[1:35:21] go to Brother David mcgary's Church no
[1:35:24] you don't you go to your
[1:35:30] church it's not mine it's
[1:35:36] yours and if you're sitting here not
[1:35:40] believing it's yours not believing that
[1:35:43] it's your body it's your brothers and
[1:35:47] sisters it's your care it's
[1:35:51] your it it it's your ministry
[1:35:54] it's your works it's your
[1:35:59] concerned then you are you're you're
[1:36:02] you're in a denominational
[1:36:06] mindset this isn't
[1:36:08] about we're here and we're there and and
[1:36:12] and we're under this ministry we're
[1:36:14] under that Ministry well I'll tell you
[1:36:17] something let me let it be known where
[1:36:19] but this is my
[1:36:22] absolute yes
[1:36:24] that's right you put these together and
[1:36:27] you have the interpretation of this book
[1:36:31] you can't read this book without reading
[1:36:33] it through this this is the
[1:36:38] code the spiritual code that makes this
[1:36:42] come
[1:36:43] [Music]
[1:36:46] alive the letter
[1:36:49] kth but divine revelation Faith which
[1:36:53] cometh by hearing brings this to life
[1:36:56] quickens
[1:36:58] it that's what we're one with that's
[1:37:01] what we're taking sides with we're not
[1:37:04] taking sides with a Ministry we're not
[1:37:06] taking sides with a type of preaching
[1:37:08] we're not taking sides with an approach
[1:37:11] we're not taking sides with worship or
[1:37:13] how somebody worships whether this guy
[1:37:15] has drums or doesn't have drums we're
[1:37:18] not taking sides with that we're taking
[1:37:20] sides with Jesus
[1:37:25] the word of God you do that within
[1:37:33] yourself either you love him or you
[1:37:39] don't he who loves the world and the
[1:37:42] things of the world does not possess the
[1:37:45] love of
[1:37:48] God the greatest thing you can
[1:37:52] possess is love of
[1:37:56] God and I'm not talking about your love
[1:38:01] of
[1:38:02] God I'm talking about you possessing
[1:38:06] God's
[1:38:08] love let's read on
[1:38:11] further if if you would bear with me for
[1:38:13] a few more
[1:38:17] moments that they be me one
[1:38:19] father that thou art in me and and I in
[1:38:25] thee that they also may be one in us
[1:38:31] that the world may believe that thou
[1:38:34] Hast sent
[1:38:37] me now how in the world are we going to
[1:38:39] tell the world about Jesus when we're
[1:38:42] devouring one
[1:38:46] another when we've got to where we're
[1:38:51] arguing about doctrines and gifts and
[1:38:55] and and all kinds of
[1:38:58] stuff where we've turned our eyes on one
[1:39:02] another instead of turning our eyes on
[1:39:04] the
[1:39:05] lost the sick sir and the needy visiting
[1:39:10] the Widow and their affle Affliction the
[1:39:13] fatherless and the
[1:39:15] homeless go being compelled to go the
[1:39:19] mile turning the other
[1:39:21] cheek what what what
[1:39:27] you know that's what he said why the
[1:39:28] disciples were
[1:39:30] arguing oh who's going to be the
[1:39:32] greatest who's going to sit at the table
[1:39:35] who's going to say that I'm closest to
[1:39:38] him oh I'm closest to the prophet I I'm
[1:39:41] closest to his Doctrine I I I I'm I know
[1:39:45] more what he understands and teaches
[1:39:47] than than anybody
[1:39:50] else you're dead
[1:39:55] I think you spell it d e a d dead dead
[1:40:01] in unbelief and don't know
[1:40:09] it not about all that it's about
[1:40:15] possessing the same
[1:40:17] love that he
[1:40:20] had let us read
[1:40:27] and the glory which thou givest
[1:40:32] me I have given
[1:40:35] them that they may be one even as we are
[1:40:43] one the glory he gave us the spirit of
[1:40:46] God that he poured out on us was never
[1:40:49] given that we might receive Glory
[1:40:54] that we might receive
[1:40:57] accolades that we might receive
[1:41:00] spiritual judgment you're
[1:41:04] spiritual you're more spiritual your
[1:41:07] church is more spiritual our church is
[1:41:10] more
[1:41:13] spiritual I'm telling you Church there's
[1:41:16] a
[1:41:18] sickness in the land
[1:41:23] the love of God is dying
[1:41:30] out people are receiving Doctrine
[1:41:33] without
[1:41:34] possessing The
[1:41:38] Giver the greatest
[1:41:41] possession that you could have as a
[1:41:46] Christian above
[1:41:49] anything above
[1:41:51] Joy above above
[1:41:55] peace above
[1:41:57] anything is the love of
[1:42:02] God the same love that could love you as
[1:42:05] a sinner as vile as you were and still
[1:42:09] come down and pay the price for your
[1:42:12] sins and then once you receive that love
[1:42:16] then that love ought to return back into
[1:42:19] a life worthy of the Gospel don't keep
[1:42:22] telling me how much he loves me and then
[1:42:25] you just do all the stuff that you do
[1:42:28] you're a
[1:42:34] hypocrite the best thing we could
[1:42:37] possess is the love of
[1:42:40] God devouring somebody doesn't make you
[1:42:48] something like taking a baseball bat and
[1:42:51] and going to all your team members in
[1:42:55] basketball there's
[1:42:57] five and maybe you go out there and you
[1:42:59] hit all the other four guys on the head
[1:43:01] with the bat and they're laying on the
[1:43:03] ground and you can say I'm the only one
[1:43:06] standing I'm the best player here I'm
[1:43:09] number
[1:43:11] one but you know what you end up
[1:43:15] losing you lose the great battle you
[1:43:18] lose the great
[1:43:21] race what do you think say Satan's
[1:43:23] trying to
[1:43:25] do he's trying to create confusion he's
[1:43:29] trying to create bitterness he's trying
[1:43:32] to get us to disbelieve he's trying to
[1:43:34] get us our eyes off the greatest thing
[1:43:36] that we have the greatest thing we have
[1:43:39] is we know that you they'll know that
[1:43:42] you are my disciples by your love one
[1:43:45] for
[1:43:46] another it's the identification of a
[1:43:49] Christian it's never been doctrin
[1:43:54] some people just are not mentally
[1:43:56] capable or spiritually positioned to
[1:44:00] receive and understand certain
[1:44:06] doctrines and if you're going to destroy
[1:44:09] him because of
[1:44:10] that because you think you're more
[1:44:15] exalted cuz you can explain this and you
[1:44:17] can explain that I'm telling you you're
[1:44:20] on the wrong road
[1:44:29] he didn't do that he gave us the glory
[1:44:33] for one thing that the love of God could
[1:44:36] be shed abroad in our heart by the holy
[1:44:38] spirit that we might be one that we
[1:44:41] might cover one for another that we
[1:44:44] might lift one another up well what
[1:44:47] what's happened today we've got the
[1:44:49] polls
[1:44:52] out everybody's got a pole pushing
[1:44:54] somebody in the
[1:44:57] ditch what good does that
[1:45:02] do it it seemingly that one time Silas
[1:45:06] and Barnabas and some of them maybe they
[1:45:09] had a little stripe or something in the
[1:45:10] scripture so they decided to go it
[1:45:13] wasn't maybe overd doctrin but one was
[1:45:16] pressed with a
[1:45:18] need to go a certain direction and the
[1:45:22] other one was press with a need to go a
[1:45:24] different direction and and they parted
[1:45:28] ways but down the road they remained
[1:45:32] one you don't hear Paul going on saying
[1:45:35] don't you listen to those two guys you
[1:45:37] know you better not go listen to that
[1:45:39] you better not listen to this or do that
[1:45:42] or have anything to do with those guys
[1:45:47] no later on they says hey send that guy
[1:45:50] here I need what he has to offer I need
[1:45:55] his ministry I need his gift I need his
[1:45:59] inspiration I need his
[1:46:01] anointing you know the very person that
[1:46:04] you might criticize one day you might
[1:46:09] need and are you going to burn the
[1:46:11] bridge that they can get across to help
[1:46:17] you are you going to become so bitter in
[1:46:20] your heart that there's no way back back
[1:46:23] for
[1:46:24] them and you heard our Prophet say it
[1:46:27] they cast him out and Jesus found him
[1:46:32] again we heard him say it brother they
[1:46:35] cast me out but don't worry Jesus will
[1:46:38] find me again Hallelujah this was
[1:46:43] 1962 Jesus found him again he put a
[1:46:46] sword in his hand and open the seals
[1:46:54] that's
[1:46:56] right I wouldn't want to said
[1:46:59] nothing sometimes it's good just to wait
[1:47:02] and pray but let's just finish our
[1:47:04] scripture and I'm going to try to move
[1:47:06] on are you all
[1:47:09] okay if if I if I get long feel free
[1:47:13] just to to go ahead and step
[1:47:16] out it says he says that that they may
[1:47:20] be one even as We Are One
[1:47:23] what was Jesus's description of the way
[1:47:26] he and the father were
[1:47:28] one I do
[1:47:31] nothing unless the father first reveals
[1:47:36] it there's no virtue in
[1:47:42] criticism
[1:47:45] listen I am
[1:47:47] them and thou in
[1:47:50] me that they may
[1:47:54] that they may be made perfect in
[1:48:03] one you're not going to be perfect
[1:48:06] without the person sitting next to
[1:48:08] you without you being able to love them
[1:48:12] care for them nourish them pray for
[1:48:16] them you will never be perfect without
[1:48:19] them
[1:48:26] and that the world may
[1:48:28] know that thou hath sent
[1:48:32] me and hath loved
[1:48:36] them as thou hath loved
[1:48:45] me that that
[1:48:48] is what is so important
[1:48:53] to take sides with
[1:48:56] Jesus I want to talk about the
[1:48:59] possession of
[1:49:02] love for a
[1:49:07] moment that if that's the greatest thing
[1:49:11] a Believer could
[1:49:13] have is to have their life their
[1:49:17] motivation their thoughts their
[1:49:21] actions
[1:49:24] driven by the love of
[1:49:30] God when they meet
[1:49:33] somebody that you could look past that
[1:49:36] first
[1:49:38] impression you could look past their
[1:49:41] social
[1:49:44] standing you could look
[1:49:47] past everything about their outside
[1:49:50] appearance and have such a love that
[1:49:54] penetrated past all
[1:49:58] that that you could have some sort of
[1:50:02] feeling some sort of
[1:50:06] compassion if you could have something
[1:50:08] that that you
[1:50:10] possessed that was such a Guiding Light
[1:50:14] in your
[1:50:16] life that when you looked out you could
[1:50:20] find the need
[1:50:24] that somebody hasn't been walking by you
[1:50:26] day after day that's been
[1:50:29] hungry that hasn't been able to pay
[1:50:31] their light bill hasn't been able to
[1:50:34] have gas in their
[1:50:38] car and yet you're moved by the
[1:50:42] spirit the love of God in you becomes
[1:50:47] mindful of
[1:50:50] that that your antenna the love antenna
[1:50:54] just picks up on the needs around
[1:50:59] you you don't care about your social
[1:51:02] standing that's
[1:51:04] right you're not worried about what
[1:51:06] people think about you that's
[1:51:11] right can you imagine somebody coming to
[1:51:14] the Judgment seat and they say well wait
[1:51:16] a minute Lord I was picked number one in
[1:51:19] the overall draft
[1:51:23] I made the allar
[1:51:25] team I had 40 million
[1:51:32] followers
[1:51:37] huh but Jesus is going to say when I was
[1:51:40] sick you didn't visit
[1:51:44] me I never knew
[1:51:47] you I never saw myself in you I had no
[1:51:54] identification with
[1:51:56] you oh you were great in
[1:51:59] Doctrine you're a theologian above all
[1:52:03] theologians you understood all the
[1:52:05] Mysteries you spoke with the men of
[1:52:07] tongues and
[1:52:10] Angels you've done all these
[1:52:14] things but I I couldn't identify with
[1:52:18] you I couldn't find myself in you I
[1:52:22] couldn't find my
[1:52:25] love in your
[1:52:30] heart what do you think you're going to
[1:52:32] be judged
[1:52:36] by there's a lot of good people that
[1:52:39] don't see what you
[1:52:40] see you don't see it because you came
[1:52:43] upon it yourself that's you see it by
[1:52:46] the grace and mercy and love of God then
[1:52:51] why do we exalt ourselves as though we
[1:52:54] have not received it but let's just read
[1:52:57] in Corinthians once again we'll go to
[1:53:01] the 13th chapter of Corinthians and I
[1:53:05] want to approach this a little different
[1:53:07] this
[1:53:08] morning because I I I'm not saying that
[1:53:14] you don't possess the love of God I
[1:53:18] believe you wouldn't be here your love
[1:53:20] for God has br brought you here but we
[1:53:24] want to go to a higher level if I could
[1:53:27] say that and that's the love of God
[1:53:30] resting upon you in the form of a
[1:53:35] Capstone the crowning of your
[1:53:40] life the crowning of your
[1:53:43] existence giving the final full
[1:53:47] purpose of why that God put you in this
[1:53:50] world you say why was I born why was I
[1:53:55] put here why do I go through the things
[1:53:58] that I go through that the love of
[1:54:01] God might abide with you and in you and
[1:54:08] shine out of
[1:54:11] you that's why you're here
[1:54:18] amen may I approach this in a way this
[1:54:23] morning to put
[1:54:26] emphasis on what it is that I'm trying
[1:54:29] to say each of you myself
[1:54:34] included
[1:54:37] individually have got to take a look in
[1:54:40] the mirror and say is the love of God
[1:54:44] abiding in me not my love for him but is
[1:54:49] the love that he is cu God is love
[1:54:53] is that love that Glory that spirit is
[1:54:58] it in my
[1:55:01] heart and how is it being
[1:55:09] demonstrated a lot of people take the
[1:55:11] book of
[1:55:13] Corinthians and they substitute the word
[1:55:16] charity for
[1:55:18] love and I don't want to do that this
[1:55:21] morning
[1:55:22] because if I do that this morning you
[1:55:25] we're going to
[1:55:28] miss I believe a great portion of what
[1:55:32] Paul is speaking
[1:55:35] about so I'd like to do it like this
[1:55:43] love is the
[1:55:47] noun how many of you took English
[1:55:53] does anybody know what a noun is a noun
[1:55:56] is the
[1:55:58] identity of
[1:56:00] something
[1:56:02] Dylan noun
[1:56:06] Dylan this is
[1:56:10] Dylan it's the it's the
[1:56:14] identity of
[1:56:16] something okay it stands alone alls it
[1:56:20] is is an identification
[1:56:23] love God is
[1:56:25] love now
[1:56:28] charity is the
[1:56:33] verb okay a verb is used to
[1:56:38] describe
[1:56:41] action love is the noun charity is the
[1:56:46] verb love is the
[1:56:49] substance charity is the action
[1:56:52] of that
[1:56:57] substance you could say
[1:57:01] poison that's the
[1:57:04] noun but what's the action of
[1:57:07] poison
[1:57:11] death this is what poison does this is
[1:57:14] what it is this is what it
[1:57:18] does poison is the description
[1:57:22] death is the
[1:57:24] verb love is the
[1:57:28] substance charity is what that that love
[1:57:35] does so you can't
[1:57:37] separate
[1:57:40] love love is a substance faith is a
[1:57:45] substance is something that's
[1:57:49] possess you can realize that you have it
[1:57:53] and you can realize that it's working in
[1:57:57] you faith that worketh by
[1:58:01] love it's something
[1:58:03] that's that's
[1:58:08] real and that can be
[1:58:11] identified I know in school that they
[1:58:16] they have
[1:58:17] testing and and the reason that they
[1:58:20] they they test
[1:58:23] uh some's aptitude something I don't
[1:58:25] have the word for what the test is but
[1:58:27] they want to know how far along are
[1:58:31] you so they say if you're at a certain
[1:58:34] age or a certain grade level you should
[1:58:38] have accomplished or be able to
[1:58:41] accomplish these
[1:58:43] tasks there should be a performance
[1:58:47] level that identifies whether or not you
[1:58:51] have
[1:58:53] received what that you have been
[1:58:58] taught and so you you have a level of
[1:59:03] performance in sales they give it maybe
[1:59:05] they might call it a quota they think if
[1:59:08] you continue at what you're doing and
[1:59:10] you continue working as hard as you can
[1:59:13] because obviously your boss don't want
[1:59:15] you to slack off you know they want you
[1:59:17] to work
[1:59:18] harder but you should be able to meet
[1:59:21] this goal you should be able to be
[1:59:23] identified by by by the amount of work
[1:59:28] that you put put in should have a
[1:59:33] resolve well there should there's a way
[1:59:35] that you can
[1:59:39] determine whether the love that's in you
[1:59:42] is
[1:59:48] working whether it's in use
[1:59:54] or whether it's
[1:59:56] dormant and if my love's dormant I say
[2:00:00] oh
[2:00:02] God F
[2:00:05] me revive
[2:00:07] me breathe life in
[2:00:10] me that this love might be shed
[2:00:15] abroad I hope I've been able to lay this
[2:00:18] and let's read this together if you
[2:00:20] would
[2:00:23] he says though I
[2:00:25] speak with the tongues of men and of
[2:00:31] angels and have not
[2:00:33] charity I become as the sounding brass
[2:00:38] or a tinkling
[2:00:42] symbol he's already made a great
[2:00:45] separation between gifts and love
[2:00:52] it would be sad to think you could have
[2:00:54] one without the
[2:00:56] other that's why our messenger said I
[2:00:58] would rather have the right Spirit and
[2:01:01] the wrong
[2:01:03] Doctrine then the right Doctrine and the
[2:01:06] wrong
[2:01:10] Spirit he said I have become as a
[2:01:13] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol in
[2:01:17] other words I have it doesn't have any
[2:01:21] effect
[2:01:23] it's got no
[2:01:24] action it's dead in the
[2:01:29] water you can do all these things but if
[2:01:33] you don't have the genuine love of God
[2:01:35] shed abroad in your house it goes
[2:01:37] unnoticed it becomes completely
[2:01:42] ineffectual you might as well just ring
[2:01:44] a
[2:01:46] bell it's just
[2:01:50] noise but with love all things come to
[2:01:55] life because Love Is God and the love of
[2:02:00] God on the
[2:02:02] scene the love of God on the scene
[2:02:06] working is
[2:02:09] charity and though I have the gifts of
[2:02:15] Prophecy and understand all
[2:02:19] Mysteries and all knowledge
[2:02:22] and though I have all
[2:02:25] Faith so that I could move mountains and
[2:02:29] have not charity I am
[2:02:33] nothing we've read that for years and I
[2:02:36] believe it stands more clear this
[2:02:39] morning in actual reality of what's
[2:02:44] transpiring we have turned our eye to
[2:02:46] Major on
[2:02:49] mysteries on understandings
[2:02:52] and doctrines and our greatest
[2:02:58] possession has got put
[2:03:02] away when it should be the thing that's
[2:03:05] the most Forefront in our lives the very
[2:03:08] thing that we want the world to know
[2:03:10] that we
[2:03:12] have because not everybody understands
[2:03:15] tongues not under everybody understands
[2:03:18] Mysteries not everybody understands SE s
[2:03:22] not but but
[2:03:25] everybody will sense the love of God
[2:03:29] when it's
[2:03:32] there it's the most powerful thing that
[2:03:37] there
[2:03:41] is you you
[2:03:44] know when somebody loves
[2:03:48] you because it has a characteristic
[2:03:53] and love becomes
[2:03:57] worthless if it's not put into
[2:04:00] action if love doesn't have the verb of
[2:04:05] Charity it sits alone locked up and what
[2:04:10] God wants to do is he wants to unlock
[2:04:13] the love of God in your
[2:04:16] life
[2:04:20] amen and you have to turn a lot of cheek
[2:04:23] to do
[2:04:26] that you have to take a lot of
[2:04:29] criticism you have to be able to say
[2:04:32] there in the midst of all the suffering
[2:04:34] that's put upon you say father forgive
[2:04:37] them for they know not what they
[2:04:42] do it takes more character to
[2:04:48] love than it does to preach
[2:04:59] I am
[2:05:00] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[2:05:04] to feed the
[2:05:06] poor and though I give my body to be
[2:05:10] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[2:05:14] me
[2:05:17] nothing that church those are some
[2:05:20] tremendous
[2:05:22] eye
[2:05:24] openening in another words if I could
[2:05:26] say it this way this morning if you
[2:05:28] would allow me don't look on the wrong
[2:05:33] thing don't ask the wrong question it's
[2:05:38] not do I understand the Mysteries do I
[2:05:41] understand the seals am I bestowing my
[2:05:43] goods upon the poor am I doing all these
[2:05:46] things do I have all these work you're
[2:05:48] asking the wrong question the wrong
[2:05:51] question is is do I possess the love of
[2:05:55] God do I love you the way God loved me
[2:05:59] father that they might know that you
[2:06:03] have loved me and that you love
[2:06:07] them
[2:06:09] amen and when you know
[2:06:12] that if God be for you who can be
[2:06:15] against
[2:06:19] you when you know the footsteps of the
[2:06:21] righteous are ordered by the
[2:06:25] Lord when you know if you fall he'll
[2:06:27] pick you up as we're all prone to
[2:06:32] do don't use your brother as a stepping
[2:06:40] stone we've got way too many people want
[2:06:43] to be
[2:06:44] spokesmen
[2:06:45] nowadays I want to be the spokesman for
[2:06:48] the son of man movement I want to be be
[2:06:51] the spokesman for the bride coming of
[2:06:54] Christ I want to be the spokesman for
[2:06:56] the anti- emotional movement I want to
[2:06:59] be the spokesman for this and the
[2:07:01] spokesman for
[2:07:04] that it'd be a whole lot better if we
[2:07:06] were just a Spoke instead of a
[2:07:11] spokesman if we were just part of the
[2:07:14] wheel and did our part to keep it
[2:07:19] rolling let's don't get off
[2:07:23] church this bride this assembly that's
[2:07:29] here we're a local assembly we're
[2:07:32] Sovereign in
[2:07:35] ourselves we don't answer to
[2:07:37] nobody we answer to ourselves and to the
[2:07:41] word of
[2:07:43] God we're not comparing ourselves with
[2:07:46] anybody we are who we
[2:07:49] are we trust that you put
[2:07:53] here you're not obligated
[2:07:56] here if there's someplace you can be fed
[2:08:00] better the prophet of God said if a man
[2:08:02] really loved a woman he said and she
[2:08:05] knew that that another man would be
[2:08:08] better for her than him he would gladly
[2:08:14] see her
[2:08:19] go wouldn't be
[2:08:24] is no
[2:08:27] obligation it's hard to live
[2:08:30] here in Dallas for it
[2:08:34] word I would much rather be on an island
[2:08:38] somewhere or maybe in the low Hills of
[2:08:42] of low Hill lands of wyom or in
[2:08:47] Montana with the elk bugling and the
[2:08:50] deer running in the the
[2:08:52] anvelope forget the
[2:08:58] snow there there's a lot of
[2:09:02] places you say well then why are you
[2:09:04] here because the love of
[2:09:07] God is in my
[2:09:10] heart I didn't even want the love of
[2:09:15] God I never liked
[2:09:18] people I didn't like to be around people
[2:09:21] I didn't like to look at
[2:09:23] people in fact I don't believe there's
[2:09:25] going to be any people in
[2:09:29] heaven cuz people are
[2:09:34] tough but somebody was kind enough to
[2:09:38] pick me
[2:09:39] up out of the pits of
[2:09:44] hell and take me from the Sheep
[2:09:47] B and let me go around the world that's
[2:09:50] a love of
[2:09:53] God and when God does something like
[2:09:55] that he that's been forgiven much loves
[2:10:03] much but that's what you want to
[2:10:10] be what do we want to be this morning
[2:10:13] what does Christian Life Tabernacle want
[2:10:15] to be do we want to hate every church
[2:10:18] that don't believe the way we believe do
[2:10:20] we want to put put down every Minister
[2:10:22] that don't say it the way we say it
[2:10:25] shame on
[2:10:29] us they're my
[2:10:33] brothers they're doing what God wants
[2:10:35] them to do may they be
[2:10:40] successful May every sheep that God puts
[2:10:43] in their flock may they be fed may they
[2:10:46] be healthy may they bear wool might the
[2:10:50] world know that that we have God has
[2:10:52] sent his son Jesus Christ and that we
[2:10:55] have love one for another and the love
[2:10:57] of God is shed abroad in our heart by
[2:10:59] the Holy Ghost shame on them who are
[2:11:02] bringing such a disgrace to this message
[2:11:05] with their
[2:11:09] bitterness and they're
[2:11:15] arguing very rarely have you ever heard
[2:11:17] me stand up here and give you a list and
[2:11:21] a Litany of the things that I've seen
[2:11:24] God
[2:11:28] do you don't think I've seen Miracles
[2:11:31] you don't think I've seen Devils cast
[2:11:33] out you don't think I've seen spirits
[2:11:36] and clouds and black clouds and all
[2:11:38] those things but who does that give the
[2:11:40] glory
[2:11:43] to what's that
[2:11:48] about this is the only thing
[2:11:52] thing that's going to get you
[2:11:55] there is when this makes the love of God
[2:12:00] come alive in your heart and you love
[2:12:03] God more than you do the things of the
[2:12:05] world all these things we will do if
[2:12:09] God's host permits every single one of
[2:12:11] you has the power to lay hands on the
[2:12:14] sick and have them
[2:12:16] recover you just need the love to
[2:12:19] motivate you to do it
[2:12:23] I'm not angry I I I always feel bad when
[2:12:26] I get done preaching because I have
[2:12:29] to but I'm not saying it in Anger let's
[2:12:32] just
[2:12:34] read the
[2:12:36] verb of Love Is
[2:12:39] Charity so Paul's saying this is what
[2:12:42] love
[2:12:45] does if you have love this is what the
[2:12:49] verb this is what ch charity does
[2:12:52] charity has these
[2:12:54] characteristics charity is the
[2:12:56] characteristic of love and
[2:12:59] action so he says
[2:13:02] this charity suffereth
[2:13:08] long charity gives somebody a time to
[2:13:11] correct
[2:13:13] themselves charity gives time for
[2:13:16] someone to find their way charity isn't
[2:13:19] right on top of them
[2:13:22] in construction you know we we kind of
[2:13:25] have a way that we do things if you have
[2:13:28] somebody pick up a pair of Channel
[2:13:30] loocks you're waiting right there for
[2:13:33] them to put those Chanel loocks on
[2:13:36] backwards and you're going to say
[2:13:38] they're upside down turning them around
[2:13:41] there's no
[2:13:47] longsuffering if they got the wrong bit
[2:13:50] in their drill moment boy you wrong bit
[2:13:53] that's a number three not a number two
[2:13:55] no's no longsuffering you're not going
[2:13:56] to wait for him to say oh number two I
[2:13:59] got to get a number three oh no you're
[2:14:01] going to let him know you got
[2:14:07] them that's
[2:14:09] construction that's the attribute of
[2:14:12] construction everybody trying to show
[2:14:15] everybody that they know something so
[2:14:17] you can gain confidence in one
[2:14:19] another but that's not charity that's
[2:14:22] right charity gives time give him time
[2:14:26] to turn them over he'll find
[2:14:29] out right next time he knows that the
[2:14:32] bottom goes on the bottom and the top
[2:14:34] goes on the top you always push towards
[2:14:36] your the bottom of your Chanel loock did
[2:14:39] anybody need a Chanel loock lesson this
[2:14:43] morning does anybody know what channel
[2:14:45] loocks
[2:14:47] are but you should know what charity is
[2:14:52] you should know that it's
[2:14:54] longsuffering that it bears and allows
[2:14:58] somebody to make adjustments in their
[2:15:01] life to make a wrong
[2:15:04] turn and to find their way
[2:15:15] back and is kind
[2:15:21] it's
[2:15:23] kind and there it doesn't say hurtful
[2:15:27] things it says good
[2:15:30] things it finds the good and not the
[2:15:34] mistake it's not hey man you're you're
[2:15:36] really doing bad no you're kind hey you
[2:15:39] did good on that that was good I see
[2:15:42] you're doing better it's
[2:15:46] kind it it it's the attribute of it so
[2:15:50] Paul's saying if I do all these things
[2:15:52] and I'm not longsuffering if I do all
[2:15:55] these things and I'm not
[2:16:03] kind he
[2:16:05] says as he says here he
[2:16:08] says charity envieth
[2:16:13] not it's not envy of what somebody else
[2:16:16] has you know why CU you possess the
[2:16:20] greatest thing if I had my
[2:16:24] coin my million dooll coin you think I'm
[2:16:28] going to be envious because you have a
[2:16:32] 1978 I got the granddaddy of them
[2:16:37] all it don't matter if you've got
[2:16:39] everything I've got it I've got the
[2:16:43] pearl of great price I've got the
[2:16:46] treasure in the field I've got it man if
[2:16:49] I had that Co Co I would be in the
[2:16:52] Kingdom of coin collectors I would be
[2:16:55] the prince I wouldn't even need to have
[2:16:58] any other coin I've got
[2:17:02] it I got the
[2:17:07] granddaddy do you have a coin collection
[2:17:09] yeah really how many coins you got
[2:17:13] one one yeah 19 such and suchen oh
[2:17:19] Hallelujah
[2:17:24] it settles
[2:17:26] it it's not envious it's not envious of
[2:17:30] what other people have it's not envious
[2:17:33] of their Fame it's not envious of their
[2:17:35] influence it's not envious of their body
[2:17:38] shape it's not envious of the color of
[2:17:41] their hair it's not envious of their
[2:17:44] wardrobe where's all this junk coming
[2:17:49] from we we heard it today the
[2:17:56] devil devil don't care what you know he
[2:17:59] just don't want you to
[2:18:03] love he
[2:18:10] said he
[2:18:12] said
[2:18:14] charity vanth not itself and there words
[2:18:18] it doesn't boast about itself
[2:18:22] I've done this and I did that and and uh
[2:18:26] it doesn't run itself down
[2:18:29] either how can you run yourself down and
[2:18:33] be speaking good of the love that God
[2:18:37] has
[2:18:37] placed in the way he loves
[2:18:42] you you know maybe I'm maybe I'm no
[2:18:46] good but there's one thing I know he
[2:18:49] loves me
[2:18:52] and that's more powerful in all my
[2:18:55] failures it's not puffed
[2:18:58] up it doesn't B itself it doesn't run
[2:19:01] itself down it doesn't lift itself up it
[2:19:04] just lets that love
[2:19:06] move charity is the moving of the love
[2:19:10] of God in your
[2:19:13] life it's the
[2:19:16] verb that's why when you read this you
[2:19:18] can't say Love Is Love Is Love Is cuz
[2:19:21] Paul's not saying love is he's saying if
[2:19:24] you possess love you are you are you are
[2:19:28] you are you are these things you are
[2:19:31] doing these things this is you in action
[2:19:34] this is the way you live this is the way
[2:19:36] you think this is the way you treat
[2:19:40] people you say oh brother mcgar that's
[2:19:42] not a great mystery when I'm preaching
[2:19:44] you this morning is greater than the
[2:19:47] full understanding of the seventh seal
[2:19:56] and I know what it's like to believe the
[2:19:58] seventh seal is opened when nobody else
[2:20:06] did that don't get you
[2:20:10] nothing but I know one thing that gets
[2:20:12] you
[2:20:13] everything and that's the love of
[2:20:17] God let's continue and just talk about
[2:20:20] it
[2:20:25] it's not puffed
[2:20:27] up does not behave itself
[2:20:33] unseemingly love is very conscious of
[2:20:35] its
[2:20:37] actions of the words that it speaks the
[2:20:40] things that it
[2:20:42] says very
[2:20:44] careful I've made statements in my past
[2:20:47] that today when I think about it I get
[2:20:50] embarrassed all all over again jokes
[2:20:52] that I've
[2:20:54] told that I didn't realize to some
[2:20:57] people were very
[2:21:01] hurtful oh it might got a
[2:21:03] chuckle from a few
[2:21:07] Knuckleheads but they never should have
[2:21:09] come out of the mouth of a
[2:21:17] Believer seeketh not her own
[2:21:25] it's not you
[2:21:26] first right it's you
[2:21:32] last you ever see those people that boy
[2:21:34] they want to make sure they get that
[2:21:36] last piece of cake on the
[2:21:42] plate but they're just going to grab
[2:21:44] that last piece of cake you know boy you
[2:21:48] can start seeing them across the room
[2:21:50] here they come
[2:21:52] they're on their way who's going to get
[2:21:54] it I've seen lesie all of a sudden
[2:21:56] people she says oh don't worry there's
[2:22:01] more everybody's
[2:22:04] happy does you don't you're not worried
[2:22:06] about
[2:22:09] you I'm going to move quickly here and
[2:22:11] then finish
[2:22:13] up does not behave itself unseemly
[2:22:17] seeketh not her
[2:22:18] own is not e easily provoked
[2:22:23] thinketh no
[2:22:26] evil
[2:22:29] now you can judge whether you have
[2:22:34] possessed something by the
[2:22:36] characteristics of
[2:22:39] it you don't think there's fake coins
[2:22:42] out
[2:22:46] there there's a way you can judge
[2:22:48] whether it's fake or not
[2:22:53] there's experts that know whether it's
[2:22:56] fake or
[2:22:59] not there's nothing worse than buying a
[2:23:03] fake there's nothing worse than fake
[2:23:07] religion look at these
[2:23:10] things they're the
[2:23:12] characteristics and the description of
[2:23:15] your
[2:23:16] possession these are the title deed to
[2:23:19] love the these are the boundaries the
[2:23:22] descriptions of the
[2:23:25] property I know I have love because I
[2:23:28] these things are working in
[2:23:31] me I'm not working them it's the love
[2:23:35] that's in me is working them I I I I'm
[2:23:39] just the opposite of this without the
[2:23:42] love of God I'm puffed up I think about
[2:23:45] myself I take care of my own
[2:23:48] self I'm totally opposite without the
[2:23:51] love of God you must have the love of
[2:23:54] God without perfect love you will not be
[2:24:00] there it's the
[2:24:04] ticket it's above all
[2:24:09] things it it think of though it
[2:24:12] rejoiceth not in
[2:24:16] iniquity if someone's teaching something
[2:24:18] wrong you don't rejoice was in that you
[2:24:21] don't blow it out of the water you don't
[2:24:24] jump all over it what's all that
[2:24:27] about you love that person you know what
[2:24:30] you do you give them the benefit of the
[2:24:32] doubt you say oh they might have went
[2:24:34] this way for a while but they're my
[2:24:36] brother they'll be back they're just
[2:24:39] going there to swing to pick up a few
[2:24:41] people so that they can bring them back
[2:24:43] around God's leading their life he's LED
[2:24:45] their lives for years you don't have to
[2:24:48] worry about it it's all okay
[2:24:50] [Music]
[2:24:53] I just believe he's doing exactly what
[2:24:54] God wants him to
[2:24:56] do you don't have to speak evil of it
[2:24:58] you don't have to give your two cents
[2:25:03] judgment take care of
[2:25:06] yourself make sure love is in yourself
[2:25:09] is that the alarm that says I'm
[2:25:11] preaching too
[2:25:14] long it's mine went off the other day so
[2:25:19] I know what it's like
[2:25:21] it says it rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[2:25:24] rejoiceth in the
[2:25:30] truth beareth all things believeth all
[2:25:35] things hopeth all things endureth all
[2:25:39] things these are all these are all
[2:25:42] things that all of a sudden this is what
[2:25:44] you become this is what you're doing
[2:25:50] cuz without
[2:25:51] this everything else that you have has
[2:25:54] no quality and no
[2:25:56] character and power apart from character
[2:26:00] is
[2:26:02] satanic charity never
[2:26:05] faileth and then we could go on where
[2:26:07] there's prophecies and tongues they
[2:26:11] fail
[2:26:14] and but we're talking
[2:26:17] about The Possession
[2:26:20] of
[2:26:21] love and I want to say this this morning
[2:26:25] in
[2:26:27] closing
[2:26:29] that part of what love of God is and
[2:26:34] God's love for you is recognizing what
[2:26:38] God has done for
[2:26:40] you now we're all believers here and
[2:26:46] we've listened to many tapes together
[2:26:49] and we understand that God has done
[2:26:53] things and he's had a way of doing
[2:26:56] things and we understand the Book of
[2:27:00] Revelation is the revelation of Jesus
[2:27:04] Christ through the church ages and
[2:27:10] Beyond and we know that we've been
[2:27:13] taught that the seed Jesus told the
[2:27:18] church the seeds got to go into the
[2:27:22] ground cuz if the seed doesn't go in to
[2:27:25] the ground it will not rise
[2:27:29] again so he
[2:27:31] knew that what he planted at the day of
[2:27:35] Pentecost that original church that he
[2:27:39] endued with power from on high would go
[2:27:44] into the Dark
[2:27:48] Age and that it would be so perverted by
[2:27:52] men that
[2:27:54] Catholicism had ruled the world
[2:27:59] historically and every
[2:28:01] believer that manifest a spiritual gift
[2:28:05] they were stoned and burned at the stake
[2:28:09] and
[2:28:11] beheaded as
[2:28:14] witches and
[2:28:16] susers that the church had gained so
[2:28:19] much power
[2:28:21] that it begin to Snuff out anything that
[2:28:25] seemed to have any spiritual
[2:28:28] life and so it became so
[2:28:32] dark that they had a
[2:28:35] Vicor of Christ they had a pope that
[2:28:38] ruled over the church they had a
[2:28:41] succession and the scripture talks about
[2:28:43] us frogs and and and one coming up and
[2:28:46] we know all that in the Book of
[2:28:48] Revelations
[2:28:50] but we know according to the plan of God
[2:28:54] that there would come a time that that
[2:28:57] seed would Break
[2:29:00] Forth that it would come to life
[2:29:03] again and that the life would come out
[2:29:07] of the ground which was the darkness of
[2:29:10] the Catholic church and we begin to come
[2:29:14] forward and grow in
[2:29:17] life now so when that se broke forth it
[2:29:22] came forth in the first doctrine that
[2:29:26] was the strongest Doctrine against the
[2:29:29] mother Harlot was
[2:29:34] justification because the mother Harlot
[2:29:36] was making millions and millions of
[2:29:39] dollars by selling
[2:29:42] penants we know that in the book don't
[2:29:44] we about the seal and the penny and a
[2:29:47] weight of oil and and all that thing
[2:29:49] within the the framework of the seals
[2:29:51] book those of you who are reading your
[2:29:53] seals book and praying and listening to
[2:29:57] messages and so that seed began to come
[2:30:01] to life and the first Doctrine they said
[2:30:04] is
[2:30:06] Justified our all our sins were forgiven
[2:30:09] by one offering there's no more offering
[2:30:12] for
[2:30:13] sin he paid the price I don't have
[2:30:18] to and
[2:30:20] it was a devastating Doctrine to the
[2:30:23] great
[2:30:25] Harlot and a people came out from that
[2:30:30] and the reason they came out the reason
[2:30:32] that there they uh there was a people
[2:30:36] there to come out is because God planted
[2:30:39] a seed to manifest
[2:30:44] justification there was going to be a
[2:30:47] people that were called to be on earth
[2:30:51] at that time to manifest the message of
[2:30:55] justification they didn't know why they
[2:30:58] received it they didn't know why they
[2:31:00] heard it how come they heard
[2:31:02] justification how come they saw it how
[2:31:05] come it meant something to them and
[2:31:08] didn't mean anything to anybody else
[2:31:10] because it was the seed that was in them
[2:31:13] they were planted there for the purpose
[2:31:16] God predestinated them and put them
[2:31:19] there for the purpose of catching the
[2:31:23] revelation of
[2:31:25] justification and coming out from that
[2:31:28] Harlot and
[2:31:30] manifesting my sins were forgiven by the
[2:31:34] blood of the
[2:31:36] Lamb that's what they
[2:31:39] were they weren't going to go move on to
[2:31:43] sanctification they weren't put there to
[2:31:45] move on to
[2:31:46] sanctification they were put there for
[2:31:48] one purpose only
[2:31:50] and that was to manifest
[2:31:53] justification and they did it they
[2:31:57] manifested justification and they're
[2:32:00] still on Earth
[2:32:02] today manifesting
[2:32:05] justification and they're having
[2:32:08] children that manifest
[2:32:10] justification because once a seed is
[2:32:13] there it it it continues to to uh
[2:32:17] produce seed and that seed only can come
[2:32:20] forth after its kind so justification
[2:32:24] wasn't done away with justification
[2:32:27] still has children of justification
[2:32:29] there's still people being
[2:32:31] justified there's still people preaching
[2:32:34] justification are they my brothers
[2:32:38] yes do I love them yes do they have a
[2:32:43] purpose yes are they doing what God
[2:32:46] called them to do yes it's what they
[2:32:52] are they can't be something
[2:32:55] different I can't say why don't you see
[2:32:59] sanctification what's wrong with you
[2:33:01] they don't have anything in them to
[2:33:04] believe
[2:33:05] sanctification all they can do is be
[2:33:08] what they
[2:33:11] are am I going to be
[2:33:13] bitter am I going to rag on them am I
[2:33:17] going to point out their failure
[2:33:23] no I'm going to
[2:33:27] rejoice and we know then came
[2:33:30] sanctification as that plant began to go
[2:33:33] back to what it was before it went into
[2:33:36] the ground and sanctification come and
[2:33:39] there was a people that God planted
[2:33:42] there to be there to manifest
[2:33:47] sanctification that's what they were
[2:33:49] there for that's all they could do
[2:33:53] that's all they
[2:33:55] heard when they preached the gospel they
[2:33:57] saw
[2:33:58] sanctification they saw justification
[2:34:01] they saw sanctification the Justified
[2:34:03] seed didn't see sanctification but the
[2:34:06] Sanctified seed sought
[2:34:08] sanctification and that's what they
[2:34:12] believed and sanctification is still
[2:34:15] here sanctification is still producing
[2:34:19] sanctification seed there's still people
[2:34:22] that see the revelation of
[2:34:23] sanctification that's their religious
[2:34:26] experience you say well why don't they
[2:34:28] go on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:34:31] it's not in them to go on that's not
[2:34:34] what they were planted to do they're
[2:34:36] doing exactly what they were planed to
[2:34:39] do am I to say to the Potter why hast
[2:34:42] Thou made me thus or why have you made
[2:34:44] them
[2:34:45] thus that was him
[2:34:50] he wasn't going to do look justification
[2:34:53] still has to be there because
[2:34:55] sanctification is part of it the whole
[2:34:58] picture makes Christ Through the Ages
[2:35:01] you can't go chop this out chop this out
[2:35:03] chop this out and all of a say I hear
[2:35:05] I've got the
[2:35:07] seed no it's all part of the whole
[2:35:10] picture it's a whole part of the
[2:35:13] resurrection of the whole thing coming
[2:35:15] back to harvest
[2:35:18] life and then came
[2:35:20] [Music]
[2:35:21] restoration the baptism of the Holy
[2:35:24] Ghost the experience of the filling of
[2:35:28] the Holy Spirit and the restoration of
[2:35:32] gifts and there was people there that
[2:35:35] receive
[2:35:37] that that's what they are that's what
[2:35:41] they believe there's God in that there's
[2:35:45] life in that there's life in
[2:35:47] justification there's life in San s
[2:35:49] ification that course as the life moved
[2:35:54] on but you know it's just like it says
[2:35:57] in the scripture if you would just read
[2:35:59] that one scripture uh in Matthew
[2:36:02] 32 uh 13:52 it's a great little
[2:36:06] scripture for those that that that love
[2:36:10] Bible
[2:36:11] study and Jesus said this
[2:36:14] in Matthew
[2:36:17] 1352 he says then he said unto them
[2:36:21] therefore every
[2:36:23] scribe which is instructed into the
[2:36:27] Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man
[2:36:32] that is an
[2:36:34] householder which bringeth forth out of
[2:36:37] his treasures things new and
[2:36:44] old it's all part of the
[2:36:47] treasure and then there was there's
[2:36:51] people that that's what they were
[2:36:54] planted here to do that's what they
[2:36:58] are they're they're here to to perform
[2:37:02] that and show that that's
[2:37:05] real and and if and and that God moved
[2:37:10] and the the gifts are restored it's all
[2:37:13] part of
[2:37:15] it and then there was a people that were
[2:37:18] planted
[2:37:20] to have an invisible
[2:37:22] Union with the Heavenly bridegroom and
[2:37:26] the Earthly
[2:37:27] bride to be United with the word of
[2:37:32] God a people that were planted to be
[2:37:36] that
[2:37:39] Capstone to have that love to possess
[2:37:43] that on that statue of the perfect man
[2:37:46] to come up through all those ages and
[2:37:49] kindly come to the place that that's
[2:37:51] what they have they possess that love of
[2:37:54] God that's what they were planted
[2:37:57] for they weren't planted to manifest the
[2:38:00] gifts they weren't planted to manifest
[2:38:03] sanctification they weren't planted to
[2:38:05] manifest justification though they're
[2:38:07] all my
[2:38:08] brothers they're all part of the plan
[2:38:12] they're all fulfilling their
[2:38:15] role it's just that's not what I was
[2:38:18] planted for
[2:38:22] that's not what's in me to
[2:38:26] be I can only be what I've been planted
[2:38:30] to
[2:38:33] be and the desire of the seed that is in
[2:38:38] me is the love of
[2:38:44] God that's the fruit I want to have I
[2:38:48] want that c Capone I want to know what
[2:38:51] it
[2:38:52] means to have that
[2:38:55] love in my
[2:38:57] heart that all those
[2:39:01] verbs of Charity is working in me I'm
[2:39:05] not puffed up I'm not vth not myself I'm
[2:39:08] not envious I thinketh no evil I
[2:39:11] speaketh no evil I revile
[2:39:15] not that that can become a reality to me
[2:39:18] amen
[2:39:20] that I don't I can't it doesn't matter
[2:39:22] I'm not going to fuss with you over
[2:39:23] doctor I'm not going to fuss with you
[2:39:25] you love God that's what you believe
[2:39:27] praise God you're my brother Jesus
[2:39:29] Christ died for
[2:39:31] you Jesus says if thou believe on the
[2:39:34] Son of God that man Lou says I don't
[2:39:36] even know who he is I was
[2:39:38] blind before I
[2:39:42] saw Jesus say well I'm the
[2:39:47] one oh was that
[2:39:50] reunion Hallelujah the Thanksgiving can
[2:39:54] you imagine the love that flowed between
[2:39:56] those two him just loving Jesus thank
[2:39:59] you Jesus and Jesus just loving him just
[2:40:03] so embraced him and what that he had
[2:40:06] done for
[2:40:09] him may I say it again so
[2:40:14] embraced so full of the love for what
[2:40:18] Jesus had done done for
[2:40:20] him that it just radiated in
[2:40:24] him thank you I was blind I never saw my
[2:40:29] mama's face I never saw my daddy I never
[2:40:32] saw the
[2:40:34] temple I had
[2:40:36] heard but now I
[2:40:43] see I believe that's what I'm planted
[2:40:45] for
[2:40:50] I believe with all my heart that the
[2:40:53] message that God put in my
[2:40:56] heart to preach to the people that God's
[2:40:59] given me to preach
[2:41:03] to is that that love comes by hearing
[2:41:09] the word of God and the hearing of the
[2:41:12] word of God comes through the voice of
[2:41:14] the seventh angel messenger in this day
[2:41:20] and that's where I want my
[2:41:22] emphasis if if you desire justification
[2:41:26] there's lots of places to go and live in
[2:41:31] justification if you desire
[2:41:32] sanctification there's lots of places to
[2:41:35] go to live in
[2:41:38] sanctification it's good you'd be
[2:41:40] blessed there they're good works they're
[2:41:43] good
[2:41:44] churches they do a lot of good works for
[2:41:47] the community
[2:41:50] they're fine
[2:41:53] people there's fine Pentecostal churches
[2:41:56] all over the
[2:41:58] land good people holy people most of
[2:42:03] them living a lot holier than a lot of
[2:42:06] message people
[2:42:09] live fervent to God deep in
[2:42:16] prayer that that's the way they worship
[2:42:18] God
[2:42:19] in speaking on tongues and
[2:42:21] interpretation of tongues and and it's
[2:42:26] wonderful there's nothing wrong with
[2:42:30] it in fact I I I I want you to know as
[2:42:33] soon as we get this next door open we'll
[2:42:36] have a
[2:42:37] place for any of you that feel you have
[2:42:40] gifts and you want to get together
[2:42:42] before service and pray and and bring a
[2:42:45] a message in tongues or an
[2:42:47] interpretation of tongues feel free to
[2:42:49] do
[2:42:51] it or if you have a
[2:42:54] prophecy and God gives you a prophecy I
[2:42:57] have prophecies that have written on my
[2:42:59] desk that I have right on my desk that
[2:43:02] that were brought to me and I performed
[2:43:05] that prophecy just the way it was
[2:43:07] brought to me because it was brought to
[2:43:08] me in the name of the Lord that the the
[2:43:11] the person that brought it never was a
[2:43:12] participation in it they never took part
[2:43:16] in the prophecy they brought the
[2:43:18] prophecy but they had no no part of the
[2:43:20] prophecy but yet it's here
[2:43:23] today if you have a prophecy gift of
[2:43:29] Prophecy we're
[2:43:31] here we'll be happy to read your
[2:43:34] Prophecy Before the church we'll be
[2:43:37] happy to read the interpretation of
[2:43:40] tongues before the
[2:43:42] church we're not taking any of it
[2:43:47] away but the one thing I do
[2:43:50] want is I want us to
[2:43:53] love the way he
[2:43:55] loved and I want us to love one another
[2:43:58] the way he loved
[2:44:00] us and I don't want us to gossip I don't
[2:44:04] want us to run down other churches I
[2:44:06] don't want us to run down other
[2:44:08] Ministries I don't want to be a fool and
[2:44:11] compare myself to
[2:44:13] others I want to live the word of God
[2:44:17] with the love of God in in my
[2:44:23] heart and that's what I'm going to
[2:44:26] preach and that's what I'm going to
[2:44:28] stand for because that's what I was made
[2:44:33] for and where others
[2:44:37] go it's not for me to
[2:44:40] judge what others do it's not for me to
[2:44:45] determine or to
[2:44:47] criticize they're my brothers
[2:44:50] and I'm a
[2:44:51] fan of anybody that makes a stand for
[2:44:56] this
[2:44:59] message they're way
[2:45:01] above the
[2:45:04] critics the people that don't identify
[2:45:06] with
[2:45:07] it is anybody perfect is any church
[2:45:11] perfect no neither is this one it's the
[2:45:14] most perfect church I know of
[2:45:20] it's the best people I know
[2:45:24] of it's the people that I love
[2:45:31] more but doesn't mean other people can't
[2:45:33] feel that
[2:45:35] way so the question is where's our
[2:45:37] emphasis this morning what's our goal I
[2:45:41] say the
[2:45:43] Capstone I say the love of
[2:45:47] God I say that we get our
[2:45:49] possession and it becomes our
[2:45:52] dearest most
[2:45:55] grateful possession we
[2:45:57] have and if I have this I have
[2:46:01] everything if I have love I have it
[2:46:08] all and I
[2:46:10] pray as they said John the
[2:46:15] Divine the old John Divine not our John
[2:46:18] divine
[2:46:21] said little
[2:46:23] children love one
[2:46:26] another little

[2:47:01] believer
[2:47:03] should run across their mind every day
[2:47:07] if you have
[2:47:09] not it's because you ask not
[2:47:20] do do
[2:47:22] you asking yourself this
[2:47:26] morning feel
[2:47:29] that you could have more love in your
[2:47:33] life less
[2:47:36] bitterness
[2:47:37] less
[2:47:40] criticism less
[2:47:44] [Music]
[2:47:47] fear you know
[2:47:50] doubt is the fruit of
[2:47:55] fear faith is the fruit of
[2:47:59] [Music]
[2:48:02] love and that's what you got to say to
[2:48:05] yourself this
[2:48:06] morning have I set it on the greatest
[2:48:09] thing of
[2:48:10] [Music]
[2:48:12] all that I could have God
[2:48:17] himself in me
[2:48:19] [Music]
[2:48:20] the Same Love wherein he loved the
[2:48:26] world maybe you could take it a step
[2:48:28] further this morning and
[2:48:31] say I believe that's what God planted me
[2:48:35] here
[2:48:39] for he didn't predestinate me to
[2:48:42] manifest other things from other
[2:48:45] ages or other times he's got people he's
[2:48:49] planted here to do that and they're
[2:48:53] doing it and they're doing a good
[2:48:57] job but he's put me
[2:49:00] here that I could be so
[2:49:04] one in an invisible Union with
[2:49:09] him that his love would
[2:49:12] be manifested in me that's what I've
[2:49:14] been planted for that's what I've been
[2:49:16] called to do I've been called to be the
[2:49:19] manifestation of that great
[2:49:22] Capstone in my
[2:49:25] [Music]
[2:49:29] life and it would be a desire in your
[2:49:35] heart it would be a desire that just
[2:49:37] cried out within you oh God I want that
[2:49:41] love I want to possess it I want to have
[2:49:45] it it's the greatest gift that you they
[2:49:48] give a
[2:49:50] Believer your son even prayed that that
[2:49:55] they might know how that you loved him
[2:49:58] that you loved us the same
[2:50:01] way Lord I pray that with all my heart
[2:50:06] this morning that you would allow that
[2:50:09] love to come into my
[2:50:12] life to cleanse me of all
[2:50:14] unrighteousness
[2:50:18] it's the victory over every
[2:50:22] habit it's the victory over every
[2:50:26] [Music]
[2:50:30] devil it's the power above all
[2:50:34] powers and I just ask that each of us
[2:50:38] this morning would examine our heart and
[2:50:41] say do I have that
[2:50:43] love and I hope you can say yes
[2:50:47] [Music]
[2:50:49] and then you would just say more Lord I
[2:50:51] would just want more of
[2:50:53] it I want it to reach deeper than

[2:51:34] point out all my wrongs all my failures

[2:58:08] body is just going to fall
[2:58:11] off amen I need you you to keep me in
[2:58:14] prayer I I believe it's this Tuesday
[2:58:18] they're going to do surgery on my eye
[2:58:21] and um I've got
[2:58:24] some blood floating in my eye and
[2:58:27] they're going to uh go in there and I'm
[2:58:31] going to make this as morbid as I can
[2:58:34] make it they're going to stick a needle
[2:58:37] in my eye and they're going to suck all
[2:58:39] the fluid and all the blood out of my
[2:58:42] eye and then they're going to stick
[2:58:44] another needle in my
[2:58:46] eye and and that's a camera so they can
[2:58:50] see what they're doing and they're going
[2:58:52] to stick a third needle in my
[2:58:56] eye and they're going to put a laser in
[2:58:59] there and they're going to laser all the
[2:59:02] leaking blood
[2:59:04] pain and then they're going to fill my
[2:59:07] eye up with some other kind of fluid
[2:59:09] from someplace
[2:59:11] else until my eye can generate new
[2:59:15] fluid and I just want to let you know
[2:59:17] I'm just looking forward to that so
[2:59:21] much no I'm
[2:59:24] not but I know with the prayers of the
[2:59:28] saints that I'll get through it just
[2:59:32] fine
[2:59:34] and you know if my eye ends up single
[2:59:38] then maybe my whole body can be my light
[2:59:42] so I just asked you to pray for me and

[3:00:07] it just they feel that's what they
