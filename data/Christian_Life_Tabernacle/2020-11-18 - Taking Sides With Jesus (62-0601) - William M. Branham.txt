Description:
Taking Sides With Jesus (62-0601)
Wednesday Evening Service: November 18,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Lord we lift our hands in worship oh as we praise your holy name [Music] there is amen do you believe that tonight amen I I just felt led of the spirit tonight to play uh a portion of a sermon called well it's really the whole sermon uh from the scripture forward called taking sides with Jesus and we'll uh turn to the St John the 9th chapter and the 26th to the 35th verse um you know I I A lot of times I you know something will come on my heart and when anything ever comes on my heart I always try to shake it and you know talk myself out of it but if it keeps coming back and it keeps pressing and I can't get away from it then I become a prisoner to that I don't know how to explain that to you but if you've ever had something on your heart it it finally it consumed you and I just got consumed with playing this and as I listen to it uh myself I I begin to see the wisdom in it and if I could say it like this I begin to see the prophecy in it and I never thought that I would see the day that our country is developing such a negative attitude towards church now it's under the cover of sickness and disease you know and uh trying to make out the church you know the governor of Washington asked the churches if they would please stop having Services the governor of California ask the churches if they would please stop having services and you know it throws you into such a dilemma and but you can't you a man's got to sue serve either God or Mana you know what I mean and as we as we navigate our way it seems like I wanted to say this to you as you know a friend more than as a pastor but as we TR try to navigate our way we're going places we've never been before and this whole idea of the pandemic this whole idea of not seeing anybody and talking to anybody it seems like it's robbing us from an opportunity to serve God to do good works to testify and one of the beautiful points that I believe that brother Brandon makes in this message is taking sides with him is serving him and I I hope that you can hear that as he brings it out it's a very wonderful tape to listen to It's it's not a tape where he's going into the mysteres or the seals or the third pole or the son of man Ministry this is also part of the message where he deals with our everyday life I believe you'll enjoy it I I I I'm trusting the Lord that I by me being obedient imp plain this that he will come and standad stand behind his word and that it'll bless your heart and you'll be blessed by it so what we'll do is we'll say a short prayer we'll play the uh uh the scriptures and at the end of the scriptures uh brother brand will say now I'd like to just speak uh a minute to you Brethren and and uh and at that point you can sit down okay and and just enjoy the word soak it up let it speak to you and I I I you know I'm not a type of person I know that that uh builds a lot of confidence but uh if anything else I'm playing to you the message of the hour and I think it'll bless you tonight so let's pray our gracious father Lord I feel that your spirit has directed our body to listen to this message that you Prophet brought to the church I believe it's fitting for the things that we're facing and the things that's being said and the spirit that's getting developed in the land father I believe there's wisdom and prophecy and instruction in righteousness contained in this hour and 12 minutes minutes that we're going to listen to I ask that you bless it to the heart that your spirit comes by each one and addresses something in their life something in their thinking something in their situation father and give them some of the Mana that's been stored up for us to listen to this evening I ask it in the wonderful and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you our Messenger as we listen to him min taking sides with Jesus to us God bless you now in St John the 9th chapter I want to read from the 26th verse until the 35th now just for a few minutes and then we'll we'll close in the next 20 or 30 minutes or maybe before that time the Lord willing now I want to read these scriptures now from St John 26 to uh St John 10 9 uh 26 to 5 I've got rot down here this something I was thinking of then said they unto him again what did he do to thee how opened he thine eyes and he answered them I have told you already and you did not hear wherefore would you hear again will you also be his disciples then they reviled him and said th his disciples but we are moses' disciples we know that God spake unto Moses but for this fell we know not from whence he is the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvelous thing that you know not from whence he is and yet he has opened mine eyes now we know that God heareth not Sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and doeth His will him he heareth since the world began has it not heard that any man has opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of God he could do nothing then answered they answered and said unto him thou was altogether born in sin and does thou teach us and they cast him out and Jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him does thou believe on the Son of God now I'd like to speak just for a few minutes to you Brethren knowing it my little talk here I don't know what will become of it trusting that God will use it in some way and now in this upon his word so I know that brother Saint brother Neville or one of you ministers usually preach and just being here with you uh if you pardon me I just like to speak to you a little bit on this manner now I want to take a subject here of taking sides with Jesus the Pharisees and leaders of his they always tried to belittle him before the people that was just a way that the devil had a working all the Pharisees and the teachers of his day constantly tried to belittle Jesus they all the Thro that they could give to him they done it they watched him constantly to find where they could find a fault and they never spoke of his good things they were always finding something that they could belittle him about and say you see look here if he was a man of God he wouldn't do it this way or if he was a man of God he wouldn't do it that way they were trying to cast The Shadow upon him to get the people to disbelieve him amen that's the work of the devil amen and that old scheme has never ceased there's many times that a minister will make a mistake and if he comes into a neighborhood a precious brother who's trying to do what's right and to lead the people right everything that the devil can point to the unbeliever or the so-called Christian in that neighborhood to throw off on that man he'll do it you know the real Christian way is to hide everything you can from a rather don't tell his bad things just tell his good things just tell what you know about him's good if anything's bad let it alone poor Fell's got enough against him anyhow don't try to take a pole and shove a man further into the ditch the Christian attitude is pick him up and take him out of the ditch don't never try to shove him down he's down already try to help him up and but too many of us today too many people today I might say try to do that if they could just get something and other that they could say that was real bad now for instance of if one of you Brethren make a mistake and do something's wrong which you're subject to do it I am too every one of us but as we go along let's remember we are brothers we are brothers and if we got any fighting let's fight with one another bring it together bring it before our Brethren and settle it now they used to in the Brandon family if one of the little ones done something he's going tell Bill about it because I was the biggest and I had to stand there and see which is right and wrong well my decision was that uh if they uh which one is right and wrong if they still didn't believe it then he got around behind my back and fought it out but they were still Brothers you see they fight in the backyard with one another and fight in the front yard far one another so that's the way it was see it were still Brothers well that that's the way we we got to do this see if you got something against somebody you're a brother don't tell somebody else about if it's wrong go to him and tell him and then if he's going to argue with you then take somebody else with you then bring it up the way the Bible said but Jesus they they just tried to find every little shadow that they could find to try to belittle him in the sight of the people and that's what the devil wants they want to they want to hurt your influence before the people that's why you want to watch careful what you do walk like real man of God talk like man of God see act like man of God live like man of God because a devil your adversary is going about like a roaring line trying to devour what he can why did they do this they were jealous of him amen that was what's the reason they tried to be him they were jealous of his ministry and that's the reason they were trying to belittle but he had the ministry of God and they knew that but it was contrary to their Creed so they were trying to belittle him make everything every little flaw that they could find get him out of the way they want him to quit they wanted the people to denounce him they wanted to say now uh this guy's nothing look here now there he is he he he did this and you know that's not right we've been taught all of our life that we should believe the elders and Y he stood right there and Bal that Elder out he disagreed with the tradition of the fathers and we've been we are to believe the tradition of our fathers we've been taught that by each Rabbi all the years through and here this man comes around and disagrees with them see well the man like that ain't fit to be a preacher see they were trying to belittling but in all of that the ones that believed him and loved him and had seen his scriptural Miracle signs would not be hindered by them no sir them who believed him believed him amen those who loved him stood by him they would not see what others pointed out to them oh if we could do that if we could just not see if somebody come around here say you know what they say you're a Pentecostal not by denomination well you was the you you that kind of baptizes in Jesus name yep that's right well let me tell you something I Know a Man one time was baptized like that and he did so and so but looky that has nothing to do with it it's a devil trying to throw a shadow on you they're always trying to point you to some old ship that got wrecked upon the seashore but they're not pointing to that one that made the void safely that's right that's right they're always trying to throw a crowbait out there and say this is example here's what I did it uh I know a certain preacher that was a Holiness preacher and he did this that the other but they don't point out others that wasn't Holiness did that also you see and they don't point the great things that God did like somebody say oh he this man went too far he he went too far he might have done that he wrecked himself up he went too far he become a fanatic he might have done that but while they're pointing to how many that went one that went too far how about these millions that never went far enough May Fable to see that see what I mean so the people tried them Pharisees and Sadducees and hypocrites and herodians and all tried to cast The Shadow on Jesus but them True Believers that was predestinated to hear that message heard it and see no fault in it at all same now those who believe him love him those who believe him see no fault any amen they don't see any heresy they don't see anything wrong they don't see anything wrong with his word they don't see anything wrong with these people they just see Jesus and that's all they're they're they're predestinate eternal life so they just take sides with Jesus and stay there we used to write sing a little song brother Roy uh roon we used to sing a little song Here guest time you come here I take the way with the Lord's thisp few I started in with Jesus and I'm going through I'd rather walk with Jesus alone and have for my pillow like Jacob a stone you've heard the little song that's right I'd rather take the way of the discard take the way of the despised take the way all the talked about and walk with Jesus see no fault in it at all don't see another fellow's ER just keep on going that's all now that's way they did to Jesus didn't they didn't and you must teach your people you pastors to do the same if somebody comes along and says uh you know uh your church they was so and so they yes sir they maybe a dozen of them sitting there then but how about that one it's it's it's all right sitting there see you're you're you're you just can't see the woods for the trees that's all that's it right back again see now and so they tried they was not willing to admit that he was doing the work of God so they they were trying to so discard and get the people not to believe but them people who believed him stayed right with him they took Sid you know I thought you're a couple of people I got wrote down here the blind man would not be changed by them that man he just gave his sign we know the story and um he gave them a very stinging question beside now they come up there and Jesus walked by and he was a man that was despised hated the Bible said he would be rejected uh there be no beauty of him we should desire him and all we like sheep have gone astray he's a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and how all the Bible said what he would be he'd be despised and rejected and we see that man now those who believe the word they know that the very things that Jesus was doing and the things is of his life they knew who he was so they couldn't put nothing light on him because they couldn't see it am and you know love is blind anyhow love covers up a multitude of sin you know perfect love cast out fear and sin all discard love does now this blind man was sitting there and Jesus and his disciples come by and I Think Jesus gave them a little lesson here when they seen this poor blind man they thought well now surely there's a sin behind that somewhere when we see something happen to a man we always say well he sin he got out of the will of the Lord somewhere brother CHR hit the post he got out of the will of the Lord somewhere in somebody's idea when the gun blowed up on me well is out of the will of the Lord Brother Neville hit the car is out of the will of the Lord that's not exactly right no sir it isn't God permits those things Jesus turned around and taught him a lesson they said his father must have sinned or or did his mother sin or did he sined Jesus said neither of them sin but that the works of God might be made manifest amen see God lets things happen just to for the works of God to be made manifest now and so he said told the man and give him his sight and he went his way and here come the Pharisees up when that was rumored around here was the man as blind satting now there begging and here he could see and that's rumored around among him and oh my that stirred up something and here they come up there and they see that the blind man could see and first they went wanted to find some way to put a fear upon all the people because they had already said if anybody goes after this new doctrine and this new Prophet called Jesus of Nazareth immediately they'll be handed their paper and fellowship from the church they cannot go to synagogue no longer if you associate with him 10 one of his meetings or anything you can't go no more so they wanted to make a big display out of it because they hated him they wasn't thinking of that poor blind man but they wanted to make a big display to make the people keep away from him they said they want to ask his father and mother so they went and got the father and mother they said is this your son he said yes sir was he born blind yes sir and uh what means does he see and the father and mother was afraid the Bible said because they know they'd be put out the synagogue if they admitted it it was and see there he was taken down they said now we know this is our son all probably a few thousand people stand there but if he could if them stinking Pharisees could only put a blight on his name right there had done something to scare the people they' run him out of there for that meeting see all of his influence have been lost so they said uh a bunch of them come up there at their Priestly garments on and they said uh speak for him they said we know this is our son we know he was born blind but now how he sees I don't know you ask him he's of age all right so they went over and got him said who give you your sight how do he heal him he said uh one called Jesus of Nazareth give me my sight and they said give praise to God said well we know this man's a sinner said uh and I said when is he said said I don't know you just come by and heal men that's all I know about I know one thing I do know I couldn't tell you about him being a sinner or not I don't know I've just met the man today but if if he could give me my my sight I know this one thing that where I was once blind I can now see I'm sure of that where I was blind a half hour AG go and now I got this good as sign as any of you fellas so I know I can see what a stinger that put on them so they thought well he said well I said you all want to be his disciples too that's good that's good solid testimony that that that's good that's good backgrounds that that that's really good witness in what I think said do you all here's a lay member a blind man standing on the street after meeting Jesus now asking the disciple asking the Pharisees if they want to be his disciples the Bishops head man you want to be his disciples also they said nay you're his disciple we're Moses disciple looking way back down through history you know we're Moses Disciple This Man we don't know nothing about him we don't know where he come from well we haven't got a rule of any of our schools he ever come up he never come and ask us about these things see we don't know nothing about it you people out there you realize that man's not ordained that man's a sus or something he's B you're being Bewitched why he doesn't have any Authority we haven't give it to him yet see we don't even know when this man comes from this old boy standing there could see said now this is a marvelous thing see he's about to get the people be down these Pharisees while make them afraid see but he had done T Sid with Jesus am so he said uh this is a marvelous thing let me break it down some of the words he might have said now you fellas around here has been running all the religious end of this for hundreds of years and uh you speak of a coming Messiah and something is going to take place just in the shadows of time when to deliver is coming to see us and you tell us that when he comes that that what all he's going to do and here you the spiritual leaders the high priest and priest of this community standing here together before these people trying to Blacken his name trying to say something evil against him and the man come and open my blinded eye I was born blind here's my father and mother giving witness that I was born blind been sitting right here among you for all these years born blind and that has never happened since the world began am and here a man can come and perform a miracle that hasn't been done since the world began and you the spiritual leaders and don't know nothing about it am and I say this is a marvelous thing he took sides with Jesus see he was permitted to be blind so the works of God could be manifested see because he come on the side of the Lord Jesus he took sides with him now he put Stinger to him you know what they did they said now we know you were born in sin try to teach us and shoved him out of the church knocked him out pushed him out throw him out but as soon as he was sowed out did you notice Jesus found him again amen Lord Jesus found him again so don't worry if they throw you out he'll find you again am all right and he said to him does thou believe on the Son of God he said Lord who is he he didn't even know but the only thing that he know that where he was blind he could then see I know this one thing brother they might call this fanaticism and whatever they want to but wh in I once the sinner I'll come into Grace now something has happened to me see this one thing I I now know by trusting his word by believing him I've been kicked out of every organization under the face of heavens there's none of them that will receive me anymore you know that some of their man will out here good man will accept but every organization is thumbs down on me that's right but he's found me you'll find me somewhere that's right that's right come along like that and um so it'll be all right because we want to take sides with Jesus and the only way you take sides with Jesus is taking sides on what he said believe in his word so let's take sides with him the blind man gave him a real testimony all right we find again that they tried to block his name just for a little bit and um I've got to skip over some things here so um one time is a Pharisee I preached on it here some time ago and called it washing Jesus feet I believe you all heard me preach on that here when a Pharisee asked Jesus to come down to his house a big old stiff starched Pharisee and asked him to come and you I gave it a little drama how The Courier come and found him and he come on down yet he know he was hated yet he went anyhow and when they got him in there they never washed his feet let him sit down there stinking and everything else from the T of the road and there he sat there and a little woman come in they thought oh my the Lord is good to us because look this just brings our big party they brought him there just to make fun out of him they brought him there just to have some fun from him and now they thought the Lord was working right with them because that this ill Fame prostitute woman woman come over and was crying and washing his feet with their tears and wiping them with his hair and old Pharisee and all the rest of the priest stand on the corner that brother everything the Lord set it up just exactly for us here we can put a smear on his name right now he calls himself a prophet and the people thinks that he's a prophet and they call him the Galilean prophet and he even claims to be the Messiah and we know Messiah will be a prophet and here he is sitting back there you see where we brought him look at there boy we got him fixed right now there he is sitting back there stooped down like a whipped out puppy or something back there and some prostitute of his own class would come around and wash his feet like that and now he don't even know if he's a prophet he' know what kind of a woman that was now boys we'll drink on this one said because look there see anything to blot his name anything to ruin the confidence of the people not knowing that they were possessed of the de devil to do [Applause] that they were working in harmony with the devil trying to blacken the name of the son of God how did they do this Brethren because they never searched the scriptures amen Jesus said search you the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of Me Oh What A Ministry he had see yes sir if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me see but the Pharisees said we got him now oh look here there's probably 1500 people here this Feast now look at him sitting over there there he sits with a prostitute and oh my what a horrible thing that was in that day and there he was with an ill-fame woman slipped in like look like he slipped in he got by the foot wash flunky and everything else and S there and said here she was over there washing his feet now if he was a prophet you see Breen that man's no Prophet if he was a prophet then he'd know what manner of woman that was washing his feet and Jesus just sat and watched her never moved a foot till she got on if you're going to do something for Jesus Jesus said and watch you do it sometime he let you go ahead till you get finished then the reward comes maybe you run the whole race of Life working for him but don't worry there's a reward at the end if you just take your way with his side you might not know see one person heal let you pray for just keep on praying for him I've often said if I prayed for 500 tonight all 500 dead in the morning tomorrow night I'll be preaching Divine Healing and praying for the sick am don't have one thing to do with it see he'll let you come right down through defeats and everything else till he come right down to the end of the road and finish your work like he led that woman she wanted to do him a service so he just held his feet out there and let let her wash him or if he said don't do that she have jumped and run but he let her do the service and after she got through finished the service that she was going to do then he looked up to that hypocrite standing back there was trying to cast the Blackness on his name amen said Simon I've got something to say to you not to her but to you you standing back there in your heart that's the reason you brought me down here you had no fellowship with me didn't I know it but you brought me down here and you set me back here to make fun of me let you never give me no water to wash my feet you never give me nothing to sooth me me sitting here burning and hurting you never give me no arrow for my face you ashamed to kiss me welcome or shake my hand see you ashamed before your company you ashamed to do it this woman since she's come in she's did nothing but rubed my feet and bathe them with the very tears of her eyes wiped him with the towel of her own hair then I'll just show you where I'm a prophet or not I like that now I want to speak to you just a minute your sins which are many are all forgiven [Music] you did they blind his name they thought they had it they thought they' stopped it they thought they'd fixed him so his Revival could never be in that Community they thought they ruined his influence but just taken one person that loved him to turn the whole situation how do you know that you're not that person for your community or somebody that you'll meet take sides with him do him a service do something for him you know what I mean Brethren take your side with Jesus take it make him your choice do service for him regardless of whether anybody else or you're ever repaid or anything don't make any difference wait till the work's over how would you like for him to say even though you had prayed for sick and they didn't get well though you prayed to get to speak with tongues you didn't do it you prayed to prophesy you didn't do it but yet the only thing you do is tell the story of Jesus in your church or in your community at your work you couldn't even do one thing didn't lead one person that woman didn't lead one to Christ but she done a service for himen what difference does it make at the end of the road if he'll say and I say unto you all your sins oh there not one prayer was answered for you but you come on the basis of my word you come because you believe me and you did me a service and I say that the many sins that you have done is all forgiven you that would be good enough for me amen yes sir all right they want to say the days of Miracles are pass and and so forth let him go ahead and say it but let us do the service for the Lord they hated him because they were jealous of him that's the only reason they were jealous they were trying to destroy his influence before the people the same as they're doing now they they can just in destroy the influence of the message before the people then they've got the thing whipped that's right amen because why did they try to do it because he was against all their Creeds and all their Church doctrines and everything that they believed in and called all their all their fats and so forth he was against it all and they hated him because he didn't barge in with them amen now if he come in said okay Ephesus marvelous man of my father I am Messiah come here K Ephesus do you see that water there you remember down in in Egypt uh Moses the great prophet turned it into um into blood you remember that c oh young fell I'm very well acquainted with that story all right cesis I'm going to turn the water now from water to blood to show you that I am that Prophet that Moses spoke of there it is cfes what do you think about it what do you think about cus being a Pharisee what do you think about the Pharisees oh I think they're The Marvelous race of people oh you all keep the traditions of the father is just exactly right you know you could be the Messiah no he wouldn't have been amen that would have been a very Mark that he wasn't amen when you see somebody come say come here and I'll show you what I'll do and come here I'll do this and do that you remember right now there's something Shady about it to start with Jesus said I'll do nothing till the father shows me first yes he was against them he taught against them he condemned their Sabbath keeping he condemned the way they dressed he condemned all the ways of their life all their Traditions all their pot washing and K washing and hand washing and everything else he condemned it every bit you know dressings he said you wear broad garments and desire the high seats and and make long prayers and the with Dev our winess home said you receive more damnation well remember I'm Dr so I don't care who you are oh man he really put on they did why because they didn't believe him he was the word see he was trying to break up that legalistic Bunch am and if he's here on Earth today he try to do the same thing amen some people say well now wait a minute we keep the Sabbath ever we do this and uh you know we keep all this and we keep that and ever why ever Good Friday while when fast time comes on 40 days before Easter we always observe lent I give up smoking for 40 days I give up drinking for 40 days before during time of Lent oh tradition of the fathers legalist if you love God you you don't smoke in the first place if you love God you I I wrote in the back of my little bible first one I ever had I said don't ask me foolish questions make this up in your mind if you love the Lord with all your heart you don't smoke drink or or don't smoke Che or drink any shine and that still stands good today amen I don't do it because I think he condemns me for doing it I would quit it because it's a dirty thing and isn't becoming to a minister am that's right I wouldn't say many times I go to houses there are women standing out there and I go to the house knock on the door and a sister come to the door just come in brother Brandon if her husband's not there unless it's the case of sickness and somebody with me I don't go and then call me to a hospital or to a room say brother B come over here I'm sister so and so from so and so I'm here at the hotel I I I brought my mother along she's sick I take my wife if I don't I take some other brother see I I don't I don't think I think it'd be all right for me to go in there but why does somebody see me go in there see why does somebody see me do it see then the first thing you know they' say he went in there where that woman was he's chasing that after women that see that would be a thing I shouldn't do see you shouldn't never do anything like that cuz you put a stumbling in somebody else's way see I don't believe that I would do anything wrong in there it would I wouldn't trust God to go in there no matter what the thing was I'd trust God but yet you see and and and I love the Lord well enough till I wouldn't do it see it's a love you have you you not do it because it's a duty to do it you do it because you love love the Lord you don't have to do it but you do it anyhow Paul said to me all things are lawful but not all or expedient see Paul could do lots of things that maybe that he know the Lord understood him and trusted him but it wasn't expedient for him to do it so that's the way these legalists trying to say 40 days before Easter we always starting to fast and they eat just as much as they ever do maybe they say well I don't like beans so I'll give up beans for lint I've heard him say that I don't like pork so I'll just give up pork you know I'm going to quit drinking for lint one woman told me said you know what I give up for lint this year brother R I said no I said candy said I I never did care too much for it anyhow see there you are now they call that fasting see legalism they say well I got a you know I I I stagger at church a long time because I tell you I kept Sunday school for a full year but because my teacher said if they give a Bible to the one that didn't miss a day oh brother that's some way of going i' let's go by me a Bible see if you don't go to church because you love the Lord you might as well stay away that's all see because you go therefore you love God I think of this song We Sing blessed be the ti that binds our hearts in Christian love Fellowship of Kinder mind is like to that above when we a Sunder party gives us inward pain but we shall still be Jared in heart and hope to meet again see that's it when we are part it gives us inward pain I've seen the time brother let me not condemn us but let me just wake us up to something I've seen the time and this church that when people had to wait until Wednesday night to meet one another they would cry over that's right I seen ministers come in here and would say how do you do it well then people just one heart see they meet the door and say and sisters meet one another back there and hug each other and saying sister be sure to pray for me now honey I'll see you again Wednesday night you'll pray once you pray for me I'll be praying for you and making like that and Tears In Her Eyes see the brothers Shake one of's hands and it's could hard to get away from each other like that that's real Christian Fellowship see just waiting praying for each other yes sir that's the way we should be all right now these men that made these statements they wasn't bad man they didn't mean to be evil they thought they were doing a service for God them Pharisees and things they wasn't bootleggers and drunkards they were religious man it wasn't bad they just they just did not accept the word of the truth they did not accept the spirit what they held to their Creeds and their their leaders Traditions see it showed that they love their leaders here's Big cus is the high priest there's the rest of those big priests and those men go along now you take like Catholic they not throwing off to them same thing in Protestants you take a Catholic he loves his priest and uh and I tell him about the word of the Lord and and he sees the works of God he say but my my church don't believe that and you go talking to pin man say a woman said to me today said it's a sin for me to listen to you see she didn't want to be bad she just thought so much of her church and her priest so if she listen to anything else she was loyal to that priest Jehovah Witness is loyal to what they believe the Baptist is loyal to what they they believe the Presbyterian is loyal to what they believe and there this is loyal to their pastors can't we be that loyal to the word see now if those I want to ask you something you say well brother BR how you know they're not now if those Pharisees and Sadducees and leaders of that day would have got away from their Creeds and their dogmas and listen to what the word said and what Jesus Is Telling just exactly what Messiah was supposed to do they would have held on to him amen see but they thought so much of their leaders they wasn't bad man they wouldn't steal lie cuss anything like that they wouldn't do that they wouldn't commit adultery why certainly not why they would witness the stoning of one that had did such a thing and they wouldn't they wouldn't do that they were good man but the only thing that was they wasn't spiritual man amen morally they were fine but that isn't what counts and what did Jesus tell them even them loyal people he said you are of your father the devil see it's a word that counts now I'll hurry just quick as possible H they wasn't spirit filled but they were loyal and held to the modern Creed of their leaders see all right his ministry was short showing up their Doctrine that's what the matter now look I just take it I just Brethren I I I'm I'm going to ask you forgive me right now for being this long um uh maybe you won't want me to come back or another one but look listen to this see I want you to be sure to get this now they had their Creeds and they were great churches and great people and great man holy man good man gentle man fine man honorable man man of Honor educated smart religious is that right now we all know that just as good as you can find anywhere see but when Jesus come on his ministry showed up their Doctrine cuse God was proving by the ministry of Jesus Christ that he was with him amen didn't Peter quote the same thing he said you men of Israel let this be known unto you and Heen to my words and said Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you amen see see if they like this blind man said isn't this a marvelous thing you're the spiritual leaders of the nation and here comes a man in and opens My Eyes by the power of God and yet you don't know nothing about it amen he said this is a marvelous thing he had something didn't he yeah sure did all right he did a man that could do this and yet they didn't know whence he was now that was a marvelous thing now look at today Brethren see we have a we know we have a mve of God we know it's performing Miracles it's Healing The Sick it's even raising the dead it's casting out Devils it speaks with tongues it interprets tongues it sends forth prophecies they happen amen he's showns dreams interpretations perfect strictly then isn't it a strange thing that great leaders would say was a bunch of crazy people when they're the leaders of the nation the leaders of churches that's a marvelous thing what is it it's still jealousy the spirit and power and word of God in these last days is showing up their dogmas and Creeds that's all is that they got man blinded by them so my young Brethren you all that's going out here in these churches hold to God's word don't you move if you can't make it come to pass don't stand in nobody else's way stand there beating at the door just parting right to it that's right stay right there don't start fanaticism because it'll show you up but if you'll stay true and holy and with that word God will vindicate you that's right his ministry was showing up their doctrines and dogmas so they took every chance to get rid of him they could find everything that they could find to get rid of him they did it trying to say when I look here look at here so and so this one there he said one day in the house of Simon the leper not one word said he heal him he a leopard nothing says he heal him that's right he passed by the pool of Bethesda and there laid about 2,000 people people lame blind Hal withered and he walked over the one man and healed him and walked away say well now if he was Messiah he' healed all of them if he is full of compassion as you all say is he' had mercy on all of them everything that they could find to throw a black mark on him they did it everything they could find they throw it on him all right they took every chance they could to rid get rid of him question his birth his birth wasn't questioned they put that before the people they couldn't understand how he was born to Virg birth and Joseph his father supposed to be a Cartner and he's born before Joseph Mary was married they throw that before the people yes sir see what am I saying now they're black marketing see look at him where did he come from look at his mother no more than a street prostitute had this baby and after the baby was born she's already pregnant the baby is to be born then Joseph mared to hide then come around with some kind watch the work of the devil can't you see it's that kind of a birth they filled that before the people and not reading in the Bible Isaiah 9 and6 a virgin shall conceive see what was it they got away from the word amen that's it they throw black figures at his authority gentlemen don't you know we're Moses disciples don't you know we're Servants of Christ don't you know we search the scriptures daily and we have not one thing they said the Messiah would come to his Temple not one word of him coming to a temple where is he at what school did he come from ask any of the Brethren both Methodist and Baptist and Presbyterian you know Pharisees Sadducees and so forth what Fellowship card does he pack where's his authority even to preach he hasn't been ordained he hasn't even got a right to preach he said my ordination comes from God my Works vindicate what I am that's right I don't have to have your papers see what I mean they throw that his Doctrine why they called him be elub his Doctrine they couldn't understand why he disagrees with all of the traditions of the fathers he even disagrees with the Pharisees he disagrees with the Sadducees he disagrees with a whole group of them amen now where does he get his Doctrine the Bible of course well you say well how do I know that that's right God backed it [Applause] up that's what the blind man said it's a strange thing if you're so right and he's so wrong yet he can take the power of God and open my eyes and you never have seen it done yet even that's a strange thing oh my I like to take sides with him don't you sure you say you're moses' disciples and you're so right and he's so wrong that let me see you do the things he's doing amen amen amen that's where he's Doctrine they denounced in all his claims they said he has no his claims is wrong of being a messiah how could he be a messiah not come to the church how could it be a messiah and here we are the cream of Israel but the cream had soured yes sir had flies in it so they they had to skin that off so he said here we are the church the elect we're we've kept the tradition we've kept Moses laws we've done all these things and down like K and here this man comes along and denounces our caims and besides that our holy priest our Holy Father wholy this and holy that and all this other kind of stuff and all of our great men and he calls him of the devil am then calls himself the Son of God oh my see they tried to throw them Shadows on the name of Jesus and on Jesus to get it before the people much more could be said there there but takes too much time what but the word and The Works Vindicated him amen oh to the True Believers the predestinated that were predestinated to see him and know his ministry there he was amen no matter if he ever opened his mouth about anything they knew he was amen hallelujah that little old prostitute walked out there at the well that day get a bucket of water a middle-aged man sitting over there said bring me a drink she said well it's not customary for you Jews that's a woman of samario said he said but if you knew who you were talking to now she thinks she was a smart tic Jew she turned around said uh I see you're a Jew and if you're a Jew of course you're religious and you said to worship at Jerusalem but our father Jacob drank Miss well and watered his cattle here and the water's deep you ain't got nothing to draw with and we worship this mountain he said just stop a minute go get your husband and come here amen she said I don't even have a husband he said you've told the truth said you've got five you've had five and the one you're living with now is not yours that little prostitute predestinated I can you see her set that pot down and she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet see that seed was laying there the only thing it needed was water and the water had fell on it when it fell upon those Pharisees they said it's be couldn't bring nothing or nothing there but weeds to come from but when that predestinated seed struck that Water of Life she said sir you must be a prophet I know that when the Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things he said I he that speaks to you she'd let that water potting into the city she had something to tell she said come see a man who's told me the things I've done isn't this the very Messiah see she tuck sides with Jesus that's right strange thing was it all the Pharisees and Sadducees didn't know him and this prostitute not him see why those who believed him and loved him and seen his signs they know that was the sign of the Messiah there's no getting around it they know it amen hallelujah old Nathaniel walked up there maybe before Philip said I don't know about this Phillip I've seen a lot of things rise up in these last days I know there's a lot of things going on but he walked up there for and said I'll go listen to him see what got to say walked up there and Jesus said behold an Israelite in whom there's no God he said Rabbi when did you know me he said before Philip called you when he R the tree I saw you what did the water struck that predestinated seed when it did he said R th heart the Son of God Amen you're the king of Israel why was it the seed was laying there amen ready God swed it back under before the foundation of the world it should bring forth the light right at that time hallelujah amen that's my stand right there brother that's where I believe right there I preach it and it falls here and there and to go this way and that way to make any differ somewhere it's going to strike a seed when it did it'll B to life like that this is sure as the world yes sir like that blind boy said this was done that the works of God might be made manifest he know what was going to take place sure it did all right now the predestinated when they seen his scriptural signs know that the word Vindicated the works or The Works Vindicated the word that the word was right they were predestinated to see it and they were right in line to see it and they got it then they said after they seen they couldn't get nowhere because the people is predestinated to eternal life they just going to find it that's all all the father's given me will come to me and all that comes to me I'll give eternal life and raise him up to the last day there will not be one of them lost amen I'm holding right to that not by works not by Deeds not by power not by might by my spirit sayth God not what I done what I am or what I will be but what he is and I am in him and whatever he is I'm part of him amen I'm saved because I'm part of him and he's he is God and I'm part of him being his son am that's right so it ain't what I done what I will do is what he has done that's my trust right there all right so they seemen they couldn't get nowhere I'll skip a few of these scriptures here They Se they couldn't get anywhere with him so you know the next thing they had to do to try to get him off the field they went and said to his Brethren and his mother you know he's awfully tired you should take him off to one side for a while that bunch of Hypocrites they just didn't the thing it was they just didn't want to get the thing they didn't want to do they want to get rid of him it wasn't they thought he was so tired they'd like for him to work himself to death but every time he went out the miracle started pouring the word of God went forth I would not like to hear him stand up there that day on the Sea Coast when he called Simon Peter and said follow me what like that got on a chunk and sat down there left my Nets and left my fish and pole brother Chris and sit down there and Lead back against the chunk and listen to you preach when he got in that boat oh my my would I love to H him when he said that come unto me all yet labor and heavy laden I'll give you amen I like you he him said they tried to get his mother name to take him off the field they said well you know he's is overworked I believe you're better get him off that way anyway thing to get rid of him that's all they want wanted yes sir again a many that went with him just to find a place to trap him do you know that people followed right along with him just to find a place they give him one day a penny and they said Rabbi uh for the giv the P said RBI we're Jews we know you're a great man of God oh that hypocrite see we know you're a great man of God yes sir Rabbi just walking right along with him oh good morning brother oh we're so happy you're over here in our country oh we're so glad to see you we are really far yet teeth and toenails brother if you're going to have a Revival we he might cooperate with you see what they're trying to do is set a trap for him they said now we know that thou a great man of God you don't fear favor of no man you fear nothing but God we know that you're a bold oh you're Fearless with your message we know you're a great prophet because old man could do like that be Fearless with his message in a days like this unless he was a prophet of God knows where he's standing so we know you don't respect person no man Rabbi you're a great man we're Jews we're right with you brother we sure are now Rabbi is it right to pay tribute to Caesar oh that bunch of Hypocrites the Holy Spirit was with him amen he was the Holy Spirit he said you got a penny say oh yes yes I got a penny get you said hand it to me said who's inscriptions on that said Caesar said then give Caesar what Caesar's God's what's God setting a trap for him professing to be his friends seemed like no one could understand him they' travel with him a little while and then get disgusted with him and leave they'd say oh well we thought we thought surely even the disciples said we thought surely this was he it was going to even John sent out and asked him are you he or do we look for another oh what a life he must have lived and knowing that but he had one purpose one purpose do the work of God many went with him just to find a place to traffing I hope it's not sacrilegious if I say it's a same today many come in and follow the meeting just to find a place see you pray for somebody you're not long ago a certain sister that goes to this church was at another church where God was making everything thing happened and this sister said to the other sister said you know that man that could pray for the sick said must have a uh a very Victorious Life and said he must just be able his family everything be healed at a spoken word like that and the other lady happened to be from Jeffersonville and I'm sure that nobody has to know but what Jesus said among your own people you know your country that's right that's the reason I it may be that right now coming close to may be a change of time you see and he said U he said you know what said not one of his kids can have a sniffle unless he takes it to a doctor a poor degraded deluded thing like that see see a woman it it just want to throw off that's right amen said when his children gets sick he takes them to a doctor any body that's sensible to do the same thing people can't understand that medicine is s of God Amen well Brethren if it's not it's of the devil that's right sure it is God is where medicine won't reach amen certainly medicine is of god well you say I know a lot of doctors is yes I know a lot of preachers is the same way too it's not the man that's handling it's what it is I Know a Man any man's handling the word of God don't believe in Divine Healing don't even believe in God right but they handle it just the same there's many a man out there with medicine and surgery and stuff that denies God and everything else but there's a man one that believes him too if it helps people that's of God Amen I don't have to I don't have to take that car and ride home tonight I can walk if I want to but God made me a car so I thank God for it all these things come from God but use them sensitively don't go insane with them am the same thing so that that's it you see just trying to find something to this young convert to blight their name the name of of the works of God see they wanted to blight it every time a child gets sick one of his children he takes him to a doctor sure would and if the doctor can't I'll ask God to help before I go there then if the doctor can do anything about it then I'll take him up a little higher that's right yes sir all just the same today they're trying to find a trap somewhere he knew them but notied he never rebuked them he went right with them amen he does the same thing now am he goes right along with them shows him his Mercy that's right though they do all together against him why because he loves them and he went with them but they're always ready to call on him in the case of emergency amen they want him man they want they'll make fun of somebody a shouting they'll make fun of somebody preaching Divine Healing say they don't believe in it they just haven't got sick enough yet I've heard of many one a woman dying just as I run up the steps while it's preaching right here and the man standing right there at the door calling to me she'd walk by she lived up the street here had a cow out there and she said if my cow got that kind of religion that Billy's got I'd kill the cow and less than an hour from that she was stricken and taken to the hospital a beautiful young woman and I rushed out there her husband was cathic and they sent for me she's dying and she went her eyes went to swelling out she said calling calling calling calling quickly quickly and her brother run up and stood there at the door and waited and waited and they kept motion for minut place his Pack full of people and while somebody come around put a not on on the desk here and said said someone's dying in the hospital I believe brother Grim's selling I said take my place that I go and he was just set up to lead singing he wasn't even called and to to preach at that time he come up to lead singing and I went out and got in my car and rushed out there and just as going up a steps she draw her last breath and of course the bowels and kidneys and everything acting I running there and they D cover her face up and steam coming up around like that that old nurse stand there she said brother Brandon she screamed her last breath for you trying to make it right it's too late then you see to you can send one time too many you know and she kind of had deep in her face she had arban hair a real pretty woman and she her bobbed hair was all bushed out great big brown eyes had pushed out and just half closed and the freckles on her face had got in such a way such strange till they stuned out like little bumps all over her face and her mouth was open and I walked over her and looked at her and there her husband stood there and said Billy here's what it was said I'm Catholic I want you to say a prayer for her because she's going to purgatory and I said what said say a prayer for her said she's gone to Purgatory she passed by your church about two hours ago and said if our cow there got your kind of religion she'd killed the cow said say a prayer for her I said that's too late she should have purged your soul here not until she get somewhere else see that's right oh yes but always want him in the time of distress people I've heard him say I don't believe in God let him hurt himself right bad once see the first one he'll call on even his disciples one time when they were in a storm though when they saw him they were a little bit afraid of him they didn't know this exactly what it was they said it's a spirit and they cried out but yet all hopes for being saved was gone so they invited him in amen yeah they're always where you're a little suspicious or not when all hopes is gone you like to invite him in amen yeah they took him in because they had a need of him that's right you know I've often wondered sometime maybe that's why the storms come on did you ever think of that he set up there and watched them till they had need of him and then he come on the scene so we can see we are need of him now we see that the storm is coming brother let's take sides with him tonight take sides with his word I I I quit here um let's take sides with him let's us you and I Brethren jar up with him tonight the storms are coming and don't wait till the little board sunk let's take him into our little B now you might look off and say I can't understand all these things brother brandom see if we say anything but what's in the word see if there's anything there but what he promised to do it might look a little spooky to you sometime you think oh my I can't understand that but there'll be a day when this life of yours is leaving it it won't look so bad to you then when you know yourself you got to turn back to the god that created you you'll want to take him in then let's take him in now before the storm gets any worse than what it is I want him to into my heart I want him so much in my life to my whole being is saturated that my mind my thoughts my everything that I am is governed and controlled by Christ Jesus I want to be so lost to to myself that all I'll know and see is Jesus Christ and I want to come before you all if the god of Heaven permits you to have these things that I've talked about when I come among you I want to know Christ him crucified I I want to know the glory and precious Praises of of God sit down among you and hear one Minister get up and give the praise to God the what he had seen done in his church and another and what he saw done in his church nothing what he saw done in his church that's exactly what they did and when they come together and met in Fellowship in Acts 4 they was given account what God had did over here and what God had did over here and Peter and John had been whipped and and and made a promise that they' what they' do to him if they preach anymore in jesus' name and they gathered with their people and they all prayed with one Accord and prayed in the will of God and quoted the scripture why did the heathens rage and the people imagine a vain thing and when they prayed the Holy Ghost shook the place where they were assembled together that's the kind of a meeting we need that's what we got to have Brethren let's be fortified by the word of God by the spirit of God by the power of God and let our lights so shine now that we'll be like Stevens he stood there one man alone before that Stan hadran Council of a half a million man may be standing there every one of them pointing their finger of acquisation in his face when that little fell walked out there said he's shine like an angel I don't mean maybe a light on his face like that an angel don't have to have a light on him but an angel is a man or an angel is a messenger and a messenger who knows what he's talking about walked out there and said man and Brethren and fathers our fathers in mapon how they was brought out in Abraham and so forth and oned and so and so and then he got down to the farling point he said oh you stiff neck uncircumcised the heart and ears why do you always resist the Holy Ghost like your fathers did so do you he knowed exactly what he was standing at that's the reason he was Shin he wasn't a bit afraid he know in whom he had believed even when death knocked at the door of St Paul's heart and he said I know in whom I have believed and I'm persuaded he's able to keep that which I've committed to him against the day amen the Lord bless you Brethren I'm sorry I kept you here till 25 minutes until 11: I know this is uncustomary for you I'm sorry to do it but you've been real nice tonight none of you has left you set and give your undited attention and I trust and hope that in my little broke up nervous talk that God the Holy Ghost has somewhere has poured out a little seed into your heart that the power of God will strike and bring it to life just like the woman at the well and others who are predestinated to eternal life God bless you that bless you tonight I mean I could go through here and point out so many wonderful things that he said you know I like this what he said so the people tried them Pharisees and Sadducees and hypocrites and herodians they all tried to cast a shadow on Jesus but them True Believers that was predestinated to hear that message heard it and seeing no fault in it at all do you wonder why you can not see a fault in it you know to you it's life amen amen aren't you thankful for that he said they were predestinated to eternal life so they just took sides with Jesus and stayed there then he said and you and you must teach your people you pastors to do the same Amen in another place he said that they couldn't see it but the blind could I thought this was a great thing here that he said he said but as as soon as he was throwed out did you notice Jesus found him again Jesus found him again so don't worry if they throw you out you he will find you again thought of so many Believers that go through times where they might lose their job they might lose work uh maybe something falls through on them and I I just thought how beautiful he is he said and he comes down here and he says I've been kicked out of every organization under the face of Heaven there's none of them that will receive me and anymore you know that that's what brother Ram did for a living He preached the gospel yeah okay all the doors were shut on him he never threw his hand up and said what am I going to do he just simply said this he says he says some of their men well out here good men will accept but every organization is thumbs down on me that's right but he has found me he will find me somewhere that's right see that's right come come along like that he promised he would never see the rightous beg bread you know and and I I I I just thought that was such words of comfort because we sit back and and uh we uh just you know there's so much times of wondering that's going on I thought this was really spectacular you see that that's it we a Sunder part it gives us inward pain I've seen the time brother let me not condemn us but let me just wake us up to something let me don't condemn you but let me wake us up to something prophecy you think God sent a messenger because he needed us to wake us up to something you can that's paragraph 206 if you want to put it up on the screen paragraph 206 I just want to take this let me not condemn us but let me just wake us up to something I've seen the time in this church that when people had to wait until Wednesday night to meet one another they would cry over it and that's right right I've seen ministers come in here and would say how do you do it well then people just one heart see they meet at the door and say them sisters meet one another back there and hug each other and say sister be sure to pray for me now honey I'll see you again Wednesday night I'll pray won't you pray for me I'll be praying for you and make it like that and Tears in their eyes see the brothers Shake one another's hands and just could go hard to get away from each other like that that's real Christian Fellowship see see just just wait pray for each other yes sir that's the way we should be all right a germ took that out of the church people sit home for months they they're lacking that they don't call and say oh brother I've missed you or I I'm sick I won't be there there well I just want you to know prophet's not condemning you but he is trying to wake you up to something I think this message was a tremendous wakeup call of the things that's going how they're trying to throw off how everything that it is going you know uh how they don't want the move of God they don't want uh the Miracles I mean I just marked so many wonderful things that were said and you know the parts about people condemning you know someone gets sick he said brother navel ran into a car did any of you know brother R Neville ran into a car yeah and everybody said he must be out of the Lord's will he said not so you know I I thought that was a great lesson tonight did you notice how he talked about someone that took sides with Jesus never did a miracle never did a work never did anything he said you just keep serving him your reward comes at the end of the rad he said he said that woman that washed his feet never LED anybody to Christ maybe not in her lifetime but her story has and her testimony of just doing that that service has brought many backslider back to serving God uh I I just hope that we can see the seriousness and the difference between believing something and having Creeds and dogmas because this message has a lot of doctrinal truth but without Christ that doctrine of truth becomes a Creed and the doctrine it's something we believe but brother Brandon was talking about a life we live and so we've got to really take into consideration that everything is going to throw off against us the government's going to throw off against us the laws of the land are going to throw off against us they want to turn our fellowships into warehouses they they want us to be the evil ones because we gather did you remember the part in that tape where he said they want to shut it down because when those people get together miracles happen people get well and that's what they don't want because it disproves every single one of their theories and and as a Christian and as a brother and as the Lord leads me to see this and I see that man creates a pandemic and they they say you know get totally afraid of it and yet a Christian he goes to the doctor and if the doctors can't take care of it he goes what a little little higher you you understand they why do they want to take the little higher away from us you you you in other words we are fighting such a mental battle and I sit here and I think well how can I appease this side and and appease that side and then he finally comes down and says just take sides with Jesus I suffer the little ones to come un me all ye that are sick and heavy laden come unto me and I'll give you rest amen you know our testimony he says go out into the world how do you know that you're not that one person that makes the whole difference for the community I mean this is the thief that came in in the night this thing I've never seen anything Rob Christians that used to have the words of Faith pouring out of their mouths and now they haven't come to the house of the Lord they haven't C called anybody they there there's nothing about their lives that are are saying hey I miss you I long for you I long for the word and if you go back and listen to this he draws a great distinction between people that believe and and stay that and the person that goes out and lets that love of God be shed abroad in their heart well as much as people have stayed home I'll guarantee you their couch is converted their couch is full of love and you say well brother mcer you know what I long for people to get over the fear what's going to happen if oh brother MC I haven't had the virus I can go through the people in the church that have had it they've suffered and they've got well and they raise their hand up and they give God the glory for being healed I don't want anybody to be sick but I I would rather serve God and be sick then not serve God you you know what I mean I just think that it comes a time where you just got to walk out by faith and and those men were told if you go and preach in this name of Jesus we'll chop your head off Angel lets them out of prison they all get together they all get together and they're praising the baby Jesus and all the Miracles that God has done I I in my heart I I'm just wondering what does God have for us if we can come together in that unity in love that he spoke about in this book what does God have for us and why is the enemy trying to crush it so bad cuz it proves he's a liar and you're are predestinated part of a kingdom and he's jealous of you cuz you're going to cast him out and you're going to throw him in to the Lake of Fire and you're going to judge him amen amen church just go back and take that into consideration you know and I know you're here but if there is anybody listening online then I I really would hope they would take that into consideration and come to some place in their heart but I ask the question is you've got to come to the find out what's leading you what's influencing you and I could go through pages I mean this was this was a marvelous sermon marvelous and wonderful marvelous to behold what was spoke to us tonight I I certainely hope it was a a blessing to you brother Brandon prayed at the end he said he hoped that what was said would give some hope and some leadership to everybody that heard it and that's my prayer tonight that you were that you were blessed by the word of God let's stand together we'll say a word of prayer brother Billy can lead us in a song of worship or two and dismiss us let us pray heavenly father I'm humbled by the words that were spoken tonight by your Prophet the subjects that he covered about doctors being in medicine God using it what he talked about doing good works and and serving you what he said about lifting one another up what he said about the fellowship that used to be with the Believers where they would cry they would cry cuz they had to wait till Wednesday to see one another he said I'm not condemning you but I just want to bring it to your attention that's the way we should be as Christians Lord I hope it catches our attention it's not David McGary saying it it's not my opinion it's not my attitude Lord I may have never had that attitude but I see the one that you sent to guide us through this hour the word that you stored up in that Storehouse I say this is not a historical message Lord It's a living Storehouse word that is coming out in season to guide each heart and to lead each heart and father I pray that well you promised that the predestinated would see it they would find no fault in it they would love it ins side with it lord I can't change people's hearts I can't change their attitudes I can't change their minds I can't make them the way that I want them to be but I pray that one thing father from the bottom of heart that they hear your voice and they hear what your voice speaks and they hear your voice teach and above all Lord they hear your voice guiding and leading them in the way that they should think and speak and act and how they should handle and discern and judge everything that's put before for them and that they'll know one thing that if God be for them who can be against them and that if they take sides with you that their reward comes at the end of the matter their reward comes father you know I want such a change in my life I want victories that I've never had before I want love in my heart beyond what I've ever experienced Lord and I want to stand for this message I'm not ashamed of it Lord I'm not ashamed to have the picture a pillar of fire not ashamed to have the statue of a perfect man on the wall Lord I'm not ashamed of anything that your message has done [Music] Lord I believe it's life and life more abundant and Lord I want that Abundant Life father not only Lord but the part of me that's you created in me I never asked to be a pastor you know I don't have any ability to do it I can't remember things I can't remember names but Lord I know my heart heart wants your people to be blessed I want them to be victorious I want them to have power Lord I want them to love one another and love this message and Lord that's my motive and objective and Lord I just ask that you would deal with each of their hearts and take this word tonight and give them something that they need that will help them in their journey I commit it to you this evening in Jesus precious and holy
