[14:00] prayer the brothers that are taking the
[14:01] offerings if you can come at this
[14:03] [Music]
[14:16] time I think we ought to also mention
[14:19] that
[14:23] uh sometimes it seems like a world
[14:27] away
[14:30] but there's the children of
[14:33] Israel that that are under
[14:37] siege that time of horror and distress
[14:40] for them
[14:44] yes God said he save a
[14:48] Remnant and he blinded them the
[14:51] original children of God that he might
[14:54] allow the gentile people to come in
[14:56] that's
[14:57] right
[15:00] but they have to receive their
[15:04] Messiah and brother brand taught us if
[15:07] you know if you want to know what time
[15:09] it is look at God's time piece that's
[15:11] Israel
[15:13] amen there's an unsettling there's war
[15:17] real war going on we don't know what the
[15:19] future holds for us we know
[15:22] that that six seal pouring out that
[15:24] tribulation time said the bride would be
[15:27] gone
[15:30] as our brother mentioned this morning

[50:13] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen praise
[50:16] the Lord if you have your bibles if
[50:18] you'll turn in Deuteronomy chapter 16 if
[50:21] if we haven't already mentioned it we
[50:24] bring you greetings from Brother
[50:26] um Dany and the Saints there in uh
[50:29] Florida we had some uh wonderful
[50:32] services with them and just such a great
[50:35] group of people I think if you're ever
[50:38] out uh that way you should you should uh
[50:42] even if you have to go a little out of
[50:43] your way you ought to go be in
[50:44] fellowship with them because I really
[50:45] felt at home and it's it's just good to
[50:48] come in contact with brothers and
[50:49] sisters of precious like Faith where you
[50:51] just feel so welcomed and we just had a
[50:53] good time amen just reading out of
[50:57] Deuteronomy 16 and verse
[51:02] 2 it says Thou shalt therefore sacrifice
[51:06] the Passover unto the Lord thy God of
[51:09] the flock and the herd in the place
[51:12] which the Lord shall choose to place his
[51:15] name there we just ask a blessing upon
[51:19] the reading of his word you may be
[51:20] seated also if you'll just turn in your
[51:23] Bibles to John chapter 4
[51:28] and verse
[51:36] 19 this would
[51:38] be out of any story in the Bible uh
[51:42] brother Brandon would use this story I
[51:44] would I don't think it's even a question
[51:46] more than any other um story in the
[51:49] Bible and so and I could say it can
[51:52] never be used um too much that's right I
[51:55] can never hear it too much I can't read
[51:58] it too much uh every time I'm identified
[52:01] in it every time it it breaks me up
[52:03] every time I see myself it's just such a
[52:06] perfect h h a picture so let's just read
[52:09] that out of John 4 uh
[52:11] 19 it would uh read like this and the
[52:14] woman said unto him sir I perceive that
[52:17] thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped
[52:21] in this mountain and ye say that in
[52:24] Jerusalem is the place where men ought
[52:26] to worship and Jesus said unto her woman
[52:29] believe me the hour cometh when ye shall
[52:31] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[52:34] Jerusalem worship the father you worship
[52:38] ye know not what now think of that that
[52:42] sounds kind of
[52:44] offensive you don't know what you
[52:47] worship think of it you worship you know
[52:50] not what we know what we worship for
[52:52] salvation is of the Jews but the hour
[52:55] cometh and now is when the true
[52:59] worshipper the true worshipper I like
[53:01] that I want to be a true
[53:03] worshipper when the true worshipper
[53:06] shall worship the father in spirit and
[53:08] in truth for the father seeketh
[53:15] such let me catch my for the spirit and
[53:17] Truth for the father seeketh such to
[53:19] worship him God is a spirit and they
[53:21] that worship Him must worship Him in
[53:23] spirit and in truth the woman said unto
[53:26] him I know that when Messiah cometh
[53:28] which is called Christ when he is come
[53:30] he will tell us these things and Jesus
[53:33] saith unto her I that speak unto thee am
[53:37] he and upon this came his disciples and
[53:40] Marvel that he talked with the woman yet
[53:44] no man said what seekest thou or why
[53:47] talkest with her think of that here they
[53:50] come they're wonder what in the world is
[53:51] he doing talking to this Samaritan and
[53:54] the woman then left her water pot and
[53:56] went her way into the City and saith to
[53:59] the men come see a man which told me all
[54:03] the things that I ever did is this the
[54:07] Christ and I just think what's so
[54:09] beautiful about the picture here she is
[54:11] in that condition and now she's standing
[54:14] face to face with the word made flesh
[54:16] and as it discerns the thoughts and
[54:18] intense of her heart here here the word
[54:22] telling her look you don't even know
[54:23] what you worship but the hour is coming
[54:26] and now is where the true worshipper
[54:29] shall Worship in spirit and in truth and
[54:32] as the word was going forth under her
[54:34] and as as her heart was being discerned
[54:37] I just I I just imagine the pictures
[54:40] completely changing here here he's
[54:41] telling her you don't know what you
[54:43] worship but now as as he starts to
[54:46] discern the thoughts and intents of her
[54:47] heart and she's w Wait a second is this
[54:50] not the Christ and he says I am e now
[54:52] she knows what to worship now she's
[54:54] running back into the city here she's
[54:57] been shot by the city she came and says
[55:00] unto the man of the city look no doubt
[55:02] there could have been people in that
[55:03] presence that despised her and maybe one
[55:06] she had relationship with but she's
[55:08] coming back regardless of her past
[55:10] regardless of situations because now
[55:12] she's come face to face with the Messiah
[55:15] and now she knows where the word is at
[55:17] it's in
[55:18] Christ it's in the Messiah is this not
[55:21] him is this not the
[55:24] Messiah
[55:25] for the father seeketh such to worship
[55:28] those that worship Him in spirit and in
[55:31] truth and just reading out of perfect
[55:33] Faith the prophet would say the Bible
[55:34] said in Acts 2 that Jesus of Nazareth a
[55:37] man approved of God Anointed with the
[55:39] Holy
[55:41] Ghost went about and done great works
[55:43] and things see that God manifest and
[55:46] proved that he was in this
[55:48] man and now we become Anointed with that
[55:53] same spirit anointed Messiahs Messiahs
[55:57] of the last day to shine forth the
[56:00] resurrection of Jesus Christ to show
[56:03] that he is not dead but in the form of
[56:05] the Holy Ghost he's in his
[56:09] people moving among his bride with a
[56:13] love affair to her pouring out into her
[56:16] himself there becoming one for the
[56:18] wedding supper and the same signs
[56:21] promised by the same God in the same
[56:23] word is making the same
[56:26] manifestations there's nothing left for
[56:29] us to do but believe it and believe that
[56:33] it is substance and that creates a
[56:36] perfect faith I love how the prophet
[56:38] just boils that down and makes it so
[56:40] simply he says there's nothing left to
[56:42] do but just believe it and that creates
[56:45] a perfect Faith we're we're we're trying
[56:47] to manufacture and and try to come up
[56:49] with a perfect Faith he's just telling
[56:51] you to believe the word that's going
[56:52] forth and as you receive the word you
[56:54] become the
[56:56] word just believe it and as you believe
[56:59] it that creates the perfect Faith you
[57:02] want to go in a Rapture you want to go
[57:04] in a body change believe the word
[57:06] believe the message faith comes by
[57:08] hearing the word you want a body change
[57:10] you want to be pleasing to the Lord just
[57:12] believe it there's nothing left for you
[57:14] to do but believe it because as you
[57:16] receive the word as you believe the word
[57:18] you become the word you are the word
[57:21] you're the word being made manifest
[57:23] you're expressing the word the same
[57:24] finds the same
[57:26] wonders we don't have to look back 60
[57:29] years 70 years to know that God is among
[57:31] us we're a house full of
[57:35] Miracles we're not a dead church this CH
[57:38] church is alive with the same
[57:42] manifestations we we have Divine
[57:44] Miracles represented amongst
[57:47] us we don't have to look to the Flesh
[57:50] and into a a sick body to wonder if the
[57:53] Supernatural is amongst us
[57:57] we thank God for Divine Healing we thank
[57:59] God for healing in our bodies we thank
[58:01] God that he said by my stripes you are
[58:03] healed and we know that we are healed we
[58:05] accept that we believe that but I say oh
[58:07] we our body can be healed and it will
[58:09] become sick again but but what about the
[58:12] soul oh could there be a greater Miracle
[58:15] than one that was lost in sin and didn't
[58:18] know his way and didn't know what to
[58:20] worship and then God came and called you
[58:22] he came and changed you he came saved
[58:25] you oh you became born again and filled
[58:27] with the Holy Ghost and now the same
[58:29] life that was in Jesus Christ is now
[58:32] living in you declaring he is not dead
[58:34] but he is
[58:37] alive oh that's a
[58:39] miracle and we just want to maybe speak
[58:42] to you if God will help us along the
[58:43] lines of anointed to worship all right
[58:47] anointed to worship you're I want to say
[58:49] you're being Anointed with
[58:52] something I mean you you just you look
[58:55] at this world and and and the and the
[58:57] pressures and everything that's pressing
[58:58] in you're you're going to be Uh
[59:00] something's going to rub off on
[59:03] you you're going to be anointed by
[59:05] something we know there's only two
[59:06] Powers there's the power of God and the
[59:08] power of
[59:09] Satan and it's just whichever one you
[59:12] want to connect yourself
[59:15] to you know I I I I like how a brother
[59:18] brandom said one time he he said you
[59:20] know Satan voted against me God voted
[59:23] for me now who are you who are you going
[59:24] cast your vote to I he said I voted for
[59:26] Jesus a long time
[59:28] ago you know you you you don't realize
[59:31] it but many times we vote with our time
[59:33] and our decisions and the way we conduct
[59:36] ourselves yes thank God we're
[59:38] predestinated and our name was written
[59:40] in the Lamb's Book of Life but but as
[59:43] Sons and Daughters you know those I love
[59:44] I rebuke and I chase and we have to go
[59:46] through a learning process we got to be
[59:49] child trained we got to be spanked we
[59:52] got to be talked and uh taught and you
[59:54] you don't realize a lot of the decisions
[59:56] and the things that we spend our time
[59:57] doing you're linking up with the wrong
[1:00:00] anointing you wonder why you find
[1:00:02] yourself in a peculiar situation and you
[1:00:05] give into a besetting sin or something
[1:00:07] like that is because maybe you're not
[1:00:09] walking in the spirit you're not you're
[1:00:11] not using the discernment and you're not
[1:00:13] connected to the word you're not walking
[1:00:15] in that spirit and in truth anointed to
[1:00:18] worship giving God praise and giving him
[1:00:20] glory uhhh following after John 5:19 I
[1:00:23] do nothing but the father shows me to do
[1:00:25] we find ourselves walking down Pathways
[1:00:28] and deviating here or there and then we
[1:00:30] find ourselves giving our time and
[1:00:32] attention to thing and what are we
[1:00:36] worshiping right Paul taught us whatever
[1:00:38] you yield your members to that's what
[1:00:40] you become subject to that's what that's
[1:00:42] what you're surrendering yourself to you
[1:00:45] know Paul would speak about in in in in
[1:00:47] the scriptures he would say Redeeming
[1:00:49] the time because the times are evil that
[1:00:51] redeeming that that word is a powerful
[1:00:53] word it it it's speaks of a purchasing
[1:00:56] power that by your time you're you're
[1:00:59] actually purchasing and making that time
[1:01:02] yours but Satan's wanting to to to trick
[1:01:05] you and confuse you and he's wanting to
[1:01:07] give you substitutes and he's he's
[1:01:09] wanting to distract you and offer you
[1:01:11] things that you would make these
[1:01:12] decisions and actually give your time
[1:01:14] and attention to the things of the world
[1:01:16] but we got to redeem the time we want to
[1:01:19] link up to the supernatural I want to be
[1:01:22] I want to be anointed to worship him in
[1:01:25] spirit and in
[1:01:27] truth look look at the religious world
[1:01:30] yeah they're all anointed to worship and
[1:01:33] they can do a pretty fine job of
[1:01:35] it they can create an
[1:01:41] atmosphere you know they can they can
[1:01:43] get a moving and a
[1:01:45] stirring but if there's no
[1:01:48] word what's the
[1:01:51] benefit and maybe you know uh brother
[1:01:53] Brandon if you you do a study out on on
[1:01:55] true worship he would even speak of yeah
[1:01:58] yeah they they it's true worship they're
[1:02:00] they're sincere it's true worship but
[1:02:04] but if they're not a predestinated seed
[1:02:06] and if it's void of the word then really
[1:02:07] what are they worshiping because we know
[1:02:10] Satan appears as an angel of
[1:02:14] Light so we need to be careful you're
[1:02:16] going to be Anointed with
[1:02:18] something I I want to be Anointed with
[1:02:20] the Holy
[1:02:22] Ghost I want to I want to be anointed to
[1:02:25] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[1:02:28] just in laying a foundation brother
[1:02:29] Brandon would uh this text we took was
[1:02:31] out of God's chosen place of worship he
[1:02:33] says notice the second verse uh here in
[1:02:36] Deuteronomy 16 Worship in the place that
[1:02:39] I have chosen now you must worship God
[1:02:41] he said in the place that I have
[1:02:45] chosen not what someone else chose but
[1:02:49] what I have
[1:02:52] chosen we we many times want to choose
[1:02:55] the place we want to choose the hour we
[1:02:58] want to choose the time we want to be
[1:03:01] the leader we don't want to be the
[1:03:05] follower the place that I have chosen
[1:03:08] not what somebody else chose but what I
[1:03:09] have chosen now if God chose a place it
[1:03:13] behooves us then to find out what he
[1:03:16] said about it and where it
[1:03:20] is I want to find
[1:03:23] it Hey listen to The Prophet well if the
[1:03:26] prophet wanted to find it I want to find
[1:03:28] it says I want to find it because truly
[1:03:32] I want to worship him we are all here
[1:03:36] tonight to worship him well I just want
[1:03:39] to say if you didn't know why you came
[1:03:41] here
[1:03:43] tonight you came here to worship
[1:03:45] him and I don't know how you worship but
[1:03:48] you don't have to worship like I worship
[1:03:51] and that's the beautiful thing about
[1:03:53] God's economy because a big bouquet of
[1:03:55] roses and and and N none of us are likee
[1:03:58] brother Brandon we even talk about a
[1:03:59] thumb print you know none of us are
[1:04:01] likee you don't have to worship like me
[1:04:03] and I don't have to worship like you but
[1:04:05] one thing I want to tell you I want to
[1:04:07] worship God with all of my heart I want
[1:04:09] to worship him with all of my soul I
[1:04:11] want to worship him 100% I don't want to
[1:04:14] be 80% I don't want to be 50% but if the
[1:04:17] prophet of God said we came here tonight
[1:04:19] to worship then I want to worship him I
[1:04:22] want to worship him with everything
[1:04:23] that's in I want to give my all I I want
[1:04:26] to give my all to the word I want to get
[1:04:28] behind the word I want to give him glory
[1:04:30] I want to give him praise I call his
[1:04:32] presence to come down amongst us I want
[1:04:34] to see the sick healed I I want to see
[1:04:36] the Lost saved I want to see his power
[1:04:38] manifested Among Us I've come to worship
[1:04:40] Him in spirit and in truth I want to see
[1:04:43] the same signs I want to see the same
[1:04:44] wonders it doesn't get old to me
[1:04:46] something in my heart is longing and
[1:04:48] yearning for the supernatural I want to
[1:04:51] live in the Supernatural I want to see
[1:04:53] the supernatural I want to see demon
[1:04:55] Spirits cast out I want to see limbs
[1:04:57] grown back I want to see it all because
[1:05:00] it's my inheritance I'm not going to
[1:05:02] stop short I'm not going to back up I'm
[1:05:04] not going to give up it might be a
[1:05:06] Sunday night with just a few of us but I
[1:05:08] come to see God I come to see the
[1:05:10] supernatural I come to see him sweep
[1:05:12] through the building it doesn't need to
[1:05:14] be a packed house it doesn't need to be
[1:05:16] a convention all it needs to be is two
[1:05:18] or three where I am gathered I'll be in
[1:05:20] your midst to perform my
[1:05:22] word what did you come to see what did

[1:06:06] or you can get away from it but the
[1:06:07] prophet of God said the problem is
[1:06:09] either Believe it or you
[1:06:11] don't you're either for it or you're not
[1:06:14] I say it's time to get with
[1:06:17] it let's get into
[1:06:19] action I don't want a halfway
[1:06:22] worship I want a worshiping with
[1:06:24] everything that's in me with all my
[1:06:27] heart and soul oh I like how the prophet
[1:06:30] of God said it like this he said I'm so
[1:06:32] thankful my name is on the book tonight
[1:06:35] wrote by the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:06:37] wrote by his blood across it pardoned oh
[1:06:40] my you'll think I'm a Holy Roller after
[1:06:42] a while sure enough but brother when I
[1:06:44] think of the blood of Christ that
[1:06:46] pardoned my book of
[1:06:48] sin when I think of the blood of Jesus
[1:06:50] Christ that pardoned my book of sin and
[1:06:53] throwed it in the see of forgetfulness
[1:06:55] it makes me get happy and
[1:06:58] rejoicing I love him with all my heart
[1:07:01] if the old time power of God that's
[1:07:03] saved me and has kept me through the age
[1:07:06] I love him with all my heart tonight and
[1:07:08] I take my stand with Paul of all in the
[1:07:10] way that's called heresy so I worship
[1:07:12] the god of my fathers I'm not ashamed of
[1:07:15] the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is a
[1:07:17] power of God un salvation to those that
[1:07:20] believe oh isn't that
[1:07:22] marvelous
[1:07:25] you ever get down and out why don't you
[1:07:26] start thinking about
[1:07:28] that start thinking about the
[1:07:32] blood start thinking about your name
[1:07:34] being written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:07:37] think about that book of sin and in his
[1:07:38] own blood he wrote a crosses had
[1:07:42] pardoned when I start thinking about
[1:07:44] that I start rejoicing I start getting
[1:07:48] happy do you do you realize what what
[1:07:50] you had waiting for
[1:07:52] you
[1:07:55] a burning
[1:07:57] hell misery and torment because you
[1:07:59] deserve
[1:08:01] it well maybe let me talk to myself then
[1:08:04] because some of you are like wait a
[1:08:07] second we were all born in
[1:08:10] sin I don't care if you grew up uh Lily
[1:08:14] white on a message Pew and you you you
[1:08:16] you you you read your Bible every single
[1:08:18] day and you've come to every church and
[1:08:20] you prayed and you hold Bible I don't
[1:08:22] care you're a sinner
[1:08:24] and you need the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] to forgive you for your
[1:08:32] sin doesn't do good enough just to go to
[1:08:37] church and I believe you can have the
[1:08:39] same experience you don't have to go out
[1:08:41] there and be marred in the things of the
[1:08:43] world and and go out there and taste sin
[1:08:45] and and go out there and see what it's
[1:08:47] all about to know what it means to be
[1:08:49] redeemed oh that's just a lie of the
[1:08:52] devil oh all this stuff I hear people
[1:08:54] delivered of I think I'll just look into
[1:08:56] watch up what youing up
[1:08:58] to you're going to be Anointed with
[1:09:02] something you better watch out you'll
[1:09:04] see something the devil put the hooks in
[1:09:06] you sin is a it's a steep a slippery
[1:09:10] slope you think you can just step off
[1:09:13] there a little bit I'll just see what
[1:09:15] it's all about you take one little step
[1:09:18] and you're like well I mean I'm just
[1:09:20] looking and all of a sudden you'll be
[1:09:22] looking back up a a a 40 mile Cliff
[1:09:26] wondering how in the world did I ever
[1:09:27] get down
[1:09:29] here just like brother Bram tells a
[1:09:32] story about his friend that was that was
[1:09:34] walking by and heard the
[1:09:37] music she had been
[1:09:39] delivered she had been set
[1:09:43] free but she just was curious oh I
[1:09:47] wonder if who it is over there and and
[1:09:49] maybe maybe what they're doing I'll just
[1:09:52] take a peek
[1:09:54] and before she knew it she was out on
[1:09:56] the dance floor in the arms of another
[1:09:58] man she come down I believe to the
[1:10:01] prophet's house banging on the oh oh
[1:10:02] Bill oh Bill oh Bill he's like what's
[1:10:04] wrong what's wrong what's wrong and she
[1:10:06] tells him the story that hey you you
[1:10:08] think that story is just there for for
[1:10:11] for just for for happen stance that's
[1:10:14] for you that story is for me it's a
[1:10:17] warning telling me son don't you stop
[1:10:20] for one
[1:10:21] second that's all it takes that that's
[1:10:24] all Satan's trying to do is to buy that
[1:10:26] time and to rob you to drop a seed in
[1:10:29] there to sew a seed uh to draw you and
[1:10:31] entice you away by your flesh and When
[1:10:33] sin is conceived it bringeth forth
[1:10:36] death none of us are exempt from
[1:10:40] that maybe you've you've you've come a
[1:10:42] little bit further but may we say like
[1:10:44] Jesus that I sanctify myself for their
[1:10:47] sake just because you can handle it
[1:10:50] doesn't mean somebody else
[1:10:52] can
[1:10:55] I I don't want to go go down these lines
[1:10:58] but the the way that we
[1:11:01] dress is very
[1:11:05] important we we don't just want to be
[1:11:07] borderline because we can be
[1:11:11] borderline how many bracelets do you
[1:11:13] need to wear
[1:11:15] anyways how many necklaces you got to
[1:11:17] wear
[1:11:18] anyways you're not satisfied with the
[1:11:20] color of your hair that God gave you
[1:11:25] there's
[1:11:26] pressure there's
[1:11:29] pressure you know you can get into I did
[1:11:32] a whole study one time on what they call
[1:11:33] good hair do you realize there was a
[1:11:35] pressure Upon Our precious uh
[1:11:37] African-American sisters on their
[1:11:40] hair go go back in look and study the
[1:11:42] good hair they weren't allowed in
[1:11:44] certain places because they they didn't
[1:11:46] want their natural
[1:11:48] hair but we don't want to talk about
[1:11:50] these things but then the pressure of
[1:11:51] the West has robbed some of our sisters
[1:11:54] to think that the hair God gave you
[1:11:56] isn't good enough I rebuke that
[1:12:00] Spirit one time I heard a sister tell
[1:12:02] I'll show you what long hair is just sit
[1:12:05] them all back there and and the girl
[1:12:06] with long hair has long long I rebuked
[1:12:09] him I said don't you tell me that some
[1:12:11] of my sisters from Africa their hair
[1:12:13] might only be an inch long but I said
[1:12:15] it's long and flowing in the glory of
[1:12:17] God because not a scissor has touched it
[1:12:19] that is long hair that is uncut hair
[1:12:23] that is pleasing to my Lord that's
[1:12:26] worshiping the father in spirit and in
[1:12:33] truth he you don't think you think I
[1:12:35] don't know what I'm talking about no I
[1:12:36] I've heard this one of my customers told
[1:12:39] me they got sick and tired of the
[1:12:40] pressure of how my hair should be and
[1:12:43] she said I just wanted to be free from
[1:12:45] it she's not no
[1:12:51] believer that's the pressure of the age
[1:12:53] that that we're living
[1:12:55] in It's Your
[1:12:58] Glory on it be proud of it wear
[1:13:04] it it's what God gave
[1:13:08] you now if and I'm not speaking about
[1:13:11] adding or doing the things some do if
[1:13:13] you if God has dealt with your heart and
[1:13:15] you're comfortable with that we know
[1:13:16] there's there's places for that God
[1:13:18] bless you don't don't let Satan try to
[1:13:20] turn things but what I'm talking about
[1:13:22] is it's not be living under the pressure
[1:13:24] of society that you have to look a
[1:13:26] certain
[1:13:29] way we all want to be accepted by
[1:13:31] co-workers and by by uh by by our
[1:13:34] schoolmates and everything what about
[1:13:37] God what is he
[1:13:40] desire what does he want when's it have
[1:13:43] you ever stood in the mirror and looked
[1:13:46] in the mirror said Lord is this pleasing
[1:13:48] to
[1:13:49] you if you did some of you wouldn't sh
[1:13:52] should be preaching pring this maybe on
[1:13:54] another service night but some of you
[1:13:55] wouldn't show up that way maybe it's a
[1:13:58] little more pastorial forgive me I'm
[1:14:00] just taking my Liberty because something
[1:14:02] in me there ought to be a liberty to
[1:14:04] worship Him in spirit and in truth not a
[1:14:06] pressure from society not a pressure
[1:14:08] from denominations not a pressure from
[1:14:10] the church but a pressure of the love of
[1:14:13] God of pressing down upon your soul that
[1:14:15] you want to love them that you want to
[1:14:17] please them that you want to worship
[1:14:20] them with everything that's within you
[1:14:26] look at our text here just moving
[1:14:32] along woman at the well she didn't know
[1:14:34] where to worship how to
[1:14:37] worship but he said the hour cometh and
[1:14:40] now is I say oh God May the hour come to
[1:14:44] me May the hour be now for me Lord that
[1:14:47] I might worship you in spirit and in
[1:14:50] truth have I been doing it by uh uh uh
[1:14:54] by by just responsibility have I been
[1:14:56] just uh doing it out of
[1:15:02] obligation but something
[1:15:04] changed when that seed was quickened
[1:15:06] come and see a
[1:15:09] man see when the word starts to discern
[1:15:12] the thought and intent of the
[1:15:15] heart when it tells you where you come
[1:15:19] from where you're
[1:15:21] going come on
[1:15:25] anybody know what I'm talking
[1:15:28] about put on any tape I don't care what
[1:15:30] it is listen the word's still a
[1:15:33] discerner it'll find you where you're at
[1:15:35] if you're
[1:15:37] listening turn it on say Lord tell me
[1:15:39] where I'm at where I'm going and where I
[1:15:42] come
[1:15:43] from just open up your ears and start
[1:15:46] listening to words of discerner of the
[1:15:47] thoughts and intents of the
[1:15:51] heart he's the same yesterday yesterday
[1:15:53] today and
[1:15:55] forever he'll show you things that were
[1:15:58] he'll show you things that are going to
[1:16:01] come he doesn't only show you where
[1:16:05] you're going but he shows you how to get
[1:16:08] there oh do you know how to get there
[1:16:12] well I think we read the quote a little
[1:16:13] earlier just said believe
[1:16:15] it that's some of the challenge some of
[1:16:18] us were struggling with what to believe
[1:16:20] the word has said about
[1:16:22] you
[1:16:24] oh yeah I think we'd be a lot further
[1:16:28] along than where we
[1:16:31] are the things that we struggle with
[1:16:34] some of the attitudes and things in the
[1:16:36] church that we deal with you know the
[1:16:39] the the the wrong attitude can knock
[1:16:42] somebody out of their
[1:16:45] healing here we
[1:16:46] are right here in this congregation
[1:16:49] brother Matthew you shouldn't say it I'm
[1:16:50] going to say it some of our attit udes
[1:16:54] are
[1:16:55] hindering the move of
[1:17:00] God what did he say the unconfessed sin
[1:17:03] of you
[1:17:04] Believers you
[1:17:06] Believers didn't say you
[1:17:09] Sinners didn't say you that have come to
[1:17:11] the house of God that need to be prayed
[1:17:13] for and delivered and filled with the
[1:17:14] Holy Ghost he said the unconfessed sin
[1:17:16] of you
[1:17:20] Believers can cause this church to
[1:17:22] bitter L
[1:17:25] fail now I want to Worship the Lord with
[1:17:27] all of my heart I want to worship Him in
[1:17:30] spirit and in truth so if there's little
[1:17:32] things like this we got to make right
[1:17:34] let's make it right let's get the show
[1:17:37] on the road I I I want to I want to do
[1:17:40] my part I want to be anointed to worship
[1:17:42] God in spirit and in truth and say Lord
[1:17:45] if there's anything in me that is not
[1:17:47] pleasing unto you Lord I'm ready for a
[1:17:49] body change I'm ready to go in an exodus
[1:17:52] Lord I I'm ready to get out of here I'm
[1:17:54] ready to do all that you've commanded me
[1:17:55] to do and if there's something in my
[1:17:57] heart if there's something in my life
[1:17:59] that isn't pleasing you Lord here I am
[1:18:01] I'm laying myself open I'm laying myself
[1:18:03] be and when you see schisms and things
[1:18:05] going on through the church maybe we
[1:18:07] ought to look inwardly and wonder Lord
[1:18:09] is there something I could have done is
[1:18:11] there a way that you could have used me
[1:18:12] and was I not sensitive to your holy
[1:18:15] spirit that I could have been part of
[1:18:16] the
[1:18:18] solution maybe God would bring you into
[1:18:20] prayer and he'd bring you upon your
[1:18:22] knees
[1:18:25] we can differ upon Creeds we can differ
[1:18:28] upon man-made theories you can go to a
[1:18:31] Methodist Church you can uh you have to
[1:18:34] be a Methodist a Baptist or a Catholic
[1:18:37] but when once you're baptized into
[1:18:40] Christ and become a member of his body

[1:18:46] differences the middle walls of
[1:18:48] partition is tore down and you are free
[1:18:52] because you are in Christ and you

[1:24:23] were not
[1:24:25] free they were in bondage to fear they
[1:24:29] were in bondage to the condition of the
[1:24:33] age but there was a people that was
[1:24:35] seated in Heavenly
[1:24:37] places that were holding on to that word
[1:24:40] though you slay me Lord I trust

[1:24:56] could do it there I can do it here if I
[1:25:00] if I'm living in the hour where the word
[1:25:02] has been opened up and it's the it's the
[1:25:04] greatest age that that's ever struck the
[1:25:07] Earth Lord that I can give my all to
[1:25:08] serve
[1:25:10] you the middle wall of petition has been
[1:25:12] torn down we're free to worship and free
[1:25:16] to praise him that's God's plan for your
[1:25:19] life is to worship
[1:25:21] Him
[1:25:23] we'll try not to be too long you pull a
[1:25:25] little harder maybe the faster we'll go
[1:25:27] and we can get out of
[1:25:30] here free to worship him I'm not talking
[1:25:34] about denominationalism
[1:25:36] worship you know Cain had that down to
[1:25:38] the
[1:25:41] letter he built that beautiful
[1:25:43] altar but if we're not careful we're
[1:25:45] doing the same
[1:25:47] thing we build our programs we build our
[1:25:50] works we build our routine we build our
[1:25:52] habits and we get comfortable around
[1:25:55] that but Jesus said in vain do they
[1:25:57] worship me teaching the uh doctrine of
[1:26:01] man for the Commandments of God Amen in
[1:26:03] vain do they worship
[1:26:05] me with with their lips they give me
[1:26:08] praise but their hearts are far from me
[1:26:11] I say oh
[1:26:12] God lord never let let me never get to
[1:26:15] that place Lord when I find myself in
[1:26:18] just the routine and and and where I've
[1:26:20] allowed a routine or for a pattern of go
[1:26:23] of Good Works to be a substitute for
[1:26:26] coming into your presence to be a
[1:26:28] substitute for crying out for Revelation
[1:26:31] for being a substitute to seek in your
[1:26:33] face God uh check my life help me call
[1:26:36] me Lord may I Surrender away from those
[1:26:38] things and find myself longing oh God
[1:26:41] come to me in this hour Lord speak to my
[1:26:43] heart Reveal Your word to me Lord
[1:26:45] correct me where I'm Wrong
[1:26:50] Am we got people that live live any kind
[1:26:52] of way they want to live and call
[1:26:54] themselves Christians dress any kind of
[1:26:56] way listen to any kind of
[1:26:59] music we have people that call
[1:27:01] themselves
[1:27:02] Believers I'm not to be the judge but I
[1:27:05] I
[1:27:06] think it would scare
[1:27:09] us if we knew how many would stand on
[1:27:11] that day and see depart from me you
[1:27:14] doers of iniquity I never knew
[1:27:20] you I I I think it'll be
[1:27:23] surprising I pray it wouldn't be any
[1:27:25] amongst
[1:27:26] us but my Bible tells me it' be so close
[1:27:29] that it would deceive the very elective
[1:27:32] possible that be it apart from a
[1:27:34] predestinated
[1:27:36] seed oh thank God for
[1:27:40] predestination thank God for his grace
[1:27:43] thank God for his Mercy thank God for
[1:27:46] his love thank God for his protection
[1:27:48] thank God for his power thank God for
[1:27:50] keeping me thank God for for loving me
[1:27:53] thank God for reserving a seat up there
[1:27:55] for me in
[1:27:57] heaven well when I get to thinking about
[1:27:59] it I get to
[1:28:02] rejoicing it makes me happy it gets me
[1:28:04] excited I know what I was I know where I
[1:28:07] came
[1:28:08] from but oh the grace of
[1:28:13] God prophet of God would say this in the
[1:28:15] patmas vision then the most most of them
[1:28:17] go to church on Sunday that is good but
[1:28:20] even there they have no idea of how to
[1:28:23] approach God and to worship Him Jesus
[1:28:26] said that true worship was in spirit and
[1:28:29] in truth John 4:24 but what kind of
[1:28:33] worship can you get in a church that
[1:28:35] knows so little of God it puts up Santa
[1:28:38] Claus at Christmas and bunnies at Easter
[1:28:41] where did they get that they got it from
[1:28:44] pagans and made it a part of the church
[1:28:45] doctrine but when one turns to the Lord
[1:28:49] there it
[1:28:51] is
[1:28:54] that doesn't have to be out
[1:28:56] there right
[1:28:58] here right here it can be in this
[1:29:03] service but when one turns to the Lord
[1:29:06] and is filled with the Holy Ghost he
[1:29:09] ceases from all such
[1:29:11] things he has a rest in his
[1:29:15] soul he really begins to live and love
[1:29:18] God and worship
[1:29:20] him does anybody know what that's
[1:29:27] like you really begin to live you really
[1:29:30] begin to love
[1:29:32] God you really begin to worship
[1:29:36] him I I would say that if if if the
[1:29:39] message if the word of God feels like
[1:29:41] its rules and
[1:29:44] regulations and and you're constantly
[1:29:46] doing your best to abstain from lust
[1:29:49] you're you're constantly doing your best
[1:29:51] uh uh to to dress right you're you're
[1:29:53] constantly uh uh you know it's like a
[1:29:56] struggle and and and you're you're
[1:29:59] always breaking the rules and then
[1:30:01] you're always feeling condemned and then
[1:30:03] you always need to be prayed for and you
[1:30:05] always need to be encouraged and and
[1:30:07] you're on this big roller
[1:30:09] coaster that's not
[1:30:13] living if you if you're under the sound
[1:30:15] of my voice and you're going through
[1:30:17] that type of Lifestyle I want to say
[1:30:19] there's more for you God bless you for
[1:30:22] fighting God bless you for struggling
[1:30:24] but you don't have to struggle with
[1:30:26] those things there comes a place where
[1:30:28] you can turn to the Lord and old things
[1:30:31] pass away and All Things become new and
[1:30:34] you're born and filled with the spirit
[1:30:36] of God and now you can worship Him in
[1:30:39] spirit and in truth there's a real
[1:30:40] Liberty you can say I am free I'm really
[1:30:43] free to worship I'm really free to
[1:30:46] praise him I'm really free to give my
[1:30:48] all I don't worry I have to worry about
[1:30:50] the fashion trends I don't have to worry
[1:30:52] about my friends I don't have to worry
[1:30:54] about social media I don't have to worry
[1:30:56] about what they say about me at work
[1:30:57] Lord I'm going to live this message with
[1:30:59] all of my heart Lord and what becomes me
[1:31:02] becomes me but you are with me I am not
[1:31:05] alone because you are with me Lord every
[1:31:07] step of the way there's your Liberty

[1:41:41] Christ David was anointed for the job
[1:41:44] the prophet said you will be

[1:42:20] David
[1:42:21] he was anointed for the
[1:42:24] job so when The Lion and the bear came
[1:42:27] he slew
[1:42:29] it God was training him so when Goliath

[1:43:08] to fear sickness you don't have to fear
[1:43:10] the demon oppressed you don't have to
[1:43:13] fear anything because you're living in
[1:43:16] love in a love relationship in a love
[1:43:19] affair moving quickly to a
[1:43:22] close how can we do it through anything
[1:43:25] else but the perfect word of God which
[1:43:27] is the Waters of
[1:43:29] Separation that washes us from
[1:43:32] sins that's right the blood of Christ
[1:43:35] think of it the dripping bloody word
[1:43:38] amen the blood the word of God bleeding
[1:43:41] blood to wash the bride
[1:43:44] in amen yes sir she stands perfect
[1:43:49] virgin unad adulterated she never sinned

[1:44:03] it you're
[1:44:06] forgiven you never did it in the F it's
[1:44:09] time you act like
[1:44:13] it there is therefore now no
[1:44:15] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:44:19] Jesus now you're starting to
[1:44:24] live when you start believing what he
[1:44:28] said then you can get past your mistakes
[1:44:30] and your
[1:44:32] failures and really start to love them
[1:44:35] really start to worship
[1:44:37] him really start to give him praise
[1:44:40] really start to accept what he did for
[1:44:42] you really start to move into that third
[1:44:45] pool and start to have an expectation
[1:44:47] for the Greater Works because you know
[1:44:50] Lord it's not what I did it's what you
[1:44:54] did if you forgave me if you put it all
[1:44:57] in the sea of God's forgetfulness if you
[1:44:59] said I'm without spot and I'm the
[1:45:01] sinless blameless bride of Jesus Christ
[1:45:04] Lord then who am
[1:45:06] I who am I to say it's not so Lord I
[1:45:09] believe
[1:45:11] you and if you can do that then
[1:45:14] certainly you can perform your will in
[1:45:17] my

[1:45:39] it I know we all go through
[1:45:43] that do anybody ever not wanted to go to
[1:45:49] church
[1:45:52] sometimes you know you let the flesh
[1:45:53] talk and then you got to slap it I
[1:45:55] really don't feel like going to
[1:45:57] church shut shut your mouth
[1:46:01] boy
[1:46:03] yeah sometimes your flesh will start
[1:46:05] talking but what you don't want to do is
[1:46:06] let it keep running its
[1:46:08] mouth you say hold him up I know you're
[1:46:10] tired
[1:46:12] boy but Christ was more tired than
[1:46:16] you he went from The Upper Room walked
[1:46:19] all the way down in the garden of
[1:46:22] cimity his blood
[1:46:25] separated blood come out of his head he
[1:46:27] didn't never even sleep then was dragged
[1:46:29] into this cart and that car was beaten
[1:46:31] was
[1:46:33] fogged then I had to carry a cross up
[1:46:36] calary I think he was tired the least I
[1:46:39] can do is make it to his
[1:46:41] house got a fancy car and a nice suit
[1:46:44] with
[1:46:46] AC yeah when you start looking at the
[1:46:48] other way you kind of feel a little
[1:46:50] foolish foolish I got it pretty good you
[1:46:53] need to get your act together you little
[1:46:57] softy you call yourself a rugged
[1:47:03] Christian
[1:47:05] really I'm preaching to myself a little
[1:47:07] bit that's all
[1:47:09] right oh my I I don't want to be bound
[1:47:12] to the ways of man I don't want to be
[1:47:13] bound to this flesh I want to be
[1:47:16] free but it's in the times you don't
[1:47:19] feel like it
[1:47:21] it's in the time of Despair it's in the
[1:47:24] time of the
[1:47:26] trial that you've been anointed to
[1:47:30] worship look at Paul and
[1:47:34] Silas they had been beaten and thrown in
[1:47:38] jail and I'm guessing they didn't have
[1:47:40] padded
[1:47:44] chairs they were in a Roman cell they
[1:47:47] had been beaten they had been flogged
[1:47:49] they they had uh uh ankle uh bracelet
[1:47:53] chains around them they were chained to
[1:47:56] the wall and what did they
[1:48:00] do they begin to
[1:48:03] praise and worship the
[1:48:07] Lord oh Hallelujah you know there's
[1:48:10] power in
[1:48:12] worship there's power in your
[1:48:16] praise and in their Despair and in their
[1:48:23] trial look Abraham said look uh y'all
[1:48:26] stay here while me and the lad Go In
[1:48:29] Worship that didn't sound like a pretty
[1:48:31] worship
[1:48:32] service he was going to sacrifice his
[1:48:37] son but it's in the times when it's not
[1:48:40] pretty it's in the times when it's
[1:48:43] rugged it's in the time of
[1:48:47] Despair when you allow that anointed
[1:48:49] word word within you that says by his
[1:48:53] stripes I'm
[1:48:54] Healed I will praise the
[1:49:00] Lord and what does the scripture say
[1:49:03] while they were giving him praise it
[1:49:05] says and
[1:49:08] suddenly I like that word and suddenly
[1:49:12] maybe you just need to start praising
[1:49:14] the Lord and worshiping the Lord in your
[1:49:17] condition in your despair your sickness
[1:49:21] and your trial maybe it's in that
[1:49:23] condition in that place for your family
[1:49:25] for your loved one for whatever why
[1:49:27] don't you just start praising the Lord
[1:49:29] worshiping the Lord and then suddenly
[1:49:31] there was an earthquake and the bands
[1:49:34] and the bonds and the walls were shaking
[1:49:36] and the jail Cil doors came open all
[1:49:39] because of their worship unto the Lord
[1:49:42] maybe if you can play something
[1:49:44] softly you've been anointed to
[1:49:49] worship I think if
[1:49:53] anybody has been anointed to worship
[1:49:55] it's the Bride of Jesus
[1:49:58] Christ has your name been written on the
[1:50:01] Lamb's Book of
[1:50:03] Life have you been pardoned have you
[1:50:05] been
[1:50:06] forgiven have you heard from your
[1:50:11] theophany are you caught away in the
[1:50:13] Rapture
[1:50:15] cycle do you have the promise of your
[1:50:19] family
[1:50:21] come
[1:50:24] on did you not believe for years when
[1:50:26] the promise was he not
[1:50:30] faithful year after year after year you
[1:50:33] prayed and believed and believed and was
[1:50:35] God not
[1:50:39] faithful he's
[1:50:42] faithful I think he's worthy of
[1:50:45] Praise I think he's
[1:50:47] worthy for us to tell them how much we
[1:50:50] love
[1:50:52] them I got one last
[1:50:55] [Music]
[1:51:01] quote now Mary could have waited till
[1:51:04] she had some kind of
[1:51:06] sign that she was going to be
[1:51:10] mother and you could wait after the
[1:51:12] meeting's over until you feel that you
[1:51:16] could move your crippled leg just a
[1:51:18] little better
[1:51:21] or you could hear a little better out of
[1:51:24] that deaf ear or the cancer seemed to be
[1:51:28] that it wasn't bothering you so
[1:51:31] much that's not taking God at his
[1:51:39] word this the last quote let's focus in
[1:51:45] here that's not taking God at his word
[1:51:49] to take take God at his word is to hear
[1:51:52] his
[1:51:53] word and accept it and start rejoicing
[1:51:58] with
[1:52:00] it oh
[1:52:02] Hallelujah you don't have to wait for
[1:52:05] sensation you don't got to wait for a
[1:52:08] feeling you ain't got to wait for a
[1:52:10] doctor's note all you got to do is hear
[1:52:13] the word accept
[1:52:16] it
[1:52:18] and start rejoicing with
[1:52:24] it we could see 500 rush to the altar
[1:52:28] tonight which would be a good sign that
[1:52:30] the Revival is going to break we don't
[1:52:32] have to have 500 at the altar we just
[1:52:35] have to take God's word for it and start
[1:52:41] rejoicing something will happen somebody
[1:52:45] just need to start
[1:52:46] rejoicing that brings the word to life
[1:52:50] as we water it with
[1:52:52] praises what makes a seed grow water
[1:52:55] what makes the word of God grow is the
[1:52:58] Praises of God when Jesus told them to
[1:53:01] wait in the upper room the city of
[1:53:02] Jerusalem until they were endued with
[1:53:03] power from an eye that word fell on
[1:53:06] their ears they was in the temple
[1:53:09] continually praising God day and night
[1:53:12] what was they doing watering that
[1:53:16] promise and all of a sudden
[1:53:20] Hallelujah there came a sound from
[1:53:22] heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[1:53:25] filled all the house where they were
[1:53:27] sitting the word was being watered and
[1:53:30] it took life and started growing you're
[1:53:33] wanting a Revival start watering the
[1:53:37] word that makes me feel religious myself

[1:53:47] you want to come from that cancer start
[1:53:50] watering the word L riy tonight here is

[1:53:57] sicknesses thousands times thousands of
[1:53:59] infallible proofs oh that we've seen but
