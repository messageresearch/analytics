[20:22] amen
[20:41] god bless you
[20:43] we're going to go ahead and continue in
[20:44] psalm 119 this morning if you want to go
[20:46] ahead and turn there we'll be picking up
[20:48] in
[20:48] verse 89
[20:50] reading that
[20:51] kind of that portion this morning and
[20:54] as i was looking over that this week
[20:56] that first verse really caught my
[20:58] attention
[20:59] and it says simply this
[21:02] forever o lord
[21:04] thy word is settled
[21:06] in heaven
[21:08] think about that what a statement
[21:11] thy word is settled
[21:14] forever amen
[21:18] you know i was thinking about that
[21:19] statement when we say that something is
[21:21] settled
[21:22] there's something final about that
[21:25] you know there's no
[21:27] question it ends all question
[21:29] there's no debate
[21:31] it's done as we sing in that song it's
[21:33] already done
[21:36] you know i just was looking in webster's
[21:38] dictionary listen even to the words that
[21:40] webster's dictionary uses to describe
[21:42] settled
[21:45] it says to make quiet
[21:47] or orderly
[21:49] to establish or secure
[21:51] permanently
[21:53] to fix
[21:54] or resolve
[21:56] conclusively
[21:58] to arrange in a desired position
[22:01] to come to rest
[22:04] ms webster
[22:06] but look at those words rest
[22:10] quiet in order
[22:14] in position
[22:16] established
[22:19] secured
[22:21] arranged
[22:23] positioned fixed
[22:25] resolved
[22:28] forever oh lord
[22:30] thy word is settled
[22:32] in heaven
[22:35] you know i began to ask myself then
[22:38] then why do i worry
[22:41] why do i
[22:43] worry about the outcome of my
[22:45] circumstance
[22:49] of any circumstance
[22:51] of any situation
[22:54] why do i feel like i have to put my
[22:56] hands on things
[22:58] to try to change
[23:00] or to say something
[23:02] to try to affect
[23:04] thy word is settled
[23:07] in heaven
[23:10] do i need to help it
[23:12] is it settled
[23:14] or no
[23:17] you know jesus when he was speaking on
[23:18] the sermon on the mount
[23:20] when was teaching his disciples how to
[23:22] pray he said in matthew 6 10
[23:25] he said thy kingdom come
[23:27] thy will be done
[23:30] in earth
[23:32] as it is in heaven
[23:34] we know that his will is his word
[23:38] that's what we've been taught
[23:41] you know so
[23:42] if it's already settled in heaven
[23:46] then all
[23:47] we need is to see that manifest
[23:50] in the earth
[23:52] in this earth
[23:54] you know our prayer
[23:57] might be instead of
[23:59] i hope it goes this way or may it go
[24:01] this way or can you solve my problem or
[24:04] can you meet my need
[24:06] be it unto me according to thy word
[24:10] the word is already settled
[24:12] in heaven
[24:14] you know how many times did jesus say be
[24:17] not afraid
[24:18] only believe
[24:20] it's really just a question of whether
[24:22] this earth can get aligned with the word
[24:24] that's already settled in heaven
[24:27] where we get hung up where i get hung up
[24:31] is where i forget that that word is
[24:32] already settled
[24:34] regarding any circumstance and that i
[24:37] need to put some work to it
[24:40] you know be it unto me according to thy
[24:42] word let it be done in earth
[24:45] as it is in heaven
[24:48] you know the question is do we know what
[24:50] the word has declared
[24:53] and said about it
[24:55] and are we willing
[24:57] do we
[24:58] believe that ultimately this earth will
[25:01] match what's spoken
[25:04] and settled
[25:05] in heaven
[25:07] you know the portion of the psalm the
[25:09] last verse 96 david's observation is i
[25:12] have seen an end of all perfection
[25:15] you know what that means is the most
[25:16] perfect plans and efforts and creations
[25:19] of man
[25:20] the best we can do the best we can build
[25:23] the best we can think the best we can
[25:25] plan
[25:26] all comes to an end
[25:29] but thy commandment is exceeding broad
[25:32] that means there's no end to it i can't
[25:34] find the borders i can't find the edges
[25:38] you know so
[25:39] as we read this portion of the psalm
[25:41] this morning we're just going to read
[25:42] those eight verses verse 89 and 96 just
[25:45] you know as a reminder to me
[25:47] that everything we see in this earth is
[25:49] just things being positioned to match
[25:51] what's already settled in heaven
[25:54] in my prayer for myself is be it unto me
[25:57] according to thy word heaven and earth
[25:58] shall pass away
[26:00] but my word
[26:01] shall not
[26:02] let's read that portion of scripture
[26:04] this morning starting in verse 89
[26:06] forever o lord thy word is settled in
[26:09] heaven thy faithfulness is unto all
[26:11] generations thou hast established the
[26:14] earth and it abideth they continue this
[26:17] day according to thine ordinances for
[26:19] all are thy servants unless thy law had
[26:22] been my delights i should then have
[26:24] perished in mine affliction
[26:26] i will never forget thy precepts for
[26:29] with them thou hast quickened me
[26:31] i am nine save me for i have sought thy
[26:34] precepts the wicked have waited for me
[26:36] to destroy me but i will consider thy
[26:39] testimonies i have seen an end of all
[26:42] perfection but thy commandment is
[26:44] exceeding broad amen
[26:49] amen god bless you may be seated

[56:41] shelley so nice to have you this morning
[56:43] and wonderful presence of the lord
[56:46] with us ben you always bless me when you

[56:49] i hope your pathways at least it's a 50
[56:52] 50 isn't it 50 here
[56:55] at 50 in alabama is that good brother
[56:57] you go for that thank you my brother
[56:59] your smiles your smile tells it all
[57:02] right
[57:03] amen do you love god's work
[57:06] you know
[57:08] our whole existence is
[57:10] based on what was done for us in calvary
[57:16] that one great sacrifice for sin
[57:19] set so many of us
[57:22] free
[57:24] and there's only one place that god
[57:27] meets a man and that's under the shed
[57:29] blood
[57:30] you couldn't dance in the spirit
[57:33] you couldn't lift your hand
[57:35] if there wasn't a blood sacrifice
[57:37] that was laid
[57:39] and when this man died all our sins were
[57:42] remitted
[57:43] and there's no more consciousness of sin
[57:46] and
[57:48] it's so wonderful
[57:50] and
[57:51] that
[57:52] love there's a song that we're going to
[57:53] sing when
[57:57] we invite brother george this morning
[57:59] here is love
[58:01] vast as the ocean
[58:04] loving kindness
[58:06] as a flood when the prince of life
[58:10] a ransom
[58:12] shed for us
[58:14] his precious blood
[58:17] let's never forget it
[58:20] what a wonderful thing that is done so
[58:22] as we sing this this morning
[58:24] brother billy will help me sing
[58:27] remember that
[58:29] you're not approaching him this morning
[58:31] on your own merits
[58:35] you're not approaching him because you
[58:37] have anything to offer
[58:40] you're approaching him because he has a
[58:42] blood covering
[58:46] that you can walk up in the presence of
[58:48] that blood and
[58:49] that's what he sees
[58:52] he sees a forgiven sinner
[58:56] you see he doesn't see what's been
[58:58] thrown in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[59:01] that blood gives us equal access this
[59:03] morning to that throne
[59:06] so whatever
[59:07] request you have on your heart
[59:10] whatever desire that you ask god to do
[59:14] it's been purchased for you
[59:17] this great
[59:19] love
[59:20] that we sing about this morning
[59:22] as we invite our brother to come
[59:26] [Music]
[59:32] the
[59:33] [Music]
[59:39] [Applause]
[59:41] ocean think of it
[59:45] [Music]
[59:54] is
[59:56] [Music]
[1:00:04] [Music]

[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:22] forgotten

[1:01:42] says
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:02:04] is yourself
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:28] throughout the day
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:35] the reason that song is so special to me
[1:02:38] is because
[1:02:39] that is the song that characterized the
[1:02:42] welsh revival
[1:02:44] it was less than a year started in 1904
[1:02:47] ended in somewhere in 1905
[1:02:49] because one man
[1:02:51] fell on his face before god
[1:02:53] we need revival and god blessed that
[1:02:56] island
[1:02:58] people went from here over there where
[1:02:59] is it where is it
[1:03:01] looking for some big fantastic thing it
[1:03:03] was in the individual
[1:03:05] when that song was sung over there in
[1:03:07] their language
[1:03:09] people fell to their knees in the
[1:03:11] streets
[1:03:12] the bar rooms closed
[1:03:14] look it up wells revival
[1:03:17] brother roberts
[1:03:18] such a beautiful song let's sing this
[1:03:20] first verse again
[1:03:22] and just realize that our song only
[1:03:25] believed but that was the song then it
[1:03:28] caused
[1:03:29] great things over there
[1:03:30] here is a love
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:57] is

[1:06:55] you
[1:06:56] on a subject the time is now it's not
[1:07:00] yesterday it's not when brother branham
[1:07:02] it's now
[1:07:03] now is the time
[1:07:05] and so i want you all also to turn over
[1:07:07] to matthew chapter 24
[1:07:10] yeah don't put your bibles away we're in
[1:07:12] church it's going to get serious here in
[1:07:13] a little bit
[1:07:17] yeah guess what
[1:07:19] i brought the level
[1:07:22] it's got two or three purposes i'll let
[1:07:25] you guess what they
[1:07:26] are matthew chapter 24
[1:07:30] and verse 1
[1:07:32] jesus is um
[1:07:34] with the disciples
[1:07:37] they have
[1:07:38] left the tail they're walking away from
[1:07:40] the temple now
[1:07:41] it says and jesus went out and departed
[1:07:43] from the temple
[1:07:45] and his disciples came to him and showed
[1:07:47] him the great buildings of the temple
[1:07:48] look how marvelous all what you know
[1:07:51] herod has done so marvelous jesus said
[1:07:55] you see not you see all these things
[1:07:57] verily i say unto you there shall not be
[1:07:59] left here one stone upon the other that
[1:08:02] shall not be thrown down
[1:08:04] they didn't want to hear that they're
[1:08:06] proud of their
[1:08:07] temple
[1:08:09] he just took all the air out of their
[1:08:10] balloon
[1:08:12] and as he sat on the mount of olives
[1:08:14] that's 600 yards away now they're over
[1:08:16] the mount of olives looking at the
[1:08:17] temple
[1:08:18] the disciples came into him privately
[1:08:21] just just them in the master
[1:08:23] tell us
[1:08:24] just tell us privately
[1:08:26] when shall these things be
[1:08:28] what shall be the sign of thy coming and
[1:08:30] of the end of the world
[1:08:32] and jesus answered
[1:08:34] i see sometimes the answer is exactly
[1:08:36] what you want to hear
[1:08:38] but we're serving a god that can see all
[1:08:40] things all time
[1:08:42] he knows all your circumstances where
[1:08:44] you came from and why you're here what's
[1:08:46] the attraction on central avenue in
[1:08:47] bedford
[1:08:49] it's not personality it's the word of
[1:08:51] god
[1:08:53] so jesus said to them
[1:08:56] take heed in other words listen up
[1:08:57] people
[1:08:59] that no man deceive you
[1:09:02] what's that got to do with the questions
[1:09:04] lots for many
[1:09:07] shall come in my name
[1:09:08] saying i am christ
[1:09:10] and shall deceive many
[1:09:13] many are going to walk away because they
[1:09:15] paid attention to the wrong voice
[1:09:17] okay now go over to verse 23.
[1:09:20] then if any man shall say unto you oh
[1:09:22] here's christ or there believe it not
[1:09:25] for there shall arise false christs and
[1:09:28] false prophets
[1:09:29] and they shall show great signs and
[1:09:31] wonders
[1:09:32] in so much that if it were possible
[1:09:35] they shall deceive the very elect
[1:09:39] behold
[1:09:40] i told you
[1:09:42] it's coming
[1:09:43] you're already warned watch out
[1:09:46] in another translation it says verse
[1:09:49] 23-25 then if any man should say to you
[1:09:52] behold here's the christ or there
[1:09:54] do not believe it for there shall arise
[1:09:57] false christs
[1:09:59] and lying prophets
[1:10:01] and they shall show great signs and
[1:10:03] wonders so as to mislead if possible
[1:10:06] even the chosen ones
[1:10:08] behold i've told you in advance
[1:10:12] now quiet people don't scare me a bit
[1:10:16] that means you're listening
[1:10:19] and i don't know when i'm coming back
[1:10:21] so listen up
[1:10:23] so the level is here
[1:10:26] for a reason
[1:10:29] is to remind us to stay balanced
[1:10:32] now we had a fantastic supper last night
[1:10:35] and i tried to hold back and stay
[1:10:36] balanced but i saw some other guys
[1:10:40] they were
[1:10:41] they were headed this way
[1:10:43] you know
[1:10:45] we must stay balanced and what we eat
[1:10:47] what we say our whole operation
[1:10:50] is to stay balanced here today
[1:10:53] and especially those of you watching
[1:10:55] from the comfort of your home
[1:10:57] we've got people that they can't get in
[1:10:59] here we've got four chairs here but
[1:11:01] there's people watching
[1:11:02] you need to stay balanced also and pay
[1:11:04] attention to what we're saying
[1:11:06] okay
[1:11:07] so we're living in
[1:11:08] very dangerous times of church history
[1:11:13] now we think that we're in marvelous
[1:11:15] times because you know we all have our
[1:11:17] little magic thing here that
[1:11:19] in touch with anybody in the world and
[1:11:21] find out any facts any anything
[1:11:23] the whole world in your hand you don't
[1:11:25] have to worry about tv anymore it's
[1:11:26] right here
[1:11:28] but
[1:11:29] it's a deception be careful
[1:11:32] and so we have every kind of distraction
[1:11:34] every kind of deception
[1:11:35] and
[1:11:36] we want to know how to identify the
[1:11:38] dangers how to stay clear of them and
[1:11:40] stay balanced
[1:11:42] okay
[1:11:43] now this has another purpose
[1:11:45] those of you that were here last time
[1:11:48] don't be trying to fall asleep buddy
[1:11:50] because if i see anybody dozing off it's
[1:11:53] not my fault that you stayed up late
[1:11:54] last night
[1:11:56] and we don't have a coffee bar here
[1:11:58] but if i see anybody dozing off
[1:12:01] i can buy another one of these you know
[1:12:04] so
[1:12:06] revelations 19 turn your bibles so that
[1:12:09] you know we're not pulling
[1:12:11] funny stuff on your hair
[1:12:13] revelations 19 verse 7
[1:12:16] says
[1:12:17] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:12:19] honor to him
[1:12:20] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:12:22] and his wife has made herself ready
[1:12:26] and to her
[1:12:27] that's you
[1:12:28] not some angels no to
[1:12:30] god's bride to his wife to her was
[1:12:32] granted that she should be arrayed in
[1:12:34] fine linen
[1:12:36] clean and white for the linen for the
[1:12:38] fine linen is the righteousness of the
[1:12:41] saints
[1:12:42] that is coming very soon
[1:12:45] maybe tomorrow
[1:12:46] maybe friday i don't know but very very
[1:12:49] soon okay
[1:12:50] but in the meantime today
[1:12:53] right here in your daily life here in
[1:12:55] texas wherever you're from 2022
[1:12:58] there will
[1:12:59] arise false christ now we spent a lot of
[1:13:02] time preaching on positive promises and
[1:13:04] building the faith of the people and
[1:13:06] getting things you know pushed forward
[1:13:08] but i've got news for you there's some
[1:13:10] negative promises in the bible that are
[1:13:11] equally
[1:13:13] equal weight and they will come to pass
[1:13:16] whether you like it or not we got to
[1:13:18] take all the word
[1:13:20] when we go to the buffet we don't just
[1:13:22] take the chocolate pie no you got to
[1:13:24] take all of it you got to be right you
[1:13:26] got to be balanced you see
[1:13:29] so there will rise false christ that's
[1:13:31] anointed ones very anointed and cause
[1:13:34] others to believe yeah
[1:13:36] and lying prophets
[1:13:39] don't sound good does it
[1:13:41] because we know about one prophet well
[1:13:42] there's lying prophets also
[1:13:45] so they don't all speak the oracles of
[1:13:47] god
[1:13:48] with pure heart and mind in order to
[1:13:51] help god's people no that's not the
[1:13:53] intention of some people
[1:13:55] you see and they the anointed ones and
[1:13:57] the lying prophets and preachers will
[1:13:59] show signs and great wonders great
[1:14:01] explanations great opinions
[1:14:04] so as with the intention of misleading
[1:14:06] if possible
[1:14:08] even the chosen ones so the time is now
[1:14:11] now in revelation 7 we have where the
[1:14:14] scriptures talk about
[1:14:16] the hundred and forty four thousand jews
[1:14:19] that sounds like a lot of people but
[1:14:20] it's not
[1:14:22] in israel today there's probably well
[1:14:25] yeah in israel there's about nine
[1:14:26] million jews there's more than that in
[1:14:28] new york they're in atlanta and
[1:14:29] cincinnati and dallas and everywhere so
[1:14:31] 144 000 is just a small portion of the
[1:14:33] whole deal
[1:14:34] it says right there in revelation 7 of
[1:14:36] the tribes of israel we don't have to
[1:14:37] guess who they are
[1:14:38] so there's not going to be one more
[1:14:40] and one less there won't be any empty
[1:14:43] chairs no the perfect package you see
[1:14:46] and
[1:14:47] god is watching over his heritage now in
[1:14:49] the natural
[1:14:51] very few people know what tribe they're
[1:14:53] from
[1:14:54] okay there's some that do many don't but
[1:14:57] god does he's got a computer that
[1:14:58] doesn't crashes
[1:15:00] he's got he's got a laptop it's always
[1:15:02] ready you know
[1:15:03] and um he's in total control of all the
[1:15:06] details of their life and of our life
[1:15:09] see you
[1:15:10] and so there's a great anticipation
[1:15:12] amongst the jews even today
[1:15:14] yes i've been there i know some of these
[1:15:15] people
[1:15:16] and they will the ones that are serious
[1:15:19] they'll tell you oh the messiah is
[1:15:20] almost here but first we'll see elijah
[1:15:23] they've been taught about elijah since
[1:15:24] they were born so they know what kind of
[1:15:27] what to look for they're ahead of us we
[1:15:29] didn't know nothing about elijah
[1:15:31] you can see
[1:15:32] anyway so it's about to happen
[1:15:34] and then when we focus closely
[1:15:36] we
[1:15:37] are a many-membered body
[1:15:40] i mean just right here
[1:15:41] we've got languages we've got colors
[1:15:43] we've got everything you see people
[1:15:45] called out of the confusion of laodicea
[1:15:48] for his name's sake
[1:15:50] not to shine well i'm so and so no for
[1:15:52] his namesake okay
[1:15:54] to show a living christ to a dying
[1:15:58] generation okay
[1:16:00] and then
[1:16:01] but see god in his great wisdom and his
[1:16:03] foreknowledge
[1:16:04] he has predestinated a certain number
[1:16:08] called the bribe okay redeemed by the
[1:16:10] blood of the lamb
[1:16:12] and that's why when you uh you know you
[1:16:15] get all excited you want to testify to a
[1:16:17] neighbor or whoever
[1:16:19] and they reject it they're not part of
[1:16:21] the program
[1:16:23] not everybody's going
[1:16:25] not everybody carrying king james bible
[1:16:27] is going either
[1:16:28] i hate to tell you but there's there's
[1:16:30] three kinds of believers sitting right
[1:16:31] here
[1:16:32] and don't worry about who the other one
[1:16:34] is who are you
[1:16:42] so this bride we don't know how many
[1:16:44] people it is see with the jews we know
[1:16:46] exactly the number the number with the
[1:16:48] bride we don't have a clue
[1:16:50] it's a lot
[1:16:51] uh by comparison
[1:16:54] but we don't know the exact number but
[1:16:55] there won't be any extra chairs i kind
[1:16:58] of squeeze you know 14 people in a bench
[1:17:00] that holds 10 people no there's a seat
[1:17:02] for every one of us
[1:17:04] amen
[1:17:05] so do just do your part to be there so
[1:17:07] the exact number
[1:17:09] only god knows
[1:17:11] many are listening some are you know in
[1:17:13] other words they're having church from
[1:17:15] canada all the way to the south pole
[1:17:17] right now
[1:17:19] in europe africa they're already kind of
[1:17:22] getting ready for the evening service
[1:17:24] in india they've already let out it's
[1:17:25] night time
[1:17:26] so god is in control of all these things
[1:17:28] okay
[1:17:29] so we're living in very dangerous times
[1:17:32] you can read history you can look at
[1:17:34] some movies and so forth
[1:17:36] and thank god that you are living now
[1:17:39] it could be a lot worse
[1:17:41] but god has trusted you with his word to
[1:17:44] live in the darkest part of laodicea and
[1:17:47] overcome the demons of this age
[1:17:50] because when we get to heaven so i don't
[1:17:52] know who you know i'd like to think that
[1:17:54] that in this crowd of 300 people or made
[1:17:57] us here that there's only one
[1:17:59] unbeliever and one make believer i don't
[1:18:01] know
[1:18:02] i want to believe we're all going you
[1:18:03] see
[1:18:05] and when we get there
[1:18:07] if they hand out t-shirts
[1:18:10] we don't know but if they hand out
[1:18:12] t-shirts it's not going to be you know
[1:18:14] survivor
[1:18:16] it's going to be overcomer
[1:18:18] we are overcomers of dark laodicea
[1:18:22] and we are more than overcomers
[1:18:25] see when there's a fight only one winner
[1:18:28] right he gets the big buckle and he gets
[1:18:31] the big check so he's the overcomer but
[1:18:33] when he gives his wife the check she's
[1:18:36] more than overcomer
[1:18:37] and we are the wife
[1:18:39] okay
[1:18:41] so yes very dangerous times
[1:18:44] and um
[1:18:45] god has us living here by his grace in
[1:18:48] this time of church history
[1:18:50] we're not building an ark we're not
[1:18:51] walking across the desert we're looking
[1:18:53] for the exit of laodicea
[1:18:56] and yes there will be overcomers now
[1:18:58] 2700 years ago a jewish prophet named
[1:19:00] isaiah said behold the darkness shall
[1:19:02] cover the earth future tense
[1:19:05] and gross darkness the people but the
[1:19:07] lord shall arise upon thee and his glory
[1:19:10] shall be seen upon thee speaking of dark
[1:19:13] laodicea
[1:19:14] the time is now
[1:19:18] so we are
[1:19:19] now in one of our darkest hours i hate
[1:19:22] to give you the bad news but it's facts
[1:19:24] and it's from matthew 24 24 and other
[1:19:27] scriptures are coming into focus
[1:19:29] you see
[1:19:30] and um it's uh it's a time for that
[1:19:33] fulfillment it's not with the
[1:19:34] pentecostals mormons followers of martin
[1:19:36] luther whatever know they're right here
[1:19:39] amongst us our friends our loved ones
[1:19:43] carrying these same prophetic
[1:19:44] manuscripts carrying the same king james
[1:19:46] bible
[1:19:48] no none of us is going to be swayed by
[1:19:50] some explanation out there no it's going
[1:19:52] to be right amongst us so how dark is it
[1:19:55] well
[1:19:56] and you know you've heard me speak
[1:19:58] before so don't fall asleep it's going
[1:19:59] to get interesting here a little bit
[1:20:01] um
[1:20:03] a long time ago
[1:20:04] 1959.
[1:20:06] um brother bran was preaching in the
[1:20:08] islands of the caribbean
[1:20:10] and he had some americans with him and
[1:20:12] he was there two or three weeks and so
[1:20:14] one day one of the americans had a
[1:20:17] four hour interview with him
[1:20:19] and you know many years later he's
[1:20:20] telling us about it
[1:20:22] and so he asked brother brown why do you
[1:20:24] say so much about 1977
[1:20:27] okay first of all all you math geniuses
[1:20:29] that was 18 years in the future
[1:20:32] okay we agree so brother ramon could
[1:20:34] have said it's none of your business
[1:20:36] but that wasn't the way he operated no
[1:20:39] he said
[1:20:40] well
[1:20:41] when i was looking into the stream of
[1:20:43] time so he's looking at numbers he said
[1:20:46] it got to 1977 it was so dark
[1:20:48] i didn't see how any believer could live
[1:20:50] in such darkness
[1:20:52] that's why
[1:20:54] now we've lived i mean there's people
[1:20:57] here born a long time after 77.
[1:21:00] and so now we're 45 years this side of
[1:21:03] that dark time
[1:21:05] 45 years darker 45 years more corrupt 45
[1:21:09] years more subtle
[1:21:10] it's only used three times in scripture
[1:21:12] always to do with deceit and sinful
[1:21:14] activity
[1:21:16] so we're 45 years closer to the catching
[1:21:18] away of the bride
[1:21:20] the secret catching away we're not going
[1:21:22] to go out in a blaze of glory
[1:21:24] okay
[1:21:25] secret catching away so stay ready
[1:21:28] because you don't know what time i don't
[1:21:30] care what they tell you and oh this date
[1:21:33] forget it
[1:21:34] i've heard those things for 50 years
[1:21:36] yeah this date and that day and those
[1:21:38] guys
[1:21:39] they drift off you know no we're
[1:21:42] watching for the secret coming
[1:21:44] okay
[1:21:45] and after the secret coming of the lord
[1:21:48] after the secret catching away there are
[1:21:50] people there'll be people right here in
[1:21:51] this church having service thinking
[1:21:54] they're serving god and every church all
[1:21:56] these baptist churches they'll all
[1:21:58] continue having church
[1:22:00] but the ministry
[1:22:02] like me and a few of my friends
[1:22:04] that's when we can retire
[1:22:06] okay
[1:22:07] so they're going to say well what
[1:22:08] happened to those crazy people you know
[1:22:10] strange people following that guy they
[1:22:12] said was a prophet
[1:22:14] but never seen again
[1:22:16] so
[1:22:17] as a redeemed and anointed bride of
[1:22:18] christ god has provided us with this
[1:22:21] bible okay this is very very important
[1:22:26] it used to be a crime to carry a bible
[1:22:29] they burned people alive or even
[1:22:31] thinking about translating it
[1:22:32] we have it
[1:22:33] everybody's got one or two you know
[1:22:36] and so it's in our language and we have
[1:22:38] the the privilege that we can read
[1:22:41] between the lines
[1:22:43] but before you get too excited and go
[1:22:45] off on your tangent what you read
[1:22:47] between the lines has to be in perfect
[1:22:49] harmony with what's on the line has to
[1:22:52] be in harmony
[1:22:54] he's provided us with a uh prophetic
[1:22:56] ministry
[1:22:58] yeah
[1:22:59] god sent gift of unquestionable accuracy
[1:23:01] no wondering no guessing i wonder why no
[1:23:04] it worked and it's real but back to the
[1:23:06] bible one more time you know brother
[1:23:09] branham was very careful about his bible
[1:23:12] because this is god in printed form
[1:23:14] and when he would travel that would be
[1:23:16] the last thing in the suitcase so
[1:23:18] there's not a bunch of stuff on top of
[1:23:19] it okay
[1:23:20] and he says you look it up
[1:23:23] he says you don't ever put anything on
[1:23:25] top of your bible
[1:23:27] not even my books he said
[1:23:29] which at the time there weren't too many
[1:23:31] books
[1:23:32] so be careful
[1:23:35] and when i see somebody putting songbook
[1:23:36] on top of their bible we might use this
[1:23:38] as a
[1:23:40] weapon
[1:23:41] i got a big one out in the car
[1:23:43] but we have this ministry god has
[1:23:45] provided
[1:23:46] and it's it's real simple only believe
[1:23:49] you don't have to memorize the whole
[1:23:50] book of matthew or whatever no only
[1:23:52] believe
[1:23:53] real simple the angel of god came from
[1:23:56] the throne of god and he says to william
[1:23:57] branham you get the people to believe
[1:23:59] you
[1:24:01] nothing will stand in the way of your
[1:24:02] prayer
[1:24:04] and he's using a man that can barely
[1:24:06] read when he started out
[1:24:08] his girlfriend would come up here honey
[1:24:10] read this right here
[1:24:12] and then he would preach
[1:24:13] yeah
[1:24:15] is that best that's god's choice
[1:24:18] look at the 12 disciples is that the
[1:24:19] best we could find
[1:24:21] that's god's choice
[1:24:23] so we don't have an opinion in it you
[1:24:25] see
[1:24:26] so never put anything on top of god's
[1:24:27] word okay so yeah it's only believe and
[1:24:30] it's totally scriptural
[1:24:32] um but you know with every move of god
[1:24:35] there's twins
[1:24:37] from the garden of eden till today
[1:24:39] there's a twin shows up with negative
[1:24:42] comments negative attitudes and so
[1:24:45] the best thing you can do with those
[1:24:46] people when you read or hear about them
[1:24:49] leave them alone
[1:24:51] it's just like the people out here on
[1:24:52] 183 when they kind of just have it all
[1:24:55] fine just drop back let them have it
[1:24:58] this is the only millennium they're
[1:24:59] going to have
[1:25:00] it's not going to get no better for them
[1:25:03] we're going to a better place
[1:25:05] so
[1:25:07] these people that are
[1:25:09] constantly throwing rocks our message
[1:25:11] leave them alone
[1:25:13] right
[1:25:14] so he's provided us with all the
[1:25:16] instructions we need to walk right into
[1:25:19] the body change or prepare us for
[1:25:21] resurrection
[1:25:23] and it's very very close
[1:25:25] i don't have any personal insight i'm
[1:25:27] just telling you about what i see it's
[1:25:29] close
[1:25:30] okay
[1:25:31] so there's some sitting here
[1:25:32] that won't see death
[1:25:35] some are going to go by the way the
[1:25:36] grave like the brother this week and
[1:25:38] many others we've heard about recently
[1:25:40] but there's some here that will not see
[1:25:42] death
[1:25:44] but a sweep will come over just like a
[1:25:45] breeze
[1:25:47] and all of a sudden wow
[1:25:49] that black hair again
[1:25:51] wow
[1:25:52] no spots
[1:25:54] it's going to happen people
[1:25:56] it's not walt disney it's real
[1:25:58] you see
[1:26:00] and then what will happen then we'll
[1:26:01] hear a knock on the door
[1:26:04] and there's grandma
[1:26:06] there's rebecca there's the ones that
[1:26:08] are gone
[1:26:09] and then we're changed you see
[1:26:12] so the day of the lord will be
[1:26:14] in full effect
[1:26:16] it's on the way
[1:26:18] that's when the minister of god can
[1:26:19] retire
[1:26:20] the first day of the resurrection
[1:26:23] so the redeemed of the lord are focused
[1:26:26] on that day that's where we're headed
[1:26:28] you know we wish we could just drop
[1:26:29] everything but no you got to occupy
[1:26:31] until he comes and so we're looking
[1:26:32] towards that day the day of our full
[1:26:34] redemption we are focused
[1:26:37] and keeping in step with god's word
[1:26:40] walking in the light that you have
[1:26:42] because each one of us you know
[1:26:43] christians in progress or each one have
[1:26:45] a little bit different light you know
[1:26:47] maybe 10 watt maybe 20 100 watt we walk
[1:26:50] in the light that we have
[1:26:52] and
[1:26:53] we want to maintain a balance as we move
[1:26:56] along now in acts chapter 3
[1:27:00] open your bibles again
[1:27:03] we are mentioned in acts chapter 3.
[1:27:06] where is it at here and verse 21 3 21
[1:27:10] um
[1:27:12] 3 20 and he shall send jesus christ
[1:27:15] which before was preached unto you whom
[1:27:17] the heaven must receive or like it says
[1:27:20] in spanish keep back
[1:27:22] until the times of restitution of all
[1:27:25] things
[1:27:26] which god has spoken by the mouth of all
[1:27:28] his holy prophets since the world began
[1:27:31] so there's
[1:27:33] included in that restoration of all
[1:27:35] things is the bride we're being restored
[1:27:38] not just to the day of pentecost but to
[1:27:40] eden
[1:27:42] and that that's going on now that's why
[1:27:43] you're here today what can we do we're
[1:27:45] looking in the mirror of the word how do
[1:27:47] we get uh ready a little better so rest
[1:27:49] of all restoration of all things
[1:27:51] includes the bride restore her to her
[1:27:53] original condition
[1:27:55] as we were in the mind of god before he
[1:27:58] formed the planets
[1:28:00] now see we we live here
[1:28:03] we have cars we have freeways got all
[1:28:04] this stuff
[1:28:06] but have you if you looked at the
[1:28:08] pictures i mean this ball is sitting in
[1:28:10] the middle of the air
[1:28:12] now there's some really really demented
[1:28:14] people on the planet that think that the
[1:28:16] planet is flat
[1:28:17] that's ridiculous yeah the flat earth
[1:28:20] society
[1:28:21] they had a uh what we call one of their
[1:28:25] conventions three or four years ago and
[1:28:27] they invited a uh astronaut to come
[1:28:30] speak
[1:28:31] now the astronauts been out there he saw
[1:28:32] this round ball
[1:28:34] that should have been interesting
[1:28:36] so we have this ball sitting here in the
[1:28:38] air it goes around just perfectly you
[1:28:40] know east is back here
[1:28:43] west there north star is right out there
[1:28:46] never moves
[1:28:48] and the ball is right there and it moves
[1:28:51] and every day you know
[1:28:53] so
[1:28:54] before all that happened we were in the
[1:28:55] mind of god
[1:28:57] okay
[1:28:58] and that's why we press forward with
[1:29:01] successful missionary work that is
[1:29:03] bearing fruit the word is going into
[1:29:05] places i can never go
[1:29:07] it's going people are are taking the
[1:29:09] memory stick with the message and
[1:29:11] they're playing and people are being
[1:29:12] baptized it's going on right now there's
[1:29:14] a there's an active search for that last
[1:29:16] one you see
[1:29:18] and so god is calling people to
[1:29:20] repentance calling them to baptism we
[1:29:22] just dealt with the case last night how
[1:29:24] do i become baptized
[1:29:25] real simple
[1:29:26] come to church we'll tell you about it
[1:29:29] but
[1:29:30] we read in the love letter
[1:29:32] that that special day
[1:29:34] will be preceded by a falling away from
[1:29:37] the truth
[1:29:38] all this seems to be going fine and
[1:29:40] we're headed to that you know the
[1:29:42] destination but before we get there
[1:29:43] there's going to be a falling away
[1:29:45] things are going to fall apart in some
[1:29:47] cases you see
[1:29:48] and so a falling away from the faith
[1:29:50] apostasy or rebellion
[1:29:53] so any departure any apostasy or
[1:29:55] rebellion must always begin from the
[1:29:57] inside
[1:29:59] you see
[1:30:00] and goes out and takes as many with them
[1:30:02] along the way
[1:30:03] so that kind of activity never begins
[1:30:05] way out there
[1:30:06] no it comes from within it's very subtle
[1:30:10] and engaging and very dangerous and
[1:30:12] don't you dare think that you can do
[1:30:13] battle with them those are the devil's
[1:30:15] enemies those devils you know his
[1:30:18] lieutenants enemies of the truth and
[1:30:20] you're gonna waste your time trying to
[1:30:23] do battle doesn't work
[1:30:26] you're no match for the devil because of
[1:30:28] you you know so much and you've read
[1:30:30] your whole bible and all this fine
[1:30:33] we don't have any business in that
[1:30:35] battle over there leave them alone you
[1:30:37] see
[1:30:38] and you can't argue them with your logic
[1:30:41] so the love letter also tells us over
[1:30:43] here in matthew chapter 12.
[1:30:47] matthew 12 and um 32 see what we got
[1:30:51] here
[1:30:52] if i was one of those real good
[1:30:53] preachers i'd have all this by memory
[1:30:55] said and whosoever speaketh a word
[1:30:57] against the son of man it shall be
[1:30:59] forgiven him
[1:31:01] in other words jesus is saying right
[1:31:03] here in red letters you guys can do
[1:31:04] anything say anything you want against
[1:31:07] me i'll forgive you no problem
[1:31:09] but
[1:31:10] whosoever speaketh against the holy
[1:31:12] ghost it shall not be forgiven him
[1:31:14] neither in this world neither in the
[1:31:17] world to come
[1:31:19] we've got people in pulpits right now in
[1:31:21] america with this same bible
[1:31:25] speaking evil of
[1:31:27] what god has done
[1:31:29] they're just digging their hole deeper
[1:31:30] every day
[1:31:31] so
[1:31:32] so it's extremely dangerous in
[1:31:34] revelations 22 18 you take one word out
[1:31:38] put one word in you're finished
[1:31:41] uh what is hebrews 6
[1:31:43] if you've been here you've partaken and
[1:31:45] you've memorized part of and you've
[1:31:46] preached it whatever
[1:31:48] and then you go away it's a one-way trip
[1:31:51] there's no way back
[1:31:54] so we love the word of god others do not
[1:31:57] it's just that simple
[1:31:58] now jesus had to put up with some of the
[1:32:00] same stuff 2000 years ago
[1:32:02] matthew um
[1:32:04] 22 is where it says they then went the
[1:32:08] pharisees now before you get too excited
[1:32:10] the pharisees were the best religious
[1:32:13] people of the time
[1:32:14] okay
[1:32:16] it's just a warning
[1:32:20] they knew their prophet's words
[1:32:22] they had a a bible ended in malachi that
[1:32:26] was their bible
[1:32:27] it was a 200 year old translation so it
[1:32:30] was more friendly to them at that time
[1:32:33] they had it by memory they didn't have
[1:32:34] ipad and iphone no they read and
[1:32:36] memorized they knew their prophets words
[1:32:41] but they were blinded for our sake thank
[1:32:43] you
[1:32:44] and so when jesus comes along in
[1:32:46] fulfillment of these words they
[1:32:48] memorized
[1:32:49] they just couldn't see it
[1:32:51] so they went and took counsel they got
[1:32:53] together
[1:32:54] how we might entangle him in his words
[1:32:57] you know trap him with a question
[1:32:58] we still have pharisees today
[1:33:01] you see and just like those back there
[1:33:03] today we have people that know the
[1:33:05] letter quite well but zero revelation
[1:33:08] you see
[1:33:09] if the message of god is not real to you
[1:33:12] today
[1:33:13] in your soul
[1:33:15] you will walk away one day
[1:33:19] and we'll hear about it you can't sneak
[1:33:20] away we'll hear about it
[1:33:22] but to turn your back on the truth one
[1:33:25] you must misunderstood and you must
[1:33:28] misunderstand and reject the bible
[1:33:30] promises
[1:33:32] okay
[1:33:33] you gotta misunderstand and get
[1:33:35] scrambled so the people that are walking
[1:33:36] away and yeah wayne brown one day
[1:33:39] they're going to leave the bible also
[1:33:41] they're going to be at zero
[1:33:43] you have to reject the supernatural
[1:33:44] indication
[1:33:46] yeah
[1:33:46] this photo we got over here that's a
[1:33:48] supernatural photograph i've seen the
[1:33:50] original in washington and i've talked
[1:33:52] to the man that took the picture over
[1:33:54] here in houston he's gone now
[1:33:56] so
[1:33:57] it's real
[1:33:59] but people speak against it so they're
[1:34:01] on a slippery slope and according to
[1:34:03] hebrew 6 that person is left with zero
[1:34:06] chances of returning
[1:34:07] because see god is the judge not me not
[1:34:10] you
[1:34:11] we are only fruit inspectors you see
[1:34:14] we have an inspector badge
[1:34:16] issued by the holy ghost
[1:34:19] you know when you go to the market
[1:34:20] you're going to buy peaches
[1:34:22] well now there's some you don't don't
[1:34:23] don't even want to touch them because
[1:34:24] they're already soft so you're
[1:34:26] inspecting the fruit okay this one will
[1:34:28] be good or avocados
[1:34:30] after all you know 300 other people
[1:34:32] squeeze them
[1:34:35] we're just fruit inspectors
[1:34:37] and we don't have to touch it we have to
[1:34:38] say word just back away
[1:34:42] so god is in charge he's the judge now
[1:34:44] in john chapter 8 we have a scene
[1:34:48] that
[1:34:49] jesus went
[1:34:50] to the temple ground now when the when
[1:34:52] the scripture says he went to the temple
[1:34:54] the temple is small about maybe half the
[1:34:57] size of this but the people all gathered
[1:34:59] out there in the yard that's where the
[1:35:00] people were so he's over there in the
[1:35:02] corner of the courtyard with you know a
[1:35:04] group of people
[1:35:05] and it's early church he's sitting there
[1:35:07] teaching a crowd of believers
[1:35:10] and all of a sudden who shows up but the
[1:35:12] twin twin always shows up
[1:35:15] never misses opportunity so here's a
[1:35:17] group of very arrogant pharisees
[1:35:21] all men
[1:35:22] and they got a woman by the arm i mean
[1:35:24] they got a death grip on her arm
[1:35:26] and they drug her out of bed so she's
[1:35:28] not dressed right her hair is not combed
[1:35:30] or nothing
[1:35:31] and um
[1:35:32] and they interrupt him
[1:35:35] wow we got him now he's over there with
[1:35:36] those people and we'll drag this
[1:35:38] prostitute over here so they put her
[1:35:40] right in the middle you know right where
[1:35:42] everybody could see
[1:35:44] and they posed a loaded question
[1:35:46] and they probably each one had a few
[1:35:48] rocks in their pocket ready to perform
[1:35:50] what the prophet said to do kill his
[1:35:52] sorry outfit with a rock you know
[1:35:54] yeah they were ready and uh ready to
[1:35:57] judge
[1:35:57] and so um because their the pharisees
[1:36:00] job was to make jesus look bad
[1:36:02] okay
[1:36:03] and uh let's see where we at john
[1:36:05] chapter 8
[1:36:07] and let's see here
[1:36:09] in verse 4
[1:36:11] and they said unto master
[1:36:13] this woman was taken in adultery
[1:36:15] we drug her out of the bed
[1:36:17] i mean so it says
[1:36:20] now our prophet moses
[1:36:22] in the law commanded us that such should
[1:36:25] be stoned
[1:36:26] what do you say
[1:36:28] are you are you willing to contradict
[1:36:30] our prophet moses
[1:36:32] but see they were only half right moses
[1:36:34] said bring both of them
[1:36:37] so this could have been a setup
[1:36:39] they didn't bring the guy
[1:36:41] you know
[1:36:42] and
[1:36:43] so they're trying to make him look bad
[1:36:45] he acts like he doesn't hear him he goes
[1:36:47] over there and starts scribbling
[1:36:49] writing in the sand we don't know what
[1:36:50] he wrote it's not important you know and
[1:36:53] so they're going to continue with her
[1:36:54] with her accusation
[1:36:56] and um
[1:36:58] and uh
[1:36:59] they thought he was down there looking
[1:37:00] for a rock yeah
[1:37:02] and um to help him fulfill the law you
[1:37:05] know words literal words of their
[1:37:07] prophet
[1:37:08] and so when they finish their accusation
[1:37:10] he he raises up he heard everything
[1:37:13] and he looked around and tell you what
[1:37:14] boys the one of you that has never stole
[1:37:17] a pita bread
[1:37:18] you never looked at a woman with any
[1:37:20] kind of bad thoughts of any kind
[1:37:23] the one that's
[1:37:24] free from sin
[1:37:26] throw the first rock
[1:37:29] of course nobody qualified
[1:37:31] so the scripture says they start
[1:37:32] tiptoeing out
[1:37:33] we didn't think about that let's get out
[1:37:35] of here
[1:37:36] you know
[1:37:38] and so jesus had these things you know
[1:37:40] and he goes down and continues writing
[1:37:42] but then he erased it all
[1:37:44] now we've got to put that in because
[1:37:46] we've got people so narrow-minded
[1:37:49] they think that the showbread is still
[1:37:51] over there someplace we can go see it
[1:37:53] they think we can go there and see where
[1:37:54] jesus wrote in the sand
[1:37:56] how many 2 000 years have passed
[1:37:58] things change you know
[1:38:00] they've had 25 wars
[1:38:04] so
[1:38:05] they they started to just
[1:38:08] get away
[1:38:09] by discernment he was able to see her
[1:38:11] entire life
[1:38:12] okay
[1:38:13] just a flash
[1:38:15] and
[1:38:16] he could see that she had representation
[1:38:18] in heaven
[1:38:19] now yes she had been on a detour
[1:38:22] we don't know how long or why but she
[1:38:25] had representation in heaven
[1:38:27] he said neither do i condemn thee go and
[1:38:29] sin no more once again a woman received
[1:38:32] life from the life giver okay
[1:38:35] it turned her into a real lady her heart
[1:38:37] filled with joy she went away with hope
[1:38:39] to live a new life
[1:38:42] that was where she had her encounter
[1:38:43] with the master
[1:38:45] her chains fell off
[1:38:47] she was free
[1:38:49] romans chapter 8 says here
[1:38:55] hold on
[1:38:57] romans 8 one of my favorite chapters no
[1:38:59] i didn't memorize it therefore is
[1:39:02] is therefore there is therefore now no
[1:39:05] condemnation
[1:39:07] to them which are in christ jesus who
[1:39:09] have believed all the word who walk not
[1:39:11] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:39:13] so she had this representation you see
[1:39:16] so that's a nice story now what about
[1:39:19] you have you had your personal encounter
[1:39:22] or is it just your mother's story and
[1:39:24] grandma's experience you know it's got
[1:39:26] to be real
[1:39:28] you see god can
[1:39:31] he sees all your circumstances he knows
[1:39:34] all your story
[1:39:36] and he can change your life you see for
[1:39:38] his glory but it's got to be real in
[1:39:40] your life
[1:39:42] in your
[1:39:43] in your own self not in grandma and not
[1:39:45] your mother and so forth but we still
[1:39:47] have pharisees today
[1:39:48] we call them legalists you see
[1:39:51] so those people in jesus day had their
[1:39:54] prophet's message memorized perfectly
[1:39:57] but
[1:39:59] they were out of balance
[1:40:00] really out of balance
[1:40:02] now we're not going to put it all the
[1:40:03] way this way because see this way
[1:40:05] is the long part of the cross that's
[1:40:08] your prayer life
[1:40:09] you want to get close to god you pray
[1:40:11] you read your bible
[1:40:14] come to church okay
[1:40:16] but if you maintain your prayer life god
[1:40:18] will take care of the horizontal
[1:40:21] okay moving that along
[1:40:23] so they had all word no spirit no
[1:40:25] revelation
[1:40:26] and they had memorized it by constant
[1:40:28] repetition
[1:40:30] it became a form you know and they still
[1:40:33] do it today
[1:40:35] because from way back there
[1:40:37] way back
[1:40:38] every sabbath that's yesterday
[1:40:41] every synagogue on the planet reads a
[1:40:43] part of moses they have their spoken
[1:40:45] word book yeah they read the eye we're
[1:40:47] all together that's called organized
[1:40:49] religion not interested
[1:40:51] okay
[1:40:52] so we must worship god in spirit and in
[1:40:54] truth
[1:40:56] see that's what he told the woman at the
[1:40:57] well we god is looking for those who are
[1:40:59] worshipping in spirit and in truth
[1:41:01] perfectly balanced
[1:41:03] you see
[1:41:04] so your life will reflect what's on the
[1:41:07] inside of you
[1:41:09] you can't
[1:41:10] you can't deceive a four-year-old they
[1:41:12] can see right through you
[1:41:14] you know
[1:41:15] and so
[1:41:16] your life will reflect what's on the
[1:41:18] inside
[1:41:19] no matter how much word you memorize and
[1:41:21] try to act like a christian because
[1:41:23] anybody up and down this avenue can read
[1:41:26] and repeat that's not what it's about
[1:41:28] it's about it coming alive
[1:41:31] okay turn over to first timothy chapter
[1:41:34] four
[1:41:36] i might not get invited back for a while
[1:41:38] so we've got to get it all out today
[1:41:41] where's that here first timothy chapter
[1:41:43] four
[1:41:45] and verse 1
[1:41:48] now the spirit speaks expressly that
[1:41:50] means precisely that in the latter times
[1:41:53] that's today now is the time
[1:41:56] that some
[1:41:57] shall depart from the faith they were in
[1:42:00] the faith we thought they were
[1:42:02] tight
[1:42:03] they left
[1:42:04] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[1:42:05] doctrines of devils speaking lies in
[1:42:08] hypocrisy having their conscience seared
[1:42:10] with a hot iron
[1:42:12] sounds pretty bad doesn't it
[1:42:16] the lambza bible says misleading spirits
[1:42:18] and doctrines of devils
[1:42:20] where scofield says seducing spirits
[1:42:22] well yeah misleading spirits you know
[1:42:24] doctrines of devils so it's very serious
[1:42:27] you better know where you stand
[1:42:29] and having done all
[1:42:31] stand
[1:42:33] do not engage in conversation with
[1:42:35] doubters those that don't believe what
[1:42:37] we believe leave them alone
[1:42:39] you're not going to change them
[1:42:41] now your life
[1:42:43] is what you got to watch
[1:42:45] you see
[1:42:48] a lot of people you know a lot a lot of
[1:42:49] women they don't know why they have long
[1:42:51] hair
[1:42:52] or why they wear long dresses
[1:42:54] but it's word of god you know
[1:42:56] so you act like a christian you be a
[1:42:58] christian if there's something in them
[1:43:00] to wonder they'll ask and you kind of
[1:43:02] have an answer
[1:43:04] so yeah we are in very uh very
[1:43:08] difficult times
[1:43:09] no conversation with doubters negative
[1:43:11] people see that was the fatal mistake
[1:43:13] that mother eve made
[1:43:15] and
[1:43:16] she listened
[1:43:18] and then she responded really
[1:43:21] are you
[1:43:22] serious she got involved tried to argue
[1:43:26] and we're still paying the price today
[1:43:28] spirits don't die
[1:43:31] okay
[1:43:32] back in your bible second peter chapter
[1:43:34] one
[1:43:36] one thing i want to tell you about peter
[1:43:37] peter was ignorant and unlearned
[1:43:40] he couldn't read he couldn't write
[1:43:42] well how did all this happen because he
[1:43:44] had some people helping him
[1:43:46] he had some
[1:43:47] good people helping him yeah that's the
[1:43:49] way i want to say yeah and so they
[1:43:50] eventually come up with these two
[1:43:51] letters
[1:43:52] okay where are we at first peter ii
[1:43:54] peter
[1:43:54] chapter
[1:43:56] 1
[1:43:58] let's see
[1:43:59] chapter 1 and verse 15.
[1:44:02] moreover i will endeavor that she may be
[1:44:04] able after mighty cease
[1:44:07] to have these things always in
[1:44:08] remembrance
[1:44:10] in other words he prepared all this
[1:44:11] because he knew he was going to die and
[1:44:13] i want you to you know have what i have
[1:44:15] why
[1:44:17] for we have not followed cunningly
[1:44:19] devised fables now see that's not just
[1:44:21] something
[1:44:22] another opinion no cunningly devised
[1:44:25] fables something to
[1:44:27] mislead by by design
[1:44:30] you see
[1:44:31] when we made a note unto you the power
[1:44:33] and the coming of our lord jesus
[1:44:35] christ but we are eyewitnesses of his
[1:44:38] majesty he knew what he was talking
[1:44:40] about
[1:44:40] he was ignorant and unlearned but he got
[1:44:42] with some brothers and one of them was
[1:44:43] an age named sylvanius i think and they
[1:44:46] they got his thoughts on the paper and
[1:44:49] we have it here
[1:44:50] and that's why it's very important many
[1:44:52] some of you might not like it but we
[1:44:54] have a church age book
[1:44:56] yeah that's
[1:44:57] the message in a nutshell there's what
[1:44:59] he wanted to say brother ram never
[1:45:01] allowed any of his message to go out
[1:45:03] verbatim you know word for word he
[1:45:05] wanted it sanded he wanted it
[1:45:07] presentable
[1:45:08] so
[1:45:10] these things may sound
[1:45:12] fantastic
[1:45:14] maybe impossible to comprehend
[1:45:16] but it's all truth it's food for the
[1:45:18] soul
[1:45:19] and so there in in second peter or first
[1:45:22] peter where we're at we'll go back just
[1:45:24] a minute second peter
[1:45:25] we were in um
[1:45:31] chapter
[1:45:32] 1
[1:45:33] and verse 16. so look at 17 and 18. for
[1:45:37] he received from god the father honor
[1:45:40] and glory when there came such a voice
[1:45:42] from him excellent glory this is my
[1:45:44] beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[1:45:46] and this voice which came from heaven we
[1:45:49] heard
[1:45:50] when we were with him in the holy mount
[1:45:53] yeah he was he was a witness
[1:45:55] see i'm not an entertainer but i am a
[1:45:58] witness of a powerful message it is real
[1:46:01] okay
[1:46:02] uh jesus said over in john 6 53 verily
[1:46:05] verily i say unto you and he's talking
[1:46:07] to his disciples he's given him the the
[1:46:10] real important part here chapter six if
[1:46:13] you do not eat the flesh of the son of
[1:46:14] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:46:17] in you well their first impression oh my
[1:46:19] god
[1:46:20] no not eat his flesh
[1:46:22] no
[1:46:23] whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh
[1:46:24] my blood have eternal life and i will
[1:46:26] raise him up at the last day now the
[1:46:28] disciples at that moment were kind of
[1:46:30] concerned
[1:46:31] they're a little bit confused but they
[1:46:33] stood steady
[1:46:35] they knew this man came from god they
[1:46:37] knew this was a supernatural ministry
[1:46:39] they didn't get in his face with stupid
[1:46:41] questions like we have today
[1:46:43] no they paid attention did they
[1:46:45] understand no they didn't understand
[1:46:48] but they were ordained to eternal life
[1:46:51] chosen by the lamb of god
[1:46:52] they stood steady believing that he knew
[1:46:55] what he was talking about
[1:46:57] and they believed the supernatural
[1:47:00] they had seen the unquestionable
[1:47:02] vindication
[1:47:04] now brother branham was sent to us with
[1:47:05] a very simple verse
[1:47:08] what was it
[1:47:10] something everybody could understand
[1:47:12] now in one of my bibles
[1:47:14] over here in hebrews 11
[1:47:17] hebrews 13
[1:47:20] there's a semicolon after
[1:47:22] verse
[1:47:24] 7.
[1:47:25] verse 7 of hebrews 13. remember them
[1:47:27] which have the rule over you so there's
[1:47:29] order who have spoken unto you the word
[1:47:32] of god whose faith follow considering
[1:47:34] the end of their conversation which
[1:47:36] would be jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:47:38] today and forever in other words they're
[1:47:40] living what they speak
[1:47:41] this verse doesn't just stand out
[1:47:43] there's a rubber stamp for everything it
[1:47:45] has to do with the whole chapter and
[1:47:47] that's to do with the way we act
[1:47:50] the way we carry on our conversation
[1:47:53] so he was totally vindicated
[1:47:56] no question or doubt only believe
[1:47:59] it works
[1:48:01] yeah just just try it
[1:48:03] you know
[1:48:04] i remember one day he he uh he told me
[1:48:07] he said now george
[1:48:08] tithing does work
[1:48:10] i have tried it
[1:48:12] and you know that it works
[1:48:13] so there's these things in the bible
[1:48:15] that are real you just got to put them
[1:48:16] to practice so the day of redemption
[1:48:20] is very near now there's two things we
[1:48:22] want to point out here also about uh
[1:48:25] jesus and his day you know the first
[1:48:28] miracle was the wedding at cana remember
[1:48:31] he got a he and the disciples he had an
[1:48:34] invitation go to this wedding it's a
[1:48:36] little village of galilee and so they go
[1:48:38] over there and there's this mother and
[1:48:40] you know
[1:48:41] crowd of believers
[1:48:43] and so
[1:48:44] they ran out of wine
[1:48:46] remember the story
[1:48:48] now
[1:48:49] look at the details in your bible
[1:48:52] read your bible
[1:48:54] the wedding was on the third day
[1:48:57] okay sunday is the first day
[1:48:59] monday is the second day tuesday's the
[1:49:01] third day
[1:49:03] why do they have weddings on the third
[1:49:05] day
[1:49:06] because in the book of genesis
[1:49:09] in the creation
[1:49:11] on the first day god said it's good
[1:49:15] second day that's good
[1:49:17] but on the third day he said good twice
[1:49:19] so the jews take tuesday for our
[1:49:21] favorite day to get married anyway
[1:49:24] so he's there
[1:49:25] they ran out of wine
[1:49:27] and they go here you may want to do
[1:49:29] whatever he says
[1:49:31] and so i had these big water pots you
[1:49:32] know they're huge maybe
[1:49:34] bigger than those drums
[1:49:36] and he said well first thing we're going
[1:49:38] to do is fill these six pots here with
[1:49:40] water okay whatever you say now taste it
[1:49:43] now this wasn't hours later it was
[1:49:45] immediate
[1:49:46] wow that's good stuff should have had
[1:49:48] this the beginning
[1:49:49] and
[1:49:51] so he created
[1:49:52] wine from water
[1:49:56] now
[1:49:58] in jeffersonville many years ago
[1:50:00] one of the believers at the tabernacle
[1:50:02] lived next door to a man named mr hill
[1:50:06] mr hill belonged to the church of christ
[1:50:09] called
[1:50:10] and so
[1:50:12] the brother whatever his name was he was
[1:50:14] always hey come on church with me you
[1:50:15] know well finally mr hill says fine i'll
[1:50:17] go church with you tonight well it just
[1:50:19] happened to be communion night
[1:50:21] so
[1:50:22] there's open communion and there's
[1:50:24] closed communion closed communion is
[1:50:25] just us we shut the door it's just us
[1:50:27] but open communion if you say you're a
[1:50:29] believer sure
[1:50:31] if you if you lied what's going to be on
[1:50:33] you it's not on me
[1:50:34] and so they have open communion and so
[1:50:36] they um uh they stand at the rail and
[1:50:40] they come by with the bread
[1:50:42] and the next guy comes by with the wine
[1:50:44] okay so they're a little over half done
[1:50:46] with the congregation
[1:50:48] and brother neville says to brother
[1:50:49] branham
[1:50:50] uh brother branham we're out of wine
[1:50:53] well it's kind of embarrassing
[1:50:55] so mr hill he's right there where he
[1:50:57] could see it you know hear it
[1:51:00] so brother bran says well i'll tell you
[1:51:01] what we'll just pray
[1:51:04] it's a great idea so
[1:51:06] you know the bible says watch and pray
[1:51:08] so mr hill he
[1:51:11] got one eye open
[1:51:15] and he's
[1:51:16] he said i saw those little glasses
[1:51:18] filled with wine as he prayed
[1:51:20] from nothing
[1:51:24] so he couldn't go back to church christ
[1:51:26] he became a believer
[1:51:30] so the redemption the day of redemption
[1:51:32] is very near okay how far it's close
[1:51:35] just take my word for it
[1:51:37] when when we the believers the redeemed
[1:51:40] find that last eagle that's how we got
[1:51:42] this missionary here from uh africa
[1:51:46] good friend of mine from many years ago
[1:51:48] we were both young and good looking way
[1:51:49] back
[1:51:51] brother jim
[1:51:52] and
[1:51:53] there's there's work going on that you
[1:51:55] don't hear about but it's going on
[1:51:58] searching searching
[1:52:00] and when we find god's last eagle you
[1:52:03] see
[1:52:04] so god's program is right on schedule
[1:52:07] and by the way his schedule doesn't
[1:52:09] really include handing out tracks at the
[1:52:11] mall and to stop light no that's not it
[1:52:14] no passing out literature is not
[1:52:16] preaching the gospel it's a kind of a
[1:52:18] hobby maybe but you want to get serious
[1:52:20] about what he said
[1:52:22] new ministry 1959 god knew that we'd be
[1:52:25] sitting here 10 million years before the
[1:52:27] world was ever founded when there was
[1:52:30] nothing no planets we were already the
[1:52:32] mind of god and he knew you'd be sitting
[1:52:34] here
[1:52:35] and so he says the infinite sea of god
[1:52:38] knew every fly every gnat
[1:52:41] so we could add the cockroaches and the
[1:52:44] mosquitoes all these things
[1:52:46] and every time each one would bat their
[1:52:48] eye and how much title that would
[1:52:49] produce before the world was ever formed
[1:52:52] that's the infinite god we serve
[1:52:55] and so he says here well if he knows all
[1:52:58] that why are you preaching
[1:53:00] because see you you can get out of
[1:53:01] balance with with uh predestination
[1:53:04] oh we'll just we'll just sit down why do
[1:53:06] we go through all this
[1:53:07] stuff just sit down let it happen no
[1:53:09] that's not the way it works
[1:53:13] if god knows all that why are you
[1:53:15] preaching it's part of god's program
[1:53:17] preaching is his program
[1:53:19] want to say what he said you're on
[1:53:22] when he looked at the disciples or the
[1:53:24] apostles see there's a difference
[1:53:26] apostles
[1:53:28] is one thing disciples are followers so
[1:53:30] these were these were disciples
[1:53:31] following the lord but then they became
[1:53:34] apostles sent out missionaries
[1:53:38] he looked at the harvest he said you
[1:53:39] know the harvest is ripe the labors are
[1:53:41] few you all need to pray to the heart
[1:53:43] lord of the harvest that he will send
[1:53:45] laborers into his harvest
[1:53:47] well why would they have to pray to the
[1:53:49] lord of the harvest to send laborers
[1:53:51] into the harvest if the lord of the
[1:53:52] harvest was standing there knowing how
[1:53:54] it would be done
[1:53:56] great question
[1:53:58] he says listen god has so arranged it
[1:54:00] that his program cannot move
[1:54:03] without you and i
[1:54:06] this church out here isn't going to
[1:54:07] raise automatically
[1:54:09] it's got to be a group effort
[1:54:11] so
[1:54:12] he's so arranged that his program cannot
[1:54:14] move without you and i as long as we're
[1:54:16] not doing what god leads us to do we're
[1:54:18] paralyzing his program
[1:54:20] but when the church moves under the
[1:54:22] anointing of the holy ghost then we're
[1:54:24] in god's will doing his program
[1:54:26] so preaching is his program
[1:54:29] no more argument
[1:54:31] whose program god's program the god of
[1:54:34] heaven and earth not my program not
[1:54:36] david's program god's program
[1:54:38] so we would do very well to put our
[1:54:41] little program aside
[1:54:43] you see
[1:54:44] and get in line and in step with his
[1:54:46] divine program
[1:54:48] because god sent his fourth elijah to
[1:54:51] this generation
[1:54:53] according to the divine plan
[1:54:55] to turn the hearts back to the original
[1:54:59] this glorious message that we have is
[1:55:01] the vehicle that takes us back
[1:55:03] okay
[1:55:05] the first church age messenger said over
[1:55:07] here in
[1:55:08] first corinthians 3 for we are laborers
[1:55:11] together with god
[1:55:13] ye are god's husbandry ye are god's
[1:55:16] building according to the grace of god
[1:55:17] which is given unto me as the wise
[1:55:19] master builder i have laid the
[1:55:21] foundation see he knew who he was
[1:55:23] i've laid the foundation and another one
[1:55:25] builds their own but let every man take
[1:55:27] heed how he builds thereon
[1:55:30] for other foundation can no man lay
[1:55:32] than that which is already laid which is
[1:55:34] jesus christ
[1:55:36] and that's why the fifth messenger
[1:55:37] martin luther came along in the midst of
[1:55:39] a lot of stuff
[1:55:42] he said christ alone
[1:55:46] very important so who are these laborers
[1:55:48] together in the first sentence
[1:55:50] look real close in your bible 41 pages
[1:55:52] later in ephesians chapter 4
[1:55:56] you got permission to open your bible
[1:56:00] where's it at here ephesians 4
[1:56:02] poor
[1:56:03] paul being a very intelligent person
[1:56:06] he wrote one sentence
[1:56:08] okay
[1:56:10] starting in verse 11 it's one sentence
[1:56:13] and he gave some apostles
[1:56:16] some
[1:56:19] apostles some prophets some evangelists
[1:56:22] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[1:56:24] of the saints for the work of the
[1:56:26] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:56:28] christ till we all come
[1:56:29] in the unity of the faith and the
[1:56:31] knowledge of the son of god under the
[1:56:33] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:56:35] stature of the fullness of christ that
[1:56:37] we the henceforth be no more children
[1:56:40] acting like children
[1:56:41] tossed to and fro
[1:56:44] and carried about with every wind of
[1:56:46] doctrine that comes by by the slight of
[1:56:48] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[1:56:50] lie and wait to deceive but speaking the
[1:56:54] truth in love may grow up into him in
[1:56:57] all things
[1:56:59] which is the head even christ from whom
[1:57:02] the whole body
[1:57:04] fitly joined together perfectly and
[1:57:06] compacted by that which every joint
[1:57:08] supplieth according to the effectual
[1:57:10] working in the measure of every part
[1:57:13] maketh increase of the body unto the
[1:57:16] edifying of itself in love
[1:57:18] second time in case you missed it the
[1:57:20] first time so that's one sentence
[1:57:23] he was a smart man
[1:57:24] but it's the gospel all right there you
[1:57:26] see so why do we have these ministries
[1:57:29] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:57:31] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:57:32] the body of christ and they all work
[1:57:35] balanced and in harmony
[1:57:37] we don't have profit over here and
[1:57:38] evan's just over here and pastor no they
[1:57:41] work
[1:57:43] in
[1:57:44] harmony
[1:57:45] okay
[1:57:47] brother rem says over here in
[1:57:48] perseverance
[1:57:49] 1962
[1:57:51] i believe that there's a church coming
[1:57:52] into that perfection
[1:57:54] now friends this was 60 years ago
[1:57:57] preaching to people that didn't consider
[1:58:00] there was no such thing as a bunch of
[1:58:01] believers there was pentecostal people
[1:58:03] he was preaching to some baptists in
[1:58:05] what water i believe there's a church
[1:58:07] coming into that perfection that
[1:58:09] ministry of perfection where the offices
[1:58:11] were apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:58:13] evangelists for the perfecting of the
[1:58:15] church those pastors and teachers and so
[1:58:18] forth will be so in tune in balance
[1:58:22] with the word until the whole thing will
[1:58:24] work right up to the coming of the lord
[1:58:27] i believe that and i believe that we're
[1:58:29] nearing that time i believe it is so
[1:58:32] now is the time
[1:58:34] are you listening
[1:58:38] they all work in harmony and balance
[1:58:41] just like these musicians now you got
[1:58:43] you got three violins get the organ you
[1:58:46] got the piano you got the guy beating on
[1:58:48] the thing over here okay so they got to
[1:58:50] work together
[1:58:52] there's no very important oh it's all
[1:58:54] about me no you don't see that up here
[1:58:56] and the ministry works the same way you
[1:58:58] see
[1:58:59] uh under one anointing anointing of the
[1:59:02] word the spirit of god all others out
[1:59:04] there
[1:59:05] whoever that's out there
[1:59:07] that are out of balance with the word
[1:59:09] attracting people to themselves yeah in
[1:59:11] 2022 this wasn't 1950 but now
[1:59:15] they don't qualify under this this uh
[1:59:18] verse here because they're not they're
[1:59:19] not part of the team
[1:59:21] you see god is not responsible for their
[1:59:23] foolishness their tantrums and their
[1:59:25] explanations
[1:59:27] but individuals must appear on the scene
[1:59:31] to produce fulfillment
[1:59:33] each part of god's eternal word spoken
[1:59:36] by prophets
[1:59:38] yeah but the bible is ancient and we've
[1:59:40] got a man over in rome wants to write a
[1:59:41] new bible
[1:59:42] really ma that man is supposed to be
[1:59:45] wearing the sandals of the fishermen
[1:59:48] those of you that's catholics you know
[1:59:49] i'm talking about he's supposed to be
[1:59:51] walking in in in peter's footsteps and
[1:59:54] he can't even repeat the word right
[1:59:57] who's going to trust him with the new
[1:59:58] bible doesn't work we don't need a new
[2:00:01] bible
[2:00:02] no
[2:00:02] uh we may be smarter we may be better
[2:00:05] informed today we got better stuff
[2:00:07] greater buildings but way out of balance
[2:00:09] with god's program we've got to get back
[2:00:12] in balance
[2:00:13] in 1964 the prophet said if this all
[2:00:15] continues the way it is going right now
[2:00:18] in 50 years it'll be total insanity
[2:00:21] that circle was closed in 2014. so what
[2:00:24] you live in out there and work total
[2:00:26] insanity
[2:00:27] if you don't believe it
[2:00:29] try driving out there
[2:00:31] so
[2:00:32] that is why we see such horrible things
[2:00:34] happening in our world total insane
[2:00:36] people
[2:00:37] everywhere you see and
[2:00:41] he also says that it'll become
[2:00:42] spiritually insane
[2:00:44] because we live in pleasure mad laodicea
[2:00:50] you know
[2:00:50] and
[2:00:51] we want the thermostat just right we
[2:00:54] want the car just right everything got
[2:00:55] to be just right you know
[2:00:58] it's crazy
[2:01:00] and so we need to get away from our
[2:01:01] sense-bound existence you know search
[2:01:04] that phrase too sense-bound existence
[2:01:06] so recently in it about five years ago i
[2:01:09] think it was
[2:01:11] in a period of three years
[2:01:13] 138 students were shot dead
[2:01:15] in a three year period
[2:01:17] sounds bad
[2:01:18] too much tv too much make-believe
[2:01:21] but guess what during that same
[2:01:23] three-year period
[2:01:25] over six million babies were murdered by
[2:01:27] abortion
[2:01:29] yeah in the united states not talking
[2:01:31] about the world
[2:01:32] okay
[2:01:33] yeah right here so we have no business
[2:01:36] telling anybody on the planet
[2:01:38] how to run their country or advising on
[2:01:41] human rights
[2:01:42] we are some of the worst
[2:01:45] so our messenger was brave and he
[2:01:46] entertained questions from the audience
[2:01:49] and the questions and answers on the
[2:01:51] seals on a sunday morning says would the
[2:01:53] bride of christ have a ministry before
[2:01:55] the rapture good question sure that's
[2:01:57] what's going on right now the bride of
[2:01:59] christ certainly
[2:02:01] it is the message of the hour the bride
[2:02:04] of christ
[2:02:06] she consists of a bunch of ugly people
[2:02:09] no
[2:02:10] she consists of apostles prophets
[2:02:12] teachers evangelist pastors
[2:02:15] he identified it
[2:02:16] it's the bride of christ sure she's got
[2:02:18] a ministry great ministry it's the
[2:02:20] ministry of the hour it'll be so humble
[2:02:23] so a lot of people miss it and put it
[2:02:25] somewhere else
[2:02:26] now there's only two forces we're almost
[2:02:28] finished here we've got
[2:02:30] see there's no clock up here so too bad
[2:02:34] it'll all be there when you get there
[2:02:37] if you go to sleep
[2:02:38] we'll start over
[2:02:40] there's only two forces directing all
[2:02:42] the activities on the planet right now
[2:02:46] every one of you is listening or
[2:02:47] following a spirit
[2:02:50] in every activity every waking moment
[2:02:53] either following god or following satan
[2:02:56] it's just that plane a or b
[2:02:59] so we're free human beings we're free in
[2:03:02] this country to make choices
[2:03:04] and it's every moment of every day it's
[2:03:06] very serious but balance is not an
[2:03:08] option
[2:03:10] you must stay balanced because you start
[2:03:12] going just a little bit and
[2:03:16] it doesn't work you'll stay balanced
[2:03:19] brother brahm says you follow the
[2:03:20] scriptures
[2:03:21] see if the spirit follows the scripture
[2:03:23] any spirit that does not follow the
[2:03:25] scripture is a wrong spirit
[2:03:29] now he doesn't say to compare with
[2:03:30] personalities or whatever no scripture
[2:03:32] that's right if it goes beyond this
[2:03:34] bible it's wrong spirit if it doesn't
[2:03:36] get to it it's a wrong spirit
[2:03:38] you see
[2:03:39] so if the devil can't keep you from
[2:03:42] seeing a truth
[2:03:43] he'll push you overboard see that's his
[2:03:46] business he will go off uh that person
[2:03:48] will go off into something fantastic or
[2:03:50] he'll keep you from seeing it at all but
[2:03:52] to stay right straight on calvary it'll
[2:03:55] always come back straight back to the
[2:03:56] word
[2:03:57] stay balanced
[2:03:59] so the scripture says over in james 2
[2:04:01] that demons believe and tremble
[2:04:03] just because you got ready and came to
[2:04:05] church and didn't go to the beach or
[2:04:06] wherever you know
[2:04:08] that's that's great but the devils they
[2:04:10] believe in tremble unfortunately we have
[2:04:13] people today carrying this same book
[2:04:15] same bible and so forth claim to believe
[2:04:19] they believe something
[2:04:21] but they're so calloused by sin and
[2:04:23] unbelief here in laodicea they don't
[2:04:26] know what the bible says or the booklets
[2:04:28] they carry and they don't cry and they
[2:04:30] don't tremble
[2:04:33] god has a provided way brother bran says
[2:04:36] friends i've always tried to keep a
[2:04:37] balance of the road
[2:04:39] you get way off on formalism just as
[2:04:41] formal and ritualistic as they can be
[2:04:44] people grab for that a lot then if you
[2:04:46] don't watch you'll get plumb over on the
[2:04:47] other side be just as fanatic as you can
[2:04:50] be but there's a middle of the road
[2:04:52] where the true sound sane gospel is
[2:04:55] preached and god moves there vindicating
[2:04:58] the truth straight as the gate narrows
[2:05:00] the way few that be to find it
[2:05:02] so consider this redeemed individuals
[2:05:06] are waiting on the coming of the lord
[2:05:08] that would be us and people around the
[2:05:10] world
[2:05:11] we're saved by grace
[2:05:13] believing and depending on the atonement
[2:05:15] of calvary
[2:05:17] only god has the list
[2:05:19] now remember we're only fruit inspectors
[2:05:20] we're not judges
[2:05:23] the bride members are paying attention
[2:05:25] to the ministry that god has placed in
[2:05:27] the body
[2:05:28] so neither you nor anybody else can take
[2:05:31] out what god has installed you see jesus
[2:05:35] said in matthew 20
[2:05:36] 12 32
[2:05:38] one word against it you're finished
[2:05:41] be careful
[2:05:42] and number three the elect of god are
[2:05:44] it's a direct quote we are waiting in
[2:05:46] love for the promise of the age to be
[2:05:49] confirmed
[2:05:50] if you were here 30 days ago when i was
[2:05:52] here we we spoke about that
[2:05:54] waiting in love not with a stick and not
[2:05:56] with you know no waiting in love for the
[2:05:58] promise of the age to be confirmed she's
[2:06:00] watching for it she is part of that word
[2:06:03] and she's watching for her life
[2:06:05] not all these people
[2:06:07] her life to manifest that word
[2:06:10] but we're still see we're up here
[2:06:12] getting towards the top of the pyramid
[2:06:14] we're in the age of perfection and we're
[2:06:16] looking oh yeah you need to
[2:06:17] what are you doing you know no
[2:06:19] look at yourself
[2:06:21] am i ready to go
[2:06:24] hebrews 11 all these having obtained a
[2:06:27] good report
[2:06:28] through faith received not the promise
[2:06:31] god provided a better thing for us that
[2:06:33] they without us should not be made
[2:06:35] perfect
[2:06:36] god had to have a people that he could
[2:06:38] trust with a revelation of his word you
[2:06:40] see so they're waiting for us we hold
[2:06:43] the key they're waiting for us to get in
[2:06:45] line getting get in step
[2:06:46] see we hold the key
[2:06:48] and so many times today there's people
[2:06:50] wasting time wasting money on
[2:06:53] foolishness
[2:06:54] not getting ready to go building bigger
[2:06:57] and you know now you all need a bigger
[2:06:58] church obviously but we're talking about
[2:07:00] foolishness out there you know
[2:07:02] so it's because we still have three
[2:07:04] kinds of believers
[2:07:06] only in heaven there'll be no mate
[2:07:08] believers no unbelievers
[2:07:10] you won't have to watch what you say
[2:07:11] it'll all be peace
[2:07:14] jesus told us in matthew 24 that would
[2:07:16] come those along that claim to be
[2:07:18] anointed
[2:07:19] and appear to be very special
[2:07:21] because they say things like follow me
[2:07:23] single file i know the
[2:07:25] but jesus told us in advance do not
[2:07:28] believe such people
[2:07:31] then a few years later paul came along
[2:07:32] and gave us the words over in second
[2:07:35] second thessalonians
[2:07:36] yeah second thessalonians chapter 2
[2:07:40] because he had to deal with a lot of
[2:07:41] stuff
[2:07:42] okay let's see here second thessalonians
[2:07:45] chapter 2 verse 1 now we beseech your
[2:07:48] brethren by the coming of our lord jesus
[2:07:50] christ and by the gathering together
[2:07:52] unto him that you be not soon shaken in
[2:07:55] mind or troubled
[2:07:57] neither by spirit or uh nor by word nor
[2:08:01] by letter as from us which means that
[2:08:04] there was people out there with fake
[2:08:05] letters you know
[2:08:06] as the day of christ is at hand
[2:08:10] let no man deceive you
[2:08:12] remember jesus over there in matthew 24
[2:08:15] no man deceive you let no man deceive
[2:08:17] you by any means for that day shall not
[2:08:20] come shall not come except there come a
[2:08:22] falling away first
[2:08:24] so we are looking to that day but before
[2:08:27] we get there there's going to be a
[2:08:28] falling away
[2:08:30] from the truth
[2:08:32] so here in this day i say this day
[2:08:35] this scripture is being fulfilled
[2:08:37] you see
[2:08:38] there are forces operating through
[2:08:40] people
[2:08:41] slowly removing the deity out of the
[2:08:43] name of jesus christ
[2:08:45] and they're also people actively engaged
[2:08:48] in bringing fulfillment to these verses
[2:08:50] of second thessalonians it's happening
[2:08:53] brother brendan said in 1955 as moses
[2:08:55] went with that judgment stick before him
[2:08:57] so here's this stick he found on the
[2:08:58] desert okay got this stick as moses went
[2:09:02] with that judgment stick before him that
[2:09:03] same stick tonight that the church is
[2:09:05] jesus christ if those egyptians could
[2:09:07] ever got that little simple stick out of
[2:09:09] moses hands they would have had him
[2:09:11] whipped
[2:09:12] and when the devil can never get the
[2:09:13] deity out of the name of jesus christ he
[2:09:15] will have the church whipped
[2:09:17] these aren't words to fill up the tape
[2:09:19] this is a prophet speaking these things
[2:09:22] are happening today
[2:09:24] there's people with this same bible oh
[2:09:26] jesus wasn't god
[2:09:28] well i think we'll just have to go to
[2:09:30] the bible and find out prophet says he
[2:09:32] was so we don't have to listen to you
[2:09:34] you know
[2:09:36] so quickly get away from such dangerous
[2:09:39] borderline of unbelief
[2:09:41] you see eve did not plan on going into
[2:09:44] such depths of unbelief
[2:09:46] she listens she reasoned oh well you've
[2:09:49] been here longer maybe you know what
[2:09:50] you're talking about well
[2:09:52] look where we're at
[2:09:53] perversion everything you see
[2:09:56] so none of the individuals who have
[2:09:58] turned their back on the truth
[2:10:00] that we treasure
[2:10:02] not one of them plan to go that far
[2:10:05] they really believe that they're right
[2:10:08] but one day they'll have to close the
[2:10:10] bible also
[2:10:11] because they can't go any farther so
[2:10:14] it's already predicted
[2:10:16] that it's not going to be smooth sailing
[2:10:18] troubled waters ahead
[2:10:20] and so we always thought yeah it'll be
[2:10:22] way out there no deer now
[2:10:25] now is the time
[2:10:26] but i thought everybody carrying these
[2:10:28] books and quoting our prophet will be
[2:10:30] worthy of our confidence
[2:10:31] well i wish
[2:10:33] but you better discern the spirits
[2:10:35] it's another good tape discernment of
[2:10:37] spirit 1960 covers it all
[2:10:40] in the day it's jesus they had the
[2:10:42] pharisees they knew their prophet's
[2:10:44] message to the letter
[2:10:46] they knew when you left out of the or
[2:10:47] whatever
[2:10:48] and um they were leaning very heavily on
[2:10:51] their understanding you see
[2:10:54] and we have the exact same situation
[2:10:56] today people today
[2:10:58] very important people
[2:11:00] calling for single a single file
[2:11:02] believers when brother brown says let's
[2:11:04] arm up this way across make a sweep but
[2:11:06] we're calling for single single line uh
[2:11:08] believers which means
[2:11:11] take a number go back the line don't
[2:11:13] ever raise your hand shut up
[2:11:15] follow
[2:11:16] that's not god's program you see how can
[2:11:19] this be happening very simple
[2:11:22] god's map is all on one page i know that
[2:11:24] didn't sound reasonable to some of your
[2:11:26] young people
[2:11:27] but it used to be we had a map book
[2:11:29] yeah
[2:11:30] sold it over walmart for 12.95
[2:11:33] and you want to go from texas to arizona
[2:11:36] well let's see how we're going to get
[2:11:38] there the map books in alphabetical
[2:11:39] order the states
[2:11:41] so
[2:11:42] if you're going to go west well then you
[2:11:43] got to find let's see texas well then
[2:11:45] well there's new mexico
[2:11:47] well that's arizona's clear at the front
[2:11:49] of the book god's map is all on one page
[2:11:51] okay
[2:11:52] paul wrote without controversy great is
[2:11:54] a mystery of godliness
[2:11:56] in the spanish bible it says
[2:11:58] indiscribente that means unarguably
[2:12:01] great it's a mystery of godliness
[2:12:04] so we have super intelligent people
[2:12:05] today
[2:12:06] and um they're always ready to argue and
[2:12:09] make it a matter of controversy
[2:12:11] i know them yeah friends of mine
[2:12:13] the time is now for the fulfillment of
[2:12:15] these scriptures
[2:12:16] now is the time for the manifestation of
[2:12:18] every seed according to its kind
[2:12:21] the scriptures cannot be broken they
[2:12:22] cannot be stopped it's in movement
[2:12:25] our god is on time and he's all about
[2:12:28] balance everywhere
[2:12:30] our canary brain cannot interpret the
[2:12:32] mind of god
[2:12:35] if you don't like the canaries about a
[2:12:37] chicken brain pretty small you know
[2:12:39] but god speaks to his anointed prophet
[2:12:42] god fulfills his word it's always on
[2:12:44] schedule the time is now when this
[2:12:45] prophetic word is in effect
[2:12:48] it's always been the case from the
[2:12:49] beginning from the church age from the
[2:12:51] first church until today brother branham
[2:12:54] says over here in the church age book
[2:12:56] in every age we have the exact same
[2:12:58] pattern so it's going to repeat
[2:13:00] that is why the light comes through some
[2:13:02] god-given messenger in a certain area
[2:13:04] and then from that messenger spreads the
[2:13:06] light through the ministry of others who
[2:13:08] have been faithfully taught but of
[2:13:10] course all those who go out don't always
[2:13:12] learn how necessary it is to speak only
[2:13:14] what the messenger has spoken
[2:13:16] they add here they take away there and
[2:13:18] soon the message is no longer pure
[2:13:20] revival it dies down how careful we must
[2:13:23] be to hear one voice
[2:13:26] be careful for the spirit has but one
[2:13:29] voice which is the voice of god
[2:13:31] paul warned them to say what he said
[2:13:34] even as peter did likewise so we've
[2:13:36] always had voice of god on the planet
[2:13:37] someplace
[2:13:38] he warned them that even he paul could
[2:13:40] not change one word of what he had been
[2:13:42] given by revelation
[2:13:43] how important it is to hear the voice of
[2:13:45] god by way of his messengers
[2:13:47] and then say what has been given to say
[2:13:51] to the churches so we as ministers we're
[2:13:54] not innovators we're not out here
[2:13:56] inventing and and changing things we're
[2:13:58] just trying to repeat what he said just
[2:14:00] stick with the program
[2:14:02] you know to build this church out here
[2:14:04] there's a very expensive set of
[2:14:06] blueprints
[2:14:08] and whoever comes to work well i think
[2:14:10] there ought to be an outlet here and i
[2:14:12] we don't care what you think you got to
[2:14:13] stick with the blueprint
[2:14:16] so that's the way it is here we've got
[2:14:17] to stick with what the blueprint you see
[2:14:20] and we're not money gatherers we're not
[2:14:22] the managers of god's bride
[2:14:25] no
[2:14:26] we're not seeking to control everything
[2:14:29] a minister anointed with the spirit of
[2:14:30] god genuinely trusts god for everything
[2:14:33] and he's not a micromanager
[2:14:35] so we are simply repeaters sent out to
[2:14:38] encourage the bride of christ but
[2:14:40] sometimes we've got to bring some bad
[2:14:41] news like today because these things are
[2:14:43] happening okay
[2:14:45] our job is to make christ real to the
[2:14:47] people for the perfecting of the saints
[2:14:50] we are public servants just like the
[2:14:52] garbage man he's a public servant the
[2:14:54] policeman whatever
[2:14:56] and um we uh we don't deviate from the
[2:14:58] blueprint we got to
[2:15:00] stick with it not to improvise
[2:15:03] okay 1950 prophet says lift up your
[2:15:05] heads redemption is drawing nigh get
[2:15:07] ready
[2:15:08] signs and wonders appearing
[2:15:11] critics
[2:15:12] infidels waxing worse and worse back
[2:15:14] then
[2:15:15] what would he say today
[2:15:17] we've got to put up with them but we're
[2:15:19] not looking to them we're looking to god
[2:15:22] so the time is now friends what are you
[2:15:25] focusing on
[2:15:26] are you focusing on getting ready and
[2:15:28] getting out of here what are you what
[2:15:30] are you reflecting in dark laodicea he
[2:15:32] says here you remember church that
[2:15:34] you're living in the best day that
[2:15:37] you will ever live in right now until
[2:15:39] jesus comes it shall gradually then it
[2:15:41] changes not gradually rapidly get worse
[2:15:44] and worse
[2:15:46] so when we see these things we see it
[2:15:48] happening around us what are we going to
[2:15:50] do we're going to run away and go off to
[2:15:52] montana or canada or no
[2:15:54] or we're going to call 9-1-1
[2:15:56] we can change churches now that happens
[2:15:59] well too much pressure here i'll think
[2:16:00] oh
[2:16:02] just saying
[2:16:06] we can call headquarters hey what's up
[2:16:07] what should i do now
[2:16:10] lift up your head
[2:16:12] redemption is drawing 9. luke 21 28
[2:16:15] all this is predicted to be
[2:16:17] everything that happened to jesus was
[2:16:18] predicted there was no surprises with
[2:16:20] god it was all mapped out
[2:16:22] so when these things happen
[2:16:24] just look up you can't change this you
[2:16:26] can't help it
[2:16:28] he says here and they have to call us
[2:16:30] bad names
[2:16:31] oh why why can't we just have get along
[2:16:34] they have to call us bad names they have
[2:16:36] to call the truth bad names jesus said
[2:16:38] whosoever speaks a word against the son
[2:16:39] of man it shall be forgiven when he's
[2:16:41] doing the very same thing you see done
[2:16:43] but whosoever shall speak against the
[2:16:45] holy ghost
[2:16:46] when it comes to do the same thing will
[2:16:49] never be forgiven in this world
[2:16:51] they have to do that
[2:16:53] there has to be a message like that to
[2:16:54] make people make fun of it to show god's
[2:16:57] justice to condemn the whole world and
[2:16:59] destroy it
[2:17:00] while there's mercy and someone standing
[2:17:02] in the gap jesus christ and an open door
[2:17:05] tonight won't you receive him my friend
[2:17:07] won't you get yourself straightened up
[2:17:09] and start at the foot of the cross
[2:17:12] 1961 abraham and his seat after him
[2:17:16] do you know what god did he reached out
[2:17:18] with his hand and stopped it he is
[2:17:20] holding time in his hand for the church
[2:17:22] to make itself ready
[2:17:24] there's a few members yet to come into
[2:17:26] the body of christ maybe one of them is
[2:17:28] here today that's why i'm here that's
[2:17:30] why i'm led to be here is to portray you
[2:17:33] i'm not saying don't be a catholic don't
[2:17:35] be methodist not saying that
[2:17:38] but i want you to be filled with this
[2:17:39] spirit just remember i'll meet you on
[2:17:41] that day
[2:17:43] and these words will be a witness
[2:17:44] against you it's all on god's tape
[2:17:46] recording with this great picture camera
[2:17:49] and you sitting there walking away and
[2:17:51] leaving it you'll see yourself that day
[2:17:54] in the mirror of god
[2:17:58] he says the gospel and the power of
[2:18:00] almighty god has spread around the world
[2:18:02] and the separation time is now taking
[2:18:04] place god is calling a bride the devil
[2:18:07] is calling a church
[2:18:08] let me be part of that bride
[2:18:10] you have a choice
[2:18:12] it's not over yet
[2:18:14] you still have a choice
[2:18:15] so the time is now
[2:18:18] don't let another hour go by
[2:18:20] without getting totally serious
[2:18:22] be sure this is not just something you
[2:18:24] learn
[2:18:25] and you're repeated
[2:18:27] and um
[2:18:28] like i was telling you before they read
[2:18:31] a portion of their prophet's message
[2:18:33] every saturday in the synagogues
[2:18:35] and we come around a similar situation
[2:18:37] it's got to be alive you see
[2:18:41] so we must know the reality of believing
[2:18:43] god
[2:18:44] so you must be born again partake in the
[2:18:46] kingdom of god
[2:18:47] and
[2:18:49] the word has come to a place
[2:18:52] where god has brought you to a place
[2:18:54] where you need to be to be restored you
[2:18:56] see
[2:18:57] that's the ministry of elijah to restore
[2:19:00] places in correct position for the
[2:19:02] resurrection and the rapturing of a
[2:19:04] special people now a couple more things
[2:19:07] in the third seal now notice
[2:19:09] that god told eve that after a long
[2:19:12] after so long a time the word is coming
[2:19:14] back to you now how does she fall i want
[2:19:16] my class to say it what did she fall
[2:19:18] from the word
[2:19:21] the word and god said he would make a
[2:19:23] way to redeem her back to the word again
[2:19:26] after so long a time the word would be
[2:19:29] made known to her all right the word
[2:19:32] would come back for one purpose now hold
[2:19:34] that what i'm saying the word would come
[2:19:37] back to her for one purpose for
[2:19:39] redemption
[2:19:41] he says jesus overcame by the word eve
[2:19:44] fell to the personal temptation of satan
[2:19:46] by falling by failing to use the word
[2:19:49] adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[2:19:51] word but jesus overcame by the word and
[2:19:54] right now let me say this is the only
[2:19:57] way to be an overcomer it is the only
[2:20:00] way that you can know if you're
[2:20:02] overcoming because the word cannot fail
[2:20:05] so to stay balanced we've got four steps
[2:20:08] you read your bible
[2:20:10] okay
[2:20:11] if you just read a chapter a day
[2:20:13] read your bible
[2:20:15] listen to 20 minutes of god's anointed
[2:20:17] prophet
[2:20:19] there's other preachers on the radio
[2:20:20] yeah but listen to the prophet
[2:20:22] read a page in your church age book it
[2:20:25] won't hurt you
[2:20:27] and you pray
[2:20:28] even when you're stuck in traffic you
[2:20:29] pray you create your own personal
[2:20:31] atmosphere
[2:20:32] with these steps you will prosper as an
[2:20:34] individual and you'll prosper as a body
[2:20:36] of believers
[2:20:39] as the musicians come
[2:20:41] james 4 says resist the devil and he
[2:20:44] will flee from you
[2:20:46] the next verse draw near to god and he
[2:20:48] will draw near to you but you have a
[2:20:50] part to play it's not so automatic see
[2:20:54] god is not unreasonable
[2:20:56] unreachable he loves you he cares for
[2:20:58] you
[2:21:00] so in closing
[2:21:01] pay attention you don't read if you
[2:21:03] don't take anything else away from here
[2:21:05] how can a believer avoid the traps
[2:21:07] and side roads that satan has so
[2:21:10] smoothly prepared the solution is right
[2:21:13] here in your bible
[2:21:15] you know paul traveled about ten
[2:21:17] thousand miles in 30 years
[2:21:19] he didn't have an suv he walked and had
[2:21:22] a horse
[2:21:23] and he spent some time in an area known
[2:21:26] as galatia
[2:21:28] had some converts
[2:21:30] they believed they were baptized but in
[2:21:32] a very
[2:21:34] a few months later he comes by the twin
[2:21:36] had showed up just like in the time of
[2:21:38] william branham i knew that some of the
[2:21:40] twins
[2:21:41] and so
[2:21:43] paul comes back to check on him a few
[2:21:45] months later
[2:21:46] and
[2:21:48] to check on the believers
[2:21:50] no cell phones how you all do it no he
[2:21:51] had to go there
[2:21:53] and he came back
[2:21:55] what do you think he found
[2:21:57] the twin had come by
[2:21:59] and caught the attention of some of them
[2:22:02] and so he's speaking to them and over
[2:22:05] here in chapter one of galatians
[2:22:07] he says
[2:22:08] i marvel i'm surprised that you're so
[2:22:11] soon removed from him that called you
[2:22:13] into the grace of christ and to another
[2:22:15] gospel which is not another
[2:22:18] but there be some that trouble you cause
[2:22:20] confusion
[2:22:22] and
[2:22:23] and and would pervert the gospel of
[2:22:25] christ but if i come back
[2:22:28] next week
[2:22:29] if silas comes
[2:22:31] if if william branham comes if david
[2:22:34] mcgarry or george smith or if an angel
[2:22:36] boom
[2:22:37] and bring something different than what
[2:22:39] i already gave you by revelation
[2:22:41] don't accept it
[2:22:43] because he's going to the hot place
[2:22:46] so the only thing that's real is what
[2:22:48] is squared with paul's gospel
[2:22:51] may god have mercy let's stand together
[2:22:54] sweep over my soul
[2:22:56] sweep over my soul i believe it's on
[2:22:57] your
[2:22:58] computer there's some place
[2:23:03] sweep
[2:23:04] over my
[2:23:06] souls

[2:27:09] [Music]
[2:27:12] [Applause]
[2:27:14] [Music]
[2:27:19] [Applause]
[2:27:23] now if you just happen to have a few
[2:27:26] little dollar bills you want to stick
[2:27:28] and
[2:27:32] ben and janna's hand that would just be
[2:27:34] all right with me
[2:27:36] okay just
[2:27:38] you know they're fixing to go on their
[2:27:39] honeymoon very rarely do we get a
[2:27:42] married couple to be able to be with us
[2:27:44] in service so i just think it's awesome
[2:27:47] i think it kind of shows where the
[2:27:48] hearts at don't you
[2:27:50] amen what's number one so i think that's
[2:27:53] great so don't be afraid just to if
[2:27:56] you've only got a nickel give them a
[2:27:57] nickel
[2:27:59] maybe they can buy uh what can you buy
[2:28:02] anything for a nickel
[2:28:04] i don't know give them but they'll maybe
[2:28:06] they'll add up so just just show your
[2:28:09] love to them and we really appreciate it
[2:28:11] we appreciate having all our visitors
[2:28:13] here
[2:28:14] but i think when we sum up
[2:28:16] this morning
[2:28:18] i think we realize that the weight of it
[2:28:21] falls on each of us
[2:28:23] as individuals
[2:28:25] it's not going to be a group thing
[2:28:27] i like being in groups
[2:28:30] you can hide in a group
[2:28:32] but when we stand in that light
[2:28:35] it's just going to be what our thoughts
[2:28:37] were
[2:28:38] what our actions were
[2:28:40] where our affections were and what we
[2:28:43] had first in our lives
[2:28:46] uh and you know and this whole society
[2:28:49] we're in
[2:28:50] is so instant
[2:28:52] and
[2:28:53] you know that
[2:28:55] we just hardly wait on the lord anymore
[2:28:58] just get alone in his presence and let
[2:29:00] him speak to you and talk to you
[2:29:03] and look at your life in the mirror and
[2:29:06] and see how that you can
[2:29:09] go farther examine yourself and
[2:29:12] and line yourself up with the word
[2:29:15] amen we live by the word of god
[2:29:18] so let this morning
[2:29:21] as we covered so many scriptures
[2:29:24] but let it set with us
[2:29:26] in our hearts that i've got a
[2:29:29] responsibility
[2:29:31] i got a responsibility to
[2:29:34] myself to make my life right
[2:29:38] because i have to remove the beam
[2:29:42] from my own eye
[2:29:44] before i can even approach the sliver
[2:29:47] in someone else's i've got to make sure
[2:29:49] my light
[2:29:50] is shining bright
[2:29:52] and my lamp is trimmed and clear
[2:29:55] i've got to set myself down for personal
[2:29:58] examination
[2:30:00] and there's so many things out there to
[2:30:03] distract us from that
[2:30:06] we can overwork
[2:30:08] we can overdo a lot of things but we
[2:30:10] can't over pray
[2:30:12] and so i hope this morning that each of
[2:30:15] us makes a commitment
[2:30:18] to the scriptures
[2:30:19] and to our own personal life
[2:30:22] hidden christ
[2:30:24] and i think if we do that
[2:30:26] [Music]
[2:30:28] i think we'll see
[2:30:30] a candle set on a hilltop
[2:30:34] and that one that's lost that we're
[2:30:36] waiting for
[2:30:37] he may see a light
[2:30:40] just like
[2:30:41] moses saw
[2:30:42] a burning bush
[2:30:44] and he was attracted to that light
[2:30:47] may your life be so set aside in the
[2:30:49] lord
[2:30:50] that someone's attracted to you
[2:30:53] to what hope it is
[2:30:55] and this morning if you're not as close
[2:30:57] to him as you ought to be
[2:31:00] he hasn't went anywhere
[2:31:04] he's right where you left him
[2:31:09] he never took a step away from you
[2:31:13] but if you draw an eye unto him he'll
[2:31:15] draw an eye unto you
[2:31:18] so as we go and
[2:31:21] you greet our lovely
[2:31:23] newly wedded couple
[2:31:25] remember that you're wed too
[2:31:28] then you have a husband to serve
[2:31:30] and his name's the lord jesus christ so
[2:31:33] let's little have such a
[2:31:36] a great dedication as we go this morning
[2:31:38] we'll sing this song is our dismissal
[2:31:41] song this morning
[2:31:42] let us bow our heads one more time in
[2:31:45] prayer
[2:31:46] our heavenly father we've assembled here
[2:31:48] from many places
[2:31:52] many of our fellow believers from
[2:31:57] our neighboring state of alabama have
[2:32:00] come father to spend this time with us
[2:32:04] before they return home to their
[2:32:06] battlefield
[2:32:09] where you have placed them
[2:32:12] to spread the light
[2:32:14] and the good hope
[2:32:17] and the hope of the delivering power
[2:32:20] of the cross at calvary
[2:32:22] we ask that you bless them father
[2:32:25] may they prosper and be in good health
[2:32:28] father may they multiply
[2:32:31] father may they have fruits of their
[2:32:32] labor
[2:32:34] and father may you bring them and guide
[2:32:36] them ever closer to the true word of god
[2:32:40] that they might grow in wisdom and
[2:32:41] knowledge
[2:32:43] father
[2:32:44] for all our visitors from wherever they
[2:32:47] come
[2:32:48] may this same hope
[2:32:50] go with each of us for those that are
[2:32:52] here local father may we ever become
[2:32:55] more dedicated
[2:32:57] to the truth of your word
[2:33:00] the solemn holiness
[2:33:03] and sacredness of the gospel
[2:33:06] may we get not caught up in the flighty
[2:33:08] laughter
[2:33:09] of lady osea
[2:33:12] may we rededicate our hearts
[2:33:15] and rededicate our lives
[2:33:18] may we realize the importance
[2:33:21] of the closing hours of time
[2:33:24] and may we keep in sight the great
[2:33:27] reward that waits for those
[2:33:31] that serve him
[2:33:33] be with us now as we go
[2:33:35] in jesus precious
[2:33:37] and wonderful name we pray
[2:33:40] amen god bless you go in peace
