[24:13] [Music]
[24:24] Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[24:27] Lord, truly we thank you for your love,
[24:29] Lord. And we can only love you because
[24:31] you first loved us.
[24:34] Father, your word said, "What manner of
[24:36] love was bestowed upon us that we would
[24:38] be called the sons and daughters of God?
[24:41] That even now we're called sons and
[24:42] daughters of God."
[24:45] Lord, your prophet said the greatest
[24:46] gift that was ever given to mankind was
[24:48] the privilege that we can bow our head,
[24:51] close our eyes, and speak to you. Lord,
[24:53] we do it by faith right now, believing,
[24:55] Lord, that you hear us. Father, you're
[24:58] faithful to your word, Lord. And Father,
[25:01] there's a comfort knowing, Lord, that
[25:03] you watch over us as a father, Lord.
[25:04] Everything that we have need of,
[25:07] Lord, the uplifted hands here this
[25:09] evening, Lord, we just pray that you
[25:11] would move on behalf of everyone, Lord.
[25:14] God, the price has been paid and a
[25:16] promise has been made for everything
[25:17] that we have need of, Lord. We just need
[25:19] revelation, Lord, and faith, Father, to
[25:22] bring it to pass, Lord, of patience.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; I pray, God, that for every need that's
[25:26] in here, Lord, every heart that you
[25:28] would drive away the fear, drive away
[25:30] any complex, any unbelief or doubt. But,
[25:33] Father, that you would by the preaching
[25:34] of your word tonight, Lord, let faith be
[25:37] built up in every one of the hearts here
[25:39] this evening, Lord. God, we heard you
[25:42] this morning, Lord. Father, we're just
[25:44] trusting, Lord, that we not be hearers
[25:46] only, but doers, Lord. And I pray that
[25:48] tonight you would chip away from the
[25:50] things, Lord, or chip away these things,
[25:52] Father, that we don't have need of,
[25:54] Lord. And that you would continue to
[25:56] just soften the ground in our hearts,
[25:57] Lord. Father, speak to us. I pray, Lord,
[26:00] that you just take the Lord, the
[26:02] minister tonight, Lord. God, give him
[26:04] the words to every needy heart this
[26:06] evening, Lord. Father, we ask in your
[26:09] name because you said whatsoever we ask
[26:11] in your name that you would do. That
[26:12] you'd grant the desires of our heart,
[26:14] Lord, and that you're faithful. Lord, we
[26:17] just thank you. We ask your blessing
[26:18] upon the tithes and offerings, Lord,
[26:20] that you'd bless them to the furthering
[26:22] of your kingdom, Lord. Father, we just
[26:24] commit the rest of the service to you.
[26:26] In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

[38:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh we'll read 16 through uh
[38:53] &gt;&gt; 221. It says, "And behold, one came and
[38:58] said unto him, good master, what good
[39:01] thing shall I do that I may have eternal
[39:05] life?" And he said unto him, why thou
[39:08] calllestth me good? There's only one
[39:10] good. There's only one good. There's
[39:14] none good but one, that is God. But if
[39:18] thou will enter into life, keep the
[39:21] commandment. He said unto him, which
[39:25] Jesus said, thou sh thou, he says, thou
[39:29] shalt do not murder. Thou shalt not
[39:32] commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal.
[39:35] Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honor
[39:38] thy father and thy mother, and thou
[39:40] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. The
[39:43] young man said unto him, All these
[39:46] things I have I kept from my youth up.
[39:50] What lackth thy what lack thy yet? Jesus
[39:54] said unto him, "If thou will be perfect,
[39:58] go and sell that thou has, give to the
[40:04] poor,
[40:05] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,
[40:09] and come and follow me." But when the
[40:12] young man When a young man heard that
[40:14] saying, he was he went away sorrowful.
[40:18] He had a great possessions.
[40:23] May the Lord bless the reading of his
[40:25] word. You may have your seats.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; I believe we're so happy to be gathering
[40:35] the house of God tonight.
[40:41] After the service from the pastor this
[40:44] morning,
[40:46] &gt;&gt; I don't even I found I don't feel worthy
[40:48] to speak tonight.
[40:55] [Music]
[40:58] And I was talking about the things that
[41:00] are happening in the message and how
[41:03] important it is that we return back to
[41:05] the principles.
[41:10] How in order to go forward, we have to
[41:12] come back to the message.
[41:20] We have to come back to the spirit that
[41:22] was in the message and the spirit that
[41:24] was upon the prophet.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; He he spoke about music music and
[41:30] dancing
[41:33] and as he was speaking about those
[41:35] things some came something came into my
[41:37] mind
[41:40] and worship and all those things
[41:44] it's part of the Christianity it's part
[41:46] of
[41:48] A true Christian loves music and love
[41:51] worship.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; But Christian music
[41:56] [Music]
[42:00] always has something sacred about it.
[42:03] [Music]
[42:05] satisfy.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; It's not something that is just there to
[42:10] satisfy the carnal
[42:13] [Music]
[42:15] &gt;&gt; just to to rejoice.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; But it's something it's something that
[42:23] brings us into the presence of God.
[42:31] I was thinking about in the Bible it
[42:33] talks about in the book of 1st Samuel
[42:34] chapter 16
[42:40] that when Saul was possessed of the evil
[42:43] spirit
[42:46] that that David will come and will pray
[42:48] and harp
[42:52] and that music will cast away the evil
[42:55] spirit.
[42:58] So the true music, Christian music,
[43:03] &gt;&gt; it will cast away demons.
[43:08] But today we have the impression
[43:12] that what we have called Christian music
[43:17] that those that are called Christian
[43:19] musicians
[43:21] [Music]
[43:22] in instead of uh uh uh praying to cast
[43:25] away demons.
[43:28] They actually play in order to cause
[43:30] people to just dance
[43:34] &gt;&gt; or to to to cause the demons to dance
[43:42] it even to the point where music sort of
[43:45] plays in clubs and and and bars.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; It's the same music that's playing in in
[43:52] uh uh uh pagan uh manifestations.
[43:58] We call it Christian music.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Music
[44:02] &gt;&gt; music of the message.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; It's it's a shame for us.
[44:12] I
[44:12] &gt;&gt; I believe I understand the emotion that
[44:14] our pastor was under this morning.
[44:20] even in music.
[44:26] The Bible tells us in 2 Kings chapter 3
[44:32] that there was the king of Israel who
[44:34] was Ahab's son
[44:38] who was supposed to go fight the
[44:39] Moabitete
[44:42] and he called Jehoshaphat the king of
[44:44] Judah
[44:46] to go with him.
[44:52] And Joseph had told him, he said, "I
[44:53] can't go with you unless I consult what
[44:56] the word of God says."
[44:58] &gt;&gt; So they went, they went to Elijah the
[45:01] Tishb.
[45:09] And Elisha was completely
[45:12] mad on the king of Israel.
[45:17] He said, "What is it between you and I?
[45:21] Go and follow the gods of your fathers
[45:25] that if it wasn't for Joseph,
[45:29] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't even say a word to you."
[45:33] And as he was m happy,
[45:38] there was a musician who came by
[45:41] [Music]
[45:43] and as the music began to be played,
[45:47] It came that Elisha came down
[45:53] &gt;&gt; and the scripture says that the uncction
[45:55] the spirit of God came upon him
[46:03] says that when a good when a good and
[46:05] decent music is played before the
[46:07] preacher come to the pulpit
[46:11] it causes the anointing to fail.
[46:13] [Music]
[46:15] But today we have the impression
[46:20] that the music instead of bringing the
[46:22] spirit and the anction
[46:26] &gt;&gt; the the music is rather bringing
[46:28] emotions
[46:29] the agitations
[46:32] and sometimes even pride
[46:39] where they sing to elevate the preacher.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; And when it comes to the pulpit
[46:45] and he's already lifted up.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; May God have mercy upon us.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; God placed in my heart
[46:57] &gt;&gt; to speak on a subject
[47:03] to be the living tabernacle of the
[47:06] living God.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; And as I was thinking on that,
[47:17] the the Lord led me to that scripture
[47:19] that we read, be perfect as your
[47:21] heavenly father is perfect.
[47:25] And when I read that scripture,
[47:30] uh my heart went to this other scripture
[47:31] that we read of the rich young ruler
[47:36] and I believe we are rich today in this
[47:38] world.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; We are rich. We have a lot of riches in
[47:43] this world.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; It looks like there's a lot of uh uh
[47:50] vitamins from the world into the
[47:52] message.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said to this young man,
[47:59] &gt;&gt; if you want to be perfect,
[48:03] &gt;&gt; he showed him the way,
[48:05] &gt;&gt; go,
[48:07] &gt;&gt; sell everything that thou has.
[48:12] Sell your unbelief.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Sell your own way of thinking about the
[48:21] message.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Sell your own understanding of the
[48:27] message
[48:29] then come and follow me.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:36] And I believe the best way to come and
[48:38] follow Jesus
[48:43] &gt;&gt; is to listen to the voice of a true
[48:45] messenger of a true prophet.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; And as brother David told us this
[48:51] morning
[48:52] &gt;&gt; if we love him
[48:55] that we continue to listen to that
[48:57] voice.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And I believe that we all love him
[49:01] tonight.
[49:04] So for 35 minutes,
[49:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to continue where we left off
[49:10] this morning
[49:13] to paragraph 240
[49:17] and I won't have any comment to make at
[49:19] the end. I'll let Billy just close it.
[49:26] If you can start from paragraph 132.
[49:55] Oh, how we need today a call back to the
[49:59] word of the Lord.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Look, today in our nation needs a call
[50:03] back.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Going to speak one of these nights if I
[50:08] can. I want I've got an indictment. And
[50:10] I won't wait to get all the preachers
[50:11] together.
[50:13] I want to indict this generation of the
[50:15] blood of Jesus Christ and prove it to
[50:17] you. Now
[50:20] I may
[50:22] get out somewhere to do that. But we'll
[50:24] we'll see if we can have a breakfast
[50:26] some morning just for ministers. And I I
[50:28] want to Lord helping me to show exactly
[50:31] where we're where we're heading the
[50:33] wrong way.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; We got to come back. There's no other
[50:37] way but come back. Amen.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Right. Look at our nation today. Look
[50:43] what we're trying to do. The very thing
[50:45] that took place in a dark age. Unite
[50:48] church and state together. Look at the
[50:50] you uni union or the the world council
[50:54] of churches. All the churches going into
[50:56] this world council of churches and they
[50:59] think this is the oneness of God because
[51:03] all the churches United brethren man the
[51:06] fundamental churches go into this great
[51:10] one big organization that's because of
[51:12] lacking knowing the word of God
[51:15] &gt;&gt; the prophet spoke at that thing would
[51:17] take place and make an image unto the
[51:19] beast
[51:20] &gt;&gt; and it have power to speak or do you
[51:22] think Amos could stand in a pull pit
[51:24] tonight down here if he was in Phoenix
[51:26] and fail to cry out on that thing.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be that he'd be against us,
[51:31] the brethren. But he'd be against the
[51:33] system that's drawing us away from the
[51:35] word. That would be what he would do.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; How can those men walk together? The
[51:39] Bible said here in your Amos, the Lord
[51:41] said, tell the people, "How can two walk
[51:43] together without they be agreed?"
[51:46] How are we going to take our Pentecostal
[51:49] groups and go into the world council of
[51:52] churches when half of them in there more
[51:55] than have 85 or 95% even deny the virgin
[51:59] birth.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; They deny I guess 99% of them divi the
[52:04] they deny vine divine healing. They deny
[52:08] the principles of the Bible. They deny
[52:11] the speaking with tongues. Only the
[52:13] Pentecostal group alone takes that. And
[52:16] how are we going to unite ourselves with
[52:18] them in a oneness?
[52:21] &gt;&gt; How are we going to be one with them?
[52:23] How are we going to walk with them
[52:24] without being agreed with them?
[52:27] &gt;&gt; How are you going to do it? You'll have
[52:28] to deny the great evangelical beliefs
[52:31] that you have, the fundamental
[52:33] principles of the Bible to walk with
[52:35] them.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; I tell you, God calls an individual.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; He's calling you as an individual. to
[52:43] stay with his word and stay with him.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; How could God walk with them when their
[52:50] own creeds made up by their own worldly
[52:54] wisdom denies word?
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; When a creed accepts a doctrine of a
[53:00] group of man together
[53:03] and denies the word being sold.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Then you turn God from you.
[53:10] God is holy and God, the Bible says he
[53:15] watches over his word to a vindicate it.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; And how can he a vindicate the word when
[53:20] the word isn't there?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; That's the reason we have members
[53:28] instead of children.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; That's we have creed and everybody can.
[53:34] The world is looking for a Superman.
[53:37] They're working for they're looking for
[53:38] something that can let them hold on
[53:40] their Christian profession and live any
[53:42] way they want to.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; The women want to act like Hollywood and
[53:46] still maintain that they got the Holy
[53:48] Ghost.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; The preachers want to build the biggest
[53:51] church and do all these things and have
[53:53] deacons and married many times and and
[53:56] they can do these little things and wear
[53:58] these clothes. They call it the
[54:00] liberation of women.
[54:04] You think Amos would stand still for
[54:06] that?
[54:08] &gt;&gt; No. Indeed he wouldn't.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; You think Amos to stand still and meet
[54:12] with the hierarchies and the bishops up
[54:15] there and say, "Brethren, I think you've
[54:16] done a great thing." You'd say, "You
[54:19] bunch of renegades.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; You impostors,
[54:24] &gt;&gt; you deniers of the faith."
[54:28] He'd say the same thing that Micah said
[54:30] that day before those 400 self-style
[54:33] Hebrew prophets
[54:35] &gt;&gt; they said in a number a multitude isn't
[54:37] there safety depends on where you want
[54:39] to apply that scripture I can say Judas
[54:42] went and hung himself and you go do the
[54:44] same thing
[54:46] &gt;&gt; it doesn't apply there and it doesn't
[54:49] apply that in the multitude of counsel
[54:51] there's safety the Catholic church has
[54:54] it on all of you then
[54:56] &gt;&gt; in the word of God, their safety. The
[54:59] Bible said, "The name of the Lord is a
[55:01] mighty tower. The righteous run into it
[55:03] and are safe." And that's the only safe
[55:05] spot I know.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; The prophets always believe that when
[55:13] Abraham died, when when Job died, he
[55:17] placed himself in the promised land, his
[55:19] grave. When Abraham died, he bought a
[55:22] partial land right in the same place.
[55:24] But Job, what did he do? He watched that
[55:27] prophet. He know that was a man of God.
[55:30] And he said, "I know my redeemer liveth.
[55:32] At the last days he'll stand on the
[55:34] earth. Though at the skinworms has
[55:36] destroyed this body, yet my flesh I see
[55:38] God."
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Abraham knew that. He buried
[55:43] Sarah there. He bought a parcel of land
[55:46] and buried. He himself was buried there.
[55:49] Isaac when he died, he was taken back
[55:51] and buried there. Isaac begott Jacob and
[55:53] Jacob died way down uh in Egypt. But
[55:58] before he died, he called his prophet's
[56:01] son Joseph. And he knowed he was a
[56:04] prophet, spiritual man. Interpret dreams
[56:07] and saw visions is perfectly right each
[56:10] time.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come here, Joseph, my
[56:13] prophet's son. Lay your hand upon this
[56:16] hip that the almighty God touched me
[56:18] years ago and change my name from
[56:20] suppler to a prince with God.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Lay your hands up here and swear by that
[56:25] God that you'll not bury me down here in
[56:27] Egypt.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. What difference did it make?
[56:32] That's what they say today. What
[56:33] difference does it make? We get a bunch
[56:35] of people get him to join church and off
[56:37] the streets. You sometime make him a
[56:39] two-fold more child of hell than he was
[56:41] out on the street.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:44] [Music]
[56:46] does make a difference.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Joseph when he died, he made mention
[56:50] said, "Someday the Lord God will visit
[56:52] you." He's a prophet.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord God will visit you
[56:55] and don't you leave my bones down here,
[56:57] but take them up in the promised land."
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Why? He know that the first fruit of the
[57:03] resurrection would come out of the
[57:04] promised land.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Jesus when he died and rose up
[57:09] on Easter morning, the Bible said that
[57:11] many of the saints that slept in the
[57:13] dust rose and come out of the graves and
[57:16] appeared to many. Who was it? Abraham,
[57:18] Isaac, Jacob, Joseph. Why? They were in
[57:21] the right place. That's the reason I
[57:23] said it does make a difference. You just
[57:25] don't bury me out here in some
[57:27] Methodist, Baptist, or some other
[57:28] church. Bury me in Jesus. For them that
[57:31] are in Christ, what God brings in. And
[57:33] it does make a difference.
[57:37] It's early enough.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Don't let somebody tell you because you
[57:40] jarn in church. Amos will never stand
[57:42] still for that. He said the very God
[57:44] that you're saying that you serve. I'd
[57:47] say this in the name of the Lord. The
[57:49] very God that this nation's supposed to
[57:51] represent will destroy this nation.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; He'll destroy these churches. The God of
[58:00] heaven will send down his wrath and
[58:03] judgment and destroy these churches,
[58:07] &gt;&gt; so-called churches,
[58:10] &gt;&gt; remember, you take my word, there's
[58:12] nobody can join the church.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; You join a lodge.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; You don't join a church, you're born in
[58:17] a church.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; You join a Methodist lodge, Baptist
[58:21] lodge, Catholic lodge, Pentecostal
[58:23] lodge, but you're born into the church
[58:25] of the living God. And that's what he's
[58:27] coming after. that church.
[58:30] So we have lodges, not churches.
[58:33] Anything together in that lodge,
[58:35] hypocrites and everything else. But I'll
[58:37] let you know this right now. According
[58:38] to the word, there's not one hypocrite
[58:40] in the church of the living God.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; And nothing there but saints.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Now, the membership can take you in. And
[58:48] you think, you think Amos wouldn't blast
[58:51] that? He'd shake that thing to its
[58:53] foundation.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; He certainly would.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, when Israel was on its road
[59:00] up into the promised land led by the
[59:02] Holy Ghost, a pillar of fire was before
[59:05] them. A smitten rock followed him. And
[59:08] there come Moy about which was a
[59:10] brethren. Remember, he was part of
[59:13] Israel too. He was part from that Jewish
[59:17] descent because it was Lot's child
[59:22] by his daughter that brought out Moab.
[59:25] And look at Balum their priest come out
[59:28] there and made an altar offered the same
[59:31] kind of sacrifice and just as
[59:33] fundamental as he could be.
[59:35] See, and he had celebrity with him. He
[59:39] had the king.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; He had all the great men, the princes
[59:43] and the unics standing with him. But
[59:46] there was one standing with Moses
[59:49] &gt;&gt; that he didn't see.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; That's who stood with Amos. That's who
[59:54] will stand with every person that'll
[59:57] stand for God in righteousness.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; No matter how much potent monarchs
[1:00:04] desire doesn't have one thing to do with
[1:00:06] it, they'll never be able to curse what
[1:00:08] God has blessed.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Why? It's a living seed. It's a word of
[1:00:12] God. It'll grow to its perfection.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; No signs of the living God in the camp.
[1:00:21] That's looked like that Israel had done
[1:00:23] wrong down there, but they failed to see
[1:00:25] that smitten rock and that atonement
[1:00:27] being made for Israel. And there was a
[1:00:29] shout of the king in the camp.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; God was with him. Why? He was healing
[1:00:35] the sick and doing great miracles and
[1:00:36] signs and wonders. And a pillar of fire
[1:00:39] hung over him.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Moses was following a pillar of fire.
[1:00:42] The children of Israel was following
[1:00:44] Moses. And they were on the road to the
[1:00:46] promised land. And there's nothing going
[1:00:47] to stop them.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:50] Oh, could it not be easy repeated today
[1:00:52] if God could get somebody in his hand,
[1:00:55] in his control?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; That pillar of fire is still alive.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; He's still the same yesterday, today,
[1:01:00] and forever. The word still lives.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; God sent us an Amos.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; That's it'll stand for truth and right.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Shake these things. You see, could we
[1:01:14] What kind of results do you think he
[1:01:16] would have? Well, he would have a result
[1:01:18] that he would call all those that God
[1:01:21] had for ordained to be called. That's
[1:01:23] who he get. All the fathers give him, he
[1:01:25] will come.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Micah was before Ahab and Ahab
[1:01:30] hated him. All the ministerial group was
[1:01:33] against him and they all was inspired
[1:01:36] too. But their inspiration didn't cope
[1:01:39] with the word. I suppose maybe Amos hit
[1:01:42] that same thing when the priest walked
[1:01:44] out in the street said, "Now wait a
[1:01:46] minute. What? What? Show me your
[1:01:48] credentials. What school did you come
[1:01:50] from?
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; What lineage did you come out of?
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Are you a Who made you a priest? You'd
[1:01:57] say, "God made me one.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; What school are you from?" Jehovah God.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; I have thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; They listen to him. Certainly not. They
[1:02:09] didn't want to hear that guy. Certainly
[1:02:11] not. They didn't want. And yet that man
[1:02:13] might said, "I'm inspired." Well, I
[1:02:15] belong to the great church of the
[1:02:17] Pharisees here. Look how God has blessed
[1:02:19] us. We put golden altars in. We put
[1:02:22] temples on. We've done all these things
[1:02:24] and our missionary offering is greater
[1:02:26] than any of the rest of the churches
[1:02:27] throughout all Judea. Well, we do all
[1:02:29] these things here. Our people are great
[1:02:31] tithe payers and all that. Yet, Micah or
[1:02:34] Amos stood there and said, "The God that
[1:02:37] you claim that you're serving is going
[1:02:38] to destroy you."
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; And it happened that way.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not condemning missionary
[1:02:43] programs. I'm not condemning big
[1:02:45] churches, but the trouble is people gets
[1:02:47] your eyes upon that
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; and upon off the word and finally it
[1:02:52] leads you right off into that thing and
[1:02:54] you find yourself slipping. Come right
[1:02:56] back to the word.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Don't get away from it.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we need a crow the wilderness
[1:03:04] today. Certainly is true. Now certainly
[1:03:09] other reasons
[1:03:11] people reason they want to reason.
[1:03:15] That's the first thing that got a that's
[1:03:17] what lost the fellowship of the human
[1:03:20] race is when Satan introduced a program
[1:03:23] of reasoning against the word being so
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; and it sound very logical. Let's just
[1:03:29] take Satan what he might have said to
[1:03:31] Eve when God barricaded them in by his
[1:03:33] word. That's the only thing that God
[1:03:36] ever did give his people to fortify them
[1:03:39] from the enemy was the word.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; He never give us a creed.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; He never give us nothing but his word.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; That's all. And God is infinite,
[1:03:50] omnipotent,
[1:03:52] unchangeable.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; He cannot change.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; His first program is perfect.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; He never has to alter it. His first
[1:04:01] decision when man sinned and crossed
[1:04:03] that great chasm between him and God
[1:04:05] leaving himself no way back. God full of
[1:04:08] mercy and grace
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; accepted a substitute.
[1:04:13] Only a God that's full of mercy and
[1:04:15] grace could do a thing like that.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; He accepted a substitute and that
[1:04:20] substitute was blood.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; That's the only place that man could
[1:04:23] ever come in fellowship with God again
[1:04:25] is under the shed blood. And it's never
[1:04:27] been any time that man could fellowship
[1:04:30] to God only by the blood.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; And it's so true
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; where he fellowships with God. Now Eve
[1:04:39] let down the bars.
[1:04:42] Eve began to reason. Satan said like
[1:04:44] this. Now you're you don't know. You
[1:04:47] haven't had any schooling yet. I'm the
[1:04:50] professor of the seminary out here. His
[1:04:53] own.
[1:04:54] And uh I tell you, we've learned some
[1:04:56] things out there. We learned that God is
[1:05:00] so good. We learned in our seminary that
[1:05:03] God is so good. He don't expect you to
[1:05:05] do all he wrote there. He doesn't expect
[1:05:08] that. Yeah. But she said the Lord God
[1:05:10] said, "Ah, she'd have made a good
[1:05:12] preacher." She stayed on that.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; That's reason she's condemned to be one
[1:05:16] today. Keep her away from him.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; What would Amos say about that?
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wish I could hear him for about
[1:05:24] five minutes and record his message. I'd
[1:05:26] put it right on tape and let the whole
[1:05:27] world hear it. And I could keep quiet
[1:05:30] about it from then on. Notice, yes, sir,
[1:05:32] he would condemn him. And notice what
[1:05:35] she said. Now, Satan said, now he
[1:05:37] couldn't do that with Eve. You he could
[1:05:38] do that Adam, but he did with Eve.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; So, he said to Eve. Now, now you know
[1:05:43] this. He said, you know, surely God's
[1:05:47] too good to hurt you. God, you surely
[1:05:50] won't. You know, he's a good God. We
[1:05:52] hear so much of that today.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; He is a good God,
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; but in order to be good, he has to be
[1:05:58] just also.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; That's what makes him good.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; He's not wishy-washy.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; He's God.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And now God's too good to do that to
[1:06:08] you. And he began said, "Well, you'll be
[1:06:11] wise. You'll have an education. You'll
[1:06:13] be smart and wise. You'll you'll know
[1:06:16] things that you don't know." Now, see,
[1:06:19] she only had to know one thing. That was
[1:06:21] the word.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; We don't have to have a bachelor of art
[1:06:24] and a PhD and a LLD and all these other
[1:06:27] things. Just know God's word. The
[1:06:29] simplest child they can read, you know.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; But reason, what did they get? What did
[1:06:37] they get right there? They broke down
[1:06:39] and Satan know defeated the human race
[1:06:41] right there. And that's where he's
[1:06:43] defeated them ever since. Yeah,
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; that's the reason Amos come because
[1:06:47] popularity and popular opinions and find
[1:06:50] great uh president or king and brought
[1:06:54] prosperity of people or sell their life
[1:06:57] for a mess of beans like Esau.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to hurt, but I'm trying
[1:07:03] to make true.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; You Democrats sold your birthrights not
[1:07:09] long ago.
[1:07:12] That's
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:07:14] And I'm not a Republican. I'm a
[1:07:16] Christian.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Brother, what a disgrace. And had to
[1:07:22] take a crooked machine to vote it in
[1:07:24] like that. But that's what the miracle
[1:07:25] wanted.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; They got it. He usually gives you what
[1:07:30] you want. God, give me your word. That's
[1:07:32] what I want. Let me hide thy word in my
[1:07:34] heart, Lord. I sin not against thee. Oh,
[1:07:38] others reason. But see, Amos couldn't
[1:07:41] reason because he was a prophet. Let the
[1:07:43] word come to him. Now, same as the word
[1:07:47] today, you must interpret it. Let the
[1:07:50] Holy Spirit interpret it by vindicating
[1:07:52] it in your life. That's what was said.
[1:07:54] What you know Jeremiah said to the to
[1:07:57] the prophet Hannah. He said, "When that
[1:07:59] prophet speaks and what he says is
[1:08:00] manifested, then the prophets know he
[1:08:02] was right."
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; If Amos was here, what do you think he
[1:08:07] would do?
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; He would he would stay with the word.
[1:08:11] That's what he would do. Amen.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; You know what? He had tell us that we've
[1:08:17] been taught off of the foundation of the
[1:08:20] original word of God.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; He had tell us that we're far away from
[1:08:25] the first Pentecostal church. That's
[1:08:27] what he tell us. Pentecostals
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; said, "Now, you had almost 50 years to
[1:08:32] get yourself in gear and you've never
[1:08:34] come there yet." Oh,
[1:08:38] what would he say to denominational
[1:08:40] personality? What? Oh, if he wouldn't
[1:08:42] give that, if he wouldn't tear up the
[1:08:44] churches for their immorals for
[1:08:46] accepting creeds, joining a church
[1:08:48] instead of being born into it. Well, if
[1:08:51] you're born into it, brother, sister,
[1:08:53] you act different. You You stay with the
[1:08:55] word. The Holy Spirit's in you. It only
[1:08:57] feeds on the word. Jesus said, "Man
[1:08:59] shall not live by bread alone, but by
[1:09:00] every word,
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; not part of the word, but every word
[1:09:04] that proceedth from the mouth of God."
[1:09:06] He being a prophet, he would see this
[1:09:09] thing in us
[1:09:11] of Amos was a prophet. Now, I'm going to
[1:09:14] close in a minute, but I want to make
[1:09:15] these remarks stick. If I can, I'll say
[1:09:18] it. And the Holy Spirit has to make it
[1:09:19] stick.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you something. If he must
[1:09:23] come here tonight and stood on this
[1:09:25] platform, if he walked up and down the
[1:09:27] streets of Phoenix, he would see in us
[1:09:30] today in our national affair, in our
[1:09:33] church world. He'd see the very thing
[1:09:37] that he saw in Samaria,
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; given holy over to immorals
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; away from the word of God. He'd see a
[1:09:46] very religious group. They were every
[1:09:48] one of them Israelites.
[1:09:51] But he would see an immoral immorality.
[1:09:54] He'd see he'd see social and immoral
[1:09:57] decay among the people. He'd see immoral
[1:10:00] decay among on the nation. He'd see
[1:10:03] immoral decay from the word. He see
[1:10:05] adultery in the church.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not meaning both physical and he see
[1:10:10] spiritual adultery. how they would be
[1:10:13] taking the creeds of man out here as
[1:10:17] man's creeds and accepting them instead
[1:10:22] of the word. That's committing spiritual
[1:10:24] adultery against God.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Revelation 17 says so.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; That the this committed sin
[1:10:33] because with her abomination she made
[1:10:35] the earth drink the wine of her wrath.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, we see it would be allto together
[1:10:40] different. He had see it the immoral
[1:10:43] decay. Amos never blamed the government
[1:10:47] on listen Amos never blame the
[1:10:51] government and all this scripture
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; but he blamed the people for electing
[1:10:57] such a government.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Oh I can Are you tired?
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Just hold on just a minute. See
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; don't blame your government. The
[1:11:09] government cannot build a house on a
[1:11:11] rock that the people votes for sand.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; The people want it.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Many times I say things in the pull pit
[1:11:22] when I know my brethren is sitting out
[1:11:24] there ministers.
[1:11:27] Good man. I talk to him, get him in a
[1:11:29] corner
[1:11:31] and it's my duty knowing these things to
[1:11:34] tell my brethren. And I talk to him and
[1:11:36] say, "Brother Brandon, I know you're
[1:11:38] right.
[1:11:39] But my church will walk out.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; See, it's what you want.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; You can.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; It's the people.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Now, if you think I could start up a
[1:11:52] building down here on the street and
[1:11:54] sell the ladies today those old fashion
[1:11:56] high top lace shoes,
[1:11:59] they probably got more leather in them
[1:12:01] than
[1:12:03] a whole store full has today. One pair
[1:12:06] has.
[1:12:08] But if I sold them for 50 cents a pair,
[1:12:11] I'd starve to death.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Why? You don't want them.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; If I sold those oldfashioned mother
[1:12:19] hubard skirts
[1:12:21] to the women today, you think they'd buy
[1:12:23] them? Certainly not.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; They want something that they can pour
[1:12:27] themselves into. Looks like the skin on
[1:12:30] a wiener. They they just want to be so
[1:12:32] tight walking down the street about four
[1:12:35] or five different degrees.
[1:12:38] pushed in, pushed out, and ran back on a
[1:12:41] pair of heels or head suck out. That's I
[1:12:44] don't mean that for joke.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; This is no place to joke. But that's the
[1:12:48] truth.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; I have not got a good education. That's
[1:12:52] the only way I can make my word know you
[1:12:53] know what I'm talking about.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Now, it's true.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't buy them dresses. The
[1:13:01] other night on the platform, a little
[1:13:02] Indian woman come up there. I wanted to
[1:13:05] shake her little hand up at brother
[1:13:06] groomer's church here where she had a
[1:13:09] dress on like my mother wore. I thought,
[1:13:11] "Well, bless your heart, lady." And the
[1:13:13] Lord healed her right there before she
[1:13:14] even got to me. She thought, I I just
[1:13:17] better keep still. See, just wait till
[1:13:19] the occasion comes sometime. And there
[1:13:22] it was. Well, you couldn't sell those
[1:13:24] dresses. You might sell them to an
[1:13:26] Indian. And not too many of them.
[1:13:29] They're getting just about as loose as
[1:13:30] the rest of them. You got too much
[1:13:32] television programs and your children
[1:13:35] getting out some of these modern white
[1:13:36] school teachers coming in and all this
[1:13:38] other nonsense. You'd be better off he's
[1:13:41] back out like setting bull and was long
[1:13:43] time ago
[1:13:46] in Africa when we had the colored race
[1:13:49] there. What do they do? go to other
[1:13:52] missionaries is reading, writing, and
[1:13:54] arithmetic when you Well, they they know
[1:13:57] more about morals and their tribes than
[1:13:59] you could Christianity could ever bring
[1:14:01] to them.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. If any of those women out
[1:14:05] there, if she in the Zula tribe, if she
[1:14:08] waits to a certain age to get married
[1:14:10] and hasn't someone hasn't taken care of
[1:14:12] her wife, she has to get out of there.
[1:14:14] She's no more a tribesman.
[1:14:17] And when she's married, she's tested for
[1:14:19] her virgin. And if she be found guilty,
[1:14:22] she has to tell the man that's done them
[1:14:23] and they're both killed together.
[1:14:26] Be a lot of killing around here if we
[1:14:27] had that kind of a setup, don't you
[1:14:30] think? That's right.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't have enough undertakers to
[1:14:35] bury the men and women.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Certainly.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; But you're dead anyhow and don't know
[1:14:41] it. So that's a trouble. See, but now so
[1:14:45] much. That's right. Then what do you do?
[1:14:48] They take them over there and teach them
[1:14:50] school. Then you find them on the
[1:14:52] street. They got their own tribal sins.
[1:14:53] What they had to come in, take the white
[1:14:55] man's sins. And then they're 10 times
[1:14:58] more child of hell than it was to start
[1:15:00] with.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; The only thing they need is Christ to
[1:15:03] stay where they're
[1:15:05] right. That's with our American Indian.
[1:15:08] Anybody I feel sorry for in this
[1:15:10] nation's Indian sure had a bad deal out
[1:15:13] of it. I'm not
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; I'm just one person. But I'm far. Yes
[1:15:17] sir.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; The Lord ever calls me from the fields
[1:15:20] of dealing like this and my message is
[1:15:22] over. He lets me live any longer, I'm
[1:15:24] going to the Indians. Yes sir.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. My We see what Amos would do
[1:15:30] when he called out our whole system
[1:15:33] would be condemned. Certainly not. The
[1:15:36] government cannot build. My remark was
[1:15:40] upon a rock that the nation votes for
[1:15:43] sand. Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; How you going to build your church upon
[1:15:47] the rock? How will a preacher ever stand
[1:15:51] in the pull pit and preach the rock and
[1:15:54] build it upon the fundamentals of the
[1:15:56] full gospel when his audience, some of
[1:15:59] his people out there would put him out?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I blame the preacher for not having
[1:16:05] the audacity and the spirit of God for
[1:16:08] just shutting the door and saying,
[1:16:09] "Getting somebody else to stand for that
[1:16:11] stuff and not me." Uh, I admire a
[1:16:14] preacher that would do that. But woe
[1:16:16] onto that congregation when a anointed
[1:16:19] man of God tries to bring them the word
[1:16:21] and then they won't line up with it.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; How's he going to have a a church that
[1:16:28] all the nine gifts operating in it and
[1:16:31] so forth and then they and that and the
[1:16:33] church won't even even live decently and
[1:16:36] morally won't learn their ABCs of the
[1:16:38] gospel. They say, "If I had a better
[1:16:40] preacher, well, it's your fault." That's
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; It's our nation's fault. Our Americans
[1:16:47] that we come over here for freedom of
[1:16:49] religion from what?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; And we go right on back and put into our
[1:16:55] capital the very thing that we're was
[1:16:58] come over here to be free from.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; This nation's a whole lot like Israel.
[1:17:04] They Israel come into Palestine, drove
[1:17:07] out the occupants and took the land. The
[1:17:10] first they had some good good man over
[1:17:12] them. They had David and Solomon, a
[1:17:15] great man. Finally, after a while, they
[1:17:17] kept voting in and pushing in and
[1:17:19] letting in till they got a Ahab down
[1:17:21] there
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; that married a heathen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Now, Ahab was a pretty good fellow.
[1:17:27] He wanted to do right, but he couldn't
[1:17:29] do right for that woman of his. Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; I ain't got nothing against the man I
[1:17:34] was speaking about a few minutes ago. He
[1:17:36] might be a good man, but it's that
[1:17:38] system of that harlot behind him that
[1:17:41] twist his neck.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; That's the thing he's going to do it.
[1:17:44] Come in like this as easy as he can like
[1:17:47] that and flash the whole thing down. Did
[1:17:49] you know we are we are now our national
[1:17:53] debt is so great until we're paying on
[1:17:57] barred money off of taxes that we'll get
[1:18:00] 14 years from today.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; What's going to happen when this system
[1:18:04] breaks?
[1:18:06] Castro, sure I'm against him. He's a
[1:18:09] communist,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; right? I'm against him. But he done a
[1:18:12] good thing when he changed the currency
[1:18:13] and sent the gold back. Bought up the
[1:18:15] bonds and sent the gold back. We'll have
[1:18:17] to do that or the one thing stuck in our
[1:18:20] face that is that the Catholic Church
[1:18:23] owns the wealth of the world. She's got
[1:18:25] the money. She's got the gold to buy our
[1:18:27] bonds back again.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Exactly. And you think these whiskey
[1:18:31] dealers, the tobaca dealers and great uh
[1:18:34] people of the country won't sell out to
[1:18:37] keep from losing all their business and
[1:18:38] counterfeiting the currency. They'll go
[1:18:40] right back and take that money from the
[1:18:42] Catholic Church. And then she's sold.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Don't the Bible predict that?
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; The wealth of the world. I'm not a
[1:18:52] politician, neither a smart man. But I
[1:18:55] thank the Lord I know him.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; And that's right. That's where she's
[1:18:59] going to lay right there. You watch it.
[1:19:01] You watch and see if that ain't right. I
[1:19:04] hope we all live to see it. I don't
[1:19:06] think we'll have to live too long. But
[1:19:08] how you going to do? How we going to
[1:19:10] build a church? How we going to build a
[1:19:11] nation? How are we going to build a
[1:19:13] nation upon this? Now,
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; what are we going to do about it? Maybe
[1:19:16] I better shut up.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Go somewhere else. But you know, I said
[1:19:20] enough. You know what I'm talking about.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Look what we want.
[1:19:26] You You see what you want, that's what
[1:19:29] you get.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; That's your desires. Look at our
[1:19:32] television programs today. Uncensored.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Used to be as wrong for our children. We
[1:19:37] would let them go down in the the city
[1:19:40] and see the biccopes, the the picture
[1:19:42] shows. That's right.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; But now the devil turned right right
[1:19:45] back around and and made it a television
[1:19:47] and set it in every house.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; That'll be all right. The television's
[1:19:52] all right if you got the right thing on
[1:19:54] it.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Certainly is. But what do you do? It's
[1:19:57] getting rotten by the hour.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Using God's name swearing, cursing
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; naked women immoral acts
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; and poison the mind of these children.
[1:20:09] So we raised up a bunch of beats.
[1:20:13] That's right. Hoodlams.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; It's exactly the truth. You might as
[1:20:17] well look at it.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Our whole nation is turning to a bunch
[1:20:22] of hoodlams.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Any boy walk around with his britches
[1:20:27] hanging off his hips and head hanging
[1:20:29] back, his hair hanging down his neck
[1:20:30] like a Miss Kennedy's waterhead haircut
[1:20:34] and going around like that as a hoodlm
[1:20:37] and then called that American. You've
[1:20:39] fallen from grace. Repent and turn back
[1:20:42] to God or you'll perish.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; That's the reason we we want to get
[1:20:49] somebody in here to let us do anything
[1:20:50] we want to.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's the way the
[1:20:53] churches. They want to elect in a
[1:20:54] pastor. Not a pastor that'll stand there
[1:20:56] and beat the gospel to them, but they
[1:20:58] want somebody to let them stretch
[1:21:00] themselves in a bathing suit and play
[1:21:02] bunk hole in the basement and live any
[1:21:04] way they want to. Television programs of
[1:21:06] uncensored radio nast.
[1:21:10] joining church in the world together. No
[1:21:13] wonder he aimless to scream out against
[1:21:15] that stuff.
[1:21:17] [Applause]
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; You think the people would receive him
[1:21:19] when they voting the thing right in
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; if the pastor preaches over 20 minutes,
[1:21:24] the trustee board calls him over into
[1:21:26] the room and said, "Look at here,
[1:21:27] pastor. We we didn't bring you here to
[1:21:29] do something like that. We have 20
[1:21:31] minutes program and that's over. Let her
[1:21:33] go."
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. What he needs to do is
[1:21:35] kick that bunch of trustees out the door
[1:21:37] and take the Bible and preach all night
[1:21:39] like Paul did and see the resurrection
[1:21:41] of the dead.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Exactly. They put him out of the
[1:21:46] building, the street corners. All right.
[1:21:48] God's with these stones.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Television uncensored picture shows dirt
[1:21:54] filth and makes an example. Look at our
[1:21:57] young kids today.
[1:22:00] Look at our girls.
[1:22:02] See little bitty fellas coming from
[1:22:04] school not over six years old, seven,
[1:22:06] eight, lighting up cigarettes.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Why is it they're mammy before him
[1:22:11] probably done it?
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; If he didn't do it then some of the kids
[1:22:14] are associating with watch who your kids
[1:22:17] play with
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; right
[1:22:21] some time ago wife knows it. We're
[1:22:23] sitting at the table and my little
[1:22:25] Joseph let out a word that would make a
[1:22:26] drunken sailor ashamed of himself. I
[1:22:29] turned around. I said, "What's that?"
[1:22:30] And the mother faded. The little fellow
[1:22:33] looked innocent. He said, "What's the
[1:22:35] matter, Dad?" Big tears in his eyes. I
[1:22:37] said, "Don't you never say a thing like
[1:22:39] that." He didn't know what it's all
[1:22:41] about. Come to find out, the kids at
[1:22:44] school was using that dirty word.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; I said, "Honey, that's of the devil."
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; See, there you are. Your kids, it just
[1:22:53] got into a place, brother, to it's just
[1:22:55] doggy dog.
[1:22:57] That's right.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Such a conglomeration of sin.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; television programs, sin lovers,
[1:23:05] pleasure lovers.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my. 20 minutes is long enough. I've
[1:23:09] got to see the late show. See, hurry up
[1:23:12] and get this out of here. I got to do
[1:23:14] this. See, they've done their religion.
[1:23:16] They went down there and that's enough.
[1:23:18] But I tell you, a real man or woman
[1:23:20] that's born of the spirit of God will
[1:23:22] sit hour after hour drinking in the word
[1:23:24] of God. Not only that, but when it hits
[1:23:27] there, it anchors and changes a lot.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; It's our people's desires. Our whole
[1:23:35] setup is corrupted in decay. It's our
[1:23:38] people's wants. You take a good man. So,
[1:23:41] like a good man, put him in a family
[1:23:43] that's a bunch of of pleasure lovers,
[1:23:47] they leave that man a dog's life.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Or a good woman ain't the one. Put him
[1:23:51] in a family that's mixed up. The whole
[1:23:54] family should surrender to God.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; It's our business to pray to our
[1:23:58] children are saved. Keep our house in
[1:24:01] order.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we are something like Israel did
[1:24:06] made an alliance with their enemies.
[1:24:08] First, they had to get away from the
[1:24:11] word before they could do that.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; And it just goes to show how far America
[1:24:15] has gotten away from the word.
[1:24:19] You know, you you have to deny the truth
[1:24:22] before you can believe a lie.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Eve first had to deny God's
[1:24:29] word before she could take Satan's lie.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; They had to get away from the word then.
[1:24:34] Same now, letting Rome take over without
[1:24:38] firing a shot.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; They don't know the word of God about
[1:24:42] these things. That's what the trouble
[1:24:44] is.
[1:24:45] We need a rising of a true prophet.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Bring us back to the word. That's right.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; We're promised one.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; We're promised that.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, indeed. Malachi 4 said he wouldn't
[1:24:57] need to restore the faith of the people
[1:24:58] back to them Pentecostal fathers again.
[1:25:02] Amos knew that Israel's ungodly lovers
[1:25:06] would someday destroy her. Now, let me
[1:25:09] say this with reverence.
[1:25:11] So does a believer today know that the
[1:25:14] world, this America's ungodly lovers is
[1:25:16] going to destroy.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Your love of politics.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; I just let that anchor a minute.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; That'll destroy the nation.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And your love of the world, not coming
[1:25:30] up with the word and trying to do what's
[1:25:32] right will destroy the church.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. I hope that's gone.
[1:25:39] The church had left. He left his word of
[1:25:41] life. The whole world stumbles at it
[1:25:44] like a stumbling block. They do the same
[1:25:46] thing today. Yes. If Amos would share
[1:25:49] it, he'd cry against the whole system.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:26:06] And I can surely say that we've received
[1:26:09] one like Amos in the same time.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; You know, it's amazing because
[1:26:16] you can only receive this if it came
[1:26:19] from a prophet. Only a prophet will have
[1:26:22] this type of eyesight to tell you what's
[1:26:24] really happening.
[1:26:26] You know the scripture will say it was
[1:26:27] by a prophet that Israel was taken out
[1:26:31] of Egypt and it was by a prophet that
[1:26:33] Israel was kept. And it's so important
[1:26:36] that
[1:26:38] we as believers of the message, we never
[1:26:41] move away from what the prophet is
[1:26:43] saying
[1:26:45] because it's human nature that in every
[1:26:48] generation
[1:26:50] even when the word was sent that people
[1:26:52] will move away from that word because
[1:26:54] they will take it and mix it with other
[1:26:56] things and it will take a prophet to
[1:26:58] come and see the condition and point
[1:27:01] people right back to the word.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; I I love it. I think we heard it this
[1:27:05] morning. It said, "Israel, I got you as
[1:27:07] a little girl that was out on the field.
[1:27:10] I cleaned you up. I gave you land you
[1:27:12] never deserved. I gave you food that was
[1:27:15] not yours. I I I think it's if you go
[1:27:18] listen to a message, I believe uh um
[1:27:23] um
[1:27:26] what is this message? Uh
[1:27:28] no, not this one. This there's about
[1:27:31] three or four that he talks about Amos.
[1:27:34] um uh when somebody's gotten dull of
[1:27:38] hearing
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; amnesia spiritual amnesia and he talks
[1:27:41] about the same thing saying how did he
[1:27:43] got us out of all of those things but
[1:27:46] yet the people that he got out went
[1:27:48] right back into the things that they
[1:27:50] were brought out from
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; where they were supposed to be led by
[1:27:53] the word and it was supposed Satan came
[1:27:55] and introduced reasoning and introduced
[1:27:58] well there's nothing wrong with this and
[1:28:00] you know yeah we are Christians they are
[1:28:02] Christians too we can mix. No, we're not
[1:28:04] called to mix with the world.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; And and I love that he just made this
[1:28:08] point and it just touches my heart. It
[1:28:11] said it's the people that's causing the
[1:28:13] things to happen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; So it's not the preacher, it's the
[1:28:18] people. The preachers preach what people
[1:28:20] are looking for.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Now that's another problem we're going
[1:28:24] to talk.
[1:28:26] But first is the people.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; And and I want to say this. I was
[1:28:31] talking about the Paul in the office.
[1:28:34] It it wouldn't help for somebody to come
[1:28:37] here day in and day out, talk about how
[1:28:39] we are predestinated,
[1:28:41] chosen, elected, and we got the land and
[1:28:46] still live in sin.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Still cannot overcome. Still turning in
[1:28:51] circles. Still don't see the product
[1:28:54] over any of that.
[1:28:56] That's right.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, but yet, you know, we jump
[1:29:01] around. Praise God. I was be in the
[1:29:04] beginning with him. If you were in the
[1:29:06] beginning with him, you will manifest
[1:29:08] something that will show that you were
[1:29:10] with him.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Sorry,
[1:29:19] I need to change the posture.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; But that that's really true. That's it's
[1:29:25] really our own problem. It he says
[1:29:28] politics it's what people people elected
[1:29:30] those those people and they went and
[1:29:32] they did exactly what those people
[1:29:35] elected them for.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; People want a watered down religion a
[1:29:40] gospel that doesn't really cut deep. You
[1:29:43] know something that even when you are in
[1:29:45] sin you still feel good about yourself.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; That's not this message. Amen.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; You if you are in sin, you should feel
[1:29:54] terrible.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; If you living in sin, you should feel
[1:29:59] terrible. We can't come and and and and
[1:30:01] and you know, pet you up and says, "Oh,
[1:30:04] you are fine. You No, you need to get
[1:30:07] out of that and be saved."
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's what our pastor is
[1:30:13] trying. I It's not It's just a hard to
[1:30:16] see what what we have received. One that
[1:30:19] can remember the prophet is one that can
[1:30:21] see before we can get to the corner. He
[1:30:23] can see a far off and he can see the
[1:30:26] condition and warn you and say don't go
[1:30:28] in that direction.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; If you see what people have made of this
[1:30:32] message, things that are happening in
[1:30:35] the name of the message, all kinds of
[1:30:37] thing you're like this cannot be what
[1:30:39] the prophet preached.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; You you couldn't tell a believer from an
[1:30:47] a an unbeliever today.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; The the churches, you couldn't take a
[1:30:55] picture of a message church and take a
[1:30:58] picture of a Pentecostal church and tell
[1:31:00] them apart.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; It's what people wanted.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; They wanted a king. They wanted someone
[1:31:09] when Moses took too long. They wanted
[1:31:12] something that they could worship,
[1:31:13] something that they can contribute,
[1:31:15] something that they felt they part of.
[1:31:17] and and all of that. And I want to say
[1:31:19] this, even as a preacher, it's very
[1:31:22] important that we don't do this for the
[1:31:24] people. It's important that everyone,
[1:31:26] preachers, believers, everybody, we are
[1:31:28] behind what the prophet said. I love
[1:31:31] what our pastor said. What I love, one
[1:31:32] of the things I love about brother David
[1:31:34] is I can bring a quote, I can bring and
[1:31:37] say, look at the prophet and we are in
[1:31:39] agreement.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; He loved it. When you show him, oh, look
[1:31:44] at what the prophet say here. Why?
[1:31:45] Because we are all guided by one thing
[1:31:47] and that's the message at the hour.
[1:31:49] There's no big guy, no little you. We
[1:31:51] all trying to make it to the kingdom.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; But oh my,
[1:32:01] Satan just knows how to slip in.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; God loves you. He's not I mean, he
[1:32:08] didn't predestinate you so he can lose
[1:32:10] you. That means stay in sin.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; That's not the message of the hour.
[1:32:16] predestination is got to come into
[1:32:19] manifestation.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this, this is not said
[1:32:25] so we can go, well, oh, I need to go
[1:32:28] throw out my television and do this.
[1:32:30] Yeah, you need to go do that first, but
[1:32:32] most of all, you need the new birth into
[1:32:36] your heart. That's where it start. You
[1:32:38] will throw that television, you will buy
[1:32:40] another one. But if you really have a
[1:32:42] true conversion in your heart, what the
[1:32:45] word speaks and it speaks to your heart,
[1:32:47] then when you kick it out, you won't put
[1:32:49] it back in. Why? Because there's been a
[1:32:51] change.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; That's the way forward.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I don't want in my heart there
[1:33:01] be any semblance of sin or something
[1:33:04] that loves and I want when I see sin, my
[1:33:07] head turned. I want when I see this, I
[1:33:09] want to have that same kind of just love
[1:33:13] for the love of God, for the word of God
[1:33:15] that the believers in the beginning had.
[1:33:17] Let me say that has never changed.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; They sold everything so they can follow
[1:33:23] the word.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Now we take the word, we mix it up with
[1:33:27] other things. We take, we mix it up. We
[1:33:30] take, we mix it up. We are I mean we are
[1:33:33] all predestinated so it won't matter.
[1:33:35] They were predestinated for the promised
[1:33:38] land, but only two made it.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; It wasn't God. God God couldn't get them
[1:33:46] out of Egypt with with with not enough
[1:33:50] provision for them to desire or to get
[1:33:53] to a place where something that they
[1:33:55] needed to get to the promised land was
[1:33:57] lived in Egypt.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; God provided the prophet. He provided
[1:34:02] the pillar of fire. He provided
[1:34:05] everything that they needed on the way
[1:34:07] to the promised land. But guess what? In
[1:34:10] their hearts, they still desired the
[1:34:12] things of the world.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; They still desire some of the things
[1:34:15] that we need. I couldn't even believe
[1:34:18] how they were whitewashing it to say,
[1:34:20] "Oh, the onions." They forgot that they
[1:34:22] were dying there.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; They forgot that they the one that cried
[1:34:26] out for God to take him out.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; If we not careful, we'll find ourselves
[1:34:31] in the same situation. Oh, God is
[1:34:33] getting me out of sin. But you know, I
[1:34:35] just love that tune. You know, that
[1:34:38] music, it just attract my ear. And and
[1:34:40] it's just this. No, we need to be a
[1:34:43] people separated,
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; separated from the world,
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; if it's of the world, we don't want
[1:34:50] nothing to do with it.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; And it's with that kind of heart, that's
[1:34:56] when God can speak to us. Back to the
[1:34:59] word, back to drinking. When we drink of
[1:35:02] the word, we become the word. When we
[1:35:04] eat the word, we become. The only time
[1:35:06] we hear it cannot be when somebody else
[1:35:08] is playing. We And I was fellowshipping
[1:35:11] with the brother. I said, "You here is
[1:35:13] where and I I look even in my own last.
[1:35:16] I said this is where we fell short." The
[1:35:18] the the importance of eating and
[1:35:21] drinking the message is that the more
[1:35:24] you eat of it, the more you drink of it,
[1:35:26] your language will change. Your mind
[1:35:29] will change. Your approach will change.
[1:35:31] Your view will change.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; You will speak it's the message come
[1:35:36] out. You will think it's the message
[1:35:38] come out. But if you're not in it, how
[1:35:40] is it going to come out?
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Only humanity, flesh will come out.
[1:35:47] But it's not done so we can say oh this
[1:35:50] is no it's because whatever you expose
[1:35:53] yourself to you become that.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Have you ever talked to somebody I mean
[1:36:03] all they talk it's just two seconds
[1:36:06] before even the sentence formulation.
[1:36:08] Why is it? Because they are so much into
[1:36:11] it that they've become the very thing
[1:36:14] and that's the heart's the desire. We
[1:36:16] could say like David, I want to look at
[1:36:18] you until I become even like you.
[1:36:25] And I want to say this, it's not an easy
[1:36:27] road. I think we've painted it like a
[1:36:29] rosy road where you just glide and
[1:36:32] you're going to get to the finish line.
[1:36:34] No, it's a daily battle to separate.
[1:36:38] It's a daily battle, Lord. I don't want
[1:36:40] this. I don't want that. It's a daily
[1:36:43] decision making to walk away from the
[1:36:46] things of It's every day. Lord, I don't
[1:36:48] want to make a bad choice. I don't want
[1:36:50] to I made one yesterday that was not
[1:36:52] good. I'm separating myself today. You
[1:36:54] have to constantly guard your heart
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; because says what? The devil has got
[1:36:59] that punch coming. But how are you going
[1:37:01] to be protected if there's no word in
[1:37:03] it?
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; And I really think it's that it's we we
[1:37:12] getting to where the the the way to
[1:37:14] destruction is getting bigger and bigger
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; and many are being swallowed up in the
[1:37:20] name of the message. You you you should
[1:37:23] see even some of those meetings that
[1:37:25] brother David is referring to and you
[1:37:27] look at it you say I don't recognize
[1:37:30] this over anything of the message.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; You couldn't take that and and play a
[1:37:35] tape in such environment. It wouldn't
[1:37:37] mix.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; But we call it the message.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; The word is preached. Even I believe
[1:37:44] what our pastor was saying this morning.
[1:37:46] The word is preached. And the next guy
[1:37:48] who comes up and say, "Now we're going
[1:37:51] to turn to dancing."
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; No, no conviction that the word just
[1:37:56] went forth, God, let the word that was
[1:37:58] spoken in my heart and let it produce
[1:38:00] what you really want out of my life. Let
[1:38:03] me be what I just heard, Lord. Let it
[1:38:05] let it change my life. Let the part of
[1:38:07] me that's still not of you, let it be
[1:38:09] change. No. Right after that, it's a
[1:38:11] tune out. It's a different channel.
[1:38:18] And I want to say this, if the word of
[1:38:19] God has no effect upon your heart, you
[1:38:22] better watch out
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; because it's the only form of
[1:38:27] transformation that's provided to the
[1:38:29] believer is that you hear the word
[1:38:32] change come. You hear the word change
[1:38:35] come. If you tune it out, if you are not
[1:38:38] in that channel of the it's music is not
[1:38:40] going to change you.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. entertainment is going to not
[1:38:44] change you. It's only one provided way
[1:38:47] to the change and that is you hear the
[1:38:50] word. Remember the prophet said the Holy
[1:38:52] Spirit is there to only vindicate the
[1:38:55] word.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Not your thinking, not your ideas, not
[1:39:01] what you think the word is supposed to
[1:39:02] be. No, only what the messenger spoke.
[1:39:06] Only what God has given.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; You go outside of that. You go on your
[1:39:11] own.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:13] is not respect of persons.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; It's only respect of one thing. And if
[1:39:17] we claim we have the message, it has to
[1:39:19] produce the same thing that it produced
[1:39:21] on the day of Pentecost. And that is
[1:39:23] life that are changed.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm not speaking this in I'm looking
[1:39:28] even to my own self. We can't claim. We
[1:39:31] have so much knowledge but very little
[1:39:33] reality of life.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; But we can't keep walking that way. We
[1:39:40] have to stand up and do our own
[1:39:42] examination and say, "Lord, where am I?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; What's happening within my own life? I I
[1:39:47] have heard and I've heard. I've heard
[1:39:49] I've heard. I want transformation. I
[1:39:52] want somehow what's spoken and what I
[1:39:55] see to match.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Somewhere they got to match. And that's
[1:39:59] where I need to be. Wherever that is, I
[1:40:01] want to get there so I can see the
[1:40:03] transformation."
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; If the musician could come. Sorry, I
[1:40:09] didn't
[1:40:11] just speaking for my own heart and
[1:40:14] because that's really what we can and I
[1:40:15] think even the comment that was made
[1:40:17] about clapping, it's not it's because if
[1:40:19] you use it just as a form of
[1:40:21] disconnecting with what's spoken,
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; it's not going to help you.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; It's not in malice. It's it's it's
[1:40:30] almost a form of okay, you disconnecting
[1:40:33] with what's about. No. When the word is
[1:40:35] preached, what comes after is actually
[1:40:38] true worship is you saying, "Oh Lord, I
[1:40:40] just heard your word. I want what I just
[1:40:43] heard to change my heart right now." So
[1:40:45] we need it's a deepest of sincerity that
[1:40:48] continues. It's not a cut off so we can
[1:40:50] now do something else. No, it's the
[1:40:52] continuation of what we just heard. So
[1:40:55] he can really touch our heart and change
[1:40:57] us because the Holy Spirit that just
[1:40:59] spoke through the pastor, he now has to
[1:41:02] come and make that word true. It's not
[1:41:04] you making the word true. It's him
[1:41:06] making the word true. All we need to do
[1:41:08] is just willing vessel believers and
[1:41:11] say, "Lord, if it cuts me, I want to
[1:41:13] take it. If it bruises me, I want to
[1:41:15] take it because I know one thing that I
[1:41:18] cannot make it by myself. You have to do
[1:41:20] it.
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; If you don't do it, I'm lost."
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. People don't realize
[1:41:30] that without the prophet they are lost.
[1:41:33] They think they got something to do that
[1:41:36] they can make or interpret what the
[1:41:38] prophet say and make it to the end. They
[1:41:40] are no other interpretation except what
[1:41:43] Amos spoke.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; He's the only voice and he's the only
[1:41:48] one who's the interpreter of the divine
[1:41:51] word of God. And it's only when we walk
[1:41:53] by what he spoke that's how we're going
[1:41:56] to make it.
[1:41:58] Let's all stand.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; May I just want each one and personally
[1:42:06] and to just look within our heart and
[1:42:08] say Lord what is it that we really want?
[1:42:11] Let me say this and even time many times
[1:42:14] we say the heart the scripture says the
[1:42:16] heart is a very deceitful thing.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; You got to line up your heart with the
[1:42:21] word of God. You don't just don't want
[1:42:23] any kind of heart or or just something
[1:42:26] that will just tinkle the heart. Oh, it
[1:42:28] makes me feel good. No, I want my heart
[1:42:31] what I call to be my heart to be in line
[1:42:33] with the word of God. Not just something
[1:42:35] that will cause me to or or either cry.
[1:42:38] There's nothing wrong with that. That
[1:42:40] will cause me to be happy. There's
[1:42:42] nothing wrong with that. But is it in
[1:42:44] line with what he has spoken? If it is,
[1:42:46] then that's the kind of heart I want. If
[1:42:48] that's not the kind of heart in me, then
[1:42:51] God, take that heart out of me. You said
[1:42:54] you will take this stony heart out. You
[1:42:56] said you will give me a heart of flesh.
[1:42:59] You said you will give me a new spirit.
[1:43:01] And then you promise on top of that you
[1:43:03] will put your Holy Spirit into my
[1:43:05] spirit. That's what I desire. Then that
[1:43:08] way I'm in line with what you said. You
[1:43:10] speak it, I believe it, and it produces
[1:43:13] the result. That's the kind of
[1:43:15] Christianity we want. Not one that's
[1:43:17] babyed and you know oh you know just go
[1:43:20] it's the original kind of believers
[1:43:23] those that walk with God. We're
[1:43:25] fellowshipping with brother Mike
[1:43:27] yesterday we all you know but David came
[1:43:29] around here how that it's so important
[1:43:31] but one of them said he said even the
[1:43:34] experiences of yesterday it's not good
[1:43:36] enough.
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; You have to have a brand new experience
[1:43:41] every day with God. Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; You can't, oh I when I was saved, it was
[1:43:46] like this. If what was back then is
[1:43:49] different from what's today. If it's no
[1:43:51] more today, then there's something
[1:43:53] wrong.
[1:43:54] When you advance, it gets better. When
[1:43:57] you advance, it gets deeper. When you
[1:44:00] advance, it changes you more and more.
[1:44:02] We don't want to go back. We want to go
[1:44:04] forward.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; And the only way forward is more of him
[1:44:08] and less of us.
[1:44:15] But it won't happen if the people don't
[1:44:17] want it.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; It won't happen if people want something
[1:44:22] else.
[1:44:23] That really struck me tonight. I I'll be
[1:44:25] honest.
[1:44:27] It won't happen if our hearts are on
[1:44:30] something else that's not the word of
[1:44:32] God.
[1:44:34] It won't happen if we just strolling
[1:44:37] into the morning and say, "Preacher,
[1:44:39] make me happy.
[1:44:42] It won't happen if the desire is just
[1:44:44] well I have my hour and a half to come
[1:44:47] to church and go home.
[1:44:51] It will only happen if we come together
[1:44:53] and say Lord what do you have in store
[1:44:55] for us today? Lord we are here for you.
[1:44:59] We can say like Peter said and neon say
[1:45:01] Lord I have no idea what you're saying
[1:45:04] but one thing I know you have the words
[1:45:06] of eternal life. You are the way. You
[1:45:09] are the truth and you are the life. When
[1:45:11] you speak, you speak life. Therefore, I
[1:45:14] will take even if it cuts me open. Let
[1:45:17] me say this. We don't want to just
[1:45:19] scroll in and you know, you know, you
[1:45:21] know how people go, oh, I'm offended.
[1:45:24] Offended by what? If the word speaks, it
[1:45:26] will offend. It's for the good of us.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:36] Only a child of God can take correction.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; One who's not a child, you know, they
[1:45:42] feel like they've got it, you know,
[1:45:44] they've got it all made and I speak with
[1:45:47] God directly. If you speak to God
[1:45:49] directly and it's contrary to the
[1:45:51] message, you don't even speak to him.
[1:45:54] You're speaking to somebody else.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; I better stop.
[1:46:01] Let's just examine ourselves and tell,
[1:46:03] "Oh, Lord, what's in my heart?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; If what's in my heart is not yours, take
[1:46:08] it out, Lord. I I I what whatever it
[1:46:11] takes, Lord, I want to be there. I want
[1:46:14] that love to be in my heart, the love
[1:46:16] for your word and the love, whatever it
[1:46:18] takes, if it's to break me apart, if
[1:46:20] it's to tear me into limbs, but I know
[1:46:23] that once you've done doing what you're
[1:46:25] doing, you've made me into what you want
[1:46:27] me to be. I don't want to be a stuff up
[1:46:29] and intellectual believers that just
[1:46:32] here and my heads gets keep getting
[1:46:34] bigger and the like there's no life in
[1:46:36] me. No, I want whatever you want for me
[1:46:39] to change me until I become in that very
[1:46:42] image. And I know it's not an easy road,
[1:46:44] but whatever you have chosen, that's
[1:46:46] what I desire. Let's just sing that and
[1:46:50] hallelujah.
[1:46:53] Oh, glorious victory.
[1:46:57] Oh, I've he
[1:47:02] willing and even my heart.
[1:47:08] Oh, his favorite
[1:47:13] with my life is no longer
[1:47:17] [Music]
[1:47:20] of the Lord.
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:24] Oh,
[1:47:25] [Music]
[1:47:32] hallelujah.
[1:47:34] Oh,
[1:47:41] I am
[1:47:44] [Music]
[1:47:46] I can see
[1:47:50] who
[1:47:51] I am.
[1:47:55] Oh,
[1:48:01] a part of his word.
[1:48:05] Oh, and it's forever
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:12] who I am.
[1:48:16] Oh,
[1:48:17] [Music]
[1:48:22] enter it in his heart.
[1:48:26] We thank you
[1:48:30] king.
[1:48:32] Oh, he came my savior.
[1:48:38] This is God's great
[1:48:41] sweet
[1:48:43] of love expressed to me. Oh, I
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:49:01] am
[1:49:05] I am
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:10] I can't see.
[1:49:14] Oh
[1:49:16] my
[1:49:20] part of my sior
[1:49:26] part of his word
[1:49:31] into revelation
[1:49:36] of who I am.
[1:49:40] Hallelujah. Why don't you just take a
[1:49:42] minute and speak to him and just
[1:49:45] yourself from your own language, from
[1:49:47] your own mouth and just say, "Lord, what
[1:49:50] we heard this morning and what we heard
[1:49:52] tonight, Father, we desire to become
[1:49:55] that church and that perfect church.
[1:49:57] Even as our brother said, let us move on
[1:50:00] to perfection,
[1:50:01] Lord. Perfection is yourself, Lord. And
[1:50:04] if you called us to be a bride, we need
[1:50:06] to move into that mature manifestation
[1:50:09] and leave everything else behind." and
[1:50:11] and Father, we desire to be that in
[1:50:13] every aspect of our lives. And and
[1:50:16] Father, we don't want to carry an 11 or
[1:50:19] anything that would produce something
[1:50:21] that's not that's not what you called.
[1:50:23] And let the devil introduce things that
[1:50:26] are not of you. But father, we've
[1:50:28] received a vindicated prophet who showed
[1:50:30] us the way and that we can take the way
[1:50:33] of a true prophet and that is to remain
[1:50:35] with the word of God and to stay with
[1:50:37] the word and preach the word because the
[1:50:40] only thing that will produce the results
[1:50:41] that God is looking for is the true word
[1:50:44] of God that we may remove everything
[1:50:46] that's not of us and anything that's not
[1:50:49] of you, anything that's human and
[1:50:52] anything that's human understanding,
[1:50:54] human leadership, human works And father
[1:50:57] that we may be committed to your word
[1:51:00] 100% and that it will produce what you
[1:51:03] want us to produce Lord. And father that
[1:51:05] the things of the world father even as
[1:51:08] they come against us that we may look
[1:51:10] away to you Lord and not let those
[1:51:12] things influence us and even when we are
[1:51:15] influenced that we would go back to the
[1:51:17] word and remove of all of those things
[1:51:20] that are not of you and let the pure
[1:51:22] word of God be manifested in our lives.
[1:51:25] Father, that's what we desire tonight.
[1:51:27] And we pray that you just lifted our
[1:51:29] heart, oh God, and look at our heart and
[1:51:31] help us, Lord, and where we have fallen
[1:51:34] short, Father. That we'll be those that
[1:51:36] could actually be corrected when we
[1:51:38] hear, Lord. That there will be those
[1:51:39] that will look deep and and Father, to
[1:51:42] know the message until we become the
[1:51:44] very message, oh God.
[1:51:46] that we may father look to you and and
[1:51:49] let the word of God every part of it
[1:51:52] father even as your prophet say this
[1:51:54] morning that he would look a section and
[1:51:56] say oh this is not that important every
[1:51:59] word of that you have spoken is
[1:52:01] important every tit every bit of it is
[1:52:04] important why because it all ends up
[1:52:06] into what you want us to be but he's
[1:52:09] always there oh the father trying to
[1:52:11] keep our attention to something else and
[1:52:13] remove and to water down and to do all
[1:52:16] of that. But we desire tonight, Lord,
[1:52:18] that we may receive the fullness of who
[1:52:21] you are, the fullness of what you have
[1:52:23] spoken, Father, that we may not let down
[1:52:25] our bars. It don't matter what it is.
[1:52:28] And that we may stand firm and stand at
[1:52:30] the gate, Lord, to face the enemy with
[1:52:33] the full word of God within our hands.
[1:52:35] We ask this, Lord. This is our heart.
[1:52:37] And we ask it in the name of the Lord
[1:52:39] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:52:43] Amen.
[1:52:45] Key of F. Amen.
[1:52:48] Oh, and the fire
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:53] real
[1:52:57] and walking holy
[1:53:01] and upright. Keep the flag.
[1:53:07] I want to keep that flag flying high
[1:53:12] with a mighty living.
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:19] Oh, and the fire and the
[1:53:24] Oh, and a real true life. Oh, and a
[1:53:30] walking glory.
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:35] Oh, keep the flag.
[1:53:41] Oh, I find
[1:53:45] Oh, by
[1:53:47] me. Oh,
[1:53:50] help me sing that first.
[1:53:53] Oh, in this world of compromise
[1:53:58] standing in the making
[1:54:05] to our moral accord
[1:54:09] whereby
[1:54:10] in the midst of all the sin all we have
[1:54:15] heard deep within God wants display.
[1:54:21] No matter what the call. Oh, and I know
[1:54:29] I'm the final re.
[1:54:34] Oh, I'm walking home.
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:40] Oh, keep the flag.
[1:54:44] Oh, keep the flag of my heart.
[1:54:50] Nobody living clean
[1:54:55] and undefiled.
[1:54:59] And when we walk down the street and the
[1:55:04] people that we meet, we see we keep the
[1:55:09] sword of we
[1:55:15] temptation
[1:55:17] drawing near. Let's run to the evil
[1:55:22] snakes for our bodies
[1:55:26] of the temple of the glorified.
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:38] Hallelujah.
[1:55:41] I want to walk holy and
[1:55:45] walk in the flesh.
[1:55:49] Oh, keep the flag on fire.
[1:55:57] Halleluah.
[1:56:00] Oh,
[1:56:02] and the father.
[1:56:05] Oh, and the final re
[1:56:11] and walk in.
[1:56:17] Walk the flag.
[1:56:21] Oh, keep the flag of my hand.
[1:56:27] Oh my
[1:56:31] go.
[1:56:34] Hallelujah.
[1:56:36] Amen. Brother Tim, if you could just
[1:56:37] come and dismiss us tonight.
[1:56:48] Amen.
[1:56:51] Amen. Don't you just love Sunday nights?
[1:57:00] Amen.
[1:57:05] I think it's wonderful. We get prepared
[1:57:07] and let it just soak in.
[1:57:12] Sometimes we don't reflect on it. When
[1:57:14] the word comes hard, comes fast. We just
[1:57:17] let the the water run off.
[1:57:21] But let's take the time and meditate on
[1:57:23] what's been said.
[1:57:30] I don't know how it works.
[1:57:33] But I was reading Amos this morning
[1:57:36] before church started.
[1:57:38] I started out in Isaiah. I think we
[1:57:41] ought to be fortified by the word of
[1:57:42] God.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; And I was reading and refreshing just
[1:57:53] memory skills or whatever you benefit
[1:57:55] from the word of God. Isaiah 42:9
[1:57:59] says, "Behold, the former things have
[1:58:02] come to pass. New things do do I
[1:58:04] declare. Before they spring forth, I
[1:58:06] tell you of them." So immediately I
[1:58:10] reflect on Amos 3:7. It says, "Surely
[1:58:14] the Lord God would do nothing except it
[1:58:16] reveals to his servants the prophets."
[1:58:18] So then you start reading back ahead of
[1:58:20] that. Can two walk together unless they
[1:58:23] be agreed? You continue on.
[1:58:28] And I received it as a warning.
[1:58:32] Amos says,
[1:58:34] "Shall the trumpet be blown in the city
[1:58:37] and the people not be afraid."
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Davis told us this morning,
[1:58:45] you'll be judged by what he spoke this
[1:58:48] morning. We know we'd be judged by the
[1:58:50] prophet's message, but these minister
[1:58:53] brethrens, they're representatives of
[1:58:54] that same message.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; If we had the reverence to realize every
[1:58:58] time we come in these doors,
[1:59:01] we know we can't leave the same person.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Judgment begins at the house of God.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; This is a chance to make it right.
[1:59:13] There's a tenderness, a reverence we
[1:59:16] need to have.
[1:59:19] And let me say this,
[1:59:21] that's what brother Billy says. Let me
[1:59:23] say this.
[1:59:26] You could have a satchel full, a
[1:59:28] suitcase full of $100 bills,
[1:59:32] and if they're counterfeit, and you have
[1:59:34] one genuine dollar, I'm talking the
[1:59:36] George Washington little piece of paper,
[1:59:38] just the one simple dollar, it exceeds
[1:59:40] the value of that entire suitcase.
[1:59:44] Yes,
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; there are real true message believers.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; And I believe I'm in the presence of a
[1:59:53] bunch of them.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Our gracious and kind heavenly father.
[1:59:59] Lord, we do thank you for the revealed
[2:00:02] truth, the word of the Lord that keeps
[2:00:04] us right in the center of the road.
[2:00:06] Lord, we thank you for God called men
[2:00:09] that are willing to stand, Lord, with no
[2:00:11] reputation
[2:00:14] that they're desiring to be built up,
[2:00:17] Lord, in the eyes of man, but in
[2:00:19] tenderness and behind closed doors,
[2:00:23] Lord, that are willing to give
[2:00:24] themselves over to study and and have
[2:00:27] you reveal your word to them, Lord,
[2:00:30] through this message of the hour. Bring
[2:00:32] it in truth, Lord. We appreciate it. We
[2:00:35] rely on it and that's what we come here
[2:00:36] for.
[2:00:38] Lord, we ask you just continue to build
[2:00:40] us up in your word, Lord. Strength,
[2:00:42] strengthen us,
[2:00:44] Lord. May we not slip, but if we slip,
[2:00:47] Lord, may we find the right traction,
[2:00:49] Lord, to get back in line
[2:00:52] to get back with the the truth, Lord.
[2:00:56] Lord, if it cuts,
[2:00:58] if it pounds us, if it beats us, Lord,
[2:01:00] it's just like a a chef preparing a
[2:01:03] piece of meat and wanting it to soak in
[2:01:06] and marinate. May it the flavor be
[2:01:09] better. Lord, sometimes you have to mar
[2:01:11] it. Sometimes you have to cut it, beat
[2:01:13] it on the counter, whatever it takes.
[2:01:15] Lord, we want to be seasoned just right.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Grant it to us, Lord, as we go from here
[2:01:20] that Lord, we just meditate on these
[2:01:22] things. And Lord, we just come up a
[2:01:24] little higher. And Lord, we're going
[2:01:26] down the road because we can't just
[2:01:28] stall out and be left behind. We have to
[2:01:30] be moving on. We're the bride of Christ
[2:01:33] that's that's headed somewhere, Lord.
[2:01:36] And we're following those bloody
[2:01:37] footsteps. We pray, Lord, that we just
[2:01:41] all be in one mind and one accord as we
[2:01:43] go from here. Lord, may your presence
[2:01:46] just continue to be with us, be with our
[2:01:48] families, our loved ones, Lord, and
[2:01:50] truthfully, the the entire body of
[2:01:52] Christ tonight, Lord. We lift them up
[2:01:54] and ask you to strengthen them as a
[2:01:56] whole, Lord. And Lord, we trust and
[2:01:59] believe that you're more than able to do
[2:02:00] these things. We ask in the name of the
[2:02:03] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:12] Amen. Let's just sing that as our
[2:02:13] dismiss tonight.
[2:02:17] Will and he became sin
[2:02:21] who knew no sin
[2:02:25] that we might become
[2:02:28] his righteousness.
