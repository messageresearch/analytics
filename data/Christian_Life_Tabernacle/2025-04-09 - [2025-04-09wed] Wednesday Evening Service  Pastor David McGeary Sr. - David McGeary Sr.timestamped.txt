[22:21] fellowship around your word to be lifted
[22:24] up to have our
[22:28] hearts enkindled, Father, with your
[22:32] wonderful spirit, Father, to strengthen
[22:36] our minds and to and to fortify us
[22:40] behind the truth. truth of your word.
[22:43] Grant it to us this evening. We ask it
[22:46] in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. You
[22:50] may be seated for a moment this evening.
[22:53] And uh I just want to make a just a a a
[22:57] couple of announcements. Uh uh we know
[23:02] that we have our our our our church uh
[23:06] pavilion dedication picnic uh this
[23:10] Sunday right after service. So uh you
[23:14] know feel free to come to church in your
[23:17] more casual clothes. You know that maybe
[23:20] for the picnic but remember still be
[23:23] modest. you know, we don't wear tight
[23:25] skirts and, you know, tight t-shirts and
[23:29] stuff like that. So, you know, you you
[23:31] don't have to dress churchy up, but
[23:34] still dress nice. You know what I mean?
[23:37] But you don't have to change to go to
[23:39] the picnic. So, wear something you can
[23:41] spell ketchup on and and still be happy.
[23:46] And then, uh, so that'll be right after
[23:48] uh right after the uh uh service. So,
[23:54] and then Saturday, uh, we could use some
[23:57] help from a a few brothers to, uh, help
[24:00] set up for for the picnic, uh, get the
[24:04] grill ready, get all the gas bottles,
[24:07] make sure everything's working, help set
[24:10] up the seating, uh, get some trash cans
[24:13] and some things out, maybe some things
[24:16] that we'd like to do, maybe if they want
[24:18] to set up volleyball or whatever we've
[24:21] got. Uh so if we can get somebody to
[24:24] help maybe about 10 o'clock Saturday
[24:27] morning, uh that would be nice. Uh this
[24:30] Friday, I believe, uh it's our 39 and
[24:35] under couples dinner. And there's always
[24:38] room. So there's still room. And uh if
[24:41] uh you you were wanting some help with a
[24:44] babysitter, uh contact Sister Leslie.
[24:47] She'll maybe try try to help find you a
[24:51] babysitter. I think she's not
[24:53] babysitting much anymore, but um um but
[24:58] anyway, she'll see if they can help you.
[25:00] So, feel free to be that. So, we're
[25:03] anxious for that. Aren't you? I am. Uh I
[25:06] get to go and u be there and
[25:11] um and pretend I'm under 39. So, I'm
[25:15] going to be under 39 pretty soon. I have
[25:19] a promise for that. So, we certainly
[25:22] like to uh uh welcome you uh to that.
[25:26] So, uh tonight we're going to uh just
[25:30] have a little uh service and we're going
[25:33] to uh listen to um 30 minutes out of the
[25:39] message called uh Without Money and
[25:42] Without Price. And so uh uh we're that
[25:48] so that we're going to listen to that
[25:50] and uh I think that you'll certainly
[25:54] enjoy uh that. And we're going to start
[25:56] with the scripture. Um let me see if I
[26:00] can find the scripture here uh for you
[26:03] to look up. It's uh
[26:07] uh it'll be in uh the book of Isaiah
[26:13] um the 55th uh chapter of Isaiah. And so
[26:18] if you can find that in your Bibles, uh
[26:22] that's where we're going to start. And
[26:24] so, uh, today I I was, uh, over at a
[26:28] piece of property and it working and
[26:31] brother Tommy come over to help me, uh,
[26:34] do a little thing. And so, uh, I I'm
[26:39] this uh, sermon tonight comes from
[26:41] Brother
[26:42] Tommy. And, uh, I would have him preach
[26:45] it, but, I don't know if I could get him
[26:48] up here to preach, you know. So, but
[26:51] anyway, so I want you to know that I'm
[26:53] preaching this on his
[26:56] behalf. So, Tommy, I hope I represent
[26:59] you uh uh good enough uh to make you
[27:04] happy, but uh uh it was really a
[27:07] blessing to me. I'd already purposed in
[27:09] my heart to speak tonight uh since we're
[27:13] not having service Sunday evening and uh
[27:16] we're going to have a singing. So, I
[27:18] thought I'd just minister tonight and
[27:20] and then we'll have our our Sunday
[27:24] event. But, so,
[27:26] um, what we'll do is we'll stand and
[27:29] then when he gets done reading the
[27:31] scripture, we'll sit down. Now, and I I
[27:35] I don't know. I I know in our lives that
[27:39] we're so busy sometimes that we don't
[27:42] really realize all that's going on
[27:45] around the world. and and how the
[27:48] world's progressing and the path it's
[27:51] on. You know, sometimes we're just happy
[27:54] if we got enough money in the bank to
[27:56] pay our rent or or you know, we struggle
[27:59] from day to day to work and but yet all
[28:02] the all the prophecies and all the
[28:05] events are coming to pass just one after
[28:09] another after another. and and there's
[28:12] nothing that's going on that we haven't
[28:15] been warned
[28:16] about, that hasn't been prophesied to
[28:19] us, and that we can't find in the word
[28:23] of God. There's no new thing under the
[28:26] sun. And so, we know that the battle
[28:30] that we fight is in our mind. So, that's
[28:34] where the battle is. It's it it's in our
[28:36] mind. So, we're always looking for
[28:40] things that we can grab a hold on and
[28:44] and and make them a part of our thought
[28:47] process so when the enemy comes in like
[28:50] a flood, we can take that word of God
[28:52] and and and rise right up and uh uh uh
[28:57] stand there. And uh uh so I I just trust
[29:01] uh this evening that you'll enjoy this
[29:04] uh 30 minutes. Then we'll just make a
[29:07] few comments and just kind of
[29:09] evangelistic and just a a time tonight
[29:12] to uh just to bring back our minds to
[29:16] put some good thoughts in our minds that
[29:18] when the enemy comes we can take uh the
[29:22] word of God and we can just say well
[29:24] what about this and what about that and
[29:27] what about this and just like that song
[29:30] says uh we don't need or not no other
[29:33] explanation we don't need nothing. We've
[29:35] got the word, Satan. You can take what
[29:38] you've got and just go down the road
[29:40] with it. Amen. So, let us sit back the
[29:43] next uh 30 minutes and just listen. Now,
[29:46] uh the the sermon is without money and
[29:51] without price. And anybody that knows
[29:53] anything about the news, it's all been
[29:56] about tariffs. It's all been about the
[29:59] economy. It's all been about money. It's
[30:02] all about who's ripping us off and who's
[30:05] not ripping us off and and how, you
[30:09] know, we want to bankrupt China and
[30:12] China wants to bankrupt us and the whole
[30:15] world spiritually bankrupt and they
[30:16] don't know it. But anyway, it's it's and
[30:20] then here comes brother Brandon back in
[30:23] 1959. I I think it's August 2nd and he
[30:27] he's he's he's just speaking about a
[30:31] spirit. In fact, he actually calls it in
[30:34] here
[30:35] Americanism. Um and and and we begin to
[30:39] see these are the kind of commotions and
[30:42] confusions that we're battling. And yet
[30:45] we have something that is so valuable
[30:49] that you can't even put a price on it.
[30:51] So, let's just enjoy this next moment.
[30:54] If you get a chance to go back and
[30:56] listen to the whole message, I think
[30:58] it'll be a blessing. But, uh, I just
[31:01] picked this part of it uh, this evening
[31:04] to go along uh, with brother Tommy's
[31:06] sermon. So, uh, Lord richly bless you
[31:09] tonight as we listen to God's word.
[31:12] Thank you.
[31:14] I thought we'd read some from the word
[31:16] of God. You have your Bible.
[31:19] Let us turn to the book of
[31:21] Isaiah. I like to see you get your book
[31:24] and read it. I read I know more than
[31:28] just one or two words we read. Yet it's
[31:33] eternal immortal word. It can never pass
[31:41] away. 55th chapter of Isaiah.
[31:47] Topic the everlasting
[31:51] salvation. Oh, everyone that thirsteth,
[31:55] come ye to the
[31:57] waters. And he that has no money, come
[32:01] ye buy and
[32:04] eat.
[32:05] Yay, come buy wine, milk without money
[32:11] and without price.
[32:14] Why do you spend money for that which is
[32:17] not
[32:19] bread, and your labor for that which
[32:22] satisfaithth
[32:25] not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat
[32:30] ye that which is
[32:32] good, and let your souls delight itself
[32:36] in fatness.
[32:40] Incline your
[32:42] ear and come unto
[32:45] me here and your soul shall
[32:50] live and I will make an everlasting
[32:54] covenant with you even the sure mercies
[32:58] of David.
[33:08] I'd like to speak to you just for a few
[33:11] moments on the subject without money or
[33:15] without
[33:20] prize. There is so
[33:23] many entertaining things of our days.
[33:29] There's so much to entice
[33:33] people to what we would call
[33:38] pleasures and it's for all
[33:42] peoples, all ages.
[33:46] There are the enticements for the young
[33:50] people, the modern
[33:53] uh dances and the
[33:57] uh rock and roll parties and the music
[34:01] that they have. It goes with it and it's
[34:04] all
[34:06] enticing for entertainment.
[34:10] I don't care how good or home a child
[34:13] has been brought up
[34:16] in how it's been taught to do
[34:20] right. If that child hasn't accepted the
[34:24] experience of the new
[34:26] birth, rock and roll music catches his
[34:30] attention just as quick as he hears it.
[34:34] Because in him is born in him by nature.
[34:38] a carnal
[34:40] spirit and the power of the devil is so
[34:44] great
[34:45] today till it catches that spirit of
[34:49] that little
[34:51] one. How much more will it do to the old
[34:54] man that has rejected the new birth?
[35:00] Because only as your life is
[35:04] changed and you've been converted and
[35:08] born a new into the kingdom of God, your
[35:12] nature will still be of the things of
[35:15] the world.
[35:17] No matter how religious you
[35:19] are, unless that has been changed in
[35:23] you, you can worship and be religious,
[35:26] but still that will have some kind of a
[35:29] drawing power to you because this old
[35:34] man of sin and his desires is not dead
[35:37] in you yet.
[35:39] But once let Christ take the throne in
[35:42] your heart, those things don't bother
[35:46] him. It is so much
[35:51] greater. I cannot mention the man's name
[35:54] because I can't think of his name now,
[35:57] but many of you will remember him. They
[36:00] say there was an island where the the
[36:04] man would go and ambush and the women
[36:07] would come out
[36:09] singing. And their songs were so
[36:12] tantalizing that the sailors passing by
[36:15] and the ships would come in and then the
[36:18] ambush soldiers would would catch the
[36:21] sailors off a guard and slay
[36:24] them. And a certain great
[36:28] man wanted to pass by and he had his
[36:31] sailors to tie him to a mass pole and
[36:34] and and put something in his mouth so he
[36:38] could not scream and and put plugs in
[36:41] his sailor's ears so they could not
[36:43] hear and sailed by to hear it.
[36:48] And the women came out dancing and and
[36:51] screaming and singing and oh it was so
[36:55] great till he turned the hide on his
[36:58] wrist screaming to his sailors turn in
[37:01] turn
[37:03] in but they couldn't hear him. They had
[37:06] plugs in their
[37:08] ears. And then he sailed to a certain
[37:10] place where they was to unmask his or
[37:14] untie his hands. And he was to take the
[37:16] plugs from their ears.
[37:19] there. When walking on the streets, he
[37:22] heard a
[37:23] musician that was so far supreme to that
[37:27] down
[37:28] there that when he passed by again, they
[37:33] said, "Oh, great rover, shall we tie you
[37:37] to the mass pole again?" He said, "No,
[37:39] just let me
[37:41] loose. I've heard something so much
[37:44] greater." Cuz that'll never bother me no
[37:46] more. Amen. That's the way it is to a
[37:49] born again Christian. Amen.
[37:54] They found something so much greater
[37:57] than the rock and rolls and the
[38:00] entertainments of this world. They are
[38:03] entertained by the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[38:08] And it's so much greater till the world
[38:11] is dead to them.
[38:16] But when you go to this cheap
[38:20] entertainment, you must remember that
[38:22] you got to take lots of
[38:25] money. The young fellow who takes his
[38:28] girlfriend to
[38:31] these parties and these uh dances and so
[38:36] forth is going to pay great lot of his
[38:41] week's
[38:42] earnings. And the old people who try to
[38:45] find pleasure in going to the beer
[38:48] potters to drink away their sorrows of
[38:51] the week, they're going to have to pay
[38:54] great
[38:57] money. And what do they get from
[39:01] it? They don't get nothing but
[39:05] heartache. And remember, you've got to
[39:08] settle up with God someday for it.
[39:12] And the wages of sin is death.
[39:18] You don't make nothing here on earth by
[39:21] it. It's a false
[39:25] mirage. Drinking will only add
[39:28] sorrow. Sin will only add death upon
[39:33] death. Your final check will be
[39:36] separation from God eternally into the
[39:39] lake of fire.
[39:42] and you cannot gain
[39:44] anything but
[39:48] lose. Then God comes and asks the
[39:52] question, why do you spend your money
[39:55] for those things that satisfies
[39:59] not? Why do you do it? What makes man
[40:05] want to do it?
[40:08] They spend all that they've got, all
[40:11] that they can earn to buy drinking, to
[40:15] clothe some woman that they run with or
[40:18] some kind of a worldly lustful
[40:22] pleasures.
[40:27] But we are told in the Bible and our bid
[40:30] to come to
[40:32] God and to buy eternal joy and eternal
[40:37] life without money or without price.
[40:41] Amen.
[40:44] Those things cannot
[40:46] satisfy and the end of them is eternal
[40:51] death. And it cost you all the money
[40:54] that you can muster together to be the
[40:58] the big shot or the entertainer or the
[41:02] fun boy or whatever you might be or the
[41:05] popular girl or whatever it is. It cost
[41:08] all you can get together to do that.
[41:12] dress in the very highest of dressings
[41:14] and and do the things that the world
[41:17] does only to reap a check of eternal
[41:21] damnation.
[41:24] God said then
[41:27] why what are we going to do at the day
[41:30] of judgment when we're asked why did we
[41:34] do
[41:36] that? What's going to be our answer?
[41:40] What's going to be the answer to modern
[41:44] America who says that they are a
[41:47] Christian
[41:48] nation and there's more money spent for
[41:53] whiskey in a year's time than there is
[41:56] for
[41:59] food. Why spend your money for those
[42:02] kind of
[42:05] things? Yet the government would send
[42:09] you to
[42:10] penitentiary for $5 worth of
[42:15] taxes that you had sent maybe to some
[42:18] institution that wasn't correctly set in
[42:21] order to receive taxes to send some
[42:23] missionary overseas.
[42:26] We're going to be asked someday, "Why
[42:29] did you do it?"
[42:32] We are a Christian nation and billions
[42:35] are sent to those people over there that
[42:39] were trying to buy their
[42:42] friendship. Now they're turning it
[42:44] down. No wonder Kushchoff said, "If
[42:48] there is a God, he'll sweep his palace
[42:52] clean again." Amen.
[42:56] The
[42:57] heathens can make such statements to
[43:00] bring shame upon
[43:06] us. What a ridiculous thing it is. And
[43:10] we call ourselves
[43:14] Christians. God said, "Come by eternal
[43:17] life without money, without price."
[43:21] Amen. Life to live forever. And we put
[43:24] our backs on it and laugh in his
[43:28] face. What are we going to do on that
[43:31] day? What's going to be if God gives us
[43:35] things to do and gives us money and
[43:37] makes us the richest nation under the
[43:40] heavens? Then God's going to ask, "What
[43:43] did we do with it? Why do we spend our
[43:46] money for things that satisfies not?"
[43:51] Not only to a nation, but that'll be to
[43:55] individuals. From pennies to millions of
[43:58] dollars will each one be
[44:00] given when men kill one another. I read
[44:04] an article just recently where two boys
[44:06] working in a hunting camp. One had five
[44:10] children, the other had two, and one of
[44:11] them had to be laid off.
[44:14] And one of the boys that had two
[44:17] children or had five children felt that
[44:20] he needed to work more than the one with
[44:22] the two children and went hunting with
[44:24] him and shot him in the
[44:27] back.
[44:29] Money, that's the kind of a nation,
[44:32] that's a kind of a feeling, that's a
[44:34] kind of a spirit that dominates the
[44:37] people.
[44:39] And you can see how essential that the
[44:42] new birth has to
[44:44] be. You must be born again. Amen. It's
[44:48] got to be. Come to me and buy without
[44:51] money. Amen. You can't say I didn't have
[44:53] the money. You don't need any money.
[44:57] Amen.
[44:59] It's freely
[45:01] given. We are Americans are so prone to
[45:05] paying our way for everything.
[45:08] That's our
[45:09] slogan. We pay for things. We got money.
[45:13] Flash our dollar
[45:15] bills. Other countries and so forth.
[45:18] It's
[45:19] poor. Walking. You see the tourists come
[45:21] in all in feathers and
[45:24] fine. Americans cater to them. That
[45:28] stuff is filthy lucer in the side of
[45:30] God.
[45:33] That will not buy our way to heaven. But
[45:36] everything in America, we got to pay our
[45:38] way. You go to the
[45:41] restaurant and you eat your
[45:43] dinner and if you don't put money on the
[45:46] table to tip that
[45:48] waitress, there's a frown comes on the
[45:51] face after she's paid by the company
[45:54] she's working for. And that better be at
[45:57] least 10% or better of your bill.
[46:03] If you don't, that waitress will look
[46:05] down upon you as a skin or some kind of
[46:08] a a
[46:10] miser and she's getting her
[46:13] money. I think it's a disgrace and a
[46:16] shame to do it. I think it's poor
[46:18] judgment upon the nation. Used to be
[46:21] good people, good places wouldn't permit
[46:24] that. But it's all going into one big
[46:28] spirit.
[46:30] I was going on a trip on a train in a
[46:33] porter. I had a little briefcase in one
[46:36] hand, a suitcase in the other, and my
[46:38] little shaving kit under my arm and was
[46:41] walking. The porter walked up said, "Can
[46:44] I pack it for you?" I said, "Well, I'm
[46:45] just going right there at the train,
[46:47] sir. Thank you very much." Just about
[46:50] oh, 30 yards. He said, "I'll take it."
[46:53] And he took the little thing and picked
[46:55] it up, walked on. Well, when he come on,
[46:57] I thought maybe I I know what he was
[46:59] paid, but I would just give him I give
[47:01] him a half a dollar. He probably had in
[47:04] possession my um uh goods for about uh
[47:09] say a
[47:10] minute about far as the end of this
[47:13] tabernacle where he got on a train. I
[47:15] stepped up on the train first and just
[47:17] reached down and got it. I gave him a
[47:19] half dollar. He said, "Just a
[47:22] minute." I said, "What is it, sir?" He
[47:25] said, "I packed three bags for
[47:28] you." I said, "Yes, sir. That's right.
[47:30] What? What's wrong?" He said, "My
[47:33] minimum charge is 25 cents a bag. You
[47:36] owe me another 25
[47:39] cents." See, that's
[47:42] Americanism. Everything's got to be
[47:47] paid. You go ride in your
[47:49] car and let it fall into the ditch.
[47:55] and you get somebody to pull you
[47:57] out, you better get ready to
[48:00] pay cuz they're going to charge you for
[48:04] it. A recorder comes and gets you, he'll
[48:07] charge you so much a
[48:10] mile. And if the farmer nine times out
[48:13] of 10 gets his tractor out, it'll be
[48:15] worse than
[48:16] that. You've got to pay for everything
[48:20] that you get done.
[48:22] Everything is paid money. Pay
[48:27] money. And yet, how much greater ditch
[48:30] has sin throwed you
[48:32] in? Who could ever get you out of the
[48:35] ditch of
[48:38] sin? But God takes you out of the ditch
[48:41] of sin without money, without price.
[48:46] when there's no one could take you out.
[48:50] If you don't pay dearly for your record
[48:53] pulling, you'll stay in the
[48:56] ditch. You've got to have the money or
[48:59] you stay in the
[49:02] ditch. But the worst ditch you ever got
[49:04] in is what the devil throwed you in. The
[49:07] ditch of sin and
[49:10] unbelief. God willfully will pull you
[49:13] out without money, without cause. Amen.
[49:17] And yet you lay in the
[49:19] ditch just slushing the
[49:24] sin. Don't even call upon
[49:27] him. When you get the wrecker out,
[49:30] usually they put a big chain way over
[49:32] into the ditch, wrap it around the
[49:34] bumper or so forth and begin to crank
[49:36] and the power of the car begins to pull
[49:39] and the motors go to operating and pulls
[49:42] you
[49:43] out. When God finds you in the ditch of
[49:48] sin and hear you calling on him, he
[49:52] sends down a chain that was wrapped
[49:54] around Calvary
[49:56] the love of God and hooks it on to your
[49:59] heart and puts the power of the Holy
[50:02] Spirit there to start pulling. Amen.
[50:06] And it don't cost you nothing. Amen.
[50:11] And yet we lay in the
[50:13] ditch because we can't pay it with our
[50:16] pockets. We Americans think we can pay
[50:19] it out of our pockets, but you
[50:21] can't. It's without money or without
[50:24] price.
[50:26] Amen. You don't pay it at the church.
[50:29] Jesus paid it at Calvary. Amen. But
[50:32] people's ashamed of it. They want it in
[50:36] their
[50:37] way. God has a way for you to receive
[50:40] it. And it's free if you'll take
[50:43] it. Usually when they pull you out of
[50:46] the ditch, you're all scratched
[50:49] up. You have to go at the
[50:52] hospital. And before they start working
[50:55] on you before one thing is
[51:00] done, they ask who's going to pay the
[51:03] bill.
[51:06] If we're going to sort up the
[51:08] wounds, if we're going to pour in the
[51:11] oil and give the shots for for uh to
[51:16] inoculate you from blood poison, what
[51:20] kind of an insurance do you have before
[51:23] they do one thing? It's got to be money
[51:25] on the line.
[51:29] But when our Lord puts his chain of love
[51:32] around your heart, it pulls you from the
[51:34] ditch of sin. Amen. He heals every
[51:38] broken heart. Takes away all the sin and
[51:41] the bills put in the sea of
[51:43] forgetfulness to remember against you no
[51:45] more.
[51:47] Come without money or without price.
[51:53] No matter how bad you're cut up, how bad
[51:56] your bruised, how your he's done or what
[51:59] you've done. There's no bill to it.
[52:04] He heals the heartaches.
[52:06] Takes away all your
[52:08] sorrows. He was wounded for our
[52:11] transgressions, bruised for our
[52:13] iniquity. The chastisement of our peace
[52:16] was upon him. And with his stripes, we
[52:19] were
[52:22] all free. Glory be to God. And we won't
[52:25] receive it. is because we're dominated
[52:28] by the wrong spirit. We're dominated by
[52:31] a spirit of a nation, the spirit of the
[52:34] world. Instead of being dominated by the
[52:37] spirit of God, the Holy Spirit that
[52:40] leads us and guides us to all truths and
[52:43] makes the Bible
[52:46] so. Some time ago, I was talking to an
[52:49] infidel. He said, "Think of it, Mr.
[52:52] Brandon. All this misery of life
[52:57] And the only thing that we have that
[52:59] we're saved is some old Jewish
[53:02] writings. Oh, I said, "Sir, that may be
[53:06] all you have." Amen. But I've got
[53:09] something more than that. Amen.
[53:13] Praise the Lord. I have the spirit of
[53:16] the one that wrote it,
[53:19] that confirms it and makes it so every
[53:22] promise. Amen.
[53:25] didn't know how to take that.
[53:29] See, to come to come and buy without
[53:33] money, buy without price. It don't cost
[53:36] nothing. It's free to whosoever will let
[53:41] him
[53:43] come. God pulls you from the
[53:46] ditch. Like the man at the gate called
[53:51] beautiful. He had been ditched from his
[53:54] mother's womb by the devil who had
[53:57] crippled him in his
[53:59] feet. His way of livelihood was begging
[54:02] arms from the people had passed
[54:05] by. And as he sat at the gate that
[54:08] morning, he saw two Pentecostal
[54:10] preachers coming.
[54:13] Not one dime among them.
[54:19] For he said, "Silver have I
[54:22] none, and a dime is the smallest piece
[54:25] of
[54:26] silver. Silver and gold have I
[54:29] none." I suppose the man thought
[54:32] something like this. There's no need of
[54:34] getting my
[54:35] cup. Maybe he was trying to save enough
[54:38] money. He was 40 years
[54:40] old. And maybe he was trying to save
[54:42] enough money the physicians could make
[54:44] him a pair of braces to walk
[54:46] on. or he in his ankles is where he was
[54:51] weakened. And maybe he had to have the
[54:55] money to lay on the
[54:57] line before the physicians would give
[55:00] him a
[55:01] support. And surely there's no need of
[55:04] him holding his
[55:05] cup to these Pentecostal preachers that
[55:08] had
[55:09] nothing. the opportunity the the was
[55:14] very
[55:15] poor of ever being able to find a penny
[55:18] from them fellows.
[55:21] But when he looked into their
[55:24] face, one young and bushing with youth,
[55:27] the other old and
[55:28] wrinkled, as John, as Peter and John
[55:32] went up to the
[55:33] gate, he saw
[55:38] something. And that youthful man, that
[55:41] is, the blush was a little greater than
[55:44] ordinary.
[55:46] He saw beneath the wrinkles and cares of
[55:49] the Galilean sun that has scorched the
[55:53] old fisherman's face. There was a joy
[55:55] unspeakable and full of
[55:58] glory. He saw something that seemed to
[56:01] be a little
[56:03] different. You know, there's something
[56:05] about
[56:06] Christianity that makes people look
[56:08] different. Hallelujah. They are the
[56:11] prettiest people in all the world.
[56:14] Hallelujah.
[56:16] and he got his cup and he held it off.
[56:20] And the apostle Peter being the
[56:24] oldest said, "Silver and gold have I
[56:29] none." In other words, I can't help you
[56:31] any to buy these
[56:33] crutches. Silver and gold have I
[56:37] none, but such as I have. Amen.
[56:42] He had been to buy from him that had
[56:45] honey
[56:47] and the joys of the wine of
[56:50] salvation. He had just come two or three
[56:54] days before that from Pentecost
[56:57] where something had
[56:59] happened and the young man sprung with a
[57:02] great big a man to it and looked into
[57:05] his face.
[57:08] What happened? That chain
[57:11] of sympathy, the compassion of him that
[57:15] said, "I had compassion on the sick."
[57:18] That same spirit had taken
[57:22] place. The old fisherman's
[57:26] heart, he said, "As far as money, I have
[57:30] none. But I've got something that'll
[57:33] take its place a million times." Amen.
[57:37] Such as I have. Now remember Peter was a
[57:41] Jew and they loved money naturally. But
[57:44] this Jew had been
[57:46] converted. Not such as I have sell I
[57:50] thee, but such as I have give I thee.
[57:54] Amen.
[57:56] Hallelujah. Such as I have. I haven't
[58:00] got a penny in my pocket. I couldn't buy
[58:04] a loaf of bread. I couldn't buy nothing.
[58:07] I don't have a scent.
[58:09] But if you can receive it such as I
[58:13] have, I'll give it to you because it was
[58:17] given to me. Praise God.
[58:21] That's what we need. Hallelujah. Such as
[58:25] I have give I thee. What do you answer?
[58:29] I've been up to him that sells milk and
[58:32] honey without price.
[58:38] I'll give it to you.
[58:41] You don't owe me nothing for it. If you
[58:44] can receive it, I'll give it to
[58:46] you. Not as one who would charge, but
[58:50] those who would give because as freely
[58:52] as you receive, freely give.
[58:56] It has been the commission of his Lord
[58:58] just three days
[59:02] before. Go into all the world, preach
[59:04] the
[59:06] gospel. He that believeth and is
[59:08] baptized shall be saved, and he that
[59:10] believeth not shall be damned. These
[59:12] signs shall follow them that believe.
[59:14] Amen. In my name, they shall cast out
[59:17] devils. They shall speak with new
[59:20] tongues. If they drink deadly things, it
[59:22] shall not hurt them. If they take up
[59:24] serpents, it'll not bother them. As
[59:26] freely as you have received, freely
[59:28] give. Amen. that Jew had been changed.
[59:33] Hallelujah. What we need in America is a
[59:36] changing of the Holy Spirit to take the
[59:39] place of our religious ritual.
[59:42] Hallelujah.
[59:44] As freely as you receive, freely give.
[59:47] Such as I have give I thee in the name
[59:51] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Rise up and
[59:55] walk. Hallelujah.
[59:57] faith in that unadulterated name of the
[1:00:02] creator. No wonder he went leaping and
[1:00:05] jumping and praising
[1:00:08] God. Oh, you know the great things. He'd
[1:00:11] maybe sat there 40 years trying to get
[1:00:13] enough money to buy him some
[1:00:15] crutches, but he couldn't do it. But
[1:00:18] right in the most unexpected place and
[1:00:22] the unexpected time and the most
[1:00:26] unexpected insufficient people, he got
[1:00:29] what he wanted. Amen.
[1:00:32] I'm so glad God does it that way. Amen.
[1:00:36] And a bunch of little so-called holy
[1:00:39] rollers. One night, I found what I
[1:00:42] wanted that money could not buy. Amen.
[1:00:48] in a bunch of
[1:00:51] illiterate, uneducated, poorly
[1:00:55] dressed people negroes to begin
[1:00:59] with. Outer in a little old converted
[1:01:03] saloon on the floor, I
[1:01:05] found a price, a jewel.
[1:01:11] Hallelujah.
[1:01:13] When that old looked in my face
[1:01:15] and said, "Have you received the Holy
[1:01:18] Ghost since you believe?" Amen.
[1:01:21] Hallelujah. Oh, it was something that I
[1:01:24] wanted. I didn't expect to find it
[1:01:27] amongst those people, but they had what
[1:01:29] I needed.
[1:01:38] You certainly got a glimpse into where
[1:01:41] brother Brandham got the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:43] Amen. And how you get it. Amen. You
[1:01:46] know, I I just thought that was uh just
[1:01:50] wonderful. And and you know, he just
[1:01:52] talks about America, you know, and the
[1:01:55] American spirit. It's always money,
[1:01:57] always. What can you pay for? You know,
[1:01:59] money, money, money. It just seems to be
[1:02:02] the spirit, you know, always looking for
[1:02:05] fame and and and notoriety and uh
[1:02:09] publicity and they they uh it it doesn't
[1:02:13] matter. They say in Hollywood it doesn't
[1:02:16] matter if they're saying good about you
[1:02:18] or bad about you as long as they're
[1:02:20] talking about you, you know, as long as
[1:02:22] you stay in the things. Some people will
[1:02:24] go do crazy things just to stay in the
[1:02:27] limelight just not to be forgotten to
[1:02:31] get their picture on people's magazine
[1:02:34] or to get it in some sort of uh you know
[1:02:38] some scandal paper. It doesn't matter.
[1:02:40] They just want to be talked about. They
[1:02:43] want to be noticed.
[1:02:44] They want to be famous. They they just
[1:02:48] look for fame and and and and you know
[1:02:51] and riches and they always want a higher
[1:02:54] class of people you know it just uh it
[1:02:58] it's just the way that man is you know
[1:03:00] they want they want to uh separate
[1:03:03] themselves you know what I mean be be
[1:03:06] stand apart you know what I mean uh uh I
[1:03:09] I want to be above somebody you know uh
[1:03:12] people sometimes will just talk people
[1:03:15] down just so that they they could be
[1:03:17] lifted up, you know. And I'm saying, you
[1:03:20] know, I I went to buy a a a car one time
[1:03:23] and and and sure enough, when I got
[1:03:25] there, uh the guy was selling Fords and
[1:03:29] and about a year earlier, I saw him at
[1:03:32] the Chevy place, and the Chevy was the
[1:03:34] best car in the whole wide world, you
[1:03:37] know, but now he's selling Fords. Oh, I
[1:03:39] wouldn't drive a Chevy. You know, one
[1:03:41] year ago it was, I wouldn't drive
[1:03:43] nothing else but a Chevy. You know what
[1:03:46] I mean? It just a motive and object is
[1:03:48] not the truth. It was money. Anything to
[1:03:51] make the sale, anything for money,
[1:03:55] anything like this. And and and the the
[1:03:57] prophets uh uh uh laying this spirit out
[1:04:02] in 59. And we see it all today.
[1:04:05] Everybody's concerned about the economy.
[1:04:07] Everybody's concerned about their
[1:04:09] 401k. You know what I mean? They're not
[1:04:12] concerned about eternal life.
[1:04:15] Oh, what? How much do I got in the bank?
[1:04:17] How much do I got here? How much? And
[1:04:19] you know, and yet we got the a promise
[1:04:22] that says, I've never seen a righteous
[1:04:24] man beg bread.
[1:04:27] God will take care of you. You don't
[1:04:28] have to worry yourself to
[1:04:31] death. But you know, it's just what
[1:04:33] where man wants. You know, he wants to
[1:04:35] separate himself. He wants to be higher
[1:04:39] than the common man. You know what I
[1:04:42] mean? He don't want he wants to go to a
[1:04:44] better restaurant. You know what I'm
[1:04:47] saying? So they what do they do? They
[1:04:48] take the same old steak that you can go
[1:04:51] down to Albertson's and they'll sell it
[1:04:54] to you for
[1:04:55] $75. Why? Because they want to keep
[1:04:58] everybody else that don't have $75 out
[1:05:01] of the place. You know what I mean? They
[1:05:04] raise their prices so you can't eat
[1:05:06] there. So you can't go there. And then
[1:05:08] somebody that wants to be important, you
[1:05:11] know what I mean? They'll scrape down
[1:05:13] and get $75 and you know what I mean? Go
[1:05:17] hawk their wife's watch or do whatever
[1:05:19] they
[1:05:21] can, excuse me, so they can go eat at
[1:05:23] that $75 restaurant and pretend like
[1:05:27] they're rich.
[1:05:30] It's just a condition of thing.
[1:05:33] I read an article one time the you know
[1:05:36] they used to they called them yuppies
[1:05:39] you know like I don't know if they even
[1:05:40] use that term anymore young urban
[1:05:43] professionals you know it was all
[1:05:45] dressed for success and they said there
[1:05:47] was an apartment complex in Dallas that
[1:05:51] had more BMWs in it than any other place
[1:05:54] in the
[1:05:56] country. Why? They all lived in an
[1:05:58] apartment and drove a car so that they
[1:06:01] could impress everybody. And they had
[1:06:03] them leased right out so they could
[1:06:06] spend all their paycheck. I like what
[1:06:08] the prophet said. You go, you take
[1:06:10] somebody out. He said, you can spend a
[1:06:12] lot of money on that
[1:06:16] girl. You know, they just it's all it's
[1:06:19] all about, you know, trying to cause
[1:06:22] separation. Well, God's trying to
[1:06:24] separate us out, but not do the things
[1:06:28] of the world to things about
[1:06:30] himself. And so, they're always, you
[1:06:33] know, they they've got to be smarter,
[1:06:36] you know, they've got to rise above.
[1:06:37] They got I'm smarter. Everybody's I'm
[1:06:40] smarter than you are. He's he smart
[1:06:43] being smart. You know what I mean? Like
[1:06:45] I say, everybody say, "Oh, this is the
[1:06:46] smartest man in the world." Look at if
[1:06:48] he don't got the Holy Ghost, he ain't
[1:06:50] very smart at all. Amen.
[1:06:53] Any one of you that's got the spirit of
[1:06:55] God in your heart is smarter than
[1:06:58] Einstein.
[1:07:01] You know what the theory of relativity
[1:07:03] is? The wages of sin is death. That's
[1:07:07] that's the relativity. If you don't go
[1:07:10] up, you go down. Amen. That's the simple
[1:07:14] truth. That's the fact. That's how the
[1:07:16] world goes. Why? You know, you know, you
[1:07:19] know, that's just how it is.
[1:07:23] You don't have to be too smart to figure
[1:07:25] that out.
[1:07:28] Or maybe you have to be really smart.
[1:07:30] God smart. That's the best kind of smart
[1:07:34] there is. You got to be
[1:07:36] wealthier. You know, everybody's just
[1:07:38] got to make more than than they've got.
[1:07:40] I've got more than you
[1:07:42] got. Well, wait a minute. If you've got
[1:07:44] him, your father owns the cattle on a
[1:07:47] thousand hills.
[1:07:52] You got a God that'll supply all your
[1:07:54] needs. It doesn't God work marvelous?
[1:07:57] Look at how marvelous God's work. He
[1:08:00] comes down and changes your heart. You
[1:08:02] don't want those things. You don't even
[1:08:05] desire them.
[1:08:10] You He just takes the burden of him off.
[1:08:12] You're content with whatever he provides
[1:08:14] for you. You're not driving down the
[1:08:16] road saying, "Oh, I wish I I've got this
[1:08:18] stinking old Jaguar. I just wish I could
[1:08:21] have a a
[1:08:24] Rolls-Royce, you know what I mean?" And
[1:08:26] then then, you know, something goes out
[1:08:28] of style and oh, you know, I don't Lexus
[1:08:31] isn't in style. Now I got to go get a
[1:08:34] Mercedes, you know, and then Mercedes
[1:08:36] goes up and oh no, now it's BMW or it's
[1:08:40] this or that. And they're never happy.
[1:08:43] And yet God will put something in your
[1:08:45] heart that you're just happy to be
[1:08:48] happy.
[1:08:51] You don't get caught up in that war. You
[1:08:54] don't get caught up in that struggle.
[1:08:57] You don't have to climb the ladder.
[1:09:00] You're happy if he puts food on the
[1:09:02] table. And you know the God that put the
[1:09:04] food on the table for you today will be
[1:09:06] the same God that'll put food on the
[1:09:08] table for you tomorrow because he
[1:09:11] promised he'd never leave you nor
[1:09:12] forsake you. He didn't say as long as
[1:09:15] you're working. He said as long as you
[1:09:18] love me I'll take care of you.
[1:09:21] And you struggle.
[1:09:25] I tell the story all the time. I
[1:09:27] remember when they raised my rent from
[1:09:29] $60 to $80.
[1:09:33] I didn't know what I was going to do.
[1:09:36] Where is the guy going to get another
[1:09:38] $20? I ate breakfast the other day. I
[1:09:42] got two eggs, a piece of ham, a cup of
[1:09:46] two cups of coffee, and a biscuit, and
[1:09:48] it was 20
[1:09:50] bucks. I said, "What do you got back
[1:09:52] there?" The golden
[1:09:57] goose. I'm serious.
[1:10:01] And yet here I
[1:10:04] am. He takes care of you.
[1:10:07] You know, to you know that everybody
[1:10:09] wants to, you know, have some sort of
[1:10:15] distinction, you know, some sort of
[1:10:17] distinction, you know, they they just
[1:10:19] can't be common folk. They've got
[1:10:21] there's got to be a distinction. They've
[1:10:23] got to have some way that they can
[1:10:25] separate them, some some way that they
[1:10:27] can draw distance, some way that they
[1:10:30] can stand out, you know, just some way
[1:10:32] to show
[1:10:33] off. You know, they'll pray crazy things
[1:10:37] just to prove they've got
[1:10:40] it. You don't think
[1:10:43] so? There's sunglasses you can buy for
[1:10:48] $48,000 for a pair of sunglasses.
[1:10:54] Now, that pair of
[1:10:56] sunglasses better make you
[1:11:00] see to the moon in back or something.
[1:11:05] $48,000 for a pair of
[1:11:11] sunglasses. Just think of it. If someone
[1:11:15] wore a
[1:11:16] $400 eight pair of sunglasses in here, I
[1:11:20] wouldn't be able to tell the difference
[1:11:21] of whether it was, you know, a a a pair
[1:11:26] of Dollar Tree
[1:11:29] sunglasses. Why? It's just
[1:11:32] distinction. You have to run around with
[1:11:35] people that know you know what kind of
[1:11:37] sunglasses cost
[1:11:40] $48.
[1:11:44] $48,000 t-shirts.
[1:11:48] $91,500 to a t-shirt. That'd make any
[1:11:51] kid
[1:11:55] cry. Think of it.
[1:12:01] $91,500 for a t-shirt. Now, really, I
[1:12:04] don't even think we ought we ought to be
[1:12:06] wearing t-shirts,
[1:12:08] personally. But that's just that's just
[1:12:12] what what it is. You know what I
[1:12:16] mean? He just praising the Lord, just
[1:12:20] singing away. Yeah. So, it that's how
[1:12:23] they do. But just think of it.
[1:12:28] $91,500 jeans.
[1:12:34] $1,300,000 for a pair of
[1:12:40] jeans. Now, you tell me what guy had pay
[1:12:44] $1,300,000 for a pair of jeans because
[1:12:47] we know women don't wear
[1:12:50] jeans, right?
[1:12:54] I don't know what you call them that do,
[1:12:56] but they ain't
[1:12:59] ladies. A million,
[1:13:03] $300,000 for a pair of
[1:13:07] jeans. And they buy
[1:13:13] them. A purse.
[1:13:19] $3,800,000 for a purse. Tell me, what do
[1:13:23] you put in a
[1:13:26] $3,800,000
[1:13:28] birth? You You got to buy Kleenex for
[1:13:31] $10,000 a pack to make it worth
[1:13:36] it.
[1:13:39] Really? What do you got in
[1:13:43] there? $3
[1:13:45] million
[1:13:48] 800,000. A pair of shoes.
[1:13:51] $17
[1:13:56] million. Dave, you better be able to
[1:13:59] click your heels and get in Kansas just
[1:14:01] like
[1:14:03] that. I don't think anybody caught that,
[1:14:06] Lori. I think we're showing
[1:14:09] some I
[1:14:12] mean
[1:14:17] serious $17 million
[1:14:21] suits on the rack
[1:14:24] suits
[1:14:29] $892,000. If I came out here in a
[1:14:34] $800,000
[1:14:36] $892,000 dude, it better make me look
[1:14:39] like
[1:14:40] Superman. It better not show a
[1:14:44] pound. You You know what I mean? It
[1:14:48] better make me look 21 years
[1:14:51] old. Who would go to
[1:14:55] Iraq and pick out an
[1:14:59] 892,000 and they're on?
[1:15:02] Why? Because they got to show off. They
[1:15:05] got to separate themselves. They got to
[1:15:08] be different. I mean,
[1:15:12] address
[1:15:14] 30 million dollars.
[1:15:23] Why would you do that? So, one person
[1:15:25] says, "Well, my my dress cost 15
[1:15:28] million." The other person said, "Well,
[1:15:30] my dress cost 20 million." "Well, my
[1:15:33] dress cost 30
[1:15:34] million." That's $30 million of
[1:15:40] stupid. It's exactly what it
[1:15:44] is. Think of
[1:15:47] it. Belt
[1:15:54] $250,000
[1:15:56] belt. A belt.
[1:16:01] $250,000 for a
[1:16:04] belt.
[1:16:05] Sneakers on the shelf. Sneakers. You go
[1:16:09] into the sneaker department,
[1:16:12] $1,400 for a pair of sneakers.
[1:16:17] They better have flubber attached to the
[1:16:19] bottom of
[1:16:21] them. Loafers,
[1:16:25] $1,800. Ball caps,
[1:16:28] $98 for a ball
[1:16:32] cap. Washer and
[1:16:34] dryer
[1:16:38] $15,349 each.
[1:16:41] Who buys a
[1:16:43] $15,000 a
[1:16:45] $30,000 washer and dryer? If you can buy
[1:16:48] that for a washer and dryer, you should
[1:16:51] have a
[1:16:55] maid. That's how
[1:16:57] ridiculous things
[1:17:00] are. You know, fabric
[1:17:08] $3,900 a yard.
[1:17:11] for
[1:17:12] fabric. I don't
[1:17:15] know, you know, I don't know how much a
[1:17:17] yard of fabric is, but I've seen a lot
[1:17:20] of things that look dresses that looks
[1:17:23] like they don't even have a half a yard
[1:17:24] of fabric in them. And they and they buy
[1:17:28] jeans, they rip holes in them and tear
[1:17:30] them all up and they you think they they
[1:17:32] dug them out of the trash can and they
[1:17:35] pay 800 bucks for them.
[1:17:38] It it goes to it goes to to show you
[1:17:42] that where they're at. And you say,
[1:17:43] "Well, that's a lot of money." Well,
[1:17:45] even if those things last a hundred
[1:17:47] years or 500 years or a thousand years,
[1:17:51] you
[1:17:56] don't look at
[1:18:00] houses. I used to paint houses. And I
[1:18:02] asked my painter, I says, I said, "Fred,
[1:18:05] what do you paint?" And he says, "Well,
[1:18:06] I'm doing a
[1:18:08] 15,000 square foot house in in uh in
[1:18:15] u some place out here by South Lake or
[1:18:18] someplace or West Lake or something.
[1:18:20] 15,000 square. You know how big 15,000
[1:18:23] square foot house? Both of our buildings
[1:18:25] together isn't 15,000 square
[1:18:29] feet." And I said, "Well, what did it
[1:18:32] get?" I said, "I used to paint houses
[1:18:33] for $5 a square foot." I said, 'What do
[1:18:36] you get now?' He says, 'Oh, we get uh we
[1:18:40] get uh $25 a square
[1:18:44] foot. That's
[1:18:46] $300,000 to paint a
[1:18:50] house. And you know, the funny thing
[1:18:53] about it
[1:18:54] is is they
[1:18:57] say you get what you pay for.
[1:19:03] That that's the thinking. You know, they
[1:19:05] don't think like our messenger said that
[1:19:08] they've got to get account for that.
[1:19:11] They're gonna have to sit there and say,
[1:19:12] "Why did you spend $30 million for a
[1:19:17] dress, you know, when everybody was in
[1:19:20] this kind of condition or you could have
[1:19:22] done this or there's people, you know, I
[1:19:23] mean, because they want to be exclusive.
[1:19:27] They want to walk with a certain group
[1:19:30] of people, a certain, you know, a
[1:19:33] certain line of uh of a a certain crowd,
[1:19:37] a certain click. You know, they're
[1:19:39] ashamed of anybody. It's a way that they
[1:19:42] could segregate. It's a way that they
[1:19:44] could separate. It's a way that they
[1:19:46] could be different than everybody else.
[1:19:50] And yet the most different people in the
[1:19:53] world are people that are born
[1:19:56] again because they got a gentleness in
[1:19:58] their spirit. They got a gentleness in
[1:20:01] their eye. And so that was the subject
[1:20:03] that came up. Brother Tommy is talking
[1:20:05] to me about it and he said, "You know,
[1:20:08] that's what people say. You get what you
[1:20:10] pay for."
[1:20:17] Now, can you imagine if I came home and
[1:20:19] I said, "Leslie, I just paid
[1:20:22] $490,000 for a pair of glasses." And
[1:20:24] she'd know I wouldn't have it for over a
[1:20:27] week before I lose
[1:20:32] it. Dollar Tree is in existence today
[1:20:34] because I buy
[1:20:38] glasses. You lose it all.
[1:20:42] But right, people are willing to
[1:20:45] pay. Okay? And they think that they're
[1:20:49] getting some sort of
[1:20:52] value. In other words, they pay for the
[1:20:55] brand name. They pray for the prestige.
[1:20:58] They pray for the bragging rights. In
[1:21:00] other words, they just don't purchase it
[1:21:02] for that, but they purchase it for all
[1:21:05] that it comes along with it. They're
[1:21:08] willing to pay their money because they
[1:21:11] feel they're going to
[1:21:12] get what they pay
[1:21:15] for. And that's America, right? You get
[1:21:19] what you pay for. You buy something that
[1:21:21] you get what you pay for. You buy you
[1:21:23] That's what they always tell you. Go a
[1:21:24] guy wants to upsell you. That's the
[1:21:27] first line he drops on you. You get what
[1:21:28] you pay for. You know, you want to live
[1:21:31] over here, you get what you pay for. You
[1:21:33] get what you pay for. So everything's
[1:21:35] laid out. You get what you paid for. So
[1:21:38] if you pay if you pay something, then
[1:21:41] you get
[1:21:44] something. Well, if you get what you
[1:21:46] paid
[1:21:47] for, what did Jesus
[1:21:50] get for what he paid
[1:21:56] for? And what price did he
[1:22:01] pay? He paid more than money.
[1:22:06] None of those guys would lay down their
[1:22:09] life. But he paid more than
[1:22:12] money. But he had to get
[1:22:16] something for what he paid for. He just
[1:22:20] didn't lay down his life. He just didn't
[1:22:22] pay the price not to get
[1:22:26] anything. If you buy something and you
[1:22:28] think you paid a lot for it and it and
[1:22:31] it falls apart, what do you say? a piece
[1:22:34] of junk. What are you going to do?
[1:22:36] You're going to take it
[1:22:41] back. But yet Jesus
[1:22:46] paid. His end wasn't
[1:22:50] free. He paid a
[1:22:52] price. He paid the ultimate
[1:22:56] price. The ultimate sacrifice. So he
[1:22:59] paid something. So, so if he paid
[1:23:03] something, then he's supposed to get
[1:23:06] back something for what he paid for
[1:23:09] because you get what you paid
[1:23:12] for. So, what did he
[1:23:16] get? What did he paid for? He paid for a
[1:23:19] spotless bride.
[1:23:22] And if he paid for a spotless bride,
[1:23:24] he's going to get a spotless bride. If
[1:23:27] he has to make her spotless, he's going
[1:23:30] to get what he paid for. He's going to
[1:23:32] forgive her sins. He's going to deliver
[1:23:34] her from the temptation. He's going to
[1:23:37] take the spirits off of her. He's going
[1:23:39] to get it because he paid for it. And
[1:23:41] he's going to get what he paid for.
[1:23:48] Because you get what you're paid
[1:23:50] for. And he paid. So, he's going to get
[1:23:55] he's going to get what he paid for it.
[1:23:58] He paid for a
[1:24:00] bride, a spotless bride. He paid for it.
[1:24:04] You don't pay for it. You don't buy it.
[1:24:07] You don't achieve it. He achieved it for
[1:24:10] you. All you've got to do is say, "I'm
[1:24:13] what he bought."
[1:24:19] Do you believe that?
[1:24:23] So you can look at
[1:24:25] yourself and you can say, "He didn't pay
[1:24:28] for
[1:24:30] this, but he paid for
[1:24:33] me, so he bought something. So he must
[1:24:36] have bought something that he's going to
[1:24:38] transform me into."
[1:24:44] In the sports
[1:24:47] world, they buy
[1:24:51] potential. If they think somebody's can
[1:24:53] amount to
[1:24:55] something or be something, they'll sign
[1:24:58] contracts worth millions of
[1:25:01] dollars because they see a
[1:25:03] potential. They they see something in
[1:25:06] the future that they can they can work
[1:25:08] into. They see somebody that they can
[1:25:11] teach. They see somebody that they can
[1:25:13] train. They see somebody that they can
[1:25:16] develop. They see somebody that that can
[1:25:19] that can show them the
[1:25:21] way. Well, he bought
[1:25:25] us because he knew there was something
[1:25:27] in us, that he could train, something in
[1:25:31] us that he could develop. He didn't just
[1:25:33] He just didn't buy a a a piece of junk
[1:25:36] and put it on the shelf. He wouldn't pay
[1:25:38] his life for you if he didn't see the
[1:25:42] potential in you. He wouldn't give
[1:25:44] everything he had for you. If he didn't
[1:25:47] think he could make you into something
[1:25:49] that was worthwhile,
[1:25:52] you just got to believe in the price.
[1:25:55] Hallelujah.
[1:25:57] Is there a greater price than what he
[1:25:59] paid? Everything these $30 million
[1:26:02] addresses, you hang it in my closet at
[1:26:05] my house, it'll have moth holes in it.
[1:26:08] We don't know where the things come
[1:26:13] from. Or you'll take it to the dry
[1:26:15] cleaner and the dry cleaner will come up
[1:26:18] and have a big rip in it and they'll
[1:26:20] say, "Oh, you brought it in this
[1:26:23] way."
[1:26:27] Right? It's always your fault.
[1:26:32] Jesus didn't buy that.
[1:26:35] Well, you were yet a sinner. He died for
[1:26:37] you. He bought
[1:26:40] you. But he knew what he was paying for
[1:26:42] cuz he gets what he pays
[1:26:45] for. He didn't pay that for
[1:26:49] junk. He didn't pay for you because he
[1:26:52] thought you were unworthy. He didn't pay
[1:26:55] for you because he didn't think you
[1:26:57] could overcome. He didn't pay for you
[1:27:00] because he didn't have enough grace and
[1:27:03] enough mercy and enough power to change
[1:27:09] you. He paid for a
[1:27:12] bride. Not only that, he paid for her
[1:27:17] healing. They say the Sha of
[1:27:20] Iran, he every place he went, there was
[1:27:23] two planes. the one he was on that had a
[1:27:27] full kitchen and a maid and a full staff
[1:27:30] and everything and a second plane which
[1:27:33] was a full
[1:27:36] hospital 100% surgery hospital medical
[1:27:40] doctors brain surgeons heart surgeons
[1:27:43] and
[1:27:44] everything he wanted to live as long as
[1:27:47] he could at that time he was considered
[1:27:49] the richest man in the world and
[1:27:52] yet when Jesus Jesus bought
[1:27:55] us. He paid for our
[1:28:00] healing. He didn't just buy you to so
[1:28:02] you He bought your
[1:28:04] healing. You know, he didn't buy you to
[1:28:07] lose you. He bought eternal life for
[1:28:10] you. You understand? He paid a price to
[1:28:13] get something in return. But it wasn't
[1:28:15] for
[1:28:16] himself. It was for you that you would
[1:28:19] have eternal life. He bought eternal
[1:28:21] life for you. He bought healing for you.
[1:28:24] He br he brought it in invisible union
[1:28:26] between you and him for you. He bought
[1:28:29] it for you. He bought eternal life. He
[1:28:31] bought joy and peace
[1:28:35] and all the fruits of the spirit.
[1:28:39] And he bought the
[1:28:41] right to cleanse you so he could dwell
[1:28:45] in you and you and him could become one.
[1:28:51] It wasn't. He didn't just he he he just
[1:28:55] didn't uh uh go there with a big hope.
[1:29:01] So he didn't die on the cross and say,
[1:29:05] "Oh, I just hope people have pity on
[1:29:08] me and whoever believes in
[1:29:11] me, they'll come to
[1:29:14] me."
[1:29:16] Huh? Well, we were yet sinners. He died
[1:29:20] for us. All the Father hath given me
[1:29:23] will come. All that I pay for will
[1:29:27] come. I will not lose a one. My sheep
[1:29:31] will hear my voice and another they
[1:29:33] won't follow. That's what he paid
[1:29:36] for. So you think you get what you paid
[1:29:39] for? Well, what is Jesus getting for
[1:29:42] what he paid
[1:29:44] for? He didn't pay for nothing.
[1:29:51] Right? He didn't just go to He didn't
[1:29:55] spend money 30 million for something
[1:29:58] that
[1:30:02] perishes. He didn't buy things that
[1:30:05] perish. He didn't He
[1:30:08] didn't
[1:30:09] invest in things that fail.
[1:30:15] You could pay
[1:30:16] $250,000 for a belt and it'll go out of
[1:30:20] style
[1:30:21] and if you wore that belt again,
[1:30:23] everybody would look at you and go, "Oh,
[1:30:25] what a old fogy belt." You know what you
[1:30:27] have to do? You have to buy next year's
[1:30:29] model. And what happens? They're just
[1:30:32] smart enough. They'll just raise next
[1:30:34] year's model just a price little higher.
[1:30:37] And why will you buy it? Because you
[1:30:39] don't want to lose your prestige. You
[1:30:41] don't want anybody to think that you
[1:30:43] don't have the money. You want to keep
[1:30:45] up with the incrowd.
[1:30:50] Prophet of God said it was a
[1:30:53] spirit. American
[1:30:55] spirit. What did he do? What did he pay?
[1:30:58] He paid to set us
[1:31:00] free. We don't have to worry about what
[1:31:02] we
[1:31:04] wear. We don't have to worry about where
[1:31:08] we're going. We don't have to worry
[1:31:11] about where we'll
[1:31:14] live because we got a
[1:31:17] mansion. We've got another
[1:31:20] city. We're just traveling through. We
[1:31:24] don't have to impress
[1:31:27] anybody. All we have to do is have the
[1:31:30] ticket in our
[1:31:33] heart, the seal. He
[1:31:37] paid that we could have the same spirit
[1:31:42] that was in him dwell in us. Isn't that
[1:31:46] what he said at the gate called
[1:31:48] beautiful? They said they they meant the
[1:31:50] one that gave him wine and honey. They
[1:31:53] walked with the one. They talked with
[1:31:54] the one. And they said, "And now they
[1:31:56] knew that he was with them." And he
[1:31:59] said, "Silver and gold have we none, but
[1:32:02] what we have?" What was better? and
[1:32:07] $490,000 pair of
[1:32:11] sunglasses that they could look at the
[1:32:13] guy and he'd be totally
[1:32:17] polarized or to say rise up and
[1:32:21] walk. That's the trouble. We live below
[1:32:24] our
[1:32:25] privilege because we don't put any value
[1:32:29] on the price.
[1:32:33] Which one of you would pay
[1:32:35] $490,000 for a son? Nobody. You value
[1:32:39] your
[1:32:42] money. You work too hard for it.
[1:32:47] And that's what he said. You know, you
[1:32:50] give an answer. And that's what he's
[1:32:52] saying. He He paid something for
[1:32:56] us and he didn't pay to lose. And if we
[1:33:01] could fight the
[1:33:02] battle that's going on in our minds
[1:33:05] right now, the battle that Satan is
[1:33:09] putting out in the world, the economy is
[1:33:12] going to fail. We're going to go into a
[1:33:15] depression. What's going to happen to my
[1:33:20] 401k? You know what I mean? We don't
[1:33:23] need a 401k. We need a John 3:16.
[1:33:29] We need an Acts 2:38.
[1:33:32] That's what we have to have. We need to
[1:33:34] invest
[1:33:36] in in heavenly things, in spiritual
[1:33:39] things. And we've got to realize that
[1:33:42] we've had somebody that was willing to
[1:33:46] invest everything that he was in us and
[1:33:51] purchase us and buy us and invest in us.
[1:33:56] And you don't think he's going to get
[1:33:58] the value out of his investment when he
[1:34:01] is the greatest investor of all time. He
[1:34:04] was the creator of heaven and earth.
[1:34:09] Oh my. We need to change our
[1:34:12] thinking. We need to get back on the
[1:34:15] positive side instead of doubting him.
[1:34:21] Because what did he say? We always want
[1:34:23] to be able to do something. We always
[1:34:25] got to pay for
[1:34:28] it. We pay for our sins by beating
[1:34:31] ourselves down
[1:34:33] instead of just saying, "Lord, you said
[1:34:37] if I would confess it, you would be
[1:34:40] faithful and just to forgive it. You
[1:34:44] paid for that
[1:34:45] privilege. You paid for the
[1:34:49] right for me to say I'm sorry and have
[1:34:53] you forgive me.
[1:34:57] Everything we got, he paid for.
[1:35:05] I remember one time, I don't mean to
[1:35:07] tell on you, Matthew, but one time
[1:35:09] Matthew went out and bought a gallon of
[1:35:10] milk and he put it in our refrigerator
[1:35:13] and he wrote Matthew's milk.
[1:35:16] So, I got a sticky pad. Dad's butter,
[1:35:20] dad's bread, dad's sugar, dad's jelly,
[1:35:24] dad's peanut butter, dad's
[1:35:27] silverware, dad's pots, dad's pan, dad's
[1:35:30] bed, dad's house, dad's
[1:35:38] car. I think after I think he was happy
[1:35:41] to let me use a little cup of milk for
[1:35:44] my bowl of cereal.
[1:35:47] Well, look at
[1:35:49] us. Everything's paid for.
[1:35:53] And yet we want to claim stuff. We want
[1:35:56] to hold on to stuff that's of no value.
[1:36:01] Show me your sunglasses. I'll show you
[1:36:03] my
[1:36:04] $490,000. Your sunglasses look like rags
[1:36:07] to me.
[1:36:08] your jeans. I wouldn't wear those $30.
[1:36:12] Can you get a pair of jeans for $30?
[1:36:14] Maybe at
[1:36:17] Costco. I wouldn't wear no red head
[1:36:20] jeans
[1:36:22] or my jeans are a million7,
[1:36:27] baby.
[1:36:29] Worthless. Worthless. We hang on to
[1:36:33] things that are worthless. Things we
[1:36:35] didn't even pay for. things that won't
[1:36:38] last, things that aren't eternal. And
[1:36:41] everything he bought for us is so that
[1:36:44] we can have a character that we can
[1:36:46] enjoy heaven when we get there. Cuz the
[1:36:49] only thing we'll take with us is our
[1:36:51] character,
[1:36:54] when we can trust in
[1:36:56] them. I'll tell you, Tuesday night was a
[1:36:59] great prayer
[1:37:02] meeting. Just sacrifice on Tuesday night
[1:37:05] once a month. Come out and give the Lord
[1:37:07] an hour of
[1:37:09] prayer. Too
[1:37:11] busy. You know, he paid that hour for
[1:37:15] you. He'll take care of your work. He'll
[1:37:19] take care of your jobs. He'll take care
[1:37:21] of your
[1:37:22] bills. He already paid for it. He gets
[1:37:26] what he pays
[1:37:29] for. We forget he did the paying. We
[1:37:34] forget what he bought. We forget what he
[1:37:37] invested in. We forget who he is and
[1:37:41] what he can
[1:37:44] do and he didn't buy
[1:37:47] junk and he didn't make a bad
[1:37:50] investment. When he went to Calvary, he
[1:37:53] invested in my eternal
[1:37:55] life and now I want him to transform me.
[1:37:58] And that's what he said. What America
[1:38:00] needs is they need the change of the
[1:38:02] Holy Spirit in their heart. We need to
[1:38:06] get the spirit of God back in our heart.
[1:38:08] We need to get the thinking of God back
[1:38:11] in our minds and we won't be enticed and
[1:38:15] discouraged. Not that we're
[1:38:17] enticed, but we get discouraged by a
[1:38:21] failing
[1:38:23] world. And yet, we got a better world
[1:38:26] that's been purchased for
[1:38:27] us. I go to prepare for you a mansion.
[1:38:31] In my father's house are many mansion. I
[1:38:34] would not tell you so if it wasn't true.
[1:38:38] And if I go, I will come again and
[1:38:41] receive you that you will be where I am
[1:38:46] also. He paid for
[1:38:49] that. He paid for the right to say that.
[1:38:52] He paid for the right to promise
[1:38:56] that. And he don't have one promise that
[1:39:01] fails. Think of it.
[1:39:04] the next
[1:39:05] time you're up against it and ask
[1:39:09] yourself, did Jesus
[1:39:11] pay for my
[1:39:14] deliverance? Does he get what he pays
[1:39:19] for? And he paid that we can have the
[1:39:22] Holy Spirit. If you don't have the
[1:39:24] spirit of God living in your heart, it's
[1:39:28] been
[1:39:29] paid for you to have it.
[1:39:33] If you don't have the
[1:39:35] joy of the Lord, that joy has been paid
[1:39:42] for. It's
[1:39:44] yours. All you got to do is pick it up.
[1:39:47] All you've got to go and ask for it.
[1:39:50] Say, "Lord, I heard that you paid for my
[1:39:54] healing, and it wasn't three million. It
[1:39:57] wasn't 30 million. It was more.
[1:40:03] You didn't even have to taste
[1:40:05] death, but yet you were willing to pay
[1:40:08] the price of death for my
[1:40:12] healing. I just want what you purchased
[1:40:14] for me.
[1:40:17] When we start
[1:40:20] changing and start taking the purchase
[1:40:23] power of Jesus
[1:40:26] Christ and using it to drive Satan back,
[1:40:31] possess his gates and claim our promises
[1:40:35] because it's paid for ground. And when
[1:40:37] Jesus told them, "Every place that you
[1:40:40] put your feet is possession." And every
[1:40:43] step was
[1:40:44] possession because they had a promise.
[1:40:48] It was paid
[1:40:51] for. Even Pharaoh paid for their
[1:40:56] promised land with his kingdom, with his
[1:40:59] soldiers. He was raised up into honor
[1:41:02] just so God could show his mighty hand.
[1:41:05] That's how much he paid for
[1:41:07] Israel. Think of you, his
[1:41:13] bride. He paid for you. And if he's
[1:41:16] going to get what he paid for, he's
[1:41:18] going to get that
[1:41:20] bride. And all you've got to say is, "Am
[1:41:22] I paid for?" Satan's going to say,
[1:41:25] "You're not, but he say he did." All you
[1:41:28] got to do is look at that cross and know
[1:41:31] he hung on there for you. and then look
[1:41:34] at that empty grave and know that he's
[1:41:37] alive to claim everything that's his.
[1:41:43] Everything that he purchased to bring to
[1:41:45] pass everything that he paid for. He
[1:41:48] paid for your healing. He's not going to
[1:41:50] lose it. He paid for your deliverance.
[1:41:54] It's not going to be taken for from him.
[1:41:59] he will
[1:42:01] get what he paid for. Do you believe
[1:42:04] that? Let's let that sink in our minds.
[1:42:08] Let's let that sink in our hearts. Let's
[1:42:11] let that get to the place where we can
[1:42:13] realize when we wake up, wait a minute,
[1:42:16] my day has been paid for. What did you
[1:42:20] pay for today for me, Lord?
[1:42:27] I gave a person a gift card one time. I
[1:42:30] say, "It's already paid for. All you got
[1:42:33] to do is take the gift card and go down.
[1:42:37] It's
[1:42:38] already paid
[1:42:41] for. You wanted this jacket. I couldn't
[1:42:46] give it to you. Here it is. It's already
[1:42:48] paid for. All you got to do is take the
[1:42:51] gift card and bring it down there. It's
[1:42:53] already paid for." and pick it out and
[1:42:55] try it on. Walk away with it. You know
[1:42:57] what h gets too
[1:43:00] busy. It's not important anymore. Other
[1:43:04] things are important like working and
[1:43:08] sleeping in. And then what happens? He
[1:43:11] loses the gift
[1:43:12] card. And
[1:43:14] then it's never claimed and it's never
[1:43:18] cashed.
[1:43:21] That's okay with
[1:43:22] me because I'm the kind of guy you just
[1:43:25] won't get another
[1:43:28] one. But the Lord, he gives you a
[1:43:33] gift and you just throw it
[1:43:36] away and you don't use it after he gave
[1:43:39] his life for it. You don't ever take his
[1:43:42] healing. You never take his deliverance.
[1:43:44] You never take the invite to have his
[1:43:47] spirit come into your heart and change
[1:43:49] your spirit, change your
[1:43:52] nature. You don't have to do anything
[1:43:55] for it. It's what our prophet said. It's
[1:43:58] without price. It's without money. He
[1:44:00] paid for it. All you've got to do is use
[1:44:04] it, accept it. But maybe you don't think
[1:44:08] that what he paid for is good enough for
[1:44:11] your sins.
[1:44:13] Well, if you're a greater sinner than he
[1:44:16] is a
[1:44:18] savior, I pity your
[1:44:21] understanding of the
[1:44:24] market. The wages of sin, which is
[1:44:28] unbelief, is death. But the gift of God
[1:44:32] is eternal life through Christ Jesus.
[1:44:36] Paid for. Eternal life.
[1:44:41] paid for. Never to
[1:44:44] die. Paid
[1:44:46] for a new body. Paid
[1:44:51] for. He's going to get what he pays for.
[1:44:55] Somebody is going to accept the fact
[1:44:59] that he paid for it. And when you
[1:45:03] do,
[1:45:06] nothing can stand in your way.
[1:45:09] You've just got to decide in your
[1:45:13] heart, am I going to accept what he
[1:45:17] purchased for me? And that was the sin
[1:45:21] of
[1:45:22] America. They refused to accept what he
[1:45:27] paid for. Let's not let that be our
[1:45:30] sin. Let us go forward. Let us find the
[1:45:34] path
[1:45:35] forward that's based on a faith for the
[1:45:40] journey. Jesus bought this for me. I
[1:45:45] need it. And the prophet of God said he
[1:45:47] went to that uh what in in brother
[1:45:50] Brandham's day they called it a colored
[1:45:52] church. Today they might call it a black
[1:45:55] church. One time it was
[1:45:58] AfricanAmerican. You know, you never
[1:45:59] could make people happy.
[1:46:02] But we don't have
[1:46:04] that. We're
[1:46:06] bride. We're
[1:46:08] purchased. We're the purchased
[1:46:11] possession of the blood of the lamb.
[1:46:14] There's no big guys. There's no little
[1:46:17] use. We've all got the same benefits.
[1:46:20] We've all got the same thing. And if
[1:46:23] you're outside of those
[1:46:25] benefits, all you have to do is ask. We
[1:46:30] have not because we ask not. And we ask
[1:46:34] not because we believe not. Don't
[1:46:38] continue struggling and trying to pay
[1:46:41] for it yourself when he already paid for
[1:46:44] it for you. He loves you. He will not
[1:46:48] lose you. All the father hath given me
[1:46:51] will come. And I won't lose a one. I
[1:46:54] hope you hear the call on your heart.
[1:46:58] There's nothing like
[1:47:00] living for him. But it's even better to
[1:47:05] live by him. A lot of people try to live
[1:47:09] for him, but those that are victorious
[1:47:12] live by him. By the exceedingly great
[1:47:16] and precious promises that he purchased
[1:47:19] by his divine blood. All that the father
[1:47:23] hath given me will come. All that I
[1:47:26] have, I give unto you. Fear not, little
[1:47:30] flock. It's the father's good pleasure
[1:47:32] to give you the kingdom. God bless you.
[1:47:35] Musicians, come. Brother
[1:47:48] Billy. Amen. Aren't you glad it paid for
[1:47:51] it? Man, that's all standth.
[1:47:55] Key of
[1:47:59] C. He paid a
[1:48:03] debt. It did not. Oh, I owe a debt. I
[1:48:11] could not pay. I
[1:48:14] needed
[1:48:16] someone to wash my sins away.
[1:48:24] Oh, I now sing a brand new song. Oh,
[1:48:32] amazing
[1:48:33] grace. All day long, Christ
[1:48:38] Jesus made a debt that I could never
[1:48:44] pay.
[1:48:47] Oh, he paid a day at
[1:48:53] Calvary. He cleans my soul has set me
[1:48:59] free. I'm glad that
[1:49:02] Jesus
[1:49:05] all my sins are.
[1:49:10] Oh, I now can sing a brand new song.
[1:49:17] It's
[1:49:18] amazing
[1:49:20] grace. All day long, Christ Jesus made a
[1:49:27] debt that I could never pay.
[1:49:34] Oh, one day he's coming back for me till
[1:49:42] everything
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:45] eternally. What if we
[1:49:49] glory? Oh, and to sing him on that day.
[1:49:57] Oh, I will sing a brand new song and
[1:50:04] amazing
[1:50:08] grace. Christ Jesus paid a debt that I
[1:50:15] could
[1:50:16] never sing that first verse again.
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:23] Oh, he did not know
[1:50:32] I
[1:50:33] needed
[1:50:36] someone to wash my s away.
[1:50:43] Oh, and now I see a brand new song. It's
[1:50:50] amazing
[1:50:52] grace. All day long. Christ
[1:50:57] Jesus, the debt that I could never pay.
[1:51:07] Oh, every promise in the book is
[1:51:12] mine. Oh, every chapter, every verse,
[1:51:17] every
[1:51:18] heart. Oh, and I am trusting in his
[1:51:24] love. Oh, and every promise in the book.
[1:51:31] Oh, and every promise in the book is
[1:51:37] mine. Oh, every chapter, every verse in
[1:51:43] every Oh, and I am trusting his
[1:51:50] love. Oh, and every promise in the book.
[1:51:55] Just sing it one more time. Oh, and
[1:51:58] every promise in the book is
[1:52:02] mine. Oh, and every chapter, every
[1:52:06] verse, every heart. All that I am
[1:52:11] trusting in his

[1:52:21] mine.
[1:52:23] Hallelu. Amen. financial glad. It's not
[1:52:26] up to us. It's up to what he done. Amen.
[1:52:29] That we could certainly rest upon that.
[1:52:32] Amen. We'll invite brother Tommy. I know
[1:52:34] being the inspiration of the service. We
[1:52:36] want to just invite him to come and
[1:52:39] close the service tonight. Certainly
[1:52:41] enjoy the word. Amen.
[1:52:52] Yeah. Let's just bow our hearts.
[1:52:56] Dear heavenly father, Lord,
[1:52:59] we Lord, we're grateful, Lord, knowing
[1:53:02] that you did pay the ultimate price for
[1:53:04] us,
[1:53:05] Lord. Lord, there's nothing can replace
[1:53:08] that, Lord. Lord, to know you is to have
[1:53:13] life, Lord. And we're grateful for what
[1:53:15] you've done in our lives, Lord. And to
[1:53:18] be able to see the contrast and know
[1:53:22] that you've touched our lives, Lord, is
[1:53:24] is precious in itself,
[1:53:27] Lord. Lord,
[1:53:30] I know that just looking in my own
[1:53:34] perspective of my life, Lord, and what
[1:53:37] you've done in my life, Lord, I'm just
[1:53:39] grateful for that, Lord. And Lord, I
[1:53:41] know there's many others here that have
[1:53:44] had the same touch in their lives, Lord.
[1:53:47] Even the pastor, Lord, is
[1:53:51] he's came from a background, Lord. And
[1:53:56] knowing that he's gone through things
[1:53:58] that even I myself have similar
[1:54:01] situations, Lord. And Lord, I have much
[1:54:05] respect, Lord, for the pastor and the
[1:54:09] what he's done with this congregation
[1:54:12] and this church, Lord. And Lord, we
[1:54:15] thank you for providing him to us, Lord.
[1:54:18] And Lord, we're so grateful, Lord, for
[1:54:21] the word that you gave this evening,
[1:54:24] Lord. I I can't take no honor in that,
[1:54:28] Lord. And it's just a conversation,
[1:54:30] Lord. And Lord, I was
[1:54:34] just standing at my truck, Lord, and you
[1:54:37] just you gave me something, Lord. And I
[1:54:41] don't know why Brother David chose to
[1:54:44] preach on it, but Lord,
[1:54:46] I thank you for the revelation that you
[1:54:49] gave me, Lord.
[1:54:51] And Lord, I continue, Lord, to grow and
[1:54:58] come to better understanding, Lord, of
[1:55:00] what you're doing. in my life. And Lord,

[1:55:07] And Lord, I thank you, Lord, for once
[1:55:10] again for just bringing me to this
[1:55:13] little church. And to know each one of
[1:55:16] these people here, Lord, is an honor.
[1:55:18] Lord, there's many brothers and sisters
[1:55:20] here that I've grown to come to love in
[1:55:26] ways that I never thought I could love
[1:55:28] people. And Lord, I thank you for
[1:55:32] that. Lord, we're continue
[1:55:35] to look forward to what you have for us,
[1:55:38] Lord. And Lord, I just pray your

[1:55:49] our hearts, Lord. We love you and thank
