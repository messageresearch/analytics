[37:13] standing in the realm where all things
[37:14] are possible
[37:17] where we don't have to stay that way any
[37:19] longer
[37:20] because you've made a Divine appointment
[37:22] to come by our way this evening
[37:25] so Lord we're looking to that not what
[37:27] man can do
[37:29] Lord your Prophet told us that we must
[37:31] Master the thought of human ability Lord
[37:35] we move away from that whatever and
[37:38] however we thought the service should go
[37:41] or would go now we look to the
[37:43] supernatural
[37:45] and we place ourselves into thy Loving
[37:47] Hands
[37:48] that you would do what only you could do
[37:50] and break the bread of life to your
[37:51] people
[37:53] in Jesus Christ's name we commit
[37:55] ourselves
[37:57] amen amen such just a wonderful presence
[38:00] let's just turn in our Bibles
[38:03] to Leviticus chapter 23.
[38:16] we'll be reading verse 36 and then we'll
[38:18] also turn to
[38:20] Hebrews
[38:22] chapter 4 verse 9.
[38:25] if I'm able to get any more monitor I'll
[38:27] take it
[38:31] Leviticus 23
[38:34] and verse 36.
[38:38] seven days ye shall offer an offering
[38:41] made by fire unto the Lord
[38:44] on the eighth day
[38:46] shall be Unholy convocation unto you
[38:51] and ye shall offer an offering made by
[38:54] fire unto the Lord and it is a solemn
[38:56] assembly and you shall do no servile
[38:59] work
[39:00] therein and let's just turn to Hebrews
[39:02] chapter 4
[39:10] read verse 9 through 12.
[39:13] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[39:17] people of God
[39:19] for he that is entered into his rest
[39:22] he also has ceased from his own works
[39:27] as God did from his
[39:31] let us labor therefore to enter into
[39:33] that rest lest any man fall after the
[39:37] same example of unbelief
[39:40] for the word of God is quick and
[39:42] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[39:44] sword piercing even to the dividing
[39:47] asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the
[39:50] joints and Marrow and as a discerner
[39:53] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[39:56] amen we just asked a blessing upon the
[39:58] word you may be seated
[40:02] just want to read a quote out of
[40:04] the future home of the Heavenly
[40:06] bridegroom
[40:08] and the Earthly brine and the prophet of
[40:11] God would say this notice the Eighth Day
[40:13] Jesus raised
[40:15] for our justification
[40:17] the Eternal King with the Eternal
[40:20] Kingdom to be baptized into to eternal
[40:23] life not seven days had nothing to do
[40:27] with any of the days it's speaking of
[40:30] another
[40:31] Eternal coming speaking of an eternal
[40:35] time the world that I'm speaking of and
[40:38] notice after 50 days
[40:41] or seven sabbaths from there again there
[40:44] come another holy convocation
[40:47] what happened the Holy Ghost fell on the
[40:50] day of Pentecost on the seventh day or
[40:53] the Eighth Day rather Eighth Day fell on
[40:56] the eighth day was seventh Sabbath later
[40:59] exactly after his resurrection see it'd
[41:02] be seven times that again bringing it
[41:04] right back around to the first day of
[41:06] the week again exactly see there is your
[41:09] holy convocation not having anything to
[41:13] do with the literal things it's beyond
[41:16] that it's the kingdom of God with
[41:20] eternal life with the predestinated that
[41:23] never did start now now he's speaking to
[41:26] somebody here so start seeing yourself
[41:28] in the word and in the scriptures
[41:30] because the Lord is speaking to you
[41:32] right now he says with the predestinated
[41:34] that never did start it never started on
[41:37] any day you wasn't saved on any day
[41:40] come on a lot of people will say I was
[41:42] saved this day or that no you weren't
[41:44] you a matter of fact you being saved had
[41:47] nothing to do with what you could do it
[41:50] was something that he did and had
[41:51] already done before you even showed up
[41:53] on the scene you were saved
[41:56] you always saved amen Jesus just come to
[42:01] redeem that but you were saved from the
[42:03] beginning
[42:04] because you had eternal life to begin
[42:07] with and I just pray the Lord would help
[42:10] me this evening I want to speak to you
[42:11] tonight on breaking into eternity well I
[42:15] think that's just our heart's desire as
[42:17] Believers we want to break into eternity
[42:20] we want to break out of this flesh we
[42:22] want to break out of this world we want
[42:24] to break out of our ideas and the waves
[42:26] of man and how bound down we are by the
[42:28] ways of thinking in our jobs and and our
[42:31] intellectual understanding of the
[42:33] measures I want to break out and into
[42:35] something you know I was kind of
[42:37] thinking of something as I thought along
[42:38] the way you know when a drug addict
[42:40] really starts to wanting something you
[42:42] know they'll do whatever it takes
[42:44] they'll deceive the doctor they'll
[42:46] deceive their neighbors they'll deceive
[42:47] their family they'll try to deceive
[42:49] everybody they want to but because they
[42:51] want something they got to have
[42:53] something they'll even break into a
[42:55] building they'll break into a store
[42:56] they'll break into their mama's house
[42:58] they'll break into their daddy's house
[42:59] they'll do whatever they want to do
[43:01] because there's something inside of them
[43:03] that is hungering crying out and they
[43:06] know they gotta get something to be able
[43:08] to exchange it for the thing that
[43:10] they're crying out for so they'll break
[43:12] into things I say my if a drug addict
[43:14] can get to a place where they're so
[43:16] addicted to meth or alcohol or or drugs
[43:19] or pills and something like that that
[43:21] they're willing to do all of these
[43:22] things how much more should we be
[43:24] willing to lay down the cares of life
[43:26] and to lay down our jobs and lay down
[43:28] our thoughts lay down our ideas and get
[43:30] to a place where we can sell out Lock
[43:32] Stock and Barrel for the message of the
[43:34] iron and say I want to break into
[43:36] something all that I've never seen
[43:38] before I want to break into the
[43:39] supernatural
[43:41] what I was going to try to stay calm
[43:43] this evening but it just doesn't work
[43:44] for me but breaking into eternity you
[43:47] know eternity is something that's really
[43:50] hard to understand or to describe you
[43:53] know if we were to have the conversation
[43:54] it just sounds uh you can't oh well you
[43:58] know once we get to Eternity what
[44:00] happens after a billion trillion good
[44:02] zillion years well we'll just keep going
[44:04] on but then after a billion trillion a
[44:07] million years more uh will we then know
[44:10] all about God no it'll just keep going
[44:13] on and and so eternity talking about
[44:16] breaking into eternity you know it's
[44:18] just something really hard
[44:21] for us mortal men
[44:25] to really understand what we're talking
[44:27] about
[44:29] as the writer would pin these words
[44:32] concerning Melchizedek
[44:35] he would say that without father without
[44:38] mother without dissent having neither
[44:41] beginning of days nor end of life but
[44:43] made like unto the Son of God abideth a
[44:46] priest continually you see Jesus Christ
[44:49] was from eternity to Eternity
[44:51] and there's only one form of eternal
[44:54] life and that eternal life is gone and
[44:57] those Eternal thoughts of God took form
[45:00] in Jesus Christ and now that same
[45:04] eternal life is taking form in a many
[45:06] membered body called The Bride of Jesus
[45:09] Christ as brother Brandon would say like
[45:12] this for you are only the physical
[45:14] manifestation of the attributes that was
[45:17] in God at the beginning my what a
[45:20] statement you are only the physical
[45:23] manifestation of the attributes that was
[45:25] in God at the beginning while we just
[45:28] run straight over that quote and say
[45:29] glory to God but oh why don't we stay
[45:32] there a little while and chew on it and
[45:33] really catch what the mind of God is
[45:35] trying to tell you that the way that you
[45:37] showed up in the form that you are now
[45:40] there is something that you possess on
[45:42] the inside of you that is an eternal
[45:44] quality they didn't come from man it
[45:46] didn't come from your mama it didn't
[45:48] come from your daddy but there's
[45:49] something that you are possessing it
[45:51] didn't come when the wild was created
[45:53] but it was back there back in the mind
[45:55] of God you are Eternal and those Eternal
[45:58] thoughts are now taken on flesh in your
[46:01] body
[46:03] for you are only the physical
[46:05] manifestation of the attributes that was
[46:08] in God at the beginning for there's only
[46:10] one form of eternal life and that was
[46:12] you before
[46:15] there's only one form of eternal life
[46:17] and that was you before
[46:20] you don't know nothing about it
[46:33] time
[46:34] is with men
[46:37] eternity
[46:38] is with God
[46:40] but you see we bypassed our theophany
[46:43] into a Time body
[46:46] but now this great mystery this secret
[46:48] that God had in his mind from the very
[46:51] beginning
[46:52] this threefold purpose that he wanted to
[46:55] express himself in Jesus Christ
[46:58] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[47:01] then he wanted to have the preeminence
[47:02] in the bride now all that was in God he
[47:07] poured into Christ and all that was in
[47:09] Christ he poured into the bride
[47:13] that Eternal form that logos taking on
[47:17] form in you
[47:19] and then what was it to restore the
[47:21] kingdom to go back to Eden again husband
[47:25] and wife to spend eternity together
[47:29] so we just look into our text here and
[47:31] what is a holy convocation in the Old
[47:34] Testament we read these scriptures of
[47:37] levigans 23 3 if you want to put that up
[47:40] there or turn in your Bibles because we
[47:43] were reading there are no text in Levi
[47:45] get US 23 verse 26 maybe it would just
[47:48] walk through this for a second here but
[47:50] Leviticus 23 3 says six days shall work
[47:53] be done
[47:54] but the seventh day
[47:56] is the Sabbath of rest Unholy
[47:59] convocation you shall do no work therein
[48:02] it is a Sabbath of the Lord in all your
[48:05] dwellings
[48:07] now we know that the Lord Worked six
[48:10] days
[48:11] and on the seventh day he rested
[48:18] and so as we look into the scriptures we
[48:20] we must realize that everything in the
[48:23] Old Testament is a type and a shadow
[48:27] it it's foretelling something that God
[48:30] was wanting to achieve or that God was
[48:33] wanting to accomplish
[48:36] it's a type it's a shadow
[48:39] it's something that was in the past
[48:41] foreshadowing what was going to come
[48:45] and I was thinking about you know I look
[48:47] back and when I first met my wife and
[48:49] and and you know then we started talking
[48:52] and and oh I I just loved those phone
[48:55] calls and being able to spend time with
[48:57] her on the phone and then you finally be
[48:59] able to travel and see one another but
[49:02] uh but we we had to have the beginning
[49:05] so that we could have what we have now
[49:10] see we can't have what we have now
[49:12] without the beginning
[49:14] but I don't want to trade what I have
[49:16] now for something in the past
[49:19] I don't want to give up what I have now
[49:21] and go back to courting
[49:24] I I don't wanna I don't want to leave
[49:26] what I have now but see we got to look
[49:28] into the scriptures and we got to see
[49:30] the types we got to see the Shadows
[49:32] because many times if we're not built up
[49:34] properly if we're not students of the
[49:37] word you realize that that that that
[49:38] that that Jesus Christ was the fullness
[49:41] of the word the very word was speaking
[49:44] of the Messiah or the word that was
[49:46] going to come and take on form
[49:49] and the whole new testament like it or
[49:52] not has been in a testifying of
[49:55] something that was coming at the end
[49:57] time Malachi 4 5 was a prophetic word
[50:00] saying of something that was going to
[50:02] come at the end time and then when it
[50:05] was time for the physical manifestation
[50:07] it took on form
[50:11] but you couldn't have that without what
[50:14] was the shadow of it
[50:16] without the word speaking out behold I
[50:20] will send you Elijah the prophet there
[50:23] is no Elijah Prophet to come because the
[50:25] word wasn't uttered
[50:28] so then we need to look into the
[50:29] scriptures and be students of the word
[50:31] and understand these things six days
[50:33] shall work be done but the seventh day
[50:35] is a Sabbath arrest a holy convocation
[50:38] what is a holy convocation you shall do
[50:41] no work therein it is a Sabbath of the
[50:43] Lord in all your dwellings
[50:47] well I think right there maybe we could
[50:49] preach a little while in all your
[50:50] dwellings
[50:52] your car
[50:53] your house
[50:55] your heart right that's where the
[50:57] dwelling is
[50:59] it's in your heart in your life and this
[51:01] Temple don't you know thou has a body
[51:04] prepared for me
[51:09] a holy convocation
[51:13] so you can't have
[51:16] the greater meaning without having what
[51:19] was first
[51:20] so just look into Genesis chapter 1 and
[51:24] verse 14 as as you we're reading about a
[51:28] holy convocation in six days and and we
[51:31] would get this law and everything put in
[51:33] order but to really start to understand
[51:35] those things when you look into the
[51:36] Bible into Genesis 1 14 he would start
[51:39] to speak about how let there be uh
[51:42] lights in the heavens
[51:45] and in the Famine of the heaven to
[51:47] divide the day from the night and let
[51:49] them be for signs and for seasons and
[51:52] for days and for years you see God
[51:54] wasn't just creating a beautiful world
[51:56] for no purpose but even in his creation
[51:58] even in the setting of the sun and the
[52:01] setting of the stars and the way that he
[52:03] formed and created everything uh the the
[52:06] the the sun and the moon and the stars
[52:09] they were for signs and they were for
[52:11] seasons and they were for days and they
[52:13] were for years and it would go on and he
[52:15] would say oh let there be two lights of
[52:17] the greater light will rule the day and
[52:19] then the Lesser light will rule the
[52:21] night and then right there you see the
[52:24] very expression of God displaying
[52:26] husband and wife right there in creation
[52:28] oh let the sun and let the moon be a
[52:31] declaration let it be a sign of a union
[52:34] that the moon doesn't give off our own
[52:36] light it only gives off the light of the
[52:38] Sun what are we reflecting in this hour
[52:41] We're Not reflecting man's ideas we're
[52:43] reflecting the very mind a very light
[52:46] the very life oh Christ has come in this
[52:49] generation the greatest light that's
[52:51] ever shown unto man and this bride is
[52:53] now the reflector
[52:56] as the prophet was the great reflector
[52:59] of the word now the veil has been taken
[53:01] away our eyes have come open and we see
[53:04] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[53:06] and forever and now that word becomes in
[53:09] us and we are now that great reflector
[53:11] in this hour
[53:14] so just continuing on Olivia's 23
[53:24] in the 14th day
[53:27] thank you brother of the first month
[53:29] that even is the Lord's Passover
[53:32] so we want to know these things it says
[53:34] in the 14th day of the first month at
[53:38] evening is the Lord's Passover
[53:40] and on the 15th day of the same month as
[53:42] the Feast of unleavened bread unto the
[53:44] Lord Seven Days ye must eat unleavened
[53:47] bread
[53:49] so right here it says in the first month
[53:52] well you know where we get the word
[53:53] month from we get it from Moon
[53:56] because a month was a new moon
[54:00] so months means new moon and the Hebrew
[54:03] calendar is a lunar calendar we go by a
[54:06] solstice calendar which is which is
[54:08] depicted by the Sun and therefore we
[54:11] have 365 days in a year but when you go
[54:13] by the lunar calendar you have
[54:16] approximately 359 days in a year 29 and
[54:19] a half days in a month is what they say
[54:21] and it's going by a lunar calendar and
[54:24] then what we think the first of the year
[54:25] is it's not in January but the first of
[54:28] the year is in a bib or it's in Nissan
[54:30] or it's it's in the new moon the first
[54:33] of the year during the springtime and so
[54:36] a new moon if you look at the Hebrew
[54:38] calendar there's 12 moons a year right a
[54:41] new moon there the 12 months in a year
[54:43] if a new moon is a it's a new month if
[54:45] you could just say a new month or new
[54:46] moon now you can start looking in the
[54:48] scriptures and when you see a new moon
[54:49] understand that they were going by the
[54:52] lunar calendar there's 12 new moves
[54:53] sometimes I guess there's 13 moons in a
[54:55] year but I don't I don't get into all
[54:57] that stuff but I just go with with how
[54:59] it's unfolding and you can see 12 moons
[55:01] 12 new moons a month
[55:03] New Moon everybody with me
[55:06] so the first month the new moon so he's
[55:08] given uh uh he's given the word here and
[55:11] saying in the 14th day of the first
[55:13] month Addie is even the Lord's supper
[55:16] and then the following day would be the
[55:18] unleavened bread
[55:19] so you look and you can jump back into
[55:21] Exodus 13 and that's when Moses would
[55:24] call it a b i b I don't know how to say
[55:26] abib however you say that Habib
[55:30] anybody want to help me out on it
[55:33] no takers
[55:36] so but that was April
[55:40] so don't when he says the the first
[55:42] month of the year that's April and and
[55:44] if you look at what it means it means
[55:46] the it means uh The Barley ears it means
[55:49] the ears of of The Barley are now coming
[55:51] to to harvest they're starting to Green
[55:54] so you start to get a picture and an
[55:56] understanding of the signs and the times
[55:58] and and why God put these these uh
[56:01] lights and these uh stars and the moon
[56:04] up there for times and seasons and now
[56:06] he's given his ordinances and you have
[56:09] to know the times and the season to know
[56:12] what the word that's going to be carried
[56:14] out is
[56:16] so now the prophet is telling them look
[56:18] when it's a new moon
[56:20] when it's the first month of the year on
[56:23] the 14th day this is the Commandment of
[56:26] the Lord
[56:31] and so if some of you that want to study
[56:33] that down a little bit
[56:34] it it changed they they now call it
[56:37] Nissan NIS a n or n i s s a n and
[56:41] they've they since the uh Israel was
[56:43] carried away into Babylon that they
[56:46] don't use the Hebrew name for it anymore
[56:47] I kind of thought that profound uh but
[56:50] if you're studying in your Bible and
[56:52] you're into Exodus and you see uh Moses
[56:54] call it a bib then you'll find out later
[56:56] they are carried away into captivity and
[56:58] I believe that's when they started
[56:59] adapting the word uh Nissan so when you
[57:02] go and even study it now if you're
[57:04] wanting to look in and try to find the
[57:05] Hebrew calendar and things you'll you'll
[57:07] find out some of those things but but so
[57:10] you had you in when you start to look
[57:12] through Leviticus now what's starting to
[57:14] happen here is is the prophet is laying
[57:16] out that there's going to be seven fish
[57:18] days
[57:19] and so he starts to lay out the order
[57:22] and the times and the seasons of when
[57:24] these things were to be carried out
[57:26] you're going to have a a Seven Feast
[57:28] Davis you have seven feast days the
[57:30] Passover unleavened bread first fruits
[57:33] Pentecost trumpets atonement
[57:37] Tabernacles
[57:39] all of these feast days these were all
[57:42] prophetic types
[57:44] so when you look into the Bible and you
[57:47] see Moses talking about oh uh it's going
[57:50] to be on the 14th day of the first month
[57:53] you're going to have it's going to be
[57:55] the Passover it's going to be the Feast
[57:57] of the Passover well well what was that
[58:00] for and then on the 15th day it's going
[58:02] to be the Feast of unleavened bread
[58:03] these wasn't just ordinances and works
[58:07] that God was giving to the children of
[58:09] Israel to carry out but they were
[58:11] prophetic
[58:12] they were prophetic ordinances that were
[58:15] giving as a shadow of something that was
[58:18] to come
[58:21] what was the Feast of the Passover it
[58:24] was the Passover Lamb where they came
[58:25] out of Egypt in the month of April and
[58:27] it was testifying of our Passover Lamb
[58:30] the Lord Jesus Christ that would come
[58:32] and pay the penalty for sin so we could
[58:35] be free once and for all who the son of
[58:38] man has made free is free indeed oh by
[58:41] one sacrifice
[58:42] we don't need a man to keep going year
[58:45] after year and offering a sacrifice oh
[58:47] but when this blood has been applied
[58:49] you've been forgiven you have been
[58:51] Justified once and forever it's settled
[58:55] you don't have to grabble back on your
[58:58] knees and do pentates and and woe is me
[59:00] and climb up stairs and get bloody knees
[59:02] and Maya Koopa Maya Koopa I'm such a bad
[59:05] boy I should have never done that in the
[59:07] first place if you're really sincere and
[59:09] you're sorry for what you've done why
[59:11] don't you just repent
[59:12] you can do it right here in this service
[59:15] on that Pew you don't need no Pope you
[59:17] don't need no preacher you don't need no
[59:19] man you got a hotline to the throne of
[59:21] God why don't you say Lord I hear what
[59:23] the preacher is saying and I am sorry
[59:25] for living the way that I'm living now
[59:28] the question is is do you love your
[59:30] addiction and your dope and the way that
[59:32] you're living so much that you'll walk
[59:34] out of the house of God and deny the
[59:36] very Deliverance that's staring you in
[59:38] the face
[59:39] oh this could be your last moment this
[59:42] could be your last time because we're
[59:44] not guaranteed tomorrow but what you're
[59:46] guaranteed is right now
[59:50] don't let the devil beat you up and
[59:52] condemn you it's just been so long I've
[59:53] tried so many times try them out say
[59:55] Lord I'm sorry
[59:58] I heard the word and faith comes by
[1:00:00] hearing the word and faith is a
[1:00:01] revelation it's about time I take what
[1:00:04] God purchased for me I'm a redeemed son
[1:00:06] and daughter of God
[1:00:09] I accept the Passover Lamb
[1:00:12] passing over
[1:00:15] and then you come to the Feast of
[1:00:16] unleavened bread
[1:00:17] man shall not live by bread alone
[1:00:20] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:00:23] the mouth of God you can't mix anything
[1:00:25] with this message I don't want no man's
[1:00:28] thinking I don't want no man's ideas I
[1:00:30] don't want your explanation I'm so glad
[1:00:33] you got to figure it out with all the
[1:00:34] diagrams and you can take me up the
[1:00:36] horizontal rainbow and back down but
[1:00:38] just give it to me straight I just want
[1:00:40] to hear what the prophet said I want to
[1:00:42] hear the message of the hour and the
[1:00:44] Lord Jesus Christ will reveal that word
[1:00:46] to me in the season when I need it
[1:00:49] I don't want secondhand Revelation God's
[1:00:52] given a five-fold Ministry and we preach
[1:00:54] the word and we are the final voice the
[1:00:56] church together we are the final voice
[1:00:58] to this final generation under what
[1:01:02] under the seventh age messenger
[1:01:05] we don't have no voice of Our Own
[1:01:10] I don't want the voice of man I want the
[1:01:13] voice of God
[1:01:17] so Feast of unleavened bread we don't
[1:01:20] mix it with anything and we know that
[1:01:21] Lavender is a type of sin so we got to
[1:01:23] get all the sin out we got to be
[1:01:25] Sanctified oh we're we're pleading the
[1:01:27] blood we're Justified we're going on the
[1:01:29] journey now oh let's let's fish on this
[1:01:32] unleavened bread we got to get all the
[1:01:34] sin out we got to get Sanctified we
[1:01:36] don't want to mix anything with it oh
[1:01:37] let's just separate like Abraham had to
[1:01:40] separate I got a place that I'm taking
[1:01:42] you Abraham I'm taking you into eternity
[1:01:44] I'm taking you into a body change I got
[1:01:47] promises to fulfill I got a plan for
[1:01:49] your life Abraham you were with me in
[1:01:51] the very beginning you are predestinated
[1:01:53] I got it all mapped out for you but just
[1:01:55] separate yourself from the things of the
[1:01:57] world I wonder if some of you want to
[1:01:58] take that trip oh you've been
[1:02:00] predestinated the trouble is is we can't
[1:02:02] separate ourselves from the things of
[1:02:04] the world we can't separate ourselves
[1:02:06] from the things that we want we can't
[1:02:08] separate ourselves from the way that we
[1:02:10] think sleep should be but oh it's
[1:02:11] calling for a time of Separation it is a
[1:02:14] feast of unleavened bread let's get all
[1:02:16] the sin out let's get all
[1:02:18] let's get real and consecrated let's go
[1:02:21] on a journey with God
[1:02:25] unleavened bread men shall not live by
[1:02:27] bread alone nothing mixed with it oh got
[1:02:30] to be Sanctified and then you have the
[1:02:32] Feast of the firstfruits what was the
[1:02:34] Feast of the first it was the waving of
[1:02:36] the Sheaf
[1:02:37] it was a waving of the Sheaf and we know
[1:02:39] that Christ was the first fruits of the
[1:02:41] Resurrection he was the first one that
[1:02:44] raised from the dead and now what we
[1:02:46] come to Oh Glory to God we're on a
[1:02:48] journey now
[1:02:49] now we come to the Feast of Pentecost
[1:02:51] and what was the Feast of Pentecost that
[1:02:54] was where the Holy Ghost fell that's
[1:02:56] where the promise was fulfilled go tell
[1:02:58] ye there in Jerusalem and I will send
[1:03:01] you my comforter he will baptize you
[1:03:03] with the Holy Ghost and Fire I want to
[1:03:05] get to the Feast of Pentecost the
[1:03:08] prophet of God said the problem that it
[1:03:09] is as many of us stopped short he said
[1:03:11] have you have you received the baptism
[1:03:13] of the Holy Ghost since you believe I
[1:03:15] think we need to preach that message
[1:03:17] more in every message church around the
[1:03:19] country so many of us believe the
[1:03:20] message but we've stopped short of a
[1:03:23] true Born Again experience where the
[1:03:26] life of God is in tabernacling the
[1:03:28] individual I don't care if you can quote
[1:03:31] the prophet if you can go to church
[1:03:32] camps if you can sit on the church pew
[1:03:34] but it's the life of the message in you
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:38] and a true son and daughter of God
[1:03:40] that's predestinated won't stop short
[1:03:43] until they get it have you received the
[1:03:46] Holy Ghost that you believe well the
[1:03:48] reason why you're struggling the reason
[1:03:50] why you're fighting the things that
[1:03:51] you're fighting is because there's
[1:03:53] another another step
[1:03:56] just keep going
[1:03:59] so many types laying in the scriptures
[1:04:01] so now we come to the Feast of Pentecost
[1:04:03] the Holy Ghost falling down and and now
[1:04:06] you see the great type of what is
[1:04:08] showing here from from the feast
[1:04:11] of the Sabbath
[1:04:15] there's seven from the Feast of the
[1:04:17] Passover
[1:04:18] there's seven sabbaths you're following
[1:04:21] the order right seven sabbaths there's
[1:04:23] there's seven days in a week
[1:04:25] remember here's Moses he's saying in the
[1:04:28] First new moon the first month on the
[1:04:30] 14th day
[1:04:33] it's going to be a feast of Passover
[1:04:37] now there's going to be seven sabbaths
[1:04:40] 49 days and then on the 50th day right
[1:04:42] so there's there's seven sabbaths from
[1:04:45] the Passover
[1:04:47] Feast to Pentecost
[1:04:49] which is a type of the seven Church ages
[1:04:56] and each Church age
[1:04:59] had to produce a portion or a part of
[1:05:02] the word
[1:05:03] when they saw the light for their day
[1:05:06] when they had their allotted portion God
[1:05:08] provided a way for them in that day that
[1:05:11] word was their rest that was what
[1:05:13] brought the faith for them to be an
[1:05:15] overcomer in the age that they were
[1:05:17] living in
[1:05:19] right Jesus said come unto me all you
[1:05:21] who are heavy-layed and I will give you
[1:05:24] rest that wasn't just for one age that
[1:05:26] was for every age
[1:05:28] the first age the second age the third
[1:05:31] fourth fifth sixth and seventh he said
[1:05:33] come unto me all year heavy laden and I
[1:05:36] will give you rest there is a rash for
[1:05:38] the people of God the problem is is some
[1:05:41] of us ain't Rushton
[1:05:43] you're fighting you're you're anguishing
[1:05:46] you're you're tormented you're
[1:05:47] struggling you don't have to live like
[1:05:50] that any longer there is a rash for the
[1:05:53] people of God
[1:05:56] now the prophet would say this in the
[1:05:58] Patmos Vision he goes let's see what the
[1:05:59] Bible teaches us about a Sabbath rest
[1:06:03] for he is for he that is entered into
[1:06:07] his rest this entering in is not only an
[1:06:10] entering in but a remaining in
[1:06:13] the rest
[1:06:14] it is an eternal rest of which the
[1:06:18] seventh day is but a type
[1:06:21] seven is completion
[1:06:23] eight is the first day again Jesus
[1:06:27] resurrection was in the first day of the
[1:06:29] week giving us eternal life and eternal
[1:06:32] Sabbath rest thus we see why God could
[1:06:35] not give us any one certain day of the
[1:06:38] week as a Sabbath rest we've entered
[1:06:41] into and do remain in our rest which
[1:06:45] Israel could not do
[1:06:47] having only a shadow
[1:06:50] of the true substance which we enjoy
[1:06:54] why go back to a shadow
[1:06:58] when we have reality now
[1:07:03] come on Church why go back to a shadow
[1:07:06] when we have real I don't want a shadow
[1:07:09] I want real substance
[1:07:12] I don't want to go back to a shadow but
[1:07:15] some of us have gone back to a shadow
[1:07:18] you've experienced the goodness of God
[1:07:20] you've experienced the grace of God you
[1:07:23] know what it's like to be free you know
[1:07:25] what it's like to sing for him you know
[1:07:27] what it's like to have the Zeal and the
[1:07:29] joy but I wonder what has happened have
[1:07:31] you traded reality for a shadow have you
[1:07:35] walked out of his presence
[1:07:39] there is a rash why aren't you resting
[1:07:43] his resting place didn't change
[1:07:45] same place where is it
[1:07:48] where is it it's in his word
[1:07:51] where does faith rest in his word
[1:07:54] where's God's provided place at the end
[1:07:56] time in his word
[1:08:01] why would we want a shadow why would we
[1:08:03] live in a shadow
[1:08:05] why would we live below our privileges
[1:08:06] with us because we've allowed that devil
[1:08:09] to sneak his way back into our lives
[1:08:12] the little foxes that spoil the vine and
[1:08:15] you find out that you are once on fire
[1:08:17] for God and now the devil got you so
[1:08:19] condemned you're living in a state of
[1:08:22] the prayer come Lord children of God
[1:08:24] loose yourselves you don't have to live
[1:08:27] like that any longer you are
[1:08:30] predestinated
[1:08:32] I'll take a little more monitor
[1:08:37] why would we live like that
[1:08:39] why would we take a shadow
[1:08:42] when we have reality
[1:08:45] we're seeing what the reality of this
[1:08:47] message looks like by faith
[1:08:50] we listen to it by faith we see it
[1:08:53] we see the effects and how it molds a
[1:08:56] man how it changes on the humility the
[1:08:59] sincerity
[1:09:01] the character
[1:09:03] the transparency
[1:09:06] the honesty
[1:09:09] not to be puffed up not to be recognized
[1:09:12] not to say look at me look at what I've
[1:09:15] done but only to bring the father Glory
[1:09:19] for this is your purpose here on Earth
[1:09:22] that if you abide in him I am the vine
[1:09:25] ye are the branches and if you bear much
[1:09:27] fruit that's his desire and when you do
[1:09:30] that the father's glorified
[1:09:33] but we're just living in a shadow
[1:09:35] we're just trying to hang on for dear
[1:09:37] life
[1:09:42] come on
[1:09:44] Lord bring me into the reality of this
[1:09:47] word
[1:09:49] the message of the hour is your reality
[1:09:55] the word of God is your reality
[1:09:58] everything outside of the word is death
[1:10:01] it is not your reality when Satan sold
[1:10:05] his lives lives to Eve that was not the
[1:10:09] reality that God had given to his
[1:10:12] children
[1:10:14] it was a fake reality
[1:10:17] void of Life only bringing forth death
[1:10:20] temporary sin will take you further than
[1:10:23] you want to go
[1:10:28] second Peter 1 11 would say for an
[1:10:31] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[1:10:33] abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom
[1:10:36] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:10:40] the opening of the word is an entrance
[1:10:44] God's provided way at the end time is a
[1:10:48] reality to enter into that Eighth Day
[1:10:52] into that rest into the Rapture into the
[1:10:55] resurrection by the word
[1:10:59] and entrance something has been opened
[1:11:02] up to you
[1:11:03] you didn't know anything about it but
[1:11:06] you're predestinated
[1:11:07] this threefold mystery purpose you come
[1:11:10] from eternity you always had eternal
[1:11:13] life but you didn't know anything about
[1:11:15] it
[1:11:17] oh I'm getting excited now
[1:11:23] to enter into his rest you cease from
[1:11:26] your own works
[1:11:29] no more how is that liveth
[1:11:33] but Christ that liveth in me
[1:11:38] Paul would say it like this in Romans 9.
[1:11:41] for he saith to Moses I will have mercy
[1:11:44] on whom I will have mercy
[1:11:46] now I make it a point here because when
[1:11:49] you've entered into his rest you cease
[1:11:52] from your own works
[1:11:55] and Paul would say this in Romans 9 15
[1:11:58] he said for saith Moses I will have
[1:12:00] mercy on whom I will have mercy did you
[1:12:03] see any pre-qualification there
[1:12:07] was there any pre-qualifier that I will
[1:12:10] have mercy if you fill out this
[1:12:12] application go ahead and write down your
[1:12:15] 20 worst sins and I'll put you through
[1:12:17] the application process and I'll see if
[1:12:20] you can be a saint that can sit on my
[1:12:22] panel and judge the Earth
[1:12:24] now it says I
[1:12:26] that's why every that's why religious
[1:12:29] Spirits get so upset that's why those
[1:12:31] Sadducees and Pharisees hated Jesus
[1:12:33] Christ because it was without works he
[1:12:36] had compassion on whom he would have
[1:12:39] compassion he healed the blind he healed
[1:12:41] the sick not because of their good works
[1:12:44] because he wanted to
[1:12:47] and they hated him for it
[1:12:50] what what does this guy did
[1:12:53] you ain't of our our church you ain't of
[1:12:56] our group
[1:12:57] I think the bride of Christ needs to get
[1:12:59] that Spirit off of us
[1:13:01] somebody come say man I was healed at
[1:13:03] Benny Hinn's meeting
[1:13:09] yeah
[1:13:10] hey I
[1:13:11] I know what I'm talking about because
[1:13:13] I've done it
[1:13:15] I realized I was seating in the seat of
[1:13:17] the scornful and because somebody didn't
[1:13:19] get for something from God from my way
[1:13:21] of thinking I was like well I wonder if
[1:13:24] that was really God
[1:13:26] no you should rejoice
[1:13:28] that's my God
[1:13:30] my God's A Healer my God's a savior
[1:13:33] he'll have mercy on whom he'll have
[1:13:36] mercy and compassion on whom he'll have
[1:13:39] compassion he is God
[1:13:45] so it is not of him that willeth nor of
[1:13:49] him that runeth the race the fastest and
[1:13:52] do all the works and puts all his
[1:13:53] pennies in the Salvation Army and builds
[1:13:56] a million churches and feeds all the
[1:13:58] people in Ethiopia and does everything
[1:14:00] and passes out the most tracks
[1:14:04] oh man I thought I was gonna work my way
[1:14:06] into this thing
[1:14:08] nope
[1:14:10] nope it's not of him that willeth
[1:14:13] nor of him that runeth
[1:14:16] but of God
[1:14:18] that showeth Mercy
[1:14:21] oh if that don't start the joy Bell's
[1:14:23] ringing
[1:14:25] how do we even realize what we've come
[1:14:27] in contact I don't think we have we we
[1:14:29] don't even realize what we're feeding on
[1:14:31] what we've really come in contact with
[1:14:34] what has really been opened up to us
[1:14:36] that we are breaking into eternity
[1:14:40] where the whole world is bound by a God
[1:14:43] of this evil age but something has come
[1:14:46] to the elect of the hour to break us out
[1:14:48] of here
[1:14:49] Hallelujah
[1:14:51] the mercy of God
[1:14:54] not anything you did
[1:14:56] not any work you could do but because he
[1:14:59] said I have mercy on you I'll have
[1:15:02] compassion on you I'll predestinate you
[1:15:04] I'll reveal my word to you I'll put
[1:15:07] something in you that won't be satisfied
[1:15:10] with anything else but my word oh thank
[1:15:15] you Lord you couldn't stop short you
[1:15:17] couldn't quit because there's only one
[1:15:19] thing that will fill that hunger and
[1:15:21] that thirst for righteousness and that
[1:15:23] is the revealed word of the hour
[1:15:28] foreign

[1:15:58] mystery
[1:16:01] what was Christ
[1:16:03] Christ was the mystery of God revealed
[1:16:06] then what is the bride
[1:16:09] the bride is the mystery of Christ

[1:16:18] physical manifestation and this time oh
[1:16:21] my
[1:16:22] God hallowed not because you could not
[1:16:25] because you could run but because God
[1:16:27] loved you because God had mercy upon you
[1:16:29] because God predestinated you because
[1:16:32] God put your name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:16:34] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:16:41] predestinated
[1:16:43] so what are you scared about

[1:18:05] money
[1:18:07] you know we treat God like that
[1:18:08] sometimes
[1:18:12] here we're all worried about how we're
[1:18:13] gonna pay rent for a house and he's the
[1:18:15] one that gave you the house
[1:18:17] right
[1:18:20] I mean look at how far you've come and
[1:18:22] where God's brought you to what are you
[1:18:23] afraid of what are you scared about
[1:18:26] we're talking about breaking into
[1:18:29] eternity it's it's a thing it's a
[1:18:31] thinking it's a process it's a way that
[1:18:33] you you process what you're looking at
[1:18:36] it's a way of thinking you don't have to
[1:18:38] look at that and and wonder if you can
[1:18:40] you just look at and say how is God
[1:18:41] going to oh you don't have to wonder and
[1:18:44] fear how am I going to be delivered you
[1:18:46] say I am already delivered and now I'm
[1:18:49] looking at the way how God is going to
[1:18:51] bring forth the manifestation of my
[1:18:53] healing you don't have to worry you
[1:18:56] don't have to fear I don't care how long
[1:18:57] you've been sick I don't care how long
[1:18:59] you've been struggling the answer is
[1:19:01] already on its way because you're
[1:19:03] married to the bridegroom he owns a
[1:19:05] cattle on a thousand hills he's already
[1:19:07] provided for you
[1:19:09] what are you worried about
[1:19:12] what are you scared about
[1:19:17] it's time to break into eternity Church
[1:19:20] that's where we're going
[1:19:22] you know that's a mind
[1:19:26] look Jesus Christ came from eternity he
[1:19:29] was going back to Eternity
[1:19:31] when even pilate said why don't you say
[1:19:33] why don't you he said look at my kingdom
[1:19:34] was from here they'd fight for me
[1:19:37] he didn't get caught up in the situation
[1:19:39] if you want to talk about a situation
[1:19:44] because he only did what the father
[1:19:46] showed him his mind was not with man his
[1:19:50] mind was the mind of God and we got to
[1:19:53] get to a place where we stop processing
[1:19:56] all of our decisions by our five senses
[1:19:59] and we step into the sixth sense of
[1:20:01] Faith which is a revelation of the word
[1:20:04] and the mind of God for the hour that
[1:20:06] we're living in and now we let that mind
[1:20:09] be within us to know that God is doing
[1:20:11] something God is doing something in your
[1:20:14] life God is doing something in your life
[1:20:16] God is doing something I don't care if
[1:20:18] you're in the trial if you're in the
[1:20:20] valley if you're in the lowest portion
[1:20:22] you've ever been in your life it's time
[1:20:24] that Faith recognizes that you are a
[1:20:27] true son and a true daughter of God and
[1:20:30] now you know that you're coming into
[1:20:32] your position
[1:20:36] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:20:39] in Christ Jesus
[1:20:44] it's time to break through
[1:20:47] time to break in
[1:20:50] you know what that means to me
[1:20:52] time to get rid of this flesh
[1:20:55] time to get rid of this thinking
[1:20:58] complexes
[1:21:00] time for them to go
[1:21:05] bondage
[1:21:07] time to go
[1:21:09] depression time to go
[1:21:13] worrying time to go anxiety time to go
[1:21:18] oh this this Spirit of anxiety look
[1:21:21] you don't have to live under that
[1:21:23] anxiety anymore you don't have to keep
[1:21:25] taking those pills you can be delivered
[1:21:30] we're breaking out of this thing man
[1:21:33] we're breaking into an intelligence
[1:21:38] we're breaking into where this mind that
[1:21:40] was in Christ Jesus is also all in you
[1:21:43] who thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:21:45] with God we're talking about being
[1:21:47] redeemed being brought back to where you
[1:21:50] were in the beginning uh
[1:21:53] don't you realize there was an
[1:21:55] intelligence there
[1:21:58] you you were with him in the beginning
[1:22:00] you are part of that intelligence
[1:22:03] but you got spiritual Amnesia the shock
[1:22:06] of sin you can't remember where you came
[1:22:09] from and now the word has come
[1:22:13] and now the spiritual Amnesia is
[1:22:16] starting to fade away and you're
[1:22:18] starting to realize what you always were
[1:22:20] in him at the beginning
[1:22:23] oh that's exciting
[1:22:25] it ain't something that I got to do
[1:22:28] I just gotta drink and push out drink
[1:22:30] and push out drink and push out
[1:22:32] just keep feeding just keep me just
[1:22:34] drink and push out
[1:22:36] because I've ceased from my own works
[1:22:40] this opening quote he said there is your
[1:22:42] holy convocation not have anything to do
[1:22:45] with the literal things it's beyond that
[1:22:47] it's into the kingdom of God with
[1:22:50] eternal life with the predestinated that
[1:22:53] never did start it never started on any
[1:22:55] day you wasn't saved on any day you was
[1:22:58] always saved amen Jesus come to redeem
[1:23:01] that but you were saved from the
[1:23:04] beginning
[1:23:05] oh Hallelujah
