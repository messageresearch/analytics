[58:44] this morning we're going to have a h a

[58:50] the stitches in my right eye and um I I
[58:56] I never know when they're going to stab
[58:58] me you know so if you see me go like
[59:00] that that I'm not under the spirit I'm
[59:03] I'm under the uh uh the Stitch so uh but
[59:09] uh open your Bibles with me we're going
[59:11] to have a couple reports
[59:14] today and um and uh uh uh and we're
[59:21] we're going to try to do um these
[59:25] reports
[59:26] and we have a purpose in them thank you
[59:30] musicians B so much and this is all
[59:34] about uh what's been on our heart as our
[59:38] path
[59:39] forward and uh so the the reason for
[59:44] these reports this morning is to make us
[59:48] uh uh all of us more aware of the
[59:52] working of the church and to help each
[59:55] of us to be more a part of the body's
[1:00:00] operation and the sacrifice that is
[1:00:03] being made on your behalf so um just so
[1:00:08] that you might understand uh it takes
[1:00:12] about we have about 60 staff members
[1:00:15] just here on Church alone musicians
[1:00:19] ministers Sunday school teachers Sunday
[1:00:22] school helpers cleaning so it takes a
[1:00:26] lot of people uh working and a lot of uh
[1:00:31] donated uh time and effort so that's why
[1:00:35] we want to have uh uh these uh meetings
[1:00:40] and uh and uh so uh before we read this
[1:00:45] report maybe I could get who's a good
[1:00:48] scripture reader Dylan he's a good
[1:00:51] scripture reader would you come up here
[1:00:53] for me please
[1:01:00] kind of like uh Moses and
[1:01:05] Aaron you think I fit half of that I
[1:01:08] know you take care of Aron real day yeah
[1:01:10] I don't know about that that's a but
[1:01:13] anyway if you I'd like just to to uh uh
[1:01:18] you to read the ninth chapter of 2
[1:01:22] corini uh to us and this is all about
[1:01:27] Paul taking up offering so uh we want to
[1:01:31] start right there if you would my
[1:01:32] brother
[1:01:37] please it says for as touching the
[1:01:39] ministering to the Saints it is
[1:01:41] Superfluous for me to write to you for I
[1:01:44] know the forwardness of your mind for
[1:01:47] which I boast of you to them of
[1:01:49] Macedonia that AA was ready a year ago
[1:01:53] and your Zeal hath provoked very many
[1:01:56] yet have I sent the Brethren lest our
[1:01:59] boasting of you should be in vain in
[1:02:01] this behalf that as I said ye may be
[1:02:04] ready lest happily if they of Macedonia
[1:02:07] come with me and find you
[1:02:10] unprepared we that we say not ye should
[1:02:14] be ashamed in this same confident
[1:02:16] boasting therefore I thought it
[1:02:18] necessary to exhort the Brethren that
[1:02:21] they would be that they would go before
[1:02:23] unto you and make up before hand your
[1:02:26] Bounty whereof ye had noticed before
[1:02:29] that the same might be ready as a matter
[1:02:32] of bounty and not as of
[1:02:34] covetousness but this I say he which
[1:02:36] Seth sparingly shall reap also sparingly
[1:02:40] and he which Seth bountifully shall reap
[1:02:42] also bountifully every man according as
[1:02:45] he purposeth in his heart so let him
[1:02:48] give not grudgingly or of necessity for
[1:02:52] God loveth a cheerful giver and God is
[1:02:55] able to make all grace abound toward you
[1:02:58] that ye always having all sufficiency in
[1:03:00] all things may abound to every good work
[1:03:04] as it is written he hath dispersed
[1:03:06] abroad he hath given to the poor his
[1:03:09] righteousness remaineth forever now he
[1:03:12] that ministereth seed to the Sewer both
[1:03:14] Minister bread for your food and
[1:03:16] multiply your seed sown and increase the
[1:03:19] fruits of your righteousness being
[1:03:21] enriched in everything to all
[1:03:23] bountifulness which causeth through us
[1:03:26] the Thanksgiving to God for the
[1:03:28] administration of this service not only
[1:03:30] supplieth the want of the Saints but is
[1:03:33] abundant also by many thanksgivings unto
[1:03:36] God whilst by the experiment of this
[1:03:38] ministration they glorify God for your
[1:03:40] professed subjection unto the gospel of
[1:03:43] Christ and for your liberal distribution
[1:03:45] unto them and unto all men and by their
[1:03:48] prayer for you which long after you for
[1:03:52] the exceeding grace of God in you thanks
[1:03:54] be unto God for his unspeakable
[1:03:57] gift thank you really God bless you may
[1:04:00] be
[1:04:06] seated uh before I get into my our
[1:04:08] report this morning and uh uh I I want
[1:04:14] uh to uh just read this to you uh this
[1:04:19] is um
[1:04:21] um we've we have some guidelines
[1:04:25] for the fellowship hall and uh we'd like
[1:04:30] you to read these to you uh so the
[1:04:34] purpose of the fellowship hall is to
[1:04:37] support churchwide activities and
[1:04:40] functions of Christian Life
[1:04:42] Tabernacle as scheduled and announced by
[1:04:46] the pastor and
[1:04:48] deacons the church functions will always
[1:04:51] be priority use of the fellowship hall
[1:04:55] for example Sunday school foot washing
[1:04:59] overflow youth meetings ex said when not
[1:05:03] otherwise in use for one of these
[1:05:06] purposes the fellowship hall is
[1:05:09] generally available for use after and
[1:05:13] around service times providing a common
[1:05:17] space for the people in the church to
[1:05:20] visit with one another Comfort crying
[1:05:23] babies and practice music specials the
[1:05:28] fellowship Paul is still considered a
[1:05:30] part of church property and of a
[1:05:32] Christian Life Tabernacle and should be
[1:05:35] treated with the same level of respect
[1:05:39] especially when in use for church
[1:05:41] services the fellowship hall should not
[1:05:44] be
[1:05:45] treated uh should be treated with the
[1:05:47] same respect and level of reverence as
[1:05:51] the sanctuary the fellowship has not a
[1:05:54] daycare for facility playground or
[1:05:58] gymnasium parents should ensure their
[1:06:00] children are accompanied by an adult and
[1:06:05] treating the fellowship hall with
[1:06:07] respect at all times the fellowship hall
[1:06:11] is not to be used for hosting private
[1:06:14] events dinners or parties and is
[1:06:19] reserved only for use of approved

[1:06:33] wedding showers in the fellowship hall
[1:06:36] but no private birthdays or anniversary
[1:06:39] parties or anything like that um it uh
[1:06:45] and so families may bring food into the
[1:06:48] fellowship hall after church service to
[1:06:51] eat while visiting with each other but

[1:08:51] yourselves amen
[1:08:54] so uh to uh go back to um our our report
[1:09:01] uh this morning
[1:09:04] uh and the goal of what our report is in
[1:09:12] uh trying to help each of us understand
[1:09:15] the
[1:09:16] operations of the church our church uh
[1:09:20] has
[1:09:21] bylaws um as a guideline for our
[1:09:24] operation ation and we are a nonprofit
[1:09:29] entity uh governed by the pastor a
[1:09:33] deacon board and a trustee board so uh
[1:09:38] we don't we are an entity we're a
[1:09:42] nonprofit entity which means that your
[1:09:46] offerings and your tithings are tax
[1:09:50] deductible and uh so uh is and so we uh
[1:09:56] and so our Deacon board and we'll have a
[1:09:59] deacon report here I'm giving the
[1:10:01] trustee report the Deacon board uh
[1:10:05] consists of myself as the managing
[1:10:09] partner brother Chris Harris is the
[1:10:12] chairperson John mway Gary Bennett
[1:10:16] Manuel Roso and Darien brother Daren
[1:10:20] they are the uh uh deacons uh
[1:10:26] uh brother John tamamo had to step down
[1:10:30] due to uh different things though he
[1:10:33] helps us from time to time the trustee
[1:10:36] board uh consists of myself as the
[1:10:40] managing partner brother Mike Parks Jr
[1:10:44] as the
[1:10:45] chairperson to Wanda as the secretary
[1:10:48] Brother Richard Greenley as the
[1:10:50] treasurer Matt Thomas act advisor and
[1:10:54] Jonathan lesby as advisor those are
[1:11:00] the uh operating officers and brother
[1:11:04] Tim Siler is our Sunday school and
[1:11:08] superintendent and he'll give us a
[1:11:11] report here in uh a moment now our
[1:11:17] church has two
[1:11:20] sources of income so there's two sources
[1:11:24] of income to our church
[1:11:27] tithing and
[1:11:30] offering and the tithing and the
[1:11:32] offering uh can be rendered in different
[1:11:36] ways it can be uh uh rendered online at
[1:11:40] the church website through vanco which
[1:11:43] is an online payment so if you want to
[1:11:47] make an automatic draft or you want to
[1:11:49] make a a payment you can go online
[1:11:53] there's a section there uh for offering
[1:11:56] and tithing and then you can uh do
[1:12:00] follow the steps and you can make uh I
[1:12:03] guess that's referred to as online
[1:12:07] payments uh we're not going to come to
[1:12:09] you and
[1:12:11] collect uh this is not a collection
[1:12:14] agency as Paul said you give out of
[1:12:17] what's purposed in your heart so uh
[1:12:21] there's no
[1:12:23] obligation here for diving and offering
[1:12:27] that obligation only has to lie within
[1:12:30] yourself according to your own
[1:12:33] conviction so we we hold this facility
[1:12:37] open uh for whosoever Will and
[1:12:41] everyone's welcome and uh so uh the
[1:12:45] other way you by mail you can mail uh
[1:12:49] your offering and also we pass the
[1:12:53] offering basket and and they're divided
[1:12:57] by um envelopes uh we have tying
[1:13:01] envelopes uh uh offering envelopes
[1:13:05] building fund envelopes you can put your
[1:13:08] offering in and uh these will be uh
[1:13:13] distributed to the right account so we
[1:13:17] have two accounts in the church we have
[1:13:20] our offering account and our tithing
[1:13:23] account and uh if uh do we have that uh
[1:13:30] uh division here and uh okay so uh um
[1:13:37] and and this is this is so each uh you
[1:13:39] know so you're you're not in the dark
[1:13:43] you know what I mean we want you to know
[1:13:45] what's going on we want to be
[1:13:47] transparent uh we're not ashamed and so
[1:13:52] by our bylaws and and by our the our
[1:13:56] church operation we have divided these
[1:14:00] accounts in two parts and the offering
[1:14:04] account is managed by the trustee board
[1:14:09] they manage the offering account the
[1:14:12] tithing account is managed by the pastor
[1:14:15] so each of these accounts are separate
[1:14:20] and they're managed by two different
[1:14:23] sources the P manages the tithing
[1:14:27] account and the trustees manage the
[1:14:31] operation account and here are the
[1:14:35] categories that the trustees are
[1:14:38] responsible for and so all the
[1:14:43] expenses that fall in these categories
[1:14:46] the trustees take care of out of the
[1:14:49] offering account so you have to imagine
[1:14:52] we have to have I don't know I think our
[1:14:55] congregation has grown now to somewhere
[1:14:58] around 500 members so we've got to have
[1:15:02] some sort of system of managing things
[1:15:07] you know so we don't want it to be a
[1:15:09] secret this is just
[1:15:11] straightforward as it can be so here's
[1:15:15] the responsibilities of the offering
[1:15:18] account it's building
[1:15:21] repairs Church
[1:15:23] administrative expens es and those are
[1:15:27] items like uh uh uh Bank fees uh check
[1:15:34] fees uh things that might come under uh
[1:15:37] administrative things Church
[1:15:40] insurance and we'll come to that in just
[1:15:43] a moment Church insurance is paid out of
[1:15:47] the church operating offering
[1:15:51] fund uh Church maintenance so any that
[1:15:55] needs to be maintained broken toilet
[1:15:58] valves uh broken tile everything with
[1:16:02] maintenance all comes out of the
[1:16:05] offering account uh the church mortgage
[1:16:10] is paid for out of the
[1:16:14] offering account church
[1:16:17] security and uh uh we have a pretty
[1:16:21] extensive security system our brother
[1:16:24] Chris May tap on that uh the electrical
[1:16:28] bill the library expenses miscellaneous
[1:16:33] purchases natural gas Sunday
[1:16:37] School telephone internet and water
[1:16:42] almost anything to do with the physical
[1:16:45] operation of the church comes out of the
[1:16:48] offering fund that's the
[1:16:50] responsibility of the trustees to manage
[1:16:54] this money so you have a facility that
[1:16:58] doesn't get run down that operates right
[1:17:02] that you does everybody enjoy air
[1:17:05] conditioning thank the trustees do you
[1:17:08] enjoy heat so all these things that you
[1:17:11] enjoy uh are provided by your offering
[1:17:16] managed by the trustee board uh and I I
[1:17:21] I know this is a financial report and I
[1:17:24] I don't have any skilled way to make it
[1:17:32] unboringed that uh you your heart will
[1:17:35] be blessed and and then the the other
[1:17:39] income that we receive is through the
[1:17:42] tithing account and these are all the
[1:17:46] responsibilities of the tithing account
[1:17:50] all annual and youth meetings so any
[1:17:54] meeting meetings that we have any
[1:17:57] fellowships that we have dinners that we
[1:18:01] have any activity that we have all those
[1:18:05] are funded from the tithing
[1:18:08] account it's separate from the building
[1:18:12] uh
[1:18:13] operation benevolence is all uh taken
[1:18:17] care of from the tithing
[1:18:20] account and benevolence goes from uh
[1:18:24] meeting people's financial needs to uh
[1:18:27] helping uh in many many areas so we take
[1:18:31] care of of those financial needs Church
[1:18:35] camps and
[1:18:36] transportation funeral
[1:18:39] expenses um our annual meetings uh uh
[1:18:44] you know we have uh offerings to
[1:18:46] ministers hotel rooms uh all the all
[1:18:50] these expenses are all taken care of uh
[1:18:53] monthly men's me meetings outreaches any
[1:18:57] form of Outreach uh pastoral
[1:19:00] staff uh any uh spending that we find uh
[1:19:06] that we would call it discretionary if
[1:19:09] we choose to buy something or or get
[1:19:12] something for the church a microphone or
[1:19:15] or whatever all those are taken care of
[1:19:19] the pastor salar is taken care of and
[1:19:22] now the tithing fund the
[1:19:25] the library is operated by the trustees
[1:19:30] but the tithing fund supplements the
[1:19:34] library so in other words we transfer
[1:19:37] money from the uh tithing account into
[1:19:42] the offering account to handle any
[1:19:45] overrides or or and Supply take care of
[1:19:48] all the library
[1:19:50] expenses uh we supplement the operating
[1:19:53] fund if we don't have enough money to
[1:19:57] cover our expenses then we supplement
[1:20:00] that we supplement the
[1:20:02] Sunday uh uh School uh funding so the
[1:20:08] Sunday School all the expenses of the
[1:20:10] Sunday School are transferred into the
[1:20:13] operating account and taken care of from
[1:20:17] the operating account and then any
[1:20:22] visiting pastors Ministeries uh church
[1:20:25] offering all those come out of uh those
[1:20:30] accounts so that's the way that uh we're
[1:20:34] set up uh some of you may be accountants
[1:20:37] or or business people and you may have a
[1:20:41] better way to do all of this but this is
[1:20:44] the way it started and
[1:20:47] and this has been our foundation for 45
[1:20:51] years and it's worked pretty well so so
[1:20:54] far so I think our lifestyle have shown
[1:20:58] that we haven't uh there's not been a
[1:21:01] lot of
[1:21:03] extravagance um going on so uh now I'd
[1:21:07] just like to uh just take a moment and
[1:21:12] uh bring to your
[1:21:14] attention um let me see if I can find
[1:21:17] that
[1:21:18] here um there's one other paper that I
[1:21:24] want want to bring up let me see if I
[1:21:26] let me just give me a moment here if I
[1:21:28] can find it
[1:21:31] um for
[1:21:38] you I know I know you're hiding from
[1:21:44] me well uh I I I must have uh it must
[1:21:50] have gotten away from me but I I wanted
[1:21:53] us you to know that um
[1:21:57] um as you know we have just finished
[1:22:00] building our building project and um uh
[1:22:05] we've completed it the whole project the
[1:22:08] remodeling the buying of the property
[1:22:11] the remodeling of the old Sanctuary the
[1:22:14] building of this Sanctuary the parking
[1:22:17] lot The Pavilion the storage shed the
[1:22:20] Landscaping everything that we've done
[1:22:23] it cost us about
[1:22:25] $2,500,000
[1:22:27] and that's been going on over the last 5
[1:22:31] years and uh we collected uh quite a bit
[1:22:35] of money in our fund uh and we borrowed
[1:22:39] money and so what we owe now on the
[1:22:44] building is this whole complex is we owe
[1:22:49] $836,000
[1:22:51] and our goal is to pay that off
[1:22:55] in 10 years if the Lord carries uh those
[1:23:00] of you that remain uh you're free to use
[1:23:04] it uh and if you can make the payment go
[1:23:09] ahead um uh I'm sure that after the
[1:23:14] Rapture people will pray more than they
[1:23:16] ever prayed you know what I mean so I
[1:23:20] imagine if the Rapture takes place and
[1:23:23] you're left that you'll probably be here
[1:23:26] every day so you know the
[1:23:30] rules right and you know how to keep it
[1:23:33] operating but my advice to you is let's
[1:23:37] leave amen let's leave it for somebody
[1:23:42] else so uh so
[1:23:45] um that that's what that's hit is now we
[1:23:49] just want to take a quick moment and
[1:23:52] look at our expenses and and uh so
[1:23:55] they'll put this up this is our monthly
[1:24:00] expenses and uh and uh and the
[1:24:05] categories that are involved and we'll
[1:24:09] focus more on the monthly
[1:24:12] expense um and um uh so I uh you can see
[1:24:20] so I you can follow it up but we'll take
[1:24:23] down the middle and you can look to each
[1:24:25] side so we have Administration costs
[1:24:28] they're not much just about $50 a month
[1:24:32] stamps uh computers whatever small items
[1:24:36] there are our electricity is one of our
[1:24:39] largest items and it is $1,500 a month
[1:24:44] we we we uh cool about uh
[1:24:50] 15,000 square ft so that's how large our
[1:24:54] facility is so
[1:24:58] 15,000 uh square fet and it our
[1:25:02] electrical bill for lighting air
[1:25:05] conditioning and all the other sources
[1:25:08] uh runs about $1,500 a month the library
[1:25:12] runs us about $50 a month uh uh Church
[1:25:17] cleaning
[1:25:18] maintenance and
[1:25:21] repair uh runs us about uh
[1:25:26] $2400 a month so we clean the church
[1:25:30] all, 1500 square ft two times a week and
[1:25:34] some and then sometimes more often
[1:25:37] depending on
[1:25:39] events uh uh operating supplies and
[1:25:43] purchases run about uh 250 a month I I
[1:25:47] believe that uh may include some of our
[1:25:50] paper goods our mortgage is5
[1:25:55] ,1
[1:25:57] 152 a month and a lot of people have
[1:26:01] homewor is that big you know but anyway
[1:26:06] that is uh that's what our mortgage is
[1:26:09] our natural gas runs about
[1:26:11] $125 a month uh safety and insurance
[1:26:16] runs about
[1:26:19] $2,200 a month Sunday school is not uh
[1:26:23] too much expenses uh right now it
[1:26:26] averages about 50 but if they were going
[1:26:29] to have a project or or make something
[1:26:34] or do something then that project would
[1:26:37] be covered by the tithing account
[1:26:40] telephone and internet about a 100 a
[1:26:43] month water about
[1:26:45] 900 a month now ground maintenance has
[1:26:50] been been donated to our church uh for
[1:26:54] the last few years so we haven't had to
[1:26:57] pay that that's been donated and uh but
[1:27:01] if that donation sometimes comes to an
[1:27:04] end uh then we would add that to our
[1:27:09] expenses so this kind of just gives you
[1:27:12] a general idea of where we are uh we
[1:27:16] read the scripture to you uh so that you
[1:27:20] could give of your Bounty that you would
[1:27:23] be
[1:27:25] prepared and give of a cheerful heart
[1:27:28] and and understand that it it does take
[1:27:32] a lot of effort and the deacons and the
[1:27:35] trustees and the Sunday school they all
[1:27:38] put quite a bit of time into it uh for
[1:27:42] your sake so at this time I'd like to
[1:27:44] ask brother Chris to come up and he's
[1:27:47] just going to give you a little rundown
[1:27:50] on uh the obligations of the Deacons
[1:27:54] um so and you're all a part of
[1:27:58] this you understand this is you you know
[1:28:02] it's not us providing a place for you
[1:28:06] this is you and you can pray us out of
[1:28:10] here anytime so if you all went home
[1:28:13] tonight and got down on your knees and
[1:28:16] ask God to remove me I'm sure that he
[1:28:20] oblig you and uh and go on but we're
[1:28:24] here for you so brother Chris you would
[1:28:27] please God bless
[1:28:33] you so like Brother David said this
[1:28:35] won't be with elegant speech I'm trying
[1:28:37] I'm G to try to unpack this quickly um
[1:28:40] first thank you for your patience and
[1:28:41] support through the transition of the
[1:28:43] two buildings there were a lot of things
[1:28:45] that we learned on the spot things we
[1:28:47] didn't know until we know so we've we've
[1:28:49] adapted we've learned and we're
[1:28:51] constantly trying to improve on what
[1:28:52] we're doing as Brother David said
[1:28:55] current deacons Gary Bennett brother
[1:28:57] Manuel Roso Darian arenzy John mway and
[1:29:00] myself and so I'll just quickly go
[1:29:02] through kind of what we're doing each
[1:29:04] Deacon is designated to oversee specific
[1:29:07] areas within the church ensuring all
[1:29:10] roles and responsibilities and security
[1:29:12] measures are effectively managed Brother
[1:29:14] Gary assists Brother David the ministers
[1:29:16] the song leaders before and during
[1:29:19] service his duties include preparing
[1:29:21] microphone equipment coordinating
[1:29:23] messages with the sound team Team titles
[1:29:25] dates portions played as well as
[1:29:27] addressing any other needs that may
[1:29:28] arise Brother Gary also helped schedule
[1:29:31] appointments for those wishing to see
[1:29:33] Brother David after the service so if
[1:29:35] you do need to see Brother David uh
[1:29:37] please try to get with Brother Gary
[1:29:38] first so he can coordinate that with
[1:29:39] Brother David um during service he
[1:29:42] covers the right side of the sanctuary
[1:29:44] our brother manual Roso oversees the
[1:29:46] front entry leading into the fellowship
[1:29:48] hall during pre-service he supports the
[1:29:51] logistics of Sunday school children
[1:29:52] manages interpretation needs collects
[1:29:54] announcements and prayer requests and
[1:29:56] the collection of tithes and offerings
[1:29:58] brother Manuel covers the front left
[1:30:02] side of the sanctuary during service our
[1:30:04] precious brother Darien arenzy our
[1:30:07] faithful greeter at the main entry
[1:30:09] supports collecting announcements and
[1:30:11] prayer requests manages interpretation
[1:30:13] equipment and welcomes visiting guests
[1:30:15] and firsttime attendees during the
[1:30:17] service brother Daran will help cover
[1:30:18] the rear of the sanctuary brother John
[1:30:21] MAA helps seat people pre- service and
[1:30:23] covers the left rear of the sanctuary
[1:30:25] during the service he oversees the back
[1:30:27] of the sanctuary the foyer and any other
[1:30:29] needs that arise brother John also helps
[1:30:33] keep an eye on all the entryways that
[1:30:35] lead exiting the building from the front
[1:30:37] of the church uh and occasionally takes
[1:30:40] a a sweep out in the parking lot to to
[1:30:42] look at things uh I assist with seating
[1:30:44] and covering the right rear of the
[1:30:45] building during service also help carry
[1:30:48] the rear of the sanctuary the cry room
[1:30:49] and the fouryear during service um again
[1:30:53] I help John we ensure all entryways are
[1:30:55] secured after Sunday School dismissal
[1:30:57] once the service has started and monitor
[1:30:59] these entryways and parking lot via
[1:31:01] security cameras so as Brother David
[1:31:03] mentioned we do have multiple cameras
[1:31:05] throughout the building into the parking
[1:31:07] lot and we do have also a few Brothers
[1:31:09] in the congregation that do help us
[1:31:11] monitor these to keep an eye on us keep
[1:31:13] an eye on our vehicles and things going
[1:31:15] on
[1:31:16] outside um we did start we made an
[1:31:19] adjustment with prayer requests and
[1:31:22] announcements we are going to collect
[1:31:24] these up until 5 minutes prior to
[1:31:25] service so that way we can get them to
[1:31:28] um the song leader he can go through
[1:31:30] them collect those prepare those and um
[1:31:33] any that are not
[1:31:35] collected or are turned in after the 5
[1:31:38] minutes we'll announce those the next
[1:31:39] following service um the other thing I
[1:31:42] had was Brother David mentioned the
[1:31:44] fellowship hall is now available to feed
[1:31:46] the children but he went through that
[1:31:49] and last and not least seating and
[1:31:51] temperature are always a Hot Topic or
[1:31:54] cold depending on who you are and where
[1:31:56] you sit but uh we are currently working
[1:31:59] on a few improvements to make that a
[1:32:00] little more efficient so be patient with
[1:32:03] us we'll get it a little more dialed
[1:32:04] in um last but not least we never know
[1:32:07] how many people we're going to get for
[1:32:09] service so we are anticipating we have a
[1:32:11] lot of visitors here today we're packed
[1:32:13] 400 people um so that's why brother John
[1:32:16] and I try to strategically place people
[1:32:18] so we can get everybody in here so it's
[1:32:21] another cry for your help and support
[1:32:23] please if you can especially on Sunday
[1:32:24] mornings try to move as as close to the
[1:32:26] front as possible um because when the
[1:32:29] when the middle and the rear is full uh
[1:32:31] we have empty spaces up here we can't
[1:32:33] fit families so we're sitting families
[1:32:34] and chairs and along the island in the
[1:32:36] Overflow when we have empty spaces here
[1:32:39] so it's just another um you know kindly
[1:32:41] asking for your support there and um
[1:32:44] that's all that I have anything else you
[1:32:47] need uh again we're here to serve we're
[1:32:49] doing our best we're learning as we go
[1:32:51] so please be patient if you have any
[1:32:53] questions or suggestions let us know if
[1:32:56] they're bad or they criticism brother
[1:32:57] Darion has made himself available so
[1:33:00] please take those to brother
[1:33:09] Darion there's just a lot goes in it so
[1:33:12] you might just walk in but somebody's
[1:33:15] watching you
[1:33:24] so uh but anyway we're we're trying to
[1:33:28] make everything work smoothly so anyway
[1:33:32] I think this is probably one of the the
[1:33:35] most important offices in the church and
[1:33:39] I I just can't even
[1:33:42] express how pleased I am how it's all
[1:33:45] come together and the service that's
[1:33:48] been done uh for our children our our
[1:33:52] children are are f future and and uh
[1:33:55] Sunday school means more to us now
[1:33:58] probably than ever um there's uh such
[1:34:04] radical thinking out there and we just
[1:34:07] desire uh to have the gospel just
[1:34:10] brought to our children and brother
[1:34:12] Tim's been in charge of that so we're
[1:34:15] going to ask brother Tim to come and
[1:34:17] give you a an idea maybe some of you
[1:34:20] don't have children but this will let
[1:34:22] you know what's going on uh with our
[1:34:25] Sunday school Tim's just done a
[1:34:27] spectacular job God bless you brother
[1:34:30] appreciate
[1:34:31] you thank you brother David brother
[1:34:33] Chris as well
[1:34:35] uh a lot of work a lot of upkeep a lot
[1:34:39] of
[1:34:40] strain but as Paul said he thought it
[1:34:44] necessary to exhort the Brethren and the
[1:34:46] sisters amen because uh it takes not
[1:34:50] only the effort but the uh the intent
[1:34:53] behind it
[1:34:54] and our intent is to raise our children
[1:34:57] in uh in a manner as the book of Psalm
[1:35:01] says teach them the way they should go
[1:35:04] and they won't depart from
[1:35:06] it and uh we don't know how long the
[1:35:10] Lord is going to Tar but we had to
[1:35:12] prepare brother Bram said if I knew it
[1:35:15] was coming
[1:35:17] tomorrow and I was planting potatoes I'd
[1:35:20] plant those
[1:35:21] potatoes amen so we don't know what the
[1:35:24] crop is going to yield
[1:35:27] um but I I'm blessed that uh we
[1:35:31] have the facility we have now to uh
[1:35:34] support our classes of
[1:35:38] uh and they are growing and they're uh
[1:35:41] they're getting crowded over there so uh
[1:35:45] but uh as brother Chris said be patient
[1:35:47] with us and we'll try to work it
[1:35:49] out um just a little bit of the
[1:35:52] logistics is that we start Sunday school
[1:35:54] at
[1:35:55] 10:00 um obviously we've been instructed
[1:35:59] and advised to be the church early move
[1:36:02] forward 9:30 is uh at least adequate but
[1:36:07] from 9:30 to 9:45 or so we can receive
[1:36:09] your children the teachers are usually
[1:36:11] here and preparing uh but at 10:00 the
[1:36:14] doors will shut and if you hadn't gotten
[1:36:16] here by then just bring your children on
[1:36:18] inside the
[1:36:19] sanctuary uh we have four classes four
[1:36:22] age groups of classes
[1:36:24] they range from 4 years old to 12 years
[1:36:27] old and uh right now the four to sixes
[1:36:31] we have 29 enrolled in Sunday school um
[1:36:36] last week I think we had 22 in that
[1:36:38] little class when everybody comes it's
[1:36:40] uh quite crowded sister Rachel Bennett
[1:36:43] is uh teaching that class and helpers
[1:36:46] all these uh teachers have helpers and I
[1:36:48] won't name them because I would surely
[1:36:50] forget some of them but um
[1:36:54] 29 and 4 to6 23 and the six to S year
[1:36:58] olds sister Liz a shes and helpers in
[1:37:01] that
[1:37:02] classroom we have 24 8 to n year olds
[1:37:06] and sister Juliet Bond and helpers 10
[1:37:10] them and there are 30 in our 10 to 12
[1:37:14] and that's sister Amanda Harris and her
[1:37:17] helpers so that's
[1:37:18] 106 total registered uh Sunday school
[1:37:22] attendees now if they all show up at the
[1:37:25] same time I don't know what we're going
[1:37:26] to do
[1:37:28] but uh just to give you a little scope
[1:37:30] and background we have uh recently
[1:37:33] benefited from that supplemental funding
[1:37:35] brother Dave was talking about to the
[1:37:37] Sunday school and uh we were able to
[1:37:40] purchase some a Becca curriculum has
[1:37:43] large pictures and subject matter
[1:37:45] there's nothing uh you know doctrinal so
[1:37:49] to speak uh that would stray from
[1:37:52] anything the message outside of the
[1:37:54] Bible is very scriptural and that's just
[1:37:56] a an outline or a a basic uh subject
[1:38:02] matter that the teachers can pick from
[1:38:03] but it has very nice visuals for them to
[1:38:07] uh to
[1:38:08] reference so the four to six year olds
[1:38:11] and I'll just give a little rundown of
[1:38:13] what they've been studying and going
[1:38:14] through to give you an example why
[1:38:17] you're children may come home and ask
[1:38:18] you some
[1:38:20] questions uh the ABCs of the Bible okay
[1:38:23] when you talking 4 to 6 you want to
[1:38:26] start pretty low but Matthew 22:37 it
[1:38:30] says love the Lord your God with all
[1:38:31] your heart soul and mind and also how
[1:38:34] you can show your love towards others so
[1:38:37] uh they've received that benefit the six
[1:38:40] to seven year olds are going through the
[1:38:42] life of Moses from his birth and how he
[1:38:45] uh assisted the children of Israel and
[1:38:47] then to Jethro's daughters and God
[1:38:49] speaking through the burning bush and
[1:38:51] last week was Moses and Aaron before
[1:38:53] pharaoh and today is the first
[1:38:57] plague so uh the 10 to 12 year olds
[1:39:01] excuse me the the eight and nine year
[1:39:03] olds are going through the ministry the
[1:39:05] life and Ministry of Elisha his calling
[1:39:08] and
[1:39:08] training and how God gives and withholds
[1:39:11] and withholds His blessings and the
[1:39:13] miraculous pot of oil and the great
[1:39:15] woman of Schuman how can we forget this
[1:39:17] humanum I woman and today they're going
[1:39:20] over non's
[1:39:21] leprosy the 10 to 12 olds are going
[1:39:24] through the Bible characters and how
[1:39:25] their trials and Faith relate to the
[1:39:27] everyday
[1:39:28] walk how the Israelites and following
[1:39:30] God's Commandments and Abraham living by
[1:39:33] faith and David and his perseverance and
[1:39:36] recently they explored the Tabernacle
[1:39:38] the process of the sacrifice the holiest
[1:39:40] of holies and how Jesus Took the place
[1:39:42] of the sacrifice and opened up the
[1:39:44] holiest of holies for us to enter into
[1:39:47] daily so that's just a brief synopsis of
[1:39:50] what they're going through obviously the
[1:39:52] uh
[1:39:54] the uh the struggle is to keep them all
[1:39:56] focused and and uh I want to say
[1:39:59] entertained but we entertain them by the
[1:40:01] right things and you get everybody on
[1:40:02] one subject one mind one Accord and uh
[1:40:06] and you teach them early and as I said
[1:40:09] they won't depart from it they've also
[1:40:11] collected about $33 in offerings so
[1:40:14] we're teaching our children to to get on
[1:40:16] board with that because brother rown
[1:40:18] taught us it is part of worship then we
[1:40:20] come and uh we offer sacrifices of
[1:40:23] thanks giving and uh we owe it all to
[1:40:26] him anyway amen so blessed be the name
[1:40:28] of the Lord that's just uh we are
[1:40:30] preparing there will be a a little song
[1:40:33] the children are going to sing but we're
[1:40:35] we're already thinking about the new
[1:40:37] facility behind us The Pavilion at the
[1:40:40] end of the year uh we usually have a
[1:40:42] little picnic and party for them and uh
[1:40:45] we've had to rent parks and such in the
[1:40:48] past but now we have a pavilion provided
[1:40:50] so we'll probably be planning that so
[1:40:53] toward uh the end of May or miday
[1:40:56] something like that as the children get
[1:40:57] out of school we kind of transition into
[1:40:59] the summer month so uh if you if you
[1:41:02] know uh helpers
[1:41:05] teachers you know greet them thank them
[1:41:08] profusely because uh they're doing a
[1:41:10] wonderful wonderful job and I wish you
[1:41:13] could all just kind of be a fly on the
[1:41:14] wall in some of the classes and realize
[1:41:16] that they're receiving beneficial
[1:41:19] longlasting uh scriptural instruction so
[1:41:22] thank you to teach done a wonderful job
[1:41:24] Lord bless
[1:41:32] youall well I trust that maybe you feel
[1:41:37] more of a part that was our goal uh that
[1:41:42] uh you're not ignorant uh Brethren I
[1:41:45] would not have you be ignorant
[1:41:47] concerning these things that it takes
[1:41:51] love it takes time it takes effort
[1:41:54] it takes uh it does take offering and
[1:41:57] money to operate and where you're
[1:41:59] sitting somebody provides that for you
[1:42:03] so you know we hope that we can all uh
[1:42:07] join in and bear one another's burdens
[1:42:10] and uh I I know that people might not
[1:42:14] think that uh this was necessary but
[1:42:18] Paul devoted a whole chapter of the
[1:42:22] scripture about collecting Bounty for
[1:42:25] the needs and so we wanted to do that I
[1:42:27] felt obligated to do that I felt this
[1:42:30] would be a good time so I hope it was a
[1:42:32] blessing to you this morning uh brother
[1:42:35] Billy will lead us in a song and then
[1:42:38] brother matth will have a short sermon
[1:42:41] for us this morning so that we can
[1:42:44] definitely Fellowship H around the word
[1:42:48] and that that keeps that is our priority
[1:42:52] and as you know it's never been
[1:42:55] our uh Habit to discuss money or beg for
[1:43:00] money so uh just however God leads you

[1:46:56] the reports but I trust that with all of
[1:46:59] that um we we still want to give the
[1:47:01] word preeminence so I know that we've
[1:47:04] already been about an hour and 30
[1:47:06] minutes if you need to step out and and
[1:47:09] use the restroom and once again uh
[1:47:11] there's no obligation uh you're free to
[1:47:13] come and go as you please uh one thing I
[1:47:16] do know I I just encouraged uh as our
[1:47:18] brother prayed to open the service we
[1:47:20] just want the Lord to have his way and
[1:47:22] may we just give out of the way and um
[1:47:25] let God let God minister to Hearts as I
[1:47:29] pondered back there as time was ticking
[1:47:31] and you know that people will be tired
[1:47:33] and uh we've already been here many
[1:47:35] churches would have been dismissed 45
[1:47:37] minutes ago um but yet we don't want to
[1:47:40] be carnal we we want to be spiritual
[1:47:42] people and I I was thinking back there I
[1:47:46] I just thought you know brother brandham
[1:47:47] said that you know if we read a
[1:47:49] scripture we'd be blessed and brother
[1:47:50] Billy one time said that somebody's
[1:47:52] going to have to to manifest that and I
[1:47:54] was back there thinking this is the
[1:47:56] night this is the time this is the hour
[1:47:59] I can just go read a scripture praise
[1:48:00] God for the reports um but then the Lord
[1:48:04] started to deal with my heart and I
[1:48:05] thought well somebody come here to hear
[1:48:07] from
[1:48:08] god let's go before him Lord we just
[1:48:12] want you to come Lord I in my flesh I
[1:48:15] feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a
[1:48:17] hard place the the people
[1:48:20] are have been here for a Time many get
[1:48:23] here 30 45 minutes early they've already
[1:48:25] been here over 2
[1:48:31] hours Lord I just want you to have your
[1:48:34] way
[1:48:35] and I don't want to be limited by
[1:48:39] it something that would come into my
[1:48:41] mind Lord but we want to get out of the
[1:48:43] way that you could just have the
[1:48:46] preeminence
[1:48:48] Lord Lord there's a lot of things that
[1:48:51] we give our time to
[1:48:54] we'll watch a two three hour movie or go
[1:48:56] to a ball game for two or three
[1:48:58] hours we'll go to a theme park and spend
[1:49:01] all day
[1:49:04] there sometimes when it comes to the
[1:49:06] things of God it's hard for us to stick
[1:49:08] around for a couple
[1:49:11] hours Lord we want you to have the
[1:49:13] preeminence may we just wash your feet
[1:49:15] this morning
[1:49:16] and give you the attention that you
[1:49:19] deserve we just commit ourselves to you
[1:49:21] now in the name of the Lord Jes Jesus
[1:49:23] Christ
[1:49:26] amen amen praise the Lord let's just
[1:49:29] turn in our Bibles to John chapter
[1:49:32] [Music]
[1:49:41] 12 amen praise the
[1:49:43] lord
[1:49:45] well it's
[1:49:49] 11:40 I thought my my my prayer should
[1:49:52] have been our prayer of
[1:49:54] dismissal I'm going to try to move uh
[1:49:57] quickly by the help of
[1:49:59] God um so if I if I catch a certain
[1:50:03] Pace um I pray God would just help us
[1:50:08] uh just to move and be a blessing amen
[1:50:11] John chapter
[1:50:15] 1234 John chapter 12 verse 34
[1:50:24] it saysthe people answered him we have
[1:50:27] heard out of the law that Christ abideth
[1:50:29] forever and how sayest thou the son of
[1:50:31] man must be lifted up who is this son of
[1:50:37] man now look at the reply that Jesus
[1:50:40] would give to him it would almost seem
[1:50:43] uh really a profound answer he says then
[1:50:47] Jesus said unto them yet a little while
[1:50:49] is the light with you walk while you
[1:50:53] have the light lest Darkness come upon
[1:50:57] you for he that walketh in darkness
[1:51:00] knoweth not whether he goeth while you
[1:51:02] have the light believe in the light that
[1:51:06] you may be Children of the
[1:51:08] light these things spake Jesus and
[1:51:12] departed and did not hide himself from
[1:51:14] them that notice he said that ye may be
[1:51:17] Children of the light amen you may be
[1:51:19] seated and if you'll also turn in your
[1:51:21] Bibles to First John
[1:51:37] 1:7 1 John 1 and
[1:51:41] 7 familiar
[1:51:49] scripture 1 John 1:7 say but if we walk
[1:51:52] in the light as he is in the light we
[1:51:55] have Fellowship one with another and the
[1:51:57] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[1:51:59] us from all sin and brother Brandon
[1:52:02] would say in God's only provided place
[1:52:04] of worship and may maybe just before I
[1:52:07] hit that let me just say this as I would
[1:52:09] was just listening to uh something
[1:52:11] that's been on my heart as brother
[1:52:13] Brandon preached a sermon when Divine
[1:52:14] love is projected Sovereign Grace takes
[1:52:17] its place and he said and God so loved
[1:52:20] you that when his love was projected
[1:52:23] Sovereign Grace taken its place and sent
[1:52:25] a savior to redeem you back to himself
[1:52:29] and and by the help of God as we move
[1:52:31] through there uh certainly on a service
[1:52:32] where we're limited to time I I don't
[1:52:34] know if we would ever get there but I I
[1:52:36] just am trying to move to a place that
[1:52:39] now that that uh Divine love has been
[1:52:41] projected to us we are now become part
[1:52:44] of that Divine love and we want to
[1:52:46] project that Divine love to other people
[1:52:49] into our situations and into our life
[1:52:52] that Sovereign Grace would take its
[1:52:54] place brother brandham says this in
[1:52:56] God's only provided place of worship he
[1:52:58] said a man told me long ago said I Don't
[1:53:00] Preach a Clos line
[1:53:02] religion I said then you're not
[1:53:04] preaching the gospel all right so it
[1:53:07] matters it matters how you dress these
[1:53:09] things matter he says then you're not
[1:53:11] preaching the gospel God laid it out
[1:53:13] there he said what to do you either you
[1:53:15] either do it that's your natural
[1:53:17] reasonable thing what uh Little Things a
[1:53:20] woman uh let her hair grow that's why
[1:53:23] it's just something she can do and won't
[1:53:25] even do that she won't even do that oh
[1:53:28] teach us great things how can you teach
[1:53:31] the great things when you won't do the
[1:53:33] simple common things because you see
[1:53:36] your motive and your objective is
[1:53:39] wrong it's your love to God lord I don't
[1:53:43] care what you want me to do I'm willing
[1:53:46] to do it then you're getting somewhere
[1:53:48] but if you don't do it that way the way
[1:53:51] he said to do it it's his choosing
[1:53:54] that's the place I have chosen that's
[1:53:56] where you you worship with your
[1:53:59] sacrifice now notice the prophet of God
[1:54:01] says he says how can I teach the great
[1:54:03] things when you won't do the simple
[1:54:05] common things I I just by the help of
[1:54:07] God want to preach this morning to you
[1:54:09] now I know my
[1:54:12] ABCs all right you hear what they're
[1:54:14] talking about in Sunday school they're
[1:54:15] teaching our kids the ABCs I would hope
[1:54:18] we've come to a place as a mature bride
[1:54:21] of Jesus Christ we are in a position
[1:54:23] where we know our ABCs and I want to say
[1:54:25] it's not just enough to know the ABCs
[1:54:27] but we're able to apply them that we can
[1:54:29] get to a place where we can now be
[1:54:31] taught the spiritual things look strong
[1:54:33] meat belongs to those that are spiritual
[1:54:36] but we're unskillful Paul would talk
[1:54:38] about us like do you know when you
[1:54:40] should be
[1:54:43] teachers you should we should be able to
[1:54:45] be teachers but yet we got to come back
[1:54:47] uh to the milk of the word because we're
[1:54:49] not even able to handle the ABCs
[1:54:52] now our text says if we walk in the
[1:54:54] light as he is in the light we have
[1:54:55] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:54:56] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[1:54:58] from all sin you know brother Brandon
[1:55:00] would go through this sermon he would
[1:55:02] start to talk about how there's only one
[1:55:04] provided place of worship and he says if
[1:55:06] there's only one provided place of
[1:55:07] worship then we better be real careful
[1:55:09] and make sure we get there if there's
[1:55:11] only one provided place of worship let's
[1:55:13] be sure that we find that one place this
[1:55:17] morning he said oh your worship can be
[1:55:19] sincere Jesus would say uhhh in vain do
[1:55:22] they worship me you ought to be careful
[1:55:24] there's one provided place of worship it
[1:55:26] says in vain do they worship me teaching
[1:55:28] for the doctrines of
[1:55:32] men if we're not careful we put that out
[1:55:35] somewhere but we need to take heed to
[1:55:36] ourselves Lord I don't want to worship
[1:55:38] you in vain just like Cain and
[1:55:41] Abel they both receiv received the
[1:55:43] Commandment of worship they both brought
[1:55:45] an off offering they both brought a
[1:55:47] sacrifice but God respected Abel's
[1:55:49] sacrifice and he rejected canes the
[1:55:51] prophet of God would say it like this in
[1:55:53] this sermon he would say but Abel by
[1:55:56] faith which is revelation the word of
[1:55:58] God revealed made plain showed out and
[1:56:01] Vindicated oh I want to say when it's
[1:56:03] revealed like that to you there's no
[1:56:05] more
[1:56:08] guesswork how many has ever taken a
[1:56:10] multiple choice
[1:56:13] test I used to love those because at
[1:56:16] least I had a 25% to get it
[1:56:20] right and you know you color it and you
[1:56:22] might not color it in so dark because
[1:56:24] you don't know if the answer but when
[1:56:26] you're sure man you really put that
[1:56:28] number two pencil to work I know I'm not
[1:56:31] erasing this one you go back and look at
[1:56:33] my test I fill it in like and then I
[1:56:35] read another another question further
[1:56:37] down like oh no that means this one back
[1:56:40] here you know I'm like I think this
[1:56:42] one's given the answer to that you look
[1:56:43] at my test this answer was erased and
[1:56:45] filled back in like you you you look at
[1:56:48] it but I want to tell you when the Holy
[1:56:49] Ghost comes and reveals it to you
[1:56:52] there's no more guesswork you're not
[1:56:54] wondering well I wonder if it's this I
[1:56:56] wonder if it's that when the question
[1:56:57] arises and say I know by Revelation what
[1:57:00] God desires Abel wasn't sitting there
[1:57:02] wondering well I see C's but you wonder
[1:57:05] Abel might have felt a little
[1:57:07] intimidated he coming up with that
[1:57:09] little lamb and here's this little dirty
[1:57:10] stinking lamb and he's walking up there
[1:57:13] to the gate back to the Garden of Eden
[1:57:14] and that's being guarded by a cherin
[1:57:17] with flaming angels and Cain has this
[1:57:19] big beautiful sacrifice and all a sudden
[1:57:21] that re start telling that's something
[1:57:24] that God
[1:57:26] wants and maybe he walking up there and
[1:57:28] seeing the flowers and all of the fruits
[1:57:30] and everything piled up in a big display
[1:57:33] you kind of feel like that when you go
[1:57:35] to some anniversaries and some parties
[1:57:37] and everything and then it comes your
[1:57:38] turn to throw in you like my goodness I
[1:57:40] can't I can't match up to that well just
[1:57:43] do what you can do well we're not trying
[1:57:45] to measure up with everybody else just
[1:57:47] be yourself just do what you can get you
[1:57:49] can do out of the love of your heart I
[1:57:50] want to say if it's out of the love of
[1:57:51] your heart it's
[1:57:54] enough if it's by Revelation I want to
[1:57:57] say it's
[1:57:58] enough and I say that Revelation was
[1:58:01] there in Abel's heart as he was coming
[1:58:03] up it didn't look like much oh it didn't
[1:58:06] look like much but it was what was going
[1:58:08] to please the Lord and when it showed
[1:58:11] out to you and it's Vindicated I want to
[1:58:13] tell you there ain't no more guesswork I
[1:58:15] want to tell you this message is
[1:58:17] Vindicated this message is Vindicated by
[1:58:20] a Vindicated prophet traveled around the
[1:58:22] world seven
[1:58:24] times Pillar of Fire showing up time and
[1:58:27] time again I want to say when it's
[1:58:29] revealed like that to you when it's
[1:58:31] Vindicated that you know that you know
[1:58:33] that you know there is no more
[1:58:35] guesswork I'm not wondering how I'm
[1:58:37] going to get a body change I'm not
[1:58:39] wondering how I'm going to go in a
[1:58:41] Rapture I'm not wondering if I'm going
[1:58:42] to make it I'm not wondering if my
[1:58:44] name's written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:58:46] Life I know because it's been shown to
[1:58:48] me it's been
[1:58:50] Vindicated oh oh Hallelujah when it's
[1:58:53] revealed to you like
[1:58:56] that come on when it's revealed to you
[1:58:58] like
[1:59:00] that when you know what you're talking
[1:59:04] about reminds me of
[1:59:07] Elijah came time for a
[1:59:11] showdown what did Elijah
[1:59:14] say he said all
[1:59:16] right you go ahead and call on your
[1:59:19] Gods you go to your church you go to
[1:59:21] your religion whatever your theology is
[1:59:23] whatever it is go ahead and call on your
[1:59:25] Gods I said but why don't we let the god
[1:59:28] that answers by fire be
[1:59:31] God you know everybody said that sounds
[1:59:33] pretty good to
[1:59:37] me we'll accept that will you accept
[1:59:40] that will you let the God be God that
[1:59:42] answers by
[1:59:43] fire hey I know what I'm talking about I
[1:59:46] can look into the story and when I read
[1:59:48] that story and Elijah say let the god
[1:59:50] that answers by fire be God I can stand
[1:59:52] right here and say I know exactly what
[1:59:55] Elijah's talking about what do you mean
[1:59:57] you know what Elijah's talking about
[1:59:59] well I can tell you there was a time
[2:00:00] when I was in sin and I was so uh under
[2:00:04] Satan's foot I was born with a first
[2:00:07] nature whenever I would try to do right
[2:00:09] he would just rub my face when I
[2:00:10] couldn't break free I couldn't get
[2:00:12] delivered but you know one day I said
[2:00:15] Lord whatever that is it's bigger than
[2:00:18] me I imagine if Elijah was looking over
[2:00:20] the banner Street he said hey guys come
[2:00:22] here did you hear that he's calling on
[2:00:25] the name of the Lord you know who that
[2:00:26] is that's the one that answers by
[2:00:31] Fire come on and that fire came and
[2:00:34] changed
[2:00:36] me it was so to me it was Vindicated I
[2:00:40] ain't guessing and wondering I know that
[2:00:41] I was born again I know what I used to
[2:00:44] be and I know when the grace of God came
[2:00:47] and changed my life I was born again my
[2:00:49] old nature passed away all things became
[2:00:52] new I am a new creature in Jesus
[2:00:57] Christ
[2:01:01] Vindicated prophet of God would say this
[2:01:03] in paragraph 227 he says but by one
[2:01:05] Spirit we're all baptized into one body
[2:01:08] and that body is a family the family of
[2:01:11] God it is hot up here if we can get some
[2:01:13] air condition or
[2:01:17] something he says but by one Spirit
[2:01:19] we're all baptized into the body and
[2:01:21] that that body is a family the family of
[2:01:24] God and that's the house of go follow
[2:01:26] him

[2:06:20] pull this quote with that quote and try
[2:06:22] to make the message say something so you
[2:06:24] can understand it I them time it's too
[2:06:27] late to be playing church it's too late
[2:06:29] to be playing games I'll hear what this
[2:06:31] preacher said and that preacher said now
[2:06:33] I really understand what the son of man
[2:06:35] is you will never understand what the
[2:06:38] son of man is the only thing that you'll
[2:06:40] ever understand is that faith is a
[2:06:42] revelation and when it's revealed to you
[2:06:44] like that there is no guesswork I know
[2:06:46] where I'm standing I know what I'm
[2:06:48] talking just give me the book I don't
[2:06:51] want to play church just give me the

[2:07:13] might as well have
[2:07:18] church eat
[2:07:20] it thou must prophesy
[2:07:23] again but
[2:07:25] how how how can we teach spiritual
[2:07:28] things when you don't even do the common
[2:07:32] things other man said how can I teach
[2:07:35] them algebra when they won't even
[2:07:36] believe their ABCs
[2:07:39] first come on we're going somewhere
[2:07:42] Church these things ought to be common I
[2:07:44] don't want to go through all of it well
[2:07:45] you can look around and know the people
[2:07:47] who ain't got their ABCs down
[2:07:49] yet remember he said if you ain't
[2:07:51] preaching a clothline
[2:07:53] religion you ain't preaching the gospel
[2:07:56] and if I want to say if you ain't living
[2:07:57] a clothline religion you ain't living
[2:07:59] the
[2:08:00] gospel this word was made to be preached
[2:08:03] but it was made to be
[2:08:05] lived this word doesn't do any good to
[2:08:07] preach it with nobody living it there
[2:08:09] got to be somewhere somebody say you
[2:08:12] know what if that's the word of God I'm
[2:08:14] going to believe it I'm going to live
[2:08:17] it like I said I don't want to get on
[2:08:19] all these things but you know
[2:08:22] you know you're trying to just hug so
[2:08:24] close to the line you're trying to to
[2:08:27] just get by so close just to blend in So
[2:08:33] Close better watch
[2:08:36] out you just playing with your
[2:08:39] soup you're just playing with this thing
[2:08:42] well I can make the message I can make
[2:08:44] this to that so and so does this or that
[2:08:46] you know I can get by with it no you
[2:08:48] can't get by there's only one provided
[2:08:50] place of worship
[2:08:53] brother brandom said in this message he
[2:08:55] says now if you get everything running
[2:08:56] just right it's going to run everything
[2:08:59] set in order if there's a shorten in
[2:09:01] that wire that light won't come on
[2:09:03] because it's been grounded and when you
[2:09:04] take one of God's word or one of his
[2:09:07] places in your heart and have selfish
[2:09:09] objectives that'll ground the power of
[2:09:11] God right there look your attitude your
[2:09:14] motives and your objectives can limit
[2:09:17] the power of God moving in a situation
[2:09:20] you wonder why maybe things aren't
[2:09:21] happening in your marriage you wonder
[2:09:23] why they're not happening in your home
[2:09:24] you wonder why they ain't happen in the
[2:09:25] church maybe it's because your
[2:09:27] objectives and motives ain't right maybe
[2:09:29] ain't pulling on the word being preached
[2:09:31] because you're a little selfish maybe
[2:09:32] you got something in your heart that
[2:09:34] you're hiding maybe there's something
[2:09:35] you want to see materialize in the
[2:09:37] church and it hasn't happened just yet
[2:09:39] so you're sitting on the preacher you're
[2:09:40] sitting on the sound you're sitting on
[2:09:42] the the the song leader you're just
[2:09:44] sitting on people you ain't going to the
[2:09:45] youth services you ain't going to this
[2:09:47] and that because you just don't see that
[2:09:48] things are adding up the way you wanted
[2:09:50] I tell you get rid of your selfish
[2:09:52] motives get love in your heart and start
[2:09:54] projecting the love of
[2:09:58] God your attitude and your motives can
[2:10:01] limit the power of
[2:10:03] God you say what are you talking
[2:10:06] about brother Matthew how can you limit
[2:10:08] the power of God well I tell you a story
[2:10:10] one time that there was once a woman who
[2:10:13] had a blood
[2:10:15] issue but you know who else was standing
[2:10:17] there jarus was standing there and he
[2:10:21] watched a miracle take
[2:10:23] place he watched a woman who had a a
[2:10:26] blood issue for several years be
[2:10:29] healed I like that story we could go
[2:10:31] into it but we don't have the time for
[2:10:32] it and all of a sudden jarus oh you can
[2:10:35] imagine his heart was welling up with
[2:10:38] inside of him he said praise the Lord
[2:10:41] this is the
[2:10:42] Messiah and then one of his his servants
[2:10:45] come up to and said trouble not the
[2:10:47] master it's too late
[2:10:51] it's hopeless you done messed up your
[2:10:54] marriage you done messed up your family
[2:10:56] you done messed up your job you done
[2:10:58] messed up in the church you done made
[2:11:00] the mistake you'll never be restored
[2:11:02] there ain't no way back for you you're
[2:11:05] never going to make it you sold away
[2:11:07] your virtue there's no way a brother
[2:11:09] will ever love you because you made this
[2:11:11] mistake now you're battling suicide
[2:11:13] thoughts you're battling if you ever
[2:11:15] belong in the place of God all these
[2:11:17] things oh the devil trying to discourage
[2:11:19] you but then the son of man said fear
[2:11:21] not
[2:11:22] not fear not only
[2:11:28] believe now Jesus was on the scene he's
[2:11:31] with jarus fear not only believe he
[2:11:34] comes
[2:11:35] back comes into the house he sees her
[2:11:38] laying
[2:11:39] there and he
[2:11:41] says Don't
[2:11:44] Fear she is not dead but she sleepeth
[2:11:51] they were all
[2:11:52] mourning they were all
[2:11:55] crying I don't know why that comes to me
[2:11:57] now
[2:11:58] but there's a lot of things we mourn and
[2:12:00] cry over think the days of Miracles have
[2:12:02] passed oh if brother Brandon would just
[2:12:04] just have been here maybe if brother so-
[2:12:06] and so was here he could really break
[2:12:08] down the Seven
[2:12:09] Seals oh if that brother if this brother
[2:12:12] if that if
[2:12:13] that oh you're you're you're mourning
[2:12:16] you're complaining then somebody says no
[2:12:19] it ain't what you think it is
[2:12:21] you're all flustered you're all upset
[2:12:24] you're all crying you're all worried
[2:12:26] about this situation because there's no
[2:12:29] hope and nothing can change it but then
[2:12:32] the son of man says she is not dead but
[2:12:34] she sleeps and all of a sudden they
[2:12:36] started to laugh him to
[2:12:40] scorn you know what he
[2:12:43] did he said all right all you

[2:15:48] come when I called
[2:15:51] you love us we're friends brother
[2:15:53] brandom said she had a right to do that
[2:15:57] we grew up together when your parents
[2:15:59] died you come and live with us we grew
[2:16:01] up Lazarus your best friends we've been
[2:16:03] buddies and I called for
[2:16:05] you you've healed this person you've
[2:16:07] raised this person for I've been in need
[2:16:10] my wife's been sick for this many years
[2:16:12] this has been going on I called for you
[2:16:14] and didn't come she never approached him
[2:16:17] like
[2:16:18] that the prophet of God said she had a
[2:16:21] right to but he says when you become a
[2:16:24] lamb you surrender your rights the
[2:16:27] reason you don't come to church on
[2:16:28] Sunday night you haven't surrendered
[2:16:30] your rights the reason you don't give
[2:16:32] the word of God preeminence you haven't
[2:16:33] surrendered your rights because you
[2:16:35] still have a right to do what you want
[2:16:37] to do but I want to tell you when God
[2:16:39] got a hold of my life and I got baptized
[2:16:42] and filled with the Holy Ghost I lost
[2:16:44] all of my rights because I was purchased
[2:16:47] by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[2:16:50] ain't got no more
[2:16:53] rights sure I got to Die
[2:16:57] daily that first nature tries to pop its
[2:17:00] head off I got tell him I'm dead to
[2:17:04] you I want the word deal with your heart
[2:17:07] now I know my ABCs well do you quit
[2:17:10] sympathizing with it quit playing with
[2:17:11] your
[2:17:13] food prophet of God she had a right why
[2:17:16] did you come we left everything and you
[2:17:19] didn't even call when I called
[2:17:21] brother R said it like this she had that
[2:17:23] right but she forfeited that right to
[2:17:27] recognize the word of God manifested
[2:17:29] right before
[2:17:32] her you want to see the word of God
[2:17:35] manifested right before you surrender
[2:17:37] your rights you want to see the power of
[2:17:39] God in your life surrender your rights
[2:17:41] you want to see God move on the things
[2:17:43] that you've been praying for surrender
[2:17:45] your rights
[2:17:55] Lord if you had have been
[2:17:56] here my brother would not have been de
[2:17:59] the prophet of God would go on and say
[2:18:01] you see the reason why is because death
[2:18:03] and life can't stay in the same
[2:18:06] channel oh how let me just get in the
[2:18:09] channel of life let me just get into a
[2:18:12] holy spirit atmosphere let me just get
[2:18:15] in the right channel I don't care how
[2:18:17] bad things look I don't care how
[2:18:19] everything is going wrong oh Lord let me
[2:18:20] just step into the channel of Life there
[2:18:23] when all the Death and All the waves and
[2:18:25] everything's crashing around I know that
[2:18:27] I'm safe from all harm the prophet of
[2:18:30] God would say like this he said you're
[2:18:32] sealed in there you're beneath the blood
[2:18:34] you don't go out anymore and then what
[2:18:36] are you do God's son is God's family
[2:18:39] sealed in the Holy Spirit the devil
[2:18:41] couldn't get to you if he had to oh do
[2:18:45] you know what it's like to be under the
[2:18:47] blood of the Lamb of God sealed with the
[2:18:49] Holy Ghost the devil can't even get to
[2:18:52] you if he had to I feel good I feel like
[2:18:55] preaching I feel like I ain't bound to
[2:18:57] time cuz I know what I'm talking about

[2:23:39] there said Lazarus why did he say
[2:23:41] Lazarus because if he said come forth

[2:24:34] him come on where's the voice
[2:24:38] now where is the voice

[2:24:48] cry speak speak to the mountain brother
[2:24:52] R said I used to never touch that
[2:24:53] because I couldn't Wonder but he said
[2:24:55] when it says you speak to the now it
[2:24:56] puts you back in the word every time
[2:24:58] brother Brandon went through the five
[2:25:00] manifestations of the third pool he
[2:25:03] would say and he said but it was him
[2:25:04] saying it so you see where has to come
[2:25:06] is that Unity that Oneness where it's
[2:25:09] not just you speaking it's him speaking
[2:25:10] it's not just him speaking it's you
[2:25:12] speak y'all become one you is that the
[2:25:14] Lord or that brother brandom oh then now
[2:25:16] now you're getting somewhere now you're
[2:25:18] recognizing the Oneness and that same
[2:25:19] Oneness that that was manifested in the
[2:25:21] prophet he wants to manifest in
[2:25:23] you now we're talking about Oneness now
[2:25:26] we're talking about Unity now we're
[2:25:28] talking about deity
[2:25:31] speaking but
[2:25:33] how can you teach the great things when
[2:25:37] you won't do the simple common things he
[2:25:40] said if you can't do the common things
[2:25:42] how are you going to do the spiritual
[2:25:43] things now Paul would say in Ephesians 1
[2:25:46] n having made known the mystery un
[2:25:48] having made known unto us the mystery of
[2:25:49] his will according to his good pleasure
[2:25:51] which he hath purposed in himself 1 John
[2:25:52] 5:14 and this is the confidence that we
[2:25:54] have sorry interpreters it'll be
[2:25:55] recorded and this is the confidence that
[2:25:57] we have in him that but if it's recorded
[2:25:59] don't listen to me listen to a prophet
[2:26:01] and this is the confidence that we have
[2:26:02] in him that if we ask anything according
[2:26:04] to his will he heareth
[2:26:06] us now the prophet of God said there is
[2:26:09] only one way to know his
[2:26:11] will I'll back up Lord forgive me I
[2:26:13] don't mean to rush the Lord Ephesians
[2:26:15] 1:9 having made known unto us the
[2:26:17] mystery of his will according to the
[2:26:19] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[2:26:22] himself so he's made known to us his
[2:26:25] mystery oh if anyone if anyone knows the
[2:26:31] mystery of his will that's I don't know
[2:26:33] about you but I ain't wondering I know I
[2:26:36] know what he come to do I know what he
[2:26:38] wants to do with me I know what he wants
[2:26:40] to manifest in my life I know what he
[2:26:42] wants to manifest in my marriage I know
[2:26:44] what he wants my kids to be I know what
[2:26:46] he wants this church to be I know what
[2:26:48] he wants you to be I ain't wondering
[2:26:51] because his will has been revealed and 1
[2:26:54] John 5:14 says and this is the
[2:26:56] confidence right if your heart don't
[2:26:57] condemn you you have this confidence
[2:26:59] we're going to get somewhere we'll we'll
[2:27:01] try to we'll try to turn an hour into a
[2:27:03] few minutes he says and this is the
[2:27:05] confidence that we have in him that if
[2:27:07] we ask anything according to his will he
[2:27:09] heareth
[2:27:11] us let it sink in let it
[2:27:14] marinate you know how you make good
[2:27:15] chicken fajitas good steak
[2:27:18] fajitas let them
[2:27:20] marinate let that marinate for a second
[2:27:24] this is the
[2:27:25] confidence that we have in
[2:27:27] him that if we ask
[2:27:31] anything according to what your wants
[2:27:35] your
[2:27:36] desires according to his
[2:27:38] will he heareth us and it goes on to say
[2:27:41] and if he heareth us we know we have the
[2:27:43] petitions that we
[2:27:45] asked the prophet of God would say this
[2:27:47] in the church age book he he would say
[2:27:49] there's only way to know his will and
[2:27:51] that is by the word of God he says if it
[2:27:54] isn't in the word you can't have
[2:27:57] it so we can't ask unless it's in the
[2:28:00] word I want to go a little further and
[2:28:02] say if it ain't in the word I don't want
[2:28:07] it all right so I I I just want you to
[2:28:10] catch that wrap that up because brother
[2:28:11] randam says this in God's provided way
[2:28:13] preach this in April 25 he says the
[2:28:15] church will come through justification
[2:28:17] through Luther through sanctification
[2:28:18] through Wesley through the baptism of
[2:28:19] the Holy Holy Ghost and the Pentecostals
[2:28:21] and go right on into the Perfection of
[2:28:23] the son of man that when husband and
[2:28:25] wife will be the selfsame
[2:28:31] persons this is in the
[2:28:35] word God will be so manifested in his
[2:28:38] bride his church okay they will be both
[2:28:41] the same they are one now you see where
[2:28:46] we're at am you you can have that
[2:28:51] I said you can have
[2:28:54] that it
[2:28:56] says the Perfection of the son of man
[2:28:59] that when husband and wife will be the
[2:29:01] selfsame persons God will be so
[2:29:04] manifested in you that you will be the
[2:29:07] same you will be one I see it in the
[2:29:11] word that means you can ask for it God
[2:29:14] so manifested in you the Perfection of
[2:29:17] the son of man Ministry in the bride God
[2:29:19] being so manifested in you oh let this
[2:29:22] mind be in you that was also in Christ
[2:29:24] Jesus he says don't hold to them
[2:29:27] traditions and those Creeds they were
[2:29:28] all right for their day but the flower
[2:29:31] has come has Bloom to a blossom now it's
[2:29:34] seed
[2:29:36] time that's right Jesus Promised these
[2:29:38] things now when we see God make his
[2:29:41] promise live before us and see that it's
[2:29:44] in us and his spirit is living in us
[2:29:48] that is the only way of worship
[2:29:50] ship H Hallelujah the father seeks such
[2:29:55] to worship him oh Christianity is
[2:29:57] plagued with with with idolatry and
[2:30:00] traditions but there is a people on the
[2:30:03] Earth that aren't just worshiping him in
[2:30:05] spirit we are worshiping him in spirit
[2:30:08] and in truth and the father seeketh such
[2:30:12] to worship him because he hath made the
[2:30:15] mystery of his will revealed to you that
[2:30:17] you can give him the worship he deserves
[2:30:22] Hallelujah that is the only way of
[2:30:24] worship only place of worship the only
[2:30:27] true way you can worship for there is no
[2:30:31] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[2:30:34] Jesus we're talking about knowing your
[2:30:36] ABCs tell that devil to take a
[2:30:41] hike it's
[2:30:43] finished it's
[2:30:45] over you never did it in the first place
[2:30:50] how are you ever going to speak a
[2:30:52] mountain when you can't get over your
[2:30:54] own sin how are you ever going to stand
[2:30:56] in the gap for somebody else when you
[2:30:58] can't get over your own sin how are you
[2:31:00] ever going to project the love of God
[2:31:02] and watch Sovereign Grace come over when
[2:31:04] you can't even accept the revelation of
[2:31:06] justification but when you catch the
[2:31:08] Revelation under justification not under
[2:31:12] Luther that was a partial light but when
[2:31:15] the son of man came he said I'll tell
[2:31:18] you what full justification is it's the
[2:31:21] fullness of redemption I'm taking you
[2:31:24] back to the Garden of Eden back to the
[2:31:26] logos where you never even did it you
[2:31:28] were you were your name was written on
[2:31:30] the Lamb's Book of Life you never did it
[2:31:32] in the first place that's the
[2:31:36] confidence that's the where were you job
[2:31:39] when the sons of God shouted for that's
[2:31:41] the
[2:31:44] confidence when that devil tries to tell
[2:31:46] you you lost your virtue my virtue is in
[2:31:48] Jesus Christ
[2:31:51] I have no virtue the only virtue I got
[2:31:54] is in the blood of the Lamb Rahab didn't
[2:31:57] have any virtue but what she had was a
[2:31:59] token Hallelujah and all she had to do
[2:32:02] was show the
[2:32:05] token and her whole civilization
[2:32:07] crumbled around her and she was
[2:32:12] saved Hallelujah talk about a worship
[2:32:15] you think Rahab
[2:32:17] worshiped you wonder why maram worshiped
[2:32:21] you wonder why I
[2:32:22] worship because that Taskmaster that
[2:32:25] whooped me and beat me and told me
[2:32:27] you're going to smoke when I tell you to
[2:32:29] smoke you're going to drink when I tell
[2:32:31] you to drink you're going to steal when
[2:32:32] I tell you to steal but one day I called
[2:32:35] on the name of the Lord and the god that
[2:32:37] answers by fire consumed the sacrifice
[2:32:40] because I came in sincerity and in truth
[2:32:43] and really wanted to be delivered and he
[2:32:45] changed
[2:32:46] me I'm talking about a God that answers
[2:32:48] by fire
[2:32:52] Hallelujah
[2:32:55] Hallelujah Jesus Promised these
[2:32:59] things now when we see God make his
[2:33:02] promise live before us and see that it's
[2:33:05] in us and his Spirit living in us that
[2:33:08] is the only way of worship only place of
[2:33:11] worship the only true way to worship for
[2:33:14] there is no condemnation of them which
[2:33:16] are in Christ Jesus God made the promise
[2:33:19] Jesus said the things that I do you'll
[2:33:22] do
[2:33:23] also and what he would do in these last
[2:33:25] days how it come through this age
[2:33:29] neither light nor day would it be the
[2:33:31] like of Darkness time but said in the
[2:33:33] evening time it shall be light he would

[2:33:40] traveled just like the sun the same Sun
[2:33:43] that Rose in the East sets in the west
[2:33:45] he said it traveled just like three
[2:33:47] civilizations over three

[2:37:10] I'm so glad that a man can be so
[2:37:13] completely serve god Till the devil
[2:37:16] don't know what to do with them
[2:37:22] I'm trying to show you things laying in
[2:37:24] the word that you can ask
[2:37:26] for now I know my abc it's in the
[2:37:31] word the prophet of God said it got to a
[2:37:34] place
[2:37:35] where Pharaoh got so
[2:37:38] sick of
[2:37:40] Moses speaking the word he got so
[2:37:44] sick he got so sick of him preaching he
[2:37:48] got so sick of his word being manifested
[2:37:51] he finally said Moses take you and the
[2:37:54] Believers and get out of here now I
[2:37:57] believe the bride of Christ is going to
[2:37:59] get such to a place where they're so in
[2:38:01] harmony with the message and so in
[2:38:03] harmony with the Lord Jesus Christ where
[2:38:05] the devil doesn't even know what to do
[2:38:07] with you he keeps trying to bombard you
[2:38:09] with this and nothing is working he's
[2:38:12] going back down to Hell I tried him with
[2:38:13] temptation I tried him with doubt I
[2:38:16] tried him with lust I tried him with
[2:38:17] this I even Afflicted his family I
[2:38:19] Afflicted his wife I Afflicted his
[2:38:21] daughters I Afflicted everybody but
[2:38:23] they're just like job why because inside
[2:38:25] of job was a revelation he was a seed of
[2:38:28] God and though the skin worms eat my
[2:38:30] flesh I will see my God though he slay
[2:38:33] me yet I'll serve
[2:38:34] him there's a revelation in you

[2:38:50] brother
[2:38:50] Matthew well this is what a prophet said
[2:38:53] and you must be ging again he said but

[2:39:12] don't settle for anything less I ain't
[2:39:14] going to settle for anything less than
[2:39:15] what happened in the upper
[2:39:17] room look what Peter had I want it what
[2:39:20] Paul had I want it what brother Brer had
[2:39:22] I want it and you can have it because
[2:39:25] it's laying in the
[2:39:27] word the same word that was made flesh
[2:39:29] in the prophet if you keep following it
[2:39:32] you keep believing it look it was a
[2:39:35] sheep wave showing you what you're going
[2:39:36] to be you keep believing it then that
[2:39:39] word will become flesh in
[2:39:42] you come
[2:39:44] on that word will be made flesh in you
[2:39:49] he he didn't preach perfect Faith so
[2:39:52] that you would never get
[2:39:54] it he didn't preach possessing the Gate
[2:39:57] of the enemy so you would just try he
[2:40:01] didn't preach how can I overcome so you
[2:40:03] would try to figure it out but he was
[2:40:05] telling you what the potential of the
[2:40:07] seed was that God had placed in you
[2:40:10] before the foundation of the world that
[2:40:12] you can have perfect faith that you can
[2:40:14] possess the Gate of the enemy that you
[2:40:16] can overcome
[2:40:21] you can just read sermon titles and get
[2:40:23] a
[2:40:25] Revival just start reading the sermon
[2:40:28] titles and you get a
[2:40:30] Revival there's a man here that can turn
[2:40:32] on the
[2:40:34] light he preached that 12:29 in the
[2:40:37] morning you know what he preached in the
[2:40:39] evening Look Away to
[2:40:42] Jesus why can you look away to Jesus cuz
[2:40:45] there's a man here who turned on the
[2:40:47] light and all those denominational crck
[2:40:49] roaches had to scatter and The Awakening
[2:40:52] of the Bride came and he said there he
[2:40:54] is the son of man standing the same
[2:40:57] yesterday today look and
[2:41:00] live oh Hallelujah you mean he preached
[2:41:03] these things because he's wanting that
[2:41:05] word to be materialized in
[2:41:07] me oh hallelujah hallelujah he preached
[2:41:11] it so that you could live
[2:41:13] it it was the same God who said let
[2:41:16] there be
[2:41:17] light was the same God standing here
[2:41:20] saying if thou can't believe all things
[2:41:23] are
[2:41:26] possible why did he preach why Christ
[2:41:31] speak why did he preach it so you would
[2:41:34] quit
[2:41:36] crying uh
[2:41:39] oh we're talking about knowing our
[2:41:42] ABCs he preached why Christ speak so
[2:41:45] you'd quit
[2:41:46] crying and speak I a lot of us has quit
[2:41:51] crying but have we started speaking oh
[2:41:58] Hallelujah well we're going to have to
[2:42:00] come to a
[2:42:01] close we'll see how we can get
[2:42:04] here my is everybody feeling all right
[2:42:08] wow praise God we'll try to wrap this up
[2:42:11] in five
[2:42:12] minutes the prophet of God would say
[2:42:15] this he would take Daniel 11:32 where it
[2:42:18] says uh but the people that will know
[2:42:20] their God shall be strong and do
[2:42:22] exploits and brother Brandon would tie
[2:42:24] that with what we read in our text he
[2:42:25] would say it like this he'd say they
[2:42:26] that do wise Daniel said in these last
[2:42:29] days we'll do exploits for their gods
[2:42:31] see they'll walk in the light as he is
[2:42:33] in the light see he's tying those two
[2:42:35] things together because there is a
[2:42:37] people that know their God they will be
[2:42:41] strong they will do
[2:42:45] exploits why this is sea time this is
[2:42:49] Rapture time we know the mystery of his
[2:42:51] will we know who we are he's revealed
[2:42:54] not only who the son of man is but he's
[2:42:56] revealing to the bride of Christ who you
[2:42:58] are what your position is what you can
[2:43:01] do why cist speak to the mountain if
[2:43:03] thou can't believe all things are
[2:43:06] possible to them that believe this is
[2:43:08] the appointed time it's seed time it's
[2:43:10] Rapture time this is the season of the
[2:43:12] body change this is the season of the
[2:43:15] manifestation of the sons of God you say
[2:43:17] well what happens if you go by the way
[2:43:18] of the the grave I'm coming
[2:43:20] up I said I'm coming up you can't have
[2:43:23] the Rapture without me and if I go in
[2:43:25] the grave first guess what you ain't
[2:43:27] going to hinder
[2:43:28] me I'm coming up I might be the one that
[2:43:31] comes and knock on your door and say boo
[2:43:33] hey why you scaring me the change is
[2:43:36] on don't bother me how I get there I

[2:43:41] play my
[2:43:44] part I like this he says we'll try to
[2:43:47] end maybe right around here
[2:43:51] he says that if it isn't in the word you
[2:43:53] can't have it so we can't ask unless
[2:43:56] it's in the
[2:43:57] word maybe I'll say it like this don't

[2:44:05] hamburger sir and don't go to

[2:46:14] hallelujah praise His wonderful name
[2:46:25] oh there's a real genuine baptism of the
[2:46:27] Holy
[2:46:31] Ghost prophet of God would say
[2:46:34] this on the wings of a snow white
[2:46:37] dove he's saying that's the way it is
[2:46:40] with a real
[2:46:41] Christian did you know a real Christian
[2:46:43] doesn't
[2:46:45] have even any sin at all imputed to him
[2:46:50] we're talking
[2:46:51] about love being
[2:46:55] projected you talk about Sovereign Grace
[2:46:58] and if you've experienced it oh when you
[2:47:01] start projecting that love into your
[2:47:03] life into other people's
[2:47:08] life David said blessed is the man whom
[2:47:10] God will not impute sin when you're
[2:47:13] washed in the blood of the Lamb not by a
[2:47:16] make belief but really the blood of the
[2:47:19] lamb God does not impute to anything
[2:47:22] that's done because you're under the
[2:47:24] blood and he doesn't see it there's a
[2:47:26] blood
[2:47:27] sacrifice the only thing he can see you
[2:47:31] in is the way he saw you before the
[2:47:34] foundation of the world when he put your
[2:47:37] name in the Lamb's Book of
[2:47:40] Life you want to know how the Lord sees
[2:47:43] you he's been trying to tell you through
[2:47:45] 12200 sermons through the mouth of
[2:47:48] Malachi 4:5 that if you would repent and
[2:47:51] accept his provided way of worship in
[2:47:53] the end time and be birthed under the
[2:47:55] message of Malachi 45 according to the
[2:47:58] revealed word you are Justified you
[2:48:00] never did it in the first place
[2:48:02] therefore you can have the confidence to
[2:48:04] speak to the
[2:48:05] mountain I say it's time we accept what
[2:48:09] the word says you are you are free you
[2:48:13] are delivered you are sinless you are
[2:48:17] sinless you never did it in the first
[2:48:19] place you can't have that perfect Faith
[2:48:21] look why he is here the Capstone is
[2:48:26] here my Bible tells me in 1 John 4:18
[2:48:30] there is no fear in
[2:48:32] love but perfect love cast out fear
[2:48:36] because fear hath torment well what are
[2:48:38] you scared about church there's a man
[2:48:41] here that can turn on the
[2:48:42] light no matter how dark no matter how
[2:48:46] hopeless no matter how sick
[2:48:49] he said I did not come to bring you fear
[2:48:52] he said but I came to bring you love
[2:48:55] courage and ability he said all of my
[2:48:58] promises are yours you speak the word
[2:49:01] and I'll back it
[2:49:03] up I'm talking about knowing your
[2:49:07] ABCs well come on John Ryan John Ryan
[2:49:11] had his ABCs
[2:49:13] down
[2:49:15] right he come back to the prayer line
[2:49:17] cuz he he didn't have his ABC
[2:49:19] right yeah you you heard a kids say it
[2:49:21] they'll say they're ABCs AB i j KZ no
[2:49:25] you don't know it let's start again John
[2:49:28] John Ryan thought he knew it but he came
[2:49:29] back through and he said I thought you
[2:49:30] said I was healed he said I thought you
[2:49:33] said you believed he said okay I got it
[2:49:36] he said you go testify okay see some of
[2:49:39] you believe but you haven't started
[2:49:42] testifying what are you waiting
[2:49:46] for are you scared
[2:49:49] is it not a
[2:49:50] revelation my scripture tells me Abraham
[2:49:53] staggered not at the promise of God but
[2:49:57] he was strong in faith giving Glory unto
[2:50:01] God knowing that he who made the
[2:50:06] promise is faithful to perform it that's
[2:50:10] way the why I act the way I act because
[2:50:12] I know the one that made the promise the
[2:50:14] same one that pulled me out of sin is
[2:50:16] the same one that's going to change my
[2:50:18] body
[2:50:21] the same one that saved me and
[2:50:22] Sanctified me and filled with all the El
[2:50:24] it's the same one that brings the
[2:50:28] healing if you walk in the
[2:50:34] light if you walk in the
[2:50:37] light we're going somewhere
[2:50:40] Church you say where are you going where
[2:50:43] you going
[2:50:44] Abraham I'm
[2:50:46] walking why you walking
[2:50:49] cuz I'm walking out of this
[2:50:51] condition into the promise of God you
[2:50:55] say you've been praying for healing I'm
[2:50:57] looking at you I see you walking what
[2:50:59] are you doing I'm walking what are you
[2:51:02] saying I'm saying thank God for my
[2:51:03] healing and when I'm fully healed I'm
[2:51:06] going to testify I I'm going to use this
[2:51:09] healed body to spread the gospel I'm
[2:51:11] going to take this healed body I'm going
[2:51:12] to serve the church and serve you got to
[2:51:14] have a reason to be
[2:51:16] healed these are ABCs
[2:51:19] if you walk in the
[2:51:20] light Prophet said Enoch just walked
[2:51:23] kept walking in the light so one day he
[2:51:27] felt his feet getting off the ground and
[2:51:29] he just kept walking and he walked on
[2:51:32] into the glory without even
[2:51:36] dying let's just
[2:51:38] pray Lord
[2:51:40] Jesus it's been a little bit lengthy of
[2:51:43] a service Lord
[2:51:44] [Music]
[2:51:45] but just know your heart for the people
[2:51:47] as we want to come to a
[2:51:49] place that we've settled it once and for
[2:51:51] all we know our ABCs
[2:51:53] and your love has been projected to us
[2:51:56] Lord
[2:51:57] where Sovereign Grace is taken
[2:52:01] over lord if your Sovereign Grace is
[2:52:03] taken over in our
[2:52:05] [Music]
[2:52:07] lives Lord now we can start projecting
[2:52:10] that love to
[2:52:12] others Lord it
[2:52:14] was it was your Prophet who was going
[2:52:17] about your will
[2:52:19] to go pray for the sick when he
[2:52:20] Disturbed that
[2:52:23] bull but he was in a place to project
[2:52:27] love and grace took
[2:52:30] over lord it was when he bumped into
[2:52:32] that hornet nest he was just doing the
[2:52:34] chores at the
[2:52:35] [Music]
[2:52:36] house and he projected love and grace
[2:52:39] took
[2:52:41] over lord it seems like maybe there's
[2:52:43] disturbances in the church and in our
[2:52:46] relationships sometimes we feel like
[2:52:48] we're dealing with bulls and dealing
[2:52:49] with
[2:52:52] hornets and we can be so quick to judge
[2:52:54] and just cash judgment but Lord I see
[2:52:58] the humility and the surrender that your
[2:53:00] Prophet had where he projected
[2:53:04] love into a a situation in his life and
[2:53:10] Grace took over it Lord that speaks to
[2:53:13] me Lord I've benefited from your grace
[2:53:16] and your love and your blessing
[2:53:20] Lord I want to be so surrendered till
[2:53:21] you're so manifested in me that that
[2:53:23] Oneness is now in me that I can project
[2:53:25] that love into the situations in my
[2:53:29] life and that when I encounter somebody
[2:53:31] that's maybe fussing or having a hard
[2:53:34] time Lord that I could pray for
[2:53:37] him your scripture says that if we see
[2:53:40] somebody who sinned a sin not unto
[2:53:43] death that we can we can pray for them
[2:53:46] and they'll they'll receive life Lord
[2:53:48] and I believe believe that's the love
[2:53:49] you want us to have for one another if
[2:53:51] we see somebody that doesn't know their
[2:53:53] ABCs it's not to judge
[2:53:55] them but Lord if I could look out in
[2:53:57] their life and say I know the potential
[2:53:59] is in there and Lord I want to project
[2:54:02] my love for them Father that there'll be
[2:54:04] a Grace for them and Lord as we start to
[2:54:07] love one another we'll start to see this
[2:54:09] Sovereign Grace Just oh so flow
[2:54:12] overflowing our congregation with a love
[2:54:15] one for another and Sovereign Grace
[2:54:17] taking over that all these situations
[2:54:20] Lord it'll just be an expression of your
[2:54:22] great love in each one of us Lord I
[2:54:25] commit the people to you may you just
[2:54:27] bless them Lord they've they've labored
[2:54:30] and they've been here for a time we
[2:54:32] thank you for the reports and the things
[2:54:35] that were necessary of the church I pray
[2:54:36] that you just take this word may it
[2:54:39] benefit your people in Jesus Christ's
[2:54:40] name I
