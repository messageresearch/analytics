[14:50] wants to come at this time
[14:56] amen
[15:04] uh god bless you sense
[15:07] uh i'm not good at this but i'll try
[15:11] i promised to god a while ago
[15:14] you know brother matthew had called a
[15:16] prayer line
[15:18] you know and as he was preaching there
[15:20] was a burden
[15:21] upon my heart you know i had a test in
[15:23] front of me that i was really shaking in
[15:25] front of and
[15:27] you know it states licensing tests that
[15:29] i was really afraid that i would fail
[15:32] and then i came to the prayer line the
[15:34] first thing when i looked at me he was
[15:36] smiling and
[15:36] he just i told him you know i just need
[15:38] prayer you know for god's
[15:40] to grant me the wisdom to face it
[15:42] because i read on the
[15:44] you know on the stage things where he
[15:46] says only 50
[15:47] of people that text the test passes the
[15:49] test you know
[15:51] and i was sitting that was just like
[15:52] this is people that's been in this
[15:54] business
[15:55] for their whole life you know and i'm
[15:58] barely getting started so i was really
[16:00] worried when then brother matthew looks
[16:02] at me says you will
[16:03] have a high score i just like praise the
[16:06] lord and then
[16:07] he said a word of prayer and we moved on
[16:10] so from that night you know i just kind
[16:12] of went
[16:13] it uplifted my spirit a little bit but
[16:16] you know every time somebody will bring
[16:17] to me the report and be like this many
[16:19] people only passes the test you know i'm
[16:21] like i don't want to hear it
[16:23] but long story short
[16:26] you know this morning i woke up early
[16:29] morning i had an appointment to go check
[16:30] the test
[16:31] i hope you already can guess the result
[16:34] but then you know i just started first
[16:35] you know instead of revising i just
[16:37] started
[16:38] praising the lord early morning and then
[16:40] uh i walked into the test room
[16:43] you know from the moment i got into the
[16:45] moment i got out
[16:46] of the test it just felt like i didn't
[16:48] do anything
[16:49] but praise god i passed it with a very
[16:52] high score
[16:53] just like uh brother matthew said he was
[16:55] very high score
[16:56] you know i failed in 10 question out of
[16:59] like 90 some so it was really
[17:01] it was really something i'm still
[17:03] excited even if i don't look like
[17:05] it you know and another testimony i
[17:09] wanted to share
[17:09] was you know we had a men's breakfast
[17:12] i believe two weeks ago and you know we
[17:16] were calling an emergency trip
[17:18] back to colorado with my mom on you know
[17:21] some affairs
[17:22] that we had to finish up and
[17:25] we left here that saturday right after
[17:29] you know the meeting i was rushing we
[17:31] went to the airport and then we got
[17:33] there
[17:34] you know as the date went on we did
[17:36] everything that we were supposed to do
[17:38] but the sunday came in sunday morning i
[17:40] was driving with one of my old friends
[17:42] back in denver

[17:46] was trying to meditate
[17:48] so we went on to picking up uh you know
[17:51] two of the youth that we used to pick up

[18:28] sink in time and then i was just like
[18:30] sis do you need them in your alarm to
[18:31] wake up on sunday
[18:33] then you know i said it as a joke and
[18:36] then like she really gave me a sad look
[18:38] and she was just like no it's not an
[18:40] alarm i'm sorry it bothered you
[18:42] i'm actually suffering i was diagnosed
[18:44] with diabetes

[42:05] uh um we'll just trust the lord huh
[42:10] okay i mean you're all great students of
[42:12] the word
[42:13] i told gary i said you know what every
[42:16] now and then you've got to
[42:17] preach one that's not too good you know
[42:21] so but i just hope that i can
[42:24] express this to you this evening and
[42:27] it'll encourage you
[42:29] and bless you so if you have your bibles
[42:31] we'd like to read two scriptures
[42:34] one found in romans 1 and 17
[42:38] and the other found in romans 10
[42:42] and 17. so
[42:45] um
[42:48] i don't think it's a a coincidence
[42:51] that these scriptures are
[42:55] both the 17th scripture but
[42:58] we just trust that the word of god will
[43:02] be
[43:02] uplifting to you for
[43:06] herein is the righteousness of god
[43:10] revealed from faith
[43:13] to faith it is written
[43:16] the just shall live
[43:20] by faith and god the righteousness of
[43:24] god
[43:25] is revealed from faith to faith
[43:29] and then if we turn over to the
[43:33] seventh tenth chapter of romans and the
[43:36] 17th
[43:37] verse it says so then
[43:40] faith cometh by hearing and
[43:43] hearing by the word of god
[43:47] heavenly father we ask you to bless
[43:51] your word to us this evening in your
[43:54] precious name we pray
[43:55] amen amen god bless you may
[44:00] um be seated
[44:03] i'd like just to fellowship for a few
[44:06] moments i've been promising you
[44:10] that my sermons would start to get
[44:12] shorter
[44:13] and i hope i can keep my word tonight
[44:16] and keep this one and not so long but if
[44:22] i was the title this this evening
[44:24] i'd like to title it faith is contagious
[44:30] faith is contagious
[44:33] and we we um
[44:37] have talked a lot about uh
[44:40] contagion uh here uh
[44:44] lately and and uh uh
[44:47] because of what we call
[44:50] the plague or or whatever that
[44:53] you want to call it but we realized one
[44:57] thing
[44:57] that uh it it it was contagious
[45:03] and what contagious means is it spread
[45:06] by
[45:06] direct contact between people
[45:10] so you you had to come in contact
[45:15] with somebody that has it before
[45:18] you can get it and uh
[45:21] they uh they tried to
[45:25] build up all kinds of uh things to
[45:29] inoculate you so you wouldn't get it
[45:32] to put face masks on to stay
[45:36] six feet away
[45:39] from everybody because they realized
[45:42] it could be spread
[45:45] so they felt well what things can we do
[45:48] to
[45:49] uh keep it from uh spreading
[45:53] you know so they came up with all kinds
[45:55] of things
[45:56] to keep it from spreading you notice on
[45:59] all the lists
[46:00] they left out one thing and that was
[46:02] prayer
[46:04] you know uh they just they left out
[46:07] prayer
[46:07] you know and they they along with it
[46:12] they they they put the fear
[46:15] they attach fear with it so that
[46:18] uh you were afraid to get it
[46:22] now we're gonna say something but i want
[46:25] you to
[46:26] hold that thought about being
[46:29] afraid to get it that was
[46:32] the fear people stayed home
[46:36] people didn't go see people if
[46:39] you had it then if you stayed away from
[46:42] people
[46:43] you quarantined yourself and
[46:46] so that was because that was a sickness
[46:51] and we know that sickness is of the
[46:53] devil
[46:54] at all sicknesses of the devil in fact
[46:56] satan's army
[46:58] that's what he brings he brings sickness
[47:00] and death
[47:01] and and those are the things that he
[47:04] wants to but you know we're talking
[47:07] about faith
[47:09] and and faith is contagious
[47:12] too okay it's something that
[47:16] can be spread and uh
[47:19] if you don't isolate yourself
[47:23] to spread it you've got to come in
[47:26] contact
[47:27] to spread it because it's spread
[47:31] by contact and that's what we
[47:34] we said it spread from faith to faith
[47:38] so we realized that the scripture tells
[47:41] us
[47:41] that faith is contagious
[47:45] it's something that can be spread
[47:48] in fact the lord knew that so he told
[47:51] the
[47:52] disciples he said go into all the world
[47:55] and spread the gospel
[47:58] go out and infect people
[48:01] with what you have come in contact with
[48:05] people
[48:06] so they can get what you've got
[48:09] so because we realize that when we begin
[48:12] to see it that
[48:13] that faith is it's contagious
[48:17] it's spread from faith to faith and
[48:21] act and so with that so uh
[48:25] set in our hearts okay and our mind
[48:28] that we we realize that that faith
[48:32] cometh by hearing
[48:33] and hearing by the word of god so
[48:37] we understand that faith comes by
[48:41] a spread it's spread it's spread by
[48:44] coming in contact
[48:46] it's read by hearing and
[48:49] so we notice that when we're talked
[48:52] about this disease
[48:53] so this contagion of faith is
[48:57] is healing it's deliverance
[49:00] it's everything opposite
[49:03] of the other uh contagion
[49:07] this that contagion carried death this
[49:10] contagion
[49:11] carries life this contagion carries
[49:14] sickness
[49:15] this contagion carries a healing
[49:19] and so you notice that how these two run
[49:22] in parallel
[49:24] and how they run office the first thing
[49:26] that they want you to do with this
[49:28] sickness
[49:29] is quarantine yourself
[49:32] don't get close to nobody put a mask on
[49:35] your mouth
[49:36] so good that nobody can hear you and
[49:38] understand
[49:39] i mean i don't know about you i just
[49:41] have to be honest in my heart that
[49:44] i i hear people try to talk to me
[49:46] through that mask
[49:48] and after i get them to repeat four or
[49:51] five times
[49:52] i just have to keep myself from reaching
[49:54] up there and tearing that thing
[49:56] off their face and say what did you say
[49:59] you know and if you try to get closer to
[50:02] here they're backing up
[50:03] you know you know look i mean well let
[50:06] me tell you about this contagion
[50:08] the faith contagion the the faith that's
[50:12] contagious
[50:13] you don't back up
[50:17] hey amen you don't care if somebody gets
[50:20] right in your face
[50:22] amen if you really want them
[50:26] to hear it so so we we understand that
[50:29] faith is contagious and then first of
[50:33] all
[50:33] before you uh you
[50:36] you couldn't contagious or you couldn't
[50:39] be
[50:40] contagious until you had it
[50:44] if you understand if you don't have it
[50:47] you can't spread it
[50:50] you know so uh you know a lot of
[50:53] that was quite the uh controversy is
[50:56] that people didn't have it but yet they
[50:59] had to act
[51:00] like they did have it now in that
[51:04] just exactly what happens sometimes with
[51:07] with faith people act like they got it
[51:10] but they really don't have it
[51:12] and because they really don't have it
[51:14] they really can't spread it
[51:20] yeah you know what i'm saying so okay so
[51:22] therefore
[51:23] they're not contagious
[51:28] we want to be contagious we don't want
[51:31] to be not
[51:32] contagious you know this is
[51:36] one disease that we want to have
[51:39] that's one infection that we want to
[51:42] have we want to be infected
[51:44] by faith we want to have it
[51:48] and it's like anything anytime that they
[51:51] want to identify
[51:52] something that's contagious they give it
[51:55] symptoms
[51:58] so you can uh you can say uh
[52:02] oh you're doing this and you're doing
[52:04] this and you're doing this
[52:06] you know what i mean uh i i you know
[52:09] it's just like it got so bad that uh
[52:12] you know anybody that knows me knows
[52:14] that i sneeze
[52:15] uh every now and then i don't just knees
[52:18] once i
[52:20] i'm kind of a multi-sneezer
[52:24] and uh but if i would sneeze i mean you
[52:28] you the place would go silent everybody
[52:31] would jump back
[52:32] and oh is he got it is he contagious
[52:37] and then they look for symptoms you know
[52:39] what i mean
[52:40] i always thought that i i would like to
[52:42] sneeze sometime and then have all kinds
[52:44] of beads of
[52:45] sweat on my head and you have to
[52:49] look like you know it i make it cause
[52:52] i want to spread it but it wouldn't
[52:54] matter if i didn't have it
[52:57] i can't spread it and so is faith
[53:00] faith is a contagious but it can only be
[53:03] spread if you've got it
[53:06] you can only be spread if you've been
[53:09] infected look you have to get it
[53:12] somewhere it's got to come from
[53:14] somewhere it's in
[53:16] infected and that's what the lord did he
[53:19] they were there and he said now i want
[53:22] you to go up into this upper room
[53:24] and i want you to wait there until
[53:27] you're
[53:27] infected because when you come out of
[53:31] that upper room
[53:32] i want you to be contagious
[53:36] because faith is contagious and their
[53:39] very testimony
[53:41] shows that they were it was contagious
[53:43] so what i don't understand
[53:45] faith is contagious if you haven't got
[53:49] it
[53:49] you need to get around it
[53:56] so it can get off on you that's why we
[53:58] like to send our kids to camp
[54:01] because they can get in that atmosphere
[54:03] and people can get there and they get to
[54:06] praying
[54:07] and they get in the meeting and it's
[54:09] there and if it's real
[54:11] and it's there then they can get a good
[54:14] case of it
[54:16] amen let me tell you this contagion
[54:20] it's like the other contagion like the
[54:22] other faith if i could use it that way
[54:25] it it's a good sickness
[54:30] do you say brother mcgary you're using
[54:32] the word sickness for faith
[54:34] well the world thinks you're sick
[54:40] if you've got this infection of faith
[54:43] the world really thinks you're sick they
[54:46] think
[54:47] it's affected your mind it's affected
[54:49] your actions
[54:50] it's affected your thinking it gets can
[54:53] it's contagious but if you you get in
[54:56] that atmosphere
[54:58] and you get there and you're there then
[55:01] then
[55:01] it spreads and that's what you
[55:05] that's what you want to have happen
[55:08] you've got to
[55:09] you've got to uh you've got to
[55:11] understand that
[55:12] faith is something that can be
[55:15] spread if you're infected
[55:20] you can spread it
[55:23] that that's a that's the beautiful thing
[55:26] about it and so it's got symptoms
[55:32] you know what i'm saying faith has
[55:35] symptoms it
[55:36] it has things that show up if it has
[55:39] things that um makes a
[55:42] makes a difference so if you could
[55:46] think of it you know what i mean if you
[55:49] could think that
[55:50] that's what the lord
[55:54] did in your life is he came by
[55:58] and he infected you with
[56:02] his spirit
[56:05] and it it comes by contact
[56:10] that's what he said he said
[56:13] it's by faith to faith somebody had to
[56:16] go out and preach it
[56:17] paul went out to the gentiles and
[56:21] he was full of this uh of faith
[56:24] he was was full of in his heart and he
[56:27] got to a place
[56:28] and he was with a bunch of people that
[56:31] were
[56:32] weren't infected at all
[56:35] they didn't have no faith but but paul
[56:38] was full of it
[56:41] you know what i mean and he it wasn't
[56:43] something that
[56:44] he wanted to go and quarantine because
[56:47] he had it
[56:48] it wasn't something that he wanted to
[56:50] keep his distance
[56:52] because he had it but he wanted to he
[56:56] wanted to
[56:57] he wanted to be a spreader isn't that
[57:00] what we hear about today oh they're
[57:02] spreaders
[57:03] they're spreaders we have a joke about
[57:06] you know the brothers
[57:08] you know we call one another super
[57:10] spreaders
[57:13] oh you're just a super spreader well i
[57:15] don't feel sick at all i'm just i said
[57:17] yeah you're a super spreader well let me
[57:20] tell you paul was a super spreader
[57:22] [Applause]
[57:24] amen he wanted to spread what he had
[57:29] and i i don't know what they call it the
[57:32] uh
[57:32] center from disease control c
[57:36] d c you know that was that was them
[57:39] unbelievers all them scribes and them
[57:42] pharisees
[57:42] they were the ones that wanted to snuff
[57:45] it out
[57:46] they were the ones that wanted to put an
[57:48] end to it they were the ones that were
[57:49] trying to keep it going
[57:51] but not paul paul got up there and he
[57:54] looked for a way to spread it
[57:56] he got up there and said oh he says oh
[57:59] he said
[58:00] i noticed this altar here to the unknown
[58:04] god
[58:05] amen he had the opportunity now to do a
[58:08] little spreading
[58:10] amen he was going to infect some people
[58:13] and how was he going to infect him he
[58:15] was going to infect him
[58:17] with the word of god because the spread
[58:20] comes from the word of god it's spread
[58:23] by the word of god
[58:24] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[58:27] the word of god
[58:29] and it comes from infection to infection
[58:33] from faith to faith so you understand
[58:36] that
[58:36] we talk about spreading christianity but
[58:39] it
[58:39] isn't spread without personal contact
[58:47] that's why they do all kinds of tests
[58:50] and they said how long can this disease
[58:53] live on a surface and they found out it
[58:57] can't live two or three minutes
[59:00] and everybody's all worried about
[59:02] cleaning the surface
[59:06] you know what i mean i always marveled
[59:09] you get on the airplane and everybody's
[59:11] sitting right next to each other they're
[59:14] six inches behind just six inches neck
[59:16] and then they come on and said
[59:18] oh we've wiped the plane down
[59:22] we sprayed this spray
[59:26] in there well
[59:29] we've already got the best yes
[59:32] protection
[59:36] so we understand that it's got to it's
[59:39] got
[59:39] symptoms it's it's got to be it
[59:42] it's got to be contact to spread
[59:46] that's why he said go into all the world
[59:50] and and so we we begin to see
[59:53] that it it's symptoms and so we
[59:56] we look at just take a a a thought
[1:00:00] here about you know uh
[1:00:03] what what is it how how do you spread it
[1:00:08] that's what i'd want to know so i want
[1:00:11] to know
[1:00:11] i i'm commissioned to spread it
[1:00:17] go into all the world and infect
[1:00:20] other people with your faith
[1:00:25] and so what you're wanting to do
[1:00:29] is you're not trying to pass the
[1:00:31] knowledge
[1:00:33] of it you're trying to give them
[1:00:36] the symptoms of it
[1:00:39] you want them to experience the same
[1:00:41] thing you
[1:00:42] experience you want them for to them to
[1:00:45] feel the
[1:00:46] same effect that's like when you talk
[1:00:48] about
[1:00:49] someone was sick you say did you have
[1:00:51] covet and i said yeah i believe i had
[1:00:54] kobo well
[1:00:55] what did you feel like well i felt like
[1:00:58] a dish rag for
[1:01:00] for two weeks you know i felt i was fine
[1:01:04] when i was laying on my back but the
[1:01:06] minute i got up i i didn't feel i could
[1:01:10] stand well
[1:01:10] were you did you have a fever no did you
[1:01:13] were you nauseous no
[1:01:14] no and other people say yeah i had this
[1:01:16] symptom and
[1:01:17] that's the first thing everybody does
[1:01:20] they talk about symptoms because
[1:01:22] the first thing they want to know is if
[1:01:23] you really had it or not
[1:01:25] or or you just got a tail
[1:01:32] you know what i mean but somebody that's
[1:01:33] got it
[1:01:35] got it
[1:01:38] you know it's like someone that shows up
[1:01:40] with freckles and they didn't have
[1:01:41] freckles the day before
[1:01:43] you might just consider that they got
[1:01:45] measles
[1:01:47] does that disease exist anymore
[1:01:50] or smallpox or or or something
[1:01:54] you know so that you you've got to
[1:01:56] understand that
[1:01:57] this is a time that
[1:02:00] that there is a restoration
[1:02:05] so this in the last days there's a
[1:02:08] return
[1:02:09] to the infection that our fathers
[1:02:13] were infected with
[1:02:17] and there's a people that are going to
[1:02:21] be numbered amongst those
[1:02:24] that have received the
[1:02:28] faith disease
[1:02:33] you say why do you call it a disease
[1:02:35] because satan feels it's a disease
[1:02:38] because it's what kills him
[1:02:42] okay in his eyesight we look at a
[1:02:44] sickness and we say oh this is a disease
[1:02:47] this is bad why because it's going to
[1:02:49] make me sick
[1:02:50] why it's going to kill me it's going to
[1:02:53] affect me it's going to take my
[1:02:55] livelihood away from me and now satan's
[1:02:57] back doing the same thing
[1:02:58] oh stay away from that disease
[1:03:02] because that disease kills unbelief
[1:03:05] it kills the effect that satan has it
[1:03:09] keeps him from being able to change
[1:03:11] lives so so this is a this is a real
[1:03:14] something that we've received
[1:03:20] and that been passed down
[1:03:24] yes from infection
[1:03:28] to infection from
[1:03:31] faith to faith and so
[1:03:34] we we know that that
[1:03:38] what what happened to us
[1:03:41] when we got this infection
[1:03:45] what what what what what what transpired
[1:03:49] in our lives well what happened was
[1:03:52] is that that there there was
[1:03:56] something uh that was uh
[1:04:01] that was hid
[1:04:06] so this infection is something that is
[1:04:09] real but it's hid
[1:04:13] so that's what happened there was a
[1:04:15] reality this infection
[1:04:18] this faith that infects you
[1:04:22] is real but it was hid
[1:04:27] you didn't you didn't see it but it
[1:04:29] still existed
[1:04:31] you were living your life without it but
[1:04:34] it still
[1:04:34] existed it's real and it's something
[1:04:38] that's
[1:04:38] very real but it's hid
[1:04:41] and then then
[1:04:45] when you got infected
[1:04:48] you got from faith or the revelation of
[1:04:51] god
[1:04:53] is spread from faith to faith so what is
[1:04:56] revelation
[1:04:58] it's something that's previously hid
[1:05:01] and now made known
[1:05:05] so when you think about what it is that
[1:05:07] you're spreading
[1:05:09] you're spreading the vision
[1:05:13] the eyesight the reality
[1:05:16] that takes something that's hid and
[1:05:20] now makes it known that
[1:05:23] that's what faith does faith
[1:05:26] takes that which is real that's hidden
[1:05:30] and now makes it known so it's no longer
[1:05:34] hidden
[1:05:36] and now once that they see
[1:05:41] they can't help it it's what you see
[1:05:46] because you you've got it so we're
[1:05:49] talking about
[1:05:50] our commission we're talking about going
[1:05:53] out and testifying
[1:05:55] we're talking about spreading because we
[1:05:58] know that what we have
[1:06:02] is contagious
[1:06:05] that people can get it they can catch it
[1:06:10] it can affect them the same way it
[1:06:13] affects you
[1:06:14] but if if you if you're not sure you
[1:06:18] have it then you're not sure you'll
[1:06:21] spread it
[1:06:23] but if you know you've got it then you
[1:06:26] know
[1:06:26] you can spread it and you know what
[1:06:29] you're spreading
[1:06:30] you're spreading revelation you're
[1:06:33] spreading eyes out
[1:06:35] you're spreading what you're making what
[1:06:38] was hid
[1:06:39] real that's what faith does it goes out
[1:06:42] and it takes what's hit
[1:06:43] this person doesn't know god's a healer
[1:06:46] but he's a healer to you
[1:06:48] they don't know if they're salva heaven
[1:06:50] but there's a heaven to you
[1:06:52] they don't know because you've got it
[1:06:55] and now you've got it you see it
[1:07:00] it becomes real to you now you got to
[1:07:03] remember
[1:07:04] they don't so you know
[1:07:07] we're not in the business of going
[1:07:10] around
[1:07:11] finding other people who are infected
[1:07:19] because i can infect you if you've got
[1:07:21] it
[1:07:25] this is the only disease
[1:07:29] that has a reward when you get it
[1:07:33] every other day's disease has a
[1:07:36] consequence
[1:07:38] if you get polio there's a consequence
[1:07:40] if you get the flu
[1:07:42] there's a consequence you name every
[1:07:44] disease
[1:07:45] that satan has there's a consequence
[1:07:48] this
[1:07:48] is the only disease that packs a reward
[1:07:52] not only does it pack a reward but it's
[1:07:55] the only disease that packs
[1:07:57] life every other disease packs death
[1:08:02] this disease packs eternal life it gets
[1:08:05] it
[1:08:06] now i want you to look at yourself and
[1:08:08] it realize that you've got
[1:08:11] something because you made contact with
[1:08:14] something that
[1:08:14] infected you and now you're
[1:08:18] infected and because you're
[1:08:22] infected with faith you are now an
[1:08:25] authorized spreader
[1:08:30] not only are you authorized but you're
[1:08:36] commissioned
[1:08:38] could you imagine going to school and
[1:08:41] you know
[1:08:42] that you've got a real you're really
[1:08:44] sick and
[1:08:45] if if anybody comes in contact with you
[1:08:48] they're gonna get
[1:08:49] nauseous and they're gonna faint and
[1:08:51] they're going to fall out and they're
[1:08:53] going to have to go home from school
[1:08:55] and and and the principal came to you
[1:08:58] and said i want you you're commissioned
[1:09:01] to go into this school and make all the
[1:09:04] students sick
[1:09:06] because we want to go on vacation
[1:09:13] well you'd have to get out and mingle
[1:09:18] but the trouble with that sickness is
[1:09:20] you don't feel like you want to mingle
[1:09:24] you just want to go hide but this is the
[1:09:27] only life infection
[1:09:31] that makes you want to mingle makes you
[1:09:34] want to rub
[1:09:35] shoulders makes you want to get out
[1:09:37] there and spread it
[1:09:38] so it's it's something that that is hid
[1:09:42] but now you see it it
[1:09:46] it moved from being hid to a reality to
[1:09:50] you
[1:09:51] it's now in evidence it's just as real
[1:09:55] to you as it could be
[1:09:57] and and let me say your description
[1:10:02] your description of the gospel
[1:10:06] your your description of what it is that
[1:10:09] you possess the joy the peace
[1:10:13] the longsuffering the temperance the
[1:10:16] meekness
[1:10:17] the helping hand that's there to get you
[1:10:20] through
[1:10:21] the thing that delivers you from
[1:10:24] worry okay and the joy that you
[1:10:27] have unspeakable your description of it
[1:10:31] is clear and vivid
[1:10:38] it's something so plain that
[1:10:41] that you can express it so plainly
[1:10:47] it's such a reality to you you're not
[1:10:49] groping for words
[1:10:51] you you know what it is you know when
[1:10:54] you talk about
[1:10:55] joy that that joy is so vivid to you
[1:10:59] it's so real to you that even when
[1:11:02] someone says oh
[1:11:03] you look kind of down in the dumps oh
[1:11:05] i'm sorry but down on the inside let me
[1:11:08] tell you about
[1:11:09] what's on the inside there's a peace
[1:11:11] that sir paths understand
[1:11:13] there's good joy that's deep in there
[1:11:17] everything else is on the outside
[1:11:21] all the troubles of the world are in the
[1:11:24] world
[1:11:24] again i'm in this world but i'm not of
[1:11:27] the world
[1:11:28] i don't have any control over that
[1:11:31] what's going out now but let me tell you
[1:11:33] about what though it's infected my heart
[1:11:36] that's really what's infected my life
[1:11:38] let's
[1:11:39] tell me what's got control over me let
[1:11:41] me tell you about the
[1:11:43] symptoms that are down on the inside and
[1:11:46] those symptoms are so
[1:11:47] real to you and they're so plain to you
[1:11:52] that you can express them in such a way
[1:11:56] that they can be seen just as you see it
[1:11:59] amen and it's real
[1:12:02] yes sir that's when you know you've
[1:12:06] infected somebody
[1:12:09] when they know what you're talking about
[1:12:11] they see it
[1:12:13] it's not a mantle it's absolutely
[1:12:17] something that's real
[1:12:21] it's real it's really contagious
[1:12:24] if you could look at it just like the
[1:12:27] flu
[1:12:30] just like covet 19
[1:12:33] this this infection is john 3 14.
[1:12:37] john 3 16. yes
[1:12:41] it's real it is it's it's a reality
[1:12:45] it's not an intellectual you can never
[1:12:48] never diagnose this or
[1:12:52] try to put it in doctrinal categories
[1:12:55] whether it's god head whether it's this
[1:12:57] whether it's this doctrine
[1:12:59] or or that doctrine it just shows you're
[1:13:02] on the outside
[1:13:03] you might know all about it but you
[1:13:06] don't possess any of the symptoms
[1:13:08] it's like going to a doctor that don't
[1:13:10] got it
[1:13:13] and he says well how do you feel well if
[1:13:16] you've had it you know how i feel
[1:13:19] i feel just the way you felt when you
[1:13:22] had it
[1:13:25] they don't have it you know what they do
[1:13:27] they take some medicine
[1:13:28] to kill it but we don't kill this
[1:13:34] we want it to grow and grow
[1:13:37] and have a greater effect so because
[1:13:39] something so
[1:13:40] real to us that
[1:13:43] it it's it's so genuine
[1:13:48] and so what's another word
[1:13:51] we can use for
[1:13:55] infected how about
[1:13:58] quickened
[1:14:02] right so when you've when you make
[1:14:05] contact
[1:14:07] with someone that's got c19
[1:14:10] what's happened is it's went from them
[1:14:14] and taken its abode in you
[1:14:18] now it's passed from them
[1:14:22] to you now you
[1:14:25] you have the symptoms
[1:14:28] you have the effects do you have
[1:14:31] it because it it it's been passed
[1:14:35] so what you we would say that oh i sat
[1:14:38] down with these people
[1:14:39] and i heard the testaments oh we had a
[1:14:42] party or we had a
[1:14:43] a a reception or we had this and
[1:14:47] somebody came with
[1:14:48] it hallelujah
[1:14:53] wouldn't you just love to have somebody
[1:14:54] come with that inspiring faith
[1:14:58] in the church someone come on fire for
[1:15:02] god
[1:15:03] someone come prayed up someone come read
[1:15:06] up
[1:15:06] because what's going to happen your
[1:15:08] cup's going to overflow
[1:15:11] it's going to get on somebody else
[1:15:13] somebody else that needs it
[1:15:15] somebody else that doesn't see it or
[1:15:18] they're not
[1:15:18] feeling it but it's so real to you
[1:15:21] it's such an expression to you it's so
[1:15:24] vivid for you
[1:15:26] that you make it so clear to them
[1:15:30] that just by your testimony just by the
[1:15:33] words that are coming out of your mouth
[1:15:36] just by what you're expressing you see
[1:15:39] and you feel the faith that you're
[1:15:41] walking in
[1:15:42] you're so you're so caught up in
[1:15:45] heavenly places
[1:15:47] that all of a sudden they see that they
[1:15:49] recognize that they feel it and they say
[1:15:52] wow this guy's got something
[1:16:00] and they inquire what's this hope
[1:16:03] that you have tell me about this
[1:16:07] where did you get it well i got it one
[1:16:11] night in a closet
[1:16:13] i got it down in the altar i got it in a
[1:16:16] church service one day
[1:16:17] the spirit was moving i was with a bunch
[1:16:20] of believers
[1:16:22] someone had talked to me and i sought it
[1:16:24] out
[1:16:25] in my heart and so it
[1:16:28] it becomes so real so let's talk about
[1:16:32] this contagious quickening power
[1:16:36] now why did everybody act the way they
[1:16:40] acted
[1:16:41] with masks on staying six feet
[1:16:45] away you know what i mean
[1:16:48] i i'm sure that when people drove up and
[1:16:50] down the street and they saw the sisters
[1:16:52] hugging one another and their brothers
[1:16:54] hugging one another
[1:16:55] they just were thinking oh no the whole
[1:16:58] world's gonna die
[1:17:00] no the whole world will live
[1:17:04] if they get what we've got
[1:17:07] look look but let's let's watch this
[1:17:09] contagion
[1:17:11] at one of the first things it takes away
[1:17:15] i'm i'm reading out of the message
[1:17:17] called easter seal
[1:17:20] and uh
[1:17:23] and it and this
[1:17:26] is what he's saying in and i'm just
[1:17:28] trying to fix uh
[1:17:31] uh pick up a spot here paragraph 120
[1:17:34] says that look
[1:17:37] god the same when he saw jesus
[1:17:41] it it was the finished work that god
[1:17:44] finished with jesus when he said
[1:17:47] it is finished all the plan was finished
[1:17:53] so when he said it's finished
[1:17:57] in other words he said the
[1:18:00] the it's finished now it can be spread
[1:18:06] it isn't what do they call these things
[1:18:10] it's not adjectives but when they got
[1:18:13] another strain of it
[1:18:17] you know so they they say oh oh there's
[1:18:19] another strain of it there's another
[1:18:21] strain of it
[1:18:22] we might have to come up with the
[1:18:24] vaccine there's a no
[1:18:26] this is finished you get this you got it
[1:18:30] there ain't another strain there's not
[1:18:33] another thing that's going to come up
[1:18:36] there's not that's why when the ministry
[1:18:38] came in this day
[1:18:40] it wasn't a new thing it was a
[1:18:42] restoration
[1:18:44] of what he infected the or quickened
[1:18:48] the church with so i want to use the
[1:18:50] word quickened but i want to try this
[1:18:52] parallel
[1:18:53] because i want you to see yourself
[1:19:00] and then to judge yourself
[1:19:03] line yourself up to the word so you can
[1:19:06] really ask yourself
[1:19:08] have i got the disease
[1:19:11] because this is one disease you want to
[1:19:14] have
[1:19:15] you don't want to be sitting amongst the
[1:19:18] diseased
[1:19:20] spiritually or the quickened
[1:19:25] you want to be quickened so when he saw
[1:19:28] jesus
[1:19:28] he said it's finished
[1:19:32] all the work that i've needed to do was
[1:19:34] done
[1:19:35] it's a hundred percent thing what he has
[1:19:40] and the spirit he has and the life he
[1:19:43] has
[1:19:44] that's the life i'm going to put
[1:19:47] in the church this is the life that will
[1:19:52] resurrect
[1:19:53] this is the only life that'll make a
[1:19:56] difference
[1:19:56] it'll have an effect that'll produce the
[1:19:59] resurrection
[1:20:00] so when he said this is it this is
[1:20:04] finished what did he do he kept the word
[1:20:06] of god right to the end
[1:20:08] he didn't shrink from his responsibility
[1:20:11] he
[1:20:11] came face to face with the fact that he
[1:20:14] was called to die
[1:20:15] he didn't go back from it he didn't run
[1:20:17] from it he didn't come up with nothing
[1:20:19] else
[1:20:20] he went on the cross he took death
[1:20:26] didn't have to could have got an
[1:20:29] army could have got the angels but he
[1:20:31] took it and when god
[1:20:33] saw that love he saw that sacrifice
[1:20:36] he saw those attributes it was
[1:20:38] everything
[1:20:39] that he was it was a spirit of god
[1:20:42] manifested in flesh
[1:20:44] he says this is finished this is what i
[1:20:47] want to quicken the church with
[1:20:49] this is what i want to give them
[1:20:53] this is what i want to pass on
[1:20:58] so go to the upper room and i'll send it
[1:21:01] down
[1:21:05] so you can have it
[1:21:08] the same spirit
[1:21:11] and when the spirit of god come upon you
[1:21:16] and you truly are one of god's
[1:21:18] attributes
[1:21:20] that he spoke of now if you're not
[1:21:24] you'll you'll wonder
[1:21:28] and frustrated and run here
[1:21:32] and there and everything else
[1:21:35] and never come to the knowledge
[1:21:38] of the truth
[1:21:44] sulk if you get it you're anchored
[1:21:49] okay you're not running to and fro
[1:21:50] you're solid
[1:21:53] if you are one of those the old things
[1:21:56] pass away
[1:21:58] right quick see and you become new
[1:22:03] and the plan of salvation is finished
[1:22:07] you're ready to obey every word
[1:22:11] that god ever spoke to you see
[1:22:15] for you to do
[1:22:18] so you're ready there's things he hasn't
[1:22:21] spoke to you yet
[1:22:23] but because you've been quickened
[1:22:27] you've got in you something that's going
[1:22:31] to receive
[1:22:32] every word of god that comes to you and
[1:22:36] tells you what to do
[1:22:40] because the work was finished
[1:22:46] he said
[1:22:50] if i may you're submissive
[1:22:55] to his word the contract
[1:22:59] exactly the abstract to the contract
[1:23:02] the title deed belongs to you
[1:23:06] the debts are all paid it's all struck
[1:23:09] off and as it was at the day
[1:23:14] of pentecost now
[1:23:17] let's notice the quickening
[1:23:21] this quickening spirit on other people
[1:23:25] now i told you i wouldn't speak very
[1:23:27] long
[1:23:28] and i just got 20 minutes to keep my
[1:23:32] word
[1:23:33] if i do that notice to keep in what time
[1:23:37] i said about an hour
[1:23:40] now notice this quickening power
[1:23:44] that only comes now there
[1:23:47] is a lot of mockery of it
[1:23:53] there's a lot of people that really
[1:23:56] think they've got it
[1:24:00] when they haven't a lot of people
[1:24:04] do it because they have got
[1:24:08] some false impression of what they
[1:24:11] seen others christians
[1:24:14] do
[1:24:19] so we want to make sure that we're
[1:24:22] spreading the right thing
[1:24:27] so you want to make sure you've got it
[1:24:30] so you're not spreading something
[1:24:32] that's not now notice the point here
[1:24:36] is that he said a lot of people have
[1:24:39] been
[1:24:40] infected or
[1:24:44] were contagious by something that really
[1:24:47] wasn't
[1:24:48] it because they saw other people
[1:24:52] and the people claimed it was it
[1:24:56] but it wasn't now these are
[1:24:59] this is the time church that we ask
[1:25:01] ourselves these things
[1:25:04] this is the time we make full proof of
[1:25:06] our ministry
[1:25:08] this is the time that we don't hide
[1:25:12] within our fellowship but we get
[1:25:14] personal
[1:25:15] in our heart
[1:25:19] he says satan can imperson any of that
[1:25:23] we know that and as missionaries
[1:25:26] you can see being personated
[1:25:29] shouting dancing speaking in tongues and
[1:25:32] all these things
[1:25:34] you can see it impersonated anywhere
[1:25:38] absolutely almost heathens and people
[1:25:42] who deny there such a thing as jesus
[1:25:44] christ being the son of god
[1:25:46] and they do all those things themselves
[1:25:51] but the real true quickening spirit
[1:25:56] that comes to a believer
[1:25:59] quickens him to god's word
[1:26:02] that's back to eagle food
[1:26:06] again right back to where he lives
[1:26:14] oh i wish i could emphasize that
[1:26:18] it quickened you to eagle food right
[1:26:21] back
[1:26:22] to where you live
[1:26:25] not doctrine not church
[1:26:29] not theology but that spirit
[1:26:33] quickly takes the word of god
[1:26:36] right to where you live
[1:26:40] so he's dealing with you as an
[1:26:42] individual
[1:26:44] not something you join
[1:26:48] you know when i got sick you know and
[1:26:50] leslie got sick she didn't look up at me
[1:26:53] and say
[1:26:53] do you want some of this
[1:26:57] no i'll get it myself thank you
[1:27:03] it's it's real but so what's it going to
[1:27:06] deal with
[1:27:07] so if if you join it
[1:27:10] and you join of thinking or you
[1:27:14] join a fellowship or you join a doctrine
[1:27:18] or some great orator comes in with
[1:27:21] enticing words
[1:27:22] draws you a picture and you say i i i
[1:27:26] will join that
[1:27:27] i will think that way that's an
[1:27:30] impersonation
[1:27:31] but this quickening spirit takes the
[1:27:34] eagle food
[1:27:35] because you're an eagle and it brings
[1:27:39] that food
[1:27:40] to where you're living
[1:27:43] and makes it personal to you
[1:27:48] when i look at you you can have a halo
[1:27:50] and angel wings
[1:27:52] but the spirit is not going to deal with
[1:27:54] that he's going to deal with your heart
[1:27:57] he's going to deal with your mind he's
[1:28:00] going to deal with your fears
[1:28:05] let's just carry this out
[1:28:09] he says the real quickening spirit that
[1:28:13] comes to a believer
[1:28:15] quickens him to god's word that's back
[1:28:17] to eagle food again
[1:28:19] right back to where he lives man shall
[1:28:22] not
[1:28:22] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:28:26] that proceedeth out
[1:28:28] of the mouth of god now let's notice
[1:28:30] this quickening spirit
[1:28:32] as it comes upon other people like it
[1:28:35] did
[1:28:36] on the day of pentecost now let's notice
[1:28:40] pentecost how they acted
[1:28:44] and see if they were quickened
[1:28:47] by this quickening power that we're
[1:28:50] talking about
[1:28:54] right now what are we supposed to be
[1:28:56] restored back to
[1:28:58] to what they were quickened with so now
[1:29:01] our messenger says let's
[1:29:03] look at the quickening power let's look
[1:29:06] at them
[1:29:07] let's judge them let's see what they
[1:29:10] went through
[1:29:11] because now it's a model
[1:29:15] for us
[1:29:21] on the day of pentecost they were all
[1:29:24] waiting up there
[1:29:26] in themselves they were afraid
[1:29:34] remember i talked about that's the first
[1:29:36] thing
[1:29:37] about we're afraid to get it we're
[1:29:40] afraid to get it
[1:29:42] you know there's a lot of people that
[1:29:43] are afraid
[1:29:45] to get the holy ghost
[1:29:49] they want to filter it they just don't
[1:29:52] want to let it
[1:29:53] have its way whatever it does however it
[1:29:57] changes your life
[1:30:03] they were afraid the jews just what they
[1:30:06] were
[1:30:06] going the jews just what they were going
[1:30:10] to do
[1:30:11] so they got scared but what happened
[1:30:15] when this quickening power fell
[1:30:18] from heaven there was a
[1:30:21] bravery set upon them
[1:30:27] there was something and out
[1:30:30] an understanding where they
[1:30:34] wasn't so sure of it a few hours before
[1:30:38] they knowed he had died
[1:30:42] they know that he had died they know
[1:30:45] that he had risen
[1:30:46] they had talked to him on the way
[1:30:50] but what was that thing for them
[1:30:54] or was it just for he says
[1:30:57] but was that thing for them or was it
[1:31:00] just for them
[1:31:02] or or for jesus himself
[1:31:06] now do you understand what he's saying
[1:31:07] they were afraid
[1:31:11] they had talked to him
[1:31:15] they they know he would risen
[1:31:18] but the question was was it for them
[1:31:26] were they going to take possession of it
[1:31:32] that that's the thing the quickening
[1:31:34] power we know about it we know we've
[1:31:36] risen you know these things
[1:31:37] but the question you got down like was
[1:31:39] it for this person
[1:31:41] was it for that person or was that just
[1:31:43] for
[1:31:44] jesus himself
[1:31:47] so he rose up from the dead
[1:31:52] and what he was going to impart to them
[1:31:55] and quicken to them is not an anointing
[1:32:00] like pentecost teaches the baptism of
[1:32:03] the holy spirit
[1:32:04] what he was giving them was resurrection
[1:32:08] and life
[1:32:11] he was going to infect them with the
[1:32:15] same spirit or
[1:32:16] quicken in them the same spirit that
[1:32:19] rose him from the dead
[1:32:21] so it wasn't a matter whether it was
[1:32:23] true or whether it was for them or
[1:32:26] whether it was for them
[1:32:27] or was it just for jesus as yourself but
[1:32:30] when they got quickened then they knew
[1:32:33] that resurrection
[1:32:34] was for them personally
[1:32:39] now they had it
[1:32:42] now they had something
[1:32:46] that they could spread
[1:32:50] otherwise they were just telling history
[1:32:53] stories
[1:32:55] but now they possessed the quickening
[1:32:59] what like we referred to as the disease
[1:33:03] they possessed it they had got it
[1:33:07] they knew they they they they had
[1:33:09] received it
[1:33:11] they he says but here on the day of
[1:33:14] pentecost the holy spirit
[1:33:16] the abstract fell on the believer that
[1:33:19] made them part of his resurrection
[1:33:24] make him part of his
[1:33:28] make him part of his fellowship
[1:33:31] the holy spirit came and confirmed
[1:33:35] to them that they
[1:33:38] would be raised up because they
[1:33:42] were potentially raised then from
[1:33:45] cowards
[1:33:46] to brave men
[1:33:51] okay that's what keeps you where you're
[1:33:54] not afraid of the world
[1:33:55] that's right
[1:34:00] oh it's just so beautiful even the duke
[1:34:03] had to admit it nicodemus said rabbi
[1:34:06] we know that you're a teacher come from
[1:34:08] god
[1:34:09] no man could do these things you do
[1:34:13] except god be with him now we know that
[1:34:17] we recognize that so the disciples peter
[1:34:21] have even sworn in his presence
[1:34:24] all of them had forsaken him at the
[1:34:27] crucifixion
[1:34:28] but here they are now
[1:34:32] up in this upper room in the presence of
[1:34:35] god
[1:34:36] and all of a sudden here comes his holy
[1:34:40] spirit down
[1:34:41] from heaven and it quickened
[1:34:45] them what's the other word we've been
[1:34:48] saying
[1:34:48] it infected them
[1:34:52] it gave them a new symptom
[1:34:56] and what was the symptoms they were now
[1:34:59] brave
[1:35:06] and it quick and quickening took place
[1:35:10] he says in heaven and it quickened them
[1:35:13] and the quickening took place they
[1:35:16] wasn't afraid to make a witness
[1:35:20] of the message that they believed
[1:35:23] and knowed to be the truth
[1:35:26] otherwise they were afraid
[1:35:29] of it
[1:35:33] why you know that's one of the things
[1:35:36] that we've got to
[1:35:38] overcome is fear
[1:35:43] that's what's keeping us
[1:35:46] from testifying the way we should that's
[1:35:49] what's keeping us from sharing
[1:35:51] the promise because we haven't
[1:35:55] settled in that it's for us
[1:35:58] and we've come up with all kinds of
[1:36:00] things that
[1:36:02] that fear is what produced the
[1:36:05] nickelodeon spirit
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:09] let somebody else do it and we're going
[1:36:13] to close here
[1:36:17] he said and
[1:36:20] of the message that they know to be the
[1:36:22] truth otherwise
[1:36:24] they were afraid of it how many
[1:36:26] presbyterians
[1:36:27] how many methodists how many baptists in
[1:36:30] the world today
[1:36:32] how many pentecostal that knows
[1:36:36] the truth and are afraid to make a stand
[1:36:39] on it
[1:36:43] i'm persuaded to wonder
[1:36:47] what was that fell on you
[1:36:50] are you a part of his resurrection
[1:36:54] would you dare scream off for some man's
[1:36:57] theory
[1:36:58] and idea
[1:37:02] or have you got the real boldness and
[1:37:06] the real
[1:37:07] manhood it takes to stand out
[1:37:11] and call right right and wrong wrong
[1:37:15] are you a part of his resurrection
[1:37:19] or are you a worshiper of a bunch of
[1:37:22] creeds
[1:37:24] are you a goer to church
[1:37:27] do you have your name on there
[1:37:30] and dead in sin and trespasses
[1:37:34] he that believes not the full word of
[1:37:37] god
[1:37:38] is a sinner those pharisees believed in
[1:37:41] many things
[1:37:43] to be the truth they said we are god's
[1:37:46] children
[1:37:48] and they were until that word was
[1:37:51] preached
[1:37:53] but when that word was preached and
[1:37:55] vindicated
[1:37:56] then they became sinners for rejecting
[1:38:00] the thing that they knowed was right
[1:38:05] and witnessed that we know that that
[1:38:08] other teacher
[1:38:09] come from god for no man could do the
[1:38:12] things that you do
[1:38:13] without god being with him i wonder
[1:38:16] today
[1:38:18] where we're at
[1:38:23] i ask you where is this resurrection
[1:38:27] finding us are you
[1:38:30] dare to step out
[1:38:33] are you dare to take god at his word
[1:38:37] if you're ordained to life you sure will
[1:38:40] do it if you're an eagle you
[1:38:44] can't help doing it there's something
[1:38:48] in you or do you want to serve a creed
[1:38:52] somewhere
[1:38:52] and say i go to church
[1:38:55] i'm just as good as you are see
[1:38:59] if you hold no birthrights
[1:39:02] you'll never see it you can't see it
[1:39:05] but if you hold the possession of that
[1:39:08] birthright
[1:39:09] you can help seeing it because
[1:39:12] it's a part of you and you're a part of
[1:39:16] it
[1:39:19] you understand it's not something that
[1:39:21] you can get intellectually
[1:39:24] you are living your life until he found
[1:39:27] you
[1:39:29] and when he found you
[1:39:32] the word of god came to you
[1:39:35] and faith came to you and it was passed
[1:39:39] from
[1:39:39] faith to faith
[1:39:43] and that faith came by the word of god
[1:39:47] and when that faith came that was the
[1:39:50] quickening power
[1:39:52] that let you know that you
[1:39:55] had in you the same life
[1:39:58] that resurrected him and therefore
[1:40:01] you're
[1:40:01] already resurrected
[1:40:04] so what are we afraid of
[1:40:09] amen let me tell you let me close with
[1:40:11] this
[1:40:12] faith is contagious
[1:40:17] you can quicken somebody
[1:40:20] else by the words of your testimony
[1:40:25] you tape david we listen to the
[1:40:28] story of david and how he killed goliath
[1:40:31] well we can just visualize that we hear
[1:40:35] the story
[1:40:36] and our faith swells up in us
[1:40:39] because that faith is contagious
[1:40:42] get in we hear that story and we
[1:40:45] visualize it
[1:40:46] and it's real to us in that faith just
[1:40:49] swells up in us
[1:40:50] the story of moses all the bible stories
[1:40:53] it inspires us
[1:40:55] and that faith well up in it
[1:40:58] now take what you've been
[1:41:01] your experience of being quickened
[1:41:05] and brought to life not to knowledge to
[1:41:08] life
[1:41:09] not not not saved in the sense
[1:41:14] of being separated from sin but saved in
[1:41:17] the fact that you've been saved from the
[1:41:19] second death
[1:41:22] that you have eternal life because
[1:41:26] eternal life is a gift of god
[1:41:28] lest any man should boast that's what
[1:41:30] you've been quickened with that's what
[1:41:32] the spirit i
[1:41:33] am the truth the life the resurrection
[1:41:36] i am the way the truth the life he told
[1:41:38] martha i

[1:41:57] i hope you're so full of quickening
[1:41:59] power
[1:42:00] that it gets on other people
[1:42:03] i hope you got the boldness
[1:42:07] and the bravery not to be a coward
[1:42:12] to stand up and
[1:42:15] that's our testimony that he lives
[1:42:19] and because he lives we live
[1:42:22] also amen so i didn't know
[1:42:26] i i just thought that i would tell you
[1:42:28] everybody's

[1:42:35] faith
[1:42:37] and it's contagious and we're going to

[1:43:11] that
[1:43:13] and you don't have that blessed
[1:43:15] assurance you're not just
[1:43:17] sure and the only way that you can
[1:43:22] be infected is to come in contact with
[1:43:25] it
[1:43:27] and you'd like to say lord i want to be
[1:43:29] quickened
[1:43:31] i want your spirit to come by
[1:43:35] my way and i want you to give me
[1:43:40] this resurrection life
[1:43:45] that you gave to the saints
[1:43:49] on that great pentecostal day
[1:43:52] when your spirit came down
[1:43:56] and lord they were cowards hiding
[1:44:01] but after they received that life and
[1:44:03] became a part of that resurrection
[1:44:07] they infected three thousand souls that
[1:44:09] day
[1:44:12] but i may not have the opportunity to
[1:44:15] come
[1:44:16] in contact with three thousand souls
[1:44:21] the lord my heart's desire is that i
[1:44:23] receive it
[1:44:26] and then i pass it along to someone that
[1:44:28] i love
[1:44:30] someone that i care for
[1:44:33] or may it be such a presence
[1:44:37] on me such a reality to me that the
[1:44:40] words of it are so
[1:44:41] vivid that they can see it
[1:44:44] and know that it's real father may i
[1:44:48] infect my children
