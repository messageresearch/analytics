[35:23] as we see the pastor always leading
[35:26] every day to the word
[35:29] for either let it be anchored in our
[35:31] hearts
[35:33] as we commit ourselves to you
[35:35] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[35:42] as you're still standing
[35:48] ah let's take our Bibles the
[35:52] relief the look in a Book of Luke
[35:56] said
[35:59] chapter 7
[36:01] 17.
[36:05] it was a long form of diversity
[36:08] eventually we'll start from verse 28
[36:10] about the University of entries we'll
[36:12] start from the 28th verse
[36:16] and then we'll go all the way to Luke
[36:18] 18.
[36:22] uh liability but the Bible says
[36:26] I'm glad to even treat uh
[36:31] defeat versus okay likewise starting
[36:35] from Luke 17 and 28 it says likewise
[36:38] also as it was in the days of Lord they
[36:42] did eat they drank they bought they sold
[36:45] they planted they built but the same day
[36:47] that lot went into went out of Sodom it
[36:51] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[36:53] and destroyed them all even that shall
[36:55] it be in the day when the son of man is
[36:59] revealed it says in that day he uh he
[37:04] which was upon the house top and his
[37:07] staff in the house let him not come down
[37:10] to take it away and he that is in the
[37:13] field let him let him likewise not
[37:16] return back remember Lord's wife
[37:18] whosoever shall seek to save his life
[37:22] shall lose it and whosoever shall lose
[37:24] his life shall preserve it I tell you in
[37:29] that night there shall be two two men in
[37:33] one bed and one shall be taken and
[37:34] another shall be left two women shall be
[37:38] grinding together the one shall be taken
[37:41] and the other left two men shall be in
[37:43] the field one shall be taken and the
[37:45] other left and they answered and said
[37:48] unto him where Lord and where it says
[37:52] where Lord and he said unto them
[37:54] whatsoever whatsoever the body theater
[37:58] will be the ego be gathered together and
[38:02] then we'll read 1850 seven and eight and
[38:07] shall not shall not God avenge his elect
[38:10] which cry day and night unto him though
[38:13] he belong with them I tell you that he
[38:17] will avenge them speedily nevertheless
[38:20] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[38:23] faith on the Earth
[38:27] Lord bless again your word to us
[38:30] may you open it up for us Lord
[38:34] we know that the letter killeth
[38:37] but it's a spirit that giveth life
[38:40] may you let the spirit of your word
[38:44] let it come and and bring us to life
[38:46] Quicken Us
[38:48] in the few words that we're going to
[38:50] read in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[38:54] amen you may have your seats
[38:59] I believe we're all happy to be gathered
[39:01] in the house of God tonight
[39:07] from the scripture we just read they
[39:10] said
[39:12] the Lord I placed on my heart to speak
[39:15] on a little subject
[39:16] [Music]
[39:18] which is the last part of the eighth
[39:21] verse that we read of Luke 18 God
[39:25] refused to love you when the son of man
[39:27] will come
[39:29] shall he find faith on Earth
[39:35] we know when we want to talk about faith
[39:40] there's a lot of things to say
[39:44] um
[39:46] because faith is the very foundation for
[39:49] the Christian walk
[39:51] [Music]
[39:53] the Bible says without faith we cannot
[39:56] please God foreign
[40:33] talking about faith we could talk about
[40:36] faith for months and months and in many
[40:38] different ways
[40:41] and it's by faith that we are gathered
[40:43] here tonight
[40:47] it's by faith that we all know that we
[40:50] are Sons and Daughters of God
[40:54] it's by faith that we believe that God
[40:57] loves us
[41:00] that God is able to give us everything
[41:03] that we ask of him amen
[41:06] and sometimes even above what we can ask
[41:12] you because he told us to seek first the
[41:16] kingdom of God and its righteousness
[41:19] and all the others will be given unto
[41:23] you remember
[41:25] and he didn't say that as seek first the
[41:28] kingdom of God then ask other things
[41:32] which means whether we ask or not
[41:36] if we have seeked the kingdom of God
[41:39] Phil
[41:45] every time that God finds that we have a
[41:48] need he will give it to us
[41:53] I was really blessed lately foreign
[42:10] for me I had a desire to be sitting back
[42:13] there and continue to listen
[42:18] I felt fit for me to be up here tonight
[42:24] when the son of man comes
[42:28] shall we find faith on Earth
[42:34] when we talk about the son of man the
[42:37] Republic
[42:40] tells us that when Jesus came with three
[42:43] sons names
[42:48] and Son of David
[42:59] he presented himself so many times as
[43:02] the son of man
[43:04] because the son of man for Jesus
[43:07] says it's a prophet
[43:10] as they killed because he himself calls
[43:13] uh Ezekiel son of man
[43:17] so when Jesus came on Earth
[43:21] he was the son of man
[43:31] because Jesus was the the fullness of
[43:34] the godhead
[43:36] yeah
[43:38] and when brother talks about the signs
[43:41] of the son of man
[43:44] he starts from the time of Abraham
[43:48] he says it was when God himself created
[43:52] a body
[43:54] he got into that body
[43:57] he created two other bodies she took two
[44:01] angels with him
[44:03] they went to visit Abraham
[44:06] it's a sense that the country providers
[44:10] and the sign was when he had his back
[44:13] turned towards the tent where Sarah was
[44:15] is
[44:18] and to know what was happening with
[44:20] Sarah when when she was in the tent
[44:24] a gentleman and God himself continues
[44:28] when he came in the body of Jesus
[44:34] we know that Jesus was the fullness of
[44:36] the godhead
[44:44] he poured into Christ
[44:47] it could kiss it and everything that
[44:50] Christ was
[44:52] he poured into his church
[44:55] into his bride
[44:58] okay
[44:59] and when Jesus came on Earth
[45:05] he himself manifested the sign of the
[45:09] son of man
[45:11] because he was when he's when he was in
[45:14] front of Nathaniel
[45:17] to say that behold an Israelite in whom
[45:20] there is no guile
[45:22] he could have seen Simon
[45:26] and he said Simon son of Jonah
[45:32] when he was in front of the Samaritan
[45:34] woman
[45:37] he could look at her and say how many
[45:40] husbands she had
[45:42] a a Jew for this line every time
[45:46] that God did this
[45:47] the objective
[45:51] the the goal the motive was to raise up
[45:55] the faith
[45:58] to those that were in front of him
[46:08] that you will certainly have a son
[46:11] with your wife Sarah
[46:14] above Nevada
[46:20] in his own heart they said yes
[46:24] [Music]
[46:26] who's this who's coming to bother me
[46:38] you have a son
[46:45] is there anything impossible to God
[46:50] is there anything that's impossible to
[46:53] God
[46:56] and to assure Abraham
[47:02] he said why your wife Sarah who's behind
[47:06] me why did she laugh
[47:13] Abraham understood that the one who was
[47:15] standing in front of him
[47:17] was more than a man
[47:38] that the promise will come to pass
[47:43] it because the one who was in front of
[47:46] him
[47:48] was able to discern his thinking
[47:53] the same God who did it with Abraham
[47:58] he did it with the Jews
[48:02] because we see he did it with Nathaniel
[48:06] he did it with Simon son of Jonah
[48:10] he did with a woman at the well
[48:14] and we know the story of the Samaritan
[48:17] woman the woman
[48:22] this woman who couldn't stay with others
[48:26] because she was a woman who didn't have
[48:29] a right a good life
[48:34] and certainly she was always waiting for
[48:37] everybody to go before she can go to the
[48:39] Wells
[48:48] who was able to tell her everything that
[48:51] happened in her life
[48:54] he said I see you are a prophet it
[48:58] is
[49:00] and we know the Messiah will come and
[49:04] when the Messiah will come
[49:06] he will do the same thing
[49:09] Jesus said I am
[49:14] just the contact of this woman with
[49:17] Jesus
[49:18] from procedure he changed this
[49:21] prostitute woman
[49:26] an evangelist woman
[49:30] because she went back into the city
[49:36] she couldn't say that I'm a prostitute I
[49:39] can't say whatever
[49:41] um
[49:43] she forgot that she was a prostitute
[49:46] that she had no right to testify of God
[49:49] to anybody
[49:52] but she was in contact with something
[49:56] that was able to transform her life is
[49:59] that Transformers that transformation of
[50:02] her life
[50:04] she made her a witness
[50:07] she went back into the city
[50:11] the Bible says that many came to Jesus
[50:15] according to them
[50:17] because of a testimony of a prostitute
[50:22] when you know you and I the
[50:25] that for Jesus and the dead people she
[50:28] was no longer a prostitute for Jesus
[50:33] supposed to she was never a prostitute
[50:36] because the Bible says two circular
[50:39] place that all that he has called
[50:42] he has Justified
[50:44] he said it means it forgiveness
[50:48] he has forgotten the past
[50:55] because she came in contact with the son
[50:58] of man
[51:13] to do the same thing with the Gentiles
[51:17] with the Nations that we are
[51:22] and he promised at the end time
[51:29] he said what happened in the time of
[51:31] Lord
[51:34] [Music]
[51:36] will be likewise in the son of man
[51:39] revealing in a revealing of the son of
[51:41] man
[51:44] and we see today when we look at the
[51:47] world and the way it is
[51:50] if you look at it in the corner to look
[51:54] just on the Lord
[51:58] the whole context of War at the time of
[52:01] lot was is in front of us
[52:07] we see all the sin that existed in the
[52:10] time of Noah
[52:12] where the Bible says you the son of man
[52:18] they saw that the daughters of men were
[52:21] attractive
[52:23] and they took them as wives
[52:30] today women are exposed as merchandise a
[52:35] former Express University and they they
[52:40] expressly dress in a manner that's that
[52:42] that that that that's just exposed them
[52:46] and all of that to push yourself is
[52:50] to cause the son of mans to fall
[52:53] the son of Gods to fall
[52:56] what happened in the time of Lord
[53:04] we see that man went into homosexuality
[53:08] it's what we see today
[53:16] we're trying even to impose other
[53:19] nations to accept those things
[53:24] it becomes almost like a world a world
[53:27] uh a world order
[53:33] it seems like it's something normal that
[53:36] has to be legalized
[53:54] when Obama went into African countries
[53:57] and it was uh championing the homosexual
[54:00] things continues when he was president
[54:04] that President told them
[54:07] if you like me to bring those things up
[54:11] you will first have to accept that you
[54:14] become my wife
[54:17] and he took two homosexuals and he put
[54:21] them in jail
[54:24] I said I'll get you out the day that you
[54:27] will produce a son for me
[54:29] because for God
[54:32] loves the man gets married to a woman
[54:36] because they have to produce something
[54:40] but today so contests
[54:43] [Music]
[54:48] but what happened in the time of lot is
[54:51] what we see
[54:52] it means
[54:56] if in the natural you see those things
[55:00] come to pass or turned a lot in the time
[55:03] of life
[55:06] it was the time where God was revealing
[55:09] himself to Abraham
[55:11] so there was a people who was set aside
[55:15] here the Predator they were
[55:17] predestinated
[55:20] to receive God himself
[55:23] it was the group of Abrahams
[55:27] that's why when God is extended his
[55:30] grace to you
[55:31] to hear the message
[55:34] God loves you
[55:36] regardless of your weaknesses
[55:40] regardless of what what challenges you
[55:43] have persevere
[55:49] the Bible says is rich in Mercy
[55:54] if God tells us humans
[55:57] donations we have to we have to forgive
[56:01] 70 times 70.
[56:03] don't remember how much more himself
[56:09] we have no reason
[56:11] to leave this message
[56:13] to go away from this message
[56:17] regardless of what's happening to us
[56:24] because that was the the question or the
[56:27] the inquiry of Jesus
[56:30] Jesus looked at our time
[56:33] he says the son of man will come
[56:36] but when he will come
[56:39] shall he find faith on Earth
[56:45] well people believe his message
[56:50] well people hang on to his message
[56:54] amen
[56:57] because we know
[57:00] that the purpose of this message there's
[57:03] only one purpose
[57:05] is to get us ready
[57:08] to go meet to go meet our Lord
[57:11] to go in the rapture
[57:15] to go to meet the Lord
[57:20] that's why when we want to talk about
[57:22] faith does the contests
[57:26] in the context of faith in conjunction
[57:30] with the son of man
[57:35] it goes above the faith that we have
[57:38] that we have for the need of healing
[57:42] because Faith the faith to have the
[57:45] Divine Healing
[57:57] someone who's impure who's not pure can
[58:00] receive a faithful healing
[58:06] and God did it with the Jews
[58:09] he did it with the Samaritans
[58:13] he promised to do it with us also
[58:18] and we know that God brought it to pass
[58:22] in the ministry of William Branham
[58:32] and say what was happening with someone
[58:35] made a difference but the difference
[58:38] is in the time of Abraham
[58:43] God created a body he got into it but in
[58:49] the time in the time of Jesus
[58:52] God created a body in the womb of Mary
[58:56] and he used that body
[58:59] that was his own body but in our time
[59:04] God took one of us
[59:19] so he can Manifest this ministry of the
[59:23] son of man
[59:26] if the first body would ever happen it
[59:30] was Elohim himself
[59:32] if the second body with Jesus said that
[59:36] remember God himself in the human body
[59:40] but in our time Leisure system
[59:44] some looked at it differently
[59:49] the others went and trying to figure it
[59:52] out
[59:53] to say that William Branham also said
[59:57] you is God
[1:00:00] says
[1:00:02] they asked a question about around them
[1:00:06] uh in question and answer number two uh
[1:00:11] it's preached on uh August 23rd 1964.
[1:00:17] uh paragraph 291.
[1:00:21] the question is
[1:00:36] paragraph 291
[1:00:39] two zero one two two zero one yeah
[1:00:45] now
[1:00:47] well that's a good question
[1:00:50] very good
[1:00:56] I'm not the son of man
[1:00:59] um
[1:01:03] that's quite a difference
[1:01:08] Jesus Christ was as was the son of man
[1:01:11] the future the Son of God the son of man
[1:01:16] the son of David Allo
[1:01:24] I don't want to be I don't want to call
[1:01:27] myself anything but your brother
[1:01:30] I am your brother a consideration
[1:01:35] and you just regard me as brother
[1:01:39] billfully or whatever you want to do
[1:01:41] exactly or not that's that's fine the
[1:01:44] trivia that's Dandy
[1:01:47] what you believe keep it to yourself you
[1:01:50] see
[1:01:53] paragraph 105.
[1:02:11] was I the son of man
[1:02:13] is
[1:02:17] and here it is I believe that the son of
[1:02:20] man was or was the pillar of fire the
[1:02:22] son of man no no foreign
[1:03:23] could not bear sin
[1:03:26] is
[1:03:30] not this is
[1:03:38] Anointed ones at the end times
[1:03:41] it says I am not a son of man it is
[1:03:45] I am just a person who's standing there
[1:03:50] when the son of man is manifesting
[1:03:52] himself
[1:04:03] to manifest the sign of the son of man
[1:04:08] am says in the super sign it is
[1:04:18] paragraph 177.
[1:04:25] I've come among you as your brother
[1:05:24] that's all I ask you to do
[1:05:30] then in this time
[1:05:33] [Music]
[1:05:34] God sent the prophet
[1:05:36] to manifested
[1:05:39] to manifest the sign of the son of man
[1:05:43] and we know this message
[1:05:47] is to get us ready for the rapture
[1:05:51] Abraham when we go back to Abraham
[1:06:05] when he manifested the sign the sign of
[1:06:09] the son of man to Abraham
[1:06:13] transformation
[1:06:15] the Bible says he changed Abraham and
[1:06:19] Sarah
[1:06:23] Sarah who was an older woman
[1:06:29] she was made a beautiful young girl
[1:06:34] capable of seducing a king
[1:06:38] so she could be taken as a wife
[1:06:41] but quality definition because she
[1:06:44] became young again
[1:06:47] God changed her
[1:06:53] God changed Sarah
[1:07:03] trumpet in the Feast of trumpets
[1:07:28] the last sign that Abraham ever sinned
[1:07:32] before the promised sign before the
[1:07:34] promise uh sign came
[1:07:38] what was it
[1:07:40] formed the network God in the form of a
[1:07:43] human being
[1:07:46] that could discern the thoughts of a man
[1:07:49] of a people in the answer of one man not
[1:07:53] a dozen hustle of one man
[1:07:57] no matter how many impersonations
[1:08:01] they had one is
[1:08:05] and he discerned the thoughts that was
[1:08:08] in there
[1:08:10] now it says what and then next thing
[1:08:13] happened
[1:08:16] Abraham and Sarah
[1:08:21] turned back to a young young man and
[1:08:24] woman it is
[1:08:27] paragraph 296. observation watch
[1:08:32] Sarah was an old woman Villa people the
[1:08:36] Bible says
[1:08:37] her womb was
[1:08:46] Abraham's life was dead in him his seed
[1:08:49] is that right
[1:08:50] now remember Abraham Abraham
[1:08:54] his seed was dead
[1:08:58] 40 years later Eli is 35th he had seven
[1:09:04] sons by another woman
[1:09:06] what did he do
[1:09:09] he changed the bodies
[1:09:13] notice what happened
[1:09:16] immediately
[1:09:20] she turned back to a lovely young woman
[1:09:30] showing in there portraying what he was
[1:09:33] going to do with to the Royal Seed of
[1:09:36] Abraham
[1:09:40] to receive the son that's been promised
[1:09:44] she turned back to a young
[1:09:48] look they went down
[1:10:01] she's fair and beautiful
[1:10:04] it is
[1:10:06] going to marry her is that right
[1:10:11] the old grandma is
[1:10:15] and and then all other pretty girls down
[1:10:20] there Mimi
[1:10:46] [Music]
[1:11:20] what happened the trumpet of God shall
[1:11:23] sound for it shall shall sound
[1:11:27] the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:11:31] a new body
[1:11:34] and which we which are alive
[1:11:44] remain shall be changed in a moment in a
[1:11:47] twinkling of an eye hallelujah
[1:11:48] hallelujah
[1:11:53] and shall be caught up together to meet
[1:11:56] the Lord in the air the second is
[1:12:00] the secret has been made known the seals
[1:12:04] are open
[1:12:08] God had to manifest the son of man in
[1:12:11] our time but that's the god of prophet
[1:12:14] because these bodies cannot go in the
[1:12:17] Rapture
[1:12:18] so for us to go in the Rapture
[1:12:23] God has to do like he did with Abraham
[1:12:26] in the time of Abraham that he may
[1:12:29] change this bodies
[1:12:32] with the Dead
[1:12:46] if we don't believe this message
[1:12:51] if we don't believe what the son of man
[1:12:54] has brought in this time
[1:12:58] we will never receive the change of body
[1:13:04] faith on Earth
[1:13:09] so we have to believe the message
[1:13:13] we have to abide in the word
[1:13:17] we have to accept the word
[1:13:25] that it's the spoken word
[1:13:28] to choose that was in the beginning that
[1:13:31] that spoke the word everything in
[1:13:32] existence
[1:13:34] it's the same spoken word
[1:13:38] that has the ability to change our
[1:13:41] bodies
[1:13:42] body
[1:13:58] new day
[1:14:01] so we have to have a a faith that's
[1:14:04] needful is
[1:14:08] that's why I was saying it doesn't stop
[1:14:11] till the faithful healing alone
[1:14:20] natural natural life
[1:14:24] but our faith has to be raised up Jesus
[1:14:30] until we get the rapturing faith
[1:14:36] the faith that will do so that our body
[1:14:39] can be changed
[1:14:43] in a question and answer on the Holy
[1:14:46] Ghost
[1:14:47] Jesus said
[1:14:49] to this mountain
[1:14:54] and you've heard talk about the things
[1:14:56] that have taken place
[1:15:00] that's the ministry that we are entering
[1:15:03] into news
[1:15:06] we are way up the road now
[1:15:10] soon coming of the Lord the Lord Jesus
[1:15:16] and we've got to have rapturing faith
[1:15:23] in the church that could be changed in
[1:15:26] any moment
[1:15:27] in a twinkling of an eye
[1:15:31] to go out
[1:15:35] or will not go
[1:15:38] Vietnam
[1:15:40] when a son of man will come
[1:15:42] shall he find faith on Earth
[1:15:45] if we don't have this Faith we're not
[1:15:49] going to go
[1:15:51] he says but don't worry
[1:15:58] he'll be there
[1:16:00] he'll be there
[1:16:04] and when the power of this church Rises
[1:16:09] it will bring its Brothers
[1:16:13] the power of this church Rises
[1:16:17] will bring its Brothers
[1:16:23] the power of this church will bring the
[1:16:26] other brethrens
[1:16:29] then there will be a general
[1:16:31] resurrection
[1:16:34] and we are looking forward to it to do
[1:16:38] it
[1:16:39] we are looking forward to it
[1:16:43] we have to
[1:16:48] receive the word
[1:16:53] it means the same God in the beginning
[1:16:56] who spoke the words
[1:17:05] who manifested his attributes
[1:17:08] he's able
[1:17:12] if we come back to his word
[1:17:33] we don't need other things the word of
[1:17:37] God
[1:17:39] just the word of God
[1:17:43] and this word will interpret itself
[1:17:59] the
[1:18:01] interpretation was there was light
[1:18:04] and if God said okay
[1:18:09] that in the evening time there will be
[1:18:11] the manifestation of the son of man okay
[1:18:14] sister Minister and it's this ministry
[1:18:17] that will get you ready the bride for
[1:18:20] the Rapture
[1:18:22] and it's this ministry
[1:18:26] that will bring us to the necessary
[1:18:28] phrase
[1:18:30] for the transformation of our bodies
[1:18:35] don't worry about it just believe that
[1:18:39] the word the message
[1:18:42] whatever else God himself will take care
[1:18:45] of yourself
[1:18:46] whatever remaining is that's God's
[1:18:49] problems it's not you a nice problem
[1:18:53] it's not your problem my sister
[1:18:55] whatever God is and when God is asking
[1:18:58] you is to believe
[1:19:01] is to believe
[1:19:03] how is he going to do it I don't know
[1:19:06] but he told me
[1:19:09] if I believe the messages
[1:19:17] that he will give me this Faith
[1:19:20] he will give me the opportunity
[1:19:24] to have my body changed so that I can go
[1:19:29] in a Rapture to meet him
[1:19:34] because he promised
[1:19:41] he gave him a Minister's complain a
[1:19:45] complete Ministry
[1:19:49] to to bring us all that was necessary to
[1:19:53] have worked do you have this rapturing
[1:19:56] Faith
[1:19:58] that's why as Brother David was saying
[1:20:01] the last time
[1:20:03] listen to the message
[1:20:05] listen to the tapes
[1:20:08] read the the the message
[1:20:13] come to church you hear what the pastor
[1:20:15] is preaching
[1:20:18] God is raising up your faith the Bible
[1:20:22] says
[1:20:23] the faith comes from the hearing it is
[1:20:26] and what we hear from the word of God
[1:20:32] don't don't go away from this presence
[1:20:42] there's not a strong part in the weak
[1:20:45] part
[1:20:48] everything that God gave us through the
[1:20:51] ministry of William Branham and this is
[1:20:55] important for the Perfection of our body
[1:20:58] do everything
[1:21:11] oh you know everything you preached
[1:21:13] before 63.
[1:21:15] before that was the seals that was
[1:21:18] really not the message
[1:21:20] from when brother Branham started
[1:21:22] preaching July played the piece of the
[1:21:24] songs God called them since his birth
[1:21:27] there was the pillar of fire you know
[1:21:30] he told us the pillow fire logos it was
[1:21:33] the logos and it's the anointing
[1:21:37] from his birth says that pillow fire was
[1:21:40] there
[1:21:42] everything is said from the beginning
[1:21:46] with the revealing of the seals
[1:21:50] it's to give us the faith
[1:21:54] says
[1:21:56] I sure is this the the is this the sign
[1:22:00] of the end
[1:22:01] foreign
[1:22:04] 417.
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:11] it says I don't know
[1:22:13] I don't know
[1:22:17] I'm only honest with you
[1:22:19] as my as my brothers
[1:22:22] I don't know is this is this the time
[1:22:26] limited
[1:22:28] the Mysteries are all finished
[1:22:33] has the sounding as a sounding all over
[1:22:42] is that really them seven Thunders
[1:22:45] fixing fixing to utter out something
[1:22:53] that the little group that is gathered
[1:22:56] together will receive a rapturing faith
[1:22:59] affected
[1:23:01] to go in the Rapture when he comes
[1:23:05] for will be changed
[1:23:10] as quick as those angels came
[1:23:14] in a moment in a twinkling of an eyes
[1:23:20] and shall be caught up together with
[1:23:23] those that are that had slept
[1:23:27] but I sleep to come to meet the Lord in
[1:23:31] the air
[1:23:32] he said he says again in the first seal
[1:23:35] paragraph
[1:23:37] 75 is
[1:23:43] coming fourth seven seven mystery
[1:23:47] standards
[1:23:48] that's not even written at all that's
[1:23:52] right is your Quack
[1:23:54] and I believe that through those those
[1:23:57] seven Thunders
[1:24:02] will be revealed in the last days in the
[1:24:06] order in order to get the bride together
[1:24:10] for rapturing faith on effect because
[1:24:17] what we've got right now
[1:24:21] wouldn't be able to do it
[1:24:24] says something new
[1:24:27] we've got to step further said
[1:24:34] we can't have enough faith for Divine
[1:24:37] Healing
[1:24:43] Divine Healing hardly we got to have
[1:24:46] enough Faith to be changed
[1:24:50] and in a moment and in the twink in the
[1:24:53] in a sweeped out of the earth
[1:24:57] and we'll find that we'll we'll find out
[1:25:00] after a while the Lord willing find out
[1:25:03] where it's written
[1:25:05] so when Jesus was talking about it
[1:25:09] when the son of man will come
[1:25:12] will they find faith on Earth
[1:25:15] says
[1:25:18] that the Lord that the Lord Jesus will
[1:25:21] come three times
[1:25:24] the first time he came to save us
[1:25:27] to die as a savior foreign
[1:25:37] and foreign
[1:25:49] so they can Reign on Earth they don't
[1:25:51] like Jesus
[1:25:53] and then Jesus was here uh questioning
[1:25:56] or asking questions about the second
[1:25:58] coming but if they were very important
[1:26:01] because he was coming to take away a
[1:26:04] bride
[1:26:07] and he's saying before I can come to
[1:26:10] take away the bride
[1:26:12] that he will send forth a son of man
[1:26:16] Ministry
[1:26:17] so they could get the bride ready
[1:26:21] but when the son of man will come
[1:26:24] will he find faith on Earth foreign
[1:26:33] faith
[1:26:45] we've seen it before it's not our our
[1:26:49] efforts
[1:26:51] God told us is to believe you're told to
[1:26:55] believe this message to believe the word
[1:27:01] it's up to him
[1:27:07] before just a moment before I come I was
[1:27:10] talking about ability we're talking
[1:27:14] in reality the word is simple
[1:27:18] if we just take the word
[1:27:21] we have everything that the word says
[1:27:25] all the benefit that God has promised in
[1:27:28] this world
[1:27:30] and if when when it comes to where we go
[1:27:33] away from the world
[1:27:35] the only thing that's needed is to come
[1:27:38] back to the word and you will always
[1:27:40] grip to get the same benefit of the word
[1:27:45] because God has promised says
[1:27:52] I'm going to go towards the end
[1:27:56] the spiritual food in due season
[1:27:59] paragraph paragraph four
[1:28:02] he says
[1:28:08] and I want you to to get built up
[1:28:12] now
[1:28:15] foreign
[1:28:24] the faith of this hour
[1:28:28] so you see it's not the same Faith
[1:28:32] that's the denomination half
[1:28:36] the faith of this hour
[1:28:39] the faith is
[1:28:46] it's going to take more faith than it
[1:28:50] ever was in any age
[1:28:56] for this has to be rapturing Faith
[1:29:01] to be taken up
[1:29:06] and and so we want you to believe
[1:29:13] they want us to believe
[1:29:15] that we believe tonight
[1:29:22] and in all that you have seen and heard
[1:29:29] I'm going to repeat
[1:29:37] so we want you to believe tonight
[1:29:43] in all that you have seen heard
[1:29:49] we want you to have faith
[1:29:54] in all things that you have seen and
[1:29:57] heard
[1:30:00] the word that you have heard preached is
[1:30:07] the signs and the Wonders that you have
[1:30:10] seen done
[1:30:15] we want you to accumulate all of that
[1:30:19] together in your heart
[1:30:22] and considerate
[1:30:27] whether if that be God or not
[1:30:31] God wants us to believe
[1:30:35] magazine
[1:30:36] that we accumulate all of this together
[1:30:39] in our heart
[1:30:43] s
[1:30:47] and it says that we may uh whether that
[1:30:51] we may uh you know see if it's God or
[1:30:54] not but we know it's God
[1:30:59] we know that it's God who spoke to us in
[1:31:02] the same time
[1:31:06] we know that it's God who brought us the
[1:31:09] revelation of his word
[1:31:12] you know when Jesus was on Earth
[1:31:17] one day he asked a question to his
[1:31:19] disciples
[1:31:20] what do they say about the the that I am
[1:31:27] tell prophet he said well some says you
[1:31:31] are such Prophet that you are Elijah
[1:31:34] that you are this that's the circulation
[1:31:37] that was that was what people were
[1:31:39] saying
[1:31:41] I remember there was years years ago
[1:31:46] there was a Jehovah Witness who gave me
[1:31:49] one of those little pamphlets
[1:31:55] the title of it was who do you say Jesus
[1:31:59] was
[1:32:01] I sat down with them
[1:32:05] I said that's a good question
[1:32:09] I said one day Jesus asked the same
[1:32:12] question to his disciples
[1:32:17] he started off by saying what do others
[1:32:19] say what do they say about the son of
[1:32:21] man you don't say come true
[1:32:25] so it's like you asking me a question
[1:32:28] what do you think that Jesus is
[1:32:31] I'll give you my answer
[1:32:33] but I will do like Jesus did and you to
[1:32:38] amen you yourself
[1:32:40] what do you think of Jesus
[1:32:47] now there was a silence
[1:32:51] it was Peter who stood up
[1:32:54] he said you are Christopher Jesus the
[1:32:57] son of the Living God
[1:33:02] and and Jesus was telling you are Simon
[1:33:05] you are Peter it is and it's on this the
[1:33:10] stone
[1:33:12] that I will build my church
[1:33:25] and it's on this Revelation that that
[1:33:28] who Jesus is that the church is built
[1:33:32] upon it is
[1:33:34] even the Gates of Hell
[1:33:37] cannot Prevail against it
[1:33:41] on the church that's built upon the
[1:33:43] revelation of Jesus of Jesus
[1:33:47] the one who knows who Jesus is
[1:33:53] that Jesus in the same time
[1:33:56] where has come to visit us
[1:33:59] he sent us a message
[1:34:02] he confirmed the message he Vindicated
[1:34:05] the message himself
[1:34:08] that if we have faith in the message
[1:34:19] certainly one of these days
[1:34:22] our bodies will be changed
[1:34:29] that the Rapture will not take place
[1:34:32] [Music]
[1:34:35] because we have not recognized our
[1:34:38] position yet
[1:34:54] to receive this message
[1:34:58] and to believe this message with all our
[1:35:01] heart
[1:35:03] to have that faith for the Rapture
[1:35:07] that the Lord may come and find us the
[1:35:10] musician can come
[1:35:13] says
[1:35:15] in the Super
[1:35:17] Signs paragraph 160 167.
[1:35:30] we find out in the Bible that the last
[1:35:33] sign before the promised Sun arrived it
[1:35:36] was a super sign
[1:35:37] Jesus said
[1:35:43] as it was then before the promised Sun
[1:35:46] arrives again
[1:35:50] that super sign will come on Earth again
[1:35:58] I declare to you tonight in the name of
[1:36:01] Jesus Christ
[1:36:05] it's on earth now
[1:36:09] not only that but if the truth is
[1:36:13] but it's it's right here among us
[1:36:17] tonight
[1:36:26] the resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:36:30] it cannot fail
[1:36:34] eternally it's an eternal sign
[1:36:38] it can never be changed
[1:36:42] Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:36:46] but that will never change certain
[1:36:51] Eternal Perpetual it's an eternal sign
[1:36:53] Everlasting sign
[1:36:56] manifested God manifested in the human
[1:36:59] flesh Joseph
[1:37:02] God made himself known in human flesh
[1:37:08] do you believe that to be the truth
[1:37:13] with all your heart do you believe it
[1:37:16] is
[1:37:19] don't shut yourself up like a turtle in
[1:37:22] a shower

[1:37:33] take the shell out listen
[1:37:37] let the Holy Ghost come in
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:37:54] I believe that God has done as much as
[1:37:58] he's going to do
[1:38:04] is the action of the church
[1:38:08] or either we're going to be lost
[1:38:13] God gave us all his secrets
[1:38:19] God has given us has given us all this
[1:38:22] Plan of Salvation
[1:38:24] privilege we are privileged people
[1:38:31] like we heard we were in in this evil
[1:38:34] age
[1:38:37] that the God of this evil age is the
[1:38:40] devil
[1:38:42] but God has shown his grace to us
[1:38:46] because it's an evil age but for a group
[1:38:52] it's the most glorious age
[1:38:57] come to Judas
[1:39:00] when the God of this evil age is is
[1:39:04] acting on a group of people
[1:39:07] [Music]
[1:39:08] we want the God of this glorious age
[1:39:13] that he may work on us
[1:39:17] that he may pull us close to his word
[1:39:23] but he may increase the love for his
[1:39:26] word in our hearts
[1:39:29] that he may pull us to him
[1:39:33] because certainly
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:37] If We Hold Fast
[1:39:41] if we keep this message
