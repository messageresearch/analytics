[29:10] you. It protects you. It guides you. It
[29:12] leads you. It's everything you need and
[29:14] more. If you came into the house of the
[29:16] Lord tonight with something on your
[29:18] heart, make it known to him and his
[29:20] mighty hand will sweep by. It'll touch
[29:21] you in the back. It'll touch you in the

[29:24] sitting, his hand reaches. Hallelujah.
[29:28] We want to remind you that we have
[29:30] prayer meeting this Tuesday from 7 to 8.
[29:33] It's always the first Tuesday after we
[29:35] do communion. Sister Jalicia writes
[29:39] she wasn't feeling well this morning. We
[29:42] just want to keep her in prayer that the
[29:45] mighty hand of God may go by her way
[29:47] where she's at. Give her a touch. We
[29:49] want to remember our pastor who is out
[29:53] laboring. Man, I that's a lot of
[29:55] services. And I know the Lord will give
[29:57] him the strength necessary for the
[29:59] journey to be able to be a blessing to
[30:01] those people.
[30:03] We'll ask brother Orlando to come and
[30:04] pray. Brothers are taking the tithes and
[30:05] offerings. If you could please come up.
[30:29] Let us bow our heads.
[30:32] Most gracious and eternal father,
[30:36] Lord, as we can all reflect, Lord, on
[30:39] your hand that touched us
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; that day at Calvary.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Father, and we can Lord allow our
[30:47] faith being established in that,
[30:51] Lord, that that work that you begun in
[30:53] us, Lord, that you promise to finish it
[30:56] until the day of Jesus Christ. Yes. No
[30:59] matter what storm or pestilence may rise
[31:03] in our lives, Lord, we know, Father,
[31:06] that by your word, you'll see us to the
[31:09] end, Lord. Lord, as we come tonight,
[31:12] Lord God, and Lord, laying all things
[31:14] aside, Father, and putting you first
[31:17] even in this hour, Lord, Lord, a time of
[31:20] consecration, a time of sanctification
[31:24] even in our lives, Father, for for more
[31:26] of you and less of us, Father. Lord, for
[31:29] the needs, Lord, that have been laid
[31:31] before us today, Lord. We we know that
[31:34] only you can meet those needs, Father.
[31:38] Only you can touch us, Father, and feel
[31:40] us, Lord.
[31:42] Lord, he's even as the word was spoken
[31:44] today, Father. And Lord, and how you
[31:48] touched us, Father, and corrected us and
[31:50] shaped us and mold us, Lord, and even
[31:53] brought us back for more of your word
[31:56] today. Lord, we thank you, Father, once
[31:59] again, Lord God, for everything that has
[32:01] transpired in this service, Lord, and we
[32:04] commit the remaining of it as well,
[32:07] Father. Bless the tithes and offering,
[32:09] Lord, that they may be used for the
[32:11] furring of your kingdom, Lord. And
[32:14] we just love you, Father. We bless your
[32:17] name for Father your God and your God
[32:19] all by yourself, Father. For only you
[32:22] are worthy to receive all glory and
[32:24] praises unto thyself and to thyself
[32:26] alone. We love you, Lord. We bless your
[32:29] name. It's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[32:32] Christ I pray. Amen.

[40:57] are doing through your word and that we
[41:00] may see lives change and people come
[41:02] closer to you. Lord, we only have one
[41:05] goal as we heard it this morning that we
[41:07] can make rapture our goal. Lord, I pray,
[41:10] Father, that everything be said that it
[41:12] may lead us in that direction. We have
[41:14] no message of our own, but you've sent
[41:16] us a message, Lord, that we can take and
[41:19] eat of it and being transformed. We want
[41:21] to commit the service into your hands.
[41:23] Once again, Father, we've sang songs and
[41:25] we've done what the man part can do.
[41:27] Now, we invite the God part to come and
[41:29] come on the scene. Bless us, I pray.
[41:32] remember our pastor, those that are not
[41:34] here, those that couldn't make here.
[41:36] Lord, we just pray for them that you may
[41:38] touch their heart and father that you
[41:40] make their burdens a little easier,
[41:42] Lord, that you may make a way, Lord,
[41:44] that they may be gathered with the
[41:45] saints. We commit everything we are and
[41:47] ask those things in the lovely name of
[41:49] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[41:53] Amen. God bless you. Welcome everyone in
[41:55] the house of God for the communion
[41:56] service. Amen. We'll try to
[42:00] not to be too long and
[42:03] uh so we can uh jump right into
[42:05] communion. Uh so let's open our Bible
[42:07] for s uh for scripture reading. Amen.
[42:10] Tonight.
[42:12] Amen. I trust you enjoy the word this
[42:14] morning. Amen. Amen. Certainly ask that
[42:18] the Lord will certainly strengthen and
[42:20] bless our brother Matthew. Amen. I
[42:22] believe he just plowed in there and uh
[42:25] we've been plowing in the same field. So
[42:27] you'll know. And so we've been preaching
[42:30] to one another. And so he came and he
[42:32] preached that and I told him, we'll just
[42:34] touch on what we can so we can move into
[42:36] communion. 1 Corinth uh 1 Peter chapter
[42:39] 1 uh verse one uh through five
[42:46] the scripture says if I could turn there
[42:57] says Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ
[43:00] through the strangers scattered out
[43:02] throughout Pontis and Galatias and
[43:07] Capadashia
[43:09] and Asia and uh uh Bethania. I'm pretty
[43:13] sure I just butchered every name that I
[43:16] just called out. Elected according to
[43:18] the fornowledge of God the Father
[43:21] through sanctification of the Spirit
[43:24] unto obedience unto and the sprinkling
[43:27] of blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto you
[43:31] and peace be multiplied.
[43:34] Blessed be the God of our father uh of
[43:37] our and L and our father Lord Jesus
[43:39] Christ who um according to his abundant
[43:43] mercy has begotten us unto again unto a
[43:47] lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[43:50] Christ from the dead to an inheritance
[43:54] incorruptible undefiled
[43:57] that fadeth not away reserved in heaven
[44:01] for you who are kept
[44:03] by the power of God through faith unto
[44:06] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[44:10] last time. Also, let's turn the
[44:12] scripture that was read this morning in
[44:15] um Exodus chapter 14. Amen.
[44:31] We'll read uh verse 13 and and and
[44:36] uh 134 and 15. It says, "And Moses said
[44:40] unto the people of unto the people, fear
[44:43] ye not. Stand still and see the
[44:46] salvation of the Lord which he will show
[44:49] un show to you today. For the Egyptian
[44:53] which have seen today, ye shall see them
[44:57] again no more forever. The Lord shall
[45:01] fight for you, and ye shall hold your
[45:04] peace. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[45:07] wherefore cry out unto me, speak unto
[45:11] the children of Israel that they go
[45:13] forward. Lord, we ask that you bless
[45:16] your word to us. We commit it to you. In
[45:18] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[45:20] God bless you. have your seats.
[45:25] Man, like I said, I I just want to for
[45:29] the sake of time, uh maybe we'll touch
[45:32] some of these things um in the future,
[45:36] but just for the sake of time, um I just
[45:39] want to uh make statement and move
[45:42] forward. Uh because if I try to read all
[45:45] the quotes, I won't have time. we have
[45:48] communion and I de definitely don't want
[45:50] to take up too much time and I believe
[45:52] the word of God is an exhaustable
[45:55] fountain. You know, I was telling about
[45:56] brotherh Ben in the back. He said, you
[45:58] you start reading and you say, "I'm
[46:01] going to lay a foundation." And pretty
[46:03] soon you realize everything is a
[46:05] foundation.
[46:06] And and so as we heard brother Matthew
[46:09] preached this morning that as
[46:11] Christians, we we have an objective and
[46:14] we have a goal and that's the rapture.
[46:17] And I want to say this even within our
[46:19] own lives that everything that if if
[46:22] something is an objective and a goal for
[46:25] you then everything that you do must
[46:28] line up with that goal and objective.
[46:31] You you can't claim something to be an
[46:33] objective and you do something different
[46:36] because when you speak about objectives
[46:38] and goals really it's not what you say
[46:42] it's the very action you take that
[46:45] really determine what is your objective
[46:47] and what is your goal I could tell you
[46:49] my goal is to become a a an air airplane
[46:53] pilot but if I never taken a class I
[46:56] never done anything that doesn't really
[47:00] qualify It's just words, right? The
[47:02] really what matters is when we we
[47:06] understand what is our objective and
[47:08] what is our goal. If we claim a rapture
[47:11] is our objective and our goal, then the
[47:14] life that we live every day must reflect
[47:17] what is our objective and our goal. Let
[47:20] me say this, not it must reflect it. It
[47:23] actually is reflective of that. So if
[47:26] you claim you're going to heaven, you
[47:28] live like one that's going to heaven. If
[47:30] you claim you you you have rapture as
[47:32] your goal, you live like one whose whose
[47:35] goal is to go in the rapture. So if
[47:38] anybody's action is contrary to what
[47:40] they say, all they are is they are
[47:43] contrarian to themselves. They are
[47:45] basically lying to themselves. They are
[47:47] saying something that cannot be achieved
[47:50] because to achieve something the
[47:52] objective and the action must line up
[47:55] together. So our objective and our goal
[47:58] is not what we say but it's really build
[48:01] and the measure and the unit of
[48:03] measurement for that is our lives.
[48:06] That's why we when you become a
[48:08] Christian it's not what you say. The
[48:10] scripture says when they recognize them
[48:12] to be Christian it wasn't by what they
[48:15] were preaching. It wasn't by what they
[48:17] were saying. They recognized them to be
[48:20] Christian by the life that they were
[48:22] living every day. When they saw their
[48:24] action, when they saw the movement, when
[48:27] they saw the way they were conducting
[48:28] themselves, they were able to take what
[48:31] they were their action and tie it to
[48:34] Jesus action and call them this must be
[48:37] the disciples of that man because they
[48:39] act exactly like that man acted. So it
[48:42] wasn't so much in words but it was in
[48:44] action. Well, so our footsteps, every
[48:47] footstep that we make is a measure
[48:50] towards our objective. And that's why
[48:53] the prophets say often time that even as
[48:56] Christians that the decisions that we
[48:58] make they are leading us somewhere. So
[49:01] we could say we are Christians but we
[49:03] have to be very aware that the decisions
[49:07] that I'm making today and the actions
[49:09] I'm making today they are leading me
[49:11] into a direction. And if we claim once
[49:14] again that the the rapture is our goal,
[49:17] then I believe we have been given the
[49:19] word to lead us into that direction. We
[49:23] have been given what is essential for us
[49:25] to move into that direction. And I want
[49:28] to say this, we live in a time where the
[49:31] word has been provided where what we
[49:34] need to do is to lay in the presence of
[49:37] the son. Brother said that he may bake
[49:40] all the green out of us that we may
[49:43] become that which God wants us to be.
[49:46] Let me say this again. God at the end
[49:49] time is not coming to marry a little
[49:52] girl. He's coming to marry a bride who's
[49:55] made herself ready by the word of God.
[49:58] So the word of God is here to mature us.
[50:01] Because if you really look at this
[50:03] message, this is a message of maturity.
[50:06] And I was talking about a Matthew. I
[50:08] said to me when I look at why Christ
[50:10] speak, it's almost like a dividing line.
[50:13] Yet we are on one side the prophet is
[50:15] bringing the church to a place where
[50:17] they can understand. We as the people of
[50:20] God, we got to stop doubting who we
[50:23] really are. You know, God cannot save
[50:26] you today and tomorrow you think you're
[50:28] lost and there's tomorrow. I if you in
[50:30] that condition, you can never achieve
[50:32] anything. You cannot build a house if
[50:35] you keep breaking the foundation.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; You you if you you cannot build anything
[50:43] if you keep going over the foundation
[50:46] and bu rebuilding it and rebuilding it.
[50:49] What God is wanting out of the believers
[50:51] in this end time is that we can come to
[50:54] a place where we have gone past the
[50:57] doubting of ourselves, the mind battle
[51:00] of ourselves, and we know that we have
[51:02] been elected, called, and commissioned.
[51:05] End of story. I don't care what you do,
[51:08] those things don't change. You can, your
[51:11] behavior can change. What you say can
[51:13] change, but one thing that doesn't
[51:15] change is the word of God. If God
[51:17] commissioned you to a work, let me say
[51:20] this, nobody else can do that work, it's
[51:22] for you to do it. And if God calls you
[51:25] to do it, that means he's equipped you
[51:27] to do the work.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; We cannot keep laying the same
[51:32] foundation. You are elected. You are
[51:34] called and you go out. Oh, praise God.
[51:36] And then you come back so you can hear
[51:38] the same sermon. No. God wants us to
[51:40] move forward.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; God wants a people that come to church,
[51:44] they know that I'm a believer. I've been
[51:47] calling this end time. I'm here to live
[51:49] the life of Christ. I'm here to manifest
[51:52] Christ in this generation and to know if
[51:55] God called me, nothing can stop me.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop me. I cannot even stop
[52:01] myself from it.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I said I was not going to preach.
[52:10] And I want to say this and and the
[52:13] footsteps that we make
[52:15] &gt;&gt; is leading us into that direction. And
[52:18] so therefore, we have to watch for our
[52:21] action. Let me say this. We live in such
[52:23] a most deceitful time that's ever been
[52:26] on the face. So people claim to be
[52:28] Christians, but yet when the word is
[52:31] preached, it pay they pay no respect to
[52:34] the word of God.
[52:36] that they hear the words of the prophet
[52:39] spoken to their ears, it means a zero
[52:42] into them.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; But yet they claim to be Christians.
[52:47] What a deceitful things. I'll tell you
[52:49] when the word is preached, I don't care
[52:51] if God uses a donkey. I don't care what
[52:54] he uses. If it's the word of God, I want
[52:57] something in my heart to say, "God, I
[53:00] want to obey your word." God is no
[53:02] respector of persons. and I try you. I
[53:05] believe you are not respected person
[53:07] because if you are then God will speak
[53:09] and you're going to miss it.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; If you only wait for your favorite
[53:13] preacher to preach so you can believe
[53:16] it, you're going to miss it. If you only
[53:18] wait for that vessel that you believe
[53:20] that God has anointed for him to speak,
[53:23] God can use anybody. What we care is not
[53:26] the vessel. We care about the word of
[53:29] God being preached. And if it's in line
[53:31] with what the messenger said, we receive
[53:33] it.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; We live by it. We eat it.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; We we can't become the word unless we
[53:40] eat the word. Amen.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; So I want to say this and and so we as
[53:49] believers we have to uh uh to the the
[53:53] the the the we have to understand it's
[53:56] the the the more efforts or the the when
[53:59] we put all that we are into this goal
[54:04] &gt;&gt; into this objective
[54:07] that's how we get to the objective. It's
[54:10] not that God hasn't spoken, but there's
[54:12] that's the God part, but there's the man
[54:15] part that has to catch up with the
[54:17] promise. So, it's important when God has
[54:20] spoken, the believers has to believe.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Your part is to believe what God has
[54:26] said. And then that's why the prophet
[54:28] say when God calls a man, he calls a
[54:31] Christian or a preacher, God doesn't
[54:33] make halfway preachers. But he says that
[54:35] a preacher or a man can be halfway. And
[54:38] the reason for the halfwayiness is
[54:40] because they don't believe. They don't
[54:42] surrender. So the believer's part is to
[54:45] surrender into everything that God is
[54:48] calling us to be. So we can be that. So
[54:51] the the resistance that we place in the
[54:54] doubting and all those things is just uh
[54:57] uh basically slowing down the progress
[55:01] &gt;&gt; for us to get to. There's nothing left.
[55:03] The prophet told us the word is here.
[55:06] The messenger has come. So you tell me
[55:09] what is it that we are waiting for?
[55:13] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? So it's for us
[55:15] as believers of the end time to eat the
[55:18] word to in other way. Let me say this.
[55:21] It's for us to eat the revelation of the
[55:24] word. It's for us to eat the word and
[55:26] let the revelation of the word change
[55:29] us.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; It's not for a new preacher or somebody
[55:33] to come and put it in a way that you
[55:34] never heard it before. No. But it's for
[55:37] us to eat the word and be transformed
[55:40] into that word. Lay in the presence of
[55:42] the son and be baked so we can become in
[55:46] the image of what was spoken.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Because you couldn't become unless the
[55:51] word was spoken first. But once the word
[55:54] is already spoken, it's as good as done.
[55:57] So it's for us to move into the finished
[56:00] product
[56:01] &gt;&gt; that has been spoken about us.
[56:07] The word is provided.
[56:10] God is calling us to lay in the presence
[56:13] of the son to attain the goal
[56:17] of the mature bride, the mature person,
[56:21] one who's going into the rapture. And
[56:23] that characteristics can only come, let
[56:27] me say this, it was not exclusively left
[56:29] up to the prophet. One of the things as
[56:32] believers we always have to take out of
[56:34] our mind but said that he even spoke
[56:37] about whatever prophet you call his name
[56:40] I'll tell you the prophet said he's a
[56:42] man just like you are
[56:44] &gt;&gt; right
[56:46] &gt;&gt; you say Moses he says Moses was a man
[56:48] just like you David was a man just like
[56:50] you so it's not a man who fulfills the
[56:54] promise it's gods who fulfilled the
[56:56] promise the common characteristics with
[56:59] all those people is that they have
[57:01] believed the word for the time and they
[57:04] laid in the presence of that word until
[57:07] they became the promise what was spoken
[57:10] to them.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the word has the power of
[57:18] transformation.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; If God spoke a word, that word has the
[57:23] power to transform itself into what God
[57:26] wants it to be.
[57:28] So Moses banana moay he was called
[57:33] and in fact he was born with the
[57:36] equipment.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Think about it born with the equipment.
[57:42] If you go back a little bit in that same
[57:44] message, but talk about the parents,
[57:47] Joabed and Hamraham, he said they pray,
[57:50] they will come and he will come back
[57:51] from work, they will lay there and they
[57:53] will pray, they'll pray until God spoke
[57:56] to them about the coming of a son. But
[57:59] said that that Moses was a proper son.
[58:03] He was one who was actually born for a
[58:06] job. He was one in his own birth. His
[58:09] coming into the world was coming with a
[58:12] purpose attached to his life. And let me
[58:15] say this, your coming into the world is
[58:17] with a purpose. Let me say this, the way
[58:19] that God deals with the prophet is the
[58:22] same way he deals with you. So if I can
[58:24] even take it back and say the very life
[58:27] of William Brandham, yes, an angel came
[58:29] at his birth. You probably didn't see an
[58:31] angel, but God ordained his life the
[58:34] same way that he ordained yours.
[58:36] There's no such a thing as a happen
[58:39] chance in the kingdom of God. Everything
[58:41] is pre-planned. Everything comes
[58:44] according to the plan of God. So when we
[58:46] read the Bible, that's why the prophet
[58:48] will tell us we're reading our own
[58:50] story. I am Abraham. I am Moses.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; There were types for us to look and see
[58:58] ourselves in it.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; It's not say, well, it was Moses. No,
[59:02] put your name in the scripture.
[59:04] Understand that just like Moses, just
[59:07] like you, because God is not a
[59:09] respector. In fact, this God does one
[59:11] thing one way. He's obligated to do it
[59:14] the same way. That's how his believing
[59:16] children recognizes him.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Now, we heard that here he was and his
[59:26] parents told him from a young age how
[59:30] that he was a proper child. How the
[59:32] story of how that they put him on the
[59:35] river and the crocodiles were full of
[59:38] children and they ate all the other
[59:40] children and the pro prophet will say
[59:42] the parents didn't fear and they let the
[59:44] baby go and the baby went and the baby
[59:47] was not eaten and he was saved. All of
[59:49] that they did it by faith because they
[59:52] had directly heard from God and they
[59:54] believed that God was going to spare
[59:56] this child. But let me say this, even
[59:59] with that, that was not enough for Moses
[1:00:01] to get the job done.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; You with me? Born with the equipment,
[1:00:07] heard from parents what he was supposed
[1:00:09] to do, but that was not enough for him
[1:00:12] to do the job. It was a good step, but
[1:00:14] it was not enough. I can say this, a
[1:00:16] preacher can stand here and say, "You
[1:00:18] are predestinated. You are
[1:00:20] predestinated." That is not enough for
[1:00:22] you to get the job done. Moses had to
[1:00:25] come in contact with the God who made
[1:00:27] the promise.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Moses had to come in contact face to
[1:00:33] face with the only one who made the
[1:00:35] promise. So the one who made the promise
[1:00:38] can reveal himself to Moses. So you have
[1:00:41] to come, you can't say the prophet said
[1:00:43] the Bible said. You have to come in
[1:00:45] contact with the God of the Bible, with
[1:00:48] the God of the prophet. So you can know
[1:00:50] for yourself.
[1:00:55] The parents can tell you you are a good
[1:00:57] child. That's wonderful. That's not
[1:00:59] going to save you.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; It's just a step in the right direction.
[1:01:04] We need to come in contact with the God
[1:01:07] of this Bible.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; The one who sent the prophet, just the
[1:01:11] same way he spoke to the prophet, the
[1:01:13] same God will speak to you so you can
[1:01:15] know for yourself that you have been
[1:01:18] called. because that's the only thing
[1:01:20] that would make that word a reality
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; is to come in contact with that same
[1:01:25] God.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; So there's not a an amount of intellect
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; we can gather together, read the entire
[1:01:34] message or the entire Bible and then
[1:01:37] somehow change the intellect into
[1:01:39] revelation. No, it takes for you to meet
[1:01:42] the maker himself.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:55] So your election
[1:01:57] is not a product of a preacher standing
[1:02:00] up and claiming you are elect and then
[1:02:02] you go home and you go sleep you say
[1:02:04] thank God I'm elected.
[1:02:06] I I I don't know about you but I just
[1:02:08] want to say this as a Christian and I
[1:02:11] said this before we have to have a
[1:02:13] curiosity
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; about the things of God. There has to be
[1:02:17] a healthy e curiosity within your life.
[1:02:21] When you hear something, you just want
[1:02:22] to know for yourself. God, I don't
[1:02:25] understand you with the rock in the
[1:02:26] wilderness, the rock that brought water,
[1:02:29] the br that did this. I just don't
[1:02:31] understand. Can you just talk to me? I
[1:02:33] tell you, he loves that.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; He loves for you to know him yourself.
[1:02:37] He loves for him to reveal the scripture
[1:02:40] to you. Just like the the the the the
[1:02:42] disciples on the way of Emmas, he loves
[1:02:45] to fellowship with his children.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; I think I need to stop. I
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; we're going to have
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; we we will continue another time.
[1:03:01] And and if you try to do it your own
[1:03:03] way,
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; you'll get the same results that Moses
[1:03:07] got. Yes.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; If you try to live Christian life
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; based on what you heard somebody say,
[1:03:13] what you what you read in the Bible
[1:03:15] yourself without the contact,
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; you will produce the same result that
[1:03:20] Moses produced. What we need is to hear
[1:03:23] the word, go on our knees and make
[1:03:25] contact with the creator. Say, Lord, I
[1:03:28] heard that if I call upon the name of
[1:03:30] the Lord, I shall be saved. Now, I heard
[1:03:33] it from a preacher. I heard it from a
[1:03:35] pastor. I even heard it from the
[1:03:37] messenger. Now I'm here that you can
[1:03:40] take what I heard and make it a reality.
[1:03:43] God walks us with his children by
[1:03:46] revelation and by reality. In fact, but
[1:03:49] I'm saying this because that happened,
[1:03:51] Moses all of the sudden esteemed the
[1:03:55] reproach of Christ.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Better than all the
[1:04:02] greatness of Egypt. Amen.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; You think a man can do that?
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I I think you got to go back and
[1:04:08] read what was the grad of Egypt to
[1:04:11] understand where Moses was.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; You You can't forsake the world by your
[1:04:21] own self.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; You You cannot change, turn around,
[1:04:27] unless you need something that's better.
[1:04:33] You can't. You lying to yourself. Come
[1:04:36] in contact with this Jehovah and let him
[1:04:40] make himself known unto you. That's what
[1:04:42] the real change comes from. That's how
[1:04:45] you live the drugs and the things and
[1:04:47] the lying. That's how you desire God is
[1:04:50] by coming in contact with our God.
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; It's not by what some preacher said
[1:04:59] somewhere. It's not by you just saying,
[1:05:01] "Oh, this sounds like it's interesting.
[1:05:03] I want to find out." No, you got to go
[1:05:05] and make contact.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; That's what changes the heart.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; One who was in the greatness of Egypt
[1:05:14] than everything that he could look for.
[1:05:17] In fact, all he had to do was just wait
[1:05:19] couple of years and it will be a pharaoh
[1:05:21] and it will take the children of one who
[1:05:23] knew the might of what Egypt
[1:05:26] represented.
[1:05:29] But it's this heain that reproach of
[1:05:33] Christ when he come in contact with that
[1:05:35] pillar of fire when he contact when he
[1:05:38] can make contact with the burning bush
[1:05:40] it changed his life forever
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; and let me say that we are not spared
[1:05:45] from that
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; we we do and I won't even speak to
[1:05:50] myself there's a lot of things that we
[1:05:51] know that's just still intellectual
[1:05:54] understanding and and and that's fine
[1:05:57] you know We even preach about it, we
[1:05:59] scream about it, and we rejoice over it.
[1:06:01] But brothers and sister, let's move into
[1:06:04] that place where it could become a
[1:06:06] reality. Where those things that we know
[1:06:10] about the bride coming of Christ, about
[1:06:12] Jesus manifested in the bride. Father, I
[1:06:14] hear this. I hear the prophet talk about
[1:06:16] all of this thing. And I love it with
[1:06:18] all my heart, but I need it to become a
[1:06:21] reality somehow. I want to look at my
[1:06:24] own life and see Jesus Christ
[1:06:26] manifested. I want to look at my own
[1:06:28] life and see Christ walking in the midst
[1:06:31] of it.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; That's the objective that produces the
[1:06:38] rapture.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Any other objective will gather up a
[1:06:43] bunch of knowledge and you know
[1:06:46] certainly you could build a kingdom off
[1:06:47] of it
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; but it's not going to enter you in
[1:06:51] there.
[1:06:53] The objective that gets you in there is
[1:06:56] to come under the shed blood and to say,
[1:06:59] "Father, you've provided a way and I
[1:07:02] want to live by that way."
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; But Ram said, "What Moses lack the
[1:07:08] burning bush had."
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this, what we lack as
[1:07:12] a reality of God, this message has it.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Not just the message in in words, but
[1:07:19] the message in the spirit. I was talking
[1:07:22] to my father-in-law. I said, "What I've
[1:07:24] seen most of the time happen at the same
[1:07:26] time." People, we have embraced the
[1:07:28] message of William Brandham, but we've
[1:07:30] left the spirit of it out.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; We we've taken the doctrines and just
[1:07:37] ran away with it. My we could explain
[1:07:40] the son of man and we could talk and
[1:07:42] just have everybody standing up, but the
[1:07:44] spirit of it is nowhere to be found.
[1:07:49] Otherwise, it wouldn't create division.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; The division comes when there's a bunch
[1:07:55] of men's idea inserted in there.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; If we could just stick with what he
[1:07:59] said, it wouldn't produce any division.
[1:08:01] If we can just remove ourselves from the
[1:08:04] picture, it wouldn't create a problem.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to be seen. Oh, I know
[1:08:09] something. We don't nothing.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; We know nothing.
[1:08:17] He died for us. Have you ever died for
[1:08:19] somebody?
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; He gave his life so we can have this.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; The prophet gave up so much so we can
[1:08:27] have this. What did you give up?
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[1:08:41] I I really I'm trying hard. I'm sorry.
[1:08:43] Forgive me.
[1:08:49] So he esteemed
[1:08:53] the reproach of Christ better than the
[1:08:55] riches in the glory of Egypt. And I want
[1:08:58] to say this, no man can come to that
[1:09:00] conclusion until they've met the master
[1:09:03] himself.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Until they've met the maker himself.
[1:09:08] Because only the maker had better than
[1:09:11] what Egypt could offer.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; There was no other kingdom on earth that
[1:09:16] could offer something that Moses can
[1:09:18] look and compare and say, "I'll leave
[1:09:21] this one and I'll follow the other."
[1:09:24] The equipment said one place he said God
[1:09:27] is wanting us to use what's inside of
[1:09:29] us. He's not wanting us to go and create
[1:09:33] something new. and I'm just paraphrasing
[1:09:36] or try to walk by some thinking
[1:09:38] somewhere. The only way we can achieve
[1:09:41] this is by realizing I have been elected
[1:09:44] and called and I have been commissioned.
[1:09:47] I am just walking in this. I don't care
[1:09:50] whether you have understanding or no
[1:09:52] understanding but I'm just walking in
[1:09:54] obedience to what he has given me.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Now we have people that are so smart
[1:10:01] they can even correct the prophet. They
[1:10:04] can even say what the prophet didn't
[1:10:05] mean to say or forgot to say.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; What foolishness.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; You know, I feel like saying like what
[1:10:18] what what what what God told when he
[1:10:20] came to Miriam. He said, "You tell me
[1:10:23] when I came, I gave this message. Did I
[1:10:25] come talk to you?
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Tell me which of these men did I come
[1:10:30] talk to?"
[1:10:32] It said, "But Moses, my servant, I speak
[1:10:35] to him lip to ear."
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with just humbling
[1:10:43] ourselves and saying that the prophet
[1:10:45] saying that's what we're going to
[1:10:47] follow?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; There can't be two leaders. There's only
[1:10:50] one.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; The musician could come. I'm sorry. I'm
[1:10:57] just going to keep going. I know we have
[1:10:59] communion. We'll continue another time.
[1:11:03] Amen. If the brothers could get ready.
[1:11:13] I get I guess I suffer from the preacher
[1:11:15] syndrome. When you open it, you say it's
[1:11:17] small and it gets bigger and bigger. But
[1:11:20] we thank God for it. Amen.
[1:11:23] Man, let's turn. We're going to read a
[1:11:26] scripture for communion.
[1:11:36] Man, let's just remember our pastor. I
[1:11:38] talked to him this afternoon. They
[1:11:40] finished the meetings in Congo. Uh
[1:11:43] tomorrow, bright early in the morning,
[1:11:45] they're going to be flying to Harare,
[1:11:47] Zimbabwe, uh for the next round. And we
[1:11:50] just pray that the Lord will strengthen
[1:11:52] him. It's a very early flight. It's
[1:11:54] really like, you know, the very early.
[1:11:56] So we just pray that God will strengthen
[1:11:58] them that they can go over and uh and
[1:12:01] and preach those uh services over there.
[1:12:04] May let's turn our Bibles to uh 1
[1:12:06] Corinthians chap 11 verse 20 the 23rd
[1:12:09] verse.
[1:12:11] A very familiar scripture reading and
[1:12:13] certainly appreciate everybody coming
[1:12:15] into the house of God for communion.
[1:12:17] Amen. I trust this is what will move us
[1:12:19] forward. Amen. This is this is our
[1:12:22] objective. If rapture is our objective,
[1:12:24] we observe all the commandments. If if
[1:12:26] God says it, I want to be like Peter
[1:12:28] said, "I don't understand what you say,
[1:12:30] but one thing I know is you have the
[1:12:32] words of eternal life." That's that's I
[1:12:35] just want to be the dumbest believer
[1:12:36] that they could be. One who just
[1:12:38] believed because they heard because I
[1:12:40] know he brings understanding as we work
[1:12:43] along.
[1:12:44] He says, "For I have received of the
[1:12:47] Lord that which I have delivered unto
[1:12:48] you, that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:12:51] in which he was betrayed, took bread,
[1:12:53] and when he had given thanks, he broke
[1:12:56] it and said, Take, eat. This is my body
[1:12:59] which is broken for you. Do this this do
[1:13:03] in remembrance of me." And after the
[1:13:05] same manner, he also took the cup when
[1:13:08] he had stopped, saying, "This cup is the
[1:13:10] new testament of my blood. This do ye as
[1:13:14] often as ye drink, drink it in
[1:13:17] remembrance of me. For
[1:13:20] as often as ye eat this bread and drink
[1:13:23] this cup, ye do show the Lord's uh death
[1:13:27] till I till he come. Wherefore whosoever
[1:13:30] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:13:32] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:13:35] of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[1:13:37] But let every man examine himself, and
[1:13:39] so let him eat of that bread, and drink
[1:13:42] of that cup. For he that eateth and
[1:13:45] drinkketh unworthily, eateth and
[1:13:47] drinkketh damnation unto himself, not
[1:13:49] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[1:13:52] cause many are weak and sickly among
[1:13:55] you, and many sleep. For if we would
[1:13:58] judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:14:00] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:14:02] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:14:05] be condemned with the world. Wherefore,
[1:14:08] my brethren, when ye come to eat
[1:14:12] together to eat, tar one for another,
[1:14:14] and if any man hunger, let him eat at
[1:14:17] home, and let and that ye come not to uh
[1:14:21] together unto condemnation, and the rest
[1:14:23] will I set in order when I come. Amen.
[1:14:26] Let's just pray over the communion.
[1:14:29] Our
[1:14:35] gracious father, we so thankful for your
[1:14:37] grace and your mercy.
[1:14:40] Lord, we certainly
[1:14:43] just find how small we are when we stand
[1:14:46] in front of a God such as you. We are so
[1:14:49] humbled by the things that you do and
[1:14:52] your greatness, oh God. And father even
[1:14:55] as the prophet will say even the angels
[1:14:58] are dirty before you Lord. And you are
[1:15:01] three times holy. And father when you
[1:15:04] speak you speak only the truth. When you
[1:15:07] speak you speak life father. And as your
[1:15:10] believing children because of that
[1:15:12] understanding we take every word that
[1:15:14] you say just as life. We don't question
[1:15:17] it. We don't try to understand it. We
[1:15:19] just take it. And we know that you will
[1:15:21] give us the understanding when we need
[1:15:23] it. Even as our brother Matthew
[1:15:25] preached, when we get to it, you will
[1:15:27] reveal it to us. We ask that you bless
[1:15:29] this communion. Father, the bread that
[1:15:32] represents your body. Father, I heard
[1:15:34] your prophet say that there's healing in
[1:15:36] communion. Father, there's deliverance
[1:15:38] in communion. Father, I believe with all
[1:15:40] my heart that we can take it tonight.
[1:15:43] And Father, every sickness represented
[1:15:45] in this place will go away. that every
[1:15:48] need, everything represented in this
[1:15:50] place that we'll go out of here better
[1:15:52] than the way we came, Father, because
[1:15:54] we've taken off your communion. We ask
[1:15:56] you bless it, Father. The blood that
[1:15:58] represented the very stimulation of rea
[1:16:02] revelation, Father, as we take it, may
[1:16:04] you just come, oh God, and fulfill your
[1:16:07] word in us. We pray, Father, that if
[1:16:10] there be one here that feels unworthy,
[1:16:12] Father, only you can make worthy.
[1:16:14] Father, we as humans, we have no ability
[1:16:17] even to clean our own selves. All we
[1:16:20] rely on is the shed blood of the Lord
[1:16:22] Jesus Christ. And Father, you said in
[1:16:24] your word that we have to come by faith
[1:16:26] because that's the only way you can
[1:16:28] accept us. Faith is the only thing that
[1:16:31] pleases you. And I pray tonight, Father,
[1:16:32] that we can come and Lord and not to
[1:16:35] clean ourselves, but you clean us and
[1:16:37] you make us ready for what we have need
[1:16:39] of. Lord, bless this as we take it,
[1:16:42] Lord. Everyone that will put his hand in
[1:16:43] here, Father, bless him. Those that feel
[1:16:46] like they couldn't put their hands in
[1:16:47] here. Father, I pray that you deal with
[1:16:49] their heart and you reveal yourself to
[1:16:51] them until they clean their life and
[1:16:54] feel worthy enough to come to the table
[1:16:56] to eat of your bread. Take this part of
[1:16:58] the service into your hands. We commit
[1:17:00] it to you and ask this, Lord, knowing
[1:17:02] that miracles and things will be worked
[1:17:04] out out of this because you said when we
[1:17:07] do your word, Father, that you will come
[1:17:09] and manifest the supernatural in our
[1:17:11] midst. We commit it and ask these things
[1:17:13] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[1:17:15] pray. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
