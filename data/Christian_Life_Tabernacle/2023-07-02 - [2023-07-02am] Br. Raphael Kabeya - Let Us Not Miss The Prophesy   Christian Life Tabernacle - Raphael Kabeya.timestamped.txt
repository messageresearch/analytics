[4:33] amen that's the
[4:35] that's the most important
[4:38] part of it

[5:34] can get it under control and that God
[5:37] will be merciful anybody else have an
[5:40] unspoken request this morning he wanted

[8:38] keep us in prayer brother Mike God bless
[8:41] you this morning
[8:43] always good to hear the word of
[8:45] exhortation my brother bless the Lord be
[8:48] with you today
[8:50] thank you
[8:53] when I put it on I could barely see so
[8:55] I'm glad it but it worked out good
[8:58] morning
[8:59] you know maybe it's uh just me but there
[9:02] are certain phrases that you know people
[9:05] use in casual conversation that I kind
[9:08] of walk away thinking you know maybe
[9:11] maybe we should think about that a
[9:14] little bit more before we say things
[9:15] like that
[9:17] you know one of those phrases that you
[9:19] hear quite a bit is when people say
[9:22] you know they say this will happen
[9:26] or they say this is what's going on or
[9:30] they say
[9:31] this is what it's like
[9:33] they say this and they say that
[9:38] and I always want to stop a minute and
[9:40] say wait a minute
[9:41] who's they
[9:44] let's let's you know sometimes it's used
[9:47] as a statement of Authority or truth and
[9:50] you know if words or thoughts expressed
[9:54] let's take a moment and think who's
[9:56] whose thoughts are these
[9:59] and let's get down to who's the they and
[10:02] they say
[10:03] and I was thinking about that as I was
[10:05] reading Psalm 129 this week
[10:08] and just kind of was going over in my
[10:10] mind and
[10:11] it's a different kind of chapter
[10:14] but it it starts out with
[10:17] this statement in verse one
[10:20] many a Time have they Afflicted me from
[10:24] my youth
[10:25] May Israel now say
[10:28] many a Time have they Afflicted me from
[10:32] my youth
[10:34] you know I thought about that as I was
[10:36] reading and I said wait a minute
[10:38] who's they
[10:42] we can find the answer in verse 5.
[10:45] it says them that hate Zion
[10:50] they
[10:52] those who hate Zion
[10:55] have Afflicted me from my youth
[10:58] who's that
[11:01] who hates Zion
[11:04] you know most people don't even know
[11:06] what Zion is
[11:07] you know most people are honestly
[11:11] clueless to the work that God is doing
[11:16] you know it says in verse 2 May Israel
[11:19] now say
[11:21] you know and I was reading that you know
[11:23] we tend to make this about a historical
[11:25] people
[11:27] or a geographic place
[11:30] the people who are descendants of
[11:32] Abraham and followers of Moses
[11:36] and those who may have historically
[11:38] hated them for political or religious
[11:41] reasons but you know Paul made clear in
[11:44] Romans 2 28 he said for he is not a Jew
[11:48] which is one outwardly no
[11:50] no neither is that circumcision which is
[11:53] outward in the flesh
[11:55] but he is a Jew which is one inwardly
[11:59] and circumcision is that of the heart
[12:02] in the spirit
[12:05] and not in the letter
[12:07] whose praise
[12:09] is not of men
[12:11] but of God
[12:13] see Israel is not about a nation or a
[12:16] race
[12:17] but it's about a people with another
[12:19] kind of identifying characteristic
[12:22] and Paul goes on in Romans to describe
[12:24] that as being that Faith seed that
[12:27] Abraham had it's also not about
[12:29] following the religious teachings of
[12:32] Moses as Jesus told his told the
[12:34] Pharisees in John 5 or had he believed
[12:37] Moses
[12:38] you would have believed me
[12:40] for he wrote Of Me
[12:45] so Israel are those who share that same
[12:48] Faith seed
[12:50] as their father Abraham
[12:53] people who have their faith people
[12:56] they're revelated people they're people
[12:58] that have been awakened
[13:01] quickened
[13:02] by him who is the word of life
[13:06] as we've seen so many times in the psalm
[13:08] before Zion is not a geographic place on
[13:11] a map
[13:14] but it's that dwelling place where he
[13:16] dwells with his people
[13:19] that place of cohabitation
[13:21] where word is with word in Fellowship
[13:25] again that place that Jesus went to go
[13:28] prepare for us in John 14.
[13:31] so when we read this scripture
[13:34] they have afflicted
[13:37] me from my youth they that hate Zion
[13:42] you know how many of us can honestly say
[13:46] that you know
[13:48] we frequently encounter people who
[13:51] afflict us because we
[13:53] believe in having fellowship with the
[13:55] Lord
[13:56] I mean we occasionally encounter people
[13:58] who react negatively to us but
[14:01] continuously from our youth because we
[14:04] have fellowship with the Lord
[14:07] and yet as it says
[14:09] in Psalm 129 many a Time have they
[14:12] Afflicted me from my youth that's the
[14:14] testimony of those who are called Israel
[14:18] see how can people around us hate
[14:20] something they don't even recognize
[14:21] what's going on so what
[14:23] what is this who are they
[14:27] you know in his
[14:30] final words to his disciples before he
[14:32] went to the cross
[14:34] which that's just a wonderful portion of
[14:36] scripture to spend time in is those
[14:38] Final hours which Jesus spent with his
[14:40] disciples
[14:41] he said in John 15 18 if the world hate
[14:44] you
[14:45] ye know that it hated me before it hated
[14:48] you
[14:50] if ye were of the world the world would
[14:53] love his own
[14:54] but because you are not of the world
[14:57] but I have chosen you out of the world
[15:01] therefore the world hateth you
[15:04] John goes on to say in first John 2 15
[15:07] love not the world
[15:10] neither the things that are in the world
[15:13] If any man loved the world the love of
[15:16] the father is not in him
[15:18] for all that is of the world
[15:22] the lust of the Flesh and the lust of
[15:25] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[15:27] the father
[15:28] but is of the world
[15:30] in James as always is most to the point
[15:35] he says in James 4 4 ye adulterers and
[15:38] adulteresses
[15:40] know ye not that friendship with the
[15:43] world
[15:44] is enmity with God
[15:48] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[15:50] the world
[15:51] is the enemy of God
[15:53] do you know what the definition of
[15:55] enmity is according to Webster
[15:58] hatred
[16:00] in other words the scriptural definition
[16:03] of hating the Lord is loving the world
[16:09] if Israel are those
[16:12] who like Abraham could be counted a
[16:15] friend of God
[16:17] and Zion is that place of Fellowship
[16:19] where God dwells with his people
[16:23] and of course friendship with the world
[16:27] fellowship with all that the world is
[16:31] that is hate of Zion
[16:35] as Jesus said no man can serve two
[16:37] masters
[16:39] either he will hate the one and love the
[16:42] other
[16:42] or else he will hold to the one and
[16:45] despise the other
[16:48] you see they that hate Zion are not
[16:49] people
[16:52] all that is in this world
[16:56] that from our youth
[16:58] continually
[17:00] has that pull on us
[17:01] continually afflicts us continually
[17:04] tries to get us to find an alliance
[17:08] somewhere
[17:09] with a cheap alternative
[17:12] to that fellowship and that cohabitation
[17:15] to which we who are Israel have been
[17:18] called
[17:21] to replace the fellowship that he offers
[17:23] us with a worldly replacement
[17:27] many a Time have they
[17:30] all that is in the world
[17:32] Afflicted me from my youth May Israel
[17:36] Israel now say
[17:39] many a Time have they Afflicted me from
[17:42] my youth
[17:43] but I like this
[17:45] yet they have not prevailed against me
[17:51] I wonder if that's anyone's testimony
[17:53] this morning
[17:55] instead of them prevailing against me
[17:59] remember Jesus told Peter one day on
[18:02] Matthew in Matthew 16 Upon This Rock
[18:06] Revelation that Faith seed
[18:10] will I build my church and the Gates of
[18:12] Hell shall not prevail
[18:14] against it
[18:15] we want to go ahead and stand this
[18:17] morning we're going to read Psalm 129 he
[18:19] says in verse 4
[18:21] the Lord is righteous
[18:23] he hath cut asunder the cords of the
[18:27] wicked
[18:28] I think we can say Amen to that those
[18:30] cords have been cut
[18:33] and they have not prevailed against me
[18:36] so let's just read that little Psalm
[18:38] together psalm 129.
[18:40] many a Time have they Afflicted me from
[18:43] my youth May Israel now say many a Time
[18:47] have they Afflicted me from my youth yet
[18:49] they have not prevailed against me
[18:52] flowers plowed upon my back they made
[18:55] long their furrows the Lord is righteous
[18:57] he hath cut asunder the cords of the
[19:00] wicked let them all be confounded and
[19:02] turned back that hate Zion let them be
[19:05] as the grass upon the house tops which
[19:07] withereth afford groweth up wherewith
[19:10] the mower filleth not his hand nor he
[19:12] that bindeth sheaves his bosom neither
[19:15] do they which go by say the blessing of
[19:17] the Lord be upon you we bless you in the
[19:20] name of the Lord amen

[46:22] Lord
[46:24] bless the pastor
[46:28] all the people that work around him
[46:33] that they will all be under one Accord
[46:36] under one Christian spirit I think it is
[46:40] that so that all the ones that comes to
[46:43] judge this church beneficiary
[46:45] benediction
[46:47] that they may benefit of the great
[46:49] things of redemption
[46:51] no but get us out of the way
[46:55] and bless us by Your Word because
[47:00] outside of your word we have nothing
[47:02] else
[47:07] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[47:12] you may have a seat for a moment
[47:21] how great you're all in the name of the
[47:24] Lord Jesus Christ
[47:27] my wife also joined me to
[47:30] greet you all
[47:33] uh
[47:36] [Music]
[47:38] I have to be honest with you or to be
[47:42] honest with you that you have a
[47:44] wonderful Church in Bonnie Lee's a
[47:46] wonderful Church
[47:48] and
[47:51] sample a fidelo prophet because God has
[47:55] given you a wonderful gift that's simple
[47:57] to the prophet MO
[48:01] SES
[48:04] honestly without a flattery I appreciate
[48:09] Brother David McGarry
[48:14] a profound he he brings the word holding
[48:19] on to the prophet in a simple but deep
[48:23] manner
[48:31] and I believe if you if you support the
[48:34] cause honestly God will do a lot of
[48:37] wonderful things among you um
[48:43] you know the the sun rises in silence
[48:47] but it does a lot of great work
[48:55] and I don't think it's a lot of noise or
[48:58] a lot of agitation that will do
[49:00] something for the people of God
[49:03] just the word of God
[49:06] and in this age do you see Revolution
[49:12] God revealed himself in Simplicity in
[49:15] using a simple man
[49:17] a
[49:18] envelope
[49:21] in coming here the last time
[49:27] I was telling Brother David I was very
[49:29] tired and com and you stop
[49:35] I didn't feel like standing up and
[49:38] preaching
[49:41] because I do a lot of work back home in
[49:45] Congo
[49:48] [Music]
[49:51] I would like this morning to give you
[49:54] the opportunity to see what we are doing
[49:57] before we get to the word
[50:02] you know I'm getting older
[50:04] Museum
[50:12] but I have a lot of Burden for the the
[50:15] souls in The Villages where people don't
[50:18] go that often
[50:21] because God has his children everywhere
[50:25] they are just not in big cities
[50:30] the in villages there are also children
[50:33] of God
[50:34] unfortunately
[50:39] Village one time I took a brother from
[50:43] here in the village back from Canada
[50:46] back in the village
[50:49] he preached under a tree
[50:53] and they were very happy to do that
[50:56] because that's what I do
[51:00] so I have a few images that I'd like to
[51:03] show you
[51:05] before we could get to the word on a
[51:08] technique
[51:09] let me show you the first image
[51:16] no that's not the first one but that's
[51:19] all right sassy
[51:21] cities
[51:29] okay
[51:35] that that image right there is a church
[51:38] that's about
[51:39] 140 kilometer from brazzerville it's a
[51:43] village
[51:46] when we get there there's a lot of
[51:49] people they're very enthusiastic
[51:54] you could see it's just a hanger with
[51:57] roof on top
[52:00] you can go to the next
[52:30] let's go to the next one
[52:39] I went to bless the wedding it was a
[52:42] couple of months ago it is
[52:46] 239 kilometers from Brazos
[52:50] we can go to the next one
[52:56] Village
[52:59] this this Village is named
[53:02] it's uh the village where the president
[53:05] comes from president
[53:08] that's the church we started over there
[53:12] there's a lot of people that come to
[53:14] that church
[53:30] people love the word they love this
[53:32] message
[53:35] because this message is different from
[53:37] denominations
[53:39] you can go to the next one
[53:50] which is the capital
[53:52] economic capital of Congo the museum we
[53:56] also have a group of people there is
[54:02] we were renting the place
[54:07] we already found the place that we're
[54:10] gonna we're starting the construction
[54:13] and you can go to the next
[54:17] thank you
[54:20] learn some Brazil verses in Brazil
[54:26] this is
[54:28] when he came to visit us
[54:34] so this is the main church
[54:36] it's my headquarters
[54:41] video and the next one is a video clip
[54:48] to show the the the new church that we
[54:51] are building
[54:59] thank you
[55:01] so yeah
[55:07] principal that says the the road yeah
[55:15] we started May 1st 2021
[55:21] didn't even 2021.
[55:27] [Music]
[55:32] many people are asking when it's going
[55:36] to be the dedication
[55:41] we are trying to finalize all the work
[55:48] because at our old church there was no
[55:51] parking place
[55:54] [Music]
[55:56] it was a little bit difficult because
[55:58] people had to go park at the neighbors
[56:01] places
[56:13] so we're still working on it from May
[56:18] 1st 2021 we're still building
[56:23] and God is helping us move little by
[56:25] little
[56:27] looking
[56:30] [Music]
[56:32] um
[56:35] don't forget to please pray for those
[56:38] that are working with us
[56:39] because God hears prayers
[56:45] [Music]
[56:48] this is
[56:53] because those are tiles that we're
[56:55] already about to be placed in the
[56:57] sanctuary
[56:59] a portion of the times
[57:05] you see the Mason and you see that
[57:08] that's the main sanctuary
[57:12] [Music]
[57:14] we don't have any anything on top yet
[57:27] [Music]
[57:30] it's a little bit difficult for me to
[57:33] rest that's
[57:35] because in the inside the The Villages
[57:40] they call me foreign
[57:42] we have to go and help with the people's
[57:45] food people you have to pray for people
[57:52] even here from here they will call me I
[57:56] have to stop and and and and and answer
[57:58] and pray and see
[58:02] the work that we are trying to do
[58:05] we want to be we want you to pray for us
[58:10] I think that's good enough that's what
[58:13] all we wanted to show
[58:15] we can read the word
[58:25] second Peter chapter 1 verse 19.
[58:50] it's on the chair on the chair
[58:56] please
[59:13] we have also a more sure word of
[59:16] Prophecy we're unto ye do well that ye
[59:20] take heed as unto a light thy shineth
[59:23] and dark place until the day Dawn and
[59:27] the day star arise in your heart session
[59:30] particularly
[59:36] knowing this first that no prophecy
[59:40] no Prophecy of the scriptures is of any
[59:43] private interpretation
[59:47] curves
[59:58] for the prophecy came not in the old
[1:00:01] time by the will of men by the holy man
[1:00:04] of God spake as they were moved by the
[1:00:08] Holy Ghost
[1:00:10] the Lord had the blessing to the reading
[1:00:12] of his word our gracious father
[1:00:16] we just read as every man would read
[1:00:20] when you put us out of the way that you
[1:00:24] may take control
[1:00:25] and bless us this morning in the name of
[1:00:29] Jesus Christ amen amen have your seat
[1:00:39] [Music]
[1:00:44] a title this morning I want to title it
[1:00:47] let's not miss the prophecy
[1:00:52] let's not miss the prophecy
[1:00:55] is
[1:00:57] in a few or what uh in
[1:01:02] um
[1:01:03] I will start off by saying
[1:01:08] the prophet says this
[1:01:11] is
[1:01:15] we can we can we can be in this Accord
[1:01:19] we may not agree one with another
[1:01:22] a person
[1:01:24] there is nobody
[1:01:27] personally Young
[1:01:31] there's not two people with two minds
[1:01:35] exactly the same
[1:01:37] two two in the fingers together
[1:01:42] two of the fingers together the same
[1:01:45] person
[1:01:47] there's not two people with two two
[1:01:50] identical noses
[1:01:56] I believe that you have a brother that
[1:01:58] you don't have a nose like mine
[1:02:06] I told you this morning that you have a
[1:02:09] wonderful Pastor who brings you a word
[1:02:11] according to the prophet is
[1:02:18] I I cannot try to be like him because
[1:02:20] it's a person different from me
[1:02:24] but we have one thing in common it's
[1:02:27] Jesus Christ
[1:02:33] it's me that is saying this
[1:02:38] God has made us all different
[1:02:41] that's where I love the greatness of God
[1:02:46] that of the billions that they are in
[1:02:49] the world
[1:02:51] they are not two people that look alike
[1:03:14] because no one can do identical things
[1:03:17] like God can do
[1:03:20] everyone is
[1:03:24] every digital print is different from
[1:03:27] another remember even on my hand
[1:03:32] they are not prints that digital prints
[1:03:35] that looks the same
[1:03:37] that's why our God is really infinite
[1:03:41] as he knows all those things
[1:03:45] there's nothing that he doesn't know
[1:03:47] about you
[1:03:49] then
[1:03:52] God has made us different we have have
[1:03:55] to agree to that is
[1:03:58] is useless to try to imitate one another
[1:04:03] or imitate somebody
[1:04:07] or to want somebody to act like you
[1:04:11] everyone is different it don't sit but
[1:04:14] sit particularly and this particularity
[1:04:19] we are forming a Unity
[1:04:30] but I am one is
[1:04:33] the same with the body of Christ
[1:04:36] if we can understand that
[1:04:40] we're going to be patient with one
[1:04:43] another
[1:04:44] we're going to work together
[1:04:48] we're gonna uh complete one another in
[1:04:52] our differences
[1:04:53] but as I said moment ago
[1:04:57] there's one thing we have in common and
[1:05:00] that's Christ
[1:05:02] that's what we have in common
[1:05:05] he died for all of us
[1:05:08] and we are all under his blood says
[1:05:12] that's what makes a perfect Unity
[1:05:19] there's no way to that to make the
[1:05:22] churches that will be won
[1:05:24] we don't we're not looking for the unity
[1:05:27] of the churches
[1:05:29] we are looking for the unity of the
[1:05:32] faith
[1:05:34] regardless of what church you belong to
[1:05:37] we have the same faith
[1:05:39] in the message of the hour
[1:05:44] and then we have to take the message of
[1:05:46] the hour as he was brought to us
[1:05:50] and that's what I see being taught here
[1:05:53] and I'm very happy with
[1:06:09] it's a declaration that we need to take
[1:06:12] seriously
[1:06:14] a portion for each age
[1:06:32] we cannot take a message from one age to
[1:06:35] another age it won't work
[1:06:41] Moses could not preach the message of
[1:06:43] Noah no way
[1:06:45] and nowhere the same way he couldn't
[1:06:48] preach the message of someone else
[1:06:54] Martin Luther could not preach the
[1:06:57] Catholic message
[1:06:58] and we can go forward
[1:07:01] and to get to this age
[1:07:05] to say that it's useless that the
[1:07:07] Pentecostals
[1:07:11] though to continue with the Methodist
[1:07:14] matters because now the bride is being
[1:07:16] called out
[1:07:17] foreign
[1:07:56] and then we have to be well informed so
[1:07:59] we can understand what's supposed to
[1:08:01] happen in this age
[1:08:05] we in this age that we are living in we
[1:08:08] need to know what is supposed to happen
[1:08:11] says
[1:08:14] I'm not worshiping a Jew
[1:08:19] I worship God when I worship Jesus
[1:08:23] Christ
[1:08:24] Jesus Christ was not a Jew do you
[1:08:27] remember it was God himself in the human
[1:08:30] flesh
[1:08:31] it was the word that was in the
[1:08:34] beginning that was made flesh
[1:08:40] I don't worship some fiction or some
[1:08:42] kind of historic something he says
[1:08:46] I worship Jesus Christ
[1:08:51] the presence of Jesus Christ right now
[1:08:54] which which is me which means
[1:08:59] he which means that his word that's
[1:09:02] manifested in this age
[1:09:09] we have to be sure that we are hearing
[1:09:12] what the messenger is saying about the
[1:09:13] bride for this age
[1:09:17] and all that we have need of is only in
[1:09:20] the message
[1:09:22] the uh people's uh counseling or advice
[1:09:27] religious advice yes
[1:09:29] the advice of men the morality
[1:09:34] all those things are good
[1:09:38] but the life is only in the message of
[1:09:41] the hour
[1:09:46] God in every age is a lot of this word
[1:09:50] from the beginning beginning it took
[1:09:52] further seconds and in every time in
[1:09:55] each one of those ages past
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:00] God sends down an anointed Prophet for
[1:10:03] that age yes
[1:10:10] they're not what we need
[1:10:13] is what comes out of his mouth
[1:10:16] because he's the one who's mandated by
[1:10:19] God
[1:10:22] it says in the days of nowhere and the
[1:10:25] days of the rest of them when he made
[1:10:28] his promises
[1:10:31] [Music]
[1:10:36] I don't care what kind of condition the
[1:10:39] church has gotten into
[1:10:42] God always does that
[1:10:45] he sends an anointed man
[1:10:51] the churches don't want to listen to The
[1:10:53] Prophet anymore
[1:10:56] they go towards popularity
[1:11:00] or they go towards things that capture
[1:11:03] the eyes
[1:11:09] entertainment so they can attract a
[1:11:11] crowd
[1:11:12] um
[1:11:17] God always sends a prophet and they will
[1:11:20] say behold that Saint Jude the Prophet
[1:11:22] Elijah the prophet
[1:11:24] regardless of what's shining to the left
[1:11:27] of the right
[1:11:30] the elected have been warned
[1:11:35] God has showed them what they should
[1:11:37] follow what seasons
[1:11:40] behold I sent you Elijah the prophet
[1:11:44] is the only person
[1:11:46] that would attract the attention of the
[1:11:49] elected
[1:11:51] in in fact
[1:11:53] the word of the the word of the Lord
[1:11:56] comes to the prophet
[1:11:58] prophet and he's and here it stoods it's
[1:12:01] time
[1:12:04] and even though he was condemned by the
[1:12:07] organization
[1:12:11] he stood on the word and made the word
[1:12:14] live
[1:12:17] I want you to understand my brother my
[1:12:19] sister
[1:12:22] do you remember that the word of God
[1:12:24] being God himself
[1:12:27] if this message comes from God
[1:12:30] it's it's life who's living when you
[1:12:34] hear it
[1:12:37] you take it as it was given some member
[1:12:40] who without even you being prayed for
[1:12:44] just
[1:12:45] God can answer to your needs is
[1:12:51] when you received the word
[1:12:54] the word will act
[1:12:56] you will not understand
[1:12:59] why is this one or that live you leave
[1:13:02] you
[1:13:03] the word in action in your life
[1:13:18] but the churches they they create
[1:13:21] confusion
[1:13:26] and that brings a uh an obscurity on
[1:13:29] people and that's where we are
[1:13:31] if you look carefully
[1:13:34] where we come from it's very far but
[1:13:39] where are we going it's very near
[1:13:44] but look at how churches are fighting
[1:13:47] so they can be the first leaders so they
[1:13:51] can have the leadership
[1:13:54] the the the the the Saints are not
[1:13:57] looking for leadership
[1:14:00] the Saints are looking to lift up Jesus
[1:14:03] Christ and to lift up Jesus Christ
[1:14:06] he should lift up the word of the hour
[1:14:10] so that people will only see the word of
[1:14:13] the hour because life is in the word of
[1:14:16] the hour not in me I hope you understand
[1:14:21] secondly
[1:14:23] every Church wants to be the head and
[1:14:26] every Minister
[1:14:29] what he wants to think he's the only one
[1:14:31] who understands the prophet
[1:14:35] or who thinks is Anointed like William
[1:14:38] Branham
[1:14:39] no but William Branham had a special
[1:14:42] anointment
[1:14:45] regardless of what God can do with you
[1:14:48] don't try to equate yourself with the
[1:14:51] prophets there's only one in every age
[1:15:06] that has to be manifested in every
[1:15:09] season those citizens in this season
[1:15:15] we have to hear malachite 4. when you
[1:15:19] talk
[1:15:21] we hear that you are a disciple of
[1:15:24] Malachi and if we have a model the one
[1:15:28] to follow it's malachite foreign
[1:15:40] and try to live the message
[1:15:44] that's what I think
[1:15:46] and then my friends
[1:15:50] it's the only light for this hour
[1:15:55] only the predestinated
[1:15:59] will Manifest this word
[1:16:05] because they always try to hang
[1:16:08] themselves to the the the the word of
[1:16:11] God for the age and it's always the same
[1:16:14] every time
[1:16:15] because the word of God comes to the
[1:16:18] prophets
[1:16:20] every Prophet reveals it to his people
[1:16:24] and his people believe what the prophet
[1:16:27] have said
[1:16:28] then when we stand here
[1:16:31] we are auxiliary or just dress well for
[1:16:35] the party
[1:16:36] a dress word that said have a message
[1:16:41] or to take away from him
[1:16:45] or just to say what the boss said you
[1:16:49] want I hope you understand
[1:16:51] because God is a lot of the message
[1:16:55] and when you follow that message
[1:16:58] you are putting God in action
[1:17:06] in the message Rapture
[1:17:09] paragraph 47
[1:17:11] .
[1:17:14] God allotted his word out of to each age
[1:17:20] and each one of those those ages or
[1:17:24] those age has to manifest that
[1:17:26] second This Is Us do a manifestation
[1:17:29] each of those age has to manifest that
[1:17:33] our desire
[1:17:36] is to become one with the message
[1:17:41] and the message has to be brought to us
[1:17:48] he also for ordained men for that age
[1:17:53] to fulfill that word
[1:17:57] every time he allotted his word
[1:18:01] he allowed the men for it Buddhism not
[1:18:05] to man not two people not three
[1:18:09] we don't have a replacement for William
[1:18:12] Branham
[1:18:14] William Branham is an individual
[1:18:18] they were not eight stars in the hand of
[1:18:21] God there were only seven stars there's
[1:18:25] no replacement
[1:18:27] it's this message that brings us into
[1:18:30] the Rapture
[1:18:32] there is nobody who's supposed to to
[1:18:35] take it off
[1:18:37] we don't believe in things like that
[1:18:40] then my friends
[1:18:43] when when he he went he a lot of the
[1:18:46] Tire Moses
[1:18:48] he allotted Moses to it
[1:18:52] and and when Moses went Jesus
[1:18:57] Joshua didn't have another message
[1:19:02] Joshua was repeating the message of
[1:19:04] Moses every time
[1:19:06] he didn't have anything to add to it
[1:19:09] he didn't put himself forward when Moses
[1:19:13] was speaking
[1:19:15] he was saying what was already said you
[1:19:19] understand
[1:19:23] is to repeat what the prophet said
[1:19:28] don't think by adding is going to have
[1:19:31] more power
[1:19:33] in repeating the prophet
[1:19:35] you give life to people
[1:19:40] foreign
[1:19:43] a lot of the time for the Son of God to
[1:19:46] be born
[1:19:47] he allotted him to it and see then for
[1:19:52] every age
[1:19:54] God being infinite to prison
[1:19:57] all-powerful goodness
[1:20:00] knowing the end before the beginning
[1:20:04] he he allotted man says
[1:20:08] he a lot of men
[1:20:11] there is nothing that will take place
[1:20:15] everything is already perfect
[1:20:18] and everything is working according to
[1:20:21] the plan of God I want you to listen my
[1:20:24] brother
[1:20:30] to in order for him to invite the
[1:20:33] Believers of his time for them not to go
[1:20:35] away from the prophecy
[1:20:38] so they may not miss the prophecy
[1:20:41] the Apostle Paul says this
[1:20:46] first Corinthians 15 uh one to two
[1:20:52] um
[1:20:53] First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1 to
[1:20:57] 2.
[1:21:04] I remember you
[1:21:09] know
[1:21:11] more more of a brighter and seconds
[1:21:17] I declare unto you the gospel which I
[1:21:21] have preached unto you
[1:21:23] which you have also received
[1:21:28] wherein he stands I'll stop right there
[1:21:33] I I record I declare unto you
[1:21:38] the gospel which I have preached unto
[1:21:42] you
[1:21:44] which you have also received is
[1:21:47] and to hear the gospel to receive the
[1:21:51] Gospel it's not the essential
[1:21:54] oh I received the message let's go a
[1:21:58] little further that you have received
[1:22:02] in which you have stand to live stand
[1:22:07] every day of the church
[1:22:09] you don't miss it
[1:22:11] every time when there's a meeting you
[1:22:15] were always there foreign
[1:23:18] that believe this message but in vain
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:46] it says we find the same model in every
[1:23:49] age
[1:23:56] it comes through a messenger
[1:23:58] but because if there's two people if
[1:24:02] there's two ideas
[1:24:04] but God always sends one
[1:24:07] light comes by one man
[1:24:26] the light will spread forth by the
[1:24:30] ministry of those who were faithful
[1:24:33] who were taught by whom faithful and
[1:24:36] taught by who by the Holy Ghost
[1:24:39] it's him our teacher
[1:24:42] when you love the prophet
[1:24:46] you recognize this extraordinary
[1:24:49] Ministry
[1:24:52] you have the desire to hold on to that
[1:24:55] message the sentence will remember and
[1:24:57] the Holy Spirit himself will teach you
[1:24:59] says
[1:25:05] but it's evident that all of those that
[1:25:08] go out they don't always learn
[1:25:14] and they don't always learn how
[1:25:16] important it is to say what the
[1:25:18] messenger said
[1:25:21] that's why my brothers
[1:25:25] let's not condemn people
[1:25:29] it's God who's doing his work
[1:25:33] let's just try to be faithful to God
[1:25:38] because God knows who's who
[1:25:41] your desire is
[1:25:44] to conform yourself to the word
[1:25:51] how how important it is to say what the
[1:25:55] messenger said so whenever remember
[1:26:02] Paul I warned the people to only say
[1:26:06] what he said
[1:26:08] First Corinthians 14 and 37 Secrets
[1:26:12] if someone believes to be a prophet or
[1:26:15] inspired
[1:26:18] that he may recognize that what I'm
[1:26:21] telling you is a commandment from the
[1:26:22] lord
[1:26:27] it's from you that's the word of Lord
[1:26:30] the Lord came to us
[1:26:32] is it only to you that he spoke to you
[1:26:38] they add here
[1:26:40] or they take away here yeah and before
[1:26:44] too long
[1:26:47] message is no longer pure and the
[1:26:50] Revival dies
[1:26:52] that's why people raise up do you want
[1:26:55] disagree God anoint churches
[1:26:59] the true Holy Spirit went anoint them
[1:27:03] and when they see the actions of God
[1:27:07] instead of being humble and lift up the
[1:27:10] God
[1:27:11] Amen people lift up themselves
[1:27:16] and they feel they are important that
[1:27:19] they can lead everybody
[1:27:20] and then the Revival dies
[1:27:28] he has to be the only one that's lifted
[1:27:31] up
[1:27:35] oh how we have to be careful to only
[1:27:38] listen to One voice
[1:27:41] because the spirit only has one voice
[1:27:45] the voice of God
[1:27:49] you are here believing the message
[1:27:55] that I am the voice of God to you
[1:28:29] I take what the voice of God said to
[1:28:32] tell you
[1:28:33] foreign
[1:29:04] [Music]
[1:29:05] to hear the voice of God
[1:29:09] Through The Messengers
[1:29:12] somewhere in question and answer
[1:29:14] something uh January 12 1961 the prophet
[1:29:19] will say
[1:29:21] we are the messenger of the same
[1:29:24] Ministry Minister Believers
[1:29:28] We Are The Messengers of this message
[1:29:33] to bring to the people the testimony of
[1:29:36] the things that God has done
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:43] it's a prophecy
[1:30:06] we have to know what is the prophecy and
[1:30:09] watch with all the uh particular
[1:30:12] attention
[1:30:13] not to deform the prophecies
[1:30:20] let the prophecy be exactly
[1:30:24] if we don't know what the prophecy is
[1:30:32] in all kinds of uh uh trouble and we're
[1:30:36] gonna be uh Carried Away by all kinds of
[1:30:38] window doctrines
[1:30:40] if we don't know what the prophecy is so
[1:30:44] we can watch over
[1:30:48] we can easily be carried away by all
[1:30:51] kinds of doctrines
[1:30:57] all the people that believe that they
[1:31:00] are something because of a certain
[1:31:02] signature they can attract our attention
[1:31:06] if we don't know
[1:31:08] but we know that God spoke in this age
[1:31:14] and that's the only light we have to say
[1:31:17] a lighter path on the road
[1:31:24] my friends
[1:31:27] I Believe In 1980 this message
[1:31:33] I heard and I've seen all kinds of
[1:31:36] things
[1:31:40] movements and all kinds of things
[1:31:43] new doctrines
[1:31:46] New Revelations that were coming forth
[1:31:49] yes
[1:31:53] today you have to say certain words
[1:31:55] otherwise you don't have the right
[1:31:57] Revelations
[1:31:59] I saw all kinds of emotions
[1:32:04] and all kinds of tendencies that conquer
[1:32:07] the whole world may listen but let me
[1:32:10] tell you
[1:32:11] that's a message of William Branham
[1:32:19] is alive the transformation in its work
[1:32:24] of transformation
[1:32:27] when you just speak the message
[1:32:33] as the message is being presented
[1:32:35] without any wrong
[1:32:46] you don't know what work God is doing in
[1:32:48] them
[1:32:49] because the message is God
[1:32:52] this is your Buckle the sentence and
[1:32:55] then I believe the Holy Ghost
[1:32:57] religion we have been I have been given
[1:33:00] to us so we can warn people
[1:33:03] the things that were uh of currently we
[1:33:09] are here to warn you should be actually
[1:33:11] the the things that are currently
[1:33:15] that people are kind of uh uh uh uh
[1:33:19] blind to it
[1:33:25] the Bible says God cannot do anything
[1:33:28] unless he Reveals His secret to the
[1:33:30] servant the
[1:33:31] prophetam says
[1:33:36] Jesus warned the people about what was
[1:33:38] going to happen in this step in this day
[1:33:42] the prophet also warned the people the
[1:33:45] same way
[1:33:48] then it's to our interests right now
[1:33:59] so we can be prepared for the deceitful
[1:34:03] time that we are living in
[1:34:11] and to know what is it that we need to
[1:34:13] turn to
[1:34:15] amenities
[1:34:18] then this little subject let's not miss
[1:34:21] the prophecy attention
[1:34:23] it's a subject that seems a little bit
[1:34:25] uh unusual
[1:34:28] that we have probably spoken on many
[1:34:31] times
[1:34:32] but I believe I feel in my heart because
[1:34:34] they want to speak every year that I
[1:34:37] want to keep your spirit awake
[1:34:40] to the deceitfulness that's reigning
[1:34:45] foreign
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:23] and this message alone is enough
[1:35:30] we we should only we only have to be
[1:35:34] happy with malachite on itself
[1:35:37] malachite for itself
[1:35:39] that's Christ
[1:35:42] this message is Christ
[1:35:46] there's a lot of Messengers today
[1:35:51] they have a lot of subject and and ideas
[1:35:55] to develop and present to people
[1:35:58] The Pride doesn't need all of that
[1:36:02] the bride is growing in in the light in
[1:36:06] the sunlight
[1:36:08] we are living in a very deceitful age
[1:36:13] where the the false and the truth seems
[1:36:16] to be so close
[1:36:18] but Jesus says that the two Spirits
[1:36:22] they'll be so close
[1:36:25] but they will deceive they're very enact
[1:36:27] if it was possible
[1:36:29] even uh
[1:36:39] I want to go by
[1:36:41] e
[1:36:43] sharks I want to buy sharks for my car
[1:36:46] live under representative uh the the
[1:36:49] seller is presenting me three pieces
[1:36:53] looking identical
[1:36:56] it is
[1:36:58] this this one is 300 000.
[1:37:02] this is a little bit higher it's 450
[1:37:05] it's uh
[1:37:07] and this one is 700.
[1:37:10] which one are you taking
[1:37:14] I asked why different prices
[1:37:17] they look the same
[1:37:19] it looks the same it's the same but it's
[1:37:23] not the same
[1:37:24] this is the first quality this is the
[1:37:27] second quality
[1:37:30] and that's the third quality
[1:37:32] which one do you want
[1:37:34] developer I want the First Quality
[1:37:37] and the First Quality is
[1:37:43] not what the preacher said
[1:37:46] not the opinion of man the first
[1:37:49] question is what William Branham said
[1:37:53] it's not popular
[1:37:56] it doesn't do so people will clap for
[1:37:59] you but it's the truth
[1:38:03] you understand
[1:38:06] Matthew 24.
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:31] because people like to see those things
[1:38:36] how many saw it at Israel coming out of
[1:38:40] Egypt
[1:38:42] but how many entered
[1:38:45] though
[1:38:47] let's look at the essentials what is
[1:38:51] what is it is what God Said
[1:39:07] the people listen to the multitude
[1:39:11] but God told them I have given you the
[1:39:15] country this message it's our
[1:39:18] inheritance don't look at anything else
[1:39:36] in Matthew 25 the Lord adds and says
[1:39:43] behold I wanted to to let you know in
[1:39:46] advance
[1:39:51] I want you to know that I I to announce
[1:39:54] to you the characteristics of the age
[1:39:56] that we are living in
[1:39:57] this day that we are living in La
[1:40:01] prolification
[1:40:04] the multiplication of the false Christ
[1:40:07] and false prophet
[1:40:09] don't worry
[1:40:12] they are anointed of the of the true
[1:40:15] Holy Ghost
[1:40:25] they are anointed of the true and
[1:40:28] authentic Holy Ghost and she still
[1:40:30] offended Thomas it's the end time now
[1:40:35] how many times we have left I don't know
[1:40:40] but it was it was told to us by the Lord
[1:40:43] by the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:47] when we see the things that we are
[1:40:49] seeing at this time
[1:40:52] know that our Redemption is near
[1:40:55] we have to lift up our heads
[1:40:58] now I read to you the prophet in the
[1:41:01] anointed one in the end time paragraph
[1:41:04] 22.
[1:41:05] I really get into my message now
[1:41:10] now
[1:41:15] seeing all of this accumulation of
[1:41:17] evidence
[1:41:20] that's the hour that we we now live in
[1:41:23] Japan
[1:41:28] I think it's a good thing to rehearse
[1:41:31] these things and to draw them out
[1:41:36] since the seals have been opened it
[1:41:40] issues and find the truth of these
[1:41:43] things
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:48] as God has been so loyal to us with its
[1:41:52] Grace to show us these things
[1:41:56] I want you to notice here in Matthew 24
[1:42:00] the Christian Jesus used the term Christ
[1:42:04] Christ
[1:42:05] the Christian
[1:42:08] Christ plural not Christ
[1:42:14] not singular
[1:42:17] you divorce me you're going forward okay
[1:42:25] see one
[1:42:28] but Christ not Christ or plural but
[1:42:32] Christ plural purposely not singular
[1:42:36] decreased Christ
[1:42:40] the word Christ means anointed
[1:42:44] it's talking about anointed
[1:42:49] there will not be one may please
[1:42:52] one they anointed
[1:42:56] all the men of God are they not anointed
[1:43:00] foreign
[1:43:15] if he wants to break it down so we would
[1:43:18] more or less understand it better
[1:43:23] the full one he would say in the last
[1:43:26] day they shall be they shall rise false
[1:43:28] anointed ones can possible now that
[1:43:32] seems almost impossible
[1:43:35] the terms anointed
[1:43:40] but notice the very next words
[1:43:43] the full Prophet prophet and false
[1:43:47] prophet Prophet plural
[1:43:50] now
[1:43:54] anointed one is one with a message
[1:44:00] and the only way the message could be
[1:44:03] brought out
[1:44:06] is by one that's anointed one that would
[1:44:10] be a prophet is
[1:44:15] they shall rise false anointed
[1:44:21] and Prophet um
[1:44:24] anointed anointed teacher
[1:44:28] false prophet anointed false teaching
[1:44:32] no what is it and Prophet I'm saying so
[1:44:36] message a prophet teaches his message
[1:44:40] anointed teachers
[1:44:47] the people that are anointed having
[1:44:50] false teaching this one decrease
[1:44:54] anointed one or anointed plural
[1:45:05] and if Christ in singular exists
[1:45:15] [Music]
[1:45:17] and that will be the prophecy and it's
[1:45:21] the teaching that will make the
[1:45:23] difference I'll go back
[1:45:26] and if the Christ will simply exist in
[1:45:30] singular exists is that true
[1:45:33] it's for him that we are here still
[1:45:36] exist if he exists
[1:45:40] then there would be anointed yes
[1:45:46] that they were teaching that would make
[1:45:49] a difference
[1:45:53] because they are anointed once anointed
[1:45:58] prophecy I told you this message is a
[1:46:01] prophecy the message
[1:46:03] of the end time is a prophecy
[1:46:08] it's their teaching on the prophecy that
[1:46:12] makes the difference
[1:46:14] the prophet that gives the
[1:46:17] prophecyte
[1:46:19] he is calling for faithfulness to what
[1:46:23] he said
[1:46:25] he says I am responsible for this
[1:46:28] message
[1:46:29] it's only say what I'm saying
[1:46:33] it's not me
[1:46:35] but it's him that is saying everyone and
[1:46:39] I believe they're true I know you had
[1:46:40] once from this they have to understand
[1:46:43] that language
[1:46:46] because the difference between the true
[1:46:48] and the false
[1:46:52] it's the teaching on the prophecy which
[1:46:55] is this message
[1:46:59] now Jesus said that the rain shall fall
[1:47:03] on the just and the unjustice is that
[1:47:05] true
[1:47:07] now someone can tell me
[1:47:14] do you believe that the anointing that
[1:47:17] on on these people is the true anointing
[1:47:21] yes this is where it becomes complicated
[1:47:45] it says certainly the true anointing of
[1:47:49] the Holy Spirit on the person but the
[1:47:51] Ben is false
[1:47:58] that's why you don't follow the signs or
[1:48:00] the the things oh come follow me I'm
[1:48:03] this I'm dead
[1:48:07] the message being a prophecy follow the
[1:48:10] message
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:14] even Jesus was not advertising of
[1:48:18] himself like that
[1:48:20] didn't do that
[1:48:22] they they remain humble
[1:48:31] [Applause]
[1:48:34] be careful with that
[1:48:38] now listen carefully
[1:48:41] so we can understand what he said
[1:48:45] and they will do signs and wonders
[1:48:51] in so much that they will deceive the
[1:48:54] very elective were possible he so when
[1:48:57] you sent this sentence they are anointed
[1:49:00] with a genuine Holy Ghost holy spirit
[1:49:04] says
[1:49:06] no I know this sounds very uh foolish
[1:49:12] but I'm going to take time to explain it
[1:49:15] by the word because
[1:49:18] that that's absolutely that say of the
[1:49:21] Lord
[1:49:22] now look at my brother look fit the
[1:49:25] world Listen the the fact that you have
[1:49:28] signs
[1:49:30] it doesn't make you a man of God but a
[1:49:34] man of God
[1:49:36] has to have signs
[1:49:39] you believe that
[1:49:42] let's be uh balance
[1:49:51] will follow
[1:49:54] but it's not the main thing
[1:50:08] now it's also the answer to Matthew
[1:50:13] um
[1:50:14] Matthew 7
[1:50:16] 21-23 Equity lessons
[1:50:22] those that say Lord Lord they shall not
[1:50:26] enter into the kingdom of God
[1:50:30] but only those that will do the will of
[1:50:33] my father who's in heaven
[1:50:36] many will say to me on that day
[1:50:39] Lord Lord
[1:50:42] if we not prophesy by thy name in
[1:50:46] Prophecy correct
[1:50:48] a correct prophecy that's come to pass
[1:51:07] they were healed in a very evident way
[1:51:11] but is that the main thing
[1:51:32] Jesus never denied that they could do
[1:51:35] signs and wonders that can only be done
[1:51:37] by the Holy Ghost
[1:51:39] it's the Holy Ghost working in them
[1:51:43] and Jesus Christ is recognizing that's
[1:51:46] the Holy Ghost but it says
[1:51:49] but he never knew them
[1:51:52] they were not backsliders
[1:52:01] not born again reproving oh yeah
[1:52:09] they were the seed of the devil
[1:52:14] but manifesting the power of God
[1:52:19] and that's
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:23] we cannot pretend color manifestation
[1:52:29] manifestation is the proof that we are
[1:52:32] born of the spirit
[1:52:34] you see why people are being led
[1:52:37] uh deceived
[1:52:42] so many signs where the elect will be
[1:52:45] deceived if it were possible
[1:53:29] even if that one individual has
[1:53:31] manifestation in abundance
[1:53:42] it's not really getting you away from
[1:53:45] the emotions
[1:53:48] the proof that we have received the Holy
[1:53:51] Ghost today
[1:53:54] it's exactly the same as it was in the
[1:53:57] days of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:02] is to receive the word the truth of the
[1:54:05] age that you are living in is it and
[1:54:08] this word
[1:54:10] it will not lift you up above others
[1:54:13] this word
[1:54:17] a man who's trying to Reign Over the
[1:54:20] Earth
[1:54:21] this word will make you one of them's
[1:54:25] friends we are all Brothers we are all
[1:54:28] walking together
[1:54:29] under the same Block
[1:54:31] it's not one who's above
[1:54:34] we are all equal to uh in in in front of
[1:54:39] the word
[1:54:40] all saved by grace
[1:54:48] we are all the same
[1:54:53] excuse me excuse me
[1:54:58] okay
[1:55:04] that we have received the Holy ghosts
[1:55:09] it's the same as it was in the days of
[1:55:11] the Lord Jesus
[1:55:15] is to receive the word of Truth for the
[1:55:18] age that you are living in
[1:55:19] [Music]
[1:55:22] Portland
[1:55:24] Jesus has never insisted so much on the
[1:55:27] importance of works
[1:55:30] but rather the importance of the word
[1:55:33] listen
[1:55:37] he knew that if people will receive the
[1:55:40] word
[1:55:42] signs will follow that's the Bible
[1:55:47] I have a lot of testimonies
[1:56:26] just a word
[1:56:56] that's not it
[1:56:58] just the word
[1:57:01] it's not by strength
[1:57:14] God is Not Enough
[1:57:17] God is in his word
[1:57:19] [Music]
[1:57:21] my brother my sister
[1:57:25] don't put your don't put the accent or
[1:57:28] the the the the uh
[1:57:31] on the signs and the the Wonders
[1:57:35] put the accent on the message
[1:57:39] that is God himself the word
[1:57:42] receive all the words
[1:57:45] give him the first place
[1:57:48] and then you will receive the power of
[1:57:51] God in you
[1:58:21] and I believe God is here
[1:58:27] anointed one in the end time
[1:58:30] it says now
[1:58:32] um
[1:58:36] we're gonna take our time to understand
[1:58:39] a fundamental reality
[1:58:45] because I'm here addressing something
[1:58:48] that is seems uh unusual Commando
[1:58:52] sentence people
[1:58:54] how can the Holy Ghost anoint a false
[1:58:57] teacher
[1:59:00] you understand
[1:59:09] that's what Jesus said will come to pass
[1:59:12] uh
[1:59:17] now compare with Matthew 4 and 25 and 24
[1:59:21] 5 and 24 again
[1:59:27] Jesus said that the rain and the Sun
[1:59:30] come upon the Earth
[1:59:35] that God sends it to prepare the food
[1:59:38] and the things for the people of the
[1:59:41] earth
[1:59:45] and the rain is sent for the food the
[1:59:49] herbs
[1:59:50] [Music]
[1:59:56] but the tears the wheat being in the
[1:59:59] field receive the same thing
[2:00:08] the same rain that makes the wind to
[2:00:11] grow the same rain makes the wheat to
[2:00:13] grow
[2:00:14] how much
[2:00:40] and
[2:00:43] it was the truth
[2:01:32] so if you only look at the size of the
[2:01:35] church
[2:01:38] the movement of that looks to seem to be
[2:01:41] in the church
[2:01:43] or the prophecy or the speaking
[2:01:51] look at the
[2:01:55] life of the message
[2:02:00] that's when someone who gives himself to
[2:02:02] God can see
[2:02:06] uh amazed when he saw that he says
[2:02:11] paragraph 36.
[2:02:14] foreign
[2:02:26] now therefore the rain dropping down
[2:02:30] upon the natural vegetation of the earth
[2:02:32] is the same type of the spirit rain
[2:02:34] which which uh which the spiritual Reign
[2:02:38] which give
[2:03:05] of God's spirit upon this church notice
[2:03:10] it's very strange thing here
[2:03:14] when them seeds went into the ground it
[2:03:17] says
[2:03:18] however they got there
[2:03:27] the rain that fall upon them only
[2:03:30] revealed the nature that was in them
[2:03:33] and in the Earth
[2:03:35] the wheat is
[2:03:39] there were wheat and weed
[2:03:42] there was the weed the wheat little pin
[2:03:48] I'm trying to find
[2:03:51] there were wheat
[2:03:57] he available
[2:04:00] in the ground
[2:04:02] when the seed Falls there were the wheat
[2:04:06] there were uh tones
[2:04:09] they were herbs
[2:04:12] they were there to begin with
[2:04:16] and every herbs
[2:04:18] in reproducing himself
[2:04:23] original showed what it was in the
[2:04:27] beginning in the original
[2:04:29] in other words
[2:04:34] every seed is what the Creator decided
[2:04:39] in the original
[2:04:41] if you are weed tonight
[2:04:46] you don't have to connect the the the
[2:04:49] turn
[2:04:51] it's the maker or the Creator who
[2:04:54] decided that is
[2:04:57] let's just remain in our camp and lift
[2:05:00] up Jesus Christ
[2:05:04] every seed is what the Creator decided
[2:05:07] from the beginning
[2:05:09] and when you realize
[2:05:14] don't look it to the left and right so
[2:05:16] you can advertise yourself
[2:05:20] you didn't do anything for you to become
[2:05:22] weak just glorify them oh thank you God
[2:05:27] thank you foreign
[2:05:41] and they will deceive the elect if we
[2:05:44] were possible
[2:05:50] because they are getting the same reign
[2:05:53] s
[2:05:54] same blessing foreign
[2:05:58] [Music]
[2:06:04] [Music]
[2:06:09] [Applause]
[2:06:14] now a torn
[2:06:16] neport
[2:06:19] cannot help being a torn
[2:06:23] neither neither can the wheat
[2:06:28] that's what the Creator each determined
[2:06:31] at the beginning that's the elect
[2:06:36] they elect they have the the eyes
[2:06:39] looking at the one who elected them they
[2:06:42] don't have to the Rejoice
[2:06:45] because you didn't do anything to become
[2:06:48] an elasticity it's God who chose you
[2:06:51] hear me
[2:06:57] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:07:00] and to testify of his good be doing
[2:07:05] because remember we're at the at the we
[2:07:08] are looking for the last election
[2:07:11] because maybe it's your testimony that
[2:07:14] will bring forth the last one
[2:07:23] we are living by dead substance
[2:07:28] that's the only way we can live
[2:07:44] then isn't it true that if your body has
[2:07:46] to live by that substance for the
[2:07:49] natural life
[2:07:53] then then someone's Gotta Die the holy
[2:07:56] spirit in the spiritual world
[2:07:58] to save your spiritual life
[2:08:02] and God became material
[2:08:06] God became material flesh
[2:08:10] and he died
[2:08:14] there's no church there's no other
[2:08:17] things in the world
[2:08:20] can save you but God shows that's the
[2:08:25] only thing that that they live by what
[2:08:29] things the word of the hour
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:27] hold ourselves to this message
[2:09:31] foreign
[2:09:38] [Music]
[2:09:53] [Music]
[2:10:11] [Music]
[2:10:38] [Applause]
[2:11:09] expose yourself to the sun which is the
[2:11:12] message
[2:11:14] as long as you expose yourself to the
[2:11:16] message you become the right until the
[2:11:20] maturity
[2:11:24] we have to find God's way of doing
[2:11:27] things
[2:11:28] and we have to hold on to God's way of
[2:11:31] doing things
[2:11:49] let God reveal himself to the people
[2:11:54] don't incite them to be baptized by
[2:11:57] foreign
[2:12:26] um
[2:12:31] though your Harvest will be great
[2:13:13] so you are you are facing the message
[2:13:16] and you are living the message yourself
[2:13:20] and we can't present anything else
[2:13:22] outside of the message
[2:13:26] so we have to uh dig the Earth
[2:13:29] everywhere
[2:13:32] we have to dig the Earth everywhere so
[2:13:35] we can only uh we can we can bury only
[2:13:38] the seed
[2:13:40] because because it's already later than
[2:13:43] we think
[2:13:45] there's no time to work again
[2:13:48] let's let's uh uh show the message
[2:13:55] so let's tell the Earth and and let's
[2:13:58] show the message
[2:14:00] because if you are not sowing the
[2:14:02] message there's not going to be a
[2:14:05] harvest so you have to sow in order for
[2:14:08] you to wait for the Harvest now as we
[2:14:11] are gathered here
[2:14:15] we have to think on these things before
[2:14:17] it's too late
[2:15:10] I think people are no longer I have a
[2:15:14] Zeal to bring the message to the world
[2:15:19] people are no longer testifying to the
[2:15:22] people that they meet that God sent the
[2:15:24] prophets
[2:15:27] people are no longer talking to the
[2:15:29] world and telling them that the the time
[2:15:31] the time is at end
[2:15:36] let's not be ashamed to to Proclaim or
[2:15:40] to testify of the goal of this message
[2:15:43] it was told to the prophet when he was
[2:15:46] baptizing
[2:15:48] Baptist that as John the Baptist
[2:15:51] was sent to to prepare the first coming
[2:15:54] to massage your message
[2:16:00] the second coming of the lord we are in
[2:16:04] the message
[2:16:06] so we can tell the world that Jesus is
[2:16:09] coming soon
[2:16:11] everything will change soon
[2:16:14] we're going to disappear celebrity
[2:16:16] that's the truth
[2:16:26] [Music]
[2:16:29] the message of the hour day and night
[2:16:32] then
[2:17:14] [Music]
[2:17:35] is far away from all the the compromises
[2:17:40] lately they pushed the Christians the
[2:17:42] church uh bride of Christ
[2:17:46] will Proclaim every promise to be the
[2:17:48] truth and I believe we are at the end
[2:17:51] time
[2:17:53] and as the time comes closer
[2:17:56] the head is coming down
[2:18:01] until the head and the body become one
[2:18:05] because he's our husband and we are his
[2:18:08] wife
[2:18:10] they are one they don't look at the
[2:18:13] figures and in the in the case of some
[2:18:16] we are flesh of his flesh word of his
[2:18:20] words life of his life Spirit of his
[2:18:24] spirit
[2:18:25] and to eat of the word
[2:18:28] without understanding
[2:18:32] life will reflect the Life of Christ
[2:18:35] let's bow ahead if we could stand
[2:18:41] semester my brother my sister
[2:18:45] let's not miss the prophecy
[2:18:49] there's a lot of things to say on that
[2:18:52] this is I went a little bit fast
[2:18:56] because I didn't have my watch to watch
[2:18:58] to to follow I don't want to I don't
[2:19:00] want to go past the time
[2:19:03] God and His word is one and the same
[2:19:06] thing

[2:19:32] is in him

[2:19:50] [Music]
[2:20:14] just continue to to drink and to grow
[2:20:18] that's what you have to do because this

[2:20:30] and everything that you have need of
[2:20:33] says

[2:22:12] the seed of all is in the word
[2:22:15] a problem
[2:22:17] familiar then it may be a family problem

[2:22:45] seed is growing

[2:22:51] alone you just water it
[2:22:55] what are the seed that's in your heart

[2:24:06] that we may have confidence in the
[2:24:08] message of the messenger
[2:24:37] [Music]
[2:24:40] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[2:24:44] [Music]
[2:24:46] [Applause]

[2:24:54] thank you
[2:24:55] [Music]
[2:25:00] Lord God bless you
[2:25:02] you know you know the importance of
[2:25:04] Revelation if you know his voice you
[2:25:08] don't listen look for another
[2:25:10] my sheep know my voice and another they
[2:25:15] won't follow
[2:25:16] if you have an absolute
[2:25:19] that's what settles it that's the
[2:25:22] problem today people don't have a
[2:25:24] revelation of The Voice
[2:25:26] they don't have a revelation of
[2:25:28] what the message is and who brought it
[2:25:32] and how it was brought
[2:25:34] so they heat to themselves having
[2:25:36] itching years many teachers
[2:25:39] never coming to the realization of the
[2:25:43] truth aren't you glad that you've got
[2:25:45] that Revelation in your heart
[2:25:48] that you know his voice amen and you
[2:25:51] know you're convinced and then you're
[2:25:54] concerned if you're not convinced then
[2:25:57] you're always
[2:25:59] looking
[2:26:00] but once you've come into your heart
[2:26:02] it's wonderful amen we have a baptism
[2:26:05] this morning brother Paul's daughters
[2:26:07] going to be baptized in brother Paul a
[2:26:11] few times go get ready at this time and
[2:26:14] that will have that baptism any of us
[2:26:17] that might have to leave feel free to go
[2:26:21] at this time and we'll just trust that
[2:26:24] the Lord will bless you so let us bow
[2:26:28] our heads this morning as we prepare for
[2:26:30] the baptism and
[2:26:34] your heart
[2:26:38] you've heard a
[2:26:40] straightforward word this morning
[2:26:44] and that's the question
[2:26:46] who are you following
[2:26:49] who are you listening to what leads you
[2:26:53] are you convinced this morning
[2:26:56] are you concerned have you
[2:26:59] put your anchor in the Rock and
[2:27:03] beyond a shadow of a doubt you know what
[2:27:06] your path is
[2:27:08] and if that settled in your heart you
[2:27:11] don't go to the left you don't go to the
[2:27:13] right
[2:27:14] I've heard his voice
[2:27:18] I'm not going to follow a stranger
[2:27:20] our gracious Heavenly Father
[2:27:26] I'm sure each of us as our brother
[2:27:29] brought out we're all different
[2:27:32] we're all individual
[2:27:34] and we appreciate that father because
[2:27:36] then we all know we can have our own
[2:27:39] individual affairs

[2:27:49] or that you spoke to us the time that
[2:27:52] you moved upon our heart the time that
[2:27:55] we heard your voice and it was quickened
[2:27:59] in our spirit that this is your voice
[2:28:02] this is your word this is the path I'm
[2:28:06] going to take
[2:28:07] Lord and it's the children of Israel we
[2:28:13] take heed from the lesson that they gave
[2:28:16] us
[2:28:18] they got tired of the Mana they used
[2:28:21] supplied
[2:28:23] and they longed for a different taste a
[2:28:26] different flavor a different move
[2:28:30] but that movement never brought them to
[2:28:32] the promised land
[2:28:36] the two that stuck with it
[2:28:38] all the way through
[2:28:40] were the ones that made it
[2:28:43] father may we like Joshua and Caleb take
[2:28:46] the unadulterated word
[2:28:49] not vary from it at all but stay ever
[2:28:52] true
[2:28:53] we ask that you'd grant that to us
[2:28:55] father May that Revelation come in our
[2:28:58] heart
[2:28:59] that this wesage in this word
[2:29:02] is never failing never ending and all
[2:29:06] fulfilling we trust it with all our
[2:29:09] hearts and Jesus precious and holy name
[2:29:13] we pray amen God bless you as we go to
