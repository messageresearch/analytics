[34:01] even when we're certain God's grace is
[34:05] all we've got
[34:07] even when we tell ourselves it isn't up
[34:12] to us
[34:13] sometimes it's hard to trust that he
[34:17] says we could come like little children
[34:21] for we are his children
[34:24] and we are free
[34:28] but do we know it
[34:31] we are loved but can we feel it for

[34:55] for the past is broken the cross has
[35:00] spoken

[42:08] as we're still standing
[42:11] all right let's take our Bibles
[42:16] in the Book of Matthew
[42:26] Matthew chapter 16.
[42:30] moving
[42:31] [Music]
[42:34] we'll read verse 13 through
[42:38] 18.
[42:40] yeah it's a scripture very familiar
[42:43] scripture reading
[42:48] I will try to read and directly in
[42:51] English
[42:53] when Jesus came into the cost of cesari
[42:57] Philippi he asking interesting for
[43:01] saying
[43:02] whom do men say that I the son of man
[43:06] harm
[43:07] and they say some say that thou art John
[43:11] the Baptist some Elias and others
[43:14] Jeremiah are one of the prophets
[43:17] he said unto them
[43:19] but to whom say that I am and Simon
[43:24] Peter answered and said Thou Art
[43:28] requires the son of the Living God
[43:31] and Jesus asked me and said unto him
[43:35] please add out some bad Jonah for Flesh
[43:40] and Blood have not revealed it unto thee
[43:43] but my Father which is in heaven and I
[43:47] think also unto thee that there are
[43:49] Peter and happened to the work I will
[43:52] breed my church and the gates of it
[43:56] shall not Prevail against it and I will
[44:00] give unto thee the key of the Kingdom of
[44:03] Heaven
[44:05] and whatever you thou should bind on the
[44:09] earth I shall Bound in heaven and
[44:12] whatever thou shall lose on Earth I
[44:16] shall be lost in heaven
[44:22] let's turn over to Second Timothy
[44:25] chapter three
[44:35] notation the second Timothy chapter
[44:40] three
[44:42] first starting from verse one
[44:47] do you know also that in the last days
[44:50] very last time should come
[44:53] for me shall be lovers of their own self
[44:57] cover truth booster power proud
[45:03] females disobedient to parents and
[45:07] thankful
[45:09] and holy
[45:11] without natural affection
[45:15] truth Breakers first accuses incontinent
[45:19] faith
[45:21] that spices and those that are good
[45:26] three two
[45:29] Edmonds love is a pleasure more than
[45:32] lovers of God
[45:34] having a form of goodness
[45:38] but denied the power you know such turn
[45:42] away
[45:45] Lord Jesus we read your word
[45:49] may you help us find a context
[45:53] to say something from you that would
[45:56] help us
[45:58] bless your name tonight in the name of
[46:01] Jesus Christ amen amen
[46:08] I believe we are happy to be in the
[46:11] house of God tonight
[46:14] it's always a privilege to be in the
[46:16] house of God
[46:19] [Music]
[46:20] because he promised that when We Gather
[46:23] in his name that is always there
[46:26] and when he's there
[46:30] he cannot let us go back the same way we
[46:33] came in
[46:36] because he said his word is like rain
[46:40] that it wouldn't fall and go back
[46:44] without giving forth blessings
[46:49] and I believe every time we come in the
[46:52] house of God
[46:53] he's there to give us something
[46:58] tonight the Lord is placed on my heart
[47:01] a little subjects
[47:06] what makes the strength of a believer
[47:11] [Music]
[47:12] la vie
[47:15] we because we know the life is a battle
[47:20] and said when we become Christians
[47:24] we enter into a battle
[47:30] and we have to be fortified
[47:34] we have to have something that makes our
[47:36] strength
[47:38] to continue to fight so we could go
[47:42] forth
[47:48] the Bible is describing the time that we
[47:52] are living in
[47:54] it said that in the end time
[47:58] the men will become cruel
[48:01] and now we see that today
[48:05] the cruelty of man has really been
[48:07] lifted up
[48:10] and someone could be uh someone you
[48:14] could see someone being killed
[48:17] instead of people helping it
[48:21] and there will be those standing there
[48:23] with the taking pictures so they can
[48:25] send it out
[48:28] people have lost the loyalty
[48:32] foreign
[48:36] criticizing okay
[48:41] they love the pleasure more than God
[48:46] and as we read in this scripture
[48:54] the Bible is not specifically just
[48:58] describing the unbeliever
[49:01] because in this scripture
[49:06] the Bible is describing all of it all
[49:10] the people in the end times
[49:24] it means there are people that look like
[49:27] Christians
[49:30] they have the appearance of Christians
[49:33] they go to church
[49:35] they they worship God
[49:39] they invoke or they call upon the name
[49:41] of the Lord
[49:44] the scripture says having the form of
[49:47] godliness
[49:49] by denying the very power thereofs
[49:54] it seems like it has to be something
[49:57] that constitutes the strength
[50:01] that these people whether they that are
[50:04] called themselves Christians
[50:06] [Music]
[50:07] even though they have the form of
[50:09] godliness
[50:13] they deny what makes the strength of a
[50:16] Believer
[50:19] they deny what makes a Christian
[50:25] and that is what they completely
[50:27] describe the time under which we are
[50:29] living
[50:33] the ages the church ages
[50:37] the last Sage is the age of laodicea
[50:43] so on one side we have people
[50:47] they they have no loyalty they are
[50:50] criminals they are untenable they are
[50:55] not religious
[50:56] condition
[51:05] they have the appearance of Holiness
[51:09] but they deny what makes the strength
[51:13] says
[51:15] in a crisis revealing his own word
[51:20] paragraph 159. he says
[51:29] in the age of laodicea
[51:32] the people were
[51:40] [Music]
[51:50] if a blindly the blind don't they all
[51:54] fall into a ditch
[51:55] naked blind
[51:58] and don't know it is
[52:01] [Music]
[52:04] even the mental uh uh faculties are gone
[52:10] the spiritual faculties of mental
[52:15] spiritual understanding
[52:22] high-minded a mother please could you
[52:26] lovers of pleasure more than a lot more
[52:28] than love of God
[52:30] uh truce Breakers
[52:32] false accusers
[52:42] having a form of godliness
[52:47] but denying the power thereof
[52:51] the power of Revelation
[52:57] strength
[53:02] the people have denied
[53:07] the power of Revelation
[53:11] they don't even believe in it forever
[53:14] see the prophet they don't believe in
[53:18] such thing as a prophet
[53:20] and it says they don't
[53:22] [Music]
[53:27] they don't believe in it they believe
[53:29] that malachite 4 is a certain church or
[53:32] a certain organization
[53:38] I read this I thought about someone with
[53:40] whom I was talking with uh uh last week
[53:50] I was talking to a couple I was
[53:53] presenting to them the message of
[53:54] William Branham
[53:58] to showing them that the Bible has shown
[54:01] a saying that in the end time in this
[54:03] time
[54:07] that's the only way to escape through
[54:09] the fire that's going to burn the Earth
[54:13] is to receive Elijah the prophet
[54:18] because he said behold I'll send you
[54:20] Elijah the prophet is
[54:24] they look to be to have been convinced
[54:29] and a week later he came to see me
[54:32] he said he came back from his church
[54:36] I I asked him did you already find your
[54:39] Elijah
[54:42] it says oh we talked about it at church
[54:46] they told us that the Bible says
[54:50] that Elijah was a man of same nature as
[54:53] us
[54:55] so that means we don't have to wait for
[54:57] another Elijah
[54:59] because he was of the same nature
[55:02] so we are like Elijah
[55:06] and that's what brother Branham said
[55:09] he says they believe that malachite
[55:12] is a certain church
[55:15] or a certain organization
[55:18] when he came the first time
[55:21] he was a man
[55:24] when he came the second time with a
[55:27] double portion he was a man
[55:31] when he came in the form of John the
[55:34] Baptist he was a man you see in the last
[55:39] days
[55:41] when the evening time began to shine
[55:45] eyes will open
[55:48] and you will see where you are going
[55:51] [Music]
[55:53] then the body is already formed
[55:57] standing up
[55:59] taking motion
[56:02] moving move by the Holy by your Holy
[56:05] Spirit
[56:08] they're saying one that moved upon the
[56:11] prophet that wrote the Bible
[56:13] [Music]
[56:16] the same holy ghost moving in a body
[56:19] filled with the Holy Ghost
[56:27] in the Holy Ghost out of every
[56:30] organization
[56:31] every Kindred
[56:34] tongue
[56:35] and people
[56:51] to access the revelation
[56:56] that's what Jesus did with Peter God
[57:01] when he asked him what do
[57:03] whatever I am perfect
[57:06] everyone can answer according to what
[57:09] everybody has said
[57:11] all they say that you are Jeremiah or
[57:14] that you are one of the prophets that
[57:17] you are there
[57:18] sometimes we come to church
[57:21] we have the revelation of the pastor
[57:25] we have the revelation of our husbands
[57:29] the revelation of our wife
[57:34] but when you have talked about the
[57:36] revelation of the others
[57:39] Jesus will turn to you
[57:42] as he turned towards the disciples
[57:46] he said that is what others says of me
[57:51] that's what the pastor said about me but
[57:55] you
[57:56] why do you say that I am
[58:01] what do you say that I am
[58:09] because Jesus was looking for a personal
[58:12] revelation
[58:15] [Music]
[58:22] we saw that as the sons of cephas they
[58:25] went out they wanted to cast out devils
[58:28] in the name of the Jesus that uh Paul
[58:32] was preaching
[58:33] but what did the demon said unto them
[58:36] I know Paul
[58:38] I know Jesus but you who are you
[59:01] as long as they didn't have their own
[59:03] personal revelation
[59:06] the revelation of who Jesus was
[59:08] personally
[59:18] that if we want to have strength
[59:20] we have to read the word we have to pray
[59:25] but when we read the word
[59:29] it's the simple lecture of the Bible
[59:33] will that give us our revelation will I
[59:36] give us the strength when we pray
[59:39] if we don't know to whom we are dressing
[59:43] too
[59:47] if we don't have the personal revelation
[59:50] of who we are talking to
[59:53] how can we have the strength
[1:00:08] extracted from a personal revelation it
[1:00:12] means when we come to church
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:22] the gift to try to connect you with
[1:00:25] Christ
[1:00:28] the pastor is not trying to connect you
[1:00:31] to the church
[1:00:33] he's not trying to connect you to his
[1:00:35] own church
[1:00:37] but he's trying to connect you to Christ
[1:00:42] so that each one will have a personal
[1:00:45] revelation
[1:00:46] so each one will have a personal contact
[1:00:50] with Christ
[1:00:54] when we have the personal revelation
[1:00:57] that we will understand
[1:01:00] that regardless of whether we're in the
[1:01:03] valley
[1:01:03] that will be on the Mountaintop
[1:01:07] same God who reveal himself to you
[1:01:11] will remain faithful
[1:01:43] the greatest power that ever was in the
[1:01:45] world
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:47] and to take him and put him behind a
[1:01:50] little ship behind in in the wilderness
[1:01:55] sheeps
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:02:01] he took him from the throne
[1:02:04] to take him in the wilderness
[1:02:07] the same God
[1:02:12] we got whether be in the valley
[1:02:16] could be on the Mountaintop
[1:02:18] he Remains the Same God
[1:02:24] [Music]
[1:02:29] regardless of the difficulties
[1:02:32] regardless of the problems
[1:02:34] regardless of of failures
[1:02:38] he Remains the Same God
[1:02:41] and you will know
[1:02:43] that the same way
[1:02:46] Moses
[1:02:48] that he took him in the world and asked
[1:02:50] for 40 years
[1:02:55] at the point where he forgotten how to
[1:02:58] talk
[1:03:01] because all his time was with the the
[1:03:04] ship
[1:03:06] behind the Sheep boys
[1:03:09] Moses the the the Commandment of Egypt
[1:03:13] he became a sheep for 40 years
[1:03:18] but God didn't forget him
[1:03:21] because he had a mission for him
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:28] that he had a mission for his people
[1:03:32] sometimes the problem God reveals us
[1:03:35] something we want to go before God
[1:03:39] we want to go before the time of God
[1:03:42] that's what happens with Moses
[1:03:45] but God is never late
[1:04:07] we just have to have a personal
[1:04:09] revelation of who that God is
[1:04:12] what is he able to do
[1:04:15] Liberty look German God showed Joseph
[1:04:22] that there were 11 Stars
[1:04:26] the Moon and Sun that he was worshiping
[1:04:31] he showed Joseph
[1:04:35] death that there was a
[1:04:41] um
[1:04:45] historically strong strong okay
[1:04:49] that they were a straw that was
[1:04:52] worshiping his
[1:04:54] in other words God showed Joseph
[1:04:58] that it was to be a chief killed that he
[1:05:03] had he had to be blessed
[1:05:22] in the ditch
[1:05:26] and you'll find yourself in in a in a
[1:05:30] prison of fortified God didn't show him
[1:05:37] him that
[1:05:43] who is today not difficult our
[1:05:46] difficulties today
[1:05:47] our problems today
[1:05:51] if we only know who our God is
[1:05:56] we are even not gonna let that bother us
[1:05:59] because we know who our God is that is
[1:06:03] able to take us where he wants us to be
[1:06:09] what is predestinated for us
[1:06:13] no one can stop it
[1:06:16] food
[1:06:20] I mean if it decided
[1:06:24] that Moses will spend the rest of his
[1:06:27] life behind the the sheep
[1:06:30] for Moses it was still a blessing
[1:06:36] it's the best place that God could find
[1:06:39] for Moses
[1:06:43] the only problem
[1:06:47] we have to have the revelation
[1:06:50] of what God is saying
[1:06:54] foreign Jesus had 12 disciples
[1:06:59] when we read in the Book of John
[1:07:06] we know that there were other disciples
[1:07:08] didn't have a revelation of Jesus or who
[1:07:11] Jesus was
[1:07:12] but they were all Apostles
[1:07:15] they they cast out Devils
[1:07:18] they did great things
[1:07:21] but when Jesus started saying
[1:07:24] you know where I go
[1:07:27] you know the way
[1:07:29] I am in the father and the father is in
[1:07:31] me
[1:07:32] Philip looks at him and says
[1:07:35] oh I I don't understand that he didn't
[1:07:39] have the revelation of that
[1:07:41] he said then show us
[1:07:44] apostle
[1:07:47] Thomas
[1:07:50] Jesus said everything before he can go
[1:07:53] foreign
[1:08:04] to whom Jesus was talking to
[1:08:08] but when he is Resurrected
[1:08:13] he said I want to touch
[1:08:18] no so it's not
[1:08:22] um
[1:08:23] because we have a power
[1:08:25] because we do demonstrations
[1:08:31] that really we have the revelation of
[1:08:34] who Jesus is because
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:39] sometimes when difficulties arises
[1:08:43] regardless of all the power we have
[1:08:47] we really show who we really are
[1:08:53] but what God wants
[1:08:57] that we have the true Revelation
[1:08:59] personal
[1:09:02] ity
[1:09:03] that's what each one of us has to look
[1:09:06] for
[1:09:07] personal revelation
[1:09:10] of Christ
[1:09:16] and a question and answer of uh uh
[1:09:20] 54 May 50 May 15 1954.
[1:09:25] he says
[1:09:31] paragraph 237 the church was built upon
[1:09:34] divine revelation of God philosopher
[1:09:40] flesh and blood does not revealed this
[1:09:42] to you Peter
[1:09:45] but my Father which is in heaven has
[1:09:48] revealed this unto you
[1:09:50] and Upon This Rock
[1:09:55] spiritual revelation of the word of God
[1:09:59] I'll build my church
[1:10:05] and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail
[1:10:08] against it
[1:10:12] it's about the church
[1:10:14] it's not this building
[1:10:17] it's not this Gathering
[1:10:20] but it's each and every one of us
[1:10:23] and the word says
[1:10:26] that we have to be built
[1:10:31] upon the spiritual revelation of the
[1:10:34] word of God
[1:10:38] and it's only when we are built upon
[1:10:40] that Revelation
[1:10:42] that even the the Gates of Hell remember
[1:10:46] even Satan himself
[1:10:50] cannot do anything against you
[1:11:00] when they go on the need to pray
[1:11:04] even Satan trembles
[1:11:06] when the weakest Christian
[1:11:14] considering yourself the weakest of all
[1:11:16] this tonight
[1:11:18] if you have the personal revelation of
[1:11:21] who Christ says
[1:11:22] if you are built upon it got you to
[1:11:25] imagine when you go on your knees
[1:11:28] put in your head
[1:11:31] that you are causing Satan to tremble
[1:11:35] that you are causing the enemy to
[1:11:37] tremble
[1:11:39] when you cause the enemy to tremble
[1:11:42] then what's going to bother you
[1:11:45] what's going to bother you
[1:11:47] it means you are you have the strength
[1:11:50] you have the power
[1:11:52] he says
[1:11:58] it is
[1:11:59] that's where I say
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:15] don't make a bit of difference
[1:12:19] when the Church of God
[1:12:23] moves on in the power of inspiration
[1:12:27] she will move right on and on and on and
[1:12:31] on
[1:12:32] and on
[1:12:35] and no denomination stop said right
[1:12:41] nothing in the world will stop it
[1:12:45] says
[1:12:51] nothing in the world will stop it
[1:12:54] my sister
[1:12:57] when you have the revelation of who
[1:12:59] Christ is
[1:13:01] nothing in the world will stop you
[1:13:05] not even sickness
[1:13:08] nothing in the world will stop you it
[1:13:12] says Upon This Rock
[1:13:14] I'll build my church
[1:13:19] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:13:22] against it
[1:13:24] spiritual Revelations spiritual truth
[1:13:27] revealed
[1:13:32] and we know that spiritual truth reveal
[1:13:36] is the message that God has sent us
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:41] outside of it
[1:13:45] Satan is mocking people
[1:13:48] regardless of demonstration
[1:13:52] he says now watch
[1:13:56] now the next
[1:14:08] because he had he had the spiritual
[1:14:11] revealed truth
[1:14:14] don't kill us
[1:14:20] that's the reason he knowed the
[1:14:23] difference between Father Son and Holy
[1:14:25] Ghost why
[1:14:29] because he received the spiritual
[1:14:31] revelation
[1:14:33] there are those that pray in the name of
[1:14:35] Jesus
[1:14:38] but they don't even know who that Jesus
[1:14:40] is
[1:14:41] what is that Jesus doing in this moment
[1:14:49] we pray and
[1:14:51] pray and just today that's wonderful
[1:14:53] but it's a testimony for us but today
[1:14:57] where is that Jesus what is he doing in
[1:15:01] your life
[1:15:05] he says
[1:15:10] that's that's the reason he know the
[1:15:12] difference between Father Son and Holy
[1:15:14] Ghost
[1:15:15] and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:20] he had a spiritual revelation
[1:15:28] that's what you are understanding
[1:15:30] tonight where the Holy Ghost is opening
[1:15:33] it up to us
[1:15:37] when we have that revelation
[1:15:41] we are stable
[1:15:43] look at job
[1:15:49] was it had a terrible trial
[1:15:56] a just man it was a perfect man
[1:16:02] he was doing what God asked him to do
[1:16:09] and one day the Bible says that Satan
[1:16:12] went to see God
[1:16:16] asked him where do you come from
[1:16:20] they said well I went to and for the
[1:16:22] Earth and achieved myself and he asked
[1:16:25] him did you see my servant job
[1:16:30] he loves you because you blessed him
[1:16:36] let me touch let me touch a little bit
[1:16:39] of what he has and you'll see
[1:16:42] one day
[1:16:44] job lost all is good
[1:16:47] he lost all his children
[1:16:50] he said the lord giveth
[1:16:53] the lord taketh away
[1:16:56] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:17:01] but regardless of that when you go read
[1:17:03] the book of job
[1:17:06] that job cursed the day that he was born
[1:17:16] that he was to be born a boy
[1:17:21] because of the trial
[1:17:24] job was there
[1:17:27] Satan went
[1:17:30] and he came in there he hit him again
[1:17:32] with ulcers
[1:17:34] but with both he had then it was there
[1:17:39] he was there sitting on the Airship and
[1:17:42] scratching himself
[1:17:45] and there were the visitors coming and
[1:17:47] there were those that were accusing him
[1:17:50] he was there sad
[1:17:53] and he began to look at nature
[1:17:57] oh he says the trees they have hope
[1:18:02] and in the winter they die
[1:18:05] and then in the springtime they come
[1:18:08] back alive but the man where does he go
[1:18:13] he was thinking
[1:18:16] but when the Revelation came
[1:18:20] when Revelation hit him
[1:18:24] job didn't worry anymore
[1:18:27] the job didn't ask any more questions
[1:18:30] before he
[1:18:35] said I was going to go knock at his door
[1:18:38] because you're driving but when a god
[1:18:41] came and revealed himself to him there
[1:18:44] were no more questions
[1:18:45] he said I know
[1:18:48] he didn't say I think
[1:18:50] he didn't say I suppose he said I know
[1:18:56] about my redeemer liveth
[1:18:59] that even live for worms they eat up my
[1:19:03] flesh
[1:19:05] my eyes shall see God
[1:19:08] can't get you there it was no more
[1:19:10] inquiring why
[1:19:12] because he had the personal revelation
[1:19:16] of that God who he was and what was he
[1:19:21] able to do the healing and even if he
[1:19:26] was not gonna heal him
[1:19:29] he knew that that God was able to
[1:19:31] resurrect him
[1:19:33] because he received a revelation
[1:19:36] of who that God was
[1:19:39] he gave he gave him strength
[1:19:43] no doubt he threw away the things that
[1:19:46] he had
[1:19:46] he stood up on the Airship or where he
[1:19:51] was thinking
[1:19:52] he says oh if it was possible
[1:19:57] that my word may be engraved on the
[1:20:00] stones
[1:20:02] but I know my redeemer liveth Joseph
[1:20:06] I know he liveth
[1:20:09] not the same job anymore
[1:20:15] why
[1:20:17] it was fortified by the revelation
[1:20:22] of who Jesus Christ was
[1:20:28] this Revelation says it's like oil
[1:20:33] it gives stimulation
[1:20:38] he says
[1:20:41] in the fourth seal
[1:20:45] paragraph 57.
[1:20:48] it says
[1:20:50] come real now as oil
[1:20:54] symbolize the Holy Spirit
[1:21:00] then we find that that oil and the wine
[1:21:03] connected in worship
[1:21:08] see always connected in worship
[1:21:15] foreign
[1:21:21] I said which came to me the wine
[1:21:25] symbolized symbolized that it was the
[1:21:28] power
[1:21:30] simulation
[1:21:31] it was the power of stimulation by
[1:21:35] revelation
[1:21:43] I wanted to see how job was rejoicing
[1:21:46] that day he said
[1:21:49] they said it was the power of
[1:21:51] stimulation by Revelation
[1:21:56] that's when something has been revealed
[1:22:01] it gives stimulation to the believer
[1:22:06] because it's presented by Revelation
[1:22:11] see it's something that God said has
[1:22:14] said it's a mystery
[1:22:17] and it can't understand it
[1:22:20] and after a while
[1:22:23] God comes down
[1:22:25] and reveals it
[1:22:28] and then it Vindicated
[1:22:32] paragraph 62 he says
[1:22:37] and when God tells you anything and says
[1:22:42] go do this
[1:22:45] and I'll be right with you for it's my
[1:22:48] word
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:22:50] and it shows in the in the Bible
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:56] then God stands right behind that
[1:23:00] if God reveals to you
[1:23:03] and he says go do something
[1:23:07] and he stands right behind it
[1:23:10] he said God will be behind it to show it
[1:23:18] and if it's not written in the Bible
[1:23:23] but God told you
[1:23:26] God stands behind it sister
[1:23:30] if it's the word
[1:23:34] and then
[1:23:37] if it's outside of that
[1:23:40] it's revealed to the prophets
[1:23:47] we realize that all the mysteries of God
[1:23:49] is made known to the prop to prophets
[1:23:52] them them and them alone see Amos 3 7.
[1:23:58] they said now
[1:24:02] the power of Revelation
[1:24:06] brings stimulation to the Believers
[1:24:11] for the power of wine natural wine is to
[1:24:15] stimulate
[1:24:20] see to bring a person that's that's
[1:24:23] that's all slumped down
[1:24:26] coffee shop like job
[1:24:29] he was all slumped down
[1:24:32] but the power of Revelation
[1:24:35] is stimulated him
[1:24:39] it's the power that stimulates someone
[1:24:42] who's all bitten down or slumped down
[1:24:46] if you are slapped down tonight
[1:24:52] get access to revelation
[1:24:56] God will give you stimulation
[1:24:59] it says see
[1:25:01] well then
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:12] give stimulation of Joy to the Believers
[1:25:17] simulation of satisfaction
[1:25:20] whether it be good or bad
[1:25:23] the believer is satisfied
[1:25:30] the stimulation that's it that it's
[1:25:32] Vindicated and it's proved
[1:25:36] [Music]
[1:25:38] it's called in the scripture and we want
[1:25:41] to refer it as new wine
[1:25:44] we always refer to it like that
[1:25:48] as they are drunk in a new wine
[1:25:53] spiritually or spiritual wine
[1:25:58] I think the best interpretation would be
[1:26:02] it will be spiritual wine
[1:26:09] as the natural wine reveal itself in the
[1:26:12] stimulation in the stimulated power
[1:26:16] so that's the new wine are lucky to give
[1:26:19] an apology as he reveals the word of God
[1:26:23] which is Spirit oh now
[1:26:29] the word itself is Spirit you believe
[1:26:32] that
[1:26:34] stimulation
[1:26:38] the power of Revelation
[1:26:42] we receive a message
[1:26:46] a complete word
[1:26:49] it has it has all the power of of
[1:26:53] Resurrection
[1:26:58] God has given us Grace and there's not a
[1:27:01] mystery that's left suspended in the
[1:27:03] Bible
[1:27:05] and that has to stimulate us
[1:27:10] do we have to be certain of who our God
[1:27:13] is
[1:27:16] and it will keep us stable
[1:27:20] look at the frames of Jesus
[1:27:23] martyr and Mary
[1:27:27] they had their brother Lazarus
[1:27:34] when we read and I believe Luke 10
[1:27:37] .
[1:27:39] the Bible says Jesus was staying with
[1:27:41] him
[1:27:43] and when he was talking about the word
[1:27:47] Mary was sitted next to Jesus and she
[1:27:51] was listening
[1:27:54] Marta was taking care of the the things
[1:27:56] of the house and washing dishes and
[1:28:00] then after a while Mao took him to Jesus
[1:28:05] it says doesn't bother you that Mary is
[1:28:08] there sitting
[1:28:11] I'm over there working by myself
[1:28:15] Jesus told her
[1:28:20] you are worried about the little things
[1:28:25] but Mary chose the right thing
[1:28:32] some could say that Martha was carnal
[1:28:39] sometimes a little bit too quickly we
[1:28:42] judge one another oh
[1:28:44] look at him oh he's not spiritual oh
[1:28:48] Marta he's not spiritual
[1:28:52] but look you know they're preaching over
[1:28:54] here and she's over there in the kitchen
[1:28:57] but when Lazarus died
[1:29:01] in John 11
[1:29:08] John chapter 11.
[1:29:18] we'll see that Martha the one we call
[1:29:20] carnal
[1:29:23] she had a revelation
[1:29:25] of who Jesus was
[1:29:29] difficult
[1:29:30] she had a very difficult trial
[1:29:33] she lost her brother
[1:29:36] when her brother was sick
[1:29:39] they call Jesus
[1:29:42] was sick
[1:29:50] Jesus went further
[1:29:55] for others
[1:29:59] he said oh that Pastor doesn't have love
[1:30:03] d
[1:30:04] I mean difficult times I call them
[1:30:09] and I know they told because they told
[1:30:12] me it was there he didn't come he didn't
[1:30:15] even say anything
[1:30:17] and now they told me that he traveled he
[1:30:19] went over there
[1:30:21] he doesn't have love
[1:30:26] and now my brother's dead
[1:30:30] and when Lazarus died
[1:30:33] look at this pastor who didn't have love
[1:30:37] he's now coming to the funeral
[1:30:43] Martin
[1:30:45] when she heard that Jesus was coming
[1:30:49] if we can read it
[1:30:57] chapter 11 verse 20.
[1:31:01] or anything then martyr as soon as she
[1:31:04] heard that Jesus was coming went to meet
[1:31:07] him but Mary sat still in the house then
[1:31:10] martyr then said martyr unto Jesus Lord
[1:31:14] if thou had been here my brother would
[1:31:16] have not died
[1:31:18] but I know that even now whatsoever thou
[1:31:22] will ask of God God will give it to thee
[1:31:26] Jesus said unto her thy water shall rise
[1:31:29] again Martha said unto him I know he
[1:31:33] shall rise again in the resurrection in
[1:31:35] the last day Jesus said unto her I am
[1:31:38] the resurrection and the life and he
[1:31:41] that believeth on me
[1:31:43] though he though he he were dead yet
[1:31:47] shall live and whosoever liveth and and
[1:31:50] believe and liveth and believeth in me
[1:31:52] shall never die
[1:31:54] if we can stop there for now
[1:31:59] regardless of the trial she was having
[1:32:01] it
[1:32:17] and she knew that regardless of the
[1:32:19] trial that she had that she started by
[1:32:23] saying Lord you say I know that if thou
[1:32:27] had been here my brother would not die
[1:32:30] it was true
[1:32:32] that if you were here in other words
[1:32:37] when we called upon you
[1:32:40] if you came
[1:32:43] Lazarus was not gonna die
[1:32:45] but that's not the problem it's already
[1:32:49] gone but I know also
[1:32:52] that all that you would ask now even now
[1:32:57] it will come to pass
[1:32:59] oh what kind of faith oh what kind of
[1:33:02] assurance oh what kind of Regulation I
[1:33:06] was
[1:33:08] she knew
[1:33:14] she didn't look at the fact that he went
[1:33:16] and never came
[1:33:21] she knew that in the valley he was God
[1:33:25] he do that up on the hill it was good
[1:33:27] that in my trials he's God
[1:33:30] he said if he can just say one thing
[1:33:34] that will come to pass
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:39] all that shocked Jesus
[1:33:42] and when she finished
[1:33:44] she went to Mary she said to Mary the
[1:33:49] master has come and he's calling you
[1:33:53] when Mary comes same thing
[1:34:02] I know that if you were here my brother
[1:34:06] would not die but now even now even now
[1:34:12] oh if we can say that tonight
[1:34:15] that even now
[1:34:17] if you say something
[1:34:20] even now
[1:34:23] if you say something
[1:34:25] oh yeah
[1:34:26] yeah
[1:34:30] the regardless of my sickness even now
[1:34:35] regardless of my financial situation
[1:34:37] even now get yourself
[1:34:41] regardless of the situation of my family
[1:34:44] even now
[1:34:46] [Applause]
[1:34:49] when she said that even now
[1:34:53] Jesus could not contain himself he said
[1:34:57] where did you bury him where did you
[1:35:00] bury him where
[1:35:03] where is he
[1:35:05] even now
[1:35:07] Jesus understood
[1:35:13] that they had the Revelation
[1:35:16] that even in difficulties
[1:35:20] they cannot deny me
[1:35:22] they know who I am
[1:35:26] says
[1:35:30] in the same Jesus tonight
[1:35:33] and we believe we have the same Jesus
[1:35:36] tonight
[1:35:38] that we too we can just approach him
[1:35:41] as as Mary did
[1:35:44] declaration
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:36:18] the only man I ever lived that could
[1:36:21] make that this statement the Bible says
[1:36:24] he wasn't even much to look up to look
[1:36:26] at
[1:36:28] probably a little Fray looking person
[1:36:35] I can see him straighten up his little
[1:36:38] frame
[1:36:40] is
[1:36:42] and make this statement I'm the
[1:36:44] resurrection and life
[1:36:47] he declares that to each one and every
[1:36:50] one of us tonight
[1:36:52] I am the resurrection in life
[1:36:56] never a man could say that
[1:36:59] and keep
[1:37:02] no afterward will there be will there
[1:37:05] ever be
[1:37:07] I am the resurrection and life
[1:37:18] he that believeth on me though he though
[1:37:21] he ever be dead yet shall he live
[1:37:26] and whosoever liveth believe it in me
[1:37:30] shall never die Oh Come
[1:37:40] with certainty that now
[1:37:44] we have everlasting life
[1:37:49] if you have the personal revelation
[1:37:53] that Jesus has elected you
[1:37:56] that he gave you eternal life
[1:37:59] nothing is going to stop you
[1:38:07] and that our name are written in the
[1:38:10] Lamb's Book of Life

[2:09:23] the oceans

[2:09:27] pipe that's how much pressure that God
[2:09:32] wants to do there's not a care that you
[2:09:35] have that he don't want to take
[2:09:38] in fact he said cast your cares upon me
[2:09:40] because I care for you
[2:09:44] my yoke is easy my burdens light come
[2:09:47] unto me all ye that are heavy laden and
[2:09:51] I'll give you rest

[2:12:22] but I remember as your messenger told
[2:12:25] the story
[2:12:28] of the woman
[2:12:31] that stood there with the alabaster box
[2:12:35] full of oil
[2:12:37] and she said if I go there and
[2:12:42] wash his feet he'll know
[2:12:46] what I've done
[2:12:48] and he'll know where I got this money to
[2:12:53] buy this oil from
[2:12:56] and that battle went through her heart
[2:12:58] and her mind and and then if she finally
[2:13:01] finally reached the place and she said
[2:13:04] but he's the only one that can help me
[2:13:07] [Music]
[2:13:09] or she wanted to be free
[2:13:12] from that life
[2:13:15] from that bondage
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:20] and she was so ashamed that
[2:13:23] [Music]
[2:13:24] the money she used came from such a
[2:13:27] place
[2:13:28] [Music]
[2:13:30] but she had no place else to go
[2:13:32] [Music]
[2:13:35] and she said he's the only one that can
[2:13:38] help me
[2:13:43] and she heard those beautiful words
[2:13:46] though your sins are many
[2:13:49] they're all forgiven
[2:13:52] go in peace
[2:13:54] [Music]
[2:13:56] and sin no more

[2:14:14] and a testimony

[2:14:20] had need
