[8:11] [Music]
[8:18] you Lord Jesus,
[8:21] we are thankful that we
[8:25] can come to your house tonight, Lord.
[8:30] And
[8:31] certainly the cares of this life and the
[8:35] jobs and school and maybe just the
[8:39] pressures of Lady Oia all around us,
[8:42] Lord, sometimes weighs us down.
[8:45] But Lord, we want to lay all that down
[8:49] tonight, Lord, and
[8:51] just enter into worship you, Lord, with
[8:55] our whole heart.
[8:57] And just remember the things that you've
[8:59] done for us along the way, how you
[9:01] called us out of the world.
[9:04] Lord, when we were shackled by the
[9:07] chains of sin and darkness, Lord, you
[9:09] came calling us and you called us out of
[9:12] the darkness into your marvelous light.
[9:15] Lord, what a joy. It sets us ablaze in
[9:17] our heart
[9:19] to to be free from the things of the
[9:21] world. And Lord, to have a work, a word
[9:25] that's an arc of safety that we can run
[9:27] into and be safe from the oncoming
[9:29] judgment. And Lord, not to just be safe,
[9:31] but to have fellowship and communion
[9:33] with you, to be shut away in the holiest
[9:36] of holies and eating on the fresh mana
[9:39] of your word.
[9:41] Lord, you're worthy of all of our
[9:43] praise. And Lord, if we could sing and
[9:46] praise you with all of our heart, Lord,
[9:48] you certainly are worthy. And so, Lord,
[9:51] may we just forget about ourselves and
[9:53] the things of this world. And Lord, give
[9:56] you the praise that you're due, Lord.
[9:59] Create an atmosphere that you could just
[10:00] come by our way. And Lord, we know that
[10:03] you have a word prepared for us that can
[10:06] help us along the way to take another
[10:08] step. Lord, in one of these glorious
[10:10] days, we'll take a step and be changed.
[10:13] Lord, we pray that you' just anoint
[10:14] brother Billy tonight as you would uh
[10:17] just move upon him and use the man of
[10:19] God and anoint our ears, Lord, to hear.
[10:21] May you just have the preeminence in the
[10:23] service, Lord. Where there's needs that
[10:25] are represented, both spiritual and
[10:27] natural and family members and
[10:29] sicknesses, Lord, but we just want to
[10:31] give you, Lord, the preeminence now that
[10:33] you can just come and minister to our
[10:35] hearts, Lord. We just love you. Commit
[10:38] this service to you now. In Jesus
[10:40] Christ's name we pray. And I
[10:46] love you.
[10:49] Yes, I
[10:53] love
[10:56] you
[10:59] because you
[11:03] first love me. He is

[29:11] the time that we have here to you,
[29:14] desiring that you'd speak to every heart
[29:16] by the preaching of your word. Bless

[35:30] this word and knowing that as we eat of
[35:33] this word, we become even like you,
[35:35] Lord. Come and speak to our hearts
[35:37] tonight. Remember our pastor, Lord,
[35:38] tonight and just touch his body. And
[35:41] Father, those that are home not feeling
[35:42] well as it's been spoken, little William
[35:45] and others, Lord, we want to commit them
[35:47] into your hands. We pray father that
[35:49] your healing touch may just go and touch
[35:51] each and everyone and those that
[35:53] couldn't be here because of work and
[35:55] every other things that came along Lord
[35:57] God we pray that you make a way Lord I
[36:00] believe you are a way maker Lord I
[36:02] believe us that are gathered here is
[36:04] only because you made a way Lord and we
[36:06] pray that you will do for all your
[36:08] children wherever they are we commit
[36:10] this service to you and ask it with all
[36:12] our hearts in the name of the love
[36:14] lovely name Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[36:18] Man, God bless you. I trust you're happy
[36:20] to be in the house of God tonight.
[36:25] Amen. Um, last Sunday I didn't use my
[36:29] five minute and then all of the sudden
[36:31] it multiplied, but that's all right.
[36:34] Let's open our Bibles. Romans chapter
[36:36] 12.
[36:39] We're just going to read couple of
[36:41] verses
[36:44] and I believe the Lord will speak to us.
[36:48] Amen. Romans 12, let's read verse one
[36:51] and two. I said, I beseech you
[36:53] therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
[36:56] God, that ye present your body a living
[36:59] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[37:02] which is your reasonable service. and be
[37:05] not conformed, be not conformed to this
[37:09] world, but be ye transformed by the
[37:11] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[37:14] what is good, what is that good and
[37:16] acceptable will of God. Also, let's uh
[37:20] turn to uh
[37:23] um Matthew. Let's turn to the book of
[37:26] Matthew
[37:28] uh chapter 5. I believe we read this
[37:31] last
[37:32] Sunday in verse
[37:35] 16. It said, "Let your light so shine
[37:39] before men that they may glorify that
[37:42] you may that you may see your good works
[37:45] and they may glorify your father which
[37:47] is in heaven. Gracious father, we ask
[37:49] that you bless your word to us. We
[37:51] commit it to you. In the name of the
[37:52] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. God
[37:55] bless you. You may have your seats.
[38:03] try not to be long just to speak
[38:06] something that uh was quickened to my
[38:09] heart uh from what our pastor was
[38:11] preaching.
[38:13] Um, I want to just for a moment
[38:17] uh uh speak a little bit on uh Christian
[38:22] responsibility,
[38:23] a Christian
[38:25] responsibility. Um, and I believe, you
[38:28] know, as we gather here, I was even
[38:31] thinking about this. Um, we believe that
[38:34] our gathering is known and predestinated
[38:37] by God. We we believe that we we as
[38:41] believers of the end time, we have been
[38:44] predestinated
[38:45] uh to be here at the end time and to
[38:48] manifest the promises of God for this
[38:50] age. And and I and why am I saying that?
[38:54] And I think if we don't believe these
[38:57] things, then we are the most miserable
[39:00] people that there is. We we we've just
[39:02] come to waste our time.
[39:04] And I want to say this, even if we just
[39:06] think, "Oh, it could be true." That's
[39:08] not good enough. This has to be a firm
[39:11] belief that we stand on day in and day
[39:14] out. When you wake up, you you you have
[39:16] to know within your heart without a
[39:19] shadow of a doubt that I have been
[39:21] predestinated to be here. This is not a
[39:23] happen chance. So God didn't create. We
[39:27] understand that. But will say for the
[39:29] purpose of just showing that he can
[39:31] create that every creation that he made
[39:34] he made for a purpose. He made for a
[39:36] reason. We understand that we have been
[39:39] chosen and the choosing we understand
[39:42] that choosing was by predestination by
[39:45] election and and and and it was for a
[39:48] cause because God doesn't do things just
[39:51] so he can show that he can do but he did
[39:53] it so he can achieve a certain purpose.
[39:56] We we can even look the central theme of
[39:59] our message. The message that we believe
[40:01] we can say that the message is come to
[40:04] show us that each believers as we are
[40:07] gathered here tonight was predestinated
[40:10] for a specific purpose that God had and
[40:13] he wants us to fulfill that purpose.
[40:15] He's gathered us together from different
[40:18] countries from different places and he
[40:20] has a work for us to do. He wants us to
[40:23] come uh and for the purpose that we may
[40:26] come with obedience and humility to
[40:28] understand that there's a work that he
[40:31] wants us to do according to his word and
[40:34] according to the promise of the time
[40:36] that we are living in. So our our
[40:39] understanding is we are living uh uh not
[40:42] just taking it day by day but we are
[40:45] living for a cause. We are living for a
[40:47] reason. we when you work up you know the
[40:50] it's amazing because you you when you go
[40:53] you look at people's life uh that you
[40:57] get depressed when you lose the reason
[40:59] for living when you when you when you
[41:01] get confused what your life is all about
[41:04] what am I living what am I doing the
[41:06] moment you lose that depression steps in
[41:09] and confusion steps in we as believers
[41:12] we should never lose the reason for
[41:14] living we should never be confused why
[41:17] we are on this earth, why we are on this
[41:20] planet, we have to be sure every day
[41:23] when we wake up that if God grant me one
[41:25] more day, he's got a reason for me to
[41:27] live. If if the devil can't take me
[41:31] until my time has come, if I'm still
[41:33] breathing, it means God has a work for
[41:35] me to do. And and that should be front
[41:37] of mind. We we should never come to a
[41:40] place where we doubt the things because
[41:42] when we do we it will we will fail to
[41:45] understand the complete purpose of what
[41:47] God is trying to
[41:48] achieve. So we have a reason for being
[41:51] here and this is not our gathering here
[41:54] is not brother but brother but David one
[41:56] time decided to build a church and it
[41:58] felt like it was good and it were
[42:00] getting crowded so he built a bigger
[42:02] church so we can have more people. No,
[42:05] that's not the cause. That's not the
[42:06] reason. This is a divine plan of God
[42:10] that he's using men to achieve. God is
[42:13] predestinated and he's got a purpose in
[42:15] what he's doing. So he's inspiring men
[42:18] to do something to achieve that mission.
[42:21] Each and every one of us, we are here
[42:24] and and and I want to say this. It's the
[42:26] failing of the understanding of how
[42:29] these things work together. That's what
[42:31] causes people to do different things.
[42:34] Why? because they don't understand that
[42:36] it's God who's placing everything
[42:38] together. They don't understand it's God
[42:40] who called you to be here for a reason.
[42:42] They don't understand that I have a role
[42:44] to play in the body. I have a place. God
[42:47] placed me here so I can do something.
[42:49] God called me so I could be responsible
[42:52] for something. It's when you fail to
[42:54] understand that, that's when you become
[42:56] one that goes here, goes there. You fail
[42:59] to understand your very existence and
[43:01] reason for being. So it's for a reason.
[43:04] It's it's a it's it's the word of God.
[43:07] The word of God that was predestinated
[43:10] in the beginning. We can say us that are
[43:13] sitting here tonight that that word is
[43:15] manifested today. Not tomorrow. Today we
[43:20] are gathered here. We can say as those
[43:22] that stood on the day of Pentecost, they
[43:25] can look at it and say look at the crowd
[43:27] that's sitting here. Look at the people
[43:29] that are standing here. We can say today
[43:32] this scripture is fulfilled. We can say
[43:35] this is what was promised. We can say
[43:38] God promised to have a bride in the same
[43:40] time. You are looking at them.
[43:44] Yes, sir. I I'm not saying so I I really
[43:48] want us to hold on to that. Don't don't
[43:51] fail to realize because if you fail to
[43:54] realize then nothing else will happen.
[43:56] What the devil is fighting you is
[43:59] fighting you. So you can disbelieve that
[44:01] word and by disbelieving the very
[44:04] principle of what we are gathered here
[44:06] then you cannot do the work.
[44:09] The work is directly attached to your
[44:12] identity and the understanding of the
[44:14] reason why you are sitting here tonight.
[44:16] Amen. So the promise of God that God had
[44:20] that he was going to have an elected
[44:21] people in the end time that he was
[44:24] looking for predestinated people to
[44:26] manifest himself in the flesh. We can
[44:29] see here we can come here and say that
[44:32] this today that scripture is fulfilled.
[44:35] We are not here to play games. This is
[44:38] the word of God for us. Th this is our
[44:41] ticket to the understanding and our
[44:44] entrance into the heavenly nature. The
[44:47] the scripture says, "An entrance shall
[44:49] be ministered unto you." This is our
[44:51] entrance into the kingdom.
[44:55] God promised to have an elected people
[44:58] in the end time. And we believe that
[45:01] every word of God that was predestinated
[45:03] for us will come the same way. We will
[45:06] one day we'll manifest this. The next
[45:08] day will manifest. He will quicken us
[45:11] from word to word into understanding. We
[45:14] will even as the prophet said the whole
[45:16] thing is God becoming tangible. God
[45:20] wanted to become a student and therefore
[45:22] you are sitting here. God wanted to
[45:24] become a housewife. That's why you are
[45:26] sitting here. God in the end time wanted
[45:28] to be a computer person, a tree person,
[45:31] whatever he wanted to be. That's why you
[45:33] are sitting here. is God dividing of
[45:36] himself into a body that we can stand
[45:39] here and say I am God extended today. I
[45:43] am the manifestation of what God should
[45:45] be in the end time. That that's where we
[45:48] stand on because if we don't fail to
[45:51] understand that I keep saying that
[45:53] because it's very critical we see those
[45:55] things. So it's it's the understanding
[45:57] that it's God bringing all of those
[46:00] things together. It's God manifesting
[46:03] himself. So as Christians we can
[46:05] certainly say that if we are to be a
[46:08] Christian then we should not be a
[46:10] Christian just by name.
[46:15] It's not a name tag that we put and say
[46:18] I'm the bride of Christ and walk around
[46:20] and just feel no I it carries with it a
[46:25] responsibility. It carries with it
[46:27] something that you should feel within
[46:29] yourself that because I'm this therefore
[46:32] I can do this.
[46:35] There's a responsibility attached to it.
[46:38] It it's not it's a oh said one place
[46:41] it's a privilege when we gather
[46:43] together. It's a privilege to be a son
[46:45] of God. It's a privilege to be a
[46:47] daughter of God. Let me say this. How
[46:49] many are outside today in churches? How
[46:52] many are today gather some places in the
[46:55] borrowed other places and and trying the
[46:58] best they can to know the truth and yet
[47:01] is still hidden to them.
[47:05] You we we shouldn't be like the man that
[47:07] grew up at the sea that that gets to
[47:09] hear so much of the word like a a pastor
[47:13] said we become fed. No, we need the word
[47:16] to hold it with such uh anticipation and
[47:19] expectation that the word will be fresh
[47:22] every day we hear it that the word will
[47:24] have an effect on us every time we come
[47:26] in contact with it. So it's a
[47:29] predestinated by election and we're
[47:31] playing our part and we are called for a
[47:34] purpose and that purpose comes with
[47:39] responsibility. It it's a it comes with
[47:41] obligations. It comes with a certain
[47:44] expectation. We are called and and I'm
[47:47] just summarize it for the per for the uh
[47:50] uh sake of time. We are called to to to
[47:53] live and reflect the life of Christ. We
[47:56] are called to stand for the truth. We
[47:59] are called to fulfill whatever works
[48:01] that God has for us in the generation
[48:03] that we are living in. We are called as
[48:06] our pastor said last Sunday to be his
[48:08] billboard, to be his ambassador. We are
[48:11] called to reflect, to be the
[48:13] representative of who he is. We are
[48:15] called to be the salt of the earth. We
[48:18] are called to be the final force to the
[48:20] final age. We are called to be God's
[48:22] extended hand.
[48:25] The these are the things that we know.
[48:28] and and and and what I'm trying to get
[48:30] to is with that calling there comes an
[48:33] expectation of us that we should not
[48:36] just uh uh speak it but it should not be
[48:39] in words only but it can be in deed
[48:41] also.
[48:44] The prophet will tell us that when God
[48:46] calls he calls a man he calls him for a
[48:49] purpose. He calls him uh not just for
[48:53] the blessings but he calls so he can use
[48:56] him.
[48:59] God
[49:01] didn't create us or put us here to see
[49:04] if he really has if a power of saving
[49:07] really
[49:08] works. He said, "Well, you know, I'll
[49:11] call them out of the earth and I'll
[49:13] justify them and sanctify them and fill
[49:16] with them with the baptism of the Holy
[49:19] Ghost just so I can see if I can really
[49:21] do it."
[49:23] He did it for a purpose. and and we we
[49:27] as men must walk in obedience in order
[49:30] for us to fulfill that that purpose that
[49:33] God has called us to. So the work that
[49:36] because remember he promised in the word
[49:39] that the works that I do ye shall do
[49:41] also.
[49:43] And and when he came he was sent of his
[49:46] father. He was sent to come for a
[49:49] purpose and and he came and he did and
[49:52] he promised to to the believers that the
[49:54] works that I do you shall do. And we
[49:56] understand the prophet will tell us that
[49:58] that he came to fulfill a work and he
[50:01] left us also a work for us to do
[50:05] as
[50:07] believers. The prophet was speaking the
[50:09] message God doesn't call men to judgment
[50:12] without first warning him. uh preaching
[50:16] 630724 paragraph 40 he says now because
[50:20] we he says now because we have a
[50:25] responsibility that we've got to answer
[50:27] to God some for uh someday for he says
[50:31] every man that comes on that comes on
[50:34] the face of the earth has to answer to
[50:37] God for
[50:39] responsibility and it says and to many
[50:42] of us a stewardship ship we have to
[50:45] answer for. He says this responsibility
[50:49] is a stewardship that's been committed
[50:51] to us by God. I don't care what it
[50:55] is. As I said a few moment ago moments
[50:58] ago, a housewife than to be then be a
[51:02] genuine housewife. That's right. If it's
[51:05] to be a farmer, be a genuine farmer.
[51:09] Whatever whatever it uh whatever is that
[51:12] to that God put you puts put you to do
[51:16] you got a stewardship to do you've got
[51:20] to answer to God for because it takes
[51:23] all these things to do it. So here's the
[51:27] proverty is letting us know I it's not
[51:31] one that would say well and is even
[51:34] saying it in a sense that one can come
[51:36] and say oh I'm less important than that
[51:38] other person oh I'm just a housewife or
[51:41] I'm just a student I'm just this here is
[51:44] a prophet saying what whatever
[51:46] stewardship that God has placed within
[51:48] your hand is giving it to you and you
[51:51] got to have to you you have to hold it
[51:54] uh uh uh respons responsibly because
[51:56] you're going to have to answer to God
[51:58] someday. And and he wants us as
[52:01] believers to be aware of those things.
[52:03] Whatever we do, uh the life that we have
[52:06] been given, he says one place that if if
[52:09] someone give you a life, at least you're
[52:11] going to ask what's the purpose that he
[52:12] gave your life for. Now, I'm not saying
[52:15] this to scare us. I'm saying this so we
[52:18] can be aware that the life that's been
[52:21] given to us, it's given to us for for
[52:23] for more than just holding a job, from
[52:26] just more than just going on vacation.
[52:29] It's given to us for more than just
[52:31] wanting to go nice places and to do, but
[52:33] it's given to us to fulfill a much
[52:36] greater commission than just the normal
[52:38] life that we live every day.
[52:42] Because if we if we fail to understand
[52:44] that then we don't know we we have a
[52:46] life we don't know what to do with it.
[52:48] We can do whatever we want with it. But
[52:50] when we know that we have to account for
[52:53] everything that we do then it will give
[52:55] us at least an awareness so we can use
[52:58] the life for the purpose for which we
[53:00] were placed on earth to
[53:02] do. He said it's not uh it don't matter
[53:06] what you do but God give you
[53:08] responsibility a stewardship whether it
[53:11] be in the family whether it be a
[53:13] coworker wherever you find yourself
[53:16] there's a stewardship within you uh
[53:19] that's given to you to present the life
[53:21] of Christ to live the life of Christ so
[53:24] you could be the salt of the earth so
[53:26] you could be the influence so you can be
[53:29] that person that people will look and
[53:31] see Christ too and that's why It's
[53:33] important that you are aware that that's
[53:35] what's expected of
[53:37] you. And and and I want to say this, but
[53:40] the prophet will say that God cannot
[53:42] call a man unless he equips that man.
[53:44] It's not that we have been given for us
[53:47] to produce something on our own, but
[53:49] within you, if you are sitting here
[53:52] tonight, it's because there's something
[53:54] in you that God has placed there to live
[53:56] the life of Christ.
[54:00] He didn't call you and say, "Go figure
[54:01] out how you're going to live a life of
[54:03] Christ." No. But he's called us so by
[54:05] the life that's inside of us, if we can
[54:08] truly surrender it to him, we will live
[54:11] the life of Christ no matter where we
[54:13] are.
[54:15] And he wants us to be aware of that.
[54:20] the prophet will speak in the message.
[54:23] Uh he will speak
[54:25] and in fact he he's using uh is using uh
[54:31] what Paul is talking about here. Um it
[54:35] was Paul it was using it says we have
[54:38] been given power for influence and all
[54:41] those things elected to be part of the
[54:44] army of God. We understand when Paul
[54:46] speaks um I believe it's in uh second
[54:49] Timothy he would speak and he will talk
[54:52] about life it says that you should be a
[54:54] good soldier and brotherham will use
[54:57] that and and he will use in that context
[54:59] and he will speak here in in the message
[55:02] that deceived church by the world
[55:03] paragraph 8 he says that remember we are
[55:07] not in a picnic but we are in the
[55:09] battlefield so he he's wanting you to be
[55:12] aware of your surrounding and the place
[55:15] that you are living in. So he could so
[55:18] you could be aware of what influence you
[55:21] are playing into this. We are in the
[55:23] battlefield. Many people just think that
[55:26] when I become a Christian, that's all I
[55:29] need. That's all they need to do. It
[55:31] says and that settles it forever.
[55:34] Paragraph 8. And it says and they are a
[55:37] Christian and everything is going to
[55:39] come easy.
[55:42] It says don't ever don't ever get he
[55:45] says don't ever get that in your mind
[55:47] for I became a Christian to fight to
[55:50] fight the good fight of faith. I became
[55:52] a Christian to get into the battle line.
[55:55] We are Christian soldiers and we got to
[55:58] be trained and brought up and it says
[56:02] and we know that we know all the
[56:03] techniques of the enemy to know how to
[56:06] fortify to know how to fight the fight.
[56:09] We it says that we can only do that as
[56:12] the Holy Spirit will reveal it to us. He
[56:14] says we cannot do that. We cannot do
[56:18] what other some other nation tells us to
[56:20] go uh uh what other nation tells us when
[56:24] we go to war. So that uh we we take some
[56:27] of the ideas but we go we got to take
[56:30] our own ideas the way that the Holy
[56:32] Spirit will direct us what ideas he
[56:35] would give us because this he is our
[56:38] commanding and chief the army of the
[56:40] Christians. So he's warning us to be
[56:43] aware that this is not a picnic place.
[56:48] This is not a place where we we think we
[56:51] are on the playground, but he's wanting
[56:54] us to he's comparing the Christian life
[56:57] with with with being a battle. In fact,
[56:59] Paul will speak and some places he'll
[57:01] compare it to a race and and other place
[57:04] he'll compare it with contending and all
[57:06] of those things. But he's warning us, us
[57:09] that are called the elected to know that
[57:11] we are being trained or we have been
[57:14] trained by the word of God given the
[57:17] uniform. We have been equipped with a
[57:19] weapon of the word so we can fight.
[57:24] We we he's wanting us to know that this
[57:27] is Satan's Eden. He's laying traps at
[57:30] every corner. He's wanting to trap us by
[57:32] all means. He's warning us. He set
[57:35] everything with the deception in it so
[57:38] we can live by the uh uh his provision.
[57:42] But we as Christians, we have to be
[57:44] aware that the enemy is at play and live
[57:48] by every word of God. Oh, I begin to
[57:51] think about it. He want us to have the
[57:53] awareness of what a soldier will have.
[57:56] He wants us to keep our eyes open. He
[57:58] doesn't want us to just be uh uh uh
[58:01] tossed to and fro and and be just
[58:03] without thinking. He wants you to be
[58:05] trained and to be focused and to keep
[58:08] your attention and to know that you are
[58:11] in the battle. Don't live a life that's
[58:13] distracted but pay attention because you
[58:16] have a responsibility.
[58:24] Paul is writing in this
[58:27] and it says he writes to Timothy and it
[58:32] says in 2 Timothy 2 uh 1 and 3 through7
[58:36] it says thou are my son thou therefore
[58:40] my son be strong in the grace in the
[58:45] grace that is Jesus
[58:48] Christ thou it says thou Therefore, my
[58:52] son, be strong in the grace. He doesn't
[58:55] want him to be uh weak or or or to be
[58:59] affected. He wants him to be not to be
[59:02] hindered. He said, "Be strong. Be be
[59:05] courageous as it will tell Joshua. Be
[59:07] strong in the grace of our Lord Jesus
[59:10] Christ. and the things thou has heard
[59:13] and of me among many witness. The same
[59:16] commit to to uh commit thou to faithful
[59:20] men who shall be able to teach others.
[59:24] In other words, take the things which
[59:26] you have heard and the things which have
[59:28] been shared to you and keep it and teach
[59:31] it to others.
[59:33] You know, don't be distracted.
[59:35] Understand what's going on around you.
[59:37] The word is not given to you. I thought
[59:40] what an image uh it would be if it will
[59:43] take one that's that's gone to training
[59:46] to be a soldier given a uniform given
[59:49] food to eat given a pay and afraid to go
[59:52] to war.
[59:56] one who's been trained and and and the
[59:59] the training paid for and and given
[1:00:01] every training possible and and you know
[1:00:04] uh uh I was just thinking I believe it
[1:00:07] was brother Andrews I was talking to him
[1:00:09] and uh uh and we were talking how you
[1:00:11] know even part of the training what what
[1:00:14] they want to get you to do is to do what
[1:00:18] men cannot do when they under
[1:00:21] pressure. Part of the training is to get
[1:00:24] you to do things where it becomes second
[1:00:27] nature. Where you don't have to go
[1:00:29] through the normal process of thinking.
[1:00:32] Why? Because the devil will attack your
[1:00:34] normal process of thinking. And without
[1:00:36] the training, you will forget what you
[1:00:39] need to do. So he comes and he the the
[1:00:42] it takes you and he takes you through
[1:00:44] all that training and and he gives you
[1:00:46] the uniform and and with that uniform
[1:00:49] comes a responsibility.
[1:00:52] I I I'm in the army of God. I'm
[1:00:55] responsible for my brother. I'm
[1:00:57] responsible for everywhere I see the
[1:00:59] enemy. In fact, let me say this. Those
[1:01:02] that are in uniform, even when they come
[1:01:05] to live a civilian life, they only do it
[1:01:09] until they are called for duty.
[1:01:12] So, the first priority in life is duty.
[1:01:16] I I've been elected to be in the army of
[1:01:18] God. I've been elected in the army of
[1:01:21] United States. I'm a fighter in the
[1:01:23] United States. So whenever I'm called,
[1:01:26] it doesn't matter where the enemy is,
[1:01:28] I'm there to answer for the call.
[1:01:33] And let me say this. That's why I said I
[1:01:36] don't want us to look at it as an a a
[1:01:39] blame, but I want us to look at it as an
[1:01:42] opportunity. What a call. What an
[1:01:45] opportunity. God could have called
[1:01:47] anybody, but he chose you. In fact, they
[1:01:50] said that the job that he's given you to
[1:01:52] do, even Moses couldn't do it.
[1:01:57] You are elected to do the job in the end
[1:02:01] time. He says, "Thou therefore endure
[1:02:06] hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
[1:02:09] Christ."
[1:02:10] So a soldier is made to endure hard
[1:02:15] things. you you know there's many times
[1:02:18] I you know you you will go and your day
[1:02:20] will come just you know how things go
[1:02:23] that the things just seem like it
[1:02:25] doesn't go well and and you know and
[1:02:27] then you're like at the end of the day
[1:02:29] why does things have to be hard and then
[1:02:31] you're reminded I'm just supposed to be
[1:02:33] a
[1:02:34] soldier you know like why does
[1:02:36] everything has to be hard why can I not
[1:02:39] just do something and it works the first
[1:02:41] time why do I have to do it all it's God
[1:02:44] training you You are you are a soldier.
[1:02:47] You are made to stand there. You are
[1:02:50] made to endure hard things.
[1:02:54] You are not made to be a civilian who
[1:02:57] will crumble when time something doesn't
[1:02:59] work. But he's calling Timothy and say
[1:03:02] therefore endure hardness as a good
[1:03:05] soldier. He says, "No man that wareth
[1:03:09] entangles himself with the affair of
[1:03:11] life that he may please
[1:03:13] him that he may be that he may please
[1:03:16] him who had chosen him to be a soldier.
[1:03:20] And if a man also strive for masteries,
[1:03:23] yet he is not crowned except he strives
[1:03:26] lawfully. The husband men that labored
[1:03:29] must first be partaker of the fruit.
[1:03:32] Consider what I say and the Lord giveth
[1:03:35] unto thee understanding of the things.
[1:03:38] So Paul is comparing and is telling
[1:03:40] Timothy. Paul is using this analogy of a
[1:03:43] soldier and he's talking and said I want
[1:03:46] you to endure. I want you to be focused.
[1:03:49] I want you to have discipline. I want
[1:03:51] you to follow Christ. You are not just a
[1:03:54] civilian but you belong to another
[1:03:56] kingdom. Amen.
[1:04:01] It says, "Father, they are not of this
[1:04:05] world. I pray not that you not take them
[1:04:08] out of the world. I pray that you keep
[1:04:10] him, but be with them as they are in the
[1:04:14] world." We are spiritual in the
[1:04:17] spiritual warfare. We are We must act
[1:04:20] like good soldiers under the command of
[1:04:23] our Lord Jesus Christ. We are
[1:04:25] responsible. we have a work to do. So
[1:04:29] he's wanting us as soldier that are
[1:04:31] being trained that have been given
[1:04:33] weapon to have the endurance or the
[1:04:36] endurance or the ability to endure hard
[1:04:38] things the focus and that our lives may
[1:04:42] be lived so it could be pleasing to the
[1:04:44] one who called us.
[1:04:48] I was thinking about I remember when I
[1:04:51] was in college years ago, I had
[1:04:55] a one of my professors uh was uh was
[1:04:59] used to be in the
[1:05:01] Navy and uh he would tell us stories
[1:05:04] about what it was and and he would tell
[1:05:08] us stories about the training and he
[1:05:11] said one day they send them to run I
[1:05:13] don't know 10 miles or whatever they
[1:05:15] were running and exercising ing and he
[1:05:17] came and he said that there were a
[1:05:19] couple of them that ran past the group
[1:05:21] and they came and showed up and the
[1:05:23] commanding officer looked at them and
[1:05:24] said where's the others and said they
[1:05:26] left over there said go back and bring
[1:05:28] them all. So he sent them back to come
[1:05:31] and bring them. He said what was he
[1:05:33] teaching us? He was teaching us that we
[1:05:35] work as a unit. We are not we he was
[1:05:39] teaching us that we we fail together we
[1:05:42] succeed together. He was teaching us
[1:05:44] that as part of the army, you you care
[1:05:47] about the brother that's standing next
[1:05:49] to you. You care about the sister that's
[1:05:51] standing next to you. When you be when
[1:05:54] you are brought part of the army, an
[1:05:56] army cannot succeed as one person. An
[1:05:59] army has a people and there's such a
[1:06:02] trust build that if the one in the front
[1:06:04] tells you something, you have to believe
[1:06:06] them and help them. Amen.
[1:06:10] He he he was trying to tell us to
[1:06:12] understand that when you come into the
[1:06:15] army of God, you are the protection of
[1:06:18] your brother is your protection. The
[1:06:20] your brother becomes your
[1:06:22] responsibility. Your sister becomes your
[1:06:25] responsibility. If one is affected, the
[1:06:27] whole body is affected. If one is said,
[1:06:30] the whole body is sad. If one is shot
[1:06:33] at, everybody is shot at. We go, we
[1:06:36] protect him. I love the American army.
[1:06:38] They said, "We don't leave no man
[1:06:40] behind." Amen.
[1:06:42] It doesn't matter if we need to go get
[1:06:45] more people so we can come, but rest
[1:06:47] assured, nobody will be left behind.
[1:06:52] The trouble is the church has turned
[1:06:54] into a group of
[1:06:57] mavericks, people that just care about
[1:06:59] themselves.
[1:07:02] You know, I'm safe. I have the Holy
[1:07:04] Spirit. I don't care who else has it or
[1:07:05] not. It's just
[1:07:09] mine. You're not part of the army. Part
[1:07:12] of the army. When you see the enemy
[1:07:15] attack somebody, when you hear that
[1:07:18] there's a group over there that's
[1:07:19] ambushed, the army goes to work. Why?
[1:07:22] Because they know, oh my brother, my
[1:07:24] sister, let me say this with the army is
[1:07:27] just not the
[1:07:28] responsibility. Because remember the
[1:07:31] word responsibility. There's also power
[1:07:34] attached to responsibility. The word
[1:07:37] power is attached to responsibility. The
[1:07:39] army knows that they have the power to
[1:07:42] deliver.
[1:07:44] They have the power to run the enemy
[1:07:46] out. Oh, I was thinking about little
[1:07:49] David. Here he is. And his father, he he
[1:07:52] didn't ask to be a shepherd. If if the
[1:07:55] father gave him that responsibility, he
[1:07:57] told him, he says, "Well, David, today,
[1:07:59] you know what? You're going to be a
[1:08:00] shepherd. you the youngest, we'll take
[1:08:02] you and we'll put you over the sheep and
[1:08:05] everything. David was glad for the
[1:08:07] positioning. He was glad that was that
[1:08:10] was as long as that's the father wanted
[1:08:12] him to do, he was happy about it and he
[1:08:15] kept the sheep. Now, let me say this.
[1:08:18] When the bear showed up, when the lion
[1:08:20] showed up, I don't believe that
[1:08:22] physically that David had the power to
[1:08:25] defeat them. But David had more
[1:08:28] confidence in the father's word that I
[1:08:30] have given you authority to watch over
[1:08:32] your sheep. He took the father's word
[1:08:35] and he went and he defeat those animals.
[1:08:38] Amen. That's the problem with us. The
[1:08:41] father is elected us. He called us to be
[1:08:44] part of the army. He placed us into his
[1:08:46] house. But we are ashamed and afraid.
[1:08:53] Is the father's word not good enough?
[1:08:57] If the father said we are overcomers,
[1:09:00] his word is good enough. If the father
[1:09:02] said we can defeat the enemy, his word
[1:09:04] is good enough. Whatever the father
[1:09:07] said, we'll go fight for that word. Why?
[1:09:10] Because the father knows best.
[1:09:15] So he it's the understanding that we are
[1:09:18] part of a bigger picture.
[1:09:22] We are part of something greater that
[1:09:25] God is trying to build.
[1:09:35] So when you read the word definition,
[1:09:38] the definition of
[1:09:40] responsibility, it says it's the state
[1:09:44] or the fact of outing of of having a
[1:09:50] duty to deal with
[1:09:53] something or having control over
[1:09:57] someone. But the similarity in
[1:10:00] words, responsibility also will mean
[1:10:04] authority,
[1:10:05] control, power, leadership, influence
[1:10:09] and management. A commitment to fulfill
[1:10:13] one's duty and obligation to God,
[1:10:17] oneself and others. It involve acting in
[1:10:21] accordance with the will of God, showing
[1:10:25] obedience and demonstrating the love and
[1:10:27] the care for those around us. This
[1:10:30] includes both individual accountability
[1:10:32] to God and collective
[1:10:35] responsibility within the community or
[1:10:38] the
[1:10:43] church. A responsible person doesn't
[1:10:46] care just about himself.
[1:10:48] A person who's
[1:10:50] responsible, he knows the
[1:10:52] weight of what's what's following
[1:11:00] him. Moses, God called him.
[1:11:04] He came and he stood there
[1:11:07] and behind him there's the Philistines
[1:11:10] coming and in front of them there's the
[1:11:12] Red Sea and on this side there's a
[1:11:15] mountain and outside and the children of
[1:11:17] Israel saying, "Oh, what are we going to
[1:11:19] do? We're going to die." And he
[1:11:22] understood what it was up
[1:11:25] against. But he knew that if God placed
[1:11:28] him there to be responsible for that,
[1:11:30] that God was going to provide a way. And
[1:11:33] he knew when he talked to God, God said,
[1:11:35] "Why cry? You speak." He spoke the word
[1:11:39] and the word came to pass. Why? Because
[1:11:42] he understood that his word as he was
[1:11:45] being instructed by God. Just the same
[1:11:48] way that he has responsibility, the
[1:11:51] responsibility carried power to achieve
[1:11:54] the mission. Amen. Your responsibility
[1:11:58] carries the power for you to achieve the
[1:12:00] mission.
[1:12:03] God cannot me make me responsible for
[1:12:05] children that I cannot pray for and have
[1:12:08] an effect on them.
[1:12:11] Then what am I responsible for?
[1:12:14] God cannot call me in a circumstance
[1:12:17] where my words are not effective. Then
[1:12:19] what am I responsible for?
[1:12:25] The responsibility is the understanding
[1:12:27] that father I'm coming to you. You gave
[1:12:30] me this child. You gave me this
[1:12:32] daughter, I have the right to go on my
[1:12:34] knees and pray for them and you will
[1:12:36] hear my prayer. You've given me,
[1:12:39] brothers and sisters, I can pray for
[1:12:40] them and you will hear my prayer. It's
[1:12:43] the power that's been given to the
[1:12:45] believers.
[1:12:48] What is
[1:12:50] adoption? It's just the greater
[1:12:52] responsibility.
[1:12:56] It's the understanding
[1:12:58] that the father's signature is just good
[1:13:01] as my signature. But it doesn't come
[1:13:03] without character. Because if we got
[1:13:06] because outside of character, it will be
[1:13:08] power without character. What he wants
[1:13:10] us to understand is we have been trained
[1:13:13] and given the power to speak the word.
[1:13:16] What word are we speaking? Is the
[1:13:18] responsible word of God that we can
[1:13:22] speak what he desires for us to speak.
[1:13:25] Because remember when Jesus got to that
[1:13:28] place, the word said that he spoke
[1:13:30] nothing until the father showed
[1:13:35] him. How are we going to be effective if
[1:13:39] we don't understand our responsibility?
[1:13:44] But when I'm said that I believe it's in
[1:13:47] the message total deliverance if we are
[1:13:49] part of a body or a part of the church
[1:13:52] if the church has a rule if a church
[1:13:54] says that we should not play a a a games
[1:13:57] or deco card or whatever it said then
[1:14:00] everybody has to have the responsibility
[1:14:02] to do the same. Amen.
[1:14:07] Why? Because and let me say this it's
[1:14:09] just burning in my heart. We move
[1:14:12] together as a unit. We move together as
[1:14:15] a body. We act as a body. That's when we
[1:14:18] are at our most efficient place.
[1:14:22] It's the understanding that we've been
[1:14:24] called to be
[1:14:25] our differences matter not. Whatever we
[1:14:29] came from, that doesn't matter. What
[1:14:31] matter is God places you together.
[1:14:35] I I I think about you. You read so many
[1:14:37] books that talk about Abraham Lincoln
[1:14:39] and George Washington and all of them. I
[1:14:42] I I I think so much about those that
[1:14:45] follow those
[1:14:46] men. How many gave their life because
[1:14:49] they believe what those people said.
[1:14:53] Often time the victory is attributed to
[1:14:55] the leader. But there were those that
[1:14:57] heard it and took responsibility and
[1:15:00] laid down their lives.
[1:15:07] But if we are those that oh my voice is
[1:15:10] not being heard then I'm not part of it.
[1:15:12] What? No. The word of God is our voice.
[1:15:16] The word of God is what we go with. If
[1:15:18] it's the word we move forward. It
[1:15:20] doesn't matter where who spoke it, where
[1:15:22] it came from. If God speaks, we go. We
[1:15:26] we we buckle up together. If one is
[1:15:28] being attacked, the whole church is
[1:15:30] behind them. Amen. To get them back.
[1:15:33] Amen.
[1:15:34] We we can't come and not know. We we
[1:15:37] wonder have we haven't seen for weeks
[1:15:39] and days and we don't know what happened
[1:15:41] to them. Oh, maybe they're back. I knew
[1:15:43] they were going to do
[1:15:45] that. What kind of body would that be?
[1:15:48] What kind of army would that be? Imagine
[1:15:51] you go back to the camp after going to
[1:15:53] fight. You come back. Where's such and
[1:15:55] such? I don't know. He must have been
[1:15:59] captured. Really?
[1:16:07] it's not going to be
[1:16:09] effective. The effectiveness comes from
[1:16:12] the fact
[1:16:13] that we have responsibility one for
[1:16:16] another. We have responsibility where
[1:16:19] God puts us. I was fellowshipping with
[1:16:23] brother David and this uh just was on my
[1:16:26] heart and I was thinking about how you
[1:16:30] know the word the end time word is such
[1:16:32] so wonderful and the prophet comes in
[1:16:35] the end time and he
[1:16:37] he remember the the the man was under
[1:16:41] the bondage of
[1:16:43] denominations. there they were bondage
[1:16:45] to the home churches and denomination
[1:16:48] and whatever the church did and whatever
[1:16:50] the church says that's what they had to
[1:16:52] believe and and anytime they they were
[1:16:54] afraid even afraid to believe something
[1:16:56] outside of what the church believed and
[1:16:59] therefore barbanam he cried out against
[1:17:01] all of those things to show you that
[1:17:04] your your your loyalty or your belief is
[1:17:07] what God has done not what the church in
[1:17:10] in other words he's trying to free you
[1:17:11] from the denomination spirit
[1:17:14] from the church spirit from uh being
[1:17:16] bound and and and he wanted you to be
[1:17:19] free and and he wanted that's why he
[1:17:21] made a statement he says often time
[1:17:23] people take people to church instead
[1:17:24] instead of taking them to Christ what
[1:17:26] was he trying to show it was Christ that
[1:17:28] we are focusing on we are not focusing
[1:17:31] on the
[1:17:33] church but I believe with that came
[1:17:36] people that felt like they have not to
[1:17:39] answer to any man except God himself and
[1:17:43] not to be effective or useful for any
[1:17:46] part of the
[1:17:47] body. It's just between me and God and
[1:17:50] nobody
[1:17:53] else. No, it was so we can come and form
[1:17:57] the perfect union. what the denomination
[1:18:01] hindered, what the denomination lacked,
[1:18:04] God was calling us so we can come and be
[1:18:07] that perfect church, the type of that
[1:18:10] perfect church, the perfect church that
[1:18:12] carry one for another, the perfect body
[1:18:15] that really functioned the way it was
[1:18:17] supposed to be. On the day of Pentecost,
[1:18:20] they sold everything that they had and
[1:18:21] put the money
[1:18:25] together. That's how much they care for.
[1:18:28] They wanted to be together every day.
[1:18:32] They lived together. They they were
[1:18:33] there every time. In fact, that's why
[1:18:36] God after they received the Holy Spirit,
[1:18:38] he had to spread them across the world
[1:18:40] because if it was up to them, they would
[1:18:42] have stayed
[1:18:44] together. But the gospel had to go on.
[1:18:49] So, we have to understand it. It's the
[1:18:51] father's desire that we can come and be
[1:18:55] part of the work of God. And it doesn't
[1:18:58] matter whether it's this church or any
[1:19:00] place wherever you are. You want to be
[1:19:03] an effective member of God's body.
[1:19:09] But when I makes this statement, I'll
[1:19:11] just read it quickly and then I'll get
[1:19:12] back
[1:19:24] to if I could find it.
[1:21:45] body. I've been called to be part of the
[1:21:49] body of Christ.
[1:21:53] But when I'm the scripture was
[1:21:56] speaking Genesis chapter 14 and speaking
[1:21:59] of Abraham going after
[1:22:01] Lot. If you go and read it and go
[1:22:05] searching, it says that Abraham only had
[1:22:09] 318
[1:22:11] men.
[1:22:14] 318. and he went and fought against four
[1:22:18] kings with their armies
[1:22:21] combined to get Lot back.
[1:22:25] Now, I want you to just stay with me for
[1:22:28] a
[1:22:30] moment. If Abraham has had really reason
[1:22:33] what he was trying to do, he would have
[1:22:36] never set foot out of outside of his
[1:22:38] tent.
[1:22:40] If it was really conscious of what was
[1:22:43] happening, he was never going to go
[1:22:45] after. He was going to try to send
[1:22:47] somebody and negotiate and figure out a
[1:22:49] way to do it from his
[1:22:52] tent. But Abraham understood that Lord
[1:22:56] Lot was his
[1:22:59] responsibility. He understood that God
[1:23:03] when I left my country, I left with Lot.
[1:23:06] Lot is part of me. And therefore, even
[1:23:10] though they separated, even though Lot
[1:23:12] took what he thought was the best, when
[1:23:15] Lot was in trouble, Abraham went after
[1:23:19] Lot. He didn't think it. He didn't
[1:23:22] reason it. He all he knew was Lot was in
[1:23:25] danger. He was taken. Abraham went
[1:23:28] after. And because he had the
[1:23:31] responsibility over Lot, he understood
[1:23:33] that. that gave him the power to defeat
[1:23:36] the four kings and their
[1:23:41] armies. I really want us to understand
[1:23:44] the what you your responsibility your
[1:23:47] word has power when you have
[1:23:49] responsibility over something. Your word
[1:23:52] can make the difference when you have
[1:23:54] power over something. When you speak
[1:23:57] over, you know, it's like my children,
[1:23:59] you know, they they grow up and then
[1:24:01] they get through age and you know, they
[1:24:03] what they used to do is just eat and run
[1:24:05] upstairs and everything. So we told
[1:24:07] them, well, from now on after you eat,
[1:24:09] you got to clean the table. You got to
[1:24:11] pick up everything. You got to do Oh,
[1:24:18] training. You know, at first it was a
[1:24:20] chore, but after a while they began to
[1:24:23] enjoy it because it gives them, they
[1:24:25] understand it's a responsibility. Now if
[1:24:28] one runs out, the other reminds them,
[1:24:29] hey, we have a responsibility.
[1:24:33] we got to clean up.
[1:24:35] When they wake up in the morning before
[1:24:37] they go to school, they remind, oh, we
[1:24:39] have a responsibility to fix our beds.
[1:24:43] It's an empowering.
[1:24:46] It it it's not a burden, but it's
[1:24:49] gladness. It's power. It's an
[1:24:51] opportunity to serve. It's an
[1:24:53] opportunity to demonstrate what's within
[1:24:56] the heart. It's an opportunity to show
[1:24:58] that I'm part of
[1:25:00] something. Amen.
[1:25:08] But when I'm said this and I thought and
[1:25:10] and I'm I'm where did I get this this I
[1:25:14] was reading I was listening to the
[1:25:16] message a man running uh from the
[1:25:18] presence of God and it really hit me in
[1:25:20] a way that it never hit me before. I've
[1:25:23] listened to it before, but it really
[1:25:25] touched me in a manner that I never. So,
[1:25:27] he says this in a man running away, a
[1:25:29] man running from the presence of God.
[1:25:31] Paragraph 42, he says, "Now many of you
[1:25:34] um he talks about let me let me skip and
[1:25:37] let me start uh uh let me just start
[1:25:41] here." Says, he says, "Now the word of
[1:25:43] the Lord came to uh Jonah, the son of
[1:25:46] Amatia, saying, arise and go to
[1:25:49] Nineveh." If you can start in paragraph
[1:25:51] 42, he says uh the great city and cry
[1:25:54] out against them. Then Josh then uh
[1:25:56] Jonah rise up and and he flee to Tarses
[1:26:00] and uh from the presence of the Lord and
[1:26:02] went down to Jopa and found the sheep
[1:26:04] that uh that was going to Tarses and he
[1:26:06] paid a fair thereof and went down into
[1:26:09] it and go uh and and got to them in
[1:26:13] Tarses from the presence of the Lord. He
[1:26:15] says Barbanam says this paragraph 43.
[1:26:18] Isn't that sad ending? A man running
[1:26:22] from the presence of the Lord. That's my
[1:26:24] subject. It says the first we want to
[1:26:27] think of Jonah in this. It says the
[1:26:29] reason the principal reason I believe
[1:26:32] that he did this great thing here was
[1:26:35] because Jonah was a Jew and he was it
[1:26:38] was asked to go to the gentile city and
[1:26:41] cry out against it thinking it would not
[1:26:44] be received because Gentile will think
[1:26:47] what's this Jew uh got to do with us.
[1:26:51] But see you see another thing uh it
[1:26:54] gives us great thing here. See, God, it
[1:26:58] says that God not only is the God of
[1:27:01] Jew, but he's also the God of Gentile,
[1:27:03] is God of all people. So, here's the
[1:27:06] prophet speaking. So, there is God is
[1:27:08] sending you. And I want you to put
[1:27:10] yourself tonight in in in Jonah's shoes.
[1:27:14] So, he's he's being sent to a people
[1:27:16] that were not
[1:27:18] Jew. They were not Jews to begin with.
[1:27:21] He began to think about the rejection.
[1:27:24] So, you are here sitting here. You've
[1:27:26] received the message of the hour. And
[1:27:28] with that message comes a
[1:27:30] responsibility. You got to share it. You
[1:27:33] got to spread it. You got to tell
[1:27:34] others. You are the light of the world.
[1:27:36] You are. So everywhere you present
[1:27:38] yourself, there's something about you.
[1:27:40] Whether you want it or not, whether you
[1:27:42] believe it or not, there's something
[1:27:44] about you that's different from any
[1:27:46] other man. So God is wanting to use you.
[1:27:49] But the first thing that's coming in my
[1:27:51] mind is these people are not even my
[1:27:54] people.
[1:27:57] these people, they are, you know, they
[1:27:59] I'm afraid I'm going to be rejected.
[1:28:02] Jonah, he's thinking about things that
[1:28:04] is that are going to happen even before
[1:28:07] they happen.
[1:28:11] What if they reject
[1:28:15] me? He he he felt like he was not the
[1:28:18] right person for the job. Well, if these
[1:28:21] people are Gentile, then find a Gentile
[1:28:23] and send it to them.
[1:28:26] At least the gentile has something in
[1:28:28] common with him. I have nothing in
[1:28:30] common. I these people are drug dealers.
[1:28:33] These people are this and they are faith
[1:28:35] and I I I never smoke all that in my
[1:28:38] life. How am I what am I going to
[1:28:39] testify to them?
[1:28:42] He had all the excuses and the reason
[1:28:45] Job he didn't make sense to him because
[1:28:48] he was a Jew. He wanted the Gentile to
[1:28:50] go. the people he says people that he
[1:28:53] felt they didn't have much in common
[1:28:55] with. It was such an awkward
[1:28:58] situation. He felt he was not the good
[1:29:00] person for the job. But yet he was
[1:29:03] elected for that job. And the prophet
[1:29:06] said, "If God elected you for the job,
[1:29:09] there is nobody on earth that can do
[1:29:11] it."
[1:29:15] You can run, but you can't hide.
[1:29:19] You can run, but it's going to find you
[1:29:22] and you're going to do the job. So, it's
[1:29:24] either we do it the easy way or we do it
[1:29:27] the hard way. When he's all said and
[1:29:29] done, you're still going to do the job.
[1:29:33] That's the moral of the story.
[1:29:37] So, here he is giving excuses. Oh, I
[1:29:40] can't go to these people. I have nothing
[1:29:42] in common with them. They won't receive
[1:29:45] me. I in fact, you know, I've heard it
[1:29:47] say that he wanted them to be destroyed.
[1:29:50] That's why he didn't want to go
[1:29:53] because they were in conflict with the
[1:29:55] Jew. He said, "Well, if I don't go, that
[1:29:57] means God is going to punish them. I
[1:29:58] won't go so God can punish
[1:30:00] them."
[1:30:04] Really? But he's God over all people. It
[1:30:09] was Jonah's responsibility to show up.
[1:30:12] Just like it's your job to show up every
[1:30:15] time you show up at your work. It's your
[1:30:17] job to show up everywhere you go to
[1:30:20] school. It's your job to show up. You
[1:30:22] just show up. God will take care of the
[1:30:24] rest.
[1:30:27] I think sometimes we think taking the
[1:30:29] the the word of God to the world means
[1:30:32] you go there and you stand there, you
[1:30:33] begin. It it doesn't even mean that
[1:30:35] sometimes. Sometimes it means somebody
[1:30:38] will come and they will just start
[1:30:39] talking about oh you know I have this
[1:30:41] one is sick and they'll just begin to to
[1:30:44] to talk about whatever is going on and
[1:30:46] you can just step in and then say that
[1:30:48] you know what I know a God who can do
[1:30:50] something about that.
[1:30:53] I I know a God who's a healer. You know
[1:30:55] I I I I I I was in that same situation
[1:30:58] as you were. I was stuck. I didn't know
[1:31:01] how to get off of this. I I was also
[1:31:03] bound. I didn't know how to get. But one
[1:31:05] day, God touched me. One day something.
[1:31:08] That's what God wants us. He wants us to
[1:31:10] be the light of the world. So when the
[1:31:12] world is propagating darkness, God has
[1:31:15] somebody who's going to bring light to
[1:31:17] it. That's my responsibility. And we
[1:31:20] need to wear it gladly. It's not
[1:31:22] something to be sad about.
[1:31:26] It's a joy. Oh, to know that I'm air
[1:31:30] coair with Jesus. to know that the works
[1:31:33] that Jesus did I can do also. To know
[1:31:35] that I have the power to impart
[1:31:37] salvation. To know that I can speak the
[1:31:40] word and my word will have an impact.
[1:31:47] But if the devil will work on you and
[1:31:49] start to tell you, you're not good
[1:31:50] enough for the job.
[1:31:53] Remember what you did last night.
[1:31:55] Remember such and such and such. No, we
[1:31:57] do all that we can to be what? to be a
[1:32:01] clean vessel, a prepared vessel. But at
[1:32:03] the end of the day, it's God who has
[1:32:05] control over everything. Amen.
[1:32:08] He didn't call us, clean us, washed us,
[1:32:11] and fill us for us to just sit around.
[1:32:14] He's given us a job to do. Amen.
[1:32:20] What says paragraph 46 it says Jonah
[1:32:24] here was called on and as this was a
[1:32:28] minor prophet of the Bible to go down
[1:32:30] into the city and then it says and here
[1:32:34] we find an example of us
[1:32:38] all every one of us we always are
[1:32:41] running from something we run from
[1:32:44] trouble we run from
[1:32:46] responsibilities we are all prone prone
[1:32:48] to do that. We are all more prone to run
[1:32:52] than we are to stand and face it out. We
[1:32:56] find ourselves running. Sometimes we
[1:32:58] find ourselves running prone to run from
[1:33:02] work. We don't want to do it. We don't
[1:33:05] want to work. Some people just find uh
[1:33:09] thinks they can they can make their
[1:33:11] living without working. But I think
[1:33:14] Solomon, it was he that said that we
[1:33:16] could find here the answer. He says,
[1:33:18] "Watch the end." Paragraph paragraph 46,
[1:33:22] it says, "When we come to choose your
[1:33:24] wife, you get married with or choose a
[1:33:26] husband, you've got a you got to take a
[1:33:29] responsibility when you you must
[1:33:31] remember that." They said you must
[1:33:32] remember maybe you build your home. It's
[1:33:35] a nice pretty home. And then remember as
[1:33:37] a married woman, you got to think of the
[1:33:40] responsibility of raising children. You
[1:33:42] got to think of them pretty slick.
[1:33:56] Um, it says remember
[1:33:59] them pretty sleek wall is going to have
[1:34:03] a little dirty handprint over them. It
[1:34:06] says then you take you got to take
[1:34:08] responsibility of the education of the
[1:34:10] children. You got to take responsibility
[1:34:12] of the clo clothing and feeding.
[1:34:14] Everything is a responsibility.
[1:34:27] Everything we can't run away from it.
[1:34:33] I trust we can embrace that
[1:34:35] responsibility tonight and say that I'm
[1:34:38] glad God called me. Amen. I'm glad to be
[1:34:41] part of the army. I'm going to do my
[1:34:44] part. You know, I was thinking about
[1:34:46] when I'm talking about this uh slave
[1:34:48] that was taken from Africa and brought
[1:34:50] and he lost his family. He lost his
[1:34:52] country. Didn't know where he was. But
[1:34:54] that he said that man that slave
[1:34:57] remember that he was a son of a king and
[1:35:00] wherever he found himself he conducted
[1:35:02] himself like a son of a king. He never
[1:35:05] forgot his responsibility.
[1:35:10] He didn't go to job say well I work for
[1:35:12] an unbeliever. I might as well not
[1:35:14] conduct myself right.
[1:35:19] He didn't say well this person doesn't
[1:35:21] treat me right. Therefore, I'm not going
[1:35:23] to treat them right.
[1:35:25] Also, he didn't say, "Oh, they're
[1:35:28] killing people. They're not treating
[1:35:29] people right. Therefore, I'm going to
[1:35:31] stay I'm going to do wrong by
[1:35:34] them." You go and you read, he conducted
[1:35:37] himself the best way possible. But talks
[1:35:41] about uh uh Joseph, yeah, he was sold by
[1:35:45] his own brethren.
[1:35:49] Sold. But wherever he find himself,
[1:35:52] whether he was in the house of Piphar,
[1:35:55] whether he was in jail, whether he was
[1:35:57] next to Pharaoh, his conduct was
[1:36:00] spotless. Why? He had a responsibility
[1:36:03] not to the unbeliever, but to the God
[1:36:06] that was inside of him.
[1:36:08] Our responsibility is not to the
[1:36:10] unbeliever. In fact, the scripture says
[1:36:12] when you do it, you do it as if you were
[1:36:15] doing it unto God.
[1:36:20] How are you going to attract? How are
[1:36:22] you going to cause somebody to look?
[1:36:24] It's by your conduct. It's by doing
[1:36:26] those things that someone will look and
[1:36:28] say, "Well, I'm treating everybody
[1:36:29] wrong, but how come this one seems to
[1:36:32] just not be affected?"
[1:36:34] I'm calling everybody names, but he's
[1:36:36] not affected. I'm paying everybody less,
[1:36:39] but he's not affected.
[1:36:42] It's not working for you. It's working
[1:36:43] for God.
[1:36:46] See, that's where we become the salt of
[1:36:49] the earth. That's when we understand the
[1:36:52] very responsibility we have been given.
[1:36:55] Because trust me, it's not the boss
[1:36:57] that's taking care of you. It's God
[1:36:59] who's taking care of you. It's not your
[1:37:01] job that's providing for you. It's God
[1:37:03] who's providing for you. When you have a
[1:37:05] need, it's not your boss that's going to
[1:37:07] take care of it. It's God who's going to
[1:37:09] take care of it.
[1:37:14] I'm a
[1:37:16] Christian, the most privileged
[1:37:19] position to be called in this
[1:37:22] generation, but am I living according to
[1:37:25] my
[1:37:27] responsibility? Not responsibility in
[1:37:29] the bad sense, but God, with this
[1:37:33] election, there's something beating on
[1:37:36] my heart to do a work for you. There's
[1:37:39] something beating in my heart to be part
[1:37:42] of a body where I can be effective,
[1:37:45] where I can do something that would
[1:37:47] reflect that this one has been saved.
[1:37:50] This one, something has happened to
[1:37:52] them. This one is not doing it because
[1:37:55] of men. He's doing it because he's a
[1:37:57] heartbeat in him that's wanting to
[1:37:59] reflect something that's happened to
[1:38:02] him. See, the challenge is we are not
[1:38:05] pretty purged up. We come to a a
[1:38:09] disagreement and all of the sudden and
[1:38:11] this one runs this way, that one runs
[1:38:13] and and all of the sudden some are
[1:38:15] looking a far off to just criticize. Oh,
[1:38:18] that's not done right. That's not said
[1:38:19] right. That's not a
[1:38:23] Well, maybe the reason why you see it's
[1:38:25] not done right so you can come and help.
[1:38:35] Maybe it's the wrong key so you can come
[1:38:37] and help.
[1:38:44] I don't want to be a spectator in the
[1:38:46] house of God. I want to be a
[1:38:48] contributor.
[1:38:49] One who that David said, I will dwell in
[1:38:53] the house of the Lord all the day of my
[1:38:55] life. I will I will look upon him. I
[1:38:58] will come. Why? Because David knew that
[1:39:01] there was a benefit into being that kind
[1:39:04] of place. They knew that if I'm part of
[1:39:07] the body of Christ, that's how I can
[1:39:09] become effective. Not when I do on my
[1:39:11] own. When I become part of something
[1:39:13] greater that God is doing, that's when
[1:39:16] we are more effective. If the musician
[1:39:18] could
[1:39:22] come
[1:39:23] says, "And it's so easy when the
[1:39:27] responsibility face up to shrink from
[1:39:30] them." And we find out that mar that
[1:39:34] marriage is a responsibility in all
[1:39:36] manners. Even many times we find out
[1:39:39] this is a hard to say but it's true. But
[1:39:42] that ministers uh ministers it says many
[1:39:45] times they shrink that they sherk a
[1:39:48] responsibility to stand for the truth of
[1:39:50] the word of God. When they are
[1:39:52] confronted with it they sherk that
[1:39:55] responsibility. It says when the truth
[1:39:57] of the word of
[1:39:58] God of the word of God is brought face
[1:40:01] to face with a human being, we are prone
[1:40:06] to sherk back until the last
[1:40:15] resource. That's the nature. That's what
[1:40:18] a pastor preached on resistance. There's
[1:40:21] this resistance every time. But I
[1:40:25] believe the power lies in the
[1:40:29] responsibility. Moses knew that he had a
[1:40:32] responsibility. He stood there. The
[1:40:34] burning bush told him. And because Moses
[1:40:37] believed the burning bush, he was ready
[1:40:40] to lay down his life for it.
[1:40:44] The question is, are we ready to lay
[1:40:46] down our lives for it? Because if it's
[1:40:48] the truth, then we have to be willing to
[1:40:50] lay down our lives. We have to be
[1:40:53] willing to give everything. We have to
[1:40:55] be willing to stand there and say that
[1:40:57] God called me. God talked to me. It
[1:41:00] doesn't matter whether it's sickness. It
[1:41:02] doesn't matter whether it's confusion.
[1:41:05] It doesn't matter what it is. I will
[1:41:07] stand here and I have been given power
[1:41:09] to cast that devil down. I have been
[1:41:13] given as member of this body. as member
[1:41:16] when one is attacked when my family is
[1:41:18] attacked I as a father because God gave
[1:41:21] me responsibility over my children over
[1:41:24] my wife I have the right to speak a word
[1:41:32] that's where the victory lies not in
[1:41:35] running but in coming forth in
[1:41:37] confronting it in standing against it
[1:41:41] it's fighting it's standing there and
[1:41:43] knowing that the position was not given
[1:41:45] given to me by I, you know, I love when
[1:41:47] I every time I watch those uh uh uh uh
[1:41:50] uh uh uh you know, rednecks and
[1:41:53] constitution lovers, you know, I just
[1:41:55] they said, "My rights was not given to
[1:41:57] me by United State. It was given to me
[1:41:59] by
[1:42:00] God." At least they know something.
[1:42:04] But here we are power. It says that you
[1:42:09] shall be endued with power from above.
[1:42:11] In fact, it comes in the same time. He
[1:42:14] says, "I call you no more church. I call
[1:42:16] you bride." He comes and he talks about
[1:42:18] the manifestation sons in the end time.
[1:42:21] He comes, he talks about adoption at the
[1:42:23] end time. For what? It's a
[1:42:25] responsibility.
[1:42:28] A change in responsibility.
[1:42:30] So that the works that I do, ye shall do
[1:42:33] also.
[1:42:38] But how are we going to do the work if
[1:42:40] we don't take the positioning?
[1:42:44] If every time something comes up, we
[1:42:46] feel
[1:42:47] like, you know, it's almost like me on
[1:42:50] Tuesday, my phone ringing and me
[1:42:51] looking, it's Brother
[1:42:55] David. Should I
[1:42:59] answer? It's our position to fight. It's
[1:43:03] our position to be part of the body. Let
[1:43:05] Let me just find this. Let me read this
[1:43:07] in closing. Maybe you can help me find
[1:43:09] this if you can stand tonight.
[1:43:27] But when I'm talks in God's provided
[1:43:30] way, it says
[1:43:32] that I love this. It
[1:43:36] says I have it somewhere, but I couldn't
[1:43:39] find it. But you can find it there.
[1:43:41] Preaching
[1:43:42] 550513. It says, "Attend your
[1:43:46] church. Be real
[1:43:49] loyal. Just stand by your church. Stand
[1:43:53] by your pastor. Help him with everything
[1:43:56] you got. Give him spiritual support.
[1:44:00] Fast and pray for him. And have faith in
[1:44:03] him. And God will lead the church to
[1:44:07] that glorious day where we are looking
[1:44:10] for him to come. We are looking forward
[1:44:13] to come.
[1:44:18] It's our
[1:44:21] responsibility. If we're going to be
[1:44:22] effective, we're going to have to
[1:44:24] function as a body. We're going to be
[1:44:27] have to function together. One needing
[1:44:30] another, one one waiting for another.
[1:44:33] One needing another and the other being
[1:44:34] there to help.
[1:44:42] All of us working together in order for
[1:44:45] us to make it. Let's just bow our heads
[1:44:50] tonight. Our gracious
[1:44:55] father, I just had this on my heart,
[1:44:58] Lord.
[1:45:02] And called to be a light in the end
[1:45:04] time, Lord. I just
[1:45:07] thought you've called us to
[1:45:10] be, Father, a responsible group of
[1:45:13] people, Lord. And Lord, and I believe
[1:45:15] everyone gathered here tonight has a
[1:45:18] desire within his heart.
[1:45:20] I pray father that where we fell short
[1:45:23] may you help us Lord
[1:45:25] and father where we fail to
[1:45:28] understand what you're trying to do Lord
[1:45:31] and help us understand oh God and your
[1:45:34] prophet will say in this message we need
[1:45:37] understanding we need understanding for
[1:45:40] without understanding then we wouldn't
[1:45:41] know what to do Lord come and lead us oh
[1:45:44] God and father let us take our positions
[1:45:47] and stand on the wall and fight. Let us
[1:45:51] know that we've been elected to be part
[1:45:53] of your army and stand with our sword
[1:45:55] ready to go to battle, Lord.
[1:45:58] And Father, help us come into the place
[1:46:01] where you you've called us where we care
[1:46:04] one for another, where we go after one
[1:46:06] another, where Lord, the the body where
[1:46:09] everybody supplies the need. Then we
[1:46:12] understand, Father, that we are all
[1:46:14] called to be part of this one great army
[1:46:16] that you're
[1:46:17] building, Lord God, that if there be any
[1:46:20] sick among
[1:46:21] us, Lord, that they will feel the prayer
[1:46:23] of the saints come over them and they
[1:46:26] will be healed. And Father, where we go
[1:46:28] and we can lay one one day our hands one
[1:46:31] on another, not just by commission, but
[1:46:34] with the love of God within our hearts
[1:46:36] to do the works which you have called us
[1:46:38] to do. Forgive us if we've just played
[1:46:42] church or if we lack the understanding,
[1:46:45] but bring us into a place, Father, where
[1:46:47] this understanding is forefront in our
[1:46:49] mind. We love you and commit, Father,
[1:46:52] what we've said into your hands and pray
[1:46:54] that Lord, then help us. I lift my hands
[1:46:56] tonight and say just just come by my way
[1:46:58] Lord and let your word just have a place
[1:47:01] in my heart tonight that I may be Lord
[1:47:04] one even receive the very word that I
[1:47:07] have preached to say that Lord

[1:47:11] place where you want us to be we commit

[1:50:17] worship the Lord and to ask God to move
[1:50:20] upon us in our lives that we could be
[1:50:23] better doers, not just a hearer of it.
[1:50:25] But I say, I Lord, I want to be a doer
[1:50:27] of the word. Lord, I I just don't want
[1:50:29] to go from here tonight and say, "Oh,
[1:50:31] that was just a good sermon." And go
[1:50:32] back. But let's let the word have an
[1:50:35] effect on us. And let's just while we
[1:50:37] just worship a little longer, would that
[1:50:39] be okay? We just worship the Lord and

[1:58:46] somebody or let me say it this way, if
[1:58:49] there's somebody you wanted to see and
[1:58:50] you didn't see them, reach out to them.
[1:58:51] Give them a call. Let them know you're

[1:58:56] those thoughts come to our mind and we
