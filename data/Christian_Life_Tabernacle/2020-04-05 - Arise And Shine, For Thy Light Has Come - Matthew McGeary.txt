praise the Lord a man it's good to be gathered together again though we're gathered and and in a way that we're not used to many of us just scattered around the Metroplex and but we're still approaching the same word we're still approaching the same Jesus Christ and I would say that what you get out of the service tonight is going to depend on the way you approach the service and what you expect so I know being at home and streaming many times it's difficult to to enter in but we just trust that God will be a portion a man let's just go before the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we love you we thank you Lord you're the same yesterday today and forever Gordon you said where two or three are gathered in my name I would be in their midst Lord we would have maybe not foreseen these times where we would be scattered abroad and streaming the service via technology Lord you're so mindful and you're so faithful that we know that by the preaching of the word and by your promises that you're willing you're ready you're able to move on the scene of each one Lord I pray as the word would go forth Lord may it not be my words but may be may it be your unsellable word Lord that you would speak to your bride Lord she would feed the hungry hearts Nord you'd save the lost deliver those that are in bondage Lord bring peace to those that need comfort or do those things that only you can do now Lord we just ask that you come and break the bread of life as only you can now in Jesus Christ name we pray amen praise the Lord Amen we'll be reading out of Isaiah chapter 60 I would say brother Andrew if you notice this light over here going crazy for me if you can maybe cover that or something because uh maybe it can be a little distracting that it seems maybe only when the music's going but we're gonna be reading out of Isaiah chapter 60 be reading verses one to a man praise the Lord well a man there's just a few a number here in the church building but by God's grace there's there's several hands out there several hearts out over the internet and the airways and we're just looking forward to what the Lord has in store and I would say that just as you would pull on the word being here I believe that you can pull on the word in your homes and wherever you are at whether you're at your job or you're in a car wherever you're at God sees you there and I believe that if we come with an approach and an expectation towards the word you're not approaching the man you're not approaching this church building but you're approaching the creator of heavens and earth and he knows what's in your heart he knows what you have need of and if you would just now submit yourself to his will and his word and say lord I have a need Lord I have questions in my heart Lord I'm needing you to come and I'm eating you to speak to me and my place of need and the Lord according to his word is already on his way to speak to you reading out of Isaiah chapter 60 a verse 1 it says arise shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon the the prophet of God takes this as his text to preach the message Shalom and it's his New Year's message to the church there in 1964 I believe he preached to Shalom January the 12th of 1964 and my heart was just moved this morning as our pastor drew inspiration from there's a man here that can turn on the light and brother Branham preached that December 29th 1963 just heading into the new year that evening he would preach look away to Jesus there in Jeffersonville and then he would travel to Mesa Verde or see Sierra Vista I believe it is a Arizona and he would preach Shalom and this would be his his new year message to the church and you know there's not many here so you can stand or sit or do whatever you're comfortable with so you may be seated first that there are so much of that in the world today in growing darker and darker all the time each year we find that the world gets darker spiritually speaking because they're groping in darkness there's more sin just passing through what we have the assassination of the president and so forth and people being murdered right here in our country where we wouldn't think that would happen in a time of modern civilization but we sure have it because gross darkness is upon the people now those who will not turn to the light then there's only one thing I can say for this coming year you're going to stoop darker and darker as the year goes on but to those who will turn to the light then you'll get brighter and brighter unto the perfect day that we look for his appearing we're all darkness will be faded away and the reason of that is why I say to the Church of the Living God Shalom because we are his light jesus said you are the light of the world oh if you had just turned to the light this evening all rise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon you oh what a time that we're living in the prophet of God said that the scripture here and I say I want to choose prophecy for this hour this time that we're living in and he goes on to say just further down there and the message he says there is some great something great laying ahead of us and this is what I want to work to it may be here towards the the goal or just to say that to know that where we're standing we're standing in the greatest hour that's ever struck humanity oh we're one step closer to the change of our bodies and there's something great laying ahead of us where the years has been the joy that's we've looked forward to the pressing coming of the great light and now we can see it breaking over her horizon realm it's breaking between mortal and immortality we see it breaking between heavens and earth from earthbound sickness in a troubled world into a bright shining day of immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal earth that shall never pass away its Shalom unto the church now it's light coming for the believers but gross darkness to the people Oh Saints don't be discouraged as we see the darkness and we see all the sickness we see all the calamity in life it's gross darkness to the people all but to the bride of Jesus Christ arise and shine Shalom peace God's peace be unto you because we're going into a rapture we're going into a body change ome in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're going to be changed I'll be encouraged be excited we're right here at the climatic event of all creation that God would have a bride that's been called out for his own choosing that's gonna be quickened and go into a rapture I want to read out of 1st Thessalonians 4:16 it says first Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout I just want to say the whole church denominational systems and all of the religious leaders out there even the Jews and all of the religious were out there they're all looking for a coming Messiah they're all looking for the Lord to descend and I want to just make a point here in the scripture because if you miss this coming you're not going to see that coming and he says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then which we then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words I want to I want to comfort you tonight with these words that that soon we're gonna hear the voice the voice of the resurrection and we're going to be changed and Paul is admonishing us here comfort one another with these words if we've ever lived in a day where we could be comfort by these words it's this day because that's the next breaking that's going to come forth we're not looking for another song we're not looking for something else to happen but what we're looking for is to be changed all I want to say that the shout has brought forth a resurrection from the gross darkness it's brought a resurrection from the Creed's and the and the denomination and the sin that's out there in the earth it's the shout has brought forth coming out of all of the confusion all over the doubt all over the fear week when you've heard this shout because the shell is the Lord descending with a shout calling unto the elect calling to the bride it's calling you out from the gross darkness that's in the world the shout is bringing forth a resurrection out of this gross darkness and brother the brother branham refers to this he says it's just like it was there in the beginning the world was laying there in darkness as it was without form and void but God said let there be light and then the Spirit of God moved upon the earth upon the waters and life came into manifestation the prophet of God said why did he do that because there were seeds laying there in the earth and that the only way they they could come to manifestation as if the light would shine upon that seed and so God said let there be light you understand that the shell that has come in the seventh church eggs there were predestinated seeds that have been planted here in the lady ocm eggs and the Lord Himself has descended with a shout look there be light his word is light and that light has shined upon your heart its shine upon that predestinated see it's told you out of the world it's called you out of denomination it's called you out of addictions and drugs and alcohol and chasing women and smoking cigarettes why because the light has struck that predestinated seed paste down on the inside of you and it leaped forth to joy her eyes and shine my light has come God's spoken word manifested his light bringing forth life a pastor this morning just what a beautiful message we heard God spoken word manifested its light bringing forth life that's where in the very beginning when he said let there be light that light was bringing forth life and that's what the revealed word of the hour has done in this day the word is light and that light is bringing forth many sons and daughters of God into the perfection of his very own image oh I know it looks dark but as we heard this morning I wanna say fear not little sister there's a man here that can turn on the light the capstone has descended a perfect love is here to cast out all your fear perfect love is here to test out your doubt perfect love is here to settle all your unbelief the prophet of God says in shallow many people ask why they asked somebody asked me why why must these things happen maybe you're looking around right now I wonder why does all this have to happen why are we going through this I'm cooped up in my home I'm going bonkers I can't I can't go out I can't even go to work I can't even go to school I'm losing my mind the kids are driving me crazy I've never spent this much time with my husband and all my life I've never spent this much time with my kids there are usually I don't even know what to do with myself why is all this happening to me why is all the chaos and all the others Liza's Cove at 19 just just took them to the whole globe up I grip and just shut down the whole economy all had money and stops and Bosley they plummeted down all my oil our reserves are drying up what am I gonna do why is all this happening why must these things happen why did this happen to me why why did I start and this happened and I had this trouble here and this upset me here and I lost this here sometimes I've asked why why when I was just a young minister and first started out why did God take my wife right out from under me take my baby girl right from beneath my heart why did he do that you could see the silver in question here as the Prophet my what uh what a sobering thought here why did you do that Lord these next words are profound he said I didn't know I do now I just held my hand in his hand and kept trustee he knows every Junction the backside of a desert sometimes where God moulds righteous men into sages and prophets see everything is working out for your good I want you to be comforted by these words eyes and shine soon we're going in a rapture oh the rapture cycle has already started if you've heard the shout you've already been caught up into the rapture cycle because the Prophet said the Lord does all three while he's descending and you have heard the shout therefore you have been called out you've been caught up into a rapture cycle and as we're kneeling that capstone Oh as we near him by that word the next thing that's going to take place and you're going to be challenged hallelujah as I thought on these things why why do these things have to happen I started to think about the disciples imagine the confusion and the disappointment and the questions why did all these things have to happen it just looked like everything was setting up just right they had received their Messiah they had received the one the Word made flesh here he was their king and they were just wondering when is he when he's either gonna let the whole world know man this Roman oppression is gonna be over with oh he's just gonna start plucking them all off by the sword and and he's gonna show them who's boss but before that could happen all of a sudden their Lord is taken and crucified and now you have a bunch of people who have been called out they've been elected they've left everything you'll follow the Lord and now the thereé one that they were falling has been taken from them and he's been crucified and put in a tomb or you can imagine the confusion you can imagine maybe the heartache and the questions and you can imagine maybe the people that would revile them and maybe family members said see I told you he wasn't who you thought he was you know you know what the things that he said unless you you know tear this temple down and I'll rebuild in three day see he didn't know what he was talking about and all of a sudden maybe they start to take the scriptures of the quote and they try to tear you down but something inside of their heart said I don't understand it I don't know why but Owen side of me something believes I know that that is the Messiah you have to come to that same resting place with the revealed where to the our people can take quotes and they can take scriptures and they can try to tear the whole picture apart but as you've heard from God you've heard from your theophany something that's sprung for tonight and it's yeah and amen and heavens and earth can pass away but you'll still be standing upon the revelation that is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah well what does this all mean the Lord's been crucified maybe as we think of these things we're nearing our Easter Sunday I believe today is Palm Sunday I believe it just it wasn't long ago before this moment they were saying Hosanna Hosanna here we come riding on the fall of an ass fulfilling Scripture but little did the disciples know that he still was fulfilling Scripture and I want to say in the midst of all your questions in the midst of all your confusion in the midst of all your doubt he's working on your behalf he's fulfilling Scripture he's right on time you just complete keep believing you don't doubt it and here they come and John 20 verse 1 it says the first day of the week this is after the resurrection unbeknownst to them the first day that we come with Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark under the sepulchre and see if the stone taken away from the sepulchre then she runneth she cometh the Simon Peter and to the other disciples whom Jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre we know not where they have laid him think of this now think of the atmosphere and the questions and the things that these believers were pondering during this time here they had walked with them they had handled her bed a all that slept with him they had there travelled with him he had fed them he discerned their their hearts heat he was with them they were with them they went everywhere he went Lord I'll go wherever you go and all of a sudden now these heavy hearts are there they're wondering what all of this means and they're downtrodden maybe and discouraged not realizing that they were living during the greatest hour that had ever struck humankind you realize the hour that they were living that all that Jesus said he would do he had come now and He fulfilled the law he'd laid down his life and he had risen on that Easter morning the kids Mandira demon had come and he had paid the penalty for sin and yet power to lay his life down but he had power to take that life up again and he had risen from the grave declaring that he was the mighty Conqueror but his believers and his followers don't understand what's going on they're their eyes are withholding they don't recognize what's going on their their their discards and their downtrodden and the scripture says there in John 20 verse 9 it says for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead we have a many good people and many good believers living right in this hour and yet they don't recognize the scriptures must be fulfilled but when the scripture is fulfilled and manifested it becomes a light to the believer it says for they knew not the scripture that must he must rise again from the dead then the disciples went away the disciples went away again unto their home but Mary stood without the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and see if two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain and see if the two angels in white they said unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto Him because now listen she this is her answer this is what she's you know she perceives that has happened because they have taken away my Lord my wouldn't wouldn't that be be be a sad conclusion because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him now she she is withholding the revelation of what actually has taken place and what actually has been manifested and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus and jesus saith under woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou and she supposing him to be the gardener and as i read over this it shook my heart that Jesus Christ has once a again coming this day and he has veiled himself in the Ministry of a prophet and many people have presumed and wondered oh is this the gardener is this just another good preacher it's just is this just another prophet is this just another flash in the pan is this just another one of those healing revivalist guys see they presumed in their own assumption they came to a false conclusion of who he was standing there discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and the people they miss Jesus Christ veiled in flesh and they presumed it to be something that it wasn't and here even mollies Mary she's a believer below know what I love about this God's going to reveal himself to the elect he's not gonna leave you in that condition long the light is gonna come and chase away the darkness any false conceptions or any false ideas any false creeds or any false denominationalism don't worry about it if you're a predestinate a seat of the light of God's Word is coming to chase away that darkness out of your life he's going to illuminate your path that you can walk at all truth and righteousness hallelujah it says she's supposing him to be the gardener saith on him sir if thou had been born if thou had been borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him away so here Mary sitting there her she perceives her Lord the body of the Lord has been taken away she's mourning she don't know what to do she just spoke with two angels and now she's speaking to Jesus and she's perceiving that Jesus is a gardener and asking Jesus the Lord if you tell me where his body is if you notice in verse 15 now when Jesus is speaking to her he's Jesus sayeth under him woman why weepest thou more of a general turn woman and I thought about that many times and how the Prophet might address the church but there comes a time with as the hour and the clock ticked on down and the word was opened he said I no longer call you Church I call you bride dismiss Grace dismiss Jesus Christ he started to call you by name and Harry Aries he's just in the conversation conversations as Jesus said under a woman why weepest thou and under that maybe conversation or she wasn't catching who it was that was standing there but then in verse 16 hallelujah says jesus said unto her Mary and when he had spoke her name or something took place on the inside of Mary and she turned her unto Him or would she hide her name be called by Jesus Christ she turned unto him and said master oh when she called her name she recognized he was the Lord and this message when you catch a revelation okay I got the message of the hour it's calling for through you hello when he calls your name the darkness it's all chased away and you turned to the light and there that light is bringing forth the seed that God placed inside of you and you're on a journey to fulfill all the potentials that he had placed there I think of those disciples on the road to Emmaus they were discouraged and here the Lord draws nigh unto Him why they're walking along the way with their heavy hearts and they're discouraged and Jesus starts to talk to them and once again their eyes are withholding not to know who it is that walks with them and there he is he's he's walking with him he says o fools it slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken and he expounded within the Scriptures all started with the prophet Isaiah all the way up until the time I'll prophecy a fulfillment that he had done in that day and it says there in the evening time he was getting a little late it was in the evening time and he made like he would go away but they could sneak his trainers at all oh why don't you just a little hearts burn within us as we walked and talked with him along the way and it was the evening time only in the evening time is shall be like look the lie I've been withholding from their eyes but as he fellowship with him he did something familiar to him I believe it was much like he did when he called Mary's name she said I've heard that before and all of a sudden he was there in the presence of the disciples and he broke the bread of life he did something they were familiar to and when they saw them break the bread oldest is that's him and no doubt it's just like it is today when you've heard the breaking on the line the breaking of the bread Jesus Christ he is the bread of life and when it's been broken in the third pole has been open oh you've heard from your theophany it's something that sounds familiar that sounds like home to me hallelujah your eyes come open all the light shines into your soul Oh hallelujah the light of God's Word is shining brighter and brighter than ever before you have nothing to fear I know it looks dark I know it looks like you might not be able to make it I think of the Prophet one time up there on the mountain he got caught in the storm he thought he to be able to handle it but as our prophet as a pastor mentioned this morning talking about a reference point when you don't have any light you go down there in the caverns you when you don't have a reference point you can't make your way around that's the same thing that a blizzard will do same thing when the fog sets in oh you have no disability you have no reference point and there was the Prophet he got to know I believe this was the story we got into the death march he kept coming back around the same point because he didn't know where he was and he started to just feel like really down on himself should I say I'm such an ignorant man I'm such an ignorant servant and he and he started to wonder you know about his situation and all of a sudden I have an ever-present help in the time of trouble and he thought to them I as many times of the Lord had spoke to the Prophet you hear many times which chalk it up to maybe just the wind or maybe I'm just hearing things and I wonder if we don't do that many times as a believer though the word will go forth and the preacher the pastor will stand there preach the word and we might presume that he's speaking to somebody else we might presume and chalk it up to something else and here the Prophet ears I am the Lord an ever-present help in the time of trouble God is our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble and he says well no I must be hearing things and then he says and then it came again and he news the Lord and he fell down on his knees and he cried out to the Lord for the Lord's help and as the story goes as he was standing there he said something touched his shoulder he took he turned around and he said all of a sudden they're just parted and all of a sudden the Lord showed him a clear path all the way to hurricane mountain he million hung a line up there and if he'd follow the line all the way down to the end of the mountain there was everything that was dear to him I believe his wife and child was there and he realized I was walking on my way ride cross into Canada to certain death but the Lord came and he gave him visibility and that's exactly what the message of the hour has done we were certainly walking straight into utter death but the Lord God has come God is our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble when gross darkness is upon the face of the earth the light has shined and part of the darkness and showed you the way to go oh thank you Lord for His Word Psalm 27 says the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life and whom shall I be afraid verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock whoa he has lifted us up out of the darkness Church he's given us the strong rock or revelation he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even until the end the prophet of God said the believer can see the word made flesh but others cannot see it the believer can see the word made flesh but others cannot see it that's why when the prophet Isaiah said in 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign I behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel there stood the Word made flesh it was a sign but yet even a wicked and adulterous generation that seeks after a sign can haven't recognized a sign even if it was placed in the sky 28 minutes after sunset being illuminated of so many miles high as so many miles allied but what is the believers see when the prophet says no if you look at that picture right there and you turn it it's our Lord up there oh that doesn't that doesn't shake the believer something the believer says yes I believe it but a wicked and adulterous generation continues to go on and say well show us a sign well prove it to me prove it to me prove it to me they can't even recognize the sign or the word made flesh because only believers can no wonder today when all these promises of Malachi 4 Luke 17 in Revelations 10 7 have been fulfilled and it's a lie to the believer all of these things it's God's Word that's been manifested it's light unto the believer but yet they can't see it why because they're wretched they're miserable they're poor they're blind and naked and they don't know it it's gross darkness upon the people oh but what is it you're the bride what is it to the bride it's a rise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee well that's what this message is prophet of God says continuing in Shalom how can there be darkness and light it gots to be separated and only one thing separates it the word manifested separates it presses it to the other side here's the darkness on the earth but when the manifested word of God the Sun which was spoken into existence by the word shows itself darkness runs to the other side well can you just testify that's what God did in your life well I was in gross tiredness I was an unbelievable the Word of God came and sought me out and once the Word of God came it exposed all the darkness and it chased the darkness out of my life and it exposed a seed that was on the inside and it was germinated and sprung forth to life and you began on that journey to come into the stature of a perfect man Ephesians 5:14 says wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest this is what the message has done it's the Scheldt coming forth it's awakening the bride wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light the prophet talks about back in those days how they were they were constantly saying fast pray fast pray we're looking for a breaking of a new day oh they were they were looking for some great revival and no doubt they're doing the same thing today o people are praying and saying hello or maybe God will come and cause a great revival and suppress this virus and maybe there'll be an outbreak in all the churches and everybody starts seeking God but when God is revealed and they manifest with them they don't want nothing to do with it it reminds me of isaiah 4 they say o only let me be called a christian only let me be a called a follower of jesus christ to take away my reproach but i'm gonna act any way I want to act I'm gonna cut my hair I'm gonna wear makeup I'm gonna eat my own bread I don't want the word bread I want my own doctrines I want my own trees I want to be able to speak in tongues because it makes me feel good and I want speaking in tongues to be the vindication that I'm in I don't need the word I just need my doctrines and my treats all they don't want nothing to do with it but what is it they've missed the awakening of the bride they've missed the shout of Matthew 25 6 and it says and at the midnight there was a cry man behold the bridegroom cometh well I don't know about you but I remember is my wedding day approached oh and as you near that day I want to say this these should be the most happiest words that there would ever be for a bride behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all the Virgin's arose and trim their laps the Prophet says in the rapture he says the first thing comes when he starts descending from heaven there's a shout what is it it's the message to get the people together a message comes first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps what watch was it the seventh not the sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't have any oil in their lap see but it's lapped trimming time it's Malachi for time and Luke 17 it's Isaiah all those prophecies that can perfectly set in order for this day the scriptures we see it living right here he says what is the shout he says it's the message going forth first the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride oh I want to say get in while you still can get in while you still can look the death angel soon is coming and he looked back there and the children of Israel as they ate that Passover lamb and they had to apply the blood to the doorpost now how did they know what to do to prepare themselves for the Exodus they didn't get a committee together and get a little committee together - hey guys what's the best way for us to get out of Egypt what's the best way for us to go in a rapture why don't we get a little committee together we'll get the elder we'll put them all together and we're just gonna come up with a system to get out of here oh I heard the death angels coming what do you think will satisfy the death angel that he'll pass over our house we're it's going to kill the firstborn of every household no but what did they have they had thus said the Lord from a prophet God's Word came to His Prophet just according to the scripture he does nothing except he reveals it to his his secrets to his servants the Prophet therefore the children of Israel under that prophets message could know for a surety if I've taken the word from the Prophet and I've applied it to my life the death angel is going to pass over me and soon and very soon I'm gonna go in a body change hallelujah that's what we're living for I want to say that if you miss the shout because what did he say what is the shout it's the message going forth first the Living bread bringing forth the bride at the midnight cry behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him if you miss the shout you have missed the rapture if you miss the shout that is God's provided way for you to go into the rapture now I'm not putting a period on that because I believe there's moms and there's dads who are praying for their sons and for their daughters and all that your love will be there I'm not putting a period on that statement but what I am saying if you want to be sure that you know that you know take the message and listen to the shell that God has given because it's calling you out from the gross darkness on the earth and it's making you arise and shine into the rapture Oh glory to God the message has introduced us to Christ the word it's restored us back it's given us quickening power he said these shines I'll follow them that belief well if that spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you it will quicken your mortal body and the rising of the Sun the Prophet says look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of man no the quickening power of God see the quickening power of God foretold this would take place see the quickening power of God made the world testified to it it's the truth the angel of the Lord I told you was around that pillar fire quickening power let the world testify it's the truth and in that day they didn't know what it was and we knew just looked this away and it's our Lord up there he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole Word of God as Christ in Christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us quickening power lets us see his coming Oh hallelujah quickening power lets us see his coming quickening power snatched us from death to life quickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do and what you have done and why you are not have done and what you should have done and what you will be quickening power and all these things o my brothers and sisters for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword listen to what that says quickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do what you have done and what you have not have not done and what you should have done and what you will be quick and empowered all that's none other than God that's unknown other than the word shining a light into your path and he still discerning the thoughts and intents of the bride's heart today or if you'll just be hold them in all of his glory the quickening power of the opening and the revealed word of the hour it will discern the thoughts and intents of your heart it'll tell you what you should do what you shouldn't have done and we're done at what your going to be because you are the bride without spot or wrinkle oh I'm reminded as we just work towards the close here I'm reminded of Abraham how God had given him a promise and you just think now here's the bride in the end time we received the manifested word of the hour we're ripening in the presence of the Sun and we're waiting for a moment in a twinkling of an eye that we're going to be changed well that's what I'm looking forward to I'll comfort one another with these words be encouraged we're looking to go into the changing of our bodies that's the promise that's been given the believer amen and here is a is the son of God who's received a promise that he's going to have a son and there he is in the plains of Mamre Abraham's there with his wife Sarah and what is he doing he's believing hey the lord the lord the lord promised us it's going to happen Sarah I don't know when but the Lord promised it's going to happen and there he is he's there maybe they're there are just there in the I believe it's there in the afternoon and and all of a sudden God says you know come here Michael we're going down to visit Abraham come here Gabriel I wanna create a body for you to step in Oh now Michael go on down Gabriel and then God created the body for himself and he shipped him in that body and he walked up to Abraham and there he deserves the thoughts and intents of her heart in the prophecies and what was the last sign they had before that promised son that they'd waited on all these years to come back was God standing in the form of a man and could discern the thoughts that was in Sarah's heart Sarah be in the church representing the church discern the thoughts that's in the church that was even behind him is that right and immediately after that she changed back to a young woman and him a young man and Isaac was brought on the scene the promised son I believe you're seen the last thing that will happen to the church before the rapture the last sign that Abraham received before the body change because we know that Abraham and Sarah received a body change to bring forth the promised son and he said that last sign that was given to them before the body change was the discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart the last sign that was given before Sodom was burned up in fire was the discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart it was none other than the manifestation of the promised word for this hour the revealing of the Son of Man Revelations 10 7 we have seen the manifestation of the Lord and in his light we have received our side we're not looking for another side I'm not looking for another gospel I'm not looking for something else to come we have received our last sign and the next thing that's going to come is the change of our bodies well thank you lord we are laying in the presence of the Sun just to move forward quickly we're reverencing Luke chapter 17 says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the Son of Man and in verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank and they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed now I just want to take my time to read a quote here because many times we have the question well who is this son of man what is this son of man what is the revealing of the son of man how did the rising of the Sun it says now who is this son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and all of the teachings that we have and confirmations of the Word of God by Word of God by signs by wonders we see today rather than the Book of Luke here as we just quoted from Luke the 17th chapter in the 30th verse now Malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that the word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right amongst us and giving us life Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth all those types in many places he was the firstfruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last days waving of the sheaf what was the sheaf the first one to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride aged for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the world has back again in his full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did not there because I live ye live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was now he speak what a resurrection that was when Jesus Christ he arose from the grave that Easter morning but he says and what a resurrection this is why because the church that had been cut off there in the dark ages and the life had gone away from the church it had started to sprout back through through Luther and through Wesley through justification through sanctification through the outpouring of the Holy Ghost but now it is coming back in the fullness of his power and the quickening power of the Holy Ghost what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power oh we don't have a partial word we don't have a partial truth we have the full chart truth we had before without the fool I shining in the evening time setting the rise and shine my bride for my light has come all come out from the gross darkness arise and shine it's time to go in a rapture glory wealthy musicians would come Oh hallelujah full power and full authority has been restored back to the believer and we've seen it in the first one that came to maturity with the power of the spoken word to speak to the storm little fishy I give you back your life storm you go back to where you came from we saw the first one come to maturity we saw the fullness of the word taking on flesh and now in the bride coming of God the fullness of the word is coming in flesh once again hallelujah first Corinthians 13:10 says but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away with prophet of God said we have the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things because the fullness of the word has come now we can ripen in the presence and come into the fullness of the stature of a perfect man first John 2 8 says because the darkness has passed and the true light now shine ahthe we're not living in the glare of another age not living by a partial light but there shall be light in the evening time prophet says in Shalom the word is light when it's vindicated until the word that is promised for this day is vindicated then it's not light it cannot be if God said let there be light and no Sun come into existence there's no sign of light but when God said let there be light then there was light when God promised a messiah Messiah come then his word was fulfilled and he was the light of the hour when he promised Noah and he promised the others and on down they was the light of the hour and there's a light of the hour today that Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection his word that's promised for this day the works that I do shall you do also greater than this shall you do for I go to the Father greater works greater things than he did you believe it you believe it all they're out on the other ways do you believe it I believe it it seems so humble it seems like he goes over the top of people's heads look when he was here on earth how could you do greater works I translated that many times no more but that's the same thing greater he said and Saint John 14:12 greater works than this shall you do did you notice when you went to make water into wine he took water first already created substance and turned it into wine and when he fed 5,000 he took a fish that once swam in the water broke it and handed it out and multiplied creation he took bread that once was wheat baked it into bread broke it and hung it out handed it out to the people and returned back again and multiply creation but in the last days where there is no sign of creation he speaks it into creation anyhow shows that he's the same God that was in the beginning he can create squirrels he can create whatever he wants to because he's God and if he said I'll have a bride listen to me now if he said I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle he can do whatever he wants to do oh not only is the bride washed not only are you forgiven but you're justified Wow because you are his creation your of him it was his desire to have a bride of his own choosing he can do what he wants to do and he sipped his word to call you forth out of the gross darkness of sin will you be my wife will you be my bride will you arise out of the darkness of late you'll see will you come in a union with the heavenly bridegroom and be my bride oh that's what his purpose in his heart the hidden mystery before the world was ever formed and as the bride comes to the headstone oh she's becoming more and more like him because of the word it's time to rise and shine church for the glory of the Lord has risen in you the bride coming of Christ all we have seen one come to maturity the messenger came according to the light of the promise and wasn't light the Prophet came manifested the prophesied word and it was light and now the word has spoken of a bride without spot or wrinkle and the message was to the bride and as the word is taking on your flesh it is the light of the hour hallelujah let's stand whoa hallelujah glory [Music] draw me draw me low now come running after you draw me trouble Oh draw me low oh and I'll come after you Oh [Music] all he said he can create whatever he wants to because he's gone he said he would have a bride and here's a bride here she is oh maybe is she's scattered out through the dallas-fort Worth Metroplex all we have some in Granberry have some in Dallas and summon forward why are you sitting in your home streaming a little service because you're his bride he said you would have a ride and here she is you are the bride that was spoken up and now that that spoken word has become manifestation you are the light of the world oh thank you Lord Jesus while the spirit and the bride say come you are the final voice in this generation the next thing Saints comfort one another with these words you know the next thing to take place the next thing is the voice of the resurrection then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air comfort one another with these words it's always darkest just a few minutes before day the black out comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before day is because the light is pressing the darkness but the morning star comes out and says good morning Shalom that's him among us his word being identified Shalom the great day is fixing the break when the morning breaks eternal bright and fair when his chosen one shall gather to their home beyond the sky when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there our names are on his book will be there Shalom good morning peace unto you shall old God's peace to the bride hallelujah [Music] oh the presence of the Lord
