[38:57] was the first day the second
[39:02] day until the moment that God created a
[39:08] man he created man in His image in his
[39:13] resemblance when man when God created
[39:18] man he realized it was the achievement
[39:21] of the finishing of his
[39:23] work that he
[39:26] rested when God
[39:29] [Music]
[39:31] rested he gave Dominion of the the the
[39:35] the holding of the power of the earth to
[39:41] man he gave the jurisdiction of the of
[39:44] the earth to
[39:49] man and man had all the power and all
[39:52] the power all the the the might for
[39:54] Earth
[39:57] everything that God represented in
[40:01] heaven man was that representation on
[40:06] Earth man was God on
[40:10] Earth what everything that man uh
[40:14] said God was bringing it to
[40:20] pass the the words of man had the same
[40:23] value as the words of
[40:26] God as long as this man who was placed
[40:29] here on
[40:30] Earth kept the
[40:33] word abided in the
[40:40] word uh the devil came
[40:43] [Music]
[40:45] in and because the devil knew as long as
[40:48] man kept the
[40:49] word that he had all the
[40:55] power the devil came with a portion of
[40:58] the
[41:00] word the devil didn't come to say that
[41:03] the word was not
[41:05] true even when he came to
[41:09] Jesus he didn't come to contradict the
[41:12] word he came with a portion of the
[41:17] word to say that has God really me
[41:23] said yes it's true that God said that
[41:26] but you also
[41:29] know he brought the reasoning in the
[41:33] word and Eve begin to reason with the
[41:39] word and because of one word that was
[41:42] misplaced in the word of
[41:44] God man lost his
[41:48] position when man lost his
[41:51] position what did Adam
[41:56] do Adam who was who who could hear the
[41:59] voice of
[42:01] God Adam whom when God came in the
[42:04] garden of
[42:06] e he had the capability or the attribute
[42:09] to communicate with
[42:11] God when he broke the
[42:15] word he started to go away to move away
[42:19] from the
[42:20] word he started running from the
[42:22] presence of
[42:25] God that's what the devil Christ to
[42:29] do to bring us far away from the
[42:33] presence of
[42:35] God to take us far away from where we
[42:38] can hear the word of
[42:41] God but God but go God who created Man
[42:44] In His
[42:46] Image he didn't he didn't want man to
[42:49] remain in that
[42:53] condition regardless that even the fact
[42:55] that men broke the word of
[43:01] God even though men voluntarily broke
[43:04] the word of
[43:07] God God went searching for that
[43:11] man God came down in the Garden of
[43:14] Eden crying out Adam Adam where are
[43:19] you sometimes we find ourselves in
[43:24] situations where the devil is causing us
[43:26] to move away away from the word of
[43:29] God as true as God did it with
[43:33] Adam when when when if you are Sons and
[43:35] Daughters of
[43:37] God you will hear the voice of God
[43:41] coming after
[43:43] you to tell you Adam Adam where are
[43:49] you to try to bring you back in that
[43:55] position because God want man to be back
[43:58] in the position of
[44:01] godship when God plac his seed in
[44:05] him the the seed that God places places
[44:08] in
[44:11] us it's nothing else but the portion of
[44:14] God
[44:16] himself it's it's God himself in
[44:21] us so we can represent him here on Earth
[44:25] Lord
[44:31] God went in the process of redeeming
[44:37] man and the price was
[44:40] paid it was the uh the the blood of an
[44:43] innocent
[44:45] one Christ
[44:47] himself he
[44:49] came to pay that
[44:56] price bring us back in the position that
[44:58] we had in the Garden of
[45:05] Eden sometimes we don't uh we fail to
[45:09] imagine the privilege that we
[45:12] have to be Sons and Daughters of
[45:17] God sometimes the activities or the the
[45:21] the things of the
[45:22] world the pressure of this world
[45:27] it makes us believe that we are only
[45:31] human we are human it's
[45:35] true but we are not human like all the
[45:38] other
[45:40] humans because what makes the
[45:44] difference it's the seed that God placed
[45:47] in
[45:50] us the the seed that causes that that
[45:53] gives us the hunger and the thirst for
[45:56] the word of God
[46:03] this this this seed that gives us the
[46:06] hunger and The Thirst to be like
[46:12] God Jesus Paid the
[46:14] price but before he
[46:17] went Jesus told his
[46:20] disciples I'm not going to leave you
[46:25] alone I will come back
[46:28] again I will come back again to
[46:31] you I will be with
[46:34] you and even in
[46:37] you until the end of the
[46:42] Earth that's what Jesus
[46:45] said it said the world will see me no
[46:50] more but ye shall see
[46:53] me because I'll be with you
[46:58] and because I
[47:00] live you shall live
[47:06] also the Bible says that heaven and
[47:08] earth will pass
[47:10] away and sometimes we say those
[47:16] words but we don't understand or we
[47:19] don't capture the the the deepness or
[47:22] the revelation of what we are
[47:24] saying and sometimes we read the
[47:27] scriptures in the
[47:29] Bible we know these scriptures
[47:36] sometimes but there will be a time and a
[47:39] moment where something will happen that
[47:41] will cause that scripture to become a
[47:46] revelation I remember in
[47:52] brazaville in in the church they they
[47:55] have where they have displayed the
[47:56] script scripture that says that be still
[47:58] and know that I am
[48:00] God and every time we came to
[48:03] church we read that scripture pretty
[48:06] much every
[48:07] day we were used to that scripture and
[48:10] but one
[48:12] day I needed God in a certain
[48:16] circumstance I was praying for a Circ
[48:18] God for a
[48:20] circumstance I came to
[48:23] church and as a habit I read that
[48:25] scripture out there
[48:28] and I went I went on my
[48:30] knees I began to pray uh the Lord
[48:33] according to that
[48:36] situation and when I open my
[48:39] eyes I I go right back to that
[48:43] scripture it didn't have the same
[48:45] meaning
[48:47] anymore because that
[48:50] day it was God telling me
[48:53] directly that in your situation
[48:57] be
[48:58] still and know that I am
[49:05] God and God wants to take
[49:09] us at on he wants to bring us back to
[49:12] his image and to his
[49:15] resemblance
[49:19] says God could have used anything in
[49:24] nature but God chose to abide or to
[49:28] dwell in
[49:31] man God chose to work in
[49:37] man so God needs you and I in order for
[49:40] him to
[49:41] work God made a promise to
[49:45] Abraham it says your seed shall be that
[49:48] will go to a Strange
[49:51] Land and they will go into
[49:54] bondage for 400 years
[49:58] but at the end of the 400
[50:00] years I will come
[50:03] myself to deliver them from my mighty
[50:08] hand but when the 400 years was
[50:12] up instead of seeing God himself coming
[50:16] down we see a man of of 80 years old
[50:21] with a stick in his
[50:23] hand to say that I've come to deliver
[50:25] the people
[50:27] the same
[50:29] man that 40 years
[50:31] before he was
[50:34] Stronger he killed one
[50:37] Egyptian and he created a big
[50:40] Scandal but when he came back 40 years
[50:43] after tired with a stick in his
[50:48] hand he destroyed the whole
[50:51] Army and he didn't make any Scandal
[50:55] why because it was a man that God took
[51:00] that God
[51:01] used so he can fulfill his
[51:07] promise there was a king in
[51:10] Israel who went away from
[51:13] God
[51:15] Ahab what did God
[51:17] do he found a
[51:20] man when they said in the book of
[51:23] Kings they didn't even know where it
[51:25] came from
[51:27] the story
[51:30] starts Elijah the
[51:32] TSH one of the the the the the Dwellers
[51:36] of
[51:41] GAD says it was a man like of the same
[51:44] nature as
[51:46] us but God could
[51:49] use that God could
[51:52] take and with with his word
[52:01] there would be no rain there will be no
[52:04] DS at least be by my
[52:07] word that it will be only at my
[52:11] word and when spoke those
[52:15] words God accepted that
[52:19] word God made it so that nature will
[52:23] obey that
[52:25] word a man liken unto passion like you
[52:28] and
[52:30] I
[52:32] Joshua a man of like
[52:35] passion in in the midst of the
[52:39] battle he realized that if the sun was
[52:42] to go
[52:43] down that maybe they would have lost the
[52:49] war he didn't go
[52:52] pray he said Son stand still
[52:57] uh Moon stay over
[53:00] there until I finish that which God has
[53:03] committed unto
[53:05] me and nature heard
[53:10] that a man of the same nature as us
[53:16] why it was men that was given unto
[53:23] God they were men that considered every
[53:26] word of
[53:30] God there was a a man Whose desire and
[53:34] and the the heart's desire was to please
[53:37] God they could have had H
[53:41] faults but the
[53:45] desire was to be pleasing to God in
[53:48] every
[53:52] circumstance and God always need man
[53:56] God always need
[53:58] man and tonight my
[54:01] prayer when I say
[54:04] Lord that every time you need a man here
[54:08] I
[54:10] am and I want that to be the prayer for
[54:13] each one of us that from
[54:16] tonight

[54:23] way I want to consider your word in such
[54:26] a way

[55:59] Cornelius and bring the Holy Spirit

[56:04] Pentecost in the upper room but God

[57:38] burden to bring somebody else in the
[57:40] presence of
[57:43] God
[57:47] says in the message uh Look Away to
[57:54] Jesus preach member 29th evening
[57:59] 1963 paragraph
[58:03] 256 it
[58:05] says what you look
[58:08] for if you if you are you looking for a
[58:11] a peer
[58:17] person some people think that because
[58:19] the Holy Spirit Works through
[58:23] you you would have to be uh some long
[58:27] Pious
[58:29] fellow walk around and and not
[58:33] even that's not the Holy
[58:39] Spirit God don't deal through Angels
[58:43] like
[58:44] that or supposed to
[58:48] be God deals through
[58:53] man the Bible says that Elijah was man
[58:56] like like passion as we
[59:02] are but you couldn't be with him till
[59:05] you see
[59:09] Jesus uh uh Peter and John at the gate
[59:13] called
[59:17] beautiful and when they pulled them when
[59:20] they pulled them up there about the
[59:23] healing of that man
[59:28] they had perceived that they were
[59:30] ignorant un
[59:36] learned but they they they also
[59:39] perceived that they had been with Jesus
[59:44] see because his life was reflecting
[59:47] through
[59:50] them now depend on what you are looking
[59:54] for
[1:00:04] God is not looking for us to be like
[1:00:07] Angels who would walk like
[1:00:14] Angels but God is looking to see the
[1:00:16] reflection of Christ through
[1:00:20] us the works of Christ in our
[1:00:24] life don't
[1:00:26] in
[1:00:27] Simplicity like we
[1:00:31] are to be useful for somebody
[1:00:37] else to be in the bridge to bring
[1:00:40] somebody else in
[1:00:44] Christ paragraph
[1:00:48] 28 the woman had read the
[1:00:51] Bible speaking about the Samaritan woman
[1:00:58] she know she know there was coming a
[1:01:03] messiah and she knew what the Messiah
[1:01:06] would
[1:01:09] do and as soon as Jesus said to
[1:01:12] her bring me a drink she
[1:01:16] said it's not
[1:01:19] customary he's just an ordinary
[1:01:22] man he said now
[1:01:26] if he had been sitting
[1:01:30] there with with a great big turbine on
[1:01:33] and all all kinds of ornament over
[1:01:37] him of some holy man of a holy
[1:01:47] person why the woman would have said
[1:01:50] well here's a priest and went on
[1:01:57] or there's some kind of Rabbi and went
[1:02:00] on because she was a
[1:02:03] prostitute so she couldn't have
[1:02:06] approached a rabbi a holy
[1:02:10] man so if Jesus was to appear as a
[1:02:14] rabbi as a a very holy
[1:02:18] man certainly this prostitute
[1:02:22] woman just by looking at him from
[1:02:24] distance
[1:02:26] she she was going to go a different
[1:02:30] direction but Jesus looked like an
[1:02:32] ordinary
[1:02:35] man but yet all the the the the the
[1:02:38] fullness of
[1:02:40] God was dwelling bodily in
[1:02:44] him we can only be ordinary
[1:02:47] man but fill with
[1:02:51] God to represent Christ in this Dying
[1:02:54] World
[1:02:56] he
[1:03:00] says paragraph
[1:03:04] 260 Minister something something
[1:03:12] another I see a man come to eat today
[1:03:15] where I went to
[1:03:19] eat and that fellow came in and he had
[1:03:22] enough crosses and things on him
[1:03:28] uh it's a good thing sometimes them
[1:03:30] fellow have
[1:03:34] that I think you ought to you ought to
[1:03:37] live you got to live to you got to live
[1:03:40] to life a
[1:03:50] life you don't have to have a lot of
[1:03:53] clergy clothes to prove what you
[1:03:58] are sometimes they
[1:04:00] drink and carry on so much and smoke
[1:04:07] cigarettes and everything and they have
[1:04:10] to wear this uh uh the clergy clothes uh
[1:04:14] clergy
[1:04:16] clothes to even know whether they are
[1:04:19] minister or
[1:04:21] not that's right I will tell you
[1:04:28] the clergy clothes for a man to
[1:04:31] wear is the baptism of the holy
[1:04:37] spirit that will identify you as being
[1:04:40] with Jesus Christ with
[1:04:47] Jesus that's what will do that that that
[1:04:52] God will finish his mission in you
[1:04:57] it's not our
[1:05:01] appearance God can use
[1:05:05] anybody says that you may be a wash
[1:05:10] woman you can be an
[1:05:14] engineer you can be a
[1:05:18] servant whatever you
[1:05:22] are God doesn't need your social status
[1:05:26] for
[1:05:29] anything and even when he came on
[1:05:32] Earth he took
[1:05:35] Peter who couldn't even sign his
[1:05:39] name he took Matthew who was a a tax
[1:05:43] collector he took Luke who was a
[1:05:46] doctor but when they were
[1:05:49] together there were no
[1:05:53] difference they did you couldn't tell
[1:05:55] who's
[1:05:58] who the the the the identification that
[1:06:01] was most
[1:06:03] remarkable was that they had Christ in
[1:06:07] them that they were finishing or doing
[1:06:09] the works of
[1:06:12] Christ that they were walking with
[1:06:16] Christ
[1:06:18] says in the deity of Jesus Christ parag
[1:06:22] paragraph 79
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:28] the deity of him who is
[1:06:34] he some of them makes him a little a
[1:06:37] little uh
[1:06:40] baby he the one who stood on the
[1:06:44] invisible oh
[1:06:50] my platform wrecked out his hand and he
[1:06:53] spoke and said
[1:06:55] let there be light and there was
[1:06:58] light that was Jesus
[1:07:01] Christ for he was in the
[1:07:04] world and the world was made by him and
[1:07:08] the world recognized him not he
[1:07:12] was he is deity of
[1:07:16] God look what he did back
[1:07:19] there talk about miraculous back there
[1:07:22] you talk about shouting
[1:07:26] when he performed the miraculous back
[1:07:29] there when he talked when he did
[1:07:32] miraculous back there to make the things
[1:07:34] that are
[1:07:35] now out of things which was
[1:07:39] not he spoke and it was
[1:07:43] so and that same
[1:07:46] power the same christu Hallelujah
[1:07:57] let the fundamentalist let them people
[1:08:00] who deny the power of God say it was
[1:08:08] wrong but that same power that spoke the
[1:08:11] world into existence is in those people
[1:08:14] that's got the Holy
[1:08:21] Ghost how much we live under our
[1:08:23] privilege
[1:08:26] the same
[1:08:30] power that brought the world into
[1:08:35] existence is in the people that have the
[1:08:38] Holy
[1:08:39] Ghost that's
[1:08:41] true men and
[1:08:46] women it's time that we found out who we

[1:09:18] not hearing you you're not you're
[1:09:21] nothing that's the devil
[1:09:25] God placed in you his
[1:09:28] seed and he
[1:09:32] promised that when the world will see
[1:09:35] him no
[1:09:36] more you will see
[1:09:39] him that because he
[1:09:41] lives you shall live

[1:19:05] said I'm I'm good enough attempts to to
[1:19:08] drive my horses safely around there
[1:19:12] within 10 Ines of my
[1:19:15] wheels and not far

[1:20:14] that I just hung I just hung the
[1:20:18] bank he said you take me that's right
[1:20:24] that's
[1:20:27] one it isn't how close you can
[1:20:32] come or how well you think you are
[1:20:34] fortified to stay
[1:20:38] away stay it says stay just as far away
[1:20:43] from sin as you can
[1:20:48] stay sometimes most time like
[1:20:51] you you know the devil will take you
[1:20:54] very close
[1:20:55] you I'm a Christian you know I'm going
[1:20:58] to resist but
[1:21:01] says stay as as far away as you
[1:21:05] can go as far away as you
[1:21:09] can you said
[1:21:11] well I can do
[1:21:13] this there's no harm in doing
[1:21:17] this well if there is a question in your
[1:21:20] mind don't you do it at all
[1:21:25] anywhere there's a
[1:21:28] question stay away from it then
[1:21:33] see then you are absolutely living by
[1:21:36] faith if there's no if there's no
[1:21:40] question if there's a question leave it
[1:21:43] then leave it don't go around it at
[1:21:48] all look stay away from
[1:21:51] it the devil will try to bring your
[1:21:53] excuses
[1:21:56] but if you want to keep deity in
[1:21:59] you if you want to continue the works of
[1:22:03] Christ in the manifestation of the Holy
[1:22:06] Ghost but what
[1:22:09] saying stay as far away as you
[1:22:14] can don't try to come
[1:22:17] closer and to see how far you can get
[1:22:21] closer but stay far away as you can
[1:22:26] and the best way to stay away from
[1:22:29] that is every time you want to do
[1:22:32] something what is the scripture
[1:22:34] say Lord what do you
[1:22:37] say should I do
[1:22:39] this should I associate myself with
[1:22:43] it should I associate myself with such
[1:22:46] and
[1:22:47] such if there's a
[1:22:50] doubt says don't do it
[1:22:58] and that's how
[1:23:00] Christ by his holy
[1:23:03] spirit we'll do that we are his
[1:23:07] Representatives he needs you he need me
[1:23:09] tonight he needs you
[1:23:12] tonight he needs every single one of us
[1:23:16] tonight to fulfill his
[1:23:20] work to continue his work
[1:23:24] regardless of who you
[1:23:26] are even a
[1:23:29] child God can do something through a
[1:23:32] child you know the story of
[1:23:36] non it was a young
[1:23:39] girl came and helped
[1:23:42] non to go to go receive his
[1:23:46] healing even a young
[1:23:49] child God can use
[1:23:52] him he can use so he can help somebody
[1:23:55] to get into the kingdom of
[1:23:58] God God needs every single one of
[1:24:02] us God needs
[1:24:05] us
[1:24:09] continues paragraph
[1:24:12] 26
[1:24:14] remember the Bible
[1:24:17] says you are living written
[1:24:21] Epistles read of all men oh
[1:24:26] not many people don't want won't read
[1:24:28] the
[1:24:31] Bible but God made God has made you a
[1:24:35] living
[1:24:37] representative you are a walking
[1:24:41] letter they said
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:46] should should be walking
[1:24:49] Bible Christ in you
[1:24:54] you should be the walking word of
[1:24:59] God and if you profess to be a
[1:25:03] Christian and not that you
[1:25:08] influence you your you're you're
[1:25:15] influencing you will you will you will
[1:25:18] you will make you will make will make
[1:25:21] you have you will have will make you
[1:25:24] have to
[1:25:28] answer for many Souls that you've turned
[1:25:31] away
[1:25:35] aside as turn away from
[1:25:39] Christ
[1:25:43] uhhuh it behooves us
[1:25:46] tonight to think about
[1:25:49] that for every man woman boy girl
[1:25:57] know what you were coming into the
[1:25:59] Judgment you might escape this that or
[1:26:03] the
[1:26:04] other you might beat uh the uh income
[1:26:08] tax and might escape the internal
[1:26:12] revenue you might do one thing or
[1:26:15] another you might you might have run the
[1:26:18] speed limit and the cup never catches
[1:26:21] you but one day judge is going to catch
[1:26:25] you that's
[1:26:28] certain and we know that man must
[1:26:32] die and after that the
[1:26:35] Judgment death is not a hard thing it's
[1:26:39] a judgment after death that's the bad
[1:26:44] part and there what you've done in uh on
[1:26:48] life and how you've influenced
[1:26:52] others you'll have to answer for it on
[1:26:55] that
[1:26:59] day how much more are we are we are we
[1:27:02] to set aside every weight and the sin
[1:27:05] that so easily besets
[1:27:09] us that we might run with
[1:27:13] patience the race that set before
[1:27:16] us
[1:27:18] looking not to the
[1:27:20] Creeds to the
[1:27:22] denomination to some the person but to
[1:27:26] Jesus Christ who is the author and the
[1:27:30] finisher of our
[1:27:32] faith we know the Bible says glory be to
[1:27:37] God that it's us that will judge the
[1:27:43] Earth and that's why the Bible
[1:27:46] says that the Judgment starts in the
[1:27:49] house of
[1:27:50] God God attracts our attention
[1:27:55] so we can be in His image and his
[1:27:57] likeness and on that
[1:28:01] day we will not be the ones to be
[1:28:03] answering like brother is saying
[1:28:06] here of the bad
[1:28:09] influence because we would have lived
[1:28:11] like
[1:28:13] Christ because we would have represented
[1:28:17] Christ then we can
[1:28:21] judge he says parag paragraph 30
[1:28:26] how we should think them things friends
[1:28:32] sternly
[1:28:35] reverently as we see this day
[1:28:39] approaching and knowing that any any
[1:28:43] time your life's Pages the book may be
[1:28:48] close
[1:28:50] tonight and tomorrow will be too late
[1:28:52] for you to do it
[1:28:55] don't put off what you can do
[1:28:58] today for tomorrow tomorrow may never
[1:29:02] come don't put to
[1:29:04] tomorrow
[1:29:07] tonight that we may put ourselves in the
[1:29:09] state of
[1:29:10] urgency to say
[1:29:12] Lord if you have if you need a body here
[1:29:16] I am from
[1:29:19] tonight I give myself I want to follow
[1:29:22] you I want to consider your
[1:29:27] word I want to continue your
[1:29:31] work don't put to tomorrow what may be
[1:29:34] done
[1:29:35] today because tomorrow may never
[1:29:38] come men and
[1:29:41] women boys and
[1:29:45] girls maybe sitting here
[1:29:47] tonight will be in the morg before
[1:29:51] daylight it's true
[1:29:54] then your book is
[1:29:58] closed and you'll never have any another
[1:30:01] chance this may be the last this may be
[1:30:05] the
[1:30:06] last that you'll ever have think of it
[1:30:10] seriously you say Well it probably isn't
[1:30:15] probably it's probably it
[1:30:18] isn't but it could
[1:30:20] be but remember someday the book is
[1:30:24] going to
[1:30:26] close and what you are doing
[1:30:29] now and especially you people who are
[1:30:34] claiming to be
[1:30:36] Christians separate yourself from the
[1:30:39] things of the the
[1:30:42] world have nothing to do with the with
[1:30:45] this with the
[1:30:46] world Shan
[1:30:49] it for somebody is watching
[1:30:52] you somebody is watching
[1:30:58] you and you you're going to not only
[1:31:02] send yourself
[1:31:05] there but going to take them to them to
[1:31:10] the bad
[1:31:12] place and you're going to have to answer
[1:31:15] for your
[1:31:20] influence the Lord wants us to
[1:31:22] reconsider our walk
[1:31:25] we were not
[1:31:27] created to live like
[1:31:32] humans to collaborate with
[1:31:36] sin collaborate with the
[1:31:42] world but to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:31:46] God to be representatives of
[1:31:50] God when God said
[1:31:54] that from it will come out of this
[1:31:58] generation a
[1:32:00] bride a
[1:32:01] church
[1:32:03] pure with uh with no uh
[1:32:11] uh no
[1:32:13] spot no uh no
[1:32:16] wrinkles with nothing of
[1:32:19] resemblance when God
[1:32:22] said it's like a uh uh uh uh uh he's
[1:32:27] defying the
[1:32:29] devil but he's counting on
[1:32:32] you in counting on
[1:32:37] me to say to Satan that I told
[1:32:41] you that there will be
[1:32:44] somebody with no uh uh
[1:32:48] spot here they are
[1:32:51] amen amen right
[1:32:55] he's counting on you and
[1:32:59] I it doesn't mean you won't make
[1:33:04] mistakes it won't mean that you won't
[1:33:07] fall but says that the
[1:33:12] just it's not one who's without
[1:33:17] sin but it's the one who confesses his
[1:33:20] sins and when they confess their sins
[1:33:25] because it's not of his
[1:33:29] nature because it's not of his life to
[1:33:32] sin but something
[1:33:35] happened but it's not of their
[1:33:38] nature the nature is to be like
[1:33:42] Christ and the more we cry
[1:33:45] out and the more we'll read of his
[1:33:49] word and the more we'll
[1:33:52] pray and the mo will be able to hear his
[1:33:59] voice and every time the devil will try
[1:34:01] to bring you to the limit of
[1:34:03] sin that voice will come to
[1:34:08] you
[1:34:10] says that man cannot
[1:34:14] sin without first rejecting the word of
[1:34:21] God the devil will first cause you to to
[1:34:23] reject the word of
[1:34:25] God but God is telling you
[1:34:28] tonight that he didn't create you to
[1:34:32] reject his word but he created you so
[1:34:37] you can represent him he created
[1:34:40] you so you can prove to this dying
[1:34:44] generation that he still has Sons and
[1:34:48] Daughters even if before you came to
[1:34:51] church you did something
[1:34:56] terrible you did something that the
[1:34:59] surround your people surrounding you
[1:35:00] knew that you did
[1:35:03] wrong I want you to consider your
[1:35:06] position
[1:35:07] tonight that I am a Son of God tonight
[1:35:11] that I'm a daughter of God
[1:35:12] tonight that from
[1:35:15] tonight I'm going to give my life to the
[1:35:19] Lord so that you himself can use
[1:35:23] and even with when I go
[1:35:25] back the one that saw me commit a
[1:35:29] sin they told me that I was still a
[1:35:31] sinner I can remind him that I'm not a
[1:35:37] sinner God didn't create me to be a
[1:35:41] sinner God created me to be a son and a
[1:35:44] daughter and for
[1:35:47] then from from
[1:35:49] tonight I'm going to show you until the
[1:35:53] end of my life that I'm a son and a
[1:35:55] daughter of God that I'm a Son of God
[1:35:58] that I will walk according to the word
[1:36:00] of God that I will meditate upon the
[1:36:04] word that I will pray to
[1:36:09] God I will testify of his
[1:36:13] greatness through my
[1:36:17] life that my life will only be the
[1:36:19] representation of God my brother my
[1:36:22] sister
[1:36:24] God needs you
[1:36:26] tonight God need every single one of
[1:36:29] us with no
[1:36:34] exception if God permitted for us to be
[1:36:36] gathered
[1:36:38] here the scripture says that the word of
[1:36:40] God is like a
[1:36:43] rain it cannot
[1:36:45] fall and
[1:36:47] return without fulfilling the reason why
[1:36:50] it
[1:36:52] came God knows knows
[1:36:56] certainly that we probably didn't
[1:36:58] represent him
[1:37:01] sufficiently but he wants from tonight
[1:37:04] on that with all our
[1:37:06] heart that we give ourselves to him so
[1:37:10] we can represent him that with all your
[1:37:18] heart don't look at The Human
[1:37:22] Condition look at at the promise of
[1:37:27] God look at him who made the
[1:37:32] promise we heard it last time with the
[1:37:36] pastor that the most important
[1:37:39] thing is the one who made the
[1:37:42] promise is he
[1:37:45] able if the answer is
[1:37:47] yes then the question is
[1:37:50] answered he made the promise
[1:37:54] because I
[1:37:56] live ye shall live
[1:38:04] also that the world will see him no more
[1:38:08] but you you will see
[1:38:12] him that the only way for the world to
[1:38:14] see Christ uh God today it will be
[1:38:17] through you and
[1:38:21] I but for us to be
[1:38:24] that let's not let the
[1:38:29] devil take us to the limit of
[1:38:33] sin to bring us to flirt with the
[1:38:39] world to take us into the destruction of
[1:38:43] the
[1:38:49] world what brother Matthew read last
[1:38:52] time with the artificial intelligence

[1:46:13] him all through
[1:46:18] life
[1:46:21] need from
[1:46:24] Earth to
[1:46:29] Glory I
[1:46:32] only
[1:46:37] ask to be like
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:47] him amen you know it's it's God's power
[1:46:52] to trans trans form it's not our power
[1:46:55] to transform I like what our brother
[1:46:58] said you know you you have to go to the
[1:47:00] Lord to have help you and uh he sure
[1:47:03] beckons us to come we have a baptism
[1:47:06] tonight and uh uh brother Enrique wants
[1:47:10] to be baptized and uh he knows the hand
[1:47:14] of the Lord protected him from a very
[1:47:17] serious situation and how he wants to uh
[1:47:22] just been on his
[1:47:24] heart uh you know when God goes to
[1:47:29] dealing with you he's not going to let
[1:47:31] go you know he he he doesn't start
[1:47:35] something and not finish
[1:47:37] it you know the brother told me his
[1:47:40] testimony one time we went by the house
[1:47:44] there and and he wasn't
[1:47:47] real mindful of the Lord you might say
[1:47:51] but he said so when lesie and I walked
[1:47:54] into the house he felt something speak
[1:47:57] to his heart to get
[1:48:00] baptized he you know he didn't know
[1:48:04] anything about
[1:48:06] baptism but we know why God does it
[1:48:10] because God's got a a way of doing
[1:48:13] things he's got a provided way and the
[1:48:16] formula is
[1:48:18] repent the formula isn't go make
[1:48:21] everything right and when you're a
[1:48:24] saint you know what I mean then come to
[1:48:28] me no it's when repent means
[1:48:32] to change I want to
[1:48:35] change I I want to I want to be
[1:48:38] different and I'm I'm willing to go to
[1:48:41] the water and and be cleansed and to be
[1:48:46] baptized for the remission of my sins
[1:48:49] that I may receive the Holy Ghost
[1:48:53] so if uh one of the deacons would take
[1:48:56] our brother I guess they're taking him
[1:48:58] to go get him ready and and uh I I know
[1:49:01] some of you might have young children if
[1:49:03] you feel you need to go to get your uh
[1:49:06] children ready for bed uh I understand
[1:49:09] that but if you'd like to stay and
[1:49:12] welcome our brother as he gets baptized
[1:49:15] uh we surely like you to do that so God
[1:49:18] bless you we're going to go prepare for
[1:49:19] baptism it'll be here in just a little
[1:49:22] bit so God bless you go
[1:49:29] ahead amen we'll
